Depictions of the Annunciation go back to early Christianity, with the Priscilla catacomb in Rome including the oldest known fresco of the Annunciation, dating to the 4th century.\n\nScenes depicting the Annunciation represent the perpetual virginity of Mary via the announcement by the angel Gabriel that Mary would conceive a child to be born the son of God.\n\nThe scene is an invariable one in cycles of the Life of the Virgin, and often included as the initial scene in those of the \"Life of Christ\". Frescos depicting this scene have appeared in Roman Catholic Marian churches for centuries, and it has been a topic addressed by many artists in multiple media, ranging from stained glass to mosaic, to relief, to sculpture to oil painting.\n\nParticularly popular during the Middle Ages and Renaissance, it appears in the work of almost all of the great masters. The figures of the Virgin Mary and the archangel Gabriel, were favorite subjects of Roman Catholic Marian art. Works on the subject have been created by Sandro Botticelli, Leonardo da Vinci, Caravaggio, Duccio di Buoninsegna, Jan van Eyck, Murillo, and thousands of other artists. The mosaics of Pietro Cavallini in Santa Maria in Trastevere in Rome (1291), the frescos of Giotto in the Scrovegni Chapel in Padua (1303), Domenico Ghirlandaio's fresco at the church of Santa Maria Novella in Florence (1486), and Donatello's gilded sculpture at the church of Santa Croce, Florence (1435) are famous examples.\n\nThe composition of depictions is very consistent, with Gabriel, normally standing on the left, facing the Virgin, who is generally seated or kneeling, at least in later depictions. Typically Gabriel is shown in near-profile, while the Virgin faces more to the front. She is usually shown indoors, or in a porch of some kind, in which case Gabriel may be outside the building entirely, in the Renaissance often in a garden, which refers to the hortus conclusus, sometimes an explicit setting for \"Annunciations\". The building is sometimes clearly the Virgin's home, but is also often intended to represent the Jerusalem Temple, as some legendary accounts placed the scene there. The Virgin may be shown reading, as medieval legend represented her as a considerable scholar, or engaged in a domestic task, often reflecting another legend that she was one of a number of virgins asked to weave a new Veil of the Temple. Late medieval commentators distinguished several phases of the Virgin's reaction to the appearance of Gabriel and the news, from initial alarm at the sudden vision, followed by reluctance to fulfill the role, to a final acceptance. These are reflected in art by the Virgin's posture and expression.\n\nIn Late Medieval and Early Renaissance the impregnation of the Virgin by God may be indicated by rays falling on her, typically through a window, as light passing through a window was a frequent metaphor in devotional writing for her virginal conception of Jesus. Sometimes a small figure of God the Father or the Holy Spirit as a dove is seen in the air, as the source of the rays. Less common examples feature other biblical figures in the scene. Gabriel, especially in northern Europe, is often shown wearing the vestments of a deacon on a grand feast day, with a cope fastened at the centre with a large morse (brooch). Especially in Early Netherlandish painting, images may contain very complex programmes of visual references, with a number of domestic objects having significance in reinforcing the theology of the event. Well-known examples are the Mérode Altarpiece of Robert Campin, and the \"Annunciation\" by Jan van Eyck in Washington.\n\nByzantine Rite icons display, as is usual, even more consistent compositions than medieval Western images. The Virgin is nearly always on the right, normally either standing or seated on a throne with a building behind her; there are also often buildings visible behind Gabriel. These styles were generally copied in the West until a surprisingly late date, around the 13th century; more varied Western depictions were slower to develop than with other standard religious subjects.\n\nBecause of the natural composition of the scene as two figures facing each other, the subject was often employed in the decoration of a diptych or tympaneum (decorated arch above a doorway). In churches of the Byzantine Rite, the Annunciation is typically depicted on the Holy Doors (decorative doorway leading from the nave into the sanctuary), and in the West the two figures are also found on different surfaces, in the outer panels of polyptychs that have an open and closed view, the doors of tabernacles, or simply on facing pages in illuminated manuscripts or different compartments of large altarpieces.\n\n"}

A sound proceeding from some invisible source was considered a heavenly voice, since the mass revelation on Sinai was given in that way in Deuteronomy 4:12: \"Ye heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only ye heard a voice\". In this account, God reveals himself to man through his organs of hearing, not through those of sight. Even the prophet Ezekiel, who sees many visions, \"heard a voice of one that spoke\" (Ezek 1:28); similarly, Elijah recognized God by a \"still, small voice,\" and a voice addressed him (I Kings 19:12–13; compare Job 4:16); sometimes God's voice rang from the heights, from Jerusalem, from Zion (Ezek. 1:25; Jer 25:30; Joel 3:16–17; Amos 1:2, etc.); and God's voice was heard in the thunder and in the roar of the sea.\n\nIn the period of the Tannaim (\"c\" 100 BCE-200 CE) the term \"bath ḳōl\" was in very frequent use and was understood to signify not the direct voice of God, which was held to be supersensible, but the echo of the voice (the \"bath\" being somewhat arbitrarily taken to express the distinction). The rabbis held that \"bath ḳōl\" had been an occasional means of divine communication throughout the whole history of Israel and that since the cessation of the prophetic gift after the First Temple Era it was the sole means of Divine revelation. \n\nIt is noteworthy that the rabbinical conception of \"bath ḳōl\" sprang up in the period of the decline of Jewish prophecy and flourished in the period of extreme traditionalism. Where the gift of prophecy was believed to be lacking – perhaps even because of this lack – there grew up an inordinate desire for special divine manifestations. Often a voice from heaven was looked for to clear up matters of doubt and even to decide between conflicting interpretations of the law. So strong had this tendency become that Rabbi Joshua (\"c\". 100 CE) felt it to be necessary to oppose it and to insist upon the supremacy and the sufficiency of the written law.\n\nThe last nevi'im (\"spokespersons\", \"prophets\") mentioned in the Jewish Bible are Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi, all of whom lived at the end of the 70-year Babylonian captivity. The Talmud (Sanhedrin 11a) states that nowadays only the \"Bath Kol\" exists.\n\nIn Jewish art the \"Bat Ḳol\" was often represented by the Hand of God, as in the Synagogue of Dura-Europas.\n\nJosephus (Ant., XIII, x, 3) relates that John Hyrcanus (135–104 BCE) heard a voice while offering a burnt sacrifice in the temple, which Josephus expressly interprets as the voice of God.\nAccording to Hebrew traditions, Metatron − an archangel and God's celestial scribe − is called the \"Voice of God\".\n"}

His first spiritual teacher was Shah Inayat Qadiri, a Sufi murshid of Lahore.\n\nBulleh Shah lived after the Pashto Sufi poet Rahman Baba (1632–1706) and lived in the same period as Sindhi Sufi poet Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai (1689–1752). His lifespan also overlapped with the Punjabi poet Waris Shah (1722–1798), of \"Heer Ranjha\" fame, and the Sindhi Sufi poet Abdul Wahab (1739–1829), better known by his pen name Sachal Sarmast. Amongst Urdu poets, Bulleh Shah lived 400 miles away from Mir Taqi Mir (1723–1810) of Agra.\n\nBulleh Shah practised the Sufi tradition of Punjabi poetry established by poets like Shah Hussain (1538–1599), Sultan Bahu (1629–1691), and Shah Sharaf (1640–1724).\n\nThe verse form Bulleh Shah primarily employed is the Kafi, popular in Punjabi and Sindhi poetry.\n\nMany people have put his Kafis to music, from humble street-singers to renowned Sufi singers like Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Pathanay Khan, Abida Parveen, the Waddali Brothers and Sain Zahoor, from the synthesised techno qawwali remixes of UK-based Asian artists to the Pakistani rock band Junoon.\n\nIn the 1990s, Junoon, a rock band from Pakistan, rendered his poems \"Bullah Ki Jaana\" and \"Aleph\" (\"Ilmon Bas Kareen O Yaar\"). In 2004, Rabbi Shergill turned the abstruse metaphysical poem \"Bullah Ki Jaana\" into a rock/fusion song in his debut album \"Rabbi\"; the song was a chart-topper in 2005, helping the album to eventually sell over 10,000 copies and became immensely popular in India and Pakistan. The Wadali Bandhu, a Punjabi Sufi group from India, have also released a version of \"Bullah Ki Jaana\" in their album \"Aa Mil Yaar... Call of the Beloved\". Another version was performed by Lakhwinder Wadali and entitled \"Bullah\". Dama Dam Mast Qalandar, a qawwali composed in honour of Shahbaz Qalandar, has been one of Bulleh Shah's most popular poems and has been frequently rendered by many Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi singers including Noor Jehan, Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Abida Parveen, Sabri Brothers, Wadali brothers, Reshman and Runa Laila. Other qawwali songs by Bulleh Shah, include \"Sade Vehre Aya Kar\" and \"Mera Piya Ghar Aaya\".\n\nAlso in 2016, a collaboration between two EDM artists (Headhunterz and Skytech) named \"Kundalini\" used words created by Bulleh Shah, as well as having the words Bulleh Shah in the lyrics. Bulleh Shah's verses have been an inspiration to painters as well, as in the two series of paintings (\"Jogia Dhoop\" and \"Shah Shabad\") by an Indian painter Geeta Vadhera inspired by the poetry of Bulleh Shah and other Sufi poets and saints. In 2017, British Pakistani singer Yasir Akhtar used Bulleh Shah's poetry in his song \"Araam Naal Kar - Take it Easy\".\n\nSome of Bulleh Shah's verses, including \"Tere Ishq Nachaya\", have been adapted and used in Bollywood film songs including \"Chaiyya Chaiyya\" and \"Thayya Thayya\" in the 1998 film \"Dil Se..\", and \"Ranjha Ranjha\" in the 2010 film \"Raavan\". The 2007 Pakistani movie \"Khuda Kay Liye\" includes Bulleh Shah's poetry in the song \"Bandeya Ho\". The 2008 Bollywood film, \"A Wednesday\", included a song titled \"Bulle Shah, O Yaar Mere\". In 2014, Ali Zafar sung some of his verses as \"Chal Buleya\" for Bollywood soundtrack album \"Total Siyapaa\", and the song was reprised by Zafar same year in \"Pakistan Idol\". The 2016 Bollywood films \"Sultan\" and \"Ae Dil Hai Mushkil\" feature the song \"Bulleya\", sung by Papon and Amit Mishra respectively, which is short for Bulleh Shah. A song \"Hun Kis Theen\" based on his poetry was also featured in Punjabi animated film \"\".\n\nIn 2009, the second season of \"Coke Studio\" featured \"Aik Alif\" performed by Sain Zahoor and Noori. Ali Zafar also used some of Bulleh Shah and Shah Hussain's verses in his \"Dastan-e-Ishq\". In 2010, the third season featured \"Na Raindee Hai\" and \"Makke Gayaan Gal Mukdi Nahi\" performed by Arieb Azhar. In 2012, Shah's poetry was featured with Hadiqa Kiani performing \"Kamlee\". In 2016, Ahmed Jahanzeb and Umair Jaswal performed \"Khaki Banda\"; and Rizwan Butt and Sara Haider performed \"Meri Meri\", the songs were too based on Shah's verses.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

His older siblings were Gino (1877–1909), Elda (1879–1944), Paula (1885–1972). His full name was Carlo Raimondo (Gedaliah Ram). His father was the director of the local branch of the Trieste-based \"Assicurazioni Generali\" insurance company. The Michelstaedters were an Italian-speaking upper middle class Jewish family of Ashkenazi origin.\n\nHis sister Paula remembered him as a child fearful of the dark and heights, stubborn and not at all prepared to apologize for any misbehavior. In school, he was judged \"not very suitable (\"minder entsprechend\")\" for having intentionally and frequently disturbed the lessons during the year.\n\nHis father was the chairman of the \"Gabinetto di Lettura Goriziano\", a local cultural association for the fostering of literary culture, and he pushed his son towards literary study. His mother Emma Luzzatto came from an old and renowned Jewish family of Italian irredentist leanings. Carlo was considered an introverted boy, but by the end of high school (completed in Gorizia), he developed into a brilliant, athletic, intelligent youth. He enrolled in the department of mathematics at the University of Vienna, but soon moved to Florence, a city he savored for its arts and language. There he formed friendships with other students, and in the end enrolled in the department of letters of the local \"Istituto di Studi Superiori\"' (1905). He majored in Greek and Latin, and selected for his \"laurea\" thesis a philosophical study of \"persuasion and rhetoric\" in ancient philosophy. In 1909 he returned to Gorizia and set himself to work on the thesis.\n\nBy about the fall of 1910, he completed his work, finishing the appendices by 17 October. He was surely very tired, and that day he had a fight with his mother, who complained he had not wished her a happy birthday. Left alone, Carlo took a loaded pistol he had in the house and killed himself. So determined to end his life that he shoots himself not once but twice with his revolver, the reasoning behind his suicide has been of much debate, some see it as the natural conclusion to his philosophy, other's see it as a result of confusion. One of his friends from Florence, a Russian woman, had also committed suicide, and probably also a brother who lived in America. Friends and relatives published his works and collected his writings, now in the \"Biblioteca Civica di Gorizia\".\n\nHe is buried in the Jewish cemetery in Rožna Dolina near Nova Gorica, Slovenia.\n\nTracing the development of Michelstaedter's ideas is difficult, : His philosophical vision seems to have formed suddenly, and his brief life did not allow for time to explore other directions. For him, common life is an absence of life, narrow and deluded as it is by the god of pleasure, which deceives man, promising pleasures and results that are not real, although man thinks they are. \"Rhetoric\"—that is the conventions of the individual, the weak, and society—comprises social life, in which man overpowers nature and himself for his own pleasure. Only by living in the present as if every moment were the last can man free himself from the fear of death, and thus achieve \"Persuasion\"; that is, self-possession. Resignation and adapting oneself to the world, for Michelstaedter, is the true death.\n\nHowever, through his citations, numerous biographies we know : Heraclitus, Parmenides, Schopenhaur, Giacomo Leopardi as to be some of his influences. Leopardi of which he greatly admired, and considered to be a \"Persuaded individual\" for he had created a world of his own, a copy of Zibaldone was found in his residence with his personnel markings, sometime after his death. Schopenhaur, of which he was introduced to due to his social endeavors in his period of university.\n\nHis thesis deals with many themes including language, existence, justice, salvation and the institutionalized.\n\n\" Their degeneration is called civil education, their hunger is the activity of progress, their fear is morality, their violence and egoistic hatred—the sword of justice \"\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3072524", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3072524", "title": "Confessio Amantis", "text": "Confessio Amantis\n\nConfessio Amantis (\"The Lover's Confession\") is a 33,000-line Middle English poem by John Gower, which uses the confession made by an ageing lover to the chaplain of Venus as a frame story for a collection of shorter narrative poems. According to its prologue, it was composed at the request of Richard II. It stands with the works of Chaucer, Langland, and the Pearl poet as one of the great works of late 14th-century English literature. The Index of Middle English Verse shows that in the era before the printing press it was one of the most-often copied manuscripts (59 copies) along with \"Canterbury Tales\" (72 copies) and \"Piers Plowman\" (63 copies).\n\nIn genre it is usually considered a poem of consolation, a medieval form inspired by Boethius' \"Consolation of Philosophy\" and typified by works such as \"Pearl\". Despite this, it is more usually studied alongside other tale collections with similar structures, such as the \"Decameron\" of Boccaccio, and particularly Chaucer's \"Canterbury Tales\", with which the \"Confessio\" has several stories in common.\n\nComposition of the work probably began circa 1386, and the work was completed in 1390. The prologue of this first recension recounts that the work was commissioned by Richard II after a chance meeting with the royal barge on the River Thames; the epilogue dedicates the work to Richard and to Geoffrey Chaucer, as the \"disciple and poete\" of Venus. This version of the work saw widespread circulation, perhaps due to its royal connections (Peck 2000), and was the most popular of Gower's works, with at least 32 of the 49 surviving manuscripts of the \"Confessio\" containing this version.\n\nThe subsequent history is complicated and not entirely certain. Much revision took place, some of it by Gower and some probably by individual scribes. What follows is the conventional history as formulated by Macaulay (1901:xxi). The true story is probably somewhat more complicated (see e.g. Watt 2003:11–13 for an overview of recent work).\n\nAccording to Macaulay (1901:xxii), a second recension was issued in about 1392, with some significant changes: most notably, most references to Richard are removed, as is the dedication to Chaucer, and these are replaced with a new dedication to Henry of Lancaster, the future Henry IV. It has naturally been commonly assumed that this reflects a shift in the poet's loyalties, and indeed there are signs that Gower was more attached to Henry's party from this period; but while he did attack Richard later in the decade, there is no evidence that these early changes indicate any particular hostility towards either Richard or Chaucer (Peck 2000), and it has been argued that the revision process was not politically motivated at all, but begun rather because Gower wished to improve the style of the work (Burrows 1971:32), with the dedications being altered as a purely secondary matter. Pearsall (2004:94) assigns a \"dubious status\" to Macaulay's ‘second recension’ and has other comments on Macaulay's account of the text.\n\nA third and final recension was published in 1393, retaining the dedication to Henry. While only a few manuscripts of this version survive, it has been taken as representing Gower's final vision for the work, and is the best-known version, having served as the basis of all modern editions.\n\nGower's previous works had been written in Anglo-Norman French and Latin. It is not certain why he chose to write his third long poem in English; the only reason Gower himself gives is that \"fewe men endite In oure englyssh\" (prol.22–23). It has been suggested that it was the influence of Chaucer, who had in part dedicated his \"Troilus and Criseyde\" to Gower, that persuaded him that the vernacular was a suitable language for poetry, and the influence of Chaucer's \"Legend of Good Women\" has been detected in the \"Confessio\" (Macaulay 1908:sec 23).\n\nWith the exception of a 74line letter \"unto cupid and to venus\" in Book VIII, Gower did not adopt the new pentameter with which Chaucer had recently been experimenting, and which was in the 15th century to become the standard metre for English rhyme. He retained instead the octosyllabic line that had previously been the standard form for English poetry, and wrote it in couplets, rather than in the stanzas he had employed in his previous works. Gower characterised his verse in the Confessio as the plain style.\n\nThis decision has not always met with appreciation, the shorter lines being sometimes viewed as lending themselves to monotonous regularity, but Gower's handling of the metre has usually been praised. Macaulay (1901:xvi, 1908:sec 33) finds his style technically superior to Chaucer's, admiring \"the metrical smoothness of his lines, attained without unnatural accent or forced order of words\". The work's most enthusiastic advocate was C.S. Lewis, who, though admitting that the work can be \"prosaic\" and \"dull\" in places, identifies a \"sweetness and freshness\" in the verse and praises its \"memorable precision and weight\" (Lewis 1936:201). Not all assessments have been so positive: Burrow (1971:31) describes it as \"not so much plain as threadbare\", and notes that the selective quotations of previous critics have served to draw attention to sections that are better poetry, but unrepresentative of the work as a whole.\n\nGower's language differs from the London dialect in which Chaucer wrote. Samuels and Smith (1988:15) observed that there are several ways in which his language differs from that of Chaucer.\nOne group suggests a Kentish influence:\n\nAnother group is definitely East Anglian:\n\nGower's family owned land in SW Suffolk (Kentwell Hall) and had associations with NW Kent (Brabourne?).(Lee in DNB) Thus \"Gower’s dialect is essentially based on the two regional dialects of Kent and Suffolk, not that of London, as Macaulay(1901:cxxx, 1908:sec 32) thought.\"\n\nSome well known differences between Chaucer and Gower are explained by conclusion that Gower is associated with Kent and Suffolk.\n\nThe \"Confessio\" is divided into a prologue and eight books, which are divided thematically. The narrative structure is overlaid on this in three levels: the external matter, the narrative frame, and the individual tales which make up the bulk of the work.\n\nThe external matter comprises the prologue, which spills over briefly into the start of Book 1, and an epilogue at the end of Book 8. Unlike the bulk of the \"Confessio\", these have much in common with Gower's previous works (Pearsall 1966:475). In the prologue he details at some length the numerous failings he identifies in the three estates (government, church, and people) of his time. This section ends with an account of the dream of Nebuchadnezzar (which draws on a similar passage in the \"Vox Clamantis\"), identifying the statue's feet of iron mixed with clay with the medieval world that Gower perceives as hopelessly divided and in danger of imminent collapse. Tens of thousands of lines later, the epilogue returns to these concerns, again touching on the matters Gower believes each estate needs most urgently to attend to.\n\nIn this context, the plan of the work given in the prologue is one of the most-quoted passages of the poem:\nThis is essentially what he does; the external matter and parts of the narrative frame, together with some long digressions (most notably the whole of Book 7, discussed below) make up the \"lore\", while the majority of the tales are wholly concerned with \"lust\".\n\nThe frame story as such is easily summarised. The narrator of this section, conventionally referred to as Amans or the Lover, wanders through a forest in May, as medieval lovers typically do, and despairs at his lack of success. He invokes Venus and Cupid, who promptly appear and demand to know the reason for his sorrow. Upon being told that he is on the verge of dying from love, Venus insists that he be shriven, and summons her chaplain Genius to hear his confession. When at last Genius pronounces Amans absolved of all his sins against love, Venus cures him of his infatuation.\n\nAs the work's title implies, therefore, the bulk of the work is devoted to Amans' confession. This broadly follows the pattern of Christian confessions of the time. Genius leads Amans through the seven deadly sins, interpreting them in the context of the courtly love tradition. He explains the various aspects of each one with exempla, and requires Amans to detail any ways in which he has committed them. The design is that each book of the poem shall be devoted to one sin, and the first six books follow the traditional order for the first six sins: pride, envy, wrath, sloth, avarice, and gluttony.\n\nAt this point, however, Gower breaks his form and digresses: at the end of Book 6 Amans requests that Genius give him a break from the confession and teach him wisdom instead, and Genius responds in Book 7 by discoursing at length on the education given by Aristotle to Alexander the Great. In Gower's hands this becomes a treatise on good kingship, and it is in this book that it is most obvious how the work is intended to answer the royal commission. This notwithstanding, the digression, and the consequent flaw in an otherwise strict plan, is the most frequently criticised aspect of the poem's structure (see e.g. Pearsall 1966:476).\n\nBook 8 returns to the confession. According to the traditional system, the final sin should be lechery, but since this can hardly be considered a sin against Venus, the topic of the final book is narrowed to the single perversion of incest. Though this is one sin Amans is innocent of, Genius contrives to fill a book nonetheless by telling the longest and best-known story in the \"Confessio\", namely \"Apollonius of Tyre\" (VIII.271–2008).\n\nThe treatment given to individual stories varies widely. The \"Apollonius\" is nearly 2,000 lines long, but at the other extreme, the distinction between tale and allusion is hard to define; for example, summaries of the story of Troilus and Criseide appear in three places (II.2456–2458, IV.7597–7602, VIII.2531–2535), but none can really be described as a \"tale\". It follows that it is hard to produce a definite figure for the number of tales in the \"Confessio\". Even excluding the very shortest, however, there are over 100 individual stories (Macaulay 1908:sec 24), making them more numerous than the strict 100 of the \"Decameron\", and much more so than the \"Canterbury Tales\" or the \"Legend of Good Women\".\n\nNone of Gower's tales are original. The source he relies on most is Ovid, whose \"Metamorphoses\" was ever a popular source of exempla; others include the Bible and various other classical and medieval writers, of whom Macaulay (1908:sec 29) lists Valerius Maximus, Statius, Benoît de Sainte-Maure (the \"Roman de Troie\"), Guido delle Colonne (\"Historia destructionis Troiae\"), Godfrey of Viterbo, Brunetto Latini, Nicholas Trivet, the \"Romans des sept sages\", the \"Vita Barlaam et Josaphat\", and the \"Historia Alexandri Magni\".\n\nThe best-known tales are those that have analogues in other English writers, since these are often studied for comparison. These include the \"Apollonius\", which served as a source for the Shakespearean \"Pericles\", and the tales shared with Chaucer, such as the tales of Constance (II.587–1603, also told by the Man of Law) and Florent (I.1407–1875, also told by the Wife of Bath).\n\nThe \"Confessio\" was apparently popular in its own time; its 49 surviving manuscripts suggest a popularity about halfway between Chaucer's \"Canterbury Tales\" (80 copies) and \"Troilus and Criseyde\" (16 copies). Macaulay (1900: vii) claims that it was the first English book to be translated into a foreign language.Nonetheless, Gower, perhaps more than any poet of his period, has suffered through his close association with Chaucer, who as the preeminent maker of the English Middle Ages overshadows his peers in the same way that Shakespeare dominates the turn of the 17th century. And despite this apparent popularity, critical reactions to the work have often been unfavourable.\n\nIn the fifteenth century, Gower and Chaucer were invariably regarded together as the founders of English poetry. John Lydgate praised \"Gower Chaucers erthly goddes two\", \"The Kings Quair\" was dedicated to \"Gowere and chaucere, that on the steppis satt/ of rethorike\", and George Ashby called Chaucer, Gower and Lydgate \"premier poetes of this nacion\" (quoted by Fisher, 1965: 3).\n\nThe first known criticism is an apparent reference in Chaucer's 'Man of Law's Prologue': the eponymous Man, praising Chaucer, observes that\nBoth these examples are references to the \"Confessio\" (\"Canace\" is III.143–336), and it has sometimes been thought that this passage was the direct cause of the removal of the dedication to Chaucer from the later editions of the work (see \"Textual History\" above). It should be noted that this veiled criticism of the \"Confessio\"s immoral stories is not necessarily inconsistent with Chaucer's famous dubbing of his friend \"Moral Gower\"; that passage, in Chaucer's \"Troilus\", was likely written before Gower even began the \"Confessio\".\n\nLater generations have been equally unkind. The influential assessment of Puttenham (1589:50) found Gower's English verse inadequate in every respect:\n\"Gower [...] had nothing in him highly to be commended, for his verse was homely and without good measure, his wordes strained much deale out of the French writers, his ryme wrested, and in his inuentions small subtilitie: the applications of his moralities are the best in him, and yet those many times very grossely bestowed, neither doth the substance of his workes sufficiently aunswere the subtiltie of his titles.\"\nBy the 19th century, the \"Confessio\" was regarded by some as an established \"monument of dulness and pedantry\" (quoted by Coffman 1945:52). While Macaulay (1901:x-xxi, 1908:sec 28) was cautiously appreciative, his contemporary Crawshaw (1907:61) attributed to the work \"a certain nervelessness or lack of vigor, and a fatal inability to understand when he had said enough\". Even C.S. Lewis, who has been quoted above admiring the style of the work, was unconvinced by its structure, describing the epilogue as \"a long and unsuccessful coda\" (Lewis 1936:222).\n\nGower has also been given his share of appreciation. A 15th-century treatise printed by Caxton describes \"his bookes, called Confessionalle\" as\nIn some cases he is praised and damned at once; Jonson (1640) considers him dangerously attractive, and liable to damage young writers who might be tempted to imitate his style:\n\"...beware of letting them taste \"Gower\", or \"Chaucer\" at first, lest falling too much in love with Antiquity, and not apprehending the weight, they grow rough and barren in language onely\"\nPeck (2000) interprets this as unambiguous praise. And even the structure of his work has been declared perfect by some: Coffman (1945:58) argues that\n\"[it] has a large integrity and unity based on a defense of [Gower's] ethical scheme for the universe... Gower tells in the Prologue exactly what he is going to do. He does it well. It is worth doing. And he recapitulates in the Epilogue.\"\n\nWatt (2003:11) sums up the divided critical reactions as \"reflecting ... the complexity of both the poem itself, which invites conflicting interpretations and contradictory reactions, and its textual history\".\n\nTo his contemporaries, Gower's work was generally as well known as the poetry of Chaucer: Caxton printed Gower's work alongside Chaucer's, and Gower became part of the early canon of English literature. But it was Chaucer's works which became the model for future poets, and the legacy of the \"Confessio\" has suffered as a result. It is hard to find works that show signs of direct influence: the only clear example is Shakespeare's \"Pericles\", where the influence is conscious borrowing: the use of Gower's characteristic octosyllabic line for the character of Gower himself. The story of the brazen head, here associated with Robert Grosseteste, were later associated with his disciple Roger Bacon.\n\nWhile not of immense importance as a source for later works, the \"Confessio\" is nonetheless significant in its own right as one of the earliest poems written in a form of English that is clearly recognizable as a direct precursor to the modern standard, and, above all, as one of the handful of works that established the foundations of literary prestige on which modern English literature is built.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "198423", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=198423", "title": "Crime against peace", "text": "Crime against peace\n\nA crime against peace, in international law, is \"planning, preparation, initiation, or waging of wars of aggression, or a war in violation of international treaties, agreements or assurances, or participation in a common plan or conspiracy for the accomplishment of any of the foregoing\". This definition of crimes against peace was first incorporated into the Nuremberg Principles and later included in the United Nations Charter. This definition would play a part in defining aggression as a crime against peace. It can also refer to the core international crimes set out in Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, (genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and the crime of aggression) which adopted crimes negotiated previously in the Draft code of crimes against the peace and security of mankind.\n\nAn important exception to the foregoing are defensive military actions taken under Article 51 of the UN Charter. Such defensive actions are subject to immediate Security Council review, but do not require UN permission to be legal within international law. \"Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations.\" (UN Charter, Article 51) The Security Council will determine if the action is legally the \"right of individual or collective self-defence\", or it may appoint another UN organ to do this.\n\nNo legal authority exists for the definition of the terms \"territorial integrity\", \"political independence\" and \"sovereignty\". However, their face value would seem to disclose the following:\n\n\nThis definition of the crime of aggression belongs to \"jus cogens\", which is supreme in the hierarchy of international law and, therefore, it cannot be modified by, or give way to, any rule of international law but one of the same rank. An arguable example is any rule imposing a conflicting obligation to prevent, interdict or vindicate crimes which also belong to \"jus cogens\", namely aggression itself, crimes against humanity, genocide, war crimes, slavery, torture and piracy, so that a war waged consistent with the aim of repressing any of these crimes might not be illegal where the crime comes within the limit of proportionality relative to war and its characteristic effects.\n\nIn 1928, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, known as the \"General Treaty for the Renunciation of War\", said:\nThe High Contracting Parties solemnly declare in the names of their respective peoples that they condemn recourse to war for the solution of international controversies, and renounce it, as an instrument of national policy in their relations with one another.\nIf a nation does not register with the UN as recognizing the Kellogg-Briand Pact, even if the nation had signed it, the UN cannot hold a claimed violation of the Kellogg-Briand Pact to be a violation of international law (according to its own Charter, Article 102). The interpretation of Article 102 is reserved to the Security Council, so it is possible that a \"crime against peace\" might be found by the Security Council, regardless.\n\nIn 1945, the London Charter of the International Military Tribunal defined three categories of crimes, including \"crimes against peace\". This definition was first used in Finland to prosecute the political leadership in the War-responsibility trials in Finland. The principles were later known as the Nuremberg Principles.\n\nIn 1950, the Nuremberg Tribunal defined Crimes against Peace (in Principle VI.a, submitted to the United Nations General Assembly) as\n(i) Planning, preparation, initiation or waging of a war of aggression or a war in violation of international treaties, agreements or assurances; \n(ii) Participation in a common plan or conspiracy for the accomplishment of any of the acts mentioned under (i).\n\n\"The legal basis for the jurisdiction of the court was that defined by the Instrument of Surrender of Germany, political authority for Germany had been transferred to the Allied Control Council, which having sovereign power over Germany could choose to punish violations of international law and the laws of war. Because the court was limited to violations of the laws of war, it did not have jurisdiction over crimes that took place before the outbreak of war on September 1, 1939\"\n\nFor committing this crime, the Nuremberg Tribunal sentenced a number of persons responsible for starting World War II. One consequence of this is that nations who are starting an armed conflict must now argue that they are either exercising the right of self-defense, the right of collective defense, or - it seems - the enforcement of the criminal law of \"jus cogens\". It has made formal declaration of war uncommon after 1945.\n\nDuring the trial, the chief American prosecutor, Robert H. Jackson, stated:\nTo initiate a war of aggression, therefore, is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole.\nAssociate Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas charged that the Allies were guilty of \"substituting power for principle\" at Nuremberg. \"I thought at the time and still think that the Nuremberg trials were unprincipled.\", he wrote. \"Law was created ex post facto to suit the passion and clamor of the time.\"\n\nThe first article of the United Nations Charter says:\nThe Purposes of the United Nations are:\n\nThe interdiction of aggressive war was confirmed and broadened by the United Nations' Charter, which states in article 2, paragraph 4 that\nAll Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations. \nThe parties to any dispute, the continuance of which is likely to endanger the maintenance of international peace and security, shall, first of all, seek a solution by negotiation, enquiry, mediation, conciliation, arbitration, judicial settlement, resort to regional agencies or arrangements, or other peaceful means of their own choice.\n\nThe Security Council shall, when it deems necessary, call upon the parties to settle their dispute by such means. \nThe Security Council shall determine the existence of any threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression and shall make recommendations, or decide what measures shall be taken in accordance with Articles 41 and 42, to maintain or restore international peace and security.\nNothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. Measures taken by Members in the exercise of this right of self-defence shall be immediately reported to the Security Council and shall not in any way affect the authority and responsibility of the Security Council under the present Charter to take at any time such action as it deems necessary in order to maintain or restore international peace and security.\n\nThe U.S. Army's \"Law of Land Warfare\" (Field Manual 27-10) states:\n\n498. Crimes Under International Law\n\nAny person, whether a member of the armed forces or a civilian, who commits an act which constitutes a crime under international law is responsible therefore and liable to punishment. Such offenses in connection with war comprise:\n\nAlthough this manual recognizes the criminal responsibility of individuals for those offenses which may comprise any of the foregoing types of crimes, members of the armed forces will normally be concerned, only with those offenses constituting \"war crimes.\" (emphasis added)\n\nVietnam's Criminal Code calls this crime as the crime of \"Undermining peace, provoking aggressive wars\".\nChapter XXIV: CRIMES OF UNDERMINING PEACE, AGAINST HUMANITY AND WAR CRIMES\n\n"}
{"id": "491622", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=491622", "title": "Damasio's theory of consciousness", "text": "Damasio's theory of consciousness\n\nDeveloped in his (1999) book, 'The Feeling of What Happens', Antonio Damasio's three layered theory of consciousness is based on a hierarchy of stages, with each stage building upon the last. The most basic representation of the organism is referred to as the Protoself, next is Core Consciousness, and finally, Extended Consciousness. Damasio, who is an internationally recognized leader in neuroscience, was educated at the University of Lisbon and currently directs the University of Southern California Brain and Creativity Institute. Damasio's approach to explaining the development of consciousness relies on three notions: emotion, feeling, and feeling a feeling. Emotions are a collection of unconscious neural responses to qualia. These complex reactions to stimuli cause observable external changes in the organism. A feeling arises when the organism becomes aware of the changes it is experiencing as a result of external or internal stimuli.\n\nOur most basic representation of self, as Damasio dubs it, is the Protoself. A non conscious state, this level of self is shared by many species. This is the most basic level of awareness signified by a collection of neural patterns that are representative of the body's internal state. The function of this 'self' is to constantly detect and record, moment by moment, the internal physical changes that affect the homeostasis of the organism. Protoself does not represent a traditional sense of self, rather, it is a pre-conscious state, which provides a reference for the core self and autobiographical self to build from. As Damasio puts it, \"Protoself is a coherent collection of neural patterns, which map moment-by-moment the state of the physical structure of the organism\" (Damasio 1999).\n\nMultiple brain areas are required for the Protoself to function. Namely, the hypothalamus, which controls the general homeostasis of the organism, the brain stem, whose nuclei map body signals, and the insular cortex whose function is linked to emotion. These brain areas work together to keep up with the constant process of collecting neural patterns to map the current status of the body’s responses to environmental changes. The Protoself does not require language in order to function, moreover it is a direct report of one’s experience.\n\nIn this state, emotion begins to manifest itself as second-order neural patterns located in subcortical areas of the brain. Emotion acts as a neural object, from which a physical reaction can be drawn. This reaction causes the organism to become aware of the changes that are affecting it. From this realization, springs Damasio’s notion of “feeling”. This occurs when the patterns contributing to emotion manifest as mental images, or brain movies. When the body is modified by these neural objects, the second layer of self emerges. This is known as core consciousness.\n\nSufficiently more evolved is the second layer of Damasio’s theory, Core Consciousness. This emergent process occurs when an organism becomes consciously aware of feelings associated with changes occurring to its internal bodily state; it is able to recognize that his thoughts are his own, and that they are formulated in his own perspective. It develops a momentary sense of self, as the brain continuously builds representative images, based on communications received from the Protoself. This level of consciousness is not exclusive to human beings and remains consistent and stable throughout the lifetime of the organism The image is a result of mental patterns which are caused by an interaction with internal or external stimulus. A relationship is established, between the organism and the object it is observing as the brain continuously creates images to represent the organism’s experience of qualia.\n\nDamasio’s definition of emotion is that of an unconscious reaction to any internal or external stimulus which activates neural patterns in the brain. ‘Feeling’ emerges as a still unconscious state which simply senses the changes affecting the Protoself due to the emotional state. These patterns develop into mental images, which then float into the organism’s awareness. Put simply, consciousness is the feeling of knowing a feeling. When the organism becomes aware of the feeling that its bodily state (Protoself) is being affected by its experiences, or response to emotion, Core Consciousness is born. The brain continues to present nonverbal narrative sequence of images in the mind of the organism, based on its relationship to objects. An object in this context can be anything from a person, to a melody, to a neural image. Core consciousness is concerned only with the present moment, here and now. It does not require language or memory, nor can it reflect on past experiences or project itself into the future.\n\nWhen consciousness moves beyond the here and now, Damasio’s third and final layer emerges as Extended Consciousness. This level could not exist without its predecessors, and, unlike them, requires a vast use of conventional memory. Therefore, an injury to a person’s memory center can cause damage to their extended consciousness, without hurting the other layers. The autobiographical self draws on memory of past experiences which involves use of higher thought. This autobiographical layer of self is developed gradually over time. Working memory is necessary for an extensive display of items to be recalled and referenced. Linguistic areas of the brain are activated to enhance the organism's experience, however, contrary to the language of thought hypothesis, language is not necessarily required.\n"}
{"id": "13789106", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13789106", "title": "Doves as symbols", "text": "Doves as symbols\n\nDoves, usually white in color, are used in a lot of settings as symbols of love, peace or as messengers. Doves appear in the symbolism of Judaism, Christianity and Paganism, and of both military and pacifist groups.\n\nIn ancient Mesopotamia, doves were prominent animal symbols of Inanna-Ishtar, the goddess of love, sexuality, and war. Doves are shown on cultic objects associated with Inanna as early as the beginning of the third millennium BC. Lead dove figurines were discovered in the temple of Ishtar at Aššur, dating to the thirteenth century BC, and a painted fresco from Mari, Syria shows a giant dove emerging from a palm tree in the temple of Ishtar, indicating that the goddess herself was sometimes believed to take the form of a dove. In the \"Epic of Gilgamesh\", Utnapishtim releases a dove and a raven to find land; the dove merely circles and returns. Only then does Utnapishtim send forth the raven, which does not return, and Utnapishtim concludes the raven has found land.\n\nIn the ancient Levant, doves were used as symbols for the Canaanite mother goddess Asherah. The ancient Greek word for \"dove\" was \"peristerá\", which may be derived from the Semitic phrase \"peraḥ Ištar\", meaning \"bird of Ishtar\". In classical antiquity, doves were sacred to the Greek goddess Aphrodite, who absorbed this association with doves from Inanna-Ishtar. Aphrodite frequently appears with doves in ancient Greek pottery. The temple of Aphrodite Pandemos on the southwest slope of the Athenian Acropolis was decorated with relief sculptures of doves with knotted fillets in their beaks and votive offerings of small, white, marble doves were discovered in the temple of Aphrodite at Daphni. During Aphrodite's main festival, the Aphrodisia, her altars would be purified with the blood of a sacrificed dove. Aphrodite's associations with doves influenced the Roman goddesses Venus and Fortuna, causing them to become associated with doves as well. \n\nIn the Japanese mythology, doves is Hachiman's familiar spirit. Hachiman is the syncretic divinity of archery and war incorporating elements from both Shinto and Buddhism.\n\nAccording to the biblical story (Genesis 8:11), a dove was released by Noah after the flood in order to find land; it came back carrying a freshly plucked olive leaf (Hebrew: עלה זית \"alay zayit\"), a sign of life after the Flood and of God's bringing Noah, his family and the animals to land. Rabbinic literature interpreted the olive leaf as \"the young shoots of the Land of Israel\" or the dove's preference for bitter food in God's service, rather than sweet food in the service of men.\n\nThe Talmud compares the spirit of God to a dove that hovers over the face of the waters.\n\nIn post-biblical Judaism, souls are envisioned as bird-like (Bahir 119), a concept that may be derived from the Biblical notion that dead spirits \"chirp\" (Isa. 29:4). The Guf, or Treasury of Souls, is sometimes described as a columbarium, a dove cote. This connects it to a related legend: the \"Palace of the Bird's Nest\", the dwelling place of the Messiah's soul until his advent (Zohar II: 8a–9a). The Vilna Gaon explicitly declares that a dove is a symbol of the human soul (Commentary to Jonah, 1). The dove is also a symbol of the people Israel (Song of Songs Rabbah 2:14), an image frequently repeated in Midrash.\n\nThe symbolism of the dove in Christianity is first found in the Old Testament Book of Genesis in the story of Noah’s Ark, “And the dove came in to him at eventide; and, lo, in her mouth an olive-leaf plucked off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.” And, also, in the New Testament Gospels of Matthew and Luke, both passages describe after the baptism of Jesus, respectively, as follows, “And Jesus when he was baptized, went up straightway from the water: and lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming upon him.” and, “And the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form like a dove. And a voice came from heaven: “You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well pleased.” \n\nThe use of a dove and olive branch as a symbol of peace originated with the early Christians, who portrayed the act of baptism accompanied by a dove holding an olive branch in its beak and also used the image on their sepulchres. \n\nChristians derived the symbol of the dove and olive branch from Greek thought, including its use of the symbol of the olive branch, and the story of Noah and the Flood. Although Jews never used the dove as a symbol of peace, it acquired that meaning among early Christians, confirmed by St Augustine of Hippo in his book \"On Christian Doctrine\" and became well established.\n\nIn Christian Iconography, a dove also symbolizes the Holy Spirit, in reference to Matthew 3:16 and Luke 3:22 where the Holy Spirit is compared to a dove at the Baptism of Jesus.\n\nThe early Christians in Rome incorporated into their funerary art the image of a dove carrying an olive branch, often accompanied by the word \"Peace\". It seems that they derived this image from the simile in the Gospels, combining it with the symbol of the olive branch, which had been used to represent peace by the Greeks and Romans. The dove and olive branch also appeared in Christian images of Noah's ark. The fourth century Vulgate translated the Hebrew \"alay zayit\" (leaf of olive) in Genesis 8:11 as Latin \"ramum olivae\" (branch of olive). By the fifth century, Augustine of Hippo wrote in \"On Christian Doctrine\" that \"perpetual peace is indicated by the olive branch (\"oleae ramusculo\") which the dove brought with it when it returned to the ark\".\n\nIn the earliest Christian art, the dove represented the peace of the soul rather than civil peace, but from the third century it began to appear in depictions of conflict in the Old Testament, such as Noah and the Ark, and in the Apocrypha, such as Daniel and the lions, the three young men in the furnace, and Susannah and the Elders.\n\nBefore the Peace of Constantine (313 AD), in which Rome ceased its persecution of Christians following Constantine's conversion, Noah was normally shown in an attitude of prayer, a dove with an olive branch flying toward him or alighting on his outstretched hand. According to Graydon Snyder, \"The Noah story afforded the early Christian community an opportunity to express piety and peace in a vessel that withstood the threatening environment\" of Roman persecution. According to Ludwig Budde and Pierre Prigent, the dove referred to the descending of the Holy Spirit rather than the peace associated with Noah. After the Peace of Constantine, when persecution ceased, Noah appeared less frequently in Christian art.\n\nMedieval illuminated manuscripts, such as the Holkham Bible, showed the dove returning to Noah with a branch. Wycliffe's Bible, which translated the Vulgate into English in the 14th century, uses \"a braunche of olyue tre with greene leeuys\" (\"a branch of olive tree with green leaves\") in Gen. 8:11. In the Middle Ages, some Jewish illuminated manuscripts also showed Noah's dove with an olive branch, for example, the Golden Haggadah (about 1420).\n\nDoves are often associated with the concept of peace and pacifism. They often appear in political cartoons, on banners and signs at events promoting peace (such as the Olympic Games, at various anti-war/anti-violence protests, etc.), and in pacifist literature. A person who is a pacifist is sometimes referred to as a dove (similarly, in American politics, a person who advocates the use of military resources as opposed to diplomacy can be referred to as a hawk). Picasso's lithograph, \"La Colombe\" (The Dove), a traditional, realistic picture of a pigeon, without an olive branch, was chosen as the emblem for the World Peace Council in Paris in April 1949. The dove became a symbol for the peace movement and the ideals of the Communist Party and was used in Communist demonstrations of the period. At the 1950 World Peace Congress in Sheffield, Picasso said that his father had taught him to paint doves, concluding, \"I stand for life against death; I stand for peace against war.\" At the 1952 World Peace Congress in Berlin, Picasso's \"Dove\" was depicted in a banner above the stage. Anti-communists had their own take on the peace dove: the group Paix et Liberté distributed posters titled \"La colombe qui fait BOUM\" (the dove that goes BOOM), showing the peace dove metamorphosing into a Soviet tank.\nThe rock dove is, due to its relation to the homing pigeon and thus communications, the main image in the crest of the Tactical Communications Wing, a body within the Royal Air Force. Below the crest is the wing's motto, \"Ubique Loquimur\" or \"We Speak Everywhere\".\n"}

The national anthem of Bhutan, Druk tsendhen, translates into English as \"Kingdom of Druk\".\n\nThe druk (also known as a \"duk\" or \"dug\") was adopted as an emblem by the Drukpa Lineage, which originated in Tibet and spread to Bhutan. According to traditional accounts, when the sect's founder, Tsangpa Gyare, 1st Gyalwang Drukpa, began to build Ralung Monastery, there was a violent storm. Thunder, or the \"Cloud-Voice,\" is seen as the roar of the dragon. Deciding that this was an omen, he named the monastery Drug-Ralung, adding the word \"thunder dragon\" to the name. The disciples at the monastery were known as Drugpa, or \"Those of the Thunder.\" As of the 1900s, the Grand Lama of Bhutan wore a hat with thunder dragons on it to signify the origins of the sect.

{"id": "7681896", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7681896", "title": "Gerard Bolland", "text": "Gerard Bolland\n\nGerardus Johannes Petrus Josephus Bolland (9 June 1854, Groningen – 11 February 1922, Leiden), also known as G.J.P.J. Bolland, was a Dutch autodidact (self-taught man), linguist, philosopher, biblical scholar, and lecturer. An excellent orator, he gave extremely well attended public lectures in Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, Utrecht, Delft, Groningen, Nijmegen and Belgium.\n\nHe became an expert in German idealism, being especially interested in the works of Eduard von Hartmann and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. He began researching the formation of Christianity in 1891, and was extremely literate in religious history. He was associated with the Dutch radical school.\n\nHe effected a revival in Hegelianism in the Netherlands around 1900 by arranging a new edition of Hegel’s works, and stimulating a renewal of interest in philosophy in the Netherlands. He had a quirky style in his use of the Dutch language causing linguist J.A. Dèr Mouw, among others, to criticise him sharply.\n\nBolland was born into a simple Catholic family in Groningen. He reached the position of professor of philosophy at the University of Leiden in 1896 after a career as a teacher in Katwijk aan Zee and as a teacher of English and German in Batavia (Dutch East-Indies).\n\nHe published \"Hegel: An Historical Investigation\" (\"Hegel. Eene Historische Studie\") in 1898, and a year later he started publishing Hegel’s most important works. In 1904 he published \"Pure Reason. A book for the Friends of Wisdom\" (\"Zuivere Rede. Een boek voor vrienden der wijsheid\").\n\nBolland had a \"charismatic and eccentric personality, (was) harshly critical to various social groups and institutions, thus making lots of decided enemies, but also adorers.\". An antidemocratic conservative, he harboured a virulent hatred of Jews, Freemasons and the working class. His statue was removed from the House of Representatives in 2003 because of a complaint by MP Van Raak about Bolland's antisemitism. Bolland described himself as “mystic and a “desperate sceptical agnostic”. Although critical of Christianity and clericalism he was a religious man. After his death, Hegelians of the right formed the Bolland Association (\"Bolland Genootschap\").\n\nBolland was an advocate of the Christ myth theory. He continued Bruno Bauer's \"concepts about Philo, the Caesars, and their influence\" on the development of Christianity. He believed that the basis for Christianity developed among strongly syncretised, Hellenized Jews in Alexandria and Judeophile Greeks in the early Common Era. These early beliefs revolved around a mythical Chrestos figure, and were not connected to a nationalistic Messiah figure. Among the influences in these circles were Gnosticism and Hermeticism. Philo’s writings were also a step in this development, especially the concept of the Logos.\n\nHe believed the development of Christianity took place during the first century in the decades after the Second Temple’s fall when the mythic Chrestos figure became transformed into the legendary Jesus. Bolland states that the transformed Chrestos received the name of Moses’ successor, Joshua the son of Nun, who became \"leader of the people of Israel, as Moses failed to complete the task to guide the people into the promised land\".\n\nAccording to Bolland, the Gospel of Matthew is the oldest, followed by Luke’s and then Mark’s.\n\n"}

She lived during the reign of King Jungjong. She was noted for her exceptional beauty, charming quick wit, extraordinary intellect, and her assertive and independent nature. She has become an almost myth-like figure in modern Korea, inspiring novels, operas, films, and television series.\n\nOnly a handful of sijo (Korean verse form) and geomungo pieces exist today. They show skilled craftsmanship of words and of musical arrangement. Hwang's sijo often describe the beauty and sites of Gaeseong (such as the palace of Manwoldae and the Pakyon Falls in the Ahobiryong Mountains), the personal tragedy of her lost loves and responses to famous classic Chinese poems and literature (the majority of them reflecting on lost love).\n\nHwang appears to have been of noble birth. Her sijo are considered the most beautiful ever written. In the following poem, the term Hwang uses for her beloved (어론님) has two meanings, alluding to both her sweetheart and a person who has been frozen by the winter cold. The English phrase “frozen love” may help to illustrate this double entendre in translation.\nIn this next poem, “Full Moon” is a play on Hwang’s pen name, Myeongwol (literally, “Bright Moon”; 명월 ). The poem was written to a man famed\nfor his virtue, Byok Kye Su, whom Hwang infamously seduced. “Green water” is a pun on Byok’s name (벽계수 碧溪水).\nIn the late 20th century, Hwang Jini's story began to attract attention from both sides of the Korean divide and feature in a variety of novels, operas, films and television series. Novelizations of her life include a 2002 treatment by North Korean writer Hong Sok-jung (which became the first North Korean novel to win a literary award, the Manhae Prize, in the South) and a 2004 bestseller by South Korean writer Jeon Gyeong-rin.\n\n\n\n"}

He is also the director of Sounding-Light Publishing, which was founded in 2006. Vallyon retired in late 2017.\nVallyon was born in Budapest, Hungary, and was raised by his parents among extreme poverty and suffering. At the time, Europe was just recovering from World War II, and he was surrounded by that devastation.\nVallyon had his first mystical experience at the age of three. It was very dark outside, and he describes the memory as suddenly going \"out of my body and into a very profound state of cosmic realization...the whole universe was vibrating like a heavenly choir.\"\nIn the midst of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, Vallyon made the dangerous choice to leave the country; crossing the border at the time usually meant imprisonment or death. At the age of sixteen, he emigrated to New Zealand as a refugee. \nAfter immersing himself in several spiritual movements, Vallyon founded the Foundation for Higher Learning, where he teaches the Spiritual Principles and the Divine Laws of Life to Humanity. His methods stem from different forms of eastern and western spirituality. His teaching is universal, not biased towards any particular religion or tradition, yet embraces all traditions and points beyond them all to the One Truth, One Life, One Reality. \nTwo of Vallyon’s books were among only 40 titles chosen to represent New Zealand as guest of honour at the Frankfurt Book Fair, which is the world’s largest book fair.\n\nIn 2008, Vallyon published his most notable book collection so far, \"Heavens and Hells of the Mind\". This four-book set received praise from various critics, who called the books \"fascinating\" and Vallyon a \"visionary\". \nAdditionally in 2008, Vallyon won a major literature prize at the annual nationwide Ashton Wylie Charitable Trust Unpublished Manuscript and Book Awards. These awards recognize excellence in the mind, body, and spirit genres of writing. The judges were highly impressed with Vallyon’s work on his book \"Heavens and Hells of the Mind\", calling it \"a remarkable and exhaustive work on human consciousness and the wisdom of the ages.\"\nSince 1980, Vallyon has taught the Ageless Wisdom through his writings, workshops, and retreats conducted around the world. Since 2008, Vallyon was invited and has been a member of the New Zealand Society of Authors.\nVallyon owns the Waitetuna Retreat Center in Raglan, New Zealand, which is rented out and used by the Foundation for Higher Learning school.\n\nIn 1998, Vallyon was tried and convicted in New Zealand by Judge R.P. Wolff for sexually molesting a child. Vallyon was convicted of four representative counts of indecent assault and one count of sexually violating the girl. He was sentenced to three years imprisonment. On 26 February 2017 The Sunday Star Times, a subsidiary of Fairfax Media, released an investigative report exposing Vallyon's crimes. \n\nIn December 2017, after 30 years of teaching at retreats, Vallyon retired at the age of 77.\n\n"}

He is counted among the founders of the Ricardian school of economics. His son, John Stuart Mill, was also a noted philosopher of liberalism, utilitarianism and the civilizing mission of the British Empire.\n\nAlthough he never set foot in India at any time in his life, James Mill took upon himself the task of writing the monumental \"History of British India\", a classic of colonial self-congratulation which contains a complete denunciation and rejection of Indian culture and civilisation and which both exhorts and extolls the civilizing mission of the British in the subcontinent. He was the first writer to divide Indian history into three parts: Hindu, Muslim and British, a classification which has proved surpassingly influential in the field of Indian historical studies, but which is seen in recent decades as being deeply problematic.\n\nJames Milne, later known as James Mill, was born at Northwater Bridge, in the parish of Logie Pert, Angus, Scotland, the son of James Milne, a shoemaker and small farmer. His mother, Isabel Fenton, of a family that had suffered from connection with the Stuart rising, resolved that he should receive a first-rate education, and sent him first to the parish school and then to the Montrose Academy, where he remained until the unusual age of seventeen and a half. He then entered the University of Edinburgh, where he distinguished himself as a Greek scholar.\n\nIn October 1789, he was ordained as a minister of the Church of Scotland, but met with little success. According to John Stuart Mill's \"Autobiography\", his father though \"educated in the creed of Scotch Presbyterianism, had by his own studies and reflections been early led to reject not only the belief in Revelation but the foundations of what is commonly called Natural Religion.\" From 1790 to 1802, in addition to holding various tutorships, he occupied himself with historical and philosophical studies. Finding little prospect of a career in Scotland, in 1802 he went to London, England, in company with Sir John Stuart of Fettercairn, then member of parliament for Kincardineshire, and devoted himself to literary work. From 1803 to 1806, he was editor of an ambitious periodical called the \"Literary Journal\", which professed to give a summary view of all the leading departments of human knowledge. During this time he also edited the \"St James's Chronicle\", belonging to the same proprietor. In 1804, he wrote a pamphlet on the corn trade, arguing against a bounty on the exportation of grain. In 1805, he published a translation (with notes and quotations) of \"An Essay on the Spirit and Influence of the Reformation of Luther\", a C.F. Villers's work on the Reformation, an attack on the alleged vices of the papal system. About the end of this year he began his \"The History of British India\", which he took twelve years to complete, instead of three or four, as had been expected.\n\nIn that year he also married Harriet Burrow, whose mother, a widow, kept what was then known as an establishment for lunatics in Hoxton. He then took a house in Pentonville, where his eldest son, John Stuart Mill, was born in 1806.\nIn 1808, he became acquainted with Jeremy Bentham, and was for many years his chief companion and ally. He adopted Bentham's principles in their entirety, and determined to devote all his energies to bringing them before the world. Between 1806 and 1818, he wrote for the \"Anti-Jacobin Review\", the \"British Review\" and \"The Eclectic Review\"; but there is no means of tracing his contributions. In 1808, he began to write for the Edinburgh Review, to which he contributed steadily till 1813, his first known article being \"Money and Exchange.\" He also wrote on Spanish America, China, Francisco de Miranda, the East India Company, and the Liberty of the Press. In the \"Annual Review\" for 1808 two articles of his are traced—a \"Review of Fox's History\", and an article on \"Bentham's Law Reforms\", probably his first published notice of Bentham. In 1811 he co-operated with William Allen (1770–1843), a Quaker and chemist, in a periodical called the \"Philanthropist\". He contributed largely to every issue – his principal topics being Education, Freedom of the Press, and Prison Discipline (under which he expounded Bentham's Panopticon). He made powerful onslaughts on the Church in connection with the Bell and Lancaster controversy, and took a part in the discussions that led to the foundation of the University of London in 1825. In 1814 he wrote a number of articles, containing an exposition of utilitarianism, for the supplement to the fifth edition of the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\", the most important being those on \"Jurisprudence\", \"Prisons\", \"Government\" and \"Law of Nations\".\n\nIn 1818, \"The History of British India\" was published, and obtained a great and immediate success. It brought about a change in the author's fortunes. The year following he was appointed an official in the India House, in the important department of the examiner of Indian correspondence. He gradually rose in ranks until he was appointed, in 1830, head of the office, with a salary of £1900, raised in 1836 to £2000. His great work, the \"Elements of Political Economy\", appeared in 1821 (3rd and revised ed. 1825).\n\nFrom 1824 to 1826, Mill contributed to the \"Westminster Review\", started as the organ of his party, a number of articles in which he attacked the \"Edinburgh\" and \"Quarterly\" Reviews and ecclesiastical establishments. In 1829 appeared the \"Analysis of the Phenomena of the Human Mind\". From 1831 to 1833, Mill was largely occupied in the defence of the East India Company, during the controversy attending the renewal of its charter, he being in virtue of his office the spokesman of the court of directors. For the \"London Review\", founded by Sir William Molesworth in 1834, he wrote a notable article entitled \"The Church and its Reform\", which was much too sceptical for the time, and injured the \"Review\". Mill, himself was an atheist. His last published book was the \"Fragment on Mackintosh\" (1835).\n\nMill preferred to take a more theoretical approach to social subjects than the empirical one common at the time. His best known literary work is his \"History of British India\", in which he describes the acquisition of the Indian Empire by England and later the United Kingdom. He also brings political theory to bear on the delineation of the Hindu civilization, and subjects the conduct of the actors in the successive stages of the conquest and administration of India to severe criticism. The work itself, and the author's official connection with India for the last seventeen years of his life, effected a complete change in the whole system of governance in the country. Mill never visited the Indian colony, relying solely on documentary material and archival records in compiling his work. This fact has led to severe criticism of Mill's \"History of India\" by notable economist Amartya Sen.\n\nAccording to Thomas Trautmann, \"James Mill's highly influential History of British India (1817) – most particularly the long essay 'Of the Hindus' comprising ten chapters – is the single most important source of British Indophobia and hostility to Orientalism\". In the chapter titled General Reflections in \"Of the Hindus\", Mill wrote \"under the glosing exterior of the Hindu, lies a general disposition to deceit and perfidy\". According to Mill, \"the same insincerity, mendacity, and perfidy; the same indifference to the feelings of others; the same prostitution and venality\" were the conspicuous characteristics of both the Hindoos and the Muslims. The Muslims, however, were perfuse, when possessed of wealth, and devoted to pleasure; the Hindoos almost always penurious and ascetic; and \"in truth, the Hindoo like the eunuch, excels in the qualities of a slave\". Furthermore, similar to the Chinese, the Hindoos were \"dissembling, treacherous, mendacious, to an excess which surpasses even the usual measure of uncultivated society\". Both the Chinese and the Hindoos were \"disposed to excessive exaggeration with regard to everything relating to themselves\". Both were \"cowardly and unfeeling\". Both were \"in the highest degree conceited of themselves, and full of affected contempt for others\". And, above all, both were \"in physical sense, disgustingly unclean in their persons and houses\".\n\nMill also played a great part in British politics, and was a dominant figure in the establishment of what was called \"philosophic radicalism\". His writings on government and his personal influence among the Liberal politicians of his time determined the change of view from the French Revolution theories of the rights of man and the absolute equality of men to the claiming of securities for good government through a wide extension of the franchise. It was under this banner that the Reform Bill was fought and won. His \"Elements of Political Economy\" followed up the views of his friend David Ricardo. By 1911, the Encyclopædia Britannica described it as being of mainly historical interest, \"an accurate summary of views that are now largely discarded\". Among the more important of its theses are:\n\nBy his \"Analysis of the Phenomena of the Human Mind\" and his \"Fragment on Mackintosh\" Mill acquired a position in the history of psychology and ethics. He took up the problems of mind very much after the fashion of the Scottish Enlightenment, as then represented by Thomas Reid, Dugald Stewart and Thomas Brown, but made a new start, due in part to David Hartley, and still more to his own independent thinking. He carried out the principle of association into the analysis of the complex emotional states, as the affections, the aesthetic emotions and the moral sentiment, all which he endeavoured to resolve into pleasurable and painful sensations. But the salient merit of the \"Analysis\" is the constant endeavour after precise definition of terms and clear statement of doctrines. He had a great effect on Franz Brentano who discussed his work in his own empirical psychology. The \"Fragment on Mackintosh\" severely criticizes the alleged flimsiness and misrepresentations of Sir James Mackintosh's \"Dissertation on the Progress of Ethical Philosophy\" (1830), and discusses the foundations of ethics from the author's utilitarian point of view.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Since the early 1970s he has devoted both his clinical work and his research to applying and developing Girard's theories in the fields of psychiatry, psychology, and psychopathology. He is the author of several books (see below), in which he developed clinical points of view around mimetic theory of desire.\n\nHe is currently the President of the Association of Doctors of the American Hospital of Paris, as well as an honorary member of the Association Recherches Mimétiques, whose goal is to structure research linked to René Girard's mimetic theory and to make the theory more widely known in French-speaking countries.\n\nJean-Michel Oughourlian is Ambassador of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta to the Republic of Armenia. He is involved in the fight against poverty, exclusion, and sickness through the defense of the physical, psychological, and spiritual integrity of individuals.\nJean-Michel Oughourlian was born on 20 August 1940 in Beirut, Lebanon, to an Armenian father who fled the 1915-1922 genocide and a Colombian mother. He arrived in France at the age of ten.\n\nHis university studies covered multiple disciplines:\n\nJean-Michel Oughourlian's teaching activities include:\n\nHis clinical career unfolded over the following stages:\n\nHis work as a writer and philosopher includes:\n\n\nVery early on, Jean-Michel Oughourlian's clinical research led him to become interested in the work of Milton Erickson, Jay Haley, and Ernset Rossi, and the Phoenix Group, as well as in the work of Paul Watzlawick and the Palo Alto School. He then became interested in the anthropology of mimetic desire developed by René Girard and used it to enrich his own work in psychiatry. \nIn all of these disciplines he has sought to track down the motivations of human behavior and the mechanisms of which men and women are unwittingly the plaything. His contribution to psychological and psychiatric theory consists in questioning the Freudian primacy of the unconscious and affirming that \"the unconscious is the other\", that is to say, the concrete other person, whose desire serves as a model for our desires, making us into conscious apprentices or blinded marionettes.\n\nIn \"The Puppet of Desire\", he explains the story of the Loudon possessions, which he deciphers with the help of the mimetic theory, showing that at bottom it is the mother superior of the convent, infatuated with a young prelate, who draws the other sisters along with her by transmitting her Madame Bovary-like desire to them, plunging all of them into a generalized hysteria. Neuroses and even psychoses are interpreted as being so many strategies of the self for hiding the truth about the reality of desire, whose fundamental alterity people refuse to recognize.\n\n\"The clinical manifestation of mimetic desire is rivalry\", says Oughourlian. Insofar as imitation is, of all human weaknesses, the one that people have the most trouble admitting, it never presents itself as such. The patient accuses his model of wanting to steal his job, wife, or identity, betraying against the grain the surreptitious alterity that moves through him. Pulling oneself out of the rivalrous impasse implies becoming fully conscious of one's proper dependency and admitting one's debt toward the other's desire. This is a difficult undertaking, which requires on the psychotherapist's part an acute understanding of psychology and psychopolitics and on the patient's part the gradual overcoming of his pride.\n\nAppreciated in the United States by psychologists and psychiatrists of the ¨relational¨ school, Jean-Michel Oughourlian has participated actively since it was founded in the Colloquium on Violence and Religion (COVR), an association of researchers who are interested in René Girard's mimetic theory of founding violence and the scapegoat mechanism. He also has ties with the Association Recherches Mimétiques (ARM), for which he has led seminars. He participated in a work group organized by Dr. Scott Garrels of the Fuller School of Psychology (Pasadena, California) on imitation and the most recent discoveries in developmental psychology and neuroscience (mirror neurons). The group, which included Vittorio Gallese and Andre Meltzoff, met at Stanford University and in Paris at the Ecole Normale Supérieure (ENS) Paris rue d´Ulm.\n\nThis section only lists book-length publications that wrote or edited.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn chronological order.\n\n"}

The work helped start the liberalism-communitarianism debate that dominated Anglo-American political philosophy in the 1980s.\n\nSandel criticizes the social democratic liberals John Rawls and Ronald Dworkin, arguing that their views rest on anti-liberal collectivist foundations and are incompatible with the elements of liberal individualism they espouse. He offers a communitarian critique of liberalism, arguing that individuals are constituted by their communities and the obligations that follow from being part of them. Sandel discusses and criticizes Rawls' \"A Theory of Justice\" (1971), examining Rawls' claim for the primacy of justice. Partly inspired by Robert Nozick's \"Anarchy, State, and Utopia\" (1974), Sandel argues that Rawls bases his political philosophy on an untenable metaphysics of the self. In his view, Rawls' philosophy shares the metaphysical assumptions of Kantian ethics, in which a purely noumenal self that is detached from all empirical constraints somehow retains motives that enable it to make choices.\n\nThe philosopher Will Kymlicka wrote that \"Liberalism and the Limits of Justice\" is Sandel's best-known book, and helped start the liberalism-communitarianism debate that dominated Anglo-American political philosophy in the 1980s.

{"id": "44551432", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44551432", "title": "Manuel Polo y Peyrolón", "text": "Manuel Polo y Peyrolón\n\nManuel Polo y Peyrolón (1846 – 1918) was a Spanish novelist, philosopher, academic and a Carlist politician.\n\nManuel Polo y Peyrolón was born in Cañete, a village on the Western slopes of Montes Universales, a southern ridge of Sistema Ibérico. Located in the Castillan Province of Cuenca, the area bordered the regions of Aragón and Valencia and formed part of what was once known as Alto Maestrazgo. He was descendant to a petty bourgeoisie family. His father, Domingo Polo, originated from the Aragonese city of Belchite; during the First Carlist War he sided with the legitimists and served as a secretary of general José María Arévalo y Requeno. Following the Carlist defeat he had to abandon his job and settled in Cañete, practicing as a lawyer; by the end of his life Domingo entered an uspecified religious order and became a friar. Manuel's mother, María Peyrolón, was also Aragonese from Calomarde. Following her early death in 1853, Manuel and his younger brother were partially looked after by her sister Concepción. Spending most of his childhood and youth with relatives in Gea de Albarracín, he considered himself a turolense.\n\nManuel was brought up in a fervently Catholic ambience, politically strongly flavored by Carlism. He graduated in filosofia y letras from in Madrid and in derecho civil y canonico from Universidad de Valencia, guided by Miguel Vicente Almazán and obtaining later PhD laurels in philosophy. Following a brief and temporary episode as professor auxiliar of metafisica in Valencia in 1868-69, he returned to Aragón and successfully applied to Instituto de Segunda Enseñanza de Teruel, where he commenced teaching Psicología, Lógica y Ética in 1870. Manuel Polo y Peyrolón has never married and had no children.\n\nPolo's first literary work, \"Realidad poética de mis montañas\", appeared in 1873. Except that it was a collection of short stories instead of a novel, it revealed characteristics marking his later works: traditional themes, simple plot and clear educational purpose, with narration set in provincial milieu of Sierra de Albarracín, painted with attention to detail and with focus on local customs typical rather for an ethnographical study. All these features were developed in Polo's first novel, \"Los Mayos\" (1878), a rural love story intended as a praise of loyalty and fidelity and considered his best work, translated into Italian and German. The consecutive ones, \"Sacramento y concubinato\" (1884) and \"Quién mal anda, ¿cómo acaba?\" (1890) assumed a more militant tone, aimed against liberal and secular lifestyles. \"Pacorro\" (1905) confronted deeds of a young liberal with virtues of a young Carlist, cast against the background of a small town undergoing the turbulent period of 1868-1876. The last of Polo's major literary works, \"El guerrillero\" (1906), revealed more threads of an adventure story; set during Third Carlist War, it was heavily based on wartime recollections of his brother Florentino. Polo's shorter stories remain scaled down versions of his novels.\n\nAmong his contemporaries Polo was appreciated usually by those sharing similar traditional outlook, like Emilia Pardo Bazán and his friends Marcelinó Menéndez y Pelayo and José María de Pereda. A conservative literary review \"\" identified him as a brilliant follower of Fernán Caballero, classified his writings as \"novela de familia\" and hailed his prose as \"restauradora de la novela castellana en los tiempos modernos\". Noted for authenticity \"which does not disfigure reality\", his realism was appreciated as an antidote to naturalism – the trend he consciously opposed - and \"the venom of Zola\". By favourably disposed contemporaries he was put next to Fernán Caballero, de Pereda, , Julio Alarcón y Meléndez, Juan Valera and padre Coloma; critics dubbed him \"mamarracho literario\". \n\nLimited popularity of Polo's works hardly outlived their author. Even in the early 20th century he was only marginally mentioned by historians of Spanish literature; later on he went into oblivion, though was occasionally acknowledged in anthologies. Today he is missing even in fairly detailed studies written either by Spanish of foreign scholars, though mentioned by some dictionaries. He is usually situated in-between Romanticism and Realism, falling into the costumbrismo (or \"realismo costumbrista\") trend, also a good representative of \"novelas de tesis\". It is noted that his conventional, meager plots can hardly support the weight of nagging moralising objectives, especially given repetitive nature of his works. On the other hand, his novels are appreciated as inexhaustible sources of pefectly captured anecdotes and customs, few readers admitting even some charm. Apart from realism, he is credited for introducing new narrative techniques. He is also among the best-known authors contributing to Carlism in literature from the legitimist perspective.\n\nPolo taught Psicología, Lógica y Ética in the Teruel college for 9 years. Harassed for his pro-Carlist sympathies, he decided to leave Aragon. Following a successful application and selection process, he assumed the same chair in Instituto de Segunda Enseñanza in Valencia in 1879, where he kept teaching until the early 20th century. Member of Asociación de Catedráticos Numerarios, he was active in a number of Spanish and foreign scholarly institutions. His career was crowned in 1908, when he joined Real Academia de la Historia.\n\nDuring his Valencia tenure Polo wrote textbooks for students of philosophy: \"Elementos de psicología\" (1879), \"Elementos de lógica\" (1880), \"Elementos de Ética\" (1880); \"Elementos de Ética o Filosofía Moral\" (1882), \"Elementos de Filosofía Moral\" (1889), \"Lógica elemental\" ( 1902) and \"Ética elemental\" (1902), in use also in other scholarly centres across the country. He did not develop any original philosophical contribution himself; apart from works on history and general overviews, Polo is known for confronting some trends forming the liberal educational mindset, especially krausism and Darwinism. His stance is classified as neotomismo or neocatolicismo in philosophy and as regeneracionismo político-educativo in pedagogy.\n\nPolo's repudiation of krausism developed in course of the teaching career and stemmed from his growing interest in pedagogy and education in general. During last decades of the 19th century krausism became a philosophical powerhouse of liberal Spanish politics, represented mostly by Francisco Giner del Rios and Instituto Libre de Enseñanza. Its principal intellectual antagonist was Menendez y Pelayo. His friend Polo remained rather a proponent and did not construct an own anti-krausian theory, though his vehemence gained him the opinion of \"grande enemigo de la barbarie krausista\", especially as Spanish krausism, initially avoiding direct confrontation with the Church, later assumed a decisively challenging tone. Fiercely advocating Catholic integrity as a basis of public education, he nevertheless recognized the necessity of incorporating elements from the liberal mainstream; some scholars even maintain that Polo was completely integrated in the liberal system of education.\n\nAnother characteristic feature of Polo's outlook was his position towards evolutionism, though opinions on his stance differ. Some view it as an exemplary obscurantist Catholic reaction to scientific progress, dismissed as \"involucionismo, integrismo, tradicionalismo e ideario reaccionario\". Some suggest that his neotomism was not an abrupt rejection of advances produced by science, as Polo tried to work out a conciliatory approach. Though his stance on darwinism is portrayed as \"aggressive and intolerant attack\", others consider it in line with scientific standards of the era, systematic and posing questions - like those related to hereditary transmission or variability patterns – which remained unanswered until the 1920s. A detailed study suggests that Polo engaged in the discourse not so much to challenge the evolutionist theory, but to confront secularism which used it as a ram against the Spanish Catholic outlook.\n\nPolo commenced his political career in 1870, speaking at local meetings in Sierra de Albarracín. During the Third Carlist War he supported the insurgents as an , placed under police surveillance with most of his property embargoed. Facing restrictions and fearing for his life, he temporarily went into hiding; even following the Carlist defeat in 1876 he was longtime harassed at his workplace in Teruel.\n\nIn the 1880s he contributed to the legitimist cause mostly as a novelist, propagating Carlist virtues of his protagonists, and as a , lambasting liberal ideas disseminated by Jews and freemasonry. He lost in 1891 and 1893 campaigns to Cortes, finally victorious in 1896. In parliament he focused on education, opposing Liberal secularisation plans and promoting local languages in schools. Following defeats in successive elections he resumed parliamentary career as a senator in 1907, re-elected in 1910 and 1914. In the upper chamber he kept defending the position of Catholic church, especially during the crisis; he was sort of acknowledged as dangerous opponent by procedural gimmicks, employed by his adversaries. Lambasting the others for compromising party line, he himself engaged in secret talks with the conservatives.\n\nIn the 1890s Polo emerged among the Valencian Carlist chieftains. He forged friendly relations with marqués de Cerralbo and a number of other national leaders, gradually becoming a pivotal figure. Personally introduced to Carlos VII, in 1901 he was considered a candidate for his personal secretary. Revealing interest in the emerging workers’ question he contributed to Acta de Loredan, published official Carlist program and persuaded the claimant to re-organise the party, uniting military and civil command chain. Fully aware of the need to modernise Traditionalism, he appreciated the role of efficient party structures, building a dense network of circulos.\n\nIn 1904 Polo was nominated jefe of the Valencian branch. Personally intransigent, he was resented by other Levantine leaders, Manuel Simó Marín and Joaquín Llorens Fernandez. The conflict, fuelled by strong personalities, Polo's adamant leadership style and discrepancies between legitimistas and posibilistas, continuously plagued his Valencian tenure. Also on the national scene, bedeviled by intrigues among Carlist pundits, Polo's relations deteriorated, including those with Carlos VII and especially his wife Berthe de Rohan. He considered his resignation, handed to the new Carlist king Jaime III, a purely procedural gesture, and was shocked to see it accepted, though as a senator he was appointed to national executive, Junta Nacional Tradicionalista, in 1912.\n\nWith no close family, surrounded only by books, moths and butterflies, personally intolerant and sour up to acrimony, by the end of his life Polo grew into a misanthrope and passed into living memory as \"grumpy old man\". He became increasingly pessimistic as to the future of Traditionalism, highly skeptical of its political leaders and the claimant himself. At one point he considered himself close to Integrism, though until his death he remained loyal to the Carlist dynasty.\n\nCarlism and politics\n\n\nCatholicism and ethics\n\n\nLaw and science\n\n\nNovels and tales\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "17377397", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17377397", "title": "Mariology of the popes", "text": "Mariology of the popes\n\nThe Mariology of the popes is the theological study of the influence that the popes have had on the development, formulation and transformation of the Roman Catholic Church’s doctrines and devotions relating to the Blessed Virgin Mary.\n\nThe development of Mariology over the centuries has been influenced by a number of factors, among which papal directives have often represented key milestones. Examples of papal influences include new Marian feast days, prayers, acceptance of new Marian congregations, indulgences, support for Marian apparitions (e.g. Lourdes and Fatima) and declaration of Marian dogmas.\n\nA number of popes have made Marian themes a key part of their papacy, e.g. Leo XIII issued a record eleven encyclicals on the rosary, Pius XII invoked the first (and to date only) case of \"ex cathedra\" papal infallibility to establish a Marian dogma and John Paul II built his personal coat of arms around the Marian Cross.\n\nPopes have also highlighted the key Catholic Mariological theme of the link between the study of Mary and the development of a full Christology, e.g. as in Pius XII's \"Mystici corporis Christi\" and John Paul II's \"Redemptoris Mater\".\n\nPopes were highly important for the development of doctrine and the veneration of the Blessed Virgin. They made decisions not only in the area of Marian beliefs (Mariology) but also Marian practices and devotions. Popes promulgated Marian veneration and beliefs by authorizing: new Marian feast days, Marian prayers and initiatives, acceptance and support of Marian congregations, indulgences and special privileges, and support for Marian devotions.\n\nThe formal recognition of Marian apparitions (such as at Lourdes and Fatima) has also been influential. Since Pope Leo XIII, Popes have promoted Marian devotion through encyclicals, Apostolic Letters and with two dogmas (Immaculate Conception and Assumption), the promulgation of Marian years (Pius XII, John Paul II), visits to Marian shrines (Benedict XVI in 2007) and by actively supporting the fathers of Vatican II as they highlighted the importance of Marian veneration (Pope John XXIII and Paul VI) in \"Lumen gentium\".\n\nPopular views like the Assumption and the Immaculate Conception developed into Papal teaching over time. Popes have also limited and cautioned against some devotional practices. In 1674 Pope Clement X (1670–1676) indexed books on Marian piety. After the Council of Trent, \"Marian fraternities\" were founded, fostering Marian piety, not all of which were approved. Not all Popes took the same view on Marian beliefs and devotions.\n\nTo Leo the Great, Mariology is determined by Christology. He defended the teaching that Christ has two natures, one divine and one human.\n\nPope Clement IV (1265–1268) created a poem on the seven joys of Mary, which in its form is considered an early version of the Franciscan rosary \n\nOn September 17, 1569 Pope Pius V issued the papal bull \"Consueverunt Romani Pontifices\" which substantially established the rosary's present configuration. Before the Battle of Lepanto in 1571 Pope Pius V requested to the people of Europe to pray the rosary. After the victory of the Holy League, he declared a commemorative feast that later became the Feast of Our Lady of the Rosary.\n\nPope Clement VIII (1592–1605) considered Marian piety the basis for Church reforms and issued the bull \"Dominici gregis\" (February 3, 1603) to condemn negations of the virginity of Mary. He promulgated Marian congregations and supported the rosary culture with 19 Papal bulls.\n\nPope Clement X (1670–1676) furthered Marian piety with additional indulgences and privileges to religious orders and cities to celebrate special Marian feasts. He opposed the Marian piety of Louis de Montfort (canonized by Pope Pius XII) with a bull published on December 15, 1673 and outlawed some manifestations of Marian devotions. Several bulls supported the frequent citing of the rosary.\n\nPope Clement XI (1700–1721) prepared the groundwork for the dogma of the Immaculate Conception. He permitted the title “Immaculate Conception” and instructed the Holy Office in 1712 not to persecute anyone invoking Mary using this title. The Feast of the Immaculate Conception, which existed only regionally, was prescribed for the whole Church. The Pope recommended the teachings and piety of Louis de Montfort and named him \"“Apostolic Missionary of France”\" On October 3, 1716, Clement XI extended the feast of Our Lady of the Rosary to the Universal Church.\n\nPope Benedict XIII (1724–1730) issued several indulgences in support of the rosary prayer, rosary processions and for praying the rosary on 15 \"“Marian Tuesdays”.\" He outlawed the Serafine rosary in 1727 and extended the feasts of Our Lady of Seven Sorrows and Our Lady of Mount Carmel to the whole Church.\n\nPope Clement XII (1758–1769) banned all Marian litanies except the Litany of Loreto. In 1770 he permitted Spain to have the Immaculata as the main patron of the country and in 1767, he granted Spain the privilege of adding Mater Immaculata to the litany.\n\nPope Benedict XIV wrote books about the feast days of Christ and Mary - \"De festis Christi at BMV\" He supported the Marian congregations for the Sodality of Our Lady with the bull \"Gloriosae Dominae\", issued on September 27, 1748, and increased indulgences for all who pray the rosary.\n\nPope Clement XIV (1769–1775) had to deal with popular unrest in Southern Italy regarding celebrations and processions of the Immaculate Conception. He granted a privilege to the Franciscans in Palermo, that only they may celebrate the feast of the Immaculate Conception. Later he extended the privilege to other orders for private masses only. He outlawed the brotherhood of the Immaculate Conception but confirmed a knightly order with the same name. Allegedly, he had promised the King of Spain to dogmatize the IC.\n\nThe Mariology of Pope Pius IX (1846–1878) represents a significant development of Roman Catholic theology, since it led to the promulgation of the dogma of the Immaculate Conception. Catholic theology in the 19th century was dominated by the issue of the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary. During his pontificate petitions increased requesting the dogmatization of the Immaculate Conception. In 1848 Pius appointed a theological commission to analyze the possibility for a Marian dogma.\n\nIn 1848 the Pope had to flee Rome, when a revolutionary movement took over the Papal States and city government. From his exile in Gaeta he issued the encyclical \"Ubi primum\", seeking the opinions of the bishops on the Immaculate Conception, a novel approach of collegiality in the history of the papacy. Over 90 per cent of the bishops requested the dogmatization. Pius IX moved cautiously, on 10 May 1852 appointing a commission of twenty theologians to prepare a possible text of the dogma. Upon their completion, on 2 December 1852 he asked a commission of cardinals to finalize the text.\n\nIt also influenced the eventual promulgation of the dogma of the Assumption. Pius IX's approach of seeking collegial consensus was quoted by Pope Pius XII, when in \"Deiparae Virginis Mariae\", he inquired of the bishops about a possible dogma of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary.\n\nIt was not until 1854 that Pius IX, with the support of the overwhelming majority of Roman Catholic Bishops, proclaimed the Immaculate Conception. Eight years earlier, in 1846, the Pope had granted the unanimous wish of the bishops from the United States, and declared the Immaculata the patron of the USA. During First Vatican Council, some 108 council fathers requested to add the words \"Immaculate Virgin\" to the Hail Mary. Some fathers requested the dogma of the Immaculate Conception to be included in the Creed of the Church, which was opposed by Pius IX.\n\nDuring the First Vatican Council, nine Mariological petitions favored a possible assumption dogma, but this was strongly opposed by some council fathers, especially from Germany. On 8 May the fathers rejected a dogmatization at that time, a rejection shared by Pius IX. Council fathers highlighted the divine motherhood of Mary and called her the mother of all graces.\n\nPius IX believed in the Assumption of Mary, and recognized the close relation between the Immaculate Conception of Mary and her being taken up into Heaven. He resisted attempts however, to issue a second Marian dogma within two decades. He attributed to Mary his narrow escape from Rome to Gaeta in 1848.\n\nIn his encyclical on the fiftieth anniversary of the Dogma of the Immaculate Conception, Pope Leo XIII stresses Mary's role in the redemption of humanity. His mariology was greatly influenced by Thomas Aquinas, especially his view of Mary's role in the Annunciation. Leo's emphasis on the path \"through Mary to Christ\" has been a key direction in Roman Catholic Mariology, with Mariology viewed as inherent in Christology, and the rosary paving that path.\nPope Leo XIII (1878–1903) issued a record number of encyclicals on the rosary, instituted the Catholic custom of daily rosary prayer during the month of October, and created in 1883 the Feast of \"Queen of the Holy Rosary\". Leo XIII promulgated Marian devotions via eleven encyclicals on the rosary. A centennial after his death, Leo XIII is often quoted, most recently by Pope Benedict XVI and John Paul II.\n\nHe applied the Marian analysis of Louis de Montfort to the analysis of the Church as a whole. Leo actively employed his papal authority to support the veneration of Mary in places of her apparitions. Upon the blessing and opening of the Church of our Lady in Lourdes, he issued an apostolic writing, \"Parte humanae generi\" supporting pilgrimages to Lourdes and other Marian shrines.\n\nLeo XIII declared the Virgin of Montserrat to be the patron of Catalonia, and instituted the Feast of the Miraculous Medal in 1894. He condemned heresies about the Immaculate Conception and discussed the relation of Saint Joseph to Mary in encyclical \"Quanquam Pluries\" (August 15, 1889).\n\nLeo XIII explained the importance of the rosary as the one road to God, from the father to the Son, to his Mother, and from her to the human race. The rosary is a vital means to participate in the life of Mary and to find the way to Christ.\n\nLeo XIII was the first Pope to fully embrace the concept of Mary as mediatrix. In his rosary encyclicals, he described the Virgin Mary as mediating all graces. In 1883 he wrote that nothing is as salvific and powerful as asking for the support of the Virgin, the mediator of peace with God and of heavenly graces. In his rosary encyclical \"Octobri Mense\", he stated, that Mary is administrator of graces on earth, part of a new salvation order.\n\nIn \"Dei Matris\" he noted, that Mary is mediator because Christ the Lord is also our brother And, in \"Jucunda Semper\", he stated, that the deepest reason, why Roman Catholics look for the protection of Mary through prayer, is most certainly her office as mediator of divine grace. In \"Augustissimae Virginis Mariae\", he wrote that calling on Mary is the best way to be heard by God, and to find his grace.\n\nFrom Thomas Aquinas Leo borrows the notion that Mary, in the hour of Annunciation, assumed the role of a helper in the mystery of redemption. Thus all Christians are born through Mary. With Jesus, Mary carried all in her womb. Therefore, all Christians are her children.\n\nMore than any other pope, Leo XIII, who was himself a member of the Pious Union of Our Lady of Good Counsel, was deeply attached to Our Lady of Good Counsel. The small \"Scapular of Our Lady of Good Counsel\" (the White Scapular) was presented by the Hermits of St. Augustine to Leo XIII who, in December 1893, approved it and endowed it with indulgences. On April 22, 1903, Leo XIII included the invocation \"Mater boni consilii\" in the Litany of Loreto.\n\nDuring predecessor Pius's reign, the Scapular of Our Lady of Ransom was yet approved in 1868.\n\nPope Saint Pius X (1903–1914) promoted daily communion. In his 1904 encyclical \"Ad diem illum\", he views Mary in context of \"restoring everything in Christ\". Spiritually we all are her children and she is the mother of us Therefore, she must be adored like a mother Christ is the Word made Flesh and the Savior of mankind. He had a physical body like every other man: and as Savior of the human family, he had a spiritual and mystical body, the Church. This, the Pope argues, has consequences for our view of the Blessed Virgin.\n\nShe did not conceive the Eternal Son of God merely that He might be made man taking His human nature from her, but also, by giving him her human nature, that He might be the Redeemer of men. Mary, carrying the Savior within her, also carried all those whose life was contained in the life of the Savior. Therefore, all the faithful united to Christ, are members of His body, of His flesh, and of His bones from the womb of Mary like a body united to its head. Though a spiritual and mystical fashion, all are children of Mary, and she is their Mother. Mother, spiritually, but truly Mother of the members of Christ. (S. Aug. L. de S. Virginitate, c. 6).\n\nPope Benedict XV (1914–1922) was an ardent mariologist, devoted to Marian veneration and open new theological perspectives. He personally addressed in numerous letters the pilgrims at Marian sanctuaries. He named Mary, the Patron of Bavaria and permitted in Mexico the Feast of the IC of Guadaloupe. To underline his support for the mediatrix theology, he authorized the Feast of Mary Mediator of all Graces. He condemned the misuse of Marian statues and pictures, dressed in priestly robes, which he outlawed April 4, 1916.\n\nDuring World War I, Benedict placed the world under the protection of the Blessed Virgin Mary (Roman Catholic) and added the invocation \" Mary Queen of Peace\" to the Litany of Loreto. He promoted Marian veneration throughout the world by elevating twenty well known Marian shrines such as Ettal Abbey in Bavaria into Basilica Minor's. He also promoted Marian devotions in the month of May in the spirit of Grignon de Montfort The dogmatic constitution on the Church issued by the Second Vatican Council quotes the Marian theology of Benedict XV.\n\nIn his encyclical on Ephraim the Syrian he depicts Ephraim as a model of Marian devotion to our mother who uniquely was predestined by God. Pope Benedict did not issue a Marian encyclical but addressed the issue of Co-Redemptrix in his Apostolic Letter, \"Inter Soldalica,\" issued March 22, 1918.\n\n\nPope Pius XI ruled the Church from 1922 to 1939. During his pontificate, a possible dogma of the assumption was being discussed. He granted France the patron “Our lady assumed into heaven patron” In 1930, he sent a Papal delegate to the celebration of the house of Mary in Loreto, and in 1931, 1500 years after the Council of Ephesus, he issued a call to the separated Orthodox Church to venerate Mary together and to overcome the schism. In several apostolic writings he supported the rosary prayer. In 1931, he instituted the fest of motherhood of Mary. Pope Pius XI liked to quote Bernard of Clairvaux: “We have everything through Mary”.\n\nEugenio Pacelli was devoted to the Virgin Mary and as a young boy, two images in Rome received particular veneration: the Madonna Della Strada, and Salus Populi Romani.\n\nPope Pius XII was called the most Marian pope in Church history. He placed his pontificate under the protection of the Virgin.\n\nIn the 1943 encyclical \"Mystici corporis\", Pope Pius XII speaks to the 1854 dogma of the Immaculate Conception promulgated by Pius IX in 1854. Mary, whose sinless soul was filled with the divine spirit of Jesus Christ above all other created souls, \"in the name of the whole human race\" gave her consent \"for a spiritual marriage between the Son of God and human nature.\", thus elevating human nature beyond the realm of the purely material. Through her powerful prayers, she obtained that the spirit of our diviner redeemer should be bestowed on the newly founded Church at Pentecost. She is Most Holy Mother of all the members of Christ, and reigns in heaven with her Son, her body and soul refulgent with heavenly glory.\n\nMany of the saints canonized by Pius XII were deeply devoted to Mary, such as Peter Chanel, Jeanne de Lestonnac, Pope Pius X, Catherine Labouré, and Anthony Mary Claret.\n\nPacelli was consecrated archbishop in the Sistine Chapel by Pope Benedict XV on May 13, 1917, the same day as the first purported apparition of Our Lady of Fatima. His Secretary of State, Cardinal Luigi Maglione would later say that the Pope had been deeply moved by the parallel of his episcopal consecration and the apparition in Fatima. Referring to his episcopal consecration Pope Pius said:\n\n\nCardinal Tedeschini, who was present at the consecration in 1917, added his view to the coincidence: \"The pontificate of Pius XII is focused on Fatima, May 13. It was our Lady of Fatima, who connected with the person and future of Eugenio Pacelli, having him consecrated through the hands of Pope Benedict XV to the fullness of priesthood at the very day and hour, in which the Most Blessed Virgin with her messages first descended to Fatima. May 13 is engraved in all our hearts, how much more in the heart of this Pope.\n\nOn May 13, 1942, the 25th anniversary of the first apparition and, silver jubilee of the Episcopal consecration of Pope Pius XII, the Vatican published the Message and Secret of Fatima. In May 1946, he authorized his personal representative, Cardinal Masalla to preside over a canonical coronation of the image of Our Lady of Fatima, in Fatima, Portugal. \"The faithful virgin never disappointed the trust, put on her. She will transform into a fountain of graces, physical and spiritual graces, over all of Portugal, and from there, breaking all frontiers, over the whole Church and the entire world\"\nOn May 18, 1950, the Pope sent a message to the people of Portugal: \"May Portugal never forget the heavenly message of Fatima, which, before anybody else she was blessed to hear. To keep Fatima in your heart and to translate Fatima into deeds, is the best guarantee for ever more graces”\n\nWith the September 8, 1953 encyclical \"Fulgens corona\", Pius XII became the first Pope to call for a Marian year, a practice continued by John Paul II in 1987. Set for 1954 Marian year included initiatives in the areas of mariology, cultural events, charity and social gatherings\n\nThe encyclical \"Le pèlerinage de Lourdes\", was issued on July 2, 1957. The encyclical represents the strongest pronouncement of the papal magisterium on Marian apparitions in the history of the Catholic Church. In it Pius recalls pleasant memories of the pilgrimage to Lourdes which he undertook while Papal delegate at the Eucharistic and Marian Celebrations in 1937. The Pope reminds the faithful of France, that every Christian land is a Marian land and that” there is not one nation redeemed in the blood of Christ which does not glory in proclaiming Mary its Mother and Patroness” He then recalls the history of Marian veneration, the history of Lourdes and the contributions of the Popes to her veneration in Lourdes.\n\nChristian families must remain faithful to their vital mission in society, and, consecrate themselves in this jubilee year to the Immaculate Heart of Mary. For married couples this consecration will be a valuable aid in their conjugal duties of chastity and faithfulness and keep pure the atmosphere in which children grow up.\"\n\nProfessional and civic affairs offer a vast field of Marian action. Gathered at the Virgin's feet, and open to her teachings, self-searching will uproot any false judgments and selfish impulses. ...The quest for social and political peace among men is, above all, a moral problem, because no reform can bear fruit, no agreement lasting without a conversion and cleansing of heart. In this jubilee year the Virgin of Lourdes reminds all men of this truth\n\nPius XII teaches, that Mary looks upon some of her children with a special affection, the lowly, the poor, and the afflicted whom Jesus loved so much.\n\n\nThe Pontiff states, that the Immaculate Virgin knows the secret ways by which grace operates in souls. She also knows also the great price which God attaches to sufferings, united to those of the Savior. The encyclical closes with a quote of Saint Bernard of Clairvaux: \"Amid dangers, difficulties, and doubts, think of Mary, invoke Mary's aid... If you follow her, you will not stray; if you entreat her, you will not lose hope; if you reflect upon her, you will not err; if she supports you, you will not fall; if she protects you, you will not fear; if she leads you, you will not grow weary; if she is propitious, you will reach your goal.\"\n\nOn October 31, 1942 Pius XII consecrated the human race and later Russia to the Immaculate Heart of Mary.\n\nOn October 31, 1942, Pope Pius XII, in a radio address informed the people of Portugal about the apparitions of Fatima, consecrating the human race to the Immaculate Heart of the Virgin with specific mention of Russia. On December 8, 1942, the Pontiff officially and solemnly declared this consecration in a ceremony in Saint Peter Basilica in Rome.\n\nThe Consecration to the Immaculate Heart of Mary took place on October 31, 1942 just before major turning points in World War Two. Pius XII consecrated to Mary not only the Church but the whole human race, as \"Father of Christianity\" as representative of Christ, to whom \"All power is given ... in heaven and in earth.” The solemn consecration to the Immaculate Heart of Mary was pronounced at a critical phase of on October 31. At that time, German troops under General Rommel had conquered strategic parts of North Africa and were advancing towards the Suez Canal. In the Pacific, following Pearl Harbor, the Imperial Japanese forces occupied ever increasing territories, and in Russia experienced an ever expanding German invasion. In this situation, Pope Pius XII, like his predecessors, put his trust in prayer. On October 31, 1942, he called for a prayer crusade to the \"Queen of Peace\", and dedicated the whole human race and especially Russia to the Immaculate Heart of Mary.\n\nIn 1944, Pope Pius XII prescribed the Feast of the Immaculate Heart of Mary for the whole Church in 1944 and placed his pontificate under the special patronage of the Virgin, In his Apostolic Letter of 7 July 1952 Sacro Vergente, Pius consecrated Russia to the Most Blessed Virgin Mary.\n\nOn May 1, 1948, in \"Auspicia quaedam\", Pope Pius requested the consecration to the Immaculate Heart of every Catholic family, parish and dioceses. “It is our wish, consequently, that wherever the opportunity suggests itself, this consecration be made in the various dioceses as well as in each of the parishes and families.\"\n\nThe 1854 dogma of the Immaculate Conception by Pius IX defined the Virgin conceived without sin, as the mother of God and our mother. Pope Pius XII built on this in \"Mystici corporis\", which summarizes his mariology: Maria, whose sinless soul was filled with the divine spirit of Jesus Christ above all other created souls, \"in the name of the whole human race\" gave her consent \"for a spiritual marriage between the Son of God and human nature.\", thus elevating human nature beyond the realm of the purely material. She who, according to the flesh, was the mother of our Head, became mother of all His members. Through her powerful prayers, she obtained that the spirit of our Divine Redeemer, should be bestowed on the newly founded Church at Pentecost. She is Most Holy Mother of all the members of Christ, and reigns in heaven with her Son, her body and soul refulgent with heavenly glory.\n\nIn 1950 Pius XII defined the Assumption of Mary as an article of faith for Roman Catholics. This was the first (and only) ex cathedra exercise of papal infallibility since Vatican I.\nOn November 1, 1950, Pope Pius XII defined the dogma of the assumption:\n\nThe dogma of the bodily assumption of the Virgin Mary, is the crowning of the theology of Pope Pius XII. In 1950 Pope Pius XII defined the Assumption of Mary as being an article of faith for Roman Catholics. This was the first (and to date only) ex cathedra exercise of papal infallibility since Vatican I. It was preceded by the 1946 encyclical Deiparae Virginis Mariae, which requested all Catholic bishops to express their opinion on a possible dogmatization. In this dogmatic statement, the phrase \"having completed the course of her earthly life, \" leaves open the question of whether the Virgin Mary died before her Assumption, or, whether she was assumed before death; both possibilities are allowed. Mary's Assumption was a divine gift to Mary as Mother of God. As Mary completed her race as a shining example to the human race, the perspective of the gift of assumption is offered to the whole human race.\n\nPope Pius XII instituted the feast of the Immaculate Heart of Mary in 1944 to be celebrated on 22 August, coinciding with the traditional octave day of the Assumption. (In 1969, Pope Paul VI moved the celebration of the Immaculate Heart of Mary to the day, Saturday, immediately after the Solemnity of the Sacred Heart of Jesus.)\nIn the October 11, 1954 encyclical \"Ad Caeli Reginam\", he introduced a new Marian feast, the Queenship of Mary. \nIn several encyclicals and apostolic letters to the people of Poland and other countries behind the Iron curtain, he expresses certainty, that the Blessed Virgin Mary will triumph over her enemies.\n\nAssumed into heaven, so Pope Pius, Mary is with Jesus Christ, her divine son. Mary should be called Queen, not only because of her Divine Motherhood of Jesus Christ, her only son, but also because God has willed her to have an exceptional role in the work of our eternal salvation. The encyclical argues, that Christ, because He redeemed us, is our Lord and king by a special title, so the Blessed Virgin also (is our queen), on account of the unique manner in which she assisted in our redemption, by giving of her own substance, by freely offering Him for us, by her singular desire and petition for, and active interest in, our salvation.\"\n\nAt the same time as he closely associated the celebrations of the Immaculate Heart of Mary and the Sacred Heart of Jesus, Pope Paul VI moved the celebration of the Queenship of Mary from 31 May to 22 August, bringing it into association with the feast of her Assumption.\n\nIn several encyclicals and apostolic letters to the people of Poland and other countries behind the Iron curtain, he expressed certainty, that the Blessed Virgin Mary would triumph over her enemies.\nOn September 8, 1953, the encyclical \"Fulgens corona\" announced a Marian year for 1954, the centennial of the Dogma of the Immaculate Conception . Pope Pius XII left open the Mediatrix question, the role of the Virgin in the salvation acts of her son Jesus Christ. In the encyclical Ad caeli reginam he promulgated the feast, Queenship of Mary. Pius XII, who was consecrated on May 13, 1917, the very day, Our Lady of Fatima is believed to have first appeared, consecrated the world to the Immaculate Heart of Mary in 1942, in accordance with the second \"secret\" of Our Lady of Fatima. (His remains were to be buried in the crypt of Saint Peter Basilica on the feast day of Our Lady of Fatima, October 13, 1958)\n\nIn 1950 and in 1958 he authorized institutions for increased academic research into the veneration of the Blessed Virgin Mary (see below). In 1953, Pope Pius ordered a Marian year for 1954, the first in Church history. The year was filled with Marian initiatives, in the areas of mariology, cultural events, charity and social gatherings In his encyclical \"Fulgens corona\" and \"Ad Caeli Reginam\" he presented a synthesis of the mariology of the Church and warned against excesses and timid under-representation of the Catholic faith.\n\nPius strongly supported Marian research with the foundation or enlargement of a number of research centers in Rome. \nIn 1950 and in 1958 he authorized institutions for increased academic research into the veneration of Mary.\nPope Pius supported or rewarded Mariological research of scholars like Gabriel Roschini, Raimondo Spiazzi, Otto Faller and Sebastian Tromp. Roschini was named head of the Marianum, Spiazzi and Tromp were asked to participate in his encyclicals, Faller received a papal medal for his work. He also promulgated mariology …..within the circles associated with the Holy See took a major step forward between during the Holy Year in 1950 and in 1958 based on the actions of Pope Pius XII who authorized institutions for increased academic research into the veneration of the Blessed Virgin Mary.\n\n\nOf these organizations, the Marianum is the most active marilogical centre in Rome. This Pontifical Catholic institute was founded by Father Gabriel Roschini (who then directed it for several years) under the direction of Pope Pius XII in 1950. At the Marianum, one can get a master's degree in Mariology (2-year academic program) and one can also get a doctorate in Mariology. This Mariological facility has a library with more than 85,000 volumes on Mariology and a number of magazines and journals of theological and Mariological concern. Marianum is also the name of the prestigious journal of Marian theology, previously founded by Father Roschini in 1939.\n\nPope Paul VI (1963–1978) made extensive contributions to mariology (theological teaching and devotions) during his pontificate. He attempted to present the Marian teachings of the Church in view of her new ecumenical orientation. In his inaugural encyclical \"Ecclesiam Suam\" (section below), the Pope called Mary the ideal of Christian perfection. He regards “devotion to the Mother of God as of paramount importance in living the life of the Gospel.” In 1965, he writes that the Queen of Heaven is entrusted by God, as administrator of his compassion In his 1965 encyclical \"Mense maio\" he described Mary as the way to Christ, the person who encounters Mary cannot help but encounter Christ likewise.\n\nIn his 1966 encyclical \"Christi Matri\", he recommends the rosary in light of the Vietnam War and the dangers of atomic conflicts. He recommended prayers to Queen of Peace and Mother of the Church:\n\n\nPaul VI taught that the rosary is a summary of gospel teachings. His new Missal includes all new Marian prayers. And in his 1974 exhortation Marialis Cultus, he again promotes Marian devotions, highlighting the Angelus and Rosary prayers. Mary deserves the devotions because she is the mother of graces and because of her unique role in redemption.\n\nOn the fiftieth anniversary of the apparition in Fatima, Paul VI made a pilgrimage there, the first ever by a Pope. There, he linked the veneration of Mary to her role in the salvation of the human race \"Pope Paul VI was an engaged and engaging devotee of the Virgin Mary\"\n\nThe Mariology of Pope Paul VI made extensive contributions to mariological teaching and devotions during his pontificate.\n\nHe attempted to present the Marian teachings of the Church in view of her new ecumenical orientation. In his inaugural encyclical \"Ecclesiam Suam\" (section below), the Pope called Mary the ideal of Christian perfection. He regards “devotion to the Mother of God as of paramount importance in living the life of the Gospel.”\n\nThe encyclical \"Mense maio\" from 29 April 1965 focused on the Virgin Mary, to whom traditionally the month of May is dedicated as the Mother of God. Paul VI writes that Mary is rightly to be regarded as the way by which people are led to Christ. Therefore, the person who encounters Mary cannot help but encounter Christ.\n\nIn 1965, he writes that the Queen of Heaven is entrusted by God, as administrator of his compassion In his 1965 encyclical \"Mense maio\", he described Mary as the way to Christ, the person who encounters Mary cannot help but encounter Christ likewise.\n\nIn his 1966 encyclical \"Christi Matri\", he recommends the rosary in light of the Vietnam War and the dangers of atomic conflicts. The Queen of Peace and Mother of the Church should be invoked:\n\nThe rosary is a summary of gospel teaching. His new Missal includes all new Marian prayers. And in his 1974 exhortation Marialis Cultus, he again promotes Marian devotions, highlighting the Angelus and Rosary prayers. Mary deserves the devotions because she is the mother of graces and because of her unique role in redemption.\n\nOn the fiftieth anniversary of the apparition in Fatima, Paul VI made a pilgrimage there, the first ever by a Pope. There, he linked the veneration of Mary to her role in the salvation of the human race \"Pope Paul VI was a engaged and engaging devotee of the Virgin Mary\"\n\nThe ancient title \"Mary Mother of the Church\" was proclaimed then by Pope Paul VI at the Second Vatican Council. In 1987, Pope John Paul II repeated this title \"Mother of the Church\" in his encyclical \"Redemptoris Mater\" and at a general audience on September 17, 1997. The encyclical is a long and eloquent summary of modern Mariology, making some novel points. According to John Paul, the Mother of the Redeemer has a precise place in the plan of salvation.\n\nThe 2002 apostolic letter \"Rosarium Virginis Mariae\" of Pope John Paul II on the Rosary further communicated his Marian focus as he explained how his personal motto \"Totus Tuus\" was inspired by St. Louis de Montfort's doctrine on the excellence of Marian devotion and total consecration. The Pope truly venerated the Virgin Mary, as expressed in this motto Totus Tuus.\n\nIn recent years, to emphasize the role of Mary in the Roman Catholic Church, in \"Rosarium Virginis Mariae\", Pope John Paul II quoted Saint Louis de Montfort, and said:Our entire perfection consists in being conformed, united and consecrated to Jesus Christ. Hence the most perfect of all devotions is undoubtedly that which conforms, unites and consecrates us most perfectly to Jesus Christ. Now, since Mary is of all creatures the one most conformed to Jesus Christ, it follows that among all devotions that which most consecrates and conforms a soul to our Lord is devotion to Mary, his Holy Mother, and that the more a soul is consecrated to her the more will it be consecrated to Jesus Christ.As the pontiff observed, Saint Louis de Montfort's approach to Mariology as presented in God Alone presents the logic of how an initially Christ centric view leads to total consecration to the Blessed Virgin Mary.\n\nThe direction of the Catholic Church during the last part of the 20th century was dominated by the views of Pope John Paul II, whose perspective had a very strong Marian emphasis. He advocated \"Total Consecration to Mary\" more than any of his predecessors. And he deliberately reflected his Marian views within the design of his coat of arms by using a Marian Cross. According to the L’Osservatore Romano, the use of the Marian Cross on his coat of arms was a departure from traditional heraldry models and was intended to emphasize the presence of the Virgin Mary under the Cross in Calvary and her special participation in the process of redemption. Pope John Paul II issued a number of Marian encyclicals that shaped the Catholic views on Mary during the 20th century.\n\nPope Benedict XVI continued the program of Pope John Paul II for a redirection of the whole Church to ensure an authentic approach to Christology via a return to the \"whole truth about Mary\". As Cardinal Ratzinger, he wrote:\nIt is necessary to go back to Mary if we want to return to that \"truth about Jesus Christ,\" \"truth about the Church\" and \"truth about man\".\n\nIn a homily, Francis compared Mary at the foot of the Cross with the mothers of prisoners he had met in Buenos Aires.\n\nPapal bulls\nEncyclicals\nApostolic letters\n\n\n"}

While typically associated with pregnancy and childbirth, a maternal bond may also develop in cases where the child is unrelated, such as an adoption.\n\nBoth physical and emotional factors influence the mother-child bonding process. In separation anxiety disorder a child becomes fearful and nervous when away from a loved one, usually a parent or other caregiver. New mothers do not always experience instant love toward their child. Instead, the bond can strengthen over time. Bonds can take hours, days, weeks, or months to develop.\n\nThe maternal bond between a woman and her biological child usually begins to develop during pregnancy. The pregnant female adapts her lifestyle to suit the needs of the developing infant. At around 18 to 25 weeks, the mother begins to feel the fetus moving. Similar to seeing her child for the first time in an ultrasound scan, this experience typically leads the mother to feel more attached to her child.\n\nThe developing fetus has some awareness of the mother's heartbeat and voice and has the ability to respond to touch or movement. By the seventh month of pregnancy, two-thirds of women report a strong maternal bond with their unborn child.\n\nMothers who did not want the pregnancy typically do not have a close relationship with the child. They are more likely to suffer from post-partum depression or other mental health problems and less likely to breast feed.\n\nChildbirth is an experience that can strengthen the mother and child bond. Factors such as a traumatic birth, the mother's childhood, medical stress, lack of support and the influence of a spouse or partner can weaken the bond.\n\nEmotional \"bonding theory\" first appeared in the mid-1970s, and by the 1980s had become an accepted phenomenon. Soon, the process became analyzed and scrutinized to the point of creating another term – \"poor bonding\".\n\nProduction of oxytocin during childbirth and lactation increases parasympathetic activity. Thus, anxiety is theoretically reduced. Maternal oxytocin circulation is said to predispose women to bond and show bonding behavior, although this has been disputed.\n\nBreastfeeding is also strongly believed to foster the bond, via touch, response and mutual gazing.\n\nA 2014 study claimed that oxytocin promotes dishonesty when the outcome favors the closely bonded groups to which an individual belongs. A real-world example of this effect can be seen when parents lie about their address to gain admission to better schools for their children.\n\nBeginning at 9–10 months of age when infants begin to crawl and then when they begin to walk around 12 months of age, they begin to develop capacities to physically explore the world away from their mother. These capacities bring with them separation anxiety as the infant becomes more vulnerable away from mother. This newly acquired motor development parallels infants' intellectual curiosity, cognitive and language development as they begin to point and name, and jointly attend with mothers to their environment beginning by 9–10 months. Most parents welcome these explorations and this increased independence. However, in the context of maternal depression, trauma or disturbed bonding in her own early life, some mothers have significant difficulty in tolerating the exploration and-or the infant's anxiety.\n\nThis anxiety increases when infants and toddlers feel threatened or socially reference their mothers for reassurance. Research claimed out that mothers, for example, with histories of violence-exposure and post-traumatic stress show less activity in the medial prefrontal cortex, a brain area that helps to temper and contextualize fear responses, and thus are likely unable to extinguish their own fear response upon watching a videotaped mother-toddler separation scene in a magnetic resonance imaging scanner.\n\nInevitably, children who have rarely been separated from their mother become anxious when separated for extended periods. This is most commonly experienced when starting to attend school. Every child suffers to some extent.\n\nLater in life, this anxiety can reoccur if mothers have to leave their family unit to work. In both cases, the child's anxiety (and that of the parents) can be reduced by priming, i.e. preparing the child for the experience prior to its occurrence and by creating and maintaining dialogue and connection between the absent parent and child during the separation.\n\n"}

Compare Cantonese \"mou4\"; and Southern Min (Quanzhou) and (Zhangzhou).\n\nThe common Chinese word \"wú\" 無 was adopted in the Sino-Japanese, Sino-Korean, and Sino-Vietnamese vocabularies. The Japanese \"kanji\" 無 has \"on'yomi\" readings of \"mu\" or \"bu\", and a \"kun'yomi\" (Japanese reading) of \"na\". The Korean \"hanja\" 無 is read \"mu\" (in Revised, McCune–Reischauer, and Yale romanization systems). The Vietnamese Hán-Việt pronunciation is \"vô\" or \"mô\".\n\nSome English translation equivalents of \"wú\" or \"mu\" 無 are:\n\nIn modern Chinese, Japanese and Korean it is commonly used in combination words as a prefix to indicate the absence of something, e.g., / / \"museon\" (무선 ) for \"wireless\". In Classical Chinese, it is an impersonal existential verb meaning \"not have\".\n\nThe same character is also used in Classical Chinese as a prohibitive particle, though in this case it is more properly written .\n\nOld Chinese *\"ma\" 無 is cognate with the Proto-Tibeto-Burman *\"ma\" \"not\". This reconstructed root is widely represented in Tibeto-Burman languages; for instance, \"ma\" means \"not\" in both Written Tibetan and Written Burmese.\n\nIn traditional Chinese character classification, the uncommon class of phonetic loan characters involved borrowing the character for one word to write another near-homophone. For instance, the character 其 originally depicted a \"ji\" \"winnowing basket\", and scribes used it as a graphic loan for \"qi\" 其 \"his; her; its\", which resulted in a new character \"ji\" 箕 (clarified with the bamboo radical ⺮) to specify the basket.\n\nThe character \"wu\" 無 originally meant \"dance\" and was later used as a graphic loan for \"wu\" \"not\". The earliest graphs for 無 pictured a person with outstretched arms holding something (possibly sleeves, tassels, ornaments) and represented the word \"wu\" \"dance; dancer\". After \"wu\" 無 \"dance\" was borrowed as a loan for \"wu\" \"not; without\", the original meaning was elucidated with the 舛 \"opposite feet\" at the bottom of \"wu\" 舞 \"dance\".\n\n\"The Gateless Gate\", which is a 13th-century collection of Chan or Zen kōans, uses the word \"wu\" or \"mu\" in its title (\"Wumenguan\" or \"Mumonkan\" 無門關) and first kōan case (\"Zhao Zhou's Dog\" 趙州狗子). Chinese Chan calls the word \"mu\" 無 \"the gate to enlightenment\". The Japanese Rinzai school classifies the Mu Kōan as \"hosshin\" 発心 \"resolve to attain enlightenment\", that is, appropriate for beginners seeking \"kenshō\" \"to see the Buddha-nature\"'.\n\nCase 1 of \"The Gateless Gate\" reads as follows:\n\nThe koan originally comes from the \"Zhaozhou Zhenji Chanshi Yulu\" (), \"The Recorded Sayings of Zen Master Zhao Zhou\", koan 132:\n\nThe \"Book of Serenity\" , also known as the \"Book of Equanimity\" or more formally the \"Hóngzhì Chánshī Guǎnglù\" , has a longer version of this koan, which adds the following to the start of the version given in the \"Zhaozhou Zhenji Chanshi Yulu\".\n\nIn the original text, the question is used as a conventional beginning to a question-and-answer exchange (mondo). The reference is to the \"Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra\" which says for example:\nKoan 363 in the \"Zhaozhou Zhenji Chanshi Yulu\" shares the same beginning question.\n\nThis koan is one of several traditionally used by Rinzai school to initiate students into Zen study, and interpretations of it vary widely.\n\nHakuun Yasutani of the Sanbo Kyodan maintained that\nThe Japanese scholar Iriya Yoshitaka made the following comment on the two versions of the koan:\nA similar critique has been given by Steven Heine:\nThe term is often used or translated to mean that the question itself must be \"unasked\": no answer can exist in the terms provided. Zhaozhou's answer, which literally means that dogs do not have Buddha nature, has been interpreted by Robert Pirsig and Douglas Hofstadter to mean that such categorical thinking is a delusion, that yes and no are both correct and incorrect.\n\nIn Robert M. Pirsig's 1974 novel \"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\", \"mu\" is translated as \"no thing\", saying that it meant \"unask the question\". He offered the example of a computer circuit using the binary numeral system, in effect using \"mu\" to represent high impedance:\nThe word features prominently with a similar meaning in Douglas Hofstadter's 1979 book, \"Gödel, Escher, Bach\". It is used fancifully in discussions of symbolic logic, particularly Gödel's incompleteness theorems, to indicate a question whose \"answer\" is to\n\n\"Mu\" may be used similarly to \"N/A\" or \"not applicable,\" a term often used to indicate the question cannot be answered because the conditions of the question do not match the reality. A layperson's example of this concept is often invoked by the loaded question \"Have you stopped beating your wife?\", to which \"mu\" would be the only respectable response.\n\nBecause of this meaning, programming language Perl 6 uses \"Mu\" for the root of its type hierarchy.\n\nIn the Japanese manga series, \"Death Note\", ends in a thematic conclusion which contains MU's usage as \"not applicable\": \"All humans, without exception, will eventually die. The place they go after is MU (無, Nothingness)\".\n\nTsugumi Ohba, the writer of \"Death Note\", explained in the postmortem follow-up volume that the meaning behind \"MU after death\" was that \"the dead person should never come back to life, and it's cheating to revive dead characters as manga. So it became MU\". Ohba further explained that \"all humans die someday, and when we die, we can never come back to life, so let's do our best while we are at it\" was the single most important theme Ohba wanted to express in writing the series.\n\n\n"}

Nguyễn Công Trứ held a respectable position in military as a General. Nguyễn Công Trứ was a poet contributing to Vietnamese declamation’s foundation, namely the poem “Bài ca ngất ngưởng”\n\nNguyễn Công Trứ earned respect as a devoted Confucian scholar and elder statesman. While living in a corrupt feudal system, Nguyễn Công Trứ was known to be honest and straightforward. Nguyễn Công Trứ dedicated nearly all his life to his country and the welfare of its citizens. After his retirement, Nguyễn Công Trứ lived the rest of his life in his hometown and gave a hand with the restoration of pagodas and gave lectures in Buddhism’s belief.\nHe died 7 December 1858. At Nguyễn Công Trứ’s funeral came King Tự Đức as well as distinguished mourners.\n\nNguyễn Công Trứ was born into a poor family. But with diligence, Nguyễn Công Trứ graduated from high school in 1813 and came first in interprovincial Laureate contest in 1819. Then, Nguyễn Công Trứ led a varied life as a mandarin in Nguyễn Dynasty. He held the highest position as Hai An’s Minister and Minister of Defence in 1836 (Quảng Ngãi Province with Hai Duong is Hai An in the past). In 1845, Nguyễn Công Trứ was demoted as a border guard.\n\nWhen he was an officer in charge of farms (a General takes on agriculture owing to being ordered by the King), Nguyễn Công Trứ broke fresh ground to bring farmers 45.990 acres of enriched rice fields. Kim Son and Tien Hai were the most enriched ones. To give credit for his distinguished civil services, the residents set up Nguyễn Công Trứ’s shrines. One is now in Tien Hai (founded in 1852) and the other is in Kim Son (founded in 1856). The king gave him valuables such as hundreds of ingots of silver, an agate sculpture of horse, a gong bearing a golden inscription “Lao năng khả tưởng” (the meaning: his credits and devotion to duty deserves rewarding).\n\nBecause Nguyễn Công Trứ was a righteous, honest and straightforward mandarin, many a dishonest official had an aversion to such individuality of his. Nguyễn Công Trứ was slandered 3 times, however, luckily enough, everything was brought to light and he was completely vindicated then. Furthermore, in the event of Kim Son’s and Tien Hai’s bumper crops, the residents invited the 75-year-old mandarin to join the harvest festival as a red-carpet treatment, and dishonest officials vilified him a rebel leader in Kim Son and Tien Hai but then he succeeded in justifying himself to King Tự Đức. Understandably, Nguyễn Công Trứ took the honor and dishonor for granted.\n\nHis poems, which have mostly been written in pictographic script of Vietnamese, show deep feeling. Some findings have shown that Nguyễn Công Trứ had over 1000 poems mainly of Tang prosody and declamation style of Vietnam. The majority of them is now missing. Approximately 150 of his works remain today. What people find remarkable for Nguyễn Công Trứ’s poems is the individualism, which is truly of the freedom and the independence. Nguyễn Công Trứ made contributed to the growth of medieval Vietnamese literature as well as the variation of this language on the grounds that his works are mainly composed in pictographic script of Vietnamese.\n\nThe conception of morality in medieval society is “Lap duc- Lap cong- Lap ngon” \"(Lập đức–Lập công - Lập ngôn)\", which Nguyễn Công Trứ strove for. “Lap duc”, according to the feudal intelligentsia, is devoting to bring about the country’s prospect and the well-being of its citizens. “Lap cong” bears the meaning of fulfilling the missions assigned by the King. “Lap ngon” is to make a significant contribution to the arts.\n\nNguyễn Công Trứ led a full and varied life insofar as he was once promoted to the rank of General, but then demoted to the lowest rank as a border guard. Nguyễn Công Trứ experienced many ups and downs in his life and career Furthermore, Nguyễn Công Trứ earned a lot of respect as a devoted Confucian scholar and experienced statesman. Nguyễn Công Trứ dedicated nearly all his life to his country and the welfare of its citizens. After his retirement, Nguyễn Công Trứ lived the rest of his life in his hometown and gave a hand with the restoration of pagodas and gave lectures in Buddhism’s beliefs.\n\nWhen French colonists invaded Viet Nam in 1858, Nguyễn Công Trứ was one of feudal intellectuals bravely fighting against the enemy’s deployment. Besides, he went unhesitatingly: “Should I be at my last gasp, I will fight tooth and nail for the country’s freedom and independence.” Nguyễn Công Trứ died on 7 December 1858. At Nguyễn Công Trứ’s funeral came King Tự Đức as well as distinguished mourners and The King himself gave the late statesman parallel sentences as an offering “tả hữu nghi văn nghi võ- tử sinh danh tướng, danh thần”. They bear the meaning of complimenting Nguyễn Công Trứ on his great talent for not only literature but also martial arts.\n\nMany poems of Nguyễn Công Trứ’s is on Vietnamese high school curriculum, namely “BÀI CA NGẤT NGƯỞNG” and “NỢ NAM NHI”. Nguyễn Công Trứ High School was named after Nguyen Cong Tru in 1992.\n"}

It is a legal concept originating in Roman civil law, but it is essentially the equivalent of the double jeopardy (\"autrefois acquit\") doctrine found in common law jurisdictions.\n\nThe International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights guarantees the right to be free from double jeopardy; however, it does not apply to prosecutions by two different sovereigns (unless the relevant extradition treaty expresses a prohibition). The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court creates a different form of \"non bis in idem\".\n\nThe Rome Statute establishing the International Criminal Court (ICC) states that the \"non bis in idem\" principle has a peculiar meaning, especially in comparison to European supranational law. The ICC jurisdiction is complementary to national law, and Article 20 of the Rome Statute specifies that even if the principle remains in general terms, it cannot be taken in consideration if there is unwillingness or incapability of the existence of the supranational court's jurisdiction.\nArticle 10 of the ICTY Statute and Article 9 of the ICTR Statute both state that the principle can be enforced mainly to clarify that the \"ad hoc\" tribunal's sentences are \"stronger\" than the ones in domestic courts.\n\nIn other words, national courts cannot proceed against the responsible parties of crimes within the tribunal's jurisdiction if the international tribunal has already pronounced sentence for the same crimes.

{"id": "109275", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=109275", "title": "Pierre Bourdieu", "text": "Pierre Bourdieu\n\nPierre Felix Bourdieu (; ; 1 August 1930 – 23 January 2002) was a French sociologist, anthropologist, philosopher, and public intellectual.\n\nBourdieu's work was primarily concerned with the dynamics of power in society, and especially the diverse and subtle ways in which power is transferred and social order maintained within and across generations. In conscious opposition to the idealist tradition of much of Western philosophy, his work often emphasized the corporeal nature of social life and stressed the role of practice and embodiment in social dynamics. Building upon the theories of Martin Heidegger, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Edmund Husserl, Georges Canguilhem, Karl Marx, Gaston Bachelard, Max Weber, Émile Durkheim, Claude Lévi-Strauss, Erwin Panofsky, and Marcel Mauss (among others), his research pioneered novel investigative frameworks and methods, and introduced such influential concepts as cultural, social, and symbolic forms of capital (as opposed to traditional economic forms of capital), the cultural reproduction, the habitus, the field or location, and symbolic violence. Another notable influence on Bourdieu was Blaise Pascal, after whom Bourdieu titled his \"Pascalian Meditations\". Bourdieu's major contributions to the sociology of education, the theory of sociology, and sociology of aesthetics have achieved wide influence in several related academic fields (e.g. anthropology, media and cultural studies, education), popular culture, and the arts.\n\nBourdieu's best known book is \"Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgment of Taste\" (1979). The book was judged the sixth most important sociological work of the twentieth century by the International Sociological Association. In it, Bourdieu argues that judgments of taste are related to social position, or more precisely, are themselves acts of social positioning. His argument is put forward by an original combination of social theory and data from quantitative surveys, photographs and interviews, in an attempt to reconcile difficulties such as how to understand the subject within objective structures. In the process, he tried to reconcile the influences of both external social structures and subjective experience on the individual (see structure and agency).\n\nBourdieu was born in Denguin (Pyrénées-Atlantiques), in southern France, to a postal worker and his wife. The household spoke Béarnese, a Gascon dialect. Bourdieu married Marie-Claire Brizard in 1962; the couple had three sons, Jérôme, Emmanuel, and Laurent.\n\nBourdieu was educated at the lycée in Pau before moving to the Lycée Louis-le-Grand in Paris. From there he gained entrance to the École Normale Supérieure (ENS), also in Paris, where he studied philosophy alongside Louis Althusser. After getting his agrégation, Bourdieu worked as a lycée teacher at Moulins for a year before his conscription into the French Army in 1955.\n\nHis biographers write that he chose not to enter the Reserve Officer's College like many of his fellow ENS graduates as he wished to stay with people from his own modest social background. Deployed to Algeria in October 1955 during its war of independence from France, he served in a unit guarding military installations before being transferred to clerical work.\n\nAfter his year-long military service, Bourdieu stayed on as a lecturer in Algiers. During the Algerian War in 1958–1962, Bourdieu undertook ethnographic research into the clash through a study of the Kabyle peoples of the Berbers, laying the groundwork for his anthropological reputation. The result was his first book, \"Sociologie de l'Algérie\" (\"The Sociology of Algeria\", 1958), which became an immediate success in France and was published in America in 1962. He later drew heavily on this fieldwork in his 1972 book \"Outline of a Theory of Practice\", a strong intervention into anthropological theory.\n\nIn 1960 Bourdieu returned to the University of Paris before gaining a teaching position at the University of Lille, where he remained until 1964. From 1964 onwards Bourdieu held the position of Professor (Directeur d'études) in the VIe section of the École Pratique des Hautes Études (the future École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales), and from 1981 the Chair of Sociology at the Collège de France (held before him by Raymond Aron and Maurice Halbwachs). In 1968, Bourdieu took over the Centre de Sociologie Européenne, founded by Aron, which he directed until his death.\n\nIn 1975, with the research group he had formed at the Centre de Sociologie Européenne, he launched the interdisciplinary journal \"Actes de la recherche en sciences sociales\", with which he sought to transform the accepted canons of sociological production while buttressing the scientific rigor of sociology. In 1993 he was honored with the \"Médaille d'or du Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique\" (CNRS). In 1996 he received the Goffman Prize from the University of California, Berkeley and in 2001 the Huxley Medal of the Royal Anthropological Institute. Bourdieu died of cancer at the age of 71.\n\nBourdieu's work is influenced by much of traditional anthropology and sociology which he undertook to synthesize into his own theory. From Max Weber he retained the importance of domination and symbolic systems in social life, as well as the idea of social orders which would ultimately be transformed by Bourdieu from a sociology of religion into a theory of fields.\n\nFrom Marx he gained his understanding of 'society' as the ensemble of social relationships: \"what exist in the social world are relations – not interactions between agents or intersubjective ties between individuals, but objective relations which exist 'independently of individual consciousness and will'.\" (grounded in the mode and conditions of economic production), and of the need to dialectically develop social theory from social practice.\n\nThe class-based nature of artistic taste had already been firmly established by Arnold Hauser in \"The Social History of Art\" (1951).\n\nFrom Émile Durkheim, through Marcel Mauss and Claude Lévi-Strauss, Bourdieu inherited a certain structuralist interpretation of the tendency of social structures to reproduce themselves, based on the analysis of symbolic structures and forms of classification. However, Bourdieu critically diverged from Durkheim in emphasizing the role of the social \"agent\" in enacting, through the embodiment of social structures, symbolic orders. He furthermore emphasized that the reproduction of social structures does not operate according to a functionalist logic.\n\nMaurice Merleau-Ponty and, through him, the phenomenology of Edmund Husserl played an essential part in the formulation of Bourdieu's focus on the body, action, and practical dispositions (which found their primary manifestation in Bourdieu's theory of \"habitus\").\n\nBourdieu was also influenced by Wittgenstein (especially with regard to his work on rule-following) stating that \"Wittgenstein is probably the philosopher who has helped me most at moments of difficulty. He's a kind of saviour for times of great intellectual distress\".\n\nBourdieu's work is built upon an attempt to transcend a series of oppositions which he thought characterized the social sciences (subjectivism/objectivism, micro/macro, freedom/determinism) of his time. His concepts of habitus, capital, and field were conceived with the intention of overcoming such oppositions.\n\nDuring the 1990s Bourdieu became more and more involved in political debate, becoming one of the most important public faces of intellectual life in France. While a fierce critic of neoliberalism, Bourdieu was also critical of the \"total intellectual\" role played by Sartre, and he dismissed Sartre's attempts to intervene in French politics as \"irresponsible\" and \"opportunistic.\" Bourdieu saw sociology not as a form of \"intellectual entertainment\" but as a serious discipline of a scientific nature. There is an apparent contradiction between Bourdieu's earlier writings against using sociology for political activism and his later launch into the role of a public intellectual, with some highly \"visible political statements\". Although much of his early work stressed the importance of treating sociology as a strict scientific discipline (« \"La sociologie est un sport de combat\" » — \"Sociology is a martial art\"), his later career saw him enter the less academic world of political debate in France, raising the issue of whether the sociologist has political responsibilities extending to the public domain.\n\nAlthough Bourdieu earlier faulted public intellectuals such as Sartre, he had strong political views which influenced his sociology from the beginning. By the time of his later work his main concern had become the effect of globalisation and those who benefited least from it. His politics then became more overt and his role as public intellectual was born, from an \"urgency to speak out against neoliberal discourse that had become so dominant within political debate.\" Bourdieu developed a project to investigate the effects — particularly the harm — of neoliberal reforms in France. The most significant fruit of this project was the 1993 study 'The Weight of the World,' although his views are perhaps more candidly expressed in his articles. 'The Weight of the World' represented a heavyweight scientific challenge to the dominant trends in French politics. Since it was the work of a team of sociologists, it also shows Bourdieu's collaborative character, indicating that he was still in 1993 reluctant to accept being singled out with the category (he deplored the term 'role') of public intellectual. Nevertheless, Bourdieu's activities as a critical sociologist prepared him for the public stage, fulfilling his \"constructionist view of social life\" as it relied upon the idea of social actors making change through collective struggles. His relationship with the media was improved through his very public action of organizing strikes and rallies that raised huge media interest in him and his many books became more popular through this new notoriety. One of the main differences between the critical sociologist and public intellectual is the ability to have a relationship with popular media resources outside the academic realm. It is notable that in his later writings Bourdieu sounded cautionary notes about such individuals, describing them as \"like the Trojan Horse \" for the unwanted elements they may bring to the academic world. Again Bourdieu seems wary of accepting the description 'public intellectual,' worrying that it might be difficult to reconcile with science and scholarship. Research is needed on what conditions transform particular intellectuals into public intellectuals.\nBourdieu routinely sought to connect his theoretical ideas with empirical research and his work can be seen as sociology of culture or, as he described it, a \"Theory of Practice\". His contributions to sociology were both evidential and theoretical (that is, calculated through both systems). His key terms were habitus, \"capital\" and field.\n\nHe extended the idea of capital to categories such as social capital, cultural capital, financial capital, and symbolic capital. For Bourdieu each individual occupies a position in a multidimensional \"social space\"; he or she is not defined only by social class membership, but by every single kind of capital he or she can articulate through social relations. That capital includes the value of social networks, which Bourdieu showed could be used to produce or reproduce inequality.\n\nUltimately, each relatively autonomous field of modern life, such as economy, politics, arts, journalism, bureaucracy, science or education engenders a specific complex of social relations where the agents will engage their everyday practice. Through this practice, they develop a certain disposition for social action that is conditioned by their position on the field (dominant/dominated and orthodox/heterodox are only two possible ways of positioning the agents on the field; these basic binary distinctions are always further analysed considering the specificities of each field). This disposition, combined with every other disposition the individual develops through his engagement with other fields operating within the social world, will eventually come to constitute a system of dispositions, known in Bourdieu's lexicon as a habitus. Dispositions - a key concept in Bourdieu's work - can be conceived as a \"sense of the game\", a partly rational but partly intuitive understanding of fields and of social order in general, a practical sense, a practical reason, giving rise to opinions, tastes, tone of voice, typical body movements and mannerisms and so on. The dispositions constitutive of habitus are therefore conditioned responses to the social world, becoming so ingrained that they come to occur spontaneously, rather like 'kneejerk' opinions. It follows that the habitus developed by an individual will typify his position in the social space. By doing so, social agents will often \"acknowledge\", \"legitimate\" and \"reproduce\" the social forms of domination (including prejudices) and the common opinions of each field as self-evident, clouding from conscience and practice even the acknowledgment of other possible means of production (including symbolic production) and power relations.\n\nThough not deterministic, the inculcation of the subjective structures of the \"habitus\" can be observed through statistical data, for example, while its selective affinity with the objective structures of the social world explains the continuity of the social order through time. As the individual \"habitus\" is always a mix of multiple engagements in the social world through the person's life, while the social fields are put into practice through the agency of the individuals, no social field or order can be completely stable. In other words, if the relation between individual predisposition and social structure is far stronger than common sense tends to believe, it is not a perfect match.\n\nSome examples of his empirical results include showing that, despite the apparent freedom of choice in the arts, people's artistic preferences (such as classical music, rock, traditional music) strongly tie in with their social position; and showing that subtleties of language such as accent, grammar, spelling and style – all part of cultural capital – are a major factor in social mobility (for example, getting a higher-paid, higher-status job).\n\nPierre Bourdieu's work emphasized how social classes, especially the ruling and intellectual classes, preserve their social privileges across generations despite the myth that contemporary post-industrial society boasts equality of opportunity and high social mobility, achieved through formal education.\n\nBourdieu was an extraordinarily prolific author, producing hundreds of articles and three dozen books, nearly all of which are now available in English.\n\nBourdieu developed theories of social stratification based on aesthetic taste in his 1979 work \"Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgment of Taste\" (in French, \"La Distinction\"), published by Harvard University Press. Bourdieu claims that how one chooses to present one's social space to the world — one's aesthetic dispositions — depicts one's status and distances oneself from lower groups. Specifically, Bourdieu hypothesizes that children internalize these dispositions at an early age and that such dispositions guide the young towards their appropriate social positions, towards the behaviors that are suitable for them, and foster an aversion towards other behaviors.\n\nBourdieu theorizes that class fractions teach aesthetic preferences to their young. Class fractions are determined by a combination of the varying degrees of social, economic, and cultural capital. Society incorporates “symbolic goods, especially those regarded as the attributes of excellence, [...as] the ideal weapon in strategies of distinction.” Those attributes deemed excellent are shaped by the interests of the dominating class. He emphasizes the dominance of cultural capital early on by stating that “differences in cultural capital mark the differences between the classes.”\n\nThe development of aesthetic dispositions are very largely determined by social origin rather than accumulated capital and experience over time. The acquisition of cultural capital depends heavily on “total, early, imperceptible learning, performed within the family from the earliest days of life.” Bourdieu argues that, in the main, people inherit their cultural attitudes, the accepted “definitions that their elders offer them.”\n\nHe asserts the primacy of social origin and cultural capital by claiming that social capital and economic capital, though acquired cumulatively over time, depend upon it. Bourdieu claims that “one has to take account of all the characteristics of social condition which are (statistically) associated from earliest childhood with possession of high or low income and which tend to shape tastes adjusted to these conditions.”\n\nAccording to Bourdieu, tastes in food, culture and presentation are indicators of class because trends in their consumption seemingly correlate with an individual’s fit in society. Each fraction of the dominant class develops its own aesthetic criteria. A multitude of consumer interests based on differing social positions necessitates that each fraction “has its own artists and philosophers, newspapers and critics, just as it has its hairdresser, interior decorator, or tailor.”\n\nHowever, Bourdieu does not disregard the importance of social capital and economic capital in the formation of cultural capital. For example, the production of art and the ability to play an instrument “presuppose not only dispositions associated with long establishment in the world of art and culture but also economic means...and spare time.” However, regardless of one’s ability to act upon one’s preferences, Bourdieu specifies that “respondents are only required to express a status-induced familiarity with legitimate...culture.”\n\n“[Taste] functions as a sort of social orientation, a ‘sense of one’s place,’ guiding the occupants of a given...social space towards the social positions adjusted to their properties, and towards the practices or goods which befit the occupants of that position.” Thus, different modes of acquisition yield differences in the nature of preferences.\n\nThese “cognitive structures...are internalized, ‘embodied’ social structures,” becoming a natural entity to the individual (Bourdieu 468). Different tastes are thus seen as unnatural and rejected, resulting in “disgust provoked by horror or visceral intolerance (‘feeling sick’) of the tastes of others.”\n\nBourdieu himself believes class distinction and preferences are “most marked in the ordinary choices of everyday existence, such as furniture, clothing, or cooking, which are particularly revealing of deep-rooted and long-standing dispositions because, lying outside the scope of the educational system, they have to be confronted, as it were, by naked taste.” Indeed, Bourdieu believes that “the strongest and most indelible mark of infant learning” would probably be in the tastes of food. Bourdieu thinks that meals served on special occasions are “an interesting indicator of the mode of self-presentation adopted in ‘showing off’ a life-style (in which furniture also plays a part).” The idea is that their likes and dislikes should mirror those of their associated class fractions.\n\nChildren from the lower end of the social hierarchy are predicted to choose “heavy, fatty fattening foods, which are also cheap” in their dinner layouts, opting for “plentiful and good” meals as opposed to foods that are “original and exotic.” These potential outcomes would reinforce Bourdieu’s “ethic of sobriety for the sake of slimness, which is most recognized at the highest levels of the social hierarchy,” that contrasts the “convivial indulgence” characteristic of the lower classes. Demonstrations of the tastes of luxury (or freedom) and the tastes of necessity reveal a distinction among the social classes.\n\nThe degree to which social origin affects these preferences surpasses both educational and economic capital. Demonstrably, at equivalent levels of educational capital, social origin remains an influential factor in determining these dispositions. How one describes one’s social environment relates closely to social origin because the instinctive narrative springs from early stages of development. Also, across the divisions of labor, “economic constraints tend to relax without any fundamental change in the pattern of spending.” This observation reinforces the idea that social origin, more than economic capital, produces aesthetic preferences because regardless of economic capability, consumption patterns remain stable.\n\nBourdieu's sociological work emphasizes the importance of practices in the social world. Bourdieu was opposed to the intellectualist tradition and stressed that social domination and cultural reproduction were primarily focused on bodily know-how and competent practices in the society. Bourdieu fiercely opposed Rational Choice Theory because he believed it was a misunderstanding of how social agents operate. According to Bourdieu agents do not continuously calculate according to explicit rational and economic criteria. Rather, social agents operate according to an implicit practical logic—a practical sense—and bodily dispositions. Social agents act according to their \"feel for the game\" (the \"feel\" being, roughly, habitus, and the \"game\" being the field).\n\nBourdieu’s anthropological work was dominated by social hierarchy reproduction analysis. Bourdieu criticized the importance given to economic factors in the analysis of social order and change. He stressed that the capacity of actors to impose their cultural reproductions and symbolic systems plays an essential role in the reproduction of dominate social structures. Symbolic violence is the self-interested capacity to ensure that the arbitrariness of the social order is either ignored, or argued as natural, thereby justifying the legitimacy of existing social structures. This concept plays an essential part in his sociological analysis.\n\nFor Bourdieu, the social world has gradually divided into what he calls \"fields\". For him, social activity differences led to various, relatively autonomous, social spaces in which competition centers around particular capital. These fields are treated on a hierarchical basis—with economic power usually governing—wherein the dynamics of fields arise out of the struggle of social actors trying to occupy the dominant positions within the field. Bourdieu embraces prime elements of conflict theory like Marx. Social struggle also occurs within fields hierarchically nested under the economic antagonisms between social classes. The conflicts which take place in each social field have specific characteristics arising from those fields and that involve many social relationships which are not economic.\n\nPierre Bourdieu developed a theory of the action, around the concept of \"habitus\", which exerted a considerable influence in the social sciences. This theory seeks to show that social agents develop strategies which are adapted to the needs of the social worlds that they inhabit. These strategies are unconscious and act on the level of a bodily logic.\n\nBourdieu’s most significant work on cultural production is available in two books: \"The Field of Cultural Production\" (1993) and \"The Rules of Art\" (1996).\n\nBourdieu builds his theory of cultural production using his own characteristic theoretical vocabulary of habitus, capital and field.\n\nDavid Hesmondhalgh writes that “by ‘Cultural production’ Bourdieu intends a very broad understanding of culture, in line with the tradition of classical sociology, including science (which in turn includes social science), law and religion, as well as expressive-aesthetic activities such as art, literature and music. However, his work on cultural production focuses overwhelmingly on two types of field or sub-field of cultural production (...): literature and art.”\n\nAccording to Pierre Bourdieu “the principal obstacle to a rigorous science of the production of the value of cultural goods” is the “charismatic ideology of ‘creation’ “ which can be easily found in studies of art, literature and other cultural fields. In Bourdieu’s opinion charismatic ideology ‘directs the gaze towards the apparent producer and prevents us from asking who has created this “creator” and the magic power of transubstantiation with which the “creator” is endowed’.\n\nFor Bourdieu, a sociologically informed view of an artist ought to describe their influences, antagonisms, etc., i.e. their relations to the field of production; and also should describe their attitudes to their readers, enthusiasts or detractors, i.e. their relations to the field of consumption. Further, a work of literature, for example, may not adequately be analysed either as the product of the author's life and beliefs (a naively biographical account), or without any reference to the author's intentions (as Barthes argued). In short, \"the subject of a work is a \"habitus\" in relationship with a 'post', a position, that is, within a field.\" \n\nAccording to Bourdieu, cultural revolutions are always dependent on the possibilities present in the positions inscribed in the field.\n\nA field is a setting in which agents and their social positions are located. The position of each particular agent in the field is a result of interaction between the specific rules of the field, agent's habitus and agent's capital (social, economic and cultural). Fields interact with each other, and are hierarchical: Most are subordinate to the larger field of power and class relations.\n\nInstead of confining his analysis of social relations and change to voluntaristic agency or strictly in terms of class as a structural relation, Bourdieu uses the agency-structure bridging concept of \"field\": any historical, non-homogeneous social-spatial arena in which people maneuver and struggle in pursuit of desirable resources. Much of Bourdieu's work observes the semi-independent role of educational and cultural resources in the expression of agency. This makes his work amenable to liberal-conservative scholarship positing the fundamental cleavages of society as amongst disorderly factions of the working class, in need of disciplinary intervention where they have assumed excessive privilege. Unsurprisingly given his historical and biographical location, however, Bourdieu was in practice both influenced by and sympathetic to the Marxist identification of economic command as a principal component of power and agency within capitalist society, in contrast to some of his followers or the influential sociologist Max Weber.\n\nBourdieu's concept of habitus was inspired by Marcel Mauss's notion of body technique and hexis. The word itself can be found in the works of Norbert Elias, Max Weber, Edmund Husserl and Erwin Panofsky as re-workings of the concept as it emerged in Aristotle's notion of Hexis. For Bourdieu, habitus was essential in resolving a prominent antinomy of the human sciences: objectivism and subjectivism. Habitus can be defined as a system of dispositions (lasting, acquired schemes of perception, thought and action).\n\nThe individual agent develops these dispositions in response to the objective conditions it encounters. In this way Bourdieu theorizes the inculcation of objective social structures into the subjective, mental experience of agents. For the objective social field places requirements on its participants for membership, so to speak, within the field. Having thereby absorbed objective social structure into a personal set of cognitive and somatic dispositions, and the subjective structures of action of the agent then being commensurate with the objective structures and extant exigencies of the social field, a doxic relationship emerges.\n\nHabitus is somewhat reminiscent of preexisting sociological concepts such as socialization, but habitus also differs from the more classic concepts in several important ways. Firstly, a central aspect of the habitus is its embodiment: Habitus does not only, or even primarily, function at the level of explicit, discursive consciousness. The internal structures become embodied and work in a deeper, practical and often pre-reflexive way. An illustrative example might be the 'muscle memory' cultivated in many areas of physical education. Consider the way we catch a ball - the complex geometric trajectories are not calculated; it is not an intellectual process. Although it is a skill that requires learning, it is more a physical than a mental process and has to be performed physically to be learned. In this sense, the concept has something in common with Anthony Giddens' concept of practical consciousness.\n\nDoxa refers to the learned, fundamental, deep-founded, unconscious beliefs, and values, taken as self-evident universals, that inform an agent's actions and thoughts within a particular field. Doxa tends to favor the particular social arrangement of the field, thus privileging the dominant and taking their position of dominance as self-evident and universally favorable. Therefore, the categories of understanding and perception that constitute a habitus, being congruous with the objective organization of the field, tend to reproduce the very structures of the field. A doxic situation may be thought of as a situation characterized by a harmony between the objective, external structures and the 'subjective', internal structures of the habitus. In the doxic state, the social world is perceived as natural, taken-for-granted and even commonsensical.\n\nBourdieu thus sees habitus as an important factor contributing to social reproduction because it is central to generating and regulating the practices that make up social life. Individuals learn to want what conditions make possible for them, and not to aspire to what is not available to them. The conditions in which the individual lives generate dispositions compatible with these conditions (including tastes in art, literature, food, and music), and in a sense pre-adapted to their demands. The most improbable practices are therefore excluded, as unthinkable, by a kind of immediate submission to order that inclines agents to make a virtue of necessity, that is, to refuse what is categorically denied and to will the inevitable.\n\nAs mentioned above, Bourdieu used the methodological and theoretical concepts of habitus and field in order to make an epistemological break with the prominent objective-subjective antinomy of the social sciences. He wanted to effectively unite social phenomenology and structuralism. Habitus and field are proposed to do so.\n\nBourdieu's ambition to unite these sociological traditions, which had been widely thought to be incompatible, was and remains controversial. The most important concept to grasp is habitus. Crudely put, the habitus is the system of dispositions which individuals have. Sociologists very often look at either social laws (structure) or the individual minds (agency) in which these laws are inscribed. Great sociological arguments have raged between those who argue that the former should be sociology's principal interest (structuralists) and those who argue the same for the latter (phenomenologists). When Bourdieu instead asks us to consider dispositions, he is making a very subtle intervention in sociology. He has found a middle ground where social laws and individual minds meet and is arguing that our proper object of analysis should be this middle ground: dispositions.\n\nDispositions are also importantly public and hence observable. If I prefer brie to Camembert but keep this fact secret — never showing my preference, scrupulously giving no evidence from which my preference may be observed or deduced — then the preference remains strictly private. It may be aptly called a preference, but it is not a disposition in Bourdieu's sense and arguably not in the everyday sense either. A disposition performs, enacts a preference; however trivial, even when disputing the relative merits of cheeses, a disposition is a public declaration of where one stands, what one's allegiances are.\n\nAmongst any society of individuals, the constant performance of dispositions, trivial and grand, forms an observable range of preferences and allegiances, points and vectors. This spatial metaphor can be analysed by sociologists and realised in diagrammatic form. Ultimately, conceptualising social relations this way gives rise to an image of society as a web of interrelated spaces. These are the social fields.\n\nFor Bourdieu, habitus and field can only exist in relation to each other. Although a field is constituted by the various social agents participating in it (and thus their habitus), a habitus, in effect, represents the transposition of objective structures of the field into the subjective structures of action and thought of the agent.\n\nThe relationship between habitus and field is two-way. The field exists only insofar as social agents possess the dispositions and set of perceptual schemata that are necessary to constitute that field and imbue it with meaning. Concomitantly, by participating in the field, agents incorporate into their habitus the proper know-how that will allow them to constitute the field. Habitus manifests the structures of the field, and the field mediates between habitus and practice.\n\nBourdieu attempts to use the concepts of habitus and field to remove the division between the subjective and the objective. Whether or not he successfully does so is open to debate. Bourdieu asserts that any research must be composed of two \"minutes.\" The first an objective stage of research—where one looks at the relations of the social space and the structures of the field. The second stage must be a subjective analysis of social agents' dispositions to act and their categories of perception and understanding that result from their inhabiting the field. Proper research, he says, cannot do without these two together.\n\nBourdieu extended the notion of capital, defined as sums of money or assets put to productive use. For Bourdieu, these assets could take many forms which had not received much attention when he began writing. Bourdieu habitually refers to several principal forms of capital: economic, symbolic, cultural and social. Loic Waquant describes their status in Bourdieu's work in these terms: \"Capital comes in 3 principal species: economic, cultural and social. A fourth species, symbolic capital, designates the effects of any form of capital when people do not perceive them as such.\"\n\nBourdieu sees symbolic capital (e.g., prestige, honor, attention) as a crucial source of power. Symbolic capital is any species of capital that is, in Loïc Wacquant's terms \"not perceived as such,\" but which is instead perceived through socially inculcated classificatory schemes. When a holder of symbolic capital uses the power this confers against an agent who holds less, and seeks thereby to alter their actions, they exercise \"symbolic violence\".\n\nSymbolic violence is fundamentally the imposition of categories of thought and perception upon dominated social agents who then take the social order to be just. It is the incorporation of unconscious structures that tend to perpetuate the structures of action of the dominant. The dominated then take their position to be \"right.\" Symbolic violence is in some senses much more powerful than physical violence in that it is embedded in the very modes of action and structures of cognition of individuals, and imposes the spectre of legitimacy of the social order.\n\nIn his theoretical writings, Bourdieu employs some terminology used in economics to analyze the processes of social and cultural reproduction, of how the various forms of capital tend to transfer from one generation to the next. For Bourdieu, formal education represents the key example of this process. Educational success, according to Bourdieu, entails a whole range of cultural behaviour, extending to ostensibly non-academic features like gait, dress, or accent. Privileged children have learned this behaviour, as have their teachers. Children of unprivileged backgrounds have not. The children of privilege therefore fit the pattern of their teachers' expectations with apparent 'ease'; they are 'docile'. The unprivileged are found to be 'difficult', to present 'challenges'. Yet both behave as their upbringing dictates. Bourdieu regards this 'ease', or 'natural' ability—distinction—as in fact the product of a great social labour, largely on the part of the parents. It equips their children with the dispositions of manner as well as thought which ensure they are able to succeed within the educational system and can then reproduce their parents' class position in the wider social system.\n\nCultural capital refers to assets, e.g., competencies, skills, qualifications, which enable holders to mobilise cultural authority and can also be a source of misrecognition and symbolic violence. For example, working class children can come to see the educational success of their middle-class peers as always legitimate, seeing what is often class-based inequality as instead the result of hard work or even 'natural' ability. A key part of this process is the transformation of people's symbolic or economic inheritance (e.g., accent or property) into cultural capital (e.g., university qualifications).\n\nBourdieu argues that cultural capital has developed in opposition to economic capital. Moreover, the conflict between those who mostly hold cultural capital and those who mostly hold economic capital finds expression in the opposed social fields of art and business. The field of art and related cultural fields are seen to have striven historically for autonomy, which in different times and places has been more or less achieved. The autonomous field of art is summed up as \"an economic world turned upside down,\" highlighting the opposition between economic and cultural capital.\n\nFor Bourdieu, \"social capital is the sum of the resources, actual or virtual, that accrue to an individual or a group by virtue of possessing \"a durable network of more or less institutionalized relationships\" of mutual acquaintance and recognition.\"In order for individuals to gain such capital, they must work for it constantly and it takes time according to Bourdieu. For some families, cultural capital is accumulated over a period of generations as they adopt cultural investment strategies and pass them on to their children. This gives children an opportunity to realize their potential through education and they pass on those same values to their children. Over time, individuals in such families gain cultural currency which gives them an inherent advantage over other groups of people, which is why there is such variation in academic achievement in children of different social classes. Having such cultural currency enables people to compensate for a lack of financial capital by giving them a certain level of respect and status in society. Bourdieu believes that cultural capital may play a role when individuals pursue power and status in society through politics or other means. Social and cultural capital along with economic capital contribute to the inequality we see in the world, according to Bourdieu's argument.\n\nBourdieu insists on the importance of a reflexive sociology in which sociologists must at all times conduct their research with conscious attention to the effects of their own position, their own set of internalized structures, and how these are likely to distort or prejudice their objectivity. The sociologist, according to Bourdieu, must engage in a \"sociology of sociology\" so as not to unwittingly attribute to the object of observation the characteristics of the subject. She/he ought to conduct their research with one eye continually reflecting back upon their own habitus, their dispositions learned through long social and institutional training.\n\nIt is only by maintaining such a continual vigilance that the sociologists can spot themselves in the act of importing their own biases into their work. Reflexivity is, therefore, a kind of additional stage in the scientific epistemology. It is not enough for the scientist to go through the usual stages (research, hypothesis, falsification, experiment, repetition, peer review, etc.); Bourdieu recommends also that the scientist purge their work of the prejudices likely to derive from their social position. In a good illustration of the process, Bourdieu chastises academics (including himself) for judging their students' work against a rigidly scholastic linguistic register, favouring students whose writing appears 'polished', marking down those guilty of 'vulgarity'. Without a reflexive analysis of the snobbery being deployed under the cover of those subjective terms, the academic will unconsciously reproduce a degree of class prejudice, promoting the student with high linguistic capital and holding back the student who lacks it — not because of the objective quality of the work but simply because of the register in which it is written. Reflexivity should enable the academic to be conscious of their prejudices, e.g. for apparently sophisticated writing, and impel them to take steps to correct for this bias.\n\nBourdieu also describes how the \"scholastic point of view\" unconsciously alters how scientists approach their objects of study. Because of the systematicity of their training and their mode of analysis, they tend to exaggerate the systematicity of the things they study. This inclines them to see agents following clear rules where in fact they use less determinate strategies; it makes it hard to theorise the 'fuzzy' logic of the social world, its practical and therefore mutable nature, poorly described by words like 'system', 'structure' and 'logic' which imply mechanisms, rigidity and omnipresence. The scholar can too easily find themselves mistaking \"the things of logic for the logic of things\" — a phrase of Marx's which Bourdieu is fond of quoting. Again, reflexivity is recommended as the key to discovering and correcting for such errors which would otherwise remain unseen, mistakes produced by an over-application of the virtues that produced also the truths within which the errors are embedded.\n\nBourdieu contended there is transcendental objectivity, only when certain necessary historical conditions are met. The scientific field is precisely that field in which objectivity may be acquired. Bourdieu's ideal scientific field is one that grants its participants an interest or investment in objectivity. Further, this ideal scientific field is one in which the field's degree of autonomy advances and, in a corresponding process, its \"entrance fee\" becomes increasingly strict. The scientific field entails rigorous intersubjective scrutinizing of theory and data. This should make it difficult for those within the field to bring in, for example, political influence.\n\nHowever, the autonomy of the scientific field cannot be taken for granted. An important part of Bourdieu's theory is that the historical development of a scientific field, sufficiently autonomous to be described as such and to produce objective work, is an achievement that requires continual reproduction. Having been achieved, it cannot be assumed to be secure. Bourdieu does not discount the possibility that the scientific field may lose its autonomy and therefore deteriorate, losing its defining characteristic as a producer of objective work. In this way, the conditions of possibility for the production of transcendental objectivity could arise and then disappear.\n\nBourdieu takes language to be not merely a method of communication, but also a mechanism of power. The language one uses is designated by one's relational position in a field or social space. Different uses of language tend to reiterate the respective positions of each participant. Linguistic interactions are manifestations of the participants' respective positions in social space and categories of understanding, and thus tend to reproduce the objective structures of the social field. This determines who has a \"right\" to be listened to, to interrupt, to ask questions, and to lecture, and to what degree.\n\nThe representation of identity in forms of language can be subdivided into language, dialect, and accent. For example, the use of different dialects in an area can represent a varied social status for individuals. A good example of this would be in the case of French. Until the French Revolution, the difference of dialects usage directly reflected ones social status. Peasants and lower class members spoke local dialects, while only nobles and higher class members were fluent with the official French language. Accents can reflect an area's inner conflict with classifications and authority within a population.\n\nThe reason language acts as a mechanism of power is through forms of mental representations it is acknowledged and noticed as objective representations: as a sign and/or symbol. These signs and symbols therefore transform language into an agency of power.\n\nBourdieu \"was, for many, the leading intellectual of present-day France... a thinker in the same rank as Foucault, Barthes and Lacan\". His works have been translated into two dozen languages and have affected the whole gamut of disciplines in the social sciences and the humanities. They have also been used in pedagogy. Several works of his are considered classics, not only in sociology, but also in anthropology, education, and cultural studies. \"Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste\" (\"La Distinction\") was named as one of the 20th century's ten most important works of sociology by the International Sociological Association. \"The Rules of Art\" has significantly affected sociology, history, literature and aesthetics.\n\nIn France, Bourdieu was seen not as an ivory tower academic or \"cloistered don\" but as a passionate activist for those he believed to be subordinated by society. In 2001, a documentary film about Bourdieu – \"Sociology is a Martial Art\" – \"became an unexpected hit in Paris. Its very title stressed how much of a politically engaged intellectual Bourdieu was, taking on the mantle of Émile Zola and Jean-Paul Sartre in French public life and slugging it out with politicians because he thought that was what people like him should do.\"\n\nFor Bourdieu, sociology was a combative effort, exposing the un-thought structures beneath the physical (somatic) and thought practices of social agents. He saw sociology as a means of confronting symbolic violence and exposing those unseen areas where one could be free.\n\nBourdieu's work continues to be influential. His work is widely cited, and many sociologists and other social scientists work explicitly in a Bourdieusian framework. One example is Loïc Wacquant, who persistently applies the Bourdieusian theoretical and methodological principles to subjects such as boxing, employing what Bourdieu termed \"participant objectivation\" (\"objectivation participante\"), or what Wacquant calls \"carnal sociology.\" In addition to publishing a book on Bourdieu's lasting influence, novelist Édouard Louis uses the legacy of Pierre Bourdieu as a literary device.\n\nBourdieu also played a crucial role in the popularisation of correspondence analysis and particularly multiple correspondence analysis. Bourdieu held that these geometric techniques of data analysis are, like his sociology, inherently relational. \"I use Correspondence Analysis very much, because I think that it is essentially a relational procedure whose philosophy fully expresses what in my view constitutes social reality. It is a procedure that 'thinks' in relations, as I try to do it with the concept of field,\" Bourdieu said, in the preface to \"The Craft of Sociology\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4270198", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4270198", "title": "Projectivism", "text": "Projectivism\n\nProjectivism in philosophy involves attributing ('projecting') qualities to an object as if those qualities actually belong to it. It is a theory for how people interact with the world, and has been applied in both ethics and general philosophy. There are several forms of projectivism.\n\nDavid Hume describes projectivism:\n\nThe origins of projectivism lie with Hume. He describes the view in Treatise on Human Nature. \n\nMore recently, Simon Blackburn has been a major proponent of the view. Blackburn's projectivism is a version of meta-ethical anti-realism. Blackburn conveys anti-realism as the view that statements which express moral properties are our construction, and realism as the view that moral properties somehow exist independent of us, the moral agents. A further distinction should be made to understand Blackburn's projectivism: that between cognitivists and non-cognitivists. Cognitivists believe that moral claims are \"truth-apt\", that is capable of being true or false. Non-cognitivists, on the other hand, believe that moral claims are not truth-apt—not capable of being true or false.\n\nAs a non-cognitivist, the projectivist holds that ethical judgments are the product of conative, rather than cognitive psychological processes. A conative psychological process or state is something akin to a stance, attitude, or disposition. These conative psychological processes should be contrasted with cognitive ones, which are what we typically think of when we talk about human beings “using their reason” or perhaps being rational (at least in the narrow sense). As highly social creatures whose success as a species has been due for the most part to our ability to communicate and cooperate, projectivism holds that the development of a moral interest has actually been in our prudential interest.\n\nBlackburn’s projectivism, what he calls quasi-realism, is based on the significance of the conative stances we hold. His idea is that these conative stances are the starting point for what the meta-ethical realist labels beliefs or even facts, like that you ought to feed your children, or that you have moral values—real values that exist out there in the world independent of you. Since these conative stances are essentially motivating, they can be called desires, and the realist may be tempted to see them as desires connected to true beliefs about things that exist independent of mental construction. This temptation is not in any way ridiculous because as we grow and develop, our conative stances can become quite refined into a kind of moral sensibility. So for the projectivist, meta-ethical realists confuse moral sense and sensibility, as it were. The projectivist position holds that our moral sensibility can become very sophisticated as we age and mature. As we experience compassion, we come to value compassion; or with gratitude, we come to admire being gracious, and consider gratitude a virtue. But the projectivist is not committed to saying that our response to something wrong (i.e. sense) is what determines its rightness or wrongness. The view is that the wrong-making features of actions are external, and they play a role in the development of essentially motivating moral sentiments that guide conduct.\n\nThe view is vulnerable to a big worry for the ethical realist: projectivism may collapse into subjectivism or some variety of moral relativism. For example, it may seem that if Hitler truly felt the Holocaust was the right thing to do, the only possible projectivist response would to be that if Hitler truly thought he was doing the right thing, we might say he was wrong, but for him, it was right. But here, projectivism does not collapse into subjectivism. Where a subjectivist sees no moral disagreement (because he believes “X is right” just means “I approve of X”), the projectivist can allow for moral disagreement. \n\nA bigger vulnerability for the view is that it lacks explanatory power. The worry is that projectivism does not explain meta-ethics, it explains it away. Projectivism may stand to meta-ethics as particularism stands to ethics.\n\nSuppose for example that somebody is hit by a hammer, and sometime later a bruise appears at the point of impact. The impact of the hammer is an observable event; the bruise too is observable. The causal connection between the two events, however, is not observed or experienced, at least according to Hume. Hume believed that whenever we can claim to know something about the world, that knowledge must be derived from experience (see Hume's fork). We do not experience the causal connection between a hammer impact and the formation of a bruise. All we observe are distinct events, occurring at the same place and time (Constant conjunction). Because we observe events of this type, we are led by induction to suppose that like causes will result in like effects, and from this we have the notion of causation. This does not mean Hume doubted that one material object was able to cause a change or movement in another material object. It means that insofar as we talk about some cause resulting in some effect, it is not something we have learned of the world we are talking about because it is not derived from experience. Rather, we are talking about a feature of our thinking which we are inclined to discuss as if it were a feature of the world.\n\nIn short: when we believe we have observed a causal connection all we have really experienced is a conjunction between two separate events. We can only know about the world through experience, so causation as a feature of the world is something unknowable to a human being.\n\nWhat does it mean to say that the probability that a coin lands heads is ½? One might think that the coin will either land upward or it will not, the probability is not a feature of the world, but rather just a measure of our own ignorance.\n\nFrank Ramsey (see his collected papers, edited by D. H. Mellor) and Bruno de Finetti, developed projectivist theories of probability in the early twentieth century. To explain their theories, the concept of degree of belief must first be introduced.\n\nLet us say that a person has a degree of belief of 1 in a particular proposition if he is completely convinced of its truth. For example, most people have a degree of belief of 1 in the proposition that 2+2=4. On the other hand, a person has a degree of belief 0 in a proposition if he is utterly convinced of its falsity; most people have a degree of belief of zero in the proposition that 2+2=5. Intermediate values are possible. A man who thinks that his dog has stolen the sausages, but is not completely sure, might have a degree of belief of 0.8 in the proposition that his dog stole the sausages.\n\nFor each person A, we can define a (partial) function CA mapping the set of propositions to the closed interval [0, 1] by stipulating that for a proposition P CA(P)=t if and only if C has a degree of belief t in the proposition P. Ramsey and de Finetti independently attempted to show that if A is rational, CA is a probability function: that is, CA satisfies the standard (Kolmogorov) probability axioms.\n\nThey supposed that when I describe an event as having probability P I am really voicing my degrees of belief. Probabilities are not real features of the world.\n\nFor example, when I say that the event that the coin lands heads up has probability ½, I do so because my degree of belief in the proposition that the coin will land heads up is ½. (This needs to be restated to show probability in a particular number of flips, not one coin flip, which DOES only have a probability of 1/2 since it only has two sides.)\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1895211", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1895211", "title": "Robert Kane (philosopher)", "text": "Robert Kane (philosopher)\n\nRobert Hilary Kane (born 1938, Boston) is an American philosopher. He is Distinguished Teaching Professor of Philosophy at the University of Texas at Austin, and is currently on phased retirement.\n\nHe is the author of \"Free Will and Values\" (1985), \"Through the Moral Maze\" (1994), and \"The Significance of Free Will\" (1996: awarded the 1996 Robert W. Hamilton Faculty Book Award). He also edited the \"Oxford Handbook of Free Will\" (2004) and has published many articles in the philosophy of mind and action, ethics, the theory of values and philosophy of religion.\n\nKane studied philosophy from 1956 to 1960 at Holy Cross College (B.A. 1960), from 1958 to 1959 at the University of Vienna, and from 1960 to 1964 at Yale University (M.A. 1962, Ph.D. 1964).\n\nKane is one of the leading contemporary philosophers on free will. Advocating what is termed within philosophical circles \"libertarian freedom\", Kane argues that \"(1) the existence of alternative possibilities (or the agent's power to do otherwise) is a necessary condition for acting freely, and (2) determinism is not compatible with alternative possibilities (it precludes the power to do otherwise)\". It is important to note that the crux of Kane's position is grounded not in a defense of alternative possibilities (AP) but in the notion of what Kane refers to as ultimate responsibility (UR). Thus, AP is a necessary but insufficient criterion for free will. It is necessary that there be (metaphysically) real alternatives for our actions, but that is not enough; our actions could be random without being in our control. The control is found in \"ultimate responsibility\".\n\nUltimate responsibility entails that agents must be the ultimate creators (or originators) and sustainers of their own ends and purposes. There must be more than one way for a person's life to turn out (AP). More importantly, whichever way it turns out must be based in the person's willing actions. As Kane defines it,\n\nIn short, \"an agent must be responsible for anything that is a sufficient and necessary reason (condition, cause or motive) for the action's occurring.\"\n\nWhat allows for ultimacy of creation in Kane's picture are what he refers to as \"self-forming actions\" or SFAs — those moments of indecision during which people experience conflicting wills. These SFAs are the undetermined, regress-stopping voluntary actions or refrainings in the life histories of agents that are required for UR. UR does not require that \"every\" act done of our own free will be undetermined and thus that, for every act or choice, we could have done otherwise; it requires only that certain of our choices and actions be undetermined (and thus that we could have done otherwise), namely SFAs. These form our character or nature; they inform our future choices, reasons and motivations in action. If a person has had the opportunity to make a character-forming decision (SFA), he is responsible for the actions that are a result of his character.\n\nRandolph Clarke objects that Kane's depiction of free will is not truly libertarian but rather a form of compatibilism. The objection asserts that although the outcome of an SFA is not determined, one's history up to the event \"is\"; so the fact that an SFA will occur is also determined. The outcome of the SFA is based on chance, and from that point on one's life is determined. This kind of freedom, says Clarke, is no different than the kind of freedom argued for by compatibilists, who assert that even though our actions are determined, they are free because they are in accordance with our own wills, much like the outcome of an SFA.\n\nKane responds that the difference between causal indeterminism and compatibilism is \"ultimate control — the originative control exercised by agents when it is 'up to them' which of a set of possible choices or actions will now occur, and up to no one and nothing else over which the agents themselves do not also have control\". UR assures that the sufficient conditions for one's actions do not lie before one's own birth.\n\nIn his book defending compatibilism, \"Freedom Evolves\", Daniel Dennett spends a chapter criticising Kane's theory. Kane believes freedom is based on certain rare and exceptional events, which he calls self-forming actions or SFA's. Dennett notes that there is no guarantee such an event will occur in an individual's life. If it does not, the individual does not in fact have free will at all, according to Kane. Yet they will seem the same as anyone else. Dennett finds an essentially \"indetectable\" notion of free will to be incredible.\n\nKane is one of several philosophers and scientists to propose a two-stage model of free will. The American philosopher William James was the first (in 1884). Others include the French mathematician and scientist Henri Poincaré (about 1906), the physicist Arthur Holly Compton (1931, 1955), the philosopher Karl Popper (1965, 1977), the physicist and philosopher Henry Margenau (1968, 1982), the philosopher Daniel Dennett (1978), the classicists A. A. Long and David Sedley (1987), the philosopher Alfred Mele (1995), and most recently, the neurogeneticist and biologist Martin Heisenberg (2009), son of the physicist Werner Heisenberg, whose quantum indeterminacy principle lies at the foundation of indeterministic physics.\n\nKane's model goes beyond Daniel Dennett's by trying to keep indeterminism as late as possible in the process of deliberation, indeed as late as the decision itself in the SFAs (Self-Forming Actions). Kane's followers, Laura Waddell Ekstrom, Richard Double, and Mark Balaguer, as well as the philosopher Peter van Inwagen, agree that chance must be the direct cause of action. This makes them all radical libertarians, as opposed to those who limit chance to the early deliberative stages of the decision process, such as James, Popper, Margenau, Doyle and Martin Heisenberg, who are conservative or modest libertarians, following the two-stage models proposed by Dennett and Mele.\n\nIn his 1985 book \"Free Will and Values\", aware of earlier proposals by neurobiologist John Eccles, Popper, and Dennett, but working independently, Kane proposed an ambitious amplifier model for a quantum randomizer in the brain - a spinning wheel of fortune with probability bubbles corresponding to alternative possibilities, in the massive switch amplifier (MSA) tradition of Compton.\n\nHe says\n\nWhat I would like to do then, is to show how an MSA model, using Eccles' notion of critically poised neurons as a working hypothesis, might be adapted to the theory of practical, moral and prudential decision making.\nBut Kane was not satisfied with his solution. In the end he did not endorse it. He said it did not go far enough because it does not fully capture the notion of ultimate responsibility (UR) during rare \"self-forming actions (SFAs). It is merely a \"significant piece in the overall puzzle of a libertarian freedom.\" He explains that the main reason for failure is\nKane admits his basic failure is his location of indeterminism in the decision process itself. This makes chance the direct cause of action. He was actually quite bleak about the possibilities for a satisfactory libertarian model. He felt\n\"that any construction which escaped confusion and emptiness was likely to fall short of some libertarian aspirations - aspirations that I believe cannot ultimately be fulfilled.\" \nBut Kane claims that the major criticism of all indeterminist libertarian models is explaining the power to choose or do otherwise in \"exactly the same conditions,\" something he calls \"dual rational self-control.\" Given that A was the rational choice, how can one defend doing B under exactly the same circumstances?\" Kane is concerned that such a \"dual power\" is arbitrary, capricious, and irrational.\n\nKane's latest suggestion for his occasional self-forming actions argues that the tension and uncertainty in our minds stirs up \"chaos\" that is sensitive to micro-indeterminacies at the neuronal level.\nAll free acts do not have to be undetermined on the libertarian view, but only those acts by which we made ourselves into the kinds of persons we are, namely the \"will-setting\" or \"self-forming actions\" (SFAs) that are required for ultimate responsibility.\n\nNow I believe these undetermined self-forming actions or SFAs occur at those difficult times of life when we are torn between competing visions of what we should do or become. Perhaps we are torn between doing the moral thing or acting from ambition, or between powerful present desires and long-term goals, or we are faced with difficult tasks for which we have aversions.\nSince he is primarily interested in cases of \"liberty of indifference,\" the strong indeterminism he introduces raise the objection of loss of agent control, but Kane says the agent can beforehand decide to assume responsibility whichever way she randomly chose. This seems more like rationalization than reason, but Kane defends it.\n\"Suppose we were to say to such persons: 'But look, you didn't have sufficient or conclusive prior reasons for choosing as you did since you also had viable reasons for choosing the other way.' They might reply. 'True enough. But I did have good reasons for choosing as I did, which I'm willing to stand by and take responsibility for. If these reasons were not sufficient or conclusive reasons, that's because, like the heroine of the novel, I was not a fully formed person before I chose (and still am not, for that matter). Like the author of the novel, I am in the process of writing an unfinished story and forming an unfinished character who, in my case, is myself.'\" \n\n\n\n"}

The first temple, the \"Daiju-in\", and the still existing large pond were built in that century by Fujiwara Saneyoshi. In 1450, Hosokawa Katsumoto, another powerful warlord, acquired the land where the temple stood. He built his residence there, and founded a Zen temple, Ryōan-ji. During the Ōnin War between the clans, the temple was destroyed. Hosokawa Katsumoto died in 1473. In 1488, his son, Hosokawa Matsumoto, rebuilt the temple.\n\nThe temple served as a mausoleum for several emperors. Their tombs are grouped together in what are today known as the \"Seven Imperial Tombs\" at Ryōan-ji. The burial places of these emperors—Uda, Kazan, Ichijō, Go-Suzaku, Go-Reizei, Go-Sanjō, and Horikawa—would have been comparatively humble in the period after their deaths. These tombs reached their present state as a result of the 19th century restoration of imperial sepulchers (\"misasagi\") which were ordered by Emperor Meiji.\n\nThere is controversy over who built the garden and when. Most sources date the garden to the second half of the 15th century. According to some sources, the garden was built by Hosokawa Katsumoto, the creator of the first temple of Ryōan-ji, between 1450 and 1473. Other sources say it was built by his son, Hosokawa Masamoto, in or around 1488. Some say that the garden was built by the famous landscape painter and monk, Sōami (died 1525), but this is disputed by other authors. Some sources say the garden was built in the first half of the 16th century. Other authors say the garden was probably built much later, during the Edo period, between 1618 and 1680. There is also controversy over whether the garden was built by monks, or by professional gardeners, called \"kawaramono\", or a combination of the two. One stone in the garden has the name of two \"kawaramono\" carved into it, Hirokojirō and Kotarō.\n\nThe conclusive history, though, based on documentary sources, is as follows: Hosokawa Katsumoto (1430–1473), deputy to the \"shōgun\", founded in 1450 the Ryōan-ji temple, but the complex was burnt down during the Ōnin War. His son Masamoto rebuilt the temple at the very end of the same century. It is not clear whether any garden was constructed at that time facing the main hall. First descriptions of a garden, clearly describing one in front of the main hall, date from 1680–1682. It is described as a composition of nine big stones laid out to represent Tiger Cubs Crossing the Water. As the garden has fifteen stones at present, it was clearly different from the garden that we see today. A great fire destroyed the buildings in 1779, and rubble of the burnt buildings was dumped in the garden. Garden writer and specialist Akisato Rito (died c. 1830) redid the garden completely on top of the rubble at the end of the eighteenth century and published a picture of his garden in his \"Celebrated Gardens and Sights of Kyoto\" (\"Miyako rinsen meisho zue\") of 1799, showing the garden as it looks today. One big stone at the back was buried partly; it has two first names carved in it, probably names of untouchable stone workers, so called \"kawaramono\". There is no evidence of Zen monks having worked on the garden, apart from the raking of the sand.\n\nThe temple's name is synonymous with the temple's famous Zen garden, the \"karesansui\" (dry landscape) rock garden, thought to have been built in the late 15th century.\n\nThe garden is a rectangle of . Young and Young put the size at twenty-five meters by ten meters. Placed within it are fifteen stones of different sizes, carefully composed in five groups; one group of five stones, two groups of three, and two groups of two stones. The stones are surrounded by white gravel, which is carefully raked each day by the monks. The only vegetation in the garden is some moss around the stones.\n\nThe garden is meant to be viewed from a seated position on the veranda of the \"hōjō\", the residence of the abbot of the monastery.\n\nThe stones are placed so that the entire composition cannot be seen at once from the veranda. They are also arranged so that when looking at the garden from any angle (other than from above) only fourteen of the boulders are visible at one time. It is traditionally said that only through attaining enlightenment would one be able to view the fifteenth boulder.\n\nThe wall behind the garden is an important element of the garden. It is made of clay, which has been stained by age with subtle brown and orange tones. In 1977, the tile roof of the wall was restored with tree bark to its original appearance.\n\nWhen the garden was rebuilt in 1799, it came up higher than before and a view over the wall to the mountain scenery behind came about. At present this view is blocked by trees.\n\nThe garden had particular significance for the composer John Cage, who composed a series of works and made visual art works based on it.\n\nLike any work of art, the artistic garden of Ryōan-ji is also open to interpretation, or scientific research into possible meanings. Many different theories have been put forward inside and outside Japan about what the garden is supposed to represent, from islands in a stream, to swimming baby tigers to the peaks of mountains rising above to theories about secrets of geometry or of the rules of equilibrium of odd numbers. Garden historian Gunter Nitschke wrote: \"The garden at Ryōan-ji does not symbolize anything, or more precisely, to avoid any misunderstanding, the garden of Ryōan-ji does not symbolize, nor does it have the value of reproducing a natural beauty that one can find in the real or mythical world. I consider it to be an abstract composition of 'natural' objects in space, a composition whose function is to incite meditation.\"\n\nIn an article published by the science journal \"Nature\", Gert van Tonder and Michael Lyons analyze the rock garden by generating a model of shape analysis (medial axis) in early visual processing.\n\nUsing this model, they show that the empty space of the garden is implicitly structured, and is aligned with the temple's architecture. According to the researchers, one critical axis of symmetry passes close to the centre of the main hall, which is the traditionally preferred viewing point. In essence, viewing the placement of the stones from a sightline along this point brings a shape from nature (a dichotomously branched tree with a mean branch length decreasing monotonically from the trunk to the tertiary level) in relief.\n\nThe researchers propose that the implicit structure of the garden is designed to appeal to the viewer's unconscious visual sensitivity to axial-symmetry skeletons of stimulus shapes. In support of their findings, they found that imposing a random perturbation of the locations of individual rock features destroyed the special characteristics.\n\nCenturies after its creation, the influences of the dry elements at Ryōan-ji continue to be reflected and re-examined in garden design—for example, in the \"Japangarten\" at the Art Museum at Wolfsburg in Germany.\n\nWhile the rock garden is the best-known garden of Ryōan-ji, the temple also has a water garden; the Kyoyochi Pond, built in the 12th century as part of the Fujiwara estate. Cherry trees have recently been planted northwest of the pond.\n\nRyōan-ji also has a teahouse and tea garden, dating to the 17th century. Near the teahouse is a famous stone water basin, with water continually flowing for ritual purification. \nThis is the Ryōan-ji \"tsukubai\", which translates as \"crouch\"; because of the low height of the basin, the user must bend over to use it, in a sign of reverence and humility. The kanji written on the surface of the stone basin, 五, 隹, 止, 矢, are without significance when read alone. Though the water basin's frame is circular, the opening in the circular face is itself a square (口). If each of the four kanji is read in combination with 口 (the square-shaped radical is pronounced \"kuchi\", meaning \"mouth\" or \"aperture\"), which the square opening is meant to represent, then the characters become 吾, 唯, 足, 知. This is read as \"ware, tada taru (wo) shiru\", which translates literally as \"I only sufficiency know\" (吾 = ware = I, 唯 = tada = merely, only, 足 = taru = be sufficient, suffice, be enough, be worth, deserve, 知 = shiru = know) or, more poetically, as \"I know only satisfaction\". Intended to reinforce Buddhist teachings regarding humility and the abundance within one's soul, the meaning is simple and clear: \"one already has all one needs\". Meanwhile, the positioning of the \"tsukubai\", lower than the veranda on which one stands to view it, compels one to bow respectfully (while listening to the endless trickle of replenishing water from the bamboo pipe) to fully appreciate its deeper philosophical significance. The \"tsukubai\" also embodies a subtle form of Zen teaching using ironic juxtaposition: while the \"shape\" mimics an ancient Chinese coin, the \"sentiment\" is the opposite of materialism. Thus, over many centuries, the \"tsukubai\" has also served as a humorous visual koan for countless monks residing at the temple, gently reminding them daily of their vow of poverty. Notwithstanding the exquisite \"kare sansui\" rock garden on the opposite side of the building, the less-photographed Ryōan-ji tea garden is one of the most sublime and \"valued\" cultural treasures the temple offers to the world.\n\n\n\n"}

Many women who are rich and proud and disdain to mingle with the rest, drive to the temple in covered carriages drawn by teams, and stand there with a great retinue of attendants. But most sit down in the sacred plot of Aphrodite, with crowns of cord on their heads; there is a great multitude of women coming and going; passages marked by line run every way through the crowd, by which the men pass and make their choice. Once a woman has taken her place there, she does not go away to her home before some stranger has cast money into her lap, and had intercourse with her outside the temple; but while he casts the money, he must say, \"I invite you in the name of Mylitta\". It does not matter what sum the money is; the woman will never refuse, for that would be a sin, the money being by this act made sacred. So she follows the first man who casts it and rejects no one. After their intercourse, having discharged her sacred duty to the goddess, she goes away to her home; and thereafter there is no bribe however great that will get her. So then the women that are fair and tall are soon free to depart, but the uncomely have long to wait because they cannot fulfil the law; for some of them remain for three years, or four. There is a custom like this in some parts of Cyprus.\n\nThe British anthropologist James Frazer accumulated citations to prove this in a chapter of his magnum opus \"The Golden Bough\" (1890–1915), and this has served as a starting point for several generations of scholars. Frazer and Henriques distinguished two major forms of sacred sexual rites: temporary rite of unwed girls (with variants such as dowry-sexual rite, or as public defloration of a bride), and lifelong sexual rite. However, Frazer took his sources mostly from authors of Late Antiquity (i.e. 150–500 AD), not from the Classical or Hellenistic periods. This raises questions as to whether the phenomenon of temple sexual rites can be generalized to the whole of the ancient world, as earlier scholars typically did. \n\nThe research of Daniel Arnaud, Vinciane Pirenne-Delforge, Julia Assante, Stephanie Budin and others has cast the whole tradition of scholarship that defined the concept of sacred prostitution into doubt. Budin regards the concept of sacred prostitution as a myth—arguing that the practices described in the sources simply never existed. A more nuanced view, espoused by Pirenne-Delforge, suggests that ritual sex did exist in the Near East, but not in the Greek or Roman worlds in classical or Hellenistic times.\n\nThe practice of sacred prostitution has not been substantiated in any Ancient Near Eastern cultures, despite many popular descriptions of the habit. Through the twentieth century, scholars generally believed that a form of \"sacred marriage\" rite or \"hieros gamos\" was staged between the king of a Sumerian city-state and the High Priestess of Inanna, the Sumerian goddess of sexual love, fertility, and warfare, but no certain evidence has survived to prove that sexual intercourse was included. Along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers there was a temple of Eanna, meaning \"house of heaven\" dedicated to Inanna in the Eanna District of Uruk.\n\nWhile there may well have been some religious prostitution in the temples of Inanna/Ishtar, Assante suggests the concept of the 'sacred marriage' (\"hieros gamos\") has been misunderstood. It was previously believed to have been a custom whereby the king coupled with the high priestess to represent the union of Dumuzid with Inanna (later called Ishtar). It is much more likely that these unions never occurred but were embellishments to the image of the king; hymns which praise Middle Eastern kings for coupling with the goddess Ishtar often speak of him as running 320 kilometres, offering sacrifices, feasting with the sun-god Utu, and receiving a royal crown from An, all in a single day. One scholar comments: \"No one, to the best of my knowledge, has been so wooden-minded to propose that human actors played the role of Utu and An at the banquet.\" Not all authors are convinced, however.\n\nOther modern historians argue that the temple did house priestesses of the goddess, but there is no evidence that they performed any kind of sexual services in any cult.\n\nIn Hammurabi's code of laws, the rights and good name of female sacred sexual priestesses were protected. The same legislation that protected married women from slander applied to them and their children. They could inherit property from their fathers, collect income from land worked by their brothers, and dispose of property. These rights have been described as extraordinary, taking into account the role of women at the time.\n\nThe Hebrew Bible uses two different words for prostitute, \"zonah\" (זונה)‎ and \"kedeshah\" (or \"qedesha\") (קדשה)‎. The word \"zonah\" simply meant an ordinary prostitute or \"loose woman\". But the word \"kedeshah\" literally means \"consecrated\" (feminine form), from the Semitic root \"q-d-sh\" (קדש)‎ meaning \"holy\" or \"set apart\". In spite of the cultic significance of a \"kedeshah\" to a follower of the Canaanite religion, two verses makes it clear that cultic prostitution had no place within Yahweh's worship. :\n\nStephen O. Murray writes that biblical passages ban \"qdeshim\" and link them with gods and \"forms of worship detested by orthodox followers of Yahweh\". Celia Brewer Sinclair has written that \"the ethical demands of the covenant preclude worshiping Yahweh in licentious sexual rites (sacred sexual rites )\". Male priests who engaged in same-sex sacred prostitution were called \"kadesh\" or \"qadesh\" (literally: male \"holy one\"); the word evolved semantically in ancient Hebrew to take on a similar meaning to \"sodomite\". The Hebrew word \"kelev\" (dog) in the next line may also signify a male dancer or prostitute. \n\nSome scholars see the injunctions against foreign worship, including male sacred prostitution, as possibly the original cause of what would later become Judaism's condemnation of sexual contact between men.\n\nThe Law of Moses (Deuteronomy) was not universally observed in Hebrew culture under the rule of King David's dynasty, as recorded in Kings. In fact Judah had lost \"the Book of the Law\". During the reign of King Josiah, The high priest Hilkiah discovers it in \"the House of the Lord\" and realizes that the people have disobeyed, particularly regarding Sacred Prostitution. Examples of male temple prostitution (\"sodomites\" [KJV, GNV]) being banned under King Josiah are recorded to have been commonplace since the reign of King Rehoboam of Judah (King Solomon's son). . Modern bible translations refer to King Josiah's bans on \"male temple prostitutes\" [NRSV] or similarly \"male shrine prostitutes\" [NIV], where as older translations refer to the ban of \"Sodomites\" and \"the Houses of the Sodomites\" [KJV, GNV]. Under the polytheistic religious practices that were commonplace, homosexuality experienced a degree of cultural acceptance along with heterosexuality among the Hebrew tribes, but sacred prostitution was not allowed in conjunction with the worship of Yahweh, where these had been expressly forbidden in Deuteronomy, their sacred Book of Law under King Josiah.\n\nIn the Book of Ezekiel, Oholah and Oholibah appear as the allegorical brides of God who represent Samaria and Jerusalem. They became prostitutes in Egypt, engaging in prostitution from their youth. The prophet Ezekiel condemns both as guilty of religious and political alliance with heathen nations. \n\nSo within Hebrew cultures involving pagan religions, both homosexual and heterosexual pagan temple prostitution experienced periods of acceptance, and periods of banishment, as under King Josiah.\n\nAccording to the noted Assyriologist Samuel Noah Kramer, kings in the ancient Near Eastern region of Sumer established their legitimacy by taking part in a ritual sexual act in the temple of the fertility goddess Ishtar every year on the tenth day of the New Year festival Akitu.\n\nThe Hittites practiced sacred prostitution as part of a cult of deities, including the worship of a mated pair of deities, a bull god and a lion goddess, while in later days it was the mother-goddess who became prominent, representing fertility, and (in Phoenicia) the goddess who presided over human birth.\n\nIn ancient Greece, sacred prostitution was known in the city of Corinth where the Temple of Aphrodite employed a significant number of female servants, \"hetairai\", during classical antiquity.\n\nThe Greek term \"hierodoulos\" or \"hierodule\" has sometimes been taken to mean \"sacred holy woman\", but it is more likely to refer to a former slave freed from slavery in order to be \"dedicated\" to a god.\n\nIn the Greek-influenced and colonized world, \"sacred prostitution\" was known in Cyprus (Greek-settled since 1100 BC), Sicily (Hellenized since 750 BC), in the Kingdom of Pontus (8th century BC) and in Cappadocia (c. 330 BC hellenized).\n\nThe Roman emperor Constantine closed down a number of temples to Venus or similar deities in the 4th century AD, as the Christian church historian Eusebius proudly noted. Eusebius also claimed that the Phoenician cities of Aphaca and Heliopolis (Baalbek) continued to practise temple prostitution until the emperor Constantine put an end to the rite in the 4th century AD.\n\nIn Southern India and the eastern Indian state of Odisha, devadasi is the practice of hierodulic prostitution, with similar customary forms such as basavi, and involves dedicating pre-pubescent and young adolescent girls from villages in a ritual marriage to a deity or a temple, who then work in the temple and function as spiritual guides, dancers, and prostitutes servicing male devotees in the temple. Human Rights Watch reports claim that devadasis are forced into this service and, at least in some cases, to practice prostitution for upper-caste members. The devadasis were originally seen as intercessors who allowed upper-caste men to have contact with the gods. Though they did develop sexual relations with other men, they were not looked upon with lust. The system was criticised by British rulers, leading to decline in support for the system and the devadasis were forced into entering prostitution for survival. Many scholars have stated that the Hindu scriptures do not permit or mention the system.\n\nVarious state governments in India enacted laws to ban this practice both prior to India's independence and more recently. They include Bombay Devdasi Act, 1934, Devdasi (Prevention of dedication) Madras Act, 1947, Karnataka Devdasi (Prohibition of dedication) Act, 1982, and Andhra Pradesh Devdasi (Prohibition of dedication) Act, 1988. However, the tradition continues in certain regions of India, particularly the states of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh.\n\nSacred prostitution was once practised by the Miko within traditional Shinto in Japan. There were once Shinto beliefs that prostitution was sacred, and there used to be lodgings for the temple prostitutes on the shrine grounds. This traditional practise came to an end during the beginning of the Meiji era, due to the encroachment of Western Christian morality, and the government implementing the \"Shinbutsu bunri\"; which, among other things, drastically decreased the roles of the Miko, and modified Shinto beliefs until it became what is now colloquially referred to as State Shinto.\n\nThe Maya maintained several phallic religious cults, possibly involving homosexual temple prostitution. The Aztec god Xochipili (taken from both Toltec and Maya cultures) was both the patron of homosexuals and homosexual prostitutes. The Inca sometimes dedicated young boys as temple prostitutes. The boys were dressed in girl's clothing, and chiefs and head men would have ritual sexual intercourse with them during religious ceremonies and on holy days.\n\nXochiquetzal was worshiped as goddess of sexual power, patroness of prostitutes and artisans involved in the manufacture of luxury items.\n\nThe conquistadores were horrified by the wide-spread acceptance of homosexuality, ephebophilia, pederasty, and pedophilia among Mesoamerican and South American peoples, and used torture, burning at the stake, mass beheadings, and other means to stamp it out both as a religious practice and social custom.\n\nIn the 1970s and early 1980s, some religious cults practiced sacred prostitution as an instrument to recruit new converts. Among them was the alleged cult Children of God, also known as The Family, who called this practice \"Flirty Fishing\". They later abolished the practice due to the growing AIDS epidemic.\n\nIn Ventura County, California, Wilbur and Mary Ellen Tracy established their own temple, the \"Church Of The Most High Goddess\", in the wake of what they described as a divine revelation. Sexual acts played a fundamental role in the church's sacred rites, which were performed by Mary Ellen Tracy herself in her assumed role of High Priestess. Local newspaper articles about the Neopagan church quickly got the attention of local law enforcement officials, and in April 1989, the Tracys' house was searched and the couple arrested on charges of pimping, pandering and prostitution. They were subsequently convicted in a trial in state court and sentenced to jail terms: Wilbur Tracy for 180 days plus a $1,000.00 fine; Mary Ellen Tracy for 90 days plus mandatory screening for STDs.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1242035", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1242035", "title": "Shipping (fandom)", "text": "Shipping (fandom)\n\nShipping, initially derived from the word relationship, is the desire by fans for two or more people, either real-life people or fictional characters (in film, literature, television etc.) to be in a romantic relationship. It is considered a general term for fans' emotional involvement with the ongoing development of a relationship in a work of fiction. Shipping often takes the form of creative works, including fanfiction and fan art, most often published on the internet. However, shipping can involve virtually any kind of relationship- from the well-known and established, through the ambiguous or those undergoing development, and even all the way to the highly improbable and the blatantly impossible.\n\nThe activity of fans creating relationships for fictional characters far predates the term. The first \"ship\" that became widely popular and accepted was the characters Kirk and Spock from the television show \"Star Trek\". This began in the mid-1970s, and was often referred to as Kirk/Spock, and later \"K/S\". This is why relationships between two men are now often referred to as \"slash\".\n\nThe actual term \"shipping\" saw its origin around 1995 by internet fans of the TV show \"The X-Files\", who believed the two main characters, Fox Mulder and Dana Scully, should be or were engaged in a romantic relationship. They called themselves \"relationshippers,\" at first; then R'shipper, 'shipper, and finally just shipper.\n\nThe oldest uses of the noun \"ship\" (according to this definition of the word) and the noun \"shipper\", as recorded by the Oxford English Dictionary, date back to 1996 postings on the Usenet group \"alt.tv.x-files\"; \"shipping\" is first attested slightly later, in 1997 and the verb \"to ship\" in 1998. \n\n\"Ship\" and its derivatives in this context have since come to be in wide and versatile use. \"Shipping\" refers to the phenomenon; a \"ship\" is the concept of a fictional couple; to \"ship\" a couple means to have an affinity for it in one way or another; a \"shipper\" or a \"fangirl/boy\" is somebody significantly involved with such an affinity; a \"Shipping war\" is when two ships contradict each other, causing fans of each ship to argue. A ship that a particular fan prefers over all others is called OTP for \"one true pairing\".\nWhen discussing shipping, a ship that has been confirmed by its series is called a \"canon ship\" or \"sailed ship\", whereas a \"sunk ship\" is a ship that has been proven unable to exist in canon.\n\nVarious naming conventions have developed in different online communities to refer to prospective couples, likely due to the ambiguity and cumbersomeness of the \"Character 1 and Character 2\" format. The first method deployed was using a slash, first used for Kirk/Spock. This is today mainly used for same-sex ships, fanfiction with these pairings is known as Slash fiction, due to fame of slash, the standard for hetero ships in fan fiction became a plus sign (Harry+Hermione), but ! or x can also used be as separators in place of +. Other methods of identifying relationships between characters often create hybrid terms such as portmanteaus and clipped compounds to abbreviate character pairings. For example, Drarry forms a clipped compound, abbreviated from the complete names Draco and Harry. These combinations often follow systematic phonological principles.\n\nMany fandom-specific variants exist and often use fandom-specific terminology. These often employ words that describe the relationship between characters in the context of the fictional universe and simply add the word \"Shipping\" to the end. Other terminology can be more vague, using codes and nicknames as a ship name.\n\nShipping may defy classical social standards and be taboo.\n\nWithin shipping, same-sex pairings are popular; they are sometimes known as \"slash and femslash\". Within the anime/manga fandom, borrowed Japanese terms such as yaoi and yuri may be used. A person who supports same-sex pairings and reads or writes slash fiction may be referred to as a \"slasher\".\n\nThe term \"slash\" predates the use of \"shipping\" by at least some 20 years. It was originally coined as a term to describe a pairing of Kirk and Spock of \"Star Trek\", Kirk/Spock (or \"K/S\"; sometimes spoken \"Kirk-slash-Spock\", whence \"slash\") homosexual fan fiction. For a time in the late 1970s and early 1980s, \"K/S\" was used to describe such fan fiction, regardless of whether or not they were related to \"Star Trek\", and eventually \"slash\" became a universal term to describe all homosexual themed fan works.\n\nParallel to this development, the term \"slash\" was also being used in some fandoms to denote fan fiction or other fan works depicting sexual acts with an implied rating of NC-17, whether homosexual or heterosexual. It is likely that this is the same \"slash\" term born of the \"Star Trek\" fandom, but adapted to the pornographic focus that commonly dominates fanfiction and fan works in the Kirk/Spock ship, as well as the various ships of other same-sex couples. This caused the term to spread to heterosexual ships.\n\nLove triangles are commonly used as a plot device to cause conflict in the story. The easy way around this is to pair all three together, or one member with both potential romantic partners. This is not to be confused with a harem, which is usually just a single character being sought out by many others. Situations such as that may be the one to \"cause\" a polyamory relationship. Polyamory is not always caused by love triangles, but those that don't tend to be less accepted by the fandom.\n\nInterspecies, which is usually displayed in fandoms of media consisting of animals of various species, is usually not controversial until a human is paired with a non-humanoid, sapient character. It is especially controversial when between a human and an animal or furry. Some consider such pairings bestiality.\n\nControversial age differences have a wide range. An elderly adult with a young adult, anyone with an immortal or slowly-ageing being, teenagers with young adults, or pedophiliacs are all part of this category. However, in anime or manga like in which the characters are personified countries, there are large age gaps, sometimes of hundreds of years, then shipping between characters of many different ages is widely accepted in the fandom. Some shippers, of course, may be referring to the given \"human\" ages of the countries. Using these human ages gives way to a smaller age gap.\n\nRomances between two characters who canonically hate each other also occur. It is often interpreted that the characters share sexual tension between each other. An example would be pairing Daniel LaRusso and his bully and rival Johnny from The Karate Kid. This is one of the most popular types of shipping.\n\nAnother example of non-conventional shipping is in the \"Homestuck fandom\", which introduced three new shipping categories: Kismesissitude or \"hate-love\" (a deep-rooted rivalry), Moirallegiance (a deep, very powerful platonic friendship), and Auspisticism (a three-person relationship created between two would-be rivals and a peer mediator). Those in the \"Homestuck fandom\" refer to the usual romantic relationship as matespritship.\n\n\"Daria\" fandom was marked through its entire run by shipper debate. From the series' first season, the main conflict was over whether the title character, Daria Morgendorffer, should have a relationship with Trent Lane, a slacker rock-band frontman, whom Daria met through his sister, Jane. A common argument against this possible outcome was that such a development would signal a turn away from the more subversive aspects of Daria's character, such as bitter criticism of romantic relationships, and thus the show.\n\nThe show's writers responded by having Daria develop a crush on Trent. Trent, however, remained involved with his off-and-on girlfriend Monique, who immediately became a target of shipper ire. The crush ended in the third season's finale, \"Jane's Addition\", when Daria realized that Trent could never satisfy her in the long run.\n\nThat same episode introduced Tom Sloane, a charming and intellectual son of privilege. Although Tom became Jane's boyfriend, threatening Daria and Jane's friendship in the process, Daria and Tom warmed up to each other throughout the fourth season, leading up to its finale, \"Dye! Dye! My Darling,\" broadcast August 2, 2000. With Jane and Tom's relationship in crisis, a heated argument between Daria and Tom led up to a kiss in Tom's car. In the TV movie \"Is it Fall Yet?\", Daria decided to begin a relationship with Tom, and Daria and Jane patched up their friendship.\n\nThis caused an instant uproar, and conversation now turned to whether Tom was more appropriate than Trent had been. The debate was satirized by the show's writers in a piece on MTV's website.\n\nIn interviews done after the series' run, series co-creator Glenn Eichler revealed that \"any viewer who really thought that Daria and Trent could (have) a relationship was just not watching the show we were making,\" Tom came about because \"going into our fourth year... I thought it was really pushing credibility for Daria to have only had one or two dates during her whole high school career,\" and \"teaser\" episodes like \"Pierce Me\" were \"intended to provide some fun for that portion of the audience that was so invested in the romance angle. The fact that those moments were few and far between should have given some indication that the series was not about Daria's love life.\"\n\nThe \"Harry Potter\" series' most contentious ship debates came from supporters of the prospective relationship between Harry Potter and his close female friend Hermione Granger, supporters of Hermione having a romantic relationship with Draco Malfoy, a primary antagonist, and supporters of Hermione ending up instead with Ron Weasley, close friend of both Harry and Hermione. Author J.K. Rowling appeared to try to tamp down the possibility, stating at one point that Harry and Hermione \"are very platonic friends\".\n\nAnother alternative was of Harry ending up with Ginny Weasley, Ron's younger sister, whose obvious crush on him served as a plot-line starting in \"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\". In \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\", Hermione informs Harry that Ginny has \"given up\" on him. In the subsequent \"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\", however, Harry develops a crush on Ginny, convinced that he has missed his opportunity with her. In the end Ginny turns out to never have given up on Harry after all, but merely taken Hermione's advice to try to date other boys to boost her self-confidence. Though their romantic relationship becomes one of the few sources of comfort in Harry's difficult life, he makes a decision to end it for fear that Voldemort would learn of it and target Ginny. Rowling later commented that she had planned Ginny as Harry's \"ideal girl\" from the very beginning.\n\nAn interview with J.K. Rowling conducted by fansite webmasters Emerson Spartz (MuggleNet) and Melissa Anelli (The Leaky Cauldron) shortly after the release of \"Half-Blood Prince\" caused significant controversy within the fandom. In the interview, Spartz stated that Harry/Hermione fans were delusional, to which Rowling responded that they were \"still valued members of her readership\", but that there had been \"anvil-sized hints\" for future Ron/Hermione and Harry/Ginny relationships, and that Harry/Hermione shippers needed to re-read the books. This incident resulted in an uproar among Harry/Hermione shippers, some of whom announced that they would return their copies of \"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\" and boycott future \"Harry Potter\" books, leveling criticism at Spartz, Anelli, and Rowling herself. The uproar was the subject of an article in the \"San Francisco Chronicle\".\n\nRowling's attitude towards the shipping phenomenon has varied between amused and bewildered to frustrated. In that same interview, she stated:\n\nThe release of \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\" in July 2007 saw an epilogue, nineteen years after the events at the focus of the series, where Harry and Ginny are married and have three children, Lily, James, and Albus, and Ron and Hermione are also married and have two, Rose and Hugo.\n\nRowling stated in an interview in February 2014 in \"Wonderland\" Magazine that she thought that realistically Hermione and Ron had \"too much fundamental incompatibility\". She stated that Hermione and Ron were written together \"as a form of wish fulfillment\" as way to reconcile a relationship she herself was once in. She went on to say that perhaps with marriage counseling Ron and Hermione would have been all right. She also went on to say in a talk at Exeter University that Harry's love for Ginny is true, thereby denying any potential canon relationship between Harry and Hermione.\n\nThe 1995–2001 action/fantasy TV series \"\" often saw \"shipping wars\" that turned especially intense due to spillover from real-life debates about homosexuality and gay rights.\n\nShortly after the series' debut, fans started discussing the possibility of a relationship between Xena and her sidekick and best friend Gabrielle. Toward the end of the first season, the show's producers began to play to this perception by deliberately inserting usually humorous lesbian innuendo into some episodes. The show acquired a cult following in the lesbian community. However, Xena had a number of male love interests as well, and from the first season she had an adversarial but sexually charged dynamic with Ares, the God of War, who frequently tried to win her over as his \"Warrior Queen\". Gabrielle herself had once had a male husband, and his death deeply affected her.\n\nAccording to journalist Cathy Young, the quarrel between online fans of the show about whether there should be a relationship between Xena and Gabrielle had a sociopolitical angle, in which some on the anti-relationship side were \"undoubtedly driven by bona fide bigotry\", while some on the pro-relationship side were lesbians who \"approached the argument as a real-life gay rights struggle\" in which \"denying a sexual relationship between Xena and Gabrielle was tantamount to denying the reality of their own lives\". She added:\n\nIn 2000, during the airing of the fifth season, the intensity and sometimes nastiness of the \"shipping wars\" in the Xena fandom was chronicled (from a non-subtexter's point of view) by Australian artist Nancy Lorenz in an article titled \"The Discrimination in the Xenaverse\" in the online \"Xena\" fan magazine \"Whoosh!\", and also in numerous letters in response.\n\nThe wars did not abate after the series came to an end in 2001. With no new material from the show itself, the debates were further fueled by various statements from the cast and crew. In January 2003, Lucy Lawless, the show's star, told \"Lesbian News\" magazine that after watching the series finale (in which Gabrielle revived Xena with a mouth-to-mouth water transfer filmed to look like a full kiss) she had come to believe that Xena and Gabrielle's relationship was \"definitely gay\". However, in the interviews and commentaries on the DVD sets released in 2003–2005, the actors, writers and producers continued to stress the ambiguity of the relationship, and in several interviews both Lawless and Renee O'Connor, who played Gabrielle, spoke of Ares as a principal love interest for Xena. In the interview for the Season 6 episode \"Coming Home\", O'Connor commented, \"If there was ever going to be one man in Xena's life, it would be Ares.\"\n\nIn March 2005, one-time \"Xena\" screenwriter Katherine Fugate, an outspoken supporter of the Xena/Gabrielle pairing, posted a statement on her website appealing for tolerance in the fandom:\n"}

The term is best known in American linguistics from Charles N. Li and Sandra Thompson, who distinguished topic-prominent languages, such as Korean and Japanese, from subject-prominent languages, such as English.\n\nIn Li and Thompson's (1976) view, topic-prominent languages have morphology or syntax that highlights the distinction between the topic and the comment (what is said about the topic). Topic–comment structure may be independent of the syntactic ordering of subject, verb and object.\n\nMany topic-prominent languages share several syntactic features that have arisen because the languages have sentences that are structured around topics, rather than subjects and objects:\n\n\nThe Lolo–Burmese language Lisu has been described as highly topic-prominent, and Sara Rosen has demonstrated that \"while every clause has an identifiable topic, it is often impossible to distinguish subject from direct object or agent from patient. There are no diagnostics that reliably identify subjects (or objects) in Lisu.\" This ambiguity is demonstrated in the following example:\n\nExamples of topic-prominent languages include East Asian languages such as Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Malay, Turkish, Indonesian, Singaporean English and Malaysian English. Hungarian, the Somali language, and Amerindian tongues like the Siouan languages are also topic-prominent. Modern linguistic studies have shown that Brazilian Portuguese is a topic-prominent or topic- and subject-prominent language (see Brazilian Portuguese#Topic-prominent language).

{"id": "1946569", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1946569", "title": "Valentinianism", "text": "Valentinianism\n\nValentinianism was one of the major Gnostic Christian movements. Founded by Valentinus in the second century AD, its influence spread extremely widely, not just within Rome, but also from Northwest Africa to Egypt through to Asia Minor and Syria in the east.\n\nLater in the movement's history it broke into an Eastern and a Western school. Disciples of Valentinus continued to be active into the 4th century AD, after the Roman Empire was declared to be Christian.\n\nValentinus and the Gnostic movement that bore his name were considered threats to Christianity by church leaders and Christian scholars, not only because of their influence, but also because of their doctrine, practices and beliefs. Gnostics were condemned as heretics, and prominent Church fathers such as Irenaeus of Lyons and Hippolytus of Rome wrote against Gnosticism. Most evidence for the Valentinian theory comes from its critics and detractors, most notably Irenaeus, since he was especially concerned with refuting Valentinianism.\n\nValentinus was born in approximately 100 AD and died in Alexandria circa 180 AD. According to Christian scholar Epiphanius of Salamis, he was born in Egypt and schooled in Alexandria. Clement of Alexandria (c.150c.215), another Christian scholar and teacher, reports that Valentinus was taught by Theudas, a disciple of the apostle Paul. He was reputed to be an extremely eloquent man who possessed a great deal of charisma and had an innate ability to attract people. He went to Rome some time between AD 136 and 140, in the time of Pope Hyginus, and had risen to the peak of his teaching career between AD 150 and 155, during the time of Pius.\n\nValentinus is said to have been a very successful teacher, and for some time in the mid-2nd century he was even a prominent and well-respected member of the Catholic community in Rome. At one point during his career he had even hoped to attain the office of bishop, and apparently it was after he was passed over for the position that he broke from the Catholic Church. Valentinus was said to have been a prolific writer; however, the only surviving remains of his work come from quotes that have been transmitted by Clement of Alexandria, Hippolytus and Marcellus of Ancyra. Most scholars also believe that Valentinus wrote the Gospel of Truth, one of the Nag Hammadi texts.\n\nNotable Valentinians included Heracleon (fl. ca. 175), Ptolemy, Florinus, Axionicus and Theodotus.\n\nThe theology that Irenaeus attributed to Valentinus is extremely complicated and difficult to follow. There is some skepticism among scholars that the system actually originated with him, and many believe that the system Irenaeus was counteracting was the construct of later Valentinians.\n\nAccording to Irenaeus, the Valentinians believed that at the beginning there was a Pleroma (literally, a 'fullness'). At the centre of the Pleroma was the primal Father or \"Bythos\", the beginning of all things who, after ages of silence and contemplation, projected thirty \"Aeons\", heavenly archetypes representing fifteen syzygies or sexually complementary pairs. Among them was \"Sophia\". Sophia's weakness, curiosity and passion led to her fall from the Pleroma and the creation of the world and man, both of which are flawed. Valentinians identified the God of the Old Testament as the Demiurge, the imperfect creator of the material world. Man, the highest being in this material world, participates in both the spiritual and the material nature. The work of redemption consists in freeing the former from the latter. One needed to recognize the Father, the \"depth of all being\", as the true source of divine power in order to achieve \"gnosis\" (knowledge). The Valentinians believed that the attainment of this knowledge by the human individual had positive consequences within the universal order and contributed to restoring that order, and that gnosis, not faith, was the key to salvation. Clement wrote that the Valentinians regarded Catholic Christians “as simple people to whom they attributed faith, while they think that gnosis is in themselves. Through the excellent seed that is to be found in them, they are by nature redeemed, and their gnosis is as far removed from faith as the spiritual from the physical”.\n\nThe superstructure of the celestial system, the celestial world of Aeons, is here developed in the most complicated way. These Aeons belong to the purely ideal, noumenal, intelligible, or supersensible world; they are immaterial, they are hypostatic ideas. Together with the source from which they emanate they form the Pleroma. The transition from the immaterial to the material, from the noumenal to the sensible, is brought about by a flaw, or a passion, or a sin, in the female Aeon Sophia.\n\nEpiphanius alleges that the Valentinians “set forth their thirty aeons in mythologic fashion, thinking that they conformed to the years of Jesus”. Of the eight celestial beings of the \"Ogdoad,\" four are peculiar to the Valentinian system. The third pair of Aeons, \"Logos\" and \"Zoe,\" occur only here, and the place of this pair is not firmly established, and occur sometimes before and sometimes after the fourth pair of Aeons, the \"Anthropos\" and the \"Ekklesia\". We cannot be far wrong in suspecting that Valentinus was influenced by the prologue of the fourth Gospel (we also find the probably Johannine names \"Monogenes\" and \"Parakletos\" in the series of Aeons).\n\nIn Valentinianism, Sophia always stands absolutely at the center of the system, and in some sense she seems to represent the supreme female principle.\n\nSophia is the youngest of the Aeons. Observing the multitude of Aeons and the power of begetting them, she hurries back into the depth of the Father, and seeks to emulate him by producing offspring without conjugal intercourse, but only projects an abortion, a formless substance. Upon this she is cast out of Pleroma and into the primal sub-stratum of matter. In the Valentinian systems, the fall of Sophia appears in double guise. The higher Sophia still remains within the upper world after creating a disturbance, and after her expiation and repentance; but her premature offspring, \"Sophia Achamoth\", is removed from the Pleroma, and becomes the heroine of the rest of the drama. This fallen Sophia becomes a world creative power.\nSophia Achamoth, or “Lower Wisdom”, the daughter of “Higher Wisdom”, becomes the mother of the Demiurge, identified with the God of the Old Testament. \n\nThe Gnostics are children of Sophia; from her the heavenly seed, the divine spark, descended into this lower world, subject to the \"Heimarmene\" (destiny) and in the power of hostile spirits and powers; and all their sacraments and mysteries, their formulae and symbols, must be in order to find the way upwards, back to the highest heaven. This idea that the Gnostics know themselves to be in a hostile and evil world reacted in the same direction upon the conception of Sophia. She became likewise a fallen Aeon, who has sunk down into the material world and seeks to free herself from it, receiving her liberation at the hands of a heavenly Redeemer, exactly like the Gnostics.\n\nThe goddess who sinks down into the material may readily be identified with \"Ruach\" (רוח), the Spirit of God, who broods over Chaos, or even with the later \"Chokhmah\", who was generally conceived of as a world-creating agent.\n\nThis system was very closely followed by Valentinus, who may have come to know these doctrines in Egypt. Irenaeus characterizes the Gnostics as the \"pneumatici\" who have a perfect knowledge of God, and have been initiated into the mysteries of Achamoth.\n\nThe chief influence at work here seems to have been the idea of the celestial \"Anthropos\" (\"i.e.\" the Primal Man) – of whom the myth originally relates that he has sunk into matter and then raised himself up from it again – which appears in its simple form in individual Gnostic systems, \"e.g.\" in Poimandres (in the \"Corpus Hermeticum\") and in Manichaeism.\n\nAccording to Valentinus, the Anthropos no longer appears as the world-creative power sinking down into the material world, but as a celestial Aeon of the upper world (or even as the supreme god), who stands in a clearly defined relationship to the fallen Aeon. Adam was created in the name of Anthropos, and overawes the demons by the fear of the pre-existent man. This Anthropos is a cosmogonic element, pure mind as distinct from matter, mind conceived hypostatically as emanating from God and not yet darkened by contact with matter. This mind is considered as the reason of humanity, or humanity itself, as a personified idea, a category without corporeality, the human reason conceived as the World-Soul. It is possible that the role of the Anthropos is here transferred to Sophia Achamoth.\n\nIt is also clear why the Ekklesia appears together with the Anthropos. With this is associated the community of the faithful and the redeemed, who are to share the same fate with him. Perfect \"gnosis\" (and thus the whole body of Gnostics) is connected with the Anthropos.\n\nNext to Sophia stands a male redeeming divinity. In the true Valentinian system, the Christ is the son of the fallen Sophia, who is thus conceived as an individual. Sophia conceives a passion for the First Father himself, or rather, under pretext of love she seeks to draw near to the unattainable Bythos, the Unknowable, and to comprehend his greatness. She brings forth, through her longing for that higher being, an Aeon who is higher and purer than herself, and at once rises into the celestial worlds. Christ has pity on the abortive substance born of Sophia and gives it essence and form, whereupon Sophia tries to rise again to the Father, but in vain. In the enigmatic figure of Christ we again find hidden the original conception of the Primal Man, who sinks down into matter but rises again.\n\nIn the fully developed Ptolemaean system we find a kindred conception, but with a slight difference. Here Christ and Sophia appear as brother and sister, with Christ representing the higher and Sophia the lower element. When this world has been born from Sophia in consequence of her passion, two Aeons, Nous (mind) and Aletheia (truth), by command of the Father, produce two new Aeons, Christ and the Holy Ghost; these restore order in the Pleroma, and in consequence all Aeons combine their best and most wonderful qualities to produce a new Aeon (Jesus, Logos, Soter, or Christ), the “First Fruits” whom they offer to the Father. And this celestial redeemer-Aeon now enters into a marriage with the fallen Aeon; they are the “bride and bridegroom”. It is boldly stated in the exposition in Hippolytus’ \"Philosophumena\" that they produce between them 70 celestial angels.\n\nThis myth can be connected with the historic Jesus of Nazareth by further relating that Christ, having been united to the Sophia, descends into the earthly Jesus, the son of Mary, at his baptism, and becomes the Saviour of men.\n\nA figure entirely peculiar to Valentinian Gnosticism is that of \"Horos\" (the Limiter). The name is perhaps an echo of the Egyptian Horus.\n\nThe task of Horos is to separate the fallen Aeons from the upper world of Aeons. At the same time he becomes a kind of world-creative power, who in this capacity helps to construct an ordered world out of Sophia and her passions. He is also called Stauros (cross), and we frequently meet with references to the figure of Stauros. Speculations about the Stauros are older than Christianity, and a Platonic conception may have been at work here. Plato had already stated that the World-Soul revealed itself in the form of the letter Chi (X), by which he meant that figure described in the heavens by the intersecting orbits of the sun and the planetary ecliptic. Since through this double orbit all the movements of the heavenly powers are determined, so all “becoming” and all life depend on it, and thus we can understand the statement that the World-Soul appears in the form of an X, or a cross.\n\nThe cross can also stand for the wondrous Aeon on whom depends the ordering and life of the world, and thus Horos-Stauros appears here as the first redeemer of Sophia from her passions, and as the orderer of the creation of the world which now begins. Naturally, then, the figure of Horos-Stauros was often assimilated to that of the Christian Redeemer. We possibly find echoes of this in the \"Gospel of Peter\", where the Cross itself is depicted as speaking and even floating out of the tomb.\n\nPeculiarly Valentinian is the above-mentioned derivation of the material world from the passions of Sophia. Whether this already formed part of the original system of Valentinus is questionable, but at any rate it plays a prominent part in the Valentinian school, and consequently appears with the most diverse variations in the account given by Irenaeus. By it is effected the comparative monism of the Valentinian system, and the dualism of the conception of two separate worlds of light and darkness is overcome:\nThis derivation of the material world from the passions of the fallen Sophia is next affected by an older theory, which probably occupied an important place in the main Valentinian system. According to this theory the son of Sophia, whom she forms on the model of the Christ who has disappeared in the Pleroma, becomes the Demiurge, who with his angels now appears as the real-world creative power.\n\nAccording to the older conception, he was an evil and malicious offspring of his mother, who has already been deprived of any particle of light. In the Valentinian systems, the Demiurge was the offspring of a union of Sophia Achamoth with matter, and appears as the fruit of Sophia's repentance and conversion. But as Achamoth herself was only the daughter of Sophia, the last of the thirty Aeons, the Demiurge was distant by many emanations from the Supreme God. The Demiurge in creating this world out of Chaos was unconsciously influenced for good by Christ; and the universe, to the surprise even of its Maker, became almost perfect. The Demiurge regretted even its slight imperfection, and as he thought himself the Supreme God, he attempted to remedy this by sending a Messiah. To this Messiah, however, was actually united Christ the Saviour, who redeemed men.\n\nWith the doctrine of the creation of the world is connected the subject of the creation of man. According to it, the world-creating angels – not one, but many – create man, but the seed of the spirit comes into their creature without their knowledge, by the agency of a higher celestial Aeon, and they are then terrified by the faculty of speech by which their creature rises above them and try to destroy him.\n\nIt is significant that Valentinus himself is credited with having written a treatise upon the threefold nature of man, who is represented as at once spiritual, psychical, and material. In accordance with this there also arise three classes of men: the \"pneumatici\", the \"psychici\", and the \"hylici\". This doctrine dates at least as far back as Plato's \"Republic\".\n\n\nWe also find ideas that emphasize the distinction between the \"soma psychikon\" and the \"soma pneumatikon\":\n\nSalvation is not merely individual redemption of each human soul; it is a cosmic process. It is the return of all things to what they were before the flaw in the sphere of the Aeons brought matter into existence and imprisoned some part of the Divine Light into the evil \"Hyle\" (matter). This setting free of the light sparks is the process of salvation; when all light shall have left Hyle, it will be burnt up and destroyed.\n\nIn Valentinianism the process is extraordinarily elaborate, and we find here developed particularly clearly the myth of the heavenly marriage. This myth, as we shall see more fully below, and as may be mentioned here, is of great significance for the practical piety of the Valentinian Gnostics. It is the chief idea of their pious practices mystically to repeat the experience of this celestial union of the Saviour with Sophia. In this respect, consequently, the myth underwent yet wider development. Just as the Saviour is the bridegroom of Sophia, so the heavenly angels, who sometimes appear as the sons of the Saviour and Sophia, sometimes as the escort of the Saviour, are the males betrothed to the souls of the Gnostics, which are looked upon as feminine. Thus every Gnostic had her unfallen counterpart standing in the presence of God, and the object of a pious life was to bring about and experience this inner union with the celestial abstract personage. This leads us straight to the sacramental ideas of this branch of Gnosticism (see below). And it also explains the expression used of the Gnostics in Irenaeus, that they always meditate upon the secret of the heavenly union (the Syzygia).\n\n“The final consummation of all things will take place when all that is spiritual has been formed and perfected by \"gnosis\".”\n\nThe central point of the piety of Valentinus seems to have been that mystical contemplation of God; in a letter preserved in Clement of Alexandria, he sets forth that the soul of man is like an inn, which is inhabited by many evil spirits.\n\nBut this contemplation of God, as Valentinus declares, closely and deliberately following the doctrines of the Church and with him the compiler of the Gospel of John, is accomplished through the revelation of the Son. This mystic also discusses a vision which is preserved in the \"Philosophumena\" of Hippolytus:\n\nWith celestial enthusiasm Valentinus here surveys and depicts the heavenly world of Aeons, and its connection with the lower world. Exalted joy of battle and a valiant courage breathe forth in the sermon in which Valentinus addresses the faithful:\nThe authorities for the sacramental practices of the Valentinians are preserved especially in the accounts of the Marcosians given in Irenaeus i. 13 and 20, and in the last section of Clement of Alexandria's \"Excerpta ex Theodoto\".\n\nIn almost all the sacramental prayers of the Gnostics handed down to us by Irenaeus, the Mother is the object of the invocation. There are moreover various figures in the fully developed system of the Valentinians who are in the Gnostic's mind when he calls upon the Mother; sometimes it is the fallen Achamoth, sometimes the higher Sophia abiding in the celestial world, sometimes \"Aletheia\", the consort of the supreme heavenly father, but it is always the same idea, the Mother, on whom the faith of the Gnostics is fixed. Thus a baptismal confession of faith of the Gnostics runs: \nThe chief sacrament of the Valentinians seems to have been that of the bridal chamber (\"nymphon\"). The \"Gospel of Philip,\" a probable Valentinian text, reads:\nAs Sophia was united with the Saviour, her bridegroom, so the faithful would experience a union with their angel in the Pleroma (cf. the “Higher Self” or “Holy Guardian Angel”). The ritual of this sacrament is briefly indicated: “A few of them prepare a bridal chamber and in it go through a form of consecration, employing certain fixed formulae, which are repeated over the person to be initiated, and stating that a spiritual marriage is to be performed after the pattern of the higher Syzygia.” Through a fortunate chance, a liturgical formula which was used at this sacrament appears to be preserved, though in a garbled form and in an entirely different connection, the author seeming to have been uncertain as to its original meaning. It runs:\nOther key features of the doctrine of the Bridal Chamber included the use of mirrors as part of the decor and the idea that those who had partaken in the rituals would be able to beget children in the world to come.\n\nBesides this the Gnostics already practiced baptism, using the same form in all essentials as that of the Christian Church. The name given to baptism, at least among certain bodies, was \"apolytrosis\" (liberation); the baptismal formulae have been mentioned above.\n\nThe Gnostics are baptized in the mysterious name which also descended upon Jesus at his baptism. The angels of the Gnostics have also had to be baptized in this name, in order to bring about redemption for themselves and the souls belonging to them.\n\nIn the baptismal formulae the sacred name of the Redeemer is mentioned over and over again. In one of the formulae occur the words: “I would enjoy thy name, Saviour of Truth.” The concluding formula of the baptismal ceremony is: “Peace over all upon whom the Name rests.” This name pronounced at baptism over the faithful has above all the significance that the name will protect the soul in its ascent through the heavens, conduct it safely through all hostile powers to the lower heavens, and procure it access to Horos, who frightens back the lower souls by his magic word. And for this life also baptism, in consequence of the pronouncing of the protecting name over the baptized person, accomplishes his liberation from the lower daemonic powers. Before baptism the \"Heimarmene\" is supreme, but after baptism the soul is free from her.\n\nWith baptism was also connected the anointing with oil, and hence we can also understand the death sacrament occurring among some Valentinians consisting in an anointing with a mixture of oil and water. This death sacrament has naturally the express object of assuring the soul the way to the highest heaven “so that the soul may be intangible and invisible to the higher mights and powers”. In this connection we also find a few formulae which are entrusted to the faithful, so that their souls may pronounce them on their journey upwards. One of these formulae runs:\nAnother formula is appended, in which there is a distinction in the invocation between the higher and lower Sophia. Another prayer of the same style is to be found in Irenaeus i. 13, and it is expressly stated that after prayer is pronounced the Mother throws the Homeric helmet (cf. the \"Tarnhelm\") over the faithful soul, and so makes him invisible to the mights and powers which surround and attack him.\n\nOn the other hand, a reaction took place here and there against the sacramental rites. A pure piety, rising above mere sacramentalism, breathes in the words of the Gnostics preserved in \"Excerpta ex Theodoto\", 78, 2:\nThe distinction between the human and divine Saviour was a major point of contention between the Valentinians and the Church. Valentinus separated Christ into three figures; the spiritual, the psychical and material. Each of the three Christ figures had its own meaning and purpose. They acknowledged that Christ suffered and died, but believed that “in his incarnation, Christ transcended human nature so that he could prevail over death by divine power”. These beliefs are what caused Irenaeus to say of the Valentinians, “Certainly they confess with their tongues the one Jesus Christ, but in their minds they divide him.” In one passage in the account of Irenaeus, it is directly stated that the redeemer assumed a psychical body to redeem the psychical, for the spiritual already belong by nature to the celestial world and no longer require any \"historical\" redemption, while the material is incapable of redemption, as “flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption”.\n\nMany Valentinian traditions and practices also clashed with those of the Church. They often met at unauthorized gatherings and rejected ecclesiastical authority, based on their belief that they were all equal. Members of the movement took turns administering sacraments, as well as preaching. Among the Valentinians, women were considered to be equal, or at least nearly equal to men. There were female prophets, teachers, healers, evangelists and even priests, which was very different from the Church's view of women at the time. Valentinians held normal jobs, got married and raised children just like Christians; however they regarded these pursuits as being less important than gnosis, which was to be achieved individually. The beliefs of the Valentinians were much more oriented towards the individual than the group, and salvation was not seen as being universal, as it was in the Church.\n\nThe main disagreements between the Valentinians and the Church were in the notions that God and the creator were two separate entities, the idea that the creator was flawed and formed man and Earth out of ignorance and confusion, and the separation of Christ's human form and divine form. Church authorities believed that Valentinian theology was “a wickedly casuistic way of subverting their authority and thereby threatening the ecclesiastical order with anarchy.” The practices and rituals of the Valentinians were also different from those of the Christian Church; however they considered themselves to be Christians and not pagans or heretics. By referring to themselves as Christians they worsened their relationship with the Church, who viewed them not only as heretics, but as rivals.\n\nAlthough the Valentinians publicly professed their faith in one God, “in their own private meetings they insisted on discriminating between the popular image of God – as master, king, lord, creator, and judge – and what that image represented: God understood as the ultimate source of all being.” Aside from the Church fathers, however, “the majority of Christians did not recognize the followers of Valentinus as heretics. Most could not tell the difference between Valentinian and orthodox teaching.” This was partially because Valentinus used many books that now belong to the Old and New Testaments as a basis for interpretation in his own writing. He based his work on proto-orthodox Christian canon instead of on Gnostic scripture, and his style was similar to that of early Christian works. In this way, Valentinus tried to bridge the gap between Gnostic religion and early Catholicism. By attempting to bridge this gap, however, Valentinus and his followers became the proverbial wolves in sheep's clothing. “The apparent similarity with orthodox teaching only made this heresy more dangerous – like poison disguised as milk.” Valentinian Gnosticism was “the most influential and sophisticated form of Gnostic teaching, and by far the most threatening to the church.”\n\nEarly Christianity has been described as “a complex network of individual parties, groups, sects, or denominations.” This inconsistency made Gnostic sects such as Valentinianism threatening to the proto-orthodox sect.\n\nValentinian works are named in reference to the bishop and teacher Valentinius. Circa 153 AD, Valentinius developed a complex cosmology outside the Sethian tradition. At one point he was close to being appointed the Bishop of Rome of what is now the Roman Catholic Church. Works attributed to his school are listed below, and fragmentary pieces directly linked to him are noted with an asterisk:\n\n\n\nAttribution:\n\n"}
