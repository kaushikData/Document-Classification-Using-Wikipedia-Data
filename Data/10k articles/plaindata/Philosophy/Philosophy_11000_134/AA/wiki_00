{"id": "38235255", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38235255", "title": "Affirmation and negation", "text": "Affirmation and negation\n\nIn linguistics and grammar, affirmation and negation (abbreviated respectively ' and ') are the ways that grammar encode negative and positive polarity in verb phrases, clauses, or other utterances. Essentially an affirmative (positive) form is used to express the validity or truth of a basic assertion, while a negative form expresses its falsity. Examples are the sentences \"Jane is here\" and \"Jane is not here\"; the first is affirmative, while the second is negative.\n\nThe grammatical category associated and with affirmative and negative is called polarity. This means that a sentence, verb phrase, etc. may be said to have either affirmative or negative polarity (its polarity may be either affirmative or negative). Affirmative is typically the unmarked polarity, whereas a negative statement is marked in some way, whether by a negating word or particle such as English \"not\", an affix such as Japanese -\"nai\", or by other means, which reverses the meaning of the predicate. The process of converting affirmative to negative is called negation – the grammatical rules for negation vary from language to language, and a given language may have more than one method of doing so.\n\nAffirmative and negative responses (especially, though not exclusively, to questions) are often expressed using particles or words such as \"yes\" and \"no\", where \"yes\" is the affirmative and \"no\" the negative particle.\n\nSpecial affirmative and negative words (particles) are often found in responses to questions, and sometimes to other assertions by way of agreement or disagreement. In English, these are \"yes\" and \"no\" respectively, in French \"oui\", \"si\" and \"non\", in Swedish \"ja\", \"jo\" and \"nej\", and so on. Not all languages make such common use of particles of this type; in some (such as Welsh) it is more common to repeat the verb or another part of the predicate, with or without negation accordingly.\n\nComplications sometimes arise in the case of responses to negative statements or questions; in some cases the response that confirms a negative statement is the negative particle (as in English: \"You're not going out? No.\"), but in some languages this is reversed. Some languages have a distinct form to answer a negative question, such as French \"si\" and Swedish \"jo\" (these serve to contradict the negative statement suggested by the first speaker).\n\nLanguages have a variety of grammatical rules for converting affirmative verb phrases or clauses into negative ones.\n\nIn many languages, an affirmative is made negative by the addition of a particle, meaning \"not\". This may be added before the verb phrase, as with the Spanish \"no\":\nOther examples of negating particles preceding the verb phrase include Italian \"non\", Russian не \"nye\" and Polish \"nie\" (they can also be found in constructed languages: \"ne\" in Esperanto and \"non\" in Interlingua). In some other languages the negating particle follows the verb or verb phrase, as in Dutch:\nParticles following the verb in this way include \"not\" in archaic and dialectal English (\"you remember not\"), \"nicht\" in German (\"ich schlafe nicht\", \"I am not sleeping\"), and \"inte\" in Swedish (\"han hoppade inte\", \"he did not jump\").\n\nIn French, particles are added both before the verb phrase (\"ne\") and after the verb (\"pas\"):\nHowever, in colloquial French the first particle is often omitted: \"Je sais pas\". Similar use of two negating particles can also be found in Afrikaans: \"Hy kan nie Afrikaans praat nie\" (\"He cannot speak Afrikaans\").\n\nIn standard Modern English, negation is achieved by adding \"not\" after an auxiliary verb (which here means one of a special grammatical class of verbs that also includes forms of the copula \"be\"; see English auxiliaries). If no such verb is present then the dummy auxiliary \"do\" (\"does\", \"did\") is introduced – see \"do\"-support. For example:\nDifferent rules apply in subjunctive, imperative and non-finite clauses. For more details see . (In Middle English, the particle \"not\" could follow any verb, e.g. \"I see not the horse.\")\n\nIn some languages, like Welsh, verbs have special inflections to be used in negative clauses. (In some language families, this may lead to reference to a negative mood.) An example is Japanese, which conjugates verbs in the negative after adding the suffix \"-nai\" (indicating negation), e.g. \"taberu\" (\"eat\") and \"tabenai\" (\"do not eat\"). It could be argued that English has joined the ranks of these languages, since negation requires the use of an auxiliary verb and a distinct syntax in most cases; the form of the basic verb can change on negation, as in \"he sings\" vs. \"he doesn't sing\". Zwicky and Pullum have shown that \"n't\" is an inflectional suffix, not a clitic or a derivational suffix.\n\nComplex rules for negation also apply in Finnish; see . In some languages negation may also affect the dependents of the verb; for example in some Slavic languages, such as Russian, the case of a direct object often changes from accusative to genitive when the verb is negated.\n\nNegation can be applied not just to whole verb phrases, clauses or sentences, but also to specific elements (such as adjectives and noun phrases) within sentences. Ways in which this can be done again depend on the grammar of the language in question. English generally places \"not\" before the negated element, as in \"I witnessed not a debate, but a war.\" There are also negating affixes, such as the English prefixes \"non-\", \"un-\", \"in-\", etc. Such elements are called privatives.\n\nThere also exist elements which carry a specialized negative meaning, including pronouns such as \"nobody\", \"none\" and \"nothing\", determiners such as \"no\" (as in \"no apples\"), and adverbs such as \"never\", \"no longer\" and \"nowhere\".\n\nAlthough such elements themselves have negative force, in some languages a clause in which they appear is additionally marked for ordinary negation. For example, in Russian, \"I see nobody\" is expressed as я никого́ не ви́жу \"ja nikovó nye vízhu\", literally \"I nobody not see\" – the ordinary negating particle не \"nye\" (\"not\") is used in addition to the negative pronoun никого́ \"nikovó\" (\"nobody\"). Italian behaves in a similar way: \"Non ti vede nessuno\", \"nobody can see you\", although \"Nessuno ti vede\" is also a possible clause with exactly the same meaning.\n\nIn Russian, all of the elements (\"not\", \"never\", \"nobody\", \"nowhere\") would appear together in the sentence in their negative form. In Italian, a clause works much as in Russian, but \"non\" does not have to be there, and can be there only before the verb if it precedes all other negative elements: \"Tu non porti mai nessuno da nessuna parte\". \"Nobody ever brings you anything here\", however, could be translated \"Nessuno qui ti porta mai niente\" or \"Qui non ti porta mai niente nessuno\". In French, where simple negation is performed using \"ne ... pas\" (see above), specialized negatives appear in combination with the first particle (\"ne\"), but \"pas\" is omitted:\nIn Ancient Greek, a simple negative (οὐ \"ou\" \"not\" or μή \"mḗ\" \"not (modal)\") following another simple or compound negative (e.g. οὐδείς \"oudeís\" \"nobody\") results in an affirmation, whereas a compound negative following a simple or compound negative strengthens the negation:\n\nSimple grammatical negation of a clause in principle has the effect of converting a proposition to its logical negation – replacing an assertion that something is the case by an assertion that it is not the case.\n\nIn some cases, however, particularly when a particular modality is expressed, the semantic effect of negation may be somewhat different. For example, in English, the meaning of \"you must not go\" is not in fact the exact negation of that of \"you must go\" – this would be expressed as \"you don't have to go\" or \"you needn't go\". The negation \"must not\" has a stronger meaning (the effect is to apply the logical negation to the following infinitive rather than to the full clause with \"must\"). For more details and other similar cases, see the relevant sections of English modal verbs.\n\nIn some cases, by way of irony, an affirmative statement may be intended to have the meaning of the corresponding negative, or vice versa. For examples see antiphrasis and sarcasm.\n\nFor the use of double negations or similar as understatements (\"not unappealing\", \"not bad\", etc.) see litotes.\n\n\n\n"}

Acts committed out of \"amour de soi\" tend to be for individual well-being. They are naturally good and not malicious because \"amour de soi\" as self-love does not involve pursuing one's self-interest at the expense of others. The sentiment does not compare oneself with others, but is concerned solely with regarding oneself as an absolute and valuable existence. It is related to an awareness of one's future and can restrain present impulse. Rousseau contrasts it with \"amour-propre\", that kind of self-love, found in Thomas Hobbes' philosophy, in which one's opinion of oneself is dependent on what other people think and which arises only with society.\n\nRousseau suggested that \"amour de soi\" was lost during the transition from the pre-societal condition to society, but it can be restored by the use of \"good\" institutions created with the social contract. This renewed passage from the state of nature to the civilized state, would bring man to favor justice instead of instinct.\n"}

They shared the argument that, because the proposition \"no-p is a not-p\" is not logically equivalent to \"It is thought that 'no-p is a not-p'\", psychologism does not logically stand. Psychologism was criticized in logic also by Charles Sanders Peirce whose fields included logic, philosophy, and experimental psychology, and generally in philosophy by Maurice Merleau-Ponty who held the chairs of philosophy and child psychology at the University of Paris.\n\nPsychologism is not widely held amongst logicians today, but it does have some high-profile defenders, for example Dov Gabbay.\n\n"}
{"id": "917868", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=917868", "title": "Comparative genomics", "text": "Comparative genomics\n\nComparative genomics is a field of biological research in which the genomic features of different organisms are compared. The genomic features may include the DNA sequence, genes, gene order, regulatory sequences, and other genomic structural landmarks. In this branch of genomics, whole or large parts of genomes resulting from genome projects are compared to study basic biological similarities and differences as well as evolutionary relationships between organisms. The major principle of comparative genomics is that common features of two organisms will often be encoded within the DNA that is evolutionarily conserved between them. Therefore, comparative genomic approaches start with making some form of alignment of genome sequences and looking for orthologous sequences (sequences that share a common ancestry) in the aligned genomes and checking to what extent those sequences are conserved. Based on these, genome and molecular evolution are inferred and this may in turn be put in the context of, for example, phenotypic evolution or population genetics.\n\nVirtually started as soon as the whole genomes of two organisms became available (that is, the genomes of the bacteria \"Haemophilus influenzae\" and \"Mycoplasma genitalium\") in 1995, comparative genomics is now a standard component of the analysis of every new genome sequence. With the explosion in the number of genome projects due to the advancements in DNA sequencing technologies, particularly the next-generation sequencing methods in late 2000s, this field has become more sophisticated, making it possible to deal with many genomes in a single study. Comparative genomics has revealed high levels of similarity between closely related organisms, such as humans and chimpanzees, and, more surprisingly, similarity between seemingly distantly related organisms, such as humans and the yeast \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\". It has also showed the extreme diversity of the gene\ncomposition in different evolutionary lineages.\n\n\"See also\": History of genomics\n\nComparative genomics has a root in the comparison of virus genomes in the early 1980s. For example, small RNA viruses infecting animals (picornaviruses) and those infecting plants (cowpea mosaic virus) were compared and turned out to share significant sequence similarity and, in part, the order of their genes. In 1986, the first comparative genomic study at a larger scale was published, comparing the genomes of varicella-zoster virus and Epstein-Barr virus that contained more than 100 genes each.\n\nThe first complete genome sequence of a cellular organism, that of \"Haemophilus influenzae\" Rd, was published in 1995. The second genome sequencing paper was of the small parasitic bacterium \"Mycoplasma genitalium\" published in the same year. Starting from this paper, reports on new genomes inevitably became comparative-genomic studies.\n\nThe first high-resolution whole genome comparison system was developed in 1998 by Art Delcher, Simon Kasif and Steven Salzberg and applied to the comparison of entire highly related microbial organisms with their collaborators at the Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR). The system is called MUMMER and was described in a publication in Nucleic Acids Research in 1999. The system helps researchers to identify large rearrangements, single base mutations, reversals, tandem repeat expansions and other polymorphisms. In bacteria, MUMMER enables the identification of polymorphisms that are responsible for virulence, pathogenicity, and anti-biotic resistance. The system was also applied to the Minimal Organism Project at TIGR and subsequently to many other comparative genomics projects.\n\n\"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\", the baker's yeast, was the first eukaryote to have its complete genome sequence published in 1996. After the publication of the roundworm \"Caenorhabditis elegans\" genome in 1998 and together with the fruit fly \"Drosophila melanogaster\" genome in 2000, Gerald M. Rubin and his team published a paper titled \"Comparative Genomics of the Eukaryotes\", in which they compared the genomes of the eukaryotes \"D. melanogaster\", \"C. elegans\", and \"S. cerevisiae\", as well as the prokaryote \"H. influenzae\". At the same time, Bonnie Berger, Eric Lander, and their team published a paper on whole-genome comparison of human and mouse.\n\nWith the publication of the large genomes of vertebrates in the 2000s, including human, the Japanese pufferfish \"Takifugu rubripes\", and mouse, precomputed results of large genome comparisons have been released for downloading or for visualization in a genome browser. Instead of undertaking their own analyses, most biologists can access these large cross-species comparisons and avoid the impracticality caused by the size of the genomes.\n\nNext-generation sequencing methods, which were first introduced in 2007, have produced an enormous amount of genomic data and have allowed researchers to generate multiple (prokaryotic) draft genome sequences at once. These methods can also quickly uncover single-nucleotide polymorphisms, insertions and deletions by mapping unassembled reads against a well annotated reference genome, and thus provide a list of possible gene differences that may be the basis for any functional variation among strains.\n\nOne character of biology is evolution, evolutionary theory is also the theoretical foundation of comparative genomics, and at the same time the results of comparative genomics unprecedentedly enriched and developed the theory of evolution. When two or more of the genome sequence are compared, one can deduce the evolutionary relationships of the sequences in a phylogenetic tree. Based on a variety of biological genome data and the study of vertical and horizontal evolution processes, one can understand vital parts of the gene structure and its regulatory function.\n\nSimilarity of related genomes is the basis of comparative genomics. If two creatures have a recent common ancestor, the differences between the two species genomes are evolved from the ancestors’ genome. The closer the relationship between two organisms, the higher the similarities between their genomes. If there is close relationship between them, then their genome will display a linear behaviour (synteny), namely some or all of the genetic sequences are conserved. Thus, the genome sequences can be used to identify gene function, by analyzing their homology (sequence similarity) to genes of known function.\n\nOrthologous sequences are related sequences in different species: a gene exists in the original species, the species divided into two species, so genes in new species are orthologous to the sequence in the original species. Paralogous sequences are separated by gene cloning (gene duplication): if a particular gene in the genome is copied, then the copy of the two sequences is paralogous to the original gene. A pair of orthologous sequences is called orthologous pairs (orthologs), a pair of paralogous sequence is called collateral pairs (paralogs). Orthologous pairs usually have the same or similar function, which is not necessarily the case for collateral pairs. In collateral pairs, the sequences tend to evolve into having different functions.\nComparative genomics exploits both similarities and differences in the proteins, RNA, and regulatory regions of different organisms to infer how selection has acted upon these elements. Those elements that are responsible for similarities between different species should be conserved through time (stabilizing selection), while those elements responsible for differences among species should be divergent (positive selection). Finally, those elements that are unimportant to the evolutionary success of the organism will be unconserved (selection is neutral).\n\nOne of the important goals of the field is the identification of the mechanisms of eukaryotic genome evolution. It is however often complicated by the multiplicity of events that have taken place throughout the history of individual lineages, leaving only distorted and superimposed traces in the genome of each living organism. For this reason comparative genomics studies of small model organisms (for example the model Caenorhabditis elegans and closely related Caenorhabditis briggsae) are of great importance to advance our understanding of general mechanisms of evolution.\n\nComputational approaches to genome comparison have recently become a common research topic in computer science. A public collection of case studies and demonstrations is growing, ranging from whole genome comparisons to gene expression analysis. This has increased the introduction of different ideas, including concepts from systems and control, information theory, strings analysis and data mining. It is anticipated that computational approaches will become and remain a standard topic for research and teaching, while multiple courses will begin training students to be fluent in both topics.\n\nComputational tools for analyzing sequences and complete genomes are developing quickly due to the availability of large amount of genomic data. At the same time, comparative analysis tools are progressed and improved. In the challenges about these analyses, it is very important to visualize the comparative results.\n\nVisualization of sequence conservation is a tough task of comparative sequence analysis. As we know, it is highly inefficient to examine the alignment of long genomic regions manually. Internet-based genome browsers provide many useful tools for investigating genomic sequences due to integrating all sequence-based biological information on genomic regions. When we extract large amount of relevant biological data, they can be very easy to use and less time-consuming.\n\n\nAn advantage of using online tools is that these websites are being developed and updated constantly. There are many new settings and content can be used online to improve efficiency.\n\nAgriculture is a field that reaps the benefits of comparative genomics. Identifying the loci of advantageous genes is a key step in breeding crops that are optimized for greater yield, cost-efficiency, quality, and disease resistance. For example, one genome wide association study conducted on 517 rice landraces revealed 80 loci associated with several categories of agronomic performance, such as grain weight, amylose content, and drought tolerance. Many of the loci were previously uncharacterized. Not only is this methodology powerful, it is also quick. Previous methods of identifying loci associated with agronomic performance required several generations of carefully monitored breeding of parent strains, a time consuming effort that is unnecessary for comparative genomic studies.\n\nThe medical field also benefits from the study of comparative genomics. Vaccinology in particular has experienced useful advances in technology due to genomic approaches to problems. In an approach known as reverse vaccinology, researchers can discover candidate antigens for vaccine development by analyzing the genome of a pathogen or a family of pathogens. Applying a comparative genomics approach by analyzing the genomes of several related pathogens can lead to the development of vaccines that are multiprotective. A team of researchers employed such an approach to create a universal vaccine for Group B Streptococcus, a group of bacteria responsible for severe neonatal infection. Comparative genomics can also be used to generate specificity for vaccines against pathogens that are closely related to commensal microorganisms. For example, researchers used comparative genomic analysis of commensal and pathogenic strains of E. coli to identify pathogen specific genes as a basis for finding antigens that result in immune response against pathogenic strains but not commensal ones.\n\nComparative genomics also opens up new avenues in other areas of research. As DNA sequencing technology has become more accessible, the number of sequenced genomes has grown. With the increasing reservoir of available genomic data, the potency of comparative genomic inference has grown as well. A notable case of this increased potency is found in recent primate research. Comparative genomic methods have allowed researchers to gather information about genetic variation, differential gene expression, and evolutionary dynamics in primates that were indiscernible using previous data and methods. The Great Ape Genome Project used comparative genomic methods to investigate genetic variation with reference to the six great ape species, finding healthy levels of variation in their gene pool despite shrinking population size. Another study showed that patterns of DNA methylation, which are a known regulation mechanism for gene expression, differ in the prefrontal cortex of humans versus chimps, and implicated this difference in the evolutionary divergence of the two species.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "18935258", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18935258", "title": "Doctrine", "text": "Doctrine\n\nDoctrine (from , meaning \"teaching\", \"instruction\" or \"doctrine\") is a codification of beliefs or a body of teachings or instructions, taught principles or positions, as the essence of teachings in a given branch of knowledge or in a belief system. The etymological Greek analogue is \"catechism\".\n\nOften the word \"doctrine\" specifically suggests a body of religious principles as promulgated by a church. \"Doctrine\" may also refer to a principle of law, in the common-law traditions, established through a history of past decisions, such as the doctrine of self-defense, or the principle of fair use, or the more narrowly applicable first-sale doctrine. Some organizations simply define \"doctrine\" as \"that which is taught\", or the basis for institutional teaching to its personnel of internal ways of operating.\n\nExamples of religious doctrines include:\n\nAccording to the sociologist Mervin Verbit, doctrine may be understood as one of the key components of religiosity, and doctrine itself may be divided into four categories:\n\nThe content of a doctrine may vary from one religion to the next, as will the degree to which it may occupy the person's mind (frequency), the intensity of the doctrine, and the centrality of the doctrine (in that religious tradition).\n\nIn this sense, doctrine is similar to Charles Glock's \"belief\" dimension of religiosity (Glock, 1972: 39).\n\nThe term also applies to the concept of an established procedure to a complex operation in warfare. The typical example is tactical doctrine in which a standard set of maneuvers, kinds of troops and weapons are employed as a default approach to a kind of attack.\n\nExamples of military doctrines include:\n\nAlmost every military organization has its own doctrine, sometimes written, sometimes unwritten. Some military doctrines are transmitted through training programs. More recently, in modern peacekeeping operations, which involve both civilian and military operations, more comprehensive (not just military) doctrines are now emerging such as the 2008 United Nations peacekeeping operations' \"Capstone Doctrine\" which speaks to integrated civilian and military operations.\n\nBy definition, political doctrine is \"[a] policy, position or principle advocated, taught or put into effect concerning the acquisition and exercise of the power to govern or administrate in society.\" The term political doctrine is sometimes wrongly identified with political ideology. However, doctrine lacks \"the actional aspect\" of ideology. It is mainly a theoretical discourse, which \"refers to a coherent sum of assertions regarding what a particular topic should be\" (Bernard Crick). Political doctrine is based on a rationally elaborated set of values, which may precede the formation of a political identity \"per se\". It is concerned with philosophical orientations on a \"meta-theoretical\" level.\n\nA legal doctrine is a body of inter-related rules (usually of common law and built over a long period of time) associated with a legal concept or principle. For example, the doctrine of frustration of purpose now has many tests and rules applicable with regards to each other and can be contained within a \"bubble\" of \"frustration\". In a court session a defendant may refer to the doctrine of justification.\n\nIt can be seen that a branch of law contains various doctrines, which in turn contain various \"rules\" or \"tests\". The test of \"non-occurrence of crucial event\" is part of the doctrine of \"frustration\" which is part of contract law. Doctrines can grow into a branch of law; restitution is now considered a branch of law separate to contract and tort.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "609066", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=609066", "title": "Edition (book)", "text": "Edition (book)\n\nThe bibliographical definition of an edition includes all copies of a book printed “from substantially the same setting of type,” including all minor typographical variants.\n\nThe numbering of book editions is a special case of the wider field of revision control. The traditional conventions for numbering book editions evolved spontaneously for several centuries before any greater applied science of revision control became important to humanity, which did not occur until the era of widespread computing had arrived (when software and electronic publishing came into existence). The old and new aspects of book edition numbering (from before and since the advent of computing) are discussed below. \n\nAccording to the definition of \"edition\" above, a book printed today, by the same publisher, and from the same type as when it was first published, is still the \"first edition\" of that book to a bibliographer. However, book collectors generally use the term \"first edition\" to mean specifically the first print run of the first edition (aka \"first edition, first impression\"). Since World War II, books often include a number line (printer's key) that indicates the print run.\n\nA \"first edition\" per se is not a valuable collectible book. A popular work may be published and reprinted over time by many publishers, and in a variety of formats. There will be a first edition of each, which the publisher may cite on the copyright page, such as: \"First mass market paperback edition\". The first edition of a facsimile reprint is the reprint publisher's first edition, but not the first edition of the work itself.\n\nThe Independent Online Booksellers Association has a A First Edition Primer which discusses several aspects of identifying first editions including publishing and specific publishers way of designating first editions.\n\nThe classic explanation of edition was given by Fredson Bowers in \"Principles of Bibliographical Description\" (1949). Bowers wrote that an edition is “the whole number of copies printed at any time or times from substantially the same setting of type-pages,” including “all issues and variant states existing within its basic type-setting, as well as all impressions.”\n\nPublishers often use the same typesetting for the hardcover and trade paperback versions of a book. These books have different covers, the title page and copyright page may differ, and the page margin sizes may differ (same \"type area\", smaller \"trim\"), but to a bibliographer they are the same edition.\n\nFrom time to time, readers may observe an error in the text (or, in the days of metal type, a piece of broken type), and report these to the publisher. The publisher typically keeps these \"reprint corrections\" in a file pending demand for a new print run of the edition, and before the new run is printed, they will be entered.\n\nThe method of entry, obviously, depends on the method of typesetting. For letterpress metal, it typically meant resetting a few characters or a line or two. For linotype, it meant casting a new line for any line with a change in it. With film, it involved cutting out a bit of the film and inserting a new bit. In an electronic file, it means entering the changes digitally.\n\nSuch minor changes do not constitute a new edition, but introduce typographical variations within an edition, which are of interest to collectors.\n\nA common complaint of book collectors is that the bibliographer's definition is used in a book-collecting context. For example, J. D. Salinger's \"The Catcher in the Rye\" remains in print in hardcover. The type is the same as the 1951 first printing, therefore all hardcover copies are, for the bibliographer, the first edition. Collectors would use the term for the first printing only.\n\nFirst edition most often refers to the first commercial publication of a work between its own covers, even if it was first printed in a periodical: the complete text of Ernest Hemingway’s \"The Old Man and the Sea\" appeared in the September 1, 1952 issue of \"Life\", yet the generally accepted “first” edition is the hardcover book Scribner’s published on September 8, 1952.\n\nThe term \"first trade edition,\" refers to the earliest edition of a book offered for sale to the general public in book stores. For example, Upton Sinclair's 1906 novel \"The Jungle\" was published in two variant forms. A \"Sustainers' Edition\", published by the Jungle Publishing Company, was sent to subscribers who had advanced funds to Sinclair. The first trade edition was published by Doubleday, Page to be sold in bookstores.\n\nMany book collectors place maximum value on the earliest bound copies of a book—promotional advance copies, bound galleys, uncorrected proofs, and advance reading copies sent by publishers to book reviewers and booksellers. It is true that these are rarer than the production copies; but given that these were not printed from a different setting of type (just the opposite; the main purpose of galleys and proofs is to double-check the typeset matter that will be used for production), they are not different editions.\n\nPublishers use \"first edition\" according to their own purposes, and consequently among them the designation is used very inconsistently. The \"first edition\" of a trade book may be the first iteration of the work printed by the publisher in question or the first iteration of the work that includes a specific set of illustrations or editorial commentary.\n\nPublishers of non-fiction, academic works, and textbooks generally distinguish between revisions of the text of the work, by typically citing the dates of the first and latest editions of the work in the copyright page. Exceptions to this rule of thumb include denominating as a \"second edition\" a new textbook that has a different format, title, and/or author(s) because a previous textbook that shares only the same subject matter as the \"second edition\" is considered the first edition. The reason for this stretch of the definition is often for the short-term marketing advantage of the new textbook, because, although first editions are often considered more valuable than later editions to book collectors, being a subsequent edition of a previous textbook gives the impression that the textbook denominated as a subsequent edition is more authoritative.\n\nPublishers sometimes denominate a new iteration of a work a \"revised edition\" or the \"(N)th edition, revised\" when the previous iteration has been editorially revised or updated yet the author or publisher does not want to denominate it the \"(N+1)th edition\" (\"N\" being the number of the previous edition) for some subjective reason. Conversely, a new iteration of a work that is not substantially different may be denominated a \"new edition\" or the \"(N+1)th edition\".\n\nThe qualitative difference between a \"revised edition\" and a \"new edition\" is subjective. This is analogous to the way that software publishers may denominate an iteration \"version 3.7\" and the subsequent updated iteration \"version 4\" instead of \"version 3.8\". The subjective judgment of the \"degree\" of the significance of the change made with the new iteration or the perceived marketing advantage of designating the new iteration as a specific number determines how the new iteration is numbered.\n\nTherefore, the designation \"revised edition\" does not designate any quality or quantity of revision with certainty.\n\nWhen a non-fiction book is first published it sometimes instigates more research on its subject. The author may determine that new information justifies the revision of the book. A new iteration of the book would be published as a new edition, which may be denominated a \"revised and updated edition\". However, as with the denomination of \"revised edition\", the use of \"revised and updated edition\" manifests only the subjective choice of the publisher, which may be different from the publisher of a previous \"revised edition\" of the same work.\n\nThe basic definition of a \"co-edition\" is when two publishing houses publish the same edition of a book (or equivalent versions of an edition, for example, translated versions), simultaneously or near-simultaneously, usually in different countries. English and American editions may differ in spelling, and they sometimes have different titles. Some examples:\n\nThe logic of co-editions has often been to use the existing distribution systems of the different publishers in each country rather than establishing new distribution systems.\n\nAdvancing IT and the globalization of publishing have been blurring the lines of what \"co-edition\" means. For example, anything published online is effectively published worldwide. Also, large multinational publishers now have existing distribution systems for their hardcopy books in many countries, so they don't need to partner with other companies. They may issue a book under a different imprint for each country, but the imprints are parts of the same parent corporation. The actual manufacturing of the books may be done in China regardless of where the copies will be sold.\n\nThe term \"e-dition\", a play on the \"e-\"for-electronic prefix, has been used by various publishers to refer to various ideas, which include:\n\nA library edition may appear to be the same as copies appearing in shops and almost certainly uses the same setting. However, the binding and hinges are made extra strong to allow for the greater wear and tear in library books. This is analogous to the \"police and taxi\" packages for automobiles, in which heavier brakes and other upgrades are made to withstand harsher-than-standard use and longer duty cycles.\n\nA popular book is sometimes re-issued under the imprint of a book club. Often it is a new setting and with cheaper paper and binding. Any photographic illustrations in the original are either absent or reduced in number. Book club editions are sold to members at a good discount compared with the original issue price.\n\nAfter a book has exhausted the market at the high original price a publisher may issue a cheap edition themselves or sell the rights on to another publisher who will produce the book. A cheap edition typically uses a low-cost paper and is a paperback but they can be hardback. Also typically the size of the font is reduced to fit more words on a page to reduce the overall cost of the book. Naturally, for a cheap edition the author will receive a lower royalty but that may be compensated for by a greater volume of sales.\n\nDuring the peak of the British Empire, cheap editions of novels published in Britain would often be produced for sale in the colonies before other editions of the books were sold. The rationale was that books took a long time to export to the colonies, that readership in those settlements was avid, and that books were an effective means to disseminate British values. Australia was by far the largest consumer of colonial editions. Macmillan (London) published the largest number of colonial edition titles. They began in 1843 and persisted (in terms of pricing and trade) until the 1970s.\n\nA cadet edition is a cut down version of a book which is more simply written. It is intended for young readers rather than adults.\n\nThese editions are typically library editions but the font size of the text is much larger than usual so that persons with poor eyesight (often older persons) can more easily read the book. The large print books tend to be of a uniform size.\n\nA critical edition is a scholarly publication, containing commentary, critique, and sometimes a full developmental history of the work from all available sources.\n\nA batch of identical copies of an iteration/edition of a work that is printed in the same, single execution of the production set-up is denominated a \"print run\", \"printing run\", \"printing\", \"impression\", or \"press run\" according to the subjective choice of the publisher. All these denominations denote the action of applying pressure to paper in order to produce the book, and therefore are interchangeable. One edition of a work may have any number of printings, e. g. first edition, first impression; first edition, second impression; and second edition, first impression. Books that sell poorly may have only one. Very successful books may have 50 or more. If present, the printer's key in the copyright page of a book can be used to identify the number of the printing in which it was produced. In printmaking, however, an \"impression\" only denotes an individual copy of a specific printing of the work.\n\nA publisher hopes to recoup a large amount of the initial costs of publishing a book from the sale of the copies/impressions produced in the first printing of the book. A variety of commercial and logistic factors are thus considered in deciding the number of books to be produced in a specific printing and their individual price.\n\nDemand for additional printings after the first is always hoped for, because they increase a book's profitability. Once the fixed costs of developing, editing, typesetting, etc. have been covered by the revenue of the first sales, any additional revenue tends to add to the profit margin, minus, of course, the costs of the additional materials, printing, binding, and distribution.\n\nSometimes a printing will be unsatisfactory for various reasons, especially printings of artistic and photography books in which the quality of reproduction is paramount. A defective printing is usually destroyed by being pulped, yet occasionally a defective printing is shipped to a distant overseas market and there sold cheaply, contingent on the costs of shipping.\n\nIf sales of a book do not meet expectations, the remaining stock of a printing will be remaindered. When all copies/impressions of a printing are sold, the book is either reprinted or becomes out of print. Some print on demand and e-book publishers keep all their books perpetually \"in print\".\n\nA \"second\" is an imperfect or damaged copy/impression which is set aside from the other copies/impressions of a printing. These will usually have their dust jacket clipped or marked in some way to designate their inferiority.\n\nSometimes readers may observe an error in the text of a book and report it to the publisher. The publisher usually records these reprint corrections in a file pending demand for a new printing, before which they are incorporated into the revised text. This is one of the factors that inserts the \"substantially\" into the definition of \"substantially the same setting of type\".\n\nMany commercially successful books have been republished, either by their original or other imprints. For this reason if a popular book is searched for in a large bookseller such as Amazon.com or a large library catalog such as WorldCat, often an array of different copyright years, publishers, editions, formats (hardcover, softcover, trade, and mass market), and so forth are observed. Because no universal authority or convention determines the exact distinction between a \"reprinting\" and \"republishing\" and whether a republishing is a different \"edition\", the denotation of such denominations is ambiguous, at least at first glance.\n\nSince 1956, typographical arrangements of published editions are protected by copyright law. \"Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988\" defines a published edition to mean \"a published edition of the whole or any part of one or more literary, dramatic or musical works\".\n\nIt thus protects the publisher's investment in typesetting, as well as the processes of design and selection that are reflected in the appearance of the text. It also covers modern editions of public domain works (such as the complete works of Shakespeare), and prohibits the reproduction of the layout (but not the work itself).\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2858505", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2858505", "title": "Environmental vegetarianism", "text": "Environmental vegetarianism\n\nEnvironmental vegetarianism is the practice of vegetarianism or eating a plant-based diet based on the indications that animal-based industries are environmentally destructive or unsustainable. The primary environmental concerns with animal products are pollution—including greenhouse gas emissions (GHG)—deforestation, and the use of resources such as fossil fuels, water, and land.\n\nFour-fifths of agricultural emissions arise from the livestock sector.\n\nEstimates on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions attributable to animal products range from 18% to 51% of total global emissions.\n\nHowever, a PNAS model showed that even if animals were completely removed from U.S. agriculture and diets, U.S. GHG emissions would be decreased by 2.6% only (or 28% of agricultural GHG emissions). This is because of the need replace animal manures by fertilizers and to replace also other animal coproducts, and because livestock now use human-inedible food and fiber processing byproducts. Moreover, people would suffer from a greater number of deficiencies in essential nutrients although they would get a greater excess of energy, possibly leading to greater obesity.\n\nA 2017 study published in the journal \"Carbon Balance and Management\" found animal agriculture's global methane emissions are 11% higher than previous estimates based on data from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\nA study in \"Climate Change\" concluded \"if ... average diets among UK adults conformed to WHO recommendations, their associated GHG emissions would be reduced by 17 %. Further GHG emission reductions of around 40% could be achieved by making realistic modifications to diets so that they contain fewer animal products and processed snacks and more fruit, vegetables and cereals.\"\n\nAccording to the 2006 Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) report \"Livestock's Long Shadow\", animal agriculture contributes on a \"massive scale\" to global warming, air pollution, land degradation, energy use, deforestation, and biodiversity decline. The FAO report estimates that the livestock (including poultry) sector (which provides draft animal power, leather, wool, milk, eggs, fertilizer, pharmaceuticals, etc., in addition to meat) contributes about 18 percent of global GHG emissions expressed as 100-year CO equivalents. This estimate was based on life-cycle analysis, including feed production, land use changes, etc., and used GWP (global warming potential) of 23 for methane and 296 for nitrous oxide, to convert emissions of these gases to 100-year CO equivalents. The FAO report concluded that \"the livestock sector emerges as one of the top two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems, at every scale from local to global\".\n\nSome sources disagree with some of the figures used in arriving at the FAO estimate of 18 percent. For example, the FAO report estimates that 37 percent of global anthropogenic methane emissions are attributable to the livestock sector, and a NASA summary indicates about 30 percent. Because of the GWP multiplier used, such a difference between estimates will have a large effect on an estimate of GHG CO equivalents contributed by the livestock sector. Livestock sources (including enteric fermentation and manure) account for about 3.1 percent of US anthropogenic GHG emissions expressed as CO equivalents. This estimate is based on methodologies agreed to by the Conference of Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. \n\nA 2010 report from the United Nations Environment Programme's (UNEP) International Panel of Sustainable Resource Management stated:\n\nImpacts from agriculture are expected to increase substantially due to population growth and increasing consumption of animal products. Unlike fossil fuels, it is difficult to look for alternatives: people have to eat. A substantial reduction of impacts would only be possible with a substantial worldwide diet change, away from animal products.\n\nAccording to Cornell University scientists: \"The heavy dependence on fossil energy suggests that the US food system, whether meat-based or plant-based, is not sustainable\". However, they also write: \"The meat-based food system requires more energy, land, and water resources than the lactoovovegetarian diet. In this limited sense, the lactoovovegetarian diet is more sustainable than the average American meat-based diet.\" One of these Cornell scientists has advised that the US could feed 800 million people with grain that livestock eat. He \"depicted grain-fed livestock farming as a costly and nonsustainable way to produce animal protein\", but \"distinguished grain-fed meat production from pasture-raised livestock, calling cattle-grazing a more reasonable use of marginal land\".\n\nAccording to a 2002 paper:\n\nThe industrial agriculture system consumes fossil fuel, water, and topsoil at unsustainable rates. It contributes to numerous forms of environmental degradation, including air and water pollution, soil depletion, diminishing biodiversity, and fish die-offs. Meat production contributes disproportionately to these problems, in part because feeding grain to livestock to produce meat—instead of feeding it directly to humans—involves a large energy loss, making animal agriculture more resource intensive than other forms of food production. ... One personal act that can have a profound impact on these issues is reducing meat consumption. To produce 1 pound of feedlot beef requires about 2,400 gallons of water and 7 pounds of grain (42). Considering that the average American consumes 97 pounds of beef (and 273 pounds of meat in all) each year, even modest reductions in meat consumption in such a culture would substantially reduce the burden on our natural resources.\n\nA 2003 paper published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, after calculating effects on energy, land, and water use, concluded that meat-based diets require more resources and are less sustainable than lacto-ovo vegetarian diets. \"The water required for a meat-eating diet is twice as much needed for a 2,000-litre-a-day vegetarian diet\".\n\nAnother agricultural effect is on land degradation. Cattle are a known cause for soil erosion through trampling of the ground and overgrazing. Much of the world's crops are used to feed animals. With 30 percent of the earth's land devoted to raising livestock, a major cutback is needed to keep up with growing population. Demand for meat is expected to double by 2050; in China, for example, where vegetable-based diets were once the norm, demand for meat will continue to be great in absolute terms, even though demand growth will slow. As countries are developing, incomes are increasing, and consumption of animal products is associated with prosperity. This growing demand is unsustainable.\n\nThe environmental impacts of animal production vary with the method of production. A grazing-based production can limit soil erosion and also allow farmers to control pests with less pesticides by rotating crops with grass. However, in arid areas, this may catalyze a desertification process. The ability of soil to absorb water by infiltration is important for minimizing runoff and soil erosion. Researchers in Iowa reported that a soil under perennial pasture grasses grazed by livestock was able to absorb far more water than the same kind of soil under two annual crops: corn and soybeans. Corn and soybean crops commonly provide food for human consumption, biofuels, livestock feed, or some combination of these.\n\nAnimal production has a large impact on water pollution and usage. According to the Water Education Foundation, it takes 2,464 gallons of water to produce one pound of beef in California, whereas it takes only 25 gallons of water to produce one pound of wheat. Raising a large amount of livestock creatives a massive amount of manure and urine, which can pollute natural resources by changing the pH of water, contaminates the air, and emits a major amount of gas that directly affects global warming. As most livestock are raised in small confined spaces to cut down on cost, this increases the problem of concentrated waste. Livestock in the United States produces 2.7 trillion pounds of manure each year, which is ten times more than what is produced by the entire U.S. population. There are issues with how animal waste is disposed, as some is used as fertilizer while some farmers create manure lagoons which store millions of gallons of animal waste which is extremely unsafe and detrimental to the environment.\n\nIn November 2017, 15,364 world scientists signed a Warning to Humanity calling for, among other things, drastically diminishing our per capita consumption of meat. A May 2018 study stated that while wildlife has been decimated since the dawn of human civilization, with wild mammals plummeting by 83%, livestock populations reared by humans for consumption have increased. Livestock make up 60% of the biomass of all mammals on earth, followed by humans (36%) and wild mammals (4%). As for birds, 70% are domesticated, such as poultry, whereas only 30% are wild.\n\nAccording to a 2018 study published in \"Science\", global meat consumption is set to increase as the result of human population growth and rising affluence, which will increase carbon emissions and further reduce biodiversity. A 2018 report in \"Nature\" found that a significant reduction in meat consumption is necessary to mitigate climate change, especially as the population rises to a projected 10 billion in the coming decades.\n\nEnvironmental vegetarianism can be compared with economic vegetarianism. An economic vegetarian is someone who practices vegetarianism either out of necessity or because of a conscious simple living strategy. Such a person may base this belief on a philosophical viewpoint, such as the belief that the consumption of meat is economically unsound or that vegetarianism will help improve public health, lead to global food security, and curb starvation.\n\nEnvironmental vegetarians call for a reduction of first world consumption of meat, especially in the US. According to the United Nations Population Fund, \"Each U.S. citizen consumes an average of 260 lbs. of meat per year, the world's highest rate. That is about 1.5 times the industrial world average, three times the East Asian average, and 40 times the average in Bangladesh.\" In addition, \"the ecological footprint of an average person in a high-income country is about six times bigger than that of someone in a low-income country, and many more times bigger than in the least-developed countries\".\n\nThe World Health Organization calls malnutrition \"the silent emergency\", and says that it is a factor in at least half of the 10.4 million child deaths which occur every year.\nSome argue that the adoption of an ovo-lacto vegetarian or entirely plant-based vegan diet is best, but may not be totally necessary, because even modest reductions in meat consumption in industrialized societies would substantially reduce the burden on natural resources. For developed countries, a CAST report estimates an average of 2.6 pounds of grain feed per pound of beef carcass meat produced. For developing countries, the estimate is 0.3 pounds per pound. (Some very dissimilar figures are sometimes seen; the CAST report discusses common sources of error and discrepancies among such figures.) In 2007, US per capita beef consumption was 62.2 pounds per year, and US per capita meat (red meat plus fish plus poultry) consumption totaled 200.7 pounds (boneless trimmed weight basis).\n\nBill Mollison has argued in his Permaculture Design Course that vegetarianism exacerbates soil erosion. This is because removing a plant from a field removes all the nutrients it obtained from the soil, while removing an animal leaves the field intact. On US farmland, much less soil erosion is associated with pastureland used for livestock grazing than with land used for production of crops. Robert Hart has also developed forest gardening, which has since been adopted as a common permaculture design element, as a sustainable plant-based food production system.\n\nSome environmental activists claim that adopting a vegetarian diet may be a way of focusing on personal actions and righteous gestures rather than systemic change. Environmentalist Dave Riley states that \"being meatless and guiltless seems seductively simple while environmental destruction rages around us\", and notes that Mollison \"insists that vegetarianism drives animals from the edible landscape so that their contribution to the food chain is lost\".\n\nOthers assert that \"the vegan diet wastes available land that could otherwise be used to feed more people\", but still conclude that a dairy-friendly vegetarian diet is the most sustainable when compared to 9 other diets, some more influenced by vegetarianism than others.\n\n"}

{"id": "12393", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12393", "title": "Gaia philosophy", "text": "Gaia philosophy\n\nGaia philosophy (named after Gaia, Greek goddess of the Earth) is a broadly inclusive term for related concepts that living organisms on a planet will affect the nature of their environment in order to make the environment more suitable for life. This set of theories holds that all organisms on a life-giving planet regulate the biosphere in such a way as to promote its habitability. Gaia concept draws a connection between the survivability of a species (hence its evolutionary course) and its usefulness to the survival of other species.\n\nWhile there were a number of precursors to Gaia theory, the first scientific form of this idea was proposed as the Gaia hypothesis by James Lovelock, a UK chemist, in 1970. The Gaia hypothesis deals with the concept of biological homeostasis, and claims the resident life forms of a host planet coupled with their environment have acted and act like a single, self-regulating system. This system includes the near-surface rocks, the soil, and the atmosphere. Today many scientists consider such ideas to be unsupported by, or at odds with, the available evidence (see recent criticism). These theories are however significant in green politics.\n\nThere are some mystical, scientific and religious predecessors to the Gaia philosophy, which had a Gaia-like conceptual basis. Many religious mythologies had a view of Earth as being a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts (e.g. some Native American religions and various forms of shamanism).\n\nLewis Thomas believed that Earth should be viewed as a single cell; he derived this view from Johannes Kepler's view of Earth as a single round organism.\n\nIsaac Newton wrote of the earth, \"Thus this Earth resembles a great animall or rather inanimate vegetable, draws in æthereall breath for its dayly refreshment & vitall ferment & transpires again with gross exhalations, And according to the condition of all other things living ought to have its times of beginning youth old age & perishing.\"\n\nPierre Teilhard de Chardin, a paleontologist and geologist, believed that evolution unfolded from cell to organism to planet to solar system and ultimately the whole universe, as we humans see it from our limited perspective. Teilhard later influenced Thomas Berry and many Catholic humanist thinkers of the 20th century.\n\nBuckminster Fuller is generally credited with making the idea respectable in Western scientific circles in the 20th century. Building to some degree on his observations and artifacts, e.g. the Dymaxion map of the Earth he created, others began to ask if there was a way to make the Gaia theory scientifically sound.\n\nOberon Zell-Ravenheart in 1970 in an article in \"Green Egg\" Magazine, independently articulated the Gaia Thesis.\n\nNone of these ideas are considered scientific hypotheses; by definition a scientific hypothesis must make testable predictions. As the above claims are not testable, they are outside the bounds of current science.\n\nThese are conjectures and perhaps can only be considered as social and maybe political philosophy; they may have implications for theology, or \"thealogy\" as Zell-Ravenheart and Isaac Bonewits put it.\n\nAccording to James Kirchner there is a spectrum of Gaia hypotheses, ranging from the undeniable to radical. At one end is the undeniable statement that the organisms on the Earth have radically altered its composition. A stronger position is that the Earth's biosphere effectively acts as if it is a self-organizing system which works in such a way as to keep its systems in some kind of equilibrium that is conducive to life. Today many scientists consider that such a view (and any stronger views) are unlikely to be correct. An even stronger claim is that all lifeforms are part of a single planetary being, called Gaia. In this view, the atmosphere, the seas, the terrestrial crust would be the result of interventions carried out by Gaia, through the coevolving diversity of living organisms.\n\nThe most extreme form of Gaia theory is that the entire Earth is a single unified organism with a highly intelligent mind that arose as an emergent property of the whole biosphere. In this view, the Earth's biosphere is \"consciously\" manipulating the climate in order to make conditions more conducive to life. Scientists contend that there is no evidence at all to support this last point of view, and it has come about because many people do not understand the concept of homeostasis. Many non-scientists instinctively and incorrectly see homeostasis as a process that requires conscious control .\n\nThe more speculative versions of Gaia, including versions in which it is believed that the Earth is actually conscious, sentient, and highly intelligent, are usually considered outside the bounds of what is usually considered science.\n\nBuckminster Fuller has been credited as the first to incorporate scientific ideas into a Gaia theory, which he did with his Dymaxion map of the Earth.\n\nThe first scientifically rigorous theory was the Gaia hypothesis by James Lovelock, a UK chemist.\n\nA variant of this hypothesis was developed by Lynn Margulis, a microbiologist, in 1979.\nHer version is sometimes called the \"Gaia Theory\" (note uppercase-T). Her model is more limited in scope than the one that Lovelock proposed.\n\nWhether this sort of system is present on Earth is still open to debate. Some relatively simple homeostatic mechanisms are generally accepted. For example, when atmospheric carbon dioxide levels rise, plants are able to grow better and thus remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Other biological effects and feedbacks exist, but the extent to which these mechanisms have stabilized and modified the Earth's overall climate is largely not known.\n\nThe Gaia hypothesis is sometimes viewed from significantly different philosophical perspectives. Some environmentalists view it as an almost conscious process, in which the Earth's ecosystem is literally viewed as a single unified organism. Some evolutionary biologists, on the other hand, view it as an undirected emergent property of the ecosystem: as each individual species pursues its own self-interest, their combined actions tend to have counterbalancing effects on environmental change. Proponents of this view sometimes point to examples of life's actions in the past that have resulted in dramatic change rather than stable equilibrium, such as the conversion of the Earth's atmosphere from a reducing environment to an oxygen-rich one.\n\nDepending on how strongly the case is stated, the hypothesis conflicts with mainstream neo-Darwinism. Most biologists would accept Daisyworld-style homeostasis as possible, but would certainly not accept the idea that this equates to the whole biosphere acting as one organism.\n\nA very small number of scientists, and a much larger number of environmental activists, claim that Earth's biosphere is \"consciously\" manipulating the climate in order to make conditions more conducive to life. Scientists contend that there is no evidence to support this belief.\n\nA social science view of Gaia theory is the role of humans as a keystone species who may be able to accomplish global homeostasis. Whilst a few social scientists who draw inspiration from 'organic' views of society have embraced Gaia philosophy as a way to explain the human-nature interconnections, most professional social scientists are more involved in reflecting upon the way Gaia philosophy is used and engaged with within sub-sections of society. Alan Marshall, in the Department of Social Sciences at Mahidol University, for example, reflects upon the way Gaia philosophy has been used and advocated by environmentalists, spiritualists, managers, economists, and scientists and engineers (see The Unity of Nature, 2002, Imperial College Press: London and Singapore). Social Scientists themselves in the 1960s gave up on systems ideas of society since they were interpreted as supporting conservatism and traditionalism.\n\nSome radical political environmentalists who accept some form of the Gaia theory call themselves Gaians. They actively seek to restore the Earth's homeostasis — whenever they see it out of balance, e.g. to prevent manmade climate change, primate extinction, or rainforest loss. In effect, they seek to cooperate to become the \"system consciously manipulating to make conditions more conducive to life\". Such activity defines the homeostasis, but for leverage it relies on deep investigation of the homeorhetic balances, if only to find places to intervene in a system which is changing in undesirable ways.\n\nTony Bondhus brings up the point in his book, \"Society of Conceivia\", that if Gaia is alive, then societies are living things as well. This suggests that our understanding of Gaia can be used to create a better society and to design a better political system.\n\nOther intellectuals in the environmental movement, like Edward Goldsmith, have used Gaia in the completely opposite way; to stake a claim about how Gaia's focus on natural balance and resistance and resilience, should be emulated to design a conservative political system (as explored in Alan Marshall's 2002 book \"The Unity of Nature\", (Imperial College Press: London).\n\nGaians do not passively ask \"what is going on\", but rather, \"what to do next\", e.g. in terraforming or climate engineering or even on a small scale, such as gardening. Changes can be planned, agreed upon by many people, being very deliberate, as in urban ecology and especially industrial ecology. \"See arcology for more on this 'active' view.\"\n\nGaians argue that it is a human duty to act as such - committing themselves in particular to the Precautionary Principle. Such views began to influence the Green Parties, Greenpeace, and a few more radical wings of the environmental movement such as the Gaia Liberation Front and the Earth Liberation Front. These views dominate some such groups, e.g. the Bioneers. Some refer to this political activity as a separate and radical branch of the ecology movement, one that takes the axioms of the science of ecology in general, and Gaia theory in particular, and raises them to a kind of theory of personal conduct or moral code.\n\nThe ecologist and theologian Anne Primavesi is the author of two books dealing with the Gaia hypothesis and theology.\n\nRosemary Radford Ruether, the American feminist scholar and theologian, wrote a book called \"Gaia and God: An Ecofeminist Theology of Earth Healing\".\n\nA book edited by Allan Hunt Badiner called Dharma Gaia explores the ground where Buddhism and ecology meet through writings by the Dalai Lama, Gary Snyder, Thich Nhat Hanh, Allen Ginsberg, Joanna Macy, Robert Aitken, and 25 other Buddhists and ecologists.\n\nMany new age authors have written books which mix New Age teachings with Gaia philosophy. This is known as New Age Gaian. Often referred to as Gaianism, or the Gaian Religion, this spiritual aspect of the philosophy is very broad and inclusive, making it adaptable to other religions: Taoism, Neo-Paganism, Pantheism, Judeo-Christian Religions, and many others.\n\nThe question of \"what is an organism\", and at what scale is it rational to speak about organisms vs. biospheres, gives rise to a semantic debate. We are all ecologies in the sense that our (human) bodies contain gut bacteria, parasite species, etc., and to them our body is not organism but rather more of a microclimate or biome. Applying that thinking to whole planets:\n\nThe argument is that these symbiotic organisms, being unable to survive apart from each other and their climate and local conditions, form an organism in their own right, under a wider conception of the term organism than is conventionally used. It is a matter for often heated debate whether this is a valid usage of the term, but ultimately it appears to be a semantic dispute. In this sense of the word organism, it is argued under the theory that the entire biomass of the Earth is a single organism (as Johannes Kepler thought).\n\nUnfortunately, many supporters of the various Gaia theories do not state exactly where they sit on this spectrum; this makes discussion and criticism difficult.\n\nMuch effort on behalf of those analyzing the theory currently is an attempt to clarify what these different hypotheses are, and whether they are proposals to 'test' or 'manipulate' outcomes. Both Lovelock's and Margulis's understanding of Gaia are considered scientific hypotheses, and like all scientific theories are constantly put to the test.\n\nMore speculative versions of Gaia, including all versions in which it is held that the Earth is actually conscious, are currently held to be outside the bounds of science, and are not supported by either Lovelock or Margulis.\n\nOne of the most problematic issues with referring to Gaia as an organism is its apparent failure to meet the biological criterion of being able to reproduce. Richard Dawkins has asserted that the planet is not the offspring of any parents and is unable to reproduce.\n\n\n\n"}

The Catholic Church considered him immoral and a lover of heretical writings and he found himself put on trial by the Inquisition. Fleeing first to Geneva to escape their wrath, he soon converted to Protestantism while in Heidelberg.\n\nHis academic career was wide and varied, as he became an itinerant figure. In Geneva, he was elected as a public professor, and taught from 1575 to 1585. Studious and having a deep knowledge of Greek, he translated Aristotle. He taught law at the University of Heidelberg, from 1585 to 1594. Incidentally, while he was at Heidelberg, his quarrels with compatriot Scipione Gentili ultimately compelled the latter to leave for Altdorf. Also while there he showed his Ramist sympathies, but came into conflict with the philosophical faculty for trying to give private tuition in Ramist logic. After spending 1595 teaching logic at the Academy of Sedan, he was provost and prefect of studies at the University of Nimes, from 1597 to 1600. He also taught philosophy in Hungary, Leiden in the Netherlands, Grenoble in France, and in other places. At the University of Montpellier, where he was from 1600 to 1616, Nicolas Claude Fabri de Peiresc was his pupil.

This work is seen as exceptional among its contemporaries as it does not digress into alchemy, cabalism, or magic, and in fact stays true to Llull's traditional interests. Pace wrote a similar work for Ramus as well.\n\nDespite being a Protestant, in 1619 he published \"De dominio maris Hadriatici dissertatio\", defending the claims of the Venetian Republic to dominion over the Adriatic Sea, against the opposite claims of the Empire and the Kingdom of Naples. This controversy in early international law lined him up with Paolo Sarpi, against Valenzuela Velázquez and Lorenzo Motino.\n\nA book was written on the life of Giulio Pace in the early 20th century, focusing on his work as a jurist.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "834628", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=834628", "title": "Godfrey of Fontaines", "text": "Godfrey of Fontaines\n\nGodfrey of Fontaines (born sometime before 1250, died October 29 in 1306 or 1309). His name in Latin was Godefridus de Fontibus, and was a scholastic philosopher and theologian, designated by the title Doctor Venerandus. He made contributions to a diverse range of subjects ranging from moral philosophy to epistemology. However, he is best known today for his work on metaphysics.\n\nGodfrey was born sometime before 1250 in the principality of Liège in present-day Belgium. He was likely born at Fontaines-les-Hozémont, a château owned by his noble family.\n\nGodfrey was a student at the University of Paris by at least 1277, but more probably as early as 1270, as he was likely there during the second regency of Thomas Aquinas (1269-1272) who had returned to Paris from the Santa Sabina \"studium provinciale\". Aquinas' teaching was perhaps the strongest influence on Godfrey's own thought, though he differed on issues such as the principle of individuation, and the distinction between essence and existence in material things. A notebook from his student years has been dated around 1271-1274 demonstrating his familiarity with views “proposed by Siger of Brabant and Boethius of Dacia, leading representatives of the radical Aristotelian movement in the Arts faculty at the time.\n\nHe was a \"Magister\", or Master of Theology at the University of Paris by at least 1285 because that is when he gave his first Quodlibet, which means had earned his Magister regens in Theology by this time and because one would have to be at least thirty-five for this honor, this offers the reasoning that his birthday is 1250 or earlier for his year of birth. He was Magister regens from 1285–1299 and then again in 1303-1304. Godfrey was held in high esteem during his life, and held a number of ecclesiastical offices, including Canon of Liege, Canon of Tournai, Provost of St. Severin in Cologne (1287–1295), and possibly Canon of Paris. In 1300 he was chosen to be the Bishop of Tournai, but he chose not to take the position due to a contested election. Godfrey left Paris between his final Quodlibet in 1298-1299 - 1303/1304 yet returned before he died on October 29, 1306 or 1309. He had compiled a large library during his lifetime, which he donated to the Sorbonne upon his death, a portion of which is still intact.\n\nThe most significant of Godfrey's writings are transcriptions of Quodlibets, for which he participated in fifteen of during his tenure at the University of Paris. These were week-long sessions held before Christmas and Easter in which participating Masters were required to answer questions chosen by their students. This was taxing to the Master, who would have to argue a thoughtful and researched answer on an incredibly diverse range of subjects. Many Masters chose not to engage in the Quodlibets. Godfrey of Fontaines completed at least fifteen Quodlibetal sessions. Hence, Godfrey discussed a very wide range of issues. These and other writings show him to have been not merely a distinguished theologian and philosopher, but also a canonist, jurist, moralist, and conversationalist, who took an active part in the various ecclesiastical, doctrinal, and disciplinary disputes that stirred Paris at that period.\n\nGodfrey was reportedly influenced by Thomas Aquinas, and was a defender of Thomism against his contemporaries. Thomism was a novel theory at the time, and was condemned by Étienne Tempier, Bishop of Paris (Condemnation of 1277), and opposed by John Peckham and many others. This is despite Godfrey attacking the mendicant orders throughout his career, whereas Aquinas was a member of the Dominican mendicant order. Wippel says, Godfrey opposed the Mendicant orders for the belief that, \"those who had confessed to mendicants by reason of the privileges granted to the latter by Pope Martin's bull were still bound to confess the same sins once again to their own priests.\"\n\nOne of Godfrey's largest contributions were to the field of metaphysics. He was opposed to platonic arguments advanced from his contemporaries, such as Henry of Ghent. For example, he argued against the concept of platonic ideal forms, and that something's essential substance and existence were one and the same. His philosophy was strongly influenced by Aristotle.\n\nIn the Quodlibetal VIII, Godfrey argues against the Franciscan Christian order and lays an early groundwork of political philosophy where he discusses the ideas of natural rights. Godfrey believed that natural law was dependent on individual self-preservation rather than a religious obligation; he says, “because by natural law each person is obliged to maintain his life…each person has dominion and a certain right in the common exterior goods of this world, a right that he cannot licitly renounce”, says author Jussi Varkemma as noted in Conrad Summenhart’s Theory of Individual Rights. He objects that the fundamental Franciscan approach to rights is illicit to human activity and natural rights. He says later that everyone has a right to subsistence - a right that people can never renounce. This applies to the mendicant orders because it applies to all members of society.\n\nStephen D. Dumont quotes Godfrey, in the book Philosophical Debates at Paris in the Early 14th Century, that “Medieval sources are nearly unanimous in identifying Godfrey as a prominent source for the unusual but very influential account of intention and remission known as the ‘succession of forms.\" As explained by Dumont, Intension and remission of forms concerns the problem of a change of degree within a given kind of quality, like the shading of a color, adjustment of heat or even the altering of moral or cognitive habits. Godfrey held the position that all specific forms are “in their nature indivisible, invariable, and lacking in degrees” (43) and “the specific form of a quality in itself does not undergo any intension or remission but does so insofar as it is individuated in a subject.” This line of thought differs drastically from other thinkers around this time like Thomas Aquinas and Henry of Ghent, who held that there was a variation of specific forms which are a divisible extensions. Godfrey refutes their claims through the reasoning that because qualities cannot change in degree because they are indivisible then they must change insofar as they are individuals, so he concludes that a “change in degree in an individual quality will also be a change of the individual itself, even when its species remains the same”.\n\nNine other noteworthy topics that Godfrey wrote about in the Quodlibetal are Subject of metaphysics, Division of being, Analogy of being, Transcendentals, Essence and existence, Knowledge of God’s existence and essence, eternity of the world, Substance and accidents, and Abstraction\n\nThe \"XIV Quodlibeta\" of Godfrey, extensively studied and multiplied in manuscript form in the medieval schools, were published for the first time at the beginning of the 20th century. A critical edition of the first four of them appeared in the series \"Les Philosophes Belges, Textes et Etudes\" (II, \"Les quatre premiers Quodlibets de Godefroid de Fontaines\", by de Wulf and Pelzer, Louvain, 1904). \n\nSometime in the 14th century, Godfrey, though well known in his own time, fell out of favour into near-total obscurity. Thomas Aquinas sparked plenty of controversy and discussion in philosophy and theology in the last quarter century of the 13th century. Many significant writers lived during this period, but for the most part, until the 20th century only Thomas Aquinas and Duns Scotus received any recognition. Godfrey may have been just as significant in his own time as these two, yet for some reason his works were only edited and published as of the early 20th century. This may have more to do with his political affiliation than anything else. Religious Scholars of this time became well known in the long run based mainly on how well promoted they were by the mendicant orders. Thomas Aquinas was promoted by the Dominican order, and Duns Scotus was promoted by the Franciscan order. Despite this, Godfrey of Fontaines writings have, by the 1960s, regained much popularity.\n\n\n"}

Those who accept the Mother in Heaven doctrine trace its origins to Joseph Smith, the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement. The doctrine became more widely known after Smith's death in 1844.\n\nThe heavenly Mother doctrine is taught by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), the Restoration Church of Jesus Christ, and branches of Mormon fundamentalism, such as the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. The doctrine is not generally recognized by other denominations within the Latter Day Saint movement, such as the Community of Christ, where trinitarianism is predominant.\n\nIn the LDS Church, the doctrine of \"heavenly Mother\" or \"heavenly parents\" is not frequently discussed; however, the doctrine can be found in some church hymns and has been briefly discussed in church teaching manuals and sermons.\n\nThe theological underpinnings of a belief in Heavenly Mother are attributed to Joseph Smith, who shortly before his death in 1844 outlined a controversial view of God that differed dramatically from traditional Christian consensus. Smith's theology included the belief that God would share his glory with his children and that righteous couples might become exalted beings, or gods and goddesses, in the afterlife.\n\nAlthough there is no known record of Smith explicitly teaching about heavenly Mother, several of Smith's contemporaries attributed the theology to him either directly, or as a natural consequence of his theological stance. An editorial footnote of \"History of the Church\" 5:254, quotes Smith as saying: \"Come to me; here's the mysteries man hath not seen, Here's our Father in heaven, and Mother, the Queen.\" In addition, a secondhand account states that in 1839, Smith had told Zina Diantha Huntington, after the death of her mother, that \"not only would she know her mother again on the other side, but 'more than that, you will meet and become acquainted with your eternal Mother, the wife of your Father in Heaven.\n\nIn addition, members of the Anointed Quorum, a highly select leadership group in the early church that was privy to Smith's teachings, also acknowledged the existence of a Heavenly Mother. The \"Times and Seasons\" published a letter to the editor from a pseudonymous person named \"Joseph's Speckled Bird\", in which the author stated that in the pre-Earth life, the spirit \"was a child with his father and mother in heaven\". The apostle Parley Pratt even taught in an official church periodical that God may have had multiple wives before Christ's time, and that after the death of Mary (the mother of Jesus) she may have become another eternal wife.\n\nIn 1845, after the death of Smith, the poet Eliza Roxcy Snow published a poem entitled \"My Father in Heaven\", (later titled \"Invocation, or the Eternal Father and Mother\", now used as the lyrics in the Latter-day Saint hymn \"O My Father\"), which acknowledged the existence of a heavenly Mother. The poem contained the following language:\n\nSome early Mormons considered Snow to be a \"prophetess\". Later, church president Joseph F. Smith (a nephew of Joseph Smith) explained his own belief that \"God revealed that principle that we have a mother as well as a father in heaven to Joseph Smith; Joseph Smith revealed it to Eliza Snow Smith, his wife; and Eliza Snow was inspired, being a poet, to put it into verse.\" A companion hymn \"Our Mother in Heaven\" was published in the church's \"Juvenile Instructor\" four decades later.\n\nThe doctrine is also attributed to several other early church leaders. According to one sermon by Brigham Young, Smith once said he \"would not worship a God who had not a father; and I do not know that he would if he had not a mother; the one would be as absurd as the other.\"\n\nOrson Pratt, an early apostle of the LDS Church, opposed worshiping a heavenly Mother, because, he reasoned, like wives and children in any household, heavenly Mother was required to \"yield the most perfect obedience to\" her husband.\n\nEarly leader George Q. Cannon thought that \"there is too much of this inclination to deify 'our mother in heaven, arguing that she is not part of the Godhead and that to worship her would detract from the worship of heavenly Father. However, early 20th-century church leader Rudger Clawson disagreed, arguing that \"it doesn't take away from our worship of the Eternal Father, to adore our Eternal Mother ... [W]e honor woman when we acknowledge Godhood in her eternal prototype.\"\n\nSome church leaders have interpreted the term \"God\" to represent the divinely exalted couple with both a masculine and feminine half. Erastus Snow, an early Mormon apostle, wrote do you mean we should understand that Deity consists of a man and woman?' Most certainly I do. If I believe anything that God has ever said about himself ... I must believe that deity consists of a man and woman.\" This notion was reaffirmed by later church leaders Hugh B. Brown, James E. Talmage, Melvin J. Ballard, and Bruce R. McConkie.\n\nSome Mormon feminists have adopted the practice of praying to the heavenly Mother. However, LDS Church president Gordon B. Hinckley opposed this practice, saying that Mormons should not pray to the heavenly Mother because Christ instructed his disciples to address the heavenly Father in their prayers. When a feminist professor was fired from Brigham Young University in the 1990s, it was revealed that one of the reasons was her public advocacy of praying to heavenly Mother. Other Mormon women have been excommunicated for similar publications such as teaching that Heavenly Mother is the Holy Ghost.\n\nThe LDS Church did not formally acknowledge the existence of a heavenly Mother until 1909, in a statement on the \"origin of man\" by the First Presidency on the 50th anniversary of Charles Darwin's \"Origin of Species\". The church also later implied the theology in the 1995 statement \"\", where the church officially stated that each person is a \"spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents\". Other references to heavenly parents can be found in Latter-day Saint speeches and literature. In 2015, an official essay was published on the church website which surveyed 171 years of statements about a Mother in Heaven and confirmed that it is part of church doctrine.\n\nVarious LDS Church leaders throughout the history of the church have spoken openly about the doctrine of a heavenly Mother.\n\nBrigham Young, who taught Adam is Heavenly Father, taught that his wife Eve is heavenly Mother: \"I tell you more, Adam is the father of our spirits ... [O]ur spirits and the spirits of all the heavenly family were begotten by Adam, and born of Eve. ... I tell you, when you see your Father in the Heavens, you will see Adam; when you see your Mother that bore your spirit, you will see Mother Eve.\" (Since the LDS Church has formally denounced since the 1970s the Adam–God doctrine as taught by Young, today this statement is doctrinal only to certain groups of Mormon fundamentalists.) Young also preached that resurrected \"eternal mothers\" would \"be prepared to frame earths like unto ours\".\n\nSusa Young Gates, a daughter of Young and a women's rights activist, stated that the \"great Heavenly Mother was the great molder\" of Abraham's personality. \"Gates speculated that Heavenly Mother has played a significant role in all our lives, looking over us with 'watchful care' and providing 'careful training.\n\nEarly 20th-century church leader B. H. Roberts pointed out that the heavenly Mother doctrine presents a \"conception of the nobility of women and of motherhood and of wife-hood—placing her side by side with the Divine Father.\" Apostle John A. Widtsoe, a contemporary of Roberts, wrote that the afterlife \"is given radiant warmth by the thought that ... [we have] a mother who possesses the attributes of Godhood.\" In 1894, \"Juvenile Instructor\", an official publication of the LDS Church, published a hymn entitled \"Our Mother in Heaven\". A 1925 First Presidency statement included the lines \"All men and women are in the similitude of the universal Father and Mother . ... [M]an, as a spirit, was begotten and born of heavenly parents . ... [and] is capable, by experience through ages and aeons [sic], of evolving into a God.\"\n\nThere has also been some more recent discussion of heavenly Mother by LDS Church leaders. In a speech given at BYU in 2010, Glenn L. Pace, a member of the LDS Church's First Quorum of the Seventy, said, \"Sisters, I testify that when you stand in front of your heavenly parents in those royal courts on high and look into Her eyes and behold Her countenance, any question you ever had about the role of women in the kingdom will evaporate into the rich celestial air, because at that moment you will see standing directly in front of you, your divine nature and destiny.\"\n\nAccording to historian Linda Wilcox, heavenly Mother \"is a shadowy and elusive belief floating around the edges of Mormon consciousness\". Though the belief is held by most Mormons, the doctrine is not actively advertised by the LDS Church, though heavenly Mother is sometimes mentioned in talks or sermons in sacrament meetings and in Sunday School classes. The topic is most often consistent with the theology discussed above.\n\nThe lack of focused teaching and more information about her has caused speculation among Mormons that this de-emphasis may have a divine purpose, such as to avoid drawing attention to her and to preserve the sacredness of her existence. In 1960, an LDS seminary teacher published in a Mormon encyclopedia that \"the name of our Mother in Heaven has been withheld\" because of the way God the Father's and Jesus Christ's names have been profaned.\n\nMargaret Merrill Toscano writes that \"[w]hile no General Authority has made an official statement denying belief in a Heavenly Mother nor stating that her existence is too sacred to discuss, several factors may influence the current trend that sees even a mention of Heavenly Mother as treading on forbidden ground. Members take their cues about what is acceptable doctrine from talks of General Authorities and official church manuals and magazines\". These materials rarely mention heavenly Mother directly. The publicly discussed church discipline of feminists like Lynne Kanavel Whitesides, Maxine Hanks, Janice Merrill Allred, and Margaret Toscano, all of whom were disciplined in part for statements related to the heavenly Mother, may add to the general sense that discourse about her is strictly forbidden. However, Brigham Young University professor David L. Paulsen has argued that such a belief finds no official backing in statements by church leaders, and that the concept that the heavenly Mother is consigned to a \"sacred silence\" is largely the result of a relatively recent cultural perception.\n\nThough LDS Church president Gordon B. Hinckley has said the prohibition on praying to heavenly Mother in no way \"belittles or denigrates her\", some feel that it makes her seem less important than heavenly Father. Others assume that both heavenly parents are equally important and expect that more will be revealed when we are ready. Mormon fundamentalists believe that heavenly Father has multiple wives, and that although humankind shares the same heavenly Father, they do not all share the same heavenly Mother.\n\nThe question of how heavenly Mother is regarded ties into a larger set of questions among many Mormons about power in relationships between men and women. When asked why God said that Adam would rule over Eve, Hinckley said, \"I do not know ... My own interpretation of that sentence is that the husband shall have a governing responsibility to provide for, to protect, to strengthen and shield the wife.

In the early 20th century, she created, in cooperation with the Teachers of the East, a philosophic teaching of Living Ethics (\"Agni Yoga\"). She was an organizer and participant of cultural activity in the U.S., conducted under the guidance of her husband, Nicholas Roerich. Along with her husband, she took part in expeditions of hard-to-reach and little-investigated regions of Central Asia. She was an Honorary President-Founder of the Institute of Himalayan Studies \"Urusvati\" in India and co-author of the idea of the International Treaty for Protection of Artistic and Scientific Institutions and Historical Monuments (Roerich Pact). She translated two volumes of the \"Secret Doctrine\" of H. P. Blavatsky, and also selected Mahatma's Letters (\"Cup of the East\"), from English to Russian.\n\nRoerich was born in the family of Ivan Ivanovich Shaposhnikov, a well-known Saint-Petersburg architect.\n\nEkaterina Vassilievna Shaposhnikova, Roerich's mother, belonged to an ancient Golenischev-Kutuzov family, which originated from Novgorod at the end of the 13th century. Significant members of this family included field marshal Mikhail Illarionovich Golenischev-Kutuzov, well-known poet of the end of 19th century; Arsenii Arkadievich Golenischev-Kutuzov, composer; and Modest Petrovich Mussorgsky.\n\nRoerich grew up and was educated in rich cultural traditions of her family. From childhood she was inquisitive, and independent. She showed talents in a number of areas, playing piano, and by the age of seven reading and writing in three languages./ From the very young age, she started reading artistic, historical, spiritual and philosophic books.\n\nIn 1895, Roerich graduated from Mariinsky Gymnasium in Saint-Petersburg with a \"gold medal\", a special award for excellence in the studies. Though the education she received there was of a great quality, Roerich often studied additionally on her own. She learned painting, knew Russian and European literature well, studied the history of religion and philosophy, and took great interest in the works of the Indian philosophers Ramakrishna, Vivekananda, and Tagore.\n\nAfter finishing her education at gymnasium, Roerich entered the Saint-Petersburg musical private school. The director of this school was I.A. Borovka, a senior of metropolitan conservatoire, and professor of piano playing. He was a noted figure in Petersburg's musical culture of the time, and personally mentored Roerich.\n\nAfter graduating, which was aimed mainly towards revealing the most gifted candidates who should receive higher music education, Roerich intended to continue her education in the Saint-Petersburg conservatoire. But her relatives banned her from entering the conservatoire, worried that she would be interested by the revolutionary ideas found in the student environment. Thus, Roerich continued her education at home, where she perfected her grasp of foreign languages, and read many things.\n\nRoerich and her mother often spent the summer at Bologoe in the Novgorod region, with her aunt E.V. Putyatina, at the estate of her husband, Prince P.A. Putyatin. In 1899, at Bologoe, she met the painter and archeologist Nicholas Konstantinovich Roerich. They fell in love, and in spite of her relatives' opposition, in 1901, she and Nicholas were married in Saint-Petersburg.\n\nIn 2001, at the place in Bologoe where they first met, a memorial named \"Monument of love\" was established. It contains a quotation from N. Roerich's essay \"The University\": \"I met Lada, my partner in life and inspirer, at Bologoe, at Prince P.A. Putyatin's estate. Joy!\". This was a strong alliance of two loving people united by deep mutual feelings and common views. N. Roerich wrote about their marriage in his declining years: \"We passed amicably any obstacles. And the obstacles turned into possibilities. I devoted my books: \"To Helena, my wife, friend, partner and inspirer\". Many of Roerich's paintings were a result of their common creativity. He called her \"She who leads\" in his books, and asserted that on many his canvases, two signatures should be written: his own, and Roerich's. \"We created together, and not without reason it was said that the works must have two names, women's and men's.\n\nNicholas and Roerich had two children. In August 1902, their eldest son George was born. Later, he became a world-renowned scientist and orientalist. Their younger son, Svetoslav, was born in October 1904. He became a painter.\n\nRoerich supported all of her husband's initiatives, and went deeply into all his fields of study. In 1903—1904, they traveled together through forty old Russian cities to find sources of national history and culture. During these travels, Roerich had taken expert photographs of churches, architecture monuments, paintings, and ornaments. She also mastered the art of restoration and, together with Nicholas Konstantinovich, recovered some the masterpieces of great artists such as Rubens, Breugel, Vandyke, and van Orley, that had been hidden by latest paint layers. She also displayed her artistic intuition by collecting works of art and antiquities. Roerichs collected a beautiful family collection, composed of more than 300 works, which they later had transferred to the Hermitage Museum. Roerich also knew archeology well. Together with her husband, she often left for excavations in the regions of Novgorod's and Tver's, and took part in the work.\n\nN. Roerich and their sons thought highly of Roerich, and considered her a spiritual leader and keeper of family's foundations. In 1916, because of a serious lung disease, following the doctor's insistence, the Roerich family moved to Finland (Serdobol), to the seashore of Lake Ladoga. In 1918, Finland declared its independence and closed the Russian border. In 1919, the family moved to England, and made their home in London.\n\nHere, in 1920, Roerich, in collaboration with a group of anonymous thinkers and philosophers of the East, which in accordance with Indian's spiritual tradition were named \"The Great Teachers\" (Mahatmas), began to work for the Living Ethics Teaching (Agni Yoga).\n\nIn 1920, N. K. Roerich received an invitation to tour the United States with an exhibition of his paintings. Thus, Roerich's family moved to New York City. Here, the cultural activity was organized under N. Roerich's leadership in partnership with Roerich. The culmination of this was the foundation in America of such cultural organizations as the Nicholas Roerich Museum, the Master-Institute of United Arts, the International painter's association \"Cor Ardens\" (Flaming Hearts), and the International Art Centre \"Corona Mundi\" (\"Crown of the World\").\n\nOn December 1923, Roerich, along with her family, moved to India. This country had always been of great interest to the Roerichs. Adoration of India and its spiritual culture was not unusual among some Russian intellectuals of the time, feeling that their moral searches coincided with Indian spiritual tradition.\n\nFrom 1924 to 1928, Roerich took part in a Central-Asian expedition organized by N. K. Roerich, that traveled through hard-to-reach and little-investigated regions of India, China, Russia (Altai), Mongolia and Tibet. During the expedition, research in topics such as history, archeology, ethnography, history of philosophy, arts and religions, and geography was conducted. Previously unknown mountain peaks and passes were mapped, rare manuscripts were found, and rich linguistic materials were collected. Special attention was paid to the problem of historical unity of cultures of various peoples. The expedition was carried out in very difficult conditions. Roerich shared all hardships of the travel with the others: hard passages, robber's attacks, and obstacles created by English officials that nearly have resulted in death of the expedition. In April 1925. when N. Roerich's expedition stayed in Gulmarg, Roerich began to translate an extensive selection from \"Mahatma's Letters\" from English to Russian, which she published in London in 1923. She also wrote a book named \"Chalice of the East\", which was published that year under the pen name \"Iskander Khanum\".\n\nRoerich's manuscript \"Foundations of Buddhism\" was published in 1926, at Urga (now Ulan-Bator), where her expedition was staying at the time. In this book, the fundamental philosophical notions of Buddha's Teaching were interpreted. The book also spoke about the moral basis of this Teaching and helped sparkng interest in Buddhism in the west.\n\nIn 1927, one of the Living Ethics books (\"Community\") was published in the same place in Mongolia. After finishing of Central-Asian expedition, Roerichs remained in India, in Kullu valley Himachal Pradesh. There, in 1928, they had found an Institute of Himalayan Studies \"Urusvati\" (this means \"Light of Morning Star\" in Sanskrit). It was planned as institute for complex study of Asian regions which exerted influence on the development of world culture. Among the tasks of the \"Urusvati\" was the complex study of human, its psychic and physiological features. Roerich became an Honorary President-Founder of the institute and actively took part in organization of its work. Being a subtle art connoisseur and deep philosopher, she knew well the scientific problems of the institute, and often directed the researches as experienced scientist. The main task of Roerich's activity was in studying of ancient philosophic thought of the East.\n\nRoerich had dreamed that sometime a city of knowledge would rise in Kullu valley, which would become an international scientific centre. Later \"Urusvati\" became a large international institute that united well-known scientists from many countries. J. Bose, R. Tagore, A. Einstein, R. Millikan, L. de Broglie, R. Magoffin, S. Gedin, S.I. Metalnikov, N.I. Vavilov \"et al.\" had collaborated with it.\n\nIn Kullu, Roerich continued her work on Living Ethics, the main work of her life. In 1929, her work \"Cryptograms of the East\" (\"On Eastern Crossroads\") was published in Paris in Russian under the pen name Josephine Saint-Hilaire. This work contains apocryphal legends and parables from the lives of great devotees and teachers of mankind: Buddha, Christ, Apollonius of Tiana, Akbar the Great, St. Sergius of Radonezh. Roerich devoted a special essay \"The Banner of St. Sergius of Radonezh\" to an image of the Savior and Defender of Russian land. In this essay she joined knowledge of history and theology with deep and reverent love to the hermit. is essay was included in the book \"Banner of St. Sergius of Radonezh\", published under the pen name N. Yarovskaya in 1934.\n\nIn the first half of the 1930s, Roerich translated from English to Russian two volumes of H.P. Blavatsky's fundamental work \"Secret Doctrine\".\n\nA special place in Roerich's creativity belongs to her epistolary heritage. She corresponded with more than 140 persons. The letters geography involves several continents. Among Roerich's correspondents were friends, followers, cultural workers, political figures. In her letters, Roerich has answered numerous questions, explained the most complex philosophical and scientific problems, foundations of the Living Ethics. She wrote about great Laws of Cosmos, meaning of human life, importance of culture for human evolution, Great Teachers.\n\nIn 1940, a two-volume edition of \"Letters of Helena Roerich\" was published in Riga. A complete set of Roerich's letters is published by the International Centre of the Roerichs, where her epistolary heritage is kept. It was transferred to ICR by S.N. Roerich in 1990.\n\nDuring N.K. Roerich's Manchurian expedition, Roerich had corresponded with international organizations and coordinated activity for support the Roerich's Pact (International agreement for protection of artistic and scientific institutions and historical monuments). As a result of this work, the Roerich's Pact was signed on April 15, 1935 by heads of 22 countries.\n\nIn January 1948, after her husband's death, Roerich, together with her elder son moved to Delhi and then to Khandala (Bombay's suburb), where they had waited for steamship from Russia with their entrance visas. But Russia denied their visas. They made their home in Kalimpong, though she continued to hope to return to Roerich just like N.K. Roerich had not changed Russian citizenship. But her numerous applications remained without response.\n\nRoerich died October 5, 1955. In the place of her cremation the lamas had raised a white stupa on which the following epitaph was carved: \"Helena Roerich, the wife of Nicholas Roerich, thinker and writer, old friend of India\".\n\nOn October 15, 1969 a minor planet of Solar System was discovered by astronomers of Crimean Astrophysical Observatory Nikolai Stepanovich and Lyudmila Ivanovna Chernykh. This planet was named in honor of Roerichs family. It was numbered 4426.\n\nOn July 6, 1978 group of alpinists has risen on nameless mountain peak and has gone through a pass between the peaks \"Roerich\" and Belukha. This pass and nameless peak has been named \"Urusvati\" in honor of Roerich.\n\nOn October 9, 1999, during jubilee celebrations devoted to 125th anniversary of N. K. Roerich's birthday and 120th anniversary of Roerich's demise, a monument was established near the entrance of Museum named after N. Roerich. This monument is sculptural portrayal of Nicholas Konstantonovich and Helena Roerichs.\n\nIn 1999, the International Centre of the Roerichs instituted a jubilee medal \"Helena Roerich\" dedicated to the 120th anniversary of H. I. Roerich.\n\nIn April 2003, the college of arts named after Roerich began to work in the building of Institute \"Urusvati\" (India).\n\nIn 2005, the museum of Helena Roerich has been opened in retired two-storeyed mansion known as \"Crookety House\" in Kalimpong. Here Roerich worked during last years of life. Opening of the museum was timed to the 50th anniversary of her death.\n\nA public library named after Roerich was founded at Altaic village Ust-Koksa. In 2007, library holdings include near 75 thousands of publications. More than 1600 persons have used its service. From 2003, the library is a member of Russian Library Association and collective member of international library association IFLA.\n\nA charitable foundation named after Roerich was created in 2001 in Moscow to finance the programs dedicated to popularization of Roerich's heritage and development of cultural actions. The foundation furthers an activity in the field of education, science, culture, art, enlightenment. One of the directions of the foundation's activity is revelation of young talents in various fields of art and help them to protect and develop their creative abilities. An international Award named after Roerich was instituted by the Charitable foundation named after her to encourage scientific research connected with studying of scientific and philosophic Roerich's heritage.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "15428", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15428", "title": "Idealism", "text": "Idealism\n\nIn philosophy, Idealism is the group of metaphysical philosophies that assert that reality, or reality as humans can know it, is fundamentally mental, mentally constructed, or otherwise immaterial. Epistemologically, Idealism manifests as a skepticism about the possibility of knowing any mind-independent thing. In contrast to Materialism, Idealism asserts the \"primacy\" of consciousness as the origin and prerequisite of material phenomena. According to this view, consciousness exists \"before\" and is the pre-condition of material existence. Consciousness creates and determines the material and not vice versa. Idealism believes consciousness and mind to be the origin of the material world and aims to explain the existing world according to these principles.\n\nIdealism theories are mainly divided into two groups. Subjective idealism takes as its starting point the given fact of human consciousness seeing the existing world as a combination of sensation. Objective idealism posits the existence of an \"objective\" consciousness which exists before and, in some sense, independently of human ones. In a sociological sense, idealism emphasizes how human ideas—especially beliefs and values—shape society. As an ontological doctrine, idealism goes further, asserting that all entities are composed of mind or spirit. Idealism thus rejects physicalist and dualist theories that fail to ascribe priority to the mind.\n\nThe earliest extant arguments that the world of experience is grounded in the mental derive from India and Greece. The Hindu idealists in India and the Greek Neoplatonists gave panentheistic arguments for an all-pervading consciousness as the ground or true nature of reality. In contrast, the Yogācāra school, which arose within Mahayana Buddhism in India in the 4th century CE, based its \"mind-only\" idealism to a greater extent on phenomenological analyses of personal experience. This turn toward the subjective anticipated empiricists such as George Berkeley, who revived idealism in 18th-century Europe by employing skeptical arguments against materialism. Beginning with Immanuel Kant, German idealists such as Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling, and Arthur Schopenhauer dominated 19th-century philosophy. This tradition, which emphasized the mental or \"ideal\" character of all phenomena, gave birth to idealistic and subjectivist schools ranging from British idealism to phenomenalism to existentialism.\n\nIdealism as a philosophy came under heavy attack in the West at the turn of the 20th century. The most influential critics of both epistemological and ontological idealism were G. E. Moore and Bertrand Russell, but its critics also included the New Realists. According to \"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\", the attacks by Moore and Russell were so influential that even more than 100 years later \"any acknowledgment of idealistic tendencies is viewed in the English-speaking world with reservation\". However, many aspects and paradigms of idealism did still have a large influence on subsequent philosophy.\n\n\"Idealism\" is a term with several related meanings. It comes via \"idea\" from the Greek \"idein\" (ἰδεῖν), meaning \"to see\". The term entered the English language by 1743. In ordinary use, as when speaking of Woodrow Wilson's political idealism, it generally suggests the priority of ideals, principles, values, and goals over concrete realities. Idealists are understood to represent the world as it might or should be, unlike pragmatists, who focus on the world as it presently is. In the arts, similarly, idealism affirms imagination and attempts to realize a mental conception of beauty, a standard of perfection, juxtaposed to aesthetic naturalism and realism.\n\nAny philosophy that assigns crucial importance to the ideal or spiritual realm in its account of human existence may be termed \"idealist\". Metaphysical idealism is an ontological doctrine that holds that reality itself is incorporeal or experiential at its core. Beyond this, idealists disagree on which aspects of the mental are more basic. Platonic idealism affirms that abstractions are more basic to reality than the things we perceive, while subjective idealists and phenomenalists tend to privilege sensory experience over abstract reasoning. Epistemological idealism is the view that reality can only be known through ideas, that only psychological experience can be apprehended by the mind.\n\nSubjective idealists like George Berkeley are anti-realists in terms of a mind-independent world, whereas transcendental idealists like Immanuel Kant are strong skeptics of such a world, affirming epistemological and not metaphysical idealism. Thus Kant defines \"idealism\" as \"the assertion that we can never be certain whether all of our putative outer experience is not mere imagining\". He claimed that, according to \"idealism\", \"the reality of external objects does not admit of strict proof. On the contrary, however, the reality of the object of our internal sense (of myself and state) is clear immediately through consciousness\". However, not all idealists restrict the real or the knowable to our immediate subjective experience. Objective idealists make claims about a transempirical world, but simply deny that this world is essentially divorced from or ontologically prior to the mental. Thus, Plato and Gottfried Leibniz affirm an objective and knowable reality transcending our subjective awareness—a rejection of epistemological idealism—but propose that this reality is grounded in ideal entities, a form of metaphysical idealism. Nor do all metaphysical idealists agree on the nature of the ideal; for Plato, the fundamental entities were non-mental abstract forms, while for Leibniz they were proto-mental and concrete monads.\n\nAs a rule, transcendental idealists like Kant affirm idealism's epistemic side without committing themselves to whether reality is \"ultimately\" mental; objective idealists like Plato affirm reality's metaphysical basis in the mental or abstract without restricting their epistemology to ordinary experience; and subjective idealists like Berkeley affirm both metaphysical and epistemological idealism.\n\nIdealism as a form of metaphysical monism holds that consciousness, not matter, is the ground of all being. It is monist because it holds that there is only one type of thing in the universe and idealist because it holds that one thing to be consciousness.\n\nAnaxagoras (480 BC) taught that \"all things\" were created by \"Nous\" (\"Mind\"). He held that Mind held the cosmos together and gave human beings a connection to the cosmos or a pathway to the divine.\n\nPlato's theory of forms or \"ideas\" describes ideal forms (for example the platonic solids in geometry or abstracts like Goodness and Justice), as universals existing independently of any particular instance. Arne Grøn calls this doctrine \"the classic example of a metaphysical idealism as a \"transcendent\" idealism\", while Simone Klein calls Plato \"the earliest representative of metaphysical objective idealism\". Nevertheless, Plato holds that matter is real, though transitory and imperfect, and is perceived by our body and its senses and given existence by the eternal ideas that are perceived directly by our rational soul. Plato was therefore a metaphysical and epistemological dualist, an outlook that modern idealism has striven to avoid: Plato's thought cannot therefore be counted as idealist in the modern sense.\n\nWith the Neoplatonist Plotinus, wrote Nathaniel Alfred Boll \"there even appears, probably for the first time in Western philosophy, \"idealism\" that had long been current in the East even at that time, for it taught... that the soul has made the world by stepping from eternity into time...\". Similarly, in regard to passages from the Enneads, \"The only space or place of the world is the soul\" and \"Time must not be assumed to exist outside the soul\". Ludwig Noiré wrote: \"For the first time in Western philosophy we find idealism proper in Plotinus\". However, Plotinus does not address whether we know external objects, unlike Schopenhauer and other modern philosophers.\n\nChristian theologians have held idealist views, often based on Neoplatonism, despite the influence of Aristotelian scholasticism from the 12th century onward. Later western theistic idealism such as that of Hermann Lotze offers a theory of the \"world ground\" in which all things find their unity: it has been widely accepted by Protestant theologians. Several modern religious movements, for example the organizations within the New Thought Movement and the Unity Church, may be said to have a particularly idealist orientation. The theology of Christian Science includes a form of idealism: it teaches that all that truly exists is God and God's ideas; that the world as it appears to the senses is a distortion of the underlying spiritual reality, a distortion that may be corrected (both conceptually and in terms of human experience) through a reorientation (spiritualization) of thought.\n\nWang Yangming, a Ming Chinese neo-Confucian philosopher, official, educationist, calligraphist and general, held that objects do not exist entirely apart from the mind because the mind shapes them. It is not the world that shapes the mind but the mind that gives reason to the world, so the mind alone is the source of all reason, having an inner light, an innate moral goodness and understanding of what is good.\n\nThere are currents of idealism throughout Indian philosophy, ancient and modern. Hindu idealism often takes the form of monism or non-dualism, espousing the view that a unitary consciousness is the essence or meaning of the phenomenal reality and plurality.\n\nBuddhist idealism on the other hand is more epistemic and is not a metaphysical monism, which Buddhists consider eternalistic and hence not the middle way between extremes espoused by the Buddha.\n\nThe oldest reference to Idealism in Vedic texts is in Purusha Sukta of the Rig Veda. This sukta espouses panentheism by presenting cosmic being Purusha as both pervading all universe and yet being transcendent to it. Absolute idealism can be seen in Chāndogya Upaniṣad, where things of the objective world like the five elements and the subjective world such as will, hope, memory etc. are seen to be emanations from the Self.\n\nIdealist notions have been propounded by the Vedanta schools of thought, which use the Vedas, especially the Upanishads as their key texts. Idealism was opposed by dualists Samkhya, the atomists Vaisheshika, the logicians Nyaya, the linguists Mimamsa and the materialists Cārvāka. There are various sub schools of Vedanta, like Advaita Vedanta (non-dual), Vishishtadvaita and Bhedabheda Vedanta (difference and non-difference).\n\nThe schools of Vedanta all attempt to explain the nature and relationship of Brahman (universal soul or Self) and Atman (individual self), which they see as the central topic of the Vedas. One of the earliest attempts at this was Bādarāyaņa's Brahma Sutras, which is canonical for all Vedanta sub-schools. Advaita Vedanta is a major sub school of Vedanta which holds a non-dual Idealistic metaphysics. According to Advaita thinkers like Adi Shankara (788–820) and his contemporary Maṇḍana Miśra, Brahman, the single unitary consciousness or absolute awareness, appears as the diversity of the world because of \"maya\" or illusion, and hence perception of plurality is \"mithya\", error. The world and all beings or souls in it have no separate existence from Brahman, universal consciousness, and the seemingly independent soul (\"jiva\") is identical to Brahman. These doctrines are represented in verses such as \"brahma satyam jagan mithya; jīvo brahmaiva na aparah\" (Brahman is alone True, and this world of plurality is an error; the individual self is not different from Brahman). Other forms of Vedanta like the Vishishtadvaita of Ramanuja and the Bhedabheda of Bhāskara are not as radical in their non-dualism, accepting that there is a certain difference between individual souls and Brahman. Dvaita school of Vedanta by Madhvacharya maintains the opposing view that the world is real and eternal. It also argues that real atman fully depends and reflection of independent brahman. \n\nThe Tantric tradition of Kashmir Shaivism has also been categorized by scholars as a form of Idealism. The key thinker of this tradition is the Kashmirian Abhinavagupta (975–1025 CE).\n\nModern Vedic Idealism was defended by the influential Indian philosopher Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan in his 1932 \"An Idealist View of Life\" and other works, which espouse Advaita Vedanta. The essence of Hindu Idealism is captured by such modern writers as Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj, Sri Aurobindo, P. R. Sarkar, and Sohail Inayatullah.\n\nBuddhist views which can be said to be similar to Idealism appear in Mahayana Buddhist texts such as the Samdhinirmocana sutra, Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra, Dashabhumika sutra, etc. These were later expanded upon by Indian Buddhist philosophers like Vasubandhu, Asaṅga, Dharmakīrti, and Śāntarakṣita. Yogacara thought was also promoted in China, by Chinese philosophers and translators like Xuanzang.\n\nThere is a modern scholarly disagreement about whether Yogacara Buddhism can be said to be a form of idealism. As Saam Trivedi notes: \"on one side of the debate, writers such as Jay Garfield, Jeffrey Hopkins, Paul Williams, and others maintain the idealism label, while on the other side, Stefan Anacker, Dan Lusthaus, Richard King, Thomas Kochumuttom, Alex Wayman, Janice Dean Willis, and others have argued that Yogacara is not idealist.\" The central point of issue is what Buddhist philosophers like Vasubandhu who used the term \"Vijñapti-matra\" (representation-only or cognition-only) and formulated arguments to refute external objects actually meant to say.\n\nVasubandhu's works include a refutation of external objects or externality itself and argues that the true nature of reality is beyond subject-object distinctions. He views ordinary consciousness experience as deluded in its perceptions of an external world separate from itself and instead argues that all there is \"Vijñapti\" (representation or conceptualization). Hence Vasubandhu begins his \"Vimsatika\" with the verse: \"All this is consciousness-only, because of the appearance of non-existent objects, just as someone with an optical disorder may see non-existent nets of hair.\"\n\nLikewise, the Buddhist philosopher Dharmakirti's view of the apparent existence of external objects is summed up by him in the Pramānaṿārttika (‘Commentary on Logic and Epistemology’): \"Cognition experiences itself, and nothing else whatsoever. Even the particular objects of perception, are by nature just consciousness itself.\"\n\nWhile some writers like Jay Garfield hold that Vasubandhu is a metaphysical idealist, others see him as closer to an epistemic idealist like Kant who holds that our knowledge of the world is simply knowledge of our own concepts and perceptions of a transcendental world. Sean Butler upholding that Yogacara is a form of idealism, albeit its own unique type, notes the similarity of Kant's categories and Yogacara's \"Vāsanās\", both of which are simply phenomenal tools with which the mind interprets the noumenal realm. Unlike Kant however who holds that the noumenon or thing-in-itself is unknowable to us, Vasubandhu holds that ultimate reality is knowable, but only through non-conceptual yogic perception of a highly trained meditative mind.\n\nWriters like Dan Lusthaus who hold that Yogacara is not a metaphysical idealism point out, for example, that Yogācāra thinkers did not focus on consciousness to assert it as ontologically real, but simply to analyze how our experiences and thus our suffering is created. As Lusthaus notes: \"no Indian Yogācāra text ever claims that the world is created by mind. What they do claim is that we mistake our projected interpretations of the world for the world itself, i.e. we take our own mental constructions to be the world.\" Lusthaus notes that there are similarities to Western epistemic idealists like Kant and Husserl, enough so that Yogacara can be seen as a form of epistemological idealism. However he also notes key differences like the concepts of karma and nirvana. Saam Trivedi meanwhile notes the similarities between epistemic idealism and Yogacara, but adds that Yogacara Buddhism is in a sense its own theory.\n\nSimilarly, Thomas Kochumuttom sees Yogacara as \"an explanation of experience, rather than a system of ontology\" and Stefan Anacker sees Vasubandhu's philosophy as a form of psychology and as a mainly therapeutic enterprise.\n\nSubjective idealism (immaterialism or phenomenalism) describes a relationship between experience and the world in which objects are no more than collections or bundles of sense data in the perceiver. Proponents include Berkeley, Bishop of Cloyne, an Anglo-Irish philosopher who advanced a theory he called \"immaterialism,\" later referred to as \"subjective idealism\", contending that individuals can only know sensations and ideas of objects directly, not abstractions such as \"matter\", and that ideas also depend upon being perceived for their very existence - \"esse est percipi\"; \"to be is to be perceived\".\n\nArthur Collier published similar assertions though there seems to have been no influence between the two contemporary writers. The only knowable reality is the represented image of an external object. Matter as a cause of that image, is unthinkable and therefore nothing to us. An external world as absolute matter unrelated to an observer does not exist as far as we are concerned. The universe cannot exist as it appears if there is no perceiving mind. Collier was influenced by \"An Essay Towards the Theory of the Ideal or Intelligible World\" by Cambridge Platonist John Norris (1701).\n\nBertrand Russell's popular book \"The Problems of Philosophy\" highlights Berkeley's tautological premise for advancing idealism;\n\nThe Austrailian philosopher David Stove harshly criticized philosophical idealism, arguing that it rests on what he called \"the worst argument in the world\". Stove claims that Berkeley tried to derive a non-tautological conclusion from tautological reasoning. He argued that in Berkeley's case the fallacy is not obvious and this is because one premise is ambiguous between one meaning which is tautological and another which, Stove argues, is logically equivalent to the conclusion.\n\nAlan Musgrave argues that conceptual idealists compound their mistakes with use/mention confusions;\n\nand proliferation of hyphenated entities such as \"thing-in-itself\" (Immanuel Kant), \"things-as-interacted-by-us\" (Arthur Fine), \"table-of-commonsense\" and \"table-of-physics\" (Sir Arthur Eddington) which are \"warning signs\" for conceptual idealism according to Musgrave because they allegedly do not exist but only highlight the numerous ways in which people come to know the world. This argument does not take into account the issues pertaining to hermeneutics, especially at the backdrop of analytic philosophy. Musgrave criticized Richard Rorty and postmodernist philosophy in general for confusion of use and mention.\n\nA. A. Luce and John Foster are other subjectivists. Luce, in \"Sense without Matter\" (1954), attempts to bring Berkeley up to date by modernizing his vocabulary and putting the issues he faced in modern terms, and treats the Biblical account of matter and the psychology of perception and nature. Foster's \"The Case for Idealism\" argues that the physical world is the logical creation of natural, non-logical constraints on human sense-experience. Foster's latest defense of his views (phenomenalistic idealism) is in his book \"A World for Us: The Case for Phenomenalistic Idealism\".\n\nPaul Brunton, a British philosopher, mystic, traveler, and guru, taught a type of idealism called \"mentalism,\" similar to that of Bishop Berkeley, proposing a master world-image, projected or manifested by a world-mind, and an infinite number of individual minds participating. A tree does not cease to exist if nobody sees it because the world-mind is projecting the idea of the tree to all minds\n\nJohn Searle, criticizing some versions of idealism, summarizes two important arguments for subjective idealism. The first is based on our perception of reality:\n\ntherefore;\n\nWhilst agreeing with (2) Searle argues that (1) is false and points out that (3) does not follow from (1) and (2). The second argument runs as follows;\n\nSearle contends that \"Conclusion 2\" does not follow from the premises.\n\nEpistemological idealism is a subjectivist position in epistemology that holds that what one knows about an object exists only in one's mind. Proponents include Brand Blanshard.\n\nTranscendental idealism, founded by Immanuel Kant in the eighteenth century, maintains that the mind shapes the world we perceive into the form of space-and-time.\n\nThe 2nd edition (1787) contained a \"Refutation of Idealism\" to distinguish his transcendental idealism from Descartes's Sceptical Idealism and Berkeley's anti-realist strain of Subjective Idealism. The section \"Paralogisms of Pure Reason\" is an implicit critique of Descartes' idealism. Kant says that it is not possible to infer the 'I' as an object (Descartes' \"cogito ergo sum\") purely from \"the spontaneity of thought\". Kant focused on ideas drawn from British philosophers such as Locke, Berkeley and Hume but distinguished his transcendental or critical idealism from previous varieties;\n\nKant distinguished between things as they appear to an observer and things in themselves, \"that is, things considered without regard to whether and how they may be given to us\". We cannot approach the \"noumenon\", the \"thing in Itself\" () without our own mental world. He added that the mind is not a blank slate, \"tabula rasa\" but rather comes equipped with categories for organising our sense impressions.\n\nIn the first volume of his \"Parerga and Paralipomena\", Schopenhauer wrote his \"Sketch of a History of the Doctrine of the Ideal and the Real\". He defined the ideal as being mental pictures that constitute subjective knowledge. The ideal, for him, is what can be attributed to our own minds. The images in our head are what comprise the ideal. Schopenhauer emphasized that we are restricted to our own consciousness. The world that appears is only a representation or mental picture of objects. We directly and immediately know only representations. All objects that are external to the mind are known indirectly through the mediation of our mind. He offered a history of the concept of the \"ideal\" as \"ideational\" or \"existing in the mind as an image\".\n\nCharles Bernard Renouvier was the first Frenchman after Nicolas Malebranche to formulate a complete idealistic system, and had a vast influence on the development of French thought. His system is based on Immanuel Kant's, as his chosen term \"néo-criticisme\" indicates; but it is a transformation rather than a continuation of Kantianism.\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche argued that Kant commits an agnostic tautology and does not offer a satisfactory answer as to the \"source\" of a philosophical right to such-or-other metaphysical claims; he ridicules his pride in tackling \"the most difficult thing that could ever be undertaken on behalf of metaphysics.\" The famous \"thing-in-itself\" was called a product of philosophical habit, which seeks to introduce a grammatical subject: because wherever there is cognition, there must be a \"thing\" that is cognized and allegedly it must be added to ontology as a being (whereas, to Nietzsche, only the world as ever changing appearances can be assumed). Yet he attacks the idealism of Schopenhauer and Descartes with an argument similar to Kant's critique of the latter \"(see above)\".\n\nObjective idealism asserts that the reality of experiencing combines and transcends the realities of the object experienced and of the mind of the observer. Proponents include Thomas Hill Green, Josiah Royce, Benedetto Croce and Charles Sanders Peirce.\n\nSchelling (1775–1854) claimed that the Fichte's \"I\" needs the Not-I, because there is no subject without object, and vice versa. So there is no difference between the subjective and the objective, that is, the ideal and the real. This is Schelling's \"absolute identity\": the ideas or mental images in the mind are identical to the extended objects which are external to the mind.\n\nAbsolute idealism is G. W. F. Hegel's account of how existence is comprehensible as an all-inclusive whole. Hegel called his philosophy \"absolute\" idealism in contrast to the \"subjective idealism\" of Berkeley and the \"transcendental idealism\" of Kant and Fichte, which were not based on a critique of the finite and a dialectical philosophy of history as Hegel's idealism was. The exercise of reason and intellect enables the philosopher to know ultimate historical reality, the phenomenological constitution of self-determination, the dialectical development of self-awareness and personality in the realm of History.\n\nIn his \"Science of Logic\" (1812–1814) Hegel argues that finite qualities are not fully \"real\" because they depend on other finite qualities to determine them. Qualitative \"infinity\", on the other hand, would be more self-determining and hence more fully real. Similarly finite natural things are less \"real\"—because they are less self-determining—than spiritual things like morally responsible people, ethical communities and God. So any doctrine, such as materialism, that asserts that finite qualities or natural objects are fully real is mistaken.\n\nHegel certainly intends to preserve what he takes to be true of German idealism, in particular Kant's insistence that ethical reason can and does go beyond finite inclinations. For Hegel there must be some identity of thought and being for the \"subject\" (any human observer) to be able to know any observed \"object\" (any external entity, possibly even another human) at all. Under Hegel's concept of \"subject-object identity,\" subject and object both have Spirit (Hegel's ersatz, redefined, nonsupernatural \"God\") as their \"conceptual\" (not metaphysical) inner reality—and in that sense are identical. But until Spirit's \"self-realization\" occurs and Spirit graduates from Spirit to \"Absolute\" Spirit status, subject (a human mind) mistakenly thinks every \"object\" it observes is something \"alien,\" meaning something separate or apart from \"subject.\" In Hegel's words, \"The object is revealed to it [to \"subject\"] by [as] something alien, and it does not recognize itself.\" Self-realization occurs when Hegel (part of Spirit's nonsupernatural Mind, which is the collective mind of all humans) arrives on the scene and realizes that every \"object\" is \"himself\", because both subject and object are essentially Spirit. When self-realization occurs and Spirit becomes \"Absolute\" Spirit, the \"finite\" (man, human) becomes the \"infinite\" (\"God,\" divine), replacing the imaginary or \"picture-thinking\" supernatural God of theism: man becomes God. Tucker puts it this way: \"Hegelianism . . . is a religion of self-worship whose fundamental theme is given in Hegel's image of the man who aspires to be God himself, who demands 'something more, namely infinity.'\" The picture Hegel presents is \"a picture of a self-glorifying humanity striving compulsively, and at the end successfully, to rise to divinity.\"\n\nKierkegaard criticized Hegel's idealist philosophy in several of his works, particularly his claim to a comprehensive system that could explain the whole of reality. Where Hegel argues that an ultimate understanding of the logical structure of the world is an understanding of the logical structure of God's mind, Kierkegaard asserts that for God reality can be a system but it cannot be so for any human individual because both reality and humans are incomplete and all philosophical systems imply completeness. A logical system is possible but an existential system is not. \"What is rational is actual; and what is actual is rational\". Hegel's absolute idealism blurs the distinction between existence and thought: our mortal nature places limits on our understanding of reality;\n\nSo-called systems have often been characterized and challenged in the assertion that they abrogate the distinction between good and evil, and destroy freedom. Perhaps one would express oneself quite as definitely, if one said that every such system fantastically dissipates the concept existence. ... Being an individual man is a thing that has been abolished, and every speculative philosopher confuses himself with humanity at large; whereby he becomes something infinitely great, and at the same time nothing at all.\n\nA major concern of Hegel's \"Phenomenology of Spirit\" (1807) and of the philosophy of Spirit that he lays out in his \"Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences\" (1817–1830) is the interrelation between individual humans, which he conceives in terms of \"mutual recognition.\" However, what Climacus means by the aforementioned statement, is that Hegel, in the \"Philosophy of Right\", believed the best solution was to surrender one's individuality to the customs of the State, identifying right and wrong in view of the prevailing bourgeois morality. Individual human will ought, at the State's highest level of development, to properly coincide with the will of the State. Climacus rejects Hegel's suppression of individuality by pointing out it is impossible to create a valid set of rules or system in any society which can adequately describe existence for any one individual. Submitting one's will to the State denies personal freedom, choice, and responsibility.\n\nIn addition, Hegel does believe we can know the structure of God's mind, or ultimate reality. Hegel agrees with Kierkegaard that both reality and humans are incomplete, inasmuch as we are in time, and reality develops through time. But the relation between time and eternity is outside time and this is the \"logical structure\" that Hegel thinks we can know. Kierkegaard disputes this assertion, because it eliminates the clear distinction between ontology and epistemology. Existence and thought are not identical and one cannot possibly think existence. Thought is always a form of abstraction, and thus not only is pure existence impossible to think, but all forms in existence are unthinkable; thought depends on language, which merely abstracts from experience, thus separating us from lived experience and the living essence of all beings. In addition, because we are finite beings, we cannot possibly know or understand anything that is universal or infinite such as God, so we cannot know God exists, since that which transcends time simultaneously transcends human understanding.\n\nBradley saw reality as a monistic whole apprehended through \"feeling\", a state in which there is no distinction between the perception and the thing perceived. Like Berkeley, Bradley thought that nothing can be known to exist unless it is known by a mind.\n\nBradley was the apparent target of G. E. Moore's radical rejection of idealism. Moore claimed that Bradley did not understand the statement that something is real. We know for certain, through common sense and prephilosophical beliefs, that some things are real, whether they are objects of thought or not, according to Moore. The 1903 article \"The Refutation of Idealism\" is one of the first demonstrations of Moore's commitment to analysis. He examines each of the three terms in the Berkeleian aphorism \"esse est percipi\", \"to be is to be perceived\", finding that it must mean that the object and the subject are \"necessarily\" connected so that \"yellow\" and \"the sensation of yellow\" are identical - \"to be yellow\" is \"to be experienced as yellow\". But it also seems there is a difference between \"yellow\" and \"the sensation of yellow\" and \"that \"esse\" is held to be \"percipi\", solely because what is experienced is held to be identical with the experience of it\". Though far from a complete refutation, this was the first strong statement by analytic philosophy against its idealist predecessors, or at any rate against the type of idealism represented by Berkeley.\n\nActual idealism is a form of idealism developed by Giovanni Gentile that grew into a \"grounded\" idealism contrasting Kant and Hegel. The idea is a version of Occam's razor; the simpler explanations are always correct. Actual idealism is the idea that reality is the ongoing act of thinking, or in Italian \"pensiero pensante\". Any action done by humans is classified as human thought because the action was done due to predisposed thought. He further believes that thoughts are the only concept that truly exist since reality is defined through the act of thinking. This idea was derived from Gentile's paper, \"The Theory of Mind As Pure Act\".\n\nSince thoughts are actions, any conjectured idea can be enacted. This idea not only affects the individual's life, but everyone around them, which in turn affects the state since the people are the state. Therefore, thoughts of each person are subsumed within the state. The state is a composition of many minds that come together to change the country for better or worse.\n\nGentile theorizes that thoughts can only be conjectured within the bounds of known reality; abstract thinking does not exist. Thoughts cannot be formed outside our known reality because we are the reality that halt ourselves from thinking externally. With accordance to \"The Act of Thought of Pure Thought\", our actions comprise our thoughts, our thoughts create perception, perceptions define reality, thus we think within our created reality.\n\nThe present act of thought is reality but the past is not reality; it is history. The reason being, past can be rewritten through present knowledge and perspective of the event. The reality that is currently constructed can be completely changed through language (e.g. bias (omission, source, tone)). The unreliability of the recorded realty can skew the original concept and make the past remark unreliable. \nActual idealism is regarded as a liberal and tolerant doctrine since it acknowledges that every being picturizes reality, in which their ideas remained hatched, differently. Even though, reality is a figment of thought.\n\nEven though core concept of the theory is famous for its simplification, its application is regarded as extremely ambiguous. Over the years, philosophers have interpreted it numerously different ways: Holmes took it as metaphysics of the thinking act; Betti as a form of hermeneutics; Harris as a metaphysics of democracy; Fogu as a modernist philosophy of history.\n\nGiovanni Gentile was a key supporter of fascism, regarded by many as the \"philosopher of fascism\". Gentile's philosophy was the key to understating fascism as it was believed by many who supported and loved it. They believed, if priori synthesis of subject and object is true, there is no difference between the individuals in society; they're all one. Which means that they have equal right, roles, and jobs. In fascist state, submission is given to one leader because individuals act as one body. In Gentile's view, far more can be accomplished when individuals are under a corporate body than a collection of autonomous individual.\n\nPluralistic idealism such as that of Gottfried Leibniz takes the view that there are many individual minds that together underlie the existence of the observed world and make possible the existence of the physical universe. Unlike absolute idealism, pluralistic idealism does not assume the existence of a single ultimate mental reality or \"Absolute\". Leibniz' form of idealism, known as Panpsychism, views \"monads\" as the true atoms of the universe and as entities having perception. The monads are \"substantial forms of being, \"elemental, individual, subject to their own laws, non-interacting, each reflecting the entire universe. Monads are centers of force, which is substance while space, matter and motion are phenomenal and their form and existence is dependent on the simple and immaterial monads. There is a pre-established harmony by God, the central monad, between the world in the minds of the monads and the external world of objects. Leibniz's cosmology embraced traditional Christian theism. The English psychologist and philosopher James Ward inspired by Leibniz had also defended a form of pluralistic idealism. According to Ward the universe is composed of \"psychic monads\" of different levels, interacting for mutual self-betterment.\n\nPersonalism is the view that the minds that underlie reality are the minds of persons. Borden Parker Bowne, a philosopher at Boston University, a founder and popularizer of personal idealism, presented it as a substantive reality of persons, the only reality, as known directly in self-consciousness. Reality is a society of interacting persons dependent on the Supreme Person of God. Other proponents include George Holmes Howison and J. M. E. McTaggart.\n\nHowison's personal idealism was also called \"California Personalism\" by others to distinguish it from the \"Boston Personalism\" which was of Bowne. Howison maintained that both impersonal, monistic idealism and materialism run contrary to the experience of moral freedom. To deny freedom to pursue truth, beauty, and \"benignant love\" is to undermine every profound human venture, including science, morality, and philosophy. Personalistic idealists Borden Parker Bowne and Edgar S. Brightman and realistic personal theist Saint Thomas Aquinas address a core issue, namely that of dependence upon an infinite personal God.\n\nHowison, in his book \"The Limits of Evolution and Other Essays Illustrating the Metaphysical Theory of Personal Idealism\", created a democratic notion of personal idealism that extended all the way to God, who was no more the ultimate monarch but the ultimate democrat in eternal relation to other eternal persons. J. M. E. McTaggart's idealist atheism and Thomas Davidson's Apeirionism resemble Howisons personal idealism.\n\nJ. M. E. McTaggart of Cambridge University argued that minds alone exist and only relate to each other through love. Space, time and material objects are unreal. In \"The Unreality of Time\" he argued that time is an illusion because it is impossible to produce a coherent account of a sequence of events. \"The Nature of Existence\" (1927) contained his arguments that space, time, and matter cannot possibly be real. In his \"Studies in Hegelian Cosmology\" (Cambridge, 1901, p196) he declared that metaphysics are not relevant to social and political action. McTaggart \"thought that Hegel was wrong in supposing that metaphysics could show that the state is more than a means to the good of the individuals who compose it\". For McTaggart \"philosophy can give us very little, if any, guidance in action... Why should a Hegelian citizen be surprised that his belief as to the organic nature of the Absolute does not help him in deciding how to vote? Would a Hegelian engineer be reasonable in expecting that his belief that all matter is spirit should help him in planning a bridge?\n\nThomas Davidson taught a philosophy called \"apeirotheism\", a \"form of pluralistic idealism...coupled with a stern ethical rigorism\" which he defined as \"a theory of Gods infinite in number.\" The theory was indebted to Aristotle's pluralism and his concepts of Soul, the rational, living aspect of a living substance which cannot exist apart from the body because it is not a substance but an essence, and \"nous\", rational thought, reflection and understanding. Although a perennial source of controversy, Aristotle arguably views the latter as both eternal and immaterial in nature, as exemplified in his theology of unmoved movers. Identifying Aristotle's God with rational thought, Davidson argued, contrary to Aristotle, that just as the soul cannot exist apart from the body, God cannot exist apart from the world.\n\nIdealist notions took a strong hold among physicists of the early 20th century confronted with the paradoxes of quantum physics and the theory of relativity. In \"The Grammar of Science\", Preface to the 2nd Edition, 1900, Karl Pearson wrote, \"There are many signs that a sound idealism is surely replacing, as a basis for natural philosophy, the crude materialism of the older physicists.\" This book influenced Einstein's regard for the importance of the observer in scientific measurements. In § 5 of that book, Pearson asserted that \"...science is in reality a classification and analysis of the contents of the mind...\" Also, \"...the field of science is much more consciousness than an external world.\"\n\nSir Arthur Eddington, a British astrophysicist of the early 20th century, wrote in his book \"The Nature of the Physical World\" that \"The stuff of the world is mind-stuff\": The mind-stuff of the world is, of course, something more general than our individual conscious minds... The mind-stuff is not spread in space and time; these are part of the cyclic scheme ultimately derived out of it... It is necessary to keep reminding ourselves that all knowledge of our environment from which the world of physics is constructed, has entered in the form of messages transmitted along the nerves to the seat of consciousness... Consciousness is not sharply defined, but fades into subconsciousness; and beyond that we must postulate something indefinite but yet continuous with our mental nature... It is difficult for the matter-of-fact physicist to accept the view that the substratum of everything is of mental character. But no one can deny that mind is the first and most direct thing in our experience, and all else is remote inference.\"\nIan Barbour in his book \"Issues in Science and Religion\" (1966), p. 133, cites Arthur Eddington's \"The Nature of the Physical World\" (1928) for a text that argues The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principles provides a scientific basis for \"the defense of the idea of human freedom\" and his \"Science and the Unseen World\" (1929) for support of philosophical idealism \"the thesis that reality is basically mental\".\n\nSir James Jeans wrote: \"The stream of knowledge is heading towards a non-mechanical reality; the Universe begins to look more like a great thought than like a great machine. Mind no longer appears to be an accidental intruder into the realm of matter... we ought rather hail it as the creator and governor of the realm of matter.\"\n\nJeans, in an interview published in The Observer (London), when asked the question: \"Do you believe that life on this planet is the result of some sort of accident, or do you believe that it is a part of some great scheme?\" replied: I incline to the idealistic theory that consciousness is fundamental, and that the material universe is derivative from consciousness, not consciousness from the material universe... In general the universe seems to me to be nearer to a great thought than to a great machine. It may well be, it seems to me, that each individual consciousness ought to be compared to a brain-cell in a universal mind.\n\nAddressing the British Association in 1934, Jeans said: What remains is in any case very different from the full-blooded matter and the forbidding materialism of the Victorian scientist. His objective and material universe is proved to consist of little more than constructs of our own minds. To this extent, then, modern physics has moved in the direction of philosophic idealism. Mind and matter, if not proved to be of similar nature, are at least found to be ingredients of one single system. There is no longer room for the kind of dualism which has haunted philosophy since the days of Descartes.\n\nIn \"The Universe Around Us\", Jeans writes: Finite picture whose dimensions are a certain amount of space and a certain amount of time; the protons and electrons are the streaks of paint which define the picture against its space-time background. Traveling as far back in time as we can, brings us not to the creation of the picture, but to its edge; the creation of the picture lies as much outside the picture as the artist is outside his canvas. On this view, discussing the creation of the universe in terms of time and space is like trying to discover the artist and the action of painting, by going to the edge of the canvas. This brings us very near to those philosophical systems which regard the universe as a thought in the mind of its Creator, thereby reducing all discussion of material creation to futility.\n\nThe chemist Ernest Lester Smith wrote a book \"Intelligence Came First\" (1975) in which he claimed that consciousness is a fact of nature and that the cosmos is grounded in and pervaded by mind and intelligence.\n\nBernard d'Espagnat, a French theoretical physicist best known for his work on the nature of reality, wrote a paper titled \"The Quantum Theory and Reality\". According to the paper: The doctrine that the world is made up of objects whose existence is independent of human consciousness turns out to be in conflict with quantum mechanics and with facts established by experiment.\n\nIn a \"Guardian\" article entitled \"Quantum Weirdness: What We Call 'Reality' is Just a State of Mind\", d'Espagnat wrote: What quantum mechanics tells us, I believe, is surprising to say the least. It tells us that the basic components of objects – the particles, electrons, quarks etc. – cannot be thought of as 'self-existent'.\n\nHe further writes that his research in quantum physics has led him to conclude that an \"ultimate reality\" exists, which is not embedded in space or time.\n\n\nFurther reading\n\n"}

{"id": "388129", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=388129", "title": "Jacobus Arminius", "text": "Jacobus Arminius\n\nJacobus Arminius, (October 10, 1560 – October 19, 1609), the Latinized name of Jakob Hermanszoon, was a Dutch theologian from the Protestant Reformation period whose views became the basis of Arminianism and the Dutch Remonstrant movement. He served from 1603 as professor in theology at the University of Leiden and wrote many books and treatises on theology.\n\nFollowing his death, his challenge to the Reformed standard, the Belgic Confession, provoked ample discussion at the Synod of Dort, which crafted the five points of Calvinism in response to Arminius's teaching.\n\nArminius, born in Oudewater, Utrecht, became an orphan while still young. His father Herman died, leaving his wife a widow with small children. His mother was killed during the Spanish massacre at Oudewater in 1575.\n\nThe pastor Theodorus Aemilius adopted Arminius and sent him to school in Utrecht, but died in 1574. Then Rudolph Snellius brought Arminius to Marburg and enabled him to study theology at the University of Leiden.\n\nArminius remained a student at Leiden from 1576 to 1582. Although he enrolled as a student in Liberal Arts, this allowed him to pursue an education in theology, as well. His teachers in theology included Calvinist Lambertus Danaeus, Hebrew scholar Johannes Drusius, Guillaume Feuguereius (or Feugueires, d. 1613), and Johann Kolmann. Kolmann is now known for teaching that the overemphasis of God's sovereignty in high Calvinism made God \"a tyrant and an executioner\". Although the university in Leiden was solidly Reformed, it had influences from Lutheran, Zwinglian, and Anabaptist views in addition to Calvinism. One Leiden pastor (Caspar Coolhaes) held, \"contra\" Calvin, that civil authorities did have jurisdiction in some church affairs, that it was wrong to punish and execute heretics, and that Lutherans, Calvinists, and Anabaptists could unite around core tenets. The astronomer and mathematician Willebrord Snellius used Ramist philosophy in an effort to encourage his students to pursue truth without over reliance on Aristotle. Under the influence of these men, Arminius studied with success and may have had seeds planted that would begin to develop into a theology that would later question the dominant Reformed theology of John Calvin. The success he showed in his studies motivated the merchants guild of Amsterdam to fund the next three years of his studies.\n\nIn 1582, Arminius began studying under Theodore Beza at Geneva. He found himself under pressure for using Ramist philosophical methods, familiar to him from his time at Leiden. Arminius was publicly forbidden to teach Ramean philosophy. After this difficult state of affairs, he moved to Basel to continue his studies. He continued to distinguish himself there as an excellent student. In 1583 Arminius was contemplating a return to Geneva when the theological faculty at Basel spontaneously offered him a doctorate. He declined the honor on account of his youth (he was about 24) and returned to the school in Geneva to finish his schooling in Geneva under Beza.\n\nUpon the conclusion of Arminius' studies and a request for him to pastor in Amsterdam, Beza replied to leaders in Amsterdam with this letter:\n\n\"\"...Let it be known to you that from the time Arminius returned to us from Basel, his life and learning both have so approved themselves to us, that we hope the best of him in every respect, if he steadily persists in the same course, which, by the blessing of God, we doubt not he will; for, among other endowments, God has gifted him with an apt intellect both as respects the apprehension and the discrimination of things. If this henceforward be regulated by piety, which he appears assiduously to cultivate, it cannot but happen that this power of intellect, when consolidated by mature age and experience, will be productive of the richest fruits. Such is our opinion of Arminius ---a young man, unquestionably, so far as we are able to judge, most worthy of your kindness and liberality\" (Letter of June 3, 1585, from Beza to Amsterdam).\"\n\nFrom this letter it would seem that the earlier tension from Arminius' attraction to Ramist philosophy had dissipated and Arminius was known even to Beza as an excellent though budding theologian. Three months later, John Grynaeus at the University of Basel sent this letter of commendation:\n\n\" \"To pious readers, greeting: 'Inasmuch as a faithful testimonial of learning and piety ought not to be refused to any learned and pious man, so neither to James Arminius, a native of Amsterdam [sic], for his deportment while he attended the University of Basle was marked by piety, moderation, and assiduity in study ; and very often, in the course of our theological discussions, he made his gift of a discerning spirit so manifest to all of us, as to elicit from us well-merited congratulations. More recently, too, in certain extraordinary prelections delivered with the consent, and by the order, of the Theological Faculty, in which he publicly expounded a few chapters of the Epistle to the Romans, he gave us the best ground to hope that he was destined erelong — if, indeed, he goes on to stir up the gift of God that is in him — to undertake and sustain the function of teaching, to which he may be lawfully set apart, with much fruit to the Church. I commend him, accordingly, to all good men, and, in particular, to the Church of God in the famous city of Amsterdam ; and I respectfully entreat that regard may be had to that learned and pious youth, so that he may never be under the necessity of intermitting theological studies which have been thus far so happily prosecuted. Farewell ! 'John James Grynaeus, ' Professor of Sacred Literature, and Dean of the Theological Faculty. — Written with mine own hand. Basle, 3rd September, 1583.' \"\n\nArminius answered the call to pastor at Amsterdam in 1587, delivering Sunday and midweek sermons. After being tested by the church leaders, he was ordained in 1588. He gained a reputation as a good preacher and faithful pastor.\n\nOne of Arminius' first tasks was given to him by Ecclesiastical Court of Amsterdam; namely, to refute the teachings of Dirck Volckertszoon Coornhert, who rejected the Beza's supralapsarian doctrine of God's absolute and unconditional decree to create men so as to save some and damn others, based on nothing in themselves. The discussion had already begun with two ministers at Delft who had written \"An Answer to certain Arguments of Beza and Calvin, from a Treatise on Predestination as taught in the Ninth Chapter of Romans\" a document which contradicted both Beza and Coorhert. They proposed that although God's decree to save only some was indeed absolute and unconditional, it had occurred after the fall (proposing infralapsarianism rather than Beza's supralapsarianism). Arminius was tasked with refuting both Coorhert and infralapsarianism theology. He readily agreed to the task, but after greater study found himself in conflict over the matter. He determined to spend greater time in study before continuing his refutation.\n\nIn 1590 he married Lijsbet Reael. He was commissioned to organize the educational system of Amsterdam, and is said to have done it well. He greatly distinguished himself by faithfulness to his duties in 1602 during a plague that swept through Amsterdam, going into infected houses that others did not dare to enter in order to give them water, and supplying their neighbors with funds to care for them.\n\nAt Amsterdam, Arminius taught through \"a number of sermons on the Epistle of the Romans.\" In discussing Romans 7 in 1591, he taught that man, through grace and rebirth, did not have to live in bondage to sin, and that Romans 7:14 was speaking of a man living under the law and convicted of sin by the Holy Spirit, yet not presently regenerated. This was met with some resistance, and some detractors labeled him Pelagian for teaching that an unregenerate man could feel such conviction and desire for salvation, even with the influence of the Law and the Holy Spirit. In the same year, responding to Arminius' theological positions, his colleague Petrus Plancius began to openly dispute him. During a gathering of ministers, Arminius insisted he was not teaching anything in contradiction to the Heidelberg Confession and other standards of orthodoxy, that early church theologians held similar views, and that he utterly repudiated the heresy of Pelagianism. Further, Arminius expressed some astonishment that he was not to be allowed to interpret this passage according to the dictates of his own conscience and within the pattern of historic orthodoxy. The Amsterdam burgomasters intervened, in an effort to keep the peace and tamp down divisions in the populace, urging them to peacefully coexist and for Arminius to teach nothing out of accord with the Reformed thought agreed upon at the time unless he had consulted with the church council or other bodies.\n\nDuring the following years, controversy emerged as he preached through Romans 9. Although he did not directly contradict Calvinist interpretations, he focused on Paul's theme of \"justification by faith\" in contradiction to works, rather than focusing on God's eternal decrees. During this time he \"gradually developed opinions on grace, predestination and free will that were inconsistent with the doctrine of the Reformed teachers Calvin and Beza\".\n\nIn 1603 he was called back to Leiden University to teach theology. This came about after almost simultaneous deaths in 1602 of two faculty members, Franciscus Junius and Lucas Trelcatius the elder, in an outbreak of plague. Lucas Trelcatius the younger and Arminius (despite Plancius' protest) were appointed, the decision resting largely with Franciscus Gomarus, the surviving faculty member. While Gomarus cautiously approved Arminius, whose views were already suspected of unorthodoxy, his arrival opened a period of debate rather than closed it. The appointment had also a political dimension, being backed by both Johannes Uytenbogaert at The Hague and Johan van Oldenbarnevelt.\n\nGomarus, a Fleming who had been in Leiden since 1594, has been described as \"a rather mediocre scholar\" but \"a forceful defender of the Calvinistic doctrine... a man of deep-rooted faith\" In contrast Arminius has been described as \"a seeker, a doubter\". On the question of predestination Gomarus was a supralapsarian and it was in debate over this point that the conflict between the two began. Arminius advocated revising the \"Belgic Confession\" and the \"Heidelberg Catechism\", but was not explicit, until much later when the debate became an open conflict.\n\nThe dispute took a public turn on February 7, 1604, when Willem Bastingius in his disputation \"De divina praedestinatione\" defended a number of Arminius's theses, Arminius himself presiding. This event led Gomarus to have Samuel Gruterus argue an opposite position to these theses on October 14, 1604, but not on the official schedule. Gomarus ascribed the positions he disliked to Calvin's adversary Sebastian Castellio and his follower, Dirck Volckertszoon Coornhert. While Arminius pointed to the Bible to defend his positions, the Calvinist views set forth by \"the Genevan patriarchs gradually acquired the force of \"Res judicata\", so that resistance against it was no longer tolerated.\"\n\nOpponents of Arminius outside the university gradually expanded the controversy. The classis in Dordrecht drew up a gravamen in which \"some differences\" that \"were said to have arisen in the Church and University of Leiden on the doctrine of the Reformed Churches\" was laid out. In response the three Leiden professors of theology (Lucas Trelcatius Jr. joining Arminius and Gomarus) and the Regent of the State College, Johannes Cuchlinus, wrote an indignant letter, stating \"that as far as was known to them there was no conflict between the professors on any fundamental doctrine whatsoever.\"\n\nGomarus was incited to increase his opposition to Arminius by Leiden minister Festus Hommius and Petrus Plancius, Arminius's old opponent. An anonymous series of thirty-one articles was circulated, \"in which all kinds of unorthodox opinions held by Arminius were exposed\". Sibrandus Lubbertus, Professor of Theology at the University of Franeker, began sending letters to foreign theologians attacking Arminius with charges of heresy; and one of these letters fell into Arminius's hands. Because his opponents remained anonymous or bypassed official procedures, Arminius in April 1608 requested from the States of Holland permission to expound his views. On May 30, 1608, Arminius and Gomarus were allowed by the States to deliver speeches before the Supreme Court in The Hague. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Reinout van Brederode (Oldenbarnevelt's son-in-law) concluded that \"the points of difference between the two professors, mostly relating to the subtle details of doctrine of predestination, were of minor importance and could co-exist... [and] enjoined both gentlemen to tolerate one another lovingly\".\n\nIn direct defiance of the Court, Gomarus then published the speech he had made before it, and Arminius followed suit by publishing his own speech. In response to the Court's opinion Gomarus declared that \"he would not dare die holding Arminius' opinion, nor to appear with it before God's judgement seat.\" Arminius then asked to defend his positions in public or for a national or provincial synod to be called to examine the matter. Seeking to avoid a synod, the States of Holland allowed Arminius to expound on his views to their assembly on October 30, 1608.\n\nBefore the assembly, Arminius finally explained his call to rewrite the Belgic Confession and the Heidelberg Catechism, saying that he did not feel obligated to explain his position before, for \"as a professor, he considered himself subject only to the authority of the Leiden Curators and the States, not to the Church\". Arminius then gave an overview of all the various opinions existing on predestination. He claimed that supralapsarianism was contrary to the Confession and Catechism and that \"supra- and infralapsarianism, basically amount to the same thing.\" Arminius put forward his own view on predestination which he held was in concordance with the Confession and the Catechism.\n\nLearning that Arminius had appeared before the States assembly, Gomarus requested permission to address it as well, which was granted. On December 12, 1608, Gomarus blasted Arminius, accusing \"his colleague of being a supporter of Pelagianism and the Jesuits; he also attacked Johannes Wtenbogaert, whom he branded a 'courtly trumpeter.'\" The assembly took offence against this polemical tone, which contrasted with Arminius's eirenicism, and ordered the speeches made before them by both men to be banned from publication. Despite the ban the speeches soon appeared in print.\n\nOn July 25, 1609, Jacobus Bontebal defended the theses \"De vocatione hominis ad salutem\" under Arminius's presidency. A Roman Catholic priest (rumored to be a Jesuit) was in the audience and dared to oppose Arminius' positions. While an already seriously ill Arminius refuted the arguments, Gomarus \"who was among the audience, became alternately flushing and deathly pale, and afterwards, while the Papist was within earshot, he insultingly remarked to his colleague that now the door to Papism had been widely opened.\"\n\nArminius remained as a teacher at Leiden until his death, and was valued by his students. Still, the conflict with Gomarus widened out into a large-scale split within Calvinism. Of the local clergy, Adrianus Borrius supported Arminius, while Festus Hommius opposed him. Close friends, students and supporters of Arminius included Johannes Drusius, Conrad Vorstius, Anthony Thysius, Johannes Halsbergius, Petrus Bertius, Johannes Arnoldi Corvinus, and the brothers Rembert and Simon Episcopius. His successor at Leiden (again selected with the support of Uytenbogaert and Oldenbarnevelt) was Vorstius, a past influence on Arminius by his writings.\n\nOnce again the States attempted to tamp down the growing controversy without calling a synod. Arminius was ordered to attend another conference with Gomarus in The Hague in on 13-14th August 1609. When the conference was to reconvene on the 18th August, Arminius' health began to fail and so he returned to Leiden. The States suspended the conference and asked both men for a written reaction to their adversary's viewpoint.\n\nArminius died on October 19, 1609 at his house at the Pieterskerkhof. He was buried in the Pieterskerk at Leiden, where a memorial stone on his behalf was placed in 1934.\n\nIn attempting to defend Calvinistic predestination against the teachings of Dirck Volckertszoon Coornhert, Arminius began to doubt aspects of Calvinism and modified some parts of his own view. He attempted to reform Calvinism, and lent his name to a movement—Arminianism—which resisted some of the Calvinist tenets (unconditional election, the nature of the limitation of the atonement, and irresistible grace). The early Dutch followers of his teaching became known as Remonstrants after they issued a document containing five points of disagreement with mainstream Calvinism, entitled \"Remonstrantiæ\" (1610).\n\nArminius wrote that he sought to teach only those things which could be proved from the Scriptures and that tended toward edification among Christians (with the exception of Roman Catholics, with whom he said there could be no spiritual accord). His motto was reputed to be \"Bona conscientia paradisus\", meaning, \"A good conscience is a paradise.\"\n\nArminius taught of a \"preventing\" (or prevenient) grace that has been conferred upon all by the Holy Spirit and this grace is \"sufficient for belief, in spite of our sinful corruption, and thus for salvation.\" Arminius stated that \"the grace sufficient for salvation is conferred on the Elect, and on the Non-elect; that, if they will, they may believe or not believe, may be saved or not be saved.\" William Witt states that \"Arminius has a very high theology of grace. He insists emphatically that grace is gratuitous because it is obtained through God's redemption in Christ, not through human effort.\"\n\nThe theology of Arminianism did not become fully developed during Arminius' lifetime, but after his death (1609) the \"Five articles of the Remonstrants\" (1610) systematized and formalized the ideas. But the Calvinist Synod of Dort (1618–19), convening for the purpose of condemning Arminius' theology, declared it and its adherents anathemas, defined the five points of Calvinism, and persecuted Arminian pastors who remained in the Netherlands. But in spite of persecution, \"the Remonstrants continued in Holland as a distinct church and again and again where Calvinism was taught Arminianism raised its head.\"\n\nPublishers in Leiden (1629) and at Frankfurt (1631 and 1635) issued the works of Arminius in Latin.\n\nJohn Wesley (1703–91), the founder of the Methodist movement, embraced Arminian theology and became its most prominent champion. , the majority of Methodists remain committed to Arminian theology, and Arminianism itself has become one of the dominant theological systems in the United States, thanks in large part to the influence of John and Charles Wesley.\n\n\n"}

There he taught Hidesaburo Saito, one of the first Japanese writers of English Grammar, and Natsume Sōseki, a famous novelist and ex-university professor, who disliked his style of teaching English literature. While Natsume Sōseki was in the 2nd year of his undergraduate program at Tokyo University Dixon requested him to translate Hōjōki.

{"id": "4970822", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4970822", "title": "Japanese Zen", "text": "Japanese Zen\n\nZen is the Japanese variant of Chan Buddhism, a Mahayana school that strongly emphasizes dhyana concentration-meditation. This practice, according to Zen proponents, gives insight into one's true nature, or the emptiness of inherent existence, which opens the way to a liberated way of living.\n\nAccording to tradition, Zen originated in India, when Gautama Buddha held up a flower and Mahākāśyapa smiled. With this smile he showed that he had understood the wordless essence of the dharma. This way the dharma was transmitted to Mahākāśyapa, the second patriarch of Zen.\n\nThe term Zen is derived from the Japanese pronunciation of the Middle Chinese word 禪 (Chan) which traces its roots to the Indian practice of dhyāna (\"meditation\"). Buddhism was introduced to China in the first century CE. According to tradition, Chan was introduced around 500 CE by Bodhidharma, an Indian monk teaching dhyāna. He was the 28th Indian patriarch of Zen and the first Chinese patriarch.\n\nBuddhism was introduced in Japan in the 8th century CE during the Nara period (710-794) and the Heian period (794–1185). Zen was not introduced as a separate school in Japan until the 12th century during the Kamakura period (1185–1333), when Nōnin established the Daruma-school. In 1189 Nōnin sent two students to China, to meet with Cho-an Te-kuang (1121–1203), and ask for the recognition of Nōnin as a Zen-master. This recognition was granted.\n\nIn 1168, Eisai traveled to China, whereafter he studied Tendai for twenty years. In 1187 he went to China again, and returned to establish a local branch of the Linji school, which is known in Japan as the Rinzai school. Decades later, (1235–1308) also studied Linji teachings in China before founding the Japanese Ōtōkan lineage, the most influential branch of Rinzai.\n\nIn 1215, Dōgen, a younger contemporary of Eisai's, journeyed to China himself, where he became a disciple of the Caodong master Rujing. After his return, Dōgen established the Sōtō school, the Japanese branch of Caodong.\n\nZen fit the way of life of the samurai: confronting death without fear, and acting in a spontaneous and intuitive way.\n\nDuring this period the Five Mountain System was established, which institutionalized an influential part of the Rinzai school. It consisted of the five most famous Zen temples of Kyoto: Kenchō-ji, Engaku-ji, Jufuku-ji, Jōmyō-ji and Jōchi-ji.\n\nDuring the Muromachi period the Rinzai school was the most successful of the schools, since it was favoured by the \"shōgun\".\n\nIn the beginning of the Muromachi period the Gozan system was fully worked out. The final version contained five temples of both Kyoto and Kamakura. A second tier of the system consisted of Ten Temples. This system was extended throughout Japan, effectively giving control to the central government, which administered this system. The monks, often well educated and skilled, were employed by the \"shōgun\" for the governing of state affairs.\n\nNot all Rinzai Zen organisations were under such strict state control. The Rinka monasteries, which were primarily located in rural areas rather than cities, had a greater degree of independence. The O-to-kan lineage, that centered on Daitoku-ji, also had a greater degree of freedom. It was founded by Nampo Jomyo, Shuho Myocho, and Kanzan Egen. A well-known teacher from Daitoku-ji was Ikkyū.\n\nAnother Rinka lineage was the Hotto lineage, of which Bassui Tokushō is the best-known teacher.\n\nSoto too spread out over Japan. Gasan adopted the Five Ranks of Tung-shan as a fit vehicle to explain the Mahayana teachings.\n\nAfter a period of war Japan was re-united in the Azuchi–Momoyama period. This decreased the power of Buddhism, which had become a strong political and military force in Japan. Neo-Confucianism gained influence at the expense of Buddhism, which came under strict state control. Japan closed the gates to the rest of the world. The only traders to be allowed were Dutchmen admitted to the island of Dejima. New doctrines and methods were not to be introduced, nor were new temples and schools. The only exception was the Ōbaku lineage, which was introduced in the 17th century during the Edo period by Ingen, a Chinese monk. Ingen had been a member of the Linji school, the Chinese equivalent of Rinzai, which had developed separately from the Japanese branch for hundreds of years. Thus, when Ingen journeyed to Japan following the fall of the Ming dynasty to the Manchu people, his teachings were seen as a separate school. The Ōbaku school was named after , which had been Ingen's home in China.\n\nWell-known Zen masters from this period are Bankei, Bashō and Hakuin. Bankei Yōtaku (盤珪永琢?, 1622–1693) became a classic example of a man driven by the \"great doubt\". Matsuo Bashō (松尾 芭蕉?, 1644 – November 28, 1694) became a great Zen poet. In the 18th century Hakuin Ekaku (白隠 慧鶴?, 1686–1768) revived the Rinzai school. His influence was so immense that almost all contemporary Rinzai lineages are traced back to him.\n\nThe Meiji period (1868–1912) saw the restoration of the political importance of the Emperor after a coup in 1868. At that time Japan opened up to Western influences, restructuring all government and commercial structures to Western standards. Shinto became the state religion and Buddhism was coerced to adapt to the new regime. The Buddhist establishment saw the Western world as a threat, but also as a challenge to stand up to.\n\nShinto became the official religion, at the expense of Buddhism. Buddhist institutions had a simple choice: adapt or perish. Rinzai and Soto Zen chose to adapt, trying to modernize Zen in accord with Western insights, while simultaneously maintaining a Japanese identity. This Japanese identity was being articulated in the Nihonjinron philosophy, the \"Japanese uniqueness\" theory. A broad range of subjects was taken as typical of Japanese culture. D.T. Suzuki contributed to the Nihonjinron-philosophy by taking Zen as the distinctive token of Asian spirituality, showing its unique character in the Japanese culture\n\nThis resulted in support for the war activities of the Japanese imperial system by the Japanese Zen establishment—including the Sōtō sect, the major branches of Rinzai, and several renowned teachers. According to Sharf,\n\nWar endeavours against Russia, China and finally during the Pacific War were supported by the Zen establishment.\n\nA notable work on this subject was \"Zen at War\" (1998) by Brian Victoria, an American-born Sōtō priest. One of his assertions was that some Zen masters known for their post-war internationalism and promotion of \"world peace\" were open Japanese nationalists in the inter-war years. Among them as an example Hakuun Yasutani, the founder of the Sanbo Kyodan School, even voiced antisemitic and nationalistic opinions after World War II. Only after international protests in the 1990s, following the publication of Victoria's 'Zen at war', did the Sanbo Kyodan express apologies for this support This involvement was not limited to the Zen schools, as all orthodox Japanese schools of Buddhism supported the militarist state. Victoria's particular claims about D. T. Suzuki's involvement in militarism have been much disputed by other scholars.\n\nInterest in Zen grew in the West after World War II. Westerners such as Philip Kapleau and the Dutchman Janwillem van de Wetering went to Japan to study Zen. Japanese teachers came to the West to share Zen practice and philosophy.\n\nSome contemporary Japanese Zen teachers, such as Harada Daiun Sogaku and Shunryū Suzuki, have criticized Japanese Zen as being a formalized system of empty rituals in which very few Zen practitioners ever actually attained realization. They assert that almost all Japanese temples have become family businesses handed down from father to son, and the Zen priest's function has largely been reduced to officiating at funerals, a practice sarcastically referred to in Japan as . For example, the Sōtō school published statistics stating that 80 percent of laity visited temples only for reasons having to do with funerals and death.\n\nMahayana Buddhism teaches śūnyatā, \"emptiness\", which is also emphasized by Zen. But another important doctrine is the buddha-nature, the idea that all human beings have the possibility to awaken. All living creatures are supposed to have the Buddha-nature, but don't realize this as long as they are not awakened. The doctrine of an essential nature can easily lead to the idea that there is an unchanging essential nature or reality behind the changing world of appearances.\n\nThe difference and reconciliation of these two doctrines is the central theme of the \"Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra\".\n\nThe primary goal of Rinzai Zen is \"kensho\", seeing one's true nature, and \"mujodo no taigen\", expression of this insight in daily life.\n\n\"Seeing one's true nature\" means seeing that there is no essential 'I' or 'self', that our true nature is empty.\n\n\"Expression in daily life\" means that this is not only a contemplative insight, but that our lives are expressions of this selfless existence.\n\nZen meditation is the essential method of Zen. In Rinzai Zen this is supplemented by kōan training.\n\nZen emphasizes zazen: meditation as the means to awakening. There are various methods of meditation. In Buddhism two main approaches are used, vipaśyanā (insight training) and śamatha (concentration of the mind). Zen Buddhism emphasizes \"samātha\". The Japanese word \"Zen\" is derived from the Chinese word 禅, , which is derived from the Sanskrit \"dhyāna\" \"meditation\". The Japanese word \"zazen\" means \"sitting meditation\". However, Zen meditation ideally is not only concentration, but also awareness: being aware of the continuing changes in our consciousness, of all our sensations and our automatic reactions.\n\nIn alternation with zazen, there is walking meditation, \"kinhin\", in which one walks with full attention.\n\nTo facilitate insight, a Zen teacher can assign a kōan. This is a short anecdote, which seems irrational, but contains subtle references to the Buddhist teachings. An example of a kōan is Joshu's 'Mu': \"A monk asked: \"Does a dog have buddha-nature?\" Joshu responded: \"Mu!\"\"\n\nThe traditional schools of Zen in contemporary Japan are the Sōtō (), Rinzai (), and Ōbaku (). Of these, Sōtō is the largest and Ōbaku the smallest. Besides these there are modern Zen organizations which have especially attracted Western lay followers, namely the Sanbo Kyodan and the FAS Society.\n\nSōtō emphasizes meditation and the inseparable nature of practice and insight. Its founder Dogen is still highly revered.\n\nRinzai emphasizes kōan study and kensho. The Rinzai organisation includes fifteen subschools based on temple affiliation. The best known of these main temples are Myoshin-ji, Nanzen-ji, Tenryū-ji, Daitoku-ji, and Tofuku-ji.\n\nŌbaku is a small branch, which organizationally, is part of the Rinzai school.\n\nThe Sanbo Kyodan is a small Japanese school, established by Hakuun Yasutani, which has been very influential in the West. Well-known teachers from this school are Philip Kapleau and Taizan Maezumi. Maezumi's influence stretches further through his dharma heirs, such as Joko Beck, Tetsugen Bernard Glassman, and especially Dennis Merzel, who has appointed more than a dozen dharma heirs.\n\nThe FAS Society is a non-sectarian organization, founded by Shin'ichi Hisamatsu. Its aim is to modernize Zen and adapt it to the modern world. In Europe it is influential through such teachers as Jeff Shore and Ton Lathouwers.\n\nAlthough it is difficult to trace when the West first became aware of Zen as a distinct form of Buddhism, the visit of Soyen Shaku, a Japanese Zen monk, to Chicago during the World Parliament of Religions in 1893 is often pointed to as an event that enhanced its profile in the Western world. It was during the late 1950s and the early 1960s that the number of Westerners pursuing a serious interest in Zen, other than descendants of Asian immigrants, reached a significant level.\n\nEugen Herrigel's book \"Zen in the Art of Archery\" describing his training in the Zen-influenced martial art of Kyūdō, inspired many of the Western world's early Zen practitioners. However, many scholars, such as Yamada Shoji, are quick to criticize this book.\n\nThe single most influential person for the spread of Zen Buddhism was D. T. Suzuki. A lay student of Zen, he became acquainted with Western culture at a young age. He wrote many books on Zen which became widely read in the Western world, but he has been criticised for giving a one-sided and overly romanticized vision of Zen.\n\nReginald Horace Blyth (1898–1964) was an Englishman who went to Japan in 1940 to further his study of Zen. He was interned during World War II and started writing in prison. While imprisoned he met Robert Aitken, who was later to become a roshi in the Sanbo Kyodan lineage. Blyth was tutor to the Crown Prince after the war. His greatest work is the 5-volume \"Zen and Zen Classics\", published in the 1960s. Here he discusses Zen themes from a philosophical standpoint, often in conjunction with Christian elements in a comparative spirit. His essays include \"God, Buddha, and Buddhahood\" and \"Zen, Sin, and Death\".\n\nThe British philosopher Alan Watts took a close interest in Zen Buddhism and wrote and lectured extensively on it during the 1950s. He understood Zen as a vehicle for a mystical transformation of consciousness, and also as a historical example of a non-Western, non-Christian way of life that had fostered both the practical and fine arts.\n\n\"The Dharma Bums\", a novel written by Jack Kerouac and published in 1959, gave its readers a look at how a fascination with Buddhism and Zen was being absorbed into the bohemian lifestyles of a small group of American youths, primarily on the West Coast. Beside the narrator, the main character in this novel was \"Japhy Ryder\", a thinly veiled depiction of Gary Snyder. The story was based on actual events taking place while Snyder prepared, in California, for the formal Zen studies that he would pursue in Japanese monasteries between 1956 and 1968.\n\nThomas Merton (1915–1968) was a Catholic Trappist monk and priest. Like his friend, the late D.T. Suzuki, Merton believed that there must be a little of Zen in all authentic creative and spiritual experience. The dialogue between Merton and Suzuki explores the many congruencies of Christian mysticism and Zen.\n\nHugo Enomiya-Lassalle (1898–1990) was a Jesuit who became a missionary in Japan in 1929. In 1956 he started to study Zen with Harada Daiun Sogaku. He was the superior of Heinrich Dumoulin, the well-known author on the history of Zen. Enomiya-lassalle introduced Westerners to Zen meditation.\n\nRobert Kennedy (roshi), a Catholic Jesuit priest, professor, psychotherapist and Zen roshi in the White Plum lineage has written a number of books about what he labels as the benefits of Zen practice to Christianity. He was ordained a Catholic priest in Japan in 1965, and studied with Yamada Koun in Japan in the 1970s. He was installed as a Zen teacher of the White Plum Asanga lineage in 1991 and was given the title 'Roshi' in 1997.\n\nIn 1989, the Vatican released a document which states some Catholic appreciation of the use of Zen in Christian prayer. According to the text none of the methods proposed by non-Christian religions should be rejected out of hand simply because they are not Christian: \n\nWhile \"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\", by Robert M. Pirsig, was a 1974 bestseller, it in fact has little to do with Zen as a religious practice, nor with motorcycle maintenance for that matter. Rather it deals with the notion of the metaphysics of \"quality\" from the point of view of the main character. Pirsig was attending the Minnesota Zen Center at the time of writing the book. He has stated that, despite its title, the book \"should in no way be associated with that great body of factual information relating to orthodox Zen Buddhist practice\". Though it may not deal with orthodox Zen Buddhist practice, Pirsig's book in fact deals with many of the more subtle facets of Zen living and Zen mentality without drawing attention to any religion or religious organization.\n\nA number of contemporary authors have explored the relationship between Zen and a number of other disciplines, including parenting, teaching, and leadership. This typically involves the use of Zen stories to explain leadership strategies.\n\nIn Europe, the Expressionist and Dada movements in art tend to have much in common thematically with the study of kōans and actual Zen. The early French surrealist René Daumal translated D.T. Suzuki as well as Sanskrit Buddhist texts.\n\nOver the last fifty years mainstream forms of Zen, led by teachers who trained in East Asia and their successors, have begun to take root in the West.\n\nIn North America, the Zen lineages derived from the Sanbo Kyodan school are the most numerous. The Sanbo Kyodan is a Japan-based reformist Zen group, founded in 1954 by Yasutani Hakuun, which has had a significant influence on Zen in the West. Sanbo Kyodan Zen is based primarily on the Soto tradition, but also incorporates Rinzai-style kōan practice. Yasutani's approach to Zen first became prominent in the English-speaking world through Philip Kapleau's book \"The Three Pillars of Zen\" (1965), which was one of the first books to introduce Western audiences to Zen as a practice rather than simply a philosophy. Among the Zen groups in North America, Hawaii, Europe, and New Zealand which derive from Sanbo Kyodan are those associated with Kapleau, Robert Aitken, and John Tarrant.\n\nThe most widespread are the lineages founded by Hakuyu Taizan Maezumi and the White Plum Asanga. Maezumi's successors include Susan Myoyu Andersen, John Daido Loori, Chozen Bays, Tetsugen Bernard Glassman, Nicolee Jikyo McMahon, Joan Hogetsu Hoeberichts, and Charlotte Joko Beck.\n\nSoto has gained prominence via Shunryu Suzuki, who established the San Francisco Zen Center. In 1967 the Center established Tassajara, the first Zen Monastery in America, in the mountains near Big Sur.\n\nThe Katagiri lineage, founded by Dainin Katagiri, has a significant presence in the Midwest. Note that both Taizan Maezumi and Dainin Katagiri served as priests at Zenshuji Soto Mission in the 1960s.\n\nTaisen Deshimaru, a student of Kodo Sawaki, was a Soto Zen priest from Japan who taught in France. The International Zen Association, which he founded, remains influential. The American Zen Association, headquartered at the New Orleans Zen Temple, is one of the North American organizations practicing in the Deshimaru tradition.\n\nSoyu Matsuoka established the Long Beach Zen Buddhist Temple and Zen Center in 1971, where he resided until his death in 1998. The Temple was headquarters to Zen centers in Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles, Seattle, and Everett, Washington.\nMatsuoka created several dharma heirs, three of whom are still alive and leading Zen teachers within the lineage: Hogaku ShoZen McGuire, Zenkai Taiun Michael Elliston Sensei, and Kaiten John Dennis Govert.\n\nBrad Warner is a Soto priest appointed by Gudo Wafu Nishijima. He is not a traditional Zen teacher, but is influential via his blogs on Zen.\n\nRinzai gained prominence in the West via D.T. Suzuki and the lineage of Soen Nakagawa and his student Eido Shimano. Soen Nakagawa had personal ties to Yamada Koun, the dharma heir of Hakuun Yasutani, who founded the Sanbo Kyodan. They established Dai Bosatsu Zendo Kongo-ji in New York. In Europe there is Havredal Zendo established by a Dharma Heir of Eido Shimano, Egmund Sommer (Denko Mortensen).\n\nSome of the more prominent Rinzai Zen centers in North America include Rinzai-ji founded by Kyozan Joshu Sasaki Roshi in California, Chozen-ji founded by Omori Sogen Roshi in Hawaii, Daiyuzenji founded by Dogen Hosokawa Roshi (a student of Omori Sogen Roshi) in Chicago, Illinois, and Chobo-Ji founded by Genki Takabayshi Roshi in Seattle, Washington.\n\nThe lineage of Hakuyu Taizan Maezumi Roshi is represented in the UK by the White Plum Sangha UK.\n\nThrossel Hole Buddhist Abbey was founded as a sister monastery to Shasta Abbey in California by Master Reverend Jiyu Kennett Roshi. It has a number of dispersed priories and centres. Jiyu Kennett, an Englishwoman, was ordained as a priest and Zen master in Shoji-ji, one of the two main Soto Zen temples in Japan. The Order is called the Order of Buddhist Contemplatives.\n\nTaisen Deshimaru Roshi's lineage is known in the UK as IZAUK (International Zen Association UK).\n\nThe Zen Centre in London is connected to the Buddhist Society.\n\nThe Western Chan Fellowship is an association of lay Chán practitioners based in the UK. They are registered as a charity in England and Wales, but also have contacts in Europe, principally in Norway, Poland, Germany, Croatia, Switzerland and the US.\n\n\nThe start of this article was based on a translation of the Dutch Wikipedia (7 December 2011)\nModern classics\n\nClassic historiography\n\nCritical historiography\n\n(Japanese) Zen as living religious institution and practice\n\n\nOversight\n\nRinzai-zen\n\nSoto-zen\n\nSanbo Kyodan\n\nCritical Zen-practice\n\nZen centers\n\nTexts\n\nCritical Zen Research\n"}

Jesa functions as a memorial to the ancestors of the participants. Jesa are usually held on the anniversary of the ancestor's death. The majority of Catholics, Buddhists and nonbelievers practice ancestral rites, although Protestants do not. The Catholic ban on ancestral rituals was lifted in 1939, when the Pope Pius XII of the Catholic Church formally recognized ancestral rites as a civil practice (see Chinese Rites controversy). Many Korean American Christians, particularly Protestants, no longer practice this rite.\n\nThere are several kinds of ancestor rituals such as gijesa (기제사, 忌祭祀), charye (차례, 茶禮), seongmyo (성묘, 省墓), myosa (묘사, 墓祀). Gijesa is a memorial service which is held on the day of the ancestor's death every year. Gijesa is performed until upwards of five generations of ancestors in the eldest descendant's house. Memorial services that are performed on Chuseok or New Year's Day are called \"charye,\" On April 5 and before Chuseok, Koreans visit the tombs of their ancestors and trim the grass off the tombs. Then, they offer food, fruits, and wine, and finally make bows in front of the tombs. Memorial services that are performed in front of tombs are called \"seongmyo\" Finally Myosa are performed at the tomb site in the lunar month of October to conduct in memory of old ancestors (five or more generations)..\n\nAncestral rites are typically divided into 3 categories:\n\nTo perform ancestor rituals, the family at the eldest son's house prepare many kinds of food such as wine, taro soup, beef, fish, three different colored vegetables, many kinds of fruits, and rice cake or songpyon, particularly those that were favored by the deceased. The \"shinwi\" (신위, 神位) or memorial tablet, which symbolizes the spiritual presence of the ancestor, is placed at the center of the table. In modern days, the daughter or younger son of the family may perform these rites.\n\nAfter midnight or in the evening before an ancestor's death anniversary, the descendants set the shrine, with a paper screen facing north and food laid out on a lacquer table as follows: rice, meat, and white fruits on the west, soup, fish, and red fruits on the east, with fruits on the first row, meat and fish on the second, vegetables on the third, and cooked rice and soup on the last. The rice bowls and individual offerings to the male ancestors are placed to the west, and those of females to the east (고서비동, 考西妣東). Two candles are also laid on both ends of the table, and an incense holder is placed in the middle. In front of the shrine, they set up written prayer, if the family does not own a memorial tablet (신위).\n\nA typical rite is generally performed following this sequence:\n\nThe altar food may be distributed to neighbors and friends in a Buddhist rite called \"shishik\", which is a form of merit-making that, along with sutra reading and intoning of Buddha's teachings, expedities the deceased spirit's entry into Sukhavati.\n\nAncestor worship has significantly changed in recent years. These days it is common to hold ancestor rituals up to only two generations of ancestors, and in some cases, people only hold rituals for their dead parents. In addition, more people are holding rituals in the evening, not after midnight. People can also perform ancestor rituals in a younger son's house.\n\nToday, in most Korean families, ancestor rituals still remain an important part of their culture and they are faithfully observed. These ancestor rituals, in spite of revised form, continue to play an important part in modern Korean society, which testifies to their inherent importance in the lives of Koreans.\n\nIn Andong during the Joseon Dynasty, it was common for jesa foods to be eaten rather than used in the ceremony. Such meals were called \"heotjesatbap\" or \"fake jesa food.\" The most common dish was a special type of bibimbap mixed with soy sauce (ganjang) instead of the more commonly used hot pepper paste gochujang. They were a common late-night snack for yangban scholars known as seonbi's, and many restaurants in Andong still serve heotjesatbap today.\n\n"}

After Indian Independence, it became difficult for Indians to go to Sri Lanka for studies. In 1955, Papal Seminary along with its Athenaeum moved to Pune. The Athenaeum of the Papal Seminary adopted the Indian name Jnana-Deepa Vidyapeeth in 1972 (see the Jnana-Deepa Vidyapeeth Handbook and Calendar 2015-2016 pp. 8–10). In 2015 it celebrated its diamond jubilee of transfer to Pune. It continues to offer philosophy and theology courses for those studying for the Catholic priesthood. It also serves as an intellectual centre for the Catholic Church in India, having taken a leading role in promoting inculturation since the 1970s. Its \"Department of Indian Studies\" brings \"Indian\" insights to the Christian faith.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s JDV was the driving force for inculturation, inter-religious dialog, and \"liberation theology\" for the Indian church. Personalities like Richard De Smet, George Lobo, and George-Soares Prabhu enabled JDV to lead a Catholic movement toward the concerns of the poor and marginalised in Indian society. Sara Grant taught philosophy and theology at the institute.\n\nJDV has continued in its pioneering activities in the Indian church, for more than a decade pursuing dialog between science and religion. It offers a Masters in Science and Religion (MSPR). More practical, contextual studies in sacred scripture have seen a revival, with the addition of a master's program in contextual spirituality. Diploma and Master's Programme in Ignatian Spirituality began in the academic year 2016-17. Also, a pastoral management course was instituted for the administrative and service sector.\n\n\n"}

He was born as the third child of Tothchukpo House to his mother who is a scion of Gaden Lam family which traces its origin to Phajo Drukgom Zhigpo, the priest who brought Drukpa Kagyu tradition of Tibetan Buddhism to western Bhutan. Karma learnt basic Chokey alphabets and prayers from his father, who is an incarnate priest and farmer from the Tsakaling Choje family, a religious nobility which claims descent from Bhutan's foremost spiritual saint Pema Lingpa and Tarshong Chukpo house of Ura. He attended Ura Primary School until Class III. Because the school did not have Class IV and he was too small to travel, his parents begged the headmaster to keep him in Ura and repeat. The following year, he travelled to Jakar School with a few friends. The headmaster at the new school mistakenly put Karma again in Class III. Karma today humorously claims that he is perhaps the only person who studied in Class III for three years and received first prizes thrice. Karma spent most of his school winter breaks helping the family cow herder in the neighbouring district of Lhuntse.\n\nIn 1986, he came to Thimphu and had a short spell at Yangchenphug Higher Secondary School before leaving school to become a monk and study Buddhism at Chagri Monastery. Later, he went to south India to continue his studies spending a year at Sera Monastery then ten years at the Ngagyur Nyingma Institute Since 1994, he has taught Buddhism and related subjects and has served a lecturer at the Ngagyur Nyingma Institute in Byallkuppe and for two years as an abbot at the Shugseb Nunnery in Dharamshala.\n\nIn 1997, partly he says because young Bhutanese educated in English looked down on monks even though they were very learned, he joined Balliol College Oxford and read for an M.St. in Sanskrit and Classical Indian Religions under Richard Gombrich, Seyfort Ruegg and Michael Aris. In 2003, he received a D.Phil. in Buddhist Studies from Oxford University. He worked as a post-doctoral researcher in CNRS, Paris and as a Research Associate in the Department of Social Anthropology, Cambridge University. He was also the Spalding Fellow in Comparative Religions at Clare Hall and ran The Historical Study and Documentation of the Pad Gling Traditions in Bhutan project subsequently he spent years creating a digital archive of rare Bhutanese manuscripts. Dr Phuntsho is the first Bhutanese to receive a D.Phil from Oxford and the first Bhutanese to become an Oxbridge Fellow. \nIn Bhutan he has founded the Loden Foundation, a charity to promote education and entrepreneurship in Bhutan as well as the Shejun Agency for Bhutan's Cultural Documentation and Research.\n\nLopen Karma specialises in Buddhism, Tibetan & Himalayan Studies and Bhutan, and has published a number of works including eight books, translations, book reviews and articles on Buddhism, Bhutan and Tibetan Studies.

{"id": "33020957", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33020957", "title": "Levi Bryant", "text": "Levi Bryant\n\nLevi Bryant, born Paul Reginald Bryant, is a Professor of Philosophy at Collin College in the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.\n\nBryant has also written extensively about post-structural and cultural theory, including the work of Gilles Deleuze, Jacques Lacan, Jacques Rancière, and Slavoj Žižek. His blog, \"Larval Subjects\", was founded in 2006 and had over 2 million hits as of September 2011.\n\nIn addition to working as a professor, Bryant has also served as a Lacanian psychoanalyst.\n\nBryant became interested in philosophy as a teenager, after struggling through personal turmoil. He received his Ph.D. from Loyola University in Chicago, Illinois, where he originally intended to study 'disclosedness' with the Heidegger scholar Thomas Sheehan. Bryant later changed his dissertation topic to the transcendental empiricism of Gilles Deleuze, with his analysis becoming the basis of his first book, \"Difference and Givenness: Deleuze's Transcendental Empiricism and the Ontology of Immanence\", published in 2008.\n\nHe was a member of the object-oriented philosophy movement and coined the term object-oriented ontology in 2009 to distinguish positions that are committed to the thesis that beings are composed of things from Graham Harman's object-oriented philosophy. His own version of object-oriented thought, called 'onticology', disprivileges human experience from a central position in metaphysical inquiry, while holding that objects are always split between two domains, \"virtuality\" and \"actuality\". For Bryant, \"virtuality\" refers to the powers and potential of any given object, whereas \"actuality\" designates the qualities manifested by the actualization of an object's potential at any given point in time. Later Bryant, concerned with the doctrine of withdrawal and the non-relationism of object-oriented philosophy, departed from the object-oriented ontology movement and developed a machine-oriented ontology that argues being is composed entirely of machines or processes.\n\nLike other object-oriented ontologists, Bryant opposes the anthropocentrism of the Copernican Revolution proposed by Immanuel Kant, wherein objects are said to conform to the mind of the subject and, in turn, become products of human cognition. From Bryant's perspective, the Kantian contention that reality is inaccessible to human knowledge because it is structured by human cognition limits philosophy to a self-reflexive analysis of the mechanisms and institutions through which cognition structures reality. He states:\n\nTo counter the form of post-Kantian epistemology, Bryant articulates an object-oriented philosophy called 'onticology', grounded in three principles. First, the \"Ontic Principle\" states that \"there is no difference that does not make a difference.\" Following from the premises that questions of difference precede epistemological interrogation and that to be is to produce differences, this principle posits that knowledge cannot be fixed prior to engagement with difference. Consequently, for Bryant, the thesis that things-in-themselves exist outside the boundaries of knowledge is untenable because it presupposes forms of being that make no differences. Similarly, concepts of difference predicated upon negation—that which objects are not or lack when placed in comparison with one another—are dismissed as arising only from the perspective of consciousness, rather than an ontological difference that affirms independent being. Second, the \"Principle of the Inhuman\" asserts that the concept of difference producing difference is not restricted to human, sociocultural, or epistemological domains, thereby marking the being of difference as independent of knowledge and consciousness. Humans exist as difference-making beings among other difference-making beings, therefore, without holding any special position with respect to other differences. Third, the \"Ontological Principle\" maintains that if there is no difference that does not also make a difference, then the making of difference is the minimal condition for the existence of being. In Bryant's words, \"if a difference is made, then the being is.\" Bryant further contends that differences produced by an object can be \"inter-ontic\" (made with respect to another object) or \"intra-ontic\" (pertaining the internal constitution of the object).\n\nSince onticology construes anything that produces differences—including fictions, signs, animals, and plants—as being equally real, albeit at different scales, it is what Manuel Delanda has called a \"flat ontology.\" Within an onticological framework, objects are composed of differences coalescing into a system that reproduces itself through time. Changes in the identity of an object are not changes in substance (defined by Bryant as \"a particular state attained by difference\"), however, but shifts in the qualities belonging to a substance. Qualities are the actualization of an object's inhered capacities or abilities, known as an object's \"powers\". The actualization of an object's power into qualities or properties at a specific place and time is called \"local manifestation\". Importantly, the occurrence of local manifestations does not require observation. In this way, qualities comprise \"actuality\", referring to the actualization of an object's potential at a particular spatiotemporal location among a multitude of material differences, whereas powers constitute \"virtuality\", or the potential retained by an object across time. As objects are distinct from local manifestations and one another, referred to as \"withdrawal\", their being is defined by the relations forming their internal structure, or \"endo-relations\", and retained powers. This withdrawn being is known as the \"virtual proper being\" of an object and denotes its enduring, unified substantiality. When relations external to an object, or \"exo-relations\", consistently induce the same local manifestations to the extent that the actualization of qualities tends toward stability (for example, the sky remaining blue because of the constancy of Rayleigh scattering on atmospheric particles), the set of relations forms a \"regime of attraction\".\n\nOnticology distinguishes between four different types of objects: Bright objects, dim objects, dark objects, and rogue objects. \"Bright objects\" are objects that strongly manifest themselves and heavily impact other objects, such as the ubiquity of cell phones in high-tech cultures. \"Dim objects\" lightly manifest themselves in an assemblage of objects; for example, a neutrino passing through solid matter without producing observable effects. \"Dark objects\" are objects that are so completely withdrawn that they produce no local manifestations and do not affect any other objects. \"Rogue objects\" are not chained to any given assemblage of objects, but instead wander in and out of assemblages, modifying relations within the assemblages into which they enter. Political protestors exemplify rogue objects by breaking with the norms and relations of a dominant political assemblage in order to forge new relations that challenge, change, or cast off the prior assemblage.\n\nAdditionally, Bryant has proposed the concept of 'wilderness ontology' to explain the philosophical pluralization of agency away from human privilege. For Bryant, wilderness ontology alludes to the being of being, or common essence \"characteristic of all entities and their relations to one another.\" Resisting the traditional notion of wilderness that views civilization (the \"inside\" world of social relations, language, and norms) as separate from wilderness (the \"outside\" world of plants, animals, and nature), wilderness ontology argues that \"wilderness\" contains all forms of being, including civilization. Accordingly, the practice of wilderness ontology involves experiencing oneself as a being amongst, rather than above, other beings. In generalizing the agential alterity of being as a foundational ontological principle, Bryant posits three theses: First, wilderness ontology signals the absence of ontological hierarchy, such that all forms of being exist on equal footing with one another. Second, wilderness ontology rejects the topological bifurcation of nature and culture into discrete domains, instead holding that cultural assemblages are only one possible set of relations into which nonhuman entities may enter in the wilderness. Third, wilderness ontology extends agency to all entities, human and nonhuman, rather than casting nonhuman entities as passive recipients of human meaning projection. Employing these theses, Bryant pluralizes agential being beyond human finitude, contending that in so doing, the intentionality of the nonhuman world may be investigated without reference to human intent.\n\n\n\n"}

One can include works of the communities of informal logic and paraconsistent logic.\n\nHowever, building on theories of defeasible reasoning (see John L. Pollock), systems have been built that define well-formedness of arguments, rules governing the process of introducing arguments based on fixed assumptions, and rules for shifting burden. Many of these logics appear in the special area of artificial intelligence and law, though the computer scientists' interest in formalizing dialectic originates in a desire to build decision support and computer-supported collaborative work systems.\n\nDialectic itself can be formalised as moves in a game, where an advocate for the truth of a proposition and an opponent argue.

{"id": "389912", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=389912", "title": "Michael Oakeshott", "text": "Michael Oakeshott\n\nMichael Joseph Oakeshott FBA (; 11 December 1901 – 19 December 1990) was an English philosopher and political theorist who wrote about philosophy of history, philosophy of religion, aesthetics, philosophy of education, and philosophy of law.\n\nOakeshott was the son of Frances Maude (Hellicar) and Joseph Francis Oakeshott, a civil servant and a member of the Fabian Society. George Bernard Shaw was a friend. Michael Oakeshott attended St George's School, Harpenden, from 1912 to 1920. He enjoyed his schooldays, and the Headmaster, Cecil Grant, later became a friend. \n\nIn 1920 Oakeshott became an undergraduate at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he read history. He obtained an MA and subsequently became a Fellow. While he was at Cambridge he admired the British idealist philosophers J. M. E. McTaggart and John Grote, and the medieval historian Zachary Nugent Brooke. The historian Herbert Butterfield was a contemporary and fellow member of the Junior Historians society.\n\nOakeshott was dismayed by the political extremism that occurred in Europe during the 1930s, and his surviving lectures from this period reveal a dislike of National Socialism and Marxism.\n\nAlthough Oakeshott, in his essay \"The Claim of Politics\" (1939), defended the right of individuals not to become directly involved, in 1941 he joined the British Army. He reportedly wished to join the Special Operations Executive (SOE), but the military decided that his appearance was \"too unmistakably English\" for him to conduct covert operations on the Continent. He was on active service in Europe with the intelligence unit Phantom, which had connections with the Special Air Service (SAS), but he was never in the front line.\n\nIn 1945 Oakeshott was demobilized and returned to Cambridge. In 1947 he left Cambridge for Nuffield College, Oxford, but after only a year there he secured an appointment as Professor of Political Science at the London School of Economics (LSE), succeeding the leftist Harold Laski. He was deeply unsympathetic to the student activism at LSE during the late 1960s, on the grounds that it disrupted the work of the university. Oakeshott retired from the LSE in 1969.\n\nIn his retirement he retreated to live quietly in a country cottage in Langton Matravers in Dorset. He lived long enough to experience increasing recognition, although he has become much more widely written about since his death.\n\nOakeshott refused an offer of being made a Companion of Honour, for which he was proposed by Margaret Thatcher.\n\nOakeshott's early work, some of which has been published posthumously as \"What is History? And Other Essays\" (2004) and \"The Concept of a Philosophical Jurisprudence\" (2007), shows that he was more interested in the philosophical problems that derived from his historical studies than he was in the history, even though he was employed as a historian.\n\nOakeshott published his first book, \"Experience and its Modes\", in 1933. He noted that the book owed much to Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and F. H. Bradley; commentators also noticed resemblances between this work and the ideas of thinkers such as R. G. Collingwood and Georg Simmel.\n\nThe book argued that our experience is usually modal, in the sense that we always have a governing perspective on the world, be it practical or theoretical. There are various theoretical approaches one may take to understanding the world: natural science and history for example are separate modes of experience. It was a mistake, he declared, to treat history as if it ought to be practised on the model of the natural sciences.\n\nPhilosophy, however, is not a modal interest. At this stage of his career, he saw philosophy as the world seen \"sub specie aeternitatis\", literally, 'under the aspect of eternity', free from presuppositions, whereas science and history and the practical mode relied on certain assumptions. Later (there is some disagreement about exactly when), Oakeshott adopted a pluralistic view of the various modes of experience, with philosophy just one 'voice' amongst others, though it retained its self-scrutinizing character.\n\nThe dominating principles of scientific and historical thought were quantity (the world \"sub specie quantitatis\") and being in the past (the world \"sub specie praeteritorum\"), respectively. Oakeshott distinguished the academic perspective on the past from the practical, in which the past is seen in terms of its relevance to \"our\" present and future. His insistence on the autonomy of history places him close to Collingwood, who also argued for the autonomy of historical knowledge.\n\nThe practical world view (the world \"sub specie voluntatis\") presupposed the ideas of will and of value in terms of which practical action in the arenas of politics, economics, and ethics made sense. Because all action is conditioned by presuppositions, Oakeshott was inclined to see any attempt to change the world as reliant upon a scale of values, which themselves presuppose a context of experience. Even the conservative disposition to maintain the status quo relies upon managing inevitable change, he would later elaborate in his essay 'On Being Conservative'.\n\nDuring this period Oakeshott published what became his best known work during his lifetime, the collection entitled \"Rationalism in Politics and Other Essays\" (1962). Some of the polemics against the direction post-World War II Britain was taking, in particular the acceptance of socialism, gained Oakeshott a reputation as a conservative, seeking to uphold the importance of tradition, and sceptical about rationalism and fixed ideologies. Bernard Crick described him as a 'lonely nihilist'.\n\nOakeshott's opposition to what he considered Utopian political projects is summed by his use of the analogy (possibly borrowed from the Marquess of Halifax, a 17th-century English author whom he admired) of a ship of state which has \"neither starting-place nor appointed destination...[and where] the enterprise is to keep afloat on an even keel\". He was a critic of the Cambridge historian E. H. Carr, historian of Soviet Russia, claiming that Carr had an uncritical attitude towards the Bolshevik regime, taking some of its propaganda at face value.\n\nIn his essay \"On Being Conservative\" (1956) Oakeshott explained what he regarded as the conservative disposition: \"To be conservative ... is to prefer the familiar to the unknown, to prefer the tried to the untried, fact to mystery, the actual to the possible, the limited to the unbounded, the near to the distant, the sufficient to the superabundant, the convenient to the perfect, present laughter to utopian bliss.\"\n\nOakeshott's political philosophy, as advanced in \"On Human Conduct\" (1975), is free of any form of party politics. The book's first part (\"On the Theoretical Understanding of Human Conduct\") develops a theory of human action as the exercise of intelligent agency in activities such as wanting and choosing, the second (\"On the Civil Condition\") discusses the formal conditions of association appropriate to such intelligent agents, described as \"civil\" or legal association, and the third (\"On the Character of a Modern European State\") examines how far this understanding of human association has affected politics and political ideas in post-Renaissance European history.\n\nOakeshott suggests that there had been two major modes or understandings of human social organization. In the first, which he calls \"enterprise association\" (or \"universitas\"), the state is understood as imposing some universal purpose (profit, salvation, progress, racial domination) on its subjects. By contrast, \"civil association\" (or \"societas\") is primarily a legal relationship in which laws impose obligatory conditions of action but do not require choosing one action rather than another.\n\nThe complex, often technical style of \"On Human Conduct\" found few readers, and its initial reception was mostly one of bafflement. Oakeshott, who rarely responded to critics, used an article in the journal \"Political Theory\" to reply sardonically to some of the contributions made at a symposium on the book.\n\nIn his posthumously-published \"The Politics of Faith and the Politics of Scepticism\", Oakeshott describes enterprise and civil association in different terms. Here, an enterprise association is seen as based in a fundamental faith in human ability to ascertain and grasp some universal \"good\" (i.e. the Politics of Faith), and civil association is seen as based in a fundamental scepticism about human ability to either ascertain or achieve this good (i.e. the Politics of Scepticism). Oakeshott considers power (especially technological power) as a necessary prerequisite for the Politics of Faith, because a) it allows people to believe they can achieve something great (e.g. something universally good), and b) it allows them to implement the policies necessary to achieve their goal. The Politics of Scepticism, on the other hand, rests on the idea that government should concern itself with preventing bad things from happening rather than enabling ambiguously good events.\n\nOakeshott employs the analogy of the adverb to describe the kind of restraint law involves. To him, laws prescribe \"adverbial conditions\": they condition our actions, but do not determine the substantive ends of our choices. For example, the law against murder is not a law against killing as such, but only a law against killing \"murderously\". Or, to choose a more trivial example, the law does not dictate that I have a car, but if I do, I must drive it on the same side of the road as everybody else. This contrasts with the rules of enterprise association in which those actions required by the governing are made compulsory for all.\n\nThe final work Oakeshott published in his own lifetime, \"On History\" (1983) returned to the idea that history is a distinct mode of experience, but built on the theory of action developed for \"On Human Conduct\". Much of \"On History\" had in fact been written at the same time, in the early 1970s.\n\nDuring the mid-1960s, Oakeshott declared an admiration for Wilhelm Dilthey, one of the pioneers of hermeneutics. \"On History\" can be interpreted as an essentially neo-Kantian enterprise of working out the conditions of the possibility of historical knowledge, work that Dilthey had begun.\n\nThe first three essays set out the distinction between the present of historical experience and the present of practical experience, as well as the concepts of historical situation, historical event, and what is meant by change in history. \"On History\" includes an essay on jurisprudence ('The Rule of Law'). It also included a retelling of \"The Tower of Babel\" in a modern setting in which Oakeshott expresses disdain for human willingness to sacrifice individuality, culture, and quality of life for grand collective projects. He attributes this behaviour to fascination with novelty, persistent dissatisfaction, greed, and lack of self-reflection.\n\nOakeshott's other works included a reader on \"The Social and Political Doctrines of Contemporary Europe\" consisting of selected texts illustrating the main doctrines of liberalism, national socialism, fascism, communism, and Roman Catholicism (1939). He was editor of an edition of Thomas Hobbes's \"Leviathan\" (1946), for which he provided an introduction recognized as a significant contribution to the literature by later scholars such as Quentin Skinner. Several of his essays on Hobbes were published during 1975 as \"Hobbes on Civil Association\". He wrote, with his Cambridge colleague Guy Griffith, \"A Guide to the Classics, or How to Pick The Derby Winner\" (1936), a guide to the principles of successful betting on horse-racing; this was his only non-academic work. He was the author of well over 150 essays and reviews, most of which have yet to be republished.\n\nJust before he died, Oakeshott approved two edited collections of his works, \"The Voice of Liberal Learning\" (1989), a collection of his essays on education, and a second, revised and expanded edition of \"Rationalism in Politics\" itself (1991). Posthumous collections of his writings include \"Morality and Politics in Modern Europe\" (1993), a lecture series he gave at Harvard in 1958, \"Religion, Politics, and the Moral Life\" (1993), essays mostly from his early and middle periods, \"The Politics of Faith and the Politics of Scepticism\" (1996), a manuscript from the 1950s contemporary with much of the material in \"Rationalism in Politics\" but written in a more considered tone.\n\nThe bulk of his papers are now in the Oakeshott archive at the London School of Economics. Further volumes of posthumous writings are in preparation, as is a biography, and during the first decade of the 21st century a series of monographs devoted to his work were published.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "92195", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=92195", "title": "Northrop Frye", "text": "Northrop Frye\n\nHerman Northrop Frye (July 14, 1912 – January 23, 1991) was a Canadian literary critic and literary theorist, considered one of the most influential of the 20th century.\n\nFrye gained international fame with his first book, \"Fearful Symmetry\" (1947), which led to the reinterpretation of the poetry of William Blake. His lasting reputation rests principally on the theory of literary criticism that he developed in \"Anatomy of Criticism\" (1957), one of the most important works of literary theory published in the twentieth century. The American critic Harold Bloom commented at the time of its publication that \"Anatomy\" established Frye as \"the foremost living student of Western literature.\" Frye's contributions to cultural and social criticism spanned a long career during which he earned widespread recognition and received many honours.\n\nBorn in Sherbrooke, Quebec, but raised in Moncton, New Brunswick, Frye was the third child of Herman Edward Frye and of Catherine Maud Howard. His much older brother, Howard, died in World War I; he also had a sister, Vera. His first cousin was the scientist Alma Howard. Frye went to Toronto to compete in a national typing contest in 1929. He studied for his undergraduate degree in philosophy at Victoria College in the University of Toronto, where he edited the college literary journal, \"Acta Victoriana\". He then studied theology at Emmanuel College (like Victoria College, a constituent part of the University of Toronto). After a brief stint as a student minister in Saskatchewan, he was ordained to the ministry of the United Church of Canada. He then studied at Merton College, Oxford, where he was a member and Secretary of the Bodley Club before returning to Victoria College, where he spent the remainder of his professional career.\n\nFrye rose to international prominence as a result of his first book, \"Fearful Symmetry\", published in 1947. Until then, the prophetic poetry of William Blake had long been poorly understood, and considered by some to be delusional ramblings. Frye found in it a system of metaphor derived from \"Paradise Lost\" and the Bible. His study of Blake's poetry was a major contribution. Moreover, Frye outlined an innovative manner of studying literature that was to deeply influence the study of literature in general. He was a major influence on Harold Bloom, Margaret Atwood, and others.\n\nIn 1974–1975 Frye was the Norton professor at Harvard University.\n\nNorthrop Frye did not have a Ph.D.\n\nThe intelligence service of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police spied on Frye, watching his participation in the anti-Vietnam War movement, an academic forum about China, and activism to end South African apartheid.\n\nFrye married Helen Kemp, an educator, editor and artist, in 1937. She died in Australia while accompanying Frye on a lecture tour. Two years after her death in 1986, he married Elizabeth Brown. He died in 1991 and was interred in Mount Pleasant Cemetery in Toronto, Ontario.\n\nThe insights gained from his study of Blake set Frye on his critical path and shaped his contributions to literary criticism and theory. He was the first critic to postulate a systematic theory of criticism, \"to work out,\" in his own words, \"a unified commentary on the theory of literary criticism\" (\"Stubborn Structure\" 160). In so doing, he shaped the discipline of criticism. Inspired by his work on Blake, Frye developed and articulated his unified theory ten years after \"Fearful Symmetry\", in the \"Anatomy of Criticism\" (1957). He described this as an attempt at a \"synoptic view of the scope, theory, principles, and techniques of literary criticism\" (\"Anatomy\" 3). He asked, \"what if criticism is a science as well as an art?\" (7), Thus, Frye launched the pursuit which was to occupy the rest of his career—that of establishing criticism as a \"coherent field of study which trains the imagination quite as systematically and efficiently as the sciences train the reason\" (Hamilton 34).\n\nAs A. C. Hamilton outlines in \"Northrop Frye: Anatomy of his Criticism\", Frye's assumption of coherence for literary \ncriticism carries important implications. Firstly and most fundamentally, it presupposes that literary criticism is a discipline in its own right, independent of literature. Claiming with John Stuart Mill that \"the artist . . . is not heard but overheard,\" Frye insists that\n\nThe axiom of criticism must be, not that the poet does not know what he is talking about, but that he cannot talk about what he knows. To defend the right of criticism to exist at all, therefore, is to assume that criticism is a structure of thought and knowledge existing in its own right, with some measure of independence from the art it deals with (\"Anatomy\" 5).\n\nThis \"declaration of independence\" (Hart xv) is necessarily a measured one for Frye. For coherence requires that the autonomy of criticism, the need to eradicate its conception as \"a parasitic form of literary expression, . . . a second-hand imitation of creative power\" (\"Anatomy\" 3), sits in dynamic tension with the need to establish integrity for it as a discipline. For Frye, this kind of coherent, critical integrity involves claiming a body of knowledge for criticism that, while independent of literature, is yet constrained by it: \"If criticism exists,\" he declares, \"it must be an examination of literature in terms of a conceptual framework derivable from an inductive survey of the literary field\" itself (\"Anatomy\" 7).\n\nIn seeking integrity for criticism, Frye rejects what he termed the deterministic fallacy. He defines this as the movement of \"a scholar with a special interest in geography or economics [to] express . . . that interest by the rhetorical device of putting his favorite study into a causal relationship with whatever interests him less\" (\"Anatomy\" 6). By attaching criticism to an external framework rather than locating the framework for criticism within literature, this kind of critic essentially \"substitute[s] a critical attitude for criticism.\" For Frye critical integrity means that \"the axioms and postulates of criticism . . . have to grow out of the art it deals with\" (\"Anatomy\" 6).\nTaking his cue from Aristotle, Frye's methodology in defining a conceptual framework begins inductively, \"follow[ing] the natural order and begin[ning] with the primary facts\" (\"Anatomy\" 15). The primary facts, in this case, are the works of literature themselves. And what did Frye's inductive survey of these \"facts\" reveal? Significantly, they revealed \"a general tendency on the part of great classics to revert to [primitive formulas]\" (\"Anatomy\" 17). This revelation prompted his next move, or rather, 'inductive leap':\nI suggest that it is time for criticism to leap to a new ground from which it can discover what the organizing or containing forms of its conceptual framework are. Criticism seems to be badly in need of a coordinating\nprinciple, a central hypothesis which, like the theory of evolution in biology, will see the phenomena it deals with as parts of a whole (\"Anatomy\" 16).\n\nArguing that \"criticism cannot be a systematic [and thus scientific] study unless there is a quality in literature which enables it to be so,\" Frye puts forward the hypothesis that \"just as there is an order of nature behind the natural sciences, so literature is not a piled aggregate of 'works,' but an order of words\" (\"Anatomy\" 17). This order of words constitutes criticism's conceptual framework, its coordinating principle.\n\nThe recurring primitive formulas Frye noticed in his survey of the \"greatest classics\" provide literature with an order of words, a \"skeleton\" which allows the reader \"to respond imaginatively to any literary work by seeing it in the larger perspective provided by its literary and social contexts\" (Hamilton 20). Frye identifies these formulas as the \"conventional myths and metaphors\" which he calls \"archetypes\" (\"Spiritus Mundi\" 118). The archetypes of literature exist, Frye argues, as an order of words, providing criticism with a conceptual framework and a body of knowledge derived not from an ideological system but rooted in the imagination itself. Thus, rather than interpreting literary works from some ideological 'position' — what Frye calls the \"superimposed critical attitude\" (\"Anatomy\" 7) — criticism instead finds integrity within the literary field itself.\n\nCriticism for Frye, then, is not a task of evaluation — that is, of rejecting or accepting a literary work — but rather simply of recognizing it for what it is and understanding it in relation to other works within the 'order of words' (Cotrupi 4). Imposing value judgments on literature belongs, according to Frye, \"only to the history of taste, and therefore follows the vacillations of fashionable prejudice\" (\"Anatomy\" 9). Genuine criticism \"progresses toward making the whole of literature intelligible\" (\"Anatomy\" 9) so that its goal is ultimately knowledge and not evaluation. For the critic in Frye's mode, then,\n\n. . . a literary work should be contemplated as a pattern of knowledge, an act that must be distinguished, at least initially, from any direct experience of the work, . . . [Thus] criticism begins when reading ends: no longer imaginatively subjected to a literary work, the critic tries to make sense out of it, not by going to some historical context or by commenting on the immediate experience of reading but by seeing its structure within literature and literature within culture (Hamilton 27).\n\nOnce asked whether his critical theory was Romantic, Frye responded, \"Oh, it's entirely Romantic, yes\" (Stingle 1). It is Romantic in the same sense that Frye attributed Romanticism to Blake: that is, \"in the expanded sense of giving a primary place to imagination and individual feeling\" (Stingle 2). As artifacts of the imagination, literary works, including \"the pre-literary categories of ritual, myth, and folk-tale\" (\"Archetypes\" 1450) form, in Frye's vision, a potentially unified imaginative experience. He reminds us that literature is the \"central and most important extension\" of mythology: \". . . every human society possesses a mythology which is inherited, transmitted and diversified by literature\" (\"Words with Power\" xiii). Mythology and literature thus inhabit and function within the same imaginative world, one that is \"governed by conventions, by its own modes, symbols, myths and genres\" (Hart 23). Integrity for criticism requires that it too operates within the sphere of the imagination, and not seek an organizing principle in ideology. To do so, claims Frye,\n. . . leaves out the central structural principles that literature derives from myth, the principles that give literature its communicating power across the centuries through all ideological changes. Such structural principles are certainly conditioned by social and historical factors and do not transcend them, but they retain a continuity of form that points to an identity of the literary organism distinct from all its adaptations to its social environment (\"Words with Power\" xiii).\n\nMyth therefore provides structure to literature simply because literature as a whole is \"displaced mythology\" (Bates 21). Hart makes the point well when he states that \"For Frye, the story, and not the argument, is at the centre of literature and society. The base of society is mythical and narrative and not ideological and dialectical\" (19). This idea, which is central in Frye's criticism, was first suggested to him by Giambattista Vico.\n\nFrye uses the terms 'centripetal' and 'centrifugal' to describe his critical method. Criticism, Frye explains, is essentially centripetal when it moves inwardly, towards the structure of a text; it is centrifugal when it moves outwardly, away from the text and towards society and the outer world. Lyric poetry, for instance, like Keats's \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\", is dominantly centripetal, stressing the sound and movement and imagery of the ordered words. Rhetorical novels, like \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\", are dominantly centrifugal, stressing the thematic connection of the stories and characters to the social order. The \"Ode\" has centrifugal tendencies, relying for its effects on elements of history and pottery and visual aesthetics. \"Cabin\" has centripetal tendencies, relying on syntax and lexical choice to delineate characters and establish mood. But the one veers inward, the other pushes outward. Criticism reflects these movements, centripetally focusing on the aesthetic function of literature, centrifugally on the social function of literature.\n\nWhile some critics or schools of criticism emphasize one movement over the other, for Frye, both movements are essential: \"criticism will always have two aspects, one turned toward the structure of literature and one turned toward the other cultural phenomena that form the social environment of literature\" (\"Critical Path\" 25). He would therefore agree, at least in part, with the New Critics of his day in their centripetal insistence on structural analysis. But for Frye this is only part of the story: \"It is right,\" he declares, \"that the first effort of critical apprehension should take the form of a rhetorical or structural analysis of a work of art. But a purely structural approach has the same limitation in criticism that it has in biology.\" That is, it doesn't develop \"any explanation of how the structure came to be what it was and what its nearest relatives are. Structural analysis brings rhetoric back to criticism, but we need a new poetics as well . . .\" (\"Archetypes\" 1447).\n\nFor Frye, this \"new poetics\" is to be found in the principle of the mythological framework, which has come to be known as 'archetypal criticism'. It is through the lens of this framework, which is essentially a centrifugal movement of backing up from the text towards the archetype, that the social function of literary criticism becomes apparent. Essentially, \"what criticism can do,\" according to Frye, \"is awaken students to successive levels of awareness of the mythology that lies behind the ideology in which their society indoctrinates them\" (Stingle 4). That is, the study of recurring structural patterns grants students an emancipatory distance from their own society, and gives them a vision of a higher human state — the Longinian sublime — that is not accessible directly through their own experience, but ultimately transforms and expands their experience, so that the poetic model becomes a model to live by. In what he terms a \"kerygmatic mode,\" myths become \"myths to live by\" and metaphors \"metaphors to live in,\" which \". . . not only work for us but constantly expand our horizons, [so that] we may enter the world of [kerygma or transformative power] and pass on to others what we have found to be true for ourselves\" (\"Double Vision\" 18).\n\nBecause of its important social function, Frye felt that literary criticism was an essential part of a liberal education, and worked tirelessly to communicate his ideas to a wider audience. \"For many years now,\" he wrote in 1987, \"I have been addressing myself primarily, not to other critics, but to students and a nonspecialist public, realizing that whatever new directions can come to my discipline will come from their needs and their intense if unfocused vision\" (\"Auguries\" 7). It is therefore fitting that his last book, published posthumously, should be one that he describes as being \"something of a shorter and more accessible version of the longer books, \"The Great Code\" and \"Words with Power\",\" which he asks his readers to read sympathetically, not \"as proceeding from a judgment seat of final conviction, but from a rest stop on a pilgrimage, however near the pilgrimage may now be to its close\" (\"Double Vision\" Preface).\n\nVico, in \"The New Science\", posited a view of language as fundamentally figurative, and introduced into Enlightenment discourse the notion of the role of the imagination in creating meaning. For Vico, poetic discourse is prior to philosophical discourse; philosophy is in fact derivative of poetry. Frye readily acknowledged the debt he owed to Vico in developing his literary theory, describing him as \"the first modern thinker to understand that all major verbal structures have descended historically from poetic and mythological ones\" (\"Words with Power\" xii).\n\nHowever, it was Blake, Frye's \"Virgilian guide\" (Stingle 1), who first awakened Frye to the \"mythological frame of our culture\" (Cotrupi 14). In fact, Frye claims that his \"second book [\"Anatomy\"] was contained in embryo in the first [\"Fearful Symmetry\"]\" (\"Stubborn Structure\" 160). For it was in reflecting on the similarity between Blake and Milton that Frye first stumbled upon the \"principle of the mythological framework,\" the recognition that \"the Bible was a mythological framework, cosmos or body of stories, and that societies live within a mythology\" (Hart 18). Blake thus led Frye to the conviction that the Bible provided Western societies with the mythology which informed all of Western literature. As Hamilton asserts, \"Blake's claim that 'the Old and New Testaments are the Great Code of Art' became the central doctrine of all [Frye's] criticism\" (39). This 'doctrine' found its fullest expression in Frye's appropriately named \"The Great Code\", which he described as \"a preliminary investigation of Biblical structure and typology\" whose purpose was ultimately to suggest \"how the structure of the Bible, as revealed by its narrative and imagery, was related to the conventions and genres of Western literature\" (\"Words with Power\" xi).\n\nFrye's international reputation allowed him to champion Canadian literature at a time when to do so was considered provincial. Frye argued that regardless of the formal quality of the writing, it was imperative to study Canadian literary productions in order to understand the Canadian imagination and its reaction to the Canadian environment. During the 1950s, Frye wrote annual surveys of Canadian poetry for the \"University of Toronto Quarterly\", which led him to observe recurrent themes and preoccupations in Canadian poetry. Subsequently, Frye elaborated on these observations, especially in his conclusion to Carl F. Klinck's \"Literary History of Canada\" (1965). In this work, Frye presented the idea of the \"garrison mentality\" as the attitude from which Canadian literature has been written. The garrison mentality is the attitude of a member of a community that feels isolated from cultural centres and besieged by a hostile landscape. Frye maintained that such communities were peculiarly Canadian, and fostered a literature that was formally immature, that displayed deep moral discomfort with \"uncivilized\" nature, and whose narratives reinforced social norms and values.\n\nFrye collected his disparate writings on Canadian writing and painting in (1971). He coined phrases like \"the Garrison Mentality\", a theme that summarizes Canadian Literature. Margaret Atwood adopted his approach and elaborated on this in her book (1972).\nFrye also aided James Polk in compiling \"Divisions on a Ground: Essays on Canadian Culture\" (1982). In the posthumous \"Collected Works of Northrop Frye\", his writings on Canada occupy the thick 12th volume.\n\nBased on his observations of Canadian literature, Frye concluded that, by extension, Canadian identity was defined by a fear of nature, by the history of settlement and by unquestioned adherence to the community. However, Frye perceived the ability and advisability of Canadian (literary) identity to move beyond these characteristics. Frye proposed the possibility of movement beyond the literary constraints of the garrison mentality: growing urbanization, interpreted as greater control over the environment, would produce a society with sufficient confidence for its writers to compose more formally advanced detached literature.\n\nFrye was elected to the Royal Society of Canada in 1951 and awarded the Royal Society's Lorne Pierce Medal (1958) and its Pierre Chauveau Medal (1970). He was named University Professor by the University of Toronto in 1967. He won the Canada Council Molson Prize in 1971, and the Royal Bank Award in 1978. In 1987 he received the Governor General's Literary Award and the Toronto Arts Lifetime Achievement Award. He was an Honorary Fellow or Member of the following:\n\nNorthrop Frye was made a Companion of the Order of Canada in 1972. In 2000, he was honoured by the government of Canada with his image on a postage stamp. An international literary festival The Frye Festival, named in Frye's honour, takes place every April in Moncton, New Brunswick.\n\nThe Northrop Frye Centre, part of Victoria College at the University of Toronto, was named in his honour, as was the Humanities Stream of the \"Vic One\" Program at Victoria College and the Northrop Frye Centre for Comparative Literature at the University of Toronto.\n\nNorthrop Frye School in Moncton was named in his honour. A statue shows Frye sitting on a park bench outside the entrance to the Moncton Public Library. Another casting of the statue and bench sits at Victoria College at the University of Toronto.\n\nFrye was named a National Historic Person in 2018.\n\nThe following is a list of his books, including the volumes in the \"Collected Works of Northrop Frye\", an ongoing project under the editorship of Alvin A. Lee.\n\nBeyond these publications, Frye edited fifteen books, composed essays and chapters that appear in over sixty books, and wrote over one hundred articles and reviews in academic journals. From 1950 to 1960 he wrote the annual critical and bibliographical survey of \"Canadian poetry for Letters in Canada, University of Toronto Quarterly.\"\n\n"}

These are software products available with its source code under an open-source license to study, change, and improve its design. Examples of some popular open-source software products are Mozilla Firefox, Google Chromium, Android, LibreOffice and the VLC media player. Open-source software development has been a large part of the creation of the World Wide Web as we know it, with Tim Berners-Lee contributing his HTML code development as the original platform upon which the internet is now built.\n\nIn 1997, Eric S. Raymond wrote \"The Cathedral and the Bazaar\". In this book, Raymond makes the distinction between two kinds of software development. The first is the conventional closed-source development. This kind of development method is, according to Raymond, like the building of a cathedral; central planning, tight organization and one process from start to finish. The second is the progressive open-source development, which is more like \"a great babbling bazaar of differing agendas and approaches out of which a coherent and stable system could seemingly emerge only by a succession of miracles.\" The latter analogy points to the discussion involved in an open-source development process.\n\nDifferences between the two styles of development, according to Bar and Fogel, are in general the handling (and creation) of bug reports and feature requests, and the constraints under which the programmers are working. In closed-source software development, the programmers are often spending a lot of time dealing with and creating bug reports, as well as handling feature requests. This time is spent on creating and prioritizing further development plans. This leads to part of the development team spending a lot of time on these issues, and not on the actual development. Also, in closed-source projects, the development teams must often work under management-related constraints (such as deadlines, budgets, etc.) that interfere with technical issues of the software. In open-source software development, these issues are solved by integrating the users of the software in the development process, or even letting these users build the system themselves.\n\nOpen-source software development can be divided into several phases. The phases specified here are derived from \"Sharma et al\". A diagram displaying the process-data structure of open-source software development is shown on the right. In this picture, the phases of open-source software development are displayed, along with the corresponding data elements. This diagram is made using the meta-modeling and meta-process modeling techniques.\n\nThere are several ways in which work on an open-source project can start:\n\n\nEric Raymond observed in his essay \"The Cathedral and the Bazaar\" that announcing the intent for a project is usually inferior to releasing a working project to the public.\n\nIt's a common mistake to start a project when contributing to an existing similar project would be more effective (NIH syndrome). To start a successful project it is very important to investigate what's already there. The process starts with a choice between the adopting of an existing project, or the starting of a new project. If a new project is started, the process goes to the Initiation phase. If an existing project is adopted, the process goes directly to the Execution phase.\n\nSeveral types of open-source projects exist. First, there is the garden variety of software programs and libraries, which consist of standalone pieces of code. Some might even be dependent on other open-source projects. These projects serve a specified purpose and fill a definite need. Examples of this type of project include the Linux kernel, the Firefox web browser and the LibreOffice office suite of tools.\n\nDistributions are another type of open-source project. Distributions are collections of software that are published from the same source with a common purpose. The most prominent example of a \"distribution\" is an operating system. There are many Linux distributions (such as Debian, Fedora Core, Mandriva, Slackware, Ubuntu etc.) which ship the Linux kernel along with many user-land components. There are other distributions, like ActivePerl, the Perl programming language for various operating systems, and Cygwin distributions of open-source programs for Microsoft Windows.\n\nOther open-source projects, like the BSD derivatives, maintain the source code of an entire operating system, the kernel and all of its core components, in one revision control system; developing the entire system together as a single team. These operating system development projects closely integrate their tools, more so than in the other distribution-based systems.\n\nFinally, there is the book or standalone document project. These items usually do not ship as part of an open-source software package. The Linux Documentation Project hosts many such projects that document various aspects of the GNU/Linux operating system. There are many other examples of this type of open-source project.\n\nIt is hard to run an open-source project following a more traditional software development method like the waterfall model, because in these traditional methods it is not allowed to go back to a previous phase. In open-source software development, requirements are rarely gathered before the start of the project; instead they are based on early releases of the software product, as Robbins describes. Besides requirements, often volunteer staff is attracted to help develop the software product based on the early releases of the software. This networking effect is essential according to Abrahamsson et al.: “if the introduced prototype gathers enough attention, it will gradually start to attract more and more developers”. However, Abrahamsson et al. also point out that the community is very harsh, much like the business world of closed-source software: “if you find the customers you survive, but without customers you die”.\n\nFuggetta argues that “rapid prototyping, incremental and evolutionary development, spiral lifecycle, rapid application development, and, recently, extreme programming and the agile software process can be equally applied to proprietary and open source software”. He also pinpoints Extreme Programming as an extremely useful method for open source software development. More generally, all Agile programming methods are applicable to open-source software development, because of their iterative and incremental character. Other Agile method are equally useful for both open and closed source software development:Internet-Speed Development, for example is suitable for open-source software development because of the distributed development principle it adopts. Internet-Speed Development uses geographically distributed teams to ‘work around the clock’. This method, mostly adopted by large closed-source firms, (because they're the only ones which afford development centers in different time zones), works equally well in open source projects because a software developed by a large group of volunteers shall naturally tend to have developers spread across all time zones.\n\nDevelopers and users of an open-source project are not all necessarily working on the project in proximity. They require some electronic means of communications. E-mail is one of the most common forms of communication among open-source developers and users. Often, electronic mailing lists are used to make sure e-mail messages are delivered to all interested parties at once. This ensures that at least one of the members can reply to it. In order to communicate in real time, many projects use an instant messaging method such as IRC. Web forums have recently become a common way for users to get help with problems they encounter when using an open-source product. Wikis have become common as a communication medium for developers and users.\n\nIn OSS development the participants, who are mostly volunteers, are distributed amongst different geographic regions so there is need for tools to aid participants to collaborate in the development of source code.\n\nDuring early 2000s, Concurrent Versions System (CVS) was a prominent example of a source code collaboration tool being used in OSS projects. CVS helps manage the files and codes of a project when several people are working on the project at the same time. CVS allows several people to work on the same file at the same time. This is done by moving the file into the users’ directories and then merging the files when the users are done. CVS also enables one to easily retrieve a previous version of a file. During mid 2000s, The Subversion revision control system (SVN) was created to replace CVS. It is quickly gaining ground as an OSS project version control system.\n\nMany open-source projects are now using distributed revision control systems, which scale better than centralized repositories such as SVN and CVS. Popular examples are git, used by the Linux kernel, and Mercurial, used by the Python programming language.\n\nMost large-scale projects require a bug tracking system to keep track of the status of various issues in the development of the project. Some bug trackers include:\n\n\nSince OSS projects undergo frequent integration, tools that help automate testing during system integration are used. An example of such tool is Tinderbox. Tinderbox enables participants in an OSS project to detect errors during system integration. Tinderbox runs a continuous build process and informs users about the parts of source code that have issues and on which platform(s) these issues arise.\n\nA debugger is a computer program that is used to debug (and sometimes test or optimize) other programs. GNU Debugger (GDB) is an example of a debugger used in open-source software development. This debugger offers remote debugging, what makes it especially applicable to open-source software development.\n\nA memory leak tool or memory debugger is a programming tool for finding memory leaks and buffer overflows. A memory leak is a particular kind of unnecessary memory consumption by a computer program, where the program fails to release memory that is no longer needed. Examples of memory leak detection tools used by Mozilla are the XPCOM Memory Leak tools.\nValidation tools are used to check if pieces of code conform to the specified syntax. An example of a validation tool is Splint.\n\nA package management system is a collection of tools to automate the process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing software packages from a computer. The Red Hat Package Manager (RPM) for .rpm and Advanced Packaging Tool (APT) for .deb file format, are package management systems used by a number of Linux distributions.\n\nSoftware directories and release logs:\n\n\nArticles:\n\n\n\n<br>\n\n"}

Through the notion of \"Suddha Sanmarga Sangam\", the saint endeavored to eliminate the caste system. According to Suddha Sanmarga, the prime aspects of human life should be love connected with charity and divine practice leading to achievement of pure knowledge.\n\nRamalinga advocated the concept of worshipping the flame of a lighted lamp as a symbol of the eternal Power.\n\nRāmalingam's parents were Rāmayyā pillai and Chinnammai. She was his sixth wife, as all his previous wives had died childless and in quick succession. They were a Karuneegar family in Marudhur, a village in the old South Arcot district, near Chidambaram. Rāmalingam was their fifth child. The older ones were two sons Sabhapati and Parasu Rāman; and two daughters, Sundarammal and Unnamulai. They named their youngest child Rāmalingam.\n\nOnce, Rāmalingam's parents went to the Chidambaram Natarājar Temple with their five month old child, and the infant was joyous while the priest was offering Deepa aradhana (adoration by lighted lamp being brought close to the vigrahams); this was perceived by Rāmalingam as a deep spiritual experience. In later years he said of the experience:\n\nIn 1824, his father Rāmayyā pillai died. Because of his untimely demise, Chinnammai shifted her residence to her mother's place at Chinna kāvanam. Saint Rāmalingam (1823 – 1874) was a small child when he relocated with his mother to Chennai in 1826. He and his mother lived with his eldest brother Sabhapati and his wife Pāppāthi at 31/14 Veerasamy Pillai Street, Sevenwells, Chennai-600001, which is in the area near Chennai Kandha kottam Kandha swāmi temple. After Rāmalingam reached five years of age, Sabhapati initiated his formal education. But the young child was not interested in that, instead he preferred trips to the nearby Kandha swāmi temple. Sabhapati thought that the child needed punishment as a form of discipline, and he told his wife not to give Rāmalingam his daily meal. His kind sister-in-law, however, secretly gave him food and persuaded him to study seriously at home. In return, Rāmalingam asked for his own room, lighted lamp and mirror. He placed the light in front of the mirror. He started meditation by concentrating on the light and thus began the young boy's spiritual life. He miraculously saw a vision of the Lord Muruga. Rāmalingam said:\n\nAt one time, Rāmalingam had to replace his elder brother Sabhapati at an upanyāsam (religious stories) session as upāsakar. His great discourse on verses from the `Periya purānam', an epic poem by Sekkizhar about the saintly '63 Nāyanārs', was appreciated by the devotees as being given by a very learned scholar. Rāmalingam's mental and spiritual growth progressed rapidly. Rāmalingam says thanks to the Divine by:\n\nRāmalingam evolved in his spiritual journey from being a devout devotee of Lord Shiva to worshipping the formless.\n\nRāmalingam renounced the world at the young age of thirteen. But he was forced to marry his niece (on his sister's side). Legends say that the bridegroom during his first night after marriage was reading devotional works like the Thiru vāsagam. He was not interested in money, and it is said that in later life he reduced or ignored eating and sleeping. But he seemed fit in body, which was possibly due to his supposed physical transformation.\n\nAt the age of 35 he left Chennai during the year 1858. First he went to Chidambaram where he had a debate with Kodakanallur Sundara Swāmigal. At the request of one Rāmakrishna Reddiyar he went to his house at Karunguzhi and stayed there for 9 years. He was very much against the caste system because of the adverse impacts it had on society. Towards that end, he started the \"Samarasa Vedha Sanmarga Sangam\" in 1865. In 1872 it was renamed \"Samarasa Suddha Sanmarga Sathya Sangam\", meaning \"Society for pure truth in universal self-hood\".\n\nIn 1867, he established a facility serving free food named \"The Sathya Dharma Salai\" in Vadalur. There all people are served free food without any caste distinctions. The land for the facility was donated by kind, generous people and those registered documents are available for seeing by the visitors. The free facility continues its service till the present time. Rāmalinga disliked people eating non-vegetarian foods, about which he said:When I see men feeding on the coarse and vicious food of meat, it is an ever-recurring grief to me.\n\nOn January 25th of 1872, Rāmalingam opened the \"Sathya Gnana Sabha\" (Hall of True Knowledge) at Vadalur. One of the primary teachings of Valallar is \"Service to Living Beings is the path of Liberation/ Moksha\". He declared that death is not natural that our life's first priority should be to fight death. He declared religion in itself a darkness. He laid a very great emphasis on being vegetarian. He said God is \"Arul Perum Jothi\" who is personification of Grace or mercy and knowledge. He said the path of compassion and mercy are the only path to God.\n\nIn 1867 he established a center for feeding the poor people. On the inaugural day he lit the fire of the stone stove, with a declaration that the fire be ever alive and the needy shall be fed forever. Around 1872 he established the \"Sathya Gnana Sabai\", hall of True Wisdom Forum and ensuring it was entirely secular. This place is not a temple; fruits, flowers are not offered, and no blessings were given. It was open to people of all castes except those who ate meat, who were only allowed to worship from the outside. He wrote in detail about the \"pooja\" to be performed in Gnāna sabai. Those who are below 12 years or those who are above 72 years alone were expected to enter Gnāna sabai and do \"poojas\". The oil lamp lit by him is kept perpetually burning. He said that souls are blinded by seven veils.\nThere are seven cotton fabric screens, representing the seven factors that prevent a soul from realizing its true nature. The entire complex is bound by a chain with 21,600 links, said to represent \"21,600 inhalations\" by a normal human being. He said the intelligence we possess is Maya intelligence which is not true and final intelligence. The path of final intelligence is \"Jeeva Karunyam\". He advocated a casteless society. Vallalār was opposed to superstitions and rituals. He forbade killing animals for the sake of food. He advocated feeding the poor as the highest form of worship. He condemned inequality based on birth. Today there are spiritual groups spread out all over the world who practice the teachings of Rāmalingam and follow the path of Arul Perum Jothi.\n\nKandha kottam Kandaswāmi Temple is located in the Parry's Corner (Old: George Town) neighbourhood of Chennai city in Tamil Nadu, India. Rāmalingam and his mother lived with his eldest brother Sabhapati and his wife Pāppāthi at 31/14 Veerasamy Pillai Street, Sevenwells, Chennai-600001, which is in the area near Chennai Kandha kottam Kandha swāmi temple. He spent a lot of his time at this temple. Rāmalingam composed 'Deiva mani malai' here. At this temple, there is a hall called the Mukha mandapam, where the idols of Sarva Siddhi Vinayakar, Meenakshi Sundareswarar, Idumban, Sri Rāmalinga swāmigal, and Pamban swāmigal are found. The locality where he lived, has been renamed as 'Vallalār nagar'.\n\nAs a musician and poet, he composed 5818 poems teaching universal love and peace, compiled into 'Six Thiru Muraigal', which are all available today as a single book called Thiruvarutpa (tiru-arut-pa, holy book of grace).\n\nAnother work of his is the Manumurai Kanda Vāsagam describing the life of Manu Needhi Cholan.\n\nJeeva Karunya Ozhukkam\n\n\nSome of his songs were set to music by Sīrkāzhi Govindharājan.\n\nPerhaps one of the most notable factors of this sage is the claim that he supposedly attained a divinization of the physical body. He attained a total of 3 transformations (i.e. transformations into Pure Body, Pranava (Sound) Body, and Gnostic Body). His first transformation was the transformation of his normal human body into the Perfect Body. The supposed attributes of this body are total invulnerability to everything thus rendering him effectively immortal and impervious to any kind of damage as well as having the attributes of being omnipotent, omnipresent and omniscient, this body is apparently made of Divine Light.\n\nBeyond this state there was a subsequent transformation by which the Perfect Body transformed further into the Grace Body possessing the following attributes: This body has automatically a young appearance like that of a child, can be seen but can't be touched, and has complete and absolute dominion over all the Siddhis.\n\nEven beyond the State of the Grace Body supposedly there was a third and final transformation in which the Grace Body was transformed into the Bliss Body. This body is the body of the Supreme Godhead and is automatically omnipresent but can't be perceived by anyone.\n\nBy achieving this Rāmalingam demonstrated that the ultimate states of spirituality can in fact be attained in this world with the physical body and death is not a necessity to experience the ultimate spiritual experience.\n\nOn October 22, 1873, Rāmalingam raised the \"flag of Brotherhood\" on his one-room residence \"Siddhi Valāgam\" in Mettukuppam. He gave his final and most popular lecture, about spiritual progress and, \"nature of the powers that lie beyond us and move us,\" and recommended meditation using the lighted lamp from his room, which he then kept outside.\n\nOn January 30, 1874, Rāmalingam entered the room, locked himself inside and told his followers not to open it. After opening, he said, he will not be found there. (He will be,\" United with Nature & ruling the actions of 'all of the alls'. \" - as told in his poem called 'Gnana Sariyai'). His seclusion spurred many rumors, and the Government finally forced the doors open in May. The room was empty, with no clues. In 1906, records about his disappearance were published in the South Arcot District's 'The Madras District Gazetteer'.\n\nThe Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu released postage stamps depicting Rāmalingam on 17 August 2007. After that writ petition was submitted against the portrayal of Rāmalingam with ‘Thiru neeru’ (sacred ash) on his forehead. But the Madras High Court has declined to entertain that writ petition.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "41093787", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41093787", "title": "The Wanderground", "text": "The Wanderground\n\nThe Wanderground is a speculative fiction novel by Sally Miller Gearhart, published in 1979 by Persephone Press. It is Gearhart's first and most famous novel, and continues to be used in Women's Studies classes as a characteristic example of the separatist feminism movement from the 1970s.\n\nThe Wanderground is a collection of short, interlocking narratives that build on each other to form a full novel. Chapters fit together loosely, often focusing on completely different characters in each chapter, or taking place in a different part of the world Gearhart created, although many characters make reappearances throughout the collection, as the stories begin to build on each other. Many of the chapters were first published as short stories, in fanzines, magazines, and lesbian periodicals including \"Ms.\", \"The Witch and the Chameleon\", \"Quest: A Feminist Quarterly\", and \"WomanSpirit\"\n\nThe Wanderground is set in the United States, in the future, although no date is given. The stories focus on the hill women, a group of women who have fled from the men-ruled cities to the wilderness, where they live in all-women communities in harmony with each other and the natural world. The hill women have psychic powers that they use to communicate with each other and with animals, and to move through the world. The main narrative that weaves throughout almost all of the stories, is caused by some kind of shift in the cosmic balance between the hill women and the cities. Rumors are whispered, things are getting worse for women in the cities. As the stories build on each other, subtle remarks are made about how things are getting worse, the cities are becoming even more controlling, it is more dangerous for the women underground, men are appearing outside of the cities, even to the point of rapes occurring in the borderlands. Something is changing. The tension finally comes to the foreground when the gentles (gay men, who have the greatest respect for all women, especially the hill women) request a meeting with the hill women. The message is smuggled out of the city, and a great discussion begins. Even though the gentles are considered to be allies of the hill women, they are still men, and this mixed status of ally and enemy causes a great debate.\n\nAs The Wanderground functions as a series of short stories in different parts of a world, the characters are listed here in association with the setting in which they appear.\n\nGender is a source of tension throughout the novel. Among the basic tenets of the relationship between the communities of hill women to men is \"It is not in his nature not to rape. It is not in my nature to be raped. We do not co-exist.\" (page 25). Gearhart said in an interview with \"off our backs\" that figuring out how those dynamics play out, the question of \"what is the hill women's relationship to the men\" is one of the main questions of the book.\n\nThis book is also linked by scholars with the idea of ecofeminism. The ideas it presents of women living as one with the greater natural world, of being able to control one's fertility, and of the communication with other non-human living beings, as well as the poetic style of prose Gearhart writes in are of particular interest to readers coming from an environmental background.\n"}
