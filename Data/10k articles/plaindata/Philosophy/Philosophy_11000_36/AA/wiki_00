He studied under Anderson at Sydney University and had taught philosophy in Scotland, New Zealand, the United States and Australia. He was a prominent member of the Sydney Libertarians and the Sydney Push. He instigated, and was a prolific contributor to, several journals, compilations and newsletters that addressed issues, philosophical and otherwise, associated with Sydney Libertarianism. Among these were \"Libertarian\" (1957 - 1960), \"Broadsheet\" (1960 - 1979), \"The Sydney Line: A Selection of Comments and Criticisms\" (1963), \"Heraclitus\" (1980 - 2006) and \"The Sydney Realist\" (2005 - ). In 1997 he published a monograph, \"Social Pluralism: A Realistic Analysis\", in which he posited his exposition of human social life.\n"}

The second portion of the pamphlet goes on to formulate that all motivations are derived from pain and that pain is met with an equal amount of pleasure. He then concludes that this means that man cannot be superior to animals because we are all equal in God’s eyes. Franklin acknowledges how offensive this idea would be to the reader, and refuted it later.\n\nThe point of the pamphlet seems to be that Christian Calvinism, which Franklin was raised with as a child but turned against in teenage years as a Deist, cannot logically be a moral way to live.\n\nIn 1779, Franklin came to disagree with the points he printed in \"Dissertation\" and burned all the copies he possessed of the pamphlet but one for historical purposes. However, since he had already come to give several copies to friends of his, four original copies still survive. They are in the possession of the British Museum, Library of Congress, John Carter Brown Library, and Yale University Library.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2122", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2122", "title": "Astrology", "text": "Astrology\n\nAstrology is the study of the movements and relative positions of celestial objects as a means of divining information about human affairs and terrestrial events. Astrology has been dated to at least the 2nd millennium BCE, and has its roots in calendrical systems used to predict seasonal shifts and to interpret celestial cycles as signs of divine communications. Many cultures have attached importance to astronomical events, and some – such as the Indians, Chinese, and Maya – developed elaborate systems for predicting terrestrial events from celestial observations. Western astrology, one of the oldest astrological systems still in use, can trace its roots to 19th–17th century BCE Mesopotamia, from which it spread to Ancient Greece, Rome, the Arab world and eventually Central and Western Europe. Contemporary Western astrology is often associated with systems of horoscopes that purport to explain aspects of a person's personality and predict significant events in their lives based on the positions of celestial objects; the majority of professional astrologers rely on such systems.\n\nThroughout most of its history astrology was considered a scholarly tradition and was common in academic circles, often in close relation with astronomy, alchemy, meteorology, and medicine. It was present in political circles, and is mentioned in various works of literature, from Dante Alighieri and Geoffrey Chaucer to William Shakespeare, Lope de Vega and Calderón de la Barca.\nDuring the 20th century and following the wide-scale adoption of the scientific method, astrology has been challenged successfully on both theoretical and experimental grounds, and has been shown to have no scientific validity or explanatory power. Astrology thus lost its academic and theoretical standing, and common belief in it has largely declined. While polling studies have demonstrated that approximately 25% of Americans, Canadians, and Britons say they continue to believe that star and planet positions affect their lives, astrology is now recognized as pseudoscience.\n\nThe word \"astrology\" comes from the early Latin word \"astrologia\", which derives from the Greek —from ἄστρον \"astron\" (\"star\") and -λογία \"-logia\", (\"study of\"—\"account of the stars\"). \"Astrologia\" later passed into meaning 'star-divination' with \"astronomia\" used for the scientific term.\n\nMany cultures have attached importance to astronomical events, and the Indians, Chinese, and Maya developed elaborate systems for predicting terrestrial events from celestial observations. In the West, astrology most often consists of a system of horoscopes purporting to explain aspects of a person's personality and predict future events in their life based on the positions of the sun, moon, and other celestial objects at the time of their birth. The majority of professional astrologers rely on such systems.\n\nAstrology has been dated to at least the 2nd millennium BCE, with roots in calendrical systems used to predict seasonal shifts and to interpret celestial cycles as signs of divine communications. A form of astrology was practised in the first dynasty of Mesopotamia (1950–1651 BCE). Chinese astrology was elaborated in the Zhou dynasty (1046–256 BCE). Hellenistic astrology after 332 BCE mixed Babylonian astrology with Egyptian Decanic astrology in Alexandria, creating horoscopic astrology. Alexander the Great's conquest of Asia allowed astrology to spread to Ancient Greece and Rome. In Rome, astrology was associated with 'Chaldean wisdom'. After the conquest of Alexandria in the 7th century, astrology was taken up by Islamic scholars, and Hellenistic texts were translated into Arabic and Persian. In the 12th century, Arabic texts were imported to Europe and translated into Latin. Major astronomers including Tycho Brahe, Johannes Kepler and Galileo practised as court astrologers. Astrological references appear in literature in the works of poets such as Dante Alighieri and Geoffrey Chaucer, and of playwrights such as Christopher Marlowe and William Shakespeare.\n\nThroughout most of its history, astrology was considered a scholarly tradition. It was accepted in political and academic contexts, and was connected with other studies, such as astronomy, alchemy, meteorology, and medicine. At the end of the 17th century, new scientific concepts in astronomy and physics (such as heliocentrism and Newtonian mechanics) called astrology into question. Astrology thus lost its academic and theoretical standing, and common belief in astrology has largely declined.\n\nAstrology, in its broadest sense, is the search for meaning in the sky. Early evidence for humans making conscious attempts to measure, record, and predict seasonal changes by reference to astronomical cycles, appears as markings on bones and cave walls, which show that lunar cycles were being noted as early as 25,000 years ago. This was a first step towards recording the Moon's influence upon tides and rivers, and towards organising a communal calendar. Farmers addressed agricultural needs with increasing knowledge of the constellations that appear in the different seasons—and used the rising of particular star-groups to herald annual floods or seasonal activities. By the 3rd millennium BCE, civilisations had sophisticated awareness of celestial cycles, and may have oriented temples in alignment with heliacal risings of the stars.\n\nScattered evidence suggests that the oldest known astrological references are copies of texts made in the ancient world. The Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa is thought to be compiled in Babylon around 1700 BCE. A scroll documenting an early use of electional astrology is doubtfully ascribed to the reign of the Sumerian ruler Gudea of Lagash (c. 2144 – 2124 BCE). This describes how the gods revealed to him in a dream the constellations that would be most favourable for the planned construction of a temple. However, there is controversy about whether these were genuinely recorded at the time or merely ascribed to ancient rulers by posterity. The oldest undisputed evidence of the use of astrology as an integrated system of knowledge is therefore attributed to the records of the first dynasty of Mesopotamia (1950–1651 BCE). This astrology had some parallels with Hellenistic Greek (western) astrology, including the zodiac, a norming point near 9 degrees in Aries, the trine aspect, planetary exaltations, and the dodekatemoria (the twelve divisions of 30 degrees each). The Babylonians viewed celestial events as possible signs rather than as causes of physical events.\n\nThe system of Chinese astrology was elaborated during the Zhou dynasty (1046–256 BCE) and flourished during the Han Dynasty (2nd century BCE to 2nd century CE), during which all the familiar elements of traditional Chinese culture – the Yin-Yang philosophy, theory of the five elements, Heaven and Earth, Confucian morality – were brought together to formalise the philosophical principles of Chinese medicine and divination, astrology and alchemy.\n\nCicero stated the twins objection (that with close birth times, personal outcomes can be very different), later developed by Saint Augustine. He argued that since the other planets are much more distant from the earth than the moon, they could have only very tiny influence compared to the moon's. He also argued that if astrology explains everything about a person's fate, then it wrongly ignores the visible effect of inherited ability and parenting, changes in health worked by medicine, or the effects of the weather on people.\n\nPlotinus argued that since the fixed stars are much more distant than the planets, it is laughable to imagine the planets' effect on human affairs should depend on their position with respect to the zodiac. He also argues that the interpretation of the moon's conjunction with a planet as good when the moon is full, but bad when the moon is waning, is clearly wrong, as from the moon's point of view, half of its surface is always in sunlight; and from the planet's point of view, waning should be better, as then the planet sees some light from the moon, but when the moon is full to us, it is dark, and therefore bad, on the side facing the planet.\n\nFavorinus argued that it was absurd to imagine that stars and planets would affect human bodies in the same way as they affect the tides, and equally absurd that small motions in the heavens cause large changes in people's fates. Sextus Empiricus argued that it was absurd to link human attributes with myths about the signs of the zodiac. Carneades argued that belief in fate denies free will and morality; that people born at different times can all die in the same accident or battle; and that contrary to uniform influences from the stars, tribes and cultures are all different.\n\nIn 525 BCE, Egypt was conquered by the Persians. The 1st century BCE Egyptian Dendera Zodiac shares two signs – the Balance and the Scorpion – with Mesopotamian astrology.\n\nWith the occupation by Alexander the Great in 332 BCE, Egypt became Hellenistic. The city of Alexandria was founded by Alexander after the conquest, becoming the place where Babylonian astrology was mixed with Egyptian Decanic astrology to create Horoscopic astrology. This contained the Babylonian zodiac with its system of planetary exaltations, the triplicities of the signs and the importance of eclipses. It used the Egyptian concept of dividing the zodiac into thirty-six decans of ten degrees each, with an emphasis on the rising decan, and the Greek system of planetary Gods, sign rulership and four elements. 2nd century BCE texts predict positions of planets in zodiac signs at the time of the rising of certain decans, particularly Sothis. The astrologer and astronomer Ptolemy lived in Alexandria. Ptolemy's work the \"Tetrabiblos\" formed the basis of Western astrology, and, \"...enjoyed almost the authority of a Bible among the astrological writers of a thousand years or more.\"\n\nThe conquest of Asia by Alexander the Great exposed the Greeks to ideas from Syria, Babylon, Persia and central Asia. Around 280 BCE, Berossus, a priest of Bel from Babylon, moved to the Greek island of Kos, teaching astrology and Babylonian culture. By the 1st century BCE, there were two varieties of astrology, one using horoscopes to describe the past, present and future; the other, theurgic, emphasising the soul's ascent to the stars. Greek influence played a crucial role in the transmission of astrological theory to Rome.\n\nThe first definite reference to astrology in Rome comes from the orator Cato, who in 160 BCE warned farm overseers against consulting with Chaldeans, who were described as Babylonian 'star-gazers'. Among both Greeks and Romans, Babylonia (also known as Chaldea) became so identified with astrology that 'Chaldean wisdom' became synonymous with divination using planets and stars. The 2nd-century Roman poet and satirist Juvenal complains about the pervasive influence of Chaldeans, saying, \"Still more trusted are the Chaldaeans; every word uttered by the astrologer they will believe has come from Hammon's fountain.\"\n\nOne of the first astrologers to bring Hermetic astrology to Rome was Thrasyllus, astrologer to the emperor Tiberius, the first emperor to have had a court astrologer, though his predecessor Augustus had used astrology to help legitimise his Imperial rights.\n\nThe main texts upon which classical Indian astrology is based are early medieval compilations, notably the \"\", and \"Sārāvalī\" by .\nThe \"Horāshastra\" is a composite work of 71 chapters, of which the first part (chapters 1–51) dates to the 7th to early 8th centuries and the second part (chapters 52–71) to the later 8th century. The \"Sārāvalī\" likewise dates to around 800 CE. English translations of these texts were published by N.N. Krishna Rau and V.B. Choudhari in 1963 and 1961, respectively.\n\nAstrology was taken up by Islamic scholars following the collapse of Alexandria to the Arabs in the 7th century, and the founding of the Abbasid empire in the 8th. The second Abbasid caliph, Al Mansur (754–775) founded the city of Baghdad to act as a centre of learning, and included in its design a library-translation centre known as \"Bayt al-Hikma\" 'House of Wisdom', which continued to receive development from his heirs and was to provide a major impetus for Arabic-Persian translations of Hellenistic astrological texts. The early translators included Mashallah, who helped to elect the time for the foundation of Baghdad, and Sahl ibn Bishr, (\"a.k.a.\" \"Zael\"), whose texts were directly influential upon later European astrologers such as Guido Bonatti in the 13th century, and William Lilly in the 17th century. Knowledge of Arabic texts started to become imported into Europe during the Latin translations of the 12th century.\n\nThe first astrological book published in Europe was the \"Liber Planetis et Mundi Climatibus\" (\"Book of the Planets and Regions of the World\"), which appeared between 1010 and 1027 AD, and may have been authored by Gerbert of Aurillac. Ptolemy's second century AD \"Tetrabiblos\" was translated into Latin by Plato of Tivoli in 1138. The Dominican theologian Thomas Aquinas followed Aristotle in proposing that the stars ruled the imperfect 'sublunary' body, while attempting to reconcile astrology with Christianity by stating that God ruled the soul. The thirteenth century mathematician Campanus of Novara is said to have devised a system of astrological houses that divides the prime vertical into 'houses' of equal 30° arcs, though the system was used earlier in the East. The thirteenth century astronomer Guido Bonatti wrote a textbook, the \"Liber Astronomicus\", a copy of which King Henry VII of England owned at the end of the fifteenth century.\n\nIn \"Paradiso\", the final part of the \"Divine Comedy\", the Italian poet Dante Alighieri referred \"in countless details\" to the astrological planets, though he adapted traditional astrology to suit his Christian viewpoint, for example using astrological thinking in his prophecies of the reform of Christendom.\n\nIn the seventh century, Isidore of Seville argued in his \"Etymologiae\" that astronomy described the movements of the heavens, while astrology had two parts: one was scientific, describing the movements of the sun, the moon and the stars, while the other, making predictions, was theologically erroneous. In contrast, John Gower in the fourteenth century defined astrology as essentially limited to the making of predictions. The influence of the stars was in turn divided into natural astrology, with for example effects on tides and the growth of plants, and judicial astrology, with supposedly predictable effects on people. The fourteenth century sceptic Nicole Oresme however included astronomy as a part of astrology in his \"Livre de divinacions\". Oresme argued that current approaches to prediction of events such as plagues, wars, and weather were inappropriate, but that such prediction was a valid field of inquiry. However, he attacked the use of astrology to choose the timing of actions (so-called interrogation and election) as wholly false, and rejected the determination of human action by the stars on grounds of free will. The friar Laurens Pignon (c. 1368–1449) similarly rejected all forms of divination and determinism, including by the stars, in his 1411 \"Contre les Devineurs\". This was in opposition to the tradition carried by the Arab astronomer Albumasar (787-886) whose \"Introductorium in Astronomiam\" and \"De Magnis Coniunctionibus\" argued the view that both individual actions and larger scale history are determined by the stars.\n\nRenaissance scholars commonly practised astrology. Gerolamo Cardano cast the horoscope of king Edward VI of England, while John Dee was the personal astrologer to queen Elizabeth I of England. Catherine de Medici paid Michael Nostradamus in 1566 to verify the prediction of the death of her husband, king Henry II of France made by her astrologer Lucus Gauricus. Major astronomers who practised as court astrologers included Tycho Brahe in the royal court of Denmark, Johannes Kepler to the Habsburgs, Galileo Galilei to the Medici, and Giordano Bruno who was burnt at the stake for heresy in Rome in 1600. The distinction between astrology and astronomy was not entirely clear. Advances in astronomy were often motivated by the desire to improve the accuracy of astrology.\n\nEphemerides with complex astrological calculations, and almanacs interpreting celestial events for use in medicine and for choosing times to plant crops, were popular in Elizabethan England. In 1597, the English mathematician and physician Thomas Hood made a set of paper instruments that used revolving overlays to help students work out relationships between fixed stars or constellations, the midheaven, and the twelve astrological houses. Hood's instruments also illustrated, for pedagogical purposes, the supposed relationships between the signs of the zodiac, the planets, and the parts of the human body adherents believed were governed by the planets and signs. While Hood's presentation was innovative, his astrological information was largely standard and was taken from Gerard Mercator's astrological disc made in 1551, or a source used by Mercator.\n\nEnglish astrology had reached its zenith by the 17th century. Astrologers were theorists, researchers, and social engineers, as well as providing individual advice to everyone from monarchs downwards. Among other things, astrologers could advise on the best time to take a journey or harvest a crop, diagnose and prescribe for physical or mental illnesses, and predict natural disasters. This underpinned a system in which everything—people, the world, the universe—was understood to be interconnected, and astrology co-existed happily with religion, magic and science.\n\nDuring the Enlightenment, intellectual sympathy for astrology fell away, leaving only a popular following supported by cheap almanacs. One English almanac compiler, Richard Saunders, followed the spirit of the age by printing a derisive \"Discourse on the Invalidity of Astrology\", while in France Pierre Bayle's \"Dictionnaire\" of 1697 stated that the subject was puerile. The Anglo-Irish satirist Jonathan Swift ridiculed the Whig political astrologer John Partridge.\n\nAstrology saw a popular revival starting in the 19th century, as part of a general revival of spiritualism and—later, New Age philosophy, and through the influence of mass media such as newspaper horoscopes. Early in the 20th century the psychiatrist Carl Jung developed some concepts concerning astrology, which led to the development of psychological astrology.\n\nAdvocates have defined astrology as a symbolic language, an art form, a science, and a method of divination. Though most cultural astrology systems share common roots in ancient philosophies that influenced each other, many use methods that differ from those in the West. These include Hindu astrology (also known as \"Indian astrology\" and in modern times referred to as \"Vedic astrology\") and Chinese astrology, both of which have influenced the world's cultural history.\n\nWestern astrology is a form of divination based on the construction of a horoscope for an exact moment, such as a person's birth. It uses the tropical zodiac, which is aligned to the equinoctial points.\n\nWestern astrology is founded on the movements and relative positions of celestial bodies such as the Sun, Moon and planets, which are analysed by their movement through signs of the zodiac (twelve spatial divisions of the ecliptic) and by their aspects (based on geometric angles) relative to one another. They are also considered by their placement in houses (twelve spatial divisions of the sky). Astrology's modern representation in western popular media is usually reduced to sun sign astrology, which considers only the zodiac sign of the Sun at an individual's date of birth, and represents only 1/12 of the total chart.\n\nThe horoscope visually expresses the set of relationships for the time and place of the chosen event. These relationships are between the seven 'planets', signifying tendencies such as war and love; the twelve signs of the zodiac; and the twelve houses. Each planet is in a particular sign and a particular house at the chosen time, when observed from the chosen place, creating two kinds of relationship. A third kind is the aspect of each planet to every other planet, where for example two planets 120° apart (in 'trine') are in a harmonious relationship, but two planets 90° apart ('square') are in a conflicted relationship. Together these relationships and their interpretations supposedly form \"...the language of the heavens speaking to learned men.\"\n\nAlong with tarot divination, astrology is one of the core studies of Western esotericism, and as such has influenced systems of magical belief not only among Western esotericists and Hermeticists, but also belief systems such as Wicca that have borrowed from or been influenced by the Western esoteric tradition. Tanya Luhrmann has said that \"all magicians know something about astrology,\" and refers to a table of correspondences in Starhawk's \"The Spiral Dance\", organised by planet, as an example of the astrological lore studied by magicians.\n\nThe earliest Vedic text on astronomy is the \"Vedanga Jyotisha\"; Vedic thought later came to include astrology as well.\n\nHindu natal astrology originated with Hellenistic astrology by the 3rd century BCE, though incorporating the Hindu lunar mansions. The names of the signs (e.g. Greek 'Krios' for Aries, Hindi 'Kriya'), the planets (e.g. Greek 'Helios' for Sun, astrological Hindi 'Heli'), and astrological terms (e.g. Greek 'apoklima' and 'sunaphe' for declination and planetary conjunction, Hindi 'apoklima' and 'sunapha' respectively) in Varaha Mihira's texts are considered conclusive evidence of a Greek origin for Hindu astrology. The Indian techniques may also have been augmented with some of the Babylonian techniques.\n\nChinese astrology has a close relation with Chinese philosophy (theory of the three harmonies: heaven, earth and man) and uses concepts such as yin and yang, the Five phases, the 10 Celestial stems, the 12 Earthly Branches, and shichen (時辰 a form of timekeeping used for religious purposes). The early use of Chinese astrology was mainly confined to political astrology, the observation of unusual phenomena, identification of portents and the selection of auspicious days for events and decisions.\n\nThe constellations of the Zodiac of western Asia and Europe were not used; instead the sky is divided into Three Enclosures (三垣 sān yuán), and Twenty-Eight Mansions (二十八宿 èrshíbā xiù) in twelve Ci (). The Chinese zodiac of twelve animal signs is said to represent twelve different types of personality. It is based on cycles of years, lunar months, and two-hour periods of the day (the shichen). The zodiac traditionally begins with the sign of the Rat, and the cycle proceeds through 11 other animals signs: the Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, and Pig. Complex systems of predicting fate and destiny based on one's birthday, birth season, and birth hours, such as \"ziping\" and Zi Wei Dou Shu () are still used regularly in modern-day Chinese astrology. They do not rely on direct observations of the stars.\n\nThe Korean zodiac is identical to the Chinese one. The Vietnamese zodiac is almost identical to Chinese zodiac except the second animal is the \"Water Buffalo\" instead of the \"Ox\", and the fourth animal is the \"Cat\" instead of the \"Rabbit\". The Japanese have since 1873 celebrated the beginning of the new year on 1 January as per the Gregorian calendar. The Thai zodiac begins, not at Chinese New Year, but either on the first day of fifth month in the Thai lunar calendar, or during the Songkran festival (now celebrated every 13–15 April), depending on the purpose of the use.\n\nSt. Augustine (354430) believed that the determinism of astrology conflicted with the Christian doctrines of man's free will and responsibility, and God not being the cause of evil, but he also grounded his opposition philosophically, citing the failure of astrology to explain twins who behave differently although conceived at the same moment and born at approximately the same time.\n\nSome of the practices of astrology were contested on theological grounds by medieval Muslim astronomers such as Al-Farabi (Alpharabius), Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) and Avicenna. They said that the methods of astrologers conflicted with orthodox religious views of Islamic scholars, by suggesting that the Will of God can be known and predicted in advance. For example, Avicenna's 'Refutation against astrology', \"Risāla fī ibṭāl aḥkām al-nojūm\", argues against the practice of astrology while supporting the principle that planets may act as agents of divine causation. Avicenna considered that the movement of the planets influenced life on earth in a deterministic way, but argued against the possibility of determining the exact influence of the stars. Essentially, Avicenna did not deny the core dogma of astrology, but denied our ability to understand it to the extent that precise and fatalistic predictions could be made from it. Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya (1292–1350), in his \"Miftah Dar al-SaCadah\", also used physical arguments in astronomy to question the practice of judicial astrology. He recognised that the stars are much larger than the planets, and argued: And if you astrologers answer that it is precisely because of this distance and smallness that their influences are negligible, then why is it that you claim a great influence for the smallest heavenly body, Mercury? Why is it that you have given an influence to al-Ra's and al-Dhanab, which are two imaginary points [ascending and descending nodes]?\n\nMaimonides, the preeminent Jewish philosopher, astronomer, and legal codifier, wrote that astrology is forbidden by Jewish law.\n\nThe Catechism of the Catholic Church maintains that divination, including predictive astrology, is incompatible with modern Catholic beliefs such as free will:\n\nThe scientific community rejects astrology as having no explanatory power for describing the universe, and considers it a pseudoscience. Scientific testing of astrology has been conducted, and no evidence has been found to support any of the premises or purported effects outlined in astrological traditions. There is no proposed mechanism of action by which the positions and motions of stars and planets could affect people and events on Earth that does not contradict well understood, basic aspects of biology and physics. Those who continue to have faith in astrology have been characterised as doing so \"...in spite of the fact that there is no verified scientific basis for their beliefs, and indeed that there is strong evidence to the contrary.\"\n\nConfirmation bias is a form of cognitive bias, a psychological factor that contributes to belief in astrology. Astrology believers tend to selectively remember predictions that turn out to be true, and do not remember those that turn out false. Another, separate, form of confirmation bias also plays a role, where believers often fail to distinguish between messages that demonstrate special ability and those that do not. Thus there are two distinct forms of confirmation bias that are under study with respect to astrological belief.\n\nUnder the criterion of falsifiability, first proposed by the philosopher of science Karl Popper, astrology is a pseudoscience. Popper regarded astrology as \"pseudo-empirical\" in that \"it appeals to observation and experiment,\" but \"nevertheless does not come up to scientific standards.\" In contrast to scientific disciplines, astrology has not responded to falsification through experiment.\n\nIn contrast to Popper, the philosopher Thomas Kuhn argued that it was not lack of falsifiability that makes astrology unscientific, but rather that the process and concepts of astrology are non-empirical. Kuhn thought that, though astrologers had, historically, made predictions that categorically failed, this in itself does not make astrology unscientific, nor do attempts by astrologers to explain away failures by claiming that creating a horoscope is very difficult. Rather, in Kuhn's eyes, astrology is not science because it was always more akin to medieval medicine; astrologers followed a sequence of rules and guidelines for a seemingly necessary field with known shortcomings, but they did no research because the fields are not amenable to research, and so \"they had no puzzles to solve and therefore no science to practise.\" While an astronomer could correct for failure, an astrologer could not. An astrologer could only explain away failure but could not revise the astrological hypothesis in a meaningful way. As such, to Kuhn, even if the stars could influence the path of humans through life astrology is not scientific.\n\nThe philosopher Paul Thagard asserts that astrology cannot be regarded as falsified in this sense until it has been replaced with a successor. In the case of predicting behaviour, psychology is the alternative. To Thagard a further criterion of demarcation of science from pseudoscience is that the state-of-the-art must progress and that the community of researchers should be attempting to compare the current theory to alternatives, and not be \"selective in considering confirmations and disconfirmations.\" Progress is defined here as explaining new phenomena and solving existing problems, yet astrology has failed to progress having only changed little in nearly 2000 years. To Thagard, astrologers are acting as though engaged in normal science believing that the foundations of astrology were well established despite the \"many unsolved problems,\" and in the face of better alternative theories (psychology). For these reasons Thagard views astrology as pseudoscience.\n\nFor the philosopher Edward W. James, astrology is irrational not because of the numerous problems with mechanisms and falsification due to experiments, but because an analysis of the astrological literature shows that it is infused with fallacious logic and poor reasoning.\n\nAstrology has not demonstrated its effectiveness in controlled studies and has no scientific validity. Where it has made falsifiable predictions under controlled conditions, they have been falsified. One famous experiment included 28 astrologers who were asked to match over a hundred natal charts to psychological profiles generated by the California Psychological Inventory (CPI) questionnaire. The double-blind experimental protocol used in this study was agreed upon by a group of physicists and a group of astrologers nominated by the National Council for Geocosmic Research, who advised the experimenters, helped ensure that the test was fair and helped draw the central proposition of natal astrology to be tested. They also chose 26 out of the 28 astrologers for the tests (two more volunteered afterwards). The study, published in \"Nature\" in 1985, found that predictions based on natal astrology were no better than chance, and that the testing \"...clearly refutes the astrological hypothesis.\"\n\nIn 1955, the astrologer and psychologist Michel Gauquelin stated that though he had failed to find evidence that supported indicators like zodiacal signs and planetary aspects in astrology, he did find positive correlations between the diurnal positions of some planets and success in professions that astrology traditionally associates with those planets. The best-known of Gauquelin's findings is based on the positions of Mars in the natal charts of successful athletes and became known as the \"Mars effect\". A study conducted by seven French scientists attempted to replicate the claim, but found no statistical evidence. They attributed the effect to selective bias on Gauquelin's part, accusing him of attempting to persuade them to add or delete names from their study.\n\nGeoffrey Dean has suggested that the effect may be caused by self-reporting of birth dates by parents rather than any issue with the study by Gauquelin. The suggestion is that a small subset of the parents may have had changed birth times to be consistent with better astrological charts for a related profession. The number of births under astrologically undesirable conditions was also lower, indicating that parents choose dates and times to suit their beliefs. The sample group was taken from a time where belief in astrology was more common. Gauquelin had failed to find the Mars effect in more recent populations, where a nurse or doctor recorded the birth information.\n\nDean, a scientist and former astrologer, and psychologist Ivan Kelly conducted a large scale scientific test that involved more than one hundred cognitive, behavioural, physical, and other variables—but found no support for astrology. Furthermore, a meta-analysis pooled 40 studies that involved 700 astrologers and over 1,000 birth charts. Ten of the tests—which involved 300 participants—had the astrologers pick the correct chart interpretation out of a number of others that were not the astrologically correct chart interpretation (usually three to five others). When date and other obvious clues were removed, no significant results suggested there was any preferred chart.\n\nTesting the validity of astrology can be difficult, because there is no consensus amongst astrologers as to what astrology is or what it can predict. Most professional astrologers are paid to predict the future or describe a person's personality and life, but most horoscopes only make vague untestable statements that can apply to almost anyone.\n\nMany astrologers claim that astrology is scientific, while some have proposed conventional causal agents such as electromagnetism and gravity. Scientists reject these mechanisms as implausible since, for example, the magnetic field, when measured from earth, of a large but distant planet such as Jupiter is far smaller than that produced by ordinary household appliances.\n\nWestern astrology has taken the earth's axial precession (also called precession of the equinoxes) into account since Ptolemy's \"Almagest\", so the 'first point of Aries', the start of the astrological year, continually moves against the background of the stars. The tropical zodiac has no connection to the stars, and as long as no claims are made that the constellations themselves are in the associated sign, astrologers avoid the concept that precession seemingly moves the constellations. Charpak and Broch, noting this, referred to astrology based on the tropical zodiac as being \"...empty boxes that have nothing to do with anything and are devoid of any consistency or correspondence with the stars.\" Sole use of the tropical zodiac is inconsistent with references made, by the same astrologers, to the Age of Aquarius, which depends on when the vernal point enters the constellation of Aquarius.\n\nAstrologers usually have only a small knowledge of astronomy, and often do not take into account basic principles—such as the precession of the equinoxes, which changes the position of the sun with time. They commented on the example of Élizabeth Teissier, who claimed that, \"The sun ends up in the same place in the sky on the same date each year,\" as the basis for claims that two people with the same birthday, but a number of years apart, should be under the same planetary influence. Charpak and Broch noted that, \"There is a difference of about twenty-two thousand miles between Earth's location on any specific date in two successive years,\" and that thus they should not be under the same influence according to astrology. Over a 40 years period there would be a difference greater than 780,000 miles.\n\nIn the West, political leaders have sometimes consulted astrologers. For example, the British intelligence agency MI5 employed Louis de Wohl as an astrologer after claims surfaced that Adolf Hitler used astrology to time his actions. The War Office was \"...interested to know what Hitler's own astrologers would be telling him from week to week.\" In fact, de Wohl's predictions were so inaccurate that he was soon labelled a \"complete charlatan,\" and later evidence showed that Hitler considered astrology \"complete nonsense.\" After John Hinckley's attempted assassination of US President Ronald Reagan, first lady Nancy Reagan commissioned astrologer Joan Quigley to act as the secret White House astrologer. However, Quigley's role ended in 1988 when it became public through the memoirs of former chief of staff, Donald Regan.\n\nThere was a boom in interest in astrology in the late 1960s. The sociologist Marcello Truzzi described three levels of involvement of \"Astrology-believers\" to account for its revived popularity in the face of scientific discrediting. He found that most astrology-believers did not claim it was a scientific explanation with predictive power. Instead, those superficially involved, knowing \"next to nothing\" about astrology's 'mechanics', read newspaper astrology columns, and could benefit from \"tension-management of anxieties\" and \"a cognitive belief-system that transcends science.\" Those at the second level usually had their horoscopes cast and sought advice and predictions. They were much younger than those at the first level, and could benefit from knowledge of the language of astrology and the resulting ability to belong to a coherent and exclusive group. Those at the third level were highly involved and usually cast horoscopes for themselves. Astrology provided this small minority of astrology-believers with a \"\"meaningful\" view of their universe and [gave] them an \"understanding\" of their place in it.\" This third group took astrology seriously, possibly as a \"sacred canopy\", whereas the other two groups took it playfully and irreverently.\n\nIn 1953, the sociologist Theodor W. Adorno conducted a study of the astrology column of a Los Angeles newspaper as part of a project examining mass culture in capitalist society. Adorno believed that popular astrology, as a device, invariably leads to statements that encouraged conformity—and that astrologers who go against conformity, by discouraging performance at work etc., risk losing their jobs. Adorno concluded that astrology is a large-scale manifestation of systematic irrationalism, where individuals are subtly led—through flattery and vague generalisations—to believe that the author of the column is addressing them directly. Adorno drew a parallel with the phrase opium of the people, by Karl Marx, by commenting, \"occultism is the metaphysic of the dopes.\"\n\nA 2005 Gallup poll and a 2009 survey by the Pew Research Center reported that 25% of US adults believe in astrology. According to data released in the National Science Foundation's 2014 \"Science and Engineering Indicators\" study, \"Fewer Americans rejected astrology in 2012 than in recent years.\" The NSF study noted that in 2012, \"slightly more than half of Americans said that astrology was 'not at all scientific,' whereas nearly two-thirds gave this response in 2010. The comparable percentage has not been this low since 1983.\"\n\nIn India, there is a long-established and widespread belief in astrology. It is commonly used for daily life, particularly in matters concerning marriage and career, and makes extensive use of electional, horary and karmic astrology. Indian politics have also been influenced by astrology. It is still considered a branch of the Vedanga. In 2001, Indian scientists and politicians debated and critiqued a proposal to use state money to fund research into astrology, resulting in permission for Indian universities to offer courses in Vedic astrology.\n\nOn February 2011, the Bombay High Court reaffirmed astrology's standing in India when it dismissed a case that challenged its status as a science.\n\nIn Japan, strong belief in astrology has led to dramatic changes in the fertility rate and the number of abortions in the years of \"Fire Horse\". Adherents believe that women born in \"hinoeuma\" years are unmarriageable and bring bad luck to their father or husband. In 1966, the number of babies born in Japan dropped by over 25% as parents tried to avoid the stigma of having a daughter born in the hinoeuma year.\n\nThe fourteenth-century English poets John Gower and Geoffrey Chaucer both referred to astrology in their works, including Gower's \"Confessio Amantis\" and Chaucer's \"The Canterbury Tales\". Chaucer commented explicitly on astrology in his \"Treatise on the Astrolabe\", demonstrating personal knowledge of one area, judicial astrology, with an account of how to find the ascendant or rising sign.\n\nIn the fifteenth century, references to astrology, such as with similes, became \"a matter of course\" in English literature.\n\nIn the sixteenth century, John Lyly's 1597 play, \"The Woman in the Moon\", is wholly motivated by astrology, while Christopher Marlowe makes astrological references in his plays \"Doctor Faustus\" and \"Tamburlaine\" (both c. 1590), and Sir Philip Sidney refers to astrology at least four times in his romance \"The Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia\" (c. 1580). Edmund Spenser uses astrology both decoratively and causally in his poetry, revealing \"...unmistakably an abiding interest in the art, an interest shared by a large number of his contemporaries.\" George Chapman's play, \"Byron's Conspiracy\" (1608), similarly uses astrology as a causal mechanism in the drama. William Shakespeare's attitude towards astrology is unclear, with contradictory references in plays including \"King Lear\", \"Antony and Cleopatra\", and \"Richard II\". Shakespeare was familiar with astrology and made use of his knowledge of astrology in nearly every play he wrote, assuming a basic familiarity with the subject in his commercial audience. Outside theatre, the physician and mystic Robert Fludd practised astrology, as did the quack doctor Simon Forman. In Elizabethan England, \"The usual feeling about astrology ... [was] that it is the most useful of the sciences.\"\n\nIn seventeenth century Spain, Lope de Vega, with a detailed knowledge of astronomy, wrote plays that ridicule astrology. In his pastoral romance \"La Arcadia\" (1598), it leads to absurdity; in his novela \"Guzman el Bravo\" (1624), he concludes that the stars were made for man, not man for the stars. Calderón de la Barca wrote the 1641 comedy \"Astrologo Fingido\" (The Pretended Astrologer); the plot was borrowed by the French playwright Thomas Corneille for his 1651 comedy \"Feint Astrologue\".\n\nThe most famous piece of music influenced by astrology is the orchestral suite \"The Planets\". Written by the British composer Gustav Holst (1874–1934), and first performed in 1918, the framework of \"The Planets\" is based upon the astrological symbolism of the planets. Each of the seven movements of the suite is based upon a different planet, though the movements are not in the order of the planets from the Sun. The composer Colin Matthews wrote an eighth movement entitled \"Pluto, the Renewer\", first performed in 2000. In 1937, another British composer, Constant Lambert, wrote a ballet on astrological themes, called \"Horoscope\". In 1974, the New Zealand composer Edwin Carr wrote \"The Twelve Signs: An Astrological Entertainment\" for orchestra without strings. Camille Paglia acknowledges astrology as an influence on her work of literary criticism \"Sexual Personae\" (1990).\n\nAstrology features strongly in Eleanor Catton's \"The Luminaries\", recipient of the 2013 Man Booker Prize.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "18950050", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18950050", "title": "Black box", "text": "Black box\n\nIn science, computing, and engineering, a black box is a device, system or object which can be viewed in terms of its inputs and outputs (or transfer characteristics), without any knowledge of its internal workings. Its implementation is \"opaque\" (black). Almost anything might be referred to as a black box: a transistor, an algorithm, or the human brain.\n\nTo analyse something modeled as an open system, with a typical \"black box approach\", only the behavior of the stimulus/response will be accounted for, to infer the (unknown) \"box\". The usual representation of this \"black box system\" is a data flow diagram centered in the box.\n\nThe opposite of a black box is a system where the inner components or logic are available for inspection, which is most commonly referred to as a white box (sometimes also known as a \"clear box\" or a \"glass box\").\n\nThe modern meaning of the term \"black box\" seems to have entered the English language around 1945. In electronic circuit theory the process of network synthesis from transfer functions, which led to electronic circuits being regarded as \"black boxes\" characterized by their response to signals applied to their ports, can be traced to Wilhelm Cauer who published his ideas in their most developed form in 1941. Although Cauer did not himself use the term, others who followed him certainly did describe the method as black-box analysis. Vitold Belevitch puts the concept of black-boxes even earlier, attributing the explicit use of two-port networks as black boxes to Franz Breisig in 1921 and argues that 2-terminal components were implicitly treated as black-boxes before that.\n\nIn cybernetics, a full treatment was given by Ross Ashby in 1956. A black box was described by Norbert Wiener in 1961 as an unknown system that was to be identified using the techniques of system identification. He saw the first step in self-organization as being to be able to copy the output behavior of a black box. Many other engineers, scientists and epistemologists, as Mario Bunge, used and perfected the black box theory in the 1960s.\n\nThe \"black box\" is an abstraction representing a class of concrete open system which can be viewed solely in terms of its \"stimuli inputs\" and \"output reactions\":\nThe understanding of a \"black box\" is based on the \"explanatory principle\", the hypothesis of a causal relation between the \"input\" and the \"output\", and:\n\nAn observer makes observations over time. All observations of inputs and outputs of a \"black box\" can be written in a table with the form:\nin which, at each of a sequence of times, the states of the \"box’s\" various parts, input and output, are recorded. Thus, using an example from Ashby, examining a box that has fallen from a flying saucer might lead to this protocol:\n\nThus every system, fundamentally, is investigated by the collection of a long protocol, drawn out in time, showing the sequence of input and output states. From this there follows the fundamental deduction that all knowledge obtainable from a Black Box (of given input and output) is such as can be obtained by re-coding the protocol (the \"observation table\"); all that, and nothing more.\n\nIf the observer also controls input, the investigation turns into an experiment (illustration), and hypotheses about cause and effect can be tested directly.\n\nWhen the experimenter is also motivated to control the box, there is an active feedback in the box/observer relation, promoting what in control theory is called a feed forward architecture.\n\nThe \"modeling process\" is the construction of a predictive mathematical model, using existing historic data (observation table).\n\nA developed \"black box model\" is a validated model when \"black-box testing\" methods ensures that it is, based solely on observable elements.\n\nWith backtesting, inputs for past events (not used in the \"modeling effort\") are entered into the model to see how well the output matches the known results.\n\n\"Black box theories\" are things defined only in terms of their function. The term \"black box theory\" is applied to any field, philosophy and science or otherwise where some inquiry or definition is made into the relations between the appearance of something (exterior/outside), i.e. here specifically the thing's black box state, related to its characteristics and behaviour within (interior/inner).\n\nSpecifically, the inquiry is focused upon a thing that has no immediately apparent characteristics and therefore has only factors for consideration held within itself hidden from immediate observation. The observer is assumed ignorant in the first instance as the majority of available data is held in an inner situation away from facile investigations. The \"black box\" element of the definition is shown as being characterised by a system where observable elements enter a perhaps imaginary box with a set of different outputs emerging which are also observable.\n\nIn humanities disciplines such as philosophy of mind and behaviorism, one of the uses of black box theory is to describe and understand psychological factors in fields such as marketing when applied to an analysis of consumer behaviour.\n\nThe \"black box theory of consciousness\" states that the mind is fully understood once the inputs and outputs are well-defined.\n\n\n\"Black Box theory\" is, however, even wider in application than these professional studies:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "245992", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=245992", "title": "Charity (virtue)", "text": "Charity (virtue)\n\nIn Christian theology, Charity (Latin Caritas) is considered as one of the seven virtues and is understood by Thomas Aquinas as \"the friendship of man for God\", which \"unites us to God\". He holds it as \"the most excellent of the virtues\". Further, Aquinas holds that \"the habit of charity extends not only to the love of God, but also to the love of our neighbor\".\n\nThe Catechism of the Catholic Church defines \"charity\" as \"the theological virtue by which we love God above all things for His own sake, and our neighbor as ourselves for the love of God\".\n\nThe phrase \"Deus caritas est\" from —or \"Θεὸς ἀγάπη ἐστίν\" (Theos agapē estin) in the original Greek is translated in the King James Version as: \"God is love\", and in the Douay-Rheims bible as: \"God is charity\" (). Thomas Aquinas does not simply equate charity with \"love\", which he holds as a passion, not a virtue. The King James Version uses both the words \"charity\" and \"love\" to translate the idea of \"caritas\"/ἀγάπη (agapē): sometimes it uses one, then sometimes the other, for the same concept. Most other English translations, both before and since, do not; instead, throughout they use the same more direct English word \"love\". Love can have other meanings in English, but as used in the New Testament it almost always refers to the virtue of \"caritas\".\n\nMany times when charity is mentioned in English-language bibles, it refers to \"love of God\", which is a spiritual love that is extended from God to man and then reflected by man, who is made in the image of God, back to God. God gives man the power to act as God acts (God is love), man then reflects God's power in his own human actions towards others. One example of this movement is \"charity shall cover the multitude of sins\" (). \"The practice of charity brings us to act toward ourselves and others out of love alone, precisely because each person has the dignity of a beloved child of God.\"\n\nCharity is held to be the ultimate perfection of the human spirit, because it is said to both glorify and reflect the nature of God. Confusion can arise from the multiple meanings of the English word \"love\". As other theological virtues, Charity is divinely infused into the soul; it resides in the \"will\". According to Aquinas, charity is an absolute requirement for happiness, which he holds as man's last goal.\n\nCharity has two parts: love of God and love of man, which includes both love of one's neighbor and one's self.\n\nIn 1 Corinthians 13, Paul places the greater emphasis on Charity (Love). \"So faith, hope, love remain, these three; but the greatest of these is love.\" He describes it as:\n\nThe fruits of charity are joy, peace, and mercy.\n\nIn December 2005, Pope Benedict XVI issued the encyclical \"Deus caritas est\", in which he discussed \"... the love which God lavishes upon us and which we in turn must share with others.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "23298857", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23298857", "title": "Chemoton", "text": "Chemoton\n\nThe chemoton is an abstract model for the fundamental unit of life introduced by Hungarian theoretical biologist Tibor Gánti. It is the oldest known computational abstract of protocell. Gánti conceived the basic idea in 1952 and formulated the concept in 1971 in his book \"The Principles of Life\" (originally written in Hungarian, and translated to English only in 2003). He surmised the chemoton as the original ancestor of all organisms, or the last universal common ancestor.\n\nThe basic assumption of the model is that life should fundamentally and essentially have three properties: metabolism, self-replication, and a bilipid membrane. The metabolic and replication functions together form an autocatalytic subsystem necessary for the basic functions of life, and a membrane encloses this subsystem to separate it from the surrounding environment. Therefore, any system having such properties may be regarded as alive, and it will be subjected to natural selection and contain a self-sustaining cellular information. Some consider this model a significant contribution to origin of life as it provides a philosophy of evolutionary units.\n\nChemoton is a protocell that grows by metabolism, reproduce by biological fission, and has at least rudimentary genetic variation. Thus, it contains three subsystems, namely autocatalytic network for metabolism, a lipid bilayer for structural organisation, and a replicating machinery for information. Unlike cellular metabolic reactions, metabolism of chemoton in autonomous chemical cycle and is not dependent on enzymes. Autocatalysis produces its own structures and functions. Hence, the process itself has no hereditary variation. The model reaction however asserts that another molecule (\"T\" in the diagram) is spontaneously produced that is incorporated into the structure. This molecule is amphipathic like membrane lipids, but it is highly dynamic, leaving small gaps that close and open frequently. This unstable structure is important for new amphipathic molecules to be added, so that a membrane is subsequently formed. This will become a microsphere. Due to metabolic reaction, osmotic pressure will build up inside the microsphere, and this will generate a force for invaginating the membrane, and ultimately division. In fact, this is close to the cell division of cell wall-less bacteria, such as \"Mycoplasma\". Continuous reactions will also invariably produce variable polymers that can be inherited by daughter cells. In advanced version of the chemoton, the hereditary information will act as a genetic material, something like a ribozyme of the RNA World.\n\nThe primary use of the chemoton model is in the study of the chemical origin of life. Because chemoton itself can be, though in theory, as a primitive or minimal cellular life as it satisfies the definition of what a cell is (that it is a unit of biological activity enclosed by a membrane and capable of self-reproduction). Experimental demonstration showed that a synthesised chemotron can survive in a wide range of chemical solutions, it formed materials for its internal components, it metabolised its chemicals, and it grew in size and multiplied itself.\n\nAs it is scientifically hypothesised that the first replicating systems must be simple structure, most likely before any enzymes or templates existed, chemoton provides a plausible scenario. As an autocatalytic but non-genetic entity, it predates the enzyme-dependent precursors of life, such as RNA World. But being capable of self-replication and producing variant metabolites, it possibly could be an entity with the first biological evolution, therefore, the origin of the unit of Darwinian selection.\n\nChemoton has laid down the foundation of some aspects of artificial life. The computational basis has become a topic of software development and experimentation in the investigation of artificial life. The main reason is that chemoton simplifies the otherwise complex biochemical and molecular functions of living cells. Since the chemoton is a system consisting of a large but fixed number of interacting molecular species, it can effectively be implemented in a process algebra-based language such as the BlenX programming language.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "58920096", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58920096", "title": "Colloquial Welsh prepositions", "text": "Colloquial Welsh prepositions\n\nColloquial Welsh prepositions deals with the prepositions (Welsh: ) of the colloquial Welsh language, the spoken register of the modern Welsh language as spoken in Wales by first-language speakers. This page does not deal with the literary standard forms of the prepositions nor any dialect which may have arisen outside of Wales. Welsh has two standardised forms: \"Literary Welsh\" – a conservative language reserved for literary purposes which retains some features of older Welsh; and \"Colloquial Welsh\" – the Welsh one will hear being spoken in Welsh speaking areas. For the most part the two languages share prepositions, though for some of them their usages can differ; there are also some which have lost their inflected forms in the colloquial language but is preserved in the literary standard. Colloquial Welsh also shows some variation in initial-consonant mutations, which is explained below, while the literary form retains the \"proper\" mutations in all cases. Welsh prepositions do (for the most part) perform the same rolls as English prepositions but there is variation and these must be learnt as they are encountered. For instance it is often taught that Welsh \"am\" \"means 'for'\" and \"i\" \"means 'to'\"; this is not incorrect but \"am\" can also mean 'about' or 'at' and \"i\" can mean 'for'. The usages given below outline how each preposition is used in modern colloquial Welsh.\n\nPrepositions are words like \"on, at, to, from, by\" and \"for\" in English. They often describe a relationship, spatial or temporal, between persons and objects. For example, 'the book is \"on\" the table'; 'the table is \"by\" the window'.\n\nWelsh prepositions come in two categories: \"simple prepositions ()\" and \"compound prepositions ()\"; the former are single words, like English \"on, at, from, to\" etc. while the latter consist of a simple preposition + some other element (often a noun) like English \"in front of\" or \"in addition to\". Compound prepositions are less frequent than simple prepositions and are discussed below.\n\nThere are approximately two-dozen or so simple prepositions in modern colloquial Welsh. While some have clear-cut and obvious translations (\"heb\" ‘without’), others correspond to different English prepositions depending on context (\"i, wrth, am\"). As with all areas of modern Welsh, some words are preferred in the North and others in the South.\n\nThe main prepositions used in modern colloquial Welsh are (alternative forms in parentheses):\n\n\nMost of these (but not all) share the following characteristics:\n\nThe majority of Welsh prepositions cause mutation to the following word – the most common, by far, is the soft mutation. Examples:\n\nSeveral do not cause any mutation (most notably \"rhag, rhwng\" and \"mewn\"), while \"â, gyda\" and \"tua\" should cause aspirate mutation but in reality they are usually left unmutated (except for set expressions), since the aspirate mutation is dying out and for many speakers only mutation of \"c-\" /k/ is normal while mutation of \"p-\" /p/ and \"t-\" /t/ is not. \"Yn\" ‘in’ alone causes the nasal mutation which also is not as widespread as suggested by the literary standard and is often replaced by the soft mutation. It should also be noted that personal names are not mutated after prepositions but names of places and other nouns are: \"i ferch\" ‘to a girl’, \"o Fangor\" ‘from Bangor’, but \"i Dafydd\" ‘to Dafydd’, not \"*i Ddafydd\" (although mutation of personal names can be found in older texts).\n\nWhen used with a personal pronoun, most prepositions insert a linking syllable before the pronoun. This syllable changes for each preposition and results in an inflection pattern similar to that found in Welsh verbs. Broadly speaking, the endings for inflected prepositions () are as follows:\n\nThere is some dialect variation between these endings, particularly with 1st and 2nd pers. sing., which can often end in \"-o i\" and \"-ot ti\" and 2nd pers. pl. \"-och chi\" is often heard as \"-ach chi\". 3rd pers. sing. and 3rd pers. pl. endings are always as shown but almost always omit the pronoun element, leaving the inflectional ending by itself to indicate person:\n\n\nBut note that the 3rd pers. pl. \"-yn nhw\" is never shortened in this manner.\n\nThese differ from the literary standard where the 1st pers. sing. is \"-af i\"; the 1st pers. pl. is \"-om ni\"; the 3rd pers. sing. masc. is \"-o ef\" and the 3rd. pers. pl. is \"-ynt hwy\". The literary standard also has the alternative 2nd pers. pl. pronoun \"chwi\". Most of these are never encountered in the colloquial language and therefore will not be presented in the inflected forms in this article.\n\nThe linking element between the preposition and the ending is more complicated, however. Different prepositions use a different linking element. For example, \"am\" inserts \"-dan-\" before its endings (\"amdana i, amdanat ti, amdani hi\" etc.), while \"heb\" uses \"-dd-\" (\"hebdda i, hebddo fo, hebddyn nhw\" etc.) \"Rhwng\" changes its vowel (from \"w\" to \"y\") as well as inserting \"-dd-\" (\"rhyngddyn nhw\") while some, like \"at\" and \"wrth\" add the endings with no linking element (\"ato fe, atoch chi, wrthyn nhw, wrthon ni\" etc.) and some, like \"gyda\" and \"efo\" do not inflect at all.\n\n\"Â\" (\"ag\" before vowels) causes aspirate mutation. It means ‘with’, but note that there are other equivalents to ‘with’ in Welsh (\"efo, gan\" and \"gyda\") Use of \"â/ag\" is fairly restricted:\n\n\n\"Am\" is a very common preposition in spoken Welsh with a range of English equivalents:\n\nUsing \"am\" to mean 'about' with verbs have been discussed above. With most other verbs \"am\" usually means 'for':\n\n\"Am\" also has other meanings in the literary language which are not a feature of the spoken form, such as 'towards'.\n\nInflected forms of \"am\"\n\nThe table below gives the inflected forms of \"am\" with their accompanying pronouns:\n\n\"Ar\" has a number of English equivalents, but usually equates to 'on'.\n\n\nInflected forms of \"ar\"\n\nThe table below gives the inflected forms of \"ar\" with their accompanying pronouns:\n\nWhile Welsh \"at\" often corresponds to English 'at', the field of scope of Welsh \"at\" is far wider.\n\n\nSome verbs which use \"at\" include:\n\n\nInflected forms of \"at\"\n\nThe table below gives the inflected forms of \"at\" with their accompanying pronouns:\n\n\"Cyn\" means 'before' in expressions of time, never in spatial expressions, e.g. \"cyn y Rhyfel\" 'before the War' or \"cyn deg o'r gloch\" 'before 10 o'clock'. It is also used as a conjunction. \"Cyn\" does not cause a mutation, nor does it have inflected forms. Examples of \"cyn\":\n\n\nIt is important for anyone learning Welsh to understand that the compound preposition \"o flaen\" 'in front of' cannot be used instead of \"cyn\". The two are not interchangeable despite their interchangeability in English in sentences like 'to stand before/in front of the building':\n\n\nAs an adjectival prefix, \"cyn-\" always means 'ex-' or 'former'.\n\n\"Dan\" (sometimes heard as \"o dan\") causes soft mutation and means 'under': \"dan y dŵr\" 'under the water', \"dan ddylanwad ei reini\" 'under the influence of his parents'. It should be noted that the related compound preposition \"oddidan\" (also \"odditan\") means 'from under'.\n\nThe term \"dan ofal\" 'under care', abbreviated to \"d/o\" is the norm for 'care of' when addressing letters.\n\nThe two most important idioms using \"dan\" are:\n\nThe unmutated form, \"tan\" is now, to all intents and purposes, obsolete in this meaning and has become a separate preposition in its own right and means 'until'.\n\nInflected forms of \"dan\"\n\nThe table below gives the inflected forms of \"dan\" with their accompanying pronouns:\n\n\"Dros\" has two variants: \"tros\" (regarded as particularly literary nowadays) and \"drost\" (still very common in speech all over Wales). \"Dros\" causes soft mutation and means:\n\n\nIdioms using \"dros\" tend to be adverbial. Two very common and useful set phrases using \"dros\" are:\n\nInflected forms of \"dros\"\n\nThe table below gives the inflected forms of \"dros\" with their accompanying pronouns:\n\n\"Efo\" (also \"hefo\" in some areas of North Wales) does not cause mutation and is a general word meaning 'with' and is restricted to Northern dialects of the spoken language. In the South \"gyda\" is always used instead. The only appearance of \"gyda\" in the North is in set phrases like \"gyda'r nos\" 'in the evening'. \"Efo\" and \"gyda\" are not, however, always interchangeable as \"gyda\" (or its contracted form \"'da\") is used in the South to express possession; in the North this is not achieved by \"efo\" but by \"gan\". The following examples are all Northern dialect where \"(h)efo\" can be substituted for \"gyda\" in the South:\n\n\"Efo\" does not have inflected forms.\n\n\"Gan\" (often heard as \"gyn\") causes soft mutation. It is another Northern dialect word used to express possession and is replaced by \"gyda\" in the South. \"Mae gan Mrs Williams gath fawr\" 'Mrs Williams has a large cat'. Although \"gan\" and \"gyda\" are interchangeable in this context, the structure of the sentences differs and it is not as simple as substituting one word for the other. The following example sentence is translated using \"gan\" (Northern) and \"gyda\" (Southern) and means 'do you have enough money?':\n\nThere are, however, other uses for \"gan\" not involving possession and are therefore common in both the North and the South:\n\n\nSome common idioms using \"gan\":\n\nInflected forms of \"gan\"\n\nThe table below gives the inflected forms of \"gan\" with their accompanying pronouns:\n\n\"Ger\" does not cause a mutation and is used with geographical locations (usually town and city names) to mean 'in the vicinity of':\n\nIt should be noted that \"ger\" is related to the term \"gerbron\" which means 'before' in the sense of 'in the presence of' or 'for the attention of' and is used with nouns like \"llys\" 'court' or \"bwrdd\" 'board':\n\n\"Ger\" has no inflected forms.\n\n\"Gyda\" (\"gydag\" before vowels) causes aspirate mutation and is the general term for 'with' in the South (c.f. \"efo\" in the North). With the exception of idioms, it is usually heard as \"'da\" in speech: \"Oes amser 'da chi i brynu'r tocynnau?\" 'Have you got time to buy the tickets?'\n\n\"Gyda/gydag\" is used in the South to show possession, as \"gan\" is used in the North, but their forms differ, compare the following sentence 'do you have enough food?':\n\n\"Gyda/gydag\" does not have inflected forms, so \"gyda fi, gyda ti, gyda nhw\" but note that 'with him' can be either \"(gy)da fe\" or \"(gy)dag e\".\n\n\"Heb\" causes soft mutation and in its primary meaning, \"heb\" means 'without': \"heb arian\" 'without money', \"peidiwch mynd hebdda i!\" 'don't go without me!'. \n\n\"Heb\" can be used with a verbal-noun to make a negative construction in the perfect tense – equivalent to \"ddim wedi\": \"Dan ni heb benderfynu\" 'We haven't decided' (=\"Dan ni ddim wedi penderfynu\"); \"Mae o heb fynd eto\" 'He hasn't gone yet' (=\"Dydy o ddim wedi mynd eto\").\n\n\"Heb\" + possessive adjective + verbal-noun corresponds to 'which/who has/have not been' or an adjectival 'un...ed': \"pobol heb eu cofrestru\" 'people who have not been registered' [lit. 'people without their registering']; \"pryd o fwyd heb ei fwyta\" 'an uneaten meal' [lit. 'a meal of food without its eating'].\n\nSome idioms using \"heb\":\n\nInflected forms of \"heb\"\n\nThe table below gives the inflected forms of \"heb\" with their accompanying pronouns:\n\n\"Hyd\" causes soft mutation and has the following meanings:\n\n\nPronouns are not normally used with this preposition.\n\nThe following are all commonly used idioms using \"hyd\", though it is not strictly a preposition in all cases:\n\n\"Hyd\" does not have inflected forms.\n\n\"I\" causes soft mutation and often, but by no means always, corresponds to English 'to'. It is possibly the most frequently used preposition in the spoken Welsh language.\n\n\"I\" corresponds to English 'to' in the following senses:\n\nOther common uses for \"i\" which do not correspond to 'to':\n\n\nWhen 'i' follows a verb its meaning usually parallels English but it should be noted that the English preposition can often be omitted. It should also be noted that \"gofyn\" 'ask' must also take \"i\" which may be unexpected by English speakers.\n\nThe idiom \"rhoi gwybod i\" means 'inform' or 'let... know':\n\nThe idiom \"yn dal i\" is used to mean 'still ...ing':\n\nEven though \"i\" can cover 'into' (\"i'r tŷ\" '(in)to the house'; \"i Gymru\" '(in)to Wales' etc.) the expanded form \"i mewn i\" (and rarely \"i fewn i\") can be used where this is the central idea or where it is emphasised:\n\nInflected forms of \"i\"\n\nThe table below gives the inflected forms of \"i\" with their accompanying pronouns:\n\nNotes:\n\n\"Mewn\" does not cause mutation and should not be confused with \"i mewn\". It means 'in' but is only used where the following noun is non-specific. Specific nouns require the use of \"yn\". Compare:\n\n\"Mewn\" does not have inflected forms.\n\n\"O\" causes soft mutation. It equates to English 'from' and 'of', but care must be taken – \"o\" cannot be used for genitive constructions (those showing possession) for which Welsh has a specific method of constructing. \"O\" has the following meanings:\n\n\nInflected forms of \"o\"\n\nThe table below gives the inflected forms of \"o\" with their accompanying pronouns:\n\nNotes:\n\n\"Oddiar\" (also seen as \"oddi ar\") causes soft mutation and is a compound of \"o\" + \"ar\" (with \"o\" in its 3rd pers. sing. fem. form). \"Oddiar\" also takes the same inflections as \"ar\", e.g. \"oddiarno fo\". It is basically the opposite of \"ar\" and describes motion in the opposite direction of \"ar\". It therefore means 'off' in the sense of 'from upon': \"Cymer dy bethau oddiar y bwrdd, nei di?\" 'Take your things off the table, will you?'. \"Oddiar\" is not used to translate adverbial use of English 'off' ('turn off the TV', 'buzz off'), for which Welsh uses \"i ffwrdd\" (North) and \"bant\" (South).\n\nInflected forms of \"oddiar\"\n\nThe table below gives the inflected forms of \"oddiar\" with their accompanying pronouns:\n\n\"Oddiwrth\" (also \"oddi wrth\") causes soft mutation and is a compound of \"o\" + \"wrth\" (with \"o\" in its 3rd pers. sing. fem. form). \"Oddiwrth\" inflects in the same way as \"wrth\", so \"oddiwrthi hi\" etc. It means 'from' but is restricted to sentiments sent from one person to another – the opposite of \"at\": \"Gaethon ni ddim cerdyn oddiwrth dy reini eleni, naddo?\" 'We didn't get a card from your parents this year, did we?; or \"Penblwydd Hapus oddiwrth bawb yn y swyddfa\" 'Happy Birthday from everyone at the office'.\n\nWhere a verb of receiving (like \"cael\") is used – as in the first example above, \"gan\" is a possible alternative to \"oddiwrth\".\n\nInflected forms of \"oddiwrth\"\n\nThe table below gives the inflected forms of \"oddiwrth\" with their accompanying pronouns:\n\n\"Rhag\" is a lesser used preposition in colloquial Welsh and its usage is very restricted. \"Rhag\" causes no mutations and has the following meanings:\n\n\nAs a prefix, \"rhag-\" usually equates to English 'pre-' or 'fore-': \"rhagfarn\" 'prejudice', \"rhagweld\" 'foresee'.\n\nInflected forms of \"rhag\"\n\nThe table below gives the inflected forms of \"rhag\" with their accompanying pronouns:\n\nNote that these inflected forms are often pronounced as \"rhactha i, rhacthat ti, rhacthi hi\" etc.\n\n\"Rhwng\", which causes no mutation, means 'between' and its usage is more-or-less the same as its English equivalent. Examples:\n\nInflected forms of \"rhwng\" (which has the stem \"rhyng-\") are used to make idiomatic expressions like \"Rhyngddat ti a fi...\" and \"Rhyngddoch chi a fi...\" 'Between you and me...'.\n\nInflected forms of \"rhwng\"\n\nThe table below gives the inflected forms of \"rhwng\" with their accompanying pronouns:\n\nNote that these are often heard as \"rhyngtha i, rhyngthat ti\" etc. Also, variants using the stems \"rhwngdd-, rhynth-\" and \"rhyng-\" are in use.\n\n\"Tan\", which causes soft mutation, means 'until, till' and is found with time expressions:\n\n\"Tan\" can also be used when taking leave of someone: \"Tan yfory 'te!\" 'Till tomorrow, then!', \"Tan hynny!\" 'Till then!', \"Tan y tro nesa!\" 'Till the next time!', \"Tan Ddydd Llun!\" 'Till Monday!' etc.\n\nWhere English 'until' is used as a conjunction, that is when it is followed by a whole phrase with a verb in it, then \"nes\" is the preferred translation:\n\nHowever, \"tan\" can be heard to be used as a conjunction in some areas, so it is possible to hear (and therefore say) \"Na i aros tan iddo ffonio\"; but there are also speakers who would consider this to be substandard or \"bad Welsh\".\n\n\"Tan\" has no inflected forms.\n\n\"Trwy\" (also \"trw\" and \"drwy\"), which causes soft mutation, means 'through' in the spatial sense, e.g. \"cyllell boeth trwy fenyn\" 'a hot knife through butter', \"edrych trwy'r twll\" 'look through the hole'. \"Trwy\" also has other uses:\nInflected forms of \"trwy\"\n\nThe table below gives the inflected forms of \"trwy\" with their accompanying pronouns:\n\n\"Tua\" (\"tuag\" before vowels) causes the aspirate mutation and means 'towards' in a spatial sense, but this meaning has been taken over by \"tuag at\" in the modern language, except for set expressions like \"tuag adre\" 'home(wards)'. Its primary use in the modern colloquial language is for conveying approximation. For example, 'about' with both time and quantity expressions: \"tua naw o'r gloch\" '(at) about nine o'clock', \"tua pum pwys o datws\" 'about five pounds of potatoes'. With expressions of time \"tua/tuag\" can be replaced with the compound preposition \"o gwmpas\": \"o gwmpas naw o'r gloch\". Some examples of the use of \"tua/tuag\":\n\n\"Tua/tuag\" has no inflected forms.\n\n\"Wrth\" causes soft mutation and is almost always heard as \"wth\" in normal speech has a number of uses:\n\nInflected forms of \"wrth\"\n\nThe table below gives the inflected forms of \"wrth\" with their accompanying pronouns:\n\nThese inflected forms are routinely shortened to \"'tha i, 'that ti\" etc. in speech in all parts of Wales, especially after forms of \"dweud/deud\":\n\nSome idiomatic uses of \"wrth\":\n\n\"Yn\" causes nasal mutation (though soft mutation is often heard instead) and means 'in'. \"Yn\" 'in' is a true preposition and must not be confused with the complement marker particle \"yn\" seen after the verb \"bod\". It is only used when a definite (specific) noun follows (c.f. \"mewn\"). \"Yn\" is therefore often seen preceding the definite article or the names of places: \"yn y car\" 'in the car' or \"yn Llandudno\" 'in Llandudno'. Compare the difference between the use of \"yn\" and \"mewn\": \"yn yr ardd\" 'in the garden' (specific), but \"mewn gardd\" 'in a garden' (non-specific).\n\nMutations after \"yn\"\n\n\"Yn\" causes the nasal mutation, but it undergoes a change itself depending on what follows. Therefore \"yn\" often appears as \"ym\" and \"yng\", though \"ym\" only appears before a word beginning with 'm-' or 'mh-' and \"yng\" only appears before words beginning with 'ng-' or 'ngh-' whether this is the result of mutation or not:\n\nThe examples above are all place-names, but the rule holds true for all words following \"yn\". For example, \"yng nghanol y dre\" 'in the middle of the town'. It should be noted, however, that mutation of place names not of Welsh origin (often English) is often avoided, but not always. The following are all possible in colloquial Welsh for 'in Camden' (an area of London):\n\nIt should also be noted that 'in Welsh' is always \"yn Gymraeg\", even in the literary language and is never \"*yng Nghymraeg\"; it is sometimes heard as \"yn y Gymraeg\", it is because of this definite article being omitted that \"yn Gymraeg\" is used and not \"*yng Nghymraeg\".\n\nInflected forms of \"yn\"\n\nThe table below gives the inflected forms of \"yn\" with their accompanying pronouns:\n\nNote that variants with \"-d-\" are often heard instead of \"-dd-\": \"ynda i, yndo fe\" etc., as are variants with no linking element: \"yna i, yno fe\" etc.\n"}

{"id": "36255009", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36255009", "title": "Cupid plc", "text": "Cupid plc\n\nCupid plc was the owner and operator of multiple high-volume online dating websites, covering the range from mainstream to niche audiences. The full network of websites is available worldwide in a variety of languages, and by the end of the first half of 2012 more than 54 million users had created profiles in the company's websites. As is customary among all internet dating companies, all of their products are available across multiple devices (web, mobile, Android, iOS) and platforms (on web browsers, within Facebook).\n\nFounded in 2005 by Bill Dobbie and Max Polyakov, the company was originally made up of a range of dating websites operated from and off-shore base. In 2006, Polyakov and Dobbie acquired the EasyDate business and brand to complement and serve as an umbrella for their network of sites, which had been experiencing a steady growth in user base. The company quickly grew its user base – by 2007 they had their first million paying users, and a few years after that they hit an impressive 13 million paying users across all networks.\n\nBy early March 2010, the user base was growing at a rate of 300,000 per month, and new products were succeeding in increasing these numbers and expanding the user base. A year later, in May 2011, the company boasted 23 million members in 39 countries. The company was named as Scotland's fastest growing technology firm by Deloitte in its October 2011 Fast 500 listing, and in May 2012, went on to be awarded the UK Stock Market Awards 2012 award for Best Travel & Leisure PLC.\n\nThis success, and the desire to fund further growth, prompted the company to become listed in the Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange (AIM). Upon admission, the company had an approximate market capitalisation of £45 million. The fresh capital brought about by the listing enabled the company to perform some strategic acquisitions in markets where it had detected potential, like France, Germany, the US, and Brazil. On 24 July 2012, Cupid plc announced that it had acquired the French dating site Assistance Genie Logiciel (AGL) for the sum of €3.7 million. The deal to buy the 1986-founded company includes French dating sites amour.com, serencontrer.com and ulla.com. Also in 2012 Cupid acquired Uniform Dating, a niche website aimed at uniformed services personnel such as firefighters, nurses, armed forces and police.\n\nIn February 2013, the company was the subject of BBC Radio 5live Investigates programme. Users told the BBC that they had received many messages from potential dates as free users of the site but that, when they paid for membership to be able to reply, the volume of messages dramatically decreased. The company denied that it was sending the messages to entice users to pay for membership and has commissioned an independent audit into its operation. After a subsequent investigation into these claims, one of the sources of the accusations made a public apology regarding factual inaccuracies in his blog postings on the subject.\n\nInvestigation by Ukrainian newspaper Kyivpost in March 2013 proved usage of fake profiles by the company and confirmed that the company's 'social media managers', whose job was to tempt users, were actually located in Ukraine. It was revealed that only about 20 employers of Cupid plc actually worked in the United Kingdom, and around 1500 staff members were located in Ukraine.\n\nThe company stated that its auditors KPMG had found 'no evidence of a company organised practice of staff enticing registered members to subscribe through the use of fake profiles'. Nevertheless, Cupid recognized that existing staff profiles 'were not clearly identifiable' to users and said it had replaced the motivation teams with dating advisors. In July 2013, BBC published new investigation, claiming that problem of fake profiles still existed, and the company used real persons' data without their knowledge.\n\nSuch kind of semi-legal activities is a subject to legal prosecution in some countries. Björn and Benjamin Bak, founders of German dating application Lovoo, and twelve members of their staff were arrested and accused of commercial deception because of using similar scheme. Avid Life Media, founder of dating site AshleyMadison.com, was accused of using 'fembots' on a large scale. British-based JDI Dating Ltd was fined by US Federal Trade Commission for using fake profiles.\n\nCupid's business can be split into two main areas: mainstream dating websites, aimed at the general public with some level of differentiation between them (for example, Cupid.com is aimed at people looking for a steady partner in a more long-term relationship, whereas BeNaughty.com is geared towards users looking for more casual dating); and niche websites, where the whole concept fundamentally hinges on the users looking for partners of a similar background and tastes.\n\nThe business model varies slightly depending on the website. In most cases, users can join for free – this gives them access to the website and allows them to browse the profiles of other users. Once they are ready to begin interacting with someone, the website charges depending on the level of access the user wants. This is a fairly common practice across the industry. Cupid makes most of their business through the charging of these fees, as there is no advertising on their websites.\n\nIn addition to this, Cupid also partners with other companies in order to provide a branded, specifically targeted online dating experience.\n\nCupid plc disposed of its casual dating sites in July 2013. It sold the remaining mainstream dating sites to NSI Holdings Ltd. in December 2014 and is no longer involved in online dating.\n\nThe company had been trading as EasyDate since 2006, when it acquired the name. Because of this, it was under that name that it became initially listed in the markets (as EasyDate plc). However, in December 2010, as a result of pressure from easyGroup founder Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, the company changed its name. The name Cupid plc was chosen as it had been acquired in September of that year, along with all associated domains for £4.4 million.\n\nThe investigations by BBC and Kyivpost caused a sharp decline in the share prices. In Summer 2013, the company sold part of its 'casual dating business' to Grendall Investment Limited, controlled by co-founder and shareholder of Cupid plc Max Polyakov.\n\nIn 2014, Cupid plc suffered heavy losses and was forced to call in part of money owed by Grendall. The company preferred to take a reduced £12,5 million instead of around £20 million to get it a year earlier. Late Cupid plc announced that it sold final dating businesses for just £3 million. It is believed that assets were bought by the companies connected to Max Polyakov. Cupid pls was renamed Castle Street Investment and realigned as an investment company.\n\n\n"}

He is professor of philosophy at the William Paterson University of New Jersey and an Affiliate of the Rutgers University Center for Cognitive Science (RuCCS). Kolak is the founder of the philosophical therapy known as cognitive dynamics.\n\nKolak is a prolific philosopher, with over thirty-five authored books and nearly two hundred books edited. He is professor of philosophy at the William Paterson University of New Jersey (WPUNJ), where he chaired the Philosophy Department and founded and directed the WPUNJ cognitive science laboratory. He also directs research at the Brain Behavior Center and is an affiliate of Rutgers University's Center for Cognitive Science (RuCCS). Kolak's numerous articles, stories, essays, books and other creative works bridge traditional philosophy with all areas of inquiry and expression, from neuroscience to quantum mechanics, from logic and mathematics to art, music and literature. Among his best known recent works are \"I Am You: The Metaphysical Foundations for Global Ethics\", \"Principles of Cognitive Science\", \"Wittgenstein's Tractatus\", \"Wisdom Without Answers\", \"From the Presocratics to the Present\", \"In Search of God: The Language and Logic of Belief\", \"The Experience of Philosophy\", \"Self, Cosmos, God\", \"Self and Identity\", and the novel \"In Search of Myself: Life, Death and Personal Identity\". He is editor, chief programmer and designer of the interactive electronic library \"The Philosophy Source\" on CD-ROM, and was Series Editor of the Wadsworth Philosopher Series and Philosophical Topics. As Series Editor at Longman, he is currently bringing out new editions of the complete canon of philosophy from ancient times to the present. Translated into over a dozen languages, collectively his books have sold over a million copies worldwide.\n\nKolak is the originator of the philosophy known as Open Individualism, which he developed along with his view of metaphysical subjectivism and the nonlocality of consciousness, according to which there exists but one numerically identical individual subject who is everyone. In his groundbreaking \"I Am You: the Metaphysical Foundations for Global Ethics\", he writes: \"The central thesis of \"I Am You\" - that we are all the same person - is apt to strike many readers as obviously false or even absurd. How could you be me and Hitler and Gandhi and Jesus and Buddha and Greta Garbo and everybody else in the past, present and future? In this book I explain how this is possible. Moreover, I show that this is the best explanation of who we are for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is that it provides the metaphysical foundations for global ethics.\" Variations on Kolak's theme have been voiced periodically throughout the ages (the Upanishads, Averroes, Giordano Bruno, Schopenhauer, Josiah Royce); more recently, physicists such as Erwin Schrödinger, Fred Hoyle, and Freeman Dyson have espoused it.\n\nKolak continues to work on the logical foundations of quantum mechanics and a mathematical model of consciousness (e.g. Stone-Čech compactification) that integrates relativity and quantum mechanics using an \"Ultra-Strong (Open World) Nonlocality\" variation on a (spinning, with closed timelike paths) Gödel universe, and other such foundational issues in mathematics, physics and logic further refined with Jaakko Hintikka's IF (Independence-Friendly) and epistemic logics. He has also made original contributions to the philosophy of religion, the history of philosophy, and the teaching of philosophy.\n\nKolak is the founder of the philosophical therapy known as cognitive dynamics, which has been used to create new paradigms and technologies for expanding human consciousness, increasing intelligence, and improving creativity. It is still under development. More information about this aspect of Kolak's research in cognitive science (cognitive neuroscience; self-representation; information processing; knowledge representation; mental models; the logic and mathematics of mental processes; autism, confabulation, self-deception, MPD; dreaming), philosophy of mind (personal identity, consciousness, and self; philosophical psychology; psychoanalytic theory) can be found at the Rutgers University Center for Cognitive Science (RuCCS).\n\nKolak is an expert on dreams, particularly about how the brain synthesizes experience and creates the virtual world we call reality. His unique work on lucid dreams has recently been featured in a documentary, produced by NBC/Universal, which aired in November 2006.\n\nAs a composer and musician he has performed in concert on numerous occasions, both solo and with leading musicians such as Charlie Byrd, Dizzy Gillespie and Frank Zappa. As a theatrical director and composer he has won the coveted Helen Hayes Creativity Award for productions such as Sartre's \"No Exit\" at the Source Theater in Washington, D.C. Among his film work is the teleplay \"Id-Entity\", about multiple personality disorder as seen through the eyes of four patients, which Kolak wrote, directed, and produced, and the score and soundtrack for \"Forsaken Cries: the Case of Rwanda\" which he produced for PBS, by Amnesty International and narrated by Danny Glover. Most recently Kolak served as special advisor to Martin Scorsese in the making of the Academy Award-winning film \"The Departed\".\n\nIn the United States, Kolak successfully lobbied the U.S. government on behalf of the children and retirees of the United Nations and its sister institutions the IMF and World Bank. As president and co-founder of the G-4 Coalition in Washington, D.C., Kolak helped write a bill, sponsored by US Senator Ted Kennedy, allowing the children and retirees of the IMF and World Bank to become permanent U.S. residents. He testified before Congress and worked together with former World Bank President Robert S. McNamara to lobby successfully for the bill's passage. For his efforts on behalf of the international community living in the United States, he received a personal commendation from the Secretary General of the United Nations.\n\n\n\n\nKolak's Lovers of Wisdom website was designed by former William Paterson University philosophy students. It contains further resources on numerous philosophers.\n\n\n"}

The Declaration of Geneva was intended as a revision of the Hippocratic Oath to a formulation of that oath's moral truths that could be comprehended and acknowledged in a modern way. Unlike the case of the Oath of Hippocrates, the World Medical Association calls the statement a \"pledge\".\n\nDuring the post World War II era and immediately after its foundation, the World Medical Association (WMA) showed concern over the state of medical ethics in general and all over the world, taking the responsibility for setting ethical guidelines for the world physicians. The details of the Nazi Doctors' Trial at Nuremberg which ended August 1947 and the revelations about what the Imperial Japanese Army had done at Unit 731 in China during the war clearly demonstrated the need for reform, and for a re-affirmed set of guidelines regarding both human rights and the rights of patients.\n\nA study committee was appointed to prepare a \"Charter of Medicine\" which could be adopted as an oath or promise that every doctor in the world would make upon receiving his/her medical degree or diploma. It took two years of intensive study of the oaths and promises submitted by member associations to draft a modernized wording of the ancient oath of Hippocrates which was sent for consideration at the WMA's second general assembly in Geneva in 1948. The medical vow was adopted and the assembly agreed to name it the \"Declaration of Geneva.\" This document was adopted by the World Medical Association only three months before the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) which provides for the security of the person.\n\nThe Declaration of Geneva, as currently published by the World Medical Association\nreads:\nThe original oath read \"My colleagues will be my brothers,\" later changed to \"sisters and brothers.\" Age, disability, gender, and sexual orientation have been added as factors that must not interfere with a doctor's duty to a patient; some rephrasing of existing elements has occurred. Secrets are to remain confidential \"even after the patient has died.\" The violation of \"human rights and civil liberties\" replaces \"the laws of humanity\" as a forbidden use of medical knowledge. \"The health\" in general of a patient is now the doctor's first consideration compared to the \"health and life\" as stated in the original declaration. This was apparently changed to free the medical profession from extending life at all cost.\nThe 68th WMA General Assembly in October 2017 approved revisions including: respecting the autonomy of the patient; mutual respect for teachers, colleagues and students physicians to share medical knowledge for the benefit of their patients and the advancement of healthcare; a requirement for physicians to attend to their own health as well as their patients. Furthermore, the revised text is meant to be used by all active physicians (\"as member of the medical profession\") while before the text was used by beginners only (\"At the time of being admitted as a member of the medical profession\").\n\nThe Declaration of Geneva was originally adopted by the WMA General Assembly in 1948 right after one year of the formation of World Medical Association, and has undergone a series of amendments throughout the years, until 2006 and the latest amendments, made at the 68th WMA General Assembly in Chicago in October 2017, make several significant additions—most notably that, in order to provide a high standard of care to patients, doctors must look after their own health\n\nThe newly revised Declaration of Geneva, released in October, contains some modifications in terms of words throughout but also three entirely new points.:\n\nThe new Geneva Declaration version gives respect to patient and the community.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3731503", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3731503", "title": "Desiring-production", "text": "Desiring-production\n\nDesiring-production () is a term coined by the French thinkers Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari in their book \"Anti-Œdipus\" (1972).\n\nDeleuze and Guattari oppose the Freudian conception of the unconscious as a representational \"theater\", instead favoring a productive \"factory\" model: desire is not an imaginary force based on lack, but a real, productive force. They describe the machinic nature of desire as a kind of \"desiring-machine\" that functions as a circuit breaker in a larger \"circuit\" of various other machines to which it is connected. Meanwhile, the desiring-machine is also producing a flow of desire from itself. Deleuze and Guattari conceptualize a multi-functional universe composed of such machines all connected to each other: \"There are no desiring-machines that exist outside the social machines that they form on a large scale; and no social machines without the desiring machines that inhabit them on a small scale.\" Desiring-production is explosive: \"there is no desiring-machine capable of being assembled without demolishing entire social sectors\".\n\nThe concept of desiring-production is part of Deleuze and Guattari's more general appropriation of Friedrich Nietzsche's formulation of the Will to Power. In both concepts, a pleasurable force of appropriation of what is outside oneself, incorporating into oneself what is other than oneself, characterizes the essential process of all life. Similarly, a kind of reverse force of \"forgetting\" in Nietzsche and the body without organs in Deleuze and Guattari disavows the Will to Power and desiring-production, attempting to realize the ideal of an hermetic subject.\n\nThenceforth, while very interested by Wilhelm Reich's fundamental question — \"why did the masses desire fascism?\" — they criticized his dualist theory leading to a rational social reality on one side, and an irrational desire reality on the other side. \"Anti-Œdipus\" was thus an attempt to think beyond Freudo-Marxism; and Deleuze and Guattari tried to do for Freud what Marx had done for Adam Smith.\n\nPublished in the same year as \"Anti-Œdipus\", Guy Hocquenghem's \"Homosexual Desire\" re-articulated desiring-production within the emergent field of queer theory.\n\n\n"}

Yi Hwang had retired to the location in 1549 and begun construction on the facility, a private Korean Confucian academy offering instruction in the classics and honouring the sages with regular memorial rites.\n\nLike other Korean Confucian academies, Dosan Seowon serves two purposes: education and commemoration. The site was well known in Korea as one of the leading academies and was home to the Toegye School of Thought for over 400 years. Although the educational function of the facility has long since ceased, the commemorative ceremonies have been and are still held twice a year.\n\nThe ancient academy was royally chartered in 1575 by King Seonjo and was featured on the reverse of the South Korean 1,000 won bill from 1975 to 2007 (BOK Series Designation Series II (나) 1983–2002).\n\nThe Dosan Seowon complex consists of \"Dosan Seodang\" (lecture hall), which Toegye built and where he taught his students and where a tablet reading \"Dosan Seowon\", that was a gift from King Seonjo, still hangs, \"Nongun Jeongsa,\" (dormitory for the students), and \"Jeongyodang,\" (square lotus pond). \n\nDosan Seodang is composed of three parts; an exposed floor, a large room, and a kitchen. As Toegye was not wealthy, it took him four years to complete the construction of this building. A small signboard reading \"Dosan Seowon\", whose calligraphy Toegye he himself wrote, still hangings on one of the pillars at the end of Dosan Seodang.\n\nLooking carefully at the Dosan Seodang floor, you will see an extension made of wooden planks. One of Toegye’s students, Jeonggu, recommended that Toegye extend the building's floor to accommodate more students. But although Toegye turned down Jeonggu's recommendation, Jeonggu and his fellow students hastily attached wooden planks to the floor while Toegye was out. Consequently, this part of the floor is not very elegant in construction and appearance (see Gallery photo below).\n\nThe garden is small but Toegye dug a small square pond called \"Jeongudang\" in the eastern part of the compound where he raised lotus flowers, and planted apricot trees in the western part. Toegye used to call apricots, bamboos, chrysanthemums, and pine trees his \"friends\", but he loved apricot trees most. \n\n\n\n"}

He was born within England at Eyton-on-Severn near Wroxeter, Shropshire. After private tuition, he matriculated at University College, Oxford, as a gentleman commoner, in May 1596. On 28 February 1599, at the age of 14, he married his cousin Mary, then aged 21, (\"notwithstanding the disparity of years betwixt us\"), who was daughter and heiress of Sir William Herbert (d. 1593). He returned to Oxford with his wife and mother, continued his studies, and learned French, Italian and Spanish, as well as music, riding and fencing. During this period, before he was 21, he started a family.\n\nHerbert entered Parliament as knight of the shire for Montgomeryshire in 1601. On the accession of King James I he presented himself at court and was created a Knight of the Bath on 24 July 1603. From 1604 to 1611 he was Member of Parliament for Merioneth. From 1605 he was magistrate and appointed sheriff in Montgomeryshire for 1605.\n\nIn 1608, Edward Herbert went to Paris, with Aurelian Townshend, enjoying the friendship and hospitality of the old Constable de Montmorency at Merlou and meeting King Henry IV; he lodged for many months with Isaac Casaubon. On his return, as he wrote of himself, he was \"in great esteem both in court and city, many of the greatest desiring my company\". At this period he was close to both Ben Jonson and John Donne, and in Jonson's \"Epicoene, or the Silent Woman\" Herbert is probably alluded to. Both Donne and Jonson honoured him in poetry.\n\nIn 1610, Herbert served as a volunteer in the Low Countries under the Prince of Orange, whose intimate friend he became, and distinguished himself at the capture of Juliers from the emperor. He offered to decide the war by engaging in single combat with a champion chosen from among the enemy, but his challenge was declined. During an interval in the fighting he paid a visit to Spinola, in the Spanish camp near Wezel, and afterwards to the elector palatine at Heidelberg, subsequently travelling in Italy. At the instance of the Duke of Savoy he led an expedition of 4,000 Huguenots from Languedoc into Piedmont to help the Savoyards against Spain, but after nearly losing his life in the journey to Lyon he was imprisoned on his arrival there, and the enterprise came to nothing. Thence he returned to the Netherlands and the Prince of Orange, arriving in England in 1617.\n\nIn 1619, Herbert was made ambassador to Paris, taking in his entourage Thomas Carew. A quarrel with de Luynes and a challenge sent by him to the latter occasioned his recall in 1621. After the death of de Luynes, Herbert resumed his post in February 1622.\n\nHe was popular at the French court and showed considerable diplomatic ability. His chief objects were to accomplish the marriage between Charles, Prince of Wales and Henrietta Maria, and to secure the assistance of Louis XIII for Frederick V, Elector Palatine. He failed in the latter, and was dismissed in April 1624.\n\nHerbert returned home greatly in debt and received little reward for his services beyond the Irish peerage of Castle Island on 31 May 1624 and the English barony of Cherbury, or Chirbury, on 7 May 1629.\n\nIn 1632, Herbert was appointed a member of the council of war. He attended the king at York in 1639, and in May 1642 was imprisoned by the parliament for urging the addition of the words \"without cause\" to the resolution that the king violated his oath by making war on parliament. He determined after this to take no further part in the struggle, retired to Montgomery Castle, and declined the king's summons, pleading ill-health.\n\nOn 5 September 1644 he surrendered the castle, by negotiation, to the Parliamentary forces led by Sir Thomas Myddelton. He returned to London, submitted, and was granted a pension of £20 a week. In 1647 he paid a visit to Pierre Gassendi at Paris, and died in London the following summer, aged 65, being buried in the church of St Giles in the Fields.\n\nLord Herbert left two sons, Richard (c. 1600–1655), who succeeded him as 2nd Lord Herbert of Cherbury, and Edward. Richard's sons, Edward Herbert (d.1678) and Henry Herbert (d.1691), each succeeded to the title, after which it became extinct. It was revived in 1694 when Henry Herbert (1654–1709), son of Sir Henry Herbert (1595–1673), brother of the 1st Lord Herbert, was created Lord Herbert of Cherbury. Lord Herbert's cousin and namesake, Sir Edward Herbert, was also a prominent figure in the English Civil War.\n\nHerbert's major work is the \"De Veritate, prout distinguitur a revelatione, a verisimili, a possibili, et a falso (On Truth, as It Is Distinguished from Revelation, the Probable, the Possible, and the False)\" He published it on the advice of Grotius.\n\nIn the \"De veritate\", Herbert produced the first purely metaphysical treatise, written by an Englishman. Herbert's real claim to fame is as \"the father of English Deism\". The common notions of religion are the famous five articles, which became the charter of the English deists. Charles Blount, in particular, acted as a publicist for Herbert's idea.\n\nIt has been placed on the index of forbidden books of the Catholic Church.\n\nThe \"De religione gentilium\" was a posthumous work, influenced by the \"De theologia gentili\" of Gerardus Vossius, and seen into print by Isaac Vossius. It is an early work on comparative religion, and gives, in David Hume's words, \"a natural history of religion.\" It is also to some extent dependent on the \"De dis Syris\" of John Selden, and the \"Quaestiones celeberrimae in Genesim\" of Marin Mersenne. By examining pagan religions Herbert finds the universality of his five great articles, and that these are clearly recognisable. The same vein is maintained in the tracts \"De causis errorum\", an unfinished work on logical fallacies, \"Religio laici\", and \"Ad sacerdotes de religione laici\" (1645).\n\nHerbert's first historical work was the \"Expedition Buckinghami ducis\", a defence of the Duke of Buckingham's conduct on the La Rochelle expedition of 1627. \"The Life and Raigne of King Henry VIII\" (1649) is considered good for its period, but hampered by limited sources.\n\nHis poems, published in 1665 (reprinted and edited by John Churton Collins in 1881), show him in general a faithful disciple of Donne. His satires are poor, but a few of his lyrical verses show power of reflection and true inspiration, while his use of the metre afterwards employed by Tennyson in his \"In Memoriam\" is particularly happy and effective. His Neo-Latin poems are evidence of his scholarship. Three of these had appeared together with the \"De causis errorum\" in 1645.\n\nTo these works must be added \"A Dialogue between a Tutor and a Pupil\", which is of disputed authenticity; and a treatise on the king's supremacy in the Church (manuscript in the Record Office and at the Queen's College, Oxford). His autobiography, first published by Horace Walpole in 1764, a naïve and amusing narrative, is much occupied with his duels and amorous adventures, and breaks off in 1624. Missing from it are his friendships and the diplomatic side of his embassy in France, in relation to which he described only the splendour of his retinue and his social triumphs.\n\nHe was a lutenist, and \"Lord Herbert of Cherbury's Lute-Book\" survives in manuscript.\n\nJoseph Waligore, in his article \"The Piety of the English Deists\" has shown that Herbert was one of the most pious of the deists, as he fervently prayed to God and believed God gave signs in answer to our prayers. He was so sure God answered our prayers that he said prayer was an idea God put into every human. He said that:\n\nFor Herbert, this universal testimony of God answering our prayers meant that it was a common notion or something engraved into our heart by God.\n\nHerbert was speaking from experience. In his autobiography, Herbert said he once prayed for and received a divine sign. He had written \"De Veritate\" and was wondering whether he should publish it. So he got down on his knees and prayed fervently to God for a sign instructing him what to do. Even though it was a clear, sunny day with no wind, Herbert said he heard a gentle noise in the clear sky that so comforted him that he decided it was a sign from God that he should publish his book. Herbert wrote:\n\nHerbert was attacked by orthodox Protestant ministers of the eighteenth century as a religious enthusiast. One minister, John Brown, said his claim to have received a sign from God was \"enthusiastic\". Another minister, John Leland, said even asking for such a sign was improper, as God does not become involved like that in people’s lives. Leland said that Herbert’s claim \"passed for a high fit of enthusiasm. ... I think it maybe justly doubted, whether an address of such a particular kind, as that made by his Lordship, was proper or regular. It does not seem to me, that we are well-founded to apply for or to expect an extraordinary sign from heaven.\" Clearly these two eighteenth-century Christian commentators did not see Herbert's understanding of God as distant and uninvolved. Rather, Herbert was attacked for believing in an overly-involved deity who had an overly-intimate relationship with people.\n\nModern scholars of deism often have difficulty fitting Herbert's religious views into their scheme of what deists believed. For example, Peter Gay said that Herbert – who lived in the early seventeenth century – was atypical of the later deists because Herbert thought he had received a divine sign. But Waligore argues that instead of saying Herbert was not a deist, we should change our notions about the deists and their relationship to God through prayer.\n\nBesides believing in prayers and divine signs, Herbert also believed in miracles, revelation, and direct divine inspiration. Herbert was so sure God performed miracles that he thought this doctrine, and the related notion that God answered our prayers, was an idea God put into every human. Herbert said his emphasis on natural religion did not mean revelation was superfluous. He said he thought the Bible was a \"surer source of consolation and support\" than any other book and reading it stirred \"the whole inner man\" to life. Herbert thought that divine inspiration generally happened through \"the medium of spirits ... variously called angels, demons, intelligences and geniuses\". He said that we could be sure we had divine inspiration if we prepared ourselves for it and it met certain conditions. To begin with, said Herbert, \"we must employ prayers, vows, faith and every faculty which can be used to invoke\" the divine. Then \"the breath of the Divine Spirit must be immediately felt\" and the recommended course of action must be good. When these conditions were met, \"and we feel the Divine guidance in our activities, we must recognize with reverence the good will of God\".\n\n\n\n"}

He worked in numerous fields including psychology (sometimes considered to be the founder of Finnish psychology), physics and theater, and attempted to find unifying principles behind various branches of human and natural sciences.\n\nEino Kaila was born in Alajärvi, Finland. Kaila's father, Erkki Kaila was a Protestant minister and later archbishop. He graduated from the University of Helsinki in 1910. In the 1920s he worked in the field of literary criticism and psychology as a professor at the University of Turku and is said to have been the first to introduce gestalt psychology to Finland. He was a part of the cultural circles of the time with the likes of Jean Sibelius and Frans Eemil Sillanpää. In 1916 he married the painter Anna Lovisa Snellman, who was granddaughter of Johan Vilhelm Snellman. He had University positions as lecturer in Helsinki and professor in Turku, and in 1930 he was appointed professor of theoretical philosophy at the University of Helsinki. In the 1930s, Kaila was closely associated with the Vienna Circle.\n\nDuring World War II, Kaila lectured in Germany. In 1948 Kaila became a member of the Finnish Academy. He died in Kirkkonummi on July 31, 1958.\n\nDespite being greatly influenced by the logical positivists and critical of unempirical speculation, an aspect common to all of Kaila's work was in strive for a holistic, almost pantheistic understanding of things. He also maintained a more naturalist approach to psychology. His book \"Persoonallisuus\" (1934, Personality) was a psychological study with philosophical dimensions, in which emphasized the biological nature of psychological phenomena. During the last years of his life he attempted to construct a theory of everything in \"Terminalkausalität Als Die Grundlage Eines Unitarischen Naturbegriffs\", but this, what was meant to be the first installment in a more extensive study, was not met with much enthusiasm outside of Finland.\n\nThough he withdrew his support of the National Socialists before the end of the Second World War, he wrote about the differences between \"western\" and \"eastern\" thought and claimed that the homogeneity of the people was a necessity for a functioning democracy. After the war his close friendships with Edwin Linkomies and Veikko Antero Koskenniemi put a political shadow even over Kaila.\n\nKaila's most famous pupil was Georg Henrik von Wright, who was the successor of Ludwig Wittgenstein at the University of Cambridge. The tradition of highly German-influenced analytical-idealist philosophy which Kaila championed remained unchallenged in Finnish philosophy until the appearance of continental influences in the 1980s. \n\nKaila founded the psychological laboratory at the University of Helsinki, and educated the next generation of psychologists. He contributed to founding professorship in psychology, and to establishment of the Faculty of Political Science together with Edwin Linkomies.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "35182952", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35182952", "title": "Embodied language processing", "text": "Embodied language processing\n\nEmbodied cognition occurs when an organism’s sensorimotor capacities (ability of the body to respond to its senses with movement), body and environment play an important role in thinking. The way in which a person’s body and their surroundings interacts also allows for specific brain functions to develop and in the future to be able to act. This means that not only does the mind influence the body’s movements, but the body also influences the abilities of the mind, also termed the bi-directional hypothesis. \nThere are three generalizations that are assumed to be true relating to embodied cognition. A person's motor system (that controls movement of the body) is activated when (1) they observe manipulable objects, (2) process action verbs, and (3) observe another individual's movements.\n\nEmbodied semantics is one of two theories concerning the location and processing of sensory motors inputs within the human brain. The theory of embodied semantics involves the existence of specialized hubs where the meaning of a word is tied with the sensory motor processing unit associated with the word meaning. For example, the concept of kicking would be represented in the sensory motor areas that control kicking actions. As a result, the theory assumes that individuals must possess a body to understand English.\n\nThe overlap between various semantic categories with sensory motor areas suggests that a common mechanism is used by neurons to process action, perception, and semantics. The correlation principle states that neurons that fire together, wire together. Also, neurons out of sync, delink. When an individual pronounces a word, the activation pattern for articulatory motor systems of the speaker leads to activation of auditory and somatosensory systems due to self-perceived sounds and movements. If a word meaning is grounded in the visual shapes of the objects, the word form circuit is active together with neural activity in the ventral-temporal visual stream related to processing of visual object information. Correlation learning links the word and object circuits, resulting in an embodied object-semantic relationship.\n\nA semantic hub represents a focal point in the brain where all semantic information pertaining to a specific word is integrated. For example, the color, shape, size, smell, and sound associated with the word “cat” would be integrated at the same semantic hub. Some candidate regions for semantic hubs include:\nSemantic integration mechanisms involve various hub sites listed above, which contradicts the idea that there is one center where all integration occurs. However, each individual hub is compliant with the amodal model. Collectively, all of the hubs provide evidence for the theory that there are areas within the brain where emotional, sensory, and motor information all converge in one area.\n\nEach potential semantic hub is activated to a specific degree according to the category that the perceived word belongs to. For example, lesions to each of the five potential hubs do not affect all words. Instead, experimental data determines that one semantic category suffers more than another as it pertains to the word.\nSome of the category differences are thought to be produced by the adjacent hubs. For example, category specificity is greatest close to the piriform and anterior insular olfactory cortex. Here, odor words such as “cinnamon” lead to greater activation than control words. In the gustatory cortex in the anterior insula and frontal operculum, taste words such as “sugar” lead to a stronger activation.\n\nExperiential Trace Hypothesis states that each time an individual interacts with the world, traces of that particular experience are left in our brain. These traces can be accessed again when a person thinks of words or sentences that remind them of that experience. Additionally, these traces in our brain are linked to the action that they are related to. Words and sentences become those cues that retrieve these traces from our mind. Researchers have studied if the previous experience with a word, such as its location (up or down) in space, affects how people understand and then respond to that word. In one experiment, researchers hypothesized that if reading an object word also activates a location that is linked to that noun, then the following action response should be compatible with that association. They found that participants were faster to push a button higher than another button when the word was associated with being \"up\" or \"above\" than when the button was lower than the other for words associated with \"up\" and \"above\". The results of this study displayed that participants were faster to respond when the location of the word and the action they had to perform were similar. This demonstrates that language processing and action are connected. This research also found that the location information of a word is automatically activated after seeing the word. In a similar study, it was discovered that participants were equally as fast at responding to words that were associated with either an upward or downward location when the buttons to respond to these words were horizontal – meaning that the experiential trace effect was ruled out when the responding action did not link to either of the locations that were activated.\n\nSome theorists have proposed an experiential-simulation approach of language understanding. They argue that previous experiential traces related to a word may be reactivated at a later stage when accessing the meaning of the same word. This has been highlighted through the example of encountering the word ‘airplane’ in a situation where someone points to an airplane in the sky, thus making one look upwards. These experiential traces, e.g. ‘looking upwards’ are later reactivated when accessing the meaning of the word ‘airplane'. Similarly, another example might be when a person accesses the meaning of the word ‘snail’, they might also access experiential traces associated with this word, e.g. ‘looking downwards’ (likely towards the ground).\n\nAs a result of previous experience to certain words, several studies have found that the action associated with a certain word is also activated in the motor cortices when processing that same word. For example, using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), it was discovered that exposure to concrete action verbs referring to face, arm, or leg actions (e.g., to lick, pick, kick) activated motor regions that are stimulated when making actions with the foot, hand, or mouth.\n\nHowever, findings are not as clear cut when abstract verbs are involved. Embodied theories of language comprehension assume that abstract concepts, as well as concrete ones, are grounded in the sensorimotor system (Jirak et al., 2010). Some studies have investigated the activation of motor cortices using abstract and also concrete verbs, examining the stimulation of the motor cortices when comprehending literal action verbs (concrete) vs. the metaphorical usage of the same action verbs (abstract). One such study used fMRI to study participants whilst they viewed actions performed by the mouth, hand or foot, and read literal and metaphorical sentences related to the mouth hand or foot. This study found activation in the premotor cortex for literal action (e.g. “grasping the scissors”) but not for metaphorical usage (e.g. “grasping the idea”). These findings suggest that the assumption of embodied theories that abstract concepts, as well as concrete ones, are grounded in the sensorimotor system may not be true.\n\nHowever, in contrast, other research has found motor cortex activation for the metaphorical usage of action verbs. One such study investigated cortical activation during comprehension of literal and idiomatic sentences using Magnetoencephalography (MEG). During a silent reading task, participants were presented with stimuli which included both literal and metaphorical arm-related action verbs, e.g. “Mary caught the fish” versus “Mary caught the sun”, and also literal and metaphorical leg-related action verbs, e.g. “Pablo jumped on the armchair” versus “Pablo jumped on the bandwagon”. This study found that processing of abstract verbs (idioms in this case) did indeed activate motor regions of the brain, activating anterior fronto-temporal activity very early compared to literal verbs.\n\nHauk and colleagues found that reading words associated with foot, hand, or mouth actions (examples: kick, pick, lick) activated by motor areas adjacent or overlapping with areas activated by making actions with the hand, foot, or mouth. Additionally, neurolinguist Tettmanti and colleagues found that listening to action related sentences activated the premotor cortex in a somatotopic fashion. Example: leg sentences showed premotor activity dorsal to hand sentences dorsal to mouth sentences.\n\nAziz-Zadeh and colleagues localized foot, hand, and mouth premotor regions of interest in each subject by having subjects watch actions associated with each effector and read phrases associated with the foot, hand, and mouth. In each subject, regions most activated for watching a foot action were also most active for language related to foot actions. The same was true for the hand and mouth. Rizzolatti and colleagues have suggested that action plan (manipulating, reaching) is more important than the actual effector involved.\n\nOther studies have investigated activation of the motor system during comprehension of concrete and abstract sentences. Using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and a behavioural paradigm, one study investigated whether listening to action-related sentences activated activity within the motor cortices. This was investigated using Motor Evoked Potentials (MEPs) from the TMS which were recorded from hand muscles when stimulating the hand motor area, and from foot and leg muscles when stimulating the foot motor area. Participants were presented with sentences relating to hand or foot actions. As control, participants listened to sentences containing abstract content. The study found there was indeed activation of the motor cortices whilst listening to sentences expressing foot/leg and hand/arm actions. This activation specifically concerned the areas of the motor system ‘where the effector involved in the processed sentence is motorically represented’ (pp. 360). Specifically, the results showed that listening to hand-action-related sentences prompted a decrease of MEP amplitude recorded from hand muscles and listening to foot-action-related sentences prompted a decrease of MEP amplitude recorded from foot muscle.\n\nAziz-Zadeh found that although both action observation and reading phrases about actions caused activity in premotor and prefrontal regions in the vicinity of Broca’s area, the activated regions largely did not overlap. Activations for reading phrases were anterior and medial to activations for action observation.\n\nAziz-Zadeh’s research contradicts that of Hamzei who stressed the overlap of language and action observation activations in the inferior frontal gyrus. However, the difference in results most likely was due to the difference in language tasks. Hamzei used a verb generation task that caused widespread activation in the inferior frontal gyrus and the premotor cortex. The action observation task led to a small activation area within the larger activation area. Therefore, Hamzei noticed the overlap between areas. Aziz-Zadeh used a less extensive frontal activation task which allowed for areas activated by reading and by action observation to be clearly distinguished.\n\n\"See also:\" The Bi-Directional Hypothesis of Language and Action\n\nSentence processing can facilitate activation of motor systems based on the actions referred to in the sentence. In one study, researchers asked participants to make judgments on whether a sentence was sensible or not. For example, \"You handed Courtney the notebook\" versus \"Courtney handed you the notebook\". They asked participants in one condition to push a button farther away from their body if the sentence was logical and a button close to their body when it wasn't logical. The results of this study demonstrated that participants were faster at pushing the \"sentence is logical\" button when the action in the sentence matched the action required by them to push the correct button. This means if the sentence read \"you handed Courtney the notebook\", the participants were faster to push the button that was farther away from them when this button meant the sentence was logical. The depicted motion in these sentences affected the amount of time required to understand the sentences that described the motion that is in the same direction. This effect has been shown to apply to sentences that describe concrete actions (putting a book on a shelf) as well as more abstract actions (you told the story to the policeman).\n\nOther studies have tried to understand the ACE phenomenon by examining the modulation of motor resonance during language comprehension. In one study participants were asked to read sentences containing a frame of between one and three words. The participants had to rotate a knob, in one direction for half of the experiment and in the other direction for the other half. Each 5° of rotation induced the presentation of a new frame. Each of the sentences described actions involving manual rotation. In these, the rotation direction would or would not match the rotation direction implied by the sentence. Earlier studies, such as that by Glenberg & Kaschak (2002), examined motor resonance in responses to sentences presumably given after the sentence was read. In contrast, results of this study revealed that motor resonance had dissipated before the end of the sentence, with motor resonance occurring on the verb. This study made use of comprehension questions rather than sensibility sentences. The researchers have argued that this created a more naturalistic reading situation, so it could be argued that the results of this study are deemed more suitable because they are in regards to more naturalistic language. Overall, the researchers have concluded that motor resonance is quite immediate and short-lived and that duration of the effect is modified by linguistic context.\n\nNeurophysiological evidence has also been presented to prove an ACE. This research used a behavioural paradigm as well as Event-Related Potential (ERP) to record brain activity, allowing the researchers to explore the neural brain markers of the ACE paradigm in semantic processing and motor responses. ERP was particularly beneficial in helping the researchers to investigate the bi-directional hypothesis of action-sentence comprehension, which proposes that language processing facilitates movement and movement also facilitates language comprehension. In the study participants listened to sentences describing an action that involved an open hand, a closed hand or no manual action. They were then required to press a button to indicate their understanding of the sentence. Each participant was assigned a hand-shape, either closed or open, which was required to activate the button. As well as two groups (closed or open hand-shapes), there were three different categories relating to hand-shape: compatible, incompatible and neutral. Behavioural results from the study showed that participants responded quicker when the hand-shape required to press the response-button was compatible with the hand-shape inferred by the sentence. ERP results provided evidence to support the bi-directional hypothesis, showing that cortical markers of motor processes were affected by sentence meaning, therefore providing evidence for a semantics-to-motor effect. ERP results also demonstrated a motor-to-semantics effect as brain markers of comprehension were modified by motor effects.\n\nThe Action-Compatibility Effect also states that the brain resources used to plan and carry out actions are also used in language comprehension; therefore, if an action implied in a sentence is different from the suggested response, there is interference within these brain resources.\n\nOther studies have demonstrated that reading an object name interferes with how a person plans on grasping that object. It was also found that similar words can prime similar actions. Playing the piano and using a typewriter both utilize similar motor actions; these words prime each other in a word decision task. These studies have concluded that activation of motor decisions occur automatically when exposed to action-related words.\n\nAziz-Zadeh investigated congruent somatotopic organization of semantic representations for metaphorical sentences in either hemisphere. Aziz-Zadeh presented subjects with stimuli such as “kick the bucket” or “bite the bullet” to read and then followed by presenting subjects with videos of hand, foot, and mouth actions. Evidence could not be found in either hemisphere to support this theory.\n\nThe metaphors used in the experiment are common in the English language however. Therefore, the argument stands that if a metaphor is heard often enough it will not activate the same network of processing that it did initially.\n\nMany studies have shown how body movements and speech can be combined to emphasize meaning (often called gesturing). A person can observe the actions of another to help them comprehend what that person is saying. For example, if a person is pointing repeatedly, it helps the listener to understand that the direction being inferred is very important; whereas if it was a casual point in the general direction, the location of the object may not be as necessary to comprehend what the speaker is saying. Another example may be the stomping of one’s foot. This can help the listener to understand the anger and frustration being conveyed by the speaker.\n\nMany studies have demonstrated that people’s understanding of words and sentences can influence their movements and actions as well as the opposite – peoples’ actions can influence how quickly they can comprehend a word or sentence. This knowledge is important for many reasons. One study looked at the impact of embodied cognition in a classroom setting to facilitate and enhance language learning. For a child, there is a difference between oral language learning and reading. In oral language learning, the mapping between a symbol (word) and the object is common – often brought about by gesturing to the object. However, when a child is learning to read, they focus on the letter-sound combinations and the correct pronunciation of the words. Usually, the object the words are referring to, are not immediately connected with the word so an association between the word and object isn't immediately made. The researchers of this study suggest the \"Moved by Reading\" intervention which consists of two parts – Physical Manipulation stage and an Imagined Manipulation stage. In physical manipulation, the child reads a sentence and then is instructed to act out that sentence with available toys. This forces the child to connect words with objects and their actions. In the imagined manipulation stage, the child reads the sentence and is then asked to imagine how they would interact with toys to act out the sentence. They studied this further and discovered that it is possible for these children to still benefit from the effects of embodied cognition when they manipulate objects on a computer screen. This embodied cognition software can help children facilitate language comprehension. Other implications for language instruction that would enhance acquisition and retention are to offer activities which invite learners to actively use their body in the process, or at least observe the teacher doing so, thus activating their mirror neurons.\n\n"}

Those who supported them chose to call themselves \"Remonstrants\".\n\nForty-six preachers and the two leaders of the Leyden state college for the education of preachers met in The Hague on 14 January 1610, to state in written form their views concerning all disputed doctrines. The document in the form of a was drawn up by Jan Uytenbogaert and after a few changes was endorsed and signed by all in July.\n\nThe Remonstrants did not reject confession and catechism, but did not acknowledge them as permanent and unchangeable canons of faith. They ascribed authority only to the word of God in Holy Scripture and were averse to all formalism. They also maintained that the secular authorities have the right to interfere in theological disputes to preserve peace and prevent schisms in the Church.\n\nThe Five Articles of Remonstrance were subject to review by the Dutch National Synod held in Dordrecht in 1618–19 (see the Synod of Dort). The judgements of the Synod, known as the Canons of Dort (Dordrecht), opposed the Remonstrance with Five Heads of Doctrine. Each in answer to one of the Articles of the Remonstrance. It was this response which gave rise to what has since become known as the Five Points of Calvinism. Modified to form the acrostic TULIP they covered the soteriological topics within Calvinism, summarizing the essence of what they believe constitutes an orthodox view on each of sin: total depravity, the basis of God's choice of the saved: unconditional election, the application of the benefits of the atonement: limited atonement, how the Holy Spirit brings man to repentance and faith: irresistible grace, and the assurance that the saints will bring forth the fruits of the Spirit: perseverance of the saints.\n\nThe Five Articles of Remonstrance contrast with the Five Points of Calvinism on most points. Article I disagrees that election into Christ is unconditional. Rather, in this article the Remonstrants assert that election is conditional upon faith in Christ, and that God elects to salvation those He knows beforehand will have faith in Him. Article II espouses unlimited atonement, the concept that Christ died for all. This stands in contrast to the limited atonement of Calvinism, which asserts that Christ only died for those God chooses to be saved. Article III affirms the total depravity of man, that man cannot save himself. Article IV repudiates the Calvinistic concept of irresistible grace, contending that mankind has the free will to resist God's grace. Article V, rather than outright rejecting the notion of perseverance of the saints, argues that it may be conditional upon the believer remaining in Christ. The writers explicitly stated that they were not sure on this point, and that further study was needed. The text of the articles is public domain (not copyrighted) and is provided below:\n\n\nThe Remonstrants' Five Articles of Remonstrance was met with a response written primarily by Festus Hommius, called The Counter-Remonstrance of 1611. The Counter-Remonstrance of 1611 defended the Belgic Confession against theological criticisms from the followers of late Jacob Arminius, although Arminius himself claimed adherence to the Belgic Confession and Heidelberg Catechism till his death.\n\n1. As in Adam the whole human race, created in the image of God, has with Adam fallen into sin and thus become so corrupt that all men are conceived and born in sin and thus are by nature children of wrath, lying dead in their trespasses so that there is within them no more power to convert themselves truly unto God and to believe in Christ than a corpse has power to raise itself from the dead; so God draws out of this condemnation and delivers a certain number of men who in his eternal and immutable counsel He has chosen out of mere grace, according to the good pleasure of his will, unto salvation in Christ, passing by the others in his just judgment and leaving them in their sins.\n\n2. that not only adults who believe in Christ and accordingly walk worthy of the gospel are to be reckoned as God’s elect children, but also the children of the covenant so long as they do not in their conduct manifest the contrary; and that therefore believing parents, when their children die in infancy, have no reason to doubt the salvation of these their children.\n\n3. that God in his election has not looked to the faith or conversion of his elect, nor to the right use of his gifts, as the grounds of election; but that on the contrary He in his eternal and immutable counsel has purposed and decreed to bestow faith and perseverance in godliness and thus to save those whom He according to his good pleasure has chosen to salvation.\n\n4. that to this end He has first of all presented and given to them his only-begotten Son Jesus Christ, whom He delivered up to the death of the cross in order to save his elect, so that, although the suffering of Christ as that of the only-begotten and unique Son of God is sufficient unto the atonement of the sins of all men, nevertheless the same, according to the counsel and decree of God, has its efficacy unto reconciliation and forgiveness of sins only in the elect and true believer.\n\n5. that furthermore to the same end God the Lord has his holy gospel preached, and that the Holy Spirit externally through the preaching of that same gospel and internally through a special grace works so powerfully in the hearts of God’s elect, that He illumines their minds, transforms and renews their wills, removing the heart of stone and giving them a heart of flesh, in such a manner that by these means they not only receive power to convert themselves and believe but also actually and willingly do repent and believe.\n\n6. that those whom God has decreed to save are not only once so enlightened, regenerated and renewed in order to believe in Christ and convert themselves to God, but that they by the same power of the Holy Spirit by which they were converted to God without any contribution of themselves are in like manner continually supported and preserved; so that, although many weaknesses of the flesh cleave to them as long as they are in this life and are engaged in a continual struggle between flesh and Spirit and also sometimes fall into grievous sins, nevertheless this same Spirit prevails in this struggle, not permitting that God’s elect by the corruption of the flesh should so resist the Spirit of sanctification that this would at any time be extinguished in them, and that in consequence they could completely or finally lose the true faith which was once bestowed on them and the Spirit of adoption as God’s children which they had once received.\n\n7. that nevertheless the true believers find no excuse in this teaching to pursue carelessly the lusts of the flesh, since it is impossible that those who by a true faith are ingrafted into Christ should not produce the fruits of thankfulness; but on the contrary the more they assure themselves and feel that God works in them both to will and to do according to this good pleasure, the more they persist in working their own salvation with fear and trembling, since they know that this is the only means by which it pleases God to keep them standing and to bring them to salvation. For this reason He also employs in his Word all manner of warnings and threatenings, not in order to cause them to despair or doubt their salvation but rather to awaken in them a childlike fear by observing the weakness of their flesh in which they would surely perish, unless the Lord keep them standing in his underserved grace, which is the sole cause and ground of their perseverance; so that, although He warns them in his Word to watch and pray, they nevertheless do not have this of themselves that they desire God’s help and lack nothing, but only from the same Spirit who by a special grace prepares them for this and thus also powerfully keeps them standing.\n\n"}

As a teenager, he refused his grandfather's offer to send him to a military academy in Spain, returning to Cuba, where he studied to become a priest at San Carlos and San Ambrosio Seminary in Havana, the only seminary in Cuba. He also studied at the University of Havana. At the age of 23 he was ordained in the Cathedral of Havana for the Diocese of San Cristóbal de la Habana.\n\nJoining the seminary faculty within a year of his ordination, he taught philosophy, physics and chemistry. In his position there, he taught many illustrious Cubans, including José Antonio Saco, Domingo del Monte, José de la Luz y Caballero and Felipe Poey. Referring to Varela, De la Luz said: \"As long as there is thought in Cuba, we will have to remember him, the one who taught us how to think\". José Martí's teacher, Rafael María de Mendive, was also Varela's student. During this period, Varela established a literary society and published \"Miscelánea filosófica\", a popular book on philosophy, before he was 30 years old.\n\nIn 1821 Varela was chosen to represent Cuba in the Cortes Generales of Spain in Madrid, where he joined in a petition to the Crown for the independence of Latin America, and also published an essay which argued for the abolition of slavery in Cuba. For such ideas, after the French invasion of Spain in 1823 overthrew the liberal government of Spain and restored King Ferdinand VII who then brutally suppressed all opposition, he was sentenced to death by the government. Before he could be arrested, however, he fled, first to Gibraltar, then to the United States, where he spent the rest of his life, settling in New York City.\n\nIn New York, Varela founded \"El Habanero\", the first Spanish-language newspaper in the United States, though it produced only seven issues. He published other newspapers in Spanish, including \"El Mensajero Semanal\", and also in English \"The Protestant's Abridger and Annotator\". He published many articles about human rights, as well as multiple essays on religious tolerance, cooperation between the English and Spanish-speaking communities, and the importance of education.\n\nAfter spending some months studying English, he served as an assistant at St. Peter's Church on Barclay Street from 1825 to 1827. In 1827, Varela founded the Church of the Immigrant in the poor Five Points neighborhood of Manhattan. The area later became known as Chinatown and the congregation as the Church of the Transfiguration. It continues to serve a largely immigrant community as of 2017, and it houses a memorial to Varela.\n\nIn 1837, Varela was named Vicar General of the Diocese of New York, which then covered all of New York State and the northern half of New Jersey. In this post, he played a major role in the way the American Church dealt with the tremendous influx of Irish refugees, which was just beginning at the time. His desire to assist those in need coupled with his gift for languages allowed him to master the Irish language in order to communicate more efficiently with many of the recent Irish arrivals.\n\nVarela served as a theological consultant to the committee of American bishops which drew up the famous Baltimore Catechism, which began a standard teaching tool for Catholic children in the nation until the mid-20th century. He was later awarded a doctorate of Theology by St. Mary's Seminary in Baltimore, Maryland.\n\nIn 1848, worn out by his labors, Varela developed severe asthma, which led him to retire to St. Augustine, dying there five years later. Nearly sixty years after his death, Varela's body was dis-interred from Tolomato Cemetery and returned to Cuba to be laid to rest in the University of Havana's Aula Magna.\n\nThe Cuban government has created an award bearing his name, entitled the Orden Félix Varela, which is given to those whom the government deems to have contributed to Cuban and worldwide culture. (See List of people awarded the Varela award.)\n\nHis name is currently associated with a project proposed by the Christian Liberation Movement in Cuba, named Proyecto Varela, which was announced to the Cuban people on government-owned TV and radio stations in Cuba by United States President Jimmy Carter. In 1997 the United States Postal Service honored Varela by issuing a 32-cent commemorative stamp. Because of his experiences, many in the Cuban American exile community identify with him.\n\n\nCurrently, Varela is being considered for canonization as a Catholic saint, and was declared a Servant of God, recognizing his life as a devoted Catholic and a model for others in and out of the faith, and officially beginning the process.\n\nOn Easter Sunday, April 8, 2012, both the Archdiocese of New York and the Archdiocese of Miami (each having significant Catholic Cuban-American populations) announced that the Vatican's Sacred Congregation for the Causes of Saints had declared Varela \"Venerable\", meaning he lived a virtuous life within the Catholic faith to a heroic degree and as such is worthy of praise (veneration).\n\nNow, for him to be beatified, the next stage of the process, since he is not a martyr a miracle (officially deemed to be so from an impartial theological and scientific point of view) must be proved attributable to his direct intercession. Canonization would then follow if another such miracle is declared to have occurred after the first. If canonized, he would be the first Cuban-born person to be honored on the altars of the Catholic church.\n\nOn October 30, 2015, Cardinal Jaime Ortega, Archbishop of Havana, appointed Archbishop Vincenzo Paglia as Postulator in the Process for Father Varela's Beatification and Canonization. Archbishop Paglia is also President of the Holy See's Pontifical Council for the Family, as well as Postulator for the Process of Canonization of Blessed Óscar Romero, the martyred Archbishop of San Salvador in El Salvador.\n\n"}

{"id": "246176", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=246176", "title": "Gettier problem", "text": "Gettier problem\n\nThe Gettier problem, in the field of epistemology, is a landmark philosophical problem concerning our understanding of descriptive knowledge. Attributed to American philosopher Edmund Gettier, Gettier-type counterexamples (called \"Gettier-cases\") challenge the long-held justified true belief (JTB) account of knowledge. The JTB account holds that knowledge is equivalent to justified true belief; if all three conditions (justification, truth, and belief) are met of a given claim, then we have knowledge of that claim. In his 1963 three-page paper titled \"Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?\", Gettier attempts to illustrate by means of two counterexamples that there are cases where individuals can have a justified, true belief regarding a claim but still fail to know it because the reasons for the belief, while justified, turn out to be false. Thus, Gettier claims to have shown that the JTB account is inadequate; that it does not account for all of the necessary and sufficient conditions for knowledge.\n\nThe term \"Gettier problem\", \"Gettier case\", or even the adjective \"Gettiered\", is sometimes used to describe any case in the field of epistemology that purports to repudiate the JTB account of knowledge.\n\nResponses to Gettier's paper have been numerous; some reject Gettier's examples, while others seek to adjust the JTB account of knowledge and blunt the force of these counterexamples. Gettier problems have even found their way into sociological experiments, where the intuitive responses from people of varying demographics to Gettier cases have been studied.\n\nThe question of what constitutes \"knowledge\" is as old as philosophy itself. Early instances are found in Plato's dialogues, notably \"Meno\" (97a–98b) and \"Theaetetus\". Gettier himself was not actually the first to raise the problem named after him; its existence was acknowledged by both Alexius Meinong and Bertrand Russell, the latter of which discussed the problem in his book \"Human knowledge: Its scope and limits\".\n\nRussell's case, called the stopped clock case, goes as follows: Alice sees a clock that reads two o'clock and believes that the time is two o'clock. It is, in fact, two o'clock. There's a problem, however: unknown to Alice, the clock she's looking at stopped twelve hours ago. Alice thus has an accidentally true, justified belief. Russell provides an answer of his own to the problem. Edmund Gettier's formulation of the problem was important as it coincided with the rise of the sort of philosophical naturalism promoted by W. V. O. Quine and others, and was used as a justification for a shift towards externalist theories of justification. John L. Pollock and Joseph Cruz have stated that the Gettier problem has \"fundamentally altered the character of contemporary epistemology\" and has become \"a central problem of epistemology since it poses a clear barrier to analyzing knowledge\".\n\nAlvin Plantinga rejects the historical analysis:\nDespite this, Plantinga \"does\" accept that some philosophers before Gettier have advanced a JTB account of knowledge, specifically C. I. Lewis and A. J. Ayer.\n\nThe JTB account of knowledge is the claim that knowledge can be conceptually analyzed as justified true belief, which is to say that the \"meaning\" of sentences such as \"Smith knows that it rained today\" can be given with the following set of conditions, which are necessary and sufficient for knowledge to obtain:\n\nThe JTB account was first credited to Plato, though Plato argued against this very account of knowledge in the \"Theaetetus\" (210a). This account of knowledge is what Gettier subjected to criticism.\n\nGettier's paper used counterexamples (see also thought experiment) to argue that there are cases of beliefs that are both true and justified—therefore satisfying all three conditions for knowledge on the JTB account—but that do not appear to be genuine cases of knowledge. Therefore, Gettier argued, his counterexamples show that the JTB account of knowledge is false, and thus that a different conceptual analysis is needed to correctly track what we mean by \"knowledge\".\n\nGettier's case is based on two counterexamples to the JTB analysis. Each relies on two claims. Firstly, that justification is preserved by entailment, and secondly that this applies coherently to Smith's putative \"belief\". That is, that if Smith is justified in believing P, and Smith realizes that the truth of P entails the truth of Q, then Smith would \"also\" be justified in believing Q. Gettier calls these counterexamples \"Case I\" and \"Case II\":\n\nIn both of Gettier's actual examples (see also counterfactual conditional), the justified true belief came about, if Smith's purported claims are disputable, as the result of entailment (but see also material conditional) from justified false beliefs that \"Jones will get the job\" (in case I), and that \"Jones owns a Ford\" (in case II). This led some early responses to Gettier to conclude that the definition of knowledge could be easily adjusted, so that knowledge was justified true belief that does not depend on false premises.\n\nIn a 1966 scenario known as \"The sheep in the field\", Roderick Chisholm asks us to imagine that someone is standing outside a field looking at something that looks like a sheep (although in fact, it is a dog disguised as a sheep). They believe there is a sheep in the field, and in fact, they are right because there is a sheep behind the hill in the middle of the field. Hence, they have a justified true belief that there is a sheep in the field. But is that belief knowledge? A similar problem which seeks to be more plausible called the \"Cow in the Field\" appears in Martin Cohen's book \"101 Philosophy Problems\", where it is supposed that a farmer checking up on his favourite cow confuses a piece of black and white paper caught up in a distant bush for his cow. However, since the animal actually is in the field, but hidden in a hollow, again, the farmer has a justified, true belief which seems nonetheless not to qualify as \"knowledge\". \n\nAnother scenario by Brian Skyrms is \"The Pyromaniac\", in which a struck match lights not for the reasons the pyromaniac imagines but because of some unknown \"Q radiation\". \n\nA different perspective on the issue is given by Alvin Goldman in the \"fake barns\" scenario (crediting Carl Ginet with the example). In this one, a man is driving in the countryside, and sees what looks exactly like a barn. Accordingly, he thinks that he is seeing a barn. In fact, that is what he is doing. But what he does not know is that the neighborhood generally consists of many fake barns — barn facades designed to look exactly like real barns when viewed from the road, as in the case of a visit in the countryside by Catherine II of Russia, just to please her. Since if he had been looking at one of them, he would have been unable to tell the difference, his \"knowledge\" that he was looking at a barn would seem to be poorly founded. A similar process appears in Robert A. Heinlein's \"Stranger in a Strange Land\" as an example of Fair Witness behavior.\n\nThe \"no false premises\" (or \"no false lemmas\") solution which was proposed early in the discussion proved to be somewhat problematic, as more general Gettier-style problems were then constructed or contrived in which the justified true belief does not seem to be the result of a chain of reasoning from a justified false belief.\n\nFor example:\n\nAgain, it seems as though Luke does not \"know\" that Mark is in the room, even though it is claimed he has a justified true belief that Mark is in the room, but it is not nearly so clear that the \"perceptual belief\" that \"Mark is in the room\" was inferred from any premises at all, let alone any false ones, nor led to significant conclusions on its own; Luke did not seem to be reasoning about anything; \"Mark is in the room\" seems to have been part of what he \"seemed to see\".\n\nTo save the \"no false lemmas\" solution, one must logically say that Luke's inference from sensory data does not count as a justified belief unless he consciously or unconsciously considers the possibilities of deception and self-deception. A justified version of Luke's thought process, by that logic, might go like this:\n\nThe second line counts as a false premise. However, by the previous argument, this suggests we have fewer justified beliefs than we think we do.\n\nThe main idea behind Gettier's examples is that the justification for the belief is flawed or incorrect, but the belief turns out to be true by sheer luck. Thus, a general scenario can be constructed as such:\n\nBob believes A is true because of B. Argument B is flawed, but A turns out to be true by a different argument C. Since A is true, Bob believes A is true, and Bob has justification B, all of the conditions (JTB) are satisfied. However, Bob had no knowledge of A.\n\nThe Gettier problem is formally a problem in first-order logic, but the introduction by Gettier of terms such as \"believes\" and \"knows\" moves the discussion into the field of epistemology. Here, the sound (true) arguments ascribed to Smith then need also to be valid (believed) and convincing (justified) if they are to issue in the real-world discussion about \"justified true belief\".\nResponses to Gettier problems have fallen into one of three categories:\n\n\nOne response, therefore, is that in none of the above cases was the belief justified because it is impossible to justify anything that is not true. Conversely, the fact that a proposition turns out to be untrue is proof that it was not sufficiently justified in the first place. Under this interpretation, the JTB definition of knowledge survives. This shifts the problem to a definition of justification, rather than knowledge. Another view is that justification and non-justification are not in binary opposition. Instead, justification is a matter of degree, with an idea being more or less justified. This account of justification is supported by mainstream philosophers such as Paul Boghossian and Stephen Hicks. In common sense usage, an idea can not only be more justified or less justified, but it can also partially justified (Smith's boss told him X) and partially unjustified (Smith's boss is a liar). Gettier's cases involve propositions that were true, believed, but which had weak justification. In case 1, the premise that the testimony of Smith's boss is \"strong evidence\" is rejected. The case itself depends on the boss being either wrong or deceitful (Jones did not get the job) and therefore unreliable. In case 2, Smith again has accepted a questionable idea (Jones owns a Ford) with unspecified justification. Without justification, both cases do not undermine the JTB account of knowledge.\n\nOther epistemologists accept Gettier's conclusion. Their responses to the Gettier problem, therefore, consist of trying to find alternative analyses of knowledge. They have struggled to discover and agree upon as a beginning any single notion of truth, or belief, or justifying which is wholly and obviously accepted. Truth, belief, and justifying have not yet been satisfactorily defined, so that JTB (justified true belief) may be defined satisfactorily is still problematical, on account or otherwise of Gettier's examples. Gettier, for many years a professor at University of Massachusetts Amherst later also was interested in the epistemic logic of Hintikka, a Finnish philosopher at Boston University, who published \"Knowledge and Belief\" in 1962.\nThe most common direction for this sort of response to take is what might be called a \"JTB+G\" analysis: that is, an analysis based on finding some \"fourth\" condition—a \"no-Gettier-problem\" condition—which, when added to the conditions of justification, truth, and belief, will yield a set of necessary and jointly sufficient conditions.\n\nOne such response is that of Alvin Goldman (1967), who suggested the addition of a \"causal\" condition: a subject's belief is justified, for Goldman, only if the truth of a belief has \"caused\" the subject to have that belief (in the appropriate way); and for a justified true belief to count as knowledge, the subject must \"also\" be able to \"correctly reconstruct\" (mentally) that causal chain. Goldman's analysis would rule out Gettier cases in that Smith's beliefs are not caused by the truths of those beliefs; it is merely \"accidental\" that Smith's beliefs in the Gettier cases happen to be true, or that the prediction made by Smith: \" The winner of the job will have 10 coins\", on the basis of his putative belief, (see also bundling) came true in this one case. This theory is challenged by the difficulty of giving a principled explanation of how an appropriate causal relationship differs from an inappropriate one (without the circular response of saying that the appropriate sort of causal relationship is the knowledge-producing one); or retreating to a position in which justified true belief is weakly defined as the consensus of learned opinion. The latter would be useful, but not as useful nor desirable as the unchanging definitions of scientific concepts such as momentum. Thus, adopting a causal response to the Gettier problem usually requires one to adopt (as Goldman gladly does) some form of reliabilism about justification. See \"Goldman\"s Theory of justification.\n\nKeith Lehrer and Thomas Paxson (1969) proposed another response, by adding a \"defeasibility condition\" to the JTB analysis. On their account, knowledge is \"undefeated justified true belief\" — which is to say that a justified true belief counts as knowledge if and only if it is also the case that there is no further truth that, had the subject known it, would have defeated her present justification for the belief. (Thus, for example, Smith's justification for believing that the person who will get the job has ten coins in his pocket is his justified belief that Jones will get the job, combined with his justified belief that Jones has ten coins in his pocket. But if Smith had known the truth that Jones will \"not\" get the job, that would have defeated the justification for his belief.) However, many critics (such as Marshall Swain [1974]) have argued that the notion of a \"defeater\" fact cannot be made precise enough to rule out the Gettier cases without also ruling out \"a priori\" cases of knowledge .\n\nPragmatism was developed as a philosophical doctrine by C.S.Peirce and William James (1842–1910). In Peirce's view, the truth is nominally defined as a sign's correspondence to its object and pragmatically defined as the ideal final opinion to which sufficient investigation \"would\" lead sooner or later. James' epistemological model of truth was that which \"works\" in the way of belief, and a belief was true if in the long run it \"worked\" for all of us, and guided us expeditiously through our semihospitable world.\nPeirce argued that metaphysics could be cleaned up by a pragmatic approach.\nConsider what effects that might \"conceivably\" have practical bearings you \"conceive\" the objects of your \"conception\" to have. Then, your \"conception\" of those effects is the whole of your \"conception\" of the object.\nFrom a pragmatic viewpoint of the kind often ascribed to James, defining on a particular occasion whether a particular belief can rightly be said to be both true and justified is seen as no more than an exercise in pedantry, but being able to discern whether that belief led to fruitful outcomes is a fruitful enterprise. Peirce emphasized fallibilism, considered the assertion of absolute certainty a barrier to inquiry, and in 1901 defined truth as follows: \"Truth is that concordance of an abstract statement with the ideal limit towards which endless investigation would tend to bring scientific belief, which concordance the abstract statement may possess by virtue of the confession of its inaccuracy and one-sidedness, and this confession is an essential ingredient of truth.\" In other words, any unqualified assertion is likely to be at least a little wrong or, if right, still right for not entirely the right reasons. Therefore one is more veracious by being Socratic, including a recognition of one's own ignorance and knowing one may be proved wrong. This is the case, even though in practical matters one sometimes must act, if one is to act at all, with decision and complete confidence.\n\nThe difficulties involved in producing a viable fourth condition have led to claims that attempting to repair the JTB account is a deficient strategy. For example, one might argue that what the Gettier problem shows is not the need for a fourth independent condition in addition to the original three, but rather that the attempt to build up an account of knowledging by conjoining a set of independent conditions was misguided from the outset. Those who have adopted this approach generally argue that epistemological terms like justification, evidence, certainty, etc. should be analyzed in terms of a primitive notion of \"knowledge,\" rather than vice versa. Knowledge is understood as \"factive,\" that is, as embodying a sort of epistemological \"tie\" between a truth and a belief. The JTB account is then criticized for trying to get and encapsulate the factivity of knowledge \"on the cheap,\" as it were, or via a circular argument, by replacing an irreducible notion of factivity with the conjunction of some of the properties that accompany it (in particular, truth and justification). Of course, the introduction of irreducible primitives into a philosophical theory is always problematical (some would say a sign of desperation), and such anti-reductionist accounts are unlikely to please those who have other reasons to hold fast to the method behind JTB+G accounts.\n\nFred Dretske (1971) developed an account of knowledge which he called \"conclusive reasons\", revived by Robert Nozick as what he called the \"subjunctive\" or truth-tracking account (1981). Nozick's formulation posits that proposition P is an instance of knowledge when:\n\n\nNozick's definition is intended to preserve Goldman's intuition that Gettier cases should be ruled out by disacknowledging \"accidentally\" true justified beliefs, but without risking the potentially onerous consequences of building a causal requirement into the analysis. This tactic though, invites the riposte that Nozick's account merely hides the problem and does not solve it, for it leaves open the question of \"why\" Smith would not have had his belief if it had been false. The most promising answer seems to be that it is because Smith's belief was \"caused\" by the truth of what he believes; but that puts us back in the causalist camp.\n\nCriticisms and counter examples (notably the \"Grandma case\") prompted a revision, which resulted in the alteration of (3) and (4) to limit themselves to the same method (i.e. vision):\n\n\nSaul Kripke has pointed out that this view remains problematic and uses a counterexample called the \"Fake Barn Country example\", which describes a certain locality containing a number of fake barns or facades of barns. In the midst of these fake barns is one real barn, which is painted red. There is one more piece of crucial information for this example: the fake barns cannot be painted red.\n\nJones is driving along the highway, looks up and happens to see the real barn, and so forms the belief\n\n\nThough Jones has gotten lucky, he could have just as easily been deceived and not have known it. Therefore it doesn't fulfill premise 4, for if Jones saw a fake barn he wouldn't have any idea it was a fake barn. So this is not knowledge.\n\nAn alternate example is if Jones looks up and forms the belief\n\n\nAccording to Nozick's view this fulfills all four premises. Therefore this is knowledge, since Jones couldn't have been wrong, since the fake barns cannot be painted red. This is a troubling account however, since it seems the first statement \"I see a barn\" can be inferred from \"I see a red barn\"; however by Nozick's view the first belief is \"not\" knowledge and the second is knowledge.\n\nIn the first chapter of his book \"Pyrronian Reflexions on Truth and Justification\", Robert Fogelin gives a diagnosis that leads to a dialogical solution to Gettier's problem. The problem always arises when the given justification has nothing to do with what really makes the proposition true. Now, he notes that in such cases there is always a mismatch between the information disponible to the person who makes the knowledge-claim of some proposition p and the information disponible to the evaluator of this knowledge-claim (even if the evaluator is the same person in a later time). A Gettierian counterexample arises when the justification given by the person who makes the knowledge-claim cannot be accepted by the knowledge evaluator because it does not fit with his wider informational setting. For instance, in the case of the fake barn the evaluator knows that a superficial inspection from someone who does not know the peculiar circumstances involved isn't a justification aceptable as making the proposition p (that it is a real barn) true..\nRichard Kirkham has proposed that it is best to start with a definition of knowledge so strong that giving a counterexample to it is logically impossible. Whether it can be weakened without becoming subject to a counterexample should then be checked. He concludes that there will always be a counterexample to any definition of knowledge in which the believer's evidence does not logically necessitate the belief. Since in most cases the believer's evidence does not necessitate a belief, Kirkham embraces skepticism about knowledge. He notes that a belief can still be rational even if it is not an item of knowledge. (see also: fallibilism)\n\nOne might respond to Gettier by finding a way to avoid his conclusion(s) in the first place. However, it can hardly be argued that knowledge is justified true belief if there are cases that are justified true belief without being knowledge; thus, those who want to avoid Gettier's conclusions have to find some way to defuse Gettier's counterexamples. In order to do so, within the parameters of the particular counter-example or exemplar, they must then either accept that\n\n\nor, demonstrate a case in which it is possible to circumvent surrender to the exemplar by eliminating any necessity for it to be considered that JTB apply in just those areas that Gettier has rendered obscure, without thereby lessening the force of JTB to apply in those cases where it actually is crucial.\nThen, though Gettier's cases \"stipulate\" that Smith has a certain belief and that his belief is true, it seems that in order to propose (1), one must argue that Gettier, (or, that is, the writer responsible for the particular form of words on this present occasion known as case (1), and who makes assertion's about Smith's \"putative\" beliefs), goes wrong because he has the wrong notion of \"justification.\" Such an argument often depends on an externalist account on which \"justification\" is understood in such a way that whether or not a belief is \"justified\" depends not just on the internal state of the believer, but also on how that internal state is related to the outside world. Externalist accounts typically are constructed such that Smith's putative beliefs in Case I and Case II are not really justified (even though it seems to Smith that they are), because his beliefs are not lined up with the world in the right way, or that it is possible to show that it is invalid to assert that \"Smith\" has any significant \"particular\" belief at all, in terms of JTB or otherwise. Such accounts, of course, face the same burden as causalist responses to Gettier: they have to explain what sort of relationship between the world and the believer counts as a justificatory relationship.\n\nThose who accept (2) are by far in the minority in analytic philosophy; generally those who are willing to accept it are those who have independent reasons to say that more things count as knowledge than the intuitions that led to the JTB account would acknowledge. Chief among these are epistemic minimalists such as Crispin Sartwell, who hold that all true belief, including both Gettier's cases and lucky guesses, counts as knowledge.\n\nSome early work in the field of experimental philosophy suggested that traditional intuitions about Gettier cases might vary cross-culturally. However, subsequent studies have consistently failed to replicate these results, instead finding that participants from different cultures do share the traditional intuition. Indeed, more recent studies have actually been providing evidence for the opposite hypothesis, that people from a variety of different cultures have surprisingly similar intuitions in these cases.\n\n"}

{"id": "306326", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=306326", "title": "Ignorance", "text": "Ignorance\n\nIgnorance is a lack of knowledge. The word ignorant is an adjective that describes a person in the state of being unaware, and can describe individuals who deliberately ignore or disregard important information or facts, or individuals who are unaware of important information or facts. Ignorance can appear in three different types: factual ignorance (absence of knowledge of some fact), objectual ignorance (unacquaintance with some object), and technical ignorance (absence of knowledge of how to do something).\n\nPeople do not experience instant gratification and therefore they do not invest time and effort in learning and developing. Eradicating ignorance completely from an individual’s life is an impossible task but reducing the gap can truly benefit the individual in a long term.\n\nAlso, making the decision to remain ignorant by committing to an ideology despite scientific proof is a dangerous mindset that can inhibit an individual from discovering the truth and therefore developing as an individual.\n\nIgnorance can stifle learning, especially if the ignorant person believes it is not ignorant. A person who falsely believes it is knowledgeable, does not try to clarify its beliefs, but rather relies on the ignorant position. It may also reject valid but contrary information, neither realizing its importance nor understanding it. This concept is elucidated in Justin Kruger and David Dunning's work, \"Unskilled and Unaware of It: How Difficulties in Recognizing One's Own Incompetence Lead to Inflated Self-Assessments\", otherwise known as the Dunning–Kruger effect.\n\nAnother reason why people are not able to obtain knowledge is inaccessibility to education. In some parts of the world, educational infrastructure is insufficient and therefore people are not able to seek for knowledge. The phenomenon can be observed widely in underdeveloped countries where many children either cannot afford to go to school or live too far from a school. On the other hand, in developed countries most children have access to a K12 education but once they graduate high school they encounter obstacles to pursue a higher education due to high costs. This lack of education can contribute to individuals not being able to practice critical thinking and seek for knowledge for themselves.\n\nRemaining in a state of ignorance can lead to serious economic downfalls, relationship crises, legal issues, and more. It is important for human survival to be knowledgeable on different topics. For example, one must be aware of ways to prevent certain diseases, avoid certain poisonous foods, avoid war, etc..\n\nIndividuals who are financially literate can manage finances wisely and therefore create a more stable life for themselves and their families. People who understand finance and economics can vote better on local and national economic regulations that benefit the whole society.\n\nAnother important aspect is ignorance in the legal field. People must be aware of laws so they can live free and in harmony with others. Ignorance of the law is not accepted as a legal defense, so it is the responsibility of the individual to know the law. Willingly ignoring the law can lead to arrest or isolated living.\n\nIgnorance can have a negative effects on individuals and societies, but can also benefit them by creating within them the desire to know more. For example, ignorance within science opens the opportunity to seek knowledge and make discoveries by asking new questions. This though can only take place if the individual possesses a curious mind.\n\nStudies suggest that adults with an adequate education who perform enriching and challenging jobs are happier, and more in control of their environment. The confidence that adults obtain through the sense of control that education provides allows those adults to go for more leadership positions and seek for power throughout their lives.\n\nThe writer, Thomas Pynchon, articulated the following about the scope and structure of one's ignorance: \"Ignorance is not just a blank space on a person's mental map. It has contours and coherence, and for all I know rules of operation as well. So as a corollary to [the advice of] writing about what we know, maybe we should add getting familiar with our ignorance, and the possibilities therein for writing a good story.\".\n\n\n\n"}

Conant\n\nJames Ferguson Conant (born June 10, 1958) is an American philosopher who has written extensively on topics in philosophy of language, ethics, and metaphilosophy. He is perhaps best known for his writings on Wittgenstein, and his association with the New Wittgenstein school of Wittgenstein interpretation initiated by Cora Diamond. He is currently Chester D. Tripp Professor of Humanities, Professor of Philosophy, and Professor in the College at the University of Chicago as well as director of the Chicago Center for German Philosophy (CCGP), he is Humboldt Professor of Philosophy and co-director of the Center for Analytic German Idealism (FAGI) at the University of Leipzig.\n\nConant was born in Kyoto, Japan to American parents. He is the grandson of former Harvard University president James Bryant Conant. At 14, he attended Phillips Exeter Academy. He received his A.B. in Philosophy and History of Science from Harvard College in 1982, and his Ph.D. in Philosophy from Harvard University in 1990. He joined the philosophy faculty at the University of Pittsburgh from 1990-1999, and then became Professor of Philosophy at the University of Chicago. In December, 2012, he became co-director of the Center for Analytic German Idealism at Leipzig University, and in July, 2017 he was appointed Humboldt Professor of Philosophy at Leipzig University.\n\nSince the mid 1990s Conant, together with Cora Diamond has advanced a “resolute reading” of Wittgenstein's early work which seeks to expose neglected underlying continuities between the philosopher's early and later approaches to philosophy, especially between his early \"Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus\" and his later \"Philosophical Investigations\". This resolute reading is meant to show that even in the \"Tractatus\", the purpose of philosophy is the clarification of philosophical problems, aimed at the elucidation of the sentences of the language through which we express ourselves rather than at propounding philosophical theses. This reading subjects the traditional interpretations of Wittgenstein, particularly that of Peter Hacker and Gordon Baker, to severe criticism. Hacker, as well as others like Ian Proops and Michael Forster have in turn criticized Conant's representation of them.\n\nConant has contributed to other areas in the history of analytic philosophy, writing particularly about the work of Gottlob Frege, of Rudolf Carnap, as well as about the relation between the views of both of these figures and those of Wittgenstein. A related theme running throughout Conant's work is the relation between the ideas of Immanuel Kant, and the Kantian tradition more broadly, and the analytic tradition. \n\nAlthough his philosophical orientation is largely that of someone trained in the analytic tradition, Conant has also written a series of essays on various so-called “Continental\" Philosophers, most notably on Kierkegaard and on Nietzsche. In his readings of specific texts by Kierkegaard, Nietzsche and Wittgenstein, he explores the theme of how the literary form of a philosophical text is intertwined with its philosophical content. Relatedly, Conant has written a number of essays exploring the treatment of philosophical ideas in literary texts, ranging from the short stories of Franz Kafka to the novels of George Orwell. \n\nA recurring topic throughout Conant’s work is that of philosophical skepticism. In this connection, he has drawn a distinction between two varieties of skepticism, which he calls “Cartesian skepticism” and “Kantian skepticism” respectively.\n\nAnother major research area of Conant’s is the history of analytic philosophy. In 2017, together with Jay Elliott, he brought out a comprehensive volume in the Norton Anthologies series, titled \"After Kant: The Analytic Tradition\", covering the entire range of the analytic tradition in philosophy from its beginnings to the present.\n\nIn 2016, Conant was one of three academics from abroad selected to receive Germany’s top international research award, the Alexander von Humboldt Professorship Research Prize.\n\nIn 2012 James Conant received the Humboldt Foundation Anneliese Maier Research Award, a five-year award to promote the internationalisation of the humanities and social sciences in Germany.\nIn summer 2011, the Institute of Philosophy of the University of Porto in Portugal hosted a conference titled \"The Logical Alien at 20\", dedicated to the 20th anniversary of the publication of James Conant's paper \"The Search for Logically Alien Thought\".\n\n\n\n"}

He wrote plays, social criticism, and histories of the ancient Russian social order.

Aksakov also penned a number of articles on Slavonic linguistics.\n\nAksakov was born into a family of prominent Russian writer Sergey Timofeevich Aksakov (1791—1859) and his wife Olga Semyonovna Zaplatina (1793—1878). His paternal grandfather Timofey Stepanovich Aksakov belonged to an old noble Aksakov family whose members claimed to be the decedents of Šimon. Their first documented ancestor was Ivan Feodorivich Velyaminov nicknamed Oksak who lived during the 15th century. His family crest was based on the Polish Przyjaciel coat of arms (also known as Aksak) which is considered to be of Tatar origin in Poland (the word «oksak» means «lame» in Turkic languages). All this led some researches to believe that the Aksakov family also originated from Tatars, despite they had no relation to the Polish noble house.

{"id": "3167871", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3167871", "title": "Labor theory of property", "text": "Labor theory of property\n\nThe labor theory of property (also called the labor theory of appropriation, labor theory of ownership, labor theory of entitlement, or principle of first appropriation) is a theory of natural law that holds that property originally comes about by the exertion of labor upon natural resources. The theory has been used to justify the homestead principle, which holds that one may gain whole permanent ownership of an unowned natural resource by performing an act of original appropriation.\n\nIn his \"Second Treatise on Government\", the philosopher John Locke asked by what right an individual can claim to own one part of the world, when, according to the Bible, God gave the world to all humanity in common. He answered that persons own themselves and therefore their own labor. When a person works, that labor enters into the object. Thus, the object becomes the property of that person.\n\nHowever, Locke held that one may only appropriate property in this fashion if the Lockean proviso held true, that is, \"... there is enough, and as good, left in common for others\".\n\nLocke argued in support of individual property rights as natural rights. Following the argument the fruits of one's labor are one's own because one worked for it. Furthermore, the laborer must also hold a natural property right in the resource itself because — as Locke believes — exclusive ownership was immediately necessary for production.\n\nJean-Jacques Rousseau later criticized this second step in Discourse on Inequality, where he effectively argues that the natural right argument does not extend to resources that one did not create. Both philosophers hold that the relation between labor and ownership pertains only to property that was unowned before such labor took place.\n\nLand in its original state would be considered unowned by anyone, but if an individual applied his labor to the land by farming it, for example, it becomes his property. Merely placing a fence around land rather than using the land enclosed would not bring property into being according to most natural law theorists.\n\nFor example, economist Murray Rothbard stated (in \"Man, Economy, and State\"):\nThe labor theory of property does not only apply to land itself, but to any application of labor to nature. For example, natural-rightist Lysander Spooner, says that an apple taken from an unowned tree would become the property of the person who plucked it, as he has labored to acquire it. He says the \"only way, in which [\"the wealth of nature\"] can be made useful to mankind, is by their taking possession of it individually, and thus making it private property.\"\n\nHowever, some, such as Benjamin Tucker have not seen this as creating property in all things. Tucker argued that \"in the case of land, or of any other material the supply of which is so limited that all cannot hold it in unlimited quantities,\" these should only be considered owned while the individual is in the act of using or occupying these things. This is a rejection of Absentee ownership for land.\n\nLocke held that individuals have a exclusive right to homestead private property from nature by working on it, but that they can do so only \"...at least where there is enough, and as good, left in common for others\". The proviso maintains that appropriation of unowned resources is a diminution of the rights of others to it, and would be acceptable only so long as it does not make anyone worse off than they would have been before. The phrase \"Lockean Proviso\" was coined by political philosopher Robert Nozick, and is based on the ideas elaborated by John Locke in his Second Treatise of Government.\n\nAside from critiques of natural rights as a whole, Locke's labor theory of property has been singled out for critique by modern academics who doubt the idea that mixing something owned with something unowned could imbue the object with ownership:\n\nJeremy Waldron believes that Locke has made a category mistake, as only objects can be mixed with other objects and laboring is not an object, but an activity.\n\nJudith Jarvis Thomson points out that the act of laboring makes Locke's argument either an appeal to desert, in which case the reward is arbitrary \"Why not instead a medal and a handshake from the president?\", or little different than first possession theories that existed before Locke.\n\nA fundamental criticism of Locke's labor theory of property is that it, in practice, values a particular type of labor and land use (i.e.: agriculture) over all others. It thus does not recognise usage of land, for example, by hunter-gatherer societies as granting rights to ownership. In essence, the Lockean proviso depends on \"the existence of a frontier, beyond which lies boundless usable land. This in turn requires the erasure (mentally and usually in brutal reality) of the people already living beyond the frontier and drawing their sustenance from the land in question.\" Locke's theories of property rights are often interpreted in the context of his support for chattel slavery of \"prisoners captured in war\" as a philosophical justification for the enslavement and genocides committed by early American colonists.\n\n"}

In terms of pastoral care, it suggests that \"it is often better to encourage the positive elements in someone's life rather than to chastise their flaws\". It is \"as old as Christianity itself\", being referred to in several New Testament passages.\n\nIt is distinct from \"gradualness of the law\", an idea that would tend to diminish the demands of the law. It does not mean \"that we compromise on the content of the law\" but that we recognize our failings and strive to correspond to its demands over time.\n\nThe law of graduality recognizes that the lives and relationships of people with morally unacceptable lifestyles may have some elements of good, even of great good, such as sacrificial love and consistent respect. It recognizes that virtues are not all-or-nothing propositions, and that elements of good may be found even in the context of morally unacceptable situations.\n\nGradualism recognizes elements of good in what on the whole is blameworthy, so as to encourage steps towards greater perfection, instead of simply chastising people for their mistakes. In this sense, gradualism is recognition that even in matters of grave evil there can be gradations of objective depravity, although the grave evil does not cease to be a grave evil.\n\nIn a Christian sense, conversion does not happen once and is over. It is \"a fundamental change in one's direction — a new path or way of life in which one must learn to walk.\" In his apostolic exhortation \"Familiaris consortio\" of 1981, Pope John Paul II declared: \"What is needed is a continuous, permanent conversion\" that \"is brought about concretely in steps which lead us ever forward. Thus a dynamic process develops, one which advances gradually.\" He added that man \"day by day builds himself up through his many free decisions; and so he knows, loves and accomplishes moral good by stages of growth.”\n\nIn effect, he said that the Christian life can always be attained through God's grace, and our striving for it becomes easier according as we put it into practice. What Pope John Paul called the law of gradualness in human behavior is the step-by-step perfecting of the person in that person's practice of the Christian life.\n\nWriting on \"L'Osservatore Romano\" about the 1986 letter of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith on the pastoral care of homosexual persons, Bartholomew Kiely stated: \"The 'law of gradualness' implies that when there exists a genuine (unfeigned) weakness in following a moral norm, the person is obliged to 'endeavour to place [or establish] the conditions for its observance' (\"Familiaris consortio\", 34, par. 4). In other words, a person must be protected from discouragement even if the journey towards a life of Christian chastity involves special difficulties and is accompanied by repeated failures.\"\n\nMuch more controversial has been the use that some theologians have made of the concept as grounds for a permissive attitude to moral norms, treating them merely as ideals. Some have invoked this understanding on matters such as the Catholic Church's ban on artificial contraception, or cohabitating couples. This \"lower[ing] the bar\" of Church teachings that are deemed to be too difficult has been denigrated as moral relativism. Some believed this interpretation seemed to be mentioned in an interim discussion document presented at the Third Extraordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops in October 2014, but it was excluded from the Synod's final report.\n\nPope John Paul II cautioned that \"what is known as 'the law of gradualness' cannot be identified with 'gradualness of the law'\". And in guidelines for confessors in 1997, the Pontifical Council for the Family stated that they should not be led by the law of gradualness to give people the impression that repentance does not require a decisive break with sin.\n\nWhile the Catholic Church opposes the use of artificial contraceptives, Pope Benedict XVI said that, when a prostitute uses a condom to help stop the spread of AIDS, it could be \"a first step in a movement toward a different way, a more human way, of living sexuality.\" This could be, the pope said, \"a first assumption of responsibility, on the way toward recovering an awareness that not everything is allowed and that one cannot do whatever one wants.\" The concern for others thus suggested is laudable, but it does not mean that either prostitution or condoms are in themselves good.\n\nIn the concept of \"the law of gradualness\", Bartholomew Kiely wrote, those who are genuinely unable to observe the norm are nonetheless obliged to try, as Pope Paul said, \"to place the conditions for its observance\". They are always free to attempt, even if they lack the freedom to succeed. On the contrary, in the concept of \"gradualness of the law\", they would be under no obligation even to make an attempt.\n\nWhat Pope John Paul said is that the moral teachings are always binding (no \"gradualness of the law\"), and practice makes them easier to observe (\"the law of gradualness\").\n"}

He was elected Minister General of the Order.\n\nBorn in Acquasparta, Umbria, he was a member of the Bentivenghi family, to which belonged his fellow Franciscan, Cardinal Bentivenga de' Bentivenghi, bishop of Albano (died 1290). Matthew entered the Franciscan Order at Todi, took the degree of Master of Theology at Paris, and taught also for a time at Bologna.\n\nFriar John Peckham having become Archbishop of Canterbury in 1279, Matteo was in 1280 made Peckham's successor as \"Lector sacri Palatii apostolici\", i.e. he was appointed reader (teacher) of theology to the papal Curia. In 1287 the General Chapter of the Order held at Montpellier elected him Minister General in succession to Arlotto of Prato.\n\nWhen Girolamo Masci of Ascoli, who had previously been Minister General of the Franciscan Order, became pope as Nicholas IV, 15 February 1288, he created Matthew cardinal with the \"titulus\" of San Lorenzo in Damaso that May. After this Matteo was made Cardinal Bishop of Porto, and \"penitentiarius major\" (Grand Penitentiary). He still, however, retained the direction of the Order until the chapter of 1289. Matthew had summoned this chapter to meet at Assisi, but Nicholas IV caused it to be held in his presence at Rieti; here Raymond Gaufredi, a native of Provence, was elected Minister General.\n\nAs Minister General of the Order, Matthew maintained a moderate, middle course; among other things he reorganized the studies pursued in the order. In the quarrel between Pope Boniface VIII and the Colonna family, from 1297 onwards, he strongly supported the pope, both in official memorials and in public sermons. Pope Boniface appointed him, both in 1297 and 1300, to important embassies to Lombardy, the Romagna, and to Guelph Florence, where the Neri and Bianchi Guelph factions were violently at issue with each other.\n\nIn 1301 Matthew returned to Florence, following Charles of Valois, but neither peace nor reconciliation was brought about. The Blacks finally obtained the upper hand, and the chief Whites were obliged to go into exile; among these was the poet Dante. In a famous passage of the \"Divina Commedia\" (Paradiso, XII, 124-26), Dante certainly speaks as a partisan of the Bianchi against Matthew of Aquasparta, calling Cardinal Matthew a sodomite. Matthew, however, had died before this, on 28 October, 1302. He was buried in Rome, in the Franciscan church of Santa Maria in Aracoeli, where his monument is still to be seen.\n\nMatteo was a learned philosopher and theologian and a personal pupil of St. Bonaventure, whose teaching, in general, he followed, or rather developed. In this respect he was one of what is known as the older Franciscan school, who preferred Augustinianism to the more pronounced Aristoteleanism of Thomas Aquinas.\n\nHis principal work is the acute \"Quæstiones disputatæ\", which treats of various subjects. Of this one book appeared at Quaracchi in 1903, namely: \"Quæstiones disputatæ selectæ\", in \"Bibliotheca Franciscana scholastica medii ævi\", I; the \"Quæstiones\" are preceded by a \"Tractatus de excellentia S. Scripturæ\" (pp. 1–22), also by a \"Sermo de studio S. Scripturæ\" (pp. 22–36); it is followed by \"De processione Spiritus Sancti\" (pp. 429–53). Five \"Quæstiones de Cognitione\" had already been edited in the collection called \"De humanæ cognitionis ratione anecdota quædam\" (Quaracchi, 1883), 87-182.\n\nThe rest of his works, still unedited, are to be found at Assisi and Todi. Among them are: \"Commentarius in 4 libros Sententiarum\" (autograph); \"Concordantiæ super 4 ll. Sententiarum\"; \"Postilla super librum Job\"; \"Postilla super Psalterium\" (autograph); \"In 12 Prophetas Minores\"; \"In Danielem\"; \"In Ev.

He urged the conversion of the cathedral of Cologne into a free church. Although no obstinate adherent of antiquated forms and prejudices, he firmly upheld the fundamental truths of Christianity.\n\nCarrière died in Munich on 19 January 1895.\n\n\nHe translated the letters of Abélard and Héloise into German, and composed a poem on the last night of the Girondists.

He was at times attributed with being capable of almost miraculous or mythical deeds in his designated capacity as a close friend and principal advisor of Lê Lợi, Vietnam's hero-emperor, who fought to free the country from Chinese rule. He is credited with writing the important political statements of Lê Lợi and inspiring the Vietnamese populace to support open rebellion against the Ming Dynasty rulers. He is also the author of \"Great Proclamation upon the Pacification of the Wu\" (Bình Ngô đại cáo).\n\nNguyễn Trãi originally was from Hải Dương Province, he was born in 1380 in Thăng Long (present day Hanoi), the capital of the declining Trần Dynasty. Under the brief Hồ Dynasty, he passed examination and served for a time in the government. In 1406, Ming force invaded and conquered Vietnam. Under the occupation, the Ming China attempted to convert Vietnam into a Chinese province and ruthlessly quashed all rebellions.\nIn 1417, Nguyễn Trãi joined a rebel leader named Lê Lợi, who was resisting the occupation from a mountainous region in Thanh Hóa Province south of Hanoi. Nguyễn Trãi served as the chief advisor, strategist and propagandist for the movement.\n\nThe war of independence leading to the defeat of the Ming and the inauguration of the Lê Dynasty lasted from 1417 to 1427. From 1417 until 1423, Lê Lợi conducted a classic guerilla campaign from his bases in the mountains. Following a negotiated truce, Lê Lợi, following the advice of Nguyễn Chích, led his army to the southern prefecture of Nghệ An. From Nghệ An, Vietnamese forces won many battles and gained control over the whole part of Vietnam from Thanh Hóa southwards. The Ming sent a series of military reinforcements in response to bolster their positions. In 1426, the army of a Chinese general named Wang Tong arrived in the Red River Delta. However, Vietnamese forces were able to cut supply lines and control the countryside, leaving Chinese presence totally isolated in the capital and other citadels. During this period, Nguyễn Trãi sought to undermine the resolve of the enemy and to negotiate a favorable peace by sending a series of missives to the Ming commanders. In 1427 the Ming emperor Xuande sent two large reinforcing armies to Vietnam. Lê Lợi moved his forces to the frontier, where they confronted and utterly defeated Chinese reinforcements in a series of bloody battles, most notably the battle of Chi Lăng-Xương Giang. Wang Tong sued for peace. The numerous Chinese prisoners of war were all given provisions and allowed to return to China. Nguyễn Trãi penned a famous proclamation of victory.\n\nAfter the war Nguyễn Trãi was elevated by Lê Lợi to an exalted position in the new court but internal intrigues, sycophantic machinations and clannish nepotism meant he was not appointed regent upon the emperor's death. Instead that position was bestowed upon Lê Sát, who ruled as regent on behalf of the young heir Lê Thái Tông.\n\nAt some point during the regency of Lê Sát, having found life at court increasingly difficult, Nguyễn Trãi retired to his country home north of Hanoi in the tranquil mountains of Chí Linh, where he enjoyed poetry writing and meditation. Today, visitors can visit this site where a large shrine of remembrance, covering from the foot of the mountain to the top is erected to honour the national hero. The site of Nguyễn Trãi's house still exists, however only the tiled floors remain original. Close by is an ancient Buddhist temple, which has stood there several centuries before his time.\n\nNguyễn Trãi's death resulted from a scandal involving the young emperor, Lê Thái Tông, and the wife or concubine of Nguyễn Trãi, named Nguyễn Thị Lộ. Early in 1442, the young emperor began an affair with Nguyễn Thị Lộ. This affair continued when the emperor visited the old scholar at his home. Not long after having left, Lê Thái Tông suddenly became ill and died. The nobles at the court blamed Nguyễn Trãi and Nguyễn Thị Lộ for the young emperor's death, accused them of regicide and had both, along with most members of their extended families, executed.\n\nTwenty years later, Lê Thái Tông's son, emperor Lê Thánh Tông officially pardoned Nguyễn Trãi, saying that he was wholly innocent in the death of Thánh Tông's father.\n\nAccording to Loren Baritz (\"Backfire: A History of How American Culture Led Us Into Vietnam and Made Us Fight the Way We Did\", 1985), Trai set down the Vietnamese strategy against the Chinese in an essay. This essay would prove to be very close to the Communists' strategy of insurgency. Specifically you must, \"subordinate military action to the political and moral struggle...better to conquer hearts than citadels.\"\n\nMost cities in Vietnam have named major streets after him.\n\nNguyễn Trãi had 5 wives (or concubines) and 7 sons. \n\nWive/Concubines: \n\n• Lady Phạm Đỗ Minh Hiển\n\n• Lady Phùng Thị\n\n• Lady Nguyễn Thị Lộ\n\n• Lady Phạm Thị Mẫn \n\n• Lady Trần Anh Minh\n\nSons:\n\n• Nguyễn Khuê (Lady Trần's)\n\n• Nguyễn Ứng (Lady Trần's)\n\n• Nguyễn Phù (Lady Trần's)\n\n• Nguyễn Bảng (Lady Phùng's)\n\n• Nguyễn Tích (Lady Phùng's)\n\n• Nguyễn Anh Vũ (Lady Phạm's)\n\n• Forefather of a Nguyễn family's branch in Quế Lĩnh, Phương Quất, Kinh Môn District, Hải Dương Province. (Lady Lê's)\n\nBeing both a military tactician and a poet, Nguyễn Trãi's works varied in many areas ranging from literature, history, geography, ceremony and propriety; many of them were missing after his execution. Most of his poems that survive until today were collected in \"Ức Trai Thi Tập\" (Ức Trai's Poems Collection) by Dương Bá Cung, printed in 1868 under Nguyễn Dynasty. His poems, written in both ancient Chinese (Hán) and Vietnamese (Nôm), were highly regarded by notable philosophers, poets, and politicians in Vietnamese history. \n\nIn 2010, Vietnamese poet Nguyễn Đỗ and American poet Paul Hoover published the first collection of Nguyễn Trãi's poetry in English translation, titled \"Beyond the Court Gate: Selected Poems\". The collection reflects Nguyễn Trãi's metaphysical contemplation of tiny details in everyday life, but at the same time set him apart from Li Po's uses of extreme imaginary and formal poetic rules. Nguyễn Trãi's poems demonstrate wit, humility, and a conversational tone, and express his personal perception and experience. \n\nAn example of Nguyễn Trãi's writing is his poem \"To a Friend\" (Traditional Chinese: 記友, Sino-Vietnamese: \"Kí Hữu\", Vietnamese: \"Gửi Bạn\"), as translated and edited by Nguyễn Đỗ and Paul Hoover: \n記友\n\n半生世路嘆屯邅， \n\n萬事惟應付老天。 \n\n寸舌但存空自信， \n\n一寒如故亦堪憐。 \n\n光陰焂忽時難再， \n\n客舍凄涼夜似年。 \n\n十載讀書貧到骨， \n\n盤惟苜蓿坐無氈。\nTo a Friend\n\"My fate naturally has many twists and sharp turns,\"\n\n\"So in everything I trust in the wisdom of Heaven.\"\n\n\"I still have my tongue—believe me, I am able to talk,\"\n\n\"Even though I’m still poor and, as we know, pathetic.\"\n\n\"Never to return, the past flies too quickly and the time is short,\"\n\n\"But, wandering in this cold room, the night is far too long.\"\n\n\"I’ve been reading books for ten years, but I’m poor from clothes to bone\"\n\n\"From eating only vegetables and sitting without a cushion.\"\n\n"}

The work was republished by Columbia University Press in 1941, but failed to attract much attention. In 1955, the Liberal Arts Press intended to republish it in a volume also containing \"On Liberty\", but decided against doing so in view of the doubts surrounding its authorship raised by the Mill scholar J.C. Rees. He then set out the full case against attributing the work to Mill in his 1956 work \"Mill and His Early Critics\".\n\nRees's explanation for how the manuscript ended up among Mill's possessions is summarised by J.P. Scanlan:\n\nIn September, 1862, Mill wrote a letter from Avignon to a certain E.R. Edger, acknowledging receipt of a manuscript entitled \"Social Freedom.\" Apparently Edger hoped to elicit from Mill an appraisal of his capacity for philosophical inquiry, and had sent the manuscript as a sample of his work. Mill replies politely and with his usual care that he finds many signs of competence in the work - mostly, however, in the form of \"promise rather than performance\" - and he exhorts Edger to continue thinking and writing, though not \"to the neglect of other modes of gaining a subsistence.\" Concerining Edger's views Mill says only that, if he were to comment in detail, he \"should have much to say against several of your positions, and especially against your definition of liberty.\"\n\nThe letter is included in Mill's \"Collected Works\" where Edger is identified as \"probably Ebenezer R. Edger, associate of G.J. Holyoake in the promoting of the co-operative movement, writer for \"The Secular World\" and author of tracts on co-operation.\" Holyoake briefly mentions Edger in \"The History of Co-operation\":\n\n\"Ten years later my colleague, Mr E. R. Edger, visited Mr. Crisell, the manager of the farm whom the Rev. Mr. Robinson had found to be \"manly, open, and ingenious appearance,\" beyond what he expected of one belonging to the \"depressed\" class. Mr. Edger sent me this report:-\n\n\"I paid a visit to Assington, and had a conversation with the manager, Mr. Crisell (pronounced with i long, 'Cry-sell'). I can feel no enthusiasm at all about the Assington Farm. There seems no 'co-operation' in the right sense of the term, but only \"bounty\" of the squire towards poor neighbours.\n\n(1) It is limited to inhabitants of the parish.\n(2) Each member can hold only one share.\n(3) Members have no voice in the management.\n(4) Wages to workmen same as usual.\n(5) No special inducement offered to the workmen to become shareholders. The manager remarked that they did not care particularly to employ the members; this seems to me very significant.\nIt has been in existence forty-one years, so it will take a long time to renovate society that way. Remember, I only give my impressions.\"\nAn E.R. Edger is also listed in The British Medical Journal on the 24th of April 1869 as having passed a primary examination in anatomy and physiology at the Royal College of Surgeons of England.\n\n"}

He co-edited “Managing Sensitive Projects” published by Macmillan in the UK and Routledge in the US in 1998.\nIn \"The Strength of Becoming: a philosophical treatise on the new art & science of living\", Pascal Etcheber argues that there is a positive outlook in Existentialism through creating. Since only individuals can bring meaning into the world “Creativism” allows individuals to both find themselves and fulfillment.\nHis Philosophy is further outlined in “Vagabond Earth” (published by Substance Publishing in 2004). He purports that Human beings are driven by three essential needs: Freedom, Actions and Ethics, that the world is organized with Religions, Economics and Politics to apparently fulfill those needs. However, human beings can never find fulfillment because Freedom is lost by the obedience to laws; Actions are made useless by the belief that this world is meaningless compared to a higher, spiritual world or afterlife; Ethics is never attained because participation in economics does not lead into abundance for all but the success of a few to the detriment of the majority. “Vagabond Earth” proposes a blue print for a moneyless society of one world with no governments with people actively engaged in making this world a good place to live. In 2012, \"7 principles for an Economic Revolution\" marks a less utopian outlook and proposes new hopes for full employment and higher standards of living, even in mature economies, despite globalization.\n\nThe British Philosophical Association listed Pascal Etcheber in their success stories as one of 38 people who graduated in Philosophy and achieved success in their subsequent careers.\nHe graduated in Philosophy with a Dean's commendation from Exeter University in the UK.

He has been an active speaker notably in the nuclear world to encourage the successful development of difficult projects that are necessary.

While no human rights instrument or national constitution grants the absolute right to protest, such a right to protest may be a manifestation of the right to freedom of assembly, the right to freedom of association, and the right to freedom of speech.Additionally, protest and restrictions on protest have lasted as long as governments have.\n\nMany international treaties contain clear articulations of the right to protest and it is crucial for individuals who are interested in protesting to stay up to date and aware. Such agreements include the 1950 European Convention on Human Rights, especially Articles 9 to 11; and the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, especially Articles 18 to 22. Articles 9 enunciates the \"right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion.\" Article 10 enunciates the \"right to freedom of expression.\" Article 11 enunciates the \"right to freedom of association with others, including the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests.\" However, in these and other agreements the rights of freedom of assembly, freedom of association, and freedom of speech are subject to certain limitations. For example, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights contains prohibitions on \"propaganda of war\" and advocacy of \"national, racial or religious hatred\"; and it allows the restriction of the freedom to assembly if it is necessary \"in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public safety, public order, the protection of public health or morals or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\" (Articles 20 and 21) It is important for people interested in protest to note that different places have passed their own clarification of these rights.\n\nProtesting, however, is not necessarily violent or a threat to the interests of national security or public safety. Nor is it necessarily civil disobedience, because most protest does not involve violating the laws of the state. Also, since it is an expression of a universal right, choosing to lawfully protest is not a violation of state laws. Protests, even campaigns of nonviolent resistance or civil resistance, can often have the character (in addition to using nonviolent methods) of positively supporting a democratic and constitutional order. This can happen, for example, when such resistance arises in response to a military coup d'état; or in the somewhat similar case of a refusal of the state leadership to surrender office following defeat in an election. During points of widespread tension or controversy within a society, it is important for government institutions to recognize this right. A democracy's ability to preserve its citizen's right to protest is a result of that democracy's \"political health.\"\n\n\n"}

He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2010.\n\nSoames is a public advocate and supporter of Donald Trump.\n\nSoames specializes in the philosophy of language and the history of analytic philosophy. He has published books and articles primarily on issues concerning truth, reference, and meaning. Fairly early in his career, he and Nathan Salmon edited a book entitled \"Propositions and Attitudes\" (1989), a collection of readings that investigates philosophical issues surrounding the nature of propositions. Later in his career, Soames has been known for expanding on the anti-descriptivist philosophy of language developed by Saul Kripke in \"Naming and Necessity\" (1972/1980)—see Soames's \"Beyond Rigidity: The Unfinished Semantic Agenda of 'Naming and Necessity\"' (2002). He is also a major critic of two-dimensionalist theories of semantics—see his \"Reference and Description: The Case against Two-Dimensionalism\" (2005).\n\n\"Philosophical Analysis in the Twentieth Century\" (2003), his two-volume history of analytic philosophy developed from a lecture course regularly given at Princeton, has been the subject of significant controversy among historians of analytic philosophy, with exchanges, often heated, on the \"Notre Dame Philosophical Review\", Brian Weatherson's blog, the journal \"The Philosophical Quarterly\", and Soames's own web page.\n\nThe following are \"partial\" lists of publications by Scott Soames:\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1221192", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1221192", "title": "Sincerity", "text": "Sincerity\n\nSincerity is the virtue of one who communicates and acts in accordance with their feelings, beliefs, thoughts, and desires.\n\nThe Oxford English Dictionary and most scholars state that \"sincerity\" from \"sincere\" is derived from the Latin \"sincerus\" meaning \"clean, pure, sound\" (1525–35). \"Sincerus\" may have once meant \"one growth\" (not mixed), from \"sin-\" (one) and \"crescere\" (to grow). \"Crescere\" is cognate with \"Ceres,\" the goddess of grain, as in\n\"cereal.\"\n\nAccording to the American Heritage Dictionary, the Latin word \"sincerus\" is derived from the Indo-European root \"*sm̥kēros\", itself derived from the zero-grade of \"*sem\" (\"one\") and the suffixed, lengthened e-grade of \"*ker\" (\"grow\"), generating the underlying meaning \"of one growth\", hence \"pure, clean.\"\n\nAn often repeated folk etymology proposes that \"sincere\" is derived from the Latin \"sine\" = \"without\", \"cera\" = \"wax\". According to one popular explanation, dishonest sculptors in Rome or Greece would cover flaws in their work with wax to deceive the viewer; therefore, a sculpture \"without wax\" would mean honesty in its perfection. In its early days the word could refer to the immaterial and material. \"One spoke of sincere wine...simply to mean that it had not been adulterated, or, as was once said, sophisticated.\" Another explanation is that this etymology \"is derived from a Greeks-bearing-gifts story of deceit and betrayal. For the feat of victory, the Romans demanded the handing over of obligatory tributes. Following bad advice, the Greeks resorted to some faux-marble statues made of wax, which they offered as tribute. These promptly melted in the warm Greek sun.\"\nThe Oxford English Dictionary states, however, that \"there is no probability in the old explanation from sine cera 'without wax'\".\n\nThe popularity of the \"without wax\" etymology is reflected in its use as a minor subplot in Dan Brown's 1998 thriller novel \"Digital Fortress\", though Brown attributes it to the Spanish language, not Latin. Reference to the same etymology, this time attributed to Latin, later appears in his 2009 novel, \"The Lost Symbol\".\n\nFirst discussed by Aristotle in his \"\", it resurfaced to become an ideal (virtue) in Europe and North America in the 17th century; and it gained considerable momentum during the Romantic movement, when sincerity was first celebrated as an artistic and social ideal. Indeed, in middle to late nineteenth century America, sincerity was an idea reflected in mannerisms, hairstyles, women's dress, and the literature of the time.\n\nMore recently sincerity has been under assault by several modern developments such as psychoanalysis and postmodern developments such as deconstruction. Some scholars view sincerity as a construct rather than a moral virtue—although any virtue can be construed as a 'mere construct' rather than an actual phenomenon. Because knowledge of self is necessarily subjective, the philosopher Harry Frankfurt has argued that \"sincerity itself is bullshit\".\n\nLiterary critic Lionel Trilling dealt with the subject of sincerity, its roots, its evolution, its moral quotient, and its relationship to authenticity in a series of lectures published under the title \"Sincerity and Authenticity\".\n\nAccording to Aristotle \"truthfulness or sincerity is a desirable mean state between the deficiency of irony or self-deprecation and the excess of boastfulness.\"\n\n\"See\" The Analects\n\nBeyond the Western culture, sincerity is notably developed as a virtue in Confucian societies (China, Korea, and Japan). The concept of \"chéng\" (誠、诚) — as expounded in two of the Confucian classics, the \"Da Xue\" and the \"Zhong Yong\" — is generally translated as \"sincerity\". As in the West, the term implies a congruence of avowal and inner feeling, but inner feeling is in turn ideally responsive to ritual propriety and social hierarchy. Specifically, Confucian's \"Analects\" contains the following statement in Chapter I: (主忠信。毋友不如己者。過，則勿憚改。) \"Hold faithfulness and sincerity as first principles. Then no friends would not be like yourself (all friends would be as loyal as yourself). If you make a mistake, do not be afraid to correct it.\"\n\nThus, even today, a powerful leader will praise leaders of other realms as \"sincere\" to the extent that they \"know their place\" in the sense of fulfilling a role in the drama of life. In Japanese the character for \"cheng\" may be pronounced \"makoto\", and carries still more strongly the sense of loyal avowal and belief.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6714444", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6714444", "title": "Tapovan", "text": "Tapovan\n\nTapovan (Sanskrit) comes from the two root words \"tapas\" - meaning penance and by extension religious mortification and austerity, and more generally spiritual practice, and \"vana,\" meaning forest or thicket. \"Tapovan\" then translates as \"forest of austerities or spiritual practice\".\n\nIn Honour to the great saint Tapovan Maharaj this area was named as Tapovan. He authored two books on his travels through the Himalayas: \"Wanderings in the Himalayas\" (Himagiri Viharam) and \"Kailasa Yatra.\" Tapovan Maharaj exhibited a deep love for nature and his accounts of his travels demonstrate such.[citation needed] His autobiography, written in Sanskrit is titled \"Ishvara Darshana\". After observance of rites and rituals following the Master's last earthly breath (1957), Shri Swami Tapovan Maharaj's body was interred into the holy Ganga by a procession of Sadhus. To this present day, there is a simple, solemn and dignified way in which the Uttarkashi monks mark the samaadhi of any sadhu and Swami Tapovan Maharaj represents the ideal of austerity and pinnacle of wisdom which all anchorites aspire to.\n\nTraditionally in India, any place where someone has engaged in serious spiritual retreat may become known as a tapovan, even if there is no forest. As well as particular caves and other hermitages where sages and sadhus have dwelt, there are some places, such as the western bank of the northern Ganges river around Rishikesh, that have been so used by hermits that the whole area has become known as a \"tapovan\".\n\nThe most well known \"tapovan\" in India is the area above the Gangotri Glacier at one of the primary sources of the Ganges, in Uttarakhand, India. At the foot of Shivling peak, a barren area at about 4,463m (14640 feet) elevation, is a seasonal home to several sadhus living in caves, huts etc. and it has become a trekking destination also. The trekking usually starts from Gomukh and the trek was considered moderate to difficult prior to the destruction of much of the trail from Gangotri to Gamukh by the 2013 North Indian Floods. Tapovan area is base camp for several mountaineering expeditions including Shivling peak, Bhagirathi peak etc. Tapovan area is full of meadows, streams and flowering plants and the meadows are considered as one of the best high altitude meadow in India. There is also a place named Nandanvan near Tapovan, and Nandanvan is also trekked by trekkers and pilgrims. Nandanvan is also a spacious meadow located at the base of Bhagirathi massif.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tapovan_Maharaj\n"}

In the second portion of the book, he presents moral foundations theory, and applies it to the political beliefs of liberals, conservatives, and libertarians in the US.\n\nHaidt argues that people are too quick to denigrate other points of view without giving those views full consideration, and attempts to reach common ground between liberals and conservatives. He makes the case in the book for morality having multiple foundations (more than just harm and fairness), and said in an interview that morality \"is at least six things, and probably a lot more than that\" and \"[religion and politics are] ... expressions of our tribal, groupish, righteous nature\". Haidt himself acknowledges that while he has been a liberal all his life, he is now more open to other points of view.\n\n\nThe book received mostly positive reviews and was #6 on the \"New York Times\"' best seller list for non-fiction in April, 2012.\n\n\n"}

The big toes may then be grasped with the hands, or with a belt around each foot. The back is lightly arched by raising the coccyx, and the body is inclined forwards. In the completed pose, the body leans forwards until the chin and nose touch the ground. People who cannot sit on the floor in dandasana can sit on a folded blanket for the pose.\n\nA variation is to lean forward and to place the hands, palms up, on the ground in front of the body.\n\nThe pose provides a stretch for the hamstrings, and is stated without evidence in \"Light on Yoga\" to assist the circulation in the pelvic region and to relieve sciatica. The pose is stated, again without evidence, to be useful for \"gynaecological problems\", and safe in both menstruation and pregnancy provided no strain is applied. However, the ashtanga yoga master K. Pattabhi Jois states that it should not be performed in pregnancy, though agreeing on its benefit for the sciatic nerve.\n\n\n"}
