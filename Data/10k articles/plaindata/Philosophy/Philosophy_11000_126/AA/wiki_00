It provides this advice online, through one-on-one advice sessions and through a community of like-minded individuals. The organisation is part of the Centre for Effective Altruism, affiliated with the University of Oxford Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics. The organisation's name refers to the typical amount of time someone spends working over a lifetime. It was one of the nonprofits funded by startup accelerator Y Combinator in 2015.\n\nAccording to 80,000 Hours, some careers aimed at doing good are far more effective than others. On their framework for assessing different career options, the value of a career is regarded as depending on both its potential for impact and on the degree to which it gives the individual better opportunities to have an impact in the future.\n\nThe group emphasises that the positive impact of choosing a certain occupation should be measured by the amount of additional good that is done as a result of this choice, not by the amount of good directly done. It considers indirect ways of making a difference, such as earning a high salary in a conventional career and donating a portion of it, as well as direct ways, such as scientific research. The moral philosopher Peter Singer mentions the example of banking and finance as a potentially high impact career through such donations in his TED Talk, \"The why and how of effective altruism,\" where he discusses the work of 80,000 Hours. \n\nWilliam MacAskill is the Founder and President of 80,000 Hours, the Co-founder and Vice-President of Giving What We Can, and a Research Associate at the Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics, Oxford University.\n\n80,000 Hours has promoted the idea that pursuing a high-earning career and donating a significant portion of the income to cost-effective charities can be an effective philanthropic strategy for some people. John Humphrys criticised this idea on the BBC Today programme, saying that people interested in becoming wealthy tend to be selfish and that idealistic young people will become cynical as they age.\n\nThis idea was also criticised in the \"Oxford Left Review\", where Pete Mills wrote that lucrative careers perpetuate an unjust system. In addition, he argues that because the likelihood of bringing about social change is difficult to quantify, 80,000 Hours is biased toward quantifiable methods of doing good.\n\nOver time 80,000 Hours has deemphasised 'earning to give', in favour of alternative paths like research, advocacy or policy reform, and begun recommending work on problems that are less easily quantified. \n\nDavid Brooks of \"The New York Times\" has criticised the organisation for its consequentialist approach to altruism and has argued that cultivating altruism is not purely a matter of maximising one's positive social impact.\n\nThe effective altruism movement, of which 80,000 Hours is a part, has been criticised by Ken Berger, the founder of Charity Navigator for its efforts to objectively compare and prioritise charitable causes, which he believes to be a subjective process that is the responsibility of individual donors. William MacAskill responded to this article justifying the need to figure out which charities do the most good. \n\n"}
{"id": "201572", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=201572", "title": "Anatta", "text": "Anatta\n\nIn Buddhism, the term anattā (Pali) or anātman (Sanskrit) refers to the doctrine of \"non-self\", that there is no unchanging, permanent self, soul or essence in living beings. It is one of the seven beneficial perceptions in Buddhism, and along with \"Dukkha\" (suffering) and \"Anicca\" (impermanence), it is one of three Right Understandings about the three marks of existence.\n\nThe Buddhist concept of Anattā or Anātman is one of the fundamental differences between Buddhism and Hinduism, with the latter asserting that Atman (self, soul) exists.\n\n\"Anattā\" is a composite Pali word consisting of \"an\" (not, without) and \"attā\" (soul). The term refers to the central Buddhist doctrine that \"there is in humans no permanent, underlying substance that can be called the soul.\" It is one of the three characteristics of all existence, together with \"dukkha\" (suffering, unsatisfactoriness) and \"anicca\" (impermanence).\n\n\"Anattā\" is synonymous with \"Anātman\" (an + ātman) in Sanskrit Buddhist texts. In some Pali texts, \"ātman\" of Vedic texts is also referred to with the term \"Attan\", with the sense of soul. An alternate use of \"Attan\" or \"Atta\" is \"self, oneself, essence of a person\", driven by the Vedic era Brahmanical belief that the soul is the permanent, unchangeable essence of a living being, or the true self.\n\nIn Buddhism-related English literature, \"Anattā\" is rendered as \"not-Self\", but this translation expresses an incomplete meaning, states Peter Harvey; a more complete rendering is \"non-Self\" because from its earliest days, \"Anattā\" doctrine denies that there is anything called a 'Self' in any person or anything else, and that a belief in 'Self' is a source of \"Dukkha\" (suffering, pain, unsatisfactoriness). It is also incorrect to translate \"Anattā\" simply as \"ego-less\", according to Peter Harvey, because the Indian concept of \"ātman\" and \"attā\" is different from the Freudian concept of ego.\n\n\"Anatta\" or \"Anatta-vada\" is also referred to as the \"no-soul or no-self doctrine\" of Buddhism.\n\nThe concept of \"Anattā\" appears in numerous Sutta of the ancient Buddhist Nikāya texts (Pali canon). It appears, for example, as a noun in \"Samyutta Nikaya\" III.141, IV.49, V.345, in Sutta II.37 of \"Anguttara Nikaya\", II.37–45 and II.80 of \"Patisambhidamagga\", III.406 of \"Dhammapada\". It also appears as an adjective, for example, in \"Samyutta Nikaya\" III.114, III.133, IV.28 and IV.130–166, in Sutta III.66 and V.86 of \"Vinaya\".\n\nThe ancient Buddhist texts discuss \"Attā\" or \"Attan\" (soul, self), sometimes with alternate terms such as \"Atuman\", \"Tuma\", \"Puggala\", \"Jiva\", \"Satta\", \"Pana\" and \"Nama-rupa\", thereby providing the context for the Buddhist \"Anattā\" doctrine. Examples of such \"Attā\" contextual discussions are found in \"Digha Nikaya\" I.186-187, \"Samyutta Nikaya\" III.179 and IV.54, \"Vinaya\" I.14, \"Majjhima Nikaya\" I.138, III.19, and III.265–271 and \"Anguttara Nikaya\" I.284.\n\nThe contextual use of \"Attā\" in Nikāyas is two sided. In one, it directly denies that there is anything called a self or soul in a human being that is a permanent essence of a human being, a theme found in Brahmanical (proto-Hindu) traditions. In another, states Peter Harvey, such as at \"Samyutta Nikaya\" IV.286, the Sutta considers the materialistic concept in pre-Buddhist Vedic times of \"no afterlife, complete annihilation\" at death to be a denial of Self, but still \"tied up with belief in a Self\". \"Self exists\" is a false premise, assert the early Buddhist texts. However, adds Peter Harvey, these texts do not admit the premise \"Self does not exist\" either because the wording presumes the concept of \"Self\" prior to denying it; instead, the early Buddhist texts use the concept of \"Anattā\" as the implicit premise. According to Steven Collins, the doctrine of anatta and \"denial of self\" in the canonical Buddhist texts is \"insisted on only in certain theoretical contexts\", while they use the terms \"atta, purisa, puggala\" quite naturally and freely in various contexts. The elaboration of the anatta doctrine, along with identification of the words such as \"puggala\" as \"permanent subject or soul\" appears in later Buddhist literature.\n\n\"Anattā\" is one of the main bedrock doctrines of Buddhism, and its discussion is found in the later texts of all Buddhist traditions. For example, the Buddhist philosopher Nagarjuna (~200 CE), extensively wrote about rejecting the metaphysical entity called \"attā\" or \"ātman\" (self, soul), asserting in chapter 18 of his \"Mūlamadhyamakakārikā\" that there is no such substantial entity and that \"Buddha taught the doctrine of no-self\". The texts attributed to the 5th-century Buddhist philosopher Vasubandhu of the Yogachara school similarly discuss \"Anatta\" as a fundamental premise of the Buddha. The Vasubandhu interpretations of no-self thesis were challenged by the 7th-century Buddhist scholar Candrakirti, who then offered his own theories on its importance.\n\n\"Anattā\" (no-self, without soul, no essence) is the nature of living beings, and this is one of the three marks of existence in Buddhism, along with \"Anicca\" (impermanence, nothing lasts) and \"Dukkha\" (suffering, unsatisfactoriness is innate in birth, aging, death, rebirth, redeath – the Saṃsāra cycle of existence). It is found in many texts of different Buddhist traditions, such as the \"Dhammapada\" – a canonical Buddhist text. Buddhism asserts with Four Noble Truths that there is a way out of this Saṃsāra.\n\nWhile the concept of soul in Hinduism (as atman) and Jainism (as jiva) is taken for granted, which is different from the Buddhist concept of no-soul, each of the three religions believed in rebirth and emphasized moral responsibility in different ways in contrast to pre-Buddhist materialistic schools of Indian philosophies. The materialistic schools of Indian philosophies, such as Charvaka, are called annihilationist schools because they posited that death is the end, there is no afterlife, no soul, no rebirth, no karma, and death is that state where a living being is completely annihilated, dissolved.\n\nBuddha criticized the materialistic annihilationism view that denied rebirth and karma, states Damien Keown. Such beliefs are inappropriate and dangerous, stated Buddha, because they encourage moral irresponsibility and material hedonism. Anatta does not mean there is no afterlife, no rebirth or no fruition of karma, and Buddhism contrasts itself to annihilationist schools. Buddhism also contrasts itself to other Indian religions that champion moral responsibility but posit eternalism with their premise that within each human being there is an essence or eternal soul, and this soul is part of the nature of a living being, existence and metaphysical reality.\n\nThe Buddha emphasized both karma and anatta doctrines.\n\nThe Buddha criticized the doctrine that posited an unchanging soul as a subject as the basis of rebirth and karmic moral responsibility, which he called \"atthikavāda\". He also criticized the materialistic doctrine that denied the existence of both soul and rebirth, and thereby denied karmic moral responsibility, which he calls \"natthikavāda\". Instead, the Buddha asserted that there is no soul, but there is rebirth for which karmic moral responsibility is a must. In the Buddha's framework of karma, right view and right actions are necessary for liberation.\n\nAccording to Peter Harvey, while the \"Suttas\" criticize notions of an eternal, unchanging Self as baseless, they see an enlightened being as one whose empirical self is highly developed. This is paradoxical, states Harvey, in that \"the Self-like \"nibbana\" state\" is a mature self that knows \"everything as Selfless\". The \"empirical self\" is the \"citta\" (mind/heart, mindset, emotional nature), and the development of self in the Suttas is the development of this \"citta\".\n\nOne with \"great self\", state the early Buddhist \"Suttas\", has a mind which is neither at the mercy of outside stimuli nor its own moods, neither scattered nor diffused, but imbued with self-control, and self-contained towards the single goal of \"nibbana\" and a 'Self-like' state. This \"great self\" is not yet an \"Arahat\", because he still does small evil action which leads to karmic fruition, but he has enough virtue that he does not experience this fruition in hell.\n\nAn \"Arahat\", states Harvey, has a fully enlightened state of empirical self, one that lacks the \"sense of both 'I am' and 'this I am'\", which are illusions that the \"Arahat\" has transcended. The Buddhist thought and salvation theory emphasizes a development of self towards a Selfless state not only with respect to oneself, but recognizing the lack of relational essence and Self in others, wherein states Martijn van Zomeren, \"self is an illusion\".\n\nTheravada Buddhism scholars, states Oliver Leaman, consider the \"Anattā\" doctrine as one of the main theses of Buddhism.\n\nThe Buddhist denial of \"any Soul or Self\" is what distinguishes Buddhism from major religions of the world such as Christianity and Hinduism, giving it uniqueness, asserts the Theravada tradition. With the doctrine of \"Anattā\", stands or falls the entire Buddhist structure, asserts Nyanatiloka.\n\nAccording to Collins,\" insight into the teaching of anatta is held to have two major loci in the intellectual and spiritual education of an individual\" as s/he progresses along the Path. The first part of this insight is to avoid \"sakkayaditthi\" (Personality Belief), that is converting the \"sense of I which is gained from introspection and the fact of physical individuality\" into a theoretical belief in a self. 'A belief in a (really) existing body' is considered a false belief and a part of the Ten Fetters that must be gradually lost. The second loci is the psychological realisation of anatta, or loss of 'pride or conceit'. This, states Collins, is explained as the conceit of \"asmimana\" or 'I am'; (...) what this 'conceit' refers to is the fact that for the unenlightened man, all experience and action must necessarily appear phenomenologically as happening to or originating from an 'I'. When a Buddhist gets more enlightened, this happening to or originating in an 'I' or sakkdyaditthi is less. The final attainment of enlightenment is the disappearance of this automatic but illusory 'I'.\n\nThe Theravada tradition has long considered the understanding and application of the \"Anatta\" doctrine to a complex teaching, whose \"personal, introjected application has always been thought to be possible only for the specialist, the practising monk\". The tradition, states Collins, has \"insisted fiercely on anatta as a doctrinal position\", while in practice it may not play much of a role in the daily religious life of most Buddhists. The Suttas present the doctrine in three forms. First, they apply the \"no-self, no-identity\" doctrine to all phenomena as well as any and all objects, yielding the idea that \"all things are not-self\" (\"sabbe dhamma anatta\"). Second, states Collins, the Suttas apply the doctrine to deny self of any person, treating conceit to be evident in any assertion of \"this is mine, this I am, this is myself\" (\"etam mamam eso 'ham asmi, eso me atta ti\"). Third, the Theravada texts apply the doctrine as a nominal reference, to identify examples of \"self\" and \"not-self\", respectively the Wrong view and the Right view; this third case of nominative usage is properly translated as \"self\" (as an identity) and is unrelated to \"soul\", states Collins. The first two usages incorporate the idea of soul. The Theravada doctrine of \"Anatta\", or not-self not-soul, inspire meditative practices for monks, states Donald Swearer, but for the lay Theravada Buddhists in Southeast Asia, the doctrines of \"kamma\", rebirth and \"punna\" (merit) inspire a wide range of ritual practices and ethical behavior.\n\nThe \"Anatta\" doctrine is key to the concept of nirvana (nibbana) in the Theravada tradition. The liberated nirvana state, states Collins, is the state of \"Anatta\", a state that is neither universally applicable nor can be explained, but can be realized.\n\nThe dispute about \"self\" and \"not-self\" doctrines has continued throughout the history of Buddhism.\nIt is possible, states Johannes Bronkhorst, that \"original Buddhism did not deny the existence of the soul\", even though a firm Buddhist tradition has maintained that the Buddha avoided talking about the soul or even denied its existence. While there may be ambivalence on the existence or non-existence of self in early Buddhist literature, adds Bronkhorst, it is clear from these texts that seeking self-knowledge is not the Buddhist path for liberation, and turning away from self-knowledge is. This is a reverse position to the Vedic traditions which recognized the knowledge of the self as \"the principal means to achieving liberation\".\n\nIn Thai Theravada Buddhism, for example, states Paul Williams, some modern era Buddhist scholars have claimed that \"nirvana is indeed the true Self\", while other Thai Buddhists disagree. For instance, the Dhammakaya Movement in Thailand teaches that it is erroneous to subsume nirvana under the rubric of \"anatta\" (non-self); instead, nirvana is taught to be the \"true self\" or \"dhammakaya\". The Dhammakaya Movement teaching that nirvana is atta, or true self, was criticized as heretical in Buddhism in the 1994 by Ven. Payutto, a well-known scholar monk, who stated that 'Buddha taught nibbana as being non-self\". The abbot of one major temple in the Dhammakaya Movement, Luang Por Sermchai of Wat Luang Por Sodh Dhammakayaram, argues that it tends to be scholars who hold the view of absolute non-self, rather than Buddhist meditation practitioners. He points to the experiences of prominent forest hermit monks to support the notion of a \"true self\". Similar interpretations on the \"true self\" were put forth earlier by the 12th Supreme Patriarch of Thailand in 1939. According to Williams, the Supreme Patriarch's interpretation echoes the \"tathāgatagarbha\" sutras.\n\nSeveral notable teachers of the Thai Forest Tradition have also described ideas in contrast to absolute non-self. Ajahn Maha Bua, a well known meditation master, described the citta (mind) as being an indestructible reality that does not fall under \"anattā.\" He has stated that not-self is merely a perception that is used to pry one away from infatuation with the concept of a self, and that once this infatuation is gone the idea of not-self must be dropped as well. American monk Thanissaro Bhikkhu of the Thai Forest Tradition describes the Buddha's statements on non-self as a path to awakening rather than a universal truth. Thanissaro Bhikkhu states that the Buddha intentionally set the question of whether or not there is a self aside as a useless question, and that clinging to the idea that there is no self at all would actually \"prevent\" enlightenment. \n\nScholars Alexander Wynne and Rupert Gethin also take a similar position as Thanissaro Bhikkhu, arguing that the Buddha's description of non-self in the five aggregates do not necessarily mean there is no self, stating that the five aggregates are not descriptions of a human being but phenomena for one to observe. Wynne argues that the Buddha's statements on anattā are a \"not-self\" teaching rather than a \"no-self\" teaching.\n\nThanissaro Bhikkhu points to the Ananda Sutta, where the Buddha stays silent when asked whether there is a 'self' or not, as a major cause of the dispute. In Thailand, this dispute on the nature of teachings about 'self' and 'non-self' in Buddhism has led to arrest warrants, attacks and threats.\n\nThere are many different views of Anatta (; Japanese: 無我 \"muga\") within various Mahayana schools.\n\nNagarjuna, the founder of Madhyamaka (middle way) school of Mahayana Buddhism, analyzed dharma first as factors of experience. He, states David Kalupahana, analyzed how these experiences relate to \"bondage and freedom, action and consequence\", and thereafter analyzed the notion of personal self (\"attā\", \"ātman\").\n\nNagarjuna asserted that the notion of a self is associated with the notion of one's own identity and corollary ideas of pride, selfishness and a sense of psychophysical personality. This is all false, and leads to bondage in his Madhyamaka thought. There can be no pride nor possessiveness, in someone who accepts \"Anattā\" and denies \"self\" which is the sense of personal identity of oneself, others or anything, states Nagarjuna. Further, all obsessions are avoided when a person accepts emptiness (\"sunyata\"). Nagarjuna denied there is anything called a self-nature as well as other-nature, emphasizing true knowledge to be comprehending emptiness. Anyone who has not dissociated from his belief in personality in himself or others, through the concept of self, is in a state of \"Avidya\" (ignorance) and caught in the cycle of rebirths and redeaths.\n\nThe early Mahayana Buddhism texts link their discussion of \"emptiness\" (\"shunyata\") to \"Anatta\" and \"Nirvana\". They do so, states Mun-Keat Choong, in three ways: first, in the common sense of a monk's meditative state of emptiness; second, with the main sense of \"Anatta\" or 'everything in the world is empty of self'; third, with the ultimate sense of \"Nirvana\" or realization of emptiness and thus an end to rebirth cycles of suffering. The Anatta doctrine is another aspect of \"shunyata\", its realization is the nature of the \"nirvana\" state and to an end to rebirths.\n\nSome 1st-millennium CE Buddhist texts suggest concepts that have been controversial because they imply a \"self-like\" concept. In particular are the \"Tathāgatagarbha sūtras\", where the title itself means a \"garbha\" (womb, matrix, seed) containing \"Tathagata\" (Buddha). These Sutras suggest, states Paul Williams, that 'all sentient beings contain a Tathagata' as their 'essence, core or essential inner nature'. The \"Tathagatagarbha\" doctrine, at its earliest probably appeared about the later part of the 3rd century CE, and is verifiable in Chinese translations of 1st millennium CE. Most scholars consider the \"Tathagatagarbha \" doctrine of an 'essential nature' in every living being is equivalent to 'Self', and it contradicts the Anatta doctrines in a vast majority of Buddhist texts, leading scholars to posit that the \"Tathagatagarbha Sutras\" were written to promote Buddhism to non-Buddhists.\n\nThe \"Mahayana\" \"Mahaparinirvana Sutra\" explicitly asserts that the Buddha used the term \"Self\" in order to win over non-Buddhist ascetics. The \"Ratnagotravibhāga\" (also known as \"Uttaratantra\"), another text composed in the first half of 1st millennium CE and translated into Chinese in 511 CE, points out that the teaching of the \"Tathagatagarbha\" doctrine is intended to win sentient beings over to abandoning \"self-love\" (\"atma-sneha\") – considered to be one of the defects by Buddhism. The 6th-century Chinese \"Tathagatagarbha\" translation states that \"Buddha has \"shiwo\" (True Self) which is beyond being and nonbeing\". However, the \"Ratnagotravibhāga\" asserts that the \"Self\" implied in \"Tathagatagarbha\" doctrine is actually \"not-Self\".\n\nAccording to some scholars, the Buddha-nature discussed in these sutras does not represent a substantial self; rather, it is a positive language and expression of śūnyatā \"emptiness\" and represents the potentiality to realize Buddhahood through Buddhist practices. Other scholars do in fact detect leanings towards monism in these tathagatagarbha references. Michael Zimmermann sees the notion of an unperishing and eternal self in the Tathagatagarbha Sutra. Zimmermann also avers that 'the existence of an eternal, imperishable self, that is, buddhahood, is definitely the basic point of the Tathagatagarbha Sutra'. He further indicates that there is no evident interest found in this sutra in the idea of Emptiness (\"sunyata\"). Williams states that the \"Self\" in \"Tathagatagarbha Sutras\" is actually \"non-Self\", and neither identical nor comparable to the Hindu concepts of Brahman and Self.\n\nThe Anatta or Anatman doctrine is extensively discussed in and partly inspires the ritual practices of the Vajrayana tradition. The Tibetan terms such as \"bdag med\" refer to \"without a self, insubstantial, anatman\". These discussions, states Jeffrey Hopkins, assert the \"non-existence of a permanent, unitary and independent self\", and attribute these ideas to the Buddha.\n\nThe ritual practices in Vajrayana Buddhism employs the concept of deities, to end self-grasping, and to manifest as a purified, enlightened deity as part of the Vajrayana path to liberation from rebirths. One such deity is goddess Nairatmya (literally, non-soul, non-self). She symbolizes, states Miranda Shaw, that \"self is an illusion\" and \"all beings and phenomenal appearances lack an abiding self or essence\" in Vajrayana Buddhism.\n\nAnatta is a central doctrine of Buddhism. It marks one of the major differences between Buddhism and Hinduism. According to the anatta doctrine of Buddhism, at the core of all human beings and living creatures, there is no \"eternal, essential and absolute something called a soul, self or atman\". Buddhism, from its earliest days, has denied the existence of the \"self, soul\" in its core philosophical and ontological texts. In its soteriological themes, Buddhism has defined nirvana as that blissful state when a person, amongst other things, realizes that he or she has \"no self, no soul\".\n\nThe traditions within Hinduism believe in Atman. The pre-Buddhist Upanishads of Hinduism assert that there is a permanent \"Atman\", and is an ultimate metaphysical reality. This sense of self, is expressed as \"I am\" in Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 1.4.1, states Peter Harvey, when nothing existed before the start of the universe. The Upanishadic scriptures hold that this soul or self is underlying the whole world. At the core of all human beings and living creatures, assert the Hindu traditions, there is \"eternal, innermost essential and absolute something called a soul, self that is atman.\" Within the diverse schools of Hinduism, there are differences of perspective on whether souls are distinct, whether Supreme Soul or God exists, whether the nature of Atman is dual or non-dual, and how to reach moksha. However, despite their internal differences, one shared foundational premise of Hinduism is that \"soul, self exists\", and that there is bliss in seeking this self, knowing self, and self-realization.\n\nBoth Buddhism and Hinduism distinguish ego-related \"I am, this is mine\", from their respective abstract doctrines of \"Anatta\" and \"Atman\". This, states Peter Harvey, may have been an influence of Buddhism on Hinduism.\n\nThe term \"niratman\" appears in the \"Maitrayaniya Upanishad\" of Hinduism, such as in verses 6.20, 6.21 and 7.4. \"Niratman\" literally means \"selfless\". The \"niratman\" concept has been interpreted to be analogous to \"anatman\" of Buddhism. The ontological teachings, however, are different. In the Upanishad, states Thomas Wood, numerous positive and negative descriptions of various states – such as \"niratman\" and \"sarvasyatman\" (the self of all) – are used in \"Maitrayaniya Upanishad\" to explain the nondual concept of the \"highest Self\". According to Ramatirtha, states Paul Deussen, the \"niratman\" state discussion is referring to stopping the recognition of oneself as an individual soul, and reaching the awareness of universal soul or the metaphysical Brahman.\n\n"}

{"id": "6491886", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6491886", "title": "Atheism in Hinduism", "text": "Atheism in Hinduism\n\nAtheism (Sanskrit: , , lit. \"statement of no Lord\", \"doctrine of godlessness\") or disbelief in God or gods has been a historically propounded viewpoint in many of the orthodox and heterodox streams of Hindu philosophies. In Indian philosophy, three schools of thought are commonly referred to as \"nastika\" for rejecting the doctrine of Vedas: Jainism, Buddhism and Cārvāka.\n\nHinduism is a religion, but also a philosophy. Among the various schools of Hindu philosophy, Samkhya, Yoga and Mimamsa while not rejecting either the Vedas or the Brahman, typically reject a personal God, creator God, or a God with attributes. While Samkhya and Yoga rejected the idea of an eternal, self-caused, creator God, Mimamsa argued that the Vedas could not have been authored by a deity.\n\nThough some schools of thought view the path of the atheist as difficult to follow in matters of spirituality, it is still a valid one.\n\nThe Sanskrit term ' (\"pious, orthodox\") refers to the systems of thought which admit the validity of the Vedas. Sanskrit ' means \"there is\", and ' (per Pāṇini 4.2.60) derives from the verb, meaning \"one who says '\". Technically, in Hindu philosophy the term refers only to acceptance of authority of Vedas, not belief in the existence of God. However, though not accepted universally, ' is sometimes translated as \"theist\" and ' as \"atheist\", assuming the rejection of Vedas to be synonymous to the rejection of God.\n\nAnother interpretation by Swami Vivekananda states \"As certain religions of the world say that a man who does not believe in a Personal God outside of himself is an atheist, so the Vedanta says, a man who does not believe in himself is an atheist. Not believing in the glory of our own soul is what the Vedanta calls atheism.\"\n\nThe Rig Veda, the oldest of the Vedas, deals with significant skepticism around the fundamental question of a creator God and the creation of the universe. It does not, at many instances, categorically accept the existence of a creator God. Nasadiya Sukta (\"Creation Hymn\") in the tenth chapter of the Rig Veda states:\n\nThe Brihadaranyaka, Isha, Mundaka (in which Brahman is everything and \"no-thing\") and especially the Chandogya Upanishads have also been interpreted as atheistic because of their stress on the subjective self.\n\nMimamsa was a realistic, pluralistic school of philosophy which was concerned with the exegesis of the Vedas. The core text of the school was the Purva Mimamsa Sutras of Jaimini (c. 200 BCE–200 CE). Mimamsa philosophers believed that the revelation of the Vedas was sacred, authorless (\"apaurusheyatva\") and infallible, and that it was essential to preserve the sanctity of the Vedic ritual to maintain dharma (cosmic order). As a consequence of the belief in sanctity of the ritual, Mimamsas rejected the notion of God in any form. Later commentators of the Mimamsa sutras such as Prabhākara (c. 7th century CE) advanced arguments against the existence of God. The early Mimamsa not only did not accept God but said that human action itself was enough to create the necessary circumstances for the enjoyment of its fruits.\n\nSamkhya is an atheistic and strongly dualistic orthodox (Astika) school of Indian philosophy. The earliest surviving authoritative text on classical Samkhya philosophy is the Samkhyakarika (c. 350–450 CE) of Iśvarakṛṣṇa. The Samkhyakarika is silent on the issue of Isvara's existence or nonexistence, although first millennium commentators such as Gaudapada understand the text as compatible with some concept of God. However, the Samkhya Sutra (14th c. CE) and its commentaries explicitly attempt to disprove God's existence through reasoned argument.\n\nCārvāka, a materialistic and atheistic school of Indian philosophy, had developed a systematic philosophy by the 6th century CE. Cārvākas rejected metaphysical concepts like reincarnation, the afterlife, an extracorporeal soul, the efficacy of religious rites, other worlds (heaven and hell), fate, and accumulation of merit or demerit through the performance of certain actions. Cārvākas also refused to ascribe supernatural causes to natural phenomena. Cārvāka philosophy appears to have died out some time after 1200 CE.\n\nĀjīvikas was a movement (extinct from at least the 13th century CE) whose founder, Makkhali Gosala, was a contemporary of Mahavira and Gautama Buddha (the central figures of Jainism and Buddhism, respectively). Gosala and his followers also denied the existence of a creator god.\n\nMimamsas argued that there was no need to postulate a maker for the world, just as there was no need for an author to compose the Vedas or a God to validate the rituals. They further thought that the Gods named in the Vedas had no physical existence apart from the \"mantras\" that speak their names. In this regard, the power of the mantras was what was seen as the power of Gods. Mimamsas reasoned that an incorporeal God could not author the Vedas, for he would not have the organs of speech to utter words. An embodied God could not author the Vedas either because such a God would be subject to the natural limitations of sensory knowledge and therefore, would not be able to produce supernatural revelations like the Vedas.\n\nSamkhya gave the following arguments against the idea of an eternal, self-caused, creator God:\nTherefore, Samkhya maintained not only that the various cosmological, ontological and teleological arguments could not prove God, but that God as normally understood--an omnipotent, omniscient, benevolent creator who is free from suffering--cannot exist.\n\nThe Indian Nobel Prize-winner Amartya Sen, in an interview with Pranab Bardhan for the \"California Magazine\" published in the July–August 2006 edition by the University of California, Berkeley states:\nAccording to Markandey Katju, former Chairman of the Press Council of India and former judge of the Supreme Court of India, \"...there are six classical systems of Indian philosophy, Nyaya, Vaisheshik, Sankya, Yoga, Purva Mimansa and Uttar Mimansa, and three non-classical systems, Buddhism, Jainism and Charvak. Out of these nine systems eight of them are atheistic as there is no place for God in them. Only the ninth one, that is Uttar Mimansa, which is also called Vedanta, has a place for God in it.\"\n\n\n\n"}

He entered the Society of Jesus in 1552 and taught successively literature, philosophy, theology, and sacred scripture in Rome, where he died.\n\nHe published eight works, and left a vast deal of manuscript. (Sommervogel, infra, mentions twelve sets.)\n\nHis main philosophical work is \"De communibus omnium rerum naturalium principiis et affectionibus libri quindecim\" (Rome, 1576).\n\nThe main difficulties of the \"Book of Genesis\" are met in \"Commentariorum et disputationum in Genesim tomi quattuor\" (Rome, 1591–1599). This is a mine of information in regard to the Deluge, Noah's Ark, the Tower of Babel, etc., and was highly rated by Richard Simon (\"Histoire critique du Vieux Testament\", III, xii).\n\nThe \"Commentariorum in Danielem prophetam libri sexdecim\" (Rome, 1587) are much less diffuse.

The debate concerned the nature of mathematics. Pereira argued that mathematical demonstrations point to complex relations between numbers, lines, figures, etc., but lack the logical force of a demonstration from true causes or the essence of things. Furthermore, mathematics does not have a true subject matter; it merely draws connections between different properties (Alexander, p. 69). Clavius responded in \"Prolegomena\" that the subject of mathematics is matter itself, since all mathematics is \"immersed\" in matter. The debate had broad ramifications with regard to inclusion of mathematics as a basic subject in the Jesuit curriculum.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Keynote speaker and author Dr. S.M. Davis has developed a unique stand on this philosophy, and his materials have been popular with the homeschool culture since the early 1990s.

They include Ashanti Alston, Lorenzo Kom'boa Ervin, Kuwasi Balagoon, Kai Lumumba Barrow, Greg Jackson, and Martin Sostre. Critics of the term suggest that it elides major political differences between these individuals, incorrectly presenting these individuals as having a shared theory or movement, while imposing a label that these individuals do not (or did not) all accept. \n\nThe individuals to whom the label has been applied all oppose the existence of the State, the subjugation and domination of black people, and other groups, and favor a non-hierarchical organization of society. In general, these individuals argue for class struggle while stressing the importance of ending racial and national oppression, opposing white supremacy, patriarchy, capitalism, and the state. They have generally rejected narrow or vulgar forms of \"anarchism\" that ignore issues of race and national oppression, a deformed \"white, petty-bourgeois Anarchism that cannot relate to the people\" and that refuses to deal with issues of race saying \"No, don't talk about racism unless it is in that very abstract sense of we-are-all-equal-let's-sing-kumbayas-and-pretend-the-color-of-our-skin-does-not-matter\" anti-racism. \n\nAshanti Alston (who has explicitly used the term \"Black Anarchism\") also argued that: \nBlack culture has always been oppositional and is all about finding ways to creatively resist oppression here, in the most racist country in the world [the United States]. So, when I speak of a Black anarchism, it is not so tied to the color of my skin but who I am as a person, as someone who can resist, who can see differently when I am stuck, and thus live differently.\n\nHe added that, as an anarchist, he viewed black nationalism as progressive yet also as deeply limited: \"Panther anarchism is ready, willing and able to challenge old nationalist and revolutionary notions that have been accepted as ‘common-sense.’ It also challenges the bullshit in our lives and in the so-called movement that holds us back from building a genuine movement based on the enjoyment of life, diversity, practical self-determination and multi-faceted resistance to the Babylonian Pigocracy. This Pigocracy is in our ‘heads,’ our relationships as well as in the institutions that have a vested interest in our eternal domination.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "27665426", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27665426", "title": "Charisma", "text": "Charisma\n\nThe term charisma (; pl. \"charismata\", adj. \"charismatic\") has two senses:\n\n\nIn discussing sense 1, scholars in sociology, political science, psychology, and management reserve the term for a type of leadership seen as extraordinary; in these fields, the term \"charisma\" is used to describe a particular type of leader who uses \"values-based, symbolic, and emotion-laden leader signaling\".\n\nIn some theological usages, the term appears as \"charism\", with a meaning the same as sense 2.\n\nSince the 1950s, the term has become widely used, with varying meanings, in religion, the social sciences, the biological sciences, the media, and throughout Western societies.\n\nSince the advent of Dungeons & Dragons in 1974, the word charisma has also been used as an attribute in gaming, where it designates a character's likeability and their ability to persuade.\n\nThe English term \"charisma\" is from the Greek (\"khárisma\"), which means \"favor freely given\" or \"gift of grace\". The term and its plural (\"charismata\") derive from (\"charis\"), which means \"grace\". Some derivatives from that root (including \"grace\") have similar meanings to the modern sense of \"personality charisma\", such as \"filled with attractiveness or charm\", \"kindness\", \"to bestow a favor or service\", or \"to be favored or blessed\". Moreover, the ancient Greek dialect widely used in Roman times employed these terms without the connotations found in modern religious usage. Ancient Greeks applied personality charisma to their gods; for example, attributing charm, beauty, nature, human creativity or fertility to goddesses they called \"Charites\" ().\n\nTheologians and social scientists have expanded and modified the original Greek meaning into the two distinct senses above. For ease of reference, we will call the first sense \"personality charisma\" and the second \"divinely conferred charisma\".\n\nThe meaning of \"charisma\" has become greatly diffused from its original \"divinely conferred\" meaning, and even from the \"personality charisma\" meaning in modern English dictionaries, which reduces to a mixture of charm and status. John Potts, who has extensively analyzed the term's history, sums up meanings beneath this diffused common usage:Contemporary charisma maintains, however, the irreducible character ascribed to it by Weber: it retains a mysterious, elusive quality. Media commentators regularly describe charisma as the \"X-factor\". …The enigmatic character of charisma also suggests a connection – at least to some degree – to the earliest manifestations of charisma as a spiritual gift.\n\nThe Hebrew Bible and the Christian Bible record the development of \"divinely conferred charisma\". In the Hebrew text the idea of charismatic leadership is generally signaled by the use of the noun \"hen\" (favor) or the verb \"hanan\" (to show favor). The Greek term for \"charisma\" (grace or favor), and its root \"charis\" (grace) replaced the Hebrew terms in the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible (the 3rd century BC Septuagint). Throughout, \"the paradigmatic image of the charismatic hero is the figure who has received God's favor\". In other words, \"divinely conferred charisma\" applied to highly revered figures.\n\nThus, Eastern Mediterranean Jews in the 1st century CE had notions of \"charis\" and \"charisma\" that embraced the range of meanings found in Greek culture and the spiritual meanings from the Hebrew Bible. From this linguistic legacy of fused cultures, in 1 Corinthians, Paul the Apostle introduced the meaning that the Holy Spirit bestowed \"charism\" and \"charismata\", \"the gift of God's grace\", upon individuals or groups. For Paul, \"[t]here is a clear distinction between charisma and charis; charisma is the direct result of divine charis or grace\".\n\nIn the New Testament Epistles, Paul refers to \"charisma\" or its plural \"charismata\" seven times in 1 Corinthians, written in Koine (or common) Greek around 54 CE. He elaborates on his concepts with six references in Romans (c. 56). He makes 3 individual references in 2 Corinthians (c. 56), 1 Timothy, and 2 Timothy (c. 62 – c. 67). The seventeenth and only other mention of \"charisma\" is in 1 Peter.\n\nThe gospels, written in the late first century, apply \"divinely conferred charisma\" to revered figures. Examples are accounts of Jesus' baptism and of his transfiguration, in which disciples see him as radiant with light, appearing together with Moses and Elijah. Another example is Gabriel's greeting to Mary as \"full of grace\". In these and other instances early Christians designated certain individuals as possessing \"spiritual gifts\", and these gifts included \"the ability to penetrate the neighbour to the bottom of his heart and spirit and to recognize whether he is dominated by a good or by an evil spirit and the gift to help him to freedom from his demon\".\n\nBelievers characterized their revered religious figures as having \"a higher perfection… a special \"Charisma\"\". Then, with the establishment of the Christian Church, \"the old charismatic gifts and free offerings were transformed into a hierarchical sacerdotal system\". The focus on the institution rather than divinely inspired individuals increasingly dominated religious thought and life, and that focus went unchanged for centuries.\n\nAdditional changes began in the 17th century when church leaders, notably in the Latin tradition, accented \"individual gifts [and] particular talents imparted by God or the Holy Spirit\". The 19th century brought an increasing shift in emphasis toward individual and spiritual aspects of charisma; Protestant and some Catholic theologians narrowed the concept to superlative, out-of-the-ordinary, and virtuoso gifts. Simultaneously, the term became alienated from the much wider meaning that early Christians had attached to it. Still, the narrowed term projected back to the earlier period \"A systematically reflected and highly differentiated understanding of charisma was often unconsciously infused into the Scriptures and writings of the church fathers, so that these texts were no longer read through the eyes of the authors\".\n\nThese dialectic meanings influenced notable changes in Pentecostalism in the late 19th century, and charismatic movements in some mainline churches in the mid-20th century. The discussion in the 21st Century Religion section explores what \"charisma\" means in these and other religious groups.\n\nThe basis for modern secular usage comes from German sociologist Max Weber. He discovered the term in the work of Rudolph Sohm, a German church historian whose 1892 \"Kirchenrecht\" was immediately recognized in Germany as an epoch-making work. It also stimulated a debate between Sohm and leading theologians and religion scholars, which lasted more than twenty years and stimulated a rich polemical literature. The debate and literature had made \"charisma\" a popular term when Weber used it in \"The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism\" and in his \"Sociology of Religion\". Perhaps because he assumed that readers already understood the idea, Weber's early writings lacked definition or explanation of the concept. In the collection of his works, \"Economy and Society\" edited by his wife, he identified the term as a prime example of action he labeled \"value-rational,\" in distinction from and opposition to action he labeled \"Instrumentally rational.\" Because he applied meanings for \"charisma\" similar to Sohm, who had affirmed the purely charismatic nature of early Christianity, Weber's \"charisma\" would have coincided with the \"divinely conferred charisma\" sense defined above in Sohm's work.\n\nWeber introduced the \"personality charisma\" sense when he applied \"charisma\" to designate a form of authority. To explain charismatic authority he developed his classic definition:Charisma is a certain quality of an individual personality by virtue of which he is set apart from ordinary men and treated as endowed with supernatural, superhuman, or at least specifically exceptional powers or qualities. These as such are not accessible to the ordinary person, but are regarded as of divine origin or as exemplary, and on the basis of them the individual concerned is treated as a leader.\nHere Weber extends the concept of charisma beyond supernatural to superhuman and even to exceptional powers and qualities. Sociologist Paul Joosse examined Weber's famous definition, and found that:through simple yet profoundly consequential phrases such as “are considered” and “is treated,” charisma becomes a relational, attributable, and at last a properly sociological concept... For Weber, the locus of power is in the led, who actively (if perhaps unconsciously) invest their leaders with social authority.\n\nIn other words, Weber indicates that it is followers who attribute the individual with powers, emphasizing that \"the recognition on the part of those subject to authority\" is decisive for the validity of charisma.\n\nWeber died in 1920 leaving \"disordered, fragmentary manuscripts without even the guidance of a plan or table of the proposed contents\". One unfinished manuscript contained his above quoted definition of \"charisma\". It took over a quarter century for his work to be translated into English. With regard to charisma, Weber's formulations are generally regarded as having revived the concept from its deep theological obscurity. However, even with the admirable translations and prefaces of his entire works, many scholars have found Weber's formulations ambiguous. For the past half-century they have debated the meaning of many Weberian concepts, including the meaning of \"charisma,\" the role of followers, and the degree of a supernatural component. Although sociologists have been most active in applying Weber's ideas, researchers in management and organizational behavior including John Antonakis and his colleagues, have reignited interest in charisma with respect to defining the term in unambiguous ways, finding ways to experimentally manipulate charisma, and to estimate the causal effects of charisma on performance outcomes in work and political settings. Recently, evolutionary psychologists have used game theory and costly signaling theory to study the functions of charismatic leadership in the evolution of human cooperation.\n\n\nGrabo, A., Spisak, B.

He was President of the Royal Irish Academy, Dean of the Chapel Royal at Dublin Castle and a noted mathematician.\n\nBorn at 12 Fitzwilliam Square, Dublin, the son of John Crosbie Graves (1776–1835), Chief Police Magistrate for Dublin, by his wife Helena Perceval, the daughter and co-heiress of the Revd Charles Perceval (1751–1795) of Bruhenny, County Cork. Helena enjoyed the patronage of John Freeman-Mitford, 1st Baron Redesdale, who married a daughter of her father's cousin, John Perceval, 2nd Earl of Egmont.\n\nEducated at Trinity College, Dublin, he was elected a Scholar in classics, and in 1834 graduated BA as Senior Moderator in mathematics, getting his MA in 1838. He played cricket for Trinity, and later in his life did much boating and fly-fishing. It was intended that he should join the 18th (Royal Irish) Regiment of Foot under his uncle, Major-General James William Graves (1774–1845), and in preparation he had become an expert swordsman and rider.\n\nAfter leaving Trinity College, Graves followed in the steps of his grandfather, Thomas Graves, (appointed Dean of Ardfert in 1785 and Dean of Connor in 1802) and his great uncle, Richard Graves. He was appointed a fellow of Trinity College from 1836 to 1843 before taking the professorship of mathematics, a position he held until 1862.\n\nIn 1860 he was appointed Dean of the Chapel Royal and, from 1864 to 1866, he was the Dean of Clonfert before being consecrated as Bishop of Limerick, Ardfert and Aghadoe, a position he held for 33 years until his death in 1899. He had been elected a member of the Royal Irish Academy in 1837 and subsequently held various officerships, including President from 1861 to 1866.. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1880 and received the honorary degree of DCL from Oxford University in 1881.\n\n\"A gentleman and a scholar he was well respected as the Bishop of Limerick. He and the Catholic Bishop (O'Dwyer) were on the very best of terms. They cracked Latin jokes at each other, discussed fine points of scholarship and were unclerical enough not to take their religious differences too seriously\"\n\nBishop O'Dwyer had once joked at the size of Graves' family of nine and Graves retorted with the text about the blessedness of the man who has his quiver full of arrows, to which O'Dwyer replied \"The ancient Jewish Quiver only held six.\"\n\nIn 1841 Graves published an original mathematical work and he embodied further discoveries in his lectures and in papers read before and published by the Royal Irish Academy. He was a colleague of Sir William Rowan Hamilton and on the latter's death Graves gave a presidential panegyric containing a valuable account both of Hamilton's scientific labours and of his literary attainments.\n\nGraves was very interested in Irish antiquarian subjects. He discovered the key to the ancient Irish Ogham script which appeared as inscriptions on cromlechs and other stone monuments. He also prompted the government to publish the old Irish Brehon Laws, Early Irish Law. His suggestion was adopted and he was appointed a member of the Commission to do this.\n\nHis official residence was The Palace at Limerick, but from the 1850s he took the lease of Parknasilla House, County Kerry, as a summer residence. In 1892 he bought out the lease of the house and a further of land that included a few islands. In 1894 he sold it to Great Southern Hotels, who still own it to this day.\n\nOn 15 September 1840, Charles Graves married Selina, daughter of John Cheyne, Physician-General to the Forces in Ireland, an associate of Graves's father's cousin, Robert James Graves. Graves was the father of the poet Alfred Perceval Graves (1846–1931), of Arnold Felix Graves (1847–1930), the founder of (what is now) Dublin Institute of Technology, of the writer and critic Charles Larcom Graves (1856–1944), and of the diplomat Sir Robert Wyndham Graves (1858–1934).

As an example, this type of information may include the temperature in which water freezes or boils.

{"id": "6734332", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6734332", "title": "G. H. Pember", "text": "G. H. Pember\n\nGeorge Hawkins Pember (1837–1910), known as G. H. Pember, was an English theologian and author who was affiliated with the Plymouth Brethren.\n\nPember was born in Hereford, the son of George Hawkins Pember (1805–77) and Mary Pember (1804–77). He was educated at Hereford Cathedral School and matriculated from there in 1856. He then enrolled at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. He earned the B.A. in his studies in the Classics in 1860, and proceeded to postgraduate studies earning an M.A. in 1863. During his postgraduate studies Pember held a teaching post as assistant master at Rossall, Lancashire, from 1861 to 1863. On 14 January 1864 Pember married Mary Lemmon (née Reynolds). She had been previously married to William Lemmon who died in 1861, and she had two daughters from that marriage. She died on 10 July 1891 and left her estate to her husband George Pember. In 1893 Pember married Elizabeth Ann Smith in Devon, and they resided at Westbourne Terrace, Budleigh Salterton, Devon for the remainder of their lives.\n\nPember's conversion to Christianity led him to participate in the Brethren, and from within that movement he developed his career as an author and teacher of biblical and theological themes. The Brethren emerged in the 1820s as an independent movement that protested about the ecclesiastical divisions of Protestant churches. Prominent leaders within the Brethren such as Anthony Norris Groves, George Müller and John Nelson Darby were persuaded that there were biblical teachings that were overlooked or not consistently taught by the Protestant churches such as practising adult baptism only (hence rejecting infant baptism), restricting the observance of the Lord's Supper (partaking of the emblems of bread and wine representing Jesus Christ's atoning sacrifice) to baptised members, and biblical prophecies about the imminent return of Christ to the world. As the Brethren placed great emphasis on understanding biblical prophecy they believed that current events could be signs or signals that Christ's second coming would occur very soon. As the Brethren upheld strong convictions about living in the end-times, participant members engaged in what they saw as the urgent task of preaching the gospel to persuade other people to become followers of Christ. The approach that the Brethren developed in understanding biblical prophecy is technically known as Dispensationalism.\n\nPember's career as a writer appears to have been very financially successful because in successive UK census records his occupation is described as a man of \"independent means\". The books that he wrote all reflect the distinctive doctrinal themes of the Brethren outlined above. His books \"The Antichrist, Babylon and the Coming Kingdom\", \"The Great Prophecies of the centuries concerning Israel and the Gentiles\", and \"Mystery Babylon the Great\" are examples of Brethren interpretations of biblical prophecies in light of current events, and about the rejection of divisions in the Protestant churches. His book \"The Lord's Command\" is a classic example of Brethren arguments that uphold the need for only adults (believer's baptism) to be baptised and the rejection of the practice of infant baptism.\n\nHis book \"Earth's Earliest Ages\", which went through several editions, had two principal objectives. Pember wrote in the preface to the first edition:\n\"To remove some of the Geological and other difficulties usually associated with the commencing chapters of Genesis\" and \"to show the characteristic features of the Days of Noah were reappearing in Christendom, and therefore, that the Days of the Son of Man could not be far distant.\"\n\nIn this book Pember attempted to reconcile the Genesis account of the world's creation with the emerging fossil evidence in geological science about the age of the earth. Pember argued a position known as \"The Gap Theory\", and which had been previously proposed by the Scottish theologian Thomas Chalmers (1780–1847). In this theory, God originally created the universe but due to the rebellion of some angels led by Lucifer (or Satan) the earth descended into chaos and life was destroyed. Pember's position was that the first chapter of Genesis gave an account of God restoring or recreating the world after the collapse of the original creation. So proponents of the Gap Theory like Pember propose that a \"gap\" exists between the first two verses in Genesis chapter one which allows for all the extra time needed to include the ancient fossil and geological evidences. The geological fossils were creatures that lived in the original creation and were destroyed when Lucifer fell into sin. The biblical story of Adam and Eve is about a later recreation of the world. Pember's argument for the \"Gap Theory\" is an example of how some evangelical Christians in the nineteenth century tried to reconcile geological evidence for an old earth with the book of Genesis and without embracing Charles Darwin's theory about the evolution of the species.\n\nThe other major feature of Pember's \"Earth's Earliest Ages\" was his argument that the emergence of rival non-Christian religious groups were evidence that end times biblical prophecies were being fulfilled. Three particular religious movements were pinpointed as being examples of the spiritual deception that are characteristic of the biblical signs of the end times: the Spiritualist churches, the Theosophical Society, and Buddhism. Pember criticised these three movements on the grounds that their teachings were contradicted by the Bible. These religious groups were classified by Pember as modern-day heresies. Pember's interpretation of the Spiritualist churches and of the Theosophical Society as prophetic signs of anti-Christian spiritual deception represents a nineteenth-century style of argument that has been subsequently developed and refined in Christian Countercult literature. As Pember's book defends the creation account of Genesis and rejects Darwinian evolutionary theory it is a work of Christian apologetics, and the latter part of the book is an early example of that genre of literature produced in evangelical Countercult apologetics.\n\nPember also wrote very briefly about a Christian approach to animal welfare and animal rights, which was becoming a topic of great social concern in Victorian society. What Pember had to say on the subject can be understood on a wide historical canvas. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries human attitudes about the status of animals began to change as theologians and philosophers discussed whether animals were capable of rational thought, had emotions, had a soul, and questions about brutal treatment were also debated. Some theologians began to examine passages of the Bible concerned with the afterlife and the prophesied new heaven and new earth, and as those discussions developed Nathaniel Homes (1654) and Stephen Charnock (1660) argued that animals would be included in the resurrection of the dead. In the eighteenth century the debate was carried forward by both the Anglican Bishop Joseph Butler in his \"Analogy of Religion\" and the Anglican priest and hymn writer Augustus Montague Toplady, both believed in the resurrection of animals, while Toplady regarded brutality towards animals as sin. Other important contributors to the debate were Humphry Primatt (1776), Richard Dean (1767) and John Wesley as they each addressed the problem of brutality to animals in connection with the problem of evil and sin, while both Dean and Wesley held to the resurrection of animals.\n\nBefore Pember wrote about animal rights there had already been many Christians in England involved in protesting against the maltreatment of domestic animals, agitating for legislation against cruelty to animals, and in rejecting the practice of the scientific dissection of living animals called vivisection. An early but failed attempt to pass a Bill against cruelty to animals was initiated by Thomas Erskine (1750–1823). He was a Christian who served in the House of Lords and was also Lord Chancellor in England. In 1809 Erskine \"introduced into the Lords a Bill for the prevention of malicious and wanton cruelty to animals\". Although Erskine's bill was rejected in the House of Commons, a later legislative attempt to punish acts of cruelty to animals was successfully passed by England's parliament in 1822. The architect of that 1822 legislation was the Irish Christian politician Richard Martin. Two years after the passage of Martin's anti-cruelty legislation, a meeting was called on 16 June 1824 for the formation of an organisation to oppose animal cruelty. With the exception of Lewis Gompertz who was a Jew, everyone else who attended the meeting were professing Christians and a new organisation was founded. The principal founding figures were Rev. Arthur Broome, William Wilberforce, Richard Martin and Thomas Fowell Buxton, and the organisation they created became the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in England. Alongside the activities of organisations like the RSPCA, there was a steady stream of books where Christians argued for animal welfare and animal rights, and most writers linked animal rights to theological topics such as whether animals have a soul, that brutality is sin, and if they will be included in the general resurrection of the dead.\n\nSo, it is within that context of Christian thought about animals that Pember contributed a short book \"Animals: Their Past and Present\". He examines the spiritual status of animals in the Bible and explores the duties that humans have towards animals. He argues that humans are made in God's image and likeness and have been given authority by God to rule over the animals (sometimes called dominion). Due to Adam's sin all animals live under the curse. Pember argued that on the basis of several biblical passages in Isaiah 11:6–9, 2 Peter 3 and the book of Revelation that some species of animals will be restored or resurrected to live on the new earth foreshadowed in those biblical books. The nature of animals will be changed so they will no longer be predators, and they will have the capacity for speech. Pember argued that as animals will share in the prophesied new earth that in the present life humans must cease being apathetic about the plight of animals. Humans have responsibilities and duties of care towards animals. Pember's argument about a biblical approach to animal rights as seen from the standpoint of end times prophecy was by no means unique, as some of his Christian contemporaries such as Lutheran authors George N. H. Peters (\"The Theocratic Kingdom\") and Joseph A. Seiss also argued similar points. Likewise, elements of Pember's arguments against brutality to animals had already been anticipated by Christian writers in the previous two hundred years\n\nHe died in July 1910 aged 73 at Budleigh Salterton in Devon.\n\n\n"}

He is an internationally acknowledged expert in quantum mechanics and in the foundation and interpretation of this discipline. His main interests in quantum information led him to focus his further research on the way in which biological and cognitive systems deal with information. He is also active in the field of the dialogue between science, philosophy and theology, and has been the Vice-Director of the international conference on \"Biological Evolution: Facts and Theories\", held at the Pontifical Gregorian University on March 2009.\n\nAuletta graduated from the Sapienza University of Rome where he took his PhD and completed his post-doctoral research work. He is an Aggregate Professor at the Pontifical Gregorian University where, from 2003 to 2012, held the position of Scientific Director of the Specialization in Science and Philosophy. He is also a Senior Researcher at the University of Cassino (Italy).\nFrom 2003 to 2010, Auletta has been the Scientific Coordinator of the STOQ Project (“Science, Theology and the Ontological Quest”, a project under the patronage of the Pontifical Council for Culture involving seven Roman Pontifical Universities and supported by the John Templeton Foundation).\n\nSince 2009, Auletta is a Fellow of the Linnean Society of London and of the International Society for Science and Religion.\n\nOne of the main results of Auletta’s original research on the foundations and interpretation of quantum mechanics is the publication (together with Giorgio Parisi and Mauro Fortunato) of a handbook of \"Quantum Mechanics\", (Cambridge University Press, 2009). Auletta has stressed that there are three basic forms of dealing with information: processing, sharing, selecting. \nThis pathway of research eventually led him to consider quantum information as a fruitful approach for studying the way in which biological and cognitive systems deal with information at all scales. He has now published a book on \"Cognitive Biology\", (Oxford University Press, 2011), in which an attempt is made to show the consistence of such an approach with the recent impressive achievements in life sciences, within the perspective of a thorough reflection on the current paradigm dominating biological disciplines. In particular, Auletta is interested in the relevance of notions like \"information control\", \"functional equivalence class\", \"formal constraints\" and \"top-down causation\" as to the organisms’ capability of dealing with a challenging environment at the ontogenetic and epigenetic levels, eventually leading to the emergence of new biological functionalities at the phylogenetic level. Top-down causation mechanisms via information control may be considered as the way in which initial and random perturbations disturbing the homeostasis of an organism are subsequently framed in the organism’s network of formal constraints thus giving raise to a process of fine-tuning that ends up in an eventual stable form able to realize a new adaptive fit with certain environmental conditions and challenges. Such process of top-down fine-tuning bridging between randomicity and fitness may be at the basis of the emergence of new functionalities at the phylogenetic scale. Top-down causation via information control may also be enquired in developmental and epigenetic processes (as well as in regeneration processes) when the organism is forced to deal with unpredicted, uncontrollable and in principle noxious environmental stimuli. Finally, information control may be assumed to play a fundamental role also in the ontogenetic action of the organism on the environment (e.g. from chemotaxis up to niche construction as well as to planned actions). Accordingly, his efforts are aimed at both developing a theoretical framework and designing possible experiments and research projects based on the latter standpoints.\nRecently, he has published a book on the mechanization of inferences, \"Mechanical Logic in Three-Dimensional Space\", (Pan Stanford Pub., Singapore, 2013). Here a reduction of logic to combinatorics is provided. In particular, a logical 3D space is built as a substrate of the logical algebra. Arithmetic operations on propositions allow a new logical calculus.\n\n\n\n"}

This was especially an issue in the reaction of the early Church to Gnosticism and its dualism, where the creator deity is understood as a demiurge subordinate to the actual, transcendent God.\n\nIn the Hebrew Bible God is depicted as the source of both light and darkness, as in Isaiah 45:6-7. This concept of \"darkness\" or \"evil\" was not yet personified as \"the devil\".\n\nThe author of the Books of Chronicles is thought to have first introduced the notion of \"divine intermediaries\", which was not found in the earlier parts of the Hebrew Bible. The main evidence adduced by theologians to support this is 1 Chronicles 21, a reworked version of 2 Samuel 24.\n\nThis change is made most evident in the Chronicler's treatment of 2 Samuel 24:1:\n\nwhich, in 1 Chronicles 21:1, becomes:\n\nIn the Book of Samuel, YHWH himself is the agent in punishing Israel, while in 1 Chronicles an \"adversary\" is introduced. This is usually taken to be the result of the influence of Persian dualism on Israelite demonology.\n\nScholars are divided on whether in Chronicles, \"the adversary\" had already become a proper name, \"the Adversary\" (Satan). The traditional opinion has been that this is the case, arguing from the absence of the definite article in שטן \"adversary\". S. Japhet in her \"The Ideology of the Book of Chronicles and its Place in Biblical Thought\" (1989) argued against mainstream opinion in suggesting that שטן still had the generic meaning and only became the proper name \"Satan\" at a later date, by about the 2nd century BC.\n\nTertullian accuses Marcion of Sinope, the first major heretic of Christianity in the 1st century, that he \"[held that] the Old Testament was a scandal to the faithful [...] and [...] accounted for it by postulating [that Jehovah was] a secondary deity, a demiurgus, who was god, in a sense, but not the supreme God; he was just, rigidly just, he had his good qualities, but he was not the good god, who was Father of Our Lord Jesus Christ.\" The Church condemned his writings as heretical.\n\nJohn Arendzen (1909) in the Catholic Encyclopedia (1913) mentions that Eusebius accused Apelles, the 2nd-century AD Gnostic, of considering the Inspirer of Old-Testament prophecies to be not a god, but an evil angel.\n\nHegemonius (4th century) accuses the Persian prophet Mani, founder of the Manichaean sect in the 3rd century AD, identified Jehovah as \"the devil god which created the world\" and said that \"he who spoke with Moses, the Jews, and the priests [...] is the [Prince] of Darkness, [...] not the god of truth.\"\n\nAccording to their critics, these heretics referred to the Abrahamic God variously as \"a demiurgus\", \"an evil angel\", \"the devil god\", \"the Prince of Darkness\", \"the source of all evil\",\n\"the Devil\",\n\"a demon\", \"a cruel, wrathful, warlike tyrant\", \"Satan\"\nand \"the first beast of the book of Revelation\".\n\nNicholas Weber in the Catholic Encyclopedia article \"Albigenses\" (1907) notes that the enemies of the Albigenses, a Christian sect in 12th- and 13th-century France, a branch of the Cathari, accused them that their doctrine held that \"the creator [...] of the material world [...] is the source of all evil [...] He created the human body and is the author of sin [...] The Old Testament must be either partly or entirely ascribed to him; whereas the New Testament is the revelation of the beneficent God.\" They ultimately came into conflict with both the civil order and the Church which led to the Albigensian Crusade.\n\n"}

Since writing in gyaru-moji requires extra effort, and due to the perception of confidentiality, sending gyaru-moji messages to a peer is seen as a sign of informality or friendship. The origin of this style is unclear but it has been proposed that magazines targeted at teenage girls first made it popular, and the phenomenon started to gain wider attention in media around 2002.\n\nThe style has been met with increasing criticism, as its use continues to expand. Reported instances of girls using the writing in school work, OLs (Office Ladies) adopting the style in the workplace, and gyaru-moji being used in karaoke subtitling, are examples of this. Laura Miller has analyzed gyaru moji as an example of gender resistance.\n\nLike leet, gyaru-moji replaces characters with visually similar characters or combinations of characters. Hiragana consisting of connected strokes are replaced by symbols or Greek letters: for example, す (\"su\") may be rendered as the section symbol codice_1. Hiragana consisting of detached elements are replaced by sequences of kana, Western letters, or symbols. For example, ほ (\"ho\") may be typed as codice_2 (vertical bar and hiragana \"ma\") or codice_3 (open parenthesis and \"ma\"), け (\"ke\") may be typed as codice_4 (katakana \"re na\"), codice_5 (capital i, \"na\"), or codice_6 (open parenthesis, dagger), and た (ta) may be typed as codice_7 (katakana \"na\", equals sign) or codice_8 (dagger, hiragana \"ko\"). Katakana is frequently replaced by similar-looking kanji, such as 世 for セ (se) or 干 for チ (chi), in a reversal of the process that turned man'yōgana into kana. Kana and rōmaji may be mixed freely, even within a word, and Latin letters in rōmaji may be replaced with similar-looking Cyrillic letters, such as replacing N with И (Cyrillic I). Compound kanji are decomposed into left and right elements, which are written as individual kanji or kana. For example, the kanji 好 in 好き, meaning \"like, enjoy\" may be split into 女子 (the kanji for woman and child, respectively).\n\nIn addition to the basic obfuscation provided by character replacement, another technique used to disguise the content of the message is to use vocabulary and grammar that is uncharacteristic of standard usage. Combined with character substitution, this can make the meaning of the message almost unintelligible to those not “in the know”. This is analogous to the use of leet’s specialized grammar. However, the flexible nature of the Japanese language means that although gyaru-moji phrases sound peculiar to someone expecting formal or even commonly colloquial Japanese, they are often technically still grammatically correct.\n\nFor example, the sentence (“Watashi wa ima totemo yoi kibun desu.”) is “Right now I am feeling very good.” in standard normal-polite Japanese.\nBy first rewording this as or (“Chōkimochi ii!”) – which roughly translates as “(I have a) Super good feeling!” – and then converting to gyaru-moji to get or , the message could prove difficult for those not versed in the style to understand.\n\nThe original Japanese hiragana followed by romaji, and then various versions of the Japanese character in gyaru moji. The following chart is also available .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are some examples of gyaru-moji created from compound kanji. The kanji characters are followed by their reading and meaning, and the gyaru-moji derived from them:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "47067336", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47067336", "title": "Laudato si'", "text": "Laudato si'\n\nLaudato si (Medieval Central Italian for \"Praise Be to You\") is the second encyclical of Pope Francis. The encyclical has the subtitle \"On care for our common home\". In it, the Pope critiques consumerism and irresponsible development, laments environmental degradation and global warming, and calls all people of the world to take \"swift and unified global action.\"\n\nThe encyclical, dated 24 May 2015, was officially published at noon on 18 June 2015, accompanied by a news conference. The Vatican released the document in Italian, German, English, Spanish, French, Polish, Portuguese and Arabic, alongside the original Latin.\n\nThe encyclical is the second published by Francis, after \"Lumen fidei\" (\"The Light of Faith\"), which was released in 2013. Since \"Lumen fidei\" was largely the work of Francis's predecessor Benedict XVI, \"Laudato si\" is generally viewed as the first encyclical that is entirely the work of Francis.\n\nThe title of the social encyclical is an Umbrian phrase from Saint Francis of Assisi's 13th-century \"Canticle of the Sun\" (also called the Canticle of the Creatures), a poem and prayer in which God is praised for the creation of the different creatures and aspects of the Earth.\n\nThe tone of the Pope's phrasing has been described as \"cautious and undogmatic, and he specifically calls for discussion and dialogue.\" For example, he states in the encyclical (#188):\nThere are certain environmental issues where it is not easy to achieve a broad consensus. Here I would state once more that the Church does not presume to settle scientific questions or to replace politics. But I am concerned to encourage an honest and open debate so that particular interests or ideologies will not prejudice the common good.\nHe adds that \"Although the post-industrial period may well be remembered as one of the most irresponsible in history, nonetheless there is reason to hope that humanity at the dawn of the twenty-first century will be remembered for having generously shouldered its grave responsibilities.\" Francis does state that concern for the natural world is no longer \"'optional' but is an integral part of the Church teaching on social justice.\"\n\nFrancis reportedly has said that the encyclical was not really an environmental document at all. The warming of the planet is a symptom of a greater problem: the developed world's indifference to the destruction of the planet as they pursue short-term economic gains. This has resulted in a \"throwaway culture\" in which unwanted items and unwanted people, such as the unborn, the elderly, and the poor, are discarded as waste. This subtext makes the document \"more profoundly subversive\" than it appears on the surface.\n\nThe real problem, according to Francis, lies in the fact that humans no longer see God as the Creator. Thus we see \"other living beings as mere objects subjected to arbitrary human domination\" and do not realize that \"the ultimate purpose of other creatures is not found in us.\" Francis says that instead of viewing humanity as having \"dominion\" over the earth, we must see that everything is interconnected and that all of creation is a \"kind of universal family\". Nature cannot be seen as something apart from humanity, or merely the place where we live. He says that our social and environmental crises are thus one complex crisis that must be solved holistically.\n\nFrancis \"pulls no punches\" when lamenting pollution, climate change, a lack of clean water, loss of biodiversity, and an overall decline in human life and a breakdown of society. \"Never have we so hurt and mistreated our common home as we have in the last two hundred years,\" he states.\n\nHe \"describe[s] a relentless exploitation and destruction of the environment, for which he blamed apathy, the reckless pursuit of profits, excessive faith in technology and political shortsightedness.\" \"Laudato si\"' \"unambiguously accepts the scientific consensus that changes in the climate are largely man-made\" and states that \"climate change is a global problem with grave implications: environmental, social, economic, political and for the distribution of goods. It represents one of the principal challenges facing humanity in our day\" and warns of \"unprecedented destruction of ecosystems, with serious consequence for all of us\" if prompt climate change mitigation efforts are not undertaken.\n\nThe encyclical highlights the role of fossil fuels in causing climate change. \"We know that technology based on the use of highly polluting fossil fuels – especially coal, but also oil and, to a lesser degree, gas – needs to be progressively replaced without delay,\" Francis says. \"Until greater progress is made in developing widely accessible sources of renewable energy, it is legitimate to choose the less harmful alternative or to find short-term solutions.\" The encyclical's comments on climate change are consistent with the scientific consensus on climate change.\n\nThe encyclical states that developed nations are morally obligated to assist developing nations in combating the climate-change crisis. Poor nations, the pontiff says, are ill-prepared to adapt to the effects of climate change and will bear the brunt of its effects. Linking the issues of poverty, which has been a major issue in his papacy, and the environment, he insists that the world must \"hear both the cry of the earth and the cry of the poor.\"\n\nHe does not believe, according to R. R. Reno, that \"for all our flaws, Western societies are more democratic, more egalitarian, and more inclusive than any in history.\" Citing the New Zealand Bishops Conference \"Statement on Environmental Issues\", Francis asks \"what the commandment 'Thou shall not kill' means when 'twenty percent of the world's population consumes resources at a rate that robs the poor nations and future generations of what they need to survive.'\"\n\n\"Science and religion, with their distinctive approaches to understanding reality, can enter into an intense dialogue fruitful for both,\" according to the pontiff. Religions, including Christianity, can make \"rich contributions ... towards an integral ecology and the full development of humanity,\" However, \"the scientific and experimental method\" itself can be part of the problem when it decouples creation from the Creator.\n\nThe editor of \"First Things\" R. R. Reno critiques the encyclical, writing \"Laudato si\"' makes \"many fierce denunciations of the current global order.\" This global order \"destroys the environment, oppresses the multitudes, and makes us blind to the beauty of creation.\" According to Reno, the critiques of the scientific and technocratic present contained in the encyclical make this \"perhaps the most anti-modern encyclical since the Syllabus of Errors, Pius IX's haughty 1864 dismissal of the conceits of the modern era.\" He adds that the encyclical's tone lacks elements commonly found in the works of John Paul II and Benedict XVI that, in the tradition of Gaudium et Spes, would have affirmed the modern world while correcting its errors.\n\nModern technology, the \"dominant technological paradigm\", is seen as a key contributor to the environmental crisis and human suffering. \"The technological paradigm has become so dominant that it would be difficult to do without its resources and even more difficult to utilize them without being dominated by their internal logic. It has become countercultural to choose a lifestyle whose goals are even partly independent of technology… Technology tends to absorb everything into its ironclad logic, and those who are surrounded with technology 'know full well that it moves forward in the final analysis neither for profit nor for the well-being of the human race.'\"\n\nTechnology is not value neutral and technological developments are directed by the profit motive, according to Pope Francis. This is a form of institutionalized greed, generally with little regard for environmental and social consequences. \"The economy accepts every advance in technology with a view to profit, without concern for its potentially negative impact on human beings\". The encyclical warns against \"blind confidence in technical solutions,\" particularly in view of the fact that \"the specialization which belongs to technology makes it difficult to see the large picture,\" which \"can actually become a form of ignorance.\" As a result, many technological solutions are nothing more than short-term techno-fixes attempting to remove symptoms rather than addressing the underlying environmental, social, economic, and even moral and spiritual problems: \"Technology, which, linked to business interests, is presented as the only way of solving these problems, in fact proves incapable of seeing the mysterious network of relations between things and so sometimes solves one problem only to create others.\"\n\nGiven these significant short-comings of technology, \"scientific and technological progress cannot be equated with progress of humanity and history,\" and we are deluded by the myth of progress to believe that \"ecological problems will solve themselves simply with the application of new technology and without need for ethical consideration or deep change.\" A profound redefinition of progress and \"liberation from the dominant technocratic paradigm\" are needed, i.e., \"we have the freedom needed to limit and direct technology; we can put it at the service of another type of progress, one which is healthier, more human, more social, more integral.\" More fundamentally, according to the pontiff, we need to recognize that \"technology severed from ethics will not easily be able to limit its own power,\" and that \"the most extraordinary scientific advances, the most amazing technical abilities, the most astonishing economic growth, unless they are accompanied by authentic social and moral progress, will definitively turn against man.\" Pope Francis adds that the environmental crisis can ultimately only be solved if our immense technological developments are accompanied by a \"development in human responsibility, values, and conscience.\"\n\nAccording to a \"New York Times\" summary, the encyclical is \"sweeping\" in scope and is wide-ranging (80 pages/45,000 words), including mentions of such topics as urban planning, agricultural economics, and biodiversity.\n\nThe encyclical also gives voice to the Pope's opposition to abortion, embryonic stem cell research and population control – saying that respect for creation and human dignity go hand in hand. \"Since everything is interrelated,\" Francis says, \"concern for the protection of nature is also incompatible with the justification of abortion.\" According to the Pope, we can't in fact \"genuinely teach the importance of concern for other vulnerable beings, however troublesome or inconvenient they may be, if we fail to protect a human embryo, even when its presence is uncomfortable and creates difficulties.\"\n\n\"Laudato si\"' opposes gender theory and supports \"valuing one's own body in its femininity or masculinity.\" In acknowledging differences, the Pope states \"we can joyfully accept the specific gifts of another man or woman, the work of God the Creator, and find mutual enrichment.\"\n\nThe encyclical has 172 footnoted citations, many to Francis's immediate predecessors, John Paul II and Benedict XVI. The encyclical also \"draws prominently from\" Bartholomew I of Constantinople, the patriarch of the Eastern Orthodox Church of Constantinople and an ally of the pope. It is highly unusual to quote an Orthodox bishop in a papal document. More than 10% of the footnotes, 21, cite documents from 16 bishops' conferences around the world, mostly from the global south. This is the first encyclical to cite bishops' conferences. This was an effort, experts believe, to build alliances on a controversial topic. The encyclical also cites Saint Thomas Aquinas; Ali al-Khawas, a 9th-century Sufi mystic; Pierre Teilhard de Chardin; and Romano Guardini.\n\nSpeculation about an \"environmental encyclical\" to be issued by Pope Francis first began in November 2013. On 24 January 2014, the Vatican confirmed that drafting had begun. The Rev. Federico Lombardi, the Holy See Press Office director, said that the document was in its very early stages, that no publication date had been set, and that the encyclical would be about ecology (and specifically the \"ecology of man\").\n\nCardinal Peter Turkson, the president of the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace, and his team wrote the first draft of the encyclical. The draft was later reviewed by several theologians as well and sent (about three weeks before the encyclical's release) to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the second section of the Secretariat of State, and the theologian of the Papal Household. Edits were made based on their responses.\n\nIn drafting the encyclical, the Vatican consulted with leading scientific experts for months. One of the experts consulted was Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, the founder and head of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and chair of the German Advisory Council on Global Change.\n\nOn 28 April 2015, in advance of the encyclical's release, the Vatican hosted a one-day conference on climate change, featuring Turkson, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon (who delivered the keynote address), Ecuadorian president Rafael Correa and American economist Jeffrey Sachs.\n\nThe title and subtitle of the encyclical were first reported on in a Twitter message by Spanish-language journalist Mercedes De La Torre on 30 May 2015. The Vatican confirmed that the title would be \"Laudato si' \" on 10 June. While some initial reports said the encyclical would be called \"Laudato Sii\", this was incorrect; the pope chose to use the original Umbrian form and spelling of the poem, with a single \"i\".\n\nOn 4 June, the Vatican press office announced that the encyclical – which was \"already attracting global attention for its expected discourses on Catholic theology on ecology, current environmental destruction, and climate change\" – would be released on 18 June.\n\nFour days before the encyclical's release, the Italian magazine \"L'Espresso\" posted a leaked draft of the document online. The leaked document \"almost exactly matched\" the final document. The leak angered Vatican officials who called it a \"heinous act\" and revoked the press credentials of the longtime \"L'Espresso\" Vatican correspondent Sandro Magister. The \"New York Times\" and the Italian newspaper \"La Stampa\" both noted suggestions that the leak came from conservatives inside the Vatican who wished to embarrass the pope and hinder the rollout of the encyclical.\n\nThe encyclical letter was officially released at an event in the New Synod Hall of the Vatican City. Speaking at the press conference were Turkson, Schellnhuber, and John Zizioulas (the metropolitan of Pergamon, representing the Orthodox Church). On the day of the encyclical's official release, Pope Francis issued two messages about it on his official Twitter account, @Pontifex. It has been suggested that the encyclical's release was timed to influence three summits being held at the United Nations on financial aid, sustainable development and climate change later in 2015.\n\nAfter the encyclical was released, the Vatican's website was briefly inaccessible as many people tried to read it. It has been described as \"one of the shrewdest documents issued by the Vatican during the past century\" and \"has revealed Francis as a wily and sophisticated politician of the first order.\" It contains, according to Paul Vallely, \"a raft of defenses against critics who dismiss it as the work of some kind of left-wing maverick.\"\n\nThe United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, led by its president Joseph Edward Kurtz, the archbishop of Louisville, described the encyclical as \"our marching orders for advocacy\" and planned briefings on the encyclical with both chambers of Congress and with the White House. Cardinal Sean O'Malley of Boston said that the \"constant linkage throughout the encyclical of the dual need to respect and protect \"Our Common Home\" and the need to respect and protect the dignity and lives of the poor may be regarded as the distinctive characteristic of this powerful message of Pope Francis.\"\n\nFilipino Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle, the Archbishop of Manila, wrote that \"In \"Laudato si\"' Pope Francis reminds us to replace consumption with a sense of sacrifice, greed with generosity and wastefulness with a spirit of sharing. We must \"give, and not simply give up.\" We are called to free ourselves from all that is heavy and negative and wasteful and to enter into dialogue with our global family.\"\n\nThe three bishops of Northern and Central California, Stephen Blaire, Armando Xavier Ochoa, and Jaime Soto, issued a joint statement that highlighted how climate change disproportionately affects the poor. \"The Catholic perspective is that human and natural ecology go hand in hand,\" the trio said. \"We are called to solidarity with the poor as well as stewardship of the Earth. Our deep regard for the dignity of every person commands us to cultivate a climate of life where each of God's children thrive and join with creation in praising our Creator. This is the 'integral ecology' of which Pope Francis speaks.\"\n\nBishop Richard Pates of Des Moines, Iowa, which has the first major presidential primary contest in the United States, called on candidates to show courage and leadership on the issue, saying \"With presidential candidates already visiting us regularly, I encourage Catholics across our state, and all people of good will, to talk to them and ask not if, but how, they plan to work toward solutions to climate change.\"\n\nGerman Archbishop of Hamburg Stefan Heße praised the encyclical, calling it \"valuable momentum for a worldwide ecological reorientation.\" He commented further, saying:He makes it clear that urgent issues of the future for the whole world and for all human beings have to be solved. Without a radical change of mentality, it will not do. Thus he underlines that the problems that concern all can be solved only by all.Vaticanologist John L. Allen, Jr., said in an analysis, \"\"Laudato si\"' seems destined to go down as a major turning point, the moment when environmentalism claimed pride of place on a par with the dignity of human life and economic justice as a cornerstone of Catholic social teaching. It also immediately makes the Catholic Church arguably the leading moral voice in the press to combat global warming and the consequences of climate change.\"\n\nCatholic Millennials have written widely giving their opinions of the encyclical.\n\nSamuel Gregg, director of research at the libertarian Acton Institute, has criticized \"the sheer overreach that plagues\" \"Laudato si\"'. RealClearReligion editor Nicholas Hahn has said that \"Good Catholics can disagree on how to combat climate change and shouldn't worry about being sent to the confessional if they drive a SUV.\"\n\nThis criticism comes despite the fact that Francis took \"care to locate his text firmly in the substantial body of teaching set out by previous popes,\" especially John Paul II and Benedict XVI, who are especially admired by conservative Catholics.\n\nThree days before the encyclical was released, the 14th Dalai Lama issued a Twitter message stating: \"Since climate change and the global economy now affect us all, we have to develop a sense of the oneness of humanity.\"\n\nTwo days before the encyclical was released, Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, head of the Anglican Communion, issued a \"green declaration\" (also signed by the Methodist Conference as well as representatives of the Catholic Church in England and Wales and the British Muslim, Sikh and Jewish communities) urging a transition to a low-carbon economy and fasting and prayer for success at the December 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris.\n\nThe same day, the Lausanne Movement of global evangelical Christians said it was anticipating the encyclical and was grateful for it. The encyclical was also welcomed by the World Council of Churches and the Christian Reformed Church in North America.\n\nThe Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, welcomed the encyclical in a statement on the day it was released. Kofi Annan, the former UN secretary-general and current chair of the Africa Progress Panel, also issued a statement in support of the encyclical, stating \"As Pope Francis reaffirms, climate change is an all-encompassing threat. … I applaud the Pope for his strong moral and ethical leadership. We need more of such inspired leadership. Will we see it at the climate summit in Paris?\"\n\nChristiana Figueres, the executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, said: \"Pope Francis is personally committed to this issue like no other pope before him. I do think the encyclical is going to have a major impact. It will speak to the moral imperative of addressing climate change in a timely fashion in order to protect the most vulnerable.\"\n\nOn the same day, Jim Yong Kim, the president of the World Bank Group, also praised the encyclical.\n\nScience historian Naomi Oreskes observes that \"Laudato si\"' \"insists we embrace the moral dimensions of problems that have heretofore been viewed primarily as scientific, technological, and economic.\"\n\nThe encyclical gave a boost to the fossil fuel divestment movement. Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, the founding director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) and chair of the German Advisory Council on Global Change, who advised the Vatican on the drafting of the encyclical, said that \"the science of \"Laudato si' \" is watertight\" and gave the pontiff an \"A\" for command of the subject.\n\nAn editorial in \"Nature\" praised the encyclical for its statements about sustainability and global poverty and the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources: \"The papal calls to end poverty and share the world's ecological space in a fair way are objectives that mirror the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, to be released in September. The Pope's letter adds an important facet to the discussion: it is not merely conceivable to secure a sound future for human civilization without relying on coal, oil and gas – it is a prerequisite.\" However it criticized Francis for ignoring important issues like family planning and birth control. \"Alas, he remained silent on issues of contraception. With a world population heading towards a possible 10 billion, the importance of family planning is clear. The Vatican has been brave on climate change. If it is serious about the fate of the planet and the welfare of its inhabitants, then it must be braver still on the issue of contraception.\"\n\nA review by nine climate scientists under the Climate Feedback project concluded the encyclical \"rather accurately depicts the current reality of climate change\" and \"fairly represents the present concerns raised by the scientific community.\"\n\nNicholas Stern, chair of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment and author of an influential report on climate change, stated that \"The publication of the Pope's encyclical is of enormous significance. He has shown great wisdom and leadership. Pope Francis is surely absolutely right that climate change raises vital moral and ethical issues... Moral leadership on climate change from the Pope is particularly important because of the failure of many heads of state and government around the world to show political leadership.\"\nLeading ecological economist and steady-state theorist Herman Daly praised the Pope's encyclical on the grounds that it \"... unifies the main divisions of Christianity on at least the fundamental recognition that we have a shamefully neglected duty to care for the Earth out of which we evolved, and to share the Earth's life support more equitably with each other, with the future, and with other creatures.\" Daly even believes that the Pope \"skates fairly close to the idea of steady-state economics,\" although the important issues of population stabilization, responsible family planning and contraception were \"conspicuously near-absent\" in the encyclical.\n\nStephen F. Schneck, the director of Institute for Policy Research & Catholic Studies at The Catholic University of America, has said that \"Something's going to come out of this and it's definitely going to have an impact on public policy in the US.\" However, Kathy Saile, the former long time director of the US bishops' office for domestic social justice, does not believe that \"it will spark a climate change bill, but someday when negotiations are happening on a bill or a treaty, these kinds of moral teachings could have an influence.\" Nonetheless, she added, \"Pope Francis's tone, his honesty, how he talks about mercy and care for the poor, and his genuine desire to be a bridge,\" could influence political culture in Washington. \"If he could change the tone of the debate, that would be an amazing gift.\"\n\nMiami Archbishop Thomas Wenski, chairman of the US bishops' committee on domestic peace and justice, wrote a letter to Congress letting them know that \"The U.S. bishops stand united with the Holy Father in his call to protect creation.\" He also asked them to \"resist any effort to impair the development of a national carbon standard and instead to support our nation's ability to address this urgent global challenge confronting the human family.\" Schneck opined that \"This is different than the normal letters that the USCCB sends over all the time on a variety of issues. It really transcends the fault lines of both US politics and politics around the world.\"\n\nCornell anthropologists Annelise Riles and Vincent Ialenti told NPR.org: \"We find \"Laudato Si\"' important because it defies the United States' political imagination at every turn. In some moments, the pope reads like an archconservative, in other moments an archliberal. Sometimes he defers to scientists, other times he quotes scripture and, still other times, he criticizes the very foundations of economics. Mixing together ideas many see as incompatible, he forces us to think.\"\n\n\"The New York Times\" reported that the encyclical put pressure on Catholics seeking the Republican Party nomination for president of the United States in 2016, including Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, and Rick Santorum, who \"have questioned or denied the established science of human-caused climate change, and have harshly criticized policies designed to tax or regulate the burning of fossil fuels.\" Jeb Bush said: \"I hope I'm not going to get castigated for saying this by my priest back home, but I don't get economic policy from my bishops or my cardinal or my pope.\"\n\nNeoconservative circles in the United States have criticized the encyclical right from its publication in Rome, sometimes in very harsh terms. Writing in the \"Weekly Standard\", Irwin M. Stelzer has argued that\nPope Francis is unambiguously opposed to the American system of \"savage capitalism\". He has famously quoted a fourth century Doctor of the Church, St. Basil of Caesarea, who called money \"the devil's dung\", has railed against the \"anonymous influences of mammon\" and a \"new colonialism\" that includes \"free trade treaties... [and] imposition of austerity,\" and stated a preference for \"cooperatives\". Throw in Francis' views that we are witnessing \"a disturbing warming of the climatic system... due to the great concentration of greenhouse gasses,\" and that \"there is an urgent need of a true world political authority,\" and you have positions that it will take more than a spoonful of the Pontiff's charm to make go down the throats of many Americans.\nA lobbyist of Arch Coal sent an email to Republican lawmakers stating the pope \"does not appear to address the tragedy of global energy poverty.\" The lobbyist argued the church should promote fossil fuels instead if he really cared about the poor. The email suggested \"talking points\" to the legislators for defending the coal industry and rejecting the arguments of the pope. The lobbyist wrote: \"Billions of people around the globe are living without electrification and suffering through untold poverty and disease as a result.\" In contrast to these arguments the encyclical argues that fossil fuels in general and coal in particular threaten the poor: Fossil fuels are a threat to prosperity for the poor. They would suffer even more in particular from sea level rise, droughts, warming and extreme weather caused by burning fossil fuels.\n\nThe LGBT-interest magazine \"The Advocate\" noted that the encyclical contains passages which reinforce the church's position against the transsexuality movement, calling for \"the acceptance of our bodies as God's gift.\"\n\nBill McKibben in \"The New York Review of Books\" reviewed the encyclical.\n\nOn behalf of the Diocese of Limburg, Peter Reulein wrote the music for the oratorio \"Laudato si' – a Franciscan Magnificat\" to the libretto by Helmut Schlegel OFM. This work is based on the Latin version of the Magnificat, corresponds to the \"Extraordinary Jubilee of Mercy,\" and includes texts from the apostolic exhortation \"Evangelii gaudium\" and the encyclical \"Laudato si\"'. The premiere of the oratorio took place in the Limburg Cathedral on 6 November 2016.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "846764", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=846764", "title": "Liberalism in the Netherlands", "text": "Liberalism in the Netherlands\n\nLiberalism in the Netherlands started as an anti-monarchical effort spearheaded by the Dutch statesman Thorbecke, who almost single-handedly wrote the 1848 Constitution of the Netherlands that turned the country into a constitutional monarchy. \n\nIn contemporary politics, there are both left and right-wing parties that refer to themselves as \"liberal\", with the former more often espousing social liberalism and the latter more often espousing classical liberalism. A common characteristic of these parties that they are nominally irreligious, in contrast to the traditionally dominant and still popular Christian parties.\n\nThis article gives an overview of liberalism in the Netherlands. It is limited to political parties with substantial support, mainly proved by having had a representation in parliament. \n\nThe Netherlands has a long liberal political tradition. From the founding of the Dutch Republic in the 16th century to beginning of the 19th century the main political conflict was between the liberal urban patriciate and the supporters of the House of Orange, from the lower class and orthodox variants of Protestantism. The urban patriciate favoured religious tolerance. Between mid-19th century to the late-1800 they were a dominant force in shaping the Dutch parliamentary democratic \"rechtsstaat\". In the early 20th century the liberals split between progressive liberals and conservative liberals. Due to their political division and the introduction of universal suffrage the liberals disappeared from the political stage. After the Second World War the liberals were united again under one roof, the VVD, but the party remained small. It entered some administration coalitions as a junior party. A progressive liberal party, D'66 was founded in 1966. Since the 1970s however liberalism has been on the rise again electorally. Since 1977 the largest, more conservative, liberal party, VVD has been in government for twenty two years. In early 21st century the VVD saw major splits over the issue of integration and migration. In 2010, they won the national elections for the first time in its history.\n\nIn the early years of the Kingdom of the Netherlands (1814–1848) the House of Representatives was dominated by conservatives supportive of the policy of government of William I and later William II. From 1840 onward, the amount of liberals in the House gradually increased. These liberals advocated a parliamentary democracy with a directly elected House of Representatives and in which the ministers, not the King, had executive power. In 1844, nine liberal representatives led by the jurist and historian Johan Rudolph Thorbecke attempted in vain to amend the constitution and introduce parliamentary democracy. In 1848, amidst a wave of revolutions across Europe, the balance of power shifted in favour of the liberals. In order to prevent civil unrest in the Netherlands, William II formed a commission, chaired by Thorbecke, which would draft a new constitution. The new constitution, which was introduced in October 1848, limited the power of the king by introducing ministerial responsibility and by giving parliament the right to amend laws and hold investigative hearings. It also extended the census suffrage and codified civil rights, such as the freedom of assembly, the privacy of correspondence, freedom of ecclesiastical organisation and the freedom of education.\n\nIn the period following the constitutional amendment, liberalism was the dominant political force in the Netherlands. Liberalism also dominated the universities, the media and business. The liberals supported a laissez-faire economy, free trade, civil rights and a gradual expansion of suffrage. Thorbecke became Prime Minister of the Netherlands in 1849, and would serve two more terms throughout his lifetime. Because of their dominant position, the liberals did not deem it necessary to organise themselves in a political party. Instead there was a loose liberal parliamentary group and locally organised liberal caucuses. The liberals also did not organize their own pillar, a system of like-minded social organisations. The liberals were politically allied with the Catholics, whom the liberals granted considerable freedom of religion. After Thorbecke's death in 1872, the liberals grew increasingly disunited. By 1897, a division had emerged between the supporters of the progressive liberal Jan Kappeyne van de Coppello on the one side, and those of the conservative liberal Johan George Gleichman on the other.\n\nOnly in the late 19th century, when the opposition began to organise itself in the Anti-Revolutionary Party and the Roman Catholic State Party, the liberals followed suit. On 4 March 1885, the Liberal Union was established. In the 1890s some liberals, such as Samuel van Houten, Johannes Tak van Poortvliet and Kappeyne van de Coppello started to propose a more active role of the government, breaking with the Thorbeckian laissez-faire ideal. This led to the establishment of the progressive Free-thinking Democratic League in 1901. The liberals saw a second split with the establishment of the more conservative liberal League of Free Liberals in 1906. There are different names for these two tendencies. The more progressive liberals have been called \"radical\", \"freeminded\" or \"democratic\" liberals, while the more conservative liberals have been called \"free\" or \"old\" liberals. The issue which divided the liberals most was the question whether to extend the census or even to introduce universal suffrage, the progressive liberals favoured universal suffrage, the conservative liberals did not. The progressive liberals also favoured government intervention in the economy, such as Van Houten's ban on child labour.\n\nDue to the two round electoral system the liberals were required to cooperate. In order to prevent the coalition of Catholics and Protestants win the second round of the elections, all the liberals united behind their candidates in the second round, often joined by social democrats. This alliance was called the concentration. On basis of concentration pluralities, often supported by social democrats for a majority several cabinets were formed in the early 20th century.\n\nIn 1917 under one of these liberal minority cabinets universal male suffrage was introduced, as well as a proportional electoral system and equal finance for religious schools, this compromise was called the pacification of 1917. The extension of suffrage however severely weakened the position of the liberals. Of the 37 seats they had in 1917, they were left with 14 in 1918.\n\nIn 1922 the liberal parties reorganized: all conservative liberals, from the Liberal Union and the League Free Liberals as well as more conservative liberals from smaller parties, joined to form the Liberal State Party. The progressive liberals remained separate in the Freeminded Democratic League, a merger of the Radical League and progressive liberals, that had already been formed in 1901. In the interbellum the liberals grew even smaller. Under pressure of the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the rise of the National Socialist Movement. The liberals did cooperate as junior partners in several cabinets in the crisis.\n\nAfter the Second World War the conservative liberal Liberal State Party refounded itself as Freedom Party. The progressive liberal Freeminded Democratic League joined the new \"Doorbraak\" leftwing Labour Party. Several progressives were unhappy with the social-democratic course of the PvdA and joined the Freedom Party to found the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy in 1948.\n\nThe VVD remained a small party until the 1970s, with about 10% of the vote. They did however form part of the government both in the grand coalition with social-democrats, Catholics and Protestants in the late 1940s early 1950s, and with the Catholics and Protestants over the course of the 1960s. The party was led by the former leader of the Freeminded Democratic League, Pieter Oud. In the Dutch pillarized political system the liberals mainly appealed to urban, secular upper and middle class. The liberals did not have a strong pillar of social organization, such as trade unions and news papers, like the other political families had. Instead they were aligned with the weak neutral pillar\n\nIn 1966 a radical democratic party was founded, Democrats 66. In the foundation several progressive liberals from the VVD had been involved. The party sought to radically democratize the political system, the society and the economy. D66 was led by the charismatic Hans van Mierlo. The party joined forces with the social-democratic PvdA and the progressive Christian PPR to work for a more fair and democratic Netherlands. The party participated in the leftwing cabinet Den Uyl. Over the course of the 1980s however the party began to espouse a more progressive liberal course, especially under Jan Terlouw. The party remained an ally of the PvdA however, joining a short-lived centre-left coalition cabinet with the PvdA and the Christian democratic CDA in 1981.\n\nIn the meanwhile the VVD had grown considerably. Under the leadership of Hans Wiegel the VVD has taken a more conservative course. The party began to criticize the large and inefficient welfare state. The party combined this economic liberalism with progressive positions on social issues, which characterized the 1970s, such as abortion, homosexuality and women's rights. The VVD capitalized the weakening of religious and depillarization of the 1970s and made considerable electoral gains: in 1967 the party won just over 10% in 1981 this had more than doubled to 23%.\n\nBetween 1982 and 1986 the VVD cooperated in the centre-right cabinets Lubbers, which implemented a far reaching reform of the welfare state the VVD had advocated since the 1970s.\n\nIn 1994 the Christian democratic CDA lost its traditional electoral power base. The VVD and D66 won considerably. A progressive purple cabinet was formed by D66, the VVD and the PvdA. The cabinet managed a thriving Dutch economy, implemented progressive social legislation on euthanasia, gay marriage and prostitution. In the 2002 election campaign the purple coalition came under heavy criticism of the populist politician Pim Fortuyn for mismanaging the public sector, migration and the integration of migrants. The two liberal parties lost considerably in the elections. Liberalism in the Netherlands came under attack after the shock assassination of Fortuyn just days before the election.\n\nThe VVD however joined a coalition cabinet with the heirs of Fortuyn and the CDA. The cabinet fell shortly. After the 2003 elections the D66 replaced the LPF. The centre-right cabinet implemented reforms of the welfare state and oversaw declining migration figures.\n\nThe issue of migration and integration however, and especially the place of the Islam in the Netherlands. In 2003 the VVD had invited social-democratic critic of Islam, Ayaan Hirsi Ali to join their parliamentary party. She together with MP Geert Wilders caused considerable controversy with her direct criticism of the Islam. In the cabinet VVD minister Rita Verdonk sought to limit migration and stimulate integration of minorities. Two years after Fortuyn's assassination, another murder, this time of filmmaker Theo van Gogh, put the country's liberal tradition at further risk.\n\nIn 2004 Geert Wilders left the VVD to form the Party for Freedom, which combined uncompromising criticism of Islam with a plea for lower taxation and skepticism towards European integration. In 2006 a conflict between Hirsi Ali and Verdonk over her status as an asylum seeker caused the downfall of the cabinet after D66 had revoked its confidence of Verdonk, whose positions on migration the party had already distanced itself from.\n\nIn the 2006 general election the VVD and D66 lost considerably: D66 lost three of its six seats, the VVD six of its 28 seats. Wilders' PVV won nine seats. Rita Verdonk, second on the list of the VVD won more preference votes than the party's top candidate Mark Rutte. After demanding the leadership of the party, Verdonk left the VVD to form her own nationalist party, Proud of the Netherlands.\n\nIn the European Parliament election of 2009, the VVD and D66 both won 3 seats each, while PVV picked up 4 seats. The PVV will be assigned the additional seat that becomes the Netherlands after the Treaty of Lisbon is signed. The VVD and D66 joined the Liberal fraction in the European Parliament, while the PVV did not register as member of any fraction.\n\nIn the 2010 general election the VVD became the largest party with 31 seats, making a liberal-led coalition a possibility for the first time since 1918. Also D66 increased their number of seats to 10. Ultimately, the VVD opted for a coalition with the CDA, with VVD leader Mark Rutte as prime minister—the first liberal to hold the post since 1918.\n\nNote: The ⇒ sign denotes parties which never achieved any representation in parliament.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Contributions to liberal theory the following Dutch thinkers are included:\n\n\n"}

It can be argued as a defense, and if raised successfully can lead to the agreement in question being found void \"ab initio\" or voidable, or alternatively an equitable remedy may be provided by the courts. Common law has identified three different types of mistake in contract: the 'unilateral mistake', the 'mutual mistake' and the 'common mistake'. The distinction between the 'common mistake' and the 'mutual mistake' is important.\n\nAnother breakdown in contract law divides mistakes into four traditional categories: unilateral mistake, mutual mistake, mistranscription, and misunderstanding.\n\nMistake can be-\n(1) Mistake of Law; or\n(2) Mistake of Fact\n\nMistake of law: when a party enters into a contract, without the knowledge of the law in the country, the contract is affected by such mistakes but it is not void. The reason here is that ignorance of law is not an excuse. However, if a party is \"induced\" to enter into a contract by the mistake of law then such a contract is not valid.\nIllustration: Harjoth and Danny make a contract grounded on the erroneous belief that a particular debt is barred by the Indian law of Limitation; the contract is not voidable.\n\nMistake of Fact: Where both the parties enter into an agreement are under a mistake as to a matter of fact essential to the agreement, the agreement is void.\n\nExplanation: An erroneous opinion as to the value of the thing which forms the subject-matter of the agreement is not to be deemed a mistake as to a matter of fact.\n\nIllustration: A sells a cow to B for $80 because it is an infertile cow. The cow is actually pregnant and worth $1000. The contract is void.\n\nAnti-Illustration: Lady found a stone and sold it as a Topaz for $1 ($25 today). It was a raw uncut diamond worth $700 (today $17,000). The contract is not voidable. There was no mistake because neither party knew what the stone was.\n\nA unilateral mistake is where only one party to a contract is mistaken as to the terms or subject-matter contained in a contract. This kind of mistake is more common than other types of mistake. One must first distinguish between mechanical calculations and business error when looking at unilateral mistake. \n\nOrdinarily, unilateral mistake does not make a contract void. Traditionally, Caveat Emptor (let the buyer beware), and under Common Law Caveat Venditor (let the seller beware).\n\nA contract might be voidable from unilateral mistake for any of the following:\n\nA mutual mistake occurs when the parties to a contract are both mistaken about the same \"material\" fact within their contract. They are at cross-purposes. There is a meeting of the minds, but the parties are mistaken. Hence the contract is voidable. \"Collateral\" mistakes will not afford the right of rescission. A collateral mistake is one that 'does not go to the heart' of the contract. For a mutual mistake to be void, then the item the parties are mistaken about must be \"material\" (emphasis added). When there is a material mistake about a material aspect of the contract, the essential purpose of the contract, there is the question of the assumption of the risk. Who has the risk contractually? Who bears the risk by custom? Restatement (Second) Contracts Sec. 154 deals with this scenario.\n\nThis is easily confused with mutual assent cases such as \"Raffles v Wichelhaus\".\n\nIn \"Raffles\", there was an agreement to ship goods on a vessel named \"Peerless\", but each party was referring to a different vessel. Therefore, each party had a different understanding that they did not communicate about when the goods would be shipped.\n\nIn this case, both parties believed there was a \"meeting of the minds,\" but discovered that they were each mistaken about the other party's different meaning. This represents not a mutual mistake but a failure of mutual assent. In this situation, no contract has been formed, since mutual assent is required in the formation stage of contract. Restatement (Second) Contracts Sec. 20 deals with this scenario.\n\nA common mistake is where both parties hold the same mistaken belief of the facts.\n\nThe House of Lords case of \"Bell v Lever Brothers Ltd.\" established that common mistake can void a contract only if the mistake of the subject-matter was sufficiently fundamental to render its identity different from what was contracted, making the performance of the contract impossible.\n\nLater in \"Solle v Butcher\", Lord Denning added requirements for common mistake in equity, which loosened the requirements to show common mistake. However, since that time, the case has been heavily criticized in cases such as \"Great Peace Shipping Ltd v Tsavliris Salvage (International) Ltd\".. For Australian application of Great Peace Shipping (other than in Queensland), see \"Svanosio v McNamara\". For Queensland, see \"Australian Estates v Cairns City Council\".\n\nThose categories of mistake in the United States exist as well, but it is often necessary to identify whether the error was a \"decisional mistake,\" which is a mistake as a matter of law (faced with two known choices, making the wrong one), or an \"ignorant mistake,\" unaware of the true state of affairs.\n\nThe difference is in the extent to which an innocent in the information chain, passing along or using or processing incorrect information, becomes liable. There is a principle that an entity or person cannot be made more liable merely by being in the information chain and passing along information taken in good faith in the belief that it was true, or at least without knowledge of the likelihood of falsity or inaccuracy.\n\nUnder New Mexico law a bank, title company, document processing firm, or the like is not liable for false information provided to it, any more than a bank was liable for false information from a trusted customer turned embezzler who drew an unauthorized cashier’s check. \"Roswell State Bank v. Lawrence Walker Cotton Co.\", 56 N.M. 107, 240 P.2d 143 (1952):\n\n‘A thing is done “in good faith” within the meaning of this act, when it is in fact done honestly, whether it be done negligently or not.\n‘…[a] transferee is not bound to inquire whether the fiduciary is committing a breach of his obligation as fiduciary in transferring the instrument, and is not chargeable with notice that the fiduciary is committing a breach of his obligation as fiduciary unless he takes the instrument with actual knowledge of such breach or with knowledge of such facts that his action in taking the instrument amounts to bad faith.’\n\n56 N.M. at 112-113 (quoting from the Uniform Fiduciaries Act).\n\nRoswell was the case of first impression on this issue in the state of New Mexico, and drew on cases in other jurisdictions interpreting the same language, most notably \"Davis v. Pennsylvania Co. 337 Pa. 456\", 12 A.2d 66 (1940), which on similar facts to Roswell came to the same conclusion and exonerated the innocent actor in favor of shifting any responsibility for the loss to tortfeasors and those who enabled them to act by giving them unjustified authority. 56 N.M. at 114.\n\nThe Davis case leads into another good analysis, in a case relied upon by Davis:\n\n\"Union Bank & Trust Co.v. Girard Trust Co.\", 307 Pa. 468, 500-501, 161 A.2d 865 (1932).\n\nThe law governing record-keeping mistakes and how they are corrected has been gathered by the U.S. Court of International Trade in \"Hynix Semiconductor America, Inc. v. United States\", 414 F. Supp. 2d 1317 (C.I.T. 2006), in which the Court was faced with application of a tariff which had been calculated at the wrong rate by a customs clerk. To enforce \"anti-dumping\" legislation against foreign-made goods (in this case, Korean electronic components) made using cheap labor and undercutting American industry, a regulatory scheme was implemented under which such imports were charged a “liquidation duty” at a rate to be found on a schedule. The schedule had been made up by a panel of experts using standards for adjusting the price differential in the overseas goods. The custom clerk used the wrong category of goods and overcharged the duty, and by the time Hynix figured out what had happened, part of a very short statute of limitations on protest had expired. Hynix nevertheless prevailed and received the correction in its tariff rate by showing that such an error “…was correctable under 19 U.S.C. § 1520(c) as a mistake of fact or clerical error not amounting to an error in the construction of a law, and because the failure to file a protest within ninety days of the liquidation of the entries is without legal consequence in this context …” Id. at 1319.\n\nThe \"Hynix\" court explains the difference between a mistake of law “…where the facts are known but the legal consequences are not, or are believed to be different than they really are…,” \"Century Importers, Inc. v. United States\", 205 F.3d 1308, 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2000), and a mistake of fact, “…where either (1) the facts exist, but are unknown, or (2) the facts do not exist as they are believed to [exist],” quoting \"Hambro Auto. Corp. v. United States\", 66 C.C.P.A. 113, 118, C.A.D. 1231, 603 F.2d 850, 853 (1979) (“A mistake of fact is any mistake except a mistake of law.” Id. at 855) Hynix, 414 F. Supp. 2d. at 1325.\n\n\"Hynix\", in reviewing the tariff application to the facts, also provided a guided tour of the different kinds of mistake and how they are treated in the federal court system. The key distinction is between “decisional mistakes” and “ignorant mistakes.” Id. at 1326; \"G & R Produce Co, v. U.S.\", 281 F. Supp. 2d 1323, 1331 (2003); \"Prosegur, Inc. v. U.S.\", 140 F. Supp. 2d 1370, 1378 (2001); \"Universal Cooperatives, Inc. v. United States\", 715 F. Supp. 1113, 1114 (1989).\n\n‘Decisional mistakes are mistakes of law and occur when “…a party [makes] the wrong choice between two known, alternative sets of facts.” \"Universal Cooperatives\", (citation partly omitted), 715 F. Supp. at 1114. On the other hand, an ignorant mistake occurs where “…a party is unaware of the existence of the correct alternative set of facts.” Id. “In order for the goods to be reliquidated under 1520 (c) (1), the alleged mistake of fact must be an ignorant mistake.” Prosegur, (citation partly omitted), 140 F. Supp. 2d at 1378.’ \"Hynix\" at 1326.\n\n\"Hynix\" provided one more criterion, and that is “materiality,” citing to extensive development of that requirement in \"Degussa Canada Ltd. v. United States\", 87 F.3d 1301, 1304 (Fed. Cir. 1996), and \"Xerox Corp. v. United States\", 2004 C.I.T. (Sept. 8, 2004) (“[A] mistake of fact … is a factual error that, if the correct fact had been known, would have resulted in a different classification.”) The error must be “material” in order to be corrected without consequence.\n\n"}

{"id": "2906083", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2906083", "title": "Philosophy of war", "text": "Philosophy of war\n\nThe philosophy of war is the area of philosophy devoted to examining issues such as the causes of war, the relationship between war and human nature, and the ethics of war. Certain aspects of the philosophy of war overlap with the philosophy of history, political philosophy, international relations and the philosophy of law.\n\nPerhaps the greatest and most influential work in the philosophy of war is \"On War\" by Carl von Clausewitz. It combines observations on strategy with questions about human nature and the purpose of war. Clausewitz especially examines the teleology of war: whether war is a means to an end outside itself or whether it can be an end in itself. He concludes that the latter cannot be so, and that war is \"politics by different means\"; i.e. that war must not exist only for its own sake. It must serve some purpose for the state.\n\nLeo Tolstoy's novel \"War and Peace\" contains frequent philosophical digressions on the philosophy of war (and broader metaphysical speculations derived from Christianity and from Tolstoy's observations of the Napoleonic Wars). It was influential on later thought about war. Tolstoy's Christian-centered philosophy of war (especially his essays \"A Letter to a Hindu\" and \"The Kingdom of God is Within You\") was a direct influence on Gandhi's Hinduism-centered non-violent resistance philosophy.\n\nWhile Sun Tzu's \"The Art of War\", focusses mostly on weaponry and strategy instead of philosophy, his observations are often broadened into a philosophy applied in situations extending well beyond war itself (see the main Wikipedia article on \"The Art of War\" for a discussion of the application of Sun Tzu's philosophy to areas other than war). Parts of Niccolò Machiavelli's masterpiece \"The Prince\" (as well as \"Discourses\") and parts of his own work titled \"The Art of War\" discuss some philosophical points relating to war, though neither book could be said to be a work in the philosophy of war.\n\nJust war theory is a sect of war philosophy thought to have been founded by St. Augustine. The philosophy of just war theorizes what aspects of war are justifiable according to morally acceptable principles. Just war theory is based upon four core criteria to be followed by those determined to go to war. The four principles are as follows: just authority; just cause; right intention; last resort.\n\nThe criterion of just authority refers to the determined legality of going to war, has the concept of war and the pursuit of it been legally processed and justified?\n\nJust cause is a justifiable reason that war is the appropriate and necessary response. If war can be avoided, that must be determined first, according to the philosophy of just war theory.\n\nTo go to war, one must determine if the intentions of doing so are right according to morality. Right intention criterion requires the determination of whether or not a war response is a measurable way to the conflict being acted upon.\n\nWar is a last resort response, meaning that if there is a conflict between disagreeing parties, all solutions must be attempted before resorting to war.\n\nSince the philosophy of war is often treated as a subset of another branch of philosophy (for example, political philosophy or the philosophy of law) it would be difficult to define any clear-cut schools of thought in the same sense that, e.g., Existentialism or Objectivism can be described as distinct movements. The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy refers to Carl von Clausewitz is \"the only (so-called) philosopher of war\", implying that he is the only (major) philosophical writer who develops a philosophical system focusing \"exclusively\" on war. However, discernible traditions of thought on war have developed over time, so that some writers have been able to distinguish broad categories (if somewhat loosely).\n\nAnatol Rapoport's introduction to his edition of the J. J. Graham translation of Clausewitz's \"On War\" identifies three main teleological traditions in the philosophy of war: the cataclysmic, the eschatological, and the political. (\"On War\", Rapoport's introduction, 13). These are not the only possible teleological philosophies of war, but only three of the most common. As Rapoport says,\n\n\nAnother possible system for categorizing different schools of thought on war can be found in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (see external links, below), based on ethics. The SEP describes three major divisions in the ethics of war: the realist, the pacifist, and the just war Theory. In a nutshell:\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3965084", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3965084", "title": "Positivist school (criminology)", "text": "Positivist school (criminology)\n\nIn criminology, the Positivist School has attempted to find scientific objectivity for the measurement and quantification of criminal behavior. As the scientific method became the major paradigm in the search for knowledge, the Classical School's social philosophy was replaced by the quest for scientific laws that would be discovered by experts. It is divided into Biological, Psychological and Social.\n\nIf Charles Darwin's Theory of evolution was scientific as applied to animals, the same approach should be applied to \"man\" as an \"animal\".\nHistorically, medicine became interested in the problem of crime, producing studies of physiognomy (see Johann Kaspar Lavater and Franz Joseph Gall) and the science of phrenology which linked attributes of the mind to the shape of the brain as reveal through the skull. These theories were popular because they absolved society and any failures of its government of responsibility for criminal behavior. The problem lay in the propensities of individual offenders who were biologically distinguishable from law-abiding citizens. This theme was amplified by the Italian School and through the writings of Cesare Lombroso (see \"L'Uomo Delinquente\", \"The Criminal Man\" and Anthropological criminology) which identified physical characteristics associated with degeneracy demonstrating that criminals were atavistic throwbacks to an earlier evolutionary form. Charles Goring (1913) failed to corroborate the characteristics but did find criminals shorter, lighter and less intelligent, i.e. he found criminality to be \"normal\" rather than \"pathological\" (cf the work of Hooton found evidence of biological inferiority). William Sheldon identified three basic body or somatotypes (i.e. \"endomorphs, mesomorphs\", and \"ectomorphs\"), and introduced a scale to measure where each individual was placed. He concluded that delinquents tended to mesomorphy. Modern research might link physical size and athleticism and aggression because physically stronger people have the capacity to use violence with less chance of being hurt in any retaliation. Otherwise, such early research is no longer considered valid. The development of genetics has produced another potential inherent cause of criminality, with chromosome and other genetic factors variously identified as significant to select heredity rather than environment as the cause of crime (\"see: nature versus nurture\"). However, the evidence from family, twin, and adoption studies shows no conclusive empirical evidence to prefer either cause.\n\nThere are a number of reputable studies that demonstrate a link between lower intelligence and criminality. But the evidence is equivocal because studies among the prison population simply test those criminals actually caught, which might be because they failed to plan the crimes properly or because they were unable to resist interrogation techniques and admitted their crimes. If their intelligence is poor, they are also less likely to be deterred.\n\nTestosterone and adrenaline have been associated with aggression and violence, and the arousal and excited state associated with them. The excessive consumption of alcohol can lower blood sugar levels and lead to aggressiveness, and the use of chemicals in foods and drinks has been associated with hyper-activity and some criminal behaviour.\n\nSigmund Freud divided the personality into the id, the primitive biological drives, the superego, the internalised values, and the ego, memory, perception, and cognition. He proposed that criminal behaviour is either the result of mental illness or a weak conscience. John Bowlby proposed an attachment theory in which maternal deprivation was a factor that might lead to delinquency. This has been discounted in favour of general privation (Michael Rutter: 1981) or \"broken homes\" (Glueck: 1950) in which absentee or uncaring parents tend to produce badly behaved children.\n\nHans Eysenck (1987) stated that, \"... certain types of personality may be more prone to react with anti-social or criminal behaviour to environmental factors of one kind or another.\" He proposed three dimensions of personality: introversion/extroversion, neuroticism, and psychoticism. For these purposes, personality is the settled framework of reference within which a person addresses the current situation and decides how to behave. Some traits will be dominant at times and then in a balanced relationship to other traits, but each person's traits will be reasonably stable and predictable (see Marshall: 1990 and Seidman: 1994). Hence, once conditioned into a criminal lifestyle, the relevant personality traits are likely to persist until a countervailing conditioning force re-establishes normal social inhibitions. Some forms of criminal behavior such as sexual offences, have been medicalised with treatment offered alongside punishment.\n\nIn general terms, positivism rejected the Classical Theory's reliance on free will and sought to identify positive causes that determined the propensity for criminal behaviour. Rather than biological or psychological causes, this branch of the School identifies \"society\" as the cause. Hence, environmental criminology and other sub-schools study the spatial distribution of crimes and offenders (see Adolphe Quetelet, who discovered that crimes rates are relatively constant, and the Chicago School which, under the leadership of Robert E. Park, viewed the city as a form of superorganism, zoned into areas engaged in a continuous process of invasion, dominance, and succession). Meanwhile, Émile Durkheim identified society as a social phenomenon, external to individuals, with crime a normal part of a healthy society. Deviancy was nothing more than \"boundary setting,\" pushing to determine the current limits of morality and acceptability.\n\n"}
{"id": "12934176", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12934176", "title": "Preformationism", "text": "Preformationism\n\nIn the history of biology, preformationism (or preformism) is a formerly-popular theory that organisms develop from miniature versions of themselves. Instead of assembly from parts, preformationists believed that the form of living things exist, in real terms, prior to their development. It suggests that all organisms were created at the same time, and that succeeding generations grow from homunculi, or animalcules, that have existed since the beginning of creation.\n\nEpigenesis (or neoformism), then, in this context, is the denial of preformationism: the idea that, in some sense, the form of living things comes into existence. As opposed to \"strict\" preformationism, it is the notion that \"each embryo or organism is gradually produced from an undifferentiated mass by a series of steps and stages during which new parts are added\" (Magner 2002, p. 154). This word is still used, on the other hand, in a more modern sense, to refer to those aspects of the generation of form during ontogeny that are not strictly genetic, or, in other words, \"epigenetic\".\n\nFurthermore, apart from those distinctions (preformationism-epigenesis and genetic-epigenetic), the terms preformistic development, epigenetic development and somatic embryogenesis are also used in another context, in relation to the differentiation of a distinct germ cell line. In preformistic development, the germ line is present since early development. In epigenetic development, the germ line is present, but it appears late. In somatic embryogenesis, a distinct germ line is lacking. Some authors call Weismannist development (either preformistic or epigenetic) that in which there is a distinct germ line.\n\nThe historical ideas of preformationism and epigenesis, and the rivalry between them, are obviated by our contemporary understanding of the genetic code and its molecular basis together with developmental biology and epigenetics.\n\nPythagoras is one of the earliest thinkers credited with ideas about the origin of form in the biological production of offspring. It is said that he originated \"spermism\", the doctrine that fathers contribute the essential characteristics of their offspring while mothers contribute only a material substrate. Aristotle accepted and elaborated this idea, and his writings are the vector that transmitted it to later Europeans. Aristotle purported to analyse ontogeny in terms of the material, formal, efficient, and teleological causes (as they are usually named by later anglophone philosophy) – a view that, though more complex than some subsequent ones, is essentially more epigenetic than preformationist. Later, European physicians such as Galen, Realdo Colombo and Girolamo Fabrici would build upon Aristotle's theories, which were prevalent well into the 17th century.\n\nIn 1651, William Harvey published \"On the Generation of Animals\" (\"Exercitationes de Generatione Animalium\"), a seminal work on embryology that contradicted many of Aristotle's fundamental ideas on the matter. Harvey famously asserted, for example, that \"ex ovo omnia\"—all animals come from eggs. Because of this assertion in particular, Harvey is often credited with being the father of ovist preformationism. However, Harvey's ideas about the process of development were fundamentally epigenesist. As gametes (male sperm and female ova) were too small to be seen under the best magnification at the time, Harvey's account of fertilization was theoretical rather than descriptive. Although he once postulated a \"spiritous substance\" that exerted its effect on the female body, he later rejected it as superfluous and thus unscientific. He guessed instead that fertilization occurred through a mysterious transference by contact, or contagion.\n\nHarvey's epigenesis, more mechanistic and less vitalist than the Aristotelian version, was, thus, more compatible with the natural philosophy of the time. Still, the idea that unorganized matter could ultimately self-organize into life challenged the mechanistic framework of Cartesianism, which had become dominant in the Scientific Revolution. Because of technological limitations, there was no available mechanical explanation for epigenesis. It was simpler and more convenient to postulate preformed miniature organisms that expanded in accordance with mechanical laws. So convincing was this explanation that some naturalists claimed to actually see miniature preformed animals (animalcules) in eggs and miniature plants in seeds. In the case of humans, the term homunculus was used.\n\nAfter the discovery of spermatozoa in 1677 by Dutch microscopist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, the epigenist theory proved more difficult to defend: How could complex organisms such as human beings develop from such simple organisms? Thereafter, Joseph de Aromatari and then Marcello Malpighi and Jan Swammerdam made observations using microscopes in the late 17th century, and interpreted their findings to develop the preformationist theory. For two centuries, until the development of cell theory, preformationists would oppose epigenicists, and, inside the preformationist camp, spermists (who claimed the homunculus must come from the man) to ovists, who located the homunculus in the ova.\n\nDutch microscopist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek was one of the first to observe spermatozoa. He described the spermatozoa of about 30 species, and thought he saw in semen \"all manner of great and small vessels, so various and so numerous that I do not doubt that they be nerves, arteries and veins...And when I saw them, I felt convinced that, in no full grown body, are there any vessels which may not be found likewise in semen.\" (Friedman 76-7)\n\nLeeuwenhoek discovered that the origin of semen was the testicles and was a committed preformationist and spermist. He reasoned that the movement of spermatozoa was evidence of animal life, which presumed a complex structure and, for human sperm, a soul. (Friedman 79)\n\nIn 1694, Nicolaas Hartsoeker, in his \"Essai de Dioptrique\" concerning things large and small that could be seen with optical lenses, produced an image of a tiny human form curled up inside the sperm, which he referred to in the French as \"petit l'infant\" and \"le petit animal\". This image, depicting what historians now refer to as the homunculus, has become iconic of the theory of preformationism, and appears in almost every textbook concerning the history of embryological science.\n\nPhilosopher Nicolas Malebranche was the first to advance the hypothesis that each embryo could contain even smaller embryos ad infinitum, like a Matryoshka doll. According to Malebranche, \"an infinite series of plants and animals were contained within the seed or the egg, but only naturalists with sufficient skill and experience could detect their presence.\" (Magner 158-9) In fact, Malebranche only alleged this, observing that if microscopes enabled us to see very little animals and plants, maybe even smaller creatures could exist. He claimed that it was not unreasonable to believe that \"they are infinite trees in only one seed,\" as he stated that we could already see chickens in eggs, tulips in bulbs, frogs in eggs. From this, he hypothesized that \"all the bodies of humans and animals,\" already born and yet to be born, \"were perhaps produced as soon as the creation of the world.\" \n\nOva were known in some non-mammalian species, and semen was thought to spur the development of the preformed organism contained therein. The theory that located the homonculus in the egg was called ovism. But, when spermatozoa were discovered, a rival camp of spermists sprang up, claiming that the homunculus must come from the male. In fact, the term \"spermatozoon,\" coined by Karl Ernst von Baer, means \"seed animals.\"\n\nWith the discovery of sperm and the concept of spermism came a religious quandary. Why would so many little animals be wasted with each ejaculation of semen? Pierre Lyonet said the wastage proved that sperm could not be the seeds of life. Leibniz supported a theory called panspermism that the wasted sperm might actually be scattered (for example, by the wind) and generate life wherever they found a suitable host.\n\nLeibniz also believed that “death is only a transformation enveloped through diminution,” meaning that not only have organisms always existed in their living form, but that they will always exist, body united to soul, even past apparent death.\n\nIn the 18th century, some animalculists thought that an animal's sperm behaved like the adult animal, and recorded such observations. Some, but not all, preformationists at this time claimed to see miniature organisms inside the sex cells. But, about this time, spermists began to use more abstract arguments to support their theories.\n\nJean Astruc, noting that parents of both sexes seemed to influence the characteristics of their offspring, suggested that the animalcule came from the sperm and was then shaped as it passed into the egg. Buffon and Pierre Louis Moreau also advocated theories to explain this phenomenon.\n\nPreformationism, especially ovism, was the dominant theory of generation during the 18th century. It competed with spontaneous generation and epigenesis, but those two theories were often rejected on the grounds that inert matter could not produce life without God's intervention.\nSome animals' regenerative capabilities challenged preformationism, and Abraham Trembley's studies of the hydra convinced various authorities to reject their former views.\nLazaro Spallanzani, Trembley's nephew, experimented with regeneration and semen, but failed to discern the importance of spermatozoa, dismissing them as parasitic worms and concluding instead that it was the liquid portion of semen that caused the preformed organism in the ovum to develop.\n\nCaspar Friedrich Wolff, an epigenicist, was an 18th-century exception who argued for objectivity and freedom from religious influence on scientific questions.\n\nDespite careful observation of developing embryos, epigenesis suffered from a lack of a theoretical mechanism of generation. Wolff proposed an \"essential force\" as the agent of change, and Immanuel Kant with Johann Friedrich Blumenbach proposed a \"developing drive\" or \"\", a concept related to self-organization.\n\nNaturalists of the late 18th century and the 19th century embraced Wolff's philosophy, but primarily because they rejected the application of mechanistic development, as seen in the expansion of miniature organisms. It was not until the late 19th century that preformationism was discarded in the face of cell theory. Now, scientists \"realized that they need not treat living organisms as machines, nor give up all hope of ever explaining the mechanisms that govern living beings.\" (Magner 173)\n\nWhen John Dalton's atomic theory of matter superseded Descartes' philosophy of infinite divisibility at the beginning of the 19th century, preformationism was struck a further blow. There was not enough space at the bottom of the spectrum to accommodate infinitely stacked animalcules, without bumping into the constituent parts of matter. (Gee 43)\n\nNear the end of the 19th century, the most prominent advocates of preformationatism and epigenesis were Wilhelm Roux and Hans Driesch. Driesch's experiments on the development of the embryos of sea urchins are considered as deciding the case in favor of epigenesis.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7295638", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7295638", "title": "Primary/secondary quality distinction", "text": "Primary/secondary quality distinction\n\nThe primary/secondary quality distinction is a conceptual distinction in epistemology and metaphysics, concerning the nature of reality. It is most explicitly articulated by John Locke in his \"Essay concerning Human Understanding\", but earlier thinkers such as Galileo and Descartes made similar distinctions.\n\nPrimary qualities are thought to be properties of objects that are independent of any observer, such as solidity, extension, motion, number and figure. These characteristics convey facts. They exist in the thing itself, can be determined with certainty, and do not rely on subjective judgments. For example, if an object is spherical, no one can reasonably argue that it is triangular.\n\nSecondary qualities are thought to be properties that produce sensations in observers, such as color, taste, smell, and sound. They can be described as the effect things have on certain people. Knowledge that comes from secondary qualities does not provide objective facts about things.\n\nPrimary qualities are measurable aspects of physical reality. Secondary qualities are subjective.\n\n\nLeibniz was an early critic of the distinction, writing in his 1686 \"Discourse on Metaphysics\" that \"[i]t is even possible to demonstrate that the ideas of size, figure and motion are not so distinctive as is imagined, and that they stand for something imaginary relative to our perceptions as do, although to a greater extent, the ideas of color, heat, and the other similar qualities in regard to which we may doubt whether they are actually to be found in the nature of the things outside of us.\"\n\nGeorge Berkeley wrote his famous critique of this distinction in his book Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous. Berkeley maintained that the ideas created by sensations are all that people can know for sure. As a result, what is perceived as real consists only of ideas in the mind. The crux of Berkeley's argument is that once an object is stripped of all its secondary qualities, it becomes very problematic to assign any acceptable meaning to the idea that \"there is\" some object. Not that one cannot picture to oneself (in one's mind) that some object could exist apart from any perceiver — one clearly can do this — but rather, that one cannot give any \"content\" to this idea. Suppose that someone says that a particular mind-independent object (meaning, an object free of all secondary qualities) exists at some particular spatio-temporal location (in Newtonian terms, in some particular place and at some particular time). Now, none of this particularly means anything if one cannot specify a place and time. In that case it's still a purely imaginary, empty idea. This is not generally thought to be a problem because realists imagine that they can, in fact, specify a place and time for a 'mind-independent' object. What is overlooked is that they can only specify a place and time in place and time \"as we experience them\". Berkeley did not doubt that one can do this, but that it is objective. One has simply related ideas to experiences (the idea of an \"object\" to our \"experiences of space and time\"). In this case there is no space and time, and therefore no objectivity. Space and time as we experience them are always piecemeal (even when the piece of space is big, as in some astronomical photos), it is only in imagination that they are total and all-encompassing, which is how we definitely imagine (!) 'real' space and time as being. This is why Berkeley argued that the materialist has merely an \"idea\" of an unperceived object: because people typically do take our imagining or picturing, as guaranteeing an objective reality to the 'existence' of 'something'. In no adequate way has it been specified nor given any acceptable meaning. As such Berkeley comes to his conclusion that having a compelling image in the mind, one which connects to no specifiable thing external to us, does not guarantee an objective existence.\n\nKant, in his \"Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics That Will Be Able to Present Itself as a Science\", claimed that primary, as well as secondary, qualities are subjective. They are both mere appearances that are located in the mind of a knowing observer. In § 13, Remark II, he wrote: \"Long before Locke's time, but assuredly since him, it has been generally assumed and granted without detriment to the actual existence of external things, that many of their predicates may be said to belong not to the things in themselves, but to their appearances, and to have no proper existence outside our representation. Heat, color, and taste, for instance, are of this kind. Now, if I go farther, and for weighty reasons rank as mere appearances the remaining qualities of bodies also, which are called primary, such as extension, place, and in general space, with all that which belongs to it (impenetrability or materiality, space, etc.)—no one in the least can adduce the reason of its being inadmissible.\"\n\n"}

Quantum mysticism is considered by most scientists and philosophers to be pseudoscience or quackery.\n\nQuantum mysticism in the sense of consciousness playing a role in quantum theory first appeared in Germany during the 1920s when some of the leading quantum physicists, such as Erwin Schrödinger, leaned toward such interpretations of their theories. Others, such as Albert Einstein and Max Planck, objected to these interpretations. Despite the accusation of mysticism from Einstein, Niels Bohr denied the charge, attributing it to misunderstandings. By the second half of the twentieth century the controversy had run its course—Schrödinger's 1958 lectures are said to \"mark the last of a generation that lived with the mysticism controversy\"—and today most physicists are realists who do not believe that quantum theory is involved with consciousness.\n\nIn 1961 Eugene Wigner wrote a paper, titled \"Remarks on the mind–body question\", suggesting that a conscious observer played a fundamental role in quantum mechanics, a part of the Von Neumann–Wigner interpretation. While his paper would serve as inspiration for later mystical works by others, Wigner's ideas were primarily philosophical and are not considered \"in the same ballpark\" as the mysticism that would follow.\n\nIn the early 1970s New Age culture began to incorporate ideas from quantum physics, beginning with books by Arthur Koestler, Lawrence LeShan, and others which suggested that purported parapsychological phenomena could be explained by quantum mechanics. In this decade the Fundamental Fysiks Group emerged, a group of physicists who embraced quantum mysticism while engaging in parapsychology, Transcendental Meditation, and various New Age and Eastern mystical practices. Inspired in part by Wigner, Fritjof Capra, a member of the Fundamental Fysiks Group, wrote \"The Tao of Physics: An Exploration of the Parallels Between Modern Physics and Eastern Mysticism\" (1975), a book espousing New Age quantum physics that gained popularity among the non-scientific public. In 1979 came the publication of \"The Dancing Wu Li Masters\" by Gary Zukav, a non-scientist and \"the most successful of Capra's followers\". The Fundamental Fysiks Group is said to be one of the agents responsible for the \"huge amount of pseudoscientific nonsense\" surrounding interpretations of quantum mechanics.\n\nIn contrast to the mysticism of the early twentieth century, today quantum mysticism typically refers to its New Age incarnation that combines ancient mysticism with quantum mechanics. Called a pseudoscience and a \"hijacking\" of quantum physics, it draws upon \"coincidental similarities of language rather than genuine connections\" to quantum mechanics. Physicist Murray Gell-Mann coined the phrase \"quantum flapdoodle\" to refer to the misuse and misapplication of quantum physics to other topics.\n\nAn example of such misuse is New Age guru Deepak Chopra's \"quantum theory\" that aging is caused by the mind, expounded in his books \"Quantum Healing\" (1989) and \"Ageless Body, Timeless Mind\" (1993). In 1998 Chopra was awarded the parody Ig Nobel Prize in the physics category for \"his unique interpretation of quantum physics as it applies to life, liberty, and the pursuit of economic happiness\".\n\nThe 2004 film \"What the Bleep Do We Know!?\" dealt with a range of New Age ideas in relation to physics. It was produced by the Ramtha School of Enlightenment which was founded by J.Z. Knight, a channeler who said that her teachings were based on a discourse with a 35,000-year-old disembodied entity named Ramtha. Featuring Fundamental Fysiks Group member Fred Alan Wolf, the film misused some aspects of quantum mechanics—including the Heisenberg uncertainty principle and the observer effect—as well as biology and medicine. Numerous critics dismissed the film for its use of pseudoscience.\n\n\n"}

It combines elements of distributive justice and climate justice and is based on the observation that many countries rich in natural resources such as minerals and other raw materials nevertheless experience high levels of poverty. This resource curse is one of the main ethical reasons to demand resource justice, that is, a globally fair distribution of all natural resources.\n\nThe term resource justice as a subcategory of distributive justice was first developed following the repeated observation that natural resources that, supposedly, are a blessing for local populations, turn out to be a curse. This can manifest itself in a number of ways – and for a number of reasons, some of which occur in isolation but more often arise together. Some examples are:\n\nCapacity building and external support in order to empower \"communities affected by oil, gas, and mining operations\" so that they themselves are able to determine how local resources are being used.

This article surveys various definitions of the subject that have appeared over the centuries through to modern times, and puts them in context as reflecting rival conceptions of the subject.\n\nIn the periodic of scholastic philosophy, logic was predominantly Aristotelian. Following the decline of scholasticism, logic was thought of as an affair of ideas by early modern philosophers such as Locke and Hume (1711-1716). Immanuel Kant took this one step further. He begins with the assumption of the empiricist philosophers, that all knowledge whatsoever is internal to the mind, and that we have no genuine knowledge of 'things in themselves'. Furthermore, (an idea he seemed to have got from Hume) the material of knowledge is a succession of separate ideas which have no intrinsic connection and thus no real unity. In order that these disparate sensations be brought into some sort of order and coherence, there must be an internal mechanism in the mind which provides the \"forms\" by which we think, perceive and reason.\n\nKant calls these forms \"Categories\" (in a somewhat different sense than employed by the Aristotelian logicians), of which he claims there are twelve:\n\n\nHowever, this seems to be an arbitrary arrangement, driven by the desire to present a harmonious appearance than from any underlying method or system. For example, the triple nature of each division forced him to add artificial categories such as the infinite judgment.\n\nThis conception of logic eventually developed into an extreme form of psychologism espoused in the nineteenth by Benno Erdmann and others. The view of historians of logic is that Kant's influence was negative.\n\nAnother view of logic espoused by Hegel and others of his school (such as Lotze, Bradley, Bosanquet and others), was the 'Logic of the Pure Idea'. The central feature of this view is the identification of Logic and Metaphysics. The Universe has its origin in the categories of thought. Thought in its fullest development becomes the Absolute Idea, a divine mind evolving itself in the development of the Universe.\n\nIn the modern period, Gottlob Frege said \"Just as 'beautiful' points the way for aesthetics and 'good' for ethics, so do words like 'true' for logic\", and went on characterise the distinctive task of logic \"to discern the laws of truth\".\nLater, W. V. Quine (1940, pp. 2–3) defined logic in terms of a logical vocabulary, which in turn is identified by an argument that the many particular vocabularies —Quine mentions geological vocabulary— are used in their particular discourses together with a common, topic-independent kernel of terms. These terms, then, constitute the logical vocabulary, and the logical truths are those truths common to all particular topics.\n\nHofweber (2004) lists several definitions of logic, and goes on to claim that all definitions of logic are of one of four sorts. These are that logic is the study of: (i) artificial formal structures, (ii) sound inference (e.g., Poinsot), (iii) tautologies (e.g., Watts), or (iv) general features of thought (e.g., Frege). He argues then that these definitions are related to each other, but do not exhaust each other, and that an examination of formal ontology shows that these mismatches between rival definitions are due to tricky issues in ontology.\n\nArranged in approximate chronological order.\n\n\n\n"}

Besides this, he held a Licentiate in Philosophy, a Licentiate in Theology, a B.A. Classics.\n\nAntoine arrived in India in 1939 and became an Indian citizen in 1950. His untimely death from liver cancer occurred in 1981. During the 42 years he spent in India, mainly in Calcutta, he contributed much to the Bengali culture, the diffusion of Sanskrit and the life of the Church in Bengal. In the words of Felix Raj, “he was an eminent priest, a scholar, an accomplished teacher, a gifted musician and singer and a dear friend.” From 1956, he was lecturer in the Department of Comparative Literature of the Jadavpur University. He also taught at St. Xavier's College, Calcutta. In 1950 he founded the dialogue center \"Shanti Bhavan\" with Pierre Fallon as a center of inter-faith, inter-cultural dialogue and their home amidst a population of middle-class intelligentsia. For many years, their periodical, \"Darśan Cakra\", attracted keen professors of philosophy and other intellectuals.

{"id": "30007", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30007", "title": "The Matrix", "text": "The Matrix\n\nThe Matrix is a 1999 science fiction action film written and directed by The Wachowskis and starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, and Joe Pantoliano. It depicts a dystopian future in which reality as perceived by most humans is actually a simulated reality called \"the Matrix\", created by sentient machines to subdue the human population, while their bodies' heat and electrical activity are used as an energy source. Cybercriminal and computer programmer Neo learns this truth and is drawn into a rebellion against the machines, which involves other people who have been freed from the \"dream world\".\n\n\"The Matrix\" is known for popularizing a visual effect known as \"bullet time\", in which the heightened perception of certain characters is represented by allowing the action within a shot to progress in slow-motion while the camera's viewpoint appears to move through the scene at normal speed. The film is an example of the cyberpunk subgenre. It contains numerous references to philosophical and religious ideas, and pays homage to works such as Plato's Allegory of the Cave, Jean Baudrillard's \"Simulacra and Simulation\", Lewis Carroll's \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\", and Masamune Shirow's \"Ghost in the Shell\". The Wachowskis' approach to action scenes drew upon their admiration for Japanese animation and martial arts films, and the film's use of fight choreographers and wire fu techniques from Hong Kong action cinema influenced subsequent Hollywood action film productions.\n\n\"The Matrix\" was first released in the United States on March 31, 1999 and grossed over $460 million worldwide. It was well-received by critics and won four Academy Awards, as well as other accolades, including BAFTA Awards and Saturn Awards. Reviewers praised \"The Matrix\" for its innovative visual effects, cinematography and entertainment value. The film has since appeared in lists of the greatest science fiction films, and, in 2012, was added to the National Film Registry for preservation. The success of the film led to the release of two feature film sequels, both written and directed by the Wachowskis: \"The Matrix Reloaded\" and \"The Matrix Revolutions\". \"The Matrix\" franchise was further expanded through the production of comic books, video games and animated short films, in which the Wachowskis were heavily involved, and even inspired books and theories on ideas in religion and philosophy.\n\nA woman is cornered by police in an abandoned hotel; after overpowering them with superhuman abilities, a group of sinister superhuman grey green-suited Agents leads the police in a rooftop pursuit. She answers a ringing public telephone and vanishes.\n\nComputer programmer Thomas Anderson, living a double life as the hacker \"Neo\", feels something is wrong with the world and is puzzled by repeated online encounters with the cryptic phrase \"the Matrix\". The woman, Trinity, contacts him, saying that a man named Morpheus can explain its meaning; however, the Agents, led by Agent Smith, apprehend Neo and attempt to threaten him into helping them capture the \"terrorist\" Morpheus. Undeterred, Neo later meets Morpheus, who offers him a choice between a red pill that will show him the truth about the Matrix, and a blue pill that will return him to his former life. After swallowing the red pill, his reality disintegrates and Neo awakens, naked, weak and hairless, in a liquid-filled pod, among countless others connected by cables to an elaborate electrical system. He is rescued and brought aboard Morpheus' hovercraft, the \"Nebuchadnezzar\".\n\nAs Neo recuperates, Morpheus explains the truth: in the 21st century, intelligent machines waged war against their human creators. When humans blocked the machines' access to solar energy, the machines retaliated by harvesting the humans' bioelectric power. The Matrix is a shared simulation of the world, in which the minds of the harvested humans are trapped and pacified. All free humans live in Zion, the last refuge in the real world. Morpheus and his crew are a group of rebels who hack into the Matrix to \"unplug\" enslaved humans and recruit them. Their understanding of the simulated reality enables them to bend its physical laws, granting them superhuman abilities. Morpheus warns Neo that death within the Matrix also kills the physical body, and that the Agents are powerful sentient programs that eliminate threats to the system. Neo's prowess during virtual combat training lends credence to Morpheus' belief that Neo is \"the One\", an especially powerful human prophesied to free humans and end the war.\n\nThe group enters the Matrix to visit the Oracle, an all-knowing prophet who predicted the emergence of the One. She implies that Neo is not the One and warns Neo that he will have to choose between Morpheus' life and his own. Before they can leave the Matrix, the group is ambushed by Agents and tactical police alerted by Cypher, a disgruntled crew member who betrayed Morpheus to Smith in exchange for a comfortable life back in the Matrix. Morpheus allows himself to be captured so Neo and the rest of the crew can escape. Cypher exits the Matrix and murders several crew members as they lie defenseless in the real world. As he prepares to disconnect Neo and Trinity, Tank, a crewman whom he had left for dead, kills him.\n\nIn the Matrix, the Agents interrogate Morpheus to learn his access codes to the mainframe computer in Zion. Tank proposes killing Morpheus to prevent this, but Neo, believing that he is not the One, decides himself worth sacrificing if need be to rescue Morpheus; Trinity insists she accompany him. While rescuing Morpheus, Neo gains confidence in his abilities, performing feats comparable to the Agents'. Morpheus and Trinity exit the Matrix, but Smith ambushes and kills Neo before he can leave. In the real world, machines called Sentinels attack the \"Nebuchadnezzar\". Trinity whispers to Neo that he can't be dead because she loves him and the Oracle told her that she would fall in love with the One. She kisses Neo and he revives with the power to perceive and control the Matrix. He effortlessly defeats Smith and leaves the Matrix just as the ship's electromagnetic pulse weapon disables the attacking Sentinels.\n\nLater, Neo makes a telephone call inside the Matrix, promising the machines that he will show their prisoners \"a world where anything is possible\". He hangs up and flies into the sky as \"Wake Up\" by Rage Against the Machine plays.\n\n\nIn 1994, the Wachowskis presented the script for the film \"Assassins\" to Warner Bros. Pictures. After Lorenzo di Bonaventura, the president of production of the company at the time, read the script, he decided to buy rights to it and included two more pictures, \"Bound\" and \"The Matrix\", in the contract. The first movie The Wachowskis directed, \"Bound\", then became a critical success. Using this momentum, the siblings later asked to direct \"The Matrix\".\n\nProducer Joel Silver soon joined the project. Although the project had key supporters like Silver and Di Bonaventura to influence the company, \"The Matrix\" was still a huge investment for Warner Bros, which had to invest $60 million to create a movie with deep philosophical ideas and difficult special effects. The Wachowskis therefore hired underground comic book artists Geof Darrow and Steve Skroce to draw a 600-page, shot-by-shot storyboard for the entire film. The storyboard eventually earned the studio's approval, and it was decided to film in Australia to make the most of the budget. Soon, \"The Matrix\" became a co-production of Warner Bros. and the Australian company Village Roadshow Pictures.\n\nThe actors of the film were required to be able to understand and explain \"The Matrix\". \"Simulacra and Simulation\" was required reading for most of the principal cast and crew. Reeves stated that the Wachowskis had him read \"Simulacra and Simulation\", \"\", and Dylan Evans’s \"Introducing Evolutionary Psychology\" even before they opened up the script, and eventually he was able to explain all the philosophical nuances involved. Moss commented that she had difficulty with this process.\n\nThe directors had also been admirers of Hong Kong action cinema for a long time, so they decided to hire the Chinese martial arts choreographer and film director Yuen Woo-ping to work on fight scenes. To prepare for the wire fu, the actors had to train hard for several months. The Wachowskis first scheduled four months for training. Yuen was optimistic but then began to worry when he realized how unfit the actors were.\n\nYuen let their body style develop and then worked with each actor's strength. He built on Reeves' diligence, Fishburne's resilience, Weaving's precision, and Moss's feminine grace. Yuen designed Moss' moves to suit her deftness and lightness. Prior to the pre-production, Reeves suffered a two-level fusion of his cervical spine which had begun to cause paralysis in his legs, requiring him to undergo neck surgery. He was still recovering by the time of pre-production, but he insisted on training, so Yuen let him practice punches and lighter moves. Reeves trained hard and even requested training on days off. However, the surgery still made him unable to kick for two out of four months of training. As a result, Reeves did not kick much in the film. Weaving had to undergo hip surgery after he sustained an injury during the training process.\n\nIn the film, the code that composes the Matrix itself is frequently represented as downward-flowing green characters. This code uses a custom typeface designed by Simon Whiteley, which includes mirror images of half-width kana characters and Western Latin letters and numerals. In a 2017 interview at CNET, he attributed the design to his wife, who's from Japan, and added, \"I like to tell everybody that The Matrix's code is made out of Japanese sushi recipes\". \"The color green reflects the green tint commonly used on early monochrome computer monitors\". Lynne Cartwright, the Visual Effects Supervisor at Animal Logic, supervised the creation of the film's opening title sequence, as well as the general look of the Matrix code throughout the film, in collaboration with Lindsay Fleay and Justen Marshall. The portrayal resembles the opening credits of the 1995 Japanese cyberpunk film, \"Ghost in the Shell\", which had a strong influence on the \"Matrix\" series (see below). It was also used in the subsequent films, on the related website, and in the game \"\", and its drop-down effect is reflected in the design of some posters for the \"Matrix\" series. The code received the Runner-up Award in the 1999 Jesse Garson Award for In-film typography or opening credit sequence.\n\n\"The Matrix\"s production designer, Owen Paterson, used methods to distinguish the \"real world\" and the Matrix in a pervasive way. The production design team generally placed a bias towards the Matrix code's distinctive green color in scenes set within the simulation, whereas there is an emphasis on the color blue during scenes set in the \"real world\". In addition, the Matrix scenes' sets were slightly more decayed, monolithic, and grid-like, to convey the cold, logical and artificial nature of that environment. For the \"real world\", the actors' hair was less styled, their clothing had more textile content, and the cinematographers used longer lenses to soften the backgrounds and emphasize the actors.\n\nThe \"Nebuchadnezzar\" was designed to have a patched-up look, instead of clean, cold and sterile space ship interior sets as used on films like \"Star Trek\". The wires were made visible to show the ship's working internals, and each composition was carefully designed to convey the ship as \"a marriage between Man and Machine\". For the scene when Neo wakes up in the pod connected to the Matrix, the pod was constructed to look dirty, used, and sinister. During the testing of a breathing mechanism in the pod, the tester suffered hypothermia in under eight minutes, so the pod had to be heated.\n\nKym Barrett, costume designer, said that she defined the characters and their environment by their costume. For example, Reeves' office costume was designed for Thomas Anderson to look uncomfortable, disheveled, and out of place. Barrett sometimes used three types of fabric for each costume, and also had to consider the practicality of the acting. The actors needed to perform martial art actions in their costume, hang upside-down without people seeing up their clothing, and be able to work the wires while strapped into the harnesses. For Trinity, Barrett experimented with how each fabric absorbed and reflected different types of light, and was eventually able to make Trinity's costume mercury-like and oil-slick to suit the character. For the Agents, their costume was designed to create a secret service, undercover look, resembling the film \"JFK\".\n\nThe sunglasses, a staple to the film's aesthetics, were commissioned for the film by designer Richard Walker from sunglass maker Blinde Design.\n\nAll but a few scenes were filmed at Fox Studios in Sydney, and in the city itself, although recognizable landmarks were not included in order to maintain the impression of a generic American city. The filming helped establish New South Wales as a major film production center. Filming commenced in March 1998 and wrapped in August 1998; principal photography took 118 days.\n\nDue to Reeves' neck injury, some of the action scenes had to be rescheduled to wait for his full recovery. As a result, the filming began with scenes that did not require much physical exertion, such as the scene in Thomas Anderson's office, the interrogation room, or the car ride in which Neo is taken to see the Oracle. Locations for these scenes included Martin Place's fountain in Sydney, half-way between it and the adjacent Colonial Building, and the Colonial Building itself. During the scene set on a government building rooftop, the team filmed extra footage of Neo dodging bullets in case the bullet time process did not work. The bullet-time fight scene was filmed on the roof of Symantec Corporation building in Kent Street, opposite of Sussex street.\n\nMoss performed the shots featuring Trinity at the beginning of the film and all the wire stunts herself. The rooftop set that Trinity uses to escape from Agent Brown early in the film was left over from the production of \"Dark City\", which has prompted comments due to the thematic similarities of the films. During the rehearsal of the lobby scene, in which Trinity runs on a wall, Moss injured her leg and was ultimately unable to film the shot in one take. She stated that she was under a lot of pressure at the time and was devastated when she realized that she would be unable to do it.\n\nThe dojo set was built well before the actual filming. During the filming of these action sequences, there was significant physical contact between the actors, earning them bruises. Because of Reeves's injury and his insufficient training with wires prior to the filming, he was unable to perform the triple kicks satisfactorily and became frustrated with himself, causing the scene to be postponed. The scene was shot successfully a few days later, with Reeves using only three takes. Yuen altered the choreography and made the actors pull their punches in the last sequence of the scene, creating a training feel.\n\nThe filmmakers originally planned to shoot the subway scene in an actual subway station, but the complexity of the fight and related wire work required shooting the scene on a set. The set was built around an existing train storage facility, which had real train tracks. Filming the scene when Neo slammed Smith into the ceiling, Chad Stahelski, Reeves' stunt double, sustained several injuries, including broken ribs, knees, and a dislocated shoulder. Another stuntman was injured by a hydraulic puller during a shot where Neo was slammed into a booth. The office building in which Smith interrogated Morpheus was a large set, and the outside view from inside the building was a large, three story high cyclorama. The helicopter was a full-scale light-weight mock-up suspended by a wire rope operated a tilting mechanism mounted to the studio roofbeams. The helicopter had side mounted to it a real minigun, which was set to cycle at half normal full (3000 rounds per min) firing rate. The visual effect of the helicopters rotating blades was effected by using strobe lighting.\n\nTo prepare for the scene in which Neo wakes up in a pod, Reeves lost 15 pounds and shaved his whole body to give Neo an emaciated look. The scene in which Neo fell into the sewer system concluded the principal photography. According to \"The Art of the Matrix\", at least one filmed scene and a variety of short pieces of action were omitted from the final cut of the film.\n\nThe film is known for popularizing a visual effect known as \"bullet time\", which allows a shot to progress in slow-motion while the camera appears to move through the scene at normal speed. Bullet time has been described as \"a visual analogy for privileged moments of consciousness within the Matrix\", and throughout the film, the effect is used to illustrate characters' exertion of control over time and space. The Wachowskis first imagined an action sequence that slowed time while the camera pivoted rapidly around the subjects, and proposed the effect in their screenplay for the film. When John Gaeta read the script, he pleaded with an effects producer at Manex Visual Effects to let him work on the project, and created a prototype that led to him becoming the film's visual effects supervisor.\n\nThe method used for creating these effects involved a technically expanded version of an old art photography technique known as time-slice photography, in which an array of cameras are placed around an object and triggered simultaneously. Each camera is a still-picture camera not a motion picture camera, and it contributes just one frame to the video sequence. When those pictures are shown in sequence, they create the effect of \"virtual camera movement\"; the illusion of a viewpoint moving around an object that appears frozen in time.\n\nThe bullet time effect is similar but slightly more complicated, incorporating temporal motion so that rather than appearing totally frozen, the scene progresses in slow and variable motion. The cameras' positions and exposures were previsualized using a 3D simulation. Instead of firing the cameras simultaneously, the visual effect team fired the cameras fractions of a second after each other, so that each camera could capture the action as it progressed, creating a super slow-motion effect. When the frames were put together, the resulting slow-motion effects reached a frame frequency of 12,000 per second, as opposed to the normal 24 frames per second of film. Standard movie cameras were placed at the ends of the array to pick up the normal speed action before and after. Because the cameras circle the subject almost completely in most of the sequences, computer technology was used to edit out the cameras that appeared in the background on the other side. To create backgrounds, Gaeta hired George Borshukov, who created 3D models based on the geometry of buildings and used the photographs of the buildings themselves as texture.\n\nThe photo-realistic surroundings generated by this method were incorporated into the bullet time scene, and linear interpolation filled in any gaps of the still images to produce a fluent dynamic motion; the computer-generated \"lead in\" and \"lead out\" slides were filled in between frames in sequence to get an illusion of orbiting the scene. Manex Visual Effects used a cluster farm running the Unix-like operating system FreeBSD to render many of the film's visual effects.\n\nManex also handled creature effects, such as Sentinels and machines in real world scenes; Animal Logic created the code hallway and the exploding Agent at the end of the film. DFilm managed scenes that required heavy use of digital compositing, such as Neo's jump off a skyscraper and the helicopter crash into a building. The ripple effect in the latter scene was created digitally, but the shot also included practical elements, and months of extensive research were needed to find the correct kind of glass and explosives to use. The scene was shot by colliding a quarter-scale helicopter mock-up into a glass wall wired to concentric rings of explosives; the explosives were then triggered in sequence from the center outward, to create a wave of exploding glass.\n\nThe photogrametric and image-based computer-generated background approaches in \"The Matrix\"s bullet time evolved into innovations unveiled in the sequels \"The Matrix Reloaded\" and \"The Matrix Revolutions\". The method of using real photographs of buildings as texture for 3D models eventually led the visual effect team to digitize all data, such as scenes, characters' motions and expressions. It also led to the development of \"Universal Capture\", a process which samples and stores facial details and expressions at high resolution. With these highly detailed collected data, the team were able to create virtual cinematography in which characters, locations, and events can all be created digitally and viewed through virtual cameras, eliminating the restrictions of real cameras.\n\nDane A. Davis was responsible for creating the sound effects for the film. The fight scenes sound effects, such as the whipping sounds of punches were created using thin metal rods and recording them, then editing the sounds. The sound of the pod containing a human baby closing required almost fifty sounds put together.\n\nThe film's score was composed by Don Davis. He noted that mirrors appear frequently in the film: reflections of the blue and red pills are seen in Morpheus's glasses; Neo's capture by Agents is viewed through the rear-view mirror of Trinity's Triumph Speed Triple motorcycle; Neo observes a broken mirror mending itself; reflections warp as a spoon is bent; the reflection of a helicopter is visible as it approaches a skyscraper. Davis focused on this theme of reflections when creating his score, alternating between sections of the orchestra and attempting to incorporate contrapuntal ideas. Davis' score combines orchestral, choral and synthesizer elements; the balance between these elements varies depending on whether humans or machines are the dominant subject of a given scene.\nIn addition to Davis' score, \"The Matrix\" soundtrack also features music from acts such as Rammstein, Rob Dougan, Rage Against the Machine, Propellerheads, Ministry, Deftones, Monster Magnet, The Prodigy, Rob Zombie, Meat Beat Manifesto, and Marilyn Manson.\n\n\"The Matrix\" draws from and makes reference to numerous cinematic and literary works, and concepts from mythology, religion and philosophy. \"The Matrix\" also makes reference to the ideas of Buddhism, Christianity, Gnosticism, Hinduism, and Judaism. \"The Matrix\"s premise resembles the Christian doctrine of the Trinity. Andrew Godoski from \"Screened.com\" observed Neo's \"virgin birth\", his doubt in himself, the prophecy of his coming, along with many Christianity references. In \"The Matrix\", a copy of Jean Baudrillard's \"Simulacra and Simulation\", which was published in French in 1981, is visible on-screen as the book used to conceal disks, and Morpheus quotes its phrase \"desert of the real\". The book was required reading for the actors prior to filming. Baudrillard himself said that \"The Matrix\" misunderstands and distorts his work.\n\nInterpretations of \"The Matrix\" often reference Baudrillard's philosophy to demonstrate that the film is an allegory for contemporary experience in a heavily commercialized, media-driven society, especially in developed countries. The influence of the matrixial theory of Bracha Ettinger articulated in a series of books and essays from the end of the 1980s onwards was brought to the public's attention through the writings of art historians such as Griselda Pollock and film theorists such as Heinz-Peter Schwerfel. Bracha Ettinger's matrixial theory is referred to explicitly quite late in the film through the expression \"primal matrix\" but it is visualized from the beginning via the alliance between Neo, Trinity and Morpheus, their \"co-birthing\" in a womb-like \"shareable time-space\", their co-existence in different dimension at the same time, their relation to the maternal oracle and more. Her \"archaic\" matrix is always in the now and the future, depends on human affects and desires, and proposes a different relations between the symbolic and the real. This Matrix is fragile yet it is resistant to the dominating Matrix of the mechanical coded simulated and manipulated consciousness that forecloses and rejects it. In the Ettingerian matrixial sphere freedom goes together with responsibility. The links between Neo, Morpheus, Trinity and the Oracle, right from the very beginning and all along the film, manifest the possibility of \"transconnectedness\" in proximity and in distance, which is not global and can't form a \"web of webs\". Its webs are always specific, invested by an \"Eros of borderlinking\" and related to different processes that Ettinger has named \"metramorphosis\" (feminine-maternal-material morpheus). This is then another kind of Matrix hidden behind the Baudrillard kind.\n\n\"The Matrix\" belongs to the cyberpunk genre of science fiction, and draws from earlier works in the genre such as the 1984 novel \"Neuromancer\" by William Gibson. For example, the film's use of the term \"Matrix\" is adopted from Gibson's novel, though L. P. Davies had already used the term \"Matrix\" fifteen years earlier for a similar concept in his 1969 novel \"The White Room\" (\"It had been tried in the States some years earlier, but their 'matrix' as they called it hadn't been strong enough to hold the fictional character in place\"). After watching \"The Matrix\", Gibson commented that the way that the film's creators had drawn from existing cyberpunk works was \"exactly the kind of creative cultural osmosis\" he had relied upon in his own writing; however, he noted that the film's Gnostic themes distinguished it from \"Neuromancer\", and believed that \"The Matrix\" was thematically closer to the work of science fiction author Philip K. Dick. Other writers have also commented on the similarities between \"The Matrix\" and Dick's work; one example of such influence is a Philip K. Dick's 1977 conference, in which he stated:\n\nThe Wachowskis' approach to action scenes drew upon their admiration for Japanese animation such as \"Ninja Scroll\" and \"Akira\". Director Mamoru Oshii's 1995 animated film \"Ghost in the Shell\" was a particularly strong influence; producer Joel Silver has stated that the Wachowskis first described their intentions for \"The Matrix\" by showing him that anime and saying, \"We wanna do that for real\". Mitsuhisa Ishikawa of Production I.G, which produced \"Ghost in the Shell\", noted that the anime's high-quality visuals were a strong source of inspiration for the Wachowskis. He also commented, \"... cyberpunk films are very difficult to describe to a third person. I'd imagine that \"The Matrix\" is the kind of film that was very difficult to draw up a written proposal for to take to film studios\". He stated that since \"Ghost in the Shell\" had gained recognition in America, the Wachowskis used it as a \"promotional tool\". The action scenes of \"The Matrix\" were also strongly influenced by live-action films such as those of director John Woo. The martial arts sequences were inspired by \"Fist of Legend\", a critically acclaimed 1995 martial arts film starring Jet Li. The fight scenes in \"Fist of Legend\" led to the hiring of Yuen as fight choreographer.\n\nThe film makes several references to Lewis Carroll's \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\". The pods in which the machines keep humans have been compared to images in \"Metropolis\", and the work of M. C. Escher. The Wachowskis have described Stanley Kubrick's \"\" as a formative cinematic influence, and as a major inspiration on the visual style they aimed for when making \"The Matrix\".\n\nReviewers have commented on similarities between \"The Matrix\" and other late-1990s films such as \"Strange Days\", \"Dark City\", and \"The Truman Show\". Comparisons have also been made to Grant Morrison's comic series \"The Invisibles\"; Morrison believes that the Wachowskis essentially plagiarized his work to create the film. Comparisons have also been made between \"The Matrix\" and the books of Carlos Castaneda.\nThe similarity of the film's central concept to a device in the long-running series \"Doctor Who\" has also been noted. As in the film, the Matrix of that series (introduced in the 1976 serial \"The Deadly Assassin\") is a massive computer system which one enters using a device connecting to the head, allowing users to see representations of the real world and change its laws of physics; but if killed there, they will die in reality.\n\nThe Matrix as a generated reality - the invention of malicious machines - is a reference to Descartes' First Meditation, or evil demon. The Meditation hypothesizes that the perceived world might be a comprehensive illusion created to deceive us. The same premise can be found in Hilary Putnam's brain in a vat scenario proposed in the 1980s. One can also make a connection between the premise of \"The Matrix\" and Plato's Allegory of the Cave; once one accepts that The Matrix is an illusion, then the allegory of the cave becomes clear. The allegory is related to Plato's theory of Forms, which holds that the true essence of an object is not what we perceive with our senses, but rather its quality, and that most people perceive only the shadow of the object and are thus limited to false perception.\n\nImmanuel Kant also has an influence on how individuals within The Matrix interact with one another and with the system. Kant states in his \"Critique of Pure Reason\" that people come to know and explore our world through synthetic means (language, etc.), and thus this makes it rather difficult to discern truth from falsely perceived views. This means we ourselves are our own agents of deceit, and so in order for one to know truth, one must choose to openly pursue truth. One may examine this explicitly in the scene with Agent Smith's monologue about the first version of the Matrix, which was designed to be a human utopia, a perfect world without suffering and with total happiness. Agent Smith exclaims, \"it was a disaster. No one accepted the program. Entire crops [of people] were lost.\" The machines had to amend their choice of programming in order to make people subservient to them, and so they conceived The Matrix in the image of the world in 1999. The world in 1999 was far from a utopia, but still humans accepted this over the suffering-less utopia. This is Kantian, because the machines wished to impose a perfect world on humans in an attempt to keep people content to remain completely submissive to the machines, both consciously and subconsciously, but humans are not easy to make content.\n\nMorpheus paraphrases the Chinese philosopher Zhuangzi when he asks Neo, “Have you ever had a dream, Neo, that you were so sure was real? What if you weren’t able to wake from that dream? How would you know the difference from the real world and the dream world?”\n\n\"The Matrix\" was released on VHS and DVD on , 1999. It was also released on Laserdisc in its original aspect ratio of 2.35:1 on September 21, 1999 in the US from Warner Home Video as well as in a cropped 1.33:1 aspect ratio in Hong Kong from ERA Home Entertainment. After its DVD release, it was the first DVD to sell more than one million copies in the US, and went on to be the first to sell more than three million copies in the US. By , 2003, one month after \"The Matrix Reloaded\" DVD was released, the sales of \"The Matrix\" DVD had exceeded 30 million copies. The Ultimate Matrix Collection was released on HD DVD on , 2007 and on Blu-ray on , 2008. The film was also released standalone in a 10th anniversary edition Blu-ray in the Digibook format on , 2009, 10 years to the day after the film was released theatrically. In 2010, the film had another DVD release along with the two sequels as \"The Complete Matrix Trilogy\".\n\nThe film earned $171,479,930 (37.0%) in the United States and Canada and $292,037,453 (63.0%) in other countries, for a worldwide total of $463,517,383. In North America, it became the fifth highest grossing film of 1999 and the highest grossing R-rated film of 1999. Worldwide it was the fourth highest grossing film of the year. it was placed 122nd on the list of highest grossing films of all time, and the second highest grossing film in the \"Matrix\" franchise after \"The Matrix Reloaded\" ($742.1 million).\n\n\"The Matrix\" received acclaim from most critics, and is widely regarded as one of the greatest science fiction films of all time. \"Entertainment Weekly\" called \"The Matrix\" \"the most influential action movie of the generation\". Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an 88% of positive reviews, with a weighted average score of 7.6/10 based upon a sample of 144 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Thanks to the Wachowskis' imaginative vision, \"The Matrix\" is a smartly crafted combination of spectacular action and groundbreaking special effects\". At Metacritic, which assigns a rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film received a score of 73 based on 35 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews.\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A-\" on an A+ to F scale. It ranked 323rd among critics, and 546th among directors, in the 2012 \"Sight & Sound\" polls of the greatest films ever made.\n\nPhilip Strick commented in \"Sight & Sound\", \"if the Wachowski Brothers claim no originality of message, they are startling innovators of method,\" praising the film's details and its \"broadside of astonishing images\". Roger Ebert praised the film's visuals and premise, but disliked the third act's focus on action. Similarly, \"Time Out\" praised the \"entertainingly ingenious\" switches between different realities, Hugo Weaving's \"engagingly odd\" performance, and the film's cinematography and production design, but concluded, \"the promising premise is steadily wasted as the film turns into a fairly routine action pic ... yet another slice of overlong, high concept hokum.\"\n\nJonathan Rosenbaum of the \"Chicago Reader\" reviewed the film negatively, criticizing it as \"simpleminded fun for roughly the first hour, until the movie becomes overwhelmed by its many sources ... There's not much humor to keep it all life-size, and by the final stretch it's become bloated, mechanical, and tiresome.\"\n\nIan Nathan of \"Empire\" described Carrie-Anne Moss as \"a major find\", praised the \"surreal visual highs\" enabled by the bullet time (or \"flo-mo\") effect, and described the film as \"technically mind-blowing, style merged perfectly with content and just so damn cool\". Nathan remarked that although the film's \"looney plot\" would not stand up to scrutiny, that was not a big flaw because \"\"The Matrix\" is about pure experience\". Maitland McDonagh said in her review for \"TV Guide\", \"The Wachowski Brothers' through-the-looking-glass plot... manages to work surprisingly well on a number of levels: as a dystopian sci-fi thriller, as a brilliant excuse for the film's lavish and hyperkinetic fight scenes, and as a pretty compelling call to the dead-above-the-eyeballs masses to unite and cast off their chains... This dazzling pop allegory is steeped in a dark, pulpy sensibility that transcends nostalgic pastiche and stands firmly on its own merits.\"\n\n\"Salon\"s reviewer Andrew O'Hehir acknowledged that \"The Matrix\" is a fundamentally immature and unoriginal film (\"It lacks anything like adult emotion... all this pseudo-spiritual hokum, along with the overamped onslaught of special effects—some of them quite amazing—will hold 14-year-old boys in rapture, not to mention those of us of all ages and genders who still harbor a 14-year-old boy somewhere inside\"), but concluded, \"as in \"Bound\", there's an appealing scope and daring to The Wachowskis' work, and their eagerness for more plot twists and more crazy images becomes increasingly infectious. In a limited and profoundly geeky sense, this might be an important and generous film. The Wachowskis have little feeling for character or human interaction, but their passion for \"movies\"—for making them, watching them, inhabiting their world—is pure and deep.\"\n\nFilmmakers and science fiction creators alike generally took a complimentary perspective of \"The Matrix\". William Gibson, a key figure in cyberpunk fiction, called the film \"an innocent delight I hadn't felt in a long time,\" and stated, \"Neo is my favourite-ever science fiction hero, absolutely.\" Joss Whedon called the film \"my number one\" and praised its storytelling, structure and depth, concluding, \"It works on whatever level you want to bring to it.\" Darren Aronofsky commented, \"I walked out of \"The Matrix\" ... and I was thinking, 'What kind of science fiction movie can people make now?' The Wachowski Brothers basically took all the great sci-fi ideas of the 20th century and rolled them into a delicious pop culture sandwich that everyone on the planet devoured.\" M. Night Shyamalan expressed admiration for The Wachowskis, stating, \"Whatever you think of \"The Matrix\", every shot is there because of the passion they have! You can see they argued it out!\". Simon Pegg said that \"The Matrix\" provided \"the excitement and satisfaction that \"\" failed to inspire. \"The Matrix\" seemed fresh and cool and visually breathtaking; making wonderful, intelligent use of CGI to augment the on-screen action, striking a perfect balance of the real and the hyperreal. It was possibly the coolest film I had ever seen.\" Quentin Tarantino counted \"The Matrix\" as one of his twenty favourite movies from 1992 to 2009.\n\n\"The Matrix\" received Academy Awards for film editing, sound effects editing, visual effects, and sound. The filmmakers were competing against other films with established franchises, like \"\", yet they won all four of their nominations. \"The Matrix\" also received BAFTA awards for Best Sound and Best Achievement in Special Visual Effects, in addition to nominations in the cinematography, production design and editing categories. In 1999, it won Saturn Awards for Best Science Fiction Film and Best Direction.\n\n\"The Matrix\" had a strong effect on action film-making in Hollywood. The film's incorporation of wire fu techniques, including the involvement of fight choreographer Yuen Woo-ping and other personnel with a background in Hong Kong action cinema, affected the approaches to fight scenes taken by subsequent Hollywood action films, moving them towards more Eastern approaches. The success of \"The Matrix\" created high demand for those choreographers and their techniques from other filmmakers, who wanted fights of similar sophistication: for example, wire work was employed in \"X-Men\" (2000) and \"Charlie's Angels\" (2000), and Yuen Woo-ping's brother Yuen Cheung-Yan was choreographer on \"Daredevil\" (2003). \"The Matrix\"s Asian approach to action scenes also created an audience for Asian action films such as \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\" (2000) that they might not otherwise have had.\n\nFollowing \"The Matrix\", films made abundant use of slow-motion, spinning cameras, and, often, the bullet time effect of a character freezing or slowing down and the camera dollying around them. The ability to slow down time enough to distinguish the motion of bullets was used as a central gameplay mechanic of several video games, including \"Max Payne\", in which the feature was explicitly referred to as \"bullet time\". \"The Matrix\"s signature special effect, and other aspects of the film, have been parodied numerous times, in comedy films such as \"\" (1999), \"Scary Movie\" (2000), \"Shrek\" (2001), \"Kung Pow! Enter the Fist\" (2002); \"Marx Reloaded\" in which the relationship between Neo and Morpheus is represented as an imaginary encounter between Karl Marx and Leon Trotsky; and in video games such as \"Conker's Bad Fur Day\". It also inspired films featuring a black-clad hero, a sexy yet deadly heroine, and bullets ripping slowly through the air; these included \"Charlie's Angels\" (2000) featuring Cameron Diaz floating through the air while the cameras flo-mo around her; \"Equilibrium\" (2003), starring Christian Bale, whose character wore long black leather coats like Reeves' Neo; \"Night Watch\" (2004), a Russian megahit heavily influenced by \"The Matrix\" and directed by Timur Bekmambetov, who later made \"Wanted\" (2008), which also features bullets ripping through air; and \"Inception\" (2010), which centers on a team of sharply dressed rogues who enter a wildly malleable alternate reality by \"wiring in\". The original \"Tron\" (1982) paved the way for \"The Matrix\", and \"The Matrix\", in turn, inspired Disney to make its own Matrix with a \"Tron\" sequel, \"\" (2010).\n\nCarrie-Anne Moss asserted that prior to being cast in \"The Matrix\", she had \"no career\". It launched Moss into international recognition and transformed her career; in a \"New York Daily News\" interview, she stated, \"\"The Matrix\" gave me so many opportunities. Everything I've done since then has been because of that experience. It gave me so much\". The film also created one of the most devoted movie fan-followings since \"Star Wars\", and was even briefly blamed for the shootings at Columbine High School. The combined success of the \"Matrix\" trilogy, the \"Lord of the Rings\" films and the \"Star Wars\" prequels made Hollywood interested in creating trilogies. Stephen Dowling from the BBC noted that \"The Matrix\"s success in taking complex philosophical ideas and presenting them in ways palatable for impressionable minds might be its most influential aspect.\n\nIn 2001, \"The Matrix\" placed 66th in the American Film Institute's \"100 Years...100 Thrills\" list. In 2007, \"Entertainment Weekly\" called \"The Matrix\" the best science-fiction piece of media for the past 25 years. In 2009, the film was ranked 39th on \"Empire\"s reader-, actor- and critic-voted list of \"The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time\". \"The Matrix\" was voted as the fourth best sci-fi film in the 2011 list \"\", based on a poll conducted by ABC and \"People\". In 2012, the film was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being \"culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant.\"\n\nThe film's mainstream success led to the making of two sequels, \"The Matrix Reloaded\" and \"The Matrix Revolutions\", both directed by The Wachowskis. These were filmed back-to-back in one shoot and released on separate dates in 2003. The first film's introductory tale is succeeded by the story of the impending attack on the human enclave of Zion by a vast machine army. The sequels also incorporate longer and more ambitious action scenes, as well as improvements in bullet time and other visual effects.\n\nAlso released was \"The Animatrix\", a collection of nine animated short films, many of which were created in the same Japanese animation style that was a strong influence on the live action trilogy. \"The Animatrix\" was overseen and approved by The Wachowskis, who only wrote four of the segments themselves but did not direct any of them; much of the project was developed by notable figures from the world of anime.\n\nThe franchise also contains three video games: \"Enter the Matrix\" (2003), which contains footage shot specifically for the game and chronicles events taking place before and during \"The Matrix Reloaded\"; \"The Matrix Online\" (2004), an MMORPG which continued the story beyond \"The Matrix Revolutions\"; and \"\" (2005), which focuses on Neo's journey through the trilogy of films.\n\nThe franchise also includes \"The Matrix Comics\", a series of comics and short stories set in the world of \"The Matrix\", written and illustrated by figures from the comics industry. Most of the comics were originally presented for free on the official \"Matrix\" website; they were later republished, along with some new material, in two printed trade paperback volumes, called \"The Matrix Comics, Vol 1 and Vol 2\".\n\nIn March 2017, Warner Bros. was in early stages of developing a relaunch of the franchise with Zak Penn in talks to write a treatment and interest in getting Michael B. Jordan attached to star. According to \"The Hollywood Reporter\" neither The Wachowskis nor Joel Silver were involved with the endeavor, although the studio would like to get at minimum the blessing of The Wachowskis.\n\n\"The Matrix\" was released on LaserDisc on September 21st, 1999. VHS releases in both fullscreen and widescreen formats followed in December of that year. The film was released on DVD on May 15, 2007, and a Blu-ray release followed on October 14, 2008. It was also released on 4K HDR Blu-ray on May 22, 2018.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "748102", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=748102", "title": "Transcendental Club", "text": "Transcendental Club\n\nThe Transcendental Club was a group of New England intellectuals of the early-to-mid-19th century which gave rise to Transcendentalism.\n\nFrederic Henry Hedge, Ralph Waldo Emerson, George Ripley, and George Putnam (1807–1878; the Unitarian minister in Roxbury) met in Cambridge, Massachusetts on September 8, 1836, to discuss the formation of a new club; their first official meeting was held eleven days later at Ripley's house in Boston. Other members of the club included Amos Bronson Alcott, Orestes Brownson, Theodore Parker, Henry David Thoreau, William Henry Channing, James Freeman Clarke, Christopher Pearse Cranch, Convers Francis, Sylvester Judd, and Jones Very. Female members included Sophia Ripley, Margaret Fuller, Elizabeth Peabody, and Ellen Sturgis Hooper.\nOriginally, the group went by the name \"Hedge's Club\" because it usually met when Hedge was visiting from Bangor, Maine. The name Transcendental Club was given to the group by the public and not by its participants. The name was coined in a January 1837 review of Emerson's essay \"Nature\" and was intended disparagingly. James Elliot Cabot, a biographer of Emerson, wrote of the group as \"the occasional meetings of a changing body of liberal thinkers, agreeing in nothing but their liberality\". Hedge wrote: \"There was no club in the strict sense... only occasional meetings of like-minded men and women\". It was sometimes referred to by the nickname \"the brotherhood of the 'Like-Minded'\".\n\nThe club was a meeting-place for these young thinkers and an organizing ground for their idealist frustration with the general state of American culture and society at the time, and in particular, the state of intellectualism at Harvard University and in the Unitarian church. Much of their thinking centered on the shortcomings of Unitarianism.\n\nMany well-known American journals, including the \"North American Review\" and the \"Christian Examiner\", refused to accept submissions from the Transcendental Club for publication. In October 1839, members of the Transcendental Club had the idea of establishing their own periodical as a platform for their ideals. Initially, Brownson suggested utilizing his \"Boston Quarterly Review\", though others thought their own magazine was necessary. Hedge, Parker, and Emerson declined the role of editor. Ripley served as the managing editor and Fuller accepted the editor position on October 20, 1839, though she was unable to begin work on the publication until the first week of 1840. The first issue of \"The Dial\", with an introduction by Emerson calling it a \"Journal in a new spirit\", was published in July 1840. \n\nThe Transcendental Club likely did not have official meetings after September 1840, though they continued to correspond and attend each other's lectures. \"The Dial\" continued to be published, though it was never financially stable. In 1843, then business manager Elizabeth Peabody counted only two hundred subscribers and that its income was not covering production costs. It finally ceased publication in April 1844. Emerson's speech/essay \"Nature\" has been considered a manifesto of Transcendentalist ideas.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5594061", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5594061", "title": "Transcendental realism", "text": "Transcendental realism\n\nInitially developed by Roy Bhaskar in his book \"A Realist Theory of Science\" (1975), transcendental realism is a philosophy of science that was initially developed as an argument against epistemic realism of positivism and hermeneutics. The position is based on Bhaskar's transcendental arguments for certain ontological and epistemological positions based on what reality must be like in order for scientific knowledge to be possible. \n\nThe overview of transcendental realism that follows is largely based on Andrew Sayer's \"Realism and Social Science\".\n\nA \"Realist Theory of Science\" starts with a proposed paradox: how it is that people create knowledge as a product of social activities and at the same time knowledge is 'of' things that are not produced by people at all.\n\nThe former is inspired by Kuhnian arguments of how scientific communities develop knowledge and asserts all observation is theory-laden based on previously acquired concepts. As such, it is not a naïve realist perspective that knowledge is a direct acquisition of facts through observation of the real world, but rather that knowledge is fallible. This ontological position is described as the \"transitive domain of knowledge\", in that knowledge can change over time.\n\nThe second part of the paradox is asserted to be based on a real world, which exists and behaves in the same manner regardless of whether or not people exist or whether they know about the real world. This is described as the \"intransitive domain of knowledge\". Reducing knowledge to ontology is referred to as the \"epistemic fallacy\", a fallacy that Bhaskar asserts has been made repeatedly over the last 300 years of philosophy of science.\n\nThe exposition of transcendental realism continues that not only is the world divided into a real world and our knowledge of it, but it is further divided into the \"real\", the \"actual\" and the \"empirical\". The \"real\" is the intransitive domain of things that exist (i.e. the real world): objects, their structures and their causal powers. It is important to note that even though these objects and structures may be able to perform certain action, those actions may go unrealized. This gives rise to the \"actual\", which is the events that actually occur, regardless of whether or not people are aware of them. The \"empirical\" contains the events that people have actually experienced. It is important to note that experience may directly refer to the real and/or to the actual.\n\nTranscendental realism further argues for a stratified reality. The relationships between objects and the combinations of their causal powers may create entirely new structures with new causal powers. The typical example of this is of water, which has a causal power of extinguishing fire, but is made up of hydrogen and oxygen that have causal powers of combustion.\nThis stratification spans through all sciences: physics, chemistry, biology, sociology, etc. This implies that objects in sociology – labor markets, capitalism, etc. – are just as real as that of physics. This is not a reductionist position: while each stratum is dependent on the objects and their relationships in the strata below it, the difference in causal powers means that they are necessarily different objects.\n\nOther philosophies of science based on the Humean tradition assert that causality is based on regularity among sequences of events. For transcendental realism, this explanation of causation holds little weight — \"what causes something to happen has nothing to do with the number of times we have observed it happening\". Instead of referring to events, transcendental realism refers to causal mechanisms, the internal processes of objects which give rise to events. These mechanisms may lie dormant or may counteract each other and prevent events from occurring.\n\n\n"}

In 1765, after the king fired the chief magistrate and the case was retried by another court, Calas was posthumously exonerated and his family paid 36 thousand francs.\n\nVoltaire's argument is illustrated in the following passages:\n\n\"There are about forty millions of inhabitants in Europe who are not members of the Church of Rome; should we say to every one of them, 'Sir, since you are infallibly damned, I shall neither eat, converse, nor have any connections with you?'\";\n\n\"O different worshippers of a peaceful God! If you have a cruel heart, if, while you adore he whose whole law consists of these few words, \"Love God and your neighbor'...\"\n\n\"I see all the dead of past ages and of our own appearing in His presence. Are you very sure that our Creator and Father will say to the wise and virtuous Confucius, to the legislator Solon, to Pythagoras, Zaleucus, Socrates, Plato, the divine Antonins, the good Trajan, to Titus, the delights of mankind, to Epictetus, and to many others, models of men: 'Go, monsters, go and suffer torments that are infinite in intensity and duration. Let your punishment be eternal as I am. But you, my beloved ones, Jean Châtel, Ravaillac, Damiens, Cartouche, etc. who have died according to the prescribed rules, sit forever at my right hand and share my empire and my felicity.' You draw back with horror at these words; and after they have escaped me, I have nothing more to say to you.\"\n\nVoltaire finished the work by January 2, 1763, and it was printed by the Cramer brothers in Geneva in April 1763. After copies had been distributed to selected recipients include Madame de Pompadour, ministers of the French privy council, the king of Prussia, and some German princes, it began to be distributed in October 1763 and was quickly banned.\n\nIn January 2015, after the \"Charlie Hebdo\" shooting, it was reported that \"Treatise on Tolerance\" had become a bestseller in France more than 250 years after its first publication.\n\n"}
{"id": "533069", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=533069", "title": "Type (biology)", "text": "Type (biology)\n\nIn biology, a type is a particular specimen (or in some cases a group of specimens) of an organism to which the scientific name of that organism is formally attached. In other words, a type is an example that serves to anchor or centralize the defining features of that particular taxon. In older usage (pre-1900 in botany), a type was a taxon rather than a specimen.\n\nA taxon is a scientifically named grouping of organisms with other like organisms, a set that includes some organisms and excludes others, based on a detailed published description (for example a species description) and on the provision of type material, which is usually available to scientists for examination in a major museum research collection, or similar institution.\n\nAccording to a precise set of rules laid down in the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) and the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN), the scientific name of every taxon is almost always based on one particular \"specimen\", or in some cases specimens. Types are of great significance to biologists, especially to taxonomists. Types are usually physical specimens that are kept in a museum or herbarium research collection, but failing that, an image of an individual of that taxon has sometimes been designated as a type. Describing species and appointing type specimens is part of scientific nomenclature and alpha taxonomy.\n\nWhen identifying material, a scientist attempts to apply a taxon name to a specimen or group of specimens based on his or her understanding of the relevant taxa, based on (at least) having read the type description(s), preferably based on an examination of all the type material of all of the relevant taxa. If there is more than one named type that all appear to be the same taxon, then the oldest name takes precedence, and is considered to be the correct name of the material in hand. If on the other hand the taxon appears never to have been named at all, then the scientist or another qualified expert picks a type specimen and publishes a new name and an official description.\n\nThis process is crucial to the science of biological taxonomy. People's ideas of how living things should be grouped change and shift over time. How do we know that what we call \"\"Canis lupus\" is the same thing, or approximately the same thing, as what they will be calling \"Canis lupus\"\" in 200 years' time? It is possible to check this because there is a particular wolf specimen preserved in Sweden and everyone who uses that name – no matter what else they may mean by it – will include that particular specimen.\n\nDepending on the nomenclature code applied to the organism in question, a type can be a specimen, a culture, an illustration, or (under the bacteriological code) a description. Some codes consider a subordinate taxon to be the type, but under the botanical code the type is always a specimen or illustration.\n\nFor example, in the research collection of the Natural History Museum in London, there is a bird specimen numbered 1886.6.24.20. This is a specimen of a kind of bird commonly known as the spotted harrier, which currently bears the scientific name \"Circus assimilis\". This particular specimen is the holotype for that species; the name \"Circus assimilis\" refers, by definition, to the species of that particular specimen. That species was named and described by Jardine and Selby in 1828, and the holotype was placed in the museum collection so that other scientists might refer to it as necessary.\n\nNote that at least for type specimens there is no requirement for a \"typical\" individual to be used. Genera and families, particularly those established by early taxonomists, tend to be named after species that are more \"typical\" for them, but here too this is not always the case and due to changes in systematics \"cannot\" be. Hence, the term name-bearing type or onomatophore is sometimes used, to denote the fact that biological types do not define \"typical\" individuals or taxa, but rather fix a scientific name to a specific operational taxonomic unit. Type specimens are theoretically even allowed to be aberrant or deformed individuals or color variations, though this is rarely chosen to be the case, as it makes it hard to determine to which population the individual belonged.\n\nThe usage of the term \"type\" is somewhat complicated by slightly different uses in botany and zoology. In the \"PhyloCode\", type-based definitions are replaced by phylogenetic definitions.\n\nIn some older taxonomic works the word \"type\" has sometimes been used differently. The meaning was similar in the first \"Laws of Botanical Nomenclature\", but has a meaning closer to the term taxon in some other works:\nTranslation: This single character permits [one to] distinguish this type from all other species of the section ... After studying the diverse forms, I came to consider them as belonging to the one and the same specific type.\n\nIn botanical nomenclature, a \"type\" (\"typus\", \"nomenclatural type\"), \"is that element to which the name of a taxon is permanently attached.\" (article 7.1) In botany a type is either a specimen or an illustration. A specimen is a real plant (or one or more parts of a plant or a lot of small plants), dead and kept safe, \"curated\", in a herbarium (or the equivalent for fungi). Examples of where an illustration may serve as a type include:\n\nNote that a type does not determine the circumscription of the taxon. For example, the common dandelion is a controversial taxon: some botanists consider it to consist of over a hundred species, and others regard it as a single species. The type of the name \"Taraxacum officinale\" is the same whether the circumscription of the species includes all those small species (\"Taraxacum officinale\" is a \"big\" species) or whether the circumscription is limited to only one small species among the other hundred (\"Taraxacum officinale\" is a \"small\" species). The name \"Taraxacum officinale\" is the same and the type of the name is the same, but the extent of what the name actually applies to varies greatly. Setting the circumscription of a taxon is done by a taxonomist in a publication.\n\nMiscellaneous notes:\n\nThe \"ICN\" provides a listing of the various kinds of type (article 9), the most important of which is the holotype. These are\n\nNote that the word \"type\" appears in botanical literature as a part of some older terms that have no status under the \"ICN\": for example a clonotype.\n\nIn zoological nomenclature, the type of a species or subspecies is a specimen, or series of specimens. The type of a genus or subgenus is a species. The type of a suprageneric taxon (e.g., family, etc.) is a genus. Names higher than superfamily rank do not have types. A \"name-bearing type\" is a specimen or image that \"provides the objective standard of reference whereby the application of the name of a nominal taxon can be determined.\"\n\n\nAlthough in reality biologists may examine many specimens (when available) of a new taxon before writing an official published species description, nonetheless, under the formal rules for naming species (the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature), a single type must be designated, as part of the published description.\n\nA type description must include a diagnosis (typically, a discussion of similarities to and differences from closely related species), and an indication of where the type specimen or specimens are deposited for examination. The geographical location where a type specimen was originally found is known as its '. In the case of parasites, the term ' (or symbiotype) is used to indicate the host organism from which the type specimen was obtained.\n\nZoological collections are maintained by universities and museums. Ensuring that types are kept in good condition and made available for examination by taxonomists are two important functions of such collections. And, while there is only one \"holotype\" designated, there can be other \"type\" specimens, the following of which are formally defined:\n\nWhen a single specimen is clearly designated in the original description, this specimen is known as the \"holotype\" of that species. The holotype is typically placed in a major museum, or similar well-known public collection, so that it is freely available for later examination by other biologists.\n\nWhen the original description designated a holotype, there may still be additional specimens listed in the type series and those are termed paratypes. These are not name-bearing types.\n\nAn allotype is a specimen of the opposite sex to the holotype, designated from among paratypes. It was also formerly used for a specimen that shows features not seen in the holotype of a fossil. The term is not regulated by the ICZN.\n\nA neotype is a specimen later selected to serve as the single type specimen when an original holotype has been lost or destroyed or where the original author never cited a specimen.\n\nA syntype is any one of two or more specimens that is listed in a species description where no holotype was designated; historically, syntypes were often explicitly designated as such, and under the present ICZN this is a requirement, but modern attempts to publish species description based on syntypes are generally frowned upon by practicing taxonomists, and most are gradually being replaced by lectotypes. Those that still exist are still considered name-bearing types.\n\nA lectotype is a specimen later selected to serve as the single type specimen for species originally described from a set of syntypes.\nIn zoology, a lectotype is a kind of name-bearing type. When a species was originally described on the basis of a name-bearing type consisting of multiple specimens, one of those may be designated as the lectotype. Having a single name-bearing type reduces the potential for confusion, especially considering that it is not uncommon for a series of syntypes to contain specimens of more than one species.\n\nA notable example is that Carl Linnaeus is the lectotype for the species \"Homo sapiens\".\n\nA paralectotype is any additional specimen from among a set of syntypes, after a lectotype has been designated from among them. These are not name-bearing types.\n\nA special case in Protistans where the type consists of two or more specimens of \"directly related individuals representing distinct stages in the life cycle\"; these are collectively treated as a single entity, and lectotypes cannot be designated from among them.\n\nAn illustration on which a new species or subspecies was based. For instance, the Burmese Python, \"Python bivittatus,\" is one of many species that are based on illustrations by Albertus Seba (1734).\n\nAn ergatotype is a specimen selected to represent a worker member in hymenopterans which have polymorphic castes.\n\nType illustrations have also been used by zoologists, as in the case of the Réunion parakeet, which is known only from historical illustrations and descriptions.\n\nRecently, some species have been described where the type specimen was released alive back into the wild, such as the Bulo Burti boubou (a bushshrike), described as \"Laniarius liberatus\", in which the species description included DNA sequences from blood and feather samples. Assuming there is no future question as to the status of such a species, the absence of a type specimen does not invalidate the name, but it may be necessary in the future to designate a neotype for such a taxon, should any questions arise. However, in the case of the bushshrike, ornithologists have argued that the specimen was a rare and hitherto unknown color morph of a long-known species, using only the available blood and feather samples. While there is still some debate on the need to deposit actual killed individuals as type specimens, it can be observed that given proper vouchering and storage, tissue samples can be just as valuable should disputes about the validity of a species arise.\n\nThe various types listed above are necessary because many species were described one or two centuries ago, when a single type specimen, a holotype, was often not designated. Also, types were not always carefully preserved, and intervening events such as wars and fires have resulted in destruction of original type material. The validity of a species name often rests upon the availability of original type specimens; or, if the type cannot be found, or one has never existed, upon the clarity of the description.\n\nThe ICZN has existed only since 1961, when the first edition of the Code was published. The ICZN does not always demand a type specimen for the historical validity of a species, and many \"type-less\" species do exist. The current edition of the Code, Article 75.3, prohibits the designation of a neotype unless there is \"an exceptional need\" for \"clarifying the taxonomic status\" of a species (Article 75.2).\n\nThere are many other permutations and variations on terms using the suffix \"-type\" (e.g., allotype, cotype, topotype, generitype, isotype, isoneotype, isolectotype, etc.) but these are not formally regulated by the Code, and a great many are obsolete and/or idiosyncratic. However, some of these categories can potentially apply to genuine type specimens, such as a neotype; e.g., isotypic/topotypic specimens are preferred to other specimens, when they are available at the time a neotype is chosen (because they are from the same time and/or place as the original type).\n\nThe term fixation is used by the Code for the declaration of a name-bearing type, whether by original or subsequent designation.\n\nEach genus must have a designated type species (the term \"genotype\" was once used for this but has been abandoned because the word has become much better known as the term for a different concept in genetics). The description of a genus is usually based primarily on its type species, modified and expanded by the features of other included species. The generic name is permanently associated with the name-bearing type of its type species.\n\nIdeally, a type species best exemplifies the essential characteristics of the genus to which it belongs, but this is subjective and, ultimately, technically irrelevant, as it is not a requirement of the Code. If the type species proves, upon closer examination, to belong to a pre-existing genus (a common occurrence), then all of the constituent species must be either moved into the pre-existing genus, or disassociated from the original type species and given a new generic name; the old generic name passes into synonymy and is abandoned unless there is a pressing need to make an exception (decided case-by-case, via petition to the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature).\n\nA type genus is that genus from which the name of a family or subfamily is formed. As with type species, the type genus is not necessarily the most representative, but is usually the earliest described, largest or best known genus. It is not uncommon for the name of a family to be based upon the name of a type genus that has passed into synonymy; the family name does not need to be changed in such a situation.\n\n\n"}

However, the two are metaphysically equivalent. Achieving the 'state of Vajradhara' is synonymous with complete realisation.\n\nAccording to the Kagyu lineage, Buddha Vajradhara is the primordial Buddha, the Dharmakaya Buddha. He is depicted as dark blue in color, expressing the quintessence of buddhahood itself and representing the essence of the historical Buddha's realization of enlightenment.\n\nAs such, Buddha Vajradhara is thought to be the supreme essence of all (male) Buddhas (his name means \"Ruler of the Vajra Beings\"); It is the Tantric form of Sakyamuni which is called Vajradhara. Tantras are texts specific to Tantrism and are believed to have been originally taught by the Tantric form of Sakyamuni called Buddha Vajradhara. He is an expression of Buddhahood itself in both single and yabyum form. Buddha Vajradhara is considered to be the prime Buddha of the Father tantras (tib. pha-rgyud) such as Guhyasamaja, Yamantaka, and so on \n\nFrom the primordial Buddha Vajradhara/Samantabhadra Buddha /Dorje Chang were manifested the Five Wisdom Buddhas (Dhyani Buddhas):\n\nBuddha Vajradhara and the Wisdom Buddhas are often subjects of mandala.\n\nBuddha Vajradhara and Samantabhadra Buddha are cognate deities in Tibetan Buddhist cosmology with different names, attributes, appearances and iconography. Both are Dharmakaya Buddhas, that is primordial Buddhas: Samantabhadra is unadorned, that is depicted without any attributes; conversely, Buddha Vajradhara is often adorned and bears attributes, which is generally the iconographic representation of a Sambhogakaya Buddha. Both Buddha Vajradhara and Samantabhadra are generally depicted in yab-yum unity with their respective consorts and are primordial Buddhas, embodying void and ultimate emptiness.\n\nThe Trikaya doctrine (Sanskrit, literally \"Three bodies or personalities\"; 三身 Chinese: \"Sānshēn\", Japanese: \"sanjin\") is an important Buddhist teaching both on the nature of reality, and what a Buddha is. By the 4th century CE, the Trikaya Doctrine had assumed the form that we now know.\n\nBriefly, the doctrine says that a Buddha has three \"kayas\" or \"bodies\": the \"nirmanakaya\" or \"created body\" which manifests in time and space; the \"sambhogakaya\" or \"body of mutual enjoyment\" which is an archetypal manifestation; and the \"Dharmakaya\" or \"reality body\" which embodies the very principle of enlightenment and knows no limits or boundaries.\n\nIn the view of Anuyoga, the 'Mindstream' (Sanksrit: \"citta santana\") is the 'continuity' (Sanskrit: \"santana\"; Wylie: \"rgyud\") that links the Trikaya. The Trikaya, as a triune, is symbolised by the Gankyil.\n\n'Shining Relics of Enlightened Body' () is numbered amongst the 'Seventeen Tantras of Menngagde' () within Dzogchen discourse and is part of the textual support for the Vima Nyingtik. In the Dzogchen tantric text rendered in English as \"Shining Relics\" (), an enlightened personality entitled Buddha Vajradhara and a Dakini whose name may be rendered into English as \"Clear mind\" engage in discourse and dialogue which is a common convention in such esoteric Buddhist literature and tantric literature in general.\n\n\nNonsectarian movement\nSutra\n"}

He is a past president of the American Catholic Philosophical Association. In his trilogy, \"Being and The Between\", \"Ethics and The Between\", and \"God and The Between\", Desmond works out an entirely new and complete metaphysical/ontological philosophical system based on what he calls the potencies of being and the senses of being. His most original contribution in his metaphysics is the notion of the \"metaxological\", which will be explained below. Desmond's program consists mainly in exploring the senses in which modernity has devalued being and what \"to be\" and \"the good\" might mean.\n\nThe ethos can be defined as the ontological matrix of value at any given time. For Desmond the human self always lives in what he calls the ethos. The ethos is where we bring morality and concrete good through our power of affirming. Simultaneously, we receive the hospitality of the ethos through what Desmond calls the \"agapeic origin of the good\". The origin is the \"original givenness that frees beings into their freedom\" and must be understood as an agapeic gift which is overdetermined and thus cannot be aptly described or determined univocally or dialectically. As a consequence of this overdetermined origin as gift, we both generate and are generated by the\n\nWithin the ethos there are seven potencies of being. This \"enabling repertoire of self becoming\" has the \"character of an endowment\", and is thus seen as a gift.

The seven potencies are:\n\nWithin the ontological matrix of being, the different potencies can be expressed differently through the senses of being. These ways in which to express the potencies help explore the relations of sameness and difference within the ethos. The four potencies are:\n\nDifferent philosophers can be seen as embodying different potencies and senses of being throughout the history of philosophy. Kant, for instance, is best defined as a transcendental univocalist. Nietzsche would come close to something like an aesthete given his acknowledgment of the aesthetic/sensual part of being; he is, however, described by Desmond as being defined by the transcending potency and being both equivocal and a dialectician. Hegel might be defined as a dialectician. Desmond believes, however, that all of these philosophers are somehow haunted by those potencies which they seek to ignore or devalue. There is a dialectics in Kant and there are equivocities in Nietzsche. \"Metaxological vigilance\" shows a clearer picture of the ethos than do any views that restrict philosophical considerations to the other senses of being and potencies.\n\n\n\n"}

He was best known for his studies of German philosophers, most notably Hegel, some of whose works he translated into highly regarded English editions. Although he had a somewhat forbidding manner, he was known as an able and effective teacher and writer who succeeded in greatly improving the understanding of German philosophy in the English-speaking world. He died at the age of 52 after a bicycle accident near Oxford.\n\nWallace was born at Railway Place in Cupar, Fife, the son of master-builder James Wallace and Jane Kelloch. He was the elder of two brothers and was educated at Madras Academy (now Bell Baxter High School) in Cupar before going on to St Andrews University to study arts. He developed a strong interest in the natural world, which led him to spend much time on walks in the countryside, cycling, botany and mountaineering.\n\nAlthough his parents had encouraged him to take up the study of theology as a precursor to a career in the clergy, Wallace realised that this would not best suit him and chose instead to study the Classics. He was awarded an exhibition at Balliol College, Oxford, where he studied from 1864. In 1867 he became a fellow of Merton College. He gained his Bachelor of Arts the following year, gaining a first class in Moderations and in Literae Humaniores. He was also awarded the Gaisford Prize in 1867 for his work on Greek prose, becoming a tutor at Merton in the same year, and was elected as a Craven Scholar in 1869. His Master of Arts followed in 1871 and he was appointed as Merton's librarian.\n\nWallace married Janet Barclay, a childhood friend from Cupar, on 4 April 1872. The couple had three children, a daughter and two sons. His younger brother Edwin Wallace studied at Oxford's Lincoln College and later served as vice-provost of Worcester College between 1881 and his death in 1884. In 1882, Wallace became the successor to Thomas Hill Green as White's Professor of Moral Philosophy at Oxford, a position which he held along with the Merton tutorship until his death fifteen years later.\n\nHis \"brusque and sarcastic\" manner earned him the nickname \"the Dorian\", a nickname he acquired at Balliol, though this was said to conceal a \"generous and affectionate\" nature. He was described as a man of \"much genuine nobleness and a staunch uprightness of thought and speech\" whose \"acquaintances were numerous and friendly, but his intimates few and attached.\"\n\nWallace's work focused primarily on the study and diffusion of the ideas of the German philosophers Kant, Fichte, Herder, and Hegel, of whom it was said that his knowledge was exceptional. He was highly regarded as a teacher and lecturer, usually speaking without notes in a style described as \"humorous, elegant, and yet earnest\" that \"produced a unique impression of insight and sincerity upon his students.\" He sought to encourage his students to think critically and aimed to explain the sometimes arcane and technical nature of philosophical constructs in a way that was both readily understandable and expressed imaginatively, for instance commenting in one of his works that \"the Absolute Idea [of Hegel] may be compared to the old man who utters the same creed as a child, but for whom it is pregnant with the significance of a lifetime\".\n\nHis writings included \"The Logic and Prolegomena of Hegel\" (1873), a translation of Hegel's \"Encyclopaedia of the Philosophical Sciences\". It was still regarded as \"the most masterly and influential of all English translations of Hegel\" when it was republished in 1975. The translation was accomplished in a free and creative style accompanied by extensive explanatory notes on the text, drawing parallels between the philosophy of Hegel and classical figures such as Plato and Aristotle. He published \"Epicurean Philosophy\" in 1880, tracing the origins of Epicureanism and highlighting the links between the life of Epicurus and the philosophy that he espoused.\n\nWallace's \"Kant\" (1882), part of Blackwood's Philosophical Classics series, portrayed the German philosopher as engaged in a dialogue with John Locke and David Hume, two of the most influential British Empiricists. He published \"The Life of Arthur Schopenhauer\" in 1890 in which his biographical account was accompanied by a critique of the philosopher's rejection of empiricism and materialism. He attacked Schopenhauer's \"unconquerable vanity\" but praised his insight into the power of art and his belief that \"the best life is one predicated on the underlying unity of all experience\". He travelled extensively to research both works, touring Germany to learn about the cultural and geographical environment in which the German philosophers had lived and worked.\n\nA second edition of \"The Logic of Hegel\" followed in 1892 and a third edition was published in 1893 with a lengthy analytical introduction. Wallace's work on Hegel focused on the themes that most resonated with a British audience, such as unity and community, while giving relatively less attention to more alien ideas such as the dialectic. In 1894 he published a translation of the last part of Hegel's \"Encyclopaedia\" under the title of \"The Philosophy of Mind\", accompanied by five essays commenting on questions such as the method of psychology and how it related to ethics and theology. His final work, published posthumously by Edward Caird, was his \"Lectures and Essays on Natural Theology and Ethics\" which he had delivered in 1892 at the University of Glasgow as part of the Gifford Lectures on the history of natural theology.\n\nWallace died on 19 February 1897 as a result of a bicycle accident. While descending a steep hill at Enslow Bridge at Bletchington near Oxford, he lost control of his bicycle and hit a parapet wall, fracturing his skull. He was found unconscious under his bicycle and was carried on a hurdle to The Rock of Gibraltar Inn, where he died early the next day without regaining consciousness. He is buried in Holywell Cemetery, Oxford, with his wife and one of his sons.\n\n\n"}
