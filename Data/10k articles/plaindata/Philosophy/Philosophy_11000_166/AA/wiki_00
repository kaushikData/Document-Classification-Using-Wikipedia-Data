It was founded in 1540 by Leone Orsini, and was dissolved somewhere between 1545 and 1550.\n\nThis academy should not be confused with another Accademia degli Infiammati which was established at Forlimpopoli in 1624 by Dominican friar Giovanni della Robbia.\n\nThe Paduan Academy's emblem featured Hercules on fire on Mount Oite, with the motto \"Arso il mortale al ciel n’andrà l’eterno\" (\"Burned being the Mortal, to Heaven will Ascend the Eternal\"). Notable members and collaborators were Sperone Speroni, Benedetto Varchi, Pietro Aretino, Girolamo Preti Luigi Alamanni, Ugolino Martelli, Alessandro Piccolomini, and Angelo Beolco (el Ruzante).\n\nSome of the Academy's activities were conducted in Greek and Latin. However, the vulgar Venetian and Tuscan languages became prevalent after Speroni, a staunch defender of the vernacular, presided over the academy in 1542.\n\nIn this period the Academy promoted lectures (\"Lezioni\") on vernacular poetry, such as on Bembo's sonnets \"Piansi e cantai l'aspra guerra\" and \"Verdeggi all'Apennin la fronte, e 'l petto\", by Martelli, and on Forteguerri's sonnet \"Ora ten va superbo, or corre altero\", by Piccolomini.\n\nIn 1540, Giovanni Mazzuoli da Strada founded at his home in Florence the Accademia degli Umidi (\"Academy of the Wet Ones\"). Originally meant to be just a parody of the newly created Paduan Academy, devoted to amateur and burlesque activities, it eventually became the respectable and prestigious Accademia Fiorentina.\n"}

His book \"Denken und Wirklichkeit\" (\"Thought and Reality\") exerted a \"lasting impact\" on the writings of Friedrich Nietzsche.\n\nSpir was born on 15 November 1837 in his father's estates of Spirovska, near the city of Elisavetgrad (Elizabethgrad, Kherson Governorate, Russian Empire now Kropyvnytskyi, Ukraine). His father, Alexander Alexandrovich Spir, of German descent, was a Russian surgeon—Chief Physician of the military Hospital of Odessa specifically—and former professor of mathematics in Moscow. In 1812, he received the Order of St. Vladimir, was knighted, and became councillor and member of Kherson's Governorate hereditary nobility. His mother, Helena Constantinovna Spir, daughter of the major Poulevich, was on her mother's side the granddaughter of the Greek painter Logino, who arrived in Russia under the reign of Catherine the Great. Alexander Spir gave each of his five children—four boys and one girl—names chosen in an old Greek Calendar, this is the source of the curious name \"Afrikan\". Spir disliked his Christian name, simply signing his letters and books \"A. Spir\". His modesty impelled him not to use either the German \"von\" or the French \"de\"—denoting his noble status—before his family name. He described his education as follows: \"I spent my childhood in the countryside and later I studied for a while in Odessa, first in a Private boarding-school and after in a Gymnasium, more or less equivalent, if I do not mistake, to a French high-school. I have not been at the University, instead I entered the Midshipmen's School in Nikolayev (now Mykolaiv), not far from the Black Sea.\" During this period he developed an interest in philosophy and read (in the French translation of Tissot) Immanuel Kant’s \"Critique of Pure Reason\", which gave him the basis of his speculative thought. He later followed the readings of Descartes, David Hume, and Stuart Mill.\n\nIn 1855, at the age of 18, he participated as Sub-lieutenant of the Russian navy in the Crimean War, during which he was twice decorated (Order of St. Andrew and Order of St. George). Spir defended the same bastion (N. 4 at Malakoff) as Leo Tolstoy during the siege of Sevastopol. After his father’s death in 1852, he inherited his father’s estates (his last remaining brother, the poet Aristarch, having died in 1841) whereupon he emancipated his serfs and gave them land, goods and money, presaging the reform of 1861. In 1862, he left Elizabethgrad for a tour in Germany, where he spent two years \"to know better the mind's matter\". His sister Charitis died soon after his return to Russia in 1864. After the death of his mother, in 1867, he sold his estates at a ridiculously low price, distributed almost all of his possessions and left Russia permanently.\n\nHe first went to Leipzig, where he attended the lectures of Moritz Wilhelm Drobisch (1802–1896), a Herbartian philosopher and one of the forerunners of the Neo-Kantian revival of the 1860s. He was there at the same time that Nietzsche was a student, although it does not appear that they met. In 1869, he moved to Tübingen and to Stuttgart in 1871. Here, at the orthodox Church of the Court, he married on 30 January 1872, Elisabeth (Elise) Gatternich and the two had a daughter, Hélène. In Leipzig, Spir befriended the publisher and fellow Freemason Joseph Gabriel Findel, who published most of Spir’s works. His most important book, \"Denken und Wirklichkeit: Versuch einer Erneuerung der kritischen Philosophie\" (\"Thought and Reality: Attempt at a Renewal of Critical Philosophy\") was published in 1873. A second edition, which was the one owned by Nietzsche, was published in 1877. In an attempt to reach a broader readership, Spir wrote directly in French his \"Esquisses de philosophie critique\" (\"Outlines of critical philosophy\"), published for the first time in 1877. A new edition was published forty years after his death, in 1930, with an introduction by the French philosopher and professor at the Sorbonne Léon Brunschvicg.\n\nIn 1878, having suffered from pneumonia, in order to treat the consequences of his illness, a chronic cough, Spir moved to Lausanne, Switzerland, where he spent five years. In 1884, Spir asked the Russian Emperor authorization to leave Russian citizenship and to obtain Swiss citizenship. In the same year, he received the imperial authorization and applied for a certificate of registry at Belmont-sur-Lausanne, where he lived with his family. In 1886, to enjoy the facilities of a bigger library (the \"Société de Lecture\", a private reading society), he moved to Geneva. On 17 September 1889, he received from the Swiss Federal Government the authorization for his wife, his daughter, and himself to become Swiss citizens. He died of influenza in Geneva, at 6 rue Petitot, on 26 March 1890. He was buried in the Saint-Georges cemetery. He was survived by his wife Elisabeth and his daughter, Hélène.\n\nManuscripts, personal papers, photographs, books by or on African Spir were donated in March 1940 by his daughter Hélène Claparède-Spir (who was married to the swiss neurologist Édouard Claparède) to the Library of Geneva (Bibliothèque de Genève, formerly Bibliothèque Publique et Universitaire de Genève), where they compose the \"Fonds African Spir\" and can be consulted.\n\nOther papers concerning Spir, his daughter Hélène Claparède-Spir and her family can be consulted at Harvard University Library.\n\n\nDue to his personal readings and his attending of Drobisch's lectures, Spir must be considered as a Neo-Kantian philosopher. Spir referred to his philosophy as \"critical philosophy\". He sought to establish philosophy as the science of first principles, he held that the task of philosophy was to investigate immediate knowledge, show the delusion of empiricism, and present the true nature of things by strict statements of facts and logically controlled inference. This method led Spir to proclaim the principle of identity (or law of identity, \"A\" ≡ \"A\") as the fundamental law of knowledge, which is opposed to the changing appearance of the empirical reality.\n\nFor Spir the principle of identity is not only the fundamental law of knowledge, it is also an ontological principle, expression of the unconditioned essence of reality (Realität=Identität mit sich), which is opposed to the empirical reality (Wirklichkeit), which in turn is evolution (Geschehen). The principle of identity displays the essence of reality: only that which is identical to itself is real, the empirical world is ever-changing, therefore it is not real. Thus the empirical world has an illusory character, because phenomena are ever-changing, and empirical reality is unknowable.\n\nReligion, morality and philosophy, have for Spir the same theoretical foundation: the principle of identity, which is the characteristic of the supreme being, of the absolute, of God. God is not the creator deity of the universe and mankind, but man's true nature and the norm of all things, in general. The moral and religious conscience live in the consciousness of the contrast between this norm (Realität) and empirical reality (Wirklichkeit).\n\"There is a radical dualism between the empirical nature of man and his moral nature\" and the awareness of this dualism is the sole true foundation of moral judgment.\n\nSocially, Spir was not favourable to inherited wealth's accumulation in private hands and demanded just distribution of material goods, but disapproved of collectivism. He set the example, redistributing his personal inherited land properties to his former serfs.\n\nAlthough he spent most of his life as a philosopher, Spir never held a university appointment and his writings remained relatively unknown and unrecognized throughout his life. Indeed, Spir complained of a wall or conspiracy of silence (\"das Totschweigen\"). Yet, he had a significant influence on several eminent philosophers, scholars and writers such as Hans Vaihinger, Friedrich Nietzsche, William James, Leo Tolstoy and Rudolf Steiner. Vaihinger read Spir's \"Thought and Reality\" as soon as it was published (1873) and recalls that it made a \"great impression\". Nietzsche described him as \"an outstanding logician\" (\"ein ausgezeichneter Logiker\"). James makes several references to Spir in his Principles of Psychology, for example when debating a certain Kantian issue he wrote, \"On the whole, the best recent treatment of the question known to me is in one of A. Spir's works, his \"Denken und Wirklichkeit\".\nIn 1896 Leo Tolstoy read \"Thought and Reality\" and was also deeply impressed, as he mentioned in a letter to Hélène Claparède-Spir: \"reading \"Thought and Reality\" has been a great joy for me. I do not know a philosopher so profound and at the same time so precise, I mean scientific, accepting only what is strictly necessary and clear for everybody. I am sure that his doctrine will be understood and appreciated as it deserves and that the destiny of his work will be similar to that of Schopenhauer, who became known and admired only after his death\".\n\nIn his (2 May 1896) Tolstoy wrote: \"Still another important event the work [\"Thought and Reality\"] of African Spir. I just read through what I wrote in the beginning of this notebook. At bottom, it is nothing else than a short summary of all of Spir's philosophy which I not only had not read at that time, but about which I had not the slightest idea. This work clarified my ideas on the meaning of life remarkably, and in some ways strengthened them. The essence of his doctrine is that things do not exist, but only our impressions which appear to us in our conception as objects. Conception (Vorstellung) has the quality of believing in the existence of objects. This comes from the fact that the quality of thinking consists in attributing an objectivity to impressions, a substance, and a projecting of them into space\". The next day (3 May 1896) he added, \"I am reading Spir all the time, and the reading provokes a mass of thoughts\".\n\nThe most important works on Spir's philosophy were published between 1900 and 1914 (Lessing, Zacharoff, Segond, Huan, Martinetti).\n\nIn a lecture given in 1917, Rudolf Steiner called Spir \"extraordinarily fascinating\" and an \"original thinker\", and someone possessed of a \"subtlety\" not found in his 19th century contemporaries. As a consequence, Spir was unfortunately not understood and \"suffered all the distress that a thinker can experience from being entirely ignored; killed by silence as the saying goes\".\n\nAfter the first World War, the interpretation of Spir's thought by the Italian philosopher Piero Martinetti (1872–1943) gave it a second life for a short while, in the form of a \"religious idealism\".\n\nBefore the second World War, Hélène Claparède-Spir published some new editions of her father's books in French and had an extensive exchange of letters to promote her father's thought. In 1937, for the centennial of Spir's birth, Martinetti published in Italy a monographic edition on Spir of the \"Rivista di Filosofia\" (\"Philosophical Review\").\n\nAfter the second World War, African Spir fell into oblivion. In 1990, for the centennial of Spir's death in Geneva, the Geneva Public Library organized an exhibition of African Spir's corpus and published the analytical catalogue. Many of Spir's books have not been entirely sold and are still available in their first or second edition (in German, French, Italian, English, or Spanish translations). Presumably, due to the increasing interest in the argument at the beginning of the twenty-first century, a reprint of the Italian translation by Odoardo Campa in 1911 of Spir's \"Moralität und Religion\" (1874) has been published in 2008.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1957", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1957", "title": "Alexander Technique", "text": "Alexander Technique\n\nThe Alexander Technique, named after its creator Frederick Matthias Alexander, is an educational process that was created to retrain habitual patterns of movement and posture. Alexander believed that poor habits in posture and movement damaged spatial self-awareness as well as health, and that movement efficiency could support overall physical well-being. He saw the technique as a mental training technique as well.\n\nAlexander began developing his technique's principles in the 1890s in an attempt to address voice loss during public speaking. He credited his method with allowing him to pursue his passion for reciting in Shakespearean theater.\n\nSome proponents of the Alexander Technique say that it addresses a variety of health conditions related to cumulative physical behaviors but there is little evidence to support these claims. As of 2015 there was evidence suggesting the Alexander Technique may be helpful for long-term back pain, long-term neck pain, and may help people cope with Parkinson's disease.\n\nFrederick Matthias Alexander (1869–1955) was a Shakespearean orator from Tasmania, who developed voice loss during his unamplified performances. After doctors found no physical cause, Alexander reasoned that he was inadvertently damaging himself while speaking. He observed himself in multiple mirrors and saw that he was contracting his posture in preparation for any speech. He hypothesized that a habitual conditioned pattern (of pulling his head backwards and downwards) needlessly was disrupting the normal working of his total postural, breathing, and vocal processes.\n\nWith experimentation, Alexander developed the ability to stop the unnecessary and habitual contracting in his neck, displacement of his head, and shortening of his stature. As he became practised at speaking without these interferences, he found that his problem with recurrent voice loss was resolved. While on a recital tour in New Zealand (1895), he came to believe in the wider significance of improved carriage for overall physical functioning although evidence from his own publications appears to indicate it happened less systematically and over a long period of time.\n\nThe American philosopher and educator John Dewey became impressed with the Alexander Technique after his headaches, neck pains, blurred vision, and stress symptoms largely improved during the time he used Alexander's advice to change his posture. In 1923, Dewey wrote the introduction to Alexander's \"Constructive Conscious Control of the Individual\".\n\nAldous Huxley had transformative lessons with Alexander, and continued doing so with other teachers after moving to the US. He rated Alexander's work highly enough to base the character of the doctor who saves the protagonist in 'Eyeless in Gaza' (an experimental form of autobiographical work) on F.M. Alexander, putting many of his phrases into the character's mouth. Huxley's work 'The Art of Seeing' also discusses his views on the technique.\n\nSir Stafford Cripps, George Bernard Shaw, Henry Irving and other stage grandees, Lord Lytton and other eminent people of the era also wrote positive appreciations of his work after taking lessons with Alexander.\n\nSince Alexander's work in the field came at the start of the 20th century, his ideas influenced many originators in the field of mind-body improvement. Fritz Perls, who originated Gestalt therapy, credited Alexander as an inspiration for his psychological work. The Mitzvah Technique was influenced by the Alexander Technique; as was the Feldenkrais Method - who expanded on the one exercise in Alexander Technique called \"The Whispered Ah.\"\n\nAlexander's approach emphasizes awareness strategies applied to conducting oneself while in action, (which could be now called 'mindful' action, though in his four books he did not use that term.)\n\nActions such as sitting, squatting, lunging or walking are often selected by the teacher. Other actions may be selected by the student that is tailored to their interests or work activities: hobbies, computer use, lifting, driving or artistic performance or practice, sports, speech or horseback riding. Alexander teachers often use themselves as examples. They demonstrate, explain, and analyze a student's moment-to-moment responses as well as using mirrors, video feedback or classmate observations. Guided modelling with a highly skilled light hand contact is the primary tool for detecting and guiding the student into a more coordinated state in movement and at rest during in-person lessons. Suggestions for improvements are often student-specific, as everyone starts out with slightly different habits.\n\nExercise as a teaching tool is deliberately omitted because of a common mistaken assumption that there exists a \"correct\" position. There are only two specific procedures that are practiced by the student; the first is lying semi-supine. Resting in this way uses \"mechanical advantage\" as a means of redirecting long-term and short-term accumulated muscular tension into a more integrated and balanced state. This position is sometimes referred to as \"constructive rest\", or \"the balanced resting state\". It's also a specific time to practice Alexander's principle of conscious \"directing\" without \"doing\". The second exercise is the \"Whispered Ah\", which is used to co-ordinate freer breathing and vocal production.\n\nFreedom, efficiency and patience are the prescribed values. Proscribed are unnecessary effort, self-limiting habits as well as mistaken perceptual conclusions about the nature of training and experimentation. Students are led to change their largely automatic routines that are interpreted by the teacher to currently or cumulatively be physically limiting, inefficient, or not in keeping with best \"use\" of themselves as a whole. The Alexander teacher provides verbal coaching while monitoring, guiding and preventing unnecessary habits at their source with a specialized hands-on assistance.\n\nThis specialized hands-on skill also allows Alexander teachers to bring about a balanced working of the student's supportive musculature as it relates to gravity's downward pull from moment to moment. Often, students require a great deal of hands-on work in order to first gain an experience of a fully poised relation to gravity and themselves. The hands-on skill requires Alexander teachers to maintain in themselves from moment-to-moment their own improved psycho-physical co-ordination that the teacher is communicating to the student.\n\nAlexander developed terminology to describe his methods, outlined in his four books that explain the experience of learning and substituting new improvements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Directing\" serves to counteract the common backward and downward pull and shortening in stature that can be detected at the beginning of every movement - particularly addressing a startle pattern of \"fight, flight or freeze.\" A mere thought, as a projection of intention, shapes preparatory movement below the level of sensing it. Alexander used these words for reshaping these subliminal preparations: \"The neck to be free, the head to go forward and up, the back to lengthen and widen.\" Some teachers have shortened this to a suggestion of, \"Freer?\" Negative directions (that use Alexander's other preventive principle of \"inhibition\") have also been found to be effective, because negative directions leave the positive response open-ended.\nWhichever is used, all \"Directing\" is suggestively thought, (rather than willfully accomplished.) This is because the neuro-muscular responses to \"Directing\" often occur underneath one's ability to perceive how they are actually carried out neuro-physiologically and neuro-cognitively. As freedom of expression or movement is the objective, the most appropriate responses cannot be anticipated or expected, only observed and chosen in the moment. \nTeacher trainees gradually learn to include a constant attending to their lengthening in stature in every movement. It becomes a basis for initiating and continuing every action, every response to stimuli or while remaining constructively at rest.\n\n\nThe Alexander Technique is used and taught by classically trained vocal coaches and musicians in schools and private lessons. Its advocates state that it allows for a balanced use of all aspects of the vocal tract by consciously increasing air-flow, allowing improved vocal skill and tone. The method is said by actors to reduce stage fright and to increase spontaneity.\n\nThe Alexander Technique is a frequent component in acting training, because it can assist the actor in being more natural in performance.\n\nAccording to Alexander Technique instructor Michael J. Gelb, people tend to study the Alexander Technique for reasons of personal development.\n\nThe Alexander Technique is most commonly taught privately in a series of 10 to 40 private lessons which may last from 30 minutes to an hour. Students are often performers, such as actors, dancers, musicians, athletes and public speakers, people who work on computers, or those who are in frequent pain for other reasons. Instructors observe their students, then show them how to move with better poise and less strain. Sessions include chair work - often in front of a mirror, during which the instructor and the student will stand, sit and lie down, moving efficiently while maintaining a comfortable relationship between the head, neck and spine, and table work or physical manipulation.\n\nTo qualify as a teacher of Alexander Technique, instructors are required to complete 1,600 hours, spanning three years, of supervised teacher training. The result must be satisfactory to qualified peers to gain membership in professional societies.\n\nSome advocates for the Alexander technique have claimed it can help people with many kinds of health conditions.\n\nOne example is a claim that it can benefit people with asthma. A 2012 Cochrane systematic review found that there is no conclusive evidence that the Alexander technique is effective for treating asthma, and randomized clinical trials are needed in order to assess the effectiveness of this type of treatment approach.\n\nA review by Aetna last updated in 2016 stated: \"Aetna considers the following alternative medicine interventions experimental and investigational, because there is inadequate evidence in the peer-reviewed published medical literature of their effectiveness.\" Included is Alexander technique in that list.\n\nA review published in 2015 and conducted for the Australia Department of Health in order to determine what services the Australian government should pay for, reviewed clinical trials published to date and found that: \"Overall, the evidence was limited by the small number of participants in the intervention arms, wide confidence intervals or a lack of replication of results.\" It concluded that: \"The Alexander technique may improve short-term pain and disability in people with low back pain, but the longer-term effects remain uncertain. For all other clinical conditions, the effectiveness of Alexander technique was deemed to be uncertain, due to insufficient evidence.\" It also noted that: \"Evidence for the safety of\nAlexander technique was lacking, with most trials not reporting on this outcome. Subsequently in 2017 the Australian government named the Alexander Technique as a practice that would not qualify for insurance subsidy, saying this step would \"ensure taxpayer funds are expended appropriately and not directed to therapies lacking evidence\".\n\nA review of evidence for Alexander Technique for various health conditions provided by UK NHS Choices last updated in July 2015 found that:\nThere's evidence suggesting the Alexander technique can help people with:\n\n\"NHS Choices\" also states that \"some research has also suggested the Alexander technique may improve general long-term pain, stammering and balance skills in elderly people to help them avoid falls. But the evidence in these areas is limited and more studies are needed. There's currently little evidence to suggest the Alexander technique can help improve other health conditions, including asthma, headaches, osteoarthritis, difficulty sleeping (insomnia) and stress.\"\n\nA review published in \"BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine\" in 2014 focused on \"the evidence for the effectiveness of AT sessions on musicians' performance, anxiety, respiratory function and posture\" concluded that: \"Evidence from RCTs and CTs suggests that AT sessions may improve performance anxiety in musicians. Effects on music performance, respiratory function and posture yet remain inconclusive.\"\n\nA review published in the \"International Journal of Clinical Practice\" in 2012 found: \"Strong evidence exists for the effectiveness of Alexander Technique lessons for chronic back pain and moderate evidence in Parkinson’s-associated disability. Preliminary evidence suggests that Alexander Technique lessons may lead to improvements in balance skills in the elderly, in general chronic pain, posture, respiratory function and stuttering, but there is insufficient evidence to support recommendations in these areas.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "784", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=784", "title": "Alfred Korzybski", "text": "Alfred Korzybski\n\nAlfred Habdank Skarbek Korzybski (; July 3, 1879 – March 1, 1950) was a Polish-American independent scholar who developed a field called general semantics, which he viewed as both distinct from, and more encompassing than, the field of semantics. He argued that human knowledge of the world is limited both by the human nervous system and the languages humans have developed, and thus no one can have direct access to reality, given that the most we can know is that which is filtered through the brain's responses to reality. His best known dictum is \"The map is not the territory\".\n\nBorn in Warsaw, Poland, then part of the Russian Empire, Korzybski belonged to an aristocratic Polish family whose members had worked as mathematicians, scientists, and engineers for generations. He learned the Polish language at home and the Russian language in schools; and having a French and German governess, he became fluent in four languages as a child.\n\nKorzybski studied engineering at the Warsaw University of Technology. During the First World War (1914-1918) Korzybski served as an intelligence officer in the Russian Army. After being wounded in a leg and suffering other injuries, he moved to North America in 1916 (first to Canada, then to the United States) to coordinate the shipment of artillery to Russia. He also lectured to Polish-American audiences about the conflict, promoting the sale of war bonds. After the war he decided to remain in the United States, becoming a naturalized citizen in 1940. He met Mira Edgerly,\na painter of portraits on ivory, shortly after the1918 Armistice; They married in January 1919; the marriage lasted until his death.\n\nE. P. Dutton published Korzybski's first book, \"Manhood of Humanity\", in 1921. In this work he proposed and explained in detail a new theory of humankind: mankind as a \"time-binding\" class of life (humans perform time binding by the transmission of knowledge and abstractions through time which become accreted in cultures).\n\nKorzybski's work culminated in the initiation of a discipline that he named general semantics (GS). This should not be confused with semantics. The basic principles of general semantics, which include time-binding, are described in the publication \"Science and Sanity\", published in 1933. In 1938 Korzybski founded the Institute of General Semantics in Chicago. The post-World War II housing shortage in Chicago cost him the Institute's building lease, so in 1946 he moved the Institute to Lakeville, Connecticut, U.S., where he directed it until his death in 1950.\n\nKorzybski maintained that humans are limited in what they know by (1) the structure of their nervous systems, and (2) the structure of their languages. Humans cannot experience the world directly, but only through their \"abstractions\" (nonverbal impressions or \"gleanings\" derived from the nervous system, and verbal indicators expressed and derived from language). These sometimes mislead us about what is the truth. Our understanding sometimes lacks \"similarity of structure\" with what is actually happening.\n\nHe sought to train our awareness of abstracting, using techniques he had derived from his study of mathematics and science. He called this awareness, this goal of his system, \"consciousness of abstracting\". His system included the promotion of attitudes such as \"I don't know; let's see,\" in order that we may better discover or reflect on its realities as revealed by modern science. Another technique involved becoming inwardly and outwardly quiet, an experience he termed, \"silence on the objective levels\".\n\nMany devotees and critics of Korzybski reduced his rather complex system to a simple matter of what he said about the verb form \"is\" of the general verb \"to be.\" His system, however, is based primarily on such terminology as the different \"orders of abstraction,\" and formulations such as \"consciousness of abstracting.\" The contention that Korzybski \"opposed\" the use of the verb \"to be\" would be a profound exaggeration.\n\nHe thought that \"certain uses\" of the verb \"to be\", called the \"is of identity\" and the \"is of predication\", were faulty in structure, e.g., a statement such as, \"Elizabeth is a fool\" (said of a person named \"Elizabeth\" who has done something that we regard as foolish). In Korzybski's system, one's assessment of Elizabeth belongs to a higher order of abstraction than Elizabeth herself. Korzybski's remedy was to \"deny\" identity; in this example, to be aware continually that \"Elizabeth\" is \"not\" what we \"call\" her. We find Elizabeth not in the verbal domain, the world of words, but the nonverbal domain (the two, he said, amount to different orders of abstraction). This was expressed by Korzybski's most famous premise, \"the map is not the territory\". Note that this premise uses the phrase \"is not\", a form of \"to be\"; this and many other examples show that he did not intend to abandon \"to be\" as such. In fact, he said explicitly that there were no structural problems with the verb \"to be\" when used as an auxiliary verb or when used to state existence or location. It was even acceptable at times to use the faulty forms of the verb \"to be,\" as long as one was aware of their structural limitations.\n\nOne day, Korzybski was giving a lecture to a group of students, and he interrupted the lesson suddenly in order to retrieve a packet of biscuits, wrapped in white paper, from his briefcase. He muttered that he just had to eat something, and he asked the students on the seats in the front row if they would also like a biscuit. A few students took a biscuit. \"Nice biscuit, don't you think,\" said Korzybski, while he took a second one. The students were chewing vigorously. Then he tore the white paper from the biscuits, in order to reveal the original packaging. On it was a big picture of a dog's head and the words \"Dog Cookies.\" The students looked at the package, and were shocked. Two of them wanted to vomit, put their hands in front of their mouths, and ran out of the lecture hall to the toilet. \"You see,\" Korzybski remarked, \"I have just demonstrated that people don't just eat food, but also words, and that the taste of the former is often outdone by the taste of the latter.\"\n\nWilliam Burroughs went to a Korzybski workshop in the Autumn of 1939. He was 25 years old, and paid $40. His fellow students—there were 38 in all—included young Samuel I. Hayakawa (later to become a Republican member of the U.S. Senate), Ralph Moriarty deBit (later to become the spiritual teacher Vitvan) and Wendell Johnson (founder of the Monster Study).\n\nKorzybski was well received in numerous disciplines, as evidenced by the positive reactions from leading figures in the sciences and humanities in the 1940s and 1950s.\n\nAs reported in the third edition of \"Science and Sanity\", in World War II the US Army used Korzybski's system to treat battle fatigue in Europe, under the supervision of Dr. Douglas M. Kelley, who went on to become the psychiatrist in charge of the Nazi war criminals at Nuremberg.\n\nSome of the General Semantics tradition was continued by Samuel I. Hayakawa.\n\n\n"}

The book engages with the work of many scholars who have written on the subject, including Carol Adams, Alasdair Cochrane, Gary Francione, Melanie Joy, Martha Nussbaum, and Peter Singer, as well as with the views of non-specialists, including slaughterhouse workers involved with the film \"Slaughterhouse: The Task of Blood\", released by Century Films in 2005.\n\nThe key question dealt with in the book is whether the consumption of products derived from the bodies of animals should be banned. The position that Deckers adopts is unusual in that he argues that this question must be resolved by addressing the question of what is optimal for human health, where Deckers argues for an unconditional duty to maximise positive global health impacts, which is tantamount to a duty to minimise negative global health impacts. Applied to the consumption of animal products, this duty transpires into the duty to commit to qualified moral veganism: vegan diets ought to be the default diets for the majority of the human population.\n\nIn the first chapter, Deckers abstracts from some of the deeper questions associated with this topic by focusing on the narrow global health impacts, ignoring the question how nonhuman organisms ought or ought not to be treated when human beings make decisions about what to eat. The chapter reveals that, in many situations, omnivorous and vegetarian diets produce more narrowly defined negative global health impacts than vegan diets. The survey is limited mainly to how different diets impact on zoonoses, as well as to how they impact on land, water, fossil fuels, and atmospheric resources. It is also argued that omnivorous and vegetarian diets result in significant negative health impacts upon the lives of those who work in the farm animal sector, for example on those who work in slaughterhouses.\n\nIn chapter two, Deckers argues that human moral agents must move beyond these narrow considerations as our duty to strive for holistic human health cannot be fulfilled unless the interests of nonhuman organisms are also considered. In contrast to mainstream theories in animal ethics, which have argued mainly for duties to avoid inflicting pain, suffering, and death upon other animals and who denounce speciesism, Deckers argues that a good moral theory embraces speciesism and should consider the consumption of animal products in light of an extension of speciesism, which he refers to as ‘animalism’, a commitment to give preferential treatment to all individuals in the animal kingdom.\n\nOn this basis, Deckers argues that, in many situations, plants can be justifiably consumed, whereas animal products, even if they were derived from animals who had not been killed but who had died naturally or accidentally, ought not to be eaten.\n\nThis prima facie taboo on the consumption of animal products is also brought to bear on the issue presented by those who entertain the idea of genetically engineering animals in the hope that doing so might reduce their capacities to feel pain or to suffer. Another interest that Deckers considers to be relevant in relation to this issue is the human interest in safeguarding the integrity of nature. Drawing on the worldview of Alfred North Whitehead, Deckers argues that the genetic engineering of animals presents a greater threat to this interest compared to conventional methods of breeding animals, which are, incidentally, not free from the concern that they fail to safeguard the integrity of nature either.\n\nThe human interests in adopting a taboo on the consumption of animal products and in safeguarding the integrity of nature are also brought to bear on the issue presented by another technology that is currently being developed to reduce some of the concerns sketched in the book: the production of lab-grown, cultured, synthetic, or in-vitro flesh.\n\nDeckers argues that we should adopt a prima facie duty to allow cells to be where they are, rather than to extract them from animals and to manipulate them to do things outside their natural contexts inside Petri dishes. However, he argues also that this duty might be overridden by the greater duty to curtail the human consumption of conventional animal products. In addition, Deckers argues that, if the assumptions that domesticated cats cannot maintain good health on vegan diets and that they must consume some flesh are correct, the development of in-vitro flesh in order to feed them would be appropriate.\n\nChapter two culminates in the development of a theory which Deckers calls qualified moral veganism. His commitment to veganism is qualified as Deckers's theory does not demand that people abstain from eating animal products in all situations. It is a moral rather than a dietary position that can be adopted by everyone, even by those who have very good reasons not to adopt vegan diets. It is a vegan theory in the sense that vegan diets ought to be the default diets for the majority of the human population.\n\nChapter three sets out the political project that is associated with this theory, the vegan project, which strives to bring about legal and political reform in all jurisdictions across the globe to introduce qualified bans on the consumption of animal products. The vegan project does not stand or fall if governments either fail to relate to some of the interests that Deckers brings to bear on the issue or do not ascribe the same weight to them. Rather, Deckers argues that something like the vegan project can also be justified merely by appealing to the much narrower range of human health concerns that are discussed in chapter one.\n\nChapter three also refutes three objections that have been raised against the vegan project. The first is that it would be pointless in view of the fact that many people are not prepared to embrace it; the second that it should be rejected as it would jeopardise human food security unjustifiably; and the third that the vegan project alienates human beings from the natural world.\n\nIn chapter four Deckers explores what other people think about qualified moral veganism by evaluating a number of discussions that others have had on the topic of the book. It engages with the views of academics and non-specialists, including slaughterhouse workers. Deckers argues that qualified moral veganism stands firm in spite of public opposition, and he also sheds some light on some of the key obstacles towards its wider acceptance, including the roles played by cultural and religious traditions.\n\nDeckers recognises that many people believe that vegan diets are nutritionally deficient, which is why the appendix of the book engages with the nutritional literature, concluding that carefully chosen vegan diets are nutritionally adequate.\n\nIntroduction\nhttps://dx.doi.org/10.5334/bay.a\n\nChapter One: The Consumption of Animal Products and the Human Right to Health Care \nhttps://dx.doi.org/10.5334/bay.b\n\nChapter Two: The Ethics of Qualified Moral Veganism \nhttps://dx.doi.org/10.5334/bay.c\n\nChapter Three: The Politics of Qualified Moral Veganism \nhttps://dx.doi.org/10.5334/bay.d\n\nChapter Four: An Evaluation of Others' Deliberations \nhttps://dx.doi.org/10.5334/bay.e\n\nConclusion \nhttps://dx.doi.org/10.5334/bay.f\n\nAppendix \nhttps://dx.doi.org/10.5334/bay.g\n\nMancilla refers to Deckers's qualified moral veganism as ‘an innovative defense of veganism’ because of its concern with maximising positive global health impacts, and its primary focus on safeguarding the health of moral agents, which would demand commitments to animalism (‘an interest in attributing greater moral significance to either dead or living animals than to other biological organisms’) and to evolutionism (‘an interest in attributing greater moral significance to those animals biologically closer to us’). She argues that Deckers's focus on holistic human health highlights a moral concern with the consumption of animals who die naturally or accidentally, an issue that has been largely overlooked by scholars in animal ethics.\nThe book has also been reviewed by Torres Aldave, Laestadius, and Paez, who question Deckers's commitment to speciesism. Deckers has also responded to these critics.\n"}

Complementary therapy can be offered alongside standard treatment, with alternative medicine offered instead of conventional, evidence-based treatments.\n\nAromatherapists, who specialize in the practice of aromatherapy, utilize blends of therapeutic essential oils that can be issued through topical application, massage, inhalation or water immersion to stimulate a desired response.\n\nThere is no good medical evidence that aromatherapy can either prevent or cure any disease. There is some evidence that it is more effective than placebo in combating postoperative nausea and vomiting, but also that it is less effective than standard anti-emetic drugs. \n\nThe use of essential oils for therapeutic, spiritual, hygienic and ritualistic purposes goes back to a number of ancient civilizations including the Chinese, Indians, Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans who used them in cosmetics, perfumes and drugs.\nOils were used for aesthetic pleasure and in the beauty industry. It was a luxury item and a means of payment. It was believed the essential oils increased the shelf life of wine and improved the taste of food.\n\nOils are described by Dioscorides, along with beliefs of the time regarding their healing properties, in his \"De Materia Medica\", written in the first century. Distilled essential oils have been employed as medicines since the eleventh century, when Avicenna isolated essential oils using steam distillation.\n\nThe concept of aromatherapy was first mooted by a small number of European scientists and doctors, in about 1907. In 1937, the word first appeared in print in a French book on the subject: \"Aromathérapie: Les Huiles Essentielles, Hormones Végétales\" by , a chemist. An English version was published in 1993. In 1910, Gattefossé burned a hand very badly and later claimed he treated it effectively with lavender oil.\n\nA French surgeon, , pioneered the medicinal uses of essential oils, which he used as antiseptics in the treatment of wounded soldiers during World War II.\n\nThe modes of application of aromatherapy include:\n\nSome of the materials employed include:\n\nAromatherapy is the treatment or prevention of disease by use of essential oils. Other stated uses include pain and anxiety reduction, enhancement of energy and short-term memory, relaxation, hair loss prevention, and reduction of eczema-induced itching.\n\nTwo basic mechanisms are offered to explain the purported effects. One is the influence of aroma on the brain, especially the limbic system through the olfactory system. The other is the direct pharmacological effects of the essential oils.\n\nIn the English-speaking world, practitioners tend to emphasize the use of oils in massage. Aromatherapy tends to be regarded as a pseudoscientific fraud at worst.\n\nOils with standardized content of components (marked FCC, for Food Chemicals Codex) are required to contain a specified amount of certain aroma chemicals that normally occur in the oil. There is no law that the chemicals cannot be added in synthetic form to meet the criteria established by the FCC for that oil. For instance, lemongrass essential oil must contain 75% aldehyde to meet the FCC profile for that oil, but that aldehyde can come from a chemical refinery instead of from lemongrass. To say that FCC oils are \"food grade\" makes them seem natural when they are not necessarily so.\n\nUndiluted essential oils suitable for aromatherapy are termed 'therapeutic grade', but there are no established and agreed standards for this category.\n\nAnalysis using gas liquid chromatography (GLC) and mass spectrometry (MS) establishes the quality of essential oils. These techniques are able to measure the levels of components to a few parts per billion. This does not make it possible to determine whether each component is natural or whether a poor oil has been 'improved' by the addition of synthetic aromachemicals, but the latter is often signaled by the minor impurities present. For example, linalool made in plants will be accompanied by a small amount of hydro-linalool, whilst synthetic linalool has traces of dihydro-linalool.\n\nThere is no good medical evidence that aromatherapy can prevent or cure any disease. In 2015, the Australian Government's Department of Health published the results of a review of alternative therapies that sought to determine if any were suitable for being covered by health insurance; aromatherapy was one of 17 therapies evaluated for which no clear evidence of effectiveness was found. Evidence for the efficacy of aromatherapy in treating medical conditions is poor, with a particular lack of studies employing rigorous methodology. A number of systematic reviews have studied the clinical effectiveness of aromatherapy in respect to pain management in labor, the treatment of post-operative nausea and vomiting, managing behaviors that challenge in dementia, and symptom relief in cancer. All of these reviews report a lack of evidence on the effectiveness of aromatherapy. Studies were found to be of low quality, meaning more well-designed, large scale randomized controlled trials are needed before clear conclusions can be drawn as to the effectiveness of aromatherapy.\n\nAromatherapy carries a risk of a number of adverse effects and this consideration, combined with the lack of evidence of its therapeutic benefit, makes the practice of questionable worth.\n\nBecause essential oils are highly concentrated they can irritate the skin when used in undiluted form. Therefore, they are normally diluted with a carrier oil for topical application, such as jojoba oil, olive oil, or coconut oil. Phototoxic reactions may occur with citrus peel oils such as lemon or lime. Also, many essential oils have chemical components that are sensitisers (meaning that they will, after a number of uses, cause reactions on the skin, and more so in the rest of the body). Some of the chemical allergies could even be caused by pesticides, if the original plants are cultivated. Some oils can be toxic to some domestic animals, with cats being particularly prone.\n\nA child hormone specialist at the University of Cambridge claimed \"... these oils can mimic estrogens\" and \"people should be a little bit careful about using these products.\" The Aromatherapy Trade Council of the UK has issued a rebuttal.\nThe Australian Tea Tree Association, a group that promotes the interests of Australian tea tree oil producers, exporters and manufacturers issued a letter that questioned the study and called on the \"New England Journal of Medicine\" for a retraction.\nThe \"New England Journal of Medicine\" has so far not replied and has not retracted the study.\n\nAs with any bioactive substance, an essential oil that may be safe for the general public could still pose hazards for pregnant and lactating women.\n\nWhile some advocate the ingestion of essential oils for therapeutic purposes, licensed aromatherapy professionals do not recommend self-prescription due to the highly toxic nature of some essential oils. Some very common oils like eucalyptus are extremely toxic when taken internally. Doses as low as one teaspoon have been reported to cause clinically significant symptoms and severe poisoning can occur after ingestion of 4 to 5 ml.\nA few reported cases of toxic reactions like liver damage and seizures have occurred after ingestion of sage, hyssop, thuja, and cedar. Accidental ingestion may happen when oils are not kept out of reach of children.\n\nOils both ingested and applied to the skin can potentially have negative interactions with conventional medicine. For example, the topical use of methyl salicylate-heavy oils like sweet birch and wintergreen may cause bleeding in users taking the anticoagulant warfarin.\n\nAdulterated oils may also pose problems depending on the type of substance used.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1398957", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1398957", "title": "Atomism (social)", "text": "Atomism (social)\n\nAtomism or social atomism is a sociological theory arising from the scientific notion \"atomic theory\", coined by the ancient Greek philosopher Democritus and the Roman philosopher Lucretius. In the scientific rendering of the word, atomism refers to the notion that all matter in the universe is composed of basic indivisible components, or atoms. When placed into the field of sociology, atomism assigns the individual as the basic unit of analysis for all implications of social life. This theory refers to \"the tendency for society to be made up of a collection of self-interested and largely self-sufficient individuals, operating as separate atoms\". Therefore, all social values, institutions, developments and procedures evolve entirely out of the interests and actions of the individuals who inhabit any particular society. The individual is the ‘atom’ of society and therefore the only true object of concern and analysis. \nPolitical theorists such as John Locke and Thomas Hobbes extend social atomism to the political realm. They assert that human beings are fundamentally self-interested, equal and rational \"social atoms\" that together form an aggregate society of self-interested individuals. Those participating in society must sacrifice a portion of their individual rights in order to form a \"social contract\" with the other persons in society. Ultimately, although some rights are renounced, self-interested cooperation occurs for the mutual preservation of the individuals and for society at large. \nThose who criticize the theory of social atomism believe that it neglects the idea of the individual as unique. Sociologist Elizabeth Wolgast asserts that,\n“From the atomistic standpoint, the individuals who make up a society are interchangeable like molecules in a bucket of water--society a mere aggregate of individuals. This introduces a harsh and brutal equality into our theory of human life and it contradicts our experience of human beings as unique and irreplaceable, valuable in virtue of their variety--in what they don't share--not in virtue of their common ability to reason.” \nThose who question social atomism argue that it is unjust to treat all persons equally when individual necessities and circumstances are clearly dissimilar.\n\n"}

One of the key positions of the book included the criticism of Immanuel Kant, arguing that the philosopher failed to realize that knowledge, as mirrored by the human mind is the product of evolutionary adaptations. \n\nKant has maintained that our consciousness or our description and judgments about the world could never mirror the world as it really is so we can not simply take in the raw data that the world provides nor impose our forms on the world. Lorenz disputed this, saying it is inconceivable that - through chance mutations and selective retention - the world fashioned an instrument of cognition that grossly misleads man about such world. He said that we can determine the reliability of the mirror by looking behind it. \n\nLorenz summarizes his life's work into his own philosophy: Evolution is the process of growing perception of the outer world by living nature itself. Stepping from simple to higher organized organisms, Lorenz shows how they gain and benefit from information. The methods mirrored by organs have been created in the course of evolution as the natural history of this organism.\n\nIn the book, Lorenz uses the mirror as a simple model of the human brain that reflects the part of the stream of information from the outside world it is able to \"see\". He argued that merely looking outward into the mirror ignores the fact that the mirror has a non-reflecting side, which is also a part and parcel of reality. The backside of the mirror was created by evolution to gather as much information as needed to better survive. The picture in the mirror is what we see within our mind. Within our cultural evolution we have extended this picture in the mirror by inventing instruments that transform the most needed of the invisible to something visible.\n\nThe back side of the mirror is acting for itself as it processes the incoming information to improve speed and effectiveness. By that human inventions like logical conclusions are always in danger to be manipulated by these hardwired prejudices in our brain. The book gives a hypothesis how consciousness was invented by evolution.\n\n\n\n\n"}

This is a problem because reasoning often involves facts that are true in the majority of cases but not always. A classical example is: “birds typically fly”. This rule can be expressed in standard logic either by “all birds fly”, which is inconsistent with the fact that penguins do not fly, or by “all birds that are not penguins and not ostriches and ... fly”, which requires all exceptions to the rule to be specified.

The doctrine is intended to protect consumers within the United States from confusion or deception caused by the use of terms in different languages. In some cases, a party will use a word as a mark which is either generic or merely descriptive of the goods in a foreign language, or which shares the same meaning as an existing mark to speakers of that foreign language.\n\nThe Trademark Manual of Examining Procedure (\"TMEP\") states the test for applying the doctrine of foreign equivalents is \"whether, to those American buyers familiar with the foreign language, the word would denote its English equivalent\". With respect to descriptive or generic marks, the TMEP specifies that in determining whether a foreign term is entitled to registration, \"[t]he test is whether, to those American buyers familiar with the foreign language, the word would have a descriptive or generic connotation\". However, \"foreign words from dead or obscure languages may be so unfamiliar to the American buying public that they should not be translated into English for descriptiveness purposes.\" This test is also applied by courts to determine \"whether that foreign word would be descriptive of the product to that segment of the purchasing public which is familiar with that language.\"\n\nIt is unclear whether the test differs for asserted cases of likelihood of confusion. The Federal Circuit has recently clarified the applicability of the doctrine of foreign equivalents in likelihood of confusion cases, stating that \"When it is unlikely that an American buyer will translate the foreign mark and will take it as it is, then the doctrine of foreign equivalents will not be applied\". The court noted that \"the doctrine of foreign equivalents is not an absolute rule and should be viewed merely as a guideline\". Instead \"[t]he doctrine should be applied only when it is likely that the ordinary American purchaser would \"stop and translate [the word] into its English equivalent\". The Federal Circuit specifically found that \"it is improbable that the average American purchaser would stop and translate 'VEUVE' into 'widow'\".\n\nThe \"Palm Bay Imports\" case suggests that it is the same test stating \"[u]nder the doctrine of foreign equivalents, foreign words from common languages are translated into English to determine genericness, descriptiveness, as well as similarity of connotation in order to ascertain confusing similarity with English word marks.\"\n\nAs noted above, in Palm Bay, the Federal Circuit held that the doctrine of foreign equivalents only applies when the \"ordinary American purchaser\" is likely to translate the foreign mark\ninto English. A short time after \"Palm Bay\" was decided, the T.T.A.B. interpreted \"ordinary American purchaser\" in \"In re Thomas\" and held that the ordinary American purchaser includes only purchasers \"familiar with the foreign language.\" This narrow definition of \"ordinary American purchaser\" effectively guaranteed that the doctrine would be applied in nearly every case involving a foreign word since \"those proficient in a non-English language . . . would ordinarily be expected to translate words into English.\"\n\nAt its next opportunity, however, the Federal Circuit abrogated \"Thomas\" in part. In In re Spirits International, a geographic deceptiveness case, the Federal Circuit held that the ordinary American purchaser \"\"includes all American purchasers\", including those proficient in a non-English language.\"\n\nHowever, because the \"Spirits\" court limited its ruling to the doctrine's application with respect to the geographic deceptiveness bar, the Board currently applies the \"Spirits\" definition of ordinary American purchaser in cases of geographic deceptiveness refusals and the \"Thomas\" definition to all other bars.\n\nCases have noted that the status accorded to words in foreign countries has no bearing on the registration of marks in the U.S. For example, in \"Anheuser-Busch, Inc. v. Stroh Brewery Co.\", the court rejected as irrelevant the generic usage of the phrase \"L.A. beer\" in Australia for low alcohol beer. In \"Seiko Sporting Goods USA, Inc. v. Kabushiki Kaisha Hattori Tokeiten\", the court stated that \"[w]hile plaintiff has sought to show that Seiko is a generic term in Japanese, it is not so recognized in this country. Accordingly, the mark must still be regarded as arbitrary and fanciful in the United States.\"\n\nFurthermore, \"[a] number of cases hold that a term may be generic in one country and suggestive in another\". In \"Carcione v. The Greengrocer, Inc.\", a court rejected as irrelevant the generic use of the term \"Greengrocer\" in Britain for a retailer of fruit. The defendant argued that the trademark \"Greengrocer\", which is a generic term in Britain for a retailer of fruits and vegetables, was not entitled to protection as a trademark in the United States. The court rejected this argument on the ground that it is irrelevant how a term is used outside the United States: \"The parties agree that the term is generic in Britain. Since we deal here with American trademark law, and thus American consumers, neither British usage nor the dictionary definition indicating such usage are determinative.\"\n\nTMEP § 1209.03(g) expresses the caveat that \"foreign words from dead or obscure languages may be so unfamiliar to the American buying public that they should not be translated into English for descriptiveness purposes.\" Emphasis added. \"Descriptiveness is evaluated according to 'that segment of the purchasing public which is familiar with that language.'\" General Cigar Co. v. G.D.M. Inc., 988 F. Supp. 647, 660 (S.D.N.Y. 1997) (quoting 1 McCarthy § 11.14, p. 464-65). In that case, the court found that the strength of the Cohiba mark was not diminished by the fact that Cohiba is the Taino Indian word for tobacco, because the Taino language was an obscure language. The court noted:\n\nNevertheless, cases exist where trademark registration has been rejected for a word that was generic or descriptive when translated from a language such as Latin or Ancient Greek.\n\nWhere a word is a foreign transliteration of an English mark, the TTAB has held that there is nothing to translate, and the doctrine of foreign equivalents is not invoked. In \"Green Spot (Thailand) Ltd. v. Vitasoy Int'l Holdings Ltd.\", the TTAB considered the application of the doctrine where Green Spot sought to register \"Vitamilk\", and was opposed by Vitasoy, which was the owner of a senior registration. Green Spot also owned a mark in Chinese characters for which the first sets of characters were transliterations of \"vi\" and \"ta\" with no meaning in Chinese, while the third, 奶 (nai) was the Chinese word for \"milk\". Green Spot argued that its senior Chinese character mark was the equivalent of Vitamilk, and that Green Spot's ownership of the senior mark gave it the right to own the equivalent English mark. The TTAB refused to apply the doctrine of foreign equivalents, because the transliterations of \"vi\" and \"ta\" had no actual translation from Chinese to English.\n\nThe doctrine has been criticized in recent years. Commentators have noted that courts have \"reached irreconcilable holdings\" in applying the doctrine. It has also been suggested that the doctrine be abolished.\n"}

It exerts influence on a large range of disciplines including environmental law, environmental sociology, ecotheology, ecological economics, ecology and environmental geography.\n\nThere are many ethical decisions that human beings make with respect to the environment. For example:\n\n\nThe academic field of environmental ethics grew up in response to the work of scientists such as Rachel Carson and events such as the first Earth Day in 1970, when environmentalists started urging philosophers to consider the philosophical aspects of environmental problems. Two papers published in \"Science\" had a crucial impact: Lynn White's \"The Historical Roots of our Ecologic Crisis\" (March 1967) and Garrett Hardin's \"The Tragedy of the Commons\" (December 1968). Also influential was Garett Hardin's later essay called \"Exploring New Ethics for Survival\", as well as an essay by Aldo Leopold in his \"A Sand County Almanac\", called \"The Land Ethic,\" in which Leopold explicitly claimed that the roots of the ecological crisis were philosophical (1949).\n\nThe first international academic journals in this field emerged from North America in the late 1970s and early 1980s – the US-based journal \"Environmental Ethics\" in 1979 and the Canadian-based journal \"\" in 1983. The first British based journal of this kind, \"Environmental Values\", was launched in 1992.\n\nSome scholars have tried to categorise the various ways the natural environment is valued. Alan Marshall and Michael Smith are two examples of this, as cited by Peter Vardy in \"The Puzzle of Ethics\". According to Marshall, three general ethical approaches have emerged over the last 40 years: Libertarian Extension, the Ecologic Extension and Conservation Ethics.\n\nMarshall’s Libertarian extension echoes a civil liberty approach (i.e. a commitment to extend equal rights to all members of a community). In environmentalism, though, the community is generally thought to consist of non-humans as well as humans.\n\nAndrew Brennan was an advocate of ecologic humanism (eco-humanism), the argument that all ontological entities, animate and in-animate, can be given ethical worth purely on the basis that they exist. The work of Arne Næss and his collaborator Sessions also falls under the libertarian extension, although they preferred the term \"deep ecology\". Deep ecology is the argument for the intrinsic value or inherent worth of the environment – the view that it is valuable in itself. Their argument, incidentally, falls under both the libertarian extension and the ecologic extension.\n\nPeter Singer's work can be categorized under Marshall's 'libertarian extension'. He reasoned that the \"expanding circle of moral worth\" should be redrawn to include the rights of non-human animals, and to not do so would be guilty of speciesism. Singer found it difficult to accept the argument from intrinsic worth of a-biotic or \"non-sentient\" (non-conscious) entities, and concluded in his first edition of \"Practical Ethics\" that they should not be included in the expanding circle of moral worth. This approach is essentially then, bio-centric. However, in a later edition of \"Practical Ethics\" after the work of Næss and Sessions, Singer admits that, although unconvinced by deep ecology, the argument from intrinsic value of non-sentient entities is plausible, but at best problematic. Singer advocated a humanist ethics.\n\nAlan Marshall's category of ecologic extension places emphasis not on\nhuman rights but on the recognition of the fundamental interdependence \nof all biological (and some abiological) entities and their essential \ndiversity. Whereas Libertarian Extension can be thought of as flowing \nfrom a political reflection of the natural world, ecologic extension is \nbest thought of as a scientific reflection of the natural world. \nEcological Extension is roughly the same classification of Smith's \neco-holism, and it argues for the intrinsic value inherent in collective\necological entities like ecosystems or the global environment as a \nwhole entity. Holmes Rolston, among others, has taken this approach.\n\nThis category might include James Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis; the theory that the planet earth alters its geo-physiological structure over time in order to ensure the continuation of an equilibrium of evolving organic and inorganic matter. The planet is characterized as a unified, holistic entity with ethical worth of which the human race is of no particular significance in the long run.\n\nMarshall's category of 'conservation ethics' is an extension of use-value into the non-human biological world. It focuses only on the worth of the environment in terms of its utility or usefulness to humans. It contrasts the intrinsic value ideas of 'deep ecology', hence is often referred to as 'shallow ecology', and generally argues for the preservation of the environment on the basis that it has extrinsic value – instrumental to the welfare of human beings. Conservation is therefore a means to an end and purely concerned with mankind and inter-generational considerations. It could be argued that it is this ethic that formed the underlying arguments proposed by Governments at the Kyoto summit in 1997 and three agreements reached in Rio in 1992.\n\nPeter Singer advocated the preservation of \"world heritage sites,\" unspoilt parts of the world that acquire a \"scarcity value\" as they diminish over time. Their preservation is a bequest for future generations as they have been inherited from human's ancestors and should be passed down to future generations so they can have the opportunity to decide whether to enjoy unspoilt countryside or an entirely urban landscape. A good example of a world heritage site would be the tropical rainforest, a very specialist ecosystem that has taken centuries to evolve. Clearing the rainforest for farmland often fails due to soil conditions, and once disturbed, can take thousands of years to regenerate.\n\nThe Christian world view sees the universe as created by God, and humankind accountable to God for the use of the resources entrusted to humankind. Ultimate values are seen in the light of being valuable to God. This applies both in breadth of scope - caring for people (Matthew 25) and environmental issues, e.g. environmental health (Deuteronomy 22.8; 23.12-14) - and dynamic motivation, the love of Christ controlling (2 Corinthians 5.14f) and dealing with the underlying spiritual disease of sin, which shows itself in selfishness and thoughtlessness. In many countries this relationship of accountability is symbolised at harvest thanksgiving. (B.T. Adeney : Global Ethics in New Dictionary of Christian Ethics and Pastoral Theology 1995 Leicester)\n\nAbrahamic religious scholars have used theology to motivate the public. John L. O'Sullivan, who coined the term Manifest destiny, and other influential people like him used Abrahamic ideologies to encourage action. These religious scholars, columnists and politicians historically have used these ideas and continue to do so to justify the consumptive tendencies of a young America around the time of the Industrial Revolution. In order to solidify the understanding that God had intended for humankind to use earths natural resources, environmental writers and religious scholars alike proclaimed that humans are separate from nature, on a higher order. Those that may critique this point of view may ask the same question that John Muir asks ironically in a section of his novel \"A Thousand Mile Walk to the Gulf\", \"why are there so many dangers in the natural world in the form of poisonous plants, animals and natural disasters\", The answer is that those creatures are a result of Adam and Eve's sins in the garden of Eden.\n\nSince the turn of the 20th century, the application of theology in environmentalism diverged into two schools of thought. The first system of understanding holds religion as the basis of environmental stewardship. The second sees the use of theology as a means to rationalize the unmanaged consumptions of natural resources. Lynn White and Calvin DeWitt represent each side of this dichotomy.\n\nJohn Muir personified nature as an inviting place away from the loudness of urban centers. \"For Muir and the growing number of Americans who shared his views, Satan's home had become God's Own Temple.\" The use of Abrahamic religious allusions assisted Muir and the Sierra Club to create support for some of the first public nature preserves.\n\nAuthors like Terry Tempest Williams as well as John Muir build on the idea that \"...God can be found wherever you are, especially outside. Family worship was not just relegated to Sunday in a chapel.\" References like these assist the general public to make a connection between paintings done at the Hudson River School, Ansel Adams' photographs, along with other types of media, and their religion or spirituality. Placing intrinsic value upon nature through theology is a fundamental idea of Deep ecology.\n\nAnthropocentrism is the position that humans are the most important or critical element in any given situation; that the human race must always be its own primary concern. Detractors of anthropocentrism argue that the Western tradition biases homo sapiens when considering the environmental ethics of a situation and that humans evaluate their environment or other organisms in terms of the utility for them (see speciesism). Many argue that all environmental studies should include an assessment of the intrinsic value of non-human beings. In fact, based on this very assumption, a philosophical article has explored recently the possibility of humans' willing extinction as a gesture toward other beings. The authors refer to the idea as a thought experiment that should not be understood as a call for action.\n\nBaruch Spinoza reasoned that if humans were to look at things objectively, they would discover that everything in the universe has a unique value. Likewise, it is possible that a human-centred or anthropocentric/androcentric ethic is not an accurate depiction of reality, and there is a bigger picture that humans may or may not be able to understand from a human perspective.\n\nPeter Vardy distinguished between two types of anthropocentrism. A strong anthropocentric ethic argues that humans are at the center of reality and it is right for them to be so. Weak anthropocentrism, however, argues that reality can only be interpreted from a human point of view, thus humans have to be at the centre of reality as they see it.\n\nAnother point of view has been developed by Bryan Norton, who has become one of the essential actors of environmental ethics by launching environmental pragmatism, now one of its leading trends. Environmental pragmatism refuses to take a stance in disputes between defenders of anthropocentrist and non-anthropocentrist ethics. Instead, Norton distinguishes between \"strong anthropocentrism\" and \"weak-or-extended-anthropocentrism\" and argues that the former must underestimate the diversity of instrumental values humans may derive from the natural world.\n\nA recent view relates anthropocentrism to the future of life. Biotic ethics are based on the human identity as part of gene/protein organic life whose effective purpose is self-propagation. This implies a human purpose to secure and propagate life. Humans are central because only they can secure life beyond the duration of the Sun, possibly for trillions of eons. Biotic ethics values life itself, as embodied in biological structures and processes. Humans are special because they can secure the future of life on cosmological scales. In particular, humans can continue sentient life that enjoys its existence, adding further motivation to propagate life. Humans can secure the future of life, and this future can give human existence a cosmic purpose.\n\nOnly after 1990 did the field gain institutional recognition at programs such as Colorado State University, the University of Montana, Bowling Green State University, and the University of North Texas. In 1991, Schumacher College of Dartington, England, was founded and now provides an MSc in Holistic Science.\n\nThese programs began to offer a master's degree with a specialty in environmental ethics/philosophy. Beginning in 2005 the Department of Philosophy and Religion Studies at the University of North Texas offered a PhD program with a concentration in environmental ethics/philosophy.\n\nIn Germany, the University of Greifswald has recently established an international program in Landscape Ecology & Nature Conservation with a strong focus on environmental ethics. In 2009, the University of Munich and Deutsches Museum founded the Rachel Carson Center for Environment and Society, an international, interdisciplinary center for research and education in the environmental humanities.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "318898", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=318898", "title": "Eugène Dubois", "text": "Eugène Dubois\n\nMarie Eugène François Thomas Dubois (; 28 January 1858 – 16 December 1940) was a Dutch paleoanthropologist and geologist. He earned worldwide fame for his discovery of \"Pithecanthropus erectus\" (later redesignated \"Homo erectus\"), or \"Java Man\". Although hominid fossils had been found and studied before, Dubois was the first anthropologist to embark upon a purposeful search for them.\n\nDubois was born and raised in the village of Eijsden, Limburg, where his father, Jean Dubois, was an apothecary, later the mayor. Interested in all phenomena of the world of nature, Eugène explored the \"caves\" (\"grotten\", actually underground limestone mines) of Mount Saint Peter and amassed collections of plant parts, stones, insects, shells, and animal skulls. From age 12-13 on, he attended school in the Limburg city of Roermond, boarding with a family there and then he dropped out. In Roermond he attended lectures on Charles Darwin's new theory of evolution given by the German biologist, Karl Vogt.\n\nResisting his father's plan for him to train to follow in his footsteps, Dubois, encouraged by his teachers, decided in 1877 to study medicine at the University of Amsterdam. While a student, he taught anatomy at both of the brand new (founded 1880) art schools housed at the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam (Amsterdam State Museum) the Rijksschool voor Kunstnijverheid (State School for Applied Arts) and the Rijksnormaalschool voor Teekenonderwijzers (State Normal School for Drawing Instructors). In 1884 he completed his medical degree. He declined an offer from the University of Utrecht of a position as a docent. Instead, at the invitation of his anatomy instructor, Max Fürbringer, he decided to train as an academic. From 1881 to 1887 he studied comparative anatomy and became Fürbringer's assistant. In 1885 he investigated the larynx of vertebrates, which led him to develop a hypothesis of the evolution of this organ. Nevertheless, his chief interest was in human evolution, influenced by Ernst Haeckel, who reasoned that there must be intermediate species between ape and human.\n\nDubois contributed an article on whale anatomy to a book by the Dutch zoologist, Max Weber, and, inspired by the fresh discovery of new Neanderthal fossils at the Belgian town of Spy, he spent his vacation fossil hunting in the vicinity of his birthplace. In the Henkeput near the village of Rijckholt, where a prehistoric flint mine had just been discovered in 1881, he found some prehistoric human skulls.\n\nReasoning that the origins of the human species must be in the tropics, in 1887 he joined the Dutch army and arranged to be posted in the Dutch East Indies (the Dutch colony that is now independent Indonesia), to the dismay of his academic colleagues. With his wife and newborn daughter he moved to the colony to search for the missing link in human evolution. (He was unalterably convinced there was only one missing link.)\n\nBetween 1887 and 1895, Dubois searched at potential sites near rivers and in caves, first on the island of Sumatra, then on the Indonesian island of Java.\n\nIn 1891, Dubois discovered remains of what he described as \"a species in between humans and apes\". He called his finds \"Pithecanthropus erectus\" (\"ape-human that stands upright\") or Java Man. Today, they are classified as \"Homo erectus\" (\"human that stands upright\"). These were the first specimens of early hominid remains to be found outside of Africa or Europe. During this period Dubois carried out fieldwork at sites such as Sangiran in Central Java and Trinil in East Java.\n\nIn 1897, the University of Amsterdam awarded Dubois an honorary doctorate in botany and zoology, but he had to wait until 1899 for a professorship. In that year, he was appointed a professor in geology, a function that did not keep him from his research in anatomy. He was also (from 1897 until 1928) keeper of paleontology, geology and mineralogy at Teylers Museum, where he also kept the \"H. erectus\" remains.\n\nIn 1919 he became member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.\n\nAlthough the scientific debate slowly began to turn in his favour in the 1920s and 1930s, he died embittered in 1940. He was buried in unconsecrated ground on the 16th of December 1940 in Venlo, \"Algemene Begraafplaats\", grave number NH2\\26\\-\\BR. The reason was that his finding of the missing link in favor of the evolution theory was not welcomed by the catholic church.\nHis paleontological collection and scientific archive remain at Naturalis in Leiden. A special section of Museum Het Ursulinenconvent - International Museum for Family History is devoted to Dubois' life and work.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1478035", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1478035", "title": "Flagship species", "text": "Flagship species\n\nIn conservation biology, a flagship species is a species chosen to raise support for biodiversity conservation in a given place or social context. Definitions have varied, but they have tended to focus on the strategic goals and the socio-economic nature of the concept, to support the marketing of a conservation effort. The species need to be popular, to work as symbols or icons, and to stimulate people to provide money or support.\n\nSpecies selected since the idea was developed in 1980s include widely recognised and charismatic species like the black rhinoceros, the Bengal tiger, and the Asian elephant. More locally significant species like the Chesapeake blue crab and the Pemba flying fox have suited a cultural and social context.\n\nUtilizing a flagship species has limitations. It can skew management and conservation priorities, which may conflict. Stakeholders may be negatively affected if the flagship species is lost. The use of a flagship may have limited effect, and the approach may not protect the species from extinction: all of the top ten charismatic groups of animal including tigers, lions, elephants and giraffes are endangered.\n\nThe term flagship is linked to the metaphor of representation. In its popular usage, flagships are viewed as ambassadors or icons for a conservation project or movement. The geographer Maan Barua noted that metaphors influence what people understand and how they act; that mammals are disproportionately chosen; and that biologists need to come to grips with language to improve the public's knowledge of conservation. Several definitions have been advanced for the flagship species concept and for some time there has been confusion even in the academic literature. Most of the latest definitions focus on the strategic, socio-economic, and marketing character of the concept.\n\n\nThe flagship species concept appears to have become popular around the mid 1980s within the debate on how to prioritise species for conservation. The first widely available references to use the flagship concept applied it to both neotropical primates and African elephants and rhinos, in the mammal-centric approach that still dominates how the concept is used. The use of flagship species has been dominated by large bodied animals, especially mammals, although members of other taxonomic groups have occasionally been used.\n\nFlagship species projects have sometimes been successful in saving the species and its habitat, as with the American bald eagle and the manatee.\n\nChosen flagship species include the Bengal tiger (\"Panthera tigris\"), the giant panda (\"Ailuropoda melanoleuca\"), the Golden lion tamarin (\"Leontopithecus rosalia\"), the African elephant (\"Loxodonta sp.\") and Asian elephant (\"Elephas maximus\"). However, because flagship species are selected according to the audience they are hoping to influence, these species can also belong to traditionally uncharismatic groups, if the cultural and social content is right. Less charismatic but locally significant species include the use of the Pemba flying fox as a flagship in Tanzania, and of the Chesapeake blue crab as a flagship in the USA.\n\nSome flagship species are keystone species, like the African lion, a top predator: it used to control the populations of large herbivores, protecting ecosystems across the entire landscape. However, the lion's ability to serve as a keystone species is decreasing as its population and range decline. The WWF uses flagship species as one of its species classification categories, along with keystone and indicator species. It chooses between these when selecting a priority species to represent the conservation threats facing a certain region.\n\nFlagship species can represent an environmental feature (e.g. a species or ecosystem), cause (e.g. climate change or ocean acidification), organization (e.g. NGO or government department) or geographic region (e.g. state or protected area).\n\nFlagship species can be selected according to many different methodologies, such as social marketing, environmental economics, and conservation biology, depending on what is valued by the audience they try to target, and the goals of the project, such as conservation awareness, fundraising, ecotourism promotion, community-based conservation, and promotion of funded research. This is illustrated by the differences in recommendations made for flagship species selection targeting different target audiences such as local communities and tourists.\n\nThe use of flagship species has some limitations:\n\nLeaving aside the impact on other species, charisma does not seem to protect even charismatic species against extinction. All ten of the most charismatic groups of animal identified in a 2018 study, namely tiger, lion, elephant, giraffe, leopard, panda, cheetah, polar bear, wolf, and gorilla, are currently endangered; only the giant panda shows a demographic growth from an extremely small population. The researchers suggest that the widespread use of images of these animals has given the public the impression that the animals are abundant, obscuring their high risk of imminent extinction. They note that this remains true despite the intense focus of conservation efforts on these particular species. A major challenge for the utilization of several flagship species in non-Western contexts is that they may come into conflict with local communities, thereby jeopardizing well-intended conservation actions. This has been termed 'flagship mutiny', and is exemplified by the Asian elephant in countries where there is human-elephant conflict.\n\nConservation flagships can be used at broader levels, for example as ecosystems like coral reefs, rainforests or protected areas like the Serengeti or Yellowstone. Some recent initiatives have developed flagships based on the conservation value of particular areas or species. Examples of these are the EDGE project run by the Zoological Society of London and the Hotspots run by Conservation International.\nMore recently, work in microbiology has started to use flagship species in a distinct way. This work relates to the biogeography of micro-organisms and uses particular species because \"eyecatching \"flagships\" with conspicuous size and/or morphology are the best distribution indicators\".\n\n\n"}

In 1779 he was made secretary of the French legation to the United States. In 1780, Barbé-Marbois sent a questionnaire to the governors of all thirteen former American colonies, seeking information about each state's geography, natural resources, history, and government. Thomas Jefferson, who was then finishing his final term as Virginia's governor, responded to this query with a manuscript that later became his famous \"Notes on the State of Virginia\".\n\nBarbé-Marbois was elected a Foreign Honorary Member to both the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society in 1781. When the minister Chevalier de la Luzerne returned to France in 1783, Barbé-Marbois remained in America as chargé d'affaires in 1784. That year he married Elizabeth Moore (1765-1834), the daughter of William Moore, former governor of Pennsylvania.\n\nIn 1785 he became intendant of the colony of Saint-Domingue under the \"Ancien Régime\".\n\nAt the close of 1789, he returned to France, and then placed his services at the disposal of the French Revolutionary government. In 1791 he was sent to Regensburg to help the Marquis de Noailles, the French ambassador. Suspected of treason, he was arrested on his return but soon freed.\n\nIn 1795 he was elected to the Council of the Ancients, where the general moderation of his attitude, especially in his opposition to the exclusion of nobles and the relations of \"émigrés\" from public life, brought him under suspicion of being a royalist, though he pronounced a eulogy on Napoleon Bonaparte for his .\n\nDuring the anti-Royalist \"coup d'état\" of the 18th Fructidor (4 September) 1797), he was arrested and transported to French Guiana.

In 1801, under the Consulate, he became councillor of state and director of the \"Trésor public\" (Treasury), and in 1802 a senator.\nIn 1803 he negotiated the Louisiana Purchase treaty by which Louisiana was ceded to the United States, and was rewarded by the First Consul with a gift of 152,000 francs.\n\nLoyal to the First Empire, he was made grand officer of the Legion of Honour and a count in 1805, and in 1808 he became president of the \"Cour des Comptes\". His career as Head of the Treasury ended in 1806. In return for these favours, he heaped praise upon Napoleon; yet, in 1814, he helped to draw up the act of abdication of the emperor, and declared to the \"Cour des Comptes\", with reference to the invasion of France by the Sixth Coalition:\n\nIn June of that year, under the First Restoration, Barbé-Marbois was made Peer of France by King Louis XVIII, and confirmed in his office as president of the \"Cour des Comptes\". Deprived of his positions by Napoleon during the Hundred Days, he was appointed Minister of Justice under the Duc de Richelieu (August 1815), tried unsuccessfully to gain the confidence of the Ultra-Royalists, and withdrew at the end of nine months (10 May 1816).\n\nIn 1830, when the July Revolution brought Louis Philippe and the Orléans Monarchy, Barbé-Marbois went, as president of the \"Cour des Comptes\", to compliment the new king, and was confirmed in his position. He held his office until April 1834.\n\nIn 1829 he wrote the book \"Histoire de la Louisiane et la cession de cette colonie par la France aux Etats-Unis de l'Amérique septentrionale ; précédée d'un discours sur la constitution et le gouvernement des Etats-Unis\" (\"History of Louisiana and of Its Cession to the United States of Northern America; Preceded by a Discourse on the Constitution and Government of the United States\").\n\nHe published various texts, including:\nWritten in 1780, while secretary to the French Legation to the US Army: \"D'Complot du Benedict Arnold & Sir Henri Clinton contre Eunas` States du America General George Washington\" One of the first accounts of Arnold's treason, was not published until 1816.\n\n\n"}

Designed to run on Linux and other Unix-like computer operating systems, its name is a recursive acronym for \"Gambas Almost Means Basic\". Gambas is also the word for prawns in the Spanish, French, and Portuguese languages, from which the project's logos are derived.\n\nGambas was developed by the French programmer Benoît Minisini, with its first release coming in 1999. Benoît had grown up with the BASIC language, and decided to make a free software development environment that could quickly and easily make programs with user interfaces.\n\nThe Gambas 1.x versions featured an interface made up of several different separate windows for forms and IDE dialogues in a similar fashion to the interface of the GIMP. It could also only develop applications using Qt and was more oriented towards the development of applications for KDE. The last release of the 1.x versions was Gambas 1.0.19.\nThe first of the 2.x versions was released on January 2, 2008 after three to four years of development. It featured a major redesign of the interface, now with all forms and functions embedded in a single window, as well as some changes to the Gambas syntax, although for the most part code compatibility was kept. It featured major updates to existing Gambas components as well as the addition of some new ones, such as new components that could use GTK+ or SDL for drawing or utilize OpenGL acceleration. Gambas 2.x versions can load up and run Gambas 1.x projects, with occasional incompatibilities.\n\nThe next major iteration of Gambas, the 3.x versions, was released on December 31, 2011. A 2015 benchmark published on the Gambas website showed Gambas 3.8.90 scripting as being faster to varying degrees than Perl 5.20.2 and the outdated 2.7.10 version of Python in many tests.\n\nGambas is designed to build graphical programs using the Qt (currently Qt 4.x or 5.x) or the GTK+ toolkit (GTK 3.x also supported as of 3.6.0); the Gambas IDE is written in Gambas. Gambas includes a GUI designer to aid in creating user interfaces, but can also make command line applications. The Gambas runtime environment is needed to run executables.\n\nFunctionality is provided by a variety of components, each of which can be selected to provide additional features. Drawing can be provided either through Qt and GTK+ toolkits, with an additional component which is designed to switch between them. Drawing can also be provided through the Simple DirectMedia Layer (currently version 1.x, with 2.x support in the works), which can also be utilized for audio playback through a separate sound component (a component for the OpenAL specification has also been added). GPU acceleration support is available through an OpenGL component, as well as other hardware functionally provided by various other components. There are also components for handling other specialized tasks.\n\nWith Gambas, developers can also use databases such as MySQL or PostgreSQL, build KDE (Qt) and GNOME GTK+ applications with DCOP, translate Visual Basic programs to Gambas and run them under Linux, build network solutions, and create CGI web applications. The IDE also includes a tool for the creation of installation packages, supporting GNU Autotools, slackpkg, pacman, RPM, and debs (the latter two then tailored for specific distributions such as Fedora/RHEL/CentOS, Mageia, Mandriva, OpenSUSE and Debian, Ubuntu/Mint).\n\nGambas since version 3.2 IDE has integrated profiler and it started to use Just-in-time compilation technology.\n\nGambas is intended to provide a similar experience as developing in Microsoft Visual Basic, but it is not a free software clone of the popular proprietary program. The author of Gambas makes it clear that there are similarities to Visual Basic, such as syntax for BASIC programs and the integrated development environment; Gambas was written from the start to be a development environment of its own and seeks to improve on the formula.\n\nIts object model and each class being represented in a file, the archiver to package the program is inspired by the Java programming language. Gambas is intended to be an alternative for former Visual Basic developers who have decided to migrate to Linux. There are also other important distinctions between the Gambas and Visual Basic. One notable example is that in Gambas array indexes always start with 0, whereas Visual Basic indexes can start with 0 or 1. Gambas also supports the += and -= shorthand not found in classic Visual Basic. Both of these are features of Visual Basic .NET however.\n\nSeveral programs and many forms of example code have been written using and for Gambas. , Freecode (formerly Freshmeat) listed 23 applications that were developed using Gambas, while the Gambas wiki listed 70; several other specialized sites list Gambas applications and code. There is even a Gambas written application, named Gambas3 ShowCase, that acts as a software center to download or install Gambas 3 applications. Several community sites, including community forums and mailing lists, also exist for Gambas. Gambas Guru offers project hosting, program listing, forums and more for Gambas users.\n\nGambas is included in the repositories of a number of Linux distributions, such as Debian, Fedora, Mandriva Linux and Ubuntu. A Microsoft Windows version of Gambas was run under the Cygwin environment, although this version was significantly less tested than its Linux counterparts and was command-line only; Cooperative Linux and derivatives have also been used, as well as specialized Linux virtual machines. An independent contributor, François Gallo, also worked on porting Gambas 3.x to Mac OS X and FreeBSD, based on using local versions of the X11 system. Gambas from version 3.2 can run on Raspberry Pi, but offers no just-in-time compilation there.\n\nIn November 2013, the future portability of Gambas was discussed, listing the main concerns being Linux kernel features utilized in the interpreter, components using Linux specific software and libraries, and primarily X11-tying in the Qt, GTK+ and desktop integration components. However, partly due to the need to upgrade to newer toolkits such as GTK 3 (added as of 3.6.0) and Qt 5 (as of 3.8.0), future versions would be less X11 tied, making projects like Cygwin or utterly native versions on other platforms more possible. Benoît Minisini stated that he intended to \"encapsulate\" X11 specific code to aid in any attempt to replace it, with the X11 support in the desktop component moved to its own component as of 3.6.0.\n\nOn October 27, 2016 a screenshot and setup guide was released from the main page for running Gambas fully through Cygwin, including most components, graphical toolkits, and the complete IDE. The relevant patches were mainlined as of version 3.9.2. This replaces the prior recommended method of using freenx forwarding from a Linux server.\n\nHello world program with graphical user interface.\nPublic Sub Main()\n\nEnd\nProgram that computes a 100-term polynomial 500000 times, and repeats it ten times (used for benchmarking).\nPrivate Sub Test(X As Float) As Float\n\nEnd\n\nPublic Sub Main()\n\nEnd\n\n\n\n"}

These countries have ruled that chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans are cognitively so similar to humans that using them as test subjects is unethical. Austria is the only country in the world where experiments on lesser apes, the gibbons, are completely banned too.\n\nNew Zealand granted strong protections to all the great ape species in 1999, but these protections have not been explicitly recognized as rights. The use of great apes is now forbidden in research, testing or teaching.\n\nThe United States is the world's largest user of chimpanzees for biomedical research, with approximately 1,200 individual subjects currently in U.S. labs. On December 15, 2011, the U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) declared in a report) that ‘most current use of chimpanzees for biomedical research is unnecessary,’ and recommended to curtail government-funded research on humans' closest relative. On the same day Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), announced that he had accepted the recommendations and will develop an implementation plan which includes the formation of an expert committee to review all submitted grant applications and projects already underway involving the use of chimpanzees. Furthermore, no new grant applications using chimpanzees will be reviewed until further notice. On 21 September 2012, the NIH announced that 110 chimpanzees owned by the government will be retired. The NIH owns about 500 chimpanzees for research, and this move signifies the first step to wind down its investment in chimpanzee research, according to Collins. Currently housed at the New Iberia Research Center in Louisiana, 10 of the retired chimpanzees will go to the chimpanzee sanctuary Chimp Haven while the rest will go to Texas Biomedical Research Institute in San Antonio. However, concerns over the chimpanzees' status in the Texas Biomedical Research Institute as ‘research ineligible’ rather than ‘retired’ prompted the NIH to reconsider the plan. On 17 October 2012 it announced that as many chimpanzees as possible will be relocated to Chimp Haven by August 2013, and that eventually all 110 will move there.\n\nOn 22 January 2013, an NIH task force released a report calling for the government to retire most of the chimpanzees under U.S. government support. The panel concluded that the animals provide little benefit in biomedical discoveries except in a few disease cases which can be supported by a small population of 50 primates for future research. It suggested that other approaches, such as genetically altered mice, should be developed and refined instead. On 13 November 2013, Congress and the Senate passed ‘The Chimpanzee Health Improvement, Maintenance and Protection Act’, which approved funding to expand the capacity of Chimp Haven and other chimpanzee sanctuaries, allowing for the transfer of almost all of the apes owned by the federal government to live in a more natural and group environment. The transfer is expected to take up to five years, at which point all but 50 chimpanzees will have been successfully ‘retired’.\n\nOn 11 June 2013, the US Fish and Wildlife Service proposed to list captive chimpanzees as endangered, matching its existing classification for wild chimpanzees. Until the Fish and Wildlife proposal, chimpanzees were the only species with a split listing that did not also classify captive members of the species as endangered. If the proposal gains final approval, it is unclear what effect it would have on laboratory research.\n\nTwo years later, on 12 June 2015, the USFWS completed the proposal and listed all chimpanzees, captive and wild, as endangered.\n\nIn January 2014, Merck & Co. announced that the company will not use chimpanzees for research, joining over 20 pharmaceutical companies and contract laboratories that have made the commitment. As the trend continues, it is estimated the remaining non-government owned 1,000 chimpanzees will be retired to sanctuaries around 2020.\n\nAnnouncing the UK’s ban in 1986, the British Home Secretary said: \"[T]his is a matter of morality. The cognitive and behavioural characteristics and qualities of these animals mean it is unethical to treat them as expendable for research.\" Britain continues to use other primates in laboratories, such as macaques and marmosets. In 2006 the permanency of the UK ban was questioned by Colin Blakemore, head of the Medical Research Council. Blakemore, while stressing he saw no \"immediate need\" to lift the ban, argued \"that under certain circumstances, such as the emergence of a lethal pandemic virus that only affected the great apes, including man, then experiments on chimps, orang-utans and even gorillas may become necessary.\" The British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection described Blakemore's stance as \"backward-looking.\" \n\nOn 7 February 2014 the UK Department of Health released a policy paper outlining the ‘3R’ (replacement, refinement and reduction) strategy to reduce animal testing in research and develop in biosciences. Using new non-animal technologies such as tissue engineering, stem cells, noninvasive imaging and mathematical modeling, the press release stated, the benefits will include not only improvement in animal welfare but also reduction in cost for the industry. The latter derives from the potentially higher successful rate using these cutting-edge technologies in early drug development while results from animal studies sometimes fail to duplicate in human.\n\nA 2013 amendment to the Animal Welfare Act with special regulations for monkeys results in the near total ban on the use of great apes as laboratory animals.\nAs of 2015, the last time great apes were used in laboratory experiments in Germany was 1991.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "225945", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=225945", "title": "Hugh Blair", "text": "Hugh Blair\n\nHugh Blair (7 April 1718 – 27 December 1800) was a Scottish minister of religion, author and rhetorician, considered one of the first great theorists of written discourse.\n\nAs a minister of the Church of Scotland, and occupant of the Chair of Rhetoric and Belles Lettres at the University of Edinburgh, Blair's teachings had a great impact in both the spiritual and the secular realms. Best known for \"Sermons\", a five volume endorsement of practical Christian morality, and \"Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres\", a prescriptive guide on composition, Blair was a valuable part of the Scottish Enlightenment.\n\nBlair was born in Edinburgh into an educated Presbyterian family. His father was John Blair, an Edinburgh merchant. He was great great grandson of Rev Robert Blair of St Andrews.\n\nFrom an early age it was clear that Blair, a weakly child, should be educated for a life in the church. Schooled at the High School, Blair studied moral philosophy and literature at the University of Edinburgh, where he graduated M.A. at the age of twenty-one. His thesis, \"Dissertatio Philosophica Inauguralis de fundamentis et obligatione legis naturae\", serves as a precursor to the later published \"Sermons\" in its discussion of the principles of morality and virtue.\n\nIn 1741, two years after the publication of his thesis, Blair received his license as a Presbyterian preacher. Shortly thereafter, the Earl of Leven heard of Blair's popularity and presented him to the Parish Church of Collessie in Fife, as their minister. \n\nBy 1743 Blair was elected as the second charge of the Canongate Kirk, and was promoted to first charge in 1745. Blair was appointed to the charge of Lady Yester's Kirk in 1754, and four years later was promoted to the High Church of St. Giles; the highest position that a clergyman could achieve in Scotland. Blair maintained this position for many years, during which time he published a five volume series of his addresses entitled \"Sermons\".\n\nHaving attained ultimate success in the church, Blair turned to matters of education. In 1757 he was presented with an honorary degree of Doctor of Divinity by the Church of St. Andrews and began to teach a course in the principles of literary composition for the University of Edinburgh in 1759. At first Blair taught without remuneration, but the popularity of his course led to the institution of a class in Rhetoric at the university and a paid professorship for Blair. Blair was eventually appointed the first Regius Chair of Rhetoric and Belles Lettres by George III; a position he maintained until his retirement in 1783. Upon retirement, Blair published several of his lectures in \"Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres\".\n\nIn 1783 Blair was one of the founder members of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. He served as its Literary President from 1789 to 1796.\n\nBlair's life was very full in both the public and the private spheres. As a central figure in the Scottish Enlightenment, he surrounded himself with other scholars in the movement. Hume, Carlyle, Adam Smith, Ferguson, and Lord Kames were among those Blair considered friends. As well, Blair had a very loving marriage to his cousin, Katherine Bannatyne, whom he married in 1748. Together they had two children: a son who died at birth and a daughter who died at the age of 20. Blair also outlived his wife, who died several years before his own death in December 1800. He was described as \"amiable, kind to young authors, and remarkable for a harmless, but rather ridiculous vanity and simplicity\".\n\nBlair is buried in Greyfriars Churchyard in Edinburgh. The grave was originally unmarked, but a memorial was erected on the south-west section of Greyfriars Kirk to commemorate him, lying between tablets to Allan Ramsay and Colin MacLaurin. It is inscribed in Latin therefore gives his name as Hugo Blair.\n\nHe was succeeded in his chair at Edinburgh University by Andrew Brown (1763-1834).\n\n\nBlair is best known for the publication of three major works: \"A Critical Dissertation on the Poems of Ossian, Son of Fingal\"; \"Sermons\"; and \"Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres\". While little attention is given to his other works, Blair published several other works anonymously, the most important of which is an eight-volume edition of Shakespeare's works edited by Blair.\n\nIn 1763 Blair published \"A Critical Dissertation on the Poems of Ossian\", his first well known openly authored publication. Blair, having long taken interest in the Celtic poetry of the Scottish Highlands, wrote a laudatory account of the poems of Ossian, the authenticity of which he maintained. Blair serves as the voice of authority on the legitimacy of the poems that he himself had urged friend James Macpherson to publish in \"Fragments of Ancient Poetry\".\n\nThe dissertation directly opposes assertions that the poems Macpherson claimed to be ancient and sublime were in fact written by several modern poets, or possibly even by Macpherson himself. After 1765 Dissertation appeared in every publication of the Ossian to give the work credibility. Blair's praise ultimately proved futile as the poems were deemed false and Macpherson was convicted of literary forgery. While this work does not speak highly of Blair's skills as a literary critic, it does provide insight into Blair's own taste, a subject that is important to his later writing.\n\nBlair published the first of his five volume series \"Sermons\" in 1777. It is a compilation of the sermons promoting practical Christian morality he delivered as a Presbyterian preacher. Despite the declining popularity of published religious teachings at the time, the success of \"Sermons\" paralleled Blair's success as a preacher. Though Blair's oral delivery was poor, often described as a 'burr,' he was considered the most popular preacher in Scotland. His success is credited to the ease with which the audience could follow his polite, organised style; a style that was translated easily into print.\n\n\"Sermons\" reflects Blair's position as a member of the moderate or latitudinarian party. In many respects, Blair was socially conservative. He did not believe in radical change, as his teachings were safe and ultimately prepared for the upper classes. Blair also had liberal tendencies demonstrated in his rejection of Calvinistic doctrines such as original sin, total corruption, and damnation.\n\n\"Sermons\" focuses on questions of morality, rather than theology, and it emphasises patriotism, action in the public sphere, and moral virtue promoted by polite secular culture. Blair encourages people to improve their natural talents through hard work, but also to be content with their appointed stations in society. He urges people to play an active role in society, to enjoy the pleasures of life, to do good works, and to maintain faith in God.\n\nBlair's appeal to both emotion and reason, combined with his non-confrontational, moderate and elegant style made each volume of \"Sermons\" increasingly popular. Four editions were published in Blair's lifetime and a fifth shortly after his death. Each volume was met with the greatest success, as they were published in many European languages and went through several printings. Though Blair's \"Sermons\" eventually fell out of favour for lacking doctrinal definiteness—\"a bucket of warm water\", as one opinion puts it—they were undoubtedly influential during Blair's lifetime and for several decades after his death.\n\nAfter retiring from his position as Chair of Rhetoric and Belles Lettres at the University of Edinburgh in 1783, Blair published his lectures for the first time, deeming it necessary because unauthorised copies of his work threatened the legacy of his teachings. The result is arguably Blair's most important work: \"Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres\". \"Lectures\", a compilation of 47 of Blair's lectures given to students at the University of Edinburgh, serves as a practical guide for youth on composition and language, a guide that makes Blair the first great theorist of written discourse.\n\n\"Lectures\" is important not because it presents radical new theories. In fact, Blair himself admits that the work is a suffusion of his understanding of classical and modern theories of language. \"Lectures\" draws on the classic works of theorists such as Quintilian and Cicero combined with the modern works of Addison, Burke, and Lord Kames to become one of the first whole language guides. As one of the first works to focus on written discourse, rather than solely on oral discourse, Blair's \"Lectures\" is a comprehensive, accessible prescriptive composition guide that combines centuries of theory in a cohesive form.\n\nThe intention of \"Lectures\" is to provide youth with a simple, organised guide on the value of rhetoric and belles lettres in the quest for upward mobility and social success. Blair believed that social cultivation, and most importantly the proper use of polite literature and effective writing, was the key to social success. For him, an education in literature was socially useful, both in its ability to elevate one's social status and its ability to promote virtue and morality. Blair also acknowledged that a person must have virtue and personal character, as well as knowledge of literature to be an effective speaker or writer.\nWhile his lectures certainly provide ideas on how to compose texts, the focus increasing becomes the proper response to written literature. He supplies sample writings from contemporary literature to illustrate the qualities of writings so that students would identify, analyze, and imbibe those qualities. The anticipated result is that students will cultivate a proper taste, and will be able to appreciate the aesthetic qualities in fine language.\n\nBlair's concept of taste involved two distinctive aspects of the human mind- a person's senses and a person's thought processing. Through exercise of the five senses, a person can have their taste refined and perfected. Through a person's reasoning abilities, a person can determine what produces genuine pleasure and what produces something inauthentic. When combining exercise and reason, the critic develops taste-delicacy and correctness of taste. Taste delicacy ties into a critic's senses, making them stronger and more accurate when it comes to sense of sight, sound, smell, taste etc. Correctness of taste ties into a critic's logic process, giving the critic the ability to make a judgment and appraise the merit of something. This also makes it easier to recognize specifically what is good and genuine and what isn’t pure or legitimate. \n\nWhile Blair's outline of the requirements for an excellent speaker or writer is an important aspect of \"Lectures\", the work covers a very broad scope of issues relating to composition. Blair's primary considerations are the issues of taste, language, style, and eloquence or public speaking. As well, Blair provides a critical examination of what he calls \"the most distinguished species of composition, both in prose and verse\" (15).\n\nAs an adherer to Scottish common sense realism, Blair's theories are founded in the belief that the principles of rhetoric evolve from the principles of nature. Blair's definition of taste reflects this sentiment: \"The power of receiving pleasure from the beauties of nature and art: (15). His analysis of the nature of taste is one of his most important contributions to compositional theories because taste, according to Blair, is foundational to rhetoric and necessary for successful written and spoken discourse.\n\nWhile Blair's work is generally a safe composite of multiple theories, it contains many valuable insights, such as the aforementioned analysis of taste. Blair's discussion of the history of written discourse is another important contribution to composition theory because this history was previously neglected. As well, Blair's naming and defining of four generic categories of writing: historical writing, philosophical writing, fictitious history, and poetry, and his analysis of the different parts of discourse plays an important role in the development of later compositional theories. One of Blair's more radical ideas is the rejection of Aristotelian figures of speech such as tropes. Blair argues that invention is the result of knowledge and cannot be aided by devices of invention as outlined by classic theorists. Though Blair rejects this traditional method of discourse, his work is still prescriptive in nature.\n\nBlair's \"Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres\" combines the fundamental principles of belletristic rhetoric and literary theory in a concise, accessible form. Drawing on classic and modern theories, Blair's work is the most comprehensive prescriptive guide on composition in the 18th century. It enjoyed tremendous success for nearly a century, as 130 editions were published in numerous European languages. This work proved a best seller in Europe, for instance in Italy went through at least a dozen different editions, but the best remains that by Giambattista Bodoni in 1801. It was known in Italy as Ugone Blair.\n\nBlair wrote in a time when print culture was flourishing and traditional rhetoric was falling out of favour. By focusing on issues of cultivation and upward mobility, Blair overshadowed the prevailing opinions of rhetoric and capitalised on the 18th century belief in the potential to rise above one's station. At this time, new money industrialists and merchants caused the middle class to rise and the English empire to grow. Blair's optimistic view that upward mobility could be affected by an understanding of eloquence and refined literature fit perfectly with the mentality of the time. In particular, the ideas presented in \"Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres\" were adapted in many prestigious institutions of learning and served as the guide on composition for many years. The \"Lectures\" were predominantly popular in the United States, with colleges such as Yale and Harvard implementing Blair's theories.\n\nAfter the authenticity of the Ossian poems was disproved, \"A Critical Dissertation on the Poems of Ossian\" caused a decline in Blair's credibility. \"Sermons\" was criticised for its sentimentality and lack of doctrinal definiteness and it failed to adapt to changing tastes. \"Lectures\" too did not maintain its popularity as theorists such as Whately and Spencer, drawing on Blair's theories, dominated the domain of composition theory.\n\nA portrait of Blair's Spanish translator, José Luis Munárriz, painted in 1815 by Goya, hangs in the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando in Madrid. Munárriz holds one of Blair's books in his hands.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "44283744", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44283744", "title": "Hyper-real Religion", "text": "Hyper-real Religion\n\nHyper-Real Religion is a sociological term coined to describe a new consumer trend in acquiring and enacting spirituality. The term was first described in the book \"Religion and Popular Culture: A Hyper-Real Testament\" by Adam Possamai. The term is used to explore the intersection between post-modernity and religion/spirituality. The idea has been expanded and critiqued by a number of academics since its creation.\n\nAccording to theories of postmodernisation, the last half of the 20th century (often termed as the 'postmodern era') saw consumerism, individualisation and choice come to the forefront of Western societies via capitalism. Thus religion as a part of this culture became increasingly commercial, individualised and democratized. People now have more choices in religion, they can often practice it in privacy and as they wish, outside of traditional institutional boundaries. Due to this change, the sociology of religion has become increasingly interested in the potential for typologization of the modes of non-institutional religion and the foundation of non-institutional religion in human nature. \n\nIt has become increasingly clear that the people leaving the structures and ceremonies of traditional religions are not instantly becoming non-religious in an atheistic sense. For example, some continue ‘believing without belonging’ to a church, others turn to alternative spiritualities and others, as discussed by Possamai, turn to consumer based religions/spiritualties partly based on popular culture, what he calls \"hyper-real religions.\" With hyper-real religion, elements from religions and popular culture are highly intertwined. They are post-modern expressions of religion, likely to be consumed and individualised, and thus have more relevance to the self than to a community and/or congregation. Thus in postmodern times, the relation between people and religion/spirituality is very fluid; if modernity brought the disenchantment of the world, as Max Weber puts it, postmodernity is re-enchanting the world through a proliferation of 'subjective myths' (myths that are relevant to the self) and through the expansion of consumerism and the internet.\n\nPossamai explains that the concept of hyper-real religions is derived from the work of Jean Baudrillard. Baudrillard put forward that we are living in an age of hyper-reality in which we are fascinated by simulations that lack a real world referent or ‘simulcra’. Possamai sees these simulations as part of the popular cultural milieu, in which “signs get their meanings from their relations with each other, rather than by reference to some independent reality or standard”. With no way to “distinguish the real from the unreal”, Hyper-reality – the situation in which reality collapses – emerges. For example, we may refer to a person as being like Superman or Homer Simpson, rather than a real-life example of a hero or dunce, and theme parks represent movies or Disney creations rather than real life. The fictional character and world become more real for us than the real person or real world. Possamai, as Geoffroy puts it, ‘re-adapted’ Baudrillard’s theory by applying it to religions that are engaged with these same simulated realities. In the most obvious examples, the Church of All Worlds draws its inspiration largely from Robert Heinlein’s \"Stranger in a Strange Land\", Jediism draws on George Lucas’ \"Star Wars\" mythology and Matrixism on \"The Matrix\" film franchise. Following these ideas Possamai defined hyper-real religions as:\n\nFollowing critiques in the \"Handbook of Hyper-real Religions\", Possamai modifies his original definition of hyper-real religions to:\n\nA hyper-real religion is a simulacrum of a religion created out of, or in symbiosis with, commodified popular culture which provides inspiration at a metaphorical level and/or is a source of beliefs in everyday life.\n\nEileen Barker suggests that the concept of hyper-real religions is ambiguous, however, she goes on, it is this ambiguity, this liminality, that gives it its greatest strength. Through this positioning it allows us to view novel religious developments and to view the effects of those developments on the older religions of the world. This allows the sharpening and refining of the tools of sociology of religion to take on contemporary developments in the religious field. Through Possamai’s concepts, the differentiating effects of individualism, consumerism and democratisation of religion become salient.\n\nMarkus Davidsen argues that Possamai has identified a real class of religions but that the concept he uses to refer to them needs to be replaced. He argues that for Baudrillard, all religions are hyper-real in the sense that they ascribe reality to the socially constructed. Barker also suggests that if we were to take the methodologically agnostic stance of the social constructionists with regard to hyper-real religions, then we would insist that all religions should be evaluated as hyper-real. They all draw on realities without referent (see Cusack). \n\nSimilarly, Geoffroy argues that Baudrillard would not have been happy with Possamai’s ‘re-adaptation’. For Baudrillard, religion had been out of the hyper-reality picture for a long time. Religion was an illusion of modernity that could not exist in hyper-reality, as our value systems exclude predestination of evil. Baudrillard was very cynical of the ability of popular culture to provide any sort of meaning: It is a form of alienation that cannot be a source of inspiration. Due to this, Geoffroy argues that it is unclear how hyper-real religions can be a re-adaptation of Baudrillard, since he does not acknowledge religion or the liberating effects of popular culture in his work. He suggests that what Possamai has done is to ‘reinterpret’ Baudrillard. Geoffroy puts forward James A. Beckford’s theories on ‘religion as a cultural resource’, Forgues ‘symbolic activity’ and Luckmann’s ‘Invisible Religion’ as alternative theories that could have been chosen to express Possamai’s idea of hyper-real religions. However he concludes that it works as a useful and enlightening ‘re-interpretation’ of hyper-reality. \n\nDavidsen concludes similarly, that this is a distinct class of religions but that we cannot meaningfully refer to them as hyper-real. He offers ‘fiction-based religion’ as a more accurate term. Fiction-based religions draw their main inspiration from fictional narratives (e.g., \"Star Wars\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\") which do not claim to refer to the actual world, but create a fictional world of their own. He draws a distinction between fiction (such as \"Star Wars\"), which does not claim to refer to the actual world, and ‘history’, including religious narratives, which does make such a claim. Third, he criticizes scholars like Cusack who argue that fandom, for instance, \"Star Trek\" fandom, is a form of religion. He draws an analytical distinction between religion and play, which he suggests makes it possible to distinguish between religious use of fiction (fiction-based religion) and playful engagement with fiction (fandom). Barker also questions whether there is a need to include these social manifestations as part of the concept of religion when perhaps they are examples of secular fiction, rather than religion, thus hyper-real religions blur the line between religion and non-religion, bringing more ideas and objects into the fold of ‘religion’.\n\nAuthors criticize the supposedly subjective nature of such consumer religions and Possamai’s use of the term ‘subjective myth’. Roeland uses Possamai’s discussion of individualistic consumer religions to compare the subjectivity of such religious consumers with the realist construction of the evangelical Christian God. While the meaning of God and religion are subjective to Possamai’s ‘subjective myth’ driven consumers, Dutch Christian evangelicals believe that their religion and God exist independently of our subjective desires and constructions. Thus, while subjectivism is present in evangelical circles, by the experiential orientation that they employ, it is employed to explore the ‘real’ presence of God. The ‘reality’ of God is experienced subjectively and attests to His reality. Thus, subjective perceptions of religious ideas do not necessarily negate their reality for practitioners and the authenticity of the experience can remain. \n\nLikewise, Johan Roeland, Stef Aupers, Dick Houtman, Martijn de Koning, and Ineke Noomen criticize Possamai’s idea of the New Age being constructed by the ‘subjective myths’ of practitioners. They suggest that these portrayals show the New Age as spiritually and religiously incoherent. To the authors, this is an unfair portrayal which misses the fact that ‘self-spirituality’ is a shared myth amongst New Age practitioners, one which goes beyond a personal story or subjective myth. They suggest, against Possamai, that the New Age is not a postmodern flight to the surface but a quest for solid foundations in a world ruined by complacent and shiftless religion. Anneke van Otterloo, Stef Aupers and Dick Houtman also argue that the New Age milieu is not as individualistic and rhizomic as accounts such as Possamai's make it seem. They argue that this is due to New Age diffusion into Western culture by cultural and popular sources.\n\nThere are criticisms of Possamai’s use of consumption. Paul Heelas critiques Possamai’s view that the New Age is a consumer religion \"par excellence\" with a specific focus on individualistic preferences. He suggests that the practices of the new age require a relational element that connects the ‘Me’ to the ‘We’ and thus are far less consumeristic and individualistic than Possamai argues. He argues that although Possamai denotes New Age as the consumer religion \"par excellence\", he does little to discuss the actual processes that he thinks lead to this label. According to Heelas ‘Consumption’ and the ‘Consumer’ as words and processes remain undefined in Possamai’s work and the work of many others in the field. \n\nHelen Berger and Douglas Ezzy suggest that the witch craft movements that they discuss have durability and integration that goes beyond the consumer religions discussed by Possamai. While Possamai sees witchcraft as consumerist in the same way as Matrixism, Berger and Ezzy argue that the stronger historical roots and variety of cultural resources available to the witchcraft community allow a higher level of durability and integration. Lastly, Geoffroy is critical of the market based nature of Possamai’s idea, as he does not think that all metaphors can be sold as commodities.\nSeveral authors critique Possamai’s thinking about the authenticity of such religions. They argue that Possamai’s concept suggests that these religions are less than ‘real’ in comparison to other religious forms. Tremlett describes this as the jargon of authenticity and cites Possamai, Cusack and Chidester as examples of this kind of framing of consumer religion. He suggests that Possamai’s work is notable for rendering material relationships within capitalism in symbols and signs. Tremlett suggests that Possamai completely fails to acknowledge or apparently understand the importance of the term ‘spectacle’, which comes from Debord’s the Society of the Spectacle or the more general consequences that follow such a strategy of analysis. For example, according to Debord, the spectacle is not a collection of images, but a social relation among people, mediated by images. In other words, the apparent weightlessness of the sign and the image in postmodernity – of, in short, the spectacle – is precisely that: it is an appearance. To Tremlett such a mode of analysis will miss the real forces that lie behind these signs and images, regardless of what certain communities may have to say about them. In resonance, but in a different critical direction, while applying the concept of Hyper-real religion to Hinduism, Scheifinger makes the argument that Hyper-real Religion is a Western construction. Given the generally hyper-real nature of the Hindu gods, his analysis raises the question of the universality of the concept, suggesting that it may only fit within a post-Christian environment where popular culture is fully commodified.\n"}

Born in the diocese of Sens, he studied Arts at the Collège de Montaigu of the University of Paris. He served as Rector of the University from December 1507 to March 1508.\n\nBeginning in 1508, Jacques Almain studied theology with John Mair at the College of Navarre in Paris. He received his license in Theology in January 1512 and his doctorate in the same subject in March of that year. When King Louis XII of France decided to support the 1511 Council of Pisa (or \"conciliabulum\", as it was called dismissively) against Pope Julius II, the University was told to support this assembly. The University chose Almain to reply to a polemical tract by Cardinal Thomas Cajetan, the Pope's most eminent apologist. Almain wrote a trenchant critique of that tract by Cajetan, but did not live to answer the \"Apologia\" the Pope's defender wrote in response. Nor did Almain comment directly on the Fifth Lateran Council called by Pope Julius to counter the assembly in Pisa.\n\nAlmain wrote in several academic genres. His earliest works were concerned with logic and the \"Physics\" of Aristotle. His \"Moralia\" became a standard textbook of moral theology, presenting ethical issues in a dry Scholastic style. He also wrote texts discussing portions of the \"Sentences\" of Peter Lombard. One text was concerned with the opinions of the medieval Dominican theologian Robert Holcot.\n\nApart from the reply to Cajetan, Almain wrote on political topics. These works included a discussion of the opinions of William of Ockham about papal power and a disputation on the power of pope and council, his earliest statement of Conciliarism.\n\nAlmain embraced the distinction between the absolute and ordained powers of God. His moral philosophy was Aristotelean, arguing for conduct in the middle ground between extremes. His political thought embraced the need for order but allowed a community to restrain any ruler whose conduct had become dangerous to its very survival. Almain's critique of Cajetan's treatise on the papacy argued that Church and State were parallel in nature, both able to act against an errant leader, whether pope or king. All of these teachings are found in the posthumous \"Opuscula\" (Paris, 1518).\n\n\n"}

He was born Michael FitzGerald in Ludlow, Shropshire in 1927 to parents from County Kerry and spent his childhood in Chesterfield and Sheffield.\n\nAt the age of 13, he was sent as a boarder to Coleg Mair, a small Catholic seminary housed in Castell Brychan, Aberystwyth. He had the great good fortune to be taught Welsh there by Saunders Lewis, the dramatist and poet who had lost his lecturer's post at University College, Swansea, following an act of arson at an RAF bombing school that was under construction. FitzGerald remained in close touch with Lewis until the latter's death in 1985, dedicating his first book of poetry \"i SL am agor drws a ffenestri\", \"to SL for opening a door and windows\".\n\nHe published two volumes of verse, \"Cadwyn Cenedl\" (\"A nation's chain\", 1969) and \"Grawn Gwirionedd\" (\"Grapes of truth\", 2006). The second contains all the poems in the first as well as about 30 others and was longlisted for the Welsh Assembly's Literature Prize in 2007. Many of his poems are devotional but he also found inspiration in the nature, people and music. In his obituary in \"The Independent\", Meic Stephens highlights a poem \"I'm gwraig\" where he purports to address his \"wife\" although he concludes his poem \"Perhaps I should note that I'm not married\". According to Meic Stephens, he had 'a talent for writing verse of a very high order'.\n\nIn 1942 he joined the Carmelite Order as a novice taking the name John and made his first profession of his religious vows in 1943. He then began higher level studies with the Carmelites in Ireland where he remained until 1948, At University College, Dublin, he began by reading Welsh in the department headed by Professor John Lloyd-Jones who advised him to switch to Greek and Latin and he graduated with a first in Classics in 1946. FitzGerald studied in Dublin for another four years and was ordained priest in 1951. This was followed by a year studying Theology in Rome and a further three reading Classics at Christ's College, Cambridge.\n\nHe returned to live in Wales in 1956 and was appointed to the staff of Coleg Mair (by then moved to Tre-gib in Carmarthenshire). Although he had already written poems in English, he now turned to Welsh, working with the Carmarthenshire dialect and mastering the intricate rules of Welsh prosody.\n\nAfter three years the college was moved to Cheltenham, but FitzGerald remained in Tre-gib until 1964. He was then appointed Chaplain to Catholic students at the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth, and six years later to a lectureship in the Department of Philosophy. When the Philosophy Department at Aberystwyth was 'rationalized' in 1993 (i.e. closed) he ceased to teach through the medium of English although continuing to teach Philosophy in the Department of Welsh. In 2004, with the closure of their community in Aberystwyth, the Carmelite Order moved him to the post of Prior of Llanelli.\n\nHe was the major force in translating the Latin Mass into the Welsh vernacular following the Second Vatican Council. In 1998 he was also a member of the ecumenical panel which produced a new translation of the Bible into Welsh. In addition to Welsh, John FitzGerald learnt Irish and Basque. He translated from Greek both ancient and modern, including Aristotle's \"Nicomachean Ethics\" and poems by Sappho and Cavafy.\n\nIn literary circles he was known as 'Ieuan Hir' and at 6\" 4' (195 cm) he towered over any company. His vows meant that he owned only the most modest of cars and in later years a frequent sight in Aberystwyth was his giant frame implausibly squeezed into the smallest model on the market.\n"}

He founded the Taman Siswa school, an institution that provided education for indigenous commoners, which otherwise was limited to the Javanese aristocracy and the Dutch colonials.\n\nHe was honored as a National Hero of Indonesia by Indonesia's first president, Sukarno, on November 28, 1959.\n\nSoewardi was born in the Javanese aristocracy, his family belonged to the royal house of Pakualaman. He was one of Prince Paku Alam III's grandsons through his father, GPH Soerjaningrat. Thanks to his family's \"priyayi\" (Javanese nobility) background, he was able to access the colonial public education, a luxury that was unattainable by most of common population in the Indies. He graduated from basic education in ELS (Dutch Primary School). Then he continued his study at STOVIA, a medical school for native students. However, he failed to graduate because of illness. \n\nLater he worked as a journalist and wrote for many newspapers, including \"Sediotomo\", \"Midden Java\", \"De Expres\", \"Oetoesan Indies\", \"Kaoem Moeda\", \"Tjahaja Timoer\" and \"Poesara\". He was also a contributor to \"Kebangoenan\", a nationalist newspaper owned by the Dutch-educated jurist and politician Phoa Liong Gie. During Soewardi's career in printed media, he was considered a talented and accomplished writer. His style of writing is popular, communicative and yet imbued with idealism for freedom and anti-colonialism sentiment.\n\nBesides being tenacious as a young reporter, Soewardi was also active in social and political organizations. Since the establishment of Boedi Oetomo in 1908, he was active in their propaganda service to socialize and promote public awareness of Indonesia as a national unity (especially in Java). He also organized Boedi Oetomo's first congress in Yogyakarta.\n\nYoung Soewardi was also a member of the \"Insulinde\", a multi-ethnic organization that was dominated by Indo activists. This organization was advocating for self-rule in the Dutch East Indies. One of the prominent figures in this organization was Ernest Douwes Dekker. Later, Soewardi was invited to join the party, when Douwes Dekker established the \" Indische Partij\".\n\nIn 1913, the Dutch East Indies government sought to collect money to fund the centennial anniversary of Dutch independence from France back in 1813. The donations were drawn from Dutch East Indies citizens, which also include \"bumiputera\" (indigenous people). This decision has ignited critical opposition and negative reactions from pro-independence nationalists, including Soewardi. He wrote several critical columns, such as \"Een maar ook voor Allen Allen voor Een\" or \"One for All, All for One\". However, the most famous piece of Ki Hadjar Dewantara's column is \"If I were a Dutchman\" (original title: \"Als ik eens Nederlander was\"), printed in \"De Expres\" newspaper on July 13, 1913. This article fiercely criticized the colonial government of Netherlands Indies. The citation of his writing, as followsː\n\nSome Dutch officials doubted that this piece was actually written by Soewardi, because compared to his earlier writings, there are some differences in style and vocabulary. Even if it is true, that it was Soewardi's writing, they suspected that Douwes Dekker might have an actively influenced Soewardi to write in such a tone.\n\nThe colonial authorities considered Soewardi's writings that criticize the colonial government to be so subversive, sensitive and divisive that they feared they might incite a popular revolt and upset the delicate social order of the Dutch East Indies. As a consequence, Soewardi was arrested under the order of Governor General Idenburg, and sentenced to exile in Bangka Island. However, both his colleagues, Douwes Dekker and Tjipto Mangoenkoesoemo, protested on his behalf, and eventually in 1913, the three of them were exiled to the Netherlands instead. These three pro-independence activist figures, Soewardi, Douwes Dekker and Tjipto, were later known as the \"Tiga Serangkai\" or the \"triad\". Soewardi at that time was only 24 years old.\n\nDuring his exile in the Netherlands, Soewardi was active in the Indonesia students' organization, the \"Indische Vereeniging\" (Indies Association), where he contemplated the idea of advancing science education for natives, by obtaining the European certificate, an education diploma which later became the foundation for the educational institutions he would found. In this study, Soewardi was fascinated by the ideas of Western education figures, such as Froebel and Montessori, as well as Indian education movement activist Santiniketan and the Tagore family. These underlying influences contributed to Soewardi's idea's for developing his own educational system.\n\nIn September 1919, Soewardi returned home to Java, Dutch East Indies. Immediately, he joined his brother in establishing a school in his native hometown. His educational background and his teaching experiences then proved to be useful to develop his concept for teaching in school, as he founded the \" Nationaal Onderwijs Instituut Ampel\" or the national college. \nDuring the time of colonial social discrimination in the early 20th century, education was only made possible for the elites, the colonial Dutch people and a handful of Javanese noblemen families. Education at that time was not made available for native commoners. In July 1922, Soewardi established the Taman Siswa school in Yogyakarta, a Javanese educational movement that strove to provide education for the native population.\n\nWhen he reached 40 years of age, according to the Javanese beliefs based upon Javanese calendar, he was required to change his name to ward of misfortunes that might befell upon him. Thus he choose \"Ki Hadjar Dewantara\" as his new name. He also scrapped the Javanese gentility title \"Raden Mas\" in front of his name. It was a gesture to demonstrate his support for social equality and his disregard for rigid social stature of Javanese society. Ki Hadjar intended to freely interact with people of all social backgrounds, and to be close to them in both body and soul.\n\nKi Hadjar Dewantara has coined a famous proverb to describe his educational ideals. Rendered in Javanese, the maxim reads: \"Ing ngarso sung tulodo, ing madyo mangun karso, tut wuri handayani.\" Which translates: \"(for those) in front should set an example, (for those) in the middle should raise the spirit, and (for those) behind should give encouragement\". The proverb is used as the principle of Taman Siswa. Today, part of this maxim, \"Tut Wuri Handayani\" is used as the motto of Indonesian Ministry of Education. It was meant to describe ideal teachers, who after transmitting knowledge to their students, would stand behind their students and give them encouragements in their quest for knowledge.\n\nDuring the Japanese occupation, Ki Hajar's activities in the field of politics and education still continued. When the Japanese government established the People Power Center (\"Pusat Tenaga Rakyat\" or Putera) in 1943, Ki Hajar was appointed as one of its leaders, in addition to Sukarno, Muhammad Hatta and K.H. Mas Mansur.\n\nIn the first cabinet of the Republic of Indonesia in the 1950s, Ki Hajar Dewantara was appointed Indonesian Minister of Education and Culture. In 1957 he received an honorary doctorate honoris causa from Indonesia's oldest university, Gadjah Mada University.\n\nHe died in Yogyakarta on April 26, 1959 and was buried in Taman Wijaya Brata cemetery.\n\nIn recognition for his dedication and accomplishments in pioneering public education in Indonesia, he was declared as the Father of Indonesian National Education, a national hero, and his birthday is appointed as the National Education Day, through Presidential Decree no. 305 of 1959, dated November 28, 1959.\n\nTaman Siswa has established Dewantara Kirti Griya Museum in Yogyakarta. The museum was built to commemorate, preserve and promote the thought, values and ideals of Ki Hajar Dewantara, the founder of Taman Siswa. In this museum, there are objects and works of Ki Hajar Dewantara. Museum collections includes his works, papers, concepts, important documents and correspondence of Ki Hajar during his lifetime as a journalist, educator, humanist and as an artist. These documents has been recorded on microfilms and some are laminated with the help the National Archives of Indonesia.\n\nKi Hajar Dewantara advocates that education should be made possible and available for all people, regardless of their sex, race, ethnicity, culture, religion, economic and social status, etc. He argued that education should be based on the values of common humanity, human freedom and the rights to seek knowledge.\n\nKi Hajar Dewantara's birthday is now celebrated as Indonesian National Education Day. He is also credited for having coined the motto; \" Tut Wuri Handayani\", today used by the ministry of education. An Indonesian navy training ship, KRI Ki Hajar Dewantara, bears his name in honor. His portrait immortalizes him in the 20,000 rupiah bank note denomination in 1998.\n\n"}

Its facility is a former Jesuit novitiate and juniorate seminary built in 1957. The center has described itself as North America's largest residential facility for holistic health and education. With 2013 revenue of $34.7 million, it employed about 626 people as of 2008 and can accommodate more than 650 overnight guests.\n\nIndian-born Amrit Desai came to the United States in 1960 to attend the Philadelphia College of Art. A close disciple of a renowned Indian yoga master named Swami Kripalu, Desai taught yoga classes to a growing number of yoga enthusiasts in the Philadelphia area. In 1966, Desai and nine others formed the Yoga Society of Pennsylvania, a nonprofit organization organized to advance the science and philosophy of yoga.\n\nIn 1972, Desai left the Philadelphia area with a handful of dedicated students to establish a small, residential yoga retreat center in Sumneytown, Pennsylvania.\n\nIn 1974, the name of the nonprofit organization was changed to “Kripalu Yoga Fellowship” to reflect an increasing emphasis on propagating the teachings of Swami Kripalu through residential retreats, depth programs, and the training of Kripalu Yoga teachers.\n\nIn 1975, Kripalu purchased a second and significantly larger facility in Summit Station, Pennsylvania, which had space for student housing, group yoga instruction, meal preparation, and a fully staffed holistic-health center that offered massage and a variety of other health services in concert with two physicians. This health center was the genesis of “healing arts,” which remains an important aspect of the Kripalu curriculum and mission.\n\nBoth the Sumneytown and Summit Station properties were staffed by an inspired group of volunteers and yoga enthusiasts who formed the nucleus of the community or ashram. Desai was the ashram’s spiritual leader, while the ashram staff offered a curriculum of yoga, holistic health, and self-discovery programs to the public.\n\nIn 1977, Desai’s teacher, Swami Kripalu, came to the United States and spent the last four years of his life in residence at Sumneytown and Summit Station. Although continuing a lifestyle of intensive yoga practice, Swami Kripalu’s presence galvanized the growth of what would become Kripalu. Delivering periodic talks and teachings, his lectures and writings inspired thousands to begin regular yoga practice. Swami Kripalu returned to India in 1981, where he died shortly thereafter. His teachings, especially those delivered in America, still form the basis of the Kripalu approach.\n\nIn early 1983, Kripalu purchased its current Stockbridge, Massachusetts, location, a former Jesuit seminary on a property called Shadowbrook, and Kripalu Center for Yoga & Health opened in December 1983.\n\nDuring the 1980s, Desai became an international figure in yoga, delivering talks, performing yoga demonstrations, and leading seminars worldwide. The Kripalu community continued to grow in size until it contained more than 350 residents. In 1994, although one of the spiritual practices of the Kripalu Center was \"Brahmacharya\" the practice of celibacy for unmarried residents, revelations surfaced of sexual relationships between Desai and several female ashram residents. When these and other alleged abuses of power were confirmed, Kripalu’s Board of Trustees called for Desai’s immediate resignation. Since 1994, and continuing today, there is no formal relationship between Kripalu and Desai. \n\nBetween 1996 and 2004, Kripalu’s leadership and staff focused on establishing a new vision, launching Kripalu as a nationally recognized yoga retreat and experiential program center. While continuing to teach Kripalu Yoga, it reached out to a broad mix of teachers from other traditions and disciplines to expand its curriculum and appeal to the growing number of Americans interested in yoga, health, wellness, and personal growth. During these years, Kripalu was restructured into a standard nonprofit organization offering a broad curriculum of educational programs and spiritual retreats. This new structure was formalized in 1999, when Kripalu officially ceased being a religious order.\n\nIn June 2009 a new, 80-room environmentally sensitive residential building, The Annex, was completed.\n\nToday, Kripalu is home to over 700 programs a year and to the Kripalu Schools of Yoga, Ayurveda, and Integrative Yoga Therapy; the Institute of Extraordinary Living; and RISE, an evidence-based conscious leadership program.\n\nKripalu's , include forests, lawns, gardens, and access to Lake Mahkeenac. Conservation easements on 225 of the acres were granted in 1997 using a framework of the U.S. Forest Legacy Program.\nKripalu's principal building was constructed by the Jesuits in 1957 to replace the Gilded Age mansion \"Shadowbrook Cottage.\" The Jesuits had planned to demolish the mansion due to high maintenance costs, but prior to demolition, the mansion was destroyed by a fire in 1956 which resulted in several fatalities. Jesuits had acquired the former estate in 1922 as a novitiate, but moved away in 1970.\nA $15 million, six-story housing annex with 80 guest rooms, was completed in 2010. Designed by architect Peter Rose, the annex incorporates sustainable design elements and won a 2010 award for specialized housing from the American Institute of Architects. The institute commented on the building's interior natural lighting, and noted that the architectural design and climate control systems are integrated and consume 40 percent less energy than a conventional building. Rose also developed a master plan for increasing the center's capacity and developing it into \"a model of environmental responsibility\" through improvements to existing buildings, landscaping, and new construction.\n\nKripalu Center for Yoga & Health formerly operated its own water supply. Groundwater from onsite wells was used for its water supply source, supplemented by water purchased from the Lenox water department. There were regulatory agency \"concerns\" resulting in at least two enforcement actions about the water supply's potential vulnerability to contamination, and as of 2009 the center's water supply had been converted to rely solely on purchased water obtained from surface water sources.\n\nAs of 2008, Kripalu Center in Stockbridge said it offered more than 750 programs and spiritual retreats attended by about 25,000 people annually. Total annual visitation is reported to be about 30,000 people. Many workshops are conducted by outside presenters. Kripalu Center also offers a semester-long program for young adults; projects in music, weight loss and post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nAbout 2,200 independent instructors using the trademarked term \"Kripalu\" pay training and certification fees. These affiliates obtain access to liability insurance and other business and marketing support.\n\nIn 1999, Kripalu changed its legal status from religious organization to secular non-profit organization, with a stated mission to teach the art and science of yoga.\n\nFrom 2004 until 2010, Patton Garrett Sarley Jr., served as Kripalu's president and chief executive. Sarley, who goes by the name \"Dinabandhu\", a Sanskrit name meaning \"friend of the poor and the helpless\", had been Kripalu's chief operating officer under Desai, but left at the time of Desai's resignation. During his absence from Kripalu, Sarley headed the Omega Institute, an educational center. In 2004, a struggling Kripalu rehired Sarley to be its president and chief executive officer, and gave him a seat on the board. His wife, Mary \"Ila\" Sarley was also brought on, as executive vice president.\n\nOver the next five years Kripalu saw its bookings increase steadily and its total revenue double. By 2008 revenue have grown to $27.4 million, a seven percent increase from the previous year. Expenses in 2008 rose nine percent, to $26.23 million, with payroll and employee benefit expenses rising 4.4 percent from 2007. The Sarleys were given a 35 percent increase in their combined pay and benefits, raising their total executive compensation from $422,000 in 2007 to $584,000 in 2008.\n\nThe steady increase in business came to an abrupt halt towards the start of 2009. Caught in the wake of the deepest recession since the Great Depression, Kripalu saw bookings for 2009 plunging as much as 25 percent from previous levels.\n\nKripalu's leadership responded to the expected drop in business in several ways: in January 2009, they eliminated 35 full-time and 26 part-time positions (roughly 15 percent of Kripalu's staff); they canceled bonuses, and they reduced senior and executive pay by 5 to 15 percent. According to Dinabandhu Sarley, a steep drop in business and high expenses necessitated the cuts. \"All told, we went through and we had to cut,\" Sarley said. \"We have very high overhead and very high fixed costs. There is no wiggle room on some of these things.\" After the cuts, the Sarleys received a total 2009 executive compensation of $538,000.\n\nIn 2009 the organization reported revenue of $25.51 million and expenses of $24.35 million. Revenue in 2012 grew six percent to $32.5 million.\n\nIn October 2010, the Sarley executive team was replaced by CEO David Surrenda, who was previously (since 1987) director of an Oakland, California, consulting firm called Leadership Edge, and Chairman of the Board Lisette Cooper, founder of investment management firm Athena Capital Advisors. In August 2012, Surrenda was replaced as CEO by Richard \"Shobhan\" Faulds, who had served as the chairman of Kripalu's board of trustees from 2001 to 2010 and had been president from 1998 to 2001. Faulds has also been Kripalu’s legal counsel since 1989. David Lipsius was named chief executive of Kripalu in September 2012, after joining Kripalu in January \"to pursue his personal dharma.\" Faulds became Vice President of Yoga Development. During 2012, Surrenda's salary and benefits were $260,097, and Faulds' were $200,762.\nIn 2014, Faulds' compensation fell to $137,303, while Lipsius was paid $298,105. Revenue in 2014 was about $33.8 million.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "21345243", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21345243", "title": "Marquis de Sade", "text": "Marquis de Sade\n\nDonatien Alphonse François, Marquis de Sade (; 2 June 1740 – 2 December 1814), was a French nobleman, revolutionary politician, philosopher, and writer, famous for his libertine sexuality. His works include novels, short stories, plays, dialogues, and political tracts; in his lifetime some were published under his own name while others appeared anonymously, which Sade denied having written. Sade is best known for his erotic works, which combined philosophical discourse with pornography, depicting sexual fantasies with an emphasis on violence, suffering, criminality, and blasphemy against Christianity. He gained notoriety for putting these fantasies into practice with both consenting and non-consenting people. He claimed to be a proponent of absolute freedom, unrestrained by morality, religion, or law. The words \"sadism\" and \"sadist\" are derived from his name.\n\nSade was incarcerated in various prisons and an insane asylum for about 32 years of his life: 11 years in Paris (10 of which were spent in the Bastille), a month in the Conciergerie, two years in a fortress, a year in Madelonnettes Convent, three years in Bicêtre Asylum, a year in Sainte-Pélagie Prison, and 12 years in the Charenton Asylum. During the French Revolution, he was an elected delegate to the National Convention. Many of his works were written in prison.\n\nThere continues to be a fascination with Sade among scholars and in popular culture. Prolific French intellectuals such as Roland Barthes, Jacques Lacan, Jacques Derrida and Michel Foucault have published studies of him. On the other hand the French hedonist philosopher Michel Onfray has attacked this cult, writing that \"It is intellectually bizarre to make Sade a hero.\"\nThere have also been numerous film adaptions of his work, the most notable being \"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom\", an adaptation of his infamous book, \"The 120 Days of Sodom\".\n\nDonatien Alphonse François de Sade was born on 2 June 1740, in the Hôtel de Condé, Paris, to Jean Baptiste François Joseph, Count de Sade and Marie Eléonore de Maillé de Carman, cousin and Lady-in-waiting to the Princess of Condé. He was his parents' only surviving child. He was educated by an uncle, the Abbé de Sade. In Sade's youth, his father abandoned the family; his mother joined a convent. He was raised with servants who indulged \"his every whim,\" which led to his becoming \"known as a rebellious and spoiled child with an ever-growing temper.\"\n\nLater in his childhood, Sade was sent to the Lycée Louis-le-Grand in Paris, a Jesuit college, for four years. While at the school, he was tutored by Abbé Jacques-François Amblet, a priest. Later in life, at one of Sade's trials the Abbé testified, saying that Sade had a \"passionate temperament which made him eager in the pursuit of pleasure\" but had a \"good heart.\" At the Lycée Louis-le-Grand, he was subjected to \"severe corporal punishment,\" including \"flagellation,\" and he \"spent the rest of his adult life obsessed with the violent act.\" At age 14, Sade began attending an elite military academy.\n\nAfter 20 months of training, on 14 December 1755, at age 15, Sade was commissioned as a sub-lieutenant, becoming a soldier. After 13 months as a sub-lieutenant, he was commissioned to the rank of cornet in the Brigade de S. André of the Comte de Provence's Carbine Regiment. He eventually became Colonel of a Dragoon regiment and fought in the Seven Years' War. In 1763, on returning from war, he courted a rich magistrate's daughter, but her father rejected his suitorship and instead arranged a marriage with his elder daughter, Renée-Pélagie de Montreuil; that marriage produced two sons and a daughter. In 1766, he had a private theatre built in his castle, the Château de Lacoste, in Provence. In January 1767, his father died.\n\nThe men of the Sade family alternated between using the \"marquis\" and \"comte\" (count) titles. His grandfather, Gaspard François de Sade, was the first to use \"marquis\"; occasionally, he was the \"Marquis de Sade\", but is identified in documents as the \"Marquis de Mazan\". The Sade family were \"noblesse d'épée\", claiming at the time the oldest, Frank-descended nobility, so assuming a noble title without a King's grant, was customarily \"\". Alternating title usage indicates that titular hierarchy (below \"duc et pair\") was notional; theoretically, the \"marquis\" title was granted to noblemen owning \"several\" countships, but its use by men of dubious lineage caused its disrepute. At Court, precedence was by seniority and royal favor, not title. There is father-and-son correspondence, wherein father addresses son as \"marquis\".\n\nFor many years, Sade's descendants regarded his life and work as a scandal to be suppressed. This did not change until the mid-twentieth century, when the Comte Xavier de Sade reclaimed the marquis title, long fallen into disuse, on his visiting cards, and took an interest in his ancestor's writings. At that time, the \"divine marquis\" of legend was so unmentionable in his own family that Xavier de Sade only learned of him in the late 1940s when approached by a journalist. He subsequently discovered a store of Sade's papers in the family château at Condé-en-Brie, and worked with scholars for decades to enable their publication. His youngest son, the Marquis Thibault de Sade, has continued the collaboration. The family have also claimed a trademark on the name. The family sold the Château de Condé in 1983. As well as the manuscripts they retain, others are held in universities and libraries. Many, however, were lost in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. A substantial amount were destroyed after Sade's death at the instigation of his son, Donatien-Claude-Armand.\n\nSade lived a scandalous libertine existence and repeatedly procured young prostitutes as well as employees of both sexes in his castle in Lacoste. He was also accused of blasphemy, a serious offense at that time. His behavior also included an affair with his wife's sister, Anne-Prospère, who had come to live at the castle.\n\nBeginning in 1763, Sade lived mainly in or near Paris. Several prostitutes there complained about mistreatment by him and he was put under surveillance by the police, who made detailed reports of his activities. After several short imprisonments, which included a brief incarceration in the Château de Saumur (then a prison), he was exiled to his château at Lacoste in 1768.\n\nThe first major scandal occurred on Easter Sunday in 1768, in which Sade procured the services of a woman, Rose Keller, a widow-beggar who approached him for alms. He told her she could make money by working for him—she understood her work to be that of a housekeeper. At his chateau at Arcueil, Sade ripped her clothes off, threw her on a divan and tied her by the four limbs, face-down, so that she could not see behind her. Then he whipped her. Keller testified that he made various incisions on her body into which he poured hot wax, although investigators found no broken skin on Keller, and Sade explained that he had applied ointment to her after the whipping. Keller finally escaped by climbing out of a second-floor window and running away. The Sade family paid the maid to keep her quiet, but the wave of social embarrassment damaged Sade's reputation. La Présidente, Sade's mother-in-law, obtained a \"lettre de cachet\" (a royal order of arrest and imprisonment, without stated cause or access to the courts) from the King, protecting Sade from the jurisdiction of the courts. The \"lettre de cachet\" would later prove disastrous for the marquis.\n\nFour years later, in 1772, Sade would commit further acts with four prostitutes and his manservant, Latour. That episode in Marseille involved the non-lethal incapacitating of prostitutes with the supposed aphrodisiac Spanish fly and sodomy with Latour. The two men were sentenced to death \"in absentia\" for sodomy and the poisoning. They fled to Italy, Sade taking his wife's sister with him. Sade and Latour were caught and imprisoned at the Fortress of Miolans in French Savoy in late 1772, but escaped four months later.\n\nSade later hid at Lacoste where he rejoined his wife, who became an accomplice in his subsequent endeavors. In 1774, Sade trapped six children, including one boy, in his chateau for six weeks during which time he subjected them to abuse, which his wife allowed. He kept a group of young employees at the chateau, most of whom complained about sexual mistreatment and quickly left his service. Sade was forced to flee to Italy once again. It was during this time he wrote \"Voyage d'Italie\". In 1776, he returned to Lacoste, again hired several servant girls, most of whom soon fled. In 1777, the father of one of those employees went to Lacoste to claim his daughter, and attempted to shoot the Marquis at point-blank range, but the gun misfired.\n\nLater that year, Sade was tricked into going to Paris to visit his supposedly ill mother, who in fact had recently died. He was arrested and imprisoned in the Château de Vincennes. He successfully appealed his death sentence in 1778 but remained imprisoned under the \"lettre de cachet\". He escaped but was soon recaptured. He resumed writing and met fellow prisoner Comte de Mirabeau, who also wrote erotic works. Despite this common interest, the two came to dislike each other intensely.\n\nIn 1784, Vincennes was closed, and Sade was transferred to the Bastille. The following year, he wrote the manuscript for his magnum opus \"Les 120 Journées de Sodome\" (\"The 120 Days of Sodom\"), which he wrote in miniscule handwriting on a continuous roll of paper he rolled tightly and placed in his cell wall to hide it. He was unable to finish the work; on 4 July 1789, he was transferred \"naked as a worm\" to the insane asylum at Charenton near Paris, two days after he reportedly incited unrest outside the prison by shouting to the crowds gathered there, \"They are killing the prisoners here!\" Sade was unable to retrieve the manuscript before being removed from the prison. The storming of the Bastille, a major event of the French Revolution, would occur ten days after Sade left, on 14 July. To his despair, he believed that the manuscript was destroyed in the storming of the Bastille, though it was actually saved by a man named Arnoux de Saint-Maximin two days before the Bastille was attacked. It is not known why Saint-Maximin chose to bring the manuscript to safety, nor indeed is anything else about him known.\nIn 1790, Sade was released from Charenton after the new National Constituent Assembly abolished the instrument of \"lettre de cachet\". His wife obtained a divorce soon after.\n\nDuring Sade's time of freedom, beginning in 1790, he published several of his books anonymously. He met Marie-Constance Quesnet, a former actress with a six-year-old son, who had been abandoned by her husband. Constance and Sade would stay together for the rest of his life.\n\nHe initially ingratiated himself with the new political situation after the revolution, supported the Republic, called himself \"Citizen Sade\", and managed to obtain several official positions despite his aristocratic background.\n\nBecause of the damage done to his estate in Lacoste, which was sacked in 1789 by an angry mob, he moved to Paris. In 1790, he was elected to the National Convention, where he represented the far left. He was a member of the Piques section, notorious for its radical views. He wrote several political pamphlets, in which he called for the implementation of direct vote. However, there is much evidence suggesting that he suffered abuse from his fellow revolutionaries due to his aristocratic background. Matters were not helped by his son's May 1792 desertion from the military, where he had been serving as a second lieutenant and the \"aide-de-camp\" to an important colonel, the Marquis de Toulengeon. Sade was forced to disavow his son's desertion in order to save himself. Later that year, his name was added – whether by error or wilful malice – to the list of émigrés of the Bouches-du-Rhône department.\n\nWhile claiming he was opposed to the Reign of Terror in 1793, he wrote an admiring eulogy for Jean-Paul Marat. At this stage, he was becoming publicly critical of Maximilien Robespierre and, on 5 December, he was removed from his posts, accused of \"moderatism\", and imprisoned for almost a year. He was released in 1794 after the end of the Reign of Terror.\n\nIn 1796, now all but destitute, he had to sell his ruined castle in Lacoste.\n\nIn 1801, Napoleon Bonaparte ordered the arrest of the anonymous author of \"Justine\" and \"Juliette\". Sade was arrested at his publisher's office and imprisoned without trial; first in the Sainte-Pélagie Prison and, following allegations that he had tried to seduce young fellow prisoners there, in the harsh Bicêtre Asylum.\n\nAfter intervention by his family, he was declared insane in 1803 and transferred once more to the Charenton Asylum. His ex-wife and children had agreed to pay his pension there. Constance, pretending to be his relative, was allowed to live with him at Charenton. The director of the institution, Abbé de Coulmier, allowed and encouraged him to stage several of his plays, with the inmates as actors, to be viewed by the Parisian public. Coulmier's novel approaches to psychotherapy attracted much opposition. In 1809, new police orders put Sade into solitary confinement and deprived him of pens and paper. In 1813, the government ordered Coulmier to suspend all theatrical performances.\n\nSade began a sexual relationship with 14-year-old Madeleine LeClerc, daughter of an employee at Charenton. This affair lasted some four years, until his death in 1814.\n\nHe had left instructions in his will forbidding that his body be opened for any reason whatsoever, and that it remain untouched for 48 hours in the chamber in which he died, and then placed in a coffin and buried on his property located in Malmaison near Épernon. These instructions were not followed; he was buried at Charenton. His skull was later removed from the grave for phrenological examination. His son had all his remaining unpublished manuscripts burned, including the immense multi-volume work \"Les Journées de Florbelle\".\n\nNumerous writers and artists, especially those concerned with sexuality, have been both repelled and fascinated by Sade. He has garnered the title of rapist and pedophile, and critics have debated whether his work has any redeeming value. An article in \"The Independent\", a British online newspaper, gives contrasting views: the French novelist Pierre Guyotat said, \"Sade is, in a way, our Shakespeare. He has the same sense of tragedy, the same sweeping grandeur\" while anarchist philosopher Michel Onfray said, \"it is intellectually bizarre to make Sade a hero... Even according to his most hero-worshipping biographers, this man was a sexual delinquent\".\n\nThe contemporary rival pornographer Rétif de la Bretonne published an \"Anti-Justine\" in 1798.\n\nGeoffrey Gorer, an English anthropologist and author (1905–1985), wrote one of the earliest books on Sade entitled \"The Revolutionary Ideas of the Marquis de Sade\" in 1935. He pointed out that Sade was in complete opposition to contemporary philosophers for both his \"complete and continual denial of the right to property\" and for viewing the struggle in late 18th century French society as being not between \"the Crown, the bourgeoisie, the aristocracy or the clergy, or sectional interests of any of these against one another\", but rather all of these \"more or less united against the proletariat.\" By holding these views, he cut himself off entirely from the revolutionary thinkers of his time to join those of the mid-nineteenth century. Thus, Gorer argued, \"he can with some justice be called the first reasoned socialist.\"\n\nSimone de Beauvoir (in her essay \"Must we burn Sade?\", published in \"Les Temps modernes\", December 1951 and January 1952) and other writers have attempted to locate traces of a radical philosophy of freedom in Sade's writings, preceding modern existentialism by some 150 years. He has also been seen as a precursor of Sigmund Freud's psychoanalysis in his focus on sexuality as a motive force. The surrealists admired him as one of their forerunners, and Guillaume Apollinaire famously called him \"the freest spirit that has yet existed\".\n\nPierre Klossowski, in his 1947 book \"Sade Mon Prochain\" (\"Sade My Neighbour\"), analyzes Sade's philosophy as a precursor of nihilism, negating Christian values and the materialism of the Enlightenment.\n\nOne of the essays in Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno's \"Dialectic of Enlightenment\" (1947) is titled \"Juliette, or Enlightenment and Morality\" and interprets the ruthless and calculating behavior of \"Juliette\" as the embodiment of the philosophy of enlightenment. Similarly, psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan posited in his 1966 essay \"Kant avec Sade\" that Sade's ethics was the complementary completion of the categorical imperative originally formulated by Immanuel Kant. However, at least one philosopher has rejected Adorno and Horkheimer's claim that Sade's moral skepticism is actually coherent, or that it reflects Enlightenment thought.\n\nIn his 1988 \"Political Theory and Modernity\", William E. Connolly analyzes Sade's \"Philosophy in the Bedroom\" as an argument against earlier political philosophers, notably Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Thomas Hobbes, and their attempts to reconcile nature, reason, and virtue as bases of ordered society. Similarly, Camille Paglia argued that Sade can be best understood as a satirist, responding \"point by point\" to Rousseau's claims that society inhibits and corrupts mankind's innate goodness: Paglia notes that Sade wrote in the aftermath of the French Revolution, when Rousseauist Jacobins instituted the bloody Reign of Terror and Rousseau's predictions were brutally disproved. \"Simply follow nature, Rousseau declares. Sade, laughing grimly, agrees.\"\n\nIn \"The Sadeian Woman: And the Ideology of Pornography\" (1979), Angela Carter provides a feminist reading of Sade, seeing him as a \"moral pornographer\" who creates spaces for women. Similarly, Susan Sontag defended both Sade and Georges Bataille's \"Histoire de l'œil\" (\"Story of the Eye\") in her essay \"The Pornographic Imagination\" (1967) on the basis their works were transgressive texts, and argued that neither should be censored. By contrast, Andrea Dworkin saw Sade as the exemplary woman-hating pornographer, supporting her theory that pornography inevitably leads to violence against women. One chapter of her book \"Pornography: Men Possessing Women\" (1979) is devoted to an analysis of Sade. Susie Bright claims that Dworkin's first novel \"Ice and Fire\", which is rife with violence and abuse, can be seen as a modern retelling of Sade's \"Juliette\".\n\nSexual sadism disorder, a mental condition named after Sade, has been defined as experiencing sexual arousal in response to extreme pain, suffering or humiliation done \"non-consensually\" to others (as described in Sade's novels). Other terms have been used to describe the condition, which may overlap with other sexual preferences that also involve inflicting pain. It is distinct from situations where \"consenting\" individuals use mild or simulated pain or humiliation for sexual excitement.\n\nVarious influential cultural figures have expressed a great interest in Sade's work, including the French philosopher Michel Foucault, the American film maker John Waters and the Spanish filmmaker Jesús Franco. The poet Algernon Charles Swinburne is also said to have been highly influenced by Sade. Nikos Nikolaidis' 1979 film \"The Wretches Are Still Singing\" was shot in a surreal way with a predilection for the aesthetics of the Marquis de Sade; Sade is said to have influenced Romantic and Decadent authors such as Charles Baudelaire, Gustave Flaubert, and Rachilde; and to have influenced a growing popularity of nihilism in Western thought. Sade's notions on strength and weakness and good and evil, such as the \"equilibrium\" of good and evil in the world required by Nature which the monk Clément mentions in \"Justine\", may have also been a considerable influence on Friedrich Nietzsche, particularly concerning the views on good and evil in Nietzsche's \"On the Genealogy of Morality\" (1887).\nThe philosopher of egoist anarchism Max Stirner is also speculated to have been influenced by Sade's work.\n\nSerial killer Ian Brady, who with Myra Hindley carried out torture and murder of children known as the Moors murders in England during the 1960s, was fascinated by Sade, and the suggestion was made at their trial and appeals that the tortures of the children (the screams and pleadings of whom they tape-recorded) were influenced by Sade's ideas and fantasies. According to Donald Thomas, who has written a biography on Sade, Brady and Hindley had read very little of Sade's actual work; the only book of his they possessed was an anthology of excerpts that included none of his most extreme writings. In the two suitcases found by the police that contained books that belonged to Brady was \"The Life and Ideas of the Marquis de Sade\". Hindley herself claimed that Brady would send her to obtain books by Sade, and that after reading them he became sexually aroused and beat her.\n\nIn \"Philosophy in the Bedroom\" Sade proposed the use of induced abortion for social reasons and population control, marking the first time the subject had been discussed in public. It has been suggested that Sade's writing influenced the subsequent medical and social acceptance of abortion in Western society.\n\nThere have been many and varied references to the Marquis de Sade in popular culture, including fictional works and biographies. The eponym of the psychological and subcultural term \"sadism\", his name is used variously to evoke sexual violence, licentiousness, and freedom of speech. In modern culture his works are simultaneously viewed as masterful analyses of how power and economics work, and as erotica. Sade's sexually explicit works were a medium for the articulation of the corrupt and hypocritical values of the elite in his society, which caused him to become imprisoned. He thus became a symbol of the artist's struggle with the censor. Sade's use of pornographic devices to create provocative works that subvert the prevailing moral values of his time inspired many other artists in a variety of media. The cruelties depicted in his works gave rise to the concept of sadism. Sade's works have to this day been kept alive by artists and intellectuals because they espouse a philosophy of extreme individualism.\n\nIn the late 20th century, there was a resurgence of interest in Sade; leading French intellectuals like Roland Barthes, Jacques Lacan, Jacques Derrida, and Michel Foucault published studies of the philosopher, and interest in Sade among scholars and artists continued. In the realm of visual arts, many surrealist artists had interest in the \"Divine Marquis.\" Sade was celebrated in surrealist periodicals, and feted by figures such as Guillaume Apollinaire, Paul Éluard, and Maurice Heine; Man Ray admired Sade because he and other surrealists viewed him as an ideal of freedom. The first \"Manifesto of Surrealism\" (1924) announced that \"Sade is surrealist in sadism\", and extracts of the original draft of \"Justine\" were published in \"Le Surréalisme au service de la révolution\". In literature, Sade is referenced in several stories by horror and science fiction writer (and author of Psycho) Robert Bloch, while Polish science fiction author Stanisław Lem wrote an essay analyzing the game theory arguments appearing in Sade's \"Justine\". The writer Georges Bataille applied Sade's methods of writing about sexual transgression to shock and provoke readers.\n\nSade's life and works have been the subject of numerous fictional plays, films, pornographic or erotic drawings, etchings, and more.\nThese include Peter Weiss's play \"Marat/Sade\", a fantasia extrapolating from the fact that Sade directed plays performed by his fellow inmates at the Charenton asylum. Yukio Mishima, Barry Yzereef, and Doug Wright also wrote plays about Sade; Weiss's and Wright's plays have been made into films. His work is referenced on film at least as early as\nLuis Buñuel's \"L'Âge d'Or\" (1930), the final segment of which provides a coda to \"120 Days of Sodom\", with the four debauched noblemen emerging from their mountain retreat. In 1969, American International Films released a German-made production called \"de Sade\", with Keir Dullea in the title role. Pier Paolo Pasolini filmed \"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom\" (1975),\nupdating Sade's novel to the brief Salò Republic; Benoît Jacquot's \"Sade\" and Philip Kaufman's \"Quills\" (from the play of the same name by Doug Wright) both hit cinemas in 2000. \"Quills\", inspired by Sade's imprisonment and battles with the censorship in his society, portrays him as a literary freedom fighter who is a martyr to the cause of free expression. \"Sade\" is a 2000 French film directed by Benoît Jacquot starring Daniel Auteuil as the Marquis de Sade, which was adapted by Jacques Fieschi and Bernard Minoret from the novel \"La terreur dans le boudoir\" by Serge Bramly.\n\nOften Sade himself has been depicted in American popular culture less as a revolutionary or even as a libertine and more akin to a sadistic, tyrannical villain. For example, in the final episode of the television series \"\", Micki, the female protagonist, travels back in time and ends up being imprisoned and tortured by Sade. Similarly, in the horror film \"Waxwork\", Sade is among the film's wax villains to come alive.\n\nThe Marquis de Sade viewed Gothic fiction as a genre that relied heavily on magic and phantasmagoria. In his literary criticism Sade sought to prevent his fiction from being labeled \"Gothic\" by emphasizing Gothic's supernatural aspects as the fundamental difference from themes in his own work. But while he sought this separation he believed the Gothic played a necessary role in society and discussed its roots and its uses. He wrote that the Gothic novel was a perfectly natural, predictable consequence of the revolutionary sentiments in Europe. He theorized that the adversity of the period had rightfully caused Gothic writers to \"look to hell for help in composing their alluring novels.\" Sade held the work of writers Matthew Lewis and Ann Radcliffe high above other Gothic authors, praising the brilliant imagination of Radcliffe and pointing to Lewis' \"The Monk\" as without question the genre's best achievement. Sade nevertheless believed that the genre was at odds with itself, arguing that the supernatural elements within Gothic fiction created an inescapable dilemma for both its author and its readers. He argued that an author in this genre was forced to choose between elaborate explanations of the supernatural or no explanation at all and that in either case the reader was unavoidably rendered incredulous. Despite his celebration of \"The Monk\", Sade believed that there was not a single Gothic novel that had been able to overcome these problems, and that a Gothic novel that did would be universally regarded for its excellence in fiction.\n\nMany assume that Sade's criticism of the Gothic novel is a reflection of his frustration with sweeping interpretations of works like \"Justine\". Within his objections to the lack of verisimilitude in the Gothic may have been an attempt to present his own work as the better representation of the whole nature of man. Since Sade professed that the ultimate goal of an author should be to deliver an accurate portrayal of man, it is believed that Sade's attempts to separate himself from the Gothic novel highlights this conviction. For Sade, his work was best suited for the accomplishment of this goal in part because he was not chained down by the supernatural silliness that dominated late 18th-century fiction. Moreover, it is believed that Sade praised \"The Monk\" (which displays Ambrosio's sacrifice of his humanity to his unrelenting sexual appetite) as the best Gothic novel chiefly because its themes were the closest to those within his own work.\n\nSade's fiction has been tagged under many different titles, including pornography, Gothic, and baroque. Sade's most famous books are often classified not as Gothic but as libertine novels, and include the novels \"Justine, or the Misfortunes of Virtue\"; \"Juliette\"; \"The 120 Days of Sodom\"; and \"Philosophy in the Bedroom\". These works challenge traditional perceptions of sexuality, religion, law, age, and gender. His opinions on sexual violence, sadism, and pedophilia stunned even those contemporaries of Sade who were quite familiar with the dark themes of the Gothic novel during its popularity in the late 18th century. Suffering is the primary rule, as in these novels one must often decide between sympathizing with the torturer or the victim. While these works focus on the dark side of human nature, the magic and phantasmagoria that dominates the Gothic is noticeably absent and is the primary reason these works are not considered to fit the genre.\n\nThrough the unreleased passions of his libertines, Sade wished to shake the world at its core. With \"120 Days\", for example, Sade wished to present \"the most impure tale that has ever been written since the world exists.\" Despite his literary attempts at evil, his characters and stories often fell into repetition of sexual acts and philosophical justifications. Simone de Beauvoir and Georges Bataille have argued that the repetitive form of his libertine novels, though hindering the artfulness of his prose, ultimately strengthened his individualist arguments.\n\nSubtitled \"Heroic and Tragic Tales\", Sade combines romance and horror, employing several Gothic tropes for dramatic purposes. There is blood, banditti, corpses, and of course insatiable lust. Compared to works like \"Justine\", here Sade is relatively tame, as overt eroticism and torture is subtracted for a more psychological approach. It is the impact of sadism instead of acts of sadism itself that emerge in this work, unlike the aggressive and rapacious approach in his libertine works. The modern volume entitled \"Gothic Tales\" collects a variety of other short works of fiction intended to be included in Sade's \"Contes et Fabliaux d'un Troubadour Provencal du XVIII Siecle\".\n\nAn example is \"Eugénie de Franval\", a tale of incest and retribution. In its portrayal of conventional moralities it is something of a departure from the erotic cruelties and moral ironies that dominate his libertine works. It opens with a domesticated approach:\n\nTo enlighten mankind and improve its morals is the only lesson which we offer in this story. In reading it, may the world discover how great is the peril which follows the footsteps of those who will stop at nothing to satisfy their desires.\n\nDescriptions in \"Justine\" seem to anticipate Radcliffe's scenery in \"The Mysteries of Udolpho\" and the vaults in \"The Italian\", but, unlike these stories, there is no escape for Sade's virtuous heroine, Justine. Unlike the milder Gothic fiction of Radcliffe, Sade's protagonist is brutalized throughout and dies tragically. To have a character like Justine, who is stripped without ceremony and bound to a wheel for fondling and thrashing, would be unthinkable in the domestic Gothic fiction written for the bourgeoisie. Sade even contrives a kind of affection between Justine and her tormentors, suggesting shades of masochism in his heroine.\n\nDespite the strong adverse reaction to Sade's work and Sade's own disassociation from the Gothic novel, the similarities between the fiction of sadism and the Gothic novel were much closer than many of its readers or providers even realized. After the controversy surrounding Matthew Lewis' \"The Monk\", Minerva Press released \"The New Monk\" as a supposed indictment of a wholly immoral book. It features the sadistic Mrs. Rod, whose boarding school for young women becomes a torture chamber equipped with its own \"flogging-room\". Ironically, \"The New Monk\" wound up increasing the level of cruelty, but as a parody of the genre, it illuminates the link between sadism and the Gothic novel.\n\n\n"}

Each user is a member of a specific Mastodon server, known as an \"instance\" of the software, but can connect and communicate with users on other instances as well. Users post short messages called \"toots\" for others to see, subject to the adjustable privacy settings of the user and their particular instance. The Mastodon mascot is a brown or grey Proboscidean sometimes depicted using a tablet or smartphone.\n\nThe software seeks to distinguish itself from Twitter through its orientation towards independently operated small communities. Thus it has a community-based, rather than top-down, moderation and service operation, based on cooperation without direct dependence. Like Twitter, Mastodon supports direct, private messages between users, but unlike \"tweets\" posted on Twitter, Mastodon’s \"toots\" can be either private to the user, private to the user's followers, public on a specific instance, or public across a network of instances.\n\nMastodon servers run social networking software that is capable of communicating either via the OStatus protocol, or also the newer ActivityPub standard. A Mastodon user can therefore interact with users on any other server in the Fediverse that supports these.\nMastodon approximates the microblogging user experience of Twitter, where users post short-form status messages for others to see. On Mastodon, these messages can include up to 500 text-based characters, an extension of Twitter's 280-character limit (originally 140), and posts are called \"toots\" instead of \"tweets\", as is the case on Twitter.\n\nUsers join a specific Mastodon server, known as an \"instance\", rather than a single flagship website or application. The instances are connected as nodes in a network, and each server can administrate its own rules, account privileges, and whether to share messages to and from other instances. The flagship instance, Mastodon.social, had about 42,000 users as of early April 2017. Other instances are based on communal interests, such as Internet memes, \"Minecraft\", or technology. The global use has risen from 766,500 users as of August 1, 2017, to 1 million users on December 1, 2017.\n\nThe service includes a number of privacy features. Each message has a variety of privacy options available, and users can choose whether the post is public or private. Public messages display on a global feed, known as a timeline, and private messages are only shared on the timelines of the user's followers. Messages can also be marked as unlisted from timelines or direct between users. Users can also mark their accounts as completely private. In the timeline, messages can display with an optional \"content warning\" feature, which requires readers to click on the content to reveal the rest of the message. Mastodon instances have used this feature to hide spoilers, trigger warnings, and not safe for work (NSFW) content, though some accounts use the feature to hide links and thoughts others might not want to read.\n\nMastodon aggregates messages in local and federated timelines. The local timeline shows messages from users on a singular instance, while the federated timeline shows messages across all participating Mastodon instances. Users can communicate across connected Mastodon instances with usernames similar in format to full email addresses.\n\nIn early 2017, journalists distinguished Mastodon from Twitter for its approach to combating harassment, one of Twitter's largest issues. Mastodon uses community-based moderation, in which each instance can limit, or filter out undesirable types of content. For example, the flagship instance, Mastodon.social, bans content that is illegal in Germany or France, including Nazi symbolism, Holocaust denial and discrimination. Several other instances do this too. Instances can also choose to limit, or filter out messages with disparaging content. Mastodon's founder Eugen Rochko believes that small, close communities would police toxic behavior more effectively than a large company's small safety team. Users can also block and report others to administrators, much like on Twitter.\nIn September 2018, with the release of version 2.5, that features redesigned public profile pages, Mastodon marked its 100th release.. Then, at the end of October, Mastodon 2.6 came out, introducing the possibilities of verified profiles and live, in-stream link previews for images and videos.\n\nMastodon is written as open source, web-based software for federated microblogging, which anybody can contribute code to, and which anyone can run on their own server infrastructure, if they wish, or join servers run by other people within the fediverse network. Its server-side technology is Ruby on Rails, and its front end is written in JavaScript (React.js and Redux). The service is interoperable with the federated social network GNU social and other OStatus platforms. Since the 1.6 release, it is also compatible with ActivityPub.\n\nApps (mobile, desktop or alternative web clients) interacting with the Mastodon API are available for a range of systems, including Android, iOS, SailfishOS and Windows Mobile.\n\nWhile Mastodon was first released in October 2016, the service began to expand in late March and early April 2017. \"The Verge\" wrote that the community at this time was small and that it had yet to attract the personalities that keep users at Twitter. In November 2017 artists, writers and entrepreneurs such as Chuck Wendig, John Scalzi, Melanie Gillman and later John O'Nolan joined in, while Mastodon had reached 1 million accounts on December 1, 2017.\n\n\n"}

He is famous for \"Tafsir al-Mizan\", a twenty-seven-volume work of Quranic exegesis, which he worked on from 1954 until 1972.\nHe is commonly known as Allameh Tabataba'i and the Allameh Tabataba'i University in Tehran is named after him.\n\nHe received his earlier education in his native Tabriz city, mastering the elements of Arabic and the religious sciences. and at about the age of twenty set out for the great Shiite university of Najaf to continue more advanced studies. he studied at Najaf, under masters such as Mirza 'Ali Qadhi (in gnosis), Mirza Muhammad Husain Na'ini, Sheykh Muhammad Hossein Qaravi Esfahani (in Fiqh and Jurisprudence), Sayyid Abu'l-Qasim Khwansari (in Mathematics), as well as studying the standard texts of Avicenna's \"Shifa\", the \"Asfar\" of Sadr al-Din Shirazi, and the \"Tamhid al-qawa'id\" of Ibn Turkah. Along with Sayyid Husayn Badkuba'i, he was a student of two of the most famous masters of the time, Sayyid Abu'l-Hasan Jilwah and Aqa 'Ali Mudarris Zunuzi.\n\nIn his later years he would often hold study sessions with Henry Corbin and Seyyed Hossein Nasr, in which not only the classical texts of divine wisdom and gnosis were discussed, but also a whole cycle of what Nasr calls \"comparative gnosis\", in which in each session the sacred texts of one of the major religions, containing mystical and gnostic teachings, such as the Upanishads, Tao Te Ching, the Gospel of John, were discussed and compared with Sufism and Islamic gnostic doctrines in general.\n\nTabataba'i, was a philosopher, a prolific writer, and an inspiring teacher to his students who devoted much of his life to Islamic studies. Many of his students were among the ideological founders of the Islamic Republic of Iran, namely Murtaza Motahhari, Muhammad Beheshti, and Martyr Mofatteh. Others like Hossein Nasr and Hasanzadeh Amuli remained and continued their studies in the intellectual non-political sphere.\n\nIt was in Najaf where Tabataba'i developed his major contributions in the fields of \"Tafsir\" (interpretation), philosophy, and history of the Shi'a faith. In philosophy the most important of his works is \"Usul-i falsafeh va ravesh-e-realism\" (The Principles of Philosophy and the Method of Realism), which has been published in five volumes with explanatory notes and the commentary of Morteza Motahhari. If Ayatollah Haeri is considered the reviver of Qom's hawza in an organizational sense, Tabataba'i's contributions to the field of tafsir, philosophy and mysticism represent the intellectual revitalization of the hawza with lasting implications for the curriculum.\n\nHis other major philosophical work is a voluminous commentary of \"Asfār al-'arba'eh\", the magnum opus of Mulla Sadra who was the last of the great Persian (Iranian) Muslim thinkers of the medieval age. Apart from these he also wrote extensively on philosophical topics. His humanist approach is underlined by his three books on: the nature of man - before the world, in this world, and after this world. His philosophy is focused upon the sociological treatment of human problems. His two other works, \"Bidāyat al-hikmah\" and \"Nihāyat al-hikmah\", are considered among works of high order in Islamic philosophy.\n\nSeveral treatises on the doctrines and history of the Shi'a remain from him as well. One of these comprises his clarifications and expositions about Shi'a faith in reply to the questions posed by the famous French orientalist Henry Corbin. Another of his books on this topic \"Shi'ah dar Islam\" was translated into English by Seyyed Hossein Nasr under the title \"Shi'a Islam\", with the help of William Chittick as a project of Colgate University. These books are claimed to serve as an excellent conduit by which popular misconceptions about the Shi'a faith may be removed further paving the way for a better ecumenical understanding amongst the various Muslim schools of thought.\n\nHis written books number forty-four titles overall; three of which are collections of his articles on various aspects of Islam and the Qur'an.\n\n\nAllameh Tabataba'i was also an accomplished poet. He composed his poetry mainly in Persian, but occasionally in Arabic as well. He was also the author of numerous articles and essays.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "95170", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=95170", "title": "Pragmatism", "text": "Pragmatism\n\nPragmatism is a philosophical tradition that began in the United States around 1870. Its origins are often attributed to the philosophers William James, John Dewey, and Charles Sanders Peirce. Peirce later described it in his pragmatic maxim: \"Consider the practical effects of the objects of your conception. Then, your conception of those effects is the whole of your conception of the object.\"\n\nPragmatism considers thought as an instrument or tool for prediction, problem solving and action, and rejects the idea that the function of thought is to describe, represent, or mirror reality. Pragmatists contend that most philosophical topics—such as the nature of knowledge, language, concepts, meaning, belief, and science—are all best viewed in terms of their practical uses and successes. The philosophy of pragmatism \"emphasizes the practical application of ideas by acting on them to actually test them in human experiences\". Pragmatism focuses on a \"changing universe rather than an unchanging one as the Idealists, Realists and Thomists had claimed\".\n\nPragmatism as a philosophical movement began in the United States in the 1870s. Charles Sanders Peirce (and his Pragmatic Maxim) is given credit for its development, \nalong with later twentieth century contributors, William James and John Dewey. Its direction was determined by The Metaphysical Club members Charles Sanders Peirce, William James, and Chauncey Wright, as well as John Dewey and George Herbert Mead.\n\nThe first use in print of the name \"pragmatism\" was in 1898 by James, who credited Peirce with coining the term during the early 1870s. James regarded Peirce's \"Illustrations of the Logic of Science\" series (including \"\" (1877), and especially \"\" (1878)) as the foundation of pragmatism. Peirce in turn wrote in 1906 that Nicholas St. John Green had been instrumental by emphasizing the importance of applying Alexander Bain's definition of belief, which was \"that upon which a man is prepared to act\". Peirce wrote that \"from this definition, pragmatism is scarce more than a corollary; so that I am disposed to think of him as the grandfather of pragmatism\". John Shook has said, \"Chauncey Wright also deserves considerable credit, for as both Peirce and James recall, it was Wright who demanded a phenomenalist and fallibilist empiricism as an alternative to rationalistic speculation.\"\n\nPeirce developed the idea that inquiry depends on real doubt, not mere verbal or hyperbolic doubt, and said, in order to understand a conception in a fruitful way, \"Consider the practical effects of the objects of your conception. Then, your conception of those effects is the whole of your conception of the object\", which he later called the pragmatic maxim. It equates any conception of an object to the general extent of the conceivable implications for informed practice of that object's effects. This is the heart of his pragmatism as a method of experimentational mental reflection arriving at conceptions in terms of conceivable confirmatory and disconfirmatory circumstances—a method hospitable to the generation of explanatory hypotheses, and conducive to the employment and improvement of verification. Typical of Peirce is his concern with inference to explanatory hypotheses as outside the usual foundational alternative between deductivist rationalism and inductivist empiricism, although he was a mathematical logician and a founder of statistics.\n\nPeirce lectured and further wrote on pragmatism to make clear his own interpretation. While framing a conception's meaning in terms of conceivable tests, Peirce emphasized that, since a conception is general, its meaning, its intellectual purport, equates to its acceptance's implications for general practice, rather than to any definite set of real effects (or test results); a conception's clarified meaning points toward its conceivable verifications, but the outcomes are not meanings, but individual upshots. Peirce in 1905 coined the new name pragmaticism \"for the precise purpose of expressing the original definition\", saying that \"all went happily\" with James's and Schiller's variant uses of the old name \"pragmatism\" and that he nonetheless coined the new name because of the old name's growing use in \"literary journals, where it gets abused\". Yet in a 1906 manuscript he cited as causes his differences with James and Schiller. and, in a 1908 publication, his differences with James as well as literary author Giovanni Papini. Peirce in any case regarded his views that truth is immutable and infinity is real, as being opposed by the other pragmatists, but he remained allied with them on other issues.\n\nPragmatism enjoyed renewed attention after Willard Van Orman Quine and Wilfrid Sellars used a revised pragmatism to criticize logical positivism in the 1960s. Inspired by the work of Quine and Sellars, a brand of pragmatism known sometimes as neopragmatism gained influence through Richard Rorty, the most influential of the late twentieth century pragmatists along with Hilary Putnam and Robert Brandom. Contemporary pragmatism may be broadly divided into a strict analytic tradition and a \"neo-classical\" pragmatism (such as Susan Haack) that adheres to the work of Peirce, James, and Dewey.\n\nInspiration for various pragmatists included:\n\nA few of the various but often interrelated positions characteristic of philosophers working from a pragmatist approach include:\n\n\nDewey, in \"The Quest For Certainty\", criticized what he called \"the philosophical fallacy\":- philosophers often take categories (such as the mental and the physical) for granted because they don't realize that these are merely nominal concepts that were invented to help solve specific problems. This causes metaphysical and conceptual confusion. Various examples are the \"ultimate Being\" of Hegelian philosophers, the belief in a \"realm of value\", the idea that logic, because it is an abstraction from concrete thought, has nothing to do with the act of concrete thinking, and so on. David L. Hildebrand sums up the problem: \"Perceptual inattention to the specific functions comprising inquiry led realists and idealists alike to formulate accounts of knowledge that project the products of extensive abstraction back onto experience.\" (Hildebrand 2003)\n\nFrom the outset, pragmatists wanted to reform philosophy and bring it more in line with the scientific method as they understood it. They argued that idealist and realist philosophy had a tendency to present human knowledge as something beyond what science could grasp. They held that these philosophies then resorted either to a phenomenology inspired by Kant or to correspondence theories of knowledge and truth. Pragmatists criticized the former for its a priorism, and the latter because it takes correspondence as an unanalyzable fact. Pragmatism instead tries to explain the relation between \"knower\" and \"known\".\n\nIn 1868, C.S. Peirce argued that there is no power of \"intuition\" in the sense of a cognition unconditioned by inference, and no power of introspection, intuitive or otherwise, and that awareness of an internal world is by hypothetical inference from external facts. Introspection and intuition were staple philosophical tools at least since Descartes. He argued that there is no absolutely first cognition in a cognitive process; such a process has its beginning but can always be analyzed into finer cognitive stages. That which we call introspection does not give privileged access to knowledge about the mind—the self is a concept that is derived from our interaction with the external world and not the other way around (De Waal 2005, pp. 7–10). At the same time he held persistently that pragmatism and epistemology in general could not be derived from principles of psychology understood as a special science: what we \"do\" think is too different from what we \"should\" think; in his \"Illustrations of the Logic of Science\" series, Peirce formulated both pragmatism and principles of statistics as aspects of scientific method in general. This is an important point of disagreement with most other pragmatists, who advocate a more thorough naturalism and psychologism.\n\nRichard Rorty expanded on these and other arguments in \"Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature\" in which he criticized attempts by many philosophers of science to carve out a space for epistemology that is entirely unrelated to—and sometimes thought of as superior to—the empirical sciences. W.V. Quine, instrumental in bringing naturalized epistemology back into favor with his essay \"Epistemology Naturalized\" (Quine 1969), also criticized \"traditional\" epistemology and its \"Cartesian dream\" of absolute certainty. The dream, he argued, was impossible in practice as well as misguided in theory, because it separates epistemology from scientific inquiry.\n\nHilary Putnam has suggested that the reconciliation of anti-skepticism and fallibilism is the central goal of American pragmatism. Although all human knowledge is partial, with no ability to take a \"God's-eye-view,\" this does not necessitate a globalized skeptical attitude, a radical philosophical skepticism (as distinguished from that which is called scientific skepticism). Peirce insisted that (1) in reasoning, there is the presupposition, and at least the hope, that truth and the real are discoverable and \"would\" be discovered, sooner or later but still inevitably, by investigation taken far enough, and (2) contrary to Descartes' famous and influential methodology in the \"Meditations on First Philosophy\", doubt cannot be feigned or created by verbal \"fiat\" to motivate fruitful inquiry, and much less can philosophy begin in universal doubt. Doubt, like belief, requires justification. Genuine doubt irritates and inhibits, in the sense that belief is that upon which one is prepared to act. It arises from confrontation with some specific recalcitrant matter of fact (which Dewey called a \"situation\"), which unsettles our belief in some specific proposition. Inquiry is then the rationally self-controlled process of attempting to return to a settled state of belief about the matter. Note that anti-skepticism is a reaction to modern academic skepticism in the wake of Descartes. The pragmatist insistence that all knowledge is tentative is quite congenial to the older skeptical tradition.\n\nPragmatism was not the first to apply evolution to theories of knowledge: Schopenhauer advocated a \"biological idealism\" as what's useful to an organism to believe might differ wildly from what is true. Here knowledge and action are portrayed as two separate spheres with an absolute or transcendental truth above and beyond any sort of inquiry organisms used to cope with life. Pragmatism challenges this idealism by providing an \"ecological\" account of knowledge: inquiry is how organisms can get a grip on their environment. \"Real\" and \"true\" are functional labels in inquiry and cannot be understood outside of this context. It is not \"realist\" in a traditionally robust sense of realism (what Hilary Putnam would later call metaphysical realism), but it is realist in how it acknowledges an external world which must be dealt with.\n\nMany of James' best-turned phrases—\"truth's cash value\" (James 1907, p. 200) and \"the true is only the expedient in our way of thinking\" (James 1907, p. 222)—were taken out of context and caricatured in contemporary literature as representing the view where any idea with practical utility is true. William James wrote:\n\nIn reality, James asserts, the theory is a great deal more subtle. (See Dewey 1910 for a \"FAQ.\")\n\nThe role of belief in representing reality is widely debated in pragmatism. Is a belief valid when it represents reality? \"Copying is one (and only one) genuine mode of knowing,\" (James 1907, p. 91). Are beliefs dispositions which qualify as true or false depending on how helpful they prove in inquiry and in action? Is it only in the struggle of intelligent organisms with the surrounding environment that beliefs acquire meaning? Does a belief only become true when it succeeds in this struggle? In Pragmatism nothing practical or useful is held to be necessarily true, nor is anything which helps to survive merely in the short term. For example, to believe my cheating spouse is faithful may help me feel better now, but it is certainly not useful from a more long-term perspective because it doesn't accord with the facts (and is therefore not true).\n\nWhile pragmatism started out simply as a criterion of meaning, it quickly expanded to become a full-fledged epistemology with wide-ranging implications for the entire philosophical field. Pragmatists who work in these fields share a common inspiration, but their work is diverse and there are no received views.\n\nIn the philosophy of science, instrumentalism is the view that concepts and theories are merely useful instruments and progress in science cannot be couched in terms of concepts and theories somehow mirroring reality. Instrumentalist philosophers often define scientific progress as nothing more than an improvement in explaining and predicting phenomena. Instrumentalism does not state that truth does not matter, but rather provides a specific answer to the question of what truth and falsity mean and how they function in science.\n\nOne of C. I. Lewis' main arguments in \"Mind and the World Order: Outline of a Theory of Knowledge\" (1929) was that science does not merely provide a copy of reality but must work with conceptual systems and that those are chosen for pragmatic reasons, that is, because they aid inquiry. Lewis' own development of multiple modal logics is a case in point. Lewis is sometimes called a proponent of conceptual pragmatism because of this.\n\nAnother development is the cooperation of logical positivism and pragmatism in the works of Charles W. Morris and Rudolf Carnap. The influence of pragmatism on these writers is mostly limited to the incorporation of the pragmatic maxim into their epistemology. Pragmatists with a broader conception of the movement do not often refer to them.\n\nW. V. Quine's paper \"Two Dogmas of Empiricism\", published 1951, is one of the most celebrated papers of twentieth-century philosophy in the analytic tradition. The paper is an attack on two central tenets of the logical positivists' philosophy. One is the distinction between analytic statements (tautologies and contradictions) whose truth (or falsehood) is a function of the meanings of the words in the statement ('all bachelors are unmarried'), and synthetic statements, whose truth (or falsehood) is a function of (contingent) states of affairs. The other is reductionism, the theory that each meaningful statement gets its meaning from some logical construction of terms which refers exclusively to immediate experience. Quine's argument brings to mind Peirce's insistence that axioms are not a priori truths but synthetic statements.\n\nLater in his life Schiller became famous for his attacks on logic in his textbook, \"Formal Logic\". By then, Schiller's pragmatism had become the nearest of any of the classical pragmatists to an ordinary language philosophy. Schiller sought to undermine the very possibility of formal logic, by showing that words only had meaning when used in context. The least famous of Schiller's main works was the constructive sequel to his destructive book \"Formal Logic\". In this sequel, \"Logic for Use\", Schiller attempted to construct a new logic to replace the formal logic that he had criticized in \"Formal Logic\". What he offers is something philosophers would recognize today as a logic covering the context of discovery and the hypothetico-deductive method.\n\nWhereas F. C. S. Schiller dismissed the possibility of formal logic, most pragmatists are critical rather of its pretension to ultimate validity and see logic as one logical tool among others—or perhaps, considering the multitude of formal logics, one \"set\" of tools among others. This is the view of C. I. Lewis. C. S. Peirce developed multiple methods for doing formal logic.\n\nStephen Toulmin's \"The Uses of Argument\" inspired scholars in informal logic and rhetoric studies (although it is an epistemological work).\n\nJames and Dewey were empirical thinkers in the most straightforward fashion: experience is the ultimate test and experience is what needs to be explained. They were dissatisfied with ordinary empiricism because in the tradition dating from Hume, empiricists had a tendency to think of experience as nothing more than individual sensations. To the pragmatists, this went against the spirit of empiricism: we should try to explain all that is given in experience including connections and meaning, instead of explaining them away and positing sense data as the ultimate reality. Radical empiricism, or Immediate Empiricism in Dewey's words, wants to give a place to meaning and value instead of explaining them away as subjective additions to a world of whizzing atoms.\nWilliam James gives an interesting example of this philosophical shortcoming:\nF. C. S. Schiller's first book, \"Riddles of the Sphinx\", was published before he became aware of the growing pragmatist movement taking place in America. In it, Schiller argues for a middle ground between materialism and absolute metaphysics. These opposites are comparable to what William James called tough-minded empiricism and tender-minded rationalism. Schiller contends on the one hand that mechanistic naturalism cannot make sense of the \"higher\" aspects of our world. These include freewill, consciousness, purpose, universals and some would add God. On the other hand, abstract metaphysics cannot make sense of the \"lower\" aspects of our world (e.g. the imperfect, change, physicality). While Schiller is vague about the exact sort of middle ground he is trying to establish, he suggests that metaphysics is a tool that can aid inquiry, but that it is valuable only insofar as it does help in explanation.\n\nIn the second half of the twentieth century, Stephen Toulmin argued that the need to distinguish between reality and appearance only arises within an explanatory scheme and therefore that there is no point in asking what \"ultimate reality\" consists of. More recently, a similar idea has been suggested by the postanalytic philosopher Daniel Dennett, who argues that anyone who wants to understand the world has to acknowledge both the \"syntactical\" aspects of reality (i.e., whizzing atoms) and its emergent or \"semantic\" properties (i.e., meaning and value).\n\nRadical Empiricism gives interesting answers to questions about the limits of science if there are any, the nature of meaning and value and the workability of reductionism. These questions feature prominently in current debates about the relationship between religion and science, where it is often assumed—most pragmatists would disagree—that science degrades everything that is meaningful into \"merely\" physical phenomena.\n\nBoth John Dewey in \"Experience and Nature\" (1929) and half a century later Richard Rorty in his \"Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature\" (1979) argued that much of the debate about the relation of the mind to the body results from conceptual confusions. They argue instead that there is no need to posit the mind or mindstuff as an ontological category.\n\nPragmatists disagree over whether philosophers ought to adopt a quietist or a naturalist stance toward the mind-body problem. The former (Rorty among them) want to do away with the problem because they believe it's a pseudo-problem, whereas the latter believe that it is a meaningful empirical question.\n\nPragmatism sees no fundamental difference between practical and theoretical reason, nor any ontological difference between facts and values. Both facts and values have cognitive content: knowledge is what we should believe; values are hypotheses about what is good in action. Pragmatist ethics is broadly humanist because it sees no ultimate test of morality beyond what matters for us as humans. Good values are those for which we have good reasons, viz. the Good Reasons approach. The pragmatist formulation pre-dates those of other philosophers who have stressed important similarities between values and facts such as Jerome Schneewind and John Searle.\nWilliam James' contribution to ethics, as laid out in his essay \"The Will to Believe\" has often been misunderstood as a plea for relativism or irrationality. On its own terms it argues that ethics always involves a certain degree of trust or faith and that we cannot always wait for adequate proof when making moral decisions.\nOf the classical pragmatists, John Dewey wrote most extensively about morality and democracy. (Edel 1993) In his classic article \"Three Independent Factors in Morals\" (Dewey 1930), he tried to integrate three basic philosophical perspectives on morality: the right, the virtuous and the good. He held that while all three provide meaningful ways to think about moral questions, the possibility of conflict among the three elements cannot always be easily solved. (Anderson, SEP)\n\nDewey also criticized the dichotomy between means and ends which he saw as responsible for the degradation of our everyday working lives and education, both conceived as merely a means to an end. He stressed the need for meaningful labor and a conception of education that viewed it not as a preparation for life but as life itself. (Dewey 2004 [1910] ch. 7; Dewey 1997 [1938], p. 47)\n\nDewey was opposed to other ethical philosophies of his time, notably the emotivism of Alfred Ayer. Dewey envisioned the possibility of ethics as an experimental discipline, and thought values could best be characterized not as feelings or imperatives, but as hypotheses about what actions will lead to satisfactory results or what he termed \"consummatory experience\". A further implication of this view is that ethics is a fallible undertaking, since human beings are frequently unable to know what would satisfy them.\n\nDuring the late 1900s and first decade of 2000, pragmatism was embraced by many in the field of bioethics led by the philosophers John Lachs and his student Glenn McGee, whose 1997 book \"'The Perfect Baby: A Pragmatic Approach to Genetic Engineering'\" (see designer baby) garnered praise from within classical American philosophy and criticism from bioethics for its development of a theory of pragmatic bioethics and its rejection of the principalism theory then in vogue in medical ethics. An anthology published by The MIT Press, \"'Pragmatic Bioethics'\" included the responses of philosophers to that debate, including Micah Hester, Griffin Trotter and others many of whom developed their own theories based on the work of Dewey, Peirce, Royce and others. Lachs himself developed several applications of pragmatism to bioethics independent of but extending from the work of Dewey and James.\n\nA recent pragmatist contribution to meta-ethics is Todd Lekan's \"Making Morality\" (Lekan 2003). Lekan argues that morality is a fallible but rational practice and that it has traditionally been misconceived as based on theory or principles. Instead, he argues, theory and rules arise as tools to make practice more intelligent.\n\nJohn Dewey's \"Art as Experience\", based on the William James lectures he delivered at Harvard, was an attempt to show the integrity of art, culture and everyday experience (\"IEP\"). Art, for Dewey, is or should be a part of everyone's creative lives and not just the privilege of a select group of artists. He also emphasizes that the audience is more than a passive recipient. Dewey's treatment of art was a move away from the transcendental approach to aesthetics in the wake of Immanuel Kant who emphasized the unique character of art and the disinterested nature of aesthetic appreciation. A notable contemporary pragmatist aesthetician is Joseph Margolis. He defines a work of art as \"a physically embodied, culturally emergent entity\", a human \"utterance\" that isn't an ontological quirk but in line with other human activity and culture in general. He emphasizes that works of art are complex and difficult to fathom, and that no determinate interpretation can be given.\n\nBoth Dewey and James investigated the role that religion can still play in contemporary society, the former in \"A Common Faith\" and the latter in \"The Varieties of Religious Experience\".\n\nFrom a general point of view, for William James, something is true \"only insofar\" as it works. Thus, the statement, for example, that prayer is heard may work on a psychological level but (a) may not help to bring about the things you pray for (b) may be better explained by referring to its soothing effect than by claiming prayers are heard. As such, pragmatism is not antithetical to religion but it is not an apologetic for faith either. James' metaphysical position however, leaves open the possibility that the ontological claims of religions may be true. As he observed in the end of the Varieties, his position does not amount to a denial of the existence of transcendent realities. Quite the contrary, he argued for the legitimate epistemic right to believe in such realities, since such beliefs do make a difference in an individual's life and refer to claims that cannot be verified or falsified either on intellectual or common sensorial grounds.\n\nJoseph Margolis, in \"Historied Thought, Constructed World\" (California, 1995), makes a distinction between \"existence\" and \"reality\". He suggests using the term \"exists\" only for those things which adequately exhibit Peirce's \"Secondness\": things which offer brute physical resistance to our movements. In this way, such things which affect us, like numbers, may be said to be \"real\", although they do not \"exist\". Margolis suggests that God, in such a linguistic usage, might very well be \"real\", causing believers to act in such and such a way, but might not \"exist\".\n\nNeopragmatism is a broad contemporary category used for various thinkers that incorporate important insights of, and yet significantly diverge from, the classical pragmatists. This divergence may occur either in their philosophical methodology (many of them are loyal to the analytic tradition) or in conceptual formation. Important analytic pragmatists include early Richard Rorty (who was the first to develop neopragmatist philosophy in his \"Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature\" (1979), Hilary Putnam, W. V. O. Quine, and Donald Davidson. Brazilian social thinker Roberto Unger advocates for a radical pragmatism, one that \"de-naturalizes\" society and culture, and thus insists that we can \"transform the character of our relation to social and cultural worlds we inhabit rather than just to change, little by little, the content of the arrangements and beliefs that comprise them\". Late Rorty and Jürgen Habermas are closer to Continental thought.\n\nNeopragmatist thinkers who are more loyal to classical pragmatism include Sidney Hook and Susan Haack (known for the theory of foundherentism). Many pragmatist ideas (especially those of Peirce) find a natural expression in the decision-theoretic reconstruction of epistemology pursued in the work of Isaac Levi. Nicholas Rescher advocates his version of methodological pragmatism, based on construing pragmatic efficacy not as a replacement for truths but as a means to its evidentiation. Rescher is also a proponent of pragmatic idealism.\n\nNot all pragmatists are easily characterized. With the advent of postanalytic philosophy and the diversification of Anglo-American philosophy, many philosophers were influenced by pragmatist thought without necessarily publicly committing themselves to that philosophical school. Daniel Dennett, a student of Quine's, falls into this category, as does Stephen Toulmin, who arrived at his philosophical position via Wittgenstein, whom he calls \"a pragmatist of a sophisticated kind\" (foreword for Dewey 1929 in the 1988 edition, p. xiii). Another example is Mark Johnson whose embodied philosophy (Lakoff and Johnson 1999) shares its psychologism, direct realism and anti-cartesianism with pragmatism. Conceptual pragmatism is a theory of knowledge originating with the work of the philosopher and logician Clarence Irving Lewis. The epistemology of conceptual pragmatism was first formulated in the 1929 book \"Mind and the World Order: Outline of a Theory of Knowledge\".\n\nFrench pragmatism is attended with theorists such as Bruno Latour, Michel Crozier, Luc Boltanski, and Laurent Thévenot. It is often seen as opposed to structural problems connected to the French critical theory of Pierre Bourdieu.\n\nIn the twentieth century, the movements of logical positivism and ordinary language philosophy have similarities with pragmatism. Like pragmatism, logical positivism provides a verification criterion of meaning that is supposed to rid us of nonsense metaphysics, however, logical positivism doesn't stress action as pragmatism does. The pragmatists rarely used their maxim of meaning to rule out all metaphysics as nonsense. Usually, pragmatism was put forth to correct metaphysical doctrines or to construct empirically verifiable ones rather than to provide a wholesale rejection.\n\nOrdinary language philosophy is closer to pragmatism than other philosophy of language because of its nominalist character and because it takes the broader functioning of language in an environment as its focus instead of investigating abstract relations between \"language\" and \"world\".\n\nPragmatism has ties to process philosophy. Much of their work developed in dialogue with process philosophers such as Henri Bergson and Alfred North Whitehead, who aren't usually considered pragmatists because they differ so much on other points. (Douglas Browning et al. 1998; Rescher, SEP)\n\nBehaviorism and functionalism in psychology and sociology also have ties to pragmatism, which is not surprising considering that James and Dewey were both scholars of psychology and that Mead became a sociologist.\n\nUtilitarianism has some significant parallels to Pragmatism and John Stuart Mill espoused similar values.\n\nPragmatism emphasizes the connection between thought and action. Applied fields like public administration, political science, leadership studies, international relations, conflict resolution, and research methodology have incorporated the tenets of pragmatism in their field. Often this connection is made using Dewey and Addams's expansive notion of democracy.\n\nSymbolic interactionism, a major perspective within sociological social psychology, was derived from pragmatism in the early twentieth century, especially the work of George Herbert Mead and Charles Cooley, as well as that of Peirce and William James.\n\nIncreasing attention is being given to pragmatist epistemology in other branches of the social sciences, which have struggled with divisive debates over the status of social scientific knowledge.\n\nEnthusiasts suggest that pragmatism offers an approach which is both pluralist and practical.\n\nThe classical pragmatism of John Dewey, William James, and Charles Sanders Peirce has influenced research in the field of Public Administration. Scholars claim classical pragmatism had a profound influence on the origin of the field of public administration. At the most basic level, public administrators are responsible for making programs \"work\" in a pluralistic, problems-oriented environment. Public administrators are also responsible for the day-to-day work with citizens. Dewey's participatory democracy can be applied in this environment. Dewey and James' notion of theory as a tool, helps administrators craft theories to resolve policy and administrative problems. Further, the birth of American public administration coincides closely with the period of greatest influence of the classical pragmatists.\n\nWhich pragmatism (classical pragmatism or neo-pragmatism) makes the most sense in public administration has been the source of debate. The debate began when Patricia M. Shields introduced Dewey's notion of the Community of Inquiry. Hugh Miller objected to one element of the community of inquiry (problematic situation, scientific attitude, participatory democracy): scientific attitude. A debate that included responses from a practitioner, an economist, a planner, other public administration scholars, and noted philosophers followed. Miller and Shields also responded.\n\nIn addition, applied scholarship of public administration that assesses charter schools, contracting out or outsourcing, financial management, performance measurement, urban quality of life initiatives, and urban planning in part draws on the ideas of classical pragmatism in the development of the conceptual framework and focus of analysis.\n\nThe health sector's administrators' use of pragmatism has been criticized as incomplete in its pragmatism, however, according to the classical pragmatists, knowledge is always shaped by human interests. The administrator's focus on \"outcomes\" simply advances their own interest, and this focus on outcomes often undermines their citizen's interests, which often are more concerned with process. On the other hand, David Brendel argues that pragmatism's ability to bridge dualisms, focus on practical problems, include multiple perspectives, incorporate participation from interested parties (patient, family, health team), and provisional nature makes it well suited to address problems in this area.\n\nSince the mid 1990s, feminist philosophers have re-discovered classical pragmatism as a source of feminist theories. Works by Seigfried, Duran, Keith, and Whipps explore the historic and philosophic links between feminism and pragmatism. The connection between pragmatism and feminism took so long to be rediscovered because pragmatism itself was eclipsed by logical positivism during the middle decades of the twentieth century. As a result, it was lost from femininist discourse. The very features of pragmatism that led to its decline are the characteristics that feminists now consider its greatest strength. These are \"persistent and early criticisms of positivist interpretations of scientific methodology; disclosure of value dimension of factual claims\"; viewing aesthetics as informing everyday experience; subordinating logical analysis to political, cultural, and social issues; linking the dominant discourses with domination; \"realigning theory with praxis; and resisting the turn to epistemology and instead emphasizing concrete experience\". These feminist philosophers point to Jane Addams as a founder of classical pragmatism. In addition, the ideas of Dewey, Mead, and James are consistent with many feminist tenets. Jane Addams, John Dewey, and George Herbert Mead developed their philosophies as all three became friends, influenced each other, and were engaged in the Hull-House experience and women’s rights causes.\n\nPragmatism values and evaluates the effects of a design on urban transformation, and the effects of a concept or design alters the overall understanding of the concept. Richard Rorty mentions that \"a sea change\" is occurring in recent philosophical thought – \"a change so profound that we may not recognize that it is occurring\". While the world that the movement is rooted in has had many changes, as a frame to perceive the world, pragmatism also has experienced different levels of modifications. Those changes are very relevant to the development of cities and basic themes, such as anti-foundationalism, fallibilism, community as inquirers, questioning the sharp distinction between theory and practice, pluralism, and democracy, of pragmatism may be applied to the urbanism even more strongly.\n\nVincent di Norcia argues that a pragmatic approach is suitable regarding social issues because it requires a conduct that resolves problems as it continuously assesses the practical effects of a project. This secures the interest for the stakeholders and Norcia stresses the importance of social and cognitive pluralism. Social pluralism means that we should recognize all stake holder's interest that are affected by a certain decision, without putting weight on elite political or economic group's interests. As a complement Norcia also stresses cognitive pluralism, which indicates that one should include all kinds of knowledge that are relevant to a problem.\n\nIn the 1908 essay \"The Thirteen Pragmatisms\", Arthur Oncken Lovejoy argues that there's significant ambiguity in the notion of the effects of the \"truth\" of a proposition and those of \"belief\" in a proposition in order to highlight that many pragmatists had failed to recognize that distinction. He identified thirteen different philosophical positions that were each labeled pragmatism.\n\nNeopragmatism as represented by Richard Rorty has been criticized as relativistic both by other neopragmatists such as Susan Haack (Haack 1997) and by many analytic philosophers (Dennett 1998). Rorty's early analytic work, however, differs notably from his later work which some, including Rorty, consider to be closer to literary criticism than to philosophy, and which attracts the brunt of criticism from his detractors.\n\n\nImportant protopragmatists or related thinkers\nFringe figures\n\nImportant introductory primary texts\nNote that this is an \"introductory\" list: some important works are left out and some less monumental works that are excellent introductions are included.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are several peer-reviewed journals dedicated to pragmatism, for example\n\n"}
{"id": "42446", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42446", "title": "Reason", "text": "Reason\n\nReason is the capacity for consciously making sense of things, establishing and verifying facts, applying logic, and changing or justifying practices, institutions, and beliefs based on new or existing information. It is closely associated with such characteristically human activities as philosophy, science, language, mathematics, and art and is normally considered to be a distinguishing ability possessed by humans.\nReason, or an aspect of it, is sometimes referred to as rationality.\n\nReasoning is associated with thinking, cognition, and intellect. The philosophical field of logic studies ways in which humans reason formally through argument. Reasoning may be subdivided into forms of logical reasoning (forms associated with the strict sense): deductive reasoning, inductive reasoning, abductive reasoning; and other modes of reasoning considered more informal, such as intuitive reasoning and verbal reasoning. Along these lines, a distinction is often drawn between logical, discursive reasoning (reason proper), and intuitive reasoning, in which the reasoning process through intuition—however valid—may tend toward the personal and the subjectively opaque. In some social and political settings logical and intuitive modes of reasoning may clash, while in other contexts intuition and formal reason are seen as complementary rather than adversarial. For example, in mathematics, intuition is often necessary for the creative processes involved with arriving at a formal proof, arguably the most difficult of formal reasoning tasks.\n\nReasoning, like habit or intuition, is one of the ways by which thinking moves from one idea to a related idea. For example, reasoning is the means by which rational individuals understand sensory information from their environments, or conceptualize abstract dichotomies such as cause and effect, truth and falsehood, or ideas regarding notions of good or evil. Reasoning, as a part of executive decision making, is also closely identified with the ability to self-consciously change, in terms of goals, beliefs, attitudes, traditions, and institutions, and therefore with the capacity for freedom and self-determination. \n\nIn contrast to the use of \"reason\" as an abstract noun, a reason is a consideration given which either explains or justifies events, phenomena, or behavior. Reasons justify decisions, reasons support explanations of natural phenomena; reasons can be given to explain the actions (conduct) of individuals. \n\nUsing reason, or reasoning, can also be described more plainly as providing good, or the best, reasons. For example, when evaluating a moral decision, \"morality is, at the very least, the effort to guide one's conduct by reason—that is, doing what there are the best reasons for doing—while giving equal [and impartial] weight to the interests of all those affected by what one does.\" \n\nPsychologists and cognitive scientists have attempted to study and explain how people reason, e.g. which cognitive and neural processes are engaged, and how cultural factors affect the inferences that people draw. The field of automated reasoning studies how reasoning may or may not be modeled computationally. Animal psychology considers the question of whether animals other than humans can reason.\n\nIn the English language and other modern European languages, \"reason\", and related words, represent words which have always been used to translate Latin and classical Greek terms in the sense of their philosophical usage.\n\nThe earliest major philosophers to publish in English, such as Francis Bacon, Thomas Hobbes, and John Locke also routinely wrote in Latin and French, and compared their terms to Greek, treating the words \"\"logos\", \"ratio\", \"raison\"\" and \"reason\" as interchangeable. The meaning of the word \"reason\" in senses such as \"human reason\" also overlaps to a large extent with \"rationality\" and the adjective of \"reason\" in philosophical contexts is normally \"rational\", rather than \"reasoned\" or \"reasonable\". Some philosophers, Thomas Hobbes for example, also used the word \"ratiocination\" as a synonym for \"reasoning\".\n\nThe proposal that reason gives humanity a special position in nature has been argued to be a defining characteristic of western philosophy and later western modern science, starting with classical Greece. Philosophy can be described as a way of life based upon reason, and in the other direction reason has been one of the major subjects of philosophical discussion since ancient times. Reason is often said to be reflexive, or \"self-correcting\", and the critique of reason has been a persistent theme in philosophy. It has been defined in different ways, at different times, by different thinkers about human nature.\n\nFor many classical philosophers, nature was understood teleologically, meaning that every type of thing had a definitive purpose which fit within a natural order that was itself understood to have aims. Perhaps starting with Pythagoras or Heraclitus, the cosmos is even said to have reason. Reason, by this account, is not just one characteristic that humans happen to have, and that influences happiness amongst other characteristics. Reason was considered of higher stature than other characteristics of human nature, such as sociability, because it is something humans share with nature itself, linking an apparently immortal part of the human mind with the divine order of the cosmos itself. Within the human mind or soul (\"psyche\"), reason was described by Plato as being the natural monarch which should rule over the other parts, such as spiritedness (\"thumos\") and the passions. Aristotle, Plato's student, defined human beings as rational animals, emphasizing reason as a characteristic of human nature. He \"defined\" the highest human happiness or well being (\"eudaimonia\") as a life which is lived consistently, excellently and completely in accordance with reason.\n\nThe conclusions to be drawn from the discussions of Aristotle and Plato on this matter are amongst the most debated in the history of philosophy. But teleological accounts such as Aristotle's were highly influential for those who attempt to explain reason in a way which is consistent with monotheism and the immortality and divinity of the human soul. For example, in the neo-platonist account of Plotinus, the cosmos has one soul, which is the seat of all reason, and the souls of all individual humans are part of this soul. Reason is for Plotinus both the provider of form to material things, and the light which brings individuals souls back into line with their source. Such neo-Platonist accounts of the rational part of the human soul were standard amongst medieval Islamic philosophers, and under this influence, mainly via Averroes, came to be debated seriously in Europe until well into the renaissance, and they remain important in Iranian philosophy.\n\nThe early modern era was marked by a number of significant changes in the understanding of reason, starting in Europe. One of the most important of these changes involved a change in the metaphysical understanding of human beings. Scientists and philosophers began to question the teleological understanding of the world. Nature was no longer assumed to be human-like, with its own aims or reason, and human nature was no longer assumed to work according to anything other than the same \"laws of nature\" which affect inanimate things. This new understanding eventually displaced the previous world view that derived from a spiritual understanding of the universe.\n\nAccordingly, in the 17th century, René Descartes explicitly rejected the traditional notion of humans as \"rational animals\", suggesting instead that they are nothing more than \"thinking things\" along the lines of other \"things\" in nature. Any grounds of knowledge outside that understanding was, therefore, subject to doubt.\n\nIn his search for a foundation of all possible knowledge, Descartes deliberately decided to throw into doubt \"all\" knowledge – \"except\" that of the mind itself in the process of thinking:\n\nAt this time I admit nothing that is not necessarily true. I am therefore precisely nothing but a thinking thing; that is a mind, or intellect, or understanding, or reason – words of whose meanings I was previously ignorant.\n\nThis eventually became known as epistemological or \"subject-centred\" reason, because it is based on the \"knowing subject\", who perceives the rest of the world and itself as a set of objects to be studied, and successfully mastered by applying the knowledge accumulated through such study. Breaking with tradition and many thinkers after him, Descartes explicitly did not divide the incorporeal soul into parts, such as reason and intellect, describing them as one indivisible incorporeal entity.\n\nA contemporary of Descartes, Thomas Hobbes described reason as a broader version of \"addition and subtraction\" which is not limited to numbers. This understanding of reason is sometimes termed \"calculative\" reason. Similar to Descartes, Hobbes asserted that \"No discourse whatsoever, can end in absolute knowledge of fact, past, or to come\" but that \"sense and memory\" is absolute knowledge.\n\nIn the late 17th century, through the 18th century, John Locke and David Hume developed Descartes' line of thought still further. Hume took it in an especially skeptical direction, proposing that there could be no possibility of deducing relationships of cause and effect, and therefore no knowledge is based on reasoning alone, even if it seems otherwise.\n\nHume famously remarked that, \"We speak not strictly and philosophically when we talk of the combat of passion and of reason. Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions, and can never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey them.\" Hume also took his definition of reason to unorthodox extremes by arguing, unlike his predecessors, that human reason is not qualitatively different from either simply conceiving individual ideas, or from judgments associating two ideas, and that \"reason is nothing but a wonderful and unintelligible instinct in our souls, which carries us along a certain train of ideas, and endows them with particular qualities, according to their particular situations and relations.\" It followed from this that animals have reason, only much less complex than human reason.\n\nIn the 18th century, Immanuel Kant attempted to show that Hume was wrong by demonstrating that a \"transcendental\" self, or \"I\", was a necessary condition of all experience. Therefore, suggested Kant, on the basis of such a self, it is in fact possible to reason both about the conditions and limits of human knowledge. And so long as these limits are respected, reason can be the vehicle of morality, justice, aesthetics, theories of knowledge (epistemology), and understanding.\n\nIn the formulation of Kant, who wrote some of the most influential modern treatises on the subject, the great achievement of reason () is that it is able to exercise a kind of universal law-making. Kant was able therefore to reformulate the basis of moral-practical, theoretical and aesthetic reasoning, on \"universal\" laws.\n\nHere practical reasoning is the self-legislating or self-governing formulation of universal norms, and theoretical reasoning the way humans posit universal laws of nature.\n\nUnder practical reason, the moral autonomy or freedom of human beings depends on their ability to behave according to laws that are given to them by the proper exercise of that reason. This contrasted with earlier forms of morality, which depended on religious understanding and interpretation, or nature for their substance.\n\nAccording to Kant, in a free society each individual must be able to pursue their goals however they see fit, so long as their actions conform to principles given by reason. He formulated such a principle, called the \"categorical imperative\", which would justify an action only if it could be universalized:\n\nAct only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law.\n\nIn contrast to Hume then, Kant insists that reason itself (German \"Vernunft\") has natural ends itself, the solution to the metaphysical problems, especially the discovery of the foundations of morality. Kant claimed that this problem could be solved with his \"transcendental logic\" which unlike normal logic is not just an instrument, which can be used indifferently, as it was for Aristotle, but a theoretical science in its own right and the basis of all the others.\n\nAccording to Jürgen Habermas, the \"substantive unity\" of reason has dissolved in modern times, such that it can no longer answer the question \"How should I live?\" Instead, the unity of reason has to be strictly formal, or \"procedural.\" He thus described reason as a group of three autonomous spheres (on the model of Kant's three critiques):\n\n\nFor Habermas, these three spheres are the domain of experts, and therefore need to be mediated with the \"lifeworld\" by philosophers. In drawing such a picture of reason, Habermas hoped to demonstrate that the substantive unity of reason, which in pre-modern societies had been able to answer questions about the good life, could be made up for by the unity of reason's formalizable procedures.\n\nHamann, Herder, Kant, Hegel, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Foucault, Rorty, and many other philosophers have contributed to a debate about what reason means, or ought to mean. Some, like Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, and Rorty, are skeptical about subject-centred, universal, or instrumental reason, and even skeptical toward reason as a whole. Others, including Hegel, believe that it has obscured the importance of intersubjectivity, or \"spirit\" in human life, and attempt to reconstruct a model of what reason should be.\n\nSome thinkers, e.g. Foucault, believe there are other \"forms\" of reason, neglected but essential to modern life, and to our understanding of what it means to live a life according to reason.\n\nIn the last several decades, a number of proposals have been made to \"re-orient\" this critique of reason, or to recognize the \"other voices\" or \"new departments\" of reason:\n\nFor example, in opposition to subject-centred reason, Habermas has proposed a model of communicative reason that sees it as an essentially cooperative activity, based on the fact of linguistic intersubjectivity.\n\nNikolas Kompridis has proposed a widely encompassing view of reason as \"that ensemble of practices that contributes to the opening and preserving of openness\" in human affairs, and a focus on reason's possibilities for social change.\n\nThe philosopher Charles Taylor, influenced by the 20th century German philosopher Martin Heidegger, has proposed that reason ought to include the faculty of disclosure, which is tied to the way we make sense of things in everyday life, as a new \"department\" of reason.\n\nIn the essay \"What is Enlightenment?\", Michel Foucault proposed a concept of critique based on Kant's distinction between \"private\" and \"public\" uses of reason. This distinction, as suggested, has two dimensions:\n\n\nThe terms \"logic\" or \"logical\" are sometimes used as if they were identical with the term \"reason\" or with the concept of being \"rational\", or sometimes logic is seen as the most pure or the defining form of reason. For example in modern economics, rational choice is assumed to equate to logically consistent choice.\n\nReason and logic can however be thought of as distinct, although logic is one important aspect of reason. Author Douglas Hofstadter, in \"Gödel, Escher, Bach\", characterizes the distinction in this way. Logic is done inside a system while reason is done outside the system by such methods as skipping steps, working backward, drawing diagrams, looking at examples, or seeing what happens if you change the rules of the system.\n\nReason is a type of thought, and the word \"logic\" involves the attempt to describe rules or norms by which reasoning operates, so that orderly reasoning can be taught. The oldest surviving writing to explicitly consider the rules by which reason operates are the works of the Greek philosopher Aristotle, especially \"Prior Analysis\" and \"Posterior Analysis\". Although the Ancient Greeks had no separate word for logic as distinct from language and reason, Aristotle's newly coined word \"syllogism\" (\"syllogismos\") identified logic clearly for the first time as a distinct field of study. When Aristotle referred to \"the logical\" (\"hē logikē\"), he was referring more broadly to rational thought.\n\nAs pointed out by philosophers such as Hobbes, Locke and Hume, some animals are also clearly capable of a type of \"associative thinking\", even to the extent of associating causes and effects. A dog once kicked, can learn how to recognize the warning signs and avoid being kicked in the future, but this does not mean the dog has reason in any strict sense of the word. It also does not mean that humans acting on the basis of experience or habit are using their reason.\n\nHuman reason requires more than being able to associate two ideas, even if those two ideas might be described by a reasoning human as a cause and an effect, perceptions of smoke, for example, and memories of fire. For reason to be involved, the association of smoke and the fire would have to be thought through in a way which can be explained, for example as cause and effect. In the explanation of Locke, for example, reason requires the mental use of a third idea in order to make this comparison by use of syllogism.\n\nMore generally, reason in the strict sense requires the ability to create and manipulate a system of symbols, as well as indices and icons, according to Charles Sanders Peirce, the symbols having only a nominal, though habitual, connection to either smoke or fire. One example of such a system of artificial symbols and signs is language.\n\nThe connection of reason to symbolic thinking has been expressed in different ways by philosophers. Thomas Hobbes described the creation of \"Markes, or Notes of remembrance\" (\"Leviathan\" Ch.4) as \"speech\". He used the word \"speech\" as an English version of the Greek word \"logos\" so that speech did not need to be communicated. When communicated, such speech becomes language, and the marks or notes or remembrance are called \"Signes\" by Hobbes. Going further back, although Aristotle is a source of the idea that only humans have reason (\"logos\"), he does mention that animals with imagination, for whom sense perceptions can persist, come closest to having something like reasoning and \"nous\", and even uses the word \"logos\" in one place to describe the distinctions which animals can perceive in such cases.\n\nReason and imagination rely on similar mental processes. Imagination is not only found in humans. Aristotle, for example, stated that \"phantasia\" (imagination: that which can hold images or \"phantasmata\") and \"phronein\" (a type of thinking that can judge and understand in some sense) also exist in some animals. According to him, both are related to the primary perceptive ability of animals, which gathers the perceptions of different senses and defines the order of the things that are perceived without distinguishing universals, and without deliberation or \"logos\". But this is not yet reason, because human imagination is different.\n\nThe recent modern writings of Terrence Deacon and Merlin Donald, writing about the origin of language, also connect reason connected to not only language, but also mimesis, More specifically they describe the ability to create language as part of an internal modeling of reality specific to humankind. Other results are consciousness, and imagination or fantasy. In contrast, modern proponents of a genetic predisposition to language itself include Noam Chomsky and Steven Pinker, to whom Donald and Deacon can be contrasted.\n\nAs reason is symbolic thinking, and peculiarly human, then this implies that humans have a special ability to maintain a clear consciousness of the distinctness of \"icons\" or images and the real things they represent. Starting with a modern author, Merlin Donald writes\nA dog might perceive the \"meaning\" of a fight that was realistically play-acted by humans, but it could not reconstruct the message or distinguish the representation from its referent (a real fight). [...] Trained apes are able to make this distinction; young children make this distinction early – hence, their effortless distinction between play-acting an event and the event itself\n\nIn classical descriptions, an equivalent description of this mental faculty is \"eikasia\", in the philosophy of Plato. This is the ability to perceive whether a perception is an image of something else, related somehow but not the same, and therefore allows humans to perceive that a dream or memory or a reflection in a mirror is not reality as such. What Klein refers to as \"dianoetic eikasia\" is the \"eikasia\" concerned specifically with thinking and mental images, such as those mental symbols, icons, \"signes\", and marks discussed above as definitive of reason. Explaining reason from this direction: human thinking is special in the way that we often understand visible things as if they were themselves images of our intelligible \"objects of thought\" as \"foundations\" (\"hypothēses\" in Ancient Greek). This thinking (\"dianoia\") is \"...an activity which consists in making the vast and diffuse jungle of the visible world depend on a plurality of more 'precise' \"noēta\".\"\n\nBoth Merlin Donald and the Socratic authors such as Plato and Aristotle emphasize the importance of \"mimesis\", often translated as \"imitation\" or \"representation\". Donald writes\nImitation is found especially in monkeys and apes [... but ...] Mimesis is fundamentally different from imitation and mimicry in that it involves the invention of intentional representations. [...] Mimesis is not absolutely tied to external communication.\n\n\"Mimēsis\" is a concept, now popular again in academic discussion, that was particularly prevalent in Plato's works, and within Aristotle, it is discussed mainly in the \"Poetics\". In Michael Davis's account of the theory of man in this work.\nIt is the distinctive feature of human action, that whenever we choose what we do, we imagine an action for ourselves as though we were inspecting it from the outside. Intentions are nothing more than imagined actions, internalizings of the external. All action is therefore imitation of action; it is poetic...\n\nDonald like Plato (and Aristotle, especially in \"On Memory and Recollection\"), emphasizes the peculiarity in humans of voluntary initiation of a search through one's mental world. The ancient Greek \"anamnēsis\", normally translated as \"recollection\" was opposed to \"mneme\" or \"memory\". Memory, shared with some animals, requires a consciousness not only of what happened in the past, but also \"that\" something happened in the past, which is in other words a kind of \"eikasia\" \"...but nothing except man is able to recollect.\" Recollection is a deliberate effort to search for and recapture something once known. Klein writes that, \"To become aware of our having forgotten something means to begin recollecting.\" Donald calls the same thing \"autocueing\", which he explains as follows: \"Mimetic acts are reproducible on the basis of internal, self-generated cues. This permits voluntary recall of mimetic representations, without the aid of external cues – probably the earliest form of representational \"thinking\".\"\n\nIn a celebrated paper in modern times, the fantasy author and philologist J.R.R. Tolkien wrote in his essay \"On Fairy Stories\" that the terms \"fantasy\" and \"enchantment\" are connected to not only \"...the satisfaction of certain primordial human desires...\" but also \"...the origin of language and of the mind.\"\n\nLooking at logical categorizations of different types of reasoning the traditional main division made in philosophy is between deductive reasoning and inductive reasoning. Formal logic has been described as \"the science of deduction\". The study of inductive reasoning is generally carried out within the field known as informal logic or critical thinking.\n\nA subdivision of Philosophy is Logic. Logic is the study of reasoning. Deduction is a form of reasoning in which a conclusion follows necessarily from the stated premises. A deduction is also the conclusion reached by a deductive reasoning process. One classic example of deductive reasoning is that found in syllogisms like the following:\n\n\nThe reasoning in this argument is valid, because there is no way in which the premises, 1 and 2, could be true and the conclusion, 3, be false.\n\nInduction is a form of inference producing propositions about unobserved objects or types, either specifically or generally, based on previous observation. It is used to ascribe properties or relations to objects or types based on previous observations or experiences, or to formulate general statements or laws based on limited observations of recurring phenomenal patterns.\n\nInductive reasoning contrasts strongly with deductive reasoning in that, even in the best, or strongest, cases of inductive reasoning, the truth of the premises does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion. Instead, the conclusion of an inductive argument follows with some degree of probability. Relatedly, the conclusion of an inductive argument contains more information than is already contained in the premises. Thus, this method of reasoning is ampliative.\n\nA classic example of inductive reasoning comes from the empiricist David Hume:\n\nAbductive reasoning, or argument to the best explanation, is a form of inductive reasoning, since the conclusion in an abductive argument does not follow with certainty from its premises and concerns something unobserved. What distinguishes abduction from the other forms of reasoning is an attempt to favour one conclusion above others, by attempting to falsify alternative explanations or by demonstrating the likelihood of the favoured conclusion, given a set of more or less disputable assumptions. For example, when a patient displays certain symptoms, there might be various possible causes, but one of these is preferred above others as being more probable.\n\nAnalogical reasoning is reasoning from the particular to the particular. It is often used in case-based reasoning, especially legal reasoning. An example follows:\n\n\nAnalogical reasoning can be viewed as a form of inductive reasoning from a single example, but if it is intended as inductive reasoning it is a bad example, because inductive reasoning typically uses a large number of examples to reason from the particular to the general. Analogical reasoning often leads to wrong conclusions. For example:\n\n\nFlawed reasoning in arguments is known as fallacious reasoning. Bad reasoning within arguments can be because it commits either a formal fallacy or an informal fallacy.\n\nFormal fallacies occur when there is a problem with the form, or structure, of the argument. The word \"formal\" refers to this link to the \"form\" of the argument. An argument that contains a formal fallacy will always be invalid.\n\nAn informal fallacy is an error in reasoning that occurs due to a problem with the \"content\", rather than mere \"structure\", of the argument.\n\nPhilosophy is sometimes described as a life of reason, with normal human reason pursued in a more consistent and dedicated way than usual. Two categories of problem concerning reason have long been discussed by philosophers concerning reason, essentially being reasonings about reasoning itself as a human aim, or philosophizing about philosophizing. The first question is concerning whether we can be confident that reason can achieve knowledge of truth better than other ways of trying to achieve such knowledge. The other question is whether a life of reason, a life that aims to be guided by reason, can be expected to achieve a happy life more so than other ways of life (whether such a life of reason results in knowledge or not).\n\nSince classical times a question has remained constant in philosophical debate (which is sometimes seen as a conflict between movements called Platonism and Aristotelianism) concerning the role of reason in confirming truth. People use logic, deduction, and induction, to reach conclusions they think are true. Conclusions reached in this way are considered, according to Aristotle, more certain than sense perceptions on their own. On the other hand, if such reasoned conclusions are only built originally upon a foundation of sense perceptions, then, our most logical conclusions can never be said to be certain because they are built upon the very same fallible perceptions they seek to better.\n\nThis leads to the question of what types of first principles, or starting points of reasoning, are available for someone seeking to come to true conclusions. In Greek, \"first principles\" are \"archai\", \"starting points\", and the faculty used to perceive them is sometimes referred to in Aristotle and Plato as \"nous\" which was close in meaning to \"awareness\" or \"consciousness\".\n\nEmpiricism (sometimes associated with Aristotle but more correctly associated with British philosophers such as John Locke and David Hume, as well as their ancient equivalents such as Democritus) asserts that sensory impressions are the only available starting points for reasoning and attempting to attain truth. This approach always leads to the controversial conclusion that absolute knowledge is not attainable. Idealism, (associated with Plato and his school), claims that there is a \"higher\" reality, from which certain people can directly arrive at truth without needing to rely only upon the senses, and that this higher reality is therefore the primary source of truth.\n\nPhilosophers such as Plato, Aristotle, Al-Farabi, Avicenna, Averroes, Maimonides, Aquinas and Hegel are sometimes said to have argued that reason must be fixed and discoverable—perhaps by dialectic, analysis, or study. In the vision of these thinkers, reason is divine or at least has divine attributes. Such an approach allowed religious philosophers such as Thomas Aquinas and Étienne Gilson to try to show that reason and revelation are compatible. According to Hegel, \"...the only thought which Philosophy brings with it to the contemplation of History, is the simple conception of reason; that reason is the Sovereign of the World; that the history of the world, therefore, presents us with a rational process.\"\n\nSince the 17th century rationalists, reason has often been taken to be a subjective faculty, or rather the unaided ability (pure reason) to form concepts. For Descartes, Spinoza and Leibniz, this was associated with mathematics. Kant attempted to show that pure reason could form concepts (time and space) that are the conditions of experience. Kant made his argument in opposition to Hume, who denied that reason had any role to play in experience.\n\nAfter Plato and Aristotle, western literature often treated reason as being the faculty that trained the passions and appetites. Stoic philosophy by contrast considered all passions undesirable. After the critiques of reason in the early Enlightenment the appetites were rarely discussed or conflated with the passions. Some Enlightenment camps took after the Stoics to say Reason should oppose Passion rather than order it, while others like the Romantics believed that Passion displaces Reason, as in the maxim \"follow your heart\".\n\nReason has been seen as a slave, or judge, of the passions, notably in the work of David Hume, and more recently of Freud. Reasoning which claims that the object of a desire is demanded by logic alone is called \"rationalization\".\n\nRousseau first proposed, in his second \"Discourse\", that reason and political life is not natural and possibly harmful to mankind. He asked what really can be said about what is natural to mankind. What, other than reason and civil society, \"best suits his constitution\"? Rousseau saw \"two principles prior to reason\" in human nature. First we hold an intense interest in our own well-being. Secondly we object to the suffering or death of any sentient being, especially one like ourselves. These two passions lead us to desire more than we could achieve. We become dependent upon each other, and on relationships of authority and obedience. This effectively puts the human race into slavery. Rousseau says that he almost dares to assert that nature does not destine men to be healthy. According to Velkley, \"Rousseau outlines certain programs of rational self-correction, most notably the political legislation of the \"Contrat Social\" and the moral education in \"\". All the same, Rousseau understands such corrections to be only ameliorations of an essentially unsatisfactory condition, that of socially and intellectually corrupted humanity.\"\n\nThis quandary presented by Rousseau led to Kant's new way of justifying reason as freedom to create good and evil. These therefore are not to be blamed on nature or God. In various ways, German Idealism after Kant, and major later figures such Nietzsche, Bergson, Husserl, Scheler, and Heidegger, remain preoccupied with problems coming from the metaphysical demands or \"urges\" of \"reason\". The influence of Rousseau and these later writers is also large upon art and politics. Many writers (such as Nikos Kazantzakis) extol passion and disparage reason. In politics modern nationalism comes from Rousseau's argument that rationalist cosmopolitanism brings man ever further from his natural state.\n\nAnother view on reason and emotion was proposed in the 1994 book titled \"Descartes' Error\" by Antonio Damasio. In it, Damasio presents the \"Somatic Marker Hypothesis\" which states that emotions guide behavior and decision-making. Damasio argues that these somatic markers (known collectively as \"gut feelings\") are \"intuitive signals\" that direct our decision making processes in a certain way that cannot be solved with rationality alone. Damasio further argues that rationality requires emotional input in order to function.\n\nThere are many religious traditions, some of which are explicitly fideist and others of which claim varying degrees of rationalism. Secular critics sometimes accuse all religious adherents of irrationality, since they claim such adherents are guilty of ignoring, suppressing, or forbidding some kinds of reasoning concerning some subjects (such as religious dogmas, moral taboos, etc.). Though the theologies and religions such as classical monotheism typically do not claim to be irrational, there is often a perceived conflict or tension between faith and tradition on the one hand, and reason on the other, as potentially competing sources of wisdom, law and truth.\n\nReligious adherents sometimes respond by arguing that faith and reason can be reconciled, or have different non-overlapping domains, or that critics engage in a similar kind of irrationalism: \nSome commentators have claimed that Western civilization can be almost defined by its serious testing of the limits of tension between \"unaided\" reason and faith in \"revealed\" truths—figuratively summarized as Athens and Jerusalem, respectively. Leo Strauss spoke of a \"Greater West\" that included all areas under the influence of the tension between Greek rationalism and Abrahamic revelation, including the Muslim lands. He was particularly influenced by the great Muslim philosopher Al-Farabi. To consider to what extent Eastern philosophy might have partaken of these important tensions, Strauss thought it best to consider whether dharma or tao may be equivalent to Nature (by which we mean \"physis\" in Greek). According to Strauss the beginning of philosophy involved the \"discovery or invention of nature\" and the \"pre-philosophical equivalent of nature\" was supplied by \"such notions as 'custom' or 'ways, which appear to be \"really universal in all times and places\". The philosophical concept of nature or natures as a way of understanding \"archai\" (first principles of knowledge) brought about a peculiar tension between reasoning on the one hand, and tradition or faith on the other.\n\nAlthough there is this special history of debate concerning reason and faith in the Islamic, Christian and Jewish traditions, the pursuit of reason is sometimes argued to be compatible with the other practice of other religions of a different nature, such as Hinduism, because they do not define their tenets in such an absolute way.\n\nAristotle famously described reason (with language) as a part of human nature, which means that it is best for humans to live \"politically\" meaning in communities of about the size and type of a small city state (\"polis\" in Greek). For example...\nIt is clear, then, that a human being is more of a political [\"politikon\" = of the \"polis\"] animal [\"zōion\"] than is any bee or than any of those animals that live in herds. For nature, as we say, makes nothing in vain, and humans are the only animals who possess reasoned speech [\"logos\"]. Voice, of course, serves to indicate what is painful and pleasant; that is why it is also found in other animals, because their nature has reached the point where they can perceive what is painful and pleasant and express these to each other. But speech [\"logos\"] serves to make plain what is advantageous and harmful and so also what is just and unjust. For it is a peculiarity of humans, in contrast to the other animals, to have perception of good and bad, just and unjust, and the like; and the community in these things makes a household or city [\"polis\"]. [...] By nature, then, the drive for such a community exists in everyone, but the first to set one up is responsible for things of very great goodness. For as humans are the best of all animals when perfected, so they are the worst when divorced from law and right. The reason is that injustice is most difficult to deal with when furnished with weapons, and the weapons a human being has are meant by nature to go along with prudence and virtue, but it is only too possible to turn them to contrary uses. Consequently, if a human being lacks virtue, he is the most unholy and savage thing, and when it comes to sex and food, the worst. But justice is something political [to do with the \"polis\"], for right is the arrangement of the political community, and right is discrimination of what is just. (Aristotle's Politics 1253a 1.2. Peter Simpson's translation, with Greek terms inserted in square brackets.)\n\nThe concept of human nature being fixed in this way, implied, in other words, that we can define what type of community is always best for people. This argument has remained a central argument in all political, ethical and moral thinking since then, and has become especially controversial since firstly Rousseau's Second Discourse, and secondly, the Theory of Evolution. Already in Aristotle there was an awareness that the \"polis\" had not always existed and had needed to be invented or developed by humans themselves. The household came first, and the first villages and cities were just extensions of that, with the first cities being run as if they were still families with Kings acting like fathers.\nFriendship [\"philia\"] seems to prevail [in] man and woman according to nature [\"kata phusin\"]; for people are by nature [\"tēi phusei\"] pairing [\"sunduastikon\"] more than political [\"politikon\" = of the \"polis\"], inasmuch as the household [\"oikos\"] is prior [\"proteron\" = earlier] and more necessary than the \"polis\" and making children is more common [\"koinoteron\"] with the animals. In the other animals, community [\"koinōnia\"] goes no further than this, but people live together [\"sumoikousin\"] not only for the sake of making children, but also for the things for life; for from the start the functions [\"erga\"] are divided, and are different [for] man and woman. Thus they supply each other, putting their own into the common [\"eis to koinon\"]. It is for these [reasons] that both utility [\"chrēsimon\"] and pleasure [\"hēdu\"] seem to be found in this kind of friendship. (Nicomachean Ethics, VIII.12.1162a. Rough literal translation with Greek terms shown in square brackets.)\n\nRousseau in his Second Discourse finally took the shocking step of claiming that this traditional account has things in reverse: with reason, language and rationally organized communities all having developed over a long period of time merely as a result of the fact that some habits of cooperation were found to solve certain types of problems, and that once such cooperation became more important, it forced people to develop increasingly complex cooperation—often only to defend themselves from each other.\n\nIn other words, according to Rousseau, reason, language and rational community did not arise because of any conscious decision or plan by humans or gods, nor because of any pre-existing human nature. As a result, he claimed, living together in rationally organized communities like modern humans is a development with many negative aspects compared to the original state of man as an ape. If anything is specifically human in this theory, it is the flexibility and adaptability of humans. This view of the animal origins of distinctive human characteristics later received support from Charles Darwin's Theory of Evolution.\n\nThe two competing theories concerning the origins of reason are relevant to political and ethical thought because, according to the Aristotelian theory, a best way of living together exists independently of historical circumstances. According to Rousseau, we should even doubt that reason, language and politics are a good thing, as opposed to being simply the best option given the particular course of events that lead to today. Rousseau's theory, that human nature is malleable rather than fixed, is often taken to imply, for example by Karl Marx, a wider range of possible ways of living together than traditionally known.\n\nHowever, while Rousseau's initial impact encouraged bloody revolutions against traditional politics, including both the French Revolution and the Russian Revolution, his own conclusions about the best forms of community seem to have been remarkably classical, in favor of city-states such as Geneva, and rural living.\n\nScientific research into reasoning is carried out within the fields of psychology and cognitive science. Psychologists attempt to determine whether or not people are capable of rational thought in a number of different circumstances.\n\nAssessing how well someone engages in reasoning is the project of determining the extent to which the person is rational or acts rationally. It is a key research question in the psychology of reasoning. Rationality is often divided into its respective theoretical and practical counterparts.\n\nExperimental cognitive psychologists carry out research on reasoning behaviour. Such research may focus, for example, on how people perform on tests of reasoning such as intelligence or IQ tests, or on how well people's reasoning matches ideals set by logic (see, for example, the Wason test). Experiments examine how people make inferences from conditionals e.g., \"If A then B\" and how they make inferences about alternatives, e.g., \"A or else B\". They test whether people can make valid deductions about spatial and temporal relations, e.g., \"A is to the left of B\", or \"A happens after B\", and about quantified assertions, e.g., \"All the A are B\". Experiments investigate how people make inferences about factual situations, hypothetical possibilities, probabilities, and counterfactual situations.\n\nDevelopmental psychologists investigate the development of reasoning from birth to adulthood. Piaget's theory of cognitive development was the first complete theory of reasoning development. Subsequently, several alternative theories were proposed, including the neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development.\n\nThe biological functioning of the brain is studied by neurophysiologists and neuropsychologists. Research in this area includes research into the structure and function of normally functioning brains, and of damaged or otherwise unusual brains. In addition to carrying out research into reasoning, some psychologists, for example, clinical psychologists and psychotherapists work to alter people's reasoning habits when they are unhelpful.\n\nIn artificial intelligence and computer science, scientists study and use automated reasoning for diverse applications including automated theorem proving the formal semantics of programming languages, and formal specification in software engineering.\n\nMeta-reasoning is reasoning about reasoning. In computer science, a system performs meta-reasoning when it is reasoning about its own operation. This requires a programming language capable of reflection, the ability to observe and modify its own structure and behaviour.\n\nA species could benefit greatly from better abilities to reason about, predict and understand the world. French social and cognitive scientists Dan Sperber and Hugo Mercier argue that there could have been other forces driving the evolution of reason. They point out that reasoning is very difficult for humans to do effectively, and that it is hard for individuals to doubt their own beliefs (confirmation bias). Reasoning is most effective when it is done as a collective – as demonstrated by the success of projects like science. They suggest that there are not just individual, but group selection pressures at play. Any group that managed to find ways of reasoning effectively would reap benefits for all its members, increasing their fitness. This could also help explain why humans, according to Sperber, are not optimized to reason effectively alone. Their argumentative theory of reasoning claims that reason may have more to do with winning arguments than with the search for the truth.\n\n\n"}

Traditionally a seven-day event, the festival used to be held under the patronage of the Zamorin of Kozhikode. The prime event of the assembly, is the conferring of the title \"Bhatta\" along with a \"panakizhi\" (purse of money) to selected scholars. The word \"Pattathanam\" is derived from \"Bhattadānam\", which in Malayalam means \"awarding of the Bhatta\". The assembly used to begin on the day of the Revathi asterism, and hence the title \"Revathi Pattathanam\".\n\nThe Calicut Grandhavari (Calicut Chronicles) states that the Zamorin Raja, when he was the \"Naduvazhi\" (chiefetain) of Ernad earlier, confiscated the Tali Siva temple and forcefully removed sixty Saivite Brahmin trustees. Some of the trustees who resisted were executed. Tradition has it that \"Revathi Pattathanam\", a competition for scholars, came to be organized in the 14th century as a Prayaschitta for this Brahmanahatya (murder of Brahmins, described as one of the five great sins in Dharmashastras). Following the take over of the temple, the royal family came to the verge of extinction due to the absence of progeny. This was interpreted as the consequence of the Brahmin curse. To remove this curse, the Saiva saint Kolkunnattu Savankal, a contemporary of poet Raghavananda towards the end of the thirteenth century, advised the Zamorin to institute the competition on the latter's birth asterism of \"Revati\" every year.The competition was conducted annually and gifts were distributed for winners in four fields of knowledge- Tarka, Vyakarana, Mimamsa and Vedanta. More subjects were added at later stages.\n\nThe competition was a major event in south India during the medieval period. Great scholars like the famous Uddanda Shastri from Tamil Nadu, author of the \"Kokila Sandeśa\" and \"Mallika Maruta\", was a prominent participant in the contest for the \"Bhattasthana\" (the seat of a \"bhatta\"). He was ultimately defeated by Kakkashery Bhattripad. This incident is described in the Malayalam classic aithihya kathakal or Aithihyamala\n\nThe competition was conducted for seven days beginning from the asterism of \"Revathi\" in the month of Tulam on two \"mandapas\" (platforms) on either side of the \"vatilmadam\" (entrance hall) of Tali temple. The competition was conducted under the watchfull eyes of judges who were chosen from recipients of the \"sthanam\" in previous years, known as the 'Old Sabha'. The Raja himself was seated at the southern end of the long hall on the southern side. Bhatta Mimamsa, Prabhakara Mimamsa, Vyakarana and Vedanta were represented by lighted lamps on different parts of the platform. The debates were of serious nature and was conducted with high degree of merit and erudition. It is noted in this regard that even the candidature of a great scholar like Melpathur Narayana Bhattathiri, the author of \"Narayaneeyam\" and Prakriya Sarvasvam was rejected by the Old Sabha six times.\n\nThe \"Pattathanam\" starts with an invitation sent to the two important yogams of Brahmin scholars in Kerala belonging to Cheviyannur and Kotamangalam respectively. On the last day, Mangat Achan announce the list of winners prepared by the judges. The Raja would prostrate before the winners to seek their blessing and distributed \"kizhis\" (purses) containing one hundred and one Panam each to one hundred Smartas (one who is proficient in the \"Smritis\").\n\n\n"}

Discussion, argument and analysis are vital parts of scientific temper. Elements of fairness, equality and democracy are built into it. Jawaharlal Nehru was the first to use the phrase in 1946. He later gave a descriptive explanation:\nNehru wrote that the scientific temper goes beyond the domains to which science is conventionally understood to be limited to, and deals also with the consideration of ultimate purposes, beauty, goodness and truth. Nehru also contended that the scientific temper is the opposite of the method of religion, which relies on emotion and intuition and is (mis)applied \"to everything in life, even to those things which are capable of intellectual inquiry and observation.\" While religion tends to close the mind and produce \"intolerance, credulity and superstition, emotionalism and irrationalism\", and \"a temper of a dependent, unfree person\", a scientific temper \"is the temper of a free man\". He also indicated that the scientific temper goes beyond objectivity and fosters creativity and progress. He envisioned that the spread of scientific temper would be accompanied by a shrinking of the domain of religion, and \"the exciting adventure of fresh and never ceasing discoveries, of new panoramas opening out and new ways of living, adding to [life's] fullness and ever making it richer and more complete.\" Nehru states (that) \"It is science alone that can solve the problems of hunger and poverty, of insanitation and illiteracy, of superstition and deadening custom and tradition, of vast resources running to waste, of a rich country inhabited by starving people.\"\n\nThe genesis and development of the idea of the scientific temper is connected to ideas expressed earlier by Charles Darwin when he said, \"[F]reedom of thought is best promoted by the gradual illumination of men's minds, which follows from the advance of science,\" and by Karl Marx when he said, \"Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people. The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is the demand for their real happiness. To call on them to give up their illusions about their condition is to call on them to give up a condition that requires illusions.\"\n\n\"To develop scientific temper, humanism and the spirit of inquiry and reform\" is one of the fundamental duties of the people of the Republic of India, according to the Constitution of India.\n\nThe Government of India, through the National Council for Science and Technology Communication, dedicated the 28 February National Science Day of 2014 to the theme \"Fostering Scientific Temper\" to spread Nehru's vision.\n\nThe National Institute of Science Communication and Information Resources launched the scholarly serial \"Journal of Scientific Temper\" in 2013.\n"}
{"id": "440579", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=440579", "title": "Silence", "text": "Silence\n\nSilence is the absence of ambient audible sound, the emission of sounds of such low intensity that they do not draw attention to themselves, or the state of having ceased to produce sounds; this latter sense can be extended to apply to the cessation or absence of any form of communication, whether through speech or other medium. \n\nSometimes speakers fall silent when they hesitate in searching for a word, or interrupt themselves before correcting themselves. Discourse analysis shows that people use brief silences to mark the boundaries of prosodic units, in turn-taking, or as\nreactive tokens, e.g., as a sign of displeasure, disagreement, embarrassment, desire to think, confusion, and the like. Relatively prolonged intervals of silence can be used in rituals; in some religious disciplines, people maintain silence for protracted periods, or even for the rest of their lives, as an ascetic means of spiritual transformation. \n\nJoseph Jordania has suggested that in social animals (including humans), silence can be a sign of danger. Many social animals produce seemingly haphazard sounds which are known as contact calls. These are a mixture of various sounds, accompanying the group's everyday business (for example, foraging, feeding), and they are used to maintain audio contact with the members of the group. Some social animal species communicate the signal of potential danger by stopping contact calls and freezing, without the use of alarm calls, through silence. Charles Darwin wrote about this in relation with wild horse and cattle. Jordania has further suggested that human humming could have been a contact method that early humans used to avoid silence. According to his suggestion, humans find prolonged silence distressing (suggesting danger to them). This may help explain why lone humans in relative sonic isolation feel a sense of comfort from humming, whistling, talking to themselves, or having the TV or radio on.\n\n\"Silence\" in spirituality is often a metaphor for inner stillness. A silent mind, freed from the onslaught of thoughts and thought patterns, is both a goal and an important step in spiritual development. Such \"inner silence\" is not about the absence of sound; instead, it is understood to bring one in contact with the divine, the ultimate reality, or one's own true self, one's divine nature. Many religious traditions imply the importance of being quiet and still in mind and spirit for transformative and integral spiritual growth to occur. In Christianity, there is the silence of contemplative prayer such as centering prayer and Christian meditation; in Islam, there are the wisdom writings of the Sufis who insist on the importance of finding silence within. In Buddhism, the descriptions of silence and allowing the mind to become silent are implied as a feature of spiritual enlightenment. In Hinduism, including the teachings of Advaita Vedanta and the many paths of yoga, teachers insist on the importance of silence, \"Mauna\", for inner growth. Perkey Avot, the Jewish Sages guide for living, states that, \"Tradition is a safety fence to Torah, tithing a safety fence to wealth, vows a safety fence for abstinence; a safety fence for wisdom ... is silence.\" In some traditions of Quakerism, communal silence is the usual context of worship meetings, in patient expectancy for the divine to speak in the heart and mind. Eckhart Tolle says that silence can be seen either as the absence of noise, or as the space in which sound exists, just as inner stillness can be seen as the absence of thought, or the space in which thoughts are perceived.\n\nA common way to remember a tragic incident and to remember the victims or casualties of such an event is a commemorative moment of silence.\n\nArgumentative silence is the rhetorical practice of saying nothing when an opponent in a debate expects something to be said. Poorly executed, it can be offensive, like refusing to answer a direct question. However, well-timed silence can throw an opponent off and give the debater the upper hand.\n\nAn argument from silence () is an argument based on the assumption that someone's silence on a matter suggests (an informal fallacy) that person's ignorance of the matter. In general, \"ex silentio\" refers to the claim that the absence of something demonstrates the proof of a proposition.\n\nThe right to silence is a legal protection enjoyed by people undergoing police interrogation or trial in certain countries. The law is either explicit or recognized in many legal systems.\n\nThe documentary film \"In Pursuit of Silence\" (2016) portrays the spiritual and physical benefits of silence, as well as the price paid individually and collectively for a noisy world. It is narrated by authors Helen Lees (\"Silence in Schools\"), Pico Iyer (\"The Art of Stillness\"), Susan Cain (\"\"), Maggie Ross (\"Silence: A User’s Guide\"), and George Prochnik (\"In Pursuit of Silence\").\n\nMusic inherently depends on silence, in some form or another, to distinguish other periods of sound and allow dynamics, melodies, and rhythms to have greater impact. For example, most music scores feature \"rests\", which denote periods of silence. In addition, silence in music can be seen as a time for contemplation. The audience feels the effects of the previous notes and melodies, and can intentionally reflect on what they have heard. Silence does not hinder musical excellence but can enhance the sounds of instruments and vocals within a given musical composition.\n\nIn his book \"Sound and Silence\" (1970), the composer John Paynter says, \"the dramatic effect of silence has long been appreciated by composers.\" He gives as an example \"the general pause in the middle of the chorus ‘Have lightnings and thunders …’ in Bach’s \"St. Matthew Passion\"\":\n\nAfter the pause, the music continues to the words: \"Open up the fiery bottomless pit, O hell!\" The silence is intended to communicate a momentary sensation of terror, of staring into unfathomable darkness. Another example of a dramatic silence comes in the \"rest full of tension\" at the climactic ending of the \"Hallelujah\" chorus in Handel’s \"Messiah\":\n\nMusical silences may also convey humour. Haydn's Quartet in E flat, Op. 33 was nicknamed \"The Joke\", because of the comic timing of the pauses at the end of the last movement:\n\nTaruskin (2010, p. 552) says, \"whenever this ending is performed, it takes the audience an extra second or so to recover its wits and realize that the piece is indeed over. The result is an inevitable giggle—the same giggle that overtakes a prestidigitator’s audience when it realizes that it has been ‘had’.\"\n\nBarry Cooper (2011, p.38) writes extensively of Beethoven's many uses of silence for contemplation, for dramatic effect and especially for driving the rhythmic impetus of the music. He cites the start of the second movement of the Ninth Symphony, where the silences contribute to a powerful sense of propulsion: \"The rhythm of bar 1 is incomplete and demands a note at the beginning of bar 2. The substitution of such a note by a whole-bar rest therefore gives the effect of a suppressed sound, as if one were about to speak but then refrains at the last moment. The 'suppressed sound' is then repeated in bar 4, and 'developed' (by being doubled) in bars 7 and 8.\" writes of the \"strange irregularity of rhythm in the sixth bar\" of this movement.\n\nMuch has been said about the harmony of the opening to Wagner's opera \"Tristan und Isolde\", which Taruskin (2010, p.540) calls \"perhaps the most famous, surely the most commented-on, single phrase of music ever written.\" However, Wagner’s strategic use of silences between phrases intensifies the troubled ambiguity of the music: \"The chord that fills the ensuing silence in the listener’s inner ear… is the unstated – indeed never to be stated, and ultimately needless to be stated – tonic of that key.\"\nSome of the most effective musical silences are very short, lasting barely a fraction of a second. In the spirited and energetic finale of his Symphony No. 2, Brahms uses silences at several points to powerfully disrupt the rhythmic momentum that has been building. (See also syncopation.)\n\nDuring the 20th century, composers explored further the expressive potential of silence in their music. The contemplative concluding bars of Anton Webern’s \"Symphony\" (1928) and Stravinsky’s \"Les Noces\" The Wedding, 1923) make telling and atmospheric use of pauses. Eric Walter White (1947, p.74) describes the ending of \"Les Noces\" as follows: \"As the voices cease singing, pools of silence come flooding in between the measured strokes of the bell chord, and the music dies away in a miraculously fresh and radiant close.\"\n\nJohn Paynter (1970, p. 24) vividly conveys how silence contributes to the titanic impact of the third section of Messiaen’s orchestral work \"Et exspecto resurrectionem mortuorum\" (1964):Woodwinds jump, growl and shriek. Silence. Eight solemn bell strokes echo and die. Again silence. Suddenly the brasses blare, and out of the trombones’ awesome processional grows a steady roar … the big gongs the tam-tam beaten in a long and powerful resonance, shattering and echoing across mountains and along valleys. This is music of the high hills, music for vast spaces: ‘The hour is coming when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God’. We can feel the awe and the majesty of the High Alps and the great churches. The instrumental sounds are vast the silences are deep. The words of St John are alive in the music, and through these sounds Messiaen reveals himself and his vision.An extreme example from 1952 is \"4′33″\", an experimental musical work by avant-garde composer John Cage, incorporating ambient sounds not foreseeable by the composer. Though first performed on the piano, the piece was composed for any instrument or instruments and is structured in three movements. The length of each movement is not fixed by the composer, but the total length of the combination of three movements is. The score instructs the performer(s) to remain silent throughout the piece.\n\nThere are telling examples of the use of silence in jazz. A frequently used effect, known as \"stop-time\", places silences at moments where listeners or dancers might expect a strong beat, contributing to the syncopation. Scott Joplin's \"Rag-Time Dance\" (1902) features stop-time silences:\nEarly recordings of the \"Rag Time Dance\" follow Joplin’s instructions as follows: \"To get the desired effect of 'Stop Time', the pianist will please stamp the heel of one foot heavily upon the floor.\" However, later recordings disregard this direction – the regular beat is implied rather than stated and the silences are more palpable. Keith Swanwick (1979, p.70) is enchanted by the \"playfulness and humour\" engendered by the stop-time effects in Jelly Roll Morton's solo piano recording of \"The Crave\" (1939): \"If we listen to this, tapping or clicking along with the beat, we shalt find ourselves surprised by two patches of silence near the end. The beat goes on but the sound stops. The effect is something like being thrown forward when a car stops suddenly. It is the biggest surprise in an engaging piece of music full of little deviations (syncopations) from the repeated beat.\"\n\nOther examples include the closing bars of Louis Armstrong's recording of \"Struttin' with Some Barbecue\" (1928) and the hair's-breadth pause at the end of pianist Bill Evans' solo on Miles Davis' recording of \"On Green Dolphin Street\" (1959). Duke Ellington's \"Madness in Great Ones\", from his Shakespearean Suite \"Such Sweet Thunder\" (1957) conveys the feigned madness of Prince Hamlet through abrupt and unpredictable pauses that interrupt the flow of the music. The reggae band Black Slate had a hit in 1980 with the song \"Amigo\". The instrumental introduction features sudden silences before the voice enters.\n\n\n"}

The term corporate welfare is widely used to describe the bestowal of favorable treatment to particular corporations by the government. One of the most commonly raised forms of criticism are statements that the capitalist political economy toward large corporations allows them to \"privatize profits and socialize losses.\" The argument has been raised and cited on many occasions.\n\nThe phrase may have been first popularized by Michael Harrington's 1962 book \"The Other America\" in which Harrington cited Charles Abrams, well-known authority on housing.\n\nAndrew Young has been cited for calling the United States system “socialism for the rich and free enterprise for the poor”, and Martin Luther King, Jr. frequently used this wording in his speeches. Since at least 1969, Gore Vidal used the expression “free enterprise for the poor and socialism for the rich” to describe the U.S. economic policies, and he used it from the 1980s in his critiques of Reagonomics.\n\nIn winter 2006/2007, in response to criticism about oil imports from Venezuela, that country being under the leadership of Hugo Chávez, the founder and president of Citizens Energy Corporation Joseph P. Kennedy II countered with a critique of the U.S. system which he characterized as “a kind of socialism for the rich and free enterprise for the poor that leaves the most vulnerable out in the cold”. Also Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. has become known for expressing to large audiences that the United States is now a land of “socialism for the rich and brutal capitalism for the poor”.\n\nEconomist Dean Baker expressed similar views in his book \"The Conservative Nanny State: How the Wealthy Use the Government to Stay Rich and Get Richer\", in which he pointed out several different policy areas in which government intervention is essential to preserving and enhancing wealth in the hands of a few.\n\nLinguist Noam Chomsky has criticized the way in which free market principles have been applied. He has argued that the wealthy use free-market rhetoric to justify imposing greater economic risk upon the lower classes, while being insulated from the rigours of the market by the political and economic advantages that such wealth affords. He remarked, \"the free market is socialism for the rich—[free] markets for the poor and state protection for the rich.\" He has stated that the rich and powerful \"want to be able to run the nanny state\" so that \"when they are in trouble the taxpayer will bail them out\", citing \"too big to fail\" as an example.\n\nArguments along a similar line were raised in connection with the financial turmoil in 2008. With regard to the federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Ron Blackwell, chief economist of AFL-CIO, used the expression “Socialism for the rich and capitalism for the poor” to characterize the system. In September 2008, the US Senator from Vermont, Democratic Socialist Bernie Sanders said regarding the bailout of the U.S. financial system: “This is the most extreme example that I can recall of socialism for the rich and free enterprise for the poor”. The same month, economist Nouriel Roubini stated: “It is pathetic that Congress did not consult any of the many professional economists that have presented […] alternative plans that were more fair and efficient and less costly ways to resolve this crisis. This is again a case of privatizing the gains and socializing the losses; a bailout and socialism for the rich, the well-connected and Wall Street”.\n\nFormer U.S. Secretary of Labor Robert Reich adapted this phrase on \"The Daily Show\" on October 16, 2008: \"We have socialism for the rich, and capitalism for everyone else.\"\n\nJournalist John Pilger included the phrase in his speech accepting Australia's human rights award, the Sydney Peace Prize, on 5th November 2009: \"Democracy has become a business plan, with a bottom line for every human activity, every dream, every decency, every hope. The main parliamentary parties are now devoted to the same economic policies - socialism for the rich, capitalism for the poor - and the same foreign policy of servility to endless war. This is not democracy. It is to politics what McDonald's is to food.\"\n\nU.S. Senator Bernie Sanders referenced the phrase during his eight-and-a-half-hour speech on the senate floor on December 10, 2010 against the continuation of Bush-era tax cuts, when speaking on the federal bailout of major financial institutions at a time when small-businesses were being denied loans. \n\n\n"}

{"id": "48407803", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48407803", "title": "Temperament Isolation Theory", "text": "Temperament Isolation Theory\n\nTemperament Isolation Theory, also known as personality bias or personality discrimination, is a recent social science theory that attempts to explain how cultures favor a specific temperament and how they view and interact with those of other or opposite temperaments. The first concepts of the theory were explored by Susan Cain in her book \"\" where she looked at how western cultures, particularly the United States, value extroversion over introversion and how that could possibly make it difficult for introverts to thrive in society. Northern Arizona University professor Jorge Rodriguez III took the idea a step further and viewed how the opposite could be viewed in eastern cultures where introversion is valued over extroversion. These observations and further research led to the concept of \"personality bias\" which suggests certain personalities are favored over others and that these opposing personalities are \"intentionally or unintentionally oppressed or muted.\" The concept of personality bias was later formally formulated into Temperament Isolation Theory. The theory is currently not widely accepted among social scientists, but it is gaining ground thanks to the research of Rodriguez and others.\n\nThe concept of personality bias was explored by Susan Cain in her book \"Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World that Can't Stop Talking,\" released in January, 2012. Cain explored how western cultures, particularly that of the United States, place much value on extroversion. The social structures of the U.S. including the workforce and public education encourage and teach people to be outspoken, engaging and group-minded. Cain refers to this bias as the \"extrovert ideal\" where people are valued for what they say and how they present themselves rather than their character, talents and skills. She also discusses the rise of collaboration and groupthink in the United States and how group work is seen as superior or more effective than individual contribution. Cain argues that the extrovert ideal has made it difficult for introverts to thrive and succeed in the United States.\n\nCain also introduced definitions and parameters for temperament. According to the Cain, temperament (extroversion and introversion) is a person's core personality and influences many of the traits the person develops over his or her lifetime. Temperament is not defined on how social a person is or on whether they are shy or not. Rather, temperament is influenced by sensory sensitivity. Introverts are highly sensitive to outside stimulus and can often be overwhelmed by it. Extroverts are much less sensitive to stimulus and often need more exposure to it in order to feel a response. For example, an introvert may feel overwhelmed at a rock concert because she is sensitive to all the stimuli (music, lights, voices, touch etc.) and she is taking all of it in at once, whereas an extrovert is not sensitive and wants to experience these stimuli even more. Cain also notes that temperament is a spectrum rather a definitive extreme. Some introverts are less sensitive than others and feel more comfortable in social situations and vice versa. People lean more towards introversion or extroversion and, in some cases, fall in the middle (ambivert). Temperament can also be situational in which a single individual may exhibit more extroverted or introverted traits in specific situations. \n\nTemperament as it pertains to eastern cultures is also briefly touched on by Cain. She notes that eastern cultures are the opposite of western cultures in that they tend to value introversion over extroversion. She specifically examined the experiences of Asian-American families. Asian-Americans struggle a lot in American society because their culture and home life encourage introversion, but their social lives outside the home put pressure on them to be extroverted. \n\nSusan Cain and her book \"Quiet\" are credited with starting what is called the \"Quiet Revolution\" which calls for introverts to learn to value and appreciate themselves and use their strengths to find their place in society. The movement is rather small but is nonetheless designed to help introverts cope with inequalities and difficulties they face in an extroverted-dominated society. \n\nSocial Scientist and Associate Professor at Northern Arizona University Jorge Rodriguez III was intrigued by the ideas presented by Cain and began to research them scientifically in 2012. Rodriguez's research found that extroversion is indeed highly valued in the United States and that this value of extroversion often does come at the expense of marginalizing introverts. However, Rodriguez believed this was mostly unintentional and some introverts have been successfully able to bypass the \"personality bias\" with strong, creative ideas and hard work ethic. Regardless, a personality does exist which can lead to the oppression of introverts.\n\nRodriguez took his research a step further and looked how personality bias differs among cultures. While Cain briefly touched on the subject in \"Quiet\", Rodriguez felt further research and observation was needed. Rodriguez found that eastern cultures, particularly that of Hong Kong, China, had a personality bias for introversion. Unlike the U.S., China places more value on character and individual leadership. The good of organization or group, including the family, is much more important than individual desire and need. Being quite is seen as a symbol of wisdom, humility and selflessness. By contrast, extroversion can be viewed as a symbol arrogance and self-interest. Much like how the climate in the U.S. has marginalized introverts, the value of introversion in China has made difficult for extroverts to find respect and success. However, unlike the U.S. where this oppression is mostly unintentional, Rodriguez believes it is more deliberate in China as the culture has a spoken affliction towards extroverts.\n\nRodriguez based much of his research in the concepts and ideas of other social scientific research and theory. In particular, Rodriguez used Muted Group Theory to see if temperaments can be muted/silenced much like other minority groups. While much less common and less extreme than with other minority groups based on sex and race, people of certain temperaments can indeed be muted by the dominant group, intentionally or unintentionally.\n\nNot long after his research into personality bias, Rodriguez began work on the formulation of a formal theory. Using Muted Group Theory as the basis and incorporating the findings and observations of his research, Rodriguez formally introduced Temperament Isolation Theory in his book \"Temperament Isolation: The Study of Personality Bias in Culture\". Rodriguez used the term temperament in his theory to emphasize that it covers \"overall personality\" and not \"individual traits and idiosyncrasies.\" He also wanted to use temperament to emphasize that extroversion and introversion are not a measure of sociability but \"other factors that have the potential to affect how one socializes.\" The term isolation is also used to show that oppression is not always intentional. The theory suggests that certain temperaments, relative to culture, are inherently favored over others and this favoritism can often lead to the muting or oppression of opposite temperaments which can then make living in this culture challenging, impeding their success and acceptance of their beliefs, behaviors and values.\n\nAssumption of Temperament Isolation Theory:\nWhile personality bias is not viewed to be on the same scale as racial discrimination or sexism, Rodriguez argues that it is still a concern because temperament is biologically fixed like race and sex. While people may be able to adjust their behaviors and \"mask\" their true personalities but they cannot change their core temperament. If a person is introverted, they will always be introverted and vice versa. Rodriguez did not formulate Temperament Isolation to be a critical theory, but he acknowledges that it might address social inequality issues.\n\nRodriguez plans to expand on the ideas of Temperament Isolation, particularly as it relates to other cultures. While most cultures can be divided into western and eastern, Rodriguez believes it may be more diverse than that. Rodriguez in particular wants to study Middle Eastern and South American cultures as he feels they don't quite align with the standard western and eastern distinctions. Rodriguez is also interested in researching the possibility of temperaments beyond introversion and extroversion. The idea of ambiversion is of particular interest as ambiverts are supposed to be sensory balanced.\n\nTemperament Isolation Theory is not currently accepted as formal social science theory. Many sociologists feel the theory needs more concrete concepts and empirical data. Rodriguez's research and observations are considered preliminary and many feel there needs to be more measurable results (qualitative and quantitative) to support the theory. In addition to preliminary nature of the theory, some sociologists suggest the idea of personality bias in itself is illogical. Critics feel Cain and Rodriguez are \"over extending\" by trying to suggest that discrimination or oppression of personality is similar to racial discrimination or sexism.\n\nIn addition to Rodriguez's future research plans, other social scientists are exploring the idea of personality bias. Researchers like Janise Hoalburrough and Sean Greeson applied concepts of personality bias to workforce performance and success. Personality bias has also reinvigorated the study of personality and temperament by psychologists. Michelle Chavira recently published an article that explores new research in temperament and included some of Rodriguez's findings. Susan Cain is also continuing her \"Quiet Revolution\" where she attempts to empower introverts and help them find success. \n"}
{"id": "455837", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=455837", "title": "The Prelude", "text": "The Prelude\n\nThe Prelude or, Growth of a Poet's Mind; An Autobiographical Poem is an autobiographical poem in blank verse by the English poet William Wordsworth. Intended as the introduction to the more philosophical poem \"The Recluse,\" which Wordsworth never finished, \"The Prelude\" is an extremely personal work and reveals many details of Wordsworth's life.\n\nWordsworth began \"The Prelude\" in 1798, at the age of 28, and continued to work on it throughout his life. He never gave it a title, but called it the \"Poem (title not yet fixed upon) to Coleridge\" and in his letters to Dorothy Wordsworth referred to it as \"the poem on the growth of my own mind\". The poem was unknown to the general public until the final version was published three months after Wordsworth's death in 1850. Its present title was given to it by his widow Mary. It is widely regarded as Wordsworth's greatest work.\n\nThere are three versions of the poem:\n\n\"The Prelude\" was the product of a lifetime: for the last part of his life Wordsworth had been \"polishing the style and qualifying some of its radical statements about the divine sufficiency of the human mind in its communion with nature\".\n\nThe poem was intended as the prologue to a long three-part epic and philosophical poem, \"The Recluse\". Though Wordsworth planned this project when he was in his late 20s, he went to his grave at 80 years old having written to some completion only \"The Prelude\" and the second part (\"The Excursion\"), and leaving no more than fragments of the rest.\n\nWordsworth initially planned to write this work together with Samuel Taylor Coleridge, their joint intent being to surpass John Milton's \"Paradise Lost\" (\"Table Talk\" II.70–71; IG3). If \"The Recluse\" had been completed, it would have been about three times longer than \"Paradise Lost\" (33,000 lines versus 10,500). Wordsworth often commented in his letters that he was plagued with agony because he had failed to finish the work. In his introduction to the version of 1850 Wordsworth explains that the original idea, inspired by his \"dear friend\" Coleridge, was \"to compose a philosophical Poem, containing views of Man, Nature, and Society, and to be entitled the \"Recluse\"; as having for its principal subject, the sensations and opinions of a poet living in retirement\".\n\nColeridge's inspiration and interest is evident in his letters. For instance, in 1799 he wrote to Wordsworth: \"I am anxiously eager to have you steadily employed on 'The Recluse'... I wish you would write a poem, in blank verse, addressed to those who, in consequence of the complete failure of the French Revolution, have thrown up all hopes of amelioration of mankind, and are sinking into an almost Epicurean selfishness, disguising the same under the soft titles of domestic attachment and contempt for visionary philosophies. It would do great good, and might form a Part of 'The Recluse'.\" (STC to WW, Sept. 1799).\n\nWordsworth pays tribute to Coleridge in his introduction to the edition of 1850: \"work [is] addressed to a dear friend, most distinguished for his knowledge and genius, and to whom the author's intellect is deeply indebted.\"\n\nAccording to Monique R. Morgan's \"Narrative Means to Lyric Ends in Wordsworth's \"Prelude\",\" \"Much of the poem consists of Wordsworth's interactions with nature that 'assure[d] him of his poetic mission.' The goal of the poem is to demonstrate his fitness to produce great poetry, and \"The Prelude\" itself becomes evidence of that fitness.\" It traces the growth of the poet's mind by stressing the mutual consciousness and spiritual communion between the world of nature and man.\n\n\nThe work is a poetic reflection on Wordsworth's own sense of his poetic vocation as it developed over the course of his life. Its focus and mood present a sharp and fundamental fall away from the neoclassical and into the Romantic. Milton, who is mentioned by name in line 181 of Book One, rewrote God's creation and The Fall of Man in \"Paradise Lost\" in order to \"justify the ways of God to men,\" Wordsworth chooses his own mind and imagination as a subject worthy of epic.\n\nThis spiritual autobiography evolves out of Wordsworth's \"persistent metaphor [that life is] a circular journey whose end is 'to arrive where we started / And know that place for the first time' (T. S. Eliot, \"Little Gidding\", lines 241-42). \"The Prelude\" opens with a literal journey [during his manhood] whose chosen goal [...] is the Vale of Grasmere. \"The Prelude\" narrates a number of later journeys, most notably the crossing of the Alps in Book VI and, in the beginning of the final book, the climactic ascent of Snowdon. In the course of the poem, such literal journeys become the metaphorical vehicle for a spiritual journey—the quest within the poet's memory [...]\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3603331", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3603331", "title": "Time's Arrow, Time's Cycle", "text": "Time's Arrow, Time's Cycle\n\nTime's Arrow, Time's Cycle: Myth and Metaphor in the Discovery of Geological Time is a 1987 history of geology by Stephen Jay Gould offering a historical account of the conceptualization of Deep Time and uniformitarianism using the works of Thomas Burnet, James Hutton, and Charles Lyell.\n\nGould ranks the development of the concept \"deep time,\" which involved deliberately rejecting the biblical description of earth's past for nearly incomprehensible eons, with the revolutions associated with Copernicus and Darwin. To illustrate this, Gould picked three major figures in the history of geology, one traditional villain (Thomas Burnet) and two traditional heroes (James Hutton and Charles Lyell).\n\nStandard textbook accounts of the achievements of these three figures have long provided what Gould describes as a \"self-serving mythology.\" These flimsy \"cardboard\" accounts vaunt the superiority of empiricism and inductivism over the scientific nemesis of religious bigotry.\n\nThis legend as perpetuated by geology textbooks over the last century claims that geology remained in the service of the Mosaic story of creation so long as armchair geological theorists refused to place fieldwork ahead of scriptural authority. Thomas Burnet was just such an archetypical religious spokesman. A century later, Hutton heroically broke with this biblical zealotry by arguing that geological evidence must rest upon a solid empirical foundation. The Earth's strata, when carefully examined, betray \"no vestige of a beginning—no prospect of an end.\" But Hutton was far ahead of his time. So it was not until Charles Lyell published the Principles of Geology that geologists finally came to accept Hutton's basic message and banished miraculous intervention, catastrophes, and biblical deluges from their science.\n\nHaving elaborated this bit of scientific melodrama, Gould proceeds to demolish it by showing that the actualities of Hutton's and Lyell's work were the opposite of the textbook legend. His intention is not simply to debunk the textbook legend, which has already been debunked by historians such as Martin J. S. Rudwick. He sets out to rectify the error and show the real sources of inspiration in the development of deep time which have not been properly understood.\n\nGould is deeply influenced by Thomas Kuhn's \"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\". Kuhn argued, in part, that science is a social activity and that theories are intellectual constructions imposed on data, not demanded by them. Along with Kuhn and other philosophers and sociologists of science, Gould has recognized that mental constructs (metaphors, analogies, personal philosophies, imaginative leaps)—not empirical discoveries—are what bring about scientific advance. \"Facts\" are so embedded in a paradigm that they simply do not have the kind of independent probative power they were once thought to possess.\n\nThe development of the idea of deep time is by no means fieldwork, as the textbook myths would have us believe. Rather, Gould pinpoints a powerful pair of metaphors—time's arrow and time's cycle—by which humankind has always tried to grasp the concept of time. Time's arrow captures the uniqueness and distinctive character of sequential events, whereas time's cycle provides these events with another kind of meaning by evoking lawfulness and predictability.\n\nMore importantly, this metaphorical pair of ideas was essential to the thinking of the three geological protagonists; and the paired concepts therefore offer the key, now obscured by textbook mythology, to unlocking their thinking about time.\n\nBurnet's theory is a one-cycle theory in which biblical narrative (time's arrow) runs its course within a wider conception of \"the great year\" and \"great circle of time and fate\" that bring about the return of Paradise.\n\nIt is his belief in Scripture that made Burnet a pariah in the history of geology. Yet Burnet was hardly the religious fanatic he is painted to have been within the context of his contemporary scientific thought.\n\nIn contrast to textbook legend, Burnet was adamant about explaining the Biblical history of the earth entirely within the frame of natural science, devoid of all appeals to miracles or divine intervention. Thus this \"bad guy\" of geological textbook history was actually more devoted to rational, miracle-free science than the greatest scientists of his age.\n\nBefore James Hutton, most geological theorists had dealt only with processes of decay. The earth was created and its geologic structures just wore down through catastrophic events like weathering and especially the biblical Flood.\n\nHutton introduced the concept of repair into geology and, with it, the notion of deep time. The textbook myths see this as a triumph of science and empiricism over religion, but it was nothing of the kind.\n\nHutton's theory of the earth as a geological clockwork of eroding continents balanced against uplifting ocean basins was not based on field observations but on \"a priori\" conceptions inspired jointly by religious considerations and \"the most rigid and uncompromising version of time's cycle ever developed by a geologist.\"\n\nHutton's theory grew out of what may be called \"the paradox of the soil.\" Good soil, the product of the \"denudation,\" or eroding, of rock strata, eventually loses its richness to the plant life it sustains. Were there no geological source for continual new soil then the world would bear the intolerable stamp of an imperfectly designed abode for man's existence. Hutton's homocentric and teleological concept of the world therefore demanded that the soil, new soil, should never run out. This requirement in turn demanded the uplift of new strata to become the sources for soil replenishment.\n\nSo Hutton set out to find evidence for uplift (which he naturally did, since he was looking for it). He found much evidence interpreted to be repeated uplifts of the Earth's crust. This led him inexorably to the idea of deep time.\n\nSo rigid was Hutton's vision of an endlessly cycling earth having \"no vestige of a beginning\" and \"no prospect of an end\" that he lost all interest in the historical nature of geological change. The Divine benevolence entailed in these cycles was everything to Hutton. Such is an unlikely hero for empiricist geology, who nevertheless became one.\n\nGould reconstructs the process of mythification of Hutton and sees it as involving several stages.\n\nFirst, Hutton's long and turgid Theory of the Earth (1795) was popularized by his friend John Playfair (1802). Not only did Playfair make up for Hutton's difficult prose, but he also modernized Hutton's theory by soft-pedaling both his \"denial of biblical history\" and his repeated appeals to final causes. Subsequently, Charles Lyell, who needed an empiricist hero for his own account of the warfare between science and religious bigotry, bolstered Hutton's image as a fieldworker who had no conceptual bias. Finally the legend was consolidated in the writings of later geologists, who rarely bothered to read Hutton in the original.\n\nIt is important to bear in mind that Charles Lyell was trained as a lawyer. His rhetorical skills were considerable and they are crucial to understanding his impact upon the history of geology.\n\nWhen pleading for his favorite client, which became known as the \"uniformitarian\" theory of geology, he portrayed the previous history of his discipline as a gradual overcoming of primitive superstitions, wild speculations, and biblical allegiances. In doing so he created his own legend as an arch-empiricist free of all bias and preconception.\n\nBut Lyell was not selling just evidence and fieldwork over previous dogma and speculative theory. Rather he foisted upon his contemporaries a \"fascinating and particular theory rooted in…time's cycle\" by conflating a number of distinct elements under the single banner of \"uniformitarianism,\" the regularity of physical laws with the irregularity of history.\n\nFirst, Lyell argued for the uniformity of nature's laws (that is, the notion that laws do not change with time or place). Second, he argued for the uniformity of process, which simply means always explaining past changes by currently known causes even if catastrophic interpretations may be just as explanatory. Contrary to legend, Lyell's catastrophic opponents accepted both of these philosophical aspects of \"uniformity.\"\n\nWhat Lyell's critics did not accept were two further substantive hypotheses about the world that he included under the heading of good (uniformitarian) science.\n\nThese claims were that rates of geological change are always uniform and gradual and that the general state of the world also remains uniform (that is, there is no progression or directionality in the long run). Far from using Hutton's field data to show that the earth has passed through vast epochs of change, Lyell drew on the peculiarly static spirit of Hutton's vision to conceive an earth that, although unimaginably old, had changed hardly at all.\n\nThe last of these claims was the most peculiar of all within Lyell's vision of earth history. It led him to deny all evidence of progression in the fossil record and hence to reject not only Lamarck's theory of evolution but also contemporary catastrophist notions, in which \"higher\" organisms were thought to replace \"lower\" ones after mass extinctions. If fossils seemed to belie this, if mammals were absent from older rocks, it was simply because fossils were rare and scattered.\n\nIn showing how Hutton and Lyell were dedicated not to modern notions of geological dynamism but to antique ones of geological steady-state, Gould points out that Lyell was even less of an empiricist than most of his catastrophist and creationist opponents.\n\nFor Lyell was constantly forced to deny the literal evidence of the geological record, which shows whole groups of organisms being abruptly replaced by different sets of organisms in adjacent strata. His gradualist reading of the geological record therefore required his constant \"interpretation\" of the recalcitrant evidence in order to reconcile it with his notions of time's stately cycle and a world without abrupt changes.\n\nNor was Lyell's eventual conversion to evolution a strictly empirical affair. When he finally took this step publicly, in 1868, it was not because he had been persuaded by Darwin's theory of natural selection. In fact, Lyell rejected that theory, accepting only a general evolutionary process without its celebrated Darwinian mechanism.\n\nAdmitting nonmiraculous progression (that is, evolution) in turn allowed him to preserve three of his four uniformities (uniformity of law, process, and rate) while giving up only uniformity of state. This was as Gould notes, \"the most conservative intellectual option available to him.\"\n\nCharles Lyell may have lost the battle over progressionism to Darwinism, but through rhetoric he won a battle against catastrophism, which enabled his hypothesis of the uniformity of rate to become a textbook shibboleth.\n\nThe catastrophists of Lyell's day, Gould nevertheless maintains, were right all along. The literal fossil evidence of major rapid changes in previous faunas does not need to be interpreted away, as Lyell tried to do by appealing to the imperfection of the geological record.\n\nGould sees supreme irony in the recent hypothesis of the Berkeley scientists Luis and Walter Alvarez that mass extinctions were caused by asteroidal or cometary impacts (a hypothesis now made plausible by the discovery of a worldwide iridium layer deposited at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary); for this is precisely the sort of wild \"cosmological\" speculation that Lyell derided in seventeenth-century writers like William Whiston.\n\nGould concludes \"Time's Arrow, Time's Cycle\" by insisting that arrows and cycles are \"eternal metaphors\" in the understanding of time. In a thoughtful complement to his discussion of the history of geology, he shows how these two metaphors have figured in the art and sculpture associated with major biblical themes. Both metaphors, he concludes, are needed \"for any comprehensive view of history.\"\n\nThe article is based upon the following book reviews:\n\nAdditional book reviews include:\n\n\n"}
