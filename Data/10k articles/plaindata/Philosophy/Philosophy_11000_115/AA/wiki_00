{"id": "25109774", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25109774", "title": "Afterwardsness", "text": "Afterwardsness\n\nIn the psychoanalysis of Sigmund Freud, afterwardsness is a \"mode of belated understanding or retroactive attribution of sexual or traumatic meaning to earlier events... [from the German word] \"Nachträglichkeit\", translated as deferred action, retroaction, , afterwardsness\". As summarized by another scholar, 'In one sense, Freud's theory of deferred action can be simply stated: memory is reprinted, so to speak, in accordance with later experience'.\n\nThe psychoanalytical concept of \"afterwardsness\" () appeared initially in Freud's writings in the 1890s in the commonsense form of the German adjective-adverb \"afterwards\" or \"deferred\" (\"nachträglich\"): as Freud wrote in the unfinished and unpublished \"A Project for a Scientific Psychology\" of 1895, 'a memory is repressed which has only become a trauma \"after the event\" '. However the 'theory of deferred action had already been [publicly] put forward by Freud in the \"Studies on Hysteria\" (1895)', and in a paper of 1896 'he elaborates on the idea of \"deferred action\": the pathogenic effect of a traumatic event occurring in childhood...[manifesting] retrospectively when the child reaches a subsequent phase of sexual development'.\n\nThe same idea would feature prominently a couple of decades later in his study of the \"Wolf Man\": 'The effects of the scene were deferred, but...had the same effect as though it were a recent experience'. 'Thus although he never offered a definition, much less a general theory, of the notion of deferred action, it was indisputably looked on by Freud as part of his conceptual equipment'.\n\nIt was Lacan who brought the term back from obscurity after Freud's death—his translation in the French language as the \"\" fits into the context of his \"return to Freud\" (\"rapport de Rome\", 1953)—and certainly French psychoanalysis has since taken the lead in its explication. Lacan himself claimed in his Seminar that \"the real implication of the \"nachträglich\", for example, has been ignored, though it was there all the time and had only to be picked up,\" while writing in Ecrits of \"'deferred action' (\"Nachtrag\"), to rescue another of these terms from the facility into which they have since fallen...they were unheard of at that time.\"\n\nAfter Lacan's \"après-coup\", Jean Laplanche’s contribution to the concept of the afterwardsness signifies something very different: with Jean Laplanche and in the relation to Freud (theory of the seduction, \"neurotica\"), Lacan's \"Other\" loses its capital letter of the \"Symbolic\", that links Lacan to French structuralism (Saussure's linguistics, Lévi-Strauss's ethnology), and that links also Lacan \"afterwards\" in the history of the ideas (from the 1960s on)—by \"inversion in the opposite direction\" (a \"destiny of the drive\" in psychoanalytic theory)—to the at the place of Jacques Derrida's deconstruction.\n\n\"Afterwardsness\" becomes the key concept in Laplanche’s \"theory of the general seduction\" (\"\") and of the corresponding importance of 'the act of \"psychic translation\"... of [enigmatic] deposits by the other'—an approach which develops further Freud's letter 52/112 (to Wilhelm Fliess). In his \"Notes on Afterwardsness\" (1992), based on a conversation of Jean Laplanche with Martin Stanton, there is an excellent definition of \"afterwardsness\" in Laplanche's sense, including the category of the \"enigmatic message\", that highlights Laplanche's contribution to Freud's concept:\nClosely related for Freud to deferred action was deferred obedience: again, 'a \"deferred\" effect...a \"deferred obedience\" under the influence of repression'. Thus for instance Freud explored the different phases of a man's infantile attitude to his father: 'As long as his father was alive it showed itself in unmitigated rebelliousness and open discord, but immediately after his death it took the form of a neurosis based on abject submission and deferred obedience to him'.\n\nIn \"Totem and Taboo\" he generalised the principle and 'depicted the social contract also as based on posthumous obedience to the father's authority'—offset at times by its converse, occasional Carnival-like licence such as 'the memorial festival of the totem meal, in which the \"restrictions\" of deferred obedience no longer held'.\n\n"}

Its existence is still debated today. It is believed by some historians to be a different name (or a branch) of the Nazi German ODESSA organization established during the collapse of the Third Reich, similar to \"Kameradenwerk\", and \"der Bruderschaft\", devoted to helping German war criminals flee Europe. It was led in part by Otto Skorzeny, Hitler's commando chief, as well as Nazi intelligence officer Reinhard Gehlen. \"Die Spinne\" helped as many as 600 former SS men escape from Germany to Francoist Spain, Juan Peron's Argentina, Paraguay, Chile, Bolivia, the Middle East, and other countries.\n\n\"Die Spinne\" was established by Skorzeny using the aliases Robert Steinbacher and Otto Steinbauer, and supported by either Nazi funds or, according to some sources, Austrian Intelligence. Later, Skorzeny, Gehlen, and their network of collaborators had gained significant influence in parts of Europe and Latin America. Skorzeny travelled between Francoist Spain and Argentina, where he acted as an adviser to President Juan Perón and bodyguard of Eva Perón, while fostering an ambition for the \"Fourth Reich\" centred in Latin America.\n\nAccording to Infield, the idea for the Spinne network began in 1944 as Hitler's chief intelligence officer Reinhard Gehlen foresaw a possible downfall of the Third Reich due to Nazi military failures in Russia. T.H. Tetens, expert on German geopolitics and member of the US War Crimes Commission in 1946-47, referred to a group overlapping with die Spinne as the Führungsring (\"a kind of political Mafia, with headquarters in Madrid... serving various purposes.\") The Madrid office built up what was referred to as a sort of Fascist International, per Tetens. According to Tetens the German leadership also included Dr Hans Globke, who had written the official commentary on the Nuremberg Laws. Globke held the important position of Director of the German Chancellery from 1953–63, serving as adviser to Konrad Adenauer.\n\nFrom 1945 to 1950, Die Spinne's leader Skorzeny facilitated the escape of Nazi war criminals from war-criminal prisons to Memmingen, Bavaria, through Austria and Switzerland into Italy. Certain US military authorities allegedly knew of the escape, but took no action. The Central European headquarters of Die Spinne as of 1948 was in Gmunden, Upper Austria.\n\nA coordinating office for international Die Spinne operations was established in Madrid by Skorzeny under the control of Francisco Franco, whose victory in the Spanish Civil War had been aided by economic and military support from Hitler and Mussolini. When a Die Spinne Nazi delegation visited Madrid in 1959, Franco stated, \"Please regard Spain as your second Fatherland.\" Skorzeny used Die Spinne's resources to allow notorious Nazi concentration camp doctor Joseph Mengele to escape to Argentina in 1949.\n\nSkorzeny requested assistance from German industrialist tycoon Alfried Krupp, whose company had controlled 138 private concentration camps under the Third Reich; the assistance was granted in 1951. Skorzeny became Krupp's representative in industrial business ventures in Argentina, a country which harboured a strong pro-Nazi political element throughout World War II and afterwards, regardless of a nominal declaration of loyalty to the Allies as World War II ended. With the help of Die Spinne leaders in Spain, by the early 1980s Die Spinne had become influential in Argentina, Chile and Paraguay, including ties involving Paraguayan dictator Alfredo Stroessner.\n\nWar Crimes investigator Simon Wiesenthal claimed Joseph Mengele had stayed at the notorious Colonia Dignidad Nazi colony in Chile in 1979, and ultimately found harbour in Paraguay until his death. As of the early 1980s, Die Spinne's Mengele was reported by Infield to have been advising Stroessner's ethnic German Paraguayan police on how to reduce native Paraguayan Indians in the Chaco Region to slave labour. A wealthy, powerful post–World War II underground Nazi political contingent held sway in Argentina as of the late 1960s, which included many ethnic German Nazi immigrants and their descendants.\n\nThe \"Spinne\" network in Spain is the focus of the 1966 Nick Carter spy novel \"Web of Spies\".\n\n\"THRUSH\" (\"WASP\") from the TV-series (as well as the unnamed antagonist in the movie) called \"The Man from U.N.C.L.E.\", is built upon Die Spinne.\n\nIan Fleming (who allegedly was the MI6 handler in real life \"Operation James Bond\" to extract Bormann out of Berlin) had in his fictional James Bond series Bormann's network in mind for \"Octopussy\" (Die Spinne) and S.P.E.C.T.R.E.

The theory is meant to serve as an extension of property rights theory. Property rights theory has not received substantial theoretical or empirical attention despite its potential to explain various phenomena dealing with business transactions. Diluted property rights theory addresses this lack of progression by approaching property rights theory from the position of approximating the conditions that actually exist when rights are negotiated, exchanged, and handled.\n\nThis is the same approach that Nobel Prize winner Ronald Coase took when discovering and clarifying the significance of property rights. While property rights theory defines property rights and delineates how the rightful owner of such rights may use, enforce, transfer, and benefit from them, diluted property rights theory attempts to define a pervasive violation of a principal of property rights theory. Writing from a legal perspective, Coase explains how property rights should be delimited. According to Coase, such rights should go to the party that can create the most public benefit. However, property rights are often diluted and the party that can create the most public good are not always granted such rights.\n\nDiluted property rights are created when: \nThe theory holds that the event need not be reoccurring to make a lasting impression. In addition, diluted property rights are not extended to incidental violation of the law that reaves a rightful owner of his rights. Diluted property rights theory is concerned with widespread weakening of rights that are dictated by policy, law, and norms. The concern is that the continued weakening of property rights will have long-lasting wide spread effects that may be disadvantageous to the world economy. This concern is valid in so much as well protected property rights have created long-lasting benefits to corporations.\n\nDiluted property rights have often been approached as a minor topic in traditional business research. For example, in his book \"Internal Research & Development Markets,\" Eric Kasper offered two examples of how rights can be diluted: 1) the exploitation of R & D results by a business unit, and 2) the simultaneous sharing of rights by several individuals. However, in trademark law, dilution from a legal and intellectual rights perspective is well-documented.\n\n\"LesterMoney: Latest and Greatest Business Research in Layman's Terms\". \n\nBlog Statement\n"}

He holds degrees in history, economics, and law. Though less well known in the United States due to the limited availability of English translations of his over 60 books, Morin is renowned in the French-speaking world, Europe, and Latin America.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, Morin's family migrated from the Greek city of Salonica (Thessaloniki) to Marseille and later to Paris, where Edgar was born. He is of Judeo-Spanish (Sefardi) origin.\n\nWhen the Germans invaded France in 1940, Morin assisted refugees and joined the French Resistance. As a member of the French Resistance he adopted the pseudonym \"Morin\", which he would use for the rest of his life. He joined the French Communist Party in 1941.\n\nIn 1945, Morin married Violette Chapellaubeau and they lived in Landau, where he served as a lieutenant in the French Occupation army in Germany.\n\nIn 1946, he returned to Paris and gave up his military career to pursue his activities with the Communist Party. Due to his critical posture, his relationship with the party gradually deteriorated until he was expelled in 1951 after he published an article in \"Le Nouvel Observateur\". In the same year, he was admitted to the National Center of Scientific Research (CNRS).\n\nMorin founded and directed the magazine \"\" (1954–1962). In 1959 his book \"Autocritique\" was published. The book was a sustained reflection on his adherence to, and subsequent exit from, the Communist Party, focusing on the dangers of ideology and self-deception.\n\nIn 1960, Morin travelled extensively in Latin America, visiting Brazil, Chile, Bolivia, Peru and Mexico. He returned to France, where he published \"L'Esprit du Temps\", a work on popular culture\".\"\n\nThat same year, French sociologist Georges Friedmann brought him and Roland Barthes together to create a Centre for the Study of Mass Communication that, after several name changes, became the Edgar Morin Centre of the EHESS, Paris.\n\nAlso in 1960 Morin and Jean Rouch coauthored the film Chronique d'un été, an early example of \"cinéma vérité\" and direct cinema.\n\nBeginning in 1965, Morin became involved in a large multidisciplinary project, financed by the Délégation Générale à la Recherche Scientifique et Technologique in Plozévet.\n\nIn 1968, Morin replaced Henri Lefebvre at the . He became involved in the student revolts that began to emerge in France. In May 1968 he wrote a series of articles for Le Monde that tried to understand what he called \"The Student Commune.\" He followed the student revolt closely and wrote a second series of articles in Le Monde called \"The Revolution without a Face,\" as well as coauthoring \"Mai 68: La brèche\" with Cornelius Castoriadis and Claude Lefort.\n\nIn 1969, Morin spent a year at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California. Jonas Salk invited him under the recommendation of Jacques Monod and John Hunt, with the sole imposed condition of learning. It was there, in this \"breeding ground for Nobel Prizes\" that he familiarized himself with systems theory. He read Henri Laborit, James Watson, Stéphane Lupasco, Bronowski, and was introduced to the thought of Gregory Bateson and the \"new problematic in ecology\".\n\nIn 1983 he published \"De la nature de l’URSS,\" which deepened his analysis of Soviet communism and anticipated the perestroika of Mikhail Gorbachev.\n\nIn 2002 Morin participated in the creation of the International Ethical, Scientific and Political Collegium. Also that year, he made a trip to Iran with Dariush Shayegan.\n\nIn addition to being the UNESCO Chair of Complex Thought, Morin is known as a founder of transdisciplinarity and holds honorary doctorates in a variety of social science fields from 21 universities (Messina, Geneva, Milan, Bergamo, Thessaloniki, La Paz, Odense, Perugia, Cosenza, Palermo, Nuevo León, Université de Laval à Québec, Brussels, Barcelona, Guadalajara, Valencia, Vera Cruz, Santiago, the Catholic University of Porto Alegre, the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte, and Candido Mendes University (Rio de Janeiro)).\n\nThe University of Messina in Sicily, Ricardo Palma University in Lima, and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), the French National Research Center in Paris, have established research centers based on his transdisciplinary methods and philosophy. In addition, the Multiversidad Mundo Real Edgar Morin, a university based on his work, was established in Mexico. Morin did not embrace the French postmodern or poststructuralist movements, instead pursuing his own research agenda. As a result, US academics did not transport his theories into disciplinary discourses in same fashion as they did Foucault's and Derrida's. Morin's work spans scholarly and popular literature, and he has appeared on the cover of multiple publications including Sciences Humaines and a special issue of Le Monde.\n\nAccording to Alfonso Montuori in \"Edgar Morin: A partial introduction\" \"The 6 volume Method is perhaps Morin’s culminating work, a remarkable and seemingly inexhaustible treasure trove of insights, reflection, and a real manual for those who are interested in broadening the nature of human inquiry. Drawing on cybernetics, information theory, systems theory, but also integrating all the work he has done before, from the work on imagination in his research on movies to his profound reflections on death, Method integrates Morin’s journey and provides the reader with an alternative to the traditional assumptions and method of inquiry of our time.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The evolution of biparental care, which is the joint effort of both parents, is a topic that is still under investigation. Biparentalism arose in some species of tropical frogs as a result of ecological conditions, the differences between the sexes, and their natural tendencies.\n\nMale parental care could have served as the basis for the development of biparental care. Phylogenetic evidence shows that male parental care is the ancestral strategy in \"Dendrobates\". Currently there are \"Dendrobates\" species, such as \"D. ventrimaculatus\" and \"D. fantasticus\", that exhibit biparental care. The trend of using males to guard or brood eggs for biparental care or paternal care can be understood from the perspective of the female. After oviposition, or when the eggs are laid, the females need to replenish their bodies that have been dedicated to nurturing the eggs before they can mate again. Brooding by the females would delay the opportunity to mate by about two to four weeks.Since this outcome would cause many males to compete for a few females that are able to mate, the males are favored for the brooding.\n\nThe environment can have a substantial impact on the uses of parental care. Not all tropical frogs have the ability to lay their eggs plainly on land or plants. Tropical frogs can choose from a variety of water sources, such as lakes, streams, and small puddles. There is greater risk involved with reproducing in bigger bodies of water because of the higher likelihood of fish and other aquatic predators being there. Instead, frogs can choose to place eggs in phytotelmata. However, there is a trade-off that comes with electing a smaller water source. Not much sunlight reaches these locations, so algae and other food sources cannot grow to feed the inhabitants. Tropical frogs must use alternative methods of feeding their tadpole offspring. In the case of using phytotelmata, it is very difficult for one parent to guard and feed his or her offspring in possibly several different places. Roles performed by both parents provide a great advantage to the offspring. As seen in the Amazon Rain Forrest, the different size of the bodies of water chosen for breeding correlates with the amount of biparental care in two very similar species of the \"Ranitomeya\" genus. \"Ranitomeya imitator\" favors smaller pools and uses biparental care. Conversely, \"Ranitomeya variabilis\" utilizes larger bodies of water for breeding and only males take part in parental care. The ecologic aspects of a species habitat can have significant impacts on the type of parental care exhibited.\n\nTrophic egg feeding plays a key role in the ability of frogs to breed in smaller bodies of water that lack food sources. Many species of tropical frogs have an inherent nature of cannibalism, such as \"Dendrobates vanzolinii\", that allow their tadpoles to utilize the eggs for nourishment. With a male guarding the eggs, an intermediate step to developing biparental care may have been using the eggs from a mating with another female to feed existing tadpoles. Males could direct where the eggs should be positioned, and then he could move them into the water that holds his tadpole offspring. This polygynous relationship puts a cost on the female because she loses eggs to benefit offspring that are not her own. It is possible that the female could counter this effect by participating in biparental care with her mate. Also, since there may be a lack of males, females could benefit from attacking other clutches that her mate might have fertilized. Eliminating competition of a female’s offspring might result in higher survival of those she is trying to protect. Females have been seen eating other females’ eggs in captivity by certain species, such as \"Dendrobates auratus\".

V.) is a German non-governmental organization.\n\nSince its founding 1959 by Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker, Otto Hahn, Max Born and further prominent nuclear scientists, known as Göttinger 18, who had previously publicly declared their position against the nuclear armament of the German Bundeswehr, the Federation has been committed to the ideal of \"responsible Wissenschaft\". The founders were almost identical to the \"Göttinger 18\" (compare the historical Göttingen Seven). Both the \"Göttingen Manifesto\" and the formation of the VDW were an expression of the new sense of responsibility felt by Otto Hahn and some scientists after the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The VDW tried to mirror the American Federation of Atomic Scientists. VDW has been identified as Western Germany's Pugwash group.\n\nMembers of VDW feel committed to taking into consideration the possible military, political and economical implications and possibilities of atomic misuse when carrying out their scientific research and teaching. The Federation of German Scientists comprises around 400 scholars of different fields. The Federation of German Scientists addresses both interested members of the public and decision-makers on all levels of politics and society with its work. The politician Egon Bahr was a longstanding member. Georg Picht presented a radio series about the Limits of growth on behalf of the VDW in the 1970s. In 2005/2006, the VDW was the patron and main contributor to the Potsdam Manifesto‚ 'We have to learn to think in a new way’ and the Potsdam Denkschrift. 2015 Hartmut Graßl, a former Wuppertal Institute scientist took over the chair of VDW from Ulrich Bartosch, a political scientist at Catholic University of Eichstätt-Ingolstadt.\n\nVDW was closely connected with the German Friedensbewegung (peace movement) in the 1980s. After 1999 VDW tried to regain public interest with the establishment of the Whistleblower Prize, awarded together with the German branch of the International Association of Lawyers Against Nuclear Arms ILANA. FAZ's Joachim Müller-Jung saw it among a series of Gesinnungstrophäen and Goodwillprämien (trophys and premias for a certain opinion and dogooding), but stated a lack of interest in serious scientific work in various awards provided by the VDW.\n\nThe Whistleblower Prize worth 3,000 euro, is given biannually and was established in 1999. In 2015, the selection of Gilles-Éric Séralini generated some controversy. Ulrich Bahnsen in \"Die Zeit\" described VDW and ILANA as consisting of \"busybodys with best wills - and worst possible outcome in the case of this award\". The opinion piece, featured in Zeit Online, described the awarding of Séralini as a failure, and viewed his status as a \"whistleblower\" as questionable, in light of his use of \"junk science\" to support anti-GMO activism.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "24024923", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24024923", "title": "Identifiable victim effect", "text": "Identifiable victim effect\n\nThe \"identifiable victim effect\" refers to the tendency of individuals to offer greater aid when a specific, identifiable person (\"victim\") is observed under hardship, as compared to a large, vaguely defined group with the same need. The effect is also observed when subjects administer punishment rather than reward. Research has shown that individuals can be more likely to mete out punishment, even at their own expense, when they are punishing specific, identifiable individuals (\"perpetrators\").\n\nConcrete images and representations are often more powerful sources of persuasion than are abstract statistics. For example, Ryan White contracted HIV at age 13 and struggled with the disease until succumbing some six years later. Following his death, the US congress passed the Ryan White Care Act, which funded the largest set of services for people living with the AIDS in the country.\n\nThe effect is epitomized by the phrase (commonly attributed to Joseph Stalin) \"A single death is a tragedy; a million deaths is a statistic.\"\n\nThe conceptualization of the identifiable victim effect as it is known today is commonly attributed to American economist Thomas Schelling. He wrote that harm to a particular person invokes “anxiety and sentiment, guilt and awe, responsibility and religion, [but]…most of this awesomeness disappears when we deal with statistical death”.\n\nThe decision to save an identifiable victim is made \"ex post\", meaning it is done \"after\" the victim is in danger. In contrast, the decision to save a statistical victim is often made \"ex ante\", as a pre-emptive measure to \"prevent\" the individual from being in danger. When people consider the risks of not helping a victim, they consider the probability of being responsible and blamed. This probability is much greater with identifiable victims than with statistical victims because one cannot accurately predict the likelihood of a tragedy occurring in the future and thus cannot be held responsible for tragedies that \"might\" occur in the future. (Although, Jenni, & Loewenstein (1997) have found no evidence to support the effect of ex post/ex ante on IVE)\n\nThis explanation is closest to what Thomas Schelling implied in his now-famous paper.\n\nIdentifiable victims, as their name suggests, have features that make them identifiable. Details about their predicament, family background, educational history, etc., are shared through the media and brought to public attention. The stories are emotional, with victims often portrayed as innocent and helpless. For example, Perrault et al. tested an identifiable human victim message, in relation to an identifiable animal victim (i.e., a squirrel) using the context of the consequences of littering, and found the identifiable animal message - an innocent and helpless creature - elicited greater levels of distress and empathy than the identifiable human message. Images and videos of the victim are often shared, and the public is able to follow the victim's predicament in real-time. Studies have previously indicated that people respond more to concrete, graphic information than abstract, statistical information. The vividness of identifiable victims creates a sense of familiarity and social closeness(opposite of social distance).Therefore, identifiable victims elicit greater reactions from people than statistical victims. (Although, Jenni, & Loewenstein (1997) have found no evidence to support this effect)\n\nThe certainty effect and risk seeking for losses reinforce each other. The certainty effect is the inclination to place disproportionately greater weighting to certain outcomes than to uncertain but likely outcomes. The consequences to identifiable victims are viewed as certain to occur whereas the consequences to statistical victims are viewed as probabilistic. Research has also shown the tendency of people to be risk-seeking for losses. A certain loss is viewed more negatively than an uncertain loss with the same expected value. Closely related to this is people tend to be loss averse. They view saving a statistical life as a gain whereas saving an identifiable victim is seen as avoiding a loss. Together, these effects result in people being more likely to aid identifiable, certain victims than statistical, uncertain victims.\n\nRisk that is concentrated is perceived as greater than the same risk dispersed over a wider population. Identifiable victims are their own reference group; if they do not receive aid then the entire reference group is regarded to perish. To illustrate this point, consider an explosion at an offshore oil rig where 50 people work. Suppose all 50 people die in the explosion, this represents 50 of the thousands of people working on offshore oil rigs. Yet, the reference group is not the thousands of people working on offshore oil rigs but rather the 50 people working on that particular offshore oil rig. Therefore, this is perceived as 50 of 50 people certain to die so by aiding them, a significant proportion of the reference group can be saved.\n\nPeople's response to the proportion of the reference group that can be saved is such a significant contributor to the identifiable victim effect that this effect could be re-labelled as the “percentage of reference group saved effect”.\n\nOne implication of the identifiable victim effect is identifiable victims are more likely to be helped than statistical victims.\n\nAn incident that frequently features in literature is the aid given to Jessica McClure and her family. On October 14, 1987, 18-month old Jessica McClure fell into a narrow well in her aunt's home cum day-care centre in Midland, Texas. Within hours, 'Baby Jessica', as she became known, made headlines around the US. The public reacted with sympathy towards her ordeal. While teams of rescue workers, paramedics and volunteers worked to successfully rescue 'Baby Jessica' in 58 hours, a total of $700,000 was amassed in that time. Even after being discharged from hospital, the McClure family were flooded with cards and gifts from members of the public as well as a visit from then-Vice President George H.W. Bush and a telephone call from then-President Ronald Reagan.\n\nThe identifiable victim effect is suggested to be a specific case of a more general 'identifiable other effect'. As such, it also has an effect on punishments. People prefer to punish identified transgressors rather than unidentified transgressors when given a choice between the two. People also exert more severe punishments on identified than unidentified transgressors.\n\nIndividuals are also more likely to assign blame to an identified transgressor if they feel they have been wronged. There is also an increased desire for harsh punishments that persists even when self-sacrifice is required in order to punish the transgressor. This effect can possibly be explained by the increased anger felt towards an identified rather than an unidentified transgressor. This supports the theory of “vividness” as a source of the identifiable victim effect (Small & Loewenstein, 2005).\n\nThe identifiable victim effect may also influence healthcare, both at the individual and national level (Redelmeir & Tversky, 1990). On the individual level, doctors are more likely to recommend expensive, but potentially life-saving, treatments to an individual patient rather than to a group of patients. This effect is not limited to medical professionals, as laymen demonstrate this same bias towards providing more expensive treatments for individual patients (Redelmeir & Tversky, 1990). On the national level, the American people are far more likely to contribute to an expensive treatment to save the life of one person rather than spend much smaller amounts on preventative measures that could save the lives of thousands per year. A function of American individualism, this nationwide bias towards expensive treatments is still prevalent today (Toufexis & Bjerklie, 1993).\n\nThe need to tackle the problems faced by AIDS sufferers was brought to the political forefront as a result of the legal and social plight of one particular AIDS victim, Ryan White. His circumstances and campaign for greater funding for AIDS research were widely publicised in the media which culminated in legislation being passed to provide financial support to AIDS sufferers and their families in 1990 shortly after White's death.\n\nSince the identifiable victim effect can influence punishment, it has the potential to undermine the system of trial by jury (Small & Loewenstein, 2005). Jurors, when deliberating, work with an identifiable perpetrator, and thus may attach negative emotions (e.g. disgust, anger) to the individual or assign increased blame when handing down a harsh sentence. Policymakers, who are unable to see the individual offender, being almost entirely emotionally removed, may actually have intended a more lenient sentence. This may produce a harsher verdict than the legal guidelines recommend or allow. On the other extreme, jurors may feel sympathy, relating with the perpetrator on a level not experienced by policymakers, leading to a milder verdict than legally appropriate or allowable (Small & Loewenstein, 2005).\n\nTypically in crime investigations, law enforcement forces conceal any information regarding the identities of the suspects until they have strong evidence that the suspects are credible. When identities of suspects are revealed through description of their features or release of their images, media coverage and public discussion on the issue grows. On one side, the public discourse can become increasingly negative and hostile, or, if the perpetrator is sympathetic, support for the perpetrator may grow. This is because people experience a greater emotional reaction towards a concrete, identifiable perpetrator than an abstract, unidentifiable one.\n\nJames S. Brady, the then-White House press secretary, was among three collateral damage victims in the attempted assassination of President Reagan in 1981. Brady was explicitly named in reports of the shooting in contrast to the other two injured, a District of Columbia police officer and a Secret Service agent. The political reaction was largely focused on the injuries of Brady which led to the enactment of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993. It states that it is mandatory for firearm dealers to perform background searches on firearm purchasers.\n\nAccording to a 2016 study by Yam and Reynolds, the growing absence of the identifiable victim effect in the business world may contribute to an increase in unethical business behavior. With an increasingly globalized business framework, the identifiable victim effect may become naturally mediated, freeing business leaders and employees alike to engage in unethical behavior without guilt or emotional distress. This may be possible because globalization results in less face-to-face contact, decreasing the identifiability of possible victims. Research suggests that business leaders, as well as workers, are more likely to engage in unethical behavior when the victims of their behavior are anonymous. At the executive level, one possible result of this is worker commodification and exploitation. At the worker level, employees of a company are possibly more likely to steal from the company or lie on a report if they do not believe this behavior will negatively affect a recognizable coworker. A decrease in recognizable coworkers could thus potentially lead to an increase in unethical behavior by workers (Yam & Reynolds, 2016). Research also suggests that outside observers, not only perpetrators, view unethical behavior as less unethical if the victim of the unethical behavior is unidentified (Gino, Shu, & Bazerman, 2010). This could possibly result in less public outcry against unethical practices in a globalized business environment, where the victims are often unseen.\n\nHigh levels of attachment anxiety may increase the power of identifiable victim effect. Research indicates that individuals with high levels of attachment anxiety may donate more to identified victims and donate less to unidentified victims than the average person (Kogut & Kogut, 2013). According to a study by Kogut and Kogut, attachment anxiety may reduce the expression of altruistic tendencies, commonly demonstrated by charitable giving. Researchers hypothesize that this is because anxiously-attached individuals focus their time and energy on dealing with their own vulnerabilities, leaving them no mental energy to focus on the well-being of others. However, this would only be true of the unidentified individual. When faced with an identified victim, individuals who are anxiously attached tend to donate more money than the average individual. This aligns with past research indicating that anxiously attached people experience significantly more personal distress than those securely attached when confronted with victims in need (Mikulincer et al., 2001).\n\nAlthough anxiously-attached people may participate in prosocial behaviors, such as donating money to a charity, their actions are suggested not to be the result of altruistic tendencies, but instead \"positively correlated with egoistic, rather than altruistic motives for helping and volunteering.\"(p 652)(Kogut, T. & Kogut E., 2013). Thus, researchers hypothesize that anxiously attached individuals are more likely to help identified victims only because they will personally benefit. This is possibly because the identified victim can fulfill the desire for personal attachment, not because the victim is in need. It is important to note that their increased helpfulness only extends to easy, effortless actions, such as donating money. It does not extend to particularly difficult or effortful actions, such as donating time (Kogut & Kogut, 2013).\n\nResearch suggests that guilt reduces the power of the identifiable victim effect (Yam & Reynolds, 2016). Before engaging in a behavior, an individual conducts an assessment of the possible emotional outcomes of that behavior. An individual is drawn towards behaviors that would make them happy and repulsed by those that would make them upset. Thus, a person with a high level of guilt is drawn towards altruistic acts because they serve to alleviate the negative emotions that they are experiencing. Consequently, the presence of guilt may actually increase the occurrence of altruistic behavior, such as charitable donations, regardless of whether the victim they are helping is identified or not. Research also suggests that anticipated guilt reduces the occurrence of unethical behavior that may negatively affect an identified victim (Yam & Reynolds, 2016). This may be because knowingly and negatively affecting a recognizable victim causes the individual engaging in unethical behavior to experience distress and negative emotions.\n\nResearch suggests that individual differences in reasoning style moderate the identifiable victim effect (Friedrich & McGuire, 2010). Two different methods of reasoning are “experiential” and “rational”. Experiential thinking (e.g. emotionally-based thinking) is automatic, contextual and fluid, and rational thinking (e.g. logically-based thinking) is deliberative, analytical, and decontextualized. Experiential thinking styles may increase the power of the identifiable victim effect, and rational thinking styles may decrease the power of the identifiable victim effect. Researchers theorize that these differences result because experiential thinkers rely on emotional responses towards an issue when making a decision. In contrast, rational thinkers analyze the situation as a whole before making a decision. Thus, a person thinking rationally would respond to all victims equally, not giving preference to those specifically named or otherwise identified, just as experiential thinkers would be drawn towards the more emotionally charged identified victim (Friedrich & McGuire, 2010).\n\nThe identifiable victim effect has been contested in academia. Critics argue that, when a victim is identified, information such as age and gender of the victim are revealed and people are especially sympathetic in response to that information rather than to identifiability \"per se\".\n\nIn 2003, Deborah Small and George Loewenstein conducted an experiment that mitigated this issue. Identifiability was strictly limited to the \"determination\" of the victim's identity. Therefore, the victim had already been identified regardless of whether the participants had known anything specific about their identity or not. The circumstances of the victim were more palpable and thus elicited greater sympathy from participants. In contrast, the identities of statistical victims were not yet determined. As such, participants found it more difficult to sympathize with indeterminate victims.\n\nIn certain situations, identification of a victim can actually reduce the amount of help offered to that individual. Research suggests that if an individual is seen as responsible for their plight, people are less likely to offer help than if the victim was not identified at all (Kogut, 2011). Most research dedicated to the identifiable victim effect avoids the topic of blame, using explicitly blameless individuals, such as children suffering from an illness (Kogut & Ritov, 2005). However, there are real-world situations where victims may be seen as to blame for their current situation. For example, in a 2011 study by Kogut, individuals were less likely to offer help to an AIDS victim if the victim had contracted AIDS through sexual contact than if the individual was born with AIDS. In other words, individuals were less likely to offer help to victims if they were seen as at least partially responsible for their plight. A meta-study conducted in 2016 supports these findings, reporting that charitable donations were highest when the victim showed little responsibility for their victimization (Lee & Feeley, 2016).\n\nIn such cases where victim blaming is possible, identification of individuals may not induce sympathy and may actually increase negative perception of the victim (Kogut, 2011). This reduction in help is even more pronounced if the individual believes in the just world hypothesis, which is the tendency for people to blame the victim for what has happened to them. This pattern of blame results from a desire to believe that the world is predictable and orderly and that those who suffer must have done something to deserve their suffering.\n\nResearch may indicate that the identifiable victim effect only affects identified individuals, not identified groups (Kogut & Ritov, 2005). A 2005 study by Kogut and Ritov asked participants how much they would be willing to donate to either a critically ill child or a group of eight critically ill children. Although identification of the individual child increased donations, identification of the group of children as a whole did not. Researchers also found that, although both the individual and group evoked similar amounts of empathy, individual victims evoked more emotional distress than groups of victims. Continuing from this, researchers hypothesized that emotional distress, not empathy, appears to be positively correlated with desire to help, or “willingness to contribute.” This supports the idea that altruistic acts may serve as coping mechanisms to alleviate negative emotions, such as guilt (Yam & Reynolds, 2016). This also supports later research that suggests distress and sympathy are the driving emotional factors behind the identifiable victim effect (Erlandsson, Björklund, & Bäckström, 2015).\n\n"}
{"id": "876262", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=876262", "title": "Incivility", "text": "Incivility\n\nIncivility is a general term for social behaviour lacking in civility or good manners, on a scale from rudeness or lack of respect for elders, to vandalism and hooliganism, through public drunkenness and threatening behaviour. The word \"incivility\" is derived from the Latin \"incivilis\", meaning \"not of a citizen\".\n\nThe distinction between plain rudeness, and perceived incivility as threat, will depend on some notion of civility as structural to society; incivility as anything more ominous than bad manners is therefore dependent on appeal to notions like its antagonism to the complex concepts of civic virtue or civil society. It has become a contemporary political issue in a number of countries.\n\nCivil behavior requires that people communicate with respect, restraint, and responsibility, and uncivil communication occurs when people fail to do so. Universal pragmatics, a term coined by Jürgen Habermas, suggests that human conflict arises from miscommunication, so communicative competence is needed to reduce conflict. Communication competence \"involves the ability to communicate in such a way that: (1) the truth claim of an utterance is shared by both speaker and hearer; (2) the hearer is led to understand and accept the speaker’s intention; and (3) the speaker adapts to the hearer’s world view.\" If people disagree about the truth or appropriateness of their interaction, conflict will occur.\n\nAccording to Habermas, we should establish communicative norms that lead to rational conversations by creating the social coordination needed for interactants to pursue their goals while recognizing the truth or appropriateness of their interaction. Such norms, or social rules, include: \"all participants must be allowed to speak freely, all participants must be allowed to speak for themselves (to enable them to establish their own ethos or \"selfhood\"), and that communication should be equal, with no one participant commanding more attention from the others than is afforded to them on their turn.\"\n\nSome examples of uncivil communication include rude gestures, vulgar language, interrupting, and loudly having private discussions in public spaces. Recent poll data suggests that Americans believe uncivil communication is a serious problem, and believe it has led to an increase in physical violence. The 2013 study on \"Civility in America: A Nationwide Survey\", conducted by global public relations firm Weber Shandwick and public affairs firm Powell Tate in partnership with KRC Research found that 70 percent of Americans believe incivility has reached crisis proportions. Of those who expect civility to rise, 34 percent blame Twitter. The study found that Americans encounter incivility, on average, 17.1 times per week, or 2.4 times per day. Some studies suggest that uncivil communication may have real consequences, including increased health problems due to stress, decreased work productivity, more auto accidents caused by aggressive driving, and vandalism.\n\nPolitical incivility is different from the everyday incivility described above. According to face negotiation theory, politeness norms require us to avoid challenging others, but political incivility is different because, since it is specific to the political sphere, contestation of views and confrontation are required for a democracy to occur. According to Thomas Benson, \"Where there is disagreement, there is a risk of incivility; in many cases, incivility is itself a tactic in political discourse, employed as an indicator of sincerity, as the marker of the high stakes in a disagreement.\"\n\nCivil discourse is \"the free and respectful exchange of different ideas\". Eight out of 10 Americans believe that the lack of civil discourse in the political system is a serious problem. Eighty-two percent of American respondents to a 2011 survey felt that political advertisements were too \"nasty\" and 72 percent believed that political commercials that attacked the opponent were \"inappropriate\". Research has linked political incivility to reduced trust in the legitimacy of political candidates, political polarization, and policy gridlock. Campaigns and politicians are not the only avenues for incivility, however. The public also participates in civil discourse, and incivility. Incivility in these contexts can lead to the breakdown of political discourse, and exclude certain people or groups from the discussion. If people or groups are systematically excluded from the discussion, the democratic nature of that discussion is called into question. \n\nIn his article \"\", Habermas explains that the public sphere is \"a realm of our social life in which something approaching public opinion can be formed… Although state authority is so to speak the executor of the political public sphere, it is not a part of it.\" Political incivility threatens the features of the rhetorical model of the public sphere, which include:\n\nPolitical incivility threatens the future of the rhetorical model of the public sphere because it fractures that sphere into counter-publics, which may or may not interact with each other. According to Papacharissi (2004), \"Incivility can then be operationalized as the set of behaviors that threaten democracy, deny people their personal freedoms, and stereotype social groups.\", all of which could result from the violation of the features of the rhetorical model of the public sphere. People or groups may be systematically shut out of the mainstream political discourse, which makes that discourse less democratic, as certain voices are then missing from that discourse. Examples of incivility in political discourse include, but are not limited to, name calling, derisive or disrespectful speech and vulgarity, intentional lies, and misrepresentation. Another type of uncivil behavior is \"outrage speech\", which includes name calling, insulting, character assassination, mockery, and emotional displays. There are disagreements among researchers about whether or not emotional speech – using anger, fear, or hatred – should be considered uncivil. Some researchers view some emotional speech as civil unless it threatens democracy in some way, while other researchers view emotional speech itself as a disruption to democracy, and push for a purely rational view of civility. \n\nStryker et al. assert that \"political incivility is usefully distinguished from interpersonal politeness outside of politics.\" Their research found consensus among survey respondents concerning the types of political speech and behavior that \"count\" as \"political incivility\". Papacharissi echoes this sentiment, stating that \"civility should be redefined as a construct that encompasses, but also goes beyond, politeness.\" \n\nA 2011 report in USA Today defined Workplace incivility as \"a form of organizational deviance... characterized by low-intensity behaviors that violate respectful workplace norms, appearing vague as to intent to harm.\" The article asserts further that researchers had announced at the annual meeting of the American Psychological Association that \"Workplace incivility is on the rise. Uncivil behaviors are characteristically rude and discourteous, displaying a lack of regard for others.\" Incivility is distinct from violence. Examples of workplace incivility include insulting comments, denigration of the target's work, spreading false rumors, and social isolation.\n\nAt one time, a number of automotive audio manufacturers engaged in marketing incivility with their products, which included Sony with its \"Disturb The Peace\" tagline.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "164654", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=164654", "title": "Joseph B. Soloveitchik", "text": "Joseph B. Soloveitchik\n\nJoseph Ber Soloveitchik ( \"Yosef Dov ha-Levi Soloveychik\"; February 27, 1903 – April 9, 1993) was a major American Orthodox rabbi, Talmudist, and modern Jewish philosopher. He was a scion of the Lithuanian Jewish Soloveitchik rabbinic dynasty.\n\nAs a \"rosh yeshiva\" of Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary at Yeshiva University in New York City, The Rav (variantly spelled The Rov), as he came to be known, ordained close to 2,000 rabbis over the course of almost half a century.\n\nHe served as an advisor, guide, mentor, and role-model for tens of thousands of Jews, both as a Talmudic scholar and as a religious leader. He is regarded as a seminal figure by Modern Orthodox Judaism.\n\nJoseph Ber Soloveitchik was born on February 27, 1903, in Pruzhany, then Russia (next Poland, now Belarus). He came from a rabbinical dynasty dating back some 200 years: His paternal grandfather was Rabbi Chaim Soloveitchik, and his great-grandfather and namesake was Rabbi Yosef Dov Soloveitchik, the \"Beis HaLevi\". His great-great-grandfather was Rabbi Naftali Zvi Yehuda Berlin (\"The Netziv\"), and his great-great-great-great grandfather was Rabbi Chaim Volozhin. His father, Rabbi Moshe Soloveichik (note different spelling of last name), preceded him as head of the RIETS rabbinical school at Yeshiva University.\nOn his maternal line, Soloveitchik was a grandson of Rabbi Eliyahu Feinstein and his wife Guta Feinstein, née Davidovitch, who, in turn, was a descendant of a long line of Kapulyan rabbis, and of the Tosafot Yom Tov, the Shelah, the Maharshal, and Rashi.\n\nSoloveitchik was educated in the traditional manner at a Talmud Torah, an elementary yeshiva, and by private tutors, as his parents realized his great mental powers. According to a curriculum vitae written and signed in his own hand, in 1922, he graduated from the liberal arts \"Gymnasium\" in Dubno. In 1924, he entered the Free Polish University in Warsaw, where he spent three terms, studying political science. In 1926, he came to Berlin, Germany, and entered the Friedrich Wilhelm University. He passed the examination for supplementary subjects at the German Institute for Studies by Foreigners, and was then given full matriculation at the University. He took up studies in philosophy, economics, and Hebrew subjects, simultaneously maintaining a rigorous schedule of intensive Talmud study.\n\nAccording to the CV, among his \"highly honored\" teachers in university, bearing the title \"Geheimrat\" (literally: Privy Counselor), were Professor Dr. (1867-1933) and Professor Dr. Max Dessoir, along with Professor Dr. Eugen Mittwoch and Professor Dr. Ludwig Bernhard. He studied the work of European philosophers, and was a life-long student of neo-Kantian thought.\n\nHe wrote his Ph.D. thesis on the epistemology and metaphysics of the German philosopher Hermann Cohen.\nContrary to most biographies, which erroneously state that in 1931, he received his degree, he actually passed his oral doctor's examination on July 24, 1930, but graduated with a doctorate only on December 19, 1932, as he had requested an extension to allow him to expand his thesis. Documents exist to support this assertion, located by Marc B. Shapiro in the University of Berlin archives.\n\nIn 1931, he married Tonya Lewit (1904-1967), who had earned a Ph.D. in Education from Jena University. Rabbi Chaim Ozer Grodzinski served as his mesader kiddushin in Vilna.\n\nDuring his years in Berlin, Soloveitchik became a close disciple of Rabbi Hayyim Heller, who had established an institute for advanced Jewish Studies from an Orthodox perspective in the city. He also made the acquaintance of other young scholars pursuing a similar path to his own. One such figure was Rabbi Yitzchok Hutner, who would become the rosh yeshiva of the Yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Berlin, also in Brooklyn, New York. Both of them developed a system of thought that bridged the Eastern European way of traditional scholarship with the new forces of modernity in the Western World. Among the other personalities with whom he came into contact were Professor Alexander Altmann, Rabbi Dr. Yehiel Yaakov Weinberg, Rector of the Hildesheimer Rabbinical Seminary, and Professor Yeshayahu Leibowitz.\n\nIn 1932, Soloveitchik emigrated to America and settled in Boston, where he referred to himself as \"The Soloveitchik of Boston\". He pioneered the Maimonides School, one of the first Hebrew day schools in Boston in 1937. When the school's high school was founded in the late 1940s, he instituted a number of innovations in the curriculum, including teaching Talmud to boys and girls studying in classes together. He involved himself in all manner of religious issues in the Boston area. He was at times both a rabbinical supervisor of kosher slaughtering - \"shechita\" - and an educator, gladly accepting invitations to lecture in Jewish and religious philosophy at prestigious New England colleges and universities. His son-in-law, Rabbi Professor Isadore Twersky, was an internationally renowned expert on the writings of Maimonides, and succeeded Professor Harry Austryn Wolfson to the Nathan Littauer chair of Jewish History and Literature at Harvard University.\n\nJoseph Soloveitchik succeeded his father, Moses (Moshe) Soloveichik, as the head of the RIETS rabbinical school at Yeshiva University in 1941. He taught there until 1986, when illness kept him from continuing, and was considered the top Rosh Yeshiva (never, however, a formally recognized position at YU) from the time he began teaching there until his death in 1993. He was the first occupant of the Leib Merkin Distinguished Professorial Chair in Talmud and Jewish Philosophy at RIETS.\n\nHe ordained over 2,000 rabbis, many of whom are among the leaders of Orthodox Judaism and the Jewish people today. In addition, he gave public lectures that were attended by thousands from throughout the greater Jewish community, as well as regular classes at other New York institutions.\n\nRav Soloveitchik advocated more intensive textual Torah study for Jewish women at the Stern College for Women, giving the first class in Talmud inaugurated at Stern College. With his enlightened outlook, he attracted and inspired many young men and women to become spiritual leaders and educators in Jewish communities worldwide. They, in turn, went out with the education of Yeshiva University to head synagogues, schools, and communities, where they continue to influence many Jews to remain - or become - committed to Orthodoxy and observance. Rabbi Meir Kahane was highly influenced by his lectures.\n\nRabbis Herschel Schacter, Sholem Kowalsky, Julius Berman; Menachem Genack; and Fabian Schoenfeld (all students of Soloveitchik) have asserted that Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the late Lubavitcher Rebbe and Soloveitchik met for the first time while they both studied in Berlin. They met many times at the home of Hayyim Heller. Soloveitchik told Kowalsky he \"was a great admirer of the Rebbe\". Schoenfeld quoted Soloveitchik as having told him that while both he and Schneerson were studying at the University of Berlin, \"I can testify that he never missed going to the mikva one single day.\"\nIn 1964, Soloveitchik paid a lengthy visit while Rabbi Schneerson was mourning the death of his mother. Their conversation during this visit lasted approximately two hours. Soloveitchik later visited again following the death of Rabbi Schneerson's mother-in-law.\nIn 1980, accompanied by his student Herschel Schacter, Soloveitchik visited Schneerson at Chabad headquarters in Brooklyn on the occasion of a celebration marking the 30th anniversary of his leadership. The visit lasted close to two hours after which Soloveitchik told Schacter his opinion of Schneerson: \"He is a gaon (genius), he is a great one, he is a leader of Israel.\"\n\nDuring his tenure at Yeshiva University, in addition to his Talmudic lectures, Soloveitchik deepened the system of \"synthesis\" whereby the best of religious Torah scholarship would be combined with the best secular scholarship in Western civilization. This later became known as the \"Torah Umadda\" - \"Torah and secular wisdom\" philosophy- the motto of Yeshiva University. Through public lectures, writings, and his policy decisions for the Modern Orthodox world, he strengthened the intellectual and ideological framework of Modern Orthodoxy.\n\nIn his major non-Talmudic publications, which altered the landscape of Jewish philosophy and Jewish theology, Soloveitchik stresses the normative and intellectual centrality of the halakhic corpus. He authored a number of essays and books offering a unique synthesis of Neo-Kantian existentialism and Jewish thought, the most well-known being \"The Lonely Man of Faith\" which deals with issues such as the willingness to stand alone in the face of monumental challenges, and \"Halakhic Man\".\nA less known essay, though not less important, is \"The Halakhic Mind - An essay on Jewish tradition and modern thought\", written in 1944 and published only 40 years later, without any change, as the author himself stresses.\n\nIn \"The Lonely Man of Faith\", Soloveitchik reads the first two chapters of Genesis as a contrast in the nature of the human being and identifies two human types: Adam I, or \"majestic man\", who employs his creative faculties in order to master his environment; and Adam II, or \"covenantal man\", who surrenders himself in submission to his Master. Soloveitchik describes how the man of faith integrates both of these aspects.\n\nIn the first chapter, Adam I is created together with Eve, and they are given the mandate to subdue nature, master the cosmos, and transform the world \"into a domain for their power and sovereignty\". Adam I is \"majestic man\" who approaches the world and relationships—even with the divine—in functional, pragmatic terms. Adam I, created in the image of God, fulfills this apparently \"secular\" mandate by conquering the universe, imposing his knowledge, technology, and cultural institutions upon the world. The human community depicted in Genesis 1 is a utilitarian one, where man and woman join together, like the male and female of other animals, to further the ends of their species.\n\nIn chapter two of Genesis, Adam II, on the other hand represents the lonely man of faith - bringing a \"redemptive interpretation to the meaning of existence\". Adam II does not subdue the garden, but rather tills it and preserves it. This type of human being is introduced by the words, \"It is not good for man to be alone\" - and through his sacrifice (of a metaphoric rib), he gains companionship and the relief of his existential loneliness - this covenantal community requires the participation of the Divine.\n\nIn \"Halakhic Man\", Soloveitchik propounds the centrality of halakha in Jewish thought. His theological outlook is distinguished by a consistent focus on halakha, i. e., the fulfillment and study of the divine law. He presents the halakha as the \"a priori\" basis for religious practice and for the theological foundation for Jewish thought. Soloveitchik emphasizes halakha's \"this-worldly, here-and-now grounding\", as opposed to religious approaches that focus on the nature of the transcendent realm. This work argues that Jewish piety does not, therefore, fit familiar models of Western religiosity, and presents a phenomenology of this religious type. Here, \"Halakhic man\", as a result of his study of Torah and his observance of the commandments, develops a set of coherent attitudes towards intellectual activity, asceticism, death, esotericism, mysticism, creativity, repentance, and providence. He also underscores the necessity for individual self-creation as the divinely assigned task of the human being.\n\n\"Halakhic Man\" has become well read in the Orthodox Jewish community, but its psychology and model of Jewish law was rejected by most of non-Orthodox Judaism; one of the most prominent critiques is from Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, who wrote: \n\n\"Ish Ha-halakhah? Lo haya velo nivra ela mashal haya!\" [Halakhic Man? Such a Jew has never existed!] Soloveitchik's study, though brilliant, is based on the false notion that Judaism is a cold, logical affair with no room for piety. After all, the Torah does say 'Love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and soul and might'. No, there never was such a typology in Judaism as the halakhic man. There was - and is - an Ish Torah \"[Torah man]\" who combines halakhah and aggadah, but that is another matter altogether. When I came to Berlin I was shocked to hear my fellow students talking about the problem of halakha as a central issue. In Poland it had been a foreign expression to me. Halakhah is not an all-inclusive term, and to use it as such is to restrict Judaism. 'Torah' is the more comprehensive word.\n\n\"Halakhic Mind\" is a four-part analysis of the historical correlation between science and philosophy. Only in its fourth and last part does the author introduce the consequences on the Halakha of the analysis performed in the previous three parts.\n\nSoloveitchik became a \"lightning rod\" of criticism from two directions. From the religious left, he was viewed as being too connected to the Old World of Europe, while for those on the religious right, he was seen as legitimizing those wanting to lower their religious standards in the attempt to modernize and Americanize. Despite this criticism, Soloveitchik remained steadfast in his beliefs and positions throughout the years of his leadership. His highly original use in all of the foregoing works of categories and concepts drawn from existentialism and other schools of secular modern philosophy is analyzed in some depth in the writings of Fr. Christiam M. Rutishauser, S.J.\n\nSoloveitchik was proud of his connections to the Soloveitchik rabbinic dynasty, speaking fondly of his \"uncle\" Rabbi Yitzchak Zev Soloveitchik (the \"Brisker Rov\"). To his relatives and namesakes who now lived in Jerusalem, where they had established their own branch of the Brisk Yeshiva, he was respected for his genius in Talmudic scholarship which few could challenge or disparage, despite their very differing views on Zionism (the \"Briskers\" in Jerusalem being staunch anti-Zionists). See the paragraph on \"Zionism\" below for a discussion of Soloveitchik's Zionist viewpoint.\nRecent research published by Shlomo Pick indicates that his father, Rabbi Moshe Soloveitchik, maintained a close relationship with Religious Zionist (Mizrachi) circles in Warsaw, prior to the father's departure for Yeshiva University and the son's departure for the University of Berlin in 1923.\n\nModern Orthodox Jews consider Rabbi Soloveitchik to be the paradigmatic Modern Orthodox Jew, based on Soloveitchik's focus on secular studies and world culture, and his Zionism (see paragraph on Soloveitchik's Zionism below). However, some of Soloveitchik's opinions on these issues are vague, and Soloveitchik's students have taken many different stances on these matters. In any case, most Modern Orthodox institutions today, including Yeshiva University, have connections to Rabbi Soloveitchik.\n\nAfter Soloveitchik left Agudath Israel, the organization's leadership was mostly quiet when it came to public statements involving Soloveitchik. Rabbi Moshe Feinstein, who was Soloveitchik's cousin, maintained very warm and profoundly respectful relations with him. They corresponded and spoke (at least) on the eve of every Jewish holiday. Rabbi Yitzchok Hutner referred to him as a \"gadol\" (a foremost Torah scholar of the time). Rabbi Aaron Kotler, whose public policy in relation to American Jewry was far more right-wing than Soloveitchik's, was introduced by Soloveitchik at a Chinuch Atzmai dinner, and this later became famous as an instance of unity among the Orthodox leadership. Agudath Israel's mouthpiece, the \"Jewish Observer\", also mentioned Soloveitchik as one of the greatest rabbis of the generation when detailing a cable which was sent by various gedolim to former Israeli Prime Minister Levi Eshkol requesting the government to put a stop to Christian missionary activity in Israel. In May 1993, Rabbi Nisson Wolpin penned an obituary for Soloveitchik in the \"Jewish Observer\". The article was criticized for being a mere page long as instead of the \"Jewish Observer's\" usually comparatively long obituaries, for the obituary not being mentioned in the table of contents, and portraying Soloveitchik as not clarifying his views enough. Rabbi Moshe David Tendler, a son-in-law of Rabbi Moshe Feinstein, wrote a scathing attack on Wolpin's piece, which was published both in The Community Synagogue of Monsey's newsletter and the \"Algemeiner Journal\".\n\nSoloveitchik did not sign Rabbi Moshe Feinstein's proposed ban on interfaith dialogue. Instead, he published a path-breaking essay expounding his views on the subject, entitled \"Confrontation\". He also did not sign the ban by America's foremost rabbis against participating in the Synagogue Council of America. It has been debated whether his refusal to sign was because he believed in participating in the SCA, or because he was not happy with the way the ban was instituted.\n\nDespite the Agudah's comparative silence on Soloveitchik and his stances, the \"Jewish Observer\" has often criticized the Rabbinical Council of America in which he served and his more modern students, including Rabbi Norman Lamm, Rabbi Shlomo Riskin and Rabbi Dr. Lawrence Kaplan.\n\nMany of Soloveitchik's students became leaders in the Modern Orthodox community. These students tend to espouse very distinct world views.\n\nOne of the most iconoclastic is Rabbi Prof. David Hartman of Jerusalem, whose support for pluralism has gained him serious backing in non-Orthodox streams and who has brought Soloveitchik's thinking to the non-Orthodox. The institution he founded, the Shalom Hartman Institute, is a home for serious thinkers from Orthodoxy, Conservative/Masorti, Reform and even secular scholars, and trains hundreds of Jewish community leaders annually. Rabbis Avi Weiss and Saul Berman, who represent liberal Modern Orthodox institutions such as Yeshivat Chovevei Torah and Edah, are somewhat further to the right of Irving Greenberg, Shlomo Riskin and Hartman, but still very liberal in comparison to most Orthodox thinkers (Rabbi Weiss has classified this approach as \"Open Orthodoxy\").\n\nMany students of Soloveitchik represent a centrist approach to Modern Orthodoxy (which Lamm has coined \"Centrist Orthodoxy\") such as Rabbis Aharon Lichtenstein, Benjamin Blech, Lawrence Kaplan, and Lamm. The \"Torah UMadda Journal\", \"Tradition\" magazine, the Rabbinical Council of America, Efrat, Yeshiva University, Bnei Akiva, the Orthodox Union, and various post-high school yeshivot and seminaries in Israel (i.e. Yeshivat Hakotel and Yeshivat Har Etzion) are largely, if not mostly (but almost never monolithically) populated by \"Centrist Orthodox\" Jews.\n\nFurther to the right in the spectrum of Orthodoxy lie Rabbis Yehuda Parnes and Abba Bronspiegel, both of whom resigned from teaching positions in Yeshiva University to join right-wing alternative Lander College. A few of Soloveitchik students identify themselves and Soloveitchik's teachings with the Haredi world, such as Rabbi Moshe Meiselman, Soloveitchik's nephew and Rosh Yeshiva of Yeshiva Toras Moshe in Jerusalem; Rabbi Mosheh Twersky, one of Soloveitchik's grandchildren and a teacher at Toras Moshe; Rabbi Michel Shurkin, also a teacher at Toras Moshe; and Rabbi Chaim Ilson, Rosh Yeshiva of Yeshivas Derech Hatalmud in Jerusalem.\n\nSince his death, interpretations of Soloveitchik's beliefs have become a matter of ongoing debate, somewhat analogous to the long-standing debate about Samson Raphael Hirsch. Some Haredim and some on the right wing of Modern Orthodoxy believe that Hirsch only wanted Jews to combine an observant Jewish lifestyle with learning the surrounding gentile society's language, history, and science, so that a religious Jew could operate in the surrounding secular society. However, this is not a universally held opinion among right-wing Orthodox Jews (see, for example, the writings of Rabbi Shimon Schwab and the biography of Rabbi Hirsch by Rabbi Eliyahu Klugman). Similarly, some scholars of Soloveitchik's philosophy maintain that an eclectic pragmatic approach was adopted by Soloveitchik as well. According to this view, Soloveitchik did not approve of Jews learning secular philosophy, music, art, literature or ethics, unless it was for purposes of obtaining a livelihood or outreach.\n\nIn contrast, liberal leaning scholars believe that this understanding of Soloveitchik's philosophy is misguided. This issue has been discussed in many articles in \"Tradition: A Journal of Orthodox Thought\", published by the Rabbinical Council of America. According to this view, Soloveitchik believed that it was permissible for Jews to learn secular philosophy, music, art, literature and ethics for their own sake and encouraged this.\n\nProfessor Yitzchak Twersky, a son-in-law of The Rav, pointed out in a eulogy published in the journal \"Tradition\" in 1996 that Soloveitchik's philosophy could be paraphrased as follows: \"When you know your [Jewish] Way—your point of departure and goals—then use philosophy, science and the humanities to illumine your exposition, sharpen your categories, probe the profundities and subtleties of the masorah and reveal its charm and majesty; in so doing you should be able to command respect from the alienated and communicate with some who might otherwise be hostile or indifferent to your teaching as well as to increase the sensitivity and spirituality of the committed.\"\nSoloveitchik stated that although he felt that he successfully transmitted the facts and laws of Judaism to his students, he felt that he failed in transmitting the experience of living an authentic Jewish life. He stated that many of his students \"act like children, and experience religion like children. This is why they accept all types of fanaticism and superstition. Sometimes, they are even ready to do things that border on the immoral. They lack the experiential component of religion, and simply substitute obscurantism for it ... After all, I come from the ghetto. Yet, I have never seen so much naïve and uncritical commitment to people and to ideas as I see in America ... All extremism, fanaticism, and obscurantism come from a lack of security. A person who is secure cannot be an extremist.\" (\"A Reader's Companion to Ish Ha-Halakhah: Introductory Section\", David Shatz, Yeshiva University, Joseph B. Soloveitchik Institute).\n\nShortly after Soloveitchik's passing, Lamm, in a eulogy for Soloveitchik delivered on April 25, 1993, urged his auditors to \"guard ... against any revisionism, any attempts to misinterpret the Rav's work in both worlds [the world of Torah and the world of Madda(Science)]. The Rav was not a lamdan who happened to have and use a smattering of general culture, and he was certainly not a philosopher who happened to be a talmid hakham, a Torah scholar ... We must accept him on his terms, as a highly complicated, profound, and broad-minded personality ... Certain burgeoning revisionisms may well attempt to disguise and distort the Rav's uniqueness by trivializing one or the other aspect of his rich personality and work, but they must be confronted at once.\" (Lawrence Kaplan \"Revisionism and the Rav: The Struggle for the Soul of Modern Orthodoxy\", Judaism, Summer, 1999).\n\nSoloveitchik was a life-long critic of all forms of non-Orthodox Judaism, including Reform Judaism and Conservative Judaism. He believed that these denominations were in significant error where they differed from Orthodox Judaism. He compared religious dialogue with Reform and Conservative leaders to dialogue between Pharisees and Karaites, considering it ridiculous. One of the major differences was in regard to the mixed seating in the synagogue. Consistent with the traditional rabbinic understanding of this issue, Soloveitchik ruled that it was forbidden to pray in a synagogue without a separation between the sexes (mi-d'orayta, a Pentateuchal prohibition), and without the use of a mechitza, a divider between the men's and women's sections (mi-derabbenan, a rabbinical prohibition). The effect of this was to prohibit prayer in any Reform synagogue and in many Conservative synagogues. His responsum on this question was also directed at the small number of Orthodox synagogues that were adopting mixed-sex seating. He was vociferous on this issue.\nSoloveitchik believed that Reform and Conservative rabbis did not have proper training in halakha and Jewish theology, and that due to their decisions and actions, they could not be considered rabbis, as Orthodox Jews traditionally understood the term. However, in practice, he sometimes granted non-Orthodox rabbis some degree of validity with respect to communal affairs (see examples below).\n\nSoloveitchik developed the idea that Jews have historically been linked together by two distinct covenants. One is the \"brit yi'ud\", \"covenant of destiny\", which is the covenant by which Jews are bound together through their adherence to halakha. The second is the \"brit goral\", \"covenant of fate\", the desire and willingness to be part of a people chosen by God to live a sacred mission in the world, and the fact that all those who live in this covenant share the same fate of persecution and oppression, even if they do not live by halakha. Soloveitchik held that non-Orthodox Jews were in violation of the covenant of destiny, yet they are still bound together with Orthodox Jews in the covenant of fate.\n\nIn 1954 Soloveitchik issued a responsum on working with non-Orthodox Jews, \"Orthodox, Conservative and Reform Jews in the United States: Second article in a series on Responsa of Orthodox Judaism in the United States\". The responsum recognized the leadership of non-Orthodox Jews in Jewish communal institutions (but not their rabbis in the Orthodox sense of the term), and concluded that participation with non-Orthodox Jews for political or welfare purposes is not only permissible, but obligatory.\n\nThe \"Council of Torah Sages\" of Agudath Yisroel countered with a ruling that such cooperation with non-Orthodox Jews was equivalent to endorsement of non-Orthodox Judaism, and thus was forbidden. In 1956 many Yeshiva leaders, including two rabbis from his own Yeshiva University, signed and issued a proclamation forbidding any rabbinical alumni of their yeshivot from joining with Reform or Conservative rabbis in professional organizations.\n\nSoloveitchik declined to sign the proclamation, maintaining that there were areas, particularly those relating to problems that threatened all of Judaism, that required co-operation regardless of affiliation. His refusal emboldened other Modern Orthodox rabbis, and the Rabbinical Council of America and Union of Orthodox Congregations then joined the Synagogue Council of America, a group in which Orthodox, Reform and Conservative denominations worked together on common issues. (The Synagogue Council of America ceased operating in 1994.)\n\nIn the 1950s Soloveitchik and other members of the Rabbinical Council of America engaged in a series of private negotiations with the leaders of Conservative Judaism's Rabbinical Assembly, especially with Rabbi Saul Lieberman; their objective was to found a joint Orthodox-Conservative beth din that would be a national rabbinic court for all Jews in America; it would supervise communal standards of marriage and divorce. It was to be modeled after the Israeli Chief Rabbinate, with only Orthodox judges, but with the expectation that it would be accepted by the larger Conservative movement as legitimate. Conservative rabbis in the Rabbinical Assembly formed a \"Joint Conference on Jewish Law\" and devoted a year to the effort.\n\nFor a number of reasons, the project did not succeed. According to Orthodox Rabbi Bernstein, the major reason for its failure was that the Orthodox rabbis insisted that the Conservative Rabbinical Assembly expel some Conservative rabbis for actions they took before the new Beit Din was formed, and the RA refused to do so (Bernstein, 1977). According to Orthodox Rabbi Emanuel Rackman, former president of the RCA, the major reason for its failure was pressure from right-wing Orthodox rabbis, who held that any cooperation between Orthodoxy and Conservatism was forbidden. In an account prepared in 1956, Rabbi Harry Halpern of the Rabbinical Assembly's \"Joint Conference\" wrote that negotiations between the Orthodox and Conservative were completed and agreed upon, but then a new requirement was demanded by the RCA: that the RA \"impose severe sanctions\" upon Conservative rabbis for actions they took before the new beth din was formed. The RA \"could not assent to rigorously disciplining our members at the behest of an outside group\". Per Halpern, subsequent efforts were made to cooperate with the Orthodox, but a letter from eleven Rosh Yeshivas was circulated declaring that Orthodox rabbis were forbidden to cooperate with Conservative rabbis (\"Proceedings of the CJLS of the Conservative Movement 1927-1970\" Vol. II, pp. 850–852).\n\nUntil the 1950s, Jews of all denominations were generally allowed to use the same communal mikvaot (ritual baths) for the purposes of converting to Judaism, observing the rules of niddah in regard to laws of marital purity, ritually cleansing dishes, etc. However the Ultra-Orthodox movement increasingly denied the use of mikvaot to non-Orthodox rabbis for use in conversions. According to Rabbi Walter Wurzburger, Rav Soloveitchik counselled Orthodox rabbis against this practice, insisting that non-Orthodox have the option to use mikvaot (Wurzburger, 1994).\n\nSoloveitchik was the pre-eminent leader of politically conscious pro-Zionist modern Orthodox Judaism. Out of respect for his stature, many leaders and politicians from Israel sought his advice and blessings in state affairs. Reputedly, he was offered the position of Chief Rabbi of Israel by Prime Minister Ben Gurion, but quietly declined. Despite his open and ardent support for the modern State of Israel, he only visited Israel - then called Palestine - once, in 1935, before the state was established. Rabbi Yosef Blau has written that Soloveitchik's non-messianic Zionism was philosophically similar to that of Rabbi Yitzchak Yaacov Reines (see \"Tradition\" 33.2, Communications).\n\nOn Yom ha-Atzma'ut (Israel's Independence Day), 1956, Soloveitchik delivered a public address at Yeshiva University entitled: Kol Dodi Dofek; The Voice of My Beloved Knocks. The address, which has become a classic of religious Zionist philosophy, enumerates, and elaborates upon, the instances of God's tangible presence in the recent history of the Jewish people and the State of Israel. It also issues a clarion call to American Orthodoxy to embrace the State of Israel, and to commit itself and its resources to its development.\n\nIn his early career in America, Soloveitchik joined with the traditional movements such as Agudath Israel of America and the \"Agudat Harabanim\" - the Union of Orthodox Rabbis of North America. In fact, Soloveitchik was on the first Moetzes Chachmei HaTorah of America. However, he later removed himself from the former organizations, and instead joined with the \"Mizrachi\" Religious Zionists of America (RZA) and became Chairman of the centrist Orthodox Rabbinical Council of America's (RCA) Halakhah Commission (the other two members are the time were Rabbis Hayyim Heller and Samuel Belkin).\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, until his wife's death in 1967, Soloveitchik and some of his students would spend summers near Cape Cod in Onset, Massachusetts, where they would pray at Congregation Beth Israel.\n\nAfter the passing of his wife in 1967, Soloveitchik began giving additional lectures, open to the public, during the summer months in Boston.\n\nSoloveitchik's daughters married prominent academics and Talmudic scholars: his daughter Tovah married the late Rabbi Dr. Aharon Lichtenstein, former Rosh Yeshiva of Yeshivat Har Etzion in Israel (who had a PhD in English Literature from Harvard University); his daughter Atarah married the late Rabbi Dr. Isadore Twersky, former head of the Jewish Studies department at Harvard University (who also served as the Talner Rebbe in Boston). His son Rabbi Dr. Haym Soloveitchik is a University Professor of Jewish History at Yeshiva University. His siblings included Dr. Samuel Soloveichik (1909-1967), Rabbi Ahron Soloveichik (1917-2001), Mrs. Shulamith Meiselman (1912-2009), and Mrs. Anne Gerber (1915-2011). His grandchildren have maintained his heritage and also hold distinguished scholarly positions.\n\nAs he got older he suffered several bouts of serious illness (Alzheimer's Disease preceded by Parkinson's Disease).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8458409", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8458409", "title": "Makkhali Gosala", "text": "Makkhali Gosala\n\nMakkhali Gosala (Pāli; BHS: Maskarin Gośāla; Jain Prakrit sources: Gosala Mankhaliputta) or Manthaliputra Goshalak was an ascetic teacher of ancient India. He was a contemporary of Siddhartha Gautama, the founder of Buddhism, and of Mahavira, the last and 24th Tirthankara of Jainism.\n\nDetails about Gosala's life are sparse. All of the available information about Gosala and about the Ājīvika movement generally comes from Buddhist and Jain sources. As Gosala's teachings appear to have been rivals of those of the Buddhist and Jain leaders of his day, this information is regarded by most scholars as being overtly influenced and coloured by sectarian hostilities.\n\nTwo primary sources describe Gosala's life and teaching: the Jain Bhagavati Sutra, and Buddhaghosa's commentary on the Buddhist Sammannaphala Sutta. The Bhagavati Sutra goes into detail about the career of Makkhali Gosala and his relationship with Mahavira; the Sammannaphala Sutra itself mentions Makkhali in passing as one of six leading teachers of philosophy of the Buddha's day, and Buddhaghosa's commentary provides additional details about his life and teaching.\n\nAccording to the \"Bhagavati Sutra\", Gosala was in the village of Saravana, a name meaning 'thicket of reeds'. His mother's name is given as 'Bhadda', a name used in many Jaina sources to refer to the unknown mother of some mythological figure, while his father's name is given as Mankhali. Gosala's father was said to be employed as a \"mankha\", a somewhat obscure class of mendicant or ascetic that seems to have been occupied with carrying an image of a god or goddess, and with singing religious songs.\n\nThe name 'Gosala' literally means 'cow shed', and both the Bhagavati Sutra and Buddhaghosa claim that Gosala was so named because he was born in a cow shed, his parents being unable to find more suitable lodgings in the village of Saravana. The Bhagavati Sutra reports that Gosala went on to follow his father's profession, becoming a \"mankha\". Meanwhile, Buddhaghosa claims that Gosala was born into slavery, and became a naked ascetic after fleeing from his irate master, who managed to grab hold of Gosala's garment and disrobe him as he fled. While it is possible that the broad outlines of Gosala's birth story or early life are correct—that he was born into poverty in a cowshed—it may be equally likely that these versions of his early life were concocted by Buddhist and Jain partisans to bring a rival teacher into disrepute.\n\nThe philosopher's true name seems to have been Maskarin, the Jaina Prakrit form of which is Mankhali and the Pāli form Makkhali. \"Maskarin\" is explained by Pāninī (VI.i.154) as \"one who carries a bamboo staff\" (maskara). A Maskarin is also known as Ekadandin. According to Patañjali (Mahābhāsya iii.96), the name indicates a School of Wanderers who were called Maskarins, not so much because they carried a bamboo staff as because they taught \"Don't perform actions, don't perform actions, quietism (alone) is desirable to you\". The Maskarins were thus fatalists or determinists.\n\nThe Bhagavati Sutra states that Gosala became Mahavira's disciple three years after the start of Mahavira's asceticism, and travelled with him for the next six years. A commentary to the Jain Avasyaka Sutra provides details of these six years of association, many of them reflecting poorly on Gosala- another likely indication of sectarian bias. Several incidents in the narrative show Mahavira making predictions that then come true, despite Gosala's repeated attempts to foil them. These incidents were likely included in the narrative to provide motivation for Gosala's later belief in the inevitability of fate. Some of these incidents may in fact have been adapted from Ajivika sources but recast by Jaina chroniclers.\n\nAnother possible adaptation of an Ajivika story is found in Mahavira's explanation of the end of the association between himself and Gosala, recorded in the Bhagavati Sutra. On coming to a plant by the roadside, Gosala asked Mahavira what the fate of the plant and its seeds would be. Mahavira stated that the plant would grow to fruition, and the seed pods would grow into new plants. Determined to foil his master's prediction, Gosala returned to the plant at night and uprooted it. Later, a sudden rain shower caused the plant to revive and re-root itself. Upon approaching the plant again later, Gosala claimed to Mahavira that he would find his prophecy to have been foiled. Instead, it was found that the plant and its seeds had developed exactly as predicted by Mahavira. Gosala was so impressed by the reanimation of the plant that he became convinced that all living things were capable of such reanimation. The terms used in the story of the Bhagavati Sutra for reanimation mimic a technical term for reanimation of the dead that is also found elsewhere in Ajivika doctrine. Mahavira disagreed with this thesis, and this seems to have been the cause of the separation of the two ascetics. Mahavira is, however, later depicted as having rescued Gosala from an attack by an enraged renunciant using magical powers acquired through the practice of austerities; this is claimed to motivate Gosala's pursuit of the same sort of magical powers.\n\nA. L. Basham dates the death of Gosala in 484 BC on the basis of \"Mahavamsa\".\n\nGosala appears briefly as a \"cameo\" character in the 1981 Gore Vidal novel \"Creation\", a fictional account of the Persian Wars of the 5th century BC, told from the perspective of a widely travelled Persian diplomat, Cyrus Spitama, who is depicted as the grandson of Zoroaster and boyhood friend of Xerxes I. In early adulthood, thanks to his facility with languages, Cyrus is appointed by King Darius I as the Persian ambassador to the kingdoms of India. While travelling across the Subcontinent, Cyrus stops at the city of Mathura, where he is accosted by the Jain sage, who lectures Cyrus about his views on the inevitability of fate, and his disagreements with Mahavira.\n\n'Khanti Kikatia' is a novel focused on the life of Makkhali Gosala. Hindi novelist Ashwini Kumar Pankaj wrote this and it is in the Magahi language. In this novel, the author presented the life and philosophy of the Makkhali in a very authentic and live manner.\n\n\n"}

Her thesis was on the concept of mixture in quantum mechanics. Before taking her current appointments, she taught at the University of Maryland, Stanford University and the London School of Economics. She has held visiting appointments at the University of Oslo, Princeton University, Caltech, the University of Pittsburgh, the University of Cambridge and UCLA. She is currently Tsing Hua Honorary Distinguished Chair Professor at the National Tsing Hua University in Taiwan and Visiting Research Fellow at Ca' Foscari University in Venice. She co-founded the Centre for Philosophy of Natural and Social Science (CPNSS) at the LSE and the Centre for Humanities Engaging Science and Society (CHESS) at the University of Durham.\n\nCartwright has mentored several students in England and the United States who have gone on to become professional philosophers of science, including Naomi Oreskes, Carl Hoefer, Mauricio Suarez, Andrew Hamilton, Julian Reiss, Roman Frigg, Gabriele Contessa, Anna Alexandrova, Leah McClimans, Jacob Stegenga, Jeremy Howick, Marta Halina, Joyce Havstad, Sindhuja Bhakthavatsalam, Peter Menzies, Martin Thomson-Jones, Matt Brown, Hasok Chang, Jordi Cat, Sophia Efstathiou, Sang Wook Yi, Towfic Shomar and Szu-Ting Chen.

She has two daughters, Emily and Sophie Hampshire Cartwright, and a granddaughter, Lucy Charlton.\n\nCartwright's approach to the philosophy of science is associated with the \"Stanford School\" of Patrick Suppes, John Dupré, Peter Galison and Ian Hacking. It is characterized by an emphasis on scientific practice as opposed to abstract scientific theories. Cartwright has made important contributions to debates on laws of nature, causation and causal inference, scientific models in the natural and social sciences, objectivity and the unity of science. Her recent work focuses on evidence and its use in informing policy decisions.\n\nCarl Hoefer describes Cartwright's philosophy in the following terms:\n\nNancy Cartwright’s philosophy of science is, in her view, a form of empiricism but empiricism in the style of Neurath and Mill, rather than of Hume or Carnap. Her concerns are not with the problems of skepticism, induction, or demarcation; she is concerned with how actual science achieves the successes it does, and what sort of metaphysical and epistemological presuppositions are needed to understand that success.\n\nCartwright, like many working scientists themselves, takes a rather pragmatic/realist stance toward observations and interventions made by scientists and engineers and particularly toward their connections to causality: Scientists see impurities causing signal loss in a cable, and they stimulate an inverted population, causing it to lase. Given these starting points, there can be no question of a skeptical attitude toward causation, in either singular or generic form. The fundamental role (or better, roles) played by causation in scientific practice is undeniable; what Cartwright does, then, is reconfigure empiricism from the ground up based on this insight. In the reconfiguration process, many mainstays of the received view of science take a beating; especially [...] the fundamentality of laws of nature.\n\nCartwright served as the president of the Philosophy of Science Association (2009–10) and as vice-president (2007–8) and president (2008–9) of the Pacific Division of the American Philosophical Association. She is Professor Emeritus at the London School of Economics. She is also Fellow of the British Academy and member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina. She has received honorary degrees from Southern Methodist University and the University of St Andrews as well as a MacArthur Fellowship. \n\nIn 2016, Cartwright was elected a Fellow of the Academy of Social Sciences (FAcSS).\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "17449489", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17449489", "title": "Objective precision", "text": "Objective precision\n\nIn philosophy and second scholasticism, objective precision (Latin \"praecisio obiectiva\") is the \"objective\" aspect of abstraction. Objective precision is the process by which certain features (the differentiae) of the real object of a formal concept are excluded from the comprehension of that concept; the object is thus being intentionally transformed into a universal objective concept. Objective precision is thus a process by which universal objective concepts arise. It is the \"objective\" aspect of the process of (total) abstraction or concept-formation.\n\nObjective precision is distinguished against formal precision. Whereas objective precision is a process on the part of objective \"concepts\" (the objective correlates of the mental acts by means of which something is being conceived) formal precision is the corresponding process on the part of formal concepts or the mental \"acts\" themselves. Objective and formal precision are the two aspects (objective and subjective) of abstraction.\n\nThe two opposing philosophical views on universals, nominalism (or rather conceptualism) and realism can be defined by means of their relation to objective precision: anyone who accepts objective precision, is a philosophical realist; anyone who rejects it, is a conceptualist or nominalist (in a broad sense). In other words, the nominalists reject the idea that our universal mental concepts (formal concepts) require universal intentional objects; thus, according to nominalists, in abstraction only formal precision takes place, no objective precision.\n\nThe schools are divided in their opinion what constitutes the necessary condition on the part of the object in order that objective precision be possible. According to the Thomists a virtual distinction on the part of the object between the excluded differentia and the arising abstracted objective concept is sufficient to make objective precision possible. According to the Scotists, a formal distinction is generally required, although certain Scotists (like Bartolomeo Mastri) regard virtual distinction as sufficient in certain special cases. Suárez defends objective precision but he rejects any distinctions on the part of the object. The nominalists (conceptualists) agree with the Scotists that a formal distinction would be necessary to enable objective precision, but since they regard such a distinction as impossible, they reject objective precision altogether.\n"}
{"id": "2750251", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2750251", "title": "Operation Cauldron", "text": "Operation Cauldron\n\nOperation Cauldron was a series of secret biological warfare trials undertaken by the British government in 1952. Scientists from Porton Down and the Royal Navy were involved in releasing biological agents, including pneumonic and bubonic plague, brucellosis and tularaemia and testing the effects of the agents on caged monkeys and guinea pigs.\n\nThe experiments were carried out at sea, off the coast of the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides, aboard a floating pontoon, supported by the ship \"Ben Lomond\". The test animals were placed in cages on the deck of the pontoon and biological agents dispersed either from a bomb suspended from a boom or by being sprayed. After being exposed, the animals were taken aboard the \"Ben Lomond\" and those that died were dissected to determine the cause of death. 3,492 guinea pigs and 83 monkeys were used in the tests.\n\nThe tests were initially judged to be a success, both in terms of the effectiveness of the biological agents and the test platform. However, a year later, this decision was reversed, with the tests on plague bacteria being described as a \"failure\" and the statement that \"brucellosis has not increased its reputation as a dangerous agent.\"\n\nIn the final test of the series, the Fleetwood-based trawler \"Carella\", with a crew of eighteen, ignored warnings to steer clear and unwittingly sailed through a cloud of plague bacteria (\"Yersinia pestis\") on its return from a fishing trip to the waters around Iceland, causing concern about a possible plague outbreak around its home port in north-west England. The \"Carella\" was not stopped for disinfection or medical examination but was kept under covert observation by a destroyer and a fisheries vessel for twenty-one days, and the ship's radio communications were monitored for any kind of medical distress call. The surveillance period included a period of shore-leave at Blackpool, during which the crew mixed with the people of the town as usual. None of the crew became ill.\n\nThe incident was dealt with at the highest levels of government, going through the First Sea Lord to the Chancellor of the Exchequer Rab Butler, who was deputising for the absent Winston Churchill. The event was successfully covered up and, after the danger had passed, most of the documents relevant to the case were ordered to be burnt.\nEven the crew of the \"Carella\" were unaware of the incident until approached by a BBC documentary crew more than fifty years later.\n\nIn 1994, the local Member of Parliament, Calum Macdonald called upon the then-Secretary of State for Defence, Malcolm Rifkind, to commission an independent report on Operations Cauldron and Hesperus in 1952 and 1953, and all similar chemical weapons tests \"about which the public reasonably seek reassurance.\" An initial Commons question by him to the Ministry Of Defence was referred to the director-general of the Chemical and Biological Defence Establishment at Porton Down, Wiltshire.\n\nIn his letter, Dr Pearson said: \"The papers on Operations Cauldron and Hesperus are classified, and it would not be in the natioinal interest to make these available as the information therein could be misused by states seeking to acquire a biological weapons capability.\n\n\"The pathogens used were as follows: (a) Operation Cauldron: the pathogens that cause brucellosis and plague. (b) Operation Hesperus: the pathogens that cause brucellosis and tularaemia.\" Dr Pearson added: \"The safety aspects of handling, transport and\npackaging were all carefully addressed to ensure there was no danger to any of those engaged in the trial.\n\n\"There is no cause to believe that there was any hazard to the public or the environment and there is no evidence to the contrary.\n\nMr MacDonald responded at the time saying: \"This reply is deeply unsatisfactory and does not provide any of the reassurances which I and my constituents seek about the tests.\"\n\nHe continued to outline his belief that it was not satisfactory that the same Government organisation which carried out \"potentially highly dangerous experiments\" should be allowed to pass the final judgment on itself regarding the health implications both then and subsequently.\n\nOn the 21st of January 2008 the Information Commissioner's Office ruled against the MOD to release a video they made on Operation Cauldron.\nThe video contains images of identifiable individuals, and the MOD argued that it would need to obscure or mask the faces of the individuals, as this information would be exempt under sections 38, 40(2) and 44 of the Act. The MOD estimated that the process of masking would exceed the cost limit as set out in section 12 of the Act, and therefore refused the complainant’s request. The Commissioner found that the footage did contain images of identifiable individuals, some of whom may still be alive, but that disclosure of the footage would not breach any of the data protection principles. For this reason the Commissioner found that the MOD wrongly applied the exemption under sections 38, 40(2) and 44, and the cost limit under section 12. The Commissioner therefore directed the MOD to disclose the footage in full.\n\nThe video released was about 47 minutes long and showed the pontoon which was situated off the coast of the Tolsta District on the North East of the Isle of Lewis. The exact location was between Cellar head and Tolsta head. Many of the Tolsta villagers can remember the ship and seeing white gas clouds in the testing. The video shows a flight coming in and describes the arrival of the biological agents from the Microbiological Research Department (MRD) at Porton Down. On the pontoon they placed the animals in small boxes and released the agents, before returning after to check the results and burning the dead animals.\n"}

Because Eve had complied with the request of Congress and allowed Revere to pass through his powder manufactory, thus allowing him to obtain sufficient information that enabled him to set up a powder mill at Canton, Eve petitioned Congress for a reward:\nIn Committee of Safety, Philadelphia, May 3, 1776.\n\nSIR: This Committee having considered the petition of Mr. Oswell Eve, are of opinion it should be laid before the honourable Congress; and they take the liberty of sending it to you for that purpose; at the same time, they certify that Mr. Eve has at different times, upon the recommendation of this Board, shown his works and improvements to such gentlemen as were appointed from this and the neighbouring Colonies to view the same.\n\nI am, sir, your most obedient, humble servant,\n\nJOHN NIXON, Chairman.\n\nTo the Honourable John Hancock, Esq.\nThe Powder-Mill on Frankford Creek became the working model that was studied by all the other colonies for building their own mills in the production of gunpowder. When the British occupied Philadelphia in September 1777, they took over the mill, and it was rumored that Eve cooperated. On March 6, 1778, the Supreme Executive Council found Eve found guilty of treason for trading with the British, but he was allowed to leave the city when the British evacuated in Spring 1778, leaving his son Oswell Jr. in charge of the mill. However, on July 6, 1778, all his property, including the powder mills and , were confiscated.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Revolution, Eve fled with his wife to Nassau, Bahamas, where he died in his son Joseph's house in New Providence in 1793.\n\nEve was married to Anne Moore in Christ Church, Philadelphia on June 2, 1744.

Usually, a small amount of lateness is acceptable; this is commonly about ten or fifteen minutes in Western cultures, but this is not the case in such instances as doctor's appointments or school lessons. In some cultures, such as Japanese society, and settings, such as military ones, expectations may be much stricter.\n\nSome cultures have an unspoken understanding that actual deadlines are different from stated deadlines, for example with Africa time. For example, it may be understood in a particular culture that people will turn up an hour later than advertised. In this case, since everyone understands that a 9 pm party will actually start at around 10 pm, no-one is inconvenienced when everyone arrives at 10 pm.\n\nIn cultures which value punctuality, being late is seen as disrespectful of others' time and may be considered insulting. In such cases, punctuality may be enforced by social penalties, for example by excluding low-status latecomers from meetings entirely. Such considerations can lead on to considering the value of punctuality in econometrics and to considering the effects of non-punctuality on others in queueing theory.\n\n\n"}

Richta was born in Prague.\n\nRichta's first work was \"Člověk a technika v revoluci našich dnů\" (\"Man and Technology in the Revolution of Our Day\"), published in 1963. This work did much to bring the concept of technology into the forefront of philosophical thought during the 1960s. Richta then went on to publish \"Civilizace na rozcestí\" (\"Civilization at the Crossroads\") in 1966. \"Crossroads\" was a compilation work published by 60 authors (including and led by Richta) that \"attempt[ed] to analyze the social and human implications of the scientific and technological revolution\". The concepts touched on in \"Crossroads\" are considered by some philosophical historians to be very ground-breaking for their time.\n\nRichta developed the famous term of \"Socialism with a human face\" serving as a motto of the Prague Spring period. He became the director of the Institute for Philosophy and Sociology of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences (\"ČSAV - Československá akademie věd\") in 1969 - 1982.\n\nDuring World War II, Richta organized a resistance movement against the Nazis, and his organization became part of the communist resistance in the critical moment of the worst persecution (or man-hunting). Richta was arrested and held prisoner for several months. He was saved by the Swiss Red Cross when they collected prisoners with the worst cases of tuberculosis and extracted them to Switzerland. Shortly after the rescue Ritcha's former fellow prisoners were executed on May 2, 1945.\n\nAfter the war Richta became quite ill, and beginning in 1958 he periodically spent time in sanatoria. In between bouts of sickness, and in a compromise with his doctors who prescribed complete bed rest, Richta studied and worked very hard.\n\nIn the 1960s Richta took on the role of the leader of an interdisciplinary research team. In 1963 they released their first works - \"Člověk a technika v revoluci našich dnů\" (\"Man and technology in the revolution of our days\") and \"Komunismus a proměny lidského života\" (K povaze humanismu naší doby) (\"Communism and changes of human life.

It is a pamphlet in Italian published in Cairo in 1884 (Typo Lithographe Franco-Egyptienne J. Serrière) under the title Di una Teorica di Analisi Logica (An Investigation of Analytical Logic). The work is an interesting disputation on technical points of some aspects of symbolic logic, also called mathematical logic. The tone used is friendly. If the disputation ever took place (it might be supposed), it was between two friends in the professional spirit of academic collaboration and amity. Perhaps this is an inherent message which Debono also wanted to get through to his readers. Nevertheless, Debono mentions a certain S. Frendo as his interlocutor, who might have been a language professor at the Italian public schools of Cairo.\n\nAfter an introduction, the work is divided into three parts, amongst which the first is the most substantial and important. The first part bears the name \"Pro Veritate\" (For Truth). Debono refutes certain positions of analytic logic held by his colleague. Debono seems to imply that the positions were exposed in an earlier publication by Frendo.\n\nThe other two parts of the work successively refer to a letter which Debono had written (perhaps in some newspaper), and to Frendo’s publication. Few other details are provided to get at the bottom of the story. Nevertheless, the style and argumentation of the work is intriguing.

{"id": "17228962", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17228962", "title": "Referring expression", "text": "Referring expression\n\nIn linguistics, a referring expression (RE) is any noun phrase, or surrogate for a noun phrase, whose function in discourse is to identify some individual object. The technical terminology for \"identify\" differs a great deal from one school of linguistics to another. The most widespread term is probably \"refer\", and a thing identified is a \"referent\", as for example in the work of John Lyons. In linguistics, the study of reference relations belongs to pragmatics, the study of language use, though it is also a matter of great interest to philosophers, especially those wishing to understand the nature of knowledge, perception and cognition more generally.\n\nVarious devices can be used for reference including determiners, pronouns, proper names. Reference relations can be of different kinds; referents can be in a \"real\" or imaginary world, or in discourse itself, and they may be singular, plural, or collective.\n\nThe kinds of expressions which can refer are:\n\n\nReferring can take place in a number of ways. Typically, in the case of (1), the RE is likely to succeed in picking out the referent because the words in the expression and the way they are combined together give a true, accurate, description of the referent, in such a way that the hearer of the expression can recognize the speaker's intention. In the first example, if the hearer knows what an apple and a table are, and understands the relation expressed by \"on\", and is aware that \"the\" is a signal that an individual thing or person is intended, they can build up the meaning of the expression from the words and grammar and use it to identify an intended object (often within sight, or at any rate easily recoverable, but not necessarily).\n\nThe speaker may use a mistaken description and still manage to refer successfully. If the speaker asks the hearer to \"Take this plate to the woman with the glass of vodka\", the hearer may take it to the intended person even if, unbeknownst to the speaker, the vodka is really water. On the other hand, the speaker may be accurate in calling it vodka, but the hearer may believe wrongly that it is water, and therefore not deliver the plate. Accurate reference is then not a guarantee of successful reference, and successful reference does not wholly depend on accurate reference. There is, however, a strong positive correlation between them.\n\nProper names, on the other hand, generally achieve reference irrespective of the meaning of the words which constitute them (if any are recognizable). If a local pub is called \"The Anchor\", this is simply a label which functions conversationally with no appeal to the meaning of the words. If someone says, \"I'm going to the Anchor\", they do not mean \"I'm going to the device for halting and securing a ship\", and the hearer will not necessarily call such a device to mind when I say this. \"The Anchor\" just serves to identify a particular building. This point is more obvious still with those names like \"Sarah\" and \"London\" which have no lexical meaning of their own.\n\nIn addition to the singular and plural reference (in many languages grammatically obvious), linguists typically distinguish individual or specific reference, exemplified by each case presented so far, from generic reference, where a singular expression picks out a type of object rather than an individual one, as in The bear is a dangerous animal\". Plural expressions can, of course, be interpreted in the same way, as in Bears are dangerous animals\".\n\nDefinite reference to single individuals is usually taken to be the prototypical type of reference.\n\nOther types of reference recognized by linguists include \"indefinite\" as opposed to \"definite reference\", and \"collective\" and \"distributive reference\". Definite referring expressions refer to an identifiable individual or class (\"The Dalai Lama\"; \"The Coldstream Guards\"; \"the student with the highest marks\"), whilst indefinite referring expressions allow latitude in identifying the referent (\"a corrupt Member of Parliament\"; \"a cat with black ears\"—where \"a\" is to be interpreted as 'any' or 'some actual but unspecified'). Collective reference is the picking out of the members of a set as a set, whilst distributive reference is the picking out of the members of a set individually. The difference may not be marked linguistically, but arrived at by interpretation in context. Compare \"Manchester United won again today\" (where the reference of \"Manchester United\" is to members of the team as a unit), with \"Manchester United wear red shirts and black shorts\" (where the reference of \"Manchester United\" is to the team members as individuals). English allows such expressions to be ambiguous: compare \"Manchester United are rich beyond my wildest dreams.\"\n\nDenotation is the relation existing between a lexical item and a set of potential referents in some world. Reference is the relation between some expression and actual referents (subject to the technical restriction given above). The word \"rabbit\" denotes the entire class of objects that are classified with this term, whilst the RE \"my rabbit\" will generally refer, on a particular occasion of usage, to the one individual in my possession. Generally speaking, lexical items have denotation, whilst phrases have the job of doing reference in real situations. This distinction is not systematically made by some linguists.\n\nREs carry a presupposition of the existence of the referent(s), in some universe of discourse, including fictional universes.\n\nThere are many other technical issues surrounding the nature of reference. Some of these are discussed from the perspective of linguistics in Lyons (1977, vol. I: chapter 7); Cann (1993: chapters 9 and 10); Saeed (1997: chapters 2, 7, 11). There is a vast literature on the topic in philosophy.\n\nReferring expression generation (REG) is the subtask of natural language generation (NLG) that receives most scholarly attention. While NLG is concerned with the conversion of non-linguistic information into natural language, REG focuses only on the creation of referring expressions (noun phrases) that identify specific entities called \"targets\" by describing their attributes that are most distinct from those of the \"distractors\".\n\n"}

Rumor control centers, which often operate call centers, respond to crisis situations such as terrorist attacks, natural disasters, or civil disturbances.\n\nThe well-developed crisis control centers established during the Cold War were among the earlier examples of effective rumor control mechanisms. In the United States, during the civil rights movement, rumor control centers were set up and operated with the assistance of the Community Relations Service (CRS), a \"peacemaker\" agency created by the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Rumor control centers have been established in the United States at different levels of governance, including municipal, regional, state-wide and national. Permanent rumor control centers serve a specific, local population, and have often been set up in response to specific incidents.\n\nSocial media makes it easier for rumors to spread, and more difficult for rumor control and fake news to be managed. By 2018, \"rumor cascades\" were under investigation as stories with serious inaccuracies were spread by millions of people.\" \n\nAccording to a 2004 article by Heidi Burgess and Michelle Maiese, rumors—\"knowledge gaps\" with \"serious inaccuracies\" or \"misinformation—can drive the cycle of destructive escalation\" and contribute to making situations more disruptive. These rumors can be spread \"through the mass media—television, radio, newspapers, and the Internet.\" First, Brugess and Maisse list three phases of a rumor control process. The first step requires a mechanism through which trusted, trained \"rumor agents\"—usually those experienced and active in conflict resolution—identify the most recent rumors in circulation. The second step requires a strategy for establishing the truth and/or falsehood of the rumors. These \"rumor investigators\" may also be rumor reporters. Thirdly, there is a need for mechanisms whereby the inaccurate reports can be replaced with reliable information.\n\nThe Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Nieman Lab cited a \"Science\" report by MIT researchers that by March 2018, \"fake news both reached more people than the truth and spread faster than the truth.\" The MIT researchers based their conclusions on \"126,000 \"rumor cascades\" spread by about 3 million people\".\n\nSince 2007, Facebook has made attempts to combat rumor cascades by partnering with independent, third-party fact-checkers to identify inaccurate news stories, and to flag them with warning labels to caution users before sharing them.\n\nFEMA created the Hurricane Florence Rumor Control and the Hurricane Michael Rumor Control centers in response to the rumors surrounding Hurricane Florence and Hurricane Michael.\n\nBrugess and Maisse described the Cold War crisis control centers as the \"best-developed examples of rumor control mechanisms.\" They were \"confidence-building measures aimed to prevent incomplete information about the actions of opposing military forces from escalating into a violent and dangerous confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union\". In his 1983 publication, \"Beyond the Hotline: Crisis Control to Prevent Nuclear War\", William L. Ury described how a crisis control system was created during the Cold War, \"jointly staffed by U.S. and Soviet military and diplomatic officers.\" A hotline was established, which provided \"direct\" and \"immediate\" communication to alleviate some of the \"above-normal risk of nuclear war\" through \"notification procedures for accidental missile launches\".\n\nRumor control centers were established during the civil rights movement in the United States using Community Relations Service (CRS) mediators, who provided reliable telephone numbers, (early call centers), where new rumors could be reported, assessed and the results of the assessment accessed. The trusted rumor agents were either CRS, police departments, city officials, or \"people with authority.\" In a 1999 interview, Manuel Salinas, who served as mediator for CRS from 1968 to 1988, said, \nThe first rumor center in the United States was established in July 1967 by the City of Chicago. \"An ofﬁce was equipped with a radio, television and type-writer, and a large map of the city hung on one of the walls. Ten telephone lines were also installed, including direct lines to the Police Department and Mayor's Ofﬁce. Local government ofﬁcials encouraged citizens to call the Center if they heard a \"rumor\"—defined as information unveriﬁed by ofﬁcial sources—that suggested social tensions in the city were increasing. The Seattle Rumor Center was established by the \"citizen-directed\" State Council of Churches, in response to the rise of racial tension in 1968. The Rumor Center was operated \"to stop the spread of rumors that might cause tension, panic or bring harm to an individual or group of persons, particularly in situations involving race relations.\" The Center closed in 1973 \"because the need had changed and government agencies had developed methods for dealing with rumor control.\" \n\nBy the end of the 1960s, a hundred cities across the United States had established RCCs. Local government, the private sector, and volunteers funded and operated the RCCs.\n\nOn the eve of the Iraq War in the early 2000s, rumors and inaccuracies spread in the U.S. regarding weapons of mass destruction (WMD), including the false information, now known as the Niger uranium forgeries, regarding Iraq's attempted uranium purchase from Niger. According to Burgess and Maiese, the Niger rumor, \"was one of the many reasons\" \"the U.S. administration decided that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, or at least the ability to make them. This rumor later proved to be false, as did most of the other \"facts\" surrounding Iraq's WMD program. While the problems that led to the Iraq war were deeper than simple rumors, rumor control efforts might have played a significant role in slowing down the U.S.'s march to war\".\n\nThe United States Community Relations Service (part of the Department of Justice) uses rumor control teams when mediating domestic racial conflicts.\n\nThe Community Relations Service (CRS) was created by the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as a \"peacemaker\" to respond to potential ethnic or racial disputes that might result from the Act. Among other things, the CRS, \"worked with law enforcement, city officials, and community members to establish rumor control mechanisms to prevent the spread of false and inflammatory information.\"\n\nHeidi Burgess and Guy Burgess, directors and founders of the Conflict Information Consortium (CIC) based at the University of Colorado, continue to edit and direct the \"Beyond Intractability Knowledge Base Project\" (BI) website as an extension of the CRInfo website.\n\nThe U.S. had rumor control agencies at the national, state, regional, county, and municipal levels.\n\nAccording to their report, the CRS collaborates with individual states, local government agencies, public and private entities, and community organizations to \"develop local capacity to prevent racial and ethnic tensions.\" CRS conciliators initiate \"rumor control to prevent misinformation from spreading throughout a community\". The DOJ says that the CRS continues to work with officials at the municipal and state level, including law enforcement, and community organizers to help coordinate \"safe marches and protests through rumor control mechanisms, self-marshal training, logistical planning, and on-site mediation services\".\nIn 2009, when the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act was passed, which expanded the 1969 United States federal hate-crime law, the CRS's mandate \"expanded to include assisting communities in preventing and responding to alleged violent hate crimes committed on the basis of \"actual or perceived race, color, national origin, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, and disability.\"\nIn his book describing the CRS history from 1964 to 1989, Bertram J. Levine described how a Rumor Control Center was set up in preparation for the May Day 1970 massive protest of the New Haven Black Panther trials on the New Haven Green near both the courthouse and Yale University. Then-FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover wrote that the purpose of counterintelligence action—COINTELPRO (1956–1971)—is to disrupt the Black Panther Party and it is immaterial whether facts exist to substantiate the charge.\" \n\nJack Middleton—a \"seasoned community relations professional\" with training in setting up and running an RCC—had helped design and operate a New Haven community-based RCC specifically for the 1970 protest. Levine said that the RCC—operated by Yale Divinity School volunteers in close collaboration with municipal information sources including local police—was a \"textbook\" example of an RCC run by a private organization. Middleton's manual on RCCs served as a template across the United States for many years. Levine said that the RCCs \"played a vital role in limiting chaos during civil disorders.\"\n\nThe Iowa Department of Homeland Security has public emergency information distribution plans which include rumor control centers \n\nThe city of Baltimore, Maryland has a permanent Rumor Control Center.\n\nAlachua County, Florida has a Rumor Control Center which was activated in 1990, after the serial murders of five local college students .\n\nThe City of Coral Springs, Florida maintains a Rumor Central page. \n\nSocial media makes it easier for rumors to spread, and more difficult for rumor control to be managed. By 2018, \"rumor cascades\" were under investigation as stories with serious inaccuracies were spread by millions of people (Vosoughi et al 2018:1146).\"\n\nBy 2013, research rumor spreading and control was often based on models used in epidemiology, such as SI (susceptible (S), infected (I)), SIR (susceptible (S), infected (I), resistant (R)) models, and more recently, the SEIR model which includes \"the flows of people between four states: susceptible (S), exposed (E), infected (I), and resistant (R)\".\n"}

In the Vedas the accent is on the first syllable as in - \"Tṛishyā\" (to be thirsty), \"Tṛishṇākshaya\" (cessation of desire, tranquillity of mind, resignation, patience, content), \"Tṛishnāghna\" (quenching the thirst), \"Tṛishṇāmaya\" (ill with thirst), \"Tṛishṇāmāra\" (dying of thirst), \"Tṛishṇāri\" (enemy of thirst), \"Tṛishālu\" (thirsting much, very thirsty), \"Tṛishyat\" (thirsting) or \"Tṛishya\" (thirst). \n\"Trishna\" in Pali (\"tanha\") means thirst for life.\n\nThe word \"Trishna\" appears in the Rig Veda in a few mantras where it refers to greed, craving, hankering or longing, and the like. In mantra Rig Veda (I.XXXVII.6), Rishi Ghora Kanva states:\n\nHe speaks about the (unfavourable ) wind (निर्ऋतिः) which flows on greedily (तृष्णया). And, in mantra Rig Veda (I.LXXXV.11), Rishi Rahugano Gotama stating -\n\nspeaks about the wise ones craving (तृष्णजे) for opportunities to sate the thirst of those hankering (तर्पयन्त ) for knowledge.\n\nGautama Buddha said that the cause of sorrow – the second of the Four Noble Truths – is desire; and the cause of desire is \"tanha\" or \"trishna\".\n\nBuddhism teaches the doctrine of inaction, i.e. cessation of activity, desiring or doing little. The extinction of craving of the desire for existence in all its forms and the consequent cessation of suffering is Nirvana (Nirvana is grasping nothingness and possessing nothing which state is reached through the knowledge of impermanence and voidness). Vivekananda holds that the Buddhist doctrine of giving up \"trishna\" ('greed') is an offshoot of Advaita Vedanta.\n\nAccording to the \"Puranas\", \"Trishna\" is the daughter of Kamadeva or Kama, the god of love and husband of Rati; Aniruddha is her brother.Vishnu Purana tells us that \"Anrita\" ('falsehood') married his own sister, \"Nikritti\" ('immorality') and had two sons, \"Bhaya\" ('fear') and \"Naraka\" ('hell'), and two daughters, \"Maya\" ('illusion' or 'deceit') and \"Vedana\" ('torture') who again married each other. The son of \"Bhaya\" and \"Maya\" is \"Mrityu\" ('death'), and \"Dukha\" ('sorrow' or 'pain') is the son of \"Naraka\" and \"Vedana\". From \"Mrityu\" descended \"Vyadhi\" ('disease'), \" Jara\" ('decay'), \"Shoka\" ('sorrow' or 'grief'), \"Trishna\" ('desire' or 'greed') and \"Krodha\" ('anger'). \"Trishna\" ('Greediness') is the wife or mistress of \"Lobha\" ('Greed').\n\nShankara explains that the intellect (\"buddhi\") of those who perceive the Being as affected with difference of space etc., cannot be brought immediately to an intuition of the highest reality; Brahman is to be realized as attributeless. He states that even if the knowers of Brahman of themselves abstain from objects of sensual enjoyment yet the thirst (\"trishna\") caused by being addicted to sensuality in different births cannot at once be converted. Renunciation is \"brahmacāryam\" or \"stri-vishaya-tyāga\". \"Trishna\", that causes dukkha, the philosophical translation of which is unsatisfactoriness rather than pain, is immoderate desire as such; \"Trishna\" is the will-to-live.\n\nIn the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (IV.iv.6) in the passage –\n\nthe word \"Kāma\" (काम) refers to desires – the man who desires migrates, but the man who is without desires never migrates; of him who is without desires, who is free from desires, the objects of whose desire have been attained, and to whom all objects of desire are but the Self – the organs do not depart, being Brahman, he is merged in Brahman. It is held that the main fundamental Buddhist thought, Nirvana i.e. the removal of suffering by removal of \"trishna\", is an echo of the afore-cited Upanishadic doctrine of union with Brahman by the removal of \"Kāma\".\n\nThe truth is - that deeds come from \"upādāna\" (clinging to existence), \"upādāna\" comes from \"trishna\" (craving), \"trishna\" comes from \"vedana\" (torture), the perception of pain and pleasure, the desire for rest; sensation (contact with objects) brings desire for life or the will to live.\n\nIn the Bhagavad Gita(Sloka XIV.7), Krishna tells Arjuna :-\n\nHere, the word \"Rāga\" refers to attachment, and \"Trishna\", refers to the craving for what is unattained.\n\nFrom the Chandogya Upanishad (VIII.viii.5, VIII.ix.1,VIII.xii.1-3) we learn that the term \"Asura\" (आसुर) signifies the natural and impulsive ('demonical') actions of the senses which are promoted by the desire for an object of pleasure called \"Asu\" (असु), and that the term \"Deva\" (देव), which is derived from the verb \"Div\" (दिव) signifying 'illumination', stands for the functions of the senses illuminated by reason. Prajapati tells Indra that the body which is mortal because it is covered by death is the seat of the self which is immortal and bodiless; anything embodied is within the range of the desirable and the non-desirable which two aspects cannot affect one who has become unembodied. The tranquil one having become established in his own nature after rising up from his body reaches the supreme Light and becomes Brahman. Vishnugupta (Chanakya) in his Chanakya Niti tells us that \"anger is personification of \"Yama\", ('the demi-god of death'), thirst is like hellish river \"Vaitarani\", knowledge is like \"Kamadhenu\" ('the cow of plenty'), and contentment is like \"Nandanavana\" ('the garden of Indra')\".\n"}

From the perspective of Dzogchen, the mind is merely \"vāyu\" \"breath\" in the body. Thus working with \"vāyu\" and the body is paramount, while meditation on the other hand is considered contrived and conceptual.\n\nThe late Namkhai Norbu, a prominent proponent of trul khor, prefered to use the Sanskrit equivalent term, Yantra Yoga, when writing in English. Trul khor derives from the instructions of the Indian mahasiddhas who founded Vajrayana.\n\nTrul khor traditionally consists of 108 movements, including bodily movements (or dynamic asanas), incantations (or mantras), pranayama and visualizations. The flow or vinyāsa of movements are likened to prayer beads. Trul khor asanas are depicted on the walls of the Dalai Lama's summer temple of Lukhang.\n\nLung (Wylie) is equivalent to the Sanskrit vāyu.\n\nNamkhai Norbu was the first to discuss Trul Khor in English with his book on Yantra Yoga, essentially a commentary on a practical yoga manual by Vairotsana. Namkhai Norbu began dissemination of Yantra Yoga through his practical teaching and esoteric transmission of this discipline within the International Dzogchen Community which he founded post 1975 from its seat in Italy, Merigar.\n\nChaoul (2006) has begun discussion of Bon traditions of Trul Khor in English with his thesis from Rice University. In his work, Chaoul makes reference to a commentary by the famed Bonpo Dzogchen master, Shardza Tashi Gyaltsen.\n\nTenzin Wangyal Rinpoche's text \"Awakening the Sacred Body\" presents some of the basic practices of trul khor according to the Tibetan Bon tradition.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "46718164", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46718164", "title": "Tso-chan-i", "text": "Tso-chan-i\n\nThe Tso-chan-i (坐禅仪, Pinyin: Zuo-Chan-Yi, Principles of Zazen), is a short Chan Buddhist meditation manual attributed to a monk named Ch'ang-lu Tsung-tse (c. 11th century) during the Northern Song dynasty (CE 960 - 1126) which exemplifies the practice of seated meditation which aims at \"sudden\" enlightenment. According to Peter Gregory it is the \"earliest known work of its kind in the Zen tradition.\" The \"Tso-chan-i\" was later revised and expanded in 1202 by Yu Hsiang and this version was published together with Tsung-tse's monastic code (\"Pure Regulations of the Zen Preserve\"), the earliest extant Zen monastic code, which was widely circulated.\n\nIn writing the \"Principles\", Tsung-tse was influenced by the works of the Tiantai meditation master Zhiyi as well as by the \"Cultivation and Realization According to the Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment\" by Kuei-feng Tsung-mi (780-841). The \"Principles\" actually quotes large parts of Zhiyi's introduction to meditation, the \"Xiao Zhi Guan,\" showing the extent of the Tiantai influence on Chinese Chan. The 600-700 character text begins with a description of the traditional cross-legged meditation posture with eyes partially opened (criticizing Zhiyi for promoted closed eyes) and then outlines how the meditator is to watch his thoughts until his mind becomes unified:\n\nDo not think of any good or evil whatsoever. Whenever a thought occurs, be aware of it; as soon as you are aware of it, it will vanish. If you remain for a long period forgetful of objects, you will naturally become unified.\n\nUnlike the meditation works of Zhiyi, the 'Principles' doesn't outline a vipassana practice which leads to wisdom - prajña. This might be because the ideas of Tsung-tse seem to be related practices in the Chan chronicle \"Leng-ch'ieh shih-tzu chi\" and to the teachings of the East Mountain Teaching, who taught that in quieting the mind one would be able to see one's innate Buddha nature and that this was a form of sudden enlightenment. This teaching is also related to the concept of Tathatā or 'Suchness' which is derived from the Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana. Tsung-tse uses a well known metaphor to describe how practicing his kind of samadhi will lead the discovery of inherent wisdom already present in the mind:\n\nTo seek the pearl, we should still the waves; if we disturb the water, it will be hard to get. When the water of meditation is clear, the pearl of the mind will appear of itself. Therefore, the Perfect Enlightenment Sutra says, \"Unimpeded, immaculate wisdom always arises dependent on meditation.\n\nThe practice taught in this text seems to be at the core of the dispute in later Chan Buddhism between \"sudden\" and \"gradual\" teachings of the \"Northern and Southern schools\" illustrated in the \"Platform Sutra\". One major distinctions between the \"sudden\" and \"gradual\" approach was that the gradual was seen as a way to counteract mental hindrances while the \"sudden\" approach took metaphysical doctrines of Suchness and non-dual, inherent enlightenment as their theme and saw the practice of counteracting hindrances as counterproductive. Thus while the practice of watching the mind outlined by Tsung-tse remained a central practice in Chan into the Tang Dynasty (e.g. in the works of Zongmi: \"As soon as a thought occurs, be aware of it (\"nien ch'i chi chueh\"); as soon as you are aware of it, it will cease to exist. The profound gate of practice lies precisely here.\") other, more radical teachers such as Mazu Daoyi emphasized the \"celebration of the natural wisdom active in every thought\", the idea that \"everyday mind is the Way\" and radical new methods of practice such as the practices of shouting, spontaneous dialogue and enigmatic sayings or anecdotes. Even so, this simple and pared down style of seated meditation continued to be used by even the most iconoclastic of Chan Buddhists and laid the foundation for the practice known as \"silent illumination\" or \"Shikantaza\".\n\nIncluded in various Zen monastic codes and text collections, the \"Tso-chan-i\" was widely imitated or used as a basis for other texts such as the \"Ju-ju chu-shih tso-ch'an i\" (\"Layman Ju-ju's Principles of Meditation\", CE 1212?) and the \"Zazen gi\" by Muhon Kakushin (1207-1297). It was included in the popular Japanese Zen anthology, the \"Shibu roku\" (\"Fourfold Record\"), was quoted by Eisai in the \"Kazen gokoku ron\" and used by Dogen in his writing of the \"Fukanzazengi\" (\"Universal Promotion of the Principles of Meditation\", CE 1233).\n\n"}

As of 1 November 2014 he is a humanities professor of philosophy at Tilburg University in the Netherlands.\n\nDrees was born in the Hague on April 20, 1954, as the third child of five and the only son of Willem Drees jr (1922–1998) and Anna Erica Drees-Gescher (1922–1988). His paternal grandfather Willem Drees was the prime minister of the Netherlands from 1948 until 1958. His father was also a Netherlands politician being the party leader of the Democratic Socialists '70 from 1971 to 1977.\n\nDrees is a past-president of the European Society for the Study of Science and Theology (ESSSAT). According to Tillburg University, Drees \"was also dean of the Faculty of Theology and vice-dean of the Faculty of Humanities.\" As of 1 November 2014, he is a professor of philosophy within the Tilburg School of Humanities. \n\nDrees has been the editor and publisher of numerous books, journal articles, essays, book reviews and articles for the wider public. His books include \"Beyond the Big Bang: Quantum Cosmologies and God\" (1990), \"Religion, Science and Naturalism\" (1996), and \"Creation: From Nothing until Now\" (2002). \n\nDrees addressed the analysis of cosmology limit questions with the interpretation of the explanatory success of science. His second Fulbright grant resulted in the book - \"Religion, Science and Naturalism\" (1996). John H. Brooke, historian of science and religion, concluded a review of work of the Oxford theologian Keith Ward and Drees’s book: \"“Because he is as secure in his epistemology as in his knowledge of theoretical physics, Willem Drees should be read by all who take a scholarly interest in the discourses of ‘science and religion’. His arguments cannot be compressed into sound-bites, and that is their strength.”\" The analysis of naturalism as addressed in his \"Religious Naturalism and Science\" has remained a major component in Drees’s research. He has also paid attention in his analysis of naturalism to the understanding of human nature, with two edited volumes on anthropology and non-reductive physicalism in Dutch and one in English (2000).\n\nWilliam A. Rottschaefer argues that Drees’s naturalism is seriously flawed claiming that it is both methodologically and epistemologically naturalistic. Drees maintains while rejecting both of these that ontological naturalism offers the best account of the natural world. It also provides for a supernaturalistic understanding of religion and theology. Although naturalism is often considered to be antithetical to theology and genuine religion, Drees proposes a scientifically informed account of religion, which, he contends, is not only compatible with supernaturalism and theology but provides a better account of both.\n\nAs the Vice President for Interdisciplinary Affairs of IRAS, Drees has participated in the formulative discussions of Religious Naturalism and helped organize a conference on Human Meaning in a Technological Culture (2001). When it comes to his position on this emerging worldview, Drees, says of himself:Am I a religious naturalist? Others have used that label on me. I am not sure I like the label, as it seems to constrain, whereas I want to explore. I also have some sympathy for the naturalistic theism described above. But certainly, precisely in the attitude of exploring, I fit the naturalism referenced above. Or I at least, I hope do. Even if I am not sure whether I am a religious naturalist, I am most interested in understanding what religious naturalism might mean, may become, and will offer.\n\nJerome A. Stone in his 2008 book \"Religious Naturalism Today: The Rebirth of a Forgotten Alternative\" cites Drees as one of the leaders of the Religious Naturalism movement along with other member of IRAS – Ursula Goodenough, Karl Peters, Connie Barlow, Michael Cavanaugh and Stone himself.\n\n\n"}
