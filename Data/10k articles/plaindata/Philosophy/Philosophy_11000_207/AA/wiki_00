{"id": "1053706", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1053706", "title": "Arthur Danto", "text": "Arthur Danto\n\nArthur Coleman Danto (January 1, 1924 – October 25, 2013) was an American art critic and philosopher. He is best known for having been an influential, long-time art critic for \"The Nation\" and for his work in philosophical aesthetics and philosophy of history, though he contributed significantly to a number of fields, including the philosophy of action. His interests included thought, feeling, philosophy of art, theories of representation, philosophical psychology, Hegel's aesthetics, and the philosophers Friedrich Nietzsche and Arthur Schopenhauer.\n\nDanto was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan, January 1, 1924, and grew up in Detroit. He was raised in a Reform Jewish home. After spending two years in the Army, Danto studied art and history at Wayne University (now Wayne State University) and then pursued graduate study in philosophy at Columbia University. From 1949 to 1950, Danto studied in Paris on a Fulbright scholarship under Jean Wahl, and in 1951 returned to teach at Columbia. In 1992 he was named Johnsonian Professor Emeritus of Philosophy. He was twice awarded fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation and was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.\n\nArthur Danto argues that \"a problem is not a philosophical problem unless it is possible to imagine that its solution will consist in showing how appearance has been taken for reality.\" While science deals with empirical problems, philosophy according to Danto examines indiscernible differences that lie outside of experience.\n\nDanto \"believes that persons are essentially systems of representation.\"\n\nDanto laid the groundwork for an institutional definition of art that sought to answer the questions raised by the emerging phenomenon of twentieth-century art. The definition of the term “art” is a subject of constant contention and many books and journal articles have been published arguing over the answer to the question \"What is Art?\" Definitions can be categorized into conventional and non-conventional definitions. Non-conventional definitions take a concept like the aesthetic as an intrinsic characteristic in order to account for the phenomena of art. Conventional definitions reject this connection to aesthetic, formal, or expressive properties as essential to defining art but rather, in either an institutional or historical sense, say that “art” is basically a sociological category. In terms of classificatory disputes about art, Danto takes a conventional approach. His \"institutional definition of art\" considers whatever art schools, museums, and artists get away with, regardless of formal definitions. Danto has written on this subject in several of his recent works and a detailed treatment is to be found in \"Transfiguration of the Commonplace\".\n\nThe essay \"The Artworld\" in which Danto coined the term “artworld”, by which he meant cultural context or “an atmosphere of art theory,” first appeared in the \"Journal of Philosophy\" (1964) and has since been widely reprinted. It has had considerable influence on aesthetic philosophy and, according to professor of philosophy Stephen David Ross, \"especially upon George Dickie's institutional theory of art. Dickie defines an art work as an artifact 'which has had conferred upon it the status of candidate for appreciation by some person or persons acting in behalf of a certain social institution (the artworld)' (p. 43.)\"\n\nAccording to the \"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\", \"Danto's definition has been glossed as follows: something is a work of art if and only if (i) it has a subject (ii) about which it projects some attitude or point of view (has a style) (iii) by means of rhetorical ellipsis (usually metaphorical) which ellipsis engages audience participation in filling in what is missing, and (iv) where the work in question and the interpretations thereof require an art historical context. (Danto, Carroll) Clause (iv) is what makes the definition institutionalist. The view has been criticized for entailing that art criticism written in a highly rhetorical style is art, lacking but requiring an independent account of what makes a context art historical, and for not applying to music.\"\n\nThe basic meaning of the term \"art\" has changed several times over the centuries and continued to evolve during the 20th century as well. Danto describes the history of Art in his own contemporary version of Hegel's dialectical history of art. \"Danto is not claiming that no-one is making art anymore; nor is he claiming that no good art is being made any more. But he thinks that a certain history of western art has come to an end, in about the way that Hegel suggested it would.\" The \"end of art\" refers to the beginning of our modern era of art in which art no longer adheres to the constraints of imitation theory but serves a new purpose. Art began with an \"era of imitation, followed by an era of ideology, followed by our post-historical era in which, with qualification, anything goes... In our narrative, at first only mimesis [imitation] was art, then several things were art but each tried to extinguish its competitors, and then, finally, it became apparent that there were no stylistic or philosophical constraints. There is no special way works of art have to be. And that is the present and, I should say, the final moment in the master narrative. It is the end of the story.\"\n\nArthur Danto was an art critic for \"The Nation\" from 1984 to 2009, and also published numerous articles in other journals. In addition, he was an editor of \"The Journal of Philosophy\" and a contributing editor of the \"Naked Punch Review\" and \"Artforum\". In art criticism, he published several collected essays, including \"Encounters and Reflections: Art in the Historical Present\" (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 1990), which won the National Book Critics Circle Prize for Criticism in 1990; \"Beyond the Brillo Box: The Visual Arts in Post-Historical Perspective\" (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 1992); \"Playing With the Edge: The Photographic Achievement of Robert Mapplethorpe\" (University of California, 1995); \"The Madonna of the Future: Essays in a Pluralistic Art World\" (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 2000); and \"Unnatural Wonders: Essays from the Gap Between Art and Life\" (Columbia University Press, 2007).\n\nIn 1996, he received the Frank Jewett Mather Award for art criticism from the College Art Association.\n\nHe was one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto.\n\nArthur Danto died on October 25, 2013, aged 89 in Manhattan, New York City.\n\nDanto is the author of numerous books on philosophy and art, and summarizing the works of Continental philosophers in Anglo-American terms.\n\nArthur Danto's published works include:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1212", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1212", "title": "Artist", "text": "Artist\n\nAn artist is a person engaged in an activity related to creating art, practicing the arts, or demonstrating an art. The common usage in both everyday speech and academic discourse is a practitioner in the visual arts only. The term is often used in the entertainment business, especially in a business context, for musicians and other performers (less often for actors). \"Artiste\" (the French for artist) is a variant used in English only in this context. Use of the term to describe writers, for example, is valid, but less common, and mostly restricted to contexts like criticism.\n\nWiktionary defines the noun 'artist' (Singular: artist; Plural: artists) as follows:\nThe \"Oxford English Dictionary\" defines the older broad meanings of the term \"artist\":\n\n\nThe Greek word \"techně\", often translated as \"art,\" implies mastery of any sort of craft. The adjectival Latin form of the word, \"technicus\",\nbecame the source of the English words technique, technology, technical.\n\nIn Greek culture each of the nine Muses oversaw a different field of human creation:\n\nNo muse was identified with the visual arts of painting and sculpture. In ancient Greece sculptors and painters were held in low regard, somewhere between freemen and slaves, their work regarded as mere manual labour.\n\nThe word \"art\" derives from the Latin \"ars\" (stem \"art-\"), which, although literally defined, means \"skill method\" or \"technique\", and conveys a connotation of beauty.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages the word \"artist\" already existed in some countries such as Italy, but the meaning was something resembling \"craftsman\", while the word \"artesan\" was still unknown. An artist was someone able to do a work better than others, so the skilled excellency was underlined, rather than the activity field. In this period some \"artisanal\" products (such as textiles) were much more precious and expensive than paintings or sculptures.\n\nThe first division into major and minor arts dates back at least to the works of Leon Battista Alberti (1404–1472): \"De re aedificatoria, De statua, De pictura\", which focused on the importance of the intellectual skills of the artist rather than the manual skills (even if in other forms of art there was a project behind).\n\nWith the Academies in Europe (second half of 16th century) the gap between fine and applied arts was definitely set.\n\nMany contemporary definitions of \"artist\" and \"art\" are highly contingent on culture, resisting aesthetic prescription, in much the same way that the features constituting beauty and the beautiful cannot be standardized easily without corruption into kitsch.\n\n\"Artist\" is a descriptive term applied to a person who engages in an activity deemed to be an art. An artist also may be defined unofficially as \"a person who expresses him- or herself through a medium\". The word is also used in a qualitative sense of, a person creative in, innovative in, or adept at, an artistic practice.\n\nMost often, the term describes those who create within a context of the fine arts or 'high culture', activities such as drawing, painting, sculpture, acting, dancing, writing, filmmaking, new media, photography, and music—people who use imagination, talent, or skill to create works that may be judged to have an aesthetic value. Art historians and critics define artists as those who produce art within a recognized or recognizable discipline. Contrasting terms for highly skilled workers in media in the applied arts or decorative arts include artisan, craftsman, and specialized terms such as potter, goldsmith or glassblower. Fine arts artists such as painters succeeded in the Renaissance in raising their status, formerly similar to these workers, to a decisively higher level.\n\nThe term may also be used loosely or metaphorically to denote highly skilled people in any non-\"art\" activities, as well— law, medicine, mechanics, or mathematics, for example.\n\nOften, discussions on the subject focus on the differences among \"artist\" and \"technician\", \"entertainer\" and \"artisan\", \"fine art\" and \"applied art\", or what constitutes art and what does not. The French word \"artiste\" (which in French, simply means \"artist\") has been imported into the English language where it means a performer (frequently in Music Hall or Vaudeville). Use of the word \"artiste\" can also be a pejorative term.\n\nThe English word 'artiste' has thus a narrower range of meaning than the word 'artiste' in French.\n\nIn \"Living with Art\", Mark Getlein proposes six activities, services or functions of contemporary artists:\n\nAfter looking at years of data on arts school graduates as well as policies & program outcomes regarding artists, arts, & culture, Elizabeth Lingo and Steven Tepper propose the divide between \"arts for art's sake\" artists and commercially successful artists is not as wide as may be perceived, and that \"this bifurcation between the commercial and the noncommercial, the excellent and the base, the elite and the popular, is increasingly breaking down\" (Eikhof & Haunschild, 2007). Lingo and Tepper point out:\n\nThe US Bureau of Labor Statistics classifies many visual artists as either \"craft artists\" or \"fine artists\". A craft artist makes handmade functional works of art, such as pottery or clothing. A fine artist makes paintings, illustrations (such as book illustrations or medical illustrations), sculptures, or similar artistic works primarily for their aesthetic value.\n\nThe main source of skill for both craft artists and fine artists is long-term repetition and practice. Many fine artists have studied their art form at university and some have a master's degree in fine arts. Artists may also study on their own or receive on-the-job training from an experienced artist.\n\nThe number of available jobs as an artist is increasing more slowly than other fields. About half of US artists are self-employed. Others work in a variety of industries. For example, a pottery manufacturer will employ craft artists, and book publishers will hire illustrators.\n\nIn the US, fine artists have a median income of approximately US $50,000 per year, and craft artists have a median income of approximately US $33,000 per year. This compares to US $61,000 for all art-related fields, including related jobs such as graphic designers, multimedia artists, animators, and fashion designers. Many artists work part-time as artists and hold a second job.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "47836", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47836", "title": "Averroes", "text": "Averroes\n\nIbn Rushd (; full name ; 1126 – 11 December 1198), often Latinized as Averroes (), was a Muslim Andalusian philosopher and thinker who wrote about many subjects, including philosophy, theology, medicine, astronomy, physics, Islamic jurisprudence and law, and linguistics. His philosophical works include numerous commentaries on Aristotle, for which he was known in the West as \"The Commentator\". He also served as a judge and a court physician for the Almohad caliphate.\n\nHe was born in Córdoba in 1126 to a family of prominent judges—his grandfather was the celebrated chief judge of the city. In 1169 he was introduced to the caliph Abu Yaqub Yusuf, who was impressed with his knowledge, became his patron and commissioned many of Averroes' commentaries. Averroes later served multiple terms as a judge in Seville and Córdoba. In 1182, he was appointed as court physician and the chief judge of Córdoba. After Abu Yusuf's death in 1184, he remained in royal favor until he fell into disgrace in 1195. He was targeted on various charges—likely for political reasons—and was exiled to nearby Lucena. He returned to royal favor shortly before his death on 11 December 1198.\n\nAverroes was a strong proponent of Aristotelianism; he attempted to restore what he considered the original teachings of Aristotle and opposed the Neoplatonist tendencies of earlier Muslim thinkers, such as Al-Farabi and Avicenna. He also defended the pursuit of philosophy against criticism by Ashari theologians such as Al-Ghazali. Averroes argued that philosophy was permissible in Islam and even compulsory among certain elites. He also argued scriptural text should be interpreted allegorically if it appeared to contradict conclusions reached by reason and philosophy. His legacy in the Islamic world was modest for geographical and intellectual reasons.\n\nIn the West, Averroes was known for his extensive commentaries on Aristotle, many of which were translated into Latin and Hebrew. The translations of his work reawakened Western European interest in Aristotle and Greek thinkers, an area of study that had been widely abandoned after the fall of the Roman Empire. His thoughts generated controversies in Latin Christendom and triggered a philosophical movement called Averroism based on his writings. His unity of the intellect thesis, proposing that all humans share the same intellect, became one of the most well-known and controversial Averroist doctrines in the West. His works were condemned by the Catholic Church in 1270 and 1277. Although weakened by the condemnations and sustained critique by Thomas Aquinas, Latin Averroism continued to attract followers up to the sixteenth century.\n\nIbn Rushd's full, transliterated Arabic name is \"Abū l-Walīd Muḥammad Ibn ʾAḥmad Ibn Rushd\". Sometimes, the nickname \"al-Hafid\" (\"The Grandson\") is appended to his name, to distinguish him from his similarly-named grandfather, a famous judge and jurist. \"Averroes\" is the Medieval Latin form of \"Ibn Rushd\"; it was derived from the Spanish pronunciation of the original Arabic name, wherein \"Ibn\" becomes \"Aben\" or \"Aven\". The Latinized name is also spelled in some instances as \"Averroës\", \"Averrhoës\" or \"Averroès\", with varying accents to denote that the \"o\" and \"e\" are separate vowels and not an \"œ\" digraph. Other forms of the name include \"Ibin-Ros-din\", \"Filius Rosadis\", \"Ibn-Rusid\", \"Ben-Raxid\", \"Ibn-Ruschod\", \"Den-Resched\", \"Aben-Rassad\", \"Aben-Rasd\", \"Aben-Rust\", \"Avenrosdy\", \"Avenryz\", \"Adveroys\", \"Benroist\", \"Avenroyth\" and \"Averroysta\".\n\nMuhammad ibn Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Rushd was born in 1126 (520 AH) in Córdoba. His family was well-known in the city for their public service, especially in the legal and religious fields. His grandfather Abu al-Walid Muhammad (d. 1126) was the chief judge (\"qadi\") of Córdoba and the imam of the Great Mosque of Córdoba under the Almoravids. His father Abu al-Qasim Ahmad was not as celebrated as his grandfather, but was also chief judge until the Almoravids were replaced by the Almohads in 1146.\n\nAccording to his traditional biographers, Averroes' education was \"excellent\", beginning with studies in hadith (traditions of Prophet Muhammad), \"fiqh\" (jurisprudence), medicine and theology. He learned Maliki jurisprudence under al-Hafiz Abu Muhammad ibn Rizq and hadith with Ibn Bashkuwal, a student of his grandfather. His father also taught him about jurisprudence, including on Imam Malik's \"magnum opus\" the \"Muwatta\", which Averroes went on to memorize. He studied medicine under Abu Jafar Jarim al-Tajail, who probably taught him philosophy too. He also knew the works of the philosopher Ibn Bajjah (also known as Avempace), and might have known him personally or been tutored by him. He joined a regular meeting of philosophers, physicians and poets in Seville which was attended by philosophers Ibn Tufayl and Ibn Zuhr as well as the future caliph Abu Yusuf Yaqub. He also studied the \"kalam\" theology of the Ashari school, which he criticized later in life. His 13th century biographer Ibn al-Abbar said he was more interested in the study of law and its principles (\"usul\") than that of hadith and he was especially competent in the field of \"khilaf\" (disputes and controversies in the Islamic jurisprudence). Ibn al-Abbar also mentioned his interests in \"the sciences of the ancients\", probably in reference to Greek philosophy and sciences.\n\nBy 1153 Averroes was in Marrakesh (in present-day Morocco), the capital of the Almohad caliphate, to perform astronomical observations and to support the Almohad project of building new colleges. He was hoping to find physical laws of astronomical movements instead of only the mathematical laws known at the time but this research was unsuccessful. During his stay in Marrakesh he likely met Ibn Tufayl, a renowned philosopher and the author of \"Hayy ibn Yaqdhan\" who was also the court physician in Marrakesh. Averroes and ibn Tufayl became friends despite the differences in their philosophies.\n\nIn 1169 Ibn Tufayl introduced Averroes to the Almohad caliph Abu Yaqub Yusuf. In a famous account reported by historian Abdelwahid al-Marrakushi the caliph asked Averroes whether the heavens had existed since eternity or had a beginning. Knowing this question was controversial and worried a wrong answer could put him in danger, Averroes did not answer. The caliph then elaborated the views of Plato, Aristotle and Muslim philosophers on the topic and discussed them with Ibn Tufayl. This display of knowledge put Averroes at ease; Averroes then explained his own views on the subject, which impressed the caliph. Averroes was similarly impressed by Abu Yaqub and later said the caliph had \"a profuseness of learning I did not suspect\".\n\nAfter their introduction, Averroes remained in Abu Yaqub's favor until the caliph's death in 1184. When the caliph complained to Ibn Tufayl about the difficulty of understanding Aristotle's work, Ibn Tufayl recommended to the caliph that Averroes work on explaining it. This was the beginning of Averroes' massive commentaries on Aristotle; his first works on the subject were written in 1169.\n\nIn the same year, Averroes was appointed \"qadi\" (judge) in Seville. In 1171 he became \"qadi\" in his hometown of Córdoba. As \"qadi\" he would decide cases and give \"fatwa\"s (legal opinions) based on the Islamic law (\"sharia\"). The rate of his writing increased during this time despite other obligations and his travels within the Almohad empire. He also took the opportunity from his travels to conduct astronomical researches. Many of his works produced between 1169 and 1179 were dated in Seville rather than Córdoba. In 1179 he was again appointed \"qadi\" in Seville. In 1182 he succeeded his friend Ibn Tufayl as court physician and later the same year he was appointed the chief \"qadi\" of Córdoba, a prestigious office that had once been held by his grandfather.\n\nIn 1184 Caliph Abu Yaqub died and was succeeded by Abu Yusuf Yaqub al-Mansur. Initially, Averroes remained in royal favor but in 1195 his fortune reversed. Various charges were made against him and he was tried by a tribunal in Córdoba. The tribunal condemned his teachings, ordered the burning of his works and banished Averroes to nearby Lucena. Early biographers' reasons for this fall from grace include a possible insult to the caliph in his writings but modern scholars attribute it to political reasons. The \"Encyclopaedia of Islam\" said the caliph distanced himself from Averroes to gain support from more orthodox \"ulema\", who opposed Averroes and whose support al-Mansur needed for his war against Christian kingdoms. Historian of Islamic philosophy Majid Fakhry also wrote that public pressure from traditional Maliki jurists who were opposed to Averroes played a role.\n\nAfter a few years, Averroes returned to court in Marrakesh and was again in the caliph's favor. He died shortly afterwards, on 11 December 1198 (9 Safar 595 in the Islamic calendar). He was initially buried in North Africa but his body was later moved Córdoba for another funeral, at which future Sufi mystic and philosopher Ibn Arabi (1165–1240) was present.\n\nAverroes was a prolific writer and his works, according to Fakhry, \"covered a greater variety of subjects\" than those of any of his predecessors in the East, including philosophy, medicine, jurisprudence or legal theory, and linguistics. Most of his writings were commentaries on or paraphrasings of the works of Aristotle that—especially the long ones—often contain his original thoughts. According to French author Ernest Renan, Averroes wrote at least 67 original works, including 28 works on philosophy, 20 on medicine, 8 on law, 5 on theology, and 4 on grammar, in addition to his commentaries on most of Aristotle's works and his commentary on Plato's \"The Republic\". Many of Averroes' works in Arabic did not survive, but their translations into Hebrew or Latin did. For example, of his long commentaries on Aristotle, only \"a tiny handful of Arabic manuscript remains\".\n\nAverroes wrote commentaries on nearly all of Aristotle's surviving works. The only exception is \"Politics\", which he did not have access to, so he wrote commentaries on Plato's \"Republic\". He classified his commentaries into three categories that modern scholars have named \"short\", \"middle\" and \"long\" commentaries. Most of the short commentaries (\"jami\") were written early in his career and contain summaries of Aristotlean doctrines. The middle commentaries (\"talkhis\") contain paraphrases that clarify and simplify Aristotle's original text. The middle commentaries were probably written in response to his patron caliph Abu Yaqub Yusuf's complaints about the difficulty of understanding Aristotle's original texts and to help others in a similar position. The long commentaries (\"tafsir\" or \"sharh\"), or line-by-line commentaries, include the complete text of the original works with a detailed analysis of each line. The long commentaries are very detailed and contain a high degree of original thought, and were unlikely to be intended for a general audience. Only five of Aristotle's works had all three types of commentaries: \"Physics\", \"Metaphysics\", \"On the Soul\", \"On the Heavens\", and \"Posterior Analytics\".\n\nAverroes also wrote stand alone philosophical treatises, including \"On the Intellect\", \"On the Syllogism\", \"On Conjunction with the Active Intellect\", \"On Time\", \"On the Heavenly Sphere\" and \"On the Motion of the Sphere\". He also wrote several polemics: \"Essay on al-Farabi's Approach to Logic, as Compared to that of Aristotle\", \"Methaphysical Questions Dealt with in the Book of Healing by Ibn Sina\", and \"Rebuttal of Ibn Sina's Classification of Existing Entities\".\n\nScholarly sources, including Fakhry and the \"Encyclopedia of Islam\", named three theological works as Averroes' key writings in this area. \"Fasl al-Maqal\" (\"The Decisive Treatise\") is a 1178 treatise that argues for the compatibility of Islam and philosophy. \"Al-Kashf 'an Manahij al-Adillah\" (\"Exposition of the Methods of Proof\"), written in 1179, criticizes the theologies of the Asharites, and lays out Averroes' argument for proving the existence of God, as well as his thoughts on God's attributes and actions. The 1180 \"Tahafut al-Tahafut\" (\"Incoherence of the Incoherence\") is a rebuttal of al-Ghazali's (d. 1111) landmark criticism of philosophy \"The Incoherence of the Philosophers\". It combines ideas in his commentaries and stand alone works, and uses them to respond to al-Ghazali. The work also criticizes Avicenna and his neo-Platonist tendencies, sometimes agreeing with al-Ghazali's critique against him.\n\nAverroes, who served as the royal physician at the Almohad court, wrote a number of medical treatises. The most famous was \"al-Kulliyat fi al-Tibb\" (\"General Principles of Medicine\", Latinized in the west as the \"Colliget\"), written around 1162, before his appointment at court. The Latin translation became a medical texbook in Europe for centuries. He also wrote summaries of the works of Greek physician Galen (died ) and a commentary on Avicenna's \"Urjuzah fi al-Tibb\" (\"Poem on Medicine\").\n\nAverroes served multiple tenures as judge and produced multiple works in the fields of Islamic jurisprudence or legal theory. The only book that survives today is \"Bidāyat al-Mujtahid wa Nihāyat al-Muqtaṣid\" (\"Primer of the Discretionary Scholar\"). In this work he explains the legal difference between the Sunni \"madhhab\"s (schools of Islamic jurisprudence) both in practice and in their underlying juristic principles. Despite his status as a Maliki judge, the book also discusses the opinion of other schools, including liberal and conservative ones. Other than this surviving text, bibliographical information shows he wrote a summary of Al-Ghazali's \"On Legal Theory of Muslim Jurisprudence\" (\"Al-Mustasfa\") and tracts on sacrifices and land tax.\n\nIn his philosophical writings, Averroes attempted to return to Aristotelianism, which according to him had been distorted by the Neoplatonist tendencies of Muslim philosophers such as Al-Farabi and Avicenna. He rejected al-Farabi's attempt to merge the ideas of Plato and Aristotle's, pointing out the difference between the two, such as Aristotle's rejection of Plato's theory of ideas. He also criticized Al-Farabi's works on logic for misinterpreting its Aristotelian source. He wrote an extensive critique of Avicenna, who was the standard-bearer of Islamic Neoplatonism in the Middle Ages. He argued that Avicenna's theory of emanation had many fallacies and was not found in the works of Aristotle. Averroes disagreed with Avicenna's view that existence is merely an accident added to essence, arguing the reverse; something exists \"per se\" and essence can only be found by subsequent abstraction.. He also rejected Avicenna's modality and Avicenna's argument to prove the existence of God as the Necessary Existent.\n\nDuring Averroes' lifetime, philosophy came under attack from the Sunni Islam tradition, especially from theological schools like the traditionalist (Hanbalite) and the Ashari schools. In particular, the Ashari scholar al-Ghazali (1058 – 1111) wrote \"The Incoherence of the Philosophers\" (\"Tahafut al-falasifa\"), a scathing and influential critique of the Neoplatonic philosophical tradition in the Islamic world and against the works of Avicenna in particular. Among others, Al-Ghazali charged philosophers with non-belief in Islam and sought to disprove the teaching of the philosophers using logical arguments.\n\nIn \"Decisive Treatise\", Averroes argues that philosophy—which for him represented conclusions reached using reason and careful method—cannot contradict revelations in Islam because they are just two different methods of reaching the truth, and \"truth cannot contradict truth\". When conclusions reached by philosophy appear to contradict the text of the revelation, then according to Averroes, revelation must be subjected to interpretation or allegorical understanding to remove the contradiction. This interpretation must be done by those \"rooted in knowledge\"—a phrase taken by from the Quran 3:7, which for Averroes refers to philosophers who during his lifetime had access to the \"highest methods of knowledge\". He also argues that the Quran calls for Muslims to study philosophy because the study and reflection of nature would increase a person's knowledge of \"the Artisan\" (God). He quotes Quranic passages calling on Muslims to reflect on nature and used them to render a \"fatwa\" (legal opinion) that philosophy is allowed for Muslims and is probably an obligation, at least among those who have the talent for it.\n\nAverroes also distinguishes between three modes of discourse; the rhetorical (based on persuasion) accessible to the common masses; the dialectical (based on debate) and often employed by theologians and the \"ulama\" (scholars); and the demonstrative (based on logical deduction). According to Averroes, the Quran uses the rhetorical method of inviting people to the truth, which allows it to reach the common masses with its persuasiveness, whereas philosophy uses the demonstrative methods that were only available to the learned but provided the best possible understanding and knowledge.\n\nAverroes also tries to deflect Al-Ghazali's criticisms of philosophy by saying that many of them apply only to the philosophy of Avicenna and not that of Aristotle, which Averroes argues to be the true philosophy from which Avicenna deviated.\n\nAverroes lays out his views on the existence and nature of God in the treatise \"The Exposition of the Methods of Proof\". He examines and critiques the doctrines of four sects of Islam: the Asharites, the Mutazilites, the Sufis and those he calls the \"literalists\" (\"al-hashwiyah\"). Among other things, he examines their proofs of God's existence and critiques each one. Averroes argues that there are two arguments for God's existence that he deems logically sound and in accordance to the Quran; the arguments from \"providence\" and \"from invention\". The providence argument considers that the world and the universe seem finely tuned to support human life. Averroes cited the sun, the moon, the rivers, the seas and the location of humans on the earth. According to him, this suggests a creator who created them for the welfare of mankind. The argument from invention contends that worldly entities such as animals and plants appear to have been invented. Therefore, Averroes argues that a designer was behind the creation and that is God. Averroes's two arguments are teleological in nature and not cosmological like the arguments of Aristotle and most contemporaneous Muslim kalam theologians.\n\nAverroes upholds the doctrine of divine unity (\"tawhid\") and argues—in agreement with contemporary theologians—that God has seven divine attributes: knowledge, life, power, will, hearing, vision and speech. He devotes the most attention to the attribute of knowledge and argues that divine knowledge differs from human knowledge because God knows the universe because God is its cause while humans only know the universe through its effects.\n\nAverroes argues that the attribute of life can be inferred because it is the precondition of knowledge and also because God willed objects into being. Power can be inferred by God's ability to bring creations into existence. Averroes also argues that knowledge and power inevitably give rise to speech. Regarding vision and speech, he says that because God created the world, he necessarily knows every part of it in the same way an artist understands his or her work intimately. Because two elements of the world are the visual and the auditory, God must necessarily possess the vision and speech.\n\nIn the centuries preceding Averroes, there had been a debate between Muslim thinkers questioning whether the world was created at a specific moment in time or whether it has always existed. Neo-Platonic philosophers such as Al-Farabi and Avicenna argued the world has always existed. This view was criticized by theologians and philosophers of the Ashari kalam tradition; in particular, al-Ghazali wrote an extensive refutation of the pre-eternity doctrine in his \"Incoherence of the Philosophers\" and accused the Neo-Platonic philosophers of unbelief (\"kufr\").\n\nAverroes responded to Al-Ghazali in his \"Incoherence of the Incoherence\". First, he argued that the differences between the two positions were not vast enough to warrant the charge of unbelief. He also said the pre-eternity doctrine did not necessarily contradict the Quran and cited verses that mention pre-existing \"throne\" and \"water\" in passages related to creation. Averroes argued that a careful reading of the Quran implied only the \"form\" of the universe was created in time but that its existence has been eternal. Averroes further criticized the \"kalam\" theologians for using their own interpretations of scripture to answer questions that should have been left to philosophers.\n\nAverroes states his political philosophy in his commentary of Plato's \"Republic\". He combines his ideas with Plato's and with Islamic tradition; he considers the ideal state to be one based on the Islamic law (\"shariah\"). His interpretation of Plato's philosopher-king followed that of Al-Farabi, which equates the philosopher-king with the imam, caliph and lawgiver of the state. Averroes' description of the characteristics of a philosopher-king are similar to those given by Al-Farabi; they include love of knowledge, good memory, love of learning, love of truth, dislike for sensual pleasures, dislike for amassing wealth, magnanimity, courage, steadfastness, eloquence and the ability to \"light quickly on the middle term\". Averroes writes that if philosophers cannot rule—as was the case in the Almoravid and Almohad empires around his lifetime—philosophers must still try to influence the rulers towards implementing the ideal state.\n\nAccording to Averroes, there are two methods of teaching virtue to citizens; persuasion and coercion. Persuasion is the more natural method consisting of rhetorical, dialectical and demonstrative methods; sometimes, however, coercion is necessary for those not amenable to persuasion, e.g. enemies of the state. Therefore, he justifies war as a last resort, which he also supports using Quranic arguments. Consequently, he argues that a ruler should have both wisdom and courage, which are needed for governance and defense of the state.\n\nLike Plato, Averroes calls for women to share with men in the administration of the state, including participating as soldiers, philosophers and rulers. He regrets that contemporaneous Muslim societies limited the public role of women; he says this limitation is harmful to the state's well-being.\n\nAverroes also accepted Plato's ideas of the deterioration of the ideal state. He cites examples from Islamic history when the Rashidun caliphate—which in Sunni tradition represented the ideal state led by \"rightly guided caliphs\"—became a dynastic state under Muawiyah, founder of the Umayyad dynasty. He also says the Almoravid and the Almohad empires started as ideal, shariah-based states but then deteriorated into timocracy, oligarchy, democracy and tyranny.\n\nAs did Avempace and Ibn Tufail, Averroes criticizes the Ptolemaic system using philosophical arguments and rejects the use of eccentrics and epicycles to explain the apparent motions of the moon, the sun and the planets. He argued that those objects move uniformly in a strictly circular motion around the earth, following Aristotelian principles. He postulates that there are three type of planetary motions; those that can be seen with the naked eye, those that requires instruments to observe and those that can only be known by philosophical reasoning. Averroes attempted to redefine astronomy as being based on physics rather than just mathematics as was commonly practiced by Arabic and Andalusian astronomers of his time; later in his life he declared that his attempts had failed. Averroes argues that the occasional opaque colors of the moon are caused by variations in its thickness; the thicker parts receive more light from the Sun than the thinner parts.\n\nIn physics, Averroes did not adopt the inductive method that was being developed by Al-Biruni in the Islamic world and is closer to today's physics. Rather, he was—in the words of historian of science Ruth Glasner—a \"exegetical\" scientist who produced new theses about nature through discussions of previous texts, especially the writings of Aristotle. because of this approach, he was often depicted as an unimaginative follower of Aristotle, but Glasner argues that Averroes' work introduced highly original theories of physics, especially his elaboration of Aristotle's \"minima naturalia\" and on motion as \"forma fluens\", which were taken up in the West and are important to the overall development of physics. Averroes also proposed a definition of force as \"the rate at which work is done in changing the kinetic condition of a material body\"—a definition close to the definition of power in today's physics.\n\nAverroes expounds his thoughts on psychology in his three commentaries on Aristotle's \"On the Soul\". Averroes is interested in explaining the human intellect using philosophical methods and by interpreting Aristotle's ideas. His position on the topic changed throughout his career as his thoughts developed. In his short commentary, the first of the three works, Averroes follows Ibn Bajja's theory that something called the \"material intellect\" stores specific images that a person encounters. These images serve as basis for the \"unification\" by the universal \"agent intellect\", which, once it happens, allow a person to gain universal knowledge about that concept. In his middle commentary, Averroes moves towards the ideas of Al-Farabi and Avicenna, saying the agent intellect gives humans the power of universal understanding, which is the material intellect. Once the person has sufficient empirical encounters with a certain concept, the power activates and gives the person universal knowledge (see also logical induction).\n\nIn his last commentary—called the \"Long Commentary\"—he proposes another theory, which becomes known as the theory of \"the unity of the intellect\". In it, Averroes argues that there is only one material intellect, which is the same for all humans and is unmixed with human body. To explain how different individuals can have different thoughts, he uses a concept he calls \"fikr\"—known as \"cogitatio\" in Latin—a process that happens in human brains and contains not universal knowledge but \"active consideration of particular things\" the person has encountered. This theory attracted controversy when Averroes' works entered Christian Europe; in 1229 Thomas Aquinas wrote a detailed critique titled \"On the Unity of the Intellect against the Averroists\".\n\nMaimonides (d. 1204) was among early Jewish scholars who received Averroes' works enthusiastically, saying he \"received lately everything Averroes had written on the works of Aristotle\" and that Averroes \"was extremely right\". Thirteenth-century Jewish writers, including Samuel ibn Tibbon in his work \"Opinion of the Philosophers\", Judah ibn Solomon Cohen in his \"Search for Wisdom\" and Shem-Tov ibn Falaquera, relied heavily on Averroes' texts. In 1232, Joseph Ben Abba Mari translated Averroes' commentaries on the \"Organon\"; this was the first Jewish translation of a complete work. In 1260 Moses Ben Tibbon published the translation of almost all of Averroes' commentaries and some of his works on medicine. Jewish Averroism peaked in the fourteenth century; Jewish writers of this time who translated or were influenced by Averroes include Kalonymus ben Kalonymus of Arles, France, Samuel ibn Judah of Marseilles, Todros Todrosi of Arles and Gersonides of Languedoc.\n\nAverroes' main influence on the Christian West was through his extensive commentaries on Aristotle. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, western Europe fell into a cultural decline that resulted in the loss of nearly all of the intellectual legacy of the Classical Greek scholars, including Aristotle. Averroes' commentaries, which were translated into Latin and entered Western Europe in the thirteenth century, provided an expert account of Aristotle's legacy and made them available again. The influence of his commentaries led to Averroes being referred to simply as \"The Commentator\" rather than by name in Latin Christian writings.\n\nMichael Scot (1175 – c. 1232) was the first Latin translator of Averroes who translated the long commentaries of \"Physics\", \"Metaphysics\", \"On the Soul\" and \"On the Heavens\", as well as multiple middle and short commentaries, starting in 1217 in Paris and Toledo. Following this, European authors such as Hermannus Alemannus, William de Luna and Armengaud of Montpellier translated Averroes' other works, sometimes with help from Jewish authors. Soon after, Averroes' works propagated among Christian scholars in the scholastic tradition. His writing attracted a strong circle of followers known as the Latin Averroists. Paris and Padua were major centers of Latin Averroism, and its prominent thirteenth-century leaders included Siger of Brabant and Boethius of Dacia.\n\nAuthorities of the Roman Catholic Church reacted against the spread of Averroism. In 1270, the Bishop of Paris Étienne Tempier issued a condemnation against 15 doctrines—many of which were Aristotelian or Averroist—that he said were in conflict with the doctrines of the church. In 1277, at the request of Pope John XXI, Tempier issued another condemnation, this time targeting 219 theses drawn from many sources, mainly the teachings of Aristotle and Averroes.\nAverroes received a mixed reception from other Catholic thinkers; Thomas Aquinas, a leading Catholic thinker of the thirteenth century, relied extensively on Averroes' interpretation of Aristotle but disagreed with him on many points. For example, he wrote a detailed attack on Averroes' theory that all humans share the same intellect. He also opposed Averroes on the eternity of the universe and divine providence.\n\nThe Catholic Church's condemnations of 1270 and 1277, and the detailed critique by Aquinas weakened the spread of Averroism in Latin Christendom, though it maintained a following until the sixteenth century, when European thought began to diverge from Aristotelianism. Leading Averroists in the following centuries included John of Jandun and Marsilius of Padua (fourteenth century), Gaetano da Thiene and Pietro Pomponazzi (fifteenth century), and Agostino Nifo and Marcantonio Zimara (sixteenth century).\n\nAverroes had no major influence on Islamic philosophic thought until modern times. Part of the reason was geography; Averroes lived in Spain, the extreme west of the Islamic civilization far from the centers of Islamic intellectual traditions. Also, his philosophy may not have appealed to Islamic scholars of his time. His focus on Aristotle's works was outdated in the twelfth-century Muslim world, which had already scrutinized Aristotle since the ninth century and by now was engaging deeply with newer schools of thought, especially that of Avicenna. In the nineteenth century, Muslim thinkers begin to engage with the works Averroes again. By this time, there was a cultural renaissance called \"Al-Nahda\" (\"reawakening\") in the Arabic-speaking world and the works of Averroes were seen as inspiration to modernize the Muslim intellectual tradition.\n\nReferences to Averroes appear in the popular culture of both the Western and Muslim world. The poem \"The Divine Comedy\" by the Italian writer Dante Alighieri, completed in 1320, depicts Averroes, \"who made the Great Commentary\", along with other non-Christian Greek and Muslim thinkers, in Limbo around Saladin. The prologue of \"The Canterbury Tales\" (1387) by Geoffrey Chaucer lists Averroes among other medical authorities known in Europe at the time. Averroes is depicted in Raphael's 1501 fresco \"The School of Athens\" that decorates the Apostolic Palace in the Vatican, which features seminal figures of philosophy. In the painting, Averroes wears a green robe and a turban, and peers out from behind Pythagoras, who is shown writing a book.\n\nA 1947 short story by Jorge Luis Borges, \"Averroes's Search\" (), features his attempts to understand Aristotle's \"Poetics\" within a culture that lacks a tradition of live theatrical performance. Averroes is also the hero of the 1997 Egyptian movie \"Destiny\" by Youssef Chahine, made partly in commemoration of the 800th anniversary of his death. \n\nThe plant genus \"Averrhoa\"—whose members includes the starfruit and the bilimbi, the lunar crater ibn Rushd, and the asteroid 8318 Averroes were named after him.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2795907", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2795907", "title": "Baby Gender Mentor", "text": "Baby Gender Mentor\n\nBaby Gender Mentor is the trade name of a controversial blood test designed for prenatal sex discernment. The test was manufactured by Acu-Gen Biolab, Inc., a biotech company in Lowell, Massachusetts, United States. The test made a media debut on 17 June 2005 on \"The Today Show\" and it was featured in Newsweek in October 2005. About 4,500 people had purchased the test by March 2006.\n\nThe test claimed that it offered an alternative to amniocentesis and ultrasound. Gender Mentor claimed that women had many motivations for using the test to learn the sex of their fetuses early in pregnancy, including mental preparation and planning gender-specific purchases, or more controversially, sex-selective abortion.\n\nCustomers and scientists have questioned the accuracy of the test. Legal actions were taken against Acu-Gen and their supplier. The lawsuits claimed that Acu-Gen's products do not accurately predict the sex of the baby. In their defense, Acu-Gen stated that ultrasound prediction of the sex of a fetus is not always accurate, and told one family their baby had gender abnormalities.\n\nWomen were instructed to prick their finger to draw a small amount of blood, which was placed on a card to be sent to Acu-Gen to be analyzed for US$250. The kit did not require regulation since it did not diagnose, prevent or treat a disease. The company was not obliged to disclose results of tests.\n\nAcu-Gen listed studies related to detecting fetal blood cells present in maternal circulation, but studies did not refer specifically to the Baby Gender Mentor test. The company claimed that their kit could detect twins.\n\nThe test was featured on an episode of \"The Today Show\" in June 2005. In that show, Katie Couric interviewed a woman named Holly Osburn who was mother to two daughters and expecting. Osborn said that she wanted to know the gender because she wanted to paint the nursery blue. Sherry Bonelli, the CEO of PregnancyStore.com was also interviewed and said that the test had only been available for two weeks and that numerous people had inquired about it in a short time. She also said that Acu-Gen had followed 2,000 pregnancies through to completion and that the lab results given by the Baby Gender Mentor had never been wrong . Gender Mentor claimed to have been used in 20,000 pregnancies. On the show the results of Osborn's test revealed that was going to have another girl.\nDuring the same segment of \"The Today Show\", Couric interviewed Dr. Ronald Wapner, head of maternal fetal medicine at NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital, He discussed possible pros and cons of the test. His first concern was whether the stated accuracy rate achieved in the 2,000 test cases would be realized in real world usage. His second concern was whether couples who purchase the test might use the results for family balancing, which means the decision to utilize selective abortion to achieve a baby of the desired sex. Wapner said that one positive aspect of the Baby Gender Mentor test is the non-invasive nature of the test, which means there should be no risk of harm to the fetus.\n\nThe test was listed as one of the top 10 innovations of 2005 by research company Datamonitor. In their report, titled \"Build A Better Mousetrap\", Datamonitor identifies their picks for \"the best new food, drink, health, household and pet products of 2005\". They listed the test as the number 8 innovation of the year.\n\nAt least 40 women have come forward to say their Baby Gender Mentor tests predicted the wrong sex. According to a National Public Radio (NPR) report, the company has explained certain inaccurate results as being the result of a vanishing twin, a fetus that stopped growing soon after fertilization. Acu-Gen claimed that their kit could predict a mixed sex set of fraternal twins, so the test should have predicted twins instead of predicting a single baby whose sex turned out to be incorrect.\n\nWith Acu-Gen choosing not to publish proof of its claims and evidence of several women receiving inaccurate predictions, doctors are concerned about the test. Among the scientific evidence cited by Acu-Gen's web site is a paper co-authored by Diana Bianchi, an expert on fetal DNA at Tufts University. The NPR story quoted Bianchi as saying, \"I think at the present time we need to be concerned whether the test is accurate or not\", and \"I think it's caveat emptor. Let the buyer beware.\" Another criticism has come from Sandra Carson, professor of obstetrics and gynecology and involved in research in sex selection. Carson says, \"Until Acu-Gen releases its data, there's no way to know the test's reliability. Until that's out, I think it shouldn't be on the market.\" Carson at that time was at the Baylor College of Medicine. Dr. Charles Lockwood, chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at Yale School of Medicine, said that it is possible for fetal DNA to be found in maternal blood as soon as the placenta has developed, and that detection after five weeks \"is not impossible\" and the president of Acu-Gen said the suit was \"totally bogus\".\n\nThere are multiple legal challenges and investigations under way. Gail O'Conner, a spokesperson for the Illinois State Attorney General, says that they are investigating PregnancyStore.com for possible fraud. Florida Congressman Jim Davis has urged the FDA to investigate Acu-Gen, and the Florida Attorney General has opened an investigation against Acu-Gen. A law firm named Gainey & McKenna has filed a class action lawsuit and at least one other firm is inviting people to contact them about their legal rights if they are unhappy with the results of their test. Gainey & McKenna's lawsuit seeks to bar the company from false advertising in marketing its test and to compel the firm to honor its money-back guarantee. The law firm cites seven areas of contention, including the veracity of the accuracy claims and the violation of HIPAA and other laws.\n\nParents have cited an interest in preparing themselves or the baby's siblings for gender-specific issues. Some women might prefer this test to an ultrasound exam, which might reveal fetal abnormalities that the parents might prefer not to know about until after delivery.\n\nThe National Public Radio investigative report on Acu-Gen predicted that parents may use the Baby Gender Mentor test as a basis for determining whether to get a sex-selective abortion. KMSP-TV interviewed genetic counselor Dr. Analia Bortz who made the same prediction. The concern is that learning the sex at such an early point may lead parents to terminate the pregnancy if they were hoping for a baby of the opposite sex to that indicated by the test. Americans United for Life argues that women disappointed by the result of their test would find it easier to have an abortion if they get the results early. They say that women who want to have a specific sex will be learning the results at a time when it is safer for them to have an abortion, without the complications associated with aborting later in pregnancy.\n\nSome bioethicists believe that sex selection is an ethical problem and could be disruptive to society. Charles Lockwood of Yale says, \"a disproportionate number of female fetuses have been terminated worldwide, and a 2-to-1 male-to-female ratio could lead to social unrest and wars.\" According to Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania, sex selection is not a frequent occurrence in the United States but it is a concern in countries such as India and China, where having boys is preferred over having girls. In China, sex selection has led to men outnumbering women by about 1.2-to-1. In India, the ratio of girls to boys is also on the decline. The 2004 census shows that there were 818 girls born per 1,000 boys; the ratio varies in different parts of India, with the greatest imbalance occurring in the most affluent area. In a certain portion of New Delhi, only 762 girls were born per 1,000 boys. Punjab's Health Minister Ramesh Chander Dogra has said he will take action to ban the test in India.\n\nThe website for the PregnancyStore.com says that they will ship the tests only within the United States, Sheila McLean, professor of medical ethics at Glasgow University, is critical of the kits.\n\nAcu-Gen's website states the test was not a medical test:\nTests similar to the Baby Gender Mentor test can be used for medical diagnoses. For instance, scientists have shown that it is possible to use fetal DNA from a woman's blood to screen the fetus for genetic defects such as Down syndrome. In a validation study sponsored by the National Institute for Child Health and Development, 5 different labs used fetal cells from maternal blood to search for evidence of Down syndrome in 2,744 pregnancies. On average, the labs correctly spotted Down syndrome babies 74% of the time.\n\nIn at least one case, Chang Wang, the president of Acu-Gen, has phoned a pregnant woman one month after giving her the sex prediction to inform her that her test indicated an \"excess of genetic material in her blood\" and advised her to see her doctor in order \"to rule out problems like Down's syndrome or Trisomy 18\". Wang explains this means \"with a certain possibility, that her fetus has a kind of genetic problem. Of course later on, we had used our technology to prove that she has a chromosome problem: Trisomy 18. That means that this baby [is] going to have a developmental problem and is going to probably cease to exist right after the birth.\" Dr. Diana Bianchi of Tufts disputes the possibility of the test being used for such a diagnosis. She says, \"The test involves looking at genetic sequences on the X chromosome and the Y chromosome. If he gave a diagnosis of Trisomy 18, that involves a different chromosome, Chromosome 18. That is certainly something that is not advertised in the packaging associated with the test. \"It is possible that, upon being told of a problem by Acu-Gen, a woman may seek to have an amniocentesis or other invasive procedure which may be an unnecessary risk if the Acu-Gen diagnosis was in error. In this case, the woman delivered a healthy baby free from both Trisomy 18 and Down syndrome.\n\nThe class action lawsuit filed by Gainey & McKenna alleges that Acu-Gen is improperly dispensing medical advice. The law firm claims Wang has contacted \"many women\" and advised them that their fetuses have chromosomal abnormalities. They claim that Dr. Wang, who is listed as a Ph.D., is providing women \"with all sorts of medical advice and diagnoses\". They say their clients have suffered great emotional distress and have undergone unnecessary medical testing based upon Dr. Wang's \"advice\".\n\nAcu-Gen has allegedly created new requirements for people who want to take advantage of the money-back guarantee. The attorney Barry Gainey, of Gainey & McKenna, says that Chang Wang, Acu-Gen's President, is \"making people send in the original birth certificate. He's making them get blood tests from the newborn baby. And there's other requirements that he's now adding to the refund in order to avoid paying back these people and giving them the 200-percent refund.\" None of those requirements were on the boxes shipped to early customers, but the requirements have since appeared on Acu-Gen's website. Gainey has filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of 40 people who claim they received inaccurate results but were unable to obtain refunds from Acu-Gen.\n\nThere have been conflicting reports about how often the company has refunded money to consumers who received an erroneous result with the test. In February 2006, Wang said, \"We don't mistakes . Period.\" Yet in October 2005 he had stated his company had issued four refund checks, including one for a case involving a vanishing twin. The PregnancyStore.com states that none of the refund checks were issued as a result of the test being proven wrong by a live birth. Their website states:\nIn March 2006, Wang wrote in an e-mail to NPR, he has \"decided to defer all his energies regarding the BGM product and service for one more year, when results of actual births compared to the results provided by Baby Gender Mentor should answer any concern about the accuracy of the test.\"\n\nInitial news reports and the Acu-Gen website touted a 200% money-back guarantee. In May 2006, Baby Gender Mentor website was modified to show a different warranty than the one that had originally promised to refund 200% of the purchase price of the test. The new warranty states:\nPregnancyStore.com also updated their website to state that the warranty was only 100% of the purchase price. In July 2006, the PregnancyStore.com reported that the test was \"currently out of stock\", and In-Gender.com, a commercial sales blog, reported that the test has been completely pulled from the market in India. As of January 2007, PregnancyStore.com no longer contains any mention of the kit on their website, although the BabyGenderMentor.com website does contain a form for on-line purchasing of the kit.\n\nAcu-Gen is a biotech company in Lowell, Massachusetts and is led by Chang-ning Wang, the company's President. A National Public Radio reporter visited the address given as the headquarters of Acu-Gen in September 2005. They found that the building at that address contains a Hindu temple and a company called BioTronics, but no sign for Acu-Gen. According to NPR, their inquiries at BioTronics revealed the two companies have common ownership, but no one was available to comment for the NPR story. Acu-Gen does not mention a direct link to BioTronics in their marketing materials. However, they do state on their web-site that they utilize BioTronics' AmpliSensor technology, according to the Baby Gender Mentor website. AmpliSensor is a quantitative PCR assay invented by Wang and marketed by BioTronics, according to the Baby Gender Mentor website.\n\nA news crew from television station WFTS, an American Broadcasting Company (ABC) affiliate, visited the Acu-Gen offices in February 2006. They found \"about six employees inside Wang's lab, some putting together sex test kits, others doing some type of lab work. There was a room full of machines Chang said he created, and shelves stacked with blood samples supposedly sent in by women from across the United States.\" BioTronics does make a laboratory instrument known as an AG-9600 AmpliSensor Analyzer, which is used for quantitative DNA analysis.\n\nIt is not known whether the two journalists visited the same address, nor is it known whether Acu-Gen and BioTronics currently share office or laboratory space. As of January 2007, Acu-Gen lists their address as \"50 Stedman Street, Lowell, MA\". On December 2, 2006 BioTronics' trademark on \"AmpliSensor\" (U.S. trademark registration number 1958576) was declared dead and cancelled. At that time, BioTronics' address was listed as \"44 Stedman Street, Unit 5, Lowell, MA\".\n\n55.Clinic for Baby gender selection Gender selection issues and advice.\n\n"}

Green\n\nChristopher Darren Green (born 1959) is professor of psychology at York University in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. He is cross-appointed to the graduate science and technology studies program as well. His research has mostly been about the history of psychology, though he now also writes on methodological and statistical issues in psychology.\n\nGreen was a Fellow of the American Psychological Association until he resigned from the organization in 2015. He is a past president of APA Division 26, the Society for the History of Psychology. He was editor of the \"Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences\", 2006-2008. His graduate training was in psychological aesthetics and computational cognitive science.\n\nGreen was born in Sacramento, California in 1959. His father, a native of San Francisco, was an undergraduate student of English and drama at the time. His mother was born in Ohio and raised near Detroit, Michigan, and she moved to California in the early 1950s.\n\nThe year after his birth, Green's family moved Salt Lake City, Utah, where his father worked at an explosives plant for two years. The plant suffered a catastrophic explosion in 1962, and the family moved back to the San Francisco Bay Area, living in the suburbs in the south of the city. His father earned an MA at San Jose State University, then went to the doctoral program in drama at Stanford University in 1970. Green attended Lewis M. Terman Jr. High School (now Terman Middle School) for grades 7 through 9. He played trumpet in a variety of student bands and orchestras.\n\nIn 1974, his father took a professorship at Bishop's University in Lennoxville, Québec. Green attended Alexander Galt Regional High School there for grades 10 and 11. He also learned several trades around the university's theater, doing set-building, lighting, and sound. In 1976, Green moved to the Montréal area to attend Vanier CEGEP where he earned a Diplôme d'études collégiales (DEC) in music with a specialization in jazz.\n\nStarting in 1979, he enrolled in music at McGill University. By the end of the year, however, he had become disenchanted with the department and with his future prospects as a professional musician. He transferred to the department of psychology and discovered an interest in cognitive psychology, in which he took a course from Tony Marley. He also took a course in symbolic logic from Anil Gupta. Green was also a disk jockey at the student radio station.\n\nAfter one year in psychology, Green dropped out of university. He busked guitar in a subway station. During the summer of 1982, he moved back to his parents' home in Lennoxville and enrolled at Bishop's University to finish his psychology degree. His honours thesis supervisor was Anton DeMan. Another of his primary mentors was Stuart McKelvie. Green also worked in the theater, served as copy editor for the student newspaper (\"The Campus\") and, in his second year, was elected president of the Bishop's Student Council. He completed his degree in 1984 and applied to several graduate programs in psychology, but was not accepted. He decided to remain at Bishop's for the 1984-85 school year, where he spent most of his time working as a lighting and sound assistant at the university theater. He was the sound operator for a concert played by the legendary blues musician, Brownie McGhee, who teamed up with a local man, Harmonica Zeke, for a one-night show. Green also wrote a political column for \"The Campus\" under the pseudonym \"#9.\"\n\nAfter his additional year at Bishop's, Green applied to graduate school again, this time in both psychology and theater. He was accepted at Simon Fraser University in psychology and at the University of Victoria in theater. He chose the former.\nBeginning at Simon Fraser in 1985, Green's MA supervisor was Bernard Lyman, who admired the \"Gestalt\" psychologists and sought to revive E. B. Titchener's method of rigorous introspection. In addition to the required psychology courses, Green took several philosophy courses (aesthetics, philosophy of mind, philosophy of science) during his master's degree. His thesis research involved factor analyzing hundreds of subjects' detailed responses to nine different art works (3 paintings, 3 pieces of music, 3 poems). Nothing from the thesis was ever published, but the research process brought to Green's attention the Golden Section, a topic that would later serve as the basis of his most-cited journal article. Considering the possibility of specializing in statistics, Green took several math courses at the start of his PhD. He had begun writing his major doctoral essays (on philosophy of science and psychology) when his supervisor, Lyman, became ill with cancer, dying in December 1988.\n\nGreen transferred to the University of Toronto, where his new doctoral supervisor, John M. Kennedy, a one-time student of J. J. Gibson, was just beginning pioneering work on whether blind people use the same graphical artistic conventions when they draw. Green became interested in computational cognitive science and audited courses in connectionism taught by Geoffrey Hinton. One of his closest mentors at Toronto was the theoretical psychologist, André Kukla. His dissertation topic, conceived during a conference talk he saw by Paul Smolensky, was to develop connectionist networks that could correctly solve problems in deductive logic. He completed his PhD in 1992.\n\nFinding no full-time academic position immediately after graduation, Green remained at Toronto, where he was given the title of \"Special Lecturer\" and taught various courses, including one in a recently developed cognitive science program. In 1992 he published a paper on the history of operationism, which had grown out of his unfinished doctoral papers at Simon Fraser and was, for many years, among his most popular articles. He applied for dozens more academic positions the following year, mostly in cognition. He was hired by York University in Toronto in July 1993. He joined York's History & Theory of Psychology graduate program (now Historical, Theoretical, & Critical Studies in Psychology). He taught undergraduate courses mainly on cognition, perception, statistics, and the history of psychology. At the graduate level, he taught seminars on cognition, the history of psychology, and the work of Michel Foucault. Starting about 1997, his undergraduate teaching narrowed to only statistics. In 1995, he published a review of psychological research on the aesthetics of the Golden Section, which soon became his most-cited article. Among Green's most important mentors during his early years at York were Raymond Fancher, the senior figure in the History & Theory of Psychology program, and Andrew Winston, a historian of psychology at the University of Guelph.\n\nHe became interested in the World Wide Web and created a series of webpages and e-mail lists for several scholarly organizations in which he was involved: Divisions 24 (theory) and 26 (history) of the American Psychological Association, Cheiron: The International Society for the History of Behavioral and Social Sciences, the International Society for Theoretical Psychology, and Section 25 (history & philosophy) of the Canadian Psychological Association, among others. He was tenured and promoted to Associate Professor in 1997. Late in 1997, he began work on the \"Classics in the History of Psychology\" website, which ultimately housed electronic editions of over 200 publications of historical importance in psychology. The site became tremendously popular, especially in the days before commercial publishers learned the value of posting their journals' back-catalogs to the Web. The Classics site garnered tens of millions of hits during its first few years. Green was made a Fellow of the American Psychological Association (through the History Division (26)) in 2000, primarily for his internet activities. He was also presented a Special Service Award by History Division (26) of the APA in 2002. In 2004, he was made a Fellow of the Teaching Division (2) of APA as well. He was promoted to Full Professor by York that same year.\n\nIn 1998, Green had returned to the University of Toronto to start a second PhD, in the philosophy of science. His supervisor was a professor he had known during his previous stint there, William Seager, best known for his work on the theory of consciousness. Progress on the dissertation was slow, but he completed the degree in 2004. His dissertation returned to the topic of cognitive science, investigating whether connectionist networks served as \"scientific models,\" as that phrase is understood in philosophy. He showed that one popular class of connectionist networks, which are made up of units that are usually thought of as being idealized analogs of neurons (thus the nickname \"neural nets\"), seemed to perform worse rather than better as more realistic neurological assumptions were built into their operation.\n\nHaving more or less satisfied his interests in computational cognitive science, in the first years of the 21st century Green began to retool as a historian of science. First, he wrote a couple of pieces on the mid-19th-century computational work of Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace. In 2003, he finally published a book on ancient Greek and Roman psychological thought that he had co-authored with a graduate school friend, Philip Groff, mostly during the mid-1990s. After that, his main historical interests turned to North American psychology, especially around the turn of the 20th century. He worked on the rise and fall of Functionalism, creating two video documentaries on the topic in addition to several articles and book chapters. In October and November 2006, he wrote the bulk of English Wikipedia's history of psychology entry. In 2009, he co-edited with Ludy T. Benjamin, Jr. a book on the pre-history of sport psychology. From 2006 to 2008 he served as editor of the \"Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences\". Late in 2007, he was elected President-Elect of the History of Division of the APA, serving as President mainly in 2009.\n\nAbout 2010, he began using the new digital methods that were starting to capture various regions of the humanities and applying them to the study of the history of psychology. In 2011, he formed a \"laboratory\" with his York colleague, Michael Pettit and a number of students. They named themselves the \"PsyBorgs.\" In 2012, Green and Pettit won a research grant from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) to support this work. Green and his colleagues published several articles in which complete runs of journal articles over decades of time were represented as nodes in a series of networks. These networks visually depicted the intellectual structure of the discipline at various periods in time — e.g., which topics were popular, how various topics were related to each other in terms of the vocabularies they used, and how these disciplinary structures changed over time from the 1880s to the 1920s. He also co-authored with his students digital studies of history's most prolific and most influential psychologists. In August of 2019, the book that he had been working for nearly a decade was published, \"Psychology and Its Cities: A New History of Early American Psychology\". His current research is focused on the historical use and misuse of statistical analysis in psychology.\n\nGreen's most active (former) graduate students include Daniel Denis (currently at the University of Montana), Jennifer Bazar (currently at the Lakeshore Grounds Interpretive Centre of Humber College), Cathy Faye (currently at the University of Akron), Jeremy Burman (currently at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands), Jacy Young (currently at Quest University), and Arlie Belliveau (currently at York University).\n\n"}

{"id": "13923102", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13923102", "title": "Criteria of truth", "text": "Criteria of truth\n\nIn epistemology, criteria of truth (or tests of truth) are standards and rules used to judge the accuracy of statements and claims. They are tools of verification. Understanding a philosophy's criteria of truth is fundamental to a clear evaluation of that philosophy. This necessity is driven by the varying, and conflicting, claims of different philosophies. The rules of logic have no ability to distinguish truth on their own. An individual must determine what standards distinguish truth from falsehood. Not all criteria are equally valid. Some standards are sufficient, while others are questionable.\n\nThe criteria listed represent those most commonly used by scholars and the general public. Jonathan Dolhenty states there seem to be only three functional, effective tests of truth. He lists these as the correspondence, coherence and pragmatic theories of truth.\n\nThe opinions of those with significant experience, highly trained or possessing an advanced degree are often considered a form of proof. Their knowledge and familiarity within a given field or area of knowledge command respect and allow their statements to be criteria of truth. A person may not simply declare themselves an authority, but rather must be properly qualified. Despite the wide respect given to expert testimony, it is not an infallible criterion. For example, multiple authorities may conflict in their claims and conclusions.\n\nCoherence refers to a consistent and overarching explanation for all facts. To be coherent, all pertinent facts must be arranged in a consistent and cohesive fashion as an integrated whole. The theory that most effectively reconciles all facts in this fashion may be considered most likely to be true. Coherence is the most potentially effective test of truth because it most adequately addresses all elements. The main limitation lies not in the standard, but in the human inability to acquire all facts of an experience. Only an omniscient mind could be aware of all of the relevant information. A scholar must accept this limitation and accept as true the most coherent explanation for the available facts. Coherence is difficult to dispute as a criterion of truth, since arguing against coherence is validating incoherence, which is inherently illogical.\n\nSome view opinions held by all people to be valid criteria of truth. According to \"consensus gentium\", the universal consent of all mankind, all humans holding a distinct belief proves it is true. There is some value in the criterion if it means innate truth, such as the laws of logic and mathematics. If it merely means agreement, as in a unanimous vote, its value is questionable. For example, general assent once held the earth was flat and that the sun revolved about the earth.\n\nMere consistency is when correct statements do not contradict, but are not necessarily related. Accordingly, an individual is consistent if he does not contradict himself. It is inadequate as a criterion because it treats facts in an isolated fashion without true cohesion and integration; nevertheless it remains a necessary condition for the truth of any argument, owing to the law of noncontradiction. The value of a proof largely lies in its ability to reconcile individual facts into a coherent whole.\n\nStrict consistency is when claims are connected in such a fashion that one statement follows from another. Formal logic and mathematical rules are examples of rigorous consistency. An example would be: if all As are Bs and all Bs are Cs, then all As are Cs. While this standard is of high value, it is limited. For example, the premises are \"a priori\" (or self-apparent), requiring another test of truth to employ this criterion. Additionally, strict consistency may produce results lacking coherence and completeness. While a philosophical system may demonstrate rigorous consistency with the facts it considers, all facts must be taken into consideration for an adequate criterion of truth, regardless of their detriment to any given system.\n\nCorrespondence is quite simply when a claim corresponds with its object. For example, the claim that the White House is in Washington, D.C. is true, if the White House is actually located in Washington. Correspondence is held by many philosophers to be the most valid of the criteria of truth. An idea that corresponds to its object is indeed true, but determining if the correspondence is perfect requires additional tests of truth. This indicates that correspondence is a perfectly valid \"definition\" of truth, but is not of itself a valid criterion of truth. An additional test beyond this \"definition\" is required to determine the precise degree of similarity between what is posited and what exists in objective reality.\n\nMost people consciously or unknowingly employ custom as a criterion of truth, based on the assumption that doing what is customary will prevent error. It is particularly applied in the determination of moral truth and reflected in the statement \"when in Rome, do as the Romans do\". People stick closely to the principle of custom when they use common vernacular, wear common fashions and so forth; essentially, when they do what is popular. Custom is not considered a serious, or valid, test of truth. For example, public opinion polls do not determine truth.\n\nMany people allow feelings to determine judgment, often in the face of contrary evidence or without even attempting to collect evidence and facts. They are implicitly accepting emotions as a criterion of truth. Most people will admit that feelings are not an adequate test for truth. For example, a seasoned businessman will put aside his emotions and search for the best available facts when making an investment. Similarly, scholars are trained to put aside such subjective judgments when evaluating knowledge. Emotions are real, however, and thus must be considered within any social scientific system of coherence.\n\nThe existence of distinct instincts has long been debated. Proponents of instinct argue that we eat because of hunger, drink because of thirst, and so forth. Some have even argued for the existence of God based on this criterion, arguing that the object of every instinct has a referent in reality. The counterpoint of hunger is food; for thirst it is liquid; for the sex drive it is a mate. Instincts are not accepted as a reliable test because they are most often indistinct, variant and difficult to define. Additionally, universal instincts are so few that they offer little to the greater body of philosophy as a criterion.\n\nIntuition is an assumed truth with an unknown, or possibly unexamined, source. It is a judgment that is not dependent on a rational examination of the facts. It is usually experienced as a sudden sensation and/or rush of thoughts that feel \"right\". Many persons experience intuitive epiphanies which later prove to be true. Scholars have sometimes come upon valid theories and proofs while daydreaming or otherwise mentally occupied with something bearing no apparent relationship to the truth they seek to reveal. Intuition is at best a source for truths, rather than a criterion with which to evaluate them. Intuitive knowledge requires testing by means of other criteria of truth in order to confirm its accuracy.\n\nMajority rule is a statistical method of accepting assertions and proposals. In democratic systems, majority rule is used to determine group decisions, particularly those relating to personal morality and social behavior. Some systems divided into several oppositional factions may depend on mere plurality. While majority rule may make for a good democratic system, it is a poor determinant of truth, subject to the criticisms of the broad version of \"consensus gentium\".\n\nNaïve realism posits that only that which is directly observable by the human senses is true. First-hand observation determines the truth or falsity of a given statement. Naïve Realism is an insufficient criterion of truth. A host of natural phenomena are demonstrably true, but not observable by the unaided sense. For example, Naïve Realism would deny the existence of sounds beyond the range of human hearing and the existence of x-rays. Similarly, there are a number of sense experiments which show a disconnect between the perceived sensation and the reality of its cause.\n\nIf an idea works then it must be true, to the Pragmatist. The consequences of applying a concept reveal its truth value upon examination of the results. The full meaning of an idea is self-apparent in its application. For example, the therapeutic value and effect of penicillin in relation to infections is proven in its administration. Although Pragmatism is considered a valuable criterion, it must be used with caution and reservation, due to its potential for false positives. For example, a doctor may prescribe a patient medication for an illness, but it could later turn out that a placebo is equally effective. Thus, untrue concepts could appear to be working contrary to the purpose of the pragmatic test. However, it has validity as a test, particularly in the form William Ernest Hocking called \"Negative Pragmatism\". In essence, it states that ideas that do not work cannot possibly be true, though ideas which do work may or may not be true.\n\nThe principal distinction between intuition and revelation is that revelation has an assumed source: God (or another higher power). Revelation may be defined as truth emanating from God. Many religions fundamentally rely on revelation as a test of truth. This criterion is subject to the same criticisms as intuition. It may be a valid reference of truth for an individual, but it is inadequate for providing a coherent proof of the knowledge to others.\n\nTime is a criterion commonly appealed to in debate, often referred to as \"the test of time\". This criterion posits that over time erroneous beliefs and logical errors will be revealed, while if the belief is true, the mere passage of time cannot adversely affect its validity. Time is an inadequate test for truth, since it is subject to similar flaws as custom and tradition (which are simply specific variations of the time factor). Many demonstrably false beliefs have endured for centuries and even millennia (e.g. vitalism). It is commonly rejected as a valid criterion. For example, most people will not convert to another faith simply because the other religion is centuries (or even millennia) older than their current beliefs.\n\nTradition, closely related to custom, is the standard stating that which is held for generations is true. Those accepting tradition argue that ideas gaining the loyalty multiple generations possesses a measure of credibility. Tradition possesses many of the same failings as custom. It is possible for falsehoods to be passed down from generation to generation, since tradition generally emphasizes repetition over critical evaluation.\n"}

He has also done work on the theory of practical rationality, where he begins from an attempt to understand economic rationality, rather than from Kantian or Aristotelian antecedents.\n\nGauthier understands value as a matter of individuals' subjective preferences, and argues that moral constraints on straightforward utility-maximizing are prudentially justified. He argues that it is most prudent to give up straightforward maximizing and instead adopt a disposition of constrained maximization, according to which one resolves to cooperate with all similarly disposed persons (those disposed towards cooperation) and defect on the rest (straightforward maximizers), since repeated cooperation provides greater yields than repeated mutual defection from contracts (as is seen in a basic Prisoner's dilemma game). According to Gauthier's contractarian ethics, moral constraints are justified because they make us all better off, in terms of our preferences (whatever they may be). A consequence is that good moral thinking is just an elevated and subtly strategic version of means–end reasoning.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "26923940", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26923940", "title": "Eutaxiology", "text": "Eutaxiology\n\nEutaxiology (from the Greek \"eu\" – good, and \"tax\" – order) is the philosophical study of order and design. It is distinguished from teleology in that it does not focus on the purpose or goal of a given structure or process, merely the degree and complexity of the structure or process.\n\nThe term \"eutaxiology\" was first coined by geologist Lewis Ezra Hicks in his \"Critique of Design Arguments\", in which he argued that one can appreciate the complexities of organic life on Earth without assuming and accepting an intelligent design theory. However, the concept had been around for centuries, most notably in the works of Aristotle, who offered in \"Physics\" the idea of natural design without a designer, stating that \"It is absurd to suppose that ends are not present [in nature] because we do not see an agent deliberating\". Lucretius, who was also a supporter of accidentalism, similarly stated in \"De Rerum Natura,\" \"Nothing in the body is made in order that we may use it. What happens to exist is the cause of its use\".\n\nEutaxiology is often mistaken for teleology, the study of purpose and design. However, it can be argued that eutaxiology and teleology are in fact complements to each other by stating that a good design and order necessarily implies the ability to achieve a goal or purpose. The two terms are also often used as arguments against each other, implying that eutaxiology is the observation of a process that occurs by chance, while teleology is always designed by some designer.\n\nAs a result, the eutaxiology is often used in religious arguments, particularly concerning the existence of God, though it is used in both sides of the argument. In complement with teleology, it can be argued that the basic principles of physics and chemistry are designed in a way that supports organic life. On the other hand, skeptics point to evolutionary biology, claiming that if the Earth were perfectly designed by a perfect creator, the long and sometimes unsuccessful process of evolution would not have had to have taken place. Critics of this theory claim that evolutionary biology is in fact evidence of intelligent design and therefore God, pointing to the eventual development of the human brain, which could engineer society.\n\nIn this regard, eutaxiology can also be applied to ethics, especially concerning ends justifying means, and whether or not ends do in fact depend on means. On a larger scale, eutaxiology can be used to argue either for or against Anthropic Principle. On one hand, it can be stated that observations made about the physical and metaphysical Universe must be compatible with the life observed in it. For example, people believe that the Universe was especially designed for them because they cannot fathom other, completely different Universes, implying existential epistemic eutaxiology. Conversely, It can be said that due to Occam's Razor, the universe must be especially designed for humans because of the intricacies of the design that allows us to live where and how we do. Metaphysically, this can be traced back to causal arguments (i.e. do humans exist because of intricate biochemical processes, or do they exist because God created these biochemical processes?)\n"}
{"id": "20719145", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20719145", "title": "Exhausted combination doctrine", "text": "Exhausted combination doctrine\n\nThe exhausted combination doctrine, also referred to as the doctrine of the Lincoln Engineering case, is the doctrine of U.S. patent law that when an inventor invents a new, unobvious device and seeks to patent not merely the new device but also the combination of the new device with a known, conventional device with which the new device cooperates in the conventional and predictable way in which devices of those types have previously cooperated, the combination is unpatentable as an \"exhausted combination\" or \"old combination\". The doctrine is also termed the doctrine of the \"Lincoln Engineering\" case because the United States Supreme Court explained the doctrine in its decision in \"Lincoln Engineering Co. v. Stewart-Warner Corp.\"\n\nIn \"Lincoln Engineering\", the inventor invented a new and improved coupling device to attach a nozzle to a grease gun. The patent, however, claimed the whole combination of grease gun, nozzle, and coupling. The Supreme Court stated that \"the improvement of one part of an old combination gives no right to claim that improvement in combination with other old parts which perform no new function in the combination\". It then concluded that the inventor's \"effort, by the use of a combination claim, to extend the monopoly of his invention of an improved form of chuck or coupler to old parts or elements having no new function when operated in connection with the coupler renders the claim void.\" \n\nThis way of claiming an invention was termed “overclaiming,” because it inflated the royalty base for licensing and potentially effectuated a tie-in by means of which the patentee required users, for example, to purchase not only the couplings but the whole grease gun as well in order to use the invention.\n\nThe Federal Circuit held in 1984 that this doctrine is outdated and no longer reflects the law. In effect, the Federal Circuit overruled the Supreme Court on this point—or claimed that the passage of the 1952 patent recodification law had done so. \n\nIn its decision in \"Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc.\", however, the Supreme Court seems to have assumed without any discussion that its old precedents such as \"Lincoln Engineering\" (uncited in the \"Quanta\" opinion) are still in force, as least with regard to the exhaustion doctrine. In \"Quanta\", the Court considered the sale of a patented microprocessor to \"exhaust\" not only the patent on the microprocessor but the patent on a conventional personal computer (PC) containing the microprocessor, since the PC patent had essentially the same inventive concept (or departure from the prior art) as the microprocessor patent.\n\nAfter 1984 it appeared that it was possible to obtain patents on old combinations, for example not only a new motor but also an otherwise conventional disc drive containing the new motor. It has also been held that the sale of the motor, in such a case, does not exhaust the patent on the disc drive containing the new motor. Hence, a purchaser of the motor who incorporated it into a disk drive would infringe the disk drive patent. It is now uncertain whether such patents are valid. In any event, the \"Quanta\" decision appears to hold that the exhaustion doctrine shields from infringement liability the foregoing motor purchaser that incorporates the motor into a disk drive.\n\nClaiming a computer-related advance as an exhausted combination may provide a way to prevent the claimed advance from being classified as nonstatutory subject matter under section 101 of the US patent law. Placing a process that fails the machine-or-transformation test in a machine environment may overcome the absence of implementation by a specific machine, as required by In re Bilski and the Supreme Court decisions on which it is based. (The successfulness of this expedient depends on acceptance of the Federal Circuit's abolition of the exhausted combination doctrine.)\n\nFor example, the form of the processes claimed in \"Diamond v. Diehr\", \"Parker v. Flook\", and \"Gottschalk v. Benson\" may appropriately be compared. In \"Diehr\", the claim is to “a method of operating a rubber-molding press” and the claim contains at least minimal references to the press and other apparatus. In \"Flook\", the claim is to a \"method for updating the value of at least one alarm limit,\" where an “’alarm limit’ is a number.” The claim does not say anything about a reaction vessel or even temperature measuring devices. In \"Benson\", the claim is to “a data processing method for converting binary coded decimal number representations into binary number representations.” One claim mentions a reentrant shift register and the other claim mentions no apparatus at all. In \"Flook\", the claim could have instead been to “a method of operating a hydrocracking plant wherein hydrocarbon feedstock is placed into a chemical reactor, heat is applied, etc.” The claim, although to an exhausted combination, would have required apparatus as did that in the \"Diehr\" case. Similarly, the claim in \"Benson\" could have been to a method of operating a telephone switch box or perhaps even a method of providing binary-coded-decimal numerical signals to a binary-coded operating device. Again, by providing a mechanical environment, even though it was an exhausted combination, the claims drafter might have avoided the holding of nonstatutory subject matter. It is possible that careful claims drafting techniques will succeed in elevating form over substance, to avoid the impact of the machine-or-transformation test.\n\nThe preceding analysis may have been overtaken by the Supreme Court's 2014 decision in \"Alice v. CLS Bank\". In that case the Court confirmed and extended the legal analysis of its prior decisions in \"Parker v. Flook\" and \"Mayo v. Prometheus\" to claimed inventions involving implementations of computer algorithms, methods of doing business, and other methods of organizing human activity. The form of analysis that these cases dictate is that the presence of a machine, in particular a programmed digital computer, is not enough without more to assure patent eligibility. Rather, the implementation of the underlying idea must embody an \"inventive concept.\" The inventive concept must provide \"something extra\" that extends beyond the algorithm or other idea, if an otherwise patent-ineligible claim is to be saved from patent ineligibility--according to these cases and recent lower court decisions that follow in their wake.\n\n"}

Fecundity is similar to fertility, the natural capability to produce offspring. A lack of fertility is infertility while a lack of fecundity would be called sterility.\n\nHuman demography considers only human fecundity which is often intentionally limited through contraception, while population biology studies all organisms. The term fecundity in population biology is often used to describe the rate of offspring production after one time step (often annual). In this sense, fecundity may include both birth rates and survival of young to that time step. Fecundity is under both genetic and environmental control, and is the major measure of fitness. \"Fecundation\" is another term for fertilization. \"Superfecundity\" or \"retrofecundity\" refers to an organism's ability to store another organism's sperm (after copulation) and fertilize its own eggs from that store after a period of time, essentially making it appear as though fertilization occurred without sperm (i.e. parthenogenesis).\n\nFecundity is important and well studied in the field of population ecology. Fecundity can increase or decrease in a population according to current conditions and certain regulating factors. For instance, in times of hardship for a population, such as a lack of food, juvenile and eventually adult fecundity has been shown to decrease (i.e. due to a lack of resources the juvenile individuals are unable to reproduce, eventually the adults will run out of resources and reproduction will cease).\n\nFecundity has also been shown to increase in ungulates with relation to warmer weather.\n\nIn sexual evolutionary biology, especially in sexual selection, fecundity is contrasted to reproductivity.\n\nIn obstetrics and gynecology, fecundability is the probability of being pregnant in a single menstrual cycle, and fecundity is the probability of achieving a live birth within a single cycle.\n\n"}
{"id": "57240019", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57240019", "title": "Feminist philosophy of science", "text": "Feminist philosophy of science\n\nFeminist philosophy of science is a branch of philosophy that seeks to understand how the acquirement of knowledge through scientific means has been influenced by notions of gender and gender roles in society. Feminist philosophers of science question how scientific research and scientific knowledge itself may be influenced and possibly compromised by the social and professional framework within which that research and knowledge is established and exists. It has been described as being located \"at the intersections of the philosophy of science and feminist science scholarship\", and has attracted considerable attention since the 1970s.\n\nFeminist epistemology often emphasizes \"situated knowledge\" that hinges on one's individual perspectives on a subject. Feminist philosophers often highlight the under-representation of female scientists in academia and the possibility that science currently has androcentric biases. Scientific theory has been accused of being more compatible with male cognitive styles and reasoning. Feminist epistemology suggests that integrating feminine modes of thought and logic that are undervalued by current scientific theory will enable improvement and broadening of scientific perspectives. Advocates assert that it may be guide in creating a philosophy of science that is more accessible to public. Practitioners of feminist philosophy of science also seek to promote gender equality in scientific fields and greater recognition of the achievements of female scientists.\n\nCritics have argued that the political commitments of advocates of feminist philosophy of science is incompatible with modern-day scientific objectivity, emphasizing the success of the scientific method due to its lauded objectivity and \"value-free\" methods of knowledge-making.\n\nThe feminist Philosophy of science was born out of feminist science studies in the 1960s. It would however be the 1980s before Feminist Philosophy of Science would develop its own unique identity. One of the first and most important publications released was from a women’s academic journal called “Signs” with a piece titled: “Women, Science, and Society” This piece was published in August 1978 by Catherine Stimpson and Joan Burstyn. \"This first collection of what today would be recognizable as \"feminist science studies\" featured scholarship in three areas: critiques of gender bias in science, history of women in science, and social science data and public policy considerations on the status of women in the science\". These three topics have remained prominent issues in feminist science studies of modern day.\n\nFeminist science studies had become more philosophical and more ambitious by the 1980s and even pursued to redefine the core epistemological concepts. The reason for this shift in feminist science studies was due to a corresponding shift in many fields of academic feminism. This shift led to a parting of ways between scholarship on “women in science” and “feminist critiques of science”. This was documented by feminist scholars Helen Longino and Evelynn Hammonds in their 1990 book \"Conflicts and Tensions in the Feminist Study of Gender and Science\".\n\nBy the late nineties, feminist science studies had become well-established and had many prominent scholars within its field of study. Philosopher John Searle characterized feminism in 1993 as a “cause to be advanced” more so than a “domain to be studied”.\n\nSome have questioned the objectivity of Feminist Philosophy of Science. Feminists however argue that rather than undermine objectivity, incorporating feminist values could help create more robust and sophisticated research methods which in turn may well produce better balanced results.\n\nFeminist Philosophy of Science has traditionally been highly critical of the lack of access and opportunities for women in science and believe science can, and has been \"distorted by sexist values\" Sharon Crasnow highlights how the \"exclusion of women as researchers and subjects\" in scientific research, studies and projects can lead to questionable methods and methodologies and ultimately unreliable or inaccurate results. Feminists have come up with a new concept, one of a ‘successor science’, a \"different feminist science\". As it is not yet complete, the methodology is still up for debate as it mixes the subjectivity with the objectivity of science. What this successor science is quite hard to imagine especially when considering how successful modern science is. Some feminist philosophies of science revolve around asking if this success is due to objectivity which includes \"impartiality, neutrality, autonomy, and indifference to political positions and the values\". Feminists in this field discuss whether the objectivity in science is true and rational, independent of social and political factors. Feminist epistemology asks about the scientific method, standards of rationality, and the role gender plays in shaping knowledge. According to these feminists, this challenges the traditional view of objectivity.\n\nRelating to Objectivity, epistemology can give a fuller understanding of the nature of scientific knowledge. Feminist epistemology is one of a group of approaches in science studies that urges us to recognize the role of the social in the production of knowledge. Feminist epistemology directs people to consider features of themselves and culture as beings of knowledge that had been outside what was considered appropriate. The goals of researchers and the values that shape the choice of goals are relevant to the knowledge we arrive at. This has implications both for how we train scientists and for how we educate everyone about science. If science is seen as more connected to application, more related to human needs and desires, traditionally underrepresented groups will have greater motivation to succeed and persist in their science courses or pursue scientific careers. Motivation will be greater as members of underrepresented groups see how science can produce knowledge that has value to their concerns in ways that are consistent with good scientific methodology. Feminist epistemology urges a continued exploration of science in this way and so has much to offer science education.\n\nOne of the major challenges facing feminist philosophers of science lies in convincing some skeptics in the fields of philosophy and science that Feminist Philosophy of Science is in fact a legitimate and objective field of academic research and study rather than an agenda driven ideology. Dr. Richardson points out that those who level this accusation at Feminist Philosophy of Science completely misunderstand its motivations and ambitions. Richardson describes how many feminist philosophers of science are involved in \"ambitious constructive projects to build a better science\". Case studies have played a major role in furthering and advancing feminist philosophy of science. For example, a study conducted by Lloyd in 2005 on the function female orgasm. She explores how evolutionary biologists made false assumptions as to the function of the female orgasm. They believed that it must have reproductive purpose in females simply because it does in males. They went as far as to ignore clear evidence as it went against their initial beliefs. This critique caused extensive debate as it attacked the core beliefs held by evolutionary biologists. Work like this has and is currently being conducted by feminist philosophers of science as they challenge traditional philosophical questions such as pluralism, objectivity and background assumptions.\n\nOne of the greatest challenges faced by female philosophers is marginalization within the academic field of philosophy according to Dr. Richardson. They face exclusion in scientific fields and are marginalized and vastly unrepresented similarly to minorities in the field of philosophy. Their critiques of many topics such as gender bias are often changed, distorted and ineffectively translated by scientists and therefore by the general public.\n"}

There are two branches of the functionality doctrine: utilitarian functionality and aesthetic functionality. The rationale behind functionality doctrine is that product markets would not be truly competitive if newcomers could not make a product with a feature that consumers demand. Utilitarian functionality provides grounds to deny federal trademark protection to product features which do something useful. Patent law, not trademark, protects useful processes, machines, and material inventions. Patented designs are presumed to be functional until proven otherwise. Aesthetic functionality provides grounds to deny trademark protection to design features which are included to make the product more aesthetically appealing and commercially desirable. Aesthetic features are within the purview of copyright law, which provides protection to creative and original works of authorship.\n\nCourts will look to the following factors when determining utilitarian functionality:\n\nAs of 2014 the federal circuit courts are split on their utilitarian functionality analysis. Most circuits, such as the Fifth Circuit and the Sixth Circuit follow the Supreme Court's analysis in \"TrafFix Devices, Inc. v. Marketing Displays, Inc.\", which focuses on whether the feature is essential to the use or purpose of the product. The Federal Circuit in contrast focuses its analysis on whether permitting a product feature to be trademarked would impair competitors.\n\nIn the United States, the “functionality” doctrine exists to stop a party from obtaining exclusive trade dress or trademark rights in the functional features of a product or its packaging. The doctrine developed as a way to preserve the division between what trademark law protects and areas that are better protected by patent or copyright law. Thus, the functionality doctrine serves to prevent trademark owners from inhibiting legitimate competition \n\nWhen the aesthetic development of the good is intended to enhance the design and make the product more commercially desirable, trademark protection may be denied because the consumer is drawn to the design. The distinctiveness of the mark serves to identify the product rather than the source, and trademark protection becomes inappropriate. The underlying theory as aesthetics become integrated with functionality, the resulting product strongly resembles product design, which may receive no trademark protection absent secondary meaning.\n\nThis defense is generally seen in the fashion industry. Clothing brands can only be protected if they've acquired secondary meaning, and most of clothing design is held to be functional and is afforded no protection.\n\n"}

{"id": "12362106", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12362106", "title": "Knowledge mobilization", "text": "Knowledge mobilization\n\nThe term knowledge mobilization (KMb) refers to moving available knowledge (often from formal research) into active use. More than just \"bridging the gap\", KMb seeks to make connections between research/expertise and policy/practice in order to improve outcomes in various organizations or sectors. KMb involves knowledge sharing between research producers (e.g. university researchers) and research users (including professionals or others whose work can benefit from research findings), often with the help of third parties or intermediaries. The concept has grown out of increasing recognition that verified empirical knowledge should be the basis for many policies and practices.\nSocial science research deals with the people side of quality of life issues and nation-building that are so crucial to the future of humanity. Human, technological and cultural developments are needed for economic prosperity, environmental sustainability, social harmony and cultural vitality. Yet using research in the social sciences presents particular challenges because the issues are often complex and long-term, and deeply affected by local contexts.\n\nThe term KMb gained wider use following the publication of the evaluation report of the Community-University Research Alliance (CURA) program of the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) in 2004. This led SSHRC to create a division of Knowledge Products and Mobilization to enhance and accelerate the movement of research findings into policy and program development. Although many other terms are used to describe this same work, KMb, or knowledge mobilization, is the term most often used by the social science and humanities fields in Canada.\n\nAs in many other areas of social science, many different terms and approaches are used to define the knowledge mobilization process in different sectors and disciplines. The health sector often uses the term knowledge translation, whereas the business sector uses knowledge management, and so on. The Research Supporting Practice in Education (RSPE) Team at the University of Toronto – Ontario Institute for Studies in Education has created a synthesized list of the various terms and definitions currently being used.\n\nThere is considerable overlap between different terms but the subtle differences can affect our understanding of the topic. For example, the term Knowledge Transfer, implies that knowledge is like an object that can be given from one person to another, whereas terms such as Knowledge Exchange or Knowledge Mobilization imply that knowledge is altered as it passes from person to person. However, regardless of the term, the underlying intent in all cases is to make research matter more in policy and practice for organizational and system improvement.\nThe term 'knowledge' also carries multiple meanings. Some literature describes two types of knowledge; explicit and tacit. Tacit knowledge is gained through personal experience, and is difficult to codify and transfer; where explicit knowledge is often instrumental and can be more easily transported through various mediums. KMb tends to focus on explicit knowledge derived from formal research, while recognizing that tacit knowledge is also very important in practice.\n\nEven within formal research settings, there is often disagreement about how much and what kinds of evidence provide sufficient warrant to claim that something is 'knowledge'.\nA similar debate exists over what can be regarded as 'use' of research, with considerable evidence showing that research has an impact in diffuse ways and sometimes over long periods of time A detailed definition of knowledge mobilization, in relation to other practices such as community engagement, can be found on the website of the Institute for Community Engaged Scholarship.\n\nKnowledge mobilization is a proactive process that involves specific efforts to build relationships between research producers and users, such as formal and informal events, networks, and collaboration on resources for research use. The broad concept of knowledge mobilization encompasses a variety of strategies, including producer push (where researchers do the work of trying to share knowledge), user pull (where research users seek information), knowledge exchange and the co-production of knowledge. These strategies may be informal or formal and can take place in many different places and ways.\n\nThe internet has become the prime vehicle through which research knowledge is shared, although direct personal connections among people remain a powerful means of sharing knowledge. In some fields or organizations there are specific roles for knowledge mobilization specialists (whose roles may have various names) to find, evaluate, synthesize and summarize findings to tailor and maximize the use of relevant and appropriate research. The goal is to replace practices based on belief with evidence-based practices in order to produce more effective outcomes. Researchers and research users can both benefit from the interaction required by KMb. Collaboration among various parties can improve the research enterprise as well by facilitating more relevant and effective scholarship as well as increased take-up of research findings.\n\nKnowledge brokers or intermediaries act as bridges between the users and producers of the knowledge. Such brokering is essential to ensure that the right information is available to the right people, at the right time and in the right format. These ideas of quality research informed by the needs of research users, accurate interpretation, open access and just-in-time service are the bases for good researcher-user interface, often provided by knowledge brokers who can synthesize a large body of research and look for policy and practice implications that facilitate use of research results. Many different individuals and organizations play a brokering or intermediary role, from think tanks to lobby groups to political parties to professional or trade associations, to promoters of particular products or strategies. These various bodies may have very different motivations and degrees of objectivity in their approach. Much brokering occurs as part of political debate, in which the contention among ideas is part of broader political processes.\n\nResearch into the role of knowledge brokering in the UK health sector found that key individuals often play a major role in knowledge mobilization. A large study of knowledge mobilization by University of Oxford researchers found effective 'knowledge leadership' is crucial to moving evidence-based research into organizational practice, and creating 'epistemic fit'.\n\nThe Canadian Health Services Research Foundation (CHSRF), which has made extensive use of knowledge brokering and promoted evidence-informed decision making in the health services field, has developed extensive tools and resources that are finding use outside the health field. Similarly, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) have developed the idea of knowledge translation as a means to make better use of research in the health field. The RSPE provides many examples of and resources for knowledge brokering.\n\nNetworks are an important mechanism to support KMb. A number of KMb networks support professional knowledge brokers and the practice of KMb. ResearchImpact-RéseauImpact Recherche (RIR) is Canada's KMb network. Led by York University in Toronto, and pioneered by the work of David Phipps, it includes knowledge brokers from York University, Memorial University of Newfoundland and Labrador, Université du Québec à Montréal, Université de Montréal, Carleton University, University of Guelph, University of Saskatchewan, Kwantlen Polytechnic University, University of Victoria, McMaster University, and University of New Brunswick. (DRUSSA) is a network of 24 universities developing professional supports for research uptake (=KMb). The Canadian (KTECoP) has over 800 members and has chapters in Toronto, Ottawa and Vancouver. Ed Comms (www.educationcommunities.org) is the open to all knowledge mobilization network supported by a world wide network universities and educational organisations that form the Education Futures Collaboration (www.edfuturescollaboration.org). A core goal of Ed Comms is to link researchers and research users and to support educators to find others interested in collaborative working particularly to scale up small scale research so that educational research can be more impactful.\n\nMovements such as open access and open data can play a positive role in KMb. Access to scholarly research and data sets has increased partly as a result of these movements, as well as greater digitization and dissemination of resources by government and NGOs. However, many institutions do not yet make their research publicly available, lack an open access repository or directory, or have well organized websites for posting research-based resources. However access to research is not nearly sufficient for Knowledge Mobilization, as the main barriers to research use are less a matter of knowing than they are of the capacity and motivation to use that knowledge in practice.\n\nThe field of KMb has been developing for about 50 years now. A good review of this work is in Estabrooks et al. (2008) There are many excellent research articles examining research utilization. In 2007, Sandra Nutley and colleagues from the Research Unit for Research Utilization (RURU) at the University of Edinburgh published one of the most comprehensive guides to KMb, \"Using Evidence: How Research Can Inform Public Services\", which identifies three interacting domains: research production, research use, and the intermediary process that links these two domains. This book provides an extensive review of the literature on research utilization from traditional constructs to contemporary design, from the practice and policy perspectives, and examines strategies to enhance research utilization and measure the impact of research use.\n\nMany resources regarding this field, including definitions, conceptual models and links to other organizations, can be found on the website of the RSPE team at the University of Toronto's Ontario Institute for Studies in Education (OISE) and at KMbeing.com. A recent review of current research in knowledge mobilization can be found in the London Review of Education.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "24760475", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24760475", "title": "Michael Gottlieb Birckner", "text": "Michael Gottlieb Birckner\n\nMichael Gottlieb Birckner (21 August 1756 – 1 December 1798) was a Danish priest and philosopher.\n\nBirckner especially explored the subject of Freedom of Speech. The American historian H. Arnold Barton has characterised Birckner, along with Niels Ditlev Riegels, as being one of \"the most original thinkers\" of the radical group of authors in Denmark in this period. The Danish jurist Peter Germer in his book \"The Nature of Freedom of Speech\" (\"Ytringsfrihedens Væsen\", 1973) shows that Birckners ideas was akin to ideas that Scottish-American philosopher Alexander Meiklejohn proposed in his \"Free Speech and Its Relation to Self-Government\" (1948).\n\nMichael Gottlieb Birckner was born in Copenhagen. At age 3 he lost his mother, Anna Marie (born Wiborg), and half a year later his father, brickmason Johan Michael Birckner, died. The city mortician took in the orphan, and in due time Birckner graduated from the city's Latin school in 1772. He achieved his theological degree in 1784. He had also spent his time at the university studying philosophy and philology, and he especially excelled in modern languages, he spoke German like a native and he wrote verses in English. He wanted a position as a priest, but he disliked the parlors of the rich and powerful, so he did not achieve a call until 1790. The position was as a German minister on the isolated island of Föhr which was part of the kingdom of Denmark-Norway at the time.\n\nBefore Birckner left the capital he had become a proponent of the philosophy of Immanuel Kant, which at that time was becoming popular in Denmark. But he was also under the influence of the radical French anti-clergy rationalism. He had published an article in the influential Danish periodical \"Minerva\" with the title \"An answer to the question: Should the nobility be suppressed?\" (July 1790). His answer to the question in the title was affirmative, provided that the privileges of nobility is an injustice and that the burgher can become \"that which at present only the nobility is, without upsetting society as a whole\". The article was soon translated into German and a reviewer of the \"Göttingische gelärdes Anzeigen\" (1792, p. 1899) praised it highly.\n\nBirckners stay at Föhr did not turn out to be as desolate as he and his friends had feared. He passed his time with studies, social visits and a pursuit to \"form a young man into a productive citizen\". The inhabitants of the island was pleased by his \"philosophical\" preachings which he held every third Sunday. He did express regret at not being within easy reach of the literary means of the capital, but he learned to pass his time thinking instead. It became his habit to first think a subject matter through in his mind before reading what others had written about it. He especially worked on the problem about the freedom of press and its limits, which among other things the recent conviction of the satiric poet Peter Andreas Heiberg had incurred in Danish debate. In his solitude he expressed his thoughts on the matter in writing and the first of his many treaties on the subject was published in \"Minerva\" in March 1791.\n\nThe following year he was surprised to learn that his friends had petitioned on his behalf for the chaplaincy in Korsør. In the beginning he was not pleased with the transition to the small provincial town in Zealand, because he had to preach twice every Sunday instead of once every third Sunday. But after making the move, little by little his sentiments changed. He regularly was present by the dinner table of the vicar Frederik Plum, who later became bishop of Fyn, and Birckner found company with which to share his spiritual and philosophical sentiments. It was at the Plums that he met Henriette Christine Hornemann, the daughter of vicar Jacob Hornemann, sister of the philosopher Christian Hornemann, and in 1795 he married this gifted young woman.\n\nThe journey to his new position had incurred a coughing sickness which over time became very serious. His income was very low, and he often suffered from want so badly that he at one time considered giving up the chaplaincy in favour of a position as a teacher and letting his wife contribute to the household by letting her serve as a chambermaid.\n\nBut neither his sickness nor his poverty prevented him from continuing his philosophical endeavours. When the bishop of Zealand Nicolai Balle Edinger had reported the poet Malthe Conrad Bruuns recently published book \"The Catechism of the Aristocrats\" (\"Aristocraternes Catechismus\", 1796) to the authorities for infringing the press laws, Birckner anonymously published a small tract which criticised the bishop for playing the part of head of police instead of minding his ecclesiastical pursuits.\n\nHowever his real struggle for freedom of the press was not carried out anonymously. He had already previously shown that the Danish laws regarding this subject did not allow for a complete freedom of the press. It was to achieve this goal that he published his major work \"On the Freedom of the Press and its Law\" (\"Om Trykkefriheden og dens Love\", 1797).\n\nIn this book he claims the importance of freedom of press as a powerful means of putting ideas into circulation and thereby enlighten the monarch of things that he would otherwise have been ignorant of. He also writes about it being a \"revolution from above\", when a \"noble and patriotic\" man, \"brimming with feelings for the general good of man\", at once appear among the powerful and without restraint \"sacrifices his own splendor and absolutism\". These words were aimed at the reigning crown prince Frederick, who had shown considerable influences from the tolerant enlightenment ideas in his early years on the throne.\n\nBut Birckner does not only demand freedom to write about the affairs of government, he also demands freedom of speech in matters of religion. He shows that the way to achieve insight into the \"moral truths\" can only happen by discussing it in the open. However Birckner does propose some limits on the freedom of press, he does not think it should be allowed to publicly call for rebellion, that is urging the people to overthrow the constitution of the state or in other ways oppose the actions of the government with physical force. Neither, Birckner says, should it be allowed to defame the private affairs of a man in his home, something which has no public interest and it violates the private sphere of the individual.\n\nThe book became a bestseller in Denmark-Norway. A second revised and improved edition appeared the same year, and a third printing was made for the first volume of the \"Collected Works\" of Birckner (a work which had 2.100 subscribers at the beginning of its publication, a very high figure in Danish literary history). Furthermore, he translated the book into German and it was printed in the German periodical \"Beiträge zur Verdlung die Menschheit\", 2. vol., 1. part, 1797, and the same year published as a stand-alone work under the title \"Ueber die Preszfreiheit und ihre Gesetze, von dem Verfasser selbst aus dem Dänishcen übersetzt, durchgesehen und herausgegeben von C.J.R. Christiani\", Kopenhagen und Leipzig.\n\nThese ideas met opposition from several contemporary writers. Some thought Birckner went too far in his support of free speech, while others thought there should be no limits whatsoever. This prompted Birckner to publish his \"Further Reflections on the Freedom of Press and its Laws\" (\"Videre Undersøgelser om Trykkefriheden og dens Love\") the following year (1798). His response is especially aimed at the criticism posed by professor Johan Frederik Vilhelm Schlegel. Only at one point in this book does he change his stance from his previous work, and that is only \"half unwillingly\" he thinks that writers who \"with their filthy imagination attempts to awaken impure desires in his readers\", these individuals should be sentenced \"a fitting punishment\". His \"half unwillingness\" for this stems from the fact that he sees \"what the result would be, of such a power administered by the judges of geniuses, and how easily such a power can be abused most savagely... And yet, all art and beauty be damned, if it misleads just a single person to stray from the path of virtue\".\n\nHis struggle for freedom of speech was not looked upon favorably in government circles. Nevertheless, he was appointed vicar of Vemmelev and Hammershøj 28 November 1798, an appointment that would have meant the end of his poverty. But this royal grace came too late, his illness had become lethal and he died 1 December the same year. His contribution to Danish literature was first acknowledged after his death. His friends praised his character and 2100 subscribers signed up for the first edition of his collected works. Furthermore, they collected 2500 rigsdaler that was donated to his grieving widow and children. .\n\nBirckner had already begun working on a collected edition of his works prior to his death. This collection was to include all his writings except the two anonymous tracts against bishop Balle. He did manage to publish three volumes of this collection, and the fourth volume was published in 1800 edited by Anders Sandøe Ørsted and prefaced by an account of the last days of Birckner written by dean Frederik Carl Gutfeld (\"Samlede Skrifter\", 4 vols., 1797-1800).\n\n\n"}

It is the \"lesser evil\" in the lesser of two evils principle, which provides that when given two bad choices, the one that is not as bad as the other is better than the one that is the greater threat.\n\nThe \"Oxford Dictionary of Word Origins\" asserts that \"[t]he idea of a necessary evil goes back to Greek\", describing the first necessary evil as marriage, and further stating that, \"The first example in English, from 1547, refers to a woman.\" Thomas Fuller, in his 1642 work, \"The Holy State and the Profane State\", made another of the earliest recorded uses of the phrase when he described the court jester as something that \"...some count a necessary evil in a Court\". In \"Common Sense\", Thomas Paine described government as at best a \"necessary evil\".\n\nEvil as a concept is defined by the fact of acts done, considered to be contrary to morality, in other words, sinful, and the execution of any act by an individual, the defining value of the act, is harm is done (in an archaic sense, this indicates acts causing repulsion or discomfort), additionally, the act is classified as, \"profoundly immoral\". \n\nThis being true, the use of the term \"evil\" in the phrase does not necessarily indicate that the thing being characterized as a \"necessary evil\" is something that is generally considered an \"evil\" in the sense of being immoral or the enemy of the good. In Fuller's use of the phrase, for example, there is no implication that court jesters are evil people, or having one serves an evil end. The term is most typically used to identify something that is merely an inconvenience or annoyance. Where an author suggests that, \"[P]aperwork is a necessary evil, despised but handled with the understanding that a mistake – even a trivial one – could be costly.\" it is understood that the author is not deeming \"paperwork\" to be wicked, immoral, or evil in senses comparable to those.Some thinkers specifically reject the idea of anything that is actually \"evil\" being necessary. This may manifest as an admonition for moral people to avoid participating in the activities that are perceived as evil:\n\nAlternately, this may manifest as a call to eliminate systems that contain aspects perceived as evil, and replace them with systems that avoid these aspects. For example, speaking of political parties in the Parliament of the United Kingdom, one author wrote:\n\nItalian physician Philip Mazzei, in his correspondence with Thomas Jefferson in the 1770s, qualified a necessary evil as a restriction without which even greater evils would arise:\n\n\ndictionary definition Cambridge Dictionary Accessed February 11, 2018 \n"}

{"id": "839045", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=839045", "title": "Phronesis", "text": "Phronesis\n\nPhronesis () is an Ancient Greek word for a type of wisdom or intelligence. It is more specifically a type of wisdom relevant to practical action, implying both good judgement and excellence of character and habits, or practical virtue. Phronesis was a common topic of discussion in ancient Greek philosophy. \n\nThe word was used in Greek philosophy, and such discussions are still influential today. In Aristotelian ethics, for example in the \"Nicomachean Ethics\", it is distinguished from other words for wisdom and intellectual virtues – such as \"episteme\" and \"techne\". Because of its practical character, when it is not simply translated by words meaning wisdom or intelligence, it is often translated as \"practical wisdom\", and sometimes (more traditionally) as \"prudence\", from Latin . Thomas McEvilley has proposed that the best translation is \"mindfulness\".\n\nIn some of his dialogues, Plato showed his teacher Socrates proposing that having \"phronēsis\" is the same as being a virtuous person. By thinking with \"phronēsis\", a person has virtue. Therefore, all virtuousness is a form of phronēsis. In the mind of Socrates \"phronēsis\" equals virtue, they are the same thing. Being good, is to be an intelligent or reasonable person with intelligent and reasonable thoughts. \"Phronēsis\" allows a person to have moral or ethical strength.\n\nIn Plato's Meno, Socrates explains how \"phronēsis\", a quality synonymous with \"moral understanding\", is the most important attribute to learn, although it cannot be taught and is instead gained through the development of the understanding of one's own self.\n\nIn the 6th book of his \"Nicomachean Ethics\", Plato's student and friend Aristotle famously distinguished between two intellectual virtues: \"sophia\" (wisdom) and \"phronesis\", and described the relationship between them and other intellectual virtues. \"Sophia\" is a combination of nous, the ability to discern reality, and \"epistēmē\", a type of knowledge which is logically built up and teachable, and which is sometimes equated with science. This involves reasoning concerning universal truths. \"Phronesis\" involves not only the ability to decide how to achieve a certain end, but also the ability to reflect upon and determine good ends consistent with the aim of living well overall.\n\nAristotle points out that although \"sophia\" is higher and more serious than \"phronesis\", the highest pursuit of wisdom and happiness requires both, because \"phronesis\" facilitates \"sophia\". He also associates \"phronesis\" with political ability.\n\nAccording to Aristotle's theory of rhetoric, \"phronesis\" is one of the three types of appeal to character (\"ethos\"). The other two are respectively appeals to \"arete\" (virtue) and \"eunoia\" (goodwill).\n\nGaining \"phronesis\" requires experience, according to Aristotle who wrote that:...although the young may be experts in geometry and mathematics and similar branches of knowledge [\"sophoi\"], we do not consider that a young man can have Prudence [\"phronimos\"]. The reason is that Prudence [\"phronesis\"] includes a knowledge of particular facts, and this is derived from experience, which a young man does not possess; for experience is the fruit of years.\n\n\"Phronesis\" is concerned with particulars, because it is concerned with how to act in particular situations. One can learn the principles of action, but applying them in the real world, in situations one could not have foreseen, requires experience of the world. For example, if one knows that one should be honest, one might act in certain situations in ways that cause pain and offense; knowing how to apply honesty in balance with other considerations and in specific contexts requires experience.\n\nAristotle holds that having \"phronesis\" is both necessary and sufficient for being virtuous; because \"phronesis\" is practical, it is impossible to be both \"phronetic\" and akratic; i.e., prudent persons cannot act against their \"better judgement.\"\n\nIn light of his fundamental ontology, Martin Heidegger interprets Aristotle in such a way that \"phronesis\" (and practical philosophy as such) is the original form of knowledge and thus primary to \"sophia\" (and theoretical philosophy).\n\nHeidegger interprets the \"Nicomachean Ethics\" as an ontology of Human Existence. The practical philosophy of Aristotle is a guiding thread in his Analysis of Existence according to which facticity names our unique mode of being in the world. Through his ‘existential analytic’, Heidegger recognises that ‘Aristotelian phenomenology’ suggests three fundamental movements of life including \"póiesis\", \"práxis\", \"theoría\" and that these have three corresponding dispositions: \"téchne\", \"phrónesis\" and \"sophía\". Heidegger considers these as modalities of Being inherent in the structure of \"‘Dasein’\" as being-in-the-world that is situated within the context of concern and care. According to Heidegger phronesis in Aristotle’s work discloses the right and proper way to be \"Dasein\". Heidegger sees phronesis as a mode of comportment in and toward the world, a way of orienting oneself and thus of caring-seeing-knowing and enabling a particular way of being concerned. \n\nWhile \"techne\" is a way of being concerned with things and principles of production and theoria a way of being concerned with eternal principles, phronesis is a way of being concerned with one’s life (qua action) and with the lives of others and all particular circumstances as purview of praxis. Phronesis is a disposition or habit, which reveals the being of the action while deliberation is the mode of bringing about the disclosive appropriation of that action. In other words, deliberation is the way in which the phronetic nature of \"Dasein’s\" insight is made manifest. \n\nPhronesis is a form of circumspection, connected to conscience and resoluteness respectively being-resolved in action of human existence (\"Dasein\") as \"práxis\". As such it discloses the concrete possibilities of being in a situation, as the starting point of meaningful action, processed with resolution, while facing the contingencies of life.\nHowever Heidegger’s ontologisation has been criticised as closing \"práxis\" within a horizon of solipsistic decision that deforms its political sense that is its practico-political configuration (Volpi, 2007).\nIn \"After Virtue\", Alasdair MacIntyre called for a phronetic social science. He points out that for every prediction made by a social scientific theory there are usually counter-examples. Hence the unpredictability of human beings and human life requires a focus on practical experiences.\n\n\n"}

He studied at the Sorbonne between 1946–1947. In 1961, he graduated from the École Pratique des Hautes Études, where he would become the Director of Studies from 1964 to 1986. He was eventually named professor at the Collège de France in 1982, where he held the Chair of History in Hellenistic and Roman Thought (\"chaire d'histoire de la pensée hellénistique et romaine\"). In 1991, he retired from this position to become \"professeur honoraire\" at the collège; his last lecture was on May 22 of the same year. He concluded the class saying, \"In the last analysis, we can scarcely talk about what is most important.\"\n\nHadot was married to the historian of philosophy, Ilsetraut Hadot.\n\nHadot was one of the first authors to introduce Ludwig Wittgenstein's thought into France. Hadot suggested that one cannot separate the form of Wittgenstein's \"Philosophical Investigations\" from their content. Wittgenstein had claimed that philosophy was an illness of language and Hadot notes that the cure required a particular type of literary genre.\n\nHadot is also famous for his analysis on the conception of philosophy during Greco-Roman antiquity. Hadot identified and analyzed the \"spiritual exercises\" used in ancient philosophy (influencing the thought of Michel Foucault in the second and third volumes of his \"History of Sexuality\"). By \"spiritual exercises\" Hadot means \"practices ... intended to effect a modification and a transformation in the subjects who practice them. The philosophy teacher's discourse could be presented in such a way that the disciple, as auditor, reader, or interlocutor, could make spiritual progress and transform himself within.\" Hadot shows that the key to understanding the original philosophical impulse is to be found in Socrates. What characterizes Socratic therapy above all is the importance given to living contact between human beings.\n\nHadot's recurring theme is that philosophy in Antiquity was characterized by a series of spiritual exercises intended to transform the perception, and therefore the being, of those who practice it; that philosophy is best pursued in real conversation and not through written texts and lectures; and that philosophy, as it is taught in universities today, is for the most part a distortion of its original, therapeutic impulse. He brings these concerns together in \"What Is Ancient Philosophy?\", which has been critically reviewed.\n\n(Only translations into English are included in this list).\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4987062", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4987062", "title": "Policraticus", "text": "Policraticus\n\nPolicraticus was the first book of political science to be produced during the Middle Ages. Written by John of Salisbury around 1159, it belongs to the genre of advice literature known as \"mirrors for princes\", and is addressed to the territorial ruler. Though it takes up a wide variety of ethical questions, it is most famous for attempting to define the responsibilities of kings and their relationship to their subjects. \n\nPolicraticus is a pseudo Greco-Roman neologism term, meaning \"the statesman.\" Salisbury drew his arguments from several different sources, including the Bible and the Justinian Code. He argued for the divine right of kings, saying that\n\n...the prince stands on a pinnacle which is exalted and made splendid with all the great and high privileges which he deems necessary for himself. And rightly so, because nothing is more advantageous to the people than that the needs of the prince should be fully satisfied; since it is impossible that his will should be found opposed to justice. Therefore, according to the usual definition, the prince is the public power, and a kind of likeness on earth of the divine majesty. Beyond doubt a large share of the divine power is shown to be in princes by the fact that at their nod men bow their necks and for the most part offer up their heads to the axe to be struck off, and, as by a divine impulse, the prince is feared by each of those over whom he is set as an object of fear. And this I do not think could be, except as a result of the will of God. For all power is from the Lord God, and has been with Him always, and is from everlasting.\n\nThis divine source allowed princes to wage just wars and required all subjects to submit to the prince's will. Salisbury argued that the prince had four responsibilities: Revere God, adore his subjects, exert self-discipline and instruct his ministers. Salisbury advocated strict punishments for lèse majesté, but argued that a prince should err on the side of mercy and compassion when enforcing his laws.\n\nWhile recognizing a prince's supreme temporal power, Salisbury argued that princes must be subordinate to the will of God and the Church.\n\nFor myself, I am satisfied and persuaded that loyal shoulders should uphold the power of the ruler; and not only do I submit to his power patiently, but with pleasure, so long as it is exercised in subjection to God and follows His ordinances. But on the other hand if it resists and opposes the divine commandments, and wishes to make me share in its war against God; then with unrestrained voice I answer back that God must be preferred before any man on earth. Therefore inferiors should cleave and cohere to their superiors, and all the limbs should be in subjection to the head; but always and only on condition that religion is kept inviolate.\n\nIn Salisbury's mind, a tyrant sets a poor example for his people and could lead them from God. His example was the Roman Emperor Julian the Apostate, who attempted to restore Rome's pagan religion. In this case, Salisbury argued that killing a regent, when all other resources were exhausted, was not only justifiable but necessary, and he called a tyrant an \"image of depravity . . . [who] spring(s) from evil and should be cut down with the axe wherever he grows.\" This may be the first defense of tyrannicide to be written after Antiquity.\n\n"}
{"id": "54340115", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54340115", "title": "Poor Dionis", "text": "Poor Dionis\n\nPoor Dionis or Poor Dionysus (, originally spelled \"Sermanul Dionisie\"; also translated as \"Wretched Dionysus\" or \"The Sorrowful Dionis\") is an 1872 prose work by Romanian poet Mihai Eminescu, classified by scholars as either a novel, a novella or a modern fairy tale. It is a liberal interpretation of contemporary German philosophy and ancient motifs, discussing themes such as time travel and reincarnation through the lens of post-Kantian idealism. Its eponymous central character, a daydreaming scholar, moves between selves over time and space, between his miserable home, his earlier existence as a monk in 15th-century Moldavia, and his higher-level existence as a celestial Zoroaster.\n\n\"Poor Dionis\" is one of the first, and most characteristic, works of fantasy in Romanian literature, and one of the poet's last Romantic texts. Beyond its philosophical vocabulary, the story is Eminescu's intertextual homage to the founders of German Romanticism (E. T. A. Hoffman, Novalis) and modern French literature (Théophile Gautier). Read out by Eminescu upon his induction to \"Junimea\" literary club, it was dismissed as an incoherent oddity by critics of the day, and overlooked by researchers before 1900. It was then reevaluated by successive generations, beginning with the Romanian Symbolists, serving to inspire both the modernists and the postmodernists.\n\nTraditionally, \"Poor Dionis\" has intrigued researchers with its cultural complexity, discussed in connection with the Vedanta, Gnosticism, or the theory of relativity. Its unreliable depiction of the historical past is also noted in connection with invented tradition, in the context of Romanian nationalism, while its depiction of mundane contemporary scenes may offer autofictional insight into Eminescu's biography. Its favorable depiction of Jews and Judaism also caught attention, and was held in contrast to other works by Eminescu, which border on antisemitism. Various scholars, however, see \"Poor Dionis\" mainly as a work of sheer literary fancy.\n\nEminescu begins his story in mid-thought, with first-person musings about subjectivity, \"qualia\", time perception, and the physical world being \"our soul's dream\". The narrator then reveals that this is a quote from the amateur metaphysician Dionis. He describes the latter as an unkempt, but good looking, young Bucharester, reduced to poverty and prone to daydreaming. He is an orphan, born out of wedlock to a mysterious aristocrat and a priest's daughter. Although a passionate esotericist and reader of sacred books, Dionis is more of \"a superstitious atheist\".\n\nIn his miserable room, Dionis is studying an almanac of astrology, and listening, through the open window, to a girl singing; charmed by the sound, he sees (or imagines) the girl as a modern-day Ophelia. In this reverie, his eyes affixed on the zodiac, Dionis understands that he can freely travel back into the glorified past. He chooses for his destination ancient Moldavia, under the rule of Prince Alexander the Good. When he awakens, he finds himself on a meadow near Iași, dressed in Orthodox monastic clothes, and grasping the almanac. He is Friar Dan, who he has only dreamed of being Dionis, and the book is a present from his teacher, Ruben.\nRuben, a learned and pious Sephardi Jew living in exile at the \"Socola Academy\", has instructed his favorite pupil about \"metempsychosis\" and apport: \"you can slip into the lives of all the ones who led up to your life [and] into all the future lives caused by your present life\"; \"you can go any place you want, although you cannot leave it void behind you. [...] there's no such thing as fully vacant space.\" Simultaneous travel in spacetime, Ruben teaches, may only happen if one changes places with one's ancestors or descendants. Taking the Dionis experience as evidence that Ruben is right, Dan asks to be transported into an ideal universe, and is told by his master that such a place exists \"in your immortal soul\". If Dan wishes to reach it, he is to read every seventh page of a spell book: each will take him to a new place, in no known order, and no location can be visited twice. After Dan leaves, book in hand, Ruben is revealed to have been possessed by Satan, who takes joy at having ensnared a pious monk: the book is in fact an instrument of perdition.\n\nBack in his room, Dan decides to use the book for an egotistic purpose. He is in love with Maria, daughter of \"Spatharios\" Mesteacăn, and secretly wishes to kidnap her. As Dan weighs in the possibilities, his own shadow begins talking to him, telling him that the book he read was written by the prophet Zoroaster; and that he, Dan, as the reincarnation of Zoroaster, is entitled to use the book as he pleases. The monk and his shadow strike a deal: Dan will assign his mortal's identity to the shadow, while he himself will become a \"shape of light\", with the shadow's power to transcendent. Under this guise, Dionis visits Maria, and persuades her to make a similar exchange with her own shadow.\n\nAs a new Zoroaster, Dan carries his lover to the moon. No longer held back by the laws of physics, he rearranges the celestial sphere and the lunar landscape for Maria's pleasure, building her a heavenly abode, serviced by the angels and decorated with blue flowers; in this arrangement, Earth itself is a contemptible atom, consumed by hatred and war. Dan finds that the entire cosmos is his, except for the inaccessible \"dome of God\". He becomes obsessed with looking upon the divine countenance, and with reshaping the angels into instruments of his will; Dan begins to formulate a thought, that he himself may be God, and may not be remembering as much.\n\nWith this (half-uttered) blasphemy, everything is lost. Feeling himself expelled from Heaven, Dan reawakens as Dionis, and catches a glimpse of the singing girl: \"Ophelia\" is Dan's Maria. Still confused by his apparent change of status, and not being sure of himself, Dionis decides to write her a letter, confessing his affection. When, from the window, she shows him that the letter has impressed her, Dionis faints with emotion. He is carried to hospital by concerned philanthropists and makes a slow recovery, while Maria secretly arranges to have his room cleaned and refurbished. Dionis wakes up in a beautified home, with Maria watching over him. They become lovers.\n\nIn medieval Iași, Dan also experiences a rude awakening, and, like Dionis, is apparently ill. He is visited by a Jewish man, whom he takes for a \"kaftan\"- and \"payot\"-wearing Ruben—telling him that the shadow he left behind has written a precious memoir. \"Ruben\" reveals himself to be his book vendor, Riven, and denies any knowledge of their dialogues on metempsychosis. Despondent, Dan begins to suspect that he has been tricked by devils. Eminescu ends his account with a series of open questions, without revealing any explicit moral to the story.\n\nThe narrative came with Eminescu's \"conclusive notes\", and ends with a quote from Romantic poet Théophile Gautier, in Eminescu's own translation. They trace back a letter on drama, addressed to Gérard de Nerval and first published in the 1858 \"Histoire de l'art dramatique en France depuis vingt-cinq ans III\". Part of the fragment reads:\n\nEminescu finished writing his story during an extended study trip to Vienna. Reportedly, he first read it to friend and fellow writer Ioan Slavici, whose comments inaugurated a long sequence of negative criticism: at the time, Slavici described the work as merely \"bizarre\". Another Romanian colleague in Vienna, linguist Vasile Burlă, also found \"Poor Dionis\" to be of an \"extravagant and sensationalistic\" Romantic nature. Their claim to have known the work in its early stages is contrasted by the recollections of yet another Vienna student, Teodor V. Ștefanelli. He writes: \"Eminescu never shared with anyone what he was writing on, and if he had written something he would not even show it to his roommates, but locked away his manuscript. Hence, we got to know of \"Poor Dionis\" and all his poetry [of the period] only in their printed form.\"\n\nEminescu made a trip back to the country and, on September 1, 1872, read the story to his patrons at \"Junimea\"—his \"first-ever personal contact\" with that literary club. The \"Junimea\" literati gave \"Poor Dionis\" a lukewarm reception. As recorded by the society's official diary, \"Junimist\" doyens Titu Maiorescu and Vasile Pogor both noted that \"the ending and the resolution do not match into the whole structure\". According to literary historian Alexandru Piru, such reactions were merely myopic: \"The \"Junimists\" [...] did not notice that, at heart, with his use of fairy tale settings, Eminescu depicted the fate of the genius artist whom a hostile environment has condemned to a chimerical, deplorable, life.\" Nevertheless, Maiorescu and Pogor agreed to serialize \"Poor Dionis\" in the club's magazine, \"Convorbiri Literare\", where the first episode appeared on December 1, 1872.\n\nOne particularly virulent account of the \"Junimea\" reading survives in the memoirs of George Panu. Claiming to speak for the entire group, Panu recounted that the work read like \"a philosophical aberration\", \"as weak as they get\", without \"at least the characteristics of a fantasy novella\". Eminescu's biographers have dismissed Panu's claim as mystification. A lively opponent of Eminescu's national conservatism, Panu was not even in contact with \"Junimea\" when \"Poor Dionis\" was being presented for review. Not discouraged by the reception, Eminescu responded with a subtle satire, meant to be read as an addendum to \"Poor Dionis\": \"Cugetările Sărmanului Dionis\" (\"Poor Dionis' Musings\"). It was interwoven into the first installment of the story as published in \"Convorbiri Literare\".\n\n\"Poor Dionis\" remains a pioneering work in the fantasy and Romantic-era sub-chapters of Romanian literature. Romanian scholar Zoe Dumitrescu-Bușulenga describes Eminescu's \"grand novella\" as \"one of the most beautiful and most particular works of European Romanticism\". Luisa Valmarin, the Italian philologist, calls Eminescu's work \"the only philosophical novella produced by Romanian Romanticism\". Among the scholars who regard the story as primarily a novel, Eugen Lovinescu also described Dionis as one of the first and most important protagonists of the genre, as it had developed in Romania. Reviewing \"Junimea\"s reaction, the same Lovinescu also noted that \"Poor Dionis\" carried with it a culture shock, exposing Romania to \"Eminescu's hurricane of genius, bringing in all the elements of German sentimentality, filtered through a singular, personal, temperament.\"\n\nThe story signals some essential transitions in Eminescu's work. Luisa Valmarin writes that Eminescu stepped up from his early representations of the occult: in \"Strigoii\", the theme reconstructs an ancient mythology; in \"Poor Dionis\", occult symbols are borrowed for an actual escape into a magical universe. The move, she notes, \"prefigures\" Eminescu's poems. Somewhat different accounts are provided by scholars George Călinescu and Eugen Simion: the poem \"Mirodonis\", adapted from earlier Romanian folklore, seems to them a direct precursor of the Dionis narrative, especially when it comes to the poetic landscape. Researchers, beginning with Garabet Ibrăileanu, also describe \"Poor Dionis\" as a reprisal of Eminescu's \"youthful novel\", \"Geniu pustiu\", from which it borrowed whole fragments.\n\n\"Poor Dionis\" is rated by some exegetes (including Indian philologist Amita Bhose) as primarily a work of philosophical fiction. The historian and critic Nicolae Iorga merely saw the work as \"illegible, were it not for the beauty of each passage\". Any complex idea, Iorga argues, only spoke of Eminescu's fascination with philosophical tropes, and came out as \"bizarre\". Nae Ionescu, the controversial essayist and logician, also declared the work to be philosophically ambitious, but incoherent: \"All the discouraging lack of logic that characterizes this short story stands as evidence in anyone's eyes that Eminescu was not a philosopher.\" In his view, Eminescu merely tried to give a literary representation to Kantianism, and imitate the \"Critique of Pure Reason\". Philologist Alexandru Al. Philippide supposes that some \"subtle philosophical undertones\" might still exist in the account, but \"when it comes to the artistic achievement, the fairy tale most definitely enjoys primacy.\" The same conclusion is drawn by his colleague Perpessicius, who notes that any Kantian overtones are submerged under \"the prestige of the fairy tale.\" Constantin Noica took the work's ambitions more seriously, noting Eminescu's subtlety in rendering concepts that were new to Romanian philosophy, in particular his attempt to coin the term \"nefinire\" for \"infinite divisibility\".\n\nOthers suggest that the doubling of Dionis' being is not necessarily a purist philosophical commentary, and may in fact be tongue-in-cheek. Philosopher Horia-Roman Patapievici notes that, upon first reading the story as an adolescent, he traced its links with the views of Gottfried Leibniz and Immanuel Kant. Revisiting the project in 1996, he comments: \"I am no wiser today as to whether this thought is mere idiocy or not\". Dionis' detachment from his shadow may be a discreet self-mockery on Eminescu's part, as suggested by literary historians like Tudor Vianu and Vera Călin. They note that Eminescu follows to the letter a Romantic critique of the Kantian framework, wherein space and time are merely subjective realities. Likewise, critic Henric Sanielevici viewed the story as mainly a record of Dionis' break with positivism, his \"pulling into the past by an invisible hand.\"\n\nA trenchant point of view on the matter is expressed by G. Călinescu. \"Poor Dionis\", he writes, is merely \"a fantasy novella à la Théophile Gautier\", and, for all of Eminescu's intertextual clues, the reification of Kantian concepts cannot function. According to G. Călinescu's verdicts, Kant did not view time as subjective, but rather as a subject of physical phenomena—Eminescu's interpretation comes from Kantian critics like Arthur Schopenhauer and J. Fichte. Whether \"Poor Dionis\" is Kantian or Schopenhauerian has been the topic of dispute among other critics—according to philosopher Angela Botez, this is mainly because Schopenhauer, who fascinated young Eminescu, borrowed and revolutionized some of the core Kantian ideas. \"In truth\", she notes, \"from the philosophical musings that introduce the novella, and down to Dionis' metempsychosis, all this chaotic story is a powerful echo of Schopenhauerian philosophical categories.\" Shortly after \"Poor Dionis\", Eminescu penned a dialogue, \"Archaeus\", which ridiculed Kant's transcendental idealism, suggesting that even a gander could be better trusted to understand the world. According to Perpessicius, this piece is \"tied to \"Poor Dionis\" by direct threads\".\n\nVarious historiographers note that the concept of dreamed world precedes the German school by several generations, finding its literary expression in Calderón de la Barca's 1635 allegory, before arriving at Gautier. Eminescu's own perception of spacetime, as apparent in the story and in some poems (\"La steaua\", for instance), has intrigued Romanian students of physics, particularly after they became aware of Albert Einstein's theory of relativity. In 1928, Einstein received a letter from his Romanian admirer, Melania Șerbu, who informed him that \"Poor Dionis\" had anticipated his finds; Einstein kept corresponding with Șerbu, but did not show an interest in reading the story. In addition to investigating such connections herself, critic Ioana Em. Petrescu believed that the modern interest of \"Poor Dionis\", and of Eminescu's work in general, was given by its multiple levels, and especially by its hermeneutic suggestions. In her view, Zoroaster's book is a mirror of the world symbol, as in the deconstruction terminology coined by Jacques Derrida.\n\nThe story's various folkloric reminiscences are in part introduced by Romantic localism. They reach down through Christian mythology, into apocrypha, heresy and Gnosticism. In the 1960s, academic Rosa del Conte proposed that the text alluded to Babylonian religion, Buddhism, Orphism, Mithraism, and Bogomilism. Philologist Anca Voicu also writes that the Gnostic source, a borrowing from the \"fall of Sophia\" myth (with some echoes from the Book of Proverbs and other orthodox writs), is \"Poor Dionis\"s very \"narrative matter\". The angels' description is picked up directly from the Apocalypse of Paul, while the moonscape replicates visions of paradise found in ancestral Romanian stories. Ruben's hybrid appearance also follows early Romanian ideas about the physical attributes of wisdom. The ideal of an unreachable but desirable lady, seen from below, is described by historian of culture Ioan P. Culianu as a nod in the direction of damsel in distress mythology.\n\nAmong the Eminescu scholars, Bhose has pleaded for the work to be seen as one of Eminescu's Hindu-inspired contributions. She believes that, beyond adopting Kantian and Schopenhauerian discourse, \"Poor Dionis\" incorporates echoes from Vedanta philosophy and the Upanishads (known to have been read in translation by young Eminescu), even though, she asserts, the text does not follow such ideas to the letter. Bhose sees the novella as akin to the \"Advaita Vedanta\", the metaphysical school of Adi Shankara. Shankara preached that all the selves in the cosmos are reflections of a formless divine presence. Also according to Bhose, concepts such as time perception and reincarnation came to Eminescu by way of Hindu philosophy.\n\nBeyond its seeming cultivation of German philosophy, \"Poor Dionis\" is stylistically an homage to German Romanticism. It is most closely related to late-18th-century fantasy works by E. T. A. Hoffmann or Novalis. Among the Eminescu scholars, Perpessicius, Philippide, Simion and Constantin Ciopraga see a special connection between Dionis and Heinrich von Ofterdingen, the \"Blue Flower\" minstrel of Novalis' prose. In addition to this floral motif, Eminescu takes from Novalis the whole narrative device of dream sequences, and the uchronic worldview of \"magical idealism\". From Adelbert von Chamisso, the Romanian writer borrowed a \"man without a shadow\" motif that had already inspired him to write the 1869 short story \"My Shadow\". Eminescu's characterology is described by several authors as a nod in the direction of J. W. Goethe and his \"Faust\", which also tells the story of an ill-adjusted savant reclaiming the universe.\n\nDumitrescu-Bușulenga proposes that Eminescu's Hoffmann-like Romanticism, with more distant echoes from Gothic fiction, takes on German philosophical concepts only as a literary device, while comparatist Matei Călinescu sees both Hoffmann and Eminescu as authors interested in the \"absurd\" side of fantasy. He argues that, in \"Poor Dionis\", readers are slowly immersed into \"a mellow chaos of signs\", rather than confronted with sheer Gothic terror. As read by Botez, the resolution of \"Poor Dionis\" appears to be \"mocking the readers\" and their expectation of logical coherence. Following patterns found in Hoffmann and Jean Paul, this technique also announced developments in postmodern literature.\n\n\"Cugetările\", a rhyming companion to the novella, have thus been read as \"typically Romantic\" self-irony, \"bohemian cynicism\", or a \"grave parody\". According to Vera Călin, the addendum \"wittingly paraphrases\" Schopenhauerian philosophy, in the playful key of \"Tomcat Murr\". The core stanzas are Eminescu's mock defense of an idle and imbecilic feline, who may be the dreamer of the world:\n\nThe joke is on several poets cultivated by \"Junimea\", who were entirely different in style and approach. Draft versions of the poem specify the main targets: \"Junimist\" poet-soldier Theodor Șerbănescu, and, beyond him, the \"Young Germany\" idol Heinrich Heine. In \"Cugetările\", Eminescu introduces the derisive neologisms \"a heiniza\", \"to Heinefy\", and \"motănime\", \"cat swarm\", which alternate and contrast with words from the deeper layers of the Romanian lexis. Like some German theorists of the day, Eminescu was convinced that \"gen'rous youngsters\" everywhere had made it their mission to destroy civilization, referring to them as \"idiots\" with \"rotten bodies\"; as noted by scholar Ioana Pârvulescu, Dionis is ostensibly a poet by vocation, capable of putting together accomplished verse on a dare. The \"Cugetările\" addendum, Simion believes, explains that \"Poor Dionis\" should not be read as a passive and contemplative scenario: \"The image of the world as the insipid dream of a tomcat seems a daring minimization of philosophical concepts, curiously so in a spirit such as Eminescu's, that is so very attracted to speculative matters. However, once we hold everything up to the poet's polemical intent, his parody of meditation and mockery of cosmogonic representations reveal their true significance.\"\n\nAs a lamentation of the poet's marginality in modern society, the poetry fragment is, according to writer and academic Mihai Zamfir, merely a \"Romantic cliché\". In his depiction of Dionis' lodging, particularly so for \"Cugetările\", Eminescu may have been inspired by prints made after Carl Spitzweg's canvass, \"The Poor Painter\". Historian of ideas Ana-Stanca Tăbărași suggests that Spitzweg's declining Biedermeier atmosphere was localized by Eminescu, treated with ironic detachment, and completed by intertextual allusions to another German motif: \"Komm, süßer Tod\", for \"Cugetările\"s conclusive \"come, oh, sleep or come, oh death\". Scholar Virgil Nemoianu also sees the story as quintessentially \"Biedermeier\", wrapped up in \"tamed\" or \"high\" Romanticism.\n\nVarious commentators have revised the casual readings of the story as a late-Romantic joke, while also rejecting its interpretation in purely philosophical terms. According to scholar Ilina Gregori, the realistic and dream-like levels of \"Poor Dionis\" should never be separated. According to Gregori, the work as a whole is an \" manifesto\", an attack on the very conventions of literary realism. Similarly, writer Eugen Cadaru proposes that \"Poor Dionis\" is a Romanian contribution to magic realism.\n\n\"Poor Dionis\" is central to another debate, which focuses on Eminescu's status as a late Romantic, versus his possibly role as a forerunner of Symbolism. Eminescu's story was lauded by poet and critic Benjamin Fondane, a prominent figure in Romania's own Symbolist circle (ca. 1915). Fondane regarded \"Poor Dionis\" as an actual Symbolist masterpiece, his terminology also listing Novalis among the Symbolists. The same notion was entertained by N. Davidescu, the Symbolist propagandist, who in 1939 described Eminescu as Romania's first Symbolist. Davidescu's claim was rejected by Lovinescu, who insisted that Eminescu and \"Poor Dionis\" only appeared Symbolist because of a substantial debt to Kantianism. The Symbolist connection was revisited in 2008 by researcher Rodica Marian, who sees \"Poor Dionis\" as compatible with \"Bruges-la-Morte\", by Georges Rodenbach. She identifies both works as prose poems.\n\nIn various critical interpretations of the novella, special note is made about the possibility that Dionis is the writer's \"alter ego\". The story never reveals whether Dionis or Dan is the actual protagonist—according to Pârvulescu, the solution is \"so very simple that everyone misses it by a long shot: the 'real' hero of these episodes is the poet, no matter what pseudonym he uses, and his dream [...] is the poem\". Early on, Eminescu admirers were especially prone to arriving at this conclusion. Eminescian poet Alexandru Vlahuță notes that he imagined Eminescu to be a sort of sleepwalking Dionis, and that, to his surprise, his idol was rather \"a stout and round-faced, aging, man, short-haired and dressed like any other\".\n\nAmong the early reviewers, G. D. Pencioiu took a radical socially deterministic stand, proposing that \"Poor Dionis\" and its Schopenhauerian content were the product of frustration with, and withdrawal from, \"bourgeois society\". To some degree, the notion resurfaces in other biographically-inclined scholars. Iorga believed that the work was not only generically autobiographical, but also an actual record of Eminescu's various cultural immersions, including his destitute career as a prompter in Bucharest and Giurgiu, and his enduring affection for Iași. Resisting the posthumous glorification of Eminescu, Lovinescu also suggests that, like his protagonist, Eminescu lived his final decades in abject squalor. More generally, Sanielevici described \"Poor Dionis\" as a record of youth, \"with its illusions, its sweet sorrow, its mirage of love eternal and fairy-tale life\"; \"readers will feel [...] like they co-wrote [it]\". Knowing that Eminescu died as a mental ward patient, some have argued that the travel episodes are records of a developing schizophrenia.\n\nMuch discussion surrounds the topography of Eminescu's apocalyptic landscape. G. Călinescu makes a special mention of the fact that, although he follows the Romantic cult of ruins and decrepitude, Eminescu does not use its conventions to deplore decadence: \"Quite the contrary, Eminescu rejoices.\" The episode where Dionis-Dan reshapes his universe also strikes a personal note: Dumitrescu-Bușulenga sees here a \"last echo\" of Eminescu's youthful belief in his own creative powers, crowning his idealization of the Romantic artist as a Luciferic monster. The same characteristic is noted by Ioana Em. Popescu, according to whom Dionis is the expression of immeasurable ambition, a \"Catilinary\" figure. As read by Pompiliu Constantinescu, Eminescu is primarily dominated by his \"Eros\", and in \"Poor Dionis\" he depicts himself as the erotic \"daimon\". The story's tragic note, he concludes, is in the \"daimon\"s subordination to the demiurge: unrequited love, followed by withdrawal into creativity. In his own essay on Eminescu's sexuality, I. P. Culianu postulates that \"\"Poor Dionis\" overflows with self-confessions, aspirations and romanesque ideals\": Dionis' unrequited love is the author's own \"voyeur\" self, idealizing his transformation into a \"desirable suitor\".\n\nTo some degree, this transfiguration also appears in Eminescu's treatment of other settings and landscapes. The Bucharest of Eminescu's imagination is not just affected by magic, but also suffering from \"topographic incoherence\" (an expression used by Eminescu expert Ioana Both). Likewise, Ruben's presence in early medieval Moldavia, where he is employed by a not-yet-existing Socola Academy, is highlighted by Simion as \"an evident anachronism\". In his hostile account, George Panu highlights the issues posed by Eminescu's belief in pristine simplicity: \"Searching for that old Romanian type, Eminescu had taken his hero, \"Poor Dionis\", down to the age of Alexander the Good, and wishing to confront us with old homes, wide verandas and ancient customs, he resorted to inventing them.\"\n\nSuch uchronic indifference has political implications: at the core, \"Poor Dionis\" is one of several texts by Eminescu where medievalism takes the center stage, highlighting his conservative vision of history. Panu's view was embraced and nuanced by later exegetes. Historian Alex Drace-Francis notes that Eminescu's work follows the trend of Romanian nationalism, mystifying the historical past and \"inventing\" tradition: \"The novella [...] was just one of the forms in which Eminescu displayed his ability to weld the magical logic of the traditional fairy tale with a remarkably modern historical logic of national destiny [...]. Such fictions were a substantive advance in the imagining of continuity, placed on a new psychological plane.\" Author Mihai Cimpoi also notes that: \"In Eminescu's palingenetic vision [...] the Middle Ages are a golden age, the object of all idealized projections.\"\n\nA political focus is apparent in Eminescu's treatment of the Jewish character, who is a familiar outsider in both the medieval and modern settings. Cultural anthropologist Andrei Oișteanu proposes that, on its own, Ruben the Jew may embody a positive stereotype, that of the \"wise rabbi\", which has some deep roots in Romanian folklore. The oblique references to Ruben's Sephardi background and his refusal to convert may show that Eminescu regarded the 1492 Expulsion as a collective tragedy. The episode was cited by scholar Petru Zugun as evidence that Eminescu was not a xenophobe, as has been argued by other historians. Overall, however, Eminescu had an ambiguous attitude toward the Jews, veering between entirely positive characterizations and antisemitic outbursts. Ioana Both sees a connection between the apocalyptic nightmare of a city haunted by demons, on one hand, and, on the other, Eminescu's political articles, which proclaim that Romania was being invaded by foreigners.\n\nEven before being recovered by the Symbolists, \"Poor Dionis\" was emulated by Ioan Slavici. Later in the 1870s, Slavici intended to write a spin-off, one based on Platonism rather than German ideologies. In 1890, one year after its author had died, \"Poor Dionis\" was featured in an Eminescu anthology compiled by Vasile Morțun, and reappeared in the 1914 \"Complete Works\", put out by A. C. Cuza. It was only during that interval that the first critical commentary, penned by Nicolae Iorga, appeared in George Panu's \"Lupta\"; in 1906, Panu also contributed notes which restated his criticism of the work as \"insane\", but also included some words of praise. In addition to Fondane and Davidescu, other Romanian Symbolists were enthusiastic about Eminescu's creation. They include the poet Gheorghe Orleanu (1873–1908), who, together with Eugeniu Botez and Constantin Calmuski, rewrote the story into a five-act Symbolist play. It was performed only once, in June 1909, for the Eminescu festival in Galați, and is mainly noted for merging poems by Eminescu and Veronica Micle into the dramatic format. Similar adaptations were penned by the actor State Dragomir and by Dragomir's pupil, Nicolae Beligan. The story is also commonly believed to have inspired the \"Philosopher\" sculpture, completed by Ion Schmidt-Faur in the 1920s as part of the Eminescu monument in Iași; the work may also be a Schmidt-Faur self-portrait.\n\nOverall, \"Poor Dionis\" and all other prose works by Eminescu were only marginally relevant to students of Eminescu, well into the interwar period. By then, however, the story had drawn attention from the Carlo Tagliavini, who published commentary on it for an Italian reading public (1923). The spread of modernist literature, and its growth into Romanian \"Trăirism\" (a cultivation of the immediate experience), generalized interest in Eminescu's fantasy prose. Although the work had been censured by their mentor, Nae Ionescu, \"Trăirists\" revived the Dionisian misunderstood hero; early study cases include Constantin Fântâneru's \"Interior\" (1932). Originally impressed by \"Poor Dionis\", Ionescu's novelist disciple, Mircea Eliade, also introduced references to the story in his 1936 novel, \"Domnișoara Christina\". Upon rereading the story during World War II, Eliade declared himself: \"less enthused than previously. In places, Eminescu's language is viscous, artificial; cacophonies abound.\" During the same interval, the Romanian film industry, supervised by state-appointed managers Nichifor Crainic and Ion Filotti Cantacuzino, turned its attention to Eminescu's novella. Poet Dan Botta took it upon himself to write a \"Poor Dionis\" screenplay, which saw print in \"Familia\" and received good reviews. This project was ultimately cut short by the turn of tides on the Eastern Front.\n\nUnder the Romanian communist regime, \"Poor Dionis\" and \"Cugetările\" were standards of the state curriculum, with the accent falling on the plight of misunderstood geniuses living in squalor. As Mihai Zamfir notes, this approach tended to favor \"fragments of rough drafts\" over the published version. In 1969, actor Emil Botta (brother of the poet-screenwriter) recorded his rendition of \"Cugetările\", re-released in 2011. Before the fall of communism, \"Poor Dionis\" was also being recovered by Romania's late-modernist (\"Optzeciști\") authors, who revived fantasy prose, and then by the postmodernists. The 1996 installment of \"Blinding\", by Cărtărescu, makes cult or tongue-in-cheek references to Eminescu's story. Interest in Eminescu's prose was also kept alive among the Romanians of the Moldavian SSR, where, in 1979, Gheorghe Vrabie published his illustrations for the story.\n\nUnder post-communism, Eminescu's story remained outside the national curriculum, although \"Cugetările\" was included as optional reading material in some high-school textbooks. It was also the opening work in Șerban Foarță's anthology of \"feline poetry\", published 2008, while the whole story was again rearranged into a short play by Cătălina Buzoianu (before 2005). Likewise, Eminescu's discourse about relativity, like its possible kinship with the theory of relativity, have since continued to stimulate Romanian critics and scientists. Writing in 2006, mathematician and essayist Solomon Marcus suggested that \"such mentions have usually been compromised by exaggerations that would turn the poet into a precursor (if not indeed a coauthor) of the theory of relativity. Thankfully, more serious approaches have since followed\".\n\nIn 1904, \"Bukarester Tagblatt\" published a translation of \"Poor Dionis\" into German, penned by W. Majerczik and Henric Sanielevici. This was followed ten years later by M. Schroff's version. Even after discarding Symbolism for Jewish existentialism, Fondane was an avid reader of \"Poor Dionis\". By 1929, he had taken the initiative of translating the story into his adoptive French, without ever managing to finish that work. Although \"Cugetările\" was rendered into French by both S. Pavès (1945) and Veturia Drăgănescu-Vericeanu (1974), a full French version of \"Poor Dionis\" was only published in 1993, as part of the \"Actes Sud\" collection, with Michel Wattremez as author. Several English translations were done by Sylvia Pankhurst, with a definitive version only published in 1979 by the \"Romanian Review\". \"Poor Dionis\" was the first Eminescu work to appear in Serbian, in a version done by Lepoša Pavlič (1940); a Russian translation was published at Chișinău in 1980. The entire corpus of Eminescu's prose works was rendered into Chinese by Feng Zhichen, of the Beijing Foreign Studies University. Its first edition came out in 2003.\n"}

Sankara came to power in what was then the Republic of Upper Volta in a popularly-supported 1983 military coup, and ruled until his assassination in a coup led by Blaise Compaoré in 1987.\n\nThere is a strong political dissonance between the movements which ascribe to Sankara's political legacy and ideals, a fact which the Burkinabé opposition politician Bénéwendé Stanislas Sankara – no relation – described in 2001 as being \"due to a lack of definition of the concept.\" The Sankarists range from communists and more moderate socialists to democratic socialism and populists.\n\nDuring his time in power, Sankara – a well-known war veteran noted for his charisma – attempted to bring about what he called the \"Democratic and Popular Revolution\" (), a radical transformation of society. A number of organizations were formed to implement this revolution, among them the Committees for the Defense of the Revolution, the Popular Revolutionary Tribunals and the Pioneers of the Revolution. A vast number of reforms were enacted in the newly renamed Burkina Faso between 1983 and 1987, most of which were undone after the military coup which ousted and killed Sankara. Prior to his death, the Burkinabé government faced significant allegations of human rights abuses from Amnesty International and other international organizations, including extrajudicial executions, arbitrary detentions and torture of political opponents.\n\nEven after the death of Thomas Sankara his legacy lived on, much due to his charismatic personal image. Sometimes dubbed the \"Che Guevara of Africa\" due to his similarities in style to the Argentinian revolutionary and the inspiration he took from the Cuban Revolution, Sankara became known for his frugal living, motorcycle riding, guitar playing, and opposition to the cult of personality, all personal traits which set him aside from contemporary African statesmen. For example, when asked why he didn't want his portrait hung in public places, as was the norm for other leaders on the continent, he replied \"There are seven million Thomas Sankaras.\" Ideologically, Sankara was a pan-Africanist and anti-imperialist who sought to reclaim the African identity of his nation and opposed neocolonialism, and a communist who studied the works of Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin.\n\nOne of the first groups to connect ideologically with the label of \"Sankarism\" was the Sankarist Movement, formed in exile in Paris only weeks after Sankara's assassination on 15 October 1987. Since then, self-identified Sankarist political parties and other organizations have been a common feature within the Burkinabé opposition movement against the government of President Compaoré. Many Sankarist leaders have a past in either Sankara's government or in the organizations he created. For example, Ernest Nongma Ouédraogo – leader of the Sankarist Pan-African Convention – was Minister of Security under Sankara, and Sams’K Le Jah – leader of the Citizens' Broom () – received his political education as a teenager in the Pioneer movement.\n\nThe Sankarists have been prominent in both the 2011 Burkinabé protests and the 2014 Burkinabé uprising. The latter successfully overthrew President Blaise Compaoré in late October 2014, forcing the leader to resign and flee the country to the Ivory Coast and causing a military takeover. Thomas Sankara has been cited as a major inspiration for the protesters, some going as far as dubbing the uprising the \"Revolution 2.0\" in reference to Sankara's \"Democratic and Popular Revolution\" during the 1980s.\n\nHistorical and current Sankarist groups include:\n\n\nThe Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) is a Black nationalist, far-left political party in South Africa, founded in 2013 by Julius Malema, the controversial former President of the African National Congress Youth League. The party is currently the third-largest party in both houses of the South African parliament, receiving 1,169,259 votes and a 6.35% share of the vote in the 2014 general election. The EFF claims to take significant inspiration from Sankara in terms of both style and ideology. In a May 2014 column, the prominent EFF member Jackie Shandu declared his party a \"proudly Sankarist formation\". Expelled from that party, Andile Mngxitama founded Black First Land First in 2015, with black consciousness and Pan-Africanist policies and a Sankarist leadership ethos.\n\nDidier Awadi, a Senegalese hip hop musician and one of the most prominent rappers in Francophone West Africa, describes Thomas Sankara as his greatest inspiration politically. He has recorded several songs referring to Sankara, and visited the killed leader's family in Burkina Faso. In 2003 he formed \"Studio Sankara\", a music label and recording studio.\n\n"}
{"id": "40740793", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40740793", "title": "Scottish common sense realism", "text": "Scottish common sense realism\n\nScottish Common Sense Realism, also known as the Scottish School of Common Sense, is a realist school of philosophy that originated in the ideas of Scottish philosophers Thomas Reid, Adam Ferguson, James Beattie, and Dugald Stewart during the 18th-century Scottish Enlightenment. Reid emphasized man's innate ability to perceive common ideas and that this process is inherent in and interdependent with judgement. Common sense therefore, is the foundation of philosophical inquiry. Though best remembered for its opposition to the pervasive philosophy of David Hume, Scottish Common Sense philosophy is influential and evident in the works of Thomas Jefferson and late 18th-century American politics.\n\nThe Scottish School of Common Sense was an epistemological philosophy that flourished in Scotland in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Its roots can be found in responses to the writings of such philosophers as John Locke, George Berkeley and David Hume, and its most prominent members were Dugald Stewart, Thomas Reid and William Hamilton. Philosophically, Scottish Realism served as a rebuttal to scepticism while keeping with the influential teachings of Isaac Newton and Francis Bacon. While largely understated for many years, the influence it had on philosophers elsewhere in Europe, not to mention in the United States, is of a considerable magnitude.\n\nOne central concern of the school was to defend \"common sense\" against philosophical paradox and scepticism. It argued that common-sense beliefs govern the lives and thoughts even of those who avow non-commonsensical beliefs and that matters of common sense are inherent to the acquisition of knowledge. The qualities of its works were not generally consistent; Edward S. Reed writes, e.g., \"[Whereas] Thomas Reid wished to use common sense to develop philosophical wisdom, much of this school simply wanted to use common sense to attack any form of intellectual change.\"\n\nThe Scottish School of Common Sense was founded by Reid in opposition to Descartes's Theory of Ideas. But the epistemology of sense experience led John Locke and David Hume to a skeptical philosophy that realists found absurd and contrary to common experience. Thus Hume and his sceptical argument would serve as the primary foil to the development of Reid's philosophy. Under the tutelage of George Turnbull, Reid embraced the tenets of Providential Naturalism and its four interconnected tenets; using these as the basis for his refutation of the theory of ideas. Reid painstakingly developed his treatise \"An Inquiry into the Human Mind on the Principles of Common Sense\" over the course of 40 years, often seeking the input of his contemporary philosophers within the Scottish Enlightenment including Hume.\n\nReid articulated the basic principle of Common Sense Realism:\n\nScottish Common Sense Realism is rooted in Aristotelian thought and advocates an empirical and scientific philosophy wherein trust of our senses is implicit and necessary. The principles of common sense are fundamental to our accumulation of knowledge of both metaphysical and physical constructs. However, observation alone cannot account for all knowledge and truth can be garnered by reflection. In Reid's own words:\n\nThe school taught that every person had ordinary experiences that provided intuitively certain assurance of a) the existence of the self, b) the existence of real objects that could be seen and felt; and c) certain \"first principles\" upon which sound morality and religious beliefs could be established. These principles laid the foundation for Reid's influential theory of perception.\n\nIn practice, philosophers of the Scottish school offered scientific explanations to historical events and advocated an unprejudiced and inter-disciplinary approach to education, free from religious and patriotic biases.\n\nThomas Reid and Dugald Stewart offered related theories of perception rooted in Scottish Common Sense Realism. According to Nicholas Wolterstorff of Yale University, Reid's philosophy can be non-contentiously reduced to four basic precepts:\nDugald Stewart's theory of perception acknowledges a great influence from Reid whose philosophy he termed \"fundamental laws of belief.\". However, Stewart proffered a more moderate approach to realism and his theory of perception emphasized the utility of the senses.\n\nCommon Sense Realism not only dominated Scottish thought in the 19th century, it had a major influence as well in France, the United States, and other countries. Victor Cousin (1792–1867) was the most important proponent in France. Reidian thought was the \"orthodox philosophy of colleges and universities\" in the early 18th century and provided an intellectual bedrock for the Age of Enlightenment. \n\nCommon Sense Realism swept American intellectual circles in the 18th century. Reid's philosophy was pervasive during the American Revolution and served as a stabilizing philosophical influence. Hailed by some as the \"father of modern psychiatry,\" Benjamin Rush's tutelage at the University of Edinburgh imbued him with strong realist tendencies which influenced much of his scientific and political work including his moral opposition to slavery. Evidence of the influence of Scottish Common Sense realism can readily be found in the philosophy of both Thomas Jefferson and John Adams. Adams compared the contributions of Dugald Stewart favorably to works of Aristotle and René Descartes. Scotsman and signer of the Declaration of Independence, John Witherspoon presided over Princeton University; students under his tutelage included 12 state governors, 55 delegates to the Constitutional Convention and future president James Madison. His education at the University of Edinburgh made him a strong proponent of the Scottish Enlightenment and Realism. James McCosh (1811–94) continued the influence of Scottish Realism at Princeton when he became president of the university in 1868, reviving its influence as a major stronghold of the movement. Noah Porter (1811–92) taught Common Sense realism to generations of students at Yale.\n\nScottish Realism greatly influenced conservative religious thought and was strongest at Princeton Seminary until the Seminary moved in new directions after 1929. The Princeton theologians built their elaborate system on the basis of \"common-sense\" realism, biblicism and confessionalism. James McCosh was brought from Queen's College, Belfast, to Princeton College's Chair of Moral Philosophy and Presidency because of his book \"The Method of Divine Government,\" a Christian philosophy that was precursory to Charles Darwin's \"The Origin of Species\" (1859). The Princeton Theologians followed McCosh to adopt a stance of theistic evolution. They tried to persuade John Gresham Machen (1881–1937), a leader of the Fundamentalists in the 1920s, but he would not stand with McCosh, nor could he stand for the shift the school was making. Therefore, he and a number of other Princeton faculty members left and started Westminster Theological Seminary in Philadelphia. This, however, did not stop McCosh from moving forward. It was his goal to develop Princeton as a Christian university in North America, as well as a forefront intellectual seminary of the Presbyterian Church. The faculty of the College and Seminary included both evolutionary thinkers and non-evolutionary thinkers. Much evangelical theology of the 21st century is based on Princeton theology and thus reflects Common Sense Realism. New Testament scholar Grant Osborne concludes that Scottish Common Sense Realism influenced biblical hermeneutics, that the surface level understanding of Scripture became popular, and individualistic interpretations abounded.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "54652304", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54652304", "title": "Slavic Native Faith's theology and cosmology", "text": "Slavic Native Faith's theology and cosmology\n\nSlavic Native Faith (Rodnovery) has a theology that is generally monistic, consisting in the vision of an absolute, supreme God (\"Rod\") who begets the universe and \"lives\" as the universe (pantheism and panentheism), present in all its phenomena. Polytheism, that is the worship of the gods or spirits, and ancestors, the facets of the supreme Rod generating all phenomena, is an integral part of Rodnovers' beliefs and practices.\n\nThe \"swastika\"-like \"kolovrat\" is the symbol of Rodnovery. According to the studies of Boris Rybakov, whirl and wheel symbols, which also include patterns like the \"six-petaled rose inside a circle\" (e.g. ) and the \"thunder mark\" (\"gromovoi znak\"), represent the supreme Rod and its various manifestations (whether Triglav, Svetovid, Perun or other gods).\n\nPrior to their Christianisation, the Slavic peoples were polytheists, worshipping multiple deities who were regarded as the emanations of a supreme God. According to Helmold's \"Chronica Slavorum\" (compiled 1168–1169), \"obeying the duties assigned to them, [the deities] have sprung from his [the supreme God's] blood and enjoy distinction in proportion to their nearness to the god of the gods\". Belief in these deities varied according to location and through time, and it was common for the Slavs to adopt deities from neighbouring cultures. Both in Russia and in Ukraine, modern Rodnovers are divided among those who are monotheists and those who are polytheists; in other words, some emphasise a unitary principle of divinity, while others put emphasis on the distinct gods and goddesses. Some Rodnovers even describe themselves as atheists, believing that gods are not real entities but rather ideal symbols.\n\nMonotheism and polytheism are not regarded as mutually exclusive. The shared underpinning is a pantheistic view that is holistic in its understanding of the universe. Similarly to the ancient Slavic religion, a common theological stance among Rodnovers is that of monism, by which the many different gods (polytheism) are seen as manifestations of the single, universal God—generally identified by the concept of \"Rod\", also known as \"Sud\" (\"Judge\") and \"Prabog\" (\"Pre-God\", \"First God\") among South Slavs.\n\nIn the Russian and Ukrainian centres of Rodnover theology, the concept of Rod has been emphasised as particularly important. The root *\"rod\" is attested in sources about pre-Christian religion referring to divinity and ancestrality. Mathieu-Colas defines Rod as the \"primordial God\", but the term also literally means the generative power of the family and \"kin\", \"birth\", \"origin\" and \"fate\" as well. Its negative form, \"urod\", means something wrenched, deformed, degenerated, monstrous. Sometimes, the meaning of the word is left deliberately obscure among Rodnovers, allowing for a variety of different interpretations. The Russian volkhvs Veleslav (Ilya Cherkasov) and Dobroslav (Aleksei Dobrovolsky) explain Rod as a life force that comes in nature and is \"all-pervasive\" or \"omnipresent\".\n\nCosmologically speaking, Rod is conceived as the spring of universal emanation, which articulates in a cosmic hierarchy of gods. When emphasising this monism, Rodnovers may define themselves as \"rodnianin\", \"believers in God\" (or \"in nativity\", \"in genuinity\"). Already the pioneering Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Shaian argued that God manifests as a variety of different deities.\n\nThis theological explanation is called \"manifestationism\" by some contemporary Rodnovers, and implies the idea of a spirit–matter continuum; the different gods, who proceed from the supreme God, generate differing categories of things not as their external creations (as objects), but embodying themselves as these entities. In their view, beings are the progeny of gods; even phenomena such as the thunder are conceived in this way as embodiments of these gods (in this case, Perun). In the wake of this theology, it is common among Slavic Native Faith practitioners to say that \"we are not God's slaves, but God's sons\". Some Rodnover groups espouse the idea that specific Slavic populations are the sons of peculiar facets of God; for instance, groups who rely upon the tenth-century manuscript \"The Lay of Igor's Host\" may affirm the idea that Russians are the grandchildren of Dazhbog (the \"Giving God\", \"Day God\").\n\nA Russian Rodnover leader, Nikolai Speransky (volkhv Velimir), emphasises a dualistic eternal struggle between forces of good and evil; the former represented by Belobog (\"White God\"), who created the human soul, and the latter by Chernobog (\"Black God\"), who created the human body. They are the twofold dynamism through which the supreme God expresses its spirits, taking part in the characteristics of both categories.\n\nPantheons of deities are not unified among practitioners of Slavic Native Faith. Different Rodnover groups often have a preference for a particular deity over others. The Union of Russian Rodnover Communities founded and led by Vadim Kazakov recognises a pantheon of over thirty deities emanated by the supreme Rod; these include attested deities from Slavic pre-Christian and folk traditions, Slavicised Hindu deities (such as \"Vyshen\", i.e. Vishnu, and \"Intra\", i.e. Indra), Iranian deities (such as Simargl and Khors), deities from the \"Book of Veles\" (such as Pchelich), and figures from Slavic folk tales such as the wizard Koschei. Rodnovers also believe and worship tutelary deities of specific elements, lands and environments, such as waters, forests and the household. Gods may be subject to functional changes among modern Rodnovers; for instance, the traditional god of livestock and poetry Veles is called upon as the god of literature and communication.\n\nIn Ukraine, there has been a debate as to whether the religion should be monotheistic or polytheistic. In keeping with the pre-Christian belief systems of the region, the groups who inherit Volodymyr Shaian's tradition, among others, espouse polytheism. Conversely, Lev Sylenko's Native Ukrainian National Faith (RUNVira for short, called \"Sylenkoism\" in some academic scholarship) regards itself as monotheistic and focuses its worship upon a single God whom they identify by the name Dazhbog. For members of this group, Dazhbog is regarded as the life-giving energy of the cosmos.\n\nSylenko characterised Dazhbog as \"light, endlessness, gravitation, eternity, movement, action, the energy of unconscious and conscious Being\". Based on this description, Ivakhiv argued that Sylenkoite theology might better be regarded as pantheistic or panentheistic rather than monotheistic. Sylenko acknowledged that the ancient Ukrainian-Rus were polytheists but believed that a monotheistic view reflected an evolution in human spiritual development and thus should be adopted. A similar view is adopted by Russian Ynglism. Lesiv recorded one RUNVira member who related that \"we cannot believe in various forest, field and water spirits today. Yes, our ancestors believed in these things but we should not any longer\". For RUNVira members, polytheism is regarded as backward. Some polytheist Rodnovers have regarded the approach adopted by Sylenko's followers as an inauthentic approach to the religion.\n\nAccording to the \"Book of Veles\", and to the doctrine accepted by many Rodnover organisations, the supreme Rod begets \"Prav\" (literally \"Right\" or \"Order\"; cf. Greek \"Orthotes\", Sanskrit \"Ṛta\") in primordial undeterminacy (chaos), giving rise to the circular pattern of Svarog (\"Heaven\", \"Sky\"; cf. Sanskrit \"Svarga\"), which constantly multiplies generating new worlds (world-eggs). Prav works by means of a dual dynamism, represented by Belobog (\"White God\") and Chernobog (\"Black God\"); they are two aspects of the same, appearing in reality as the forces of waxing and waning, giving rise to polarities like up and down, light and dark, male and female, singular and plural. Man and woman are further symbolised by father Svarog itself and mother Lada.\n\nThis supreme polarity is also represented by the relation between Rod and \"Rozanica\", literally the \"Generatrix\", the mother goddess who expresses herself as the three goddesses who interweave destiny (\"Rozanicy\", also known as \"Sudenicy\" among South Slavs, where Rod is also known as Sud, \"Judge\"). She is also known as \"Raziwia\", \"Rodiwa\" or simply \"Dewa\" (\"Goddess\"), regarded as the singular goddess of whom all lesser goddesses are manifestations. In kinships, while Rod represents the forefathers from the male side, Rozanica represents the ancestresses from the female side. Through the history of the Slavs, the latter gradually became more prominent than the former, because of the importance of the mother to the newborn child.\n\nIn duality, the supreme Rod's luminous aspect (Belobog) manifests ultimately as threefold, \"Triglav\" (\"Three-Headed One\"). The first of the three persons is the aforementioned Svarog (\"Heaven\"), and the other two are Svarog's further expressions as Perun (\"Thunder\") and Svetovid (the \"Worldseer\", itself four-faced). They correspond to the three dimensions of the cosmos, and to the three qualities of soul, flesh and power. Svarog represents Prav itself and soul, Perun represents \"Yav\" and flesh, and Svetovit represents \"Nav\" and spiritual power.\n\nAccording to Shnirelman, this triune vision and associations were codified by Yuri P. Mirolyubov and further elaborated by Valery Yemelyanov, both interpreters of the \"Book of Veles\". In olden times, already Ebbo documented that the Triglav was seen as embodying the connection and mediation between Heaven, Earth and the underworld. Adam of Bremen described the Triglav of Wolin as \"Neptunus triplicis naturae\" (that is to say \"Neptune of the three natures/generations\") attesting the colours that were associated to the three worlds, then further studied by Karel Jaromír Erben: white for Heaven, green for Earth and black for the underworld. Other names of the two manifestations of Svarog are Dazhbog (\"Giving God\", \"Day God\") and Svarozhich (the god of fire, literally meaning \"Son of Heaven\"). According to the studies of Jiří Dynda, the three faces of Triglav are rather Perun in the heavenly plane (instead of Svarog), Svetovid in the centre from which the horizontal four directions unfold, and Veles in the underworld. The netherworld, especially in its dark aspect, is indeed traditionally embodied by Veles, who in this function is the god of waters but also the one who guides athwart them in the function of psychopomp (cf. Sanskrit \"Varuna\").\n\nIn his study of Slavic cosmology, Dynda compares this \"axis mundi\" concept to similar ones found in other Indo-European cultures. He gives weight to the Triglav as a representation of what Georges Dumézil studied as the \"Indo-European trifunctional hypothesis\" (holy, martial and economic functions reflected by three human types and social classes). The Triglav also represents the interweaving of the three dimensions of time, metaphorically represented as a three-threaded rope. By Ebbo's words, the Triglav is \"summus deus\", the god representing the \"sum\" of the three dimensions of reality as a mountain or tree (themselves symbols of the \"axis mundi\"). In a more abstract theoretical formulation, Dynda says that the three (Triglav) completes the two by springing out as the middle term between the twosome (Belobog and Chernobog), and in turn the threesome implicates the four (Svetovid) as its own middle term of potentiality.\n\nSvetovid (\"Worldseer\", or more accurately \"Lord of Power\" or \"Lord of Holiness\", the root *\"svet\" defining the \"miraculous and beneficial power\", or holy power) is the four-faced god of war and light, and \"the most complete reflection of the Slavic cosmological conception\", the union of the four horizontal directions of space with the three vertical tiers of the cosmos (Heaven, Earth and the underworld), and with the three times. Helmold defined Svetovid as \"deus deorum\" (\"god of all gods\"); Dynda further defines Svetovid, by Jungian words, as a \"fourfold (\"quaternitas\") potentiality which comes true in threefoldness (\"triplicitas\")\". His four faces are the masculine Svarog (\"Heaven\", associated to the north direction and the colour white) and Perun (\"Thunder\", the west and red), and the feminine Mokosh (\"Wetness\", the east and green) and Lada (\"Beauty\", the south and black). The four directions and colours also represent the four Slavic lands of original sacred topography. They also represent the spinning of the four seasons.\n\nUltimately, Svetovid embodies in unity the supreme duality (Belobog and Chernobog) through which Rod manifests itself as Prav, and the axial interconnection of the three times with the four dimensions of present space. In other words, he represents Prav spiritualising Yav as Nav; or Svarog manifesting as spirit (Perun) in the material world governed by Veles. Dynda says that this conception reflects a common Indo-European spiritual vision of the cosmos, the same which was also elaborated in early and medieval Christianity as God who is at the same time creator (father), creature (son) and creating activity (spirit).\n\nAccording to the \"Book of Veles\", reality has three dimensions, namely the aforementioned \"Prav\", \"Yav\" and \"Nav\". Prav (\"Right\") itself is the level of the gods, who generate entities according to the supreme order of Rod; gods and the entities that they beget \"make up\" the great Rod. Yav (\"actuality\") is the level of matter and appearance, the here and now in which things appear in light, coalesce, but also dissolve in contingency; Nav (\"probability\") is the thin world of human ancestors, of spirit, consisting in the memory of the past and the projection of the future, that is to say the continuity of time. Prav, the universal cosmic order otherwise described as the \"Law of Heaven\", permeates and regulates the other two hypostases.\n\nIn her theological commentaries to the \"Book of Veles\", Ukrainian Rodnover leader Halyna Lozko betones the cosmological unity of the three planes of Heaven, Earth and humanity between them. She gives a definition of Rodnover theology and cosmology as \"genotheism\". God, hierarchically manifesting as different hypostases, a multiplicity of gods emerging from the all-pervading force Svarog, is genetically (\"rodovid\") linked to humanity. On the human plane God is incarnated by the kin or lineage, in the Earth. Ethics and morality ultimately stem from this cosmology, as harmony with nature is possible only in the relationship between an ethnic group and its land.\n\nThis is also the meaning of the worship of human ancestors, whether the Slavs' general forefather \"Or\" or \"Oryi\", or local forefathers such as \"Dingling\" worshipped by Vladivostok Rodnovers. Divine ancestors are the spirits who generate and hold together kins, they \"are\" the kins themselves. The Russian volkhv Dobroslav emphasises the importance of blood heritage, since, according to him, the violation of kinship purity brings about the loss of the relationship with the kin's divine ancestor. Ukrainian Rodnover and scholar Yuri Shylov has developed a theory of God as a spiral \"information field\" that expresses itself in self-conscious humanity, which comes to full manifestation in the Indo-European \"Saviour\" archetype.\n\n"}

The word has also been used by Antonin Artaud and Jacques Derrida commented its use. The subjectile is seen as a theory, not a fact; as a theory the subjectile is a tool that can be employed to analyse art objects to generate hypotheses concerning the relationship between subject and object in art.\n\nDerrida mentions that the word 'subjectile' appears in an essay on Pierre Bonnard, published in 1921. The subjectile refers to Bonnard’s use of cardboard for painting.\nThe Concise French dictionary translates 'subjectile' as 'Art: support (beneath paint, etc.)'. Without a support and ground the subject of a painting could not exist as it would fall away. Derrida argues that Artaud's subjectile is both ground and a support. It is stretched out, extended, beyond, through and behind the subject, it is not alien to the subject, yet ‘It has two situations’. Derrida holds that the subjectile functions as a hypothesis, and is a subjectile itself. ‘Subjectile, the word or the thing, can take the place of the subject or of the object – being neither one nor the other.’\n\nAntonin Artaud mentions the subjectile three times in his writing.Jacques Derrida, in his essay, \"To Unsense the Subjectile\" states ‘All three times, he is speaking of his own drawings, in 1932, 1946, and 1947’. The first time Artaud used the word was in a letter to André Rolland de Renéville, ‘Herewith a bad drawing in which what is called the subjectile betrayed me.’ In 1946, ‘This drawing is grave attempt to give life and existence to what until today had never been accepted in art, the botching of the subjectile, the piteous awkwardness of forms crumbling around an idea after having for so many eternities labored to join it. The page is soiled and spoiled, the paper crumpled, the people drawn with the consciousness of a child.’ Finally in February 1947, ‘The figures on the inert page said nothing under my hand. They offered themselves to me like millstones which would not inspire the drawing, and which I could cut. Scrap, file, sew, unsew, slash, and stitch without the subjectile ever complaining through father or through mother.’\n\nJacques Derrida's essay was first published in French titled \"Forcener le Subjectile\" in 1986 by Gallimard and an abridged English translation was published later (in 1998 by MIT press). For copyright reasons the images published in the Gallimard book were excluded from the later English translation, which contains instead photographs of Artaud taken by Georges Pastier in 1947, the year before Artaud died.\n\nThe subjectile is also commented on by Susan Sontag in her introduction to the edited translation of Artaud's works. and further in \"The Antonin Artaud Critical Reader\", which includes texts by Gilles Deleuze, Jacques Derrida, and Susan Sontag.\n\nListen to Antonin Artaud's radio play, \"To Have Done with the Judgement of God\" originally banned from broadcast in 1947.\n"}

Lawrence, Vincent van Gogh, Vaslav Nijinsky, George Bernard Shaw, William Blake, Friedrich Nietzsche, Fyodor Dostoyevsky and George Gurdjieff – Wilson explores the psyche of the Outsider, his effect on society, and society's effect on him.\n\nOn Christmas Day, 1954, alone in his room, Wilson sat down on his bed and began to write in his journal. He described his feelings as follows:\n\n\"The Outsider\" has been translated into over thirty languages (including Russian and Chinese) and never been out of print since publication day of Monday, 28 May 1956. Wilson wrote much of it in the Reading Room of the British Museum, and during this period was, for a time, living in a sleeping bag on Hampstead Heath. He continued to work on it at a furious pace and:\n\nGollancz was the head of publishers Victor Gollancz Ltd. Wilson was inspired to send the book to him after he found a copy of the publisher's own book \"A Year of Grace\" in a second-hand bookshop, which led him to believe that he had found a sympathetic publisher.\n\nThe book is structured in order to mirror the Outsider's experience: a sense of dislocation, or of being at odds with society. These are figures like Dostoyevsky's \"Underground-Man\" who seem to be lost to despair and non-transcendence with no way out.\n\nCharacters are then brought to the fore (including the title character from Hermann Hesse’s novel \"Steppenwolf\"). These are presented as examples of those who have insightful moments of lucidity in which they feel as though things are worthwhile/meaningful amidst their shared, usual, experience of nihilism and gloom. Sartre's \"Nausea\" is herein the key text – and the moment when the hero listens to a song in a cafe which momentarily lifts his spirits is the outlook on life to be normalized. \n\nWilson then engages in some detailed case studies of artists who failed in this task and tries to understand their weakness – which is either intellectual, of the body or of the emotions. The final chapter is Wilson's attempt at a \"great synthesis\" in which he justifies his belief that western philosophy is afflicted with a needless pessimistic fallacy.\n\nThe book has never been out of print since publication day in May 1956 and has been translated into at least 30 languages. Wilson helped to keep the work fresh by adding to it over the years: the 1967 paperback edition included a fifteen-page postscript; a ten-page essay 'The Outsider, twenty years on' was added to the 1978 edition; and in 2001 an index appeared for the first time alongside fifteen pages of postscripts originally written for a Chinese translation. It is still published with enthusiastic comments from the likes of Edith Sitwell and Cyril Connolly adorning its cover. This reception – of his first book at the age of 24 – was a high critical watermark for Wilson which he did not achieve again until the publication of \"The Occult\" in 1971 after which he enjoyed a long and fruitful career as a writer, philosopher, novelist, lecturer and broadcaster until his death in 2013.\n\nWilson followed \"The Outsider\" with six philosophical titles, which have become known as \"The Outsider Cycle\": \"Religion and the Rebel\" (1957), \"The Age of Defeat\" (\"The Stature of Man\" in the U.S., 1959), \"The Strength to Dream\" (1962), \"Origins of the Sexual Impulse\" (1963), \"Beyond the Outsider\" (1965) and the summary volume \"Introduction to the New Existentialism\" (1966). These were accompanied by a string of novels aimed at putting his philosophical ideas into action.\n\n\"Life\" magazine article Oct. 1, 1956\n"}

It discusses the initial decision-making, the process of selling the home, making the donation, downgrading to a smaller home, and what they learned in the process. The book details the Salwens' process in choosing a charity partner that would fit their values and effect a lasting change, and how their actions supporting and empowering a village in Ghana differed from their original idea of \"direct involvement\".\n\nThe book details why and how the Salwen family decided to sell their home in 2006. The home was a luxurious, 6,500-square-foot (600-square-meter), 1912 historic dream-house in Ansley Park, in midtown Atlanta, Georgia. It had Corinthian columns, five bedrooms, eight fireplaces, four ornate bathrooms, and a private elevator to Hannah's bedroom.\n\nThe family down-graded by replacing their home with a house that was half as expensive and less than half the size. The Salwens donated half the proceeds ($850,000) of the sale of their original home to The Hunger Project, a charity that works to lessen the hunger of 30,000 rural villagers in over 30 villages in Ghana, and helps them gain self-reliance.\n\nThe book describes the consensus-driven process that the parents and their two children used–over a period of time–to reach the decision to give away half the value of their home, and how they chose the charity from a number of non-profit organizations that they considered. It describes the challenges that the family faced while turning their family project into a reality, from economic ones to keeping the project a secret for a period of time so that they would not appear to be \"freaks\" to their friends.\n\nBefore they embarked on the project, the family members had little contact with one another, other than at meals. Hannah notes that \"The Power of Half\" \"is a relationships book, not really a giving book.\" She feels that the project helped her family grow closer to one another. \"The New York Times Book Review\" notes how the family \"became happier with less—and urges others to do likewise.\"\n\n\"We know that selling a house is goofy, and we recognize that most people can't do it\", admitted Kevin Salwen. \"We never encourage anybody to sell their house. That was just the thing that we had more than enough of. For others it may be time, or lattes, or iTunes downloads, or clothes in their closet. But everyone has more than enough of something.” He clarified:\n\nWe want our kids to be idealistic, but we also say, ‘Let’s not go too nuts here'. We’re not Mother Teresa. We’re not taking a vow of poverty, or giving away half of everything we own. We gave away half of one thing, which happened to be our house. Everybody can give away half of one thing, and put it to use. You’ll do a little bit of good for the world–and amazing things for your relationships.\n\nArchbishop Desmond Tutu praised Hannah and the Salwens for the project, remarking: “We often say that young people must not let themselves be infected by the cynicism of their elders. Hannah inoculated her family with the vision to dream a different world, and the courage to help create it.”\n\nSkeptics criticized them for \"self-promotion\" or for the amount of money they donated to charity. Some critics questioned their choice of charity—finding fault with the family for having donated their money to help needy people in Africa rather than in the United States. Not everyone understood the parents' egalitarian approach with their children, or the family's underlying philosophy. Commented one viewer of a television interview: “What kind of ass clown works his tail off, and busts his hump getting a decent education, only to listen to his kid suggest they give away the house?”\n\nAs Kevin Salwen noted: \"Most people are supportive. And a few are very uncomfortable.\" Asked facetiously whether Hannah, then still in high school, had \"concocted the world's greatest college-admissions ploy\", Kevin laughed and replied: \"No. Anyway, wouldn’t it be the world’s most expensive?\"\n\nReviewing it for \"The Washington Post\", Lisa Bonos wrote that the book, \"soaring in idealism, and yet grounded in realism, can show Americans of any means how best to give back.\" Nicholas D. Kristof, writing in \"The New York Times\", said he found the project \"crazy, impetuous, and utterly inspiring\", and that \"It’s a book that, frankly, I’d be nervous about leaving around where my own teenage kids might find it. An impressionable child reads this, and the next thing you know your whole family is out on the street.\" In the \"Los Angeles Times\", Susan Salter Reynolds wrote: \"You feel lighter reading this book, as if the heavy weight of house and car and appliances, the need to collect these things to feel safe as a family, are lifted and replaced by something that makes much more sense.\"\n\nLili Rosboch wrote for Bloomberg that it \"is an inspiring book about the decision to trade objects for togetherness and the chance to help others.\" Writing in \"Grist\", Jen Harper said that while she was somewhat skeptical before she started the book, the \"compelling and well-written narrative left me both impressed and inspired,\" and that she found the book \"endearing, funny, and uplifting\". Courtney E. Martin wrote in \"The Daily Beast\" that the book \"is highly accessible, sure to be devoured by Oprah devotees and disaffected finance guys hoping for a jolt of optimism.\" Bill Williams of \"The Boston Globe\" called it \"spirited\". Also writing for \"The Boston Globe\", Joseph P. Kahn said \"they’re my new role models\" – after admitting: \"I confess to being fixated on the opposite life formula. Call it the Power of Twice. As in, twice the leisure time, twice the income, twice the sleep. A man can dream, can’t he?\"\n\nThe project inspired others to commit to donating half their money, or half of a possession or income, to charity. In an interview in \"Natural Home Magazine\", Hannah noted that “A number of my friends at Atlanta Girls School have started their own Half projects, including a couple who are donating half of their babysitting money to environmental causes. That’s pretty flattering.\"\n\nRev. Tess Baumberger, the Minister at Unity Church of North Easton, Massachusetts, read the book and announced that in December 2010 the Church would give away half of its Sunday collections to a local charity. Baumberger remarked: \"What will we learn by practicing the power of half? What will this program teach our children and youth? I cannot wait to find out.\"\n\nMelinda Gates, wife of Microsoft founder Bill Gates, said she was inspired by the Salwens' philanthropic efforts. On December 9, 2010, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook's CEO), and investor Warren Buffett signed a promise they called the \"Gates-Buffet Giving Pledge\", in which they promised to donate to charity at least half of their wealth. After launching the Giving Pledge, the Gates invited the Salwens to Seattle for a photo shoot and conversation about The Power of Half.\n\n"}

{"id": "4358558", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4358558", "title": "The Secret of the Golden Flower", "text": "The Secret of the Golden Flower\n\nThe Secret of the Golden Flower () is a Chinese Taoist classic about neidan (inner alchemy) meditation.\n\nThe text of \"The Secret of the Golden Flower\" is attributed to Lü Dongbin of the late Tang dynasty. It is now known to have originated hundreds of years later, and was first published in the early Qing dynasty (清代前期), circa 1668–1692.\n\nDespite the varieties of impressions, interpretation and opinion expressed by translators, the meditation technique described by \"The Secret of the Golden Flower\" is a straightforward, silent method; the book's description of meditation has been characterized as \"Zen with details\". The meditation technique, set forth in poetic language, reduces to a formula of sitting, breathing, and contemplating.\n\nSitting primarily relates to a straight posture. Breathing is described in detail, primarily in terms of the esoteric physiology of the path of \"qi\" (also known as \"chi\" or \"ki\"), or breath energy. The energy path associated with breathing has been described as similar to an internal wheel vertically aligned with the spine. When breathing is steady, the wheel turns forward, with breath energy rising in back and descending in front. Bad breathing habits (or bad posture, or even bad thoughts) may cause the wheel not to turn, or move backward, inhibiting the circulation of essential breath energy. In contemplation, one watches thoughts as they arise and recede.\n\nThe meditation technique is supplemented by descriptions of affirmations of progress in the course of a daily practice, suggesting stages that could be reached and phenomenon that may be observed such as a feeling of lightness, like floating upward or slight levitation. Such benefits are ascribed to improved internal energy associated with breath energy circulation, improvements that alleviate previously existing impediments. Several drawings portray imagery relevant to the personal evolution of a meditation practitioner, images that may be somewhat confusing in terms of pure rational analysis. \"Only after one hundred days of consistent work, only then is the light genuine; only then can one begin to work with the spirit-fire.\"\n\nThe first such illustration represents the first one hundred days, or \"gathering the light\". The second one represents an emergence of meditative consciousness. The third stage represents a meditative awareness that exists even in mundane, daily life. Stage four represents a higher meditative perception, where all conditions are recognized. Then, varied conditions are portrayed as separately perceived, yet each separate perception is part of a whole of awareness.\n\n\"The Secret of the Golden Flower\" was first translated into German by sinologist Richard Wilhelm, a friend of Carl Jung, who had been introduced to the work by his Chinese teacher. The work was later translated from German to English by Cary F. Baynes. Jung provides comments for both of Wilhelm's major Chinese translations, including (in 1949) the nineteen-page (pp. xxi–xxxix) foreword to the Wilhelm/Baynes translation of the \"I Ching\", discussing the transpersonal aspect, and \"The commentary on The secret of the golden flower\" (1929).\n\nIn 1991, the text was translated afresh from the Chinese original by Thomas Cleary, a scholar of Eastern studies, who criticized the validity of Wilhelm's translation, characterizing it as incomplete and inaccurate:\n\nCleary gives some examples of the way that the text was commonly misinterpreted by Wilhelm and Jung, and describes such an instance in the very beginning of the text:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "29506779", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29506779", "title": "Tony Duvert", "text": "Tony Duvert\n\nTony Duvert (July 2, 1945 – August 2008) was a French writer and philosopher. In the 1970s he achieved some renown, winning the Prix Medicis in 1973 for his novel \"Paysage de Fantaisie\". Duvert's writings are notable both for their style and core themes: the celebration and defence of pedophilia, and criticism of modern child-rearing. In the 1970s attitudes to sexual liberation and child sexuality allowed Duvert to express himself publicly. However, when attitudes altered markedly in the 1980s, he was left feeling frustrated and oppressed.\n\nTony Duvert was born on 2 July 1945 in Villeneuve-le-Roi, Val-de-Marne. As a child he was shy and withdrawn, but was later to write that his sex life began when he was eight. Expelled from school at twelve for homosexuality, he was sent by his parents to a psychiatrist for treatment: the methods used he described as brutal and humiliating. He ran away from home and attempted suicide. In 1961, Duvert joined the high school Jean-Baptiste Corot in Savigny-sur-Orge, where he was a brilliant student, but with few friends. After high school he moved to Paris to begin an arts degree but preferred to devote himself to writing.\n\nDuvert made his literary debut in 1967 with \"Récidive\", published by Jerome Lindon of Editions de Minuit, who recognised his potential. However the novel's subject matter made the publisher nervous, and the book was printed in a limited edition of 712 copies available only through subscription and selected bookstores.\n\nHighly productive, Duvert soon produced three successive novels: \"Interdit de séjour\" and \"Portrait d'homme-couteau\" in 1969, and \"Le Voyageur\" in 1970, which were also sold by subscription. As well as their political aspect in promoting sexual relations between adults and children, and criticising of bourgeois society, these first four novels featured narrative and stylistic experimentation in the form of rambling style, typographic games, the absence or multiplicity of plots, jumbled chronology or facts, and lack of punctuation.\n\nThanks to Roland Barthes, Duvert achieved public recognition in 1973 with his novel \"Paysage de fantaisie\" (\"Strange Landscape\"), which won the Prix Medicis, and which was greeted warmly by critics. For Claude Mauriac the book revealed \"gifts and art that the word talent is not enough to express\"\n\nIn 1974, Duvert expounded his ideology at length in \"Le Bon Sexe Illustré\" (\"Good Sex Illustrated\") in which he sharply criticised sex education and the modern western family. Critics praised its humor and his ability to observe the false pretenses of bourgeois society.\n\nWith his literary prize money Duvert moved to Morocco, an experience which resulted in his next novel \"Journal D’un Innocent\", (\"Journal of an Innocent\") published in 1976. Disillusioned by its society, he moved to Thore la Rochette, before settling in Tours. His next novel \"Quand Mourut Jonathan\" (\"When Jonathan Died\"), published in 1978, was inspired by an earlier vacation with a neglected boy.\n\nDespite his productivity and critical success, Duvert had not achieved the public success he hoped for. To reach a wider audience and raise awareness of his ideas, he decided to write a novel that would incorporate his favorite themes while being less sexually explicit and written in a classic form. The result was \"L'Île Atlantique\" (1979, published in English as \"Atlantic Island\" in 2017), which received critical raves, and sold somewhat better than his previous works.\n\nApart from \"Good Sex Illustrated\", \"Diary of an Innocent\", and \"Atlantic Island\", all published by Semiotext(e)/MIT Press, English translations of Duvert's novels and other books are out of print and difficult to find.\n\nIn the 1980s, Duvert published \"L’enfant au masculin\" (1980), in which he further expounded his sexual philosophy; a novel \"Un Anneau d’Argent à l’Oreille\"; and a book of aphorisms \"Abécédaire Malveillant\": unlike his earlier writings, their critical reception was mostly indifferent or poor. By the late 1980s, Duvert was unable to pay the rent on his apartment. With the social mood towards pedophilia hardening in the wake of several abuse scandals, he felt the world had turned against him. He withdrew to his mother's house in Loir-et-Cher, and became a total recluse. Duvert published nothing further, and was largely forgotten. However, in 2005, his novel \"L'Île Atlantique\", which had first appeared in 1979, was adapted for television by Gerard Mordillat.\n\nTony Duvert's body was discovered at his home in August 2008, several weeks after his death, in a state of decomposition. His death briefly raised his media profile in France again; obituaries noting the quality of his writing, but also reflecting upon the change in official attitudes to child sexuality.\n\nGilles Sebhan has published two French-language biographical works on Duvert, \"Tony Duvert: L'Enfant Silencieux\" (Éditions Denoël 2010) and \"Retour à Duvert\" (le dilettante 2015). To date, neither book has been translated into English.\n\n\nEssays\n\nProse Poetry\n\nInterviews\n"}
