It has been argued that Rey influenced Philipp Frank and the formation of the Vienna Circle. Rey's history of science was wide, including sciences from physics to sociology, and deep, ranging from antiquity to the present; moreover, it included the study of culture's influence on the sciences of the time.\n\n"}

{"id": "192143", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=192143", "title": "Being and Nothingness", "text": "Being and Nothingness\n\nBeing and Nothingness: An Essay on Phenomenological Ontology (), sometimes published with the subtitle A Phenomenological Essay on Ontology, is a 1943 book by the philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, in which the author asserts the individual's existence as prior to the individual's essence (\"existence precedes essence\") and seeks to demonstrate that free will exists. While a prisoner of war in 1940 and 1941, Sartre read Martin Heidegger's \"Being and Time\" (1927). Heidegger's work, an ontological investigation through the lens and method of Husserlian phenomenology (Edmund Husserl was Heidegger's teacher), initiated Sartre's own philosophical enquiry.\n\nThough influenced by Heidegger, Sartre was profoundly sceptical of any measure by which humanity could achieve a kind of personal state of fulfilment comparable to the hypothetical Heideggerian re-encounter with Being. In Sartre's account, man is a creature haunted by a vision of \"completion\", what Sartre calls the \"ens causa sui\", literally \"a being that causes itself\", which many religions and philosophers identify as God. Born into the material reality of one's body, in a material universe, one finds oneself inserted into being. Consciousness has the ability to conceptualize possibilities, and to make them appear, or to annihilate them. Sartre offers a philosophical critique of Sigmund Freud's theories, based on the claim that consciousness is essentially self-conscious.\n\n\"Being and Nothingness\" is regarded as both the most important non-fiction expression of Sartre's existentialism and his most important philosophical work, original despite Sartre's debts to Heidegger. It is a noted contribution to the philosophy of sex, and Sartre has been credited with original insights into sexual desire. However, the book has been criticized for Sartre's treatment of Freud, and it had come to be seen as outdated by the time of Sartre's death in 1980. The book was popular among British students in the 1960s, but it has been suggested that it usually went unread by them. Sartre's reflections on slime (\"le visqueux\") have been described as celebrated.\n\nSartre's existentialism shares its philosophical starting point with René Descartes: The first thing we can be aware of is our existence, even when doubting everything else (Cogito ergo sum). In \"Nausea\", the main character's feeling of dizziness towards his own existence is induced by things, not thinking. This dizziness occurs \"in the face of one's freedom and responsibility for giving a meaning to reality\". As an important break with Descartes, Sartre rejects the \"primacy of knowledge\", as summed up in the phrase \"Existence precedes essence\", and offers a different conception of knowledge and consciousness.\n\nImportant ideas in \"Being and Nothingness\" build on Edmund Husserl's phenomenology. To both philosophers, consciousness is intentional, meaning that there is only consciousness \"of\" something. For Sartre, intentionality implies that there is no form of self that is hidden inside consciousness (such as Husserl's \"transcendental ego\"). An ego must be a structure outside consciousness, so that there can be consciousness \"of\" the ego.\n\nIn the introduction, Sartre sketches his own theory of consciousness, being, and phenomena through criticism of both earlier phenomenologists (most notably Husserl and Heidegger) as well as idealists, rationalists, and empiricists. According to him, one of the major achievements of modern philosophy is phenomenology because it disproved the kinds of dualism that set the existent up as having a \"hidden\" nature (such as Immanuel Kant's noumenon); Phenomenology has removed \"the illusion of worlds behind the scene\".\n\nBased on an examination of the nature of phenomena, he describes the nature of two types of being, \"being-in-itself\" (the being of things) and \"being-for-itself\". While being-in-itself is something that can only be approximated by human being, being-for-itself is the being of consciousness.\n\nFrom Sartre's phenomenological point of view, nothingness is an experienced reality and cannot be a merely subjective mistake. The absence of a friend and absence of money hint at a \"being\" of nothingness. It is part of reality. In the first chapter, Sartre develops a theory of nothingness which is central to the whole book, especially to his account for bad faith and freedom. For him, nothingness is not just a mental concept that sums up negative judgements such as \"Pierre is not here\" and \"I have no money\". Though \"it is evident that non-being always appears within the limits of a human expectation\", the concrete nothingness differs from mere abstract inexistence, such as the square circle. A concrete nothingness, e.g. not being able to see, is part of a totality: the life of the blind man in this world. This totality is modified by the nothingness which is part of it.\n\nIn the totality of consciousness and phenomenon (Heidegger's being-in-the-world), both can be considered separately, but exist only as a whole (intentionality of consciousness). The human attitude of inquiry, of asking questions, puts consciousness at distance from the world. Every question brings up the possibility of a negative answer, of non-being, e.g. \"Who is entering? No one.\" For Sartre, this is how \"nothingness\" can exist at all. Non-being can neither be part of the being-in-itself nor can it be as a complement of it. Being-for-itself is the origin of negation. The relation between being-for-itself and being-in-itself is one of questioning the latter. By bringing nothingness into the world, consciousness does not annihilate the being of things, but changes its relation to it.\n\nAs Bad faith, Sartre describes one's self-deception about the human reality. It can take two forms, the first one is making oneself falsely believe not to be what one actually is. The second one is conceiving oneself as an object (e.g. being identical to a job) and thereby denying freedom. \n\nThis essentially means that in being a waiter, grocer, etc., one must believe that their social role is equivalent to their human existence. Living a life defined by one's occupation, social, racial, or economic class, is the very essence of \"bad faith\", the condition in which people cannot transcend their situations in order to realize what they must be (human) and what they are not (waiter, grocer, etc.). It is also essential for an existent to understand that negation allows the self to enter what Sartre calls the \"great human stream\". The great human stream arises from a singular realization that nothingness is a state of mind in which we can become anything, in reference to our situation, that we desire.\n\nThe difference between existence and identity projection remains at the heart of human subjects who are swept up by their own condition, their \"bad faith\". An example of projection that Sartre uses is the café waiter who performs the duties, traditions, functions, and expectations of a café waiter:\n\nSartre also gives, as an example of bad faith, the attitude of the homosexual who denies that he is a homosexual, feeling that \"a homosexual is not a homosexual\" in the same sense that a table is a table or a red-haired man is red-haired. Sartre argues that such an attitude is partially correct since it is based in the \"irreducible character of human reality\", but that it would be fully correct only if the homosexual accepted that he is a homosexual in the sense that he has adopted a pattern of conduct defined as that of a homosexual, although not one \"to the extent that human reality can not be finally defined by patterns of conduct\".\n\nSartre consistently mentions that in order to get out of bad faith, one must realize that one's existence and one's formal projection of a self are distinctly separate and within the means of human control. This separation is a form of \"nothingness\". Nothingness, in terms of bad faith, is characterized by Sartre as the internal negation which separates pure existence and identity, and thus we are subject to playing our lives out in a similar manner. An example is \"something that is what it is\" (existence) and \"something that is what it is not\" (a waiter defined by his occupation).\n\nHowever, Sartre takes a stance against characterizing bad faith in terms of \"mere social positions\". Says Sartre, \"I am never any one of my attitudes, any one of my actions.\" The good speaker is the one who \"plays\" at speaking because he cannot \"be speaking\". This literally means that, like the café waiter, the speaker is not his condition or social categorization, but is a speaker consumed by bad faith. Thus, we must realize what we are (beings who exist) and what we are not (a social/historical preoccupation) in order to step out of bad faith. Yet, existents (human beings) must maintain a balance between existence, their roles, and nothingness to become authentic beings.\"\n\nAdditionally, an important tenet of bad faith is that we must enact a bit of \"good faith\" in order to take advantage of our role to reach an authentic existence. The authentic domain of bad faith is realizing that the role we are playing is the lie. To live and project into the future as a project of a self, while keeping out of bad faith and living by the will of the self is living life authentically.\n\nOne of the most important implications of bad faith is the abolition of traditional ethics. Being a \"moral person\" requires one to deny authentic impulses (everything that makes us human) and allow the will of another person to change one's actions. Being \"a moral person\" is one of the most severe forms of bad faith. Sartre essentially characterizes this as \"the faith of bad faith\" which is and should not be, in Sartre's opinion, at the heart of one's existence. Sartre has a very low opinion of conventional ethics, condemning it as a tool of the bourgeoisie to control the masses.\n\nBad faith also results when individuals begin to view their life as made up of distinct past events. By viewing one's ego as it once was rather than as it currently is, one ends up negating the current self and replacing it with a past self that no longer exists.\n\nThe mere possible presence of another person causes one to look at oneself as an object and see one's world as it appears to the other. This is not done from a specific location outside oneself, but is non-positional. This is a recognition of the subjectivity in others.\n\nThis transformation is most clear when one sees a mannequin that one confuses for a real person for a moment.\n\nSartre states that many relationships are created by people's attraction not to another person, but rather how that person makes them feel about themselves by how they look at them. This is a state of emotional alienation whereby a person avoids experiencing their subjectivity by identifying themselves with \"the look\" of the other. The consequence is conflict. In order to maintain the person's own being, the person must control the other, but must also control the freedom of the other \"as freedom\". These relationships are a profound manifestation of \"bad faith\" as the for-itself is replaced with the other's freedom. The purpose of either participant is not to exist, but to maintain the other participant's looking at them. This system is often mistakenly called \"love\", but it is, in fact, nothing more than emotional alienation and denial of freedom through conflict with the other. Sartre believes that it is often created as a means of making the unbearable anguish of a person's relationship to their \"facticity\" (all of the concrete details against the background of which human freedom exists and is limited, such as birthplace and time) bearable. At its extreme, the alienation can become so intense that due to the guilt of being so radically enslaved by \"the look\" and therefore radically missing their own freedoms, the participants can experience masochistic and sadistic attitudes. This happens when the participants cause pain to each other, in attempting to prove their control over the other's look, which they cannot escape because they believe themselves to be so enslaved to the look that experiencing their own subjectivity would be equally unbearable.\n\nSartre explains that \"the look\" is the basis for sexual desire, declaring that a biological motivation for sex does not exist. Instead, \"double reciprocal incarnation\" is a form of mutual awareness which Sartre takes to be at the heart of the sexual experience. This involves the mutual recognition of subjectivity of some sort, as Sartre describes: \"I make myself flesh in order to impel the Other to realize for herself and for me her own flesh. My caress causes my flesh to be born for me insofar as it is for the Other flesh causing her to be born as flesh.\"\n\nEven in sex (perhaps especially in sex), men and women are haunted by a state in which consciousness and bodily being would be in perfect harmony, with desire satisfied. Such a state, however, can never be. We try to bring the beloved's consciousness to the surface of their body by use of magical acts performed, gestures (kisses, desires, etc.), but at the moment of orgasm the illusion is ended and we return to ourselves, just as it is ended when the skier comes to the foot of the mountain or when the commodity that once we desired loses its glow upon our purchase of it. There will be, for Sartre, no such moment of completion because \"man is a useless passion\" to be the \"ens causa sui\", the God of the ontological proof.\n\nSartre contends that human existence is a conundrum whereby each of us exists, for as long as we live, within an overall condition of nothingness (\"no thing-ness\")—that ultimately allows for free consciousness. Yet simultaneously, within our \"being\" (in the physical world), we are constrained to make continuous, conscious choices.\n\nIt is this dichotomy that causes anguish, because choice (subjectivity) represents a limit on freedom within an otherwise unbridled range of thoughts. Subsequently, humans seek to flee our anguish through action-oriented constructs such as escapes, visualizations, or visions (such as dreams) designed to lead us toward some meaningful end, such as necessity, destiny, determinism (God), etc. Thus, in living our lives, we often become unconscious \"actors\"—Bourgeois, Feminist, Worker, Party Member, Frenchman, Canadian or American—each doing as we must to fulfill our chosen characters' destinies.\n\nHowever, Sartre contends our conscious choices (leading to often unconscious actions) run counter to our intellectual freedom. Yet we are bound to the conditioned and physical world—in which some form of action is always required. This leads to \"failed dreams of completion\", as Sartre described them, because inevitably we are unable to bridge the void between the purity and spontaneity of thought and all-too constraining action; between the \"being\" and the \"nothingness\" that inherently coincide in our \"self\".\n\nSartre's recipe for \"fulfillment\" is to escape all quests by \"completing\" them. This is accomplished by rigorously forcing order onto nothingness, employing the \"spirit (or consciousness of mind) of seriousness\" and describing the failure to do so in terms such as \"bad faith\" and \"false consciousness\". Though Sartre's conclusion seems to be that being diminishes before nothingness since consciousness is probably based more on spontaneity than on stable seriousness, he contends that any person of a serious nature is \"obliged\" to continuous struggle between:\n\na) the conscious desire for peaceful self-fulfillment through physical actions and social roles—as if living within a portrait that one actively paints of oneself.\n\nand\n\nb) the more pure and raging spontaneity of \"no thing\" consciousness, of being instantaneously free to overturn one's roles, pull up stakes, and strike out on new paths.\n\nIn Sartre's opinion, consciousness does not make sense by itself: it arises only as an awareness of objects. Consciousness is therefore always and essentially consciousness \"of something\", whether this \"something\" is a thing, a person, an imaginary object, etc. Phenomenologists often refer to this quality of consciousness as \"intentionality\". Sartre's contribution, then, is that in addition to always being consciousness \"of something\", consciousness is always consciousness \"of itself\". In other words, all consciousness is, by definition, \"self-consciousness\". By \"self-consciousness\", Sartre does not mean being aware of oneself thought of as an object (e.g., one's \"ego\"), but rather that, as a phenomenon in the world, consciousness both appears and appears \"to itself\" at the same time. By appearing to itself, Sartre argues that consciousness is fully transparent; unlike an ordinary \"object\" (a house, for instance, of which it is impossible to perceive all of the sides at the same time), consciousness \"sees\" all aspects of itself at once. This non-positional quality of consciousness is what makes it a unique type of being, a being that exists \"for itself\".\n\nSartre offers a critique of the psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud's theory of the unconscious, based on the claim that consciousness is essentially self-conscious. Sartre also argues that Freud's theory of repression is internally flawed. According to Sartre, in his clinical work, Freud encountered patients who seemed to embody a particular kind of paradox—they appeared to both \"know\" and \"not know\" the same thing. In response, Freud postulated the existence of the unconscious, which contains the \"truth\" of the traumas underlying the patients' behavior. This \"truth\" is actively repressed, which is made evident by the patients' resistance to its revelation during analysis. Yet what does the resisting if the patients are unaware of what they are repressing? Sartre finds the answer in what Freud calls the \"censor\". \"The only level on which we can locate the refusal of the subject\", Sartre writes, \"is that of the censor.\" Further:\n\nIn other words, Sartre views Freud's unconscious to be a scapegoat for the paradox of simultaneously knowing and not knowing the same information. Instead of alleviating the paradox, Freud simply moves it to the censor, establishing \"between the unconscious and consciousness an autonomous consciousness in bad faith\". Sartre thinks that the postulation of a censor within the psychic economy is therefore redundant: at the level of the censor, we still encounter the same problem of a consciousness that hides something from itself. For Sartre, what Freud identifies as repression is rather indicative of the larger structure of bad faith. Psychoanalysis thus does not yield any special insight, since hiding something from oneself occurs at the level of consciousness as a unified phenomenon, not as part of some intra-psychic mechanism.\n\nToward the end of \"Being and Nothingness\", Sartre attempts to adapt some of Freud's ideas, and thereby develop an \"existential psychoanalysis\" in which causal categories are replaced by teleological categories.\n\nExplanation of terms based on appendix to the English edition of \"Being and Nothingness\" by translator Hazel Barnes\n\n\n\"Being and Nothingness\" is considered Sartre's most important philosophical work, and the most important non-fiction expression of his existentialism. The Christian existentialist Gabriel Marcel wrote that it was of \"incontestable\" importance and ranked among the most important contributions made to general philosophy. While Marcel noted the influence of Martin Heidegger on \"the form at least\" of Sartre's work, he also observed that Sartre diverged from the views expressed by Heidegger in \"Being and Time\" (1927) in important ways, and that Sartre's contributions were original. Marcel considered Sartre's analysis of bad faith \"one of the most outstanding and solid\" parts of \"Being and Nothingness\", writing that it prevented Sartre's arguments from being purely abstract. Marcel saw one of the most important merits of the work to be to show \"that a form of metaphysics which denies or refuses grace inevitably ends by setting up in front of us the image of an atrophied and contradictory world where the better part of ourselves is finally unable to recognise itself.\" The philosopher Jean Wahl criticized Sartre's arguments about the topic of \"nothing\". The philosopher Frederick Copleston, writing in \"A History of Philosophy\" (1946–1986), described Sartre's view that all human actions are the result of free choice as \"highly implausible\", though he noted that Sartre had ways of defending his position. The British philosopher A.J. Ayer said that, apart from some psychological insights, the book was \"a pretentious metaphysical thesis\" and \"principally an exercise in misusing the verb 'to be'.\"\n\nThe philosopher William Barrett, writing in \"Irrational Man\" (1958), described \"Being and Nothingness\" as \"a great, uneven, brilliant and verbose tome\". He noted Sartre's debts to Heidegger, but nevertheless credited him with originality. He criticized Sartre for neglecting Heidegger's \"notion of the truth of Being\", his understanding of what it means for a subject or object to be. In his view, Sartre failed to \"deal with the problem of truth in a radical and existential way\", instead viewing truth in \"the ordinary intellectualistic sense that has been traditional with non-existential philosophers\" and thereby remaining a Cartesian rationalist. Susan Sontag, writing in an essay in \"The Supplement\" to the \"Columbia Spectator\" that was later published in \"Against Interpretation\" (1966), praised Sartre's discussions of the body and concrete relations with others, identifying them as part of a French tradition of serious thought about problems of fundamental importance. John B. Vickery wrote that Sartre's work resembles Sir James George Frazer's \"The Golden Bough\" (1890) in the way its author \"merges psychology and the concrete sense of fiction\", although he considered it less readable than Frazer's work. The philosopher Iris Murdoch, writing that continental philosophy shares the same general orientation as English analytic philosophy, compared Sartre's work to the British philosopher Gilbert Ryle's \"The Concept of Mind\" (1949).\n\nAccording to the philosopher Steven Crowell, \"Being and Nothingness\" had come to be seen as outdated by the time of Sartre's death in 1980, since, with its emphasis on consciousness, it seemed \"tied to the subjectivism and psychologism that structuralism and analytic philosophy had finally laid to rest.\" The philosopher David Pears, writing in the anthology \"Philosophical essays on Freud\" (1982), criticized Sartre's critique of Freud, describing it as complex but imprecisely formulated and open to potential objections. Murray S. Davis, writing in \"Smut: Erotic Reality/Obscene Ideology\" (1983), credited Sartre with being the first author to present a phenomenological analysis of sex. The philosopher Roger Scruton, writing in \"Sexual Desire\" (1986), credited Sartre with \"perhaps the most acute philosophical analysis\" of sexual desire, and endorsed Sartre's view that sexual desire cannot be considered equivalent to appetite, as this ignores \"the interpersonal component of human sexual responses.\" He described Sartre's reflections on \"le visqueux\" as \"celebrated\". He has also described Sartre's book as a great work, and one that offers a \"stunning apology for sado-masochism\". He recalled that in 1960 its English translation became the first book he bought, and that he and his friends at school \"all claimed intimate knowledge of this book that few of us had read and none of us had understood.\"\n\nThe physician Frank Gonzalez-Crussi, writing in \"On the Nature of Things Erotic\" (1988), credited Sartre with being \"the first to realize that by an error of perspective the average man deludes himself into thinking that sexual desire is the same as desire of coition\", endorsing Sartre's view that \"Desire in no way implies by itself the sexual act\". The critic Camille Paglia, writing in \"Sexual Personae\" (1990), equated Sartre's term for slime, \"le visqueux\", with \"Dionysus' swamp, the fleshy muck of the generative matrix.\" The philosopher Thomas Baldwin, writing in \"The Oxford Companion to Philosophy\" (1995), described \"Being and Nothingness\" as a work of pessimism. He wrote that Sartre's argument that Freud's theory of repression is internally flawed is based on a misunderstanding of Freud, and that Sartre's attempts to adapt Freud's ideas are of greater interest. The director Richard Eyre recalled that \"Being and Nothingness\" was popular among British students in the 1960s, but suggests that among them the work usually went unread.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "48849719", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48849719", "title": "Buddhist hermeneutics", "text": "Buddhist hermeneutics\n\nBuddhist hermeneutics refers to the interpretative frameworks historical Buddhists have used to interpret and understand Buddhist texts and to the interpretative instructions that Buddhists texts themselves impart upon the reader. Because of the broad variety of scriptures, Buddhist traditions and schools, there are also a wide variety of different hermeneutic approaches within Buddhism. \n\nBuddhist scriptural exegesis has always been driven by the soteriological needs of the tradition to find the true meaning (\"artha\") of Buddhist scriptures. Another important issue in Buddhist hermeneutics is the problem of which sutras are to be taken to be 'Buddhavacana', \"the word of the Buddha\" and also which sutras contain the correct teachings.\n\nThe Early Buddhist texts such as the Sutta Pitaka and the Agamas distinguish between Buddhist suttas that contain clear meaning (Pāli:Nītattha; Sanskrit: nītārtha) and those that require further interpretation (Pāli: neyyattha; Sanskrit: neyartha). This later developed into the two truths doctrine, which states there is a conventional truth and an ultimate truth. The Buddhist concept of Upaya (skillful means) is another common theme in Buddhist Hermeneutics, and holds that the Buddha sometimes taught things that were not literally true as a skillful teaching strategy, and also taught many different things to different people, depending on their ability to understand.\n\nThe issue of how to determine if a teaching is a genuine teaching of the Buddha is present in the earliest Buddhist scriptures. One such text is the Mahaparinibbana Sutta, which has a section called 'The Four Great References' (\"mahāpadesa\") that outlines a set of criteria for determining whether a teaching is from the Buddha. This sutta states that four references are acceptable:\n\n\nIn the cases where someone is not being directly taught by the Buddha however, the text goes on to say that the hearer should check these teachings by \"carefully studying the sentences word by word, one should trace them in the Discourses and verify them by the Discipline.\" If they are not traceable to the suttas, one should reject them.\n\nAn important distinction the Early Buddhist texts outline is the distinction between statements that are \"Neyyatha\" ('needing to be drawn out/explained') and \"Nītattha\" ('fully drawn out'). The Neyyatha sutta states:\n\n\"Monks, these two slander the Tathagata. Which two? He who explains a discourse whose meaning needs to be inferred as one whose meaning has already been fully drawn out. And he who explains a discourse whose meaning has already been fully drawn out as one whose meaning needs to be inferred. These are two who slander the Tathagata.\"\n\nThis notion was later elaborated in the Theravada Abhidhamma and Mahayana literature as conventional or relative truth (sammuti- or vohaara-sacca) and ultimate truth (paramattha-sacca), and became known as the two truths doctrine. \n\nAnother criteria the Buddha taught to differentiate Dhamma from what was not his teaching, was that of analyzing how a particular teaching affects one's thinking. The Gotami sutta states that anything that leads to dispassion, liberation, relinquishment, having few wishes, contentment, seclusion, arousing of energy and being easy to support are said to be the teacher's instruction, while anything that leads to the opposite of these qualities cannot be the true teaching of the Buddha. Hence in the Early Buddhist texts, the work of hermeneutics is deeply tied with the spiritual practice and a mindful awareness of the effect our practices have on our state of mind.\n\nIn the Theravada tradition, all of the Tipitaka is held to be \"the word of the Buddha\" (Buddhavacana). However, for something to be Buddhavacana according to Theravada does not necessarily mean that it was spoken by the historical Buddha. Texts and teachings not spoken by the Buddha directly but taught by his disciples, such as the Theragatha, are said to be 'well said' (\"subhasitam\") and an expression of the Dhamma and therefore to be Buddhavacana. \n\nThe interpretation of the Buddha's words is central to the Theravada tradition. Because of this, many Theravada doctrines were developed in the commentaries (Atthakatha) and sub-commentaries to the Tipitaka, which are central interpretative texts. By far the most important Theravada commentator was the fifth century scholar monk Buddhagosa who wrote commentaries on large portions of the Pali canon.\n\nTwo major Theravada hermeneutical texts are the Petakopadesa and the Nettipakarana (c. 1st century CE), both traditionally attributed to the exegete Mahākaccāna. Both texts use the gradual path to Nirvana as a hermeneutical tool for explaining the teachings of the Buddha in way that was relevant to both monastics and laypersons. These texts assume that the structure of the Dhamma is derived from the gradual path. They classify different types of persons (ordinary persons, initiates and the adepts) and personality types and different types of suttas that the Buddha addressed to each type of person (suttas on morality, on penetrating wisdom, on Bhavana). Each type of sutta is meant to lead each type of person further on the graduated path to Nirvana. \n\nThe Netti provides five guidelines (\"naya\") and sixteen modes (\"hara\") for clarifying the relationship between a text's linguistic convention (\"byanjana\") and its true meaning (\"atha\").\n\nAccording to Alexander Berzin, the Indian Buddhist philosopher Dharmakirti in \"A Commentary on [Dignaga's \"Compendium of] Validly Cognizing Minds\" proposed two decisive criteria for authenticity of a Buddhist text:\n\nBuddha taught an enormous variety of subjects, but only those themes that repeatedly appear throughout his teachings indicate what Buddha actually intended. These themes include taking safe direction (refuge), understanding the laws of behavioral cause and effect, developing higher ethical discipline, concentration, and discriminating awareness of how things actually exist, and generating love and compassion for all. A text is an authentic Buddhist teaching if it accords with these major themes. The second criterion for authenticity is that correct implementation of its instructions by qualified practitioners must bring about the same results as Buddha repeatedly indicated elsewhere. Proper practice must lead to achieving the ultimate goals of liberation or enlightenment and the provisional goals of spiritual attainment along the way.\n\nMahayana Buddhism has an immense number of texts, many of which were written and codified hundreds of years after the Buddha's death. In spite of this historical fact, they are still considered Buddhavacana. The vast canon of Mahayana texts is organized into groupings of teachings or \"turnings of the wheel of Dharma.\" The Sandhinirmocana Sutra for example, sees itself as inaugurating the third turning (Yogacara), which is the highest and most definitive teaching. Likewise, the Lotus sutra presents itself as being the ultimate and final teaching of the Buddha. Because of these mutually contradictory texts, Buddhist scholars had to find a way to harmonize the many different sutras and teachings into a coherent canon and interpretative framework, sometimes by outlining a classification system for them (Chinese:\"p'an-chiao\"). For example, in China, the Huayan school placed the Avatamsaka Sutra as the highest sutra, while the Tiantai school promotes the Lotus sutra at the top of their sutra hierarchy. \n\nThe Mahayana schools saw the 'lower' (Sravakayana) teachings as skillful means (Upaya) of guiding the less capable towards the higher teachings of the Mahayana sutras - even while disagreeing on which sutra represented the definitive meaning of the Buddha's enlightened message. The Buddha was said to have adapted his message based on his audience, expounding different teachings to different people, all depending on how intelligent and spiritually advanced they were. The Mahayana schools' classification systems were meant to organize sutras based on this hierarchical typology of persons (Sravakas, Mahayanists, etc). Buddhist schools' hierarchical classification systems were often used as tools in their doctrinal debates. As Etienne Lamotte writes: “Each school tends to take literally the doctrinal texts which conform to its theses and to consider those which cause dilemmas as being of provisional meaning.” \n\nThese doctrinal texts are those each school identifies as answering the core question of Mahayana hermeneutics: \"What was the content of the Buddha's enlightenment?\" Because of this focus, understanding a text's authorial intent is crucial for the spiritual development of the Buddhist practitioner. Buddhist hermeneutics is therefore an attempt to extract the Buddha's instructions and wisdom for spiritual praxis from a particular text. Because the goal of Buddhism is to become enlightened, according to Lamotte, the main validation of one's hermeneutical method is one's experience in meditation, and ultimately the experience of nirvana.\n\nAn important Mahayana sutra, the \"Catuhpratisarana sutra\", sets forth a set of rules for Buddhist exegesis. This sutra outlines the \"four reliances\":\n\n\nAnother set of hermeneutical concepts used by Mahayana Buddhists are the four special intentions (abhipraya) and the four hidden intentions (abhisamdhi).\n\n"}

This work was originally published in 1995 with the title \"Christology: A Biblical, Historical, and Systematic Study of Jesus Christ\", but the author thoroughly revised the whole text in 2009 to take account of the numerous biblical, historical, and systematic studies of Jesus that appeared following its first edition.\n\nIn this revised and updated second edition of his account of systematic Christology, O'Collins critically examines the more authoritative biblical and historical scholarship before confronting some key questions about orthodox faith and free will as applicable to Jesus in his person, being, and activity. In seeking to clarify the essential truths about him, the book investigates who Jesus was/is and what he did/does.\n\nO'Collins attempts to answer some difficult questions: Was Jesus both human and divine? If so, how is that possible and not a blatant contradiction in terms? \"Surely - he writes - we cannot attribute to one and the same subject the attributes of being simultaneously finite (as a human being) and infinite (as Son of God)?\" The author proposes that one should envisage Jesus' revealing and redeeming 'work' as having an impact not only on all men and women of all times and places, but also on the whole created cosmos. Recognising the difficulty in describing or even minimally explaining Christ's salvific 'work', the book is built around the resurrection of the crucified Jesus, highlights love as the key to redemption, and proposes a synthesis of the divine presence through Jesus.\n\nThe second edition includes fresh material on current discussions in the study of Christology: the use of 'near-death' and bereavement experiences as analogies to the post-resurrection appearances of Christ; contemporary philosophical theology and the case for the theological coherence of the Incarnation; the universal redemptive activity of Christ; and the place and possibilities of 'presence' as an organising category in Christology.\n\nFurthermore, the author covers specific theological approaches including Martin Luther's theology of the cross and liberation theology.\n\nChapter 1 - Some Major Challenges\nChapter 2 - The Jewish Matrix\nChapter 3 - The Human History\nChapter 4 - The Resurrection\nGod's Activity\nChapter 5 - The Son of God\nChapter 6 - Lord, Saviour, God, and Spirit\nChapter 7 - To the First Council of Constantinople\nChapter 8 - Ephesus, Chalcedon, and Beyond\nChapter 9 - Medieval and Modern Christology\nChapter 10 - Divine and Human\nChapter 11 - Faith, Holiness, and Virginal Conception\nChapter 12 - Redeemer\nChapter 13 - Universal Redeemer\nChapter 14 - The Possibilities of Presence\n\"Bibliography - Index of Names - Biblical Index\"\n\n\n"}

The doctrine is explained in \"Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top Replacement Co.\" The \"Aro\" case states the rule in these terms:\nThe decisions of this Court require the conclusion that reconstruction of a patented entity, unpatented elements, is limited to such a true reconstruction of the entity as to \"in fact make a new article,\" after the entity, viewed as a whole, has become spent. In order to call the monopoly, conferred by the patent grant, into play for a second time, it must, indeed, be a second creation of the patented entity. …Mere replacement of individual unpatented parts, one at a time, whether of the same part repeatedly or different parts successively, is no more than the lawful right of the owner to repair his property.\nAn extension of the doctrine is a right to modify the product to enhance its functionality, such as to make it operate faster or with a different size of product. The Supreme Court said in \"Wilbur-Ellis Co. v. Kuther\" that such a right was \"kin to repair for it bore on the useful capacity of the old combination, on which the royalty had been paid.\"\n\nThe House of Lords declared a similar principle—the doctrine of non-derogation from grants—concerning car owners' repair and replacement of automobile parts, in \"British Leyland Motor Corp. v.

It is evident in many different religions, such as Zoroastrianism, Christianity, Islam, Bahá'í Faith, Sikhism, and many more; all of these religions carry the belief of having one sole higher power, who controls everything that occurs in the world.\n\nOriginally, ethical monotheism implied the adherence to the non-physical, non-corporeal, eternal, and in no way anthropomorphic \"God of Abraham, God of Isaac, and God of Jacob\" (\"Elohei Avraham, Elohei Yitzchak ve Elohei Ya`aqov\"). This original form of ethical monotheism is based on practice, tradition and—to some—the logical result of questions concerning the origin of the world, rather than arrived at as the conclusion of a philosophical argument. The worship of other gods that were not present at the revelation on Mount Sinai, in particular the God in Christianity, is referred to as \"avodah zarah\" in Judaism, and it is traditionally believed that there are neither other pagan gods nor other (incarnated) divine personages.\n\nThe God of ethical monotheism is worshiped in Islam and in Bahá'í Faith, but can also be the Zoroastrian higher divine uncreated spirit named Ahura Mazda, and in Sikhism the Supreme Being or the creator of all named Waheguru. In Christianity the original God of ethical monotheism is worshiped as part of the Trinity, or as part of non-trinitarian conceptions of God. Other gods are variously considered to be false or demonic, and it is believed that any other gods cannot be compared to the one true God.\n\n\n"}

The process of investigation has a spiral character, as tackling the issues draws the explorer inwards towards a deeper engagement with the multidimensional character of reality\"\n\nThe book is published by SPCK in the UK and by Yale University Press in the USA, in 2005. \n\nIn 1. Reality Polkinghorne explains \"how natural the task of exploring reality is for someone whose intellectual formation has been in the sciences\"(p xi) and asserts his belief in Critical realism against Postmodernism.\n\n2. The Causal Nexus of the World suggests that \"scientifically our knowledge is still pretty patchy, excellent within certain well-defined domains but often unable to make satisfactory connections between different domains. The problematic of the relationship of Quantum physics to Classical physics provides an instructive example\" and also that \"matters of causality ... are not finally settled by science alone. Ultimate conclusions have to rest on the foundation of a metaphysical decision.\"(p xii)\n\nIn 3. Human Nature he notes that Charles Kingsley and Frederick Temple welcomed Charles Darwin's insights, which also implied a level of continuity between humans and other animals. However he notes that humans abilities in language, science and rationality are very different from those of animals. He says \"the fact that we share 98.4% of our DNA with chimpanzees shows the fallacy of genetic reductionism, rather than proving that we are only apes who are slightly different. After all I share 99.9% of my DNA with J. S. Bach, but that fact carries no implication of a close correspondence between our musical abilities\"(p45). He suggests that \"while natural selection has been an important factor in the development of life on Earth, it is by no means obvious that it is the only type of process involved\" and that \"the attempt to force classical Darwinian thinking into the role of an explanatory principle of almost universal scope has proved singularly unconvincing as it seeks to inflate an assembly of half-truths into a theory of everything\". He believes that Evolutionary epistemology is also based on a half-truth. Being able to make sense of everyday experience is a vital asset, yet when Newton discovered universal gravity, something happened that went far beyond anything needed for survival and that rational feats like proving Fermat's Last Theorem go far beyond anything susceptible to Darwinian explanation.\n"}

Since this is almost universally fatal, it is considered an especially conspicuous and selfless act of individual sacrifice in wartime; in United States military history, more citations for the Medal of Honor have been awarded for falling on grenades to save comrades than any other single act.\n\nSuch an act can be survivable: In World War II, US Marine Jack Lucas, in the Battle of Iwo Jima, placed two grenades under his steel M1 Helmet and himself before they exploded. Lucas lived, but spent the rest of his life with over 200 pieces of shrapnel in his body. In 2008 near Sangin in Afghanistan British Royal Marine Matthew Croucher used his rucksack to pin the grenade to the floor, and that and his body armor absorbed the majority of the blast. On November 21, 2010 in Marjah, Helmand Province, Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, US Marine Lance Corporal Kyle Carpenter threw himself upon a grenade, thrown onto a rooftop, to save a fellow Marine, sustaining injuries to his face and right arm and losing his right eye; he survived these wounds. Despite these rare instances, however, the odds of survival are extremely slim.\n\n\"Falling on a grenade\" is also used colloquially in non-military contexts to indicate individual acceptance of a personally harmful or sacrificial task in an effort to protect a larger group; during a scandal, corporate leaders or politicians who attempt to draw negative attention away from their company or party by pleading guilt, publicly admitting culpability and drawing condemnation on themselves (at the cost of their freedom or career) are often said to have \"fallen on a grenade\". \n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "22237707", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22237707", "title": "Genetic monitoring", "text": "Genetic monitoring\n\nGenetic monitoring is the use of molecular markers to (i) identify individuals, species or populations, or (ii) to quantify changes in population genetic metrics (such as effective population size, genetic diversity and population size) over time. Genetic monitoring can thus be used to detect changes in species abundance and/or diversity, and has become an important tool in both conservation and livestock management. The types of molecular markers used to monitor populations are most commonly mitochondrial, microsatellites or single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), while earlier studies also used allozyme data. Species gene diversity is also recognized as an important biodiversity metric for implementation of the Convention on Biological Diversity.\n\nTypes of population changes that can be detected by genetic monitoring include population growth and decline, spread of pathogens, adaptation to environmental change, hybridization, introgression and habitat fragmentation events. Most of these changes are monitored using ‘neutral’ genetic markers (markers for which mutational changes do not change their adaptive fitness within a population). However markers showing adaptive responses to environmental change can be ‘non-neutral’ (e.g. mutational changes affect their relative fitness within a population). \n\nTwo broad categories of genetic monitoring have been defined: Category I encompasses the use of genetic markers as identifiers of individuals (Category Ia), populations and species (Category Ib) for traditional population monitoring. Category II represents the use of genetic markers to monitor changes of population genetic parameters, which include estimators of effective population size (Ne), genetic variation, population inter-mixing, structure and migration.\n\nAt the individual level, genetic identification can enable estimation of population abundance and population increase rates within the framework of mark-recapture models. The abundance of cryptic or elusive species that are difficult to monitor can be estimated by collecting non-invasive biological samples in the field (e.g. feathers, scat or fur) and using these to identify individuals through microsatellite or single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping. This census of individuals can then be used to estimate population abundance via mark-recapture analysis. For example, this technique has been used to monitor populations of grizzly bear, brush-tailed rock-wallaby, Bengal tiger and snow leopard. Population growth rates are a product of rates of population recruitment and survival, and can be estimated through open mark-recapture models. For example, DNA from feathers shed by the eastern imperial eagle shows lower cumulative survival over time than seen for other long-lived raptors.\n\nUse of molecular genetic techniques to identify species can be useful for a number of reasons. Species identification in the wild can be used to detect changes in population ranges or site occupancy, rates of hybridization and the emergence and spread of pathogens and invasive species. Changes in population ranges have been investigated for Iberian lynx and wolverine, while monitoring of westslope cutthroat trout shows widespread ongoing hybridization with introduced rainbow trout (see cutbow) and Canada lynx-bobcat hybrids have been detected at the southern periphery of the current population range for lynx. The emergence and spread of pathogens can be tracked using diagnostic molecular assays – for example, identifying the spread of West Nile virus among mosquitoes in the eastern US to identify likely geographical origins of infection and identifying gene loci associated with parasite susceptibility in bighorn sheep. Genetic monitoring of invasive species is of conservation and economic interest, as invasions often affect the ecology and range of native species and may also bring risks of hybridization (e.g. for copepods, ducks, barred owl and spotted owl, and Lessepsian rabbitfish).\n\nSpecies identification is also of considerable utility in monitoring fisheries and wildlife trade, where conventional visual identification of butchered or flensed products is difficult or impossible. Monitoring of trade and consumption of species of conservation interest can be carried out using molecular amplification and identification of meat or fish obtained from markets. For example, genetic market surveys have been used to identify protected species and populations of whale (e.g., North Pacific minke whale) and dolphin species appearing in the marketplace. Other surveys of market trade have focused on pinnipeds, sea horses and sharks. Such surveys are used to provide ongoing monitoring of the quantity and movement of fisheries and wildlife products through markets and for detecting poaching or other illegal, unreported or unregulated (IUU) exploitation (e.g. IUU fishing).\n\nAlthough initial applications focused on species identification and population assessments, market surveys also provide the opportunity for a range of molecular ecology investigations including capture-recapture, assignment tests and population modeling. These developments are potentially relevant to genetic monitoring Category II.\n\nMonitoring of population changes through genetic means can be done retrospectively, through analysis of 'historical' DNA recovered from museum-archived species and comparison with contemporary DNA of that species. It can also be used as a tool for evaluating ongoing changes in the status and persistence of current populations. Genetic measures of relative population change include changes in diversity (e.g. heterozygosity and allelic richness). Monitoring of relative population changes through these metrics has been performed retrospectively for Beringian bison, Galapagos tortoise, houting, Atlantic salmon, northern pike, New Zealand snapper, steelhead trout, greater prairie chicken, Mauritius kestrel and Hector's dolphin and is the subject of many ongoing studies, including Danish and Swedish brown trout populations. Measuring absolute population changes (e.g. effective population size (Ne)) can be carried out by measuring changes in population allele frequencies (‘Ftemporal’) or levels of linkage disequilibrium over time (‘LDNe’), while changing patterns of gene flow between populations can also be monitored by estimating differences in allele frequencies between populations over time. Subjects of such studies include grizzly bears, cod, red deer, Leopard frogs and Barrel Medic.\n\nGenetic monitoring has also been increasingly used in studies that monitor environmental changes through changes in the frequency of adaptively selected markers. For example, the genetically controlled photo-periodic response (hibernating time) of pitcher-plant mosquitos (\"Wyeomyia smithii\") has shifted in response to longer growing seasons for pitcher plants brought on by warmer weather. Experimental wheat populations grown in contrasting environments over a period of 12 generations found that changes in flowering time were closely correlated with regulatory changes in one gene, suggesting a pathway for genetic adaptation to changing climate in plants.\n\nGenetic monitoring is also useful in monitoring the ongoing health of small, relocated populations. Good examples of this are found for New Zealand birds, many species of which were greatly impacted by habitat destruction and the appearance of numerous mammalian predators in the last century and have recently become part of relocation programs that transfer a few ‘founder’ individuals to predator-free offshore “ecological” islands. E.g. black robin, and kakapo.\n\nIn February 2007 an international summit was held at the Institute of the Environment at UCLA, concerning ‘Evolutionary Change in Human Altered Environments: An International Summit to translate Science into Policy’. This led to a special issue of the journal of Molecular Ecology organized around our understanding of genetic effects in three main categories: (i) habitat disturbance and climate change (ii) exploitation and captive breeding (iii) invasive species and pathogens.\n\nIn 2007 a Working Group on Genetic Monitoring was launched with joint support from NCEAS and NESCent to further develop the techniques involved and provide general monitoring guidance for policy makers and managers.\n\nCurrently the topic is covered in several well known text books, including McComb et al. (2010) and Allendorf et al. (2013)\n\nMany natural resource agencies see genetic monitoring as a cost-effective and defensible way to monitor fish and wildlife populations. As such scientists in the U.S. Geological Survey, U.S. Forest Service, National Park Service, and National Marine Fisheries Service have been developing new methods and tools to use genetic monitoring, and applying such tools across broad geographic scales. Currently the USFWS hosts a website that informs managers as to the best way to use genetic tools for monitoring (see below).\n\n\n"}

In 1976, he was awarded a contract to teach Epistemology at the Faculty of Natural, mathematical and physical sciences of the University of Parma, and obtained a permanent position in the same university two years later. On 28 February 1987 he became a researcher at \"Sapienza\" University of Rome, where, starting from 19 October 1993, he became Associate Professor and, from 1 November 2001, Full Professor of Aesthetics.\nSince November 2012, he has been the Director of MLAC (Museo Laboratorio di Arte Contemporanea/Laboratory Museum of Contemporary Art), \"Sapienza\" University. He is a member of the Teaching Staff of the Ph.D. in Philosophy of the same university, where he also served, for six years, as President of the Master’s Degree of the former Faculty of Philosophy.\nHe has coordinated national research projects (Progetti PRIN) and has taken part in international research projects. Over the last decade, he has coordinated university researches (Ricerche di Ateneo) involving more than thirty scholars from different study areas and focussing on aesthetic-philosophical and literary-artistic topics.\n\nHe edited, with Claudio Zambianchi, the anthology \"Alle origini dell'opera d'arte contemporanea\" (Roma-Bari, Laterza, 2008; 4th ed. 2012)\n\nHe is a founding member of SIE (\"Società Italiana di Estetica/Italian Society of Aesthetics\").\n\nHe is the editor of the book series \"Figure dell'estetica\" of the publishing house Alboversorio (Milan).\n\nHe is a member of the scientific board of the following journals \n\nDi Giacomo is also a member of the scientific board of \"Aesthetica Preprint\", a book series of the \"Centro Internazionale Studi di Estetica\" (\"International Centre for the Study of Aesthetics\").\n\nDi Giacomo maintains that, in order to tackle the issue of the image today, it is necessary to refuse both an interpretation of the image as a mere mirror of things and its interpretation as an exclusively self-referential system of signs. Based on his reading of Wittgenstein, he draws the conclusion that logical representation entails something that manifests itself and, while doing so, remains ‘other’, distinct from the visibility of the representation itself. Thus, in presenting itself, the image manifests the other of the visible, of the representable: that other which reveals itself in the visible, by hiding from it. And this is precisely how the image becomes an icon of the invisible.\n\nHowever, starting from Adorno’s reflection, the image tends to lose its figurative character but, at the same time, it continues to exist; the image is, indeed, both a thing and a non-thing: a paradoxical “real unreality”. This ensues from the attempt to divide the double-edged nature of the image into its constituent elements: on the one hand, a readymade in which the representational dimension melts into a purely presentational dimension, and, on the other hand, a solely mental image endowed with a weak material support.\n\nToday, the images of the new media are images of images and, in this sense, they are not even proper images but simulations, “simulacra”. It is no coincidence that digital images, as reproductions, have a low value as images, because they tend to acquire the aspect of something, thus losing that connection between transparency and opacity which characterises authentic images. Hence, indeed, the question whether new media are able to create real images.\nMore particularly, it is in the kind of art that Adorno defines as “modern” that we find an overcoming of the epiphanic dimension that distinguishes the icon, where the visible is the place of manifestation of the invisible as Absolute. As we have become aware of the impossibility to exhaust the whole of reality and, at the same time, to manifest the Absolute, what emerges now is a conception of the image as something that can be interrogated as a testimony of what does not allow itself to be translated into an image: to testify is indeed to tell what cannot be told completely. In this sense, testimony coincides not with memory, as consistent with what happened, but with the immemorial, which refers to something we can neither remember nor forget completely, that is something that is neither totally speakable nor totally unspeakable.\n\nIn short, a witness only speaks starting from the impossibility to speak. That the image is equivalent to testimony means, then, that the attempt to say the unsayable is an infinite task, and this is why the question of the image forms an integral part of the ethical question. This entails that in the image there is no completeness and, consequently, neither redemption nor reconciliation with the real. From this point of view, to consider the image as testimony is tantamount to seeing it as the place of a perpetually unresolved tension between memory and oblivion, thus as the expression of the imperative of sense in a context, such as the contemporary one, in which both world and art seem to be increasingly abandoned to non-sense.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

His work in optics, and his polemics against the reigning Newtonian theory of optics, were poorly received by the natural history establishment of his time.\n\nBy the middle of the 1700s, Western philosophy had reached an ethical and epistemological cul-de-sac. The Enlightenment or Age of Reason was based on a static view of human nature, an increasingly mechanical view of the universe (based on:\n- Copernican astronomy, \n- Galilean mechanics and \n- Newtonian physics) and \n- a linear view of the progress of scientific knowledge (the mechano-material, reductionist approach). \n\nThe exclusively rationalist approach, was termed by Ernst Lehrs as the 'one-eyed, color blind' perspective of the world, \n\nAn exclusively rationalist approach to life raises fundamental issues about \"God, freedom and immortality\" (Kant) of growing concern to a culture undergoing significant economic, political and cultural transformation. \n\nThe rationalist scientific method, which had worked well with inert nature (Bacon's \"natura naturata\"), was less successful in seeking to understand vital nature (\"natura naturans\"). At the same time, the rational-empirical model based on the predominance of mentative thinking (German: \"sinnen\") via the intellect (German: \"Sinn\"), started by Descartes and advanced most notably in France, was leading to confusion and doubt rather than clarity. Especially in subjective topics, equally rational arguments could be made for widely divergent propositions or conceptions. \n\nThe more empirical approach favored in Britain (Hume) had led to viewing reality as sense-based, including the mind; how, what we perceive is only a mental representation of what is real, and what is real we can never really know. \n\nAs one observer summarizes, there were two 'games' being played in philosophy at the time – one rational and one empirical, both of which led to total skepticism and an epistemological crisis.\n\nImmanuel Kant in Prussia undertook a major rescue operation to preserve the validity of knowledge derived via reason (science), as well as of knowledge going beyond the rational mind, that is of human liberty and of life beyond simply an expression of 'the chance whirlings of unproductive particles' (Coleridge). Kant's writings had an immediate and major impact on Western philosophy and triggered a philosophical movement known as German idealism (Fichte, Hegel, Schelling), which sought to overcome and transcend the chasm Kant had formalized between the sense-based and the super-sensible worlds, in his attempt to 'save the appearances' (Owen Barfield), that is, to preserve the validity of scientific or rational knowledge as well as that of faith.\n\nKant's solution was an epistemological dualism: we cannot know the thing-in-itself (\"Das Ding an Sich\") beyond our mental representation of it. While there is a power (productive imagination – \"produktive Einbildungskraft\") that produces a unity (\"transcendental unity of apperception\"), we cannot know or experience it in itself; we can only see its manifestations and create representations about it in our mind. The realm beyond the senses also could not be known via reason, but only via faith. To seek to know the realm beyond the senses amounts to what Kant termed an 'adventure of reason'.\n\nGoethe undertook his 'adventure of reason', starting with the \"crisis\" in botany, the merely and purely mechanical classification-taxonomy of plant life. In so doing Goethe also \"wagered a sweeping theory about Nature itself.\"\n\nGoethe was concerned with the narrowing specialization in science and emphasis on accumulating data in a merely mechanical manner, devoid of human values and human development. Linnaean botanic taxonomic system represented this in his day, a \"Systema naturae.\" Goethe intuited the practice of rational science promoted a narrowing and contracting interplay between humanity and Nature. For Goethe any science based only on physical-material characteristics and then only selected external traits, led to epistemic impoverishment and a reduction of human knowledge.\n\nWhat was needed was increased ability to derive meaning from voluminous external data by looking at it from both external-sensory angles; and, from an internal angle where thinking, Feeling, Intuition, Imagination and Inspiration could all contribute to conclusions reached by the experimenter. \n\nLinnaean taxonomy was already coming under criticism from Comte de Buffon, who argued the mechanistic classification of the outer forms of nature (natura naturata) needed to be replaced by a study of the interrelation of natural forces and natural historical change.\n\nFor Goethe, the production of new knowledge is inseparable from a \"Geschichte des Denkens und Begreifens,\" a history of thinking and conceptualization. Knowledge is also about association, not only about separation, as Coleridge also was at pains to explain in his \"Essays on Method\" (see Romantic epistemology).\n\nWhile arranging material phenomena in logical linear sequence is a valid scientific method, it had to be carried out under a correct and humanistic organizing idea (Bacon's \"lumen siccum\"), itself grounded in Nature, or natural law (often boundaried by multiple, lawful pairs of polarity).\n\nGoethe proposed experimenters seek the natural, lawful organizing ideas and/or archetype behind specific natural phenomena. Phase One was to immerse one's self in a living interaction with the natural phenomena to be studied, with all available senses. Goethe valued \"the labor of experimentation\". \n\nThis contrasted greatly with a trend in rational Natural Science, to 'abandon' Nature herself, formulate an abstract hypothesis; then, experiment to test whether your hypothesis can be verified or not. Goethe considered this an 'artificial experience' which 'tears' individual manifestations out of the meaningful context of the whole (for example, Newton's color hypothesis). \n\nInstead, Goethe's experimenter must adopt a more living, more humane, approach aspiring to entering into the living essence of Nature, as perceived in the phenomenon studied. \n\nFor Goethe success meant penetrating to the crucial underlying, sensorily-invisible archetype-pattern (\"Ur-phänomen\"). The Experimenter aspires to allow the phenomena to reveal its inherent order and lawfulness. While often invisible, this lawfulness is clearly objective not subjective, not invented by the experimenter (see Goethe's description of a dandelion or Steiner's copied version). \n\nErnst Lehrs went further in emphasizing how all objective manifestation comes from movement, physical-material objects as motion come to rest (Man or Matter, 3rd ed preferred).\n\nGoethean Science stands apart from Cartesian-Newtonian Science; its alternative value system sets it apart. Regarding quantification, Goethean Science is nonetheless rigorous as to experimental method and the matter of qualities.\n\nGoethe's student and editor of his works, Rudolf Steiner, applied Goethe's methodology of a living approach to Nature to the performing and fine arts. This gives Anthroposophic visual and performing arts their air of going beyond the mere outer form of things (\"natura naturata\") to discern a more inner nature (\"natura naturans\"). Steiner hoped to relate the human sphere with all of Nature through the arts; including, the art of Goethean Science.\n\nFive arts was Goethe's method of transmuting his observation of human nature into sharable form. Drawing from his novel, \"Elective Affinities\" (\"Wahlverwandschaften\"), Goethe discerned a \"geheime Verwandschaft\" (hidden relationship) of parts that explains how one form can transform into another form while being part of an underlying archetypal form (\"Ur-phänomen\").\n\nIt is this organizing idea or form that guides the consideration of the parts; it is a \"Bild\" or virtual image that \"emerges and re-emerges from the interaction of experience and ideas\". This consideration is a special type of thinking (noetic ideation or \"denken\") carried out with a different organ of cognizance to that of the brain (mentation or \"sinnen\"), one that involves an act of creative imagination, what Goethe terms \"the living imaginal beholding of Nature\" (\"das lebendige Anschauen der Natur\"). Goethe's nature (\"natura naturans\", the activity of \"nature naturing\" – as distinguished from \"natura naturata\", \"nature natured\", the domain of naturally formed \"objects\") is one in constant flux and flow, but nonetheless governed by law, logic and intelligence above the mind. To approach vital nature requires a different cognitive capacity (\"denken\") and cognitive organ (\"Gemüt\") from that used to perceive inert nature (\"sinnen\" based on the Intellect or \"Sinn\").\n\nIn his 1792 essay \"The experiment as mediator between subject and object\", Goethe developed an original philosophy of science, which he used in his research. The essay underscores his experiential standpoint. \"The human being himself, to the extent he makes sound use of his senses, is the most exact physical apparatus that can exist.\"\n\nWhile the fixed Linnaean system, like classical physics, its distinctions broke down increasingly at the border, reflected in the increasing confusion as to how to classify the growing number of plant forms being brought forward. This led to greater division rather than greater unity. Goethe's discovery of an underlying order directly challenged the fixed, static view of nature of the Linnaean taxonomy (based on artificial types arrived at by choosing certain features and ignoring others), but also the tendency of natural science to study vital nature by means of the methodology used on inert nature (physics, chemistry).\n\nThe Cartesian-Newtonian method presupposes separation between observer and observed. Goethe considered this a barrier. As Wellmon observes, Goethe's concept of science is one in which \"not only the object of observation changes and moves but also the subject of observation.\" Thus, a true science of vital nature would be based on an approach that was itself vital, dynamic, labile. The key for this is a living, direct, interactive experience (\"Erlebnis\") involving the mind, but also higher faculties more participatory and Imaginative (\"Gemüt\"), not dissociative and separative (\"Sinn\").\n\nOnly since the 1970s have other mainstream scientists come to be interested in Goethe's more holistic-humanistic approach to experiments. \n\nIn his study on color (\"Farbenlehre\"), Goethe challenged the view observers can look devoid and naive of theoretical context; likewise, challenging the assumption of shared common neutral language in science research and innovation. Rather Goethe believed every act of looking at a thing turns into observation, every act of observation turns into mentation, every act of mentation turns into associations. Thus it is evident we theorize every time we look attentively out into the world.\" In support of Goethe, Feyerabend wrote: \"Newton... did not give the explanation [of light] but simply re-described what he saw...[and] introduced the machinery of the very same theory he wanted to prove.\"\n\nFor Goethe, the ultimate aim of science was two-fold, both increase to the database of human knowledge; second, as a method for the metamorphosis of the experimenter. In Goethean Science, experiment is the 'mediator between object [natural phenomena] and subject ]the experimenter].' All experiments then become two-fold, potentially revealing as much about a natural phenomena as they reveal the experimenter to him or herself.\n\nGoethe's methodology is mutual and intimate interaction of observer and observed; and, what transpires over time. Ideally as the experimenter's observed knowledge grows from his study of natural phenomena, so does his capacity for inner awareness, insight, Imagination, Intuition and Inspiration. \n\nWhere Cartesian-Newtonian science accepts only a single, practical syllogism about experimenters and research topics, Goethean Science demonstrates practicing science as an art, practice directed towards refining the experimenter's perceptions over time, heightening them towards Imagination, Inspiration and Intuition.\n\nGoethe's method of science as art, of experiment as mediator between experimenter and Nature, can be applied to studies of every kind. Where Cartesian-Newtonian science defines and values \"expansion of knowledge\" as a logical and linear march towards accumulating facts, Goethean Science defines and values \"expansion of knowledge\" as:\n1) Observing organic transformation in natural phenomena over time (historical progression); and\n2) Organic transformation of the inner life of the experimenter. \n\nGoethe developed two dynamic concepts – one of polarity (developed in his \"Chromatology\") and one of logical-linear sequence (\"Morphology\"). These are applicable across all domains.\n\nFor Goethe understanding vital nature (\"natura naturans\") is very much a function of taking impressions and activating thereby responses via the Gemüt (empathy, perhaps also compassion) so that one 'becomes what one perceives'. This approach offers a way out of the current nihilism and downward spiral of Cartesian-Newtonian science.\n\nThe Kantian view is the realm of quantity and thing is separate from quality and phenomenon. Therefore we can never be certain what we perceive is objectively real. \n\nGoethe's new way of thinking (\"denken\") is a parallel order of science [more a distinct, separate, more holistic paradigm], useful for getting past the heavy cognitive curtain erected by Kant, where only utilitarian ideas and science are valued. \n\nAs Amrine states, Goethe accepted the mathematical approach (\"mathesis\") was appropriate for inert nature. However to become truly human, we cannot hold mathesis at the center of our life--apart from and dominating over--rational Feeling. Anything less than truly human values at the center of our life are inappropriate and counter-productive.\n\nGoethe writes in \"Story of My Botanical Studies\" (1831): \nAndrew Dickson White also writes with respect to evolutionary thought, in \"A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom\" (1896):\n\nAbout the end of the eighteenth century fruitful suggestions and even clear presentations of this or that part of a large evolutionary doctrine came thick and fast, and from the most divergent quarters. Especially remarkable were those from Erasmus Darwin in England, Maupertuis in France, Oken in Switzerland, and , and, most brilliantly of all, from Goethe in Germany.\nArthur Schopenhauer expanded on Goethe's research in optics using a different methodology in his \"On Vision and Colors\".\n\nRudolf Steiner presents Goethe's approach to science as phenomenological in the Kürschner edition of Goethe's writings. Steiner elaborated on this in the books \"Goethean Science\" (1883) and\n\"Theory of Knowledge Implicit in Goethe's World-Conception\" (1886). in which he emphasizes the need of the perceiving organ of intuition in order to grasp Goethe's biological archetype (i.e. \"The Typus\").\n\nSteiner's branch of Goethean Science was extended by Oskar Schmiedel and Wilhelm Pelikan, who did research using Steiner's interpretations.\n\nLudwig Wittgenstein's discussions of Goethe's \"Theory of Colors\" were published as \"Bemerkungen über die Farben\" (\"Remarks on Color\").\n\nGoethe's vision of holistic science inspired biologist and paranormal researcher Rupert Sheldrake.He went to an Anglican boarding school and then took biology at Cambridge, studying \"life\" by killing animals and then grinding them up to extract their DNA. This was troubling. Rescue came when a friend turned him on to Goethe. This old German's 18th century vision of \"holistic science\" appealed to the young Brit very much. Sheldrake used Goethe to investigate how the lilies of the field actually become lilies of the field. Sheldrake is famous for the term \"morphogenetic field\" actually a quote from one of Steiner's students, Poppelbaum.\n\nAmerican philosopher Walter Kaufmann argued that Freud's psychoanalysis was a \"poetic science\" in Goethe's sense.\n\nIn 1998, David Seamon and Arthur Zajonc wrote \"Goethe's way of science: a phenomenology of nature\".\n\nAlso in 1998, Henri Bortoft wrote \"The Wholeness of Nature: Goethe's Science of Conscious Participation in Nature\" in which he discusses the relevance and importance of Goethe's approach to modern scientific thought.\n\nBiologist Brian Goodwin (1931-2009) in his book How the \"Leopard Changed Its Spots : The Evolution of Complexity\" claimed that organisms as dynamic systems are the primary agents of creative evolutionary adaptation, in the book Goodwin stated: \"The ideas I am developing in this book are very much in the Goethean spirit.\"\n\n\n"}

Shortly after the end of the Second World War, Nishijima received a law degree from Tokyo University and began a career in finance. It was not until 1973, when he was in his mid-fifties, that Nishijima was ordained as a Buddhist priest. His preceptor for this occasion was Rempo Niwa, a former head of the Soto Zen sect. Four years later, Niwa gave him shiho, formally accepting him as one of his successors. Nishijima continued his professional career until 1979.\n\nDuring the 1960s, Nishijima began giving regular public lectures on Buddhism and Zen meditation. From the 1980s, he lectured in English and had a number of foreign students, including Mike Luetchford, his first Western Dharma Heir and founder of Dogen Sangha UK, Jeffrey Bailey, co-author with Nishijima of 'To Meet the Real Dragon,' American author Brad Warner, and teacher Jundo Cohen. In 2007, Nishijima and a group of his students organized as the Dogen Sangha International. In April 2012, Warner dissolved the organization.\n\nNishijima was the author of several books in Japanese and English. He was also a notable translator of Buddhist texts: working with student and Dharma heir Mike Chodo Cross, Nishijima compiled one of three complete English versions of Dōgen's ninety-five-fascicle \"Kana Shobogenzo\"; he also translated Dogen's \"Shinji Shōbōgenzō\". He also published an English translation of Nagarjuna's \"Fundamental Verses of the Middle Way\" (\"Mūlamadhyamakakārikā\").\n\nNishijima had not been in good health for several years. It is reported by family that his final words, upon refusing further medical treatment, were, \"I decide my death time by myself.\" Nishijima was often heard to say in teaching that \"Life is just the fact in this moment; death is just the fact in this moment.\"\n\nWhile studying the \"Shōbōgenzō\", Nishijima developed a theory he called \"three philosophies and one reality,\" which presents his distinctive interpretation of the Four Noble Truths as well as explaining the structure of Dogen's writing. According to Nishijima, Dōgen carefully constructed the \"Shōbōgenzō\" according to a fourfold structure, in which he described each issue from four different perspectives. The first perspective is \"idealist,\" \"abstract,\" \"spiritual,\" and \"subjective\"; Nishijima says this is the correct interpretation of the first Noble Truth (in mainstream Buddhism, the first Noble Truth is \"dukkha\"). The second perspective is \"concrete,\" \"materialistic,\" \"scientific,\" and \"objective\" (in mainstream Buddhism, \"samudaya\"). The third perspective is described as an integration of the first two, producing a \"realistic\" synthesis (mainstream, \"nirodha\"). The fourth perspective is reality itself, which Nishijima argues cannot be contained in philosophy or stated in words, but which Dōgen attempts to suggest through poetry and symbolism. In mainstream Buddhism, the fourth Noble Truth is the Eightfold Path.\n\nNishijima stated that \"Buddhism is just Humanism\" and he explains Dogen's teaching on zazen in terms of balancing the autonomic nervous system.\n\n\n"}

He also wrote poetry in addition to his prose, and he is considered to be the first known poet of the Malay world.\n\nInformation on Hamzah's life comes largely from the \"takhallus bait\" (pen-name stanza) that ends his poetry (\"syair\"), as well as from the work of his disciple Hasan Fansuri and commentaries on Hamzah's poems. However, many of his biographical details are uncertain. His name indicates that he may be from Barus (also known as Fansur to the Arabs), or have spent a large part of his life there. A link to the Siamese Ayutthaya (\"Shahr-i-Naw\") has also been proposed, although it may be that he travelled to Ayutthaya rather than that being his birth place. He was known as a Sufi spiritual master and it is thought that he may have worked at the court of the Aceh Sultanate.\n\nHamzah travelled widely, and was known to have visited the Malay Peninsula, Mughal India, Mecca and Medina, and Baghdad. He was one of the first Southeast Asians to complete the hajj. The date of his death is generally assumed to be around 1590 or earlier, although a later date during the reign of Sultan Iskandar Muda had also been proposed. However, an inscription on a gravestone found in Mecca for a Shaykh Hamza b. Abd Allah al-Fansuri recorded a date of April 11, 1527. Such an early date, if confirmed, may suggest that Hamzah did not live or work in Aceh, rather he was in Barus before leaving for Mecca where he died.\n\nHamzah Fansuri's panentheism was derived from the writings of the medieval Islamic scholars. He was influenced by Ibn Arabi's doctrine of \"Waḥdat al-Wujūd\" popular in Persia and Mughal India during the 16th century. He perceived God as immanent within all things, including the individual, and sought to unite one's self with the indwelling spirit of God. He employed the doctrine of seven stages of emanation (\"martabat\") in which God manifests Himself in this world, ending in the Perfect Man, a doctrine widespread in Indonesia at the time. His teachings were promoted by Aceh theologian Shamsuddin al-Sumatrani. \n\nHowever, his views were later deemed heretical by Nuruddin ar-Raniri for not conforming to the Islamic belief that God remained unchanged by His creation. Nuruddin travelled to Aceh and under his influence, the Sultana Taj ul-Alam attempted to eradicate Hamzah's works and name, and his writings were burnt.\n\nThe poetry, \"syair\" or \"ruba'i\", of Hamzah Fansuri are usually not more than 13-15 stanzas, but some may be up to 21. 32 of his poems have survived, and Hamzah included in each poem his name and information about himself in the last stanza (\"takhallus bait\"). Scholars have commented on his technical skill and mastery in his rhymes, the effective blending Arabic words into Malay poetic structure. They also noted a fondness for pun in his works that displays his humour and poetical virtuosity. He also wrote prose, and his three surviving works in prose are:\nHe was the first to write about the Sufi doctrines in the Malay language, or indeed any other languages of the Malay archipelago.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "27376226", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27376226", "title": "History of meditation", "text": "History of meditation\n\nThe practice of meditation is of prehistoric origin, and is found throughout history, especially in religious contexts.\n\nSome of the earliest written records of meditation (Dhyana), come from the Hindu traditions of Vedantism around 1500 BCE. The Vedas discuss the meditative traditions of ancient India. Around the 6th to 5th centuries BCE, other forms of meditation developed in Taoist China and Buddhist India. Dhyana in early Buddhism also takes influence on Vedanta by ca. the 4th century BCE. \n\nThe exact origins of Buddhist meditation are subject to debate among scholars. Early written records of the multiple levels and states of meditation in Buddhism in India are found in the sutras of the Pāli Canon, which dates to 1st century BCE.\nThe Pali Canon records the basic fourfold formula of salvation via the observance of the rules of morality, contemplative concentration, knowledge and liberation, thus placing meditation as a step along the path of salvation. By the time Buddhism was spreading in China, the Vimalakirti Sutra which dates to 100CE included a number of passages on meditation and enlightened wisdom, clearly pointing to Zen.\n\nIn the west, by 20 BCE Philo of Alexandria had written on some form of \"spiritual exercises\" involving attention (prosoche) and concentration and by the 3rd century Plotinus had developed meditative techniques, which however did not attract a following among Christian meditators. Saint Augustine experimented with the methods of Plotinus and failed to achieve ecstasy.\n\nThe Silk Road transmission of Buddhism introduced meditation to other oriental countries. Bodhidharma is traditionally considered the transmitter of the concept of Zen to China. However, the first \"original school\" in East Asia was founded by his contemporary Zhiyi in the 6th century in central China. Zhiyi managed to systematically organize the various teachings that had been imported from India in a way that their relationship with each other made sense. Wonhyo and Uisang promoted Korean Buddhism in the 7th century.\n\nThere is evidence that Judaism has inherited meditative practices from its predecessor traditions in Israelite antiquity. For instance, in the Torah, the patriarch Isaac is described as going \"lasuach\" in the field - a term understood by most commentators as some type of meditative practice (Genesis 24:63). There are indications throughout the Tanakh (the Hebrew Bible) that Judaism always contained a central meditative tradition.\n\nWith the growth of Japanese Buddhism from the 8th century onwards, meditative practices were brought to and further developed in Japan. The Japanese monk Dosho learned of Zen during his visit to China in 653 and upon his return opened the first meditation hall in Japan, at Nara. Meditative practices continued to arrive in Japan from China, and were subjected to modification. When Dōgen returned to Japan from China around 1227, he wrote the instructions for Zazen, or sitting meditation, and conceived of a community of monks primarily focused on Zazen.\nEarly practices of Jewish meditation grew and changed by the Middle Ages. Jewish meditation practices that developed included meditative approaches to prayer, mizvot and study. Some forms of meditation involved Kabbalistic practices, and some involved approaches of Jewish philosophy.\n\nSufi view or Islamic mysticism involves meditative practices. Remembrance of God in Islam, which is known by the concept Dhikr is interpreted in different meditative techniques in Sufism or Islamic mysticism. This became one of the essential elements of Sufism as it was systematized in the 11th and 12th centuries. It is juxtaposed with \"fikr\" (thinking) which leads to knowledge. By the 12th century, the practice of Sufism included specific meditative techniques, and its followers practiced breathing controls and the repetition of holy words.\n\nEastern Christian meditation can involve the repetition of a phrase in a specific physical posture, and can be traced back to the Byzantine period. Between the 10th and 14th centuries, hesychasm was developed, particularly on Mount Athos in Greece, and continues to the present. It involves the repetition of the Jesus prayer. It is possible that there were interactions between Hesychasts and the Indians or the Sufis, but this can not be proven.\n\nWestern Christian meditation contrasts with most other approaches in that it does not involve the repetition of any phrase or action and requires no specific posture. Western Christian meditation progressed from the 6th century practice of Bible reading among Benedictine monks called Lectio Divina, i.e. divine reading. Its four formal steps as a \"ladder\" were defined by the monk Guigo II in the 12th century with the Latin terms \"lectio\", \"meditatio\", \"oratio\", and \"contemplatio\" (i.e. read, ponder, pray, contemplate). Western Christian meditation was further developed by saints such as Ignatius of Loyola and Teresa of Avila in the 16th century.\n\nBy the 18th century, the study of Buddhism in the West was a topic for intellectuals. The philosopher Schopenhauer discussed it, and Voltaire asked for toleration towards Buddhists. The first English translation of the \"Tibetan Book of the Dead\" was published in 1927.\n\nNew schools of yoga developed in Hindu revivalism from the 1890s.\nSome of these schools were introduced to the west, by Vivekananda and later gurus.\nOther schools were designed as secularized variants of yoga traditions for use by non-Hindus, e.g. the system of Transcendental Meditation popular in the 1960s, and numerous forms of Hatha Yoga derived from the Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga school, which became known simply as \"Yoga\" in western terminology.\n\nRather than focusing on spiritual growth, secular meditation emphasizes stress reduction, relaxation and self-improvement. Both spiritual and secular forms of meditation have been subjects of scientific analyses and research. However, after 60 years of scientific study, the exact mechanism at work in meditation remains unclear.\n\nThe 'Jubu' (Jewish Buddhist) group are a very articulate current influence on meditation thinking in the West.\n\nIn 1971, Claudio Naranjo noted that \"\"The word 'meditation' has been used to designate a variety of practices that differ enough from one another so that we may find trouble in defining what \"meditation\" is.\" There remains no definition of necessary and sufficient criteria for meditation that has achieved universal or widespread acceptance within the modern scientific community, as one study recently noted a \"persistent lack of consensus in the literature\" and a \"seeming intractability of defining meditation\"\". Since then attempts have been made to achieve definitions of meditation.\n\n"}

McTaggart\n\nJohn McTaggart Ellis McTaggart, FBA (; 3 September 1866 – 18 January 1925), was an idealist metaphysician. For most of his life McTaggart was a fellow and lecturer in philosophy at Trinity College, Cambridge. He was an exponent of the philosophy of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and among the most notable of the British idealists. McTaggart is known for \"The Unreality of Time\" (1908), in which he argues that time is unreal. The work has been widely discussed through the 20th Century and into the 21st.\n\nMcTaggart was born in 1866 in London to Francis and Ellen Ellis. At birth, he was named John McTaggart Ellis, after his maternal grand-uncle, John McTaggart. Early in his life, his family took the surname McTaggart as a condition of inheritance from that same uncle.\n\nMcTaggart attended Clifton College, Bristol, before going up to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1885. At Trinity he was taught for the Moral Sciences Tripos by Henry Sidgwick and James Ward, both distinguished philosophers. After obtaining First class honours (the only student of Moral Sciences to do so in 1888), he was, in 1891, elected to a prize fellowship at Trinity on the basis of a dissertation on Hegel's \"Logic\". McTaggart had in the meantime been President of the Union Society, a debating club, and a member of the secretive Cambridge Apostles society. In 1897 he was appointed to a college lectureship in Philosophy, a position he would hold until his retirement in 1923 (although he continued to lecture until his death). He received the honorary degree \"Doctor of Letters\" (D.Litt.) from the university in May 1902.\n\nMcTaggart, although radical in his youth, became increasingly conservative and was influential in the expulsion of Bertrand Russell from Trinity for pacifism during World War I. But McTaggart was a man of contradictions: despite his conservatism he was an advocate of women's suffrage, and though an atheist from his youth was a firm believer in human immortality and a defender of the Church of England. He was personally charming and had interests ranging beyond philosophy, known for his encyclopaedic knowledge of English novels and eighteenth-century memoirs.\n\nHis honours included an honorary LL.D. from the University of St. Andrews and Fellowship of the British Academy.\n\nHe died in London in 1925. In 1899 he had married Margaret Elizabeth Bird in New Zealand whom he met while visiting his mother (then living near New Plymouth, Taranaki) and was survived by her; the couple had no children.\n\nMcTaggart's earlier work was devoted to an exposition and critique of Hegel's metaphysical methods and conclusions and their application in other fields. His first published work \"Studies in Hegelian Dialectic\" (1896), an expanded version of his Trinity fellowship dissertation, focused on the dialectical method of Hegel's \"Logic\". His second work \"Studies in Hegelian Cosmology\" (1901) is directed more towards a critique of the applications of Hegelian ideas made, both by Hegel and earlier neo-Hegelians, to the fields of ethics, politics and religion. In this book a number of his distinctive doctrines already appear, for example, his belief in human immortality. His final book specifically on Hegel was \"A Commentary on Hegel's \"Logic\"\" (1910), in which he attempted to explain and, to an extent, defend the argument of the Logic.\n\nAlthough he defended the dialectical method broadly construed and shared a similar outlook to Hegel, McTaggart's Hegelianism was not uncritical and he disagreed significantly both with Hegel himself and with earlier neo-Hegelians. He believed that many specific features of Hegel's argument were gravely flawed and was similarly disparaging of Hegel's application of his abstract thought. However, he by no means reached the same conclusions as the previous generations of British Idealists and in his later work came to hold strikingly different and original views. Nonetheless, in spite of his break from earlier forms of Hegelianism, McTaggart inherited from his predecessors a pivotal belief in the ability of \"a priori\" thought to grasp the nature of the ultimate reality, which for him like earlier Hegelians was the absolute idea. Indeed, his later work and mature system can be seen as largely an attempt to give substance to his new conception of the absolute.\n\nMcTaggart is best known today for his attempt to prove that our concept of time involves a contradiction, and that therefore reality cannot be temporal. It follows that our perception of time is an illusion, and that time itself is merely ideal. His argument for this point is popularly known as McTaggart's Paradox. The argument first appeared in the form of a journal article called \"The Unreality of Time\" (1908), but reappeared later as Chapter 33, 'Time', in the posthumously published Second Volume of his masterpiece \"The Nature of Existence\", published in 1927. He introduced the notions of the \"A series\" and \"B series\", representing two different ways that events appear to have a position in time. The A series corresponds to our everyday notions of \"past\", \"present\", and \"future\". The A series is \"the series of positions running from the far past through the near past to the present, and then from the present to the near future and the far future\" (p. 458). This is contrasted with the B series, in which positions are ordered from earlier-than to later-than relations. Thus the A series represent the events in time in a moving relation (from future to present to past) to the temporally moving observer, whereas the B series orders the time events as in firm and fixed relations to other time events.\n\nMcTaggart argued that the A series was a necessary component of any full theory of time since change only occurs in the A series, but that it was also self-contradictory and that our perception of time was, therefore, ultimately an incoherent illusion.\n\nThe first, and longer, part of McTaggart's argument is his affirmative answer to the question \"whether it is essential to the reality of time that its events should form an A series as well as a B series\" (p. 458). Broadly, McTaggart argues that if events are not ordered by an A as well as a B series then there cannot be said to be change. At the centre of his argument is the example of the death of Queen Anne. This event is a death, it has certain causes and certain effects, it is later than the death of Queen Elizabeth etc., but none of these properties change over time. Only in one respect does the event change:\n\n\"It began by being a future event. It became every moment an event in the nearer future. At last it was a present event. Then it became past, and will always remain so, though every moment it becomes further and further past.\nThus we seem forced to the conclusion that all change is only a change in the characteristics imparted to events by their presence in the A series\" (p. 460).\n\nDespite its power and originality this half of McTaggart's argument has, historically, received less attention than the second half.\n\nMcTaggart's attempted proof of the incoherence of the A series (the argument of pages 468–9) appears in the original paper only as a single part of a broader argument for this conclusion. According to the argument, the contradiction in our perception of time is that all events exemplify all three of the properties of the A-series, viz. being past, present and future. As McTaggart himself notes, the obvious response is that while exemplifying all three properties at some time, no event exemplifies all three \"at once\", no event \"is\" past, present, and future. A single event \"is\" present, \"will have been\" future, \"will be\" past, and here there is, it seems, no contradiction. However, McTaggart argues that this response gives rise to a vicious circle and infinite regress. There is a vicious circle because the response requires us to invoke the A-series determinations of future, present, and past to explain how the events of the series do not exemplify those determinations simultaneously but successively. And there is a vicious regress because invoking tense to explain how different tenses are exemplified successively, gives rise to second order tenses that again are incompatible unless we again invoke tense to show how they are exemplified successively, \"etcetera ad infinitum\". It bears to mention that in the mature version of the argument McTaggart has given up the claim that there is a vicious circle, but only a vicious regress.\n\nOne can convey the basic idea of the vicious regress in the following way. In order to avoid the initial apparent contradiction that events have incompatible tenses, one has to construe \"a second A series, within which the first falls, in the same way in which events fall within the first\" (p. 469). But even if the idea of a second A series within which the first falls makes sense (and McTaggart doubts it does, p. 469), it will face the same contradiction. And so, we must construct a third A series within which the second falls. And this will require the construction of a fourth A series and so on \"ad infinitum\". At any given stage the contradiction will appear; however far we go in constructing A series, each A series will be, without reference to a further A series containing it, contradictory. One ought to conclude, McTaggart argues, that the A series is indeed contradictory and, therefore, does not exist.\n\nWhether McTaggart's argument for the incoherence of the A series works or not, is one of the most hotly debated issues in the philosophy of time (see the entry for \"The Unreality of Time\" for a more thorough discussion).\n\nIn his later work, particularly his two-volume \"The Nature of Existence\", McTaggart developed his own, highly original, metaphysical system. The most famous element is his defence of The Unreality of Time, but McTaggart's system was much broader. In \"The Nature of Existence\" McTaggart defended a similar Hegelian view of the universe to that of his earlier work on the basis not of Hegel's dialectics but rather in the mode of more modern metaphysics.\n\nMcTaggart concluded the world was composed of nothing but souls, each soul related to one or more of the others by love. He argued against belief in God since he denied the absolute any single personality (thereby justifying his atheism). His philosophy, however, was fundamentally optimistic. McTaggart believed each of the souls (which are identified with human beings) to be immortal and defended the idea of reincarnation. McTaggart held the view that all selves are unoriginated and indestructible. \"The Nature of Existence\" also seeks to synthesise McTaggart's denial of the existence of time, matter etc. with their apparent existence.\n\nDespite the mystical tone of its conclusions, the philosophical method of \"The Nature of Existence\" is far from mystical. McTaggart arrived at his conclusions by a careful analysis of the essential requirements of any successful metaphysical system (Volume I) followed by a purported proof that only his system satisfies these requirements (Volume II). The logical rigour of his system is in evidence, for example, in McTaggart's famous attempted proof of the unreality of time.\n\nMcTaggart was a friend and teacher of Bertrand Russell and G. E. Moore, and, according to Norbert Wiener, the three were known as \"The Mad Tea-Party of Trinity\" (with McTaggart as the Dormouse). Along with Russell and Moore, McTaggart was a member of the Cambridge Apostles through which he would have a personal influence on an entire generation of writers and politicians (his involvement with the Apostles presumably overlapped with that of, among others, the members of the Bloomsbury group) .\n\nIn particular, McTaggart was an early influence on Bertrand Russell. It was through McTaggart that the young Russell was converted to the prevalent Hegelianism of the day, and it was Russell's reaction against this Hegelianism that began the arc of his later work.\n\nMcTaggart was the most influential advocate of neo-Hegelian idealism in Cambridge at the time of Russell and Moore's reaction against it, as well as being a teacher and personal acquaintance of both men. With F.H. Bradley of Oxford he was, as the most prominent of the surviving British Idealists, the primary target of the new realists' assault. McTaggart's indirect influence was, therefore, very great. Given that modern analytic philosophy can arguably be traced to the work of Russell and Moore in this period, McTaggart's work retains interest to the historian of analytic philosophy despite being, in a very real sense, the product of an earlier age.\n\n\"The Nature of Existence\", with Green's \"Prolegomena to Ethics\" and Bradley's \"Appearance and Reality\", marks the greatest achievement of British Idealism, and McTaggart was the last major British Idealist of the classic period (for the later development of British Idealism, see T.L.S. Sprigge).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He sought to address whether the working class in fact exists, and how the masses of workers that thinkers like Althusser referred to continuously enter into a relationship with knowledge, particularly the limits of philosophers' knowledge with respect to the proletariat. An example of this line of thinking is Rancière's book entitled \"Le philosophe et ses pauvres\" (\"The Philosopher and His Poor\", 1983), a book about the role of the poor in the intellectual lives of philosophers.\n\nMore recently Rancière has written on the topic of human rights and specifically the role of international human rights organizations in asserting the authority to determine which groups of people, again the problem of masses, justify human rights interventions and even war.\n\nRancière's book, \"\" (original title \"Le Maître ignorant: Cinq leçons sur l'émancipation intellectuelle\", published in 1987) was written for educators and educators-to-be. Through the story of Joseph Jacotot, Rancière challenges his readers to consider equality as a starting point rather than a destination. In doing so, he asks educators to abandon the themes and rhetoric of cultural deficiency and salvation. Rather than requiring informed schoolmasters to guide students towards prescribed and alienating ends, Rancière argues that educators can channel the equal intelligence in all to facilitate their intellectual growth in virtually unlimited directions. The schoolmaster need not know anything (and may be ignorant). Rancière begins with the premises that all are of equal intelligence and that any collective educational exercise founded on this principle can provide the insights from which knowledge is constructed. He claims that the poor and disenfranchised should feel perfectly able to teach \"themselves\" whatever it is they want to know. Furthermore, anyone can lead, and the oppressed should not feel bound to experts or reliant on others for their intellectual emancipation.\n\nJacotot advocated the 'equality of intelligence' and claimed that an ignorant person could teach another ignorant person. Rancière developed this idea in \"The Ignorant Schoolmaster\", saying that “there is stultification whenever one intelligence is subordinated to another ... whoever teaches without emancipating stultifies”.\n\nIn 2006, it was reported that Rancière's aesthetic theory had become a point of reference in the visual arts, and Rancière has lectured at such art world events as the Frieze Art Fair. Former French presidential candidate Ségolène Royal described Rancière as her favourite philosopher. Among those intellectuals influenced by his work, Gabriel Rockhill has developed a new paradigm for thinking the historical relation between aesthetics and politics in close dialogue with Rancière's writings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is regarded as one of the greatest contemporary poets of the Arab world and was known for his defence of women's rights.\n\nZahawi was born on 18 June, 1863 in Baghdad. His father, of Iraqi Kurd origin, was the Mufti of Iraq and a member of the scholarly Baban clan; a powerful and prominent family in Kurdish Iraq.His mother was a Turkmen. His parents separated soon after the children were born and the children's mother returned to her family, taking her children with her. His father, who was partial to Jamil's intelligence and quick temper, decided to raise the boy himself. His father taught him poetry from a very young age and encouraged him to develop an inquisitive mind. \n\nHe was raised in Bagdad, where he was initially educated in \"kuttab\" (Q'ranic school). He did not receive a formal education; instead his father engaged private tutors to teach him science, rhetoric and grammar. He may have gained some formal education in jurisprudence, logic, astronomy and exegesis, although details are sketchy. However, it is clear that he was mostly self-taught, using books, especially translations of European works on science and philosophy. Through his father, he participated in Baghdad's literary society by attending \"majalis\" (social gatherings of the literary elite) for discussions of various topics. The informal nature of his education combined with his early exposure to debating societies, contributed to his love of debate and his inquisitive attitude. \n\nIn 1896, he was invited to Istanbul. Between 1896 and 1898, he based himself in Istanbul but also travelled to Yemen on an Imperial decree, as part of a delegation to carry out reforms. In Istanbul, he was appointed Professor of Islamic Studies at the Malakki School and Professor of Arabic Literature at the University of Istanbul. During this period, he came into contact with the Turkish literary society and was exposed to those Turkish poets who were experimenting with modern poetry and seeking to liberate their work from the constraints of meter and rhyme. He also had the opportunity to read Arabic translations of works by Shakespeare and Western poetry. These encounters exposed him to new ideas about modern poetry and its role in political debate, and would subsequently inform his work in terms of both its form and the choice of subject matter.\n\nHe returned to Baghdad briefly, but he was exiled for his outspoken views, by the despotic Hamidi regime and forced to return to Istanbul in around 1908. In Istanbul, he worked for the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP), also known as the Young Turks, where he met with prominent members of the Union movement. He became highly politicised by the relationships formed at this time and remained committed to social reform througout his life. To this end, he regularly contributed regular articles to various publications in Iraq and in Istanbul.\n\nFollowing his return to Baghdad, he held numerous government positions: as a member of the Baghdad Education Council, where he championed education for women and as an editor of the only newspaper in Baghdad, \"al-Zawra\". He was appointed a Professor of law at Baghdad University, but his tenure was short-lived. A controversial article on women's emancipation which exhorted women to give up the veil and called for reforms to the existing divorce laws, caused a public outcry, resulting in his home being mobbed for an entire week. In order to appease the public, al-Zahawi was dismissed from his academic position in 1910. Following this incident, he fled Iraq and resided first in Egypt and later in Turkey. \n\nHis final return to Baghdad was after the British Mandate was formed in 1920. After Iraq's independence in 1921, he was elected to parliament twice and appointed to the upper chamber (1925-29). In his spare time, he could be found in Baghdad's cultural cafés, where he actively participated in arguments with poets and literary figures. \n\nDuring his career, he was a critic of the Wahhabis, the extremist group that was the foundation of the Saudi kingdom, and which subsequently morphed into \"Al Qaeda\" and \"Islamic State\". He described their atrocities and denounced their claims that only they were the true Muslims. He was also a champion of women's rights, criticising the wearing of the veil, the practice of older men marrying adolescent girls, forced marriage without previous acquaintance, polygamy and male privileges. \n\nHe was one of the leading writers in the Arab world, publishing in the major newspapers and journals of Beirut, Cairo, and Baghdad. Describing his life in a collection of his poems, he wrote, \"In my childhood I was thought of as eccentric because of my unusual gestures; in my youth, as feckless because of my ebullient nature, lack of seriousness, and excessive playfulness; in my middle age as courageous for my resistance to tyranny; and in my old age as an apostate because I propounded my philosophical views.\" \n\nHe clung to his principles of simplicity in poetry and the avoidance of the artifice and false conceits that had preoccupied traditional poets. He also stressed the importance of poetry as a vehicle for social commentary. However, his work attracted literary criticism in the period following the first World War, when a wave of nationalism began to influence the arts. By this time, his forthright language and prose-like verse began to look unsophisticated and outdated. Moreover, his use of blank verse, which had always been experimental, began to look naive and clumsy. Although he lost favour with critics, he remained popular with the people because of his gifts as an orator and the accessibility of his writing. Towards the end of his life, he was largely ostracised by the new literary elite. In the 1930s, because of his political views, he was also marginalized by the political establishment. He was embittered by the way he was treated and cast himself as the \"misunderstood poet/philosopher with a perpetually wounded ego.\" \n\nAl-Zahawi wrote poetry in Arabic, Persian, Turkish and Kurdish. Some of his works, such as \"The True Dawn in Refuting Those Who Deny the Seeking of Intercession and the Miracles of Saints\" (1905) have been translated into English, but he himself never learned any European language. Egyptian writer Taha Hussein said of him: \"Zahawi wasn't only the poet of Arabic language or the poet of Iraq, he was also the poet of Egypt and of other countries... he was a poet of the mind... the Ma'arri of this era... but he is the Ma'arri who connected to Europe and used knowledge as a weapon.\"\n\nThe English writer, Gertrude Bell was present at a dinner in 1921, when al-Zahawi read an ode to Faisal ibn Hussein. Bell writes: \n\nHe was the first Arabic poet to introduce \"sh'ir musal\" (blank verse; free of rhyme, no adherence to rhyme or composed of different rhyme) and was an enthusiastic proponent of the form arguing that it liberated poets to focus on expressing their ideas rather than being locked into searching for a rhyming word or phrase. His philosophy and style made him one of the early modern poets in the Arab world and he was lauded as such during the Ottoman era. \n\nHe also published a number of works on the subject of astronomy including: \"The Universe\", \"Gravitation and its Explanation\", \"General Repulsion and Natural and Astronomical Phenomena\", which expounded theories which were ultimately shown to be fundamentally flawed. \n\nSelected works\n\nAl-Zahawi's most celebrated works include: \n\n\n"}
{"id": "33069452", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33069452", "title": "Jivamukti Yoga", "text": "Jivamukti Yoga\n\nThe Jivamukti Yoga method is a proprietary style of yoga created by David Life and Sharon Gannon in 1984.\n\nJivamukti is a physical, ethical, and spiritual practice, combining a vigorous hatha yoga, vinyasa-based physical style with adherence to five central tenets: shastra (scripture), bhakti (devotion), ahimsā (nonviolence, non-harming), nāda (music), and dhyana (meditation). Animal rights, veganism, environmentalism, and social activism are also emphasized. Jivamukti Yoga has developed a reputation as the chosen yoga style of many celebrities.\n\nJivamukti Yoga was co-founded in New York in 1984 by dancer and musician Sharon Gannon and her partner, artist and cafe owner David Life. Gannon and Life met in 1982 in Manhattan. In 1986 they traveled together to India and took the Sivananda teacher training program and met Swami Nirmalananda. Upon their return, they opened the first Jivamukti Yoga Society in the East Village of New York City. In 1990 they began to practice Ashtanga Yoga with Pattabhi Jois in Mysore, India. In 1993, in upstate New York, they met yoga scholar and ashram founder Shri Brahmananda Sarasvati. In 1998, the yoga center moved to Lafayette Street, and in 2000, Jivamukti opened a second center on the Upper East Side. In 2003, senior Jivamukti students Patrick Broome and Gabriela Bozic opened Jivamukti Munich, the first Jivamukti Yoga Center outside of New York City. In 2006, the Jivamukti Yoga School NYC relocated their main headquarters to an environmentally constructed studio in Union Square.\n\nThe name \"Jivamukti\" is an adaptation of the Sanskrit \"jivanmuktih\", wherein \"jiva\" is the individual living soul, and \"mukti\" – like \"moksa\" – is liberation from the cycle of death and rebirth. Thus the Jivamukti method is \"liberation while living\".\n\nThere are five main tenets of the Jivamukti method. These are:\n\nShastra, or scripture, refers to the study and exploration of the four central texts of yoga as well as to the study of the Sanskrit language in which they were first written. The four texts are the \"Yoga Sutras of Patanjali\", the \"Hatha Yoga Pradipika\", the \"Bhagavad Gita\", and the Upanishads.\n\nBhakti, literally \"devotion to God\", is the practice of devotion and humility. Jivamukti Yoga holds that \"God-realization\" is the goal of yoga practice, and that it does not matter to what form of God one's love and devotion is directed; what matters is that the devotion should be directed to something higher than one's own self or ego. Inter-religious understanding and tolerance are significant corollaries to this practice, and altars in Jivamukti centers are typically adorned with images of multiple religious and moral authorities: Gandhi, Martin Luther King and Ingrid Newkirk intermingle with Jesus, Buddha, and Krishna.\n\nAhimsa is the practice of nonviolence, or non-harming. Ahimsa is informed by compassion, and is defined in \"Patanjali's Yoga Sutra\" as the first of five yamas. Yamas define the measure of how the yogi relates to other people and to the external world. The Jivamukti method teaches that the practice of ahimsa extends not only to other humans but to all animal life and advocates ethical vegetarianism both as a means of resolving human karma and as an environmental imperative for the future health of the planet. The Jivamukti method further teaches that the practice of ahimsa includes promoting and providing educational information about animal rights, environmental concerns, and the need to take social/political action.\n\nNāda yoga centers on deep inner listening, chanting, and elevated music. Its theoretical and practical aspects are based on the premise that everything that exists, including human beings, consists of sound vibrations, called nāda. The aim of hatha yoga is to hear the nadam – the soundless sound, which is Om – by first perfecting the ability to listen. Jivamukti Yoga practices this through chanting and inspirational music.\n\nJivamukti classes typically include Sanskrit chanting which integrates scriptural study and bhakti practice with nāda yoga.\n\nContrary to many other schools of yoga, Jivamukti teachers generally do not do the postures while they teach a class. This encourages students to learn by listening, rather than by watching, and in this way develop their ability to listen effectively. Sharon Gannon summarizes the intention of this approach as follows: “Through listening, hearing arises, through hearing knowing, through knowing becoming, by becoming being is possible.”\n\nDhyana, or meditation, as taught in the Jivamukti method is the practice of being still and watching one's own mind think. This practice is intended to enable a person to cease to identify with their thoughts and realize that they are more than their thoughts. All Jivamukti Yoga classes include a meditation practice.\n\nThere are six types of classes particular to Jivamukti:\n\n\nJivamukti Yoga is a branded, proprietary yoga method. The trade name and trademark \"Jivamukti\" is owned by Jivamukti, Inc., a for-profit corporation based in Shady, New York, U.S., and has been continuously used in connection with the corporation's business since 1984. Jivamukti, Inc. operates Jivamukti-branded yoga centers in New York City, Toronto, Berlin, Munich, London and Schloss Elmau in Bavaria, Germany and provides Jivamukti-branded yoga instruction (yoga classes, workshops, retreats, teacher training and certification classes), clothing, body-care products, and instructional materials (books, audio, and video recordings). Jivamukti, Inc. also holds trademarks on \"Jivamukti Yoga\", \"Jivamuktea\", \"Jivamuktea Cafe\", and \"In-Class Private\". Jivamukti, Inc.'s Chief Operating Officer is David Life's nephew, Jules Febre.\n\nPrior to this, the Jivamukti Yoga trade name and trademark was registered by the corporation, \"Jivamukti Yoga Center, Inc.\", which lists Sharon Gannon as its Chief Executive Officer and President, and David Kirkpatrick (the legal name of David Life) and Ana Maria Velasco as corporate officers (both now inactive).\n\n\nJivamukti Yoga is the primary method taught at eleven yoga centers (\"full program centers\") and is also formally recognized as being taught at more than thirty others (\"affiliate centers\"). Instruction in these centers is based on the philosophy developed by Gannon and Life, which is in turn based on the guidance of their gurus and on classical yoga as described in the \"Yoga Sūtras of Patañjali\", the \"Bhagavad Gita\", and \"Hatha Yoga Pradipika\". To teach the Jivamukti Yoga method in one of its centers, an instructor is first required to go through rigorous training and to pass a series of examinations.\n\nJivamukti Yoga's full program centers are located in the United States (New York City, Jersey City, and Washington D.C.), Germany (Munich, Berlin, and Schloss Elmau), the United Kingdom (London), and Mexico (Puebla). Its affiliate centers are located in Australia, Germany, Greece, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Russia, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, and the United States.\n\nJivamukti Yoga School NYC, the Jivamukti Yoga school located at Union Square in Manhattan, has been featured on the BBC, ABC, PBS, and in the New York Times and New York Magazine.\n\nIn 2003, the Jivamukti Yoga School NYC established a 125-acre nature preserve in the Catskill Mountains, near Woodstock, New York. Known as the Wild Woodstock Jivamukti Forest Sanctuary, it serves as the country ashram for the Jivamukti Yoga School and a safe haven and unpolluted habitat for diverse plant and animal species.\n\nIn 2016, accusations of sexual harassment were made public against one of Jivamukti Yoga School’s most senior teachers, Ruth Lauer-Manenti, by one of her female students. The student filed a lawsuit, which has since been settled for an undisclosed amount. Michelle Goldberg, writing about the case for Slate magazine, questioned whether Jivamukti is a workplace, an ashram, or a cult, with a culture of spiritual abuse and secrecy.\n\nAuthor Matthew Remski reported, based on interviews with former employees of Jivamukti, that Jivamukti Yoga School used non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) to \"smooth over student grievances against teachers, or teacher’s [sic] grievances against management\", and to prevent former students and employees from discussing the school’s culture. In exchange, Remski writes, departing personnel and students received cash payments or tuition refunds.\n\nSome celebrities who practice or have practiced Jivamukti Yoga are:\n\n"}
{"id": "8457942", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8457942", "title": "John Dee", "text": "John Dee\n\nJohn Dee (13 July 1527 – 1608 or 1609) was an English mathematician, astronomer, astrologer, occult philosopher, and advisor to Queen Elizabeth I. He devoted much of his life to the study of alchemy, divination, and Hermetic philosophy. He was also an advocate of England's imperial expansion into a \"British Empire\", a term he is generally credited with coining.\n\nDee straddled the worlds of magic and modern science just as the latter was emerging. One of the most learned men of his age, he had been invited to lecture on the geometry of Euclid at the University of Paris while still in his early twenties. Dee was an ardent promoter of mathematics and a respected astronomer, as well as a leading expert in navigation, having trained many of those who would conduct England's voyages of discovery.\n\nSimultaneously with these enormous efforts, Dee immersed himself in the worlds of sorcery, astrology and Hermetic philosophy. He devoted much time and effort in the last thirty years or so of his life to attempting to commune with angels in order to learn the universal language of creation and bring about the pre-apocalyptic unity of mankind. A student of the Renaissance Neo-Platonism of Marsilio Ficino, Dee did not draw distinctions between his mathematical research and his investigations into Hermetic magic, angel summoning and divination. Instead he considered all of his activities to constitute different facets of the same quest: the search for a transcendent understanding of the divine forms which underlie the visible world, which Dee called \"pure verities\".\n\nIn his lifetime, Dee amassed one of the largest libraries in England. His high status as a scholar also allowed him to play a role in Elizabethan politics. He served as an occasional advisor and tutor to Elizabeth I and nurtured relationships with her ministers Francis Walsingham and William Cecil. Dee also tutored and enjoyed patronage relationships with Sir Philip Sidney, his uncle Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester, and Edward Dyer. He also enjoyed patronage from Sir Christopher Hatton.\n\nDee was born in Tower Ward, London, to Rowland Dee, of Welsh descent, and Johanna Wild. His surname \"Dee\" derived from the Welsh \"du\" (); his grandfather was Bedo Ddu of Nant-y-groes, Pilleth, Radnorshire, and John retained his connection with the locality. His father Roland was a mercer and gentleman courtier to Henry VIII. John Dee claimed to be a descendant of Rhodri the Great, Prince of Wales and constructed a pedigree showing his descent from Rhodri. Dee's family arrived in London in the wake of Henry Tudor's coronation as Henry VII. Jane Dee was the daughter of William Wild.\n\nDee attended the Chelmsford Chantry School (now King Edward VI Grammar School) from 1535 to 1542. He entered St John's College, Cambridge, in November 1542, aged 15, graduating BA in 1545 or early 1546. His abilities recognised, he became an original fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, on its founding by Henry VIII in 1546. At Trinity, the clever stage effects he produced for a production of Aristophanes' \"Peace\" procured him the reputation of being a magician that clung to him through life. In the late 1540s and early 1550s, he travelled in Europe, studying at Louvain (1548) and Brussels and lecturing in Paris on Euclid. He studied with Gemma Frisius and became a close friend of the cartographer Gerardus Mercator and cartographer Abraham Ortelius. Dee also travelled extensively throughout Europe meeting and working with as well as learning from other leading continental mathematicians such as Federico Commandino in Italy. He returned to England with an important collection of mathematical and astronomical instruments. In 1552, he met Gerolamo Cardano in London: during their acquaintance they investigated a perpetual motion machine as well as a gem purported to have magical properties.\n\nRector at Upton-upon-Severn from 1553, Dee was offered a readership in mathematics at Oxford in 1554, which he declined; he was occupied with writing and perhaps hoped for a better position at court. In 1555, Dee became a member of the Worshipful Company of Mercers, as his father had, through the company's system of patrimony.\n\nThat same year, 1555, he was arrested and charged with \"calculating\" for having cast horoscopes of Queen Mary and Princess Elizabeth; the charges were expanded to treason against Mary. Dee appeared in the Star Chamber and exonerated himself, but was turned over to the Catholic Bishop Bonner for religious examination. His strong and lifelong penchant for secrecy perhaps worsening matters, this entire episode was only the most dramatic in a series of attacks and slanders that would dog Dee throughout his life. Clearing his name yet again, he soon became a close associate of Bonner.\n\nDee presented Queen Mary with a visionary plan for the preservation of old books, manuscripts and records and the founding of a national library, in 1556, but his proposal was not taken up. Instead, he expanded his personal library at his house in Mortlake, tirelessly acquiring books and manuscripts in England and on the European Continent. Dee's library, a centre of learning outside the universities, became the greatest in England and attracted many scholars.\nWhen Elizabeth took the throne in 1558, Dee became her trusted advisor on astrological and scientific matters, choosing Elizabeth's coronation date himself. From the 1550s through the 1570s, he served as an advisor to England's voyages of discovery, providing technical assistance in navigation and ideological backing in the creation of a \"British Empire\", a term that he was the first to use. Dee wrote a letter to William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley, in October 1574 seeking patronage. He claimed to have occult knowledge of treasure in the Welsh Marches, and of valuable ancient manuscripts kept at Wigmore Castle, knowing that the Lord Treasurer's ancestors came from this area.\nIn 1577, Dee published \"General and Rare Memorials pertayning to the Perfect Arte of Navigation\", a work that set out his vision of a maritime empire and asserted English territorial claims on the New World. Dee was acquainted with Humphrey Gilbert and was close to Sir Philip Sidney and his circle.\n\nIn 1564, Dee wrote the Hermetic work \"Monas Hieroglyphica\" (\"The Hieroglyphic Monad\"), an exhaustive Cabalistic interpretation of a glyph of his own design, meant to express the mystical unity of all creation. Having dedicated it to Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor in an effort to gain patronage, Dee attempted to present it to him during the time of his ascension to the throne of Hungary. This work was esteemed by many of Dee's contemporaries, but the work can not be interpreted today without the secret oral tradition from that era.\n\nHe published a \"Mathematical Preface\" to Henry Billingsley's English translation of Euclid's \"Elements\" in 1570, arguing the central importance of mathematics and outlining mathematics' influence on the other arts and sciences. Intended for an audience outside the universities, it proved to be Dee's most widely influential and frequently reprinted work.\n\nOne of the important early products of the English School was the first English translation of the Elements of Euclid. This translation was carried out by The Lord Mayor of London Sir Henry Billingsley and not from a Latin translation but direct from the Greek. Published in 1570 this mathematical milestone contained a preface as well as copious notes and supplementary material from John Dee and this preface is considered to be one of Dee’s most important mathematical works.\n\nBy the early 1580s, Dee was growing dissatisfied with his progress in learning the secrets of nature as well as his failing influence and recognition in court circles. Failure of his proposed calendar revision, imperial recommendations and ambivalent results from exploration of North America had nearly brought his hopes of political patronage to an end. As a result, he began a more energetic turn towards the supernatural as a means to acquire knowledge. Specifically, he sought to contact spirits through the use of a \"scryer\" or crystal-gazer, which would act as an intermediary between Dee and the angels.\n\nDee's first attempts with several scryers were not satisfactory, but, in 1582, he met Edward Kelley (then going under the name of Edward Talbot to disguise his conviction for \"coining\" or forgery), who impressed him greatly with his abilities. Dee took Kelley into his service and began to devote all his energies to his supernatural pursuits. These \"spiritual conferences\" or \"actions\" were conducted with an air of intense Christian piety, always after periods of purification, prayer and fasting. Dee was convinced of the benefits they could bring to mankind. (The character of Kelley is harder to assess: some have concluded that he acted with complete cynicism, but delusion or self-deception are not out of the question. Kelley's \"output\" is remarkable for its sheer volume, its intricacy and its vividness). Dee maintained that the angels laboriously dictated several books to him this way, through Kelley, some in a special angelic or Enochian language.\n\nIn 1583, Dee met the visiting impoverished yet popular Polish nobleman Albert Łaski who, after overstaying his welcome at court, invited Dee to accompany him on his return to Poland. With some prompting by the \"angels\" (again through Kelley) and his worsening status at court, Dee was persuaded to go. Dee, Kelley and their families left for the Continent in September 1583, but Łaski proved to be bankrupt and out of favour in his own country. Dee and Kelley began a nomadic life in Central Europe, meanwhile continuing their spiritual conferences, which Dee recorded meticulously in his diaries and almanacs. They had audiences with Emperor Rudolf II in Prague Castle and King Stefan Batory of Poland whom they attempted to convince of the importance of angelic communication. The meeting with the Polish King, Stefan Batory, took place at the royal castle at Niepołomice (near Kraków, then the capital of Poland) and was later widely analyzed by Polish historians (Ryszard Zieliński, Roman Żelewski, Roman Bugaj) and writers (Waldemar Łysiak). While generally Dee was accepted as a man of wide and deep knowledge, they mistrusted his connection with the English monarch, Elizabeth I. They could not be sure that their meetings were without political ramifications. Some thought (and still do) that Dee was in fact a spy for the English monarch. Nevertheless, the Polish king, a devout Catholic and very cautious of supernatural media, began their meeting(s) with the affirmation that any prophetic revelations must be in keeping with the teachings of Jesus Christ, the mission of the Holy Catholic Church, and the approval of the Pope.\n\nIn 1587, during a spiritual conference in Bohemia, Kelley informed Dee that the angel Uriel had ordered the men to share all their possessions, including their wives. By this time, Kelley had gained some renown as an alchemist and in fact was more sought-after than Dee in this regard: this was a line of work that had prospects for serious and long-term financial gain, especially among the royal families of central Europe. Dee, on the other hand, was more interested in communicating with the angels who he believed would help him solve the mysteries of the heavens through mathematics, optics, astrology, science and navigation. It may be that Kelley in fact wished to end Dee's dependence on him as a scryer for their increasingly lengthy and frequent spiritual conferences. The order for wife-sharing caused Dee great anguish, but he apparently did not doubt its genuineness. They apparently did share wives. However, Dee broke off the conferences immediately afterwards. Dee returned to England in 1589: Kelley went on to be the alchemist for Emperor Rudolf II. Nine months later, on 28 February 1588, a son was born to Dee's wife, whom Dee baptised Theodorus Trebonianus Dee and raised as his own. It is possible that this child was Kelley's; Dee was 60 at the time, Edward Kelley was 32.\n\nDee returned to Mortlake after six years abroad to find his home vandalized, his library ruined and many of his prized books and instruments stolen. Furthermore, Dee found that increasing criticism of occult practices had made England even more inhospitable to his magical practices and natural philosophy. Dee sought support from Elizabeth, who hoped he could persuade Kelley to return and ease England's economic burdens through alchemy. She finally appointed Dee Warden of Christ's College, Manchester, in 1595. This former College of Priests had been re-established as a Protestant institution by a Royal Charter of 1578.\n\nHowever, he could not exert much control over the Fellows of that College, who despised or cheated him. Early in his tenure, he was consulted on the demonic possession of seven children, but took little interest in the matter, although he did allow those involved to consult his still extensive library.\n\nHe left Manchester in 1605 to return to London; however, he remained Warden until his death. By that time, Elizabeth was dead, and James I provided no support. Dee spent his final years in poverty at Mortlake, forced to sell off various of his possessions to support himself and his daughter, Katherine, who cared for him until the end. He died in Mortlake late in 1608 or early 1609 aged 82 (there are no extant records of the exact date as both the parish registers and Dee's gravestone are missing). In 2013 a memorial plaque to Dee was placed on the south wall of the present church.\n\nDee was married three times and had eight children. He first married Katherine Constable in 1565; she died in 1574 and their union resulted in no children. His second (also childless) marriage to an unknown woman lasted only a year until her death in 1576. From 1577 to 1601, Dee kept a sporadic diary (also referred to as his \"almanac\") from which most of what we know about his life during that time has been gleaned. In 1578 he married the 23-year-old Jane Fromond: Dee was fifty-one at the time. Jane had her own connections to the Elizabethan court: she was a lady in waiting to Elizabeth Clinton, Countess of Lincoln, a position she gave up when she married Dee. When in 1587, Kelley informed Dee of the angel's wish that they share wives, Jane Dee (née Fromond) was the wife Dee shared with him. Although Dee complied with the angel's supposed request for a while, he was apparently distressed by the arrangement and it was one reason why the two men parted company not long thereafter. Some believe that Dee's son Theodore, born nine months later, could have been Kelley's son, not Dee's.\n\nJane died in Manchester of the bubonic plague and was buried in the Manchester Cathedral burial grounds in March 1604. Michael, born in Prague, died on his father's birthday in 1594. Theodore, born in Třeboň, died in Manchester in 1601. His sons Arthur Dee and Rowland survived him, as did his daughter Katherine \"who was his companion to the end\". No records exist for his youngest daughters Madinia, Frances and Margaret after 1604, so it is widely assumed they died in the same epidemic that took their mother. (Dee had by this time ceased keeping his diary).\n\nWhile Arthur was a student at the Westminster School, Dee wrote a letter to his headmaster that echoes the worries of boarding school parents in every century. Arthur was an apprentice in much of his father's alchemical and scientific work, and was in fact often his scryer until Kelley came along. Arthur went on to become an alchemist and hermetic author, whose works were published by Elias Ashmole.\n\nAs regards Dee's physical appearance, the antiquary John Aubrey gives the following description: \"He was tall and slender. He wore a gown like an artist's gown, with hanging sleeves, and a slit... A very fair, clear sanguine complexion... a long beard as white as milk. A very handsome man.\"\n\nDee was influenced by the Hermetic and Platonic-Pythagorean doctrines that were pervasive in the Renaissance. He believed that numbers were the basis of all things and the key to knowledge. From Hermeticism, he drew the belief that man had the potential for divine power, and he believed this divine power could be exercised through mathematics. His ultimate goal was to help bring forth a unified world religion through the healing of the breach of the Roman Catholic and Protestant churches and the recapture of the pure theology of the ancients.\n\nFrom 1570 Dee advocated a policy of political and economic strengthening of England and imperial expansion into the New World. In his manuscript, \"Brytannicae reipublicae synopsis\" (1570), he outlined the current state of the Elizabethan Realm and was concerned with trade, ethics and national strength.\n\nHis 1576 \"General and rare memorials pertayning to the Perfect Arte of Navigation\" was the first volume in an unfinished series planned to advocate the rise of imperial expansion. In the highly symbolic frontispiece, Dee included a figure of Britannia kneeling by the shore beseeching Elizabeth I, to protect her empire by strengthening her navy. Dee used Geoffrey's inclusion of Ireland in Arthur's imperial conquests to argue that Arthur had established a 'British empire' abroad. He further argued that England exploit new lands through colonisation and that this vision could become reality through maritime supremacy. Dee has been credited with the coining of the term \"British Empire\", however, Humphrey Llwyd has also been credited with the first use of the term in his \"Commentarioli Britannicae Descriptionis Fragmentum\", published eight years earlier in 1568.\n\nDee posited a formal claim to North America on the back of a map drawn in 1577–80; he noted \"Circa 1494 Mr Robert Thorn his father, and Mr Eliot of Bristow, discovered Newfound Land.\" In his \"Title Royal\" of 1580, he invented the claim that Madog ab Owain Gwynedd had discovered America, with the intention of ensuring that England's claim to the New World was stronger than that of Spain. He further asserted that Brutus of Britain and King Arthur as well as Madog had conquered lands in the Americas and therefore their heir Elizabeth I of England had a priority claim there.\n\nAbout ten years after Dee's death, the antiquarian Robert Cotton purchased land around Dee's house and began digging in search of papers and artifacts. He discovered several manuscripts, mainly records of Dee's angelic communications. Cotton's son gave these manuscripts to the scholar Méric Casaubon, who published them in 1659, together with a long introduction critical of their author, as \"A True & Faithful Relation of What passed for many Yeers between Dr. John Dee (A Mathematician of Great Fame in Q. Eliz. and King James their Reignes) and some spirits.\" As the first public revelation of Dee's spiritual conferences, the book was extremely popular and sold quickly. Casaubon, who believed in the reality of spirits, argued in his introduction that Dee was acting as the unwitting tool of evil spirits when he believed he was communicating with angels. This book is largely responsible for the image, prevalent for the following two and a half centuries, of Dee as a dupe and deluded fanatic. Around the same time the \"True and Faithful Relation\" was published, members of the Rosicrucian movement claimed Dee as one of their number. There is doubt, however, that an organized Rosicrucian movement existed during Dee's lifetime, and no evidence that he ever belonged to any secret fraternity. Dee's reputation as a magician and the vivid story of his association with Edward Kelley have made him a seemingly irresistible figure to fabulists, writers of horror stories and latter-day magicians. The accretion of false and often fanciful information about Dee often obscures the facts of his life, remarkable as they are in themselves. It also does nothing to promote his Christian leanings: Dee looked to the angels to speak to him about how he might heal the very deep and serious rifts between the Roman Catholic Church, the Reformed Church of England and the Protestant movement in England. Queen Elizabeth I used him as her court astronomer on a number of occasions not solely because he practised Hermetic arts, but because he was a deeply religious and learned man whom she trusted.\n\nA re-evaluation of Dee's character and significance came in the 20th century, largely as a result of the work of the historians Charlotte Fell-Smith and Dame Frances Yates. Both writers brought into focus the parallel roles magic, science and religion held in the Elizabethan Renaissance. Fell-Smith writes: \"There is perhaps no learned author in history who has been so persistently misjudged, nay, even slandered, by his posterity, and not a voice in all the three centuries uplifted even to claim for him a fair hearing. Surely it is time that the cause of all this universal condemnation should be examined in the light of reason and science; and perhaps it will be found to exist mainly in the fact that he was too far advanced in speculative thought for his own age to understand.\" As a result of this and subsequent re-evaluation, Dee is now viewed as a serious scholar and book-collector, a devoted Christian (albeit during a very confusing time for that faith), an able scientist, and one of the most learned men of his day. His personal library at Mortlake was the largest in the country (before it was vandalized), and was created at enormous and sometimes ruinous personal expense; it was considered one of the finest in Europe, perhaps second only to that of De Thou. As well as being an astrological and scientific advisor to Elizabeth and her court, he was an early advocate of the colonisation of North America and a visionary of a British Empire stretching across the North Atlantic.\n\nDee promoted the sciences of navigation and cartography. He studied closely with Gerardus Mercator, and he owned an important collection of maps, globes and astronomical instruments. He developed new instruments as well as special navigational techniques for use in polar regions. Dee served as an advisor to the English voyages of discovery, and personally selected pilots and trained them in navigation. He believed that mathematics (which he understood mystically) was central to the progress of human learning. The centrality of mathematics to Dee's vision makes him to that extent more modern than Francis Bacon, though some scholars believe Bacon purposely downplayed mathematics in the anti-occult atmosphere of the reign of James I. It should be noted, though, that Dee's understanding of the role of mathematics is radically different from our contemporary view. Dee's promotion of mathematics outside the universities was an enduring practical achievement. As with most of his writings, Dee chose to write in English, rather than Latin, to make his writings accessible to the general public. His \"Mathematical Preface\" to Euclid was meant to promote the study and application of mathematics by those without a university education, and was very popular and influential among the \"mecanicians\": the new and growing class of technical craftsmen and artisans. Dee's preface included demonstrations of mathematical principles that readers could perform themselves without special education or training.\n\nDuring the 20th century, the Municipal Borough of Richmond (now the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames) honoured John Dee by naming a street near Mortlake, where he lived, \"Dee Road\" after him.\n\nDee was a friend of Tycho Brahe and was familiar with the work (translated into English by his ward and assistant, Thomas Digges) of Nicolaus Copernicus. Many of his astronomical calculations were based on Copernican assumptions, but he never openly espoused the heliocentric theory. Dee applied Copernican theory to the problem of calendar reform. In 1583, he was asked to advise the Queen about the new Gregorian calendar that had been promulgated by Pope Gregory XIII from October 1582. His advice was that England should accept it, albeit with seven specific amendments. The first of these was that the adjustment should not be the 10 days that would restore the calendar to the time of the Council of Nicaea in 325 AD, but by 11 days, which would restore it to the birth of Christ. Another proposal of Dee's was to align the civil and liturgical years, and to have them both start on 1 January. Perhaps predictably, England chose to spurn any suggestions that had papist origins, despite any merit they may objectively have, and Dee's advice was rejected.\n\nHe has often been associated with the Voynich manuscript. Wilfrid Michael Voynich, who bought the manuscript in 1912, suggested that Dee may have owned the manuscript and sold it to Rudolph II. Dee's contacts with Rudolph were far less extensive than had previously been thought, however, and Dee's diaries show no evidence of the sale. Dee was, however, known to have possessed a copy of the \"Book of Soyga\", another enciphered book.\n\n\nThe British Museum holds several items once owned by Dee and associated with the spiritual conferences:\n\nIn December 2004, both a shew stone (a stone used for scrying) formerly belonging to Dee and a mid-17th century explanation of its use written by Nicholas Culpeper were stolen from the Science Museum in London; they were recovered shortly afterwards.\n\nDee was a popular figure in literary works written by his contemporaries, and he has continued to feature in popular culture ever since, particularly in fiction or fantasy set during his lifetime or that deals with magic or the occult.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Her work is in the philosophy of the cognitive sciences, including philosophy of psychology and philosophy of psychiatry, as well as bioethics and medical ethics. She was educated at the University of Bologna, King's College London, University of Oxford and the Australian National University, and worked briefly at the University of Manchester before beginning at Birmingham, where she has been a lecturer, senior lecturer, reader and now professor.\n\nShe has published three sole-authored books: \"An Introduction to the Philosophy of Science\" (Polity Press, 2008); \"Delusions and Other Irrational Beliefs\" (Oxford University Press, 2009); and \"Irrationality\" (Polity, 2014). \"Delusions and Other Irrational Beliefs\", in which Bortolotti challenges the argument that delusions cannot be beliefs due to their irrationality, was the winner of the 2011 American Philosophical Association book prize. In addition, she edited \"Philosophy and Happiness\" (Palgrave Macmillan, 2009) and \"Delusions in Context\" (Palgrave Macmillan, 2018) and co-edited \"Psychiatry as Cognitive Neuroscience: Philosophical Perspectives\" (Oxford University Press, 2009).\n\nBortolotti studied philosophy at the University of Bologna, spending several months at the University of Leeds, graduating in 1997. Her undergraduate dissertation, supervised by Eva Picardi, was on conceptual relativism. In 1998, she graduated with an MA in philosophy from King's College London. Here, she wrote on scientific revolutions under Donald Gillies. Next, she moved to the University of Oxford, where she read for a BPhil. Her thesis, supervised by Bill Newton-Smith, was on \"the rationality debate in philosophy and the cognitive sciences\". Bortolotti read for her PhD at the Australian National University. Her doctoral thesis, which was supervised by Martin Davies, challenged Donald Davidson's account of belief ascription. She completed her PhD in 2004.\n\nBortolotti worked as a research associate at the University of Manchester from 2004–2005. She worked as part of the Centre for Social Ethics and Policy (where she was also a honorary lecturer) under John Harris on a project exploring the nature of research, also covering research ethics and law. She became a part of the Department of Philosophy at the University of Birmingham in 2005, as a lecturer. In 2007, she took up a visiting professorship at the European School of Molecular Medicine, Milan, which she held until 2008; in that same year, she spent several months at the Macquarie Centre for Cognitive Science, Macquarie University on a research fellowship and was promoted to senior lecturer at the University of Birmingham. 2008 was also the year of publication of her first book, which was a textbook entitled \"An Introduction to the Philosophy of Science\", published by Polity. A Portuguese version was published in 2013.\n\nBortolotti published three books in 2009. She edited \"Philosophy and Happiness\", a collection released by Palgrave Macmillan, and co-edited, with Matthew R. Broome, \"Psychiatry as Cognitive Neuroscience: Philosophical Perspectives\". The former book arose from a 2007 conference at Birmingham entitled Happiness and the Meaning of Life. It featured 14 chapters, split into two sections: \"Happiness and the Meaningful Life\" and \"Happiness and the Mind\". The latter book was published by Oxford University Press, and contained essays by a range of academics, broadly addressing the status of psychiatry as a science. It was widely reviewed, and was listed as one 2009's \"books of the year\" in \"The Guardian\", with Mary Warnock saying that \"[d]espite its title, it's a gripping read\".\n\nBortolotti's third book in 2009 was \"Delusions and Other Irrational Beliefs\", a monograph exploring delusions and requirements for the ascription of beliefs. The book was highly successful, being awarded the American Philosophical Association's 2011 book prize. Granted in recognition of the \"best ... book published by a younger scholar in the previous two years\", the prize is awarded every two years and carries with it a US$4000 award. The book was reviewed in a number of publications, and was the subject of a special issue in the journal \"Neuroethics\". The issue, edited by Neil Levy, contained five articles engaging with the book. These were by: Jakob Hohwy and Vivek Rajan; Eric Schwitzgebel; Dominic Murphy; Keith Frankish; and Maura Tumulty. In addition, Bortolotti contributed a précis of the book and an article in defence of some of her claims.\n\nIn 2011, she became a reader at Birmingham, and then, in 2013, a professor. In 2014, she published \"Irrationality\" as part of Polity's Key Concepts in Philosophy series, and was the editor of 2018's \"Delusions in Context\", an open access collection published by Palgrave Macmillan.\n\nIn \"Delusions and Other Irrational Beliefs\", Bortolotti challenges the idea that delusions are not beliefs given that they are irrational. While held to be beliefs in the medical literature, the status of delusions is disputed by philosophers, who have denied that delusions are beliefs on account of their deeply unusual content—such as the delusion that one is actually dead—and because they work differently from paradigmatic beliefs. For example, delusions are often maintained despite overwhelming counter-evidence, or are not reacted to in the way one would expect given their content.\n\nAfter setting out the background to the question, Bortolotti explores whether the procedural irrationality of delusions—the fact that they do not rationally relate to the other intentional states of the agent—justifies the denial that they are beliefs. She denies that it does, given that many paradigm beliefs display failures of procedural rationality. She then moves on to the epistemic irrationality of delusions, i.e., the fact that they are not supported by evidence. This can also not be used to challenge the status of delusions as beliefs, she argues, as many widespread ordinary beliefs are also epistemically irrational. She next addresses the idea that delusions are not beliefs as, first, they are not acted upon in the appropriate way, and, second, people with delusions cannot provide good reasons for their holding the content of the delusion. Though allowing that these characterisations of people with delusions can be correct, she argues that these failures of so-called agential rationality can also be found in people who do not have delusions. Bortolotti holds that the status of thoughts which subjects do not endorse (such as inserted thoughts) as beliefs is in question, but that beliefs that are both endorsed and self-ascribed contribute to one's conception of self as part of a self-narrative.\n\nShe concludes her book by rejecting the rationality constraint on belief ascription. She challenges the idealisation of beliefs, but endorses the goal of separating beliefs and other intentional states. She argues that the difference between delusional and normal beliefs must concern more than their epistemic features. The difference between delusions and irrational (but non-delusional) beliefs is, she claims, one of degree, and not one of kind.\n\nIn addition to her books, Bortolotti has published over 50 articles in peer reviewed journals and over 20 chapters in edited collections. She is a series editor for Oxford's International Perspectives in Philosophy & Psychiatry series and on the editorial board of Bloomsbury's Science, Ethics & Innovation series. She has served on the editorial board of a number of journals, as well as acting as the review editor for \"Frontiers in Theoretical and Philosophical Psychology\", associate editor for \"Ethical Theory and Moral Practice\" and e-letter's editor for the \"Journal of Medical Ethics\". She has guest-edited or co-guest-edited several journal special issues, including issues of the \"European Journal of Analytic Philosophy\", the \"Journal of Consciousness Studies\", and \"Consciousness and Cognition\".\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6420680", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6420680", "title": "Mitzvah Technique", "text": "Mitzvah Technique\n\nThe Mitzvah Technique is focused on dealing with body mechanics in a state of motion. It is a development of the Alexander Technique, the Feldenkrais Method and health-oriented work on musculoskeletal problems and stress diseases. Each of these techniques is based on correcting common postural faults by addressing the neuromuscular system through postural re-education. Yet, the Mitzvah Technique encompasses both a unique philosophy and a set of procedures. This includes the discipline, exercises, and the work that Mitzvah Technique practitioners do with their hands.\n\nThe Mitzvah Technique has been designed as an easily learned rehabilitative and self-care discipline. It utilizes body mechanics in the acts of standing, sitting, and walking. The philosophy is that with practice, the discipline becomes integrated into all common activities of daily life.\n\nThe Mitzvah Technique is based on the philosophy of the Mitzvah Mechanism. The Mechanism consists of a sequence of natural body movements that magnify the rippling motion in the body. There are four components to the Mitzvah Mechanism: (1) The interplay of physical forces acting between the pelvis and spine, (2) the rippling spinal motion, (3) the dynamic relationship involving the pelvis, spine and head in a synchronized motion, and (4) the freedom of the head to balance on its spinal support. All of these together promote the operation of the Mitzvah Mechanism.\n\nThe Mitzvah Technique is designed to improve posture and release tension and stress through exercises and therapeutic table work. It claims to realign, rebalance and exercise the entire body during sitting, standing and walking. Its aim is to replace long-term work by practitioners, to have people learn how to use the Mitzvah Technique itself. Musicians, actors and singers have been extensive users.\n\nThe Mitzvah Technique contends that activating and practicing the Mitzvah Exercise and mastering its discipline are what corrects faulty posture and, by extension, many of the aches and pains associated with it. The Mitzvah Exercise is a set of movements involving sitting, standing, and walking. The Exercise requires no special equipment other than a chair or stool and space for walking around. The seat should be firm and flat and low enough so that the feet will be flat on the floor when the body is seated. Loose clothing and no shoes are suggested. This is to allow freedom of movement at the hip joint and the transfer of energy through the feet.\n\nThe Exercise should be performed under the direction of a suitable Mitzvah Technique teacher and does not substitute for necessary professional health care. It is best described in a booklet prepared by the founder of the Technique, M. Cohen-Nehemia: \"The Mitzvah Exercise and Its Principle\".\n\nThe Mitzvah Technique is designed to improve posture and release tension and stress through exercises and therapeutic table work. It is based on the \"Mitzvah Mechanism\", an upward rippling motion that gently reinforces the body’s balance with gravity. It realigns, rebalances and exercises the entire body during sitting, standing and walking. As a result, this mechanism is readily applied to daily activities.\n\nThe technique was developed by M. Cohen-Nehemia of Toronto, a Yemeni-Israeli immigrant to Canada. It was originally derived from the Alexander Technique, but has independently developed since the early 1970s.\n\nM. Cohen-Nehemia, the originator of the Mitzvah Technique was born and raised in Jerusalem in 1924. There he studied classical, modern and oriental dance and was a member of the Inbal Dance Theater of Israel. Similar to F. M. Alexander who lost his voice as an actor and regained it through self-discovery, Nehemia suffered major back problems as a dancer and gained functionality by successfully helping himself through his own experiences and research on body movement. He participated in training seminars for dance and physical education teachers at the kibbutz school which gave him insights into the relationship between body movement and body health.\n\nNehemia also studied anatomy with Dr. Yitzhak Farine of the Tel-Hashomer government hospital. This resulted in Dr. Farine inviting Nehemia to work at the hospital’s rehabilitation center. Nehemia was introduced to the Alexander Technique through a course given at the Tel HaShomer Hospital to medical staff. This introduction affected Nehemia’s work. Together with his wife Malka, they travelled to London where Nehemia spent five years qualifying as an Alexander Teacher at the London School as well as studying at F.M. Alexander’s studio. He concomitantly began developing his own version of the Alexander Technique that he called the Mitzvah Technique to emphasize the rippling motion of the body.\n\nWhen Nehemia returned to Israel, he assisted Moshe Feldenkrais by introducing the Mitzvah Technique into the Feldenkrais Method. They worked together at the Tel HaShomer Hospital in the physical rehabilitation of wounded Israeli Defence Force soldiers suffering with severe back and spinal injuries. At the same time, Nehemia was taking classes given by Feldenkrais for teachers and actors. As a dancer and Alexander Teacher, Nehemia also spent years observing working bodies in action among animals, children, fellow Inbal dancers and the nomadic Bedouin. Out of these myriad experiences and observations came the fuller development of the Mitzvah Technique, emphasizing the natural rippling motion of the spine.\n\nNehemia came to Toronto in the late 1960s where he established the Centre for the Alexander Technique that later became the Mitzvah Technique Centre. This centre has trained scores of Mitzvah teachers and treated thousands of clients who have come from around the world. Nehemia died November 18, 2018 at the age of 94 after years debilitated by a stroke.\n\n"}

{"id": "2308363", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2308363", "title": "Passage Meditation", "text": "Passage Meditation\n\nPassage Meditation is a book by Eknath Easwaran, originally published in 1978 with the title Meditation. The book describes a meditation program, also now commonly referred to as Passage Meditation. Easwaran developed this method of meditation in the 1960s, and first taught it systematically at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nThe program is an eight-point program intended for the \"spiritual growth\" of the practitioner. The first step in the program involves meditating on a text passage, and since the 1990s the method as a whole has come to be known as \"Passage Meditation\" (not Easwaran's term). The book has been frequently reprinted and translated into 14 languages. It is reported that more than 200,000 copies were sold in the period of 1978 to 2001.\n\nThe first edition of the book had the full title \"Meditation; commonsense directions for an uncommon life\" (1978). A second edition in 1991 was subtitled \"a simple eight-point program for translating spiritual ideals into daily life\", and a third, revised edition of the book was published posthumously as \"Passage Meditation; Bringing the Deep Wisdom of the Heart Into Daily Life\" (2008).\n\nA fourth, revised edition was published as \"Passage Meditation – A Complete Spiritual Practice: Train Your Mind and Find a Life that Fulfills\" (2016). The fourth edition included a new part, not contained in earlier editions, with approximately 80 pages of \"Questions and Answers\" to numerous questions about meditation (pp. 182–264).\n\nAll editions of \"Passage Meditation\" contain a chapter dedicated to each of the eight practices or \"points\" of Easwaran's method of meditation. Each edition also contains a preface by the author in which he explains how he discovered the passage meditation method.\n\nMeditating on a passage is the first point in Easwaran's eight point program of Passage Meditation, and he recommends practicing it for 30 minutes each day on first rising. The other seven points are to be woven in at various times throughout the day or week. Each of the book's eight main chapters are dedicated to explaining one of the eight points:\n\n\nMeditation on a passage involves silent, focused repetition during meditation of memorized selections from scriptures of the world and writings of great mystics. According to Easwaran, the practice of meditating on a specific passage of text (Easwaran suggests the Prayer of Saint Francis or Psalm 23 as examples) has the effect of eventually transforming \"character, conduct, and consciousness.\" The term passage is chosen to describe a spiritually-inspired text that one meditates on, during an extended period of time set aside for meditation, as compared to a mantram (or mantra). Easwaran collected an anthology of selections from the world's spiritual texts, God Makes the Rivers to Flow, for use in meditation.\n\nRepetition of a mantram. Easwaran describes a mantram as a short, powerful spiritual formula which can be repeated, at any time during the day or night, to call up the best and deepest in ourselves, and help to slow down, to become more one-pointed, and to put others first.\n\nSlowing Down is an important spiritual discipline. Living faster and faster gives no time for inner reflection or sensitivity to others, making our lives tense, insecure, inefficient, and superficial. Slowing down helps achieve freedom of action, good relations with others, health and vitality, calmness of mind, and the ability to grow.\n\nOne-pointed attention helps to unify consciousness and deepen concentration. Training the mind to give full attention to one thing at a time, whether it is in science or the arts or sports or a profession, is a basic requirement for achieving a goal.\n\nTraining the senses means freeing the mind from the tyranny of likes and dislikes so as to \"live in freedom\", \"live intentionally\"\n\nPutting others first. Dwelling on ourselves builds a wall between ourselves and others. Those who keep thinking about their needs, their wants, their plans, their ideas, cannot help becoming lonely and insecure. As human beings, it is our nature to be part of a whole, to live in a context where personal relationships are supportive and close.\n\nSpiritual Fellowship with people whose companionship is elevating, and working together for a selfless goal without expecting any reward or recognition, augment and enhance the individual's capacities.\n\nEaswaran says that the eight points, though they may at first seem unrelated, are closely linked. \"Quieting your mind in morning meditation, for instance, will help your efforts to slow down at work, and slowing down at work will, in turn, improve your meditation ... Unless you practice all of them, you cannot progress safely and far\".\n\nPassage Meditation does not require adherence to any particular religion or belief.\n\nThe fourth edition (published in 2016) also contains about 80 pages dedicated to answering numerous questions about how to practice the program.\n\nWorkers in professional fields, as well as writers of popular books, have cited or been influenced by the passage meditation program. Sometimes, the passage meditation program has been included among resources for complementary and alternative medicine.\n\nSeveral empirical research studies have examined the effects on health professionals and college undergraduates from receiving training in the Passage Meditation (PM) program. Peer-reviewed research, published in professional psychology and health journals, has shown that following the passage meditation program reduces stress and increases confidence in tasks such as caregiving\n\nThese studies mostly used randomized methods. Like much recent research on meditation (e.g., on mindfulness meditation), research studies on Passage Meditation have neither postulated nor claimed to infer the operation of supernatural or other non-natural, non-psychological processes. Research on Passage Meditation through early 2007 was reviewed in chapter 6 of \"Spirit, science and health: How the spiritual mind fuels physical wellness\".\n\nIn \"Neurology Now\", published by the American Academy of Neurology, the article \"Meditation as Medicine\" states that various well-designed studies show that meditation can increase attention span, sharpen focus, improve memory, and dull the perception of pain, and lists Passage Meditation as a common meditation method.\n\nPassage Meditation has sometimes been integrated into college curricula.\n\nIn 2001, \"Publishers Weekly\" reported that the book \"Meditation\" (later republished in as \"Passage Meditation\") had \"sold more than 200,000 copies since its 1978 debut.\" English editions have been published in the US, the UK, and India.\nNon-English translations of the book have been published in Bulgarian, Chinese, Czech, Dutch, French, German, Hungarian, Korean, Lithuanian, Romanian, Russian, Slovenian, Spanish, and Telugu,\nThe four US editions are:\n\n\nEnglish-language editions have been published in the United Kingdom by Taylor & Francis (1979, ) and Penguin (1996, ), and in India by Jaico (2008, ).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "31043902", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31043902", "title": "Queen of Angels Foundation", "text": "Queen of Angels Foundation\n\nThe Queen of Angels Foundation is an association of lay faithful of the Roman Catholic Church dedicated to fostering devotion to Mary, Mother of Jesus. The Foundation is a volunteer group of lay men and women who \"...strive together in a common endeavor to foster a more perfect life for themselves and their community by promoting reverence for the Blessed Virgin Mary, in whose name, as Our Lady of the Angels, the City and Archdiocese of Los Angeles were founded...\" and whom Catholics revere as Queen of Heaven and Empress of the Americas.\n\nThe Queen of Angels Foundation is the official sponsor of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles' annual celebration of the City of Los Angeles' founding. This event takes place in Downtown Los Angeles on the last Saturday of August.\n\nThe Foundation was launched in February 2011 in Los Angeles, California as a Roman Catholic Marian Movement by layman Mark Anchor Albert. Membership is open to all practising Catholics, and educational and devotional meetings for the benefit of members are held monthly. The Foundation enjoys tax-exemption as a California Nonprofit Religious Corporation.\n\nThe Queen of Angels Foundation was founded in February 2011 by attorney and philanthropist Mark Anchor Albert. It is a lay association of the Roman Catholic Church and is also a recognized tax-exempted religious organization .\n\nThe Queen of Angeles Foundation has stated as its objectives:\n1) To make known the Catholic faith before all the world,\n2) To invoke the healing power of the Holy Spirit to rally the Family of God to support the people and clergy of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles,\n3) To demonstrate obedience and fidelity to the wishes of the Popes,\n4) To entreat the blessing of God upon our City, County, and Archdiocese of Los Angeles, and\n5) To foster interreligious and ecumenical outreach to all members of the multicultural community of Los Angeles.\n\nThe Foundation seeks to educate and evangelize the public regarding Our Lady of the Angels, the Catholic heritage of Los Angeles, as well as foster devotion to the Archangels and Guardian Angels. By doing so, the Foundation hopes to foster a more perfect life for its members, deepening their bond to Christ and the Church through Mary, the Mother of God.\nTo further that end, the Foundation’s members contribute their time, talent, and treasure to organization of an annual Procession, Mass, and Feast in honor of the Blessed Virgin Mary on the Saturday nearest September 4, the Feast of Our Lady of the Angels and the anniversary of the founding of the City of Los Angeles, in the absence of any current comparable observance.\n\nAccording to the Catholic Church’s \"Directory on Popular Piety and the Liturgy\", “…Popular devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary is an important and universal ecclesial phenomenon. Its expressions are multifarious and its motivation very profound, deriving as it does from the People of God's faith in, and love for, Christ, the Redeemer of mankind, and from an awareness of the salvific mission that God entrusted to Mary of Nazareth, because of which she is mother not only of Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, but also of mankind in the order of grace.” The primary purpose and charism of the Queen of Angels Foundation is to foster greater devotion to Christ the King and Our Lady of the Angels in hopes of enriching the spiritual lives and deepening the faith of Catholics everywhere. The Foundation's main activity is an annual procession, Mass, and feast held on the Saturday nearest 4 September which is the Feast of Our Lady of the Angels as well as the anniversary of the founding of the City of Los Angeles.\n\nThe Queen of Angels Foundation particular charism of Marian devotion is in keeping with the official teaching of the Roman Catholic Church on the Blessed Virgin Mary.\n\nProcessions have historically played a significant role in the liturgical and spiritual life of Christians throughout the world. In every culture, public anniversaries, triumphant heroes, religious festivals, and innumerable other events have been marked by parades of local leadership and activists — and participated in by the viewers. In this way, the entire community is able to reaffirm its values and traditions, while inspiring onlookers with a sense of purpose.\n\nAlthough the first Christian processions took place firmly within the context of the Liturgy (Introit, Offertory, and Gospel), they soon moved out-of-doors. The type of prayer called “litany” today was expressly designed for these functions, wherein the Church would offer prayers for all degrees of folk within both Church and State, invoking the intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary and various saints. In periods of plague or famine, processions bearing saints’ relics would be held, begging Heaven for an end to the calamity. The Rituale Romanum (the latest edition of which is called in English simply “The Rites”) gives extensive instructions regarding processions. They are distinguished as “Ordinary Processions”: for feast days, such as Candlemas, Palm Sunday, Holy Week, Rogation Days, Corpus Christi, and other feasts as dictated by local custom; as well as for various “Extraordinary Processions”.\n\nPrior to the Protestant Reformation, this “culture of processions” was universal in the Church, both East and West. But the first Protestants often rejected processions as “Popish” idolatry and superstition . So while in traditionally Catholic parts of Europe, Latin America, and certain parts of Asia and Africa, the old customs hold forth (and are often major tourist draws to localities that still have them), they died out in such Protestant regions as Scotland and England, and were forbidden in Ireland by the British authorities. In time, Catholics in those lands — and the countries overseas where they settled, forgot the old ways. Where processions were required by the Missal, as at Candlemas, Palm Sunday, and Corpus Christi, they were held in the churchyard or even restricted to marching around the interior of the Church; they might even be done away with altogether.\n\nCatholic Emancipation in Protestant Europe, and the presence of ethnic Catholics in North America, led to a gradual revival of processions in some areas — but they were often considered unusual, and looked at with some suspicion by “native” Catholics, despite, for example, Pope Pius XI call for processions honoring the new Feast of Christ the King. The liturgical movement did a great deal of work expanding the use of processions prior to the Second Vatican Council. Following the Council, however, many places, even in Catholic countries, abandoned some or all of them, or at least cut them back in number or length.\nIn 2001, to correct these abuses (and many others which had afflicted popular piety since the Council), the Catholic Church's Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments issued a Directory on Popular Piety and the Liturgy. Throughout that document, the use (and revival) of processions for various Church festivals is called for, and an entire section devoted to processions alone, in which their importance for all Catholics is underlined.\n\nIn an attempt to revive the custom of religious processions, in September 2011 the Queen of Angels Foundation inaugurated an annual Grand Marian Procession in the heart of Downtown Los Angeles' historic core. This yearly procession, held on the last Saturday of August and intended to coincide with the anniversary of the founding of the City of Los Angeles, begins at the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels, where a Rosary and Mass in honour of the Blessed Virgin Mary are offered, and concludes outside of the parish of La Iglesia de Nuestra Señora Reina de los Angeles, part of the Los Angeles Plaza Historic District, better known as \"La Placita\". Subsequent years have seen the involvement and participation of numerous chivalric, fraternal, and religious orders, parishes, lay groups, political figures, as well as other religious and civic organizations.\n\nCentral to the spirituality of the Queen of Angels Foundation is devotion to Mary, Mother of Jesus. According to Catholic teaching, Mary played a unique and important role in the ministry of her son, Jesus Christ, and thus, in God’s plan of salvation for the entire world. The Queen of Angels Foundation places great importance on Marian spirituality and devotion as a means of deepening one’s understanding of and relationship with Christ. Marian prayers such as the Rosary, the Angelus, various intercessory prayers, and the devout use of holy cards are given special importance.\n\nIn addition to its many spiritual aims, the Queen of Angels Foundation also seeks to promote the revival and deeper understanding of Catholic chivalry and its role in the life of the church and the community. Many members of the Queen of Angels Foundation board of directors are also members of various chivalric orders, including Sovereign Military Order of Malta, Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem, Order of St. Gregory, Order of St. Sylvester, as well as fraternal orders such as the Knights of Peter Claver, and the Knights of Columbus.\n\nIn the Middle Ages and today, there were many who lived by the code of chivalry outside of the various orders. Some of these knightly orders date back to the days when crusaders sought to reclaim the Holy Land; others are of more recent origin but still seek to perpetuate the same spirit of service in the present day.\n\nThe Queen of Angels Foundation, in addition to fostering religious devotion, also seeks to \"celebrate the accomplishments and diversity\" of the City of Los Angeles. Through its annual Grand Marian Procession the Foundation also marks Los Angeles' official founding (on September 4, 1781) as a city named in honour of Mary, Queen of Angels (El Pueblo de Nuestra Señora de Los Ángeles). \"For approximately the first 100 years of the City’s history, citizens marked Los Angeles’ founding through processions and parades calling for God’s blessings and protection for our civic and religious leaders and inhabitants. By re-inaugurating this civic birthday celebration and ancient religious observance, we hope to honor the Southland’s history and heritage, celebrate our City’s accomplishments and diversity, and unite our multicultural community to face our common challenges.\"\nIn recognition of its efforts to engage the local community in fostering civic pride, the Los Angeles City Council officially recognized the Queen of Angels Foundation in a formal commendation awarded in August 2012.\n\nCivic leaders such as former Los Angeles mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and City Council members Tom LaBonge and Jan Perry, among others, have publicly expressed support for the work of the Queen of Angels Foundation. The Foundation has also received the support of the members of Los Angeles consular corps, with official delegations from the Croatian, Filipino, Lithuanian, Polish, Slovakian, and Spanish consulates general taking part in the 2012 Grand Marian Procession and Mass.\n\nThe corporate logo of the Queen of Angels Foundation consists of a crown with seven stars accompanied by the Latin motto, “Ave Maria, Regina Angelorum” (or “Hail Mary, Queen of the Angels\").\n\nImages of the Blessed Virgin Mary often depict her with a crown of twelve stars in reference to an allusion found in the twelfth chapter of the Apocalypse of St. John: “A great sign appeared in heaven, a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars.”\n\nThe iconography of the seven stars is intended to symbolize several important attributes of the Blessed Virgin Mary . The star itself, apart from the number of stars presented, is a traditional sign of Mary. The star figures in many of the titles of Mary, including La Madonna della Stella, Star of the New Evangelization, Star of the Sea, Star of Jacob, Morning Star, and Fixed Star, to name a few. The crown of stars depicted in the Queen of Angels Foundation logo is a Crown of Immortality, reflecting the Catholic teaching of Queenship of Mary. That there are seven stars above her crown also call to mind the key role Mary played in Salvation History. The seven stars on the Crown of Immortality of Our Lady of the Angels also signify the Seven Corporal Works of Mercy as well as the Seven Spiritual Works of Mercy, the Seven Gifts of the Holy Spirit, the Seven Virtues, the Seven Joys of Mary and the Seven Sorrows of Mary.\n\nAs a devotional society resident within the Archdiocese of Los Angeles the Queen of Angels Foundation maintains a close, cooperative relationship with the Archdiocese and strict allegiance to the Archbishop of Los Angeles and the wider Magisterium of the Roman Catholic Church. José Horacio Gómez succeeded Roger Cardinal Mahony as Archbishop of Los Angeles in March 2011. The Archbishop is assisted by six auxiliary bishops five of whom oversee a separate geographical portion of the Archdiocese known as a pastoral region. The current auxiliary bishops are Edward W. Clark, Thomas J. Curry, Alexander Salazar, Joseph V. Brennan, David G. O'Connell, and Robert E. Barron.\n\nThe Queen of Angels Foundation is governed by a volunteer Board of Directors composed of several prominent Catholic laymen and women, including several philanthropists, intellectuals, and other professionals from throughout the Los Angeles area. As a private devotional society, membership on the board of directors is by invitation only. The current Directors are Mark Anchor Albert, Esq., KM, KofC (Founding Chairman), Robert P.

At Yale University she studied under Wilfrid Sellars. Although W. Sellars left for the University of Pittsburgh midway through Millikan's doctorate, she stayed at Yale and earned her PhD in 1969. She and Paul Churchland are often considered leading proponents of \"right wing\" (i.e., individualistic) Sellarsianism.\n\nMillikan taught half-time at the University of Michigan from 1993-1996, but otherwise spent her entire career at the University of Connecticut, where she is now professor emerita. She is married to American psychologist and cognitive scientist Donald Shankweiler.\n\nShe was awarded the Jean Nicod Prize and gave the \"Jean Nicod Lectures\" in Paris in 2002. She was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2014 and received, in 2017, both the Nicholas Rescher Prize for Systematic Philosophy from the University of Pittsburgh and the Rolf Schock Prize in Logic and Philosophy.\n\nMillikan is most famous for the view which, in her 1989 paper of the same name, she refers to as \"Biosemantics\". Biosemantics is a theory about something philosophers often refer to as \"intentionality\". Intentionality is the phenomenon of things being 'about' other things, paradigm cases being thoughts and sentences. A belief of mine that you will do my chores for me, for example, is about you and about my chores. The same is true of a corresponding desire, intention or spoken or written command.\n\nIn general, the goal of a theory of intentionality is to explain the phenomenon – things being 'about' other things – in other, more informative, terms. Such a theory aims to give an account of what this 'aboutness' consists in. Just as chemistry offers the claim \"Water is H2O\" as a theory of what water consists in, so biosemantics aims for a constitutive account of intentionality. Such an account, Millikan stresses, must deal adequately with such hallmarks of mentality as error, confusion, and what looks like standing in a relation (the 'aboutness' relation) to something that doesn't exist. For example: one 'sees' the stick is bent, but realizes otherwise after pulling it from the water; the inexperienced prospector thinks he's struck it rich, but he's holding a lump of pyrite (\"fool's gold\"); the field marshal thinks about the next day's battle, the child wants to ride a unicorn, and the phrase \"the greatest prime\" is somehow 'about' a number that cannot possibly exist (there's a simple proof for this).\n\nAs the name hints, Millikan's theory explains intentionality in terms that are broadly 'biological' or teleological. Specifically, she explains intentionality using the explanatory resources of natural selection: what thoughts and sentences and desires are 'about' is ultimately elucidated by reference to what has been selected and what it has been selected for (i.e., what advantage it conferred on ancestors who possessed it). Where this selection is non-intentional, then what it is for is its 'proper function'.\n\nEqually important is what might be called the co-evolution of producer-mechanisms and consumer-mechanisms. Millikan refers to the intertwined selection histories of these mechanisms to explain the hallmarks of mentality and to offer a wide range of positions on various matters of dispute in the philosophy of mind and language.\n\nIn her article \"Naturalist Reflections on Knowledge\", Millikan defends the position that the justification of true beliefs through an explanation in accordance with evolution constitutes knowledge.\n\nThe 1993, 2005 and 2012 books are collections of papers.\n\nMillikan has also published many articles, many of which are listed and available here.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "19124677", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19124677", "title": "Sardica paschal table", "text": "Sardica paschal table\n\nThe Sardica paschal table or Sardica document is a document from a Latin manuscript of the 7th/8th century AD. It is a copy in Latin translation of the creed of the Eastern Christian bishops attending the Council of Sardica who, fearing that their deliberations would be dominated by Western bishops, met separately at Philippopolis. Appended to the creed and anathemas is a table of Paschal full moon dates, given as dates in the Julian calendar, for the years 328 to 357, together with a list of dates of 14 Nisan in the Jewish calendar, also referred to the Julian calendar, for the years 328 to 343, the year of the Council. The calendrical information contained in the document has been used by scholars in tracing the history of the computus and of the Hebrew calendar.\n\nThe Sardica paschal table is a part of Codex Verona LX(58), or, more fully, MS Verona, Biblioteca Capitolare LX(58). It was first published by Eduard Schwartz in his \"Christliche und jüdische Ostertafeln\" (Berlin, 1905), where the manuscript in which it occurs was called Codex Verona 60. The manuscript has 126 leaves of vellum measuring 27 cm by 20 cm. It is written in Latin uncial script that paleographers have dated to about AD 700. The Sardica document occurs on folios 79 verso to 80 verso. It is apparently a copy of a Christian document written at the time of the Council of Sardica (AD 343). It contains the creed and anathemas drawn up by the eastern bishops meeting at the council, followed by a list of Christian \"Passovers\", that is, Julian calendar dates of the 14th day (the Paschal full moon) of the Paschal lunar month, the Sunday following which is Easter. This table is preceded by a list of Julian calendar dates of 14 Nisan observed by the Jewish community in some eastern Mediterranean city (possibly Antioch). The Jewish dates are captioned\" Quibus supputationibus faciant Iudei pascha\". The Christian dates are captioned \"Quo numero faciamus nos Christiani\".\n\nThe dates as they stand are somewhat garbled. Schwartz proposed emendations, and these emendations have been reviewed and criticized recently by Sacha Stern of University College London.\n\nA striking feature of the Jewish dates is that, for the 16 years listed, all the Passovers are in the Julian month of March. This is clearly inconsistent with the modern Hebrew calendar. It also corroborates the complaints of 3rd and 4th-century Christian computists that some Jews held Passover before the spring equinox.\n\nThe document, as published and emended by Schwartz in 1905 here follows. The leftmost column indicates the AD year assigned by Schwartz. The second and third columns transcribe the tables found in the manuscript. In these columns, square and angle brackets indicate Schwartz's emendations. In the numerals, a square bracket emendation indicates a character or characters that Schwartz thought should be deleted, while an angle bracket emendation indicates where Schwartz thought characters should be added. A note in square brackets with the letters MS indicate that the entire preceding word is Schwartz's emendation, and the word in brackets is the original.\n\nDe pascha autem scribsimus nobis XXX annos, quoniam XXX annos fecit dominus noster in carne super terram, pascha autem facta est XXX anno XXV die Martii mensis, computatur autem primus primus annus triginta annorum scriptorum in comp<nowiki></nowiki>tationibus in quibus faciunt Iudei phascha a prima indictione que facta est sub Constantino [328], quo tempore conveni<t> magna synodus in civitate Nicaea, cum diu quaererent episcopi de phascha ut computetur. prima indictio [\"indici\" MS]a primo anno computationis, et prima indictio inputata post quintam decimam est XVI anno positus in conputatione annorum pasche. a primo [must mean \"ab undecimo\". A and IA were reversed in the original] anno computatur numerus iste usque ad XXX annum qui est primus mensis Aprilis.\n\nEt Reliqui XIIII anni, quo numero facimus nos Christiani\nSince the document clearly states that the years run \"from the first indiction that was under Constantine\" [327-328], Schwartz's assignment of the years seems valid. Sacha Stern has analyzed the Jewish dates, and found that nine of the sixteen dates coincide with the 14th day of a lunar month if the first day of the month is taken to be the day of the lunar conjunction.\n\nSacha Stern takes the Sardica document as evidence that the Jews referred to in the document (which he tentatively identifies as those of Antioch) used a computed, or partially computed, calendar with system of intercalations that kept 14 Nisan with the limits of Julian March. Since this differs from what can be known of the Jewish calendar in other cities, he concludes \"the Jewish calendar could vary significantly from one community to the next.\"\n\nThe Sardica document, if it is accurate in its report of the dates of 14 Nisan for the Jewish community in some eastern Mediterranean city, corroborates the complaints of Christian writers of the 3rd and 4th centuries AD that some Jews set 14 Nisan before the spring equinox. This was one of the chief reasons given by Christians for their attempts to develop an independent calculation to determine the date of the Easter festival—to compute, in effect, a \"Christian Nisan\", and set Easter accordingly—rather than relying on information from Jewish neighbors about when Jewish Nisan would fall. Additionally, if Schwartz's emendations are accepted, they show the dates following a pattern in which the Christian dates for Nisan 14 agree with the Jewish dates whenever the latter fall on March 21 or later. Both emended columns employ a constant epact of 11 for the difference between the Julian and lunar years: Each year's date is 11 days earlier than the preceding year's, or 19 days later if the 11-day deduction would result in a Christian date earlier than March 21, or in a Jewish date earlier than March 1.\n\n\n"}

The work was written in 1237, ten years after Dōgen's return from his time in Song Dynasty China. At this time he was practicing at the monastery he had founded four years earlier, Kōshōhōrin-ji. During this period he wrote several of his best known works such as Bendōwa, Fukan Zazengi, and Genjōkōan. However, the language and style in the \"Instructions\" are regarded as more concrete and straightforward than these other popular works. \"Instructions for the Cook\" is included as the first part of the Eihei Shingi, or \"Rules of Purity for Eihei-ji\".\n\nRenpō Niwa, a former abbot of Eihei-ji, divides the texts into five parts. The first part is the preface in which Dōgen emphasizes the importance of the work of the tenzo, or head cook. He asserts that the position is only suitable for experienced monks with a certain deep degree of understanding of zen practice. The next section describes the actual work the tenzo must carry out, as well as the attitude with which it should be undertaken. The third part includes instructions for serving, as well as an account of Dōgen's famous encounters with two monks serving as tenzo while he was visiting China. He acknowledges that these meetings had a deep and lasting impact on his understanding of Buddhism, and they thus ultimately helped shape Sōtō Zen in Japan. Next, Dōgen focuses on the need for the tenzo to act without any thought of discrimination or duality. In the last section, the discussion of the tenzo's attitude is concluded with a discussion of the Three Minds (\"Sanshin\", 三心), a set of three ideals for Zen practice.\n\nDōgen's essay makes numerous allusions to other works, especially kōans. One such reference is to a kōan attributed to Dongshan Shouchu that appears in both the Gateless Gate and the Blue Cliff Record. In it, Dongshan is asked, \"What is Buddha\"?, to which he replies, \"Three pounds of hemp\". Dōgen mentions the kōan in the opening of the essay while arguing how serious a position tenzo is, stating that Dongshan had this insight during his time serving as tenzo. While hemp may seem unrelated to the kitchen, the Zen scholars Shohaku Okumura and Taigen Dan Leighton suggest 'hemp' (麻) may be a mistranslation and that 'sesame' (胡麻) was intended, which makes more sense in the context of cooking. Dōgen mentions the kōan in order to suggest that the most simple activities, such as working with everyday ingredients, are no different from awakening when approached directly and with a clear mind.\n\nAnother kōan quoted in the work involves an encounter with the abbot Dongshan Liangjie and a tenzo at his monastery named Xuefeng Yicun. In the story, which is taken from the \"Zen en Shingi\" (\"Pure Standards of the Zen Garden\", 禅苑清規), Xuefeng is cleaning rice when Dongshan asks, \"Are you sifting the sand and removing the rice, or sifting the rice and removing the sand\"? Xuefeng responds that both are removed at the same time. Dongshan then says, \"What will the great assembly eat?\" In response to this, Xuefeng overturns the bowl. Dongshan says, \"In the future you will go and be scrutinized by someone else\". The final line references the fact that Xuefeng ultimately studied under Touzi Datong, Dongshan, and Deshan Xuanjian before finally receiving dharma transmission. According to Kōryō Shinno in an essay on the kōans of \"Tenzo Kyōkun\", Xuefeng gives his answer in order to express the nondualism of his activity. However, Dongshan follows up by reminding him that while his answer demonstrates a grasp on the absolute meaning of his activity, he is forgetting the utility value (i.e. feeding the other practitioners) and thus his apparently absolute understanding is in fact limited. Xuefeng does not grasp this and turns over the rice washing bowl in frustration.\n\nThe short text that comprises the \"Instructions for the Cook\" has been translated into English and other languages, often as a part of the \"Eihei Shingi\", or \"Rules of Purity for Eiheiji\".

{"id": "1131095", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1131095", "title": "The Sickness Unto Death", "text": "The Sickness Unto Death\n\nThe Sickness Unto Death () is a book written by Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard in 1849 under the pseudonym Anti-Climacus. A work of Christian existentialism, the book is about Kierkegaard's concept of despair, which he equates with the Christian concept of sin, particularly original sin.\n\nAnti-Climacus introduces the book with a reference to Gospel of John 11.4: \"This sickness is not unto death.\" This quotation comes from the story of Lazarus, in which Jesus raises a man from the dead. However, Anti-Climacus raises the question: would not this statement still be true even if Jesus had not raised Lazarus from the dead? While the human conception of death is the end, the Christian conception of death is merely another stop along the way of the eternal life. In this way, for the Christian, death is nothing to fear. Instead, the inability to die is what is to be feared. The true \"Sickness unto Death,\" which does not describe physical but spiritual death, which stems from not embracing one's self, is something to fear according to Anti-Climacus.\n\nThis sickness unto death is what Kierkegaard calls despair. According to Kierkegaard, an individual is \"in despair\" if he does not align himself with God or God's plan for the self. In this way, he loses his self, which Kierkegaard defines as the \"relation's relating itself to itself in the relation.\" Kierkegaard defines humanity as the tension between the \"finite and infinite\", and the \"possible and the necessary\", and is identifiable with the dialectical balancing act between these opposing features, the relation. While humans are inherently reflective and self-conscious beings, to become a true self one must not only be conscious of the self but also be conscious of being grounded in love, viz the source of the self in \"the power that created it.\" When one either denies this self or the power that creates and sustains this self, one is in despair.\n\nThere are three kinds of despair presented in the book: being unconscious in despair of having a self, not wanting in despair to be oneself, and wanting in despair to be oneself. The first of these is described as \"inauthentic despair,\" because this despair is born out of ignorance. In this state, one is unaware that one has a self separate from its finite reality. One does not realize that there is a power that created and continues to create one, and accepts finitude because one is unaware of possibility of being more inherent in selfhood. The second type of despair is refusing to accept the self outside of immediacy; only defining the self by immediate, finite terms. This is the state in which one realizes that one has a self, but wishes to lose this painful awareness by arranging one's finite life so as to make the realization unnecessary. This stage is loosely comparable to Sartre's bad faith. The third type is awareness of the self but refusal to acknowledge one's dependence on love, i.e., the power that created one. In this stage, one accepts the eternal and may or may not acknowledge love, but refuses to accept an aspect of the Self that one in reality is, that is to say, the self that one is in love. Kierkegaard identifies this type of demonic despair as the most heightened form of despair.\n\nTo not be in despair is to have reconciled the finite with the infinite, to exist in awareness of one's own self and of love's power. Specifically, Kierkegaard defines the opposite of despair as faith, which he describes by the following: \"In relating itself to itself, and in willing to be itself, the self rests transparently in the power that established it.\" People commonly ascribe the name \"God\" to the \"power that created\" the self, but Anti-Climacus's text is more subtle than this orthodox viewpoint. Kierkegaard certainly was thinking of God, but what it means to have a personal relation with God, and how God is love are the real subjects of this book. While the book is, in many ways, a phenomenology of prayer; it is just as much a phenomenology of what a Romantic-despite-himself could offer to the future of human maturity by way of a relational view of the self as grounded in creative love. \n\n\"The Sickness Unto Death\" has strong existentialist themes. For example, the concept of the finite and infinite parts of the human self translate to Heidegger's concept of 'facticity' and Sartre's concept of 'transcendence' in \"Being and Nothingness\". Kierkegaard's thesis is, of course, in other ways profoundly different from Sartre, most obviously because of Kierkegaard's belief that only religious faith can save the soul from despair. This particular brand of existentialism is often called Christian existentialism.\n\nSome have suggested that the opening of the book is an elaborate parody of the often bafflingly cryptic philosophy of Georg Wilhelm Hegel; however, some scholars, such as Gregor Malantschuk, have suggested otherwise (\"Armed Neutrality and An Open Letter\", Simon and Schuster, 1969, pp. 65–6 and n. 7 on pp. 165–6).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "50281016", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50281016", "title": "Theory of mind in animals", "text": "Theory of mind in animals\n\nTheory of mind in animals is an extension to non-human animals of the philosophical and psychological concept of theory of mind (ToM), sometimes known as mentalisation or mind-reading. It involves an inquiry into whether animals have the ability to attribute mental states (such as intention, desires, pretending, knowledge) to themselves and others, including recognition that others have mental states that are different from their own. To investigate this issue experimentally, researchers place animals in situations where their resulting behavior can be interpreted as supporting ToM or not.\n\nThe existence of theory of mind in animals is controversial. On the one hand, one hypothesis proposes that some animals have complex cognitive processes which allow them to attribute mental states to other individuals, sometimes called \"mind-reading\". A second, more parsimonious, hypothesis proposes that animals lack these skills and that they depend instead on more simple learning processes such as associative learning; or in other words, they are simply behaviour-reading.\n\nSeveral studies have been designed specifically to test whether animals possess theory of mind by using interspecific or intraspecific communication. Several taxa have been tested including primates, birds and canines. Positive results have been found; however, these are often qualified as showing only low-grade ToM, or rejected as not convincing by other researchers.\n\nThe term \"theory of mind\" was originally proposed by Premack and Woodruff in 1978. Early studies focused almost entirely on studying if chimpanzees could understand the knowledge of humans. This approach turned out not to be particularly fruitful and 20 years later, Heyes, reviewing all the extant data, observed that there had been \"no substantial progress\" in the subject area.\n\nA 2000 paper approached the issue differently by examining competitive foraging behaviour between primates of the same species (conspecifics). This led to the rather limited conclusion that \"chimpanzees know what conspecifics do and do not see\". Next, brain activity in higher primates was studied and as a result, a 2003 study of the human brain suggested that the a functioning ToM system activated three major nodes, the medial prefrontal, superior temporal sulcus, and inferior frontal: the medial prefrontal node handles the mental state of the self, that the superior temporal sulcus detects the behaviour of other animals and analyzes the goals and outcomes of this behaviour, and the inferior frontal region maintains representations of actions and goals.\n\nIn 2007, Penn and Povinelli wrote \"there is still little consensus on whether or not nonhuman animals understand anything about unobservable mental states or even what it would mean for a non-verbal animal to understand the concept of a 'mental state'.\" They went on further to suggest that ToM was \"\"any\" cognitive system, whether theory-like or not, that predicts or explains the behaviour of another agent by postulating that unobservable inner states particular to the cognitive perspective of that agent causally modulate that agent's behaviour\".\n\nIn 2010, an article in \"Scientific American\" acknowledged that dogs are considerably better at using social direction cues (e.g. pointing by humans) than are chimpanzees. In the same year, Towner wrote, \"the issue may have evolved beyond whether or not there is theory of mind in non-human primates to a more sophisticated appreciation that the concept of mind has many facets and some of these may exist in non-human primates while others may not.\" Horowitz, working with dogs, agreed with this and suggested that her recent results and previous findings called for the introduction of an intermediate stage of ability, a rudimentary theory of mind, to describe animals' performance.\n\nIn 2013, Whiten reviewed the literature and concluded that regarding the question \"Are chimpanzees truly mentalists, like we are?\", he stated he could not offer an affirmative or negative answer. A similarly equivocal view was stated in 2014 by Brauer, who suggested that many previous experiments on ToM could be explained by the animals possessing other abilities. They went on further to make reference to several authors who suggest it is pointless to ask a \"yes or no\" question, rather, it makes more sense to ask which psychological states animals understand and to what extent. At the same time, it was suggested that a \"minimal theory of mind\" may be \"what enables those with limited cognitive resources or little conceptual sophistication, such as infants, chimpanzees, scrub-jays and human adults under load, to track others' perceptions, knowledge states and beliefs.\"\n\nIn 2015, Cecilia Heyes, Professor of Psychology at the University of Oxford, wrote about research on ToM, \"Since that time [2000], many enthusiasts have become sceptics, empirical methods have become more limited, and it is no longer clear what research on animal mindreading is trying to find\" and \"However, after some 35 years of research on mindreading in animals, there is still nothing resembling a consensus about whether \"any\" animal can ascribe \"any\" mental state\" (Heyes' emphasis). Heyes further suggested that \"In combination with the use of inanimate control stimuli, species that are unlikely to be capable of mindreading, and the 'goggles method' [see below], these approaches could restore both vigour and rigour to research on animal mindreading.\"\n\nSpecific categories of behaviour are sometimes used as evidence of animal ToM, including imitation, self-recognition, social relationships, deception, role-taking (empathy), perspective-taking, teaching and co-operation, however, this approach has been criticised. Some researchers focus on animals' understanding of intention, gaze, perspective, or knowledge, i.e. what another being has seen. Several experimental methods have been developed which are widely used or suggested as appropriate tests for nonhuman animals possessing ToM. Some studies look at communication between individuals of the same species (intraspecific) whereas others investigate behaviour between individuals of different species (interspecific).\n\nThe Knower-Guesser method has been used in many studies relating to animal ToM. Animals are tested in a two-stage procedure. At the beginning of each trial in the first discrimination training stage, an animal is in a room with two humans. One human, designated the \"Guesser,\" leaves the room, and the other, the \"Knower,\" baits one of several containers. The containers are screened so that the animal can see who does the baiting, but not where the food has been placed. After baiting, the Guesser returns to the room, the screen is removed, and each human points directly at a container. The Knower points at the baited container, and the Guesser at one of the other three, chosen at random. The animal is allowed to search one container and to keep the food if it is found.\n\nThe competitive feeding paradigm approach is considered by some as evidence that animals have some understanding of the relationship between \"seeing\" and \"knowing\".\n\nAt the beginning of each trial in the paradigm, a subordinate animal (the individual thought to be doing the mind-reading) and a dominant animal are kept on opposite sides of a test arena which contains two visual barriers. In all trials, a researcher enters the enclosure and places food on the subordinate's side of one of the visual barriers (one baiting event), and in some trials the researcher re-enters the enclosure several seconds later and moves the food to the subordinate's side of the other visual barrier (second baiting event). The door to the subordinate's cage is open during any baiting by the researcher. The conditions vary according to whether the dominant's door is open or closed during the baiting events, and therefore whether the subordinate individual can see the dominant. After baiting, both of the animals are released into the test arena, with the subordinate being released several seconds before the dominant. If the animals possess ToM, it is expected that subordinates are more likely to gain the food, and more likely to approach the food under several circumstances: (1) When the dominant's door is closed during trials with a single baiting event; (2) when the dominant's door is open during a first baiting event but closed during a second; (3) in single baiting event trials with the dominant's door open, subordinates are more likely to get the food when they compete at the end of the trial with a dominant individual who did not see the baiting.\n\nIn one suggested protocol, chimpanzees are given first-hand experience of wearing two mirrored visors. One of the visors is transparent whereas the other is not. The visors themselves are of markedly different colours or shapes. During the subsequent test session, the chimpanzees are given the opportunity to use their species-typical begging behaviour to request food from one of the two humans, one wearing the transparent visor and the other wearing the opaque. If chimpanzees possess ToM, it would be expected they would beg more often from the human wearing the transparent visor.\n\nA method used to test ToM in human children has been adapted for testing non-human animals. The basis of the test is to track the gaze of the animal. One human hides an object in view of a second human who then leaves the room. The object is then removed. The second human returns whereupon they will mistakenly look for the object where they last saw it. If the animal stares first and longest at the location where the human last saw the object, this suggests they expect him to believe it is still hidden in that place.\n\nMany ToM studies have used nonhuman primates (NHPs). One study that examined the understanding of intention in orangutans (\"Pongo pygmaeus\"), chimpanzees (\"Pan troglodytes\") and children showed that all three species understood the difference between accidental and intentional acts.\n\nThere is controversy over the interpretation of evidence purporting to show ToM in chimpanzees.\n\nWilliam Field and Sue Savage-Rumbaugh have no doubt that bonobos have evolved ToM and cite their communications with a captive bonobo (\"Pan paniscus\"), Kanzi, as evidence.\n\nHowever, empirical studies show that chimpanzees are unable to follow a human's gaze, and are unable to use other human-eye information. Attempts to use the \"Goggles Method\" (see above) on highly human-enculturated chimpanzees failed to demonstrate they possess ToM.\n\nIn contrast, chimpanzees use the gaze of other chimpanzees to gain information about whether food is accessible. Subordinate chimpanzees are able to use the knowledge state of dominant chimpanzees to determine which container has hidden food.\n\nIf chimpanzees can see two opaque boards on a table and are expecting to find food, they do not choose a board lying flat because if food was under there, it would not be lying flat. Rather, they choose a slanted board, presumably inferring that food underneath is causing the slant. Chimpanzees appear able to know that other chimpanzees in the same situation make a similar inference. In a foraging game, when their competitor had chosen before them, chimpanzees avoided the slanted board on the assumption that the competitor had already chosen it. In a similar study, chimps were provided with a preference box with two compartments, one containing a picture of food, the other containing a picture of nothing (the pictures had no causal relation to the contents). In a foraging competition game, chimpanzees avoided the chamber with the picture of food when their competitor had chosen one of the chambers before them. The authors suggested this was presumably on the assumption that the competitor shared their own preference for it and had already chosen it.\n\nOne study tested another sensory mode of ToM. In a food competition, a human sat inside a booth with one piece of food to their left and one to their right. The food could be withdrawn from the competing chimpanzee's reach when necessary. In the first experiment, the chimpanzee could approach either side of the booth unseen by the human, but then had to reach through either a transparent or opaque tube to get the food. In a second experiment, both were transparent and the human was looking away, but one of the tubes made a loud rattle when it was opened. Chimpanzees reached through the opaque tube in the first experiment and the silent tube in the second. The chimpanzees successfully concealed their food-stealing from their human competitor in both cases.\n\nChimpanzees have passed the False Belief Test (see above) involving anticipating the gaze of humans when objects have been removed.\n\nIn one approach testing monkeys, rhesus macaques (\"Macaca mulatta\") are able to \"steal\" a contested grape from one of two human competitors. In six experiments, the macaques selectively stole the grape from a human who was incapable of seeing the grape, rather than from the human who was visually aware. The authors suggest that rhesus macaques possess an essential component of ToM: the ability to deduce what others perceive on the basis of where they are looking. Similarly, free ranging rhesus macaques preferentially choose to steal food items from locations where they can be less easily observed by humans, or where they will make less noise.\n\nA comparative psychology approach tested six species of captive NHPs (three species of great apes: orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees, and three species of old-world monkeys: lion-tailed macaques (\"Macaca silenus\"), rhesus macaques and collared mangabeys (\"Cercocebus torquatus\")) in a \"hide and seek\" game in which the NHPs played against a human opponent. In each trial, the NHP has to infer where food has been hidden (either in their right or left hand) by the human opponent. In general, the NHPs failed the test (whereas humans did not), but surprisingly, performances between the NHP species did not reveal any inter-species differences. The authors also reported that at least one individual of each of the species showed (weak) evidence of ToM.\n\nIn a multi-species study, it was shown that chimpanzees, bonobos and orangutans passed the False Belief Test (see above).\n\nIn 2009, a summary of the ToM research, particularly emphasising an extensive comparison of humans, chimpanzees and orang-utans, concluded that great apes do not exhibit understanding of human referential intentions expressed in communicative gestures, such as pointing.\n\nGrey parrots (\"Psittacus erithacus\") have demonstrated high levels of intelligence. Irene Pepperberg did experiments with these and her most accomplished parrot, Alex, demonstrated behaviour which seemed to manipulate the trainer, possibly indicating theory of mind.\n\nRavens are members of the corvidae family and are widely regarded as having complex cognitive abilities.\n\nFood-storing ravens cache (hoard) their food and pilfer (steal) from other ravens' caches. They protect their caches from being pilfered by conspecifics using aggression, dominance and re-caching. Potential pilferers rarely approach caches until the storing birds have left the cache vicinity. When storers are experimentally prevented from leaving the vicinity of the cache, pilferers first search at places other than the cache sites. When ravens (\"Corvus corax\") witness a conspecific making caches, to pilfer those caches they (1) delay approaching the cache only when in the presence of the storer, and (2) quickly engage in searching away from the caches when together with dominant storers. These behaviours raise the possibility that ravens are capable of withholding their intentions, and also providing false information to avoid provoking the storer's aggression to protect its cache. Ravens adjust their pilfering behaviour according to when the storers are likely to defend the caches. This supports the suggestion that they are deceptively manipulating the other's behaviour. Other studies indicate that ravens recall whom was watching them during caching, but also know the effects of visual barriers on what competitors can and can not see, and how this affects their pilfering.\n\nRavens have been tested for their understanding of \"seeing\" as a mental state in other ravens. It appears they take into account the visual access of other ravens, even when they cannot see the other raven.\n\nIn one study, ravens were tested in two rooms separated by a wooden wall. The wall had two functional windows that could be closed with covers; each cover had a peephole drilled into it. In the next familiarization step, the ravens are trained to use a peephole to observe and pilfer human-made caches in the adjacent room. Under test conditions, there was no other raven present in the adjacent room, however, a hidden loudspeaker played a series of sounds recorded from a competitor raven. The storing raven generalized from their own experience when using the peephole to pilfer the human-made caches and predicted that the audible (raven) competitors could potentially see their caches through the peep-hole and took appropriate action, i.e. the storing ravens finished their caches more quickly and they returned to improve their caches less often. The researchers pointed out that this represented \"seeing\" in a way that cannot be reduced to the tracking of gaze cues – a criticism leveled at many other studies of ToM. The researchers further suggested that their findings could be considered in terms of the \"minimal\" (as opposed to \"full-blown\") ToM recently suggested.\n\nUsing the Knower-Guesser approach, ravens observing a human hiding food are capable of predicting the behaviour of bystander ravens that had been visible at both, none or just one of two baiting events. The visual field of the competitors was manipulated independently of the view of the test-raven. The findings indicate that ravens not only remember whom they have seen at caching but they also take into account that the other raven's view was blocked.\n\nScrub jays are also corvids. Western scrub jays (\"Aphelocoma californica\") both cache food and pilfer other scrub jays' caches. They use a range of tactics to minimise the possibility that their own caches will be pilfered. One of these tactics is to remember which individual scrub jay watched them during particular caching events and adjust their re-caching behaviour accordingly. One study with particularly interesting results found that only scrub jays which had themselves pilfered would re-cache when they had been observed making the initial cache. This has been interpreted as the re-caching bird projecting its own experiences of pilfering intent onto those of another potential pilferer, and taking appropriate action. Another tactic used by scrub jays is if they are observed caching, they re-cache their food when they are subsequently in private. In a computer modeling study using \"virtual birds\", it was suggested that re-caching is not motivated by a deliberate effort to protect specific caches from pilfering, but by a general motivation to simply cache more. This motivation is brought on by stress, which is affected by the presence and dominance of onlookers, and by unsuccessful recovery attempts.\n\nDomestic dogs (\"Canis familiaris\") show an impressive ability to use the behaviour of humans to find food and toys using behaviours such as pointing and gazing. The performance of dogs in these studies is superior to that of NHPs, however, some have stated categorically that dogs do not possess a human-like ToM.\n\nThe Guesser-Knower approach has been used with ToM studies in dogs. In one study, each of two toys was placed on the dog's side of two barriers, one opaque and one transparent. In experimental conditions, a human sat on the opposite side of the barriers, such that they could see only the toy behind the transparent barrier. The human then told the dog to 'Fetch' without indicating either toy in any way. In a control, the human sat on the opposite side but with their back turned so that they could see neither toy. In a second control, the human sat on the same side as the dog such that they could see both toys. When the toys were differentiable, dogs approached the toy behind the transparent barrier in experimental as compared to \"back-turned\" and \"same-side\" condition. Dogs did not differentiate between the two control conditions. The authors suggested that, even in the absence of overt behavioural cues, dogs are sensitive to others' visual access, even if that differs from their own. Similarly, dogs preferentially use the behaviour of the human Knower to indicate the location of food. This is unrelated to the sex or age of the dog. In another study, 14 of 15 dogs preferred the location indicated by the Knower on the first trial, whereas chimpanzees require approximately 100 trials to reliably exhibit the preference.\n\nHuman infants (10 months old) continue to search for hidden objects at their initial hiding place, even after observing them being hidden at another location. This perseverance of searching errors is at least partly contributed to by behavioural cues from the experimenter. Domestic dogs also commit more search errors in communicative trials than in non-communicative or non-social hiding trials. However, human-encultured wolves (\"Canis lupus\") do not show this context-dependent perseverance in searching. This common sensitivity to human communication behaviour may arise from convergent evolution.\n\nDogs which have been forbidden to take food are more likely to steal the food if a human observer has their back turned or eyes closed than when the human is looking at them. Dogs are also more likely to beg for food from an observer whose eyes are visible compared to an observer whose eyes are covered by a blindfold.\n\nIn a study of the way that dogs interact, play signals were sent almost exclusively to forward-facing partners. In contrast, attention-getting behaviors were used most often when the other dog was facing away, and before signaling an interest to play. Furthermore, the type of attention-getting behaviour matched the inattentiveness of the playmate. Stronger attention-getting behaviours were used when a playmate was looking away or distracted, less forceful ones when the partner was facing forward or laterally,\n\nAn experiment at the University of Bristol found that one out of ten pigs was possibly able to understand what other pigs can see. That pig observed another pig which had view of a maze in which food was being hidden, and trailed that pig through the maze to the food. The other pigs involved in the experiment did not.\n\nA 2006 study found that goats exhibited intricate social behaviours indicative of high-level cognitive processes, particularly in competitive situations. The study included an experiment in which a subordinate animal was allowed to choose between food that a dominant animal could also see and food that it could not; those who were subject to aggressive behaviour selected the food that the dominant animal could not see, suggesting that they are able to perceive a threat based on being within the dominant animal's view – in other words, visual perspective taking.\n\n"}

He wrote after David F. Swenson and Walter Lowrie had begun translating some of Kierkegaard's works into English, both also hoping to attract Christian readers. Croxall translated \"Søren Kierkegaard\", by Johannes Edouard Hohlenberg, 1954. He studied Søren Kierkegaard's writings for over twenty years and translated \"Johannes Climacus\" written in 1843-1844 by Kierkegaard but never published and provided his own assessment. He related Kierkegaard's works to the scriptures in his books \"Meditations\" and \"Kierkegaard Studies\", where he wrote: “Kierkegaard is in the air these days. He has not yet, so far as I know, become on the air, but that doubtless will come, for he is constantly quoted and discussed (discussed, I fear, more than read). What then is all the fuss about, and what is his distinctive teaching? Now, any lover of Kierkegaard (and such I most certainly am) longs to answer such a question. He has found in Kierkegaard’s teaching a new and stimulating body of thought, which to him is like a pearl of great price, worth anything to possess. But since the pearl is spiritual treasure, not material, that treasure must be shared if its value is not to diminish. Hence I desire to share the treasure.” \"Studies\" 1948 p. 11.\n\nCroxall provides the reader with a “wealth of beauty, fragrance, and sustenance” in his \"Meditations\". Most of the meditations came from the Journals and Papers of Søren Kierkegaard from Croxall’s own translations. He recognized, in 1944, the need for better translations of Kierkegaard’s works. His translation, he said, “is “new”; I mean in its form and presentation. Søren Kierkegaard is a deep philosopher, but he is first and foremost a Christian; a penetrating student and exponent of the Scriptures; and above all, a man of prayer and meditation, who, as he himself confesses, spent every day in the quiet of his chamber with God.” \"Meditations\" 1955 p. 1.\n\nCroxall is one of a number of Christian authors who argued that Kierkegaard's work is Christian to the core, that \"his interest is religious or exclusively Christian.\"\n\n\"Kierkegaard is Christian. Some 'existentialists' – Berdyaev, Dostoevsky, Unamuno, \"Maritain, Chestov, Marcel – concur in being, in varying degrees, Christian too. Many, however-Bataille, Sartre, Camus, Jaspers, Heidegger are atheistic, so that atheism and existentialism are sometimes thought synonymous. These writers 'extract from religion its most useful attributes and re-secularize them, making a ‘corner’ in thought.'\" Studies 1948 p. 60.\n\nCroxall translated Kierkegaard’s works in the aftermath of World War II. He says, again from \"Kierkegaard Studies\", “Need I say that our age, with its industrial “massification”, its twin tyrannies of newspaper and ballot-box (present to-day just as they were in Kierkegaard’s time: unknown to Kierkegaard, those of the radio and the cinema), its trade unions, federations, combines; its feverish enslavement to fashion; its indecision and bewilderment about the meaning and purpose of life; its pursuit of pleasure and of the false gods of aestheticism, superstition, and selfishness, its belief that it has “gone farther” than Christianity, when really it has scarcely even approached Christianity (Heaven turn us from continuing along the path which has disastrously taken us “farther”!)-all this and much more shows that we are in as dire need as were his contemporaries, of Kierkegaard’s great doctrine of the Individual.” \"Studies\" 1948 p. 15.\n\nSome of his references include:\n\"Kierkegaard: The Prophet of the Now\", by T.S. Gregory, November 21, 1946; \"The Prophet of the Absolute\", by H.V. Martin; \"Lectures on the Religious thought of Kierkegaard\" (Lecture IV), Geismar, Augsburg Publishing House; \"Philosophy\", July 1941, by Professor Dorothy Emmet; \"Existentialism: Disintegration of Man's Soul\", Guido De Ruggiero, 1948, Social Sciences Publishers Inc.

The book, published in 1710, introduced the term \"theodicy\", and its optimistic approach to the problem of evil is thought to have inspired Voltaire's \"Candide\" (albeit satirically). Much of the work consists of a response to the ideas of the French philosopher Pierre Bayle, with whom Leibniz carried on a debate for many years.\n\n\"Théodicée\" was the only book Leibniz published during his lifetime; his other book, \"New Essays on Human Understanding\", was published only after his death, in 1765.\n\nIn various works, including his famous \"Historical and Critical Dictionary\" (1697), Pierre Bayle had argued that there is no defensible rational solution to the problem of why God permits evil. More specifically, Bayle had argued that powerful philosophical arguments can be given against a number of orthodox Christian teachings, including the goodness, justice, and freedom of God. Leibniz responds to Bayle's arguments in detail, arguing that it can be proved that God is an infinitely perfect being, and that such a being must have created a world that has the greatest possible balance of good over evil (\"the best of all possible worlds\"). Leibniz distinguishes three forms of evil: moral, physical, and metaphysical. Moral evil is sin, physical evil is pain, and metaphysical evil is limitation. God permits moral and physical evil for the sake of greater goods, and metaphysical evil (i.e., limitation) is unavoidable since any created universe must necessarily fall short of God's absolute perfection. Human free will is consistent with God's foreknowledge, because even though all events in the universe are foreseen and pre-determined, they are not necessitated (i. e., logically necessary), and only if human choices were necessitated would free will be an illusion. Against Bayle's claims (derived from Augustine) that it is unjust for God to damn unbaptized infants or adult non-Christians who had lived as well as they could, Leibniz denies that Christian teaching supports such claims. Against Bayle's claim that God cannot be free since he cannot fail to choose the best, Leibniz argues that such \"moral necessity\" is consistent with divine freedom. God would lack freedom only if there are no possible worlds in which less than maximal goodness exists, which is not the case, Leibniz argues.\n"}

{"id": "30153241", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30153241", "title": "Zen", "text": "Zen\n\nZen (; ) is a school of Mahayana Buddhism that originated in China during the Tang dynasty as Chan Buddhism. It was strongly influenced by Taoism and developed as a distinct school of Chinese Buddhism. From China, Chan Buddhism spread south to Vietnam which became Vietnamese Thiền, northeast to Korea and east to Japan, where it became known as Seon Buddhism and Japanese Zen, respectively.\n\nThe term Zen is derived from the Japanese pronunciation of the Middle Chinese word 禪 (Chan) which traces its roots to the Indian practice of Dhyāna (\"meditation\"). Zen emphasizes rigorous self-control, meditation-practice, insight into Buddha-nature, and the personal expression of this insight in daily life, especially for the benefit of others. As such, it de-emphasizes mere knowledge of sutras and doctrine and favors direct understanding through zazen and interaction with an accomplished teacher.\n\nThe teachings of Zen include various sources of Mahayana thought, especially Yogachara, the Tathāgatagarbha sūtras and the Huayan school, with their emphasis on Buddha-nature, totality, and the Bodhisattva-ideal. The Prajñāpāramitā literature and, to a lesser extent, Madhyamaka have also been influential in the shaping of the \"paradoxical language\" of the Zen-tradition.\n\nThe word \"Zen\" is derived from the Japanese pronunciation of the Middle Chinese word 禪 () (pinyin: \"Chán\"), which in turn is derived from the Sanskrit word \"dhyāna\" (ध्यान ), which can be approximately translated as \"absorption\" or \"meditative state\".\n\nCentral to Zen is the practice of dhyana or meditation.\n\nThe practice of meditation entered into Chinese through the translations of An Shigao (fl. c. 148–180 CE), and Kumārajīva (334–413 CE), who both translated Dhyāna sutras, which were influential early meditation texts mostly based on the Yogacara meditation teachings of the Sarvāstivāda school of Kashmir circa 1st-4th centuries CE.\n\nWhile \"dhyana\" in a strict sense refers to the four \"dhyanas\", in Chinese Buddhism \"dhyāna\" may refer to various kinds of meditation techniques and their preparatory practices, which are necessary to practice \"dhyana\". The five main types of meditation in the \"Dhyana sutras\" are anapanasati (mindfulness of breathing); paṭikūlamanasikāra meditation, mindfulness of the impurities of the body; loving-kindness maitrī meditation; the contemplation on the twelve links of pratītyasamutpāda; and the contemplation on the Buddha’s thirty-two Characteristics.\n\nDuring sitting meditation, practitioners usually assume a position such as the lotus position, half-lotus, Burmese, or yoga postures, using the dhyāna mudrā. To regulate the mind, awareness is directed towards counting or watching the breath or by bringing that awareness to the energy center below the navel (see also ānāpānasati). Often, a square or round cushion placed on a padded mat is used to sit on; in some other cases, a chair may be used. This practice may simply be called sitting dhyāna, which is \"zuòchán\" (坐禅) in Chinese, and \"zazen\" (坐禅) in Japanese, \"jwaseon\" (坐禅) in Korean.\n\nIn the Sōtō school of Zen, meditation with no objects, anchors, or content, is the primary form of practice. The meditator strives to be aware of the stream of thoughts, allowing them to arise and pass away without interference. Considerable textual, philosophical, and phenomenological justification of this practice can be found throughout Dōgen's \"Shōbōgenzō\", as for example in the \"Principles of Zazen\" and the \"Universally Recommended Instructions for Zazen\". In the Japanese language, this practice is called \"Shikantaza\".\n\nAccording to Charles Luk, in the earliest traditions of Chán, there was no fixed method or formula for teaching meditation, and all instructions were simply heuristic methods, to point to the true nature of the mind, also known as \"Buddha-nature\". According to Luk, this method is referred to as the \"Mind Dharma\", and exemplified in the story of Śākyamuni Buddha holding up a flower silently, and Mahākāśyapa smiling as he understood. A traditional formula of this is, \"Chán points directly to the human mind, to enable people to see their true nature and become buddhas.\"\n\nAt the beginning of the Sòng dynasty, practice with the kōan method became popular, whereas others practiced \"silent illumination.\" This became the source of some differences in practice between the Línjì and Cáodòng schools.\n\nA kōan, literally \"public case\", is a story or dialogue, describing an interaction between a Zen master and a student. These anecdotes give a demonstration of the master's insight. Koans emphasize the non-conceptional insight that the Buddhist teachings are pointing to. Koans can be used to provoke the \"great doubt\" and test a student's progress in Zen practice.\n\nKōan-inquiry may be practiced during zazen (sitting meditation), kinhin (walking meditation), and throughout all the activities of daily life. Kōan practice is particularly emphasized by the Japanese Rinzai school, but it also occurs in other schools or branches of Zen depending on the teaching line.\n\nThe Zen student's mastery of a given kōan is presented to the teacher in a private interview (referred to in Japanese as \"dokusan\" (独参), \"daisan\" (代参), or \"sanzen\" (参禅)). While there is no unique answer to a kōan, practitioners are expected to demonstrate their understanding of the kōan and of Zen through their responses. The teacher may approve or disapprove of the answer and guide the student in the right direction. The interaction with a Zen teacher is central in Zen, but makes Zen practice also vulnerable to misunderstanding and exploitation.\n\nIntensive group meditation may be practiced occasionally in some temples. In the Japanese language, this practice is called \"Sesshin\". While the daily routine may require monks to meditate for several hours each day, during the intensive period they devote themselves almost exclusively to the practice of sitting meditation. The numerous 30–50 minute long meditation periods are interwoven with rest breaks, meals, and short periods of work that are performed with the same mindfulness; nightly sleep is kept to seven hours or less. In modern Buddhist practice in Japan, Taiwan, and the West, lay students often attend these intensive practice sessions, which are typically 1, 3, 5, or 7 days in length. These are held at many Zen centers, especially in commemoration of the Buddha's attainment of \"Anuttarā Samyaksaṃbodhi\". One distinctive aspect of Zen meditation in groups is the use of a kyosaku, a flat, wooden slat used to strike meditators with the intention of keeping them focused and awake.\n\nA practice in many Zen monasteries and centers is a daily liturgy service. Practitioners chant major sutras such as the \"Heart Sutra\", chapter 25 of the \"Lotus Sutra\" (often called the \"Avalokiteśvara Sutra\"), \"Song of the Precious Mirror Samadhi\", the Nīlakaṇṭha Dhāraṇī, and other minor mantras.\n\nThe butsudan is the altar in a monastery where offerings are made to the images of the Buddha or bodhisattvas. The same term is also used in Japanese homes for the altar where one prays to and communicates with deceased family members. As such, reciting liturgy in Zen can be seen as a means to connect with the Bodhisattvas of the past. Liturgy is often used during funerals, memorials, and other special events as means to invoke the aid of supernatural powers.\n\nChanting usually centers on major bodhisattvas like Avalokiteśvara (see Guanyin) and Manjushri. According to Mahayana Buddhism, bodhisattvas are beings who have taken vows to remain in saṃsāra to help all beings achieve liberation from it. Since the Zen practitioner's aim is to walk the bodhisattva path, chanting can be used as a means to connect with these beings and realize this ideal within oneself.\n\nThough in western Zen the emphasis is on zen-meditation, and the application of Zen-teachings in daily life, Japanese Zen also serves a function in public religion. Funerals play an important role as a point of contact between the monks and the laity. Statistics published by the Sōtō school state that 80 percent of Sōtō laymen visit their temple only for reasons having to do with funerals and death. Seventeen percent visit for spiritual reasons and 3 percent visit a Zen priest at a time of personal trouble or crisis.\n\nThough Zen-narrative states that it is a \"special transmission outside scriptures\" which \"did not stand upon words\", Zen does have a rich doctrinal background, which is firmly grounded in the Buddhist tradition. It was thoroughly influenced by the Chinese understanding of Yogacara and the Buddha-nature doctrine, Zen integrates both Yogacara and Madhyamaka and the influence of Madhyamaka can be discerned in the stress on non-conceptual insight and the paradoxical language of the koans. Most essential are \"the most fundamental teaching that we are already originally enlightened\", and the Bodhisattva ideal, which supplements insight with Karuṇā, compassion with all sentient beings.\n\nTo point out 'essential Zen-teachings' is almost impossible, given the variety of schools, the extended history of 1500 years, and the emphasis on suchness, reality just-as-it-is, which has to be expressed in daily life, not in words. But common to most schools and teachings is this emphasis on suchness and Buddha-nature, the Bodhisattva-ideal, and the priority of zazen.\n\nZen teachings can be likened to \"the finger pointing at the moon\". Zen teachings point to the moon, awakening, \"a realization of the unimpeded interpenetration of the dharmadhatu\". But the Zen-tradition also warns against taking its teachings, the pointing finger, to be this insight itself.\n\nThe various traditions lay various emphases in their teachings and practices:\n\nThe Rinzai school is the Japanese lineage of the Chinese Linji school, which was founded during the Tang dynasty by Linji Yixuan.The Rinzai school emphasizes kensho, insight into one's true nature. This is followed by so-called post-satori practice, further practice to attain Buddhahood.\n\nOther Zen-teachers have also expressed sudden insight followed by gradual cultivation. Jinul, a 12th-century Korean Seon master, followed Zongmi, and also emphasized that insight into our true nature is sudden, but is to be followed by practice to ripen the insight and attain full buddhahood. This is also the standpoint of the contemporary Sanbo Kyodan, according to whom kenshō is at the start of the path to full enlightenment.\n\nTo attain this primary insight and to deepen it, zazen and kōan-study is deemed essential. This trajectory of initial insight followed by a gradual deepening and ripening is expressed by Linji in his Three Mysterious Gates and Hakuin Ekaku's \"Four Ways of Knowing\". Another example of depiction of stages on the path are the Ten Bulls, which detail the steps on the path.\n\nSōtō is the Japanese line of the Chinese Caodong school, which was founded during the Tang Dynasty by Dongshan Liangjie. The Sōtō-school has de-emphasized kōans since Gentō Sokuchū (circa 1800), and instead emphasized on shikantaza. Dogen, the founder of Soto in Japan, emphasized that practice and awakening cannot be separated. By practicing shikantaza, attainment and Buddhahood are already being expressed. For Dogen, zazen, or shikantaza, is the essence of Buddhist practice. Gradual cultivation was also recognized by Dongshan Liangjie.\n\nContrary to the popular image, literature does play a role in the Zen-training. Zen is deeply rooted in the teachings and doctrines of Mahāyāna Buddhism. \"Unsui\", Zen-monks, \"are expected to become familiar with the classics of the Zen canon\". A review of the early historical documents and literature of early Zen masters clearly reveals that they were well versed in numerous Mahāyāna Buddhist sūtras, including Madhyamaka. Especially the Lotus Sutra played a large role in the development of East Asian Buddhism, including Zen.\n\nNevertheless, Zen is often pictured as anti-intellectual. This picture of Zen emerged during the Song Dynasty (960–1297), when Chán became the dominant form of Buddhism in China, and gained great popularity among the educated and literary classes of Chinese society. The use of koans, which are highly stylized literary texts, reflects this popularity among the higher classes. The famous saying \"do not establish words and letters\", attributed in this period to Bodhidharma,\nWhat the Zen tradition emphasizes is that the enlightenment of the Buddha came not through conceptualization but rather through direct insight. But direct insight has to be supported by study and understanding (\"hori\") of the Buddhist teachings and texts. Intellectual understanding without practice is called \"yako-zen\", \"wild fox Zen\", but \"one who has only experience without intellectual understanding is a \"zen temma\", 'Zen devil.\n\nThe early Buddhist schools in China were each based on a specific sutra. At the beginning of the Tang Dynasty, by the time of the Fifth Patriarch Hongren (601–674), the Zen school became established as a separate school of Buddhism. It had to develop a doctrinal tradition of its own to ascertain its position and to ground its teachings in a specific sutra. Various sutras were used for this even before the time of Hongren: the Śrīmālādevī Sūtra (Huike), Awakening of Faith (Daoxin), the Lankavatara Sutra (East Mountain School), the Diamond Sutra (Shenhui), and the Platform Sutra. None of these sutras were decisive though, since the school drew inspiration from a variety of sources. Subsequently, the Zen tradition produced a rich corpus of written literature which has become a part of its practice and teaching. Other influential sutras are the Vimalakirti Sutra, Avatamsaka Sutra, the Shurangama Sutra, and the Mahaparinirvana Sutra.\n\nThe Zen-tradition developed a rich textual tradition, based on the interpretation of the Buddhist teachings and the recorded sayings of Zen-masters. Important texts are the Platform Sutra (8th century), attributed to Huineng ; the Chán transmission records, teng-lu, such as \"The Records of the Transmission of the Lamp\" (Ching-te ch'uan-teng lu), compiled by Tao-yün and published in 1004; the \"yü-lü\" genre consisting of the recorded sayings of the masters, and the encounter dialogues; the koan-collections, such as the \"Gateless Gate\" and the \"Blue Cliff Record\".\n\nReligion is not only an individual matter, but \"also a collective endeavour\". Though individual experience and the iconoclastic picture of Zen are emphasised in the Western world, the Zen-tradition is maintained and transferred by a high degree of institutionalisation and hierarchy. In Japan, modernity has led to criticism of the formal system and the commencement of lay-oriented Zen-schools such as the Sanbo Kyodan and the Ningen Zen Kyodan. How to organize the continuity of the Zen-tradition in the West, constraining charismatic authority and the derailment it may bring on the one hand, and maintaining the legitimacy and authority by limiting the number of authorized teachers on the other hand, is a challenge for the developing Zen-communities in the West.\n\nThe Chán of the Tang Dynasty, especially that of Mazu and Linji with its emphasis on \"shock techniques\", in retrospect was seen as a golden age of Chán. This picture has gained great popularity in the West in the 20th century, especially due to the influence of D.T. Suzuki, and further popularized by Hakuun Yasutani and the Sanbo Kyodan. This picture has been challenged, and complemented, since the 1970s by modern scientific research on Zen.\n\nModern scientific research on the history of Zen discerns three main narratives concerning Zen, its history and its teachings: Traditional Zen Narrative (TZN), Buddhist Modernism (BM), Historical and Cultural Criticism (HCC). An external narrative is Nondualism, which claims Zen to be a token of a universal nondualist essence of religions.\n\nThe history of Chán in China can be divided into several periods. Zen as we know it today is the result of a long history, with many changes and contingent factors. Each period had different types of Zen, some of which remained influential while others vanished.\n\nFerguson distinguishes three periods from the 5th century into the 13th century:\n\nAlthough McRae has reservations about the division of Chán-history in phases or periods, he nevertheless distinguishes four phases in the history of Chán:\n\nNeither Ferguson nor McRae give a periodisation for Chinese Chán following the Song-dynasty, though McRae mentions \n\nBuddhist meditation was practiced in China centuries before the rise of Chán, by people such as An Shigao (c. 148–180 CE) and his school, who translated various Dhyāna sutras ((Chán-jing, 禪経, \"meditation treatises\"), which were influential early meditation texts mostly based on the Yogacara meditation teachings of the Sarvāstivāda school of Kashmir circa 1st-4th centuries CE.. The five main types of meditation in the \"Dyana sutras\" are anapanasati (mindfulness of breathing); paṭikūlamanasikāra meditation, mindfulness of the impurities of the body; loving-kindness maitrī meditation; the contemplation on the twelve links of pratītyasamutpāda; and the contemplation on the Buddha’s thirty-two Characteristics. Other important translators of meditation texts were Kumārajīva (334–413 CE), who translated \"The Sutra on the Concentration of Sitting Meditation\", amongst many other texts; and Buddhabhadra. These Chinese translations of mostly Indian Sarvāstivāda Yogacara meditation manuals were the basis for the meditation techniques of Chinese Chan.\n\nWhen Buddhism came to China from Gandhara (now Afghanistan) and India, it was initially adapted to the Chinese culture and understanding. Buddhism was exposed to Confucianist and Taoist influences. Goddard quotes D.T. Suzuki, calling Chán a \"natural evolution of Buddhism under Taoist conditions.\" Buddhism was first identified to be \"a barbarian variant of Taoism\": \nTaoist terminology was used to express Buddhist doctrines in the oldest translations of Buddhist texts, a practice termed \"ko-i\", \"matching the concepts\", while the emerging Chinese Buddhism had to compete with Taoism and Confucianism.\n\nThe first Buddhist recruits in China were Taoists. They developed high esteem for the newly introduced Buddhist meditational techniques, and blended them with Taoist meditation. Representatives of early Chinese Buddhism like Sengzhao and Tao Sheng were deeply influenced by the Taoist keystone works of Laozi and Zhuangzi. Against this background, especially the Taoist concept of \"naturalness\" was inherited by the early Chán disciples: they equated – to some extent – the ineffable Tao and Buddha-nature, and thus, rather than feeling bound to the abstract \"wisdom of the sūtras\", emphasized Buddha-nature to be found in \"everyday\" human life, just like the Tao.\n\nIn addition to Taoist ideas, also Neo-Taoist concepts were taken over in Chinese Buddhism. Concepts such as \"T’i -yung\" (Essence and Function) and \"Li-shih\" (Noumenon and Phenomenon) were first taken over by Hua-yen Buddhism, which consequently influenced Chán deeply.\n\nOne point of confusion for Chinese Buddhism was the two truths doctrine. Chinese thinking took this to refer to two \"ontological truths\": reality exists on two levels, a relative level and an absolute level. Taoists at first misunderstood sunyata to be akin to the Taoist non-being. In Madhyamaka the two truths are two \"epistemological truths\": two different ways to look at reality. Based on their understanding of the Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra the Chinese supposed that the teaching of the Buddha-nature was, as stated by that sutra, the final Buddhist teaching, and that there is an essential truth above sunyata and the two truths.\n\nTraditionally the origin of Chán in China is credited to Bodhidharma, an Iranian language speaking Central Asian monk or an Indian monk. The story of his life, and of the Six Patriarchs, was constructed during the Tang Dynasty to lend credibility to the growing Chán-school.\nBodhidharma is recorded as having come into China during the time of Southern and Northern Dynasties to teach a \"special transmission outside scriptures\" which \"did not stand upon words\". Throughout Buddhist art, Bodhidharma is depicted as a rather ill-tempered, profusely bearded and wide-eyed barbarian. He is referred as \"The Blue-Eyed Barbarian\" (碧眼胡:Bìyǎn hú) in Chinese Chan texts. Only scarce historical information is available about him but his hagiography developed when the Chan tradition grew stronger and gained prominence in the early 8th century. By this time a lineage of the six ancestral founders of Chán in China was developed. The short text \"Two Entrances and Four Acts\", written by T'an-lín (曇林; 506–574), contains teachings which are attributed to Bodhidharma. The text is known from the Dunhuang-manuscripts.\n\nThe actual origins of Chán may lie in ascetic practitioners of Buddhism, who found refuge in forests and mountains. Huike, \"a dhuta (extreme ascetic) who schooled others\" and used the Srimala Sutra, one of the Tathāgatagarbha sūtras , figures in the stories about Bodhidharma. Huike is regarded as the second Chán patriarch, appointed by Bodhidharma to succeed him. One of Huike's students, Sengcan, to whom is ascribed the Xinxin Ming, is regarded as the third patriarch.\n\nWith the fourth patriarch, Daoxin ( 580–651), Chán began to take shape as a distinct school. The link between Huike and Sengcan, and the fourth patriarch Daoxin \"is far from clear and remains tenuous\". With Daoxin and his successor, the fifth patriarch Hongren ( 601–674), there emerged a new style of teaching, which was inspired by the Chinese text Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana. A large group of students gathered at a permanent residence, and extreme ascetism became outdated. The period of Daoxin and Hongren came to be called the East Mountain Teaching, due to the location of the residence of Hongren at Huamgmei.\n\nThe term \"East Mountain Teaching\" was used by Shenxiu (神秀 606?–706), the most important successor to Hongren. By this time the group had grown into a matured congregation which became significant enough to be reckoned with by the ruling forces. In 701 Shenxiu was invited to the Imperial Court by Empress Wu, who paid him imperial reverence. This gave his school the support and the legitimation of the imperial court. The school was typified by a \"loose practice,\" aiming to make meditation accessible to a larger audience. Shenxiu used short formulas extracted from various sutras to package the teachings, a style which is also used in the Platform Sutra. Members of the \"East Mountain Teaching\" shifted the alleged scriptural basis, realizing that the \"Awwakening of Faith\" is not a sutra but a \"sastra\", commentary, and fabricated a lineage of Lankavatara Sutra masters, as being the sutra that preluded the \"Awakening of Faith\".\n\nThis growing influence, and the need to be supported by patrons, is reflected in the campaign of Shenhui (670–762) for imperial patronage. Shenhui was a successor to Hui-neng (惠能; 638–713), a minor student of Hongren. At 731 Shenhui started to propagate that Huineng was the real successor of Hongren's, instead of the then publicly recognized successor Shenxiu. A dramatic story of Huineng's life was created, as narrated in the Platform Sutra, which tells that there was a contest for the transmission of the title of patriarch. After being chosen by Hongren, the fifth patriarch, Huineng had to flee by night to Nanhua Temple in the south to avoid the wrath of Hongren's jealous senior disciples. The \"Diamond Sutra\" was incorporated into the story as being the favorite sutra of Huineng, thereby shifting the alleged textual basis of the Chán-school again. Shenhui succeeded in his campaign, and Huineng came to be regarded as the Sixth Patriarch. Shenxiu's Northern School was denigrated as \"gradual\", in opposition to the self-acclaimed \"sudden\" approach of Shenhui's Southern School. Shenhui's story was so influential that all surviving schools regard Huineng as their ancestor. \n\nThe An Lushan Rebellion (755–763) led to a loss of control by the Tang-dynasty, and changed the Chan scene again. Metropolitan Chan began to lose its status, while \"other schools were arising in out-lying areas controlled by warlords. These are the forerunners of the Chan we know today.\"\n\nThe most important of these schools is the Hongzhou school (洪州宗) of Mazu, to which also belong Shitou, Baizhang, Huangbo and Linji. This school became the archetypal expression of Zen, with its emphasis on the personal expression of insight, and its rejection of positive statements of this insight. Shitou is regarded as the Patriarch of Caodong (Jp. Sōtō), while Linji is regarded as the founder of Rinzai-Zen.\n\nDuring 845–846 Emperor Wuzong persecuted the Buddhist schools in China. This persecution was devastating for metropolitan Chan, but the Chan school of Mazu and his likes survived, and took a leading role in the Chan of the later Tang.\n\nThis surviving rural Chan developed into the Five Houses of Chán (Ch. 五家) of Zen, or five \"schools\". These were not originally regarded as \"schools\" or \"sects\", but historically they have come to be understood that way. Most Zen lineages throughout Asia and the rest of the world originally grew from or were heavily influenced by the original five houses of Zen.\n\nAfter the fall of the Tang Dynasty, China was without effective central control during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period. China was divided into several autonomous regions. Support for Buddhism was limited to a few areas. The Hua-yen and T'ient-tai schools suffered from the changing circumstances, since they had depended on imperial support. The collapse of T'ang society also deprived the aristocratic classes of wealth and influence, which meant a further drawback for Buddhism. Shenxiu's Northern School and Henshui's Southern School didn't survive the changing circumstances. Nevertheless, chán emerged as the dominant stream within Chinese Buddhism, but with various schools developing various emphases in their teachings, due to the regional orientation of the period. The Fayan school, named after Fa-yen Wen-i (885–958) became the dominant school in the southern kingdoms of Nan-T'ang (Jiangxi, Chiang-hsi) and Wuyue (Che-chiang).\n\nThe Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period was followed by the Song Dynasty, which established a strong central government. During the Song Dynasty, Chán (禪) was used by the government to strengthen its control over the country and Chán grew to become the largest sect in Chinese Buddhism. An ideal picture of the Chán of the Tang period was produced which served the legacy of this newly acquired status, and the period of the Tang Dynasty came to be regarded as the \"golden age\" of Chan. With the establishment of the Wu-shan (Gozan) system during the Southern Sung, the Chinese bureaucratic system entered into Zen temples throughout the country, and a highly organized system of temple rank and administration developed.\n\nThe Linji school became the dominant school within Chán due to support from literati and the court. Before the Song Dynasty, the Linji-school is rather obscure, and very little is known about its early history. The first mention of Linji is in the \"Zutang ji\", compiled in 952, 86 years after Linji's death. But the \"Zutang ji\" pictures the Xuefeng Yicun lineage as heir to the legacy of Mazu and the Hongzhou-school. According to Welter, the real founder of the Linji-school was Shoushan (or Baoying) Shengnian (首山省念)(926–993), a fourth generation dharma-heir of Linji. The \"Tiansheng Guangdeng lu\" (天聖廣燈錄), \"Tiansheng Era Expanded Lamp Record\", compiled by the official Li Zunxu (李遵勗)(988–1038) confirms the status of Shoushan Shengnian, but also pictures Linji as a major Chan patriarch and heir to the Mazu, displacing the prominence of the Fayan-lineage. It also established the slogan of \"a special transmission outside the teaching\", supporting the Linji-school claim of \"Chan as separate from and superior to all other Buddhist teachings\".\n\nDuring the 12th century, a clear difference between the Linji and the Caodong schools emerged. The two schools were competing for support of the literati, who became more powerful when the Song-government started to limit their influence on society. Hongzhi Zhengjue (1091–1157) of the Caodong-school emphasized silent illumination or shikantaza as a means for solitary practice, which could be undertaken by lay-followers. Dahui Zonggao (1089–1163) introduced k'an-hua practice, \"observing the word-head\", as a means of solitary practice.\n\nDuring the Song, both schools were exported to Japan where they eventually became two clearly distinguished schools or \"sects\".\n\nThis was different from China, where the Buddhist schools tended to coalesce into a syncretic Chinese Buddhist school.\n\nThe \"Yuan Dynasty\" was the empire established by Kublai Khan, the leader of Mongolian Borjigin clan, after Mongol conquered the Jin and the Southern Song dynasty in China. Chán-teachings started to be mixed with Pure Land teachings, as in the teachings of Zhongfeng Mingben (1263–1323).\n\nChán Buddhism enjoyed something of a revival in the Ming Dynasty with teachers such as Hanshan Deqing (憨山德清), who wrote and taught extensively on both Chán and Pure Land Buddhism; Miyun Yuanwu (密雲圓悟), who came to be seen posthumously as the first patriarch of the Ōbaku Zen school; as well as Yunqi Zhuhong (雲棲祩宏) and Ouyi Zhixu (蕅益智旭).\n\nChán was taught alongside Pure Land Buddhism in many Chinese Buddhist monasteries. In time much of the distinction between them was lost, and many masters taught both Chán and Pure Land.\n\nWith the downfall of the Ming Dynasty several Chinese Chán-masters fled to Japan, founding the Ōbaku school.\n\nThe Qing Dynasty was the last imperial dynasty of China.\n\nIn the beginning of the Qing Dynasty Chán was \"reinvented\", by the \"revival of beating and shouting practices\" by Miyun Yuanwu\n(1566–1642), and the publication of the \"Wudeng yantong\" (\"The strict transmission of the five Chan schools\") by Feiyin\nTongrong’s (1593–1662), a dharma heir of Miyun Yuanwu. The book placed self-proclaimed Chan monks without proper Dharma transmission in the category of \"lineage unknown\" (\"sifa weixiang\"), thereby excluding several prominent Caodong-monks.\n\nAfter further centuries of decline during the Qing Dynasty (1644–1912), Chán was revived again in the early 20th century by Hsu Yun (虛雲) (1840–1959), a well-known figure of 20th-century Chinese Buddhism. Many Chán teachers today trace their lineage back to Hsu Yun, including Sheng-yen (聖嚴) and Hsuan Hua (宣化), who have propagated Chán in the West where it has grown steadily through the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nChán was repressed in China during the 1960s in the Cultural Revolution, but subsequently has been re-asserting itself on the mainland, and has a significant following in Taiwan and Hong Kong as well as among Overseas Chinese.\n\nAccording to traditional accounts of Vietnam, in 580 an Indian monk named Vinitaruci () travelled to Vietnam after completing his studies with Sengcan, the third patriarch of Chinese Chán. This, then, would be the first appearance of Vietnamese Thiền Buddhism. Other early Vietnamese Chán schools included the Vô Ngôn Thông, which was associated with the teaching of Mazu, and the Thảo Đường, which incorporated \"nianfo\" chanting techniques; both were founded by Chinese monks.\n\nSeon was gradually transmitted into Korea during the late Silla period (7th through 9th centuries) as Korean monks of predominantly Hwaeom (華嚴) and Consciousness-only (唯識) background began to travel to China to learn the newly developing tradition. Seon received its most significant impetus and consolidation from the Goryeo monk Jinul (知訥) (1158–1210), who established a reform movement and introduced koan practice to Korea. Jinul established the Songgwangsa (松廣寺) as a new center of pure practice.\n\nZen was not introduced as a separate school until the 12th century, when Myōan Eisai traveled to China and returned to establish a Linji lineage, which eventually perished. Decades later, (1235–1308) also studied Linji teachings in China before founding the Japanese Otokan lineage, the most influential and only surviving lineage of Rinzai in Japan. In 1215, Dōgen, a younger contemporary of Eisai's, journeyed to China himself, where he became a disciple of the Caodong master Tiantong Rujing. After his return, Dōgen established the Sōtō school, the Japanese branch of Caodong.\n\nThe three traditional schools of Zen in contemporary Japan are the , , and . Of these, Sōtō is the largest, and Ōbaku the smallest, with Rinzai in the middle. These schools are further divided into subschools by head temple, with two head temples for Sōtō (Sōji-ji and Eihei-ji, with Sōji-ji having a much larger network), fourteen head temples for Rinzai, and one head temple (Manpuku-ji) for Ōbaku, for a total of 17 head temples. The Rinzai head temples, which are most numerous, have substantial overlap with the traditional Five Mountain System, and include Myoshin-ji, Nanzen-ji, Tenryū-ji, Daitoku-ji, and Tofuku-ji, among others.\n\nBesides these traditional organizations, there are modern Zen organisations which have especially attracted Western lay followers, namely the Sanbo Kyodan and the FAS Society.\n\nAlthough it is difficult to trace the precise moment when the West first became aware of Zen as a distinct form of Buddhism, the visit of Soyen Shaku, a Japanese Zen monk, to Chicago during the World Parliament of Religions in 1893 is often pointed to as an event that enhanced the profile of Zen in the Western world. It was during the late 1950s and the early 1960s that the number of Westerners other than the descendants of Asian immigrants who were pursuing a serious interest in Zen began to reach a significant level. Japanese Zen has gained the greatest popularity in the West. The various books on Zen by Reginald Horace Blyth, Alan Watts, Philip Kapleau and D. T. Suzuki published between 1950 and 1975, contributed to this growing interest in Zen in the West, as did the interest on the part of beat poets such as Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg and Gary Snyder. In 1958, the literary magazine \"Chicago Review\" played a significant role in introducing Zen to the American literary community when it published a special issue on Zen featuring the aforementioned beat poets and works in translation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Overview\"\n\"Formation of Chán in Tang & Song China\"\n\n\"Japan\"\n\n\"Modern times\"\n\n\"Orientalism and East-West interchange\"\n\n\n"}
