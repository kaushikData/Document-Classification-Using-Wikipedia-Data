The altar wings exhibited at the Hussite Museum in Tabor have the status of a national cultural monument. These are the two sides painted plates accrued before 1486. The wings were cut back and secondarily coated with baroque marbling, making reconversion survived the 17th and 18th centuries, since the inside of the right wing is the oldest depiction of the burning of Jan Hus depicted in the Czech Gothic panel painting. It is believed to be a fragment of an altarpiece, which has not survived. The anonymous painter portrayed \"Crucifixion\" and \"The Last Supper\", possibly in monstrance with the body of the Lord. Due to the fact that both wing plates are shown, it is assumed that the patron was Jakoubek of Vřesovice, a Hussite captain, from Roudníky and his son John.\n\nEach of the truncated wing plates has dimensions of 162 x 68 cm, framed 179 x 82 cm. The inner side of the left wing appears at the top of the \"Beheading of St. James the Greater\", while at the bottom is shown the Burning of St. Lawrence. The \"Beheading of St. James\" depicts two figures in discussion, one of which with a headdress in brocade in the form of a miter, the high priest Abiathar. The figure is a reference to the prelates who Hus condemned. In the lower part shows the \"death of St. Lawrence\", while the figure on the right is identifiable with the Emperor Decius. On the outer side of the plate is left St. James the Greater pilgrim's staff and St. Lawrence deacon holding the book and palm branch. Contralateral altar wing (board 2 inv. No. 4336) has on the inside at the top of \"Passion of Sebastian\", in the lower half of the burning of Jan Hus. On the outside is depicted St. James the Less, at the bottom of St. Stephen deacon. While the martyrdom of St. Sebastian depicts the Emperor Diocletian (left figure with a crown on his head), the \"Burning\" is dominated by the figure of a man with a princely cap. This represents Rhine Louis of Wittelsbach, which Sigismund handed Hus over to death. On the altar, cover it and Jan Hus assigned to prvomučedníkům Christian church – St. James, Vol. Sebastian and St. Lawrence. The fact that the left bottom plate is shown \"baking\" St. Lawrence, while on the right wing is depicted the \"burning of Jan Hus\", is not accidental. These are parallels between the forms of martyrdom of the saints.\n\nThe altar wings are not dated nor signed. The time of their creation can be inferred either by comparing to the manuscript painters in contemporary context, or biographical content of the patron of the altar. Jaromir Pešina states that the author of the piece was in contact with St. George's altar, whose work dates to early in the second half of the 15th century, newly assigned to Czech late Gothic panel painting. Milena Bartlová considered the painter as a member of the Prague workshop environment with knowledge of the Nuremberg masters (Hans Pleydenwurff) and Brussels patterns (Dirck Bouts). Jan Royt states that the artist who painted panels was aware of the Wrocław Master painting in the altar of St. Barbara, which could be instrumental in these Western European influences. These conjectures allow dating the genesis of the retable in 1470 to 1480s. In the event that the purchaser of the altar was a Hussite captain Jakoubek of Vřesovice, who died in 1467, dating emergence retable it can be shifted to the 1460s. The Church of St. Wenceslas (Roudníky), for whose altar it was intended, is already mentioned as a parish in 1352, and was rebuilt in the Gothic style in 1486.\n\nIn 1966, during restoration of the village church, students of the Academy of Fine Arts, Prague discovered two door panels on which were concealed, beneath overpainting, a baroque quality pre-medieval painting dating to the 1470s. Restoration of the original painted panels was done by Bohuslav and Ludmila Slaný in 1975. The last conservation and restoration work on both boards conducted by academic painter Naděžda Mašková and Miroslav Křížek in the year 2013/14. The altar wings were bought from the Trmice parish in the Diocese of Litomerice for the amount of CZK 12 million paid from the funds of the Ministry of Culture of the Czech Republic. Today it is one of the most important artistic artefacts, in the Hussite Museum in Tábor.\n\nThe finding of altar wings of Roudniky became one of the few documented Utraquist works in the development of painting in Bohemia after a period of stagnation on topics and painting techniques at the time of George of Poděbrady. It was a diversion in Prague acting \"Master of St. George's altar\" from a conservative home environment and the influence of Nuremberg painting from the mid-15th century, which influenced the anonymous Master. The Roudniky panels also likely originate from the Prague workshop environment.\n\nThe meaning of the altar wings of Roudniky lies in their iconography. Illustrations of Jan Hus as a holy martyr are captured in their oldest form, as we know from the few surviving fragments of altars from the middle of the 15th century. This monumental painting presents us with Jan Hus as a man of small stature with a round face, beardless, dressed in a liturgical white shirt. His representation with other religious saints assigns him to providence, and the founding legitimacy of the early church. Utraquists needed to present their own saint, with the traditional saints, as one of the reasons their relationship to the paintings had religious themes. \nConversely the painting served as a means of spreading reform ideas, but had a didactic function for laymen unfamiliar with iconography.\n\nThe altar wings of Roudniky was exhibited in the Teresian Wing of the Old Royal Palace at Prague Castle in the exhibition \"Jan Hus 1415–2005\" (30 June – 25 September 2005). Again, the two boards exhibited in the Imperial Stables at Prague Castle during the exhibition \"Art of the Czech Reformation\", which took place from 16 December 2009 to 4 April 2010. The new acquisition exhibiting an altar wing of the Hussite Museum in Tabor in February 2009, which is got into professional care at the end of 2012. the last two altar slabs enriched the exhibition \"Prague Hus and the Hussite 1415–2015\", which was held in the Clam-Gallas Palace in Prague from 25 September 2015 and 24 January 2016.\n\n\n"}

He maintained himself by acting as tutor to noblemen's sons. From 1741 to 1747 he lived with Lord Blantyre and Mr Hay of Drummelzier at Utrecht, and made excursions in Flanders, France and Germany. Returning to Scotland, he lived at Whittingehame, near Edinburgh, until his death in 1750. At Spa he had met John Wilkes, then twenty years old, and formed a lasting friendship with him.\n\nBaxter's chief work, \"An Inquiry into the Nature of the Human Soul\" (editions 1733, 1737 and 1745; with appendix added in 1750 in answer to an attack in Maclaurin's \"Account of Sir I. Newton's Philosophical Discoveries\", and dedication to John Wilkes), examines the properties of matter. It described the one essential property of matter as its inactivity, \"vis inertiae\" (accepted later by Monboddo). All movement in matter is, therefore, caused by some immaterial force, namely, God. But the movements of the body are not analogous to the movements of matter; they are caused by a special immaterial force, the soul. The soul, as being immaterial, is immortal, and its consciousness does not depend upon its connection with the body. He claimed the argument was supported by an analysis of the phenomena of dreams, which are ascribed to direct spiritual influences. Lastly Baxter attempted to prove that matter is finite. \n\nBaxter's \"Inquiry\" met rather different reactions. E.g. it was criticized by Benjamin Franklin in a letter which pointed on Baxter's lack of understand in mechanics, yet left a lasting impression on Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who said, 'I should not wonder if I found that Andrew had thought more on the subject of Dreams than any other of our Psychologists, Scotch or English'.\n\nHis work is an attack on John Toland's \"Letters to Serena\" (1704), which argued that motion is essential to matter, and on Locke and Berkeley. His criticism of Berkeley (in the second volume) is, however, based on the common misinterpretation of his theory. Sir Leslie Stephen described him as a curious example of \"the effects of an exploded metaphysics on a feeble though ingenious intellect\".\n\nBaxter's ideas on dreams were contested by Thomas Branch in his \"Thoughts on Dreaming\" (1738).\n\n\n\n"}

He was the \"personal philosopher\" of the Roman emperor Augustus for a time.\n\nAugustus esteemed him so highly that after the conquest of Alexandria, he declared that he spared the city chiefly for the sake of Areius. Modern scholars disagree over whether this was the actual reason Augustus spared the city, as at the same time Augustus claimed he was also doing it to honor the memory of Alexander the Great, and some scholars also suggest that he did it to curry favor with that city's elite.\n\nAreius as well as his two sons, Dionysius and Nicanor, are said to have instructed Augustus himself in philosophy, and Areius for a time resided directly within Augustus's household. He is frequently mentioned by the philosopher Themistius, who says that Augustus valued Areius not less than Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, who is commonly thought of as Augustus's confidant and right-hand man (though it must be mentioned that Themistius was writing four hundred years after the fact).\n\nOthers sources state that he was offered the post of \"Praefectus Augustalis\" (governor) of Egypt, but that Areius turned Augustus down in order to take a post in the province of Sicilia, though modern scholars have some doubt about this anecdote (primarily because there are no other examples of anyone being \"offered\" a post by Augustus and having turned him down). It has been suggested that this story was state propaganda to justify Augustus's removal of Areius from the province of Egypt and installation of Cornelius Gallus as Praefectus.\n\nAreius was succeeded as \"personal philosopher\" of Augustus by the philosopher Theon.

The reason for this reevaluation stems from the idea that, in systematic theology, the theologian attempts to develop a coherent theory running through the various doctrines within the tradition (Christology, eschatology, pneumatology, etc.). A potential problem underlying such study is that in constructing a system of theology, certain elements may be \"forced\" into a presupposed structure, or left out altogether, in order to maintain the coherence of the overall system. \n\nIn response to this realization, some modern theologians, especially Christian feminists such as Sallie McFague, Catherine Keller, and Sharon V. Betcher, feel that the term \"systematic\" is no longer accurate in reference to theology, and prefer the language of constructive theology. While not a proponent of the language of 'constructive theology,' Karl Barth frequently criticized the practice of systematizing theology or structuring a coherent system upon a philosophical foundation external to theology's own internal commitments.\n\n\"Constructive Theology\" is also the title of a journal on the subject. A Bloomsbury book series on constructive theology, titled \"Rethinking Theologies, Constructing Alternatives\", is edited by Marion Grau, Susannah Cornwall, Steed Davidson and Hyo-Dong Lee.\n\n"}
{"id": "45134", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45134", "title": "Discourse", "text": "Discourse\n\nDiscourse (from Latin \"discursus\", \"running to and from\") denotes written and spoken communications:\n\n\nAs discourse, an \"enouncement\" (statement) is not a unit of semiotic signs, but an abstract construct that allows the semiotic signs to assign meaning, and so communicate specific, repeatable communications to, between, and among objects, subjects, and statements. Therefore, a discourse is composed of semiotic sequences (relations among signs that communicate meaning) between and among objects, subjects, and statements.\n\nThe term \"discursive formation\" () conceptually describes the regular communications (written and spoken) that produce such discourses, such as informal conversations. As a philosopher, Michel Foucault applied the discursive formation in the analyses of large bodies of knowledge, such as political economy and natural history.\n\nIn the first sense-usage (semantics and discourse analysis), the term \"discourse\" is studied in corpus linguistics, the study of language expressed in \"corpora\" (samples) of \"real world\" text. In the second sense (the codified language of a field of enquiry) and in the third sense (a statement, \"un énoncé\"), the analysis of a \"discourse\" examines and determines the connections among language and structure and agency.\n\nMoreover, because a discourse is a body of text meant to communicate specific data, information, and knowledge, there exist internal relations in the content of a given discourse; likewise, there exist external relations among discourses. As such, a discourse does not exist \"per se\" (in itself), but is related to other discourses, by way of inter-discursivity. Discourses are also perpetually differentiating toward each other in time. Therefore, in the course of intellectual enquiry, the discourse among researchers features the questions and answers of \"What is ...?\" and \"What is not. ...\", conducted according to the meanings (denotation and connotation) of the concepts (statements) used in the given field of enquiry, such as anthropology, ethnography, and sociology; cultural studies and literary theory; the philosophy of science and feminism.\n\nIn the humanities and in the social sciences, the term \"discourse\" describes a formal way of thinking that can be expressed through language; the discourse is a social boundary that defines what statements can be said about a topic.\n\nDiscourse can affect the person's perspective; it is impossible to avoid discourse for any subject. For example, two notably distinct discourses can be used about various guerrilla movements describing them either as \"freedom fighters\" or \"terrorists\". In other words, the chosen discourse provides the vocabulary, expressions and perhaps also the style needed to communicate.\n\nDiscourses are embedded in different rhetorical genres and metagenres that constrain and enable them. That is language talking about language, for instance the American Psychiatric Association's DSMIV manual tells which terms have to be used in talking about mental health, thereby mediating meanings and dictating practices of the professionals of psychology and psychiatry.\n\nDiscourse is closely linked to different theories of power and state, at least as long as defining discourses is seen to mean defining reality itself. This conception of discourse is largely derived from the work of French philosopher Michel Foucault.\n\nA discourse representation theory describes the formal semantics of a sentence using predicate logic.\n\nModern theorists were focused on achieving progress and believed in the existence of natural and social laws which could be used universally to develop knowledge and thus a better understanding of society. Modernist theorists were preoccupied with obtaining the truth and reality and sought to develop theories which contained certainty and predictability. Modernist theorists therefore viewed discourse as being relative to talking or way of talking and understood discourse to be functional. Discourse and language transformations are ascribed to progress or the need to develop new or more \"accurate\" words to describe new discoveries, understandings, or areas of interest. In modern times, language and discourse are dissociated from power and ideology and instead conceptualized as \"natural\" products of common sense usage or progress. Modernism further gave rise to the liberal discourses of rights, equality, freedom, and justice; however, this rhetoric masked substantive inequality and failed to account for differences, according to Regnier.\n\nStructuralist theorists, such as Ferdinand de Saussure and Jacques Lacan, argue that all human actions and social formations are related to language and can be understood as systems of related elements. This means that the \"…individual elements of a system only have significance when considered in relation to the structure as a whole, and that structures are to be understood as self-contained, self-regulated, and self-transforming entities.\" In other words, it is the structure itself that determines the significance, meaning and function of the individual elements of a system. Structuralism has made an important contribution to our understanding of language and social systems. Saussure's theory of language highlights the decisive role of meaning and signification in structuring human life more generally.\n\nFollowing the perceived limitations of the modern era, emerged postmodern theory. Postmodern theorists rejected modernist claims that there was one theoretical approach that explained all aspects of society. Rather, postmodernist theorists were interested in examining the variety of experience of individuals and groups and emphasized differences over similarities and common experiences.\n\nIn contrast to modern theory, postmodern theory is more fluid and allows for individual differences as it rejected the notion of social laws. Postmodern theorists shifted away from truth seeking and instead sought answers for how truths are produced and sustained. Postmodernists contended that truth and knowledge is plural, contextual, and historically produced through discourses. Postmodern researchers therefore embarked on analyzing discourses such as texts, language, policies and practices.\n\nFrench social theorist Michel Foucault developed a notion of discourse in his early work, especially the \"Archaeology of knowledge\" (1972). In \"Discursive Struggles Within Social Welfare: Restaging Teen Motherhood\", Iara Lessa summarizes Foucault's definition of discourse as \"systems of thoughts composed of ideas, attitudes, courses of action, beliefs and practices that systematically construct the subjects and the worlds of which they speak.\" Foucault traces the role of discourses in wider social processes of legitimating and power, emphasizing the construction of current truths, how they are maintained and what power relations they carry with them. Foucault later theorized that discourse is a medium through which power relations produce speaking subjects. Foucault (1977, 1980) argued that power and knowledge are inter-related and therefore every human relationship is a struggle and negotiation of power. Foucault further stated that power is always present and can both produce and constrain the truth. Discourse according to Foucault (1977, 1980, 2003) is related to power as it operates by rules of exclusion. Discourse therefore is controlled by objects, what can be spoken of; ritual, where and how one may speak; and the privileged, who may speak. Coining the phrases power-knowledge Foucault (1980) stated knowledge was both the creator of power and creation of power. An object becomes a \"node within a network.\" In his work, \"The Archaeology of Knowledge,\" Foucault uses the example of a book to illustrate a node within a network. A book is not made up of individual words on a page, each of which has meaning, but rather \"is caught up in a system of references to other books, other texts, other sentences.\" The meaning of that book is connected to a larger, overarching web of knowledge and ideas to which it relates.\n\nOne of the key discourses that Foucault identified as part of his critique of power-knowledge was that of neoliberalism, which he related very closely to his conceptualization of governmentality in his lectures on biopolitics. This trajectory of Foucault's thinking has been taken up widely within Human Geography.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "306291", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=306291", "title": "Doubt", "text": "Doubt\n\nDoubt is a mental state in which the mind remains suspended between two or more contradictory propositions, unable to assent to any of them. Doubt on an emotional level is indecision between belief and disbelief. It may involve uncertainty, distrust or lack of conviction on certain facts, actions, motives, or decisions. Doubt can result in delaying or rejecting relevant action out of concern for mistakes or missed opportunities.\n\nThe concept of doubt as a suspense between two contradictory propositions covers a range of phenomena: on a level of the mind it involves reasoning, examination of facts and evidence and on an emotional level believing and disbelieving\n\nIn premodern theology doubt was \"the voice of an uncertain conscience\" and important to realize, because when in doubt \"the safer way is not to act at all\".\n\nDoubt sometimes tends to call on reason. Doubt may encourage people to hesitate before acting, and/or to apply more rigorous methods. Doubt may have particular importance as leading towards disbelief or non-acceptance.\n\nPolitics, ethics and law, with decisions that often determine the course of individual life, place great importance on doubt, and often foster elaborate adversarial processes to carefully sort through all available evidence.\n\nSocietally, doubt creates an atmosphere of distrust, being accusatory in nature and \"de facto\" alleging either foolishness or deceit on the part of another. Such a stance has been fostered in Western European society since the Enlightenment, in opposition to tradition and authority.\n\nSigmund Freud's psychoanalytic theory attributes doubt (which may be interpreted as a symptom of a phobia emanating from the ego) to childhood, when the ego develops. Childhood experiences, these theories maintain, can plant doubt about one's abilities and even about one's very identity.\n\nCognitive mental as well as more spiritual approaches abound in response to the wide variety of potential causes for doubt. Behavioral therapy — in which a person systematically asks his own mind if the doubt has any real basis — uses rational, Socratic methods. This method contrasts to those of say, the Buddhist faith, which involve a more esoteric approach to doubt and inaction. Buddhism sees doubt as a negative attachment to one's perceived past and future. To let go of the personal history of one's life (affirming this release every day in meditation) plays a central role in releasing the doubts — developed in and attached to — that history.\n\nPartial or intermittent negative reinforcement can create an effective climate of fear and doubt.\n\nDescartes employed Cartesian doubt as a pre-eminent methodological tool in his fundamental philosophical investigations.\nBranches of philosophy like logic devote much effort to distinguish the dubious, the probable and the certain. Much of illogic rests on dubious assumptions, dubious data or dubious conclusions, with rhetoric, whitewashing, and deception playing their accustomed roles.\n\nDoubt that god(s) exist may form the basis of agnosticism — the belief that one cannot determine the existence or non-existence of god(s). It may also form other brands of skepticism, such as Pyrrhonism, which do not take a positive stance in regard to the existence of god(s), but remain negative. Alternatively, doubt over the existence of god(s) may lead to acceptance of a particular religion: compare Pascal's Wager. Doubt of a specific theology, scriptural or deistic, may bring into question the truth of that theology's set of beliefs. On the other hand, doubt as to some doctrines but acceptance of others may lead to the growth of heresy and/or the splitting off of sects or groups of thought. Thus proto-Protestants doubted papal authority, and substituted alternative methods of governance in their new (but still recognizably similar) churches.\n\nChristianity often debates doubt in the contexts of salvation and eventual redemption in an afterlife. This issue has become particularly important in Protestantism, which requires \"only\" the acceptance of Jesus, though more contemporary versions have arisen within the Protestant churches that resemble Catholicism.\nDoubt as a path towards (deeper) belief lies at the heart of the story of Saint Thomas the Apostle. Note in this respect the theological views of Georg Hermes:\n... the starting-point and chief principle of every science, and hence of theology also, is not only methodical doubt, but positive doubt. One can believe only what one has perceived to be true from reasonable grounds, and consequently one must have the courage to continue doubting until one has found reliable grounds to satisfy the reason.\nChristian existentialists such as Søren Kierkegaard suggest that for one to truly have belief in God, one would also have to doubt one's beliefs about God; the doubt is the rational part of a person's thought involved in weighing evidence, without which the belief would have no real substance. Belief is not a decision based on evidence that, say, certain beliefs about God are true or a certain person is worthy of love. No such evidence could ever be enough to pragmatically justify the kind of total commitment involved in true theological belief or romantic love. Belief involves making that commitment anyway. Kierkegaard thought that to have belief is at the same time to have doubt.\n\nMost criminal cases within an adversarial system require that the prosecution proves its contentions beyond a reasonable doubt — a doctrine also called the \"burden of proof\". This means that the State must present propositions which preclude \"reasonable doubt\" in the mind of a reasonable person as to the guilt of defendant. Some doubt may persist, but only to the extent that it would \"not\" affect a \"reasonable person's\" belief in the defendant's guilt. If the doubt raised \"does\" affect a \"reasonable person's\" belief, the jury is not satisfied beyond a \"reasonable doubt\". The jurisprudence of the applicable jurisdiction usually defines the precise meaning of words such as \"reasonable\" and \"doubt\" for such purposes.\n\nTo doubt everything or to believe everything are two equally convenient solutions; both dispense with the necessity of reflection.\n—Henri Poincaré, Science and Hypothesis (1905) (from Dover abridged edition of 1952)\n\nThe scientific method regularly quantifies doubt, and uses it to determine whether further research is needed. Isaac Azimov, in his essay collection \"Fact and Fancy\", described science as a system for causing and resolving intelligent doubt.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3309927", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3309927", "title": "Epistulae Morales ad Lucilium", "text": "Epistulae Morales ad Lucilium\n\nThe (Latin for \"Moral Letters to Lucilius\"), also known as the Moral Epistles, is a collection of 124 letters which were written by Seneca the Younger at the end of his life, during his retirement, and written after he had worked for the Emperor Nero for more than ten years. They are addressed to Lucilius, the then procurator of Sicily, although he is known only through Seneca's writings. Regardless of how Seneca and Lucilius actually corresponded, it is clear that Seneca crafted the letters with a broad readership in mind.\n\nThe letters often begin with an observation on daily life before proceeding to an issue or principle that is abstracted from it. The result is a diary or handbook of philosophical meditations. The letters focus on many traditional themes of Stoic philosophy such as the contempt of death, the stout-heartedness of the sage, and virtue as the supreme good.\n\nThe \"Letters\" were probably written in the last three years of Seneca's life. It is generally agreed that the letters are arranged in the order in which they were written. In letter 8 Seneca alludes to his retirement from public life which is thought (by reference to Tacitus \"Annals\" xiv. 52–6) to have been around spring 62. Letter 18 was written in December in the run-up to the Saturnalia. Letter 23 refers to a cold spring, presumably in 63. Letter 67 refers to the end of a cold spring and is thought (in order to allow forty-three intervening letters to be written) to have been written the following year. Letter 91 refers to the great fire of Lugdunum (Lyon) which took place in the late summer of 64. Letter 122 refers to the shrinking daylight hours of autumn. Other chronologies are possible; in particular if letters 23 and 67 refer to the same spring then this can reduce the timescale by a full year.\n\nThe 124 letters are arranged in twenty manuscript volumes, but the collection is not complete. Aulus Gellius (mid-2nd-century) quotes an extract from the \"twenty-second book\", so some letters are missing. However since the fire of Lyon mentioned in letter 91 took place less than a year before Seneca's death (in spring 65) the number of missing letters is not thought to be very many.\n\nCollectively the letters constitute Seneca's longest work. Although addressed to Lucilius, the letters take the form of open letters, and are clearly written with a wider readership in mind. The epistolary genre was well-established in Seneca's time. Seneca refers to Cicero's letters to Atticus and the letters of Epicurus, and he was probably familiar with the letters of Plato and the epistles of Horace. However, despite the careful literary crafting, there is no obvious reason to doubt that they are real letters. Seneca often says that he is writing in response to a letter from Lucilius, although there is unlikely to have been a strict back-and-forth exchange of letters. Even if both writers had access to the imperial mail service, a letter from central Italy to Sicily would have taken four to eight days to travel. In many instances Seneca probably composed letters as a new subject occurred to him. On average the letters tend to become longer over time, and the later letters focus increasingly on theoretical questions. However even in the later letters Seneca continues to include letters that are very short.\n\nThese letters all start with the phrase \"Seneca Lucilio suo salutem\" (\"Seneca greets his Lucilius\") and end with the word \"Vale\" (\"Farewell\"). In these letters, Seneca gives Lucilius advice on how to become a more devoted Stoic. Some of the letters include \"On Noise\" and \"Asthma\". Others include letters on \"the influence of the masses\" and \"how to deal with one's slaves\". Although they deal with Seneca's personal style of Stoic philosophy, they also give us valuable insights into daily life in ancient Rome.\n\nThere is a general tendency throughout the letters to open proceedings with an observation of a specific (and usually rather minor) incident, which then digresses to a far wider exploration of an issue or principle that is abstracted from it. In one letter, for instance, Seneca begins by discussing a chance visit to an arena where a gladiatorial combat to the death is being held; Seneca then questions the morality and ethics of such a spectacle, in what is the first record (to our current knowledge) of a pre-Christian writer bringing up such a debate on that particular matter.\n\nSeneca frequently quotes Latin poets, especially Virgil, but also Ovid, Horace, and Lucretius. Seneca also quotes Publilius Syrus, such as during the eighth letter, \"On the Philosopher's Seclusion\".\n\nSeneca's letters are focused on the inner-life, and the joy which comes from wisdom. He emphasizes the Stoic theme that virtue is the only true good and vice the only true evil. He repeatedly refers to the brevity of life and the fleeting nature of time.\n\nUnderlying a large number of the letters is a concern with death on the one hand (a central topic of Stoic philosophy, and one embodied in Seneca's observation that we are \"dying every day\") and suicide on the other, a key consideration given Seneca's deteriorating political position and the common use of forced suicide as a method of elimination of figures deemed to be oppositional to the Emperor's power and rule.\n\nEarly letters often conclude with a maxim to meditate on, although this strategy is over by the thirtieth letter. Such maxims are typically drawn from Epicurus, but Seneca regards this as a beginner's technique. In letter 33 he stresses that the student must begin to make well-reasoned judgements independently.\n\nThe language and style of the letters is quite varied, and this reflects the fact that they are a mixture of private conversation and literary fiction. As an example, there is a mix of different vocabulary, incorporating technical terms (in fields such as medicine, law and navigation) as well as colloquial terms and philosophical ones. Seneca also uses a range of devices for particular effects, such as ironic parataxis, hypotactic periods, direct speech interventions and rhetorical techniques such as alliterations, chiasmus, polyptoton, paradoxes, antitheses, oxymoron, etymological figures and so forth. In addition there are neologisms and hapax legomena.\n\nThe oldest manuscripts of the letters date from the ninth-century. For a long time the letters did not circulate together, letters 89–124 in particular appear in their own manuscripts. They began to be widely circulated together from the twelfth-century onwards. The first printed edition appeared in 1475. Erasmus produced a much superior edition in 1529.\n\nMichel de Montaigne was influenced by his reading of Seneca's letters, and he modelled his \"Essays\" on them. The letters were a principal source for Justus Lipsius for the development of his Neostoicism towards the end of the 16th-century.\n\nThere have been several full translations of the 124 letters ever since Thomas Lodge included a translation in his complete works of 1614.\n\nThere have been many selected and abridged translations of Seneca's letters. Recent editions include:\n\nThe tag \"Vita sine litteris mors\" ('Life without learning [is] death') is adapted from \"Epistle\" 82 (originally \"Otium sine litteris mors\", 'Leisure without learning [is] death') and is the motto of Derby School and Derby Grammar School in England, Adelphi University, New York, and Manning's High School, Jamaica.\n\nThe work is also the source for the phrase \"non scholae sed vitae\": \"We do not learn for school, but for life\".\n\n\n\n"}

It has relevance to naturalism and physicalism in philosophy, and to philosophy of mind.\n\nPhysicalism, in at least one rough sense, is the claim that the entire world may be described and explained using the laws of nature, in other words, that all phenomena are natural phenomena. This leaves open the question of what is 'natural', but one common understanding of the claim is that everything in the world is ultimately explicable in the terms of physics. This is known as reductive physicalism. However, this type of physicalism in its turn leaves open the question of what we are to consider as the proper terms of physics. There seem to be two options here, and these options form the horns of Hempel's dilemma, because neither seems satisfactory.\n\nOn the one hand, we may define the physical as whatever is currently explained by our best physical theories, e.g., quantum mechanics, general relativity. Though many would find this definition unsatisfactory, some would accept that we have at least a general understanding of the physical based on these theories, and can use them to assess what is physical and what is not. And therein lies the rub, as a worked-out explanation of mentality currently lies outside the scope of such theories.\n\nOn the other hand, if we say that some future, \"ideal\" physics is what is meant, then the claim is rather empty, for we have no idea of what this means. The \"ideal\" physics may even come to define what we think of as mental as part of the physical world. In effect, physicalism by this second account becomes the circular claim that all phenomena are explicable in terms of physics because physics properly defined is whatever explains all phenomena.\n\nBeenakker has proposed to resolve Hempel's dilemma with the definition: \"The boundary between physics and metaphysics is the boundary between what can and what cannot be computed in the age of the universe\".\n\nHempel's dilemma is relevant to philosophy of mind because explanations of issues such as consciousness, representation, and intentionality are very hard to come by using current physics although many people in philosophy (and other fields such as cognitive science, psychology, and neuroscience) hold to physicalism.\n"}
{"id": "58342854", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58342854", "title": "History of shamanism", "text": "History of shamanism\n\nShamanism is a system of religious practice believed to be one of the oldest and earliest forms of religion in the world. It often associated with indigenous and tribal societies tribes around the world, and involves belief in that \"shamans\", with a connection to the otherworld, have the power to heal the sick, communicate with spirits, and escort souls of the dead to the afterlife. Shamans are often regarded as people who can connect with nature and spirits and can often also heal spiritual as well as physical sicknesses. Although shamanic practices have differed slightly around the world, the fundamental principles and believes remain the same, with variation occurring in rituals and worship of ancestors. Shamans are often highly respected in their communities due to the multiple roles they play. Shamanism is especially associated with the native peoples of Siberia in northern Asia, where shamanic practice has been noted for centuries by Asian and Western visitors, and the term itself derives from a Siberian language, though \"shamanism\" as a cultural anthropological term is applied much more broadly to similar practices world-wide.\n\nShamanism is an ideology that used to be widely practiced in Europe, Asia, Tibet, North and South America, and Africa, centered on the belief in supernatural phenomenon such as the world of gods, demons, and ancestral spirits only responsive to a shaman. The word \"shamanism\" derives from the Manchu-Tungus word , meaning 'one who knows'. Shamanism have also been defined as shamans having entered into another state of altered consciousness which can enable one to connect with spiritual beings not of the mainstream world. They have been associated as healers, teachers, scholars and a spiritual guide in the early times of human civilization. Shamans are often highly regarded due to the multiple roles they play and is often the one who leads and guides the rituals and ceremonies that take place. \n\nHistorians such as described it as religion because it contains a set of beliefs, tales, and ritual practices that form a well-organized net of interrelationships. On the other hand, there are also those such as Timothy Insoll who consider the religious label misleading because of the notion that shamanism represented a configuration within a broader religious pattern instead of religion for its followers even in Siberia, the origin of the word \"shaman\". This conception, according to an account, fits what Harvey Whitehouse described as \"imagistic mode of religiosity\".\n\nShamanism practices varies across the globe where it is a prehistoric tradition from the Paleolithic era, with cave art some 30,000 years old showing evidence of shamanic practices. The term's origin in the history of Manchu-Tungus and related languages is unknown and this is primarily attributed to the way it comes from an oral tradition. Anthropologists, however, propose that it originated in northern Asia, particularly from the Evenki word \"saman\", which is derived from the Tunguso-Manchurian verb (to know) and also related to the same word used by the Mongols, and the \"kan\" and \"xam\" of Turkic languages.\n\nThere is a theory that the origin of shamanism has a physiological basis on account of the capacity of all mammalian nervous systems for trance and altered perception. This drew support from the claim made by Jean Clottes and David Lewis-Williams that prehistoric humans experienced hallucinations and performed repetitive ritual activities that affected the consciousness, to explain the emergence of shamans. \n\nShamanic practices have often been regarded as one of the oldest spiritual practices which have slowly become incorporated into other religions replicated through mystic and symbolic practices and rituals of other religion. Shamanism practices have been found all over the world however little traces of it remain as it has gradually declined in practice and as a religion. Before shamanism faded out it was one of the most widely practiced religions with practices differing in multiple regions however they are all still similar in which the religion revolves around shamans and the multiple spiritual beliefs. \n\nShamanism varies from region to region, country to country as a result of differing cultures and beliefs. As shamanism has been around for so long the exact date of when shamanism actually occurred leaves much to be debated by anthropologists, due to issues with historical preservation and historical accuracy of records. Shamanism is believed to have been around as early as the Paleolithic era or more commonly known as the Stone Age.In Europe and Africa cave artworks from the Paleolithic era dated some 20,000 years ago indicate that shamanic practices were prominent even during that time. Due to shamanism practices varying across each continent and country there is also a discrepancy in its history however as not enough history was preserved to explain in great detail due to the decline of shamanism as well as various other historical events.\n\nAlthough there is evidence suggesting that shamanism has been around for 30,000 years and maybe even longer there is however no solid evidence which provides conclusive evidence as to the exact time period on when shamanism has come about. There is however concrete evidence that shamanism has existed for at least 10,000 years ago due to excavations \nShamans often play an important role in each tribal society and are often regarded as the healer and also the medium that can communicate with spirits and the dead where they are often responsible for sacrificial rituals where ceremonies are carried out by them and throughout history they were a vital part of each tribe. However, Shamanism has slowly started to decline as time progressed and new religions such as Christianity came in and eventually only a few remote tribes still retained the practices of shamanism and one such tribe is the Inuit Tribe in the Canadian Arctic. Traditional shamanism often involved the Shamans being chosen by the tribe or inherited however as the tradition of Shamanism declined and now replaced with a modern version of Shamanism people can now choose to take up shamanism training. Traditionally the role of shamans is one that is often respected and regarded as an elder in the tribe.\n\nIn a excavation of a Mesolithic archaeological site, Star Carr located in North Yorkshire, England, evidence of shamanism can be found in the archaeological findings. The Mesolithic period or otherwise known as the Middle Stone Age dates between 10,000 BC and 4000 BC. At the Star Carr excavation site they found twenty one adult red deer skull parts where there was evidence that these skull parts was deliberately carved and shaped to make it possible for them to be worn on the head of humans with archaeologists suggesting these were used on special occasions or for shamanic practices. This was suggested due to the fact that a characteristic part of shamanic rituals was the headdress's seen on shamans as part of the ceremonial costume where is was believed that headdresses had the effect of increasing concentration in shamans when they are in meditation or performing spiritual ceremonies. To this day Star Carr plays a vital role in understanding the history of shamanism especially from a western point of view due to limited historical records as they have not been able to be preserved throughout time.\n\nNot only in England but costume has played a key role in shamanic practices as it is believed to allow one to better integrate themselves with the spiritual world and the nature around them with many archaeologists suggesting that during the middle stone age period natural places like hills, waterfalls and caves contain animistic entities. This is particularly so as shamanic practices have traditionally been correlated to the naturalistic world.\n\nEven though it has declined, Shamanism has managed to survive the prosecution of various regimes through time such as other organised religion and Marxist regimes with key principles of Shamanism still present today albeit limited in many areas. One of the last practices of Shamanism in the 21st Century can be found in nomadic Tuvan tribe with only an estimated 3000 people surviving from this tribe. Tuva is one of the most isolated tribes in Russia where the art of shamanism been preserved until today due to its isolated existence, allowing it to be free from the influences of other major religions. The Khakas is another tribe isolated from the world where living in the Steppes of Southern Siberia where there history dates back to the Copper age with cave art as proof with shamanism still being prominent in the present age.\n\nShamanism has long declined and this is because larger religions have emerged and replacing it. Shamanism has declined mainly due to larger religions coming in and replacing it where shamanism is now often considered as a primitive and superstitious religion which is untrue. Shamanism is a religion that has changed over time and modern shamanism in the Western context is now regarded as neo-shamanism, which emerged in the 20th century. It involves the integration of traditional indigenous shamanic techniques combined with psychotherapeutic techniques of the urbanised Western world where its main inspiration is derived mainly from the indigenous shamanic practices of Amazonian, Mesoamerican, and North American indigenous people. Michael Harner introduced the concept of \"core shamanism\" in his work \"The Way of the Shaman\", which forms the basis of neo-shamanism. \nToday, shamanism is considered a universal religion something that transcends geographical and cultural boundaries with emphasis on the importance in reconnecting with our spiritual roots. With the rise of the counterculture movement where people started to seek to understand more on ones consciousness, spiritual connection and healing, people began to look into the historical roots of shamanism and a growing interest in plant-based hallucinogenic drugs. This gave rise to neo-shamanism in that time period where it started to gain a greater prominence and interest globally. The counterculture movement was a time during the 1960s where youth rejected the socials norms of that era with a rise in women rights, LGBT movement and experiments with psychedelic music and drugs. This led to a rise in neo-shamanism due to what it embodies about spiritual consciousness and psychotherapy. Neo-shamanism often dismisses the evil and fear that has been associated with traditional shamanism where fear and evil was a core part of shamanic rituals in some spiritual connections.\n\nBeginning in the 20th century, people began to see shamanism as a form of psychotherapy suggesting that shamanic practices is comparable to that of psychoanalysis. For instance, Abraham Maslow referred to shamanism as an ancient form of psychotherapy, particularly one that supports the view of psychotherapy as need gratification through interpersonal relations. Thereafter, shamanism practices have been increasingly studied by medical specialists and psychologists who utilize its core principles to better complement the treatments given. \n\nPsychologists have also done numerous research on the core principles of shamanism and applying it to spiritual and mental well being by using it in psychological treatments. Much research has gone into looking at how spiritualism can help with easing of the mind playing a bigger role in psychology today. Modern shamanism can also be explained in a scientific sense as one that is inherently able to connect with our beliefs on a spiritual level in a certain state of consciousness. This is demonstrated in the case of the shamanic journey where the shaman enters an alternate state of consciousness and acquire knowledge through access to multiple layers of reality. This has been considered a psychological technique that has certain similarities to lucid dreams, Jungian active imagination, and near-death experiences. When applied as a treatment, the shamanic journey allows the retrieval of memory and the causes of problems such as trauma.\n\nAs shamanic beliefs embraces cosmogenic beliefs from a scientific view researchers have considered the idea that various aspects of shamanic trance like healing is involved with activating certain areas of the brain to generate certain somatic reactions. Looking from this aspect it has meant that doctors and psychologists are placing greater importance in the resurgence of certain shamanic practices as it can potentially have large benefits in therapeutic management of social and psychoaffective factors. \n\n"}

Saint Thomas Aquinas is reputed to have employed the phrase \"hominem unius libri timeo\" (meaning \"I fear the man of a single book\").\n\nThere are other attributions, and variants of the phrase.\nVariants include \"cave\" for \"timeo\", and \"virum\" or \"lectorem\" (\"reader\") for \"hominem\".\n\"The Concise Dictionary of Foreign Quotations\" (London 1998), attributes the quote to Augustine of Hippo.\nOther attributions named Pliny the Younger, Seneca, Quintilian or Augustine, but the existence of the phrase cannot be substantiated as predating the early modern period.\n\nThe phrase was in origin a dismissal of eclecticism, i.e. the \"fear\" is of the formidable intellectual opponent who has dedicated himself to and become a master in a single chosen discipline; \nhowever, the phrase today most often refers to the interpretation of expressing \"fear\" of the opinions of the illiterate man who has \"only read a single book\".\n\nThe literary critic Clarence Brown described the phrase in his introduction to a novel by Yuri Olesha:\nThe poet Robert Southey recalled the tradition in which the quotation became embedded: \nBy way of comparison, Southey quotes Lope de Vega's \"Isidro de Madrid\" expressing a similar sentiment, \n\nThe writer and naturalist Charles Kingsley, following the tradition laid down by Gilbert White in \"The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne\" (1789), also invoked the proverb in favour of knowing completely one small area. \"A lesson is never learnt till it is learnt over many times, and a spot is best understood by staying in it and mastering it. In natural history the old scholar's saw \"Cave hominem unius libri\" may be paraphrased by, 'He is a thoroughly good naturalist who knows one parish thoroughly.'\"\n\nJohn Wesley invoked the phrase in this sense and declared himself to be a \"homo unius libri\", the \"one book\" being the Bible.\nLike Methodists in the strict Wesleyan tradition of depending upon the One Book, many seventeenth century and modern radical Protestants pride themselves on being \"homines unius libri\". The poet William Collins in his deranged condition, met by chance his old friend Dr. Samuel Johnson, who found Collins carrying a New Testament. \"I have but one book,\" said Collins, \"but it is the best\".\n\nEdward Everett applied the remark \"not only to the man of one book, but also to the man of one idea, in whom the sense of proportion is lacking, and who sees only that for which he looks\".\n\nJoseph Needham, in the general conclusions to his \"Science and Civilisation in China\" series, observed of the saying, \"It could mean that this man has only read one book, has only written one book, does not possess more than one book, or puts his faith in one book only. The fear that is felt may be on behalf of the man himself. Having read so little he is quite at the mercy of his one book!\"\n\nIn Samuel Butler's \"The Way of All Flesh\" (1903), a publisher uses the phrase to describe the novel's protagonist.\nButler also records that his own publisher, \"Trübner\", applied the phrase to him to express doubts in his literary prospect, the \"one book\" of Butler's in this case being \"Erewhon\".\n\n"}

{"id": "8919856", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8919856", "title": "Hubert Dreyfus's views on artificial intelligence", "text": "Hubert Dreyfus's views on artificial intelligence\n\nHubert Dreyfus has been a critic of artificial intelligence research since the 1960s. In a series of papers and books, including Alchemy and AI (1965), What Computers Can't Do (1972; 1979; 1992) and Mind over Machine (1986), he presented a pessimistic assessment of AI's progress and a critique of the philosophical foundations of the field. Dreyfus' objections are discussed in most introductions to the philosophy of artificial intelligence, including , the standard AI textbook, and in , a survey of contemporary philosophy.\n\nDreyfus argued that human intelligence and expertise depend primarily on unconscious processes rather than conscious symbolic manipulation, and that these unconscious skills can never be fully captured in formal rules. His critique was based on the insights of modern continental philosophers such as Merleau-Ponty and Heidegger, and was directed at the first wave of AI research which used high level formal symbols to represent reality and tried to reduce intelligence to symbol manipulation.\n\nWhen Dreyfus' ideas were first introduced in the mid-1960s, they were met with ridicule and outright hostility. By the 1980s, however, many of his perspectives were rediscovered by researchers working in robotics and the new field of connectionism—approaches now called \"sub-symbolic\" because they eschew early AI research's emphasis on high level symbols. In the 21st century, statistics-based approaches to machine learning simulate the way that the brain uses unconscious process to perceive, notice anomalies and make quick judgements. These techniques are highly successful and are currently widely used in both industry and academia. Historian and AI researcher Daniel Crevier writes: \"time has proven the accuracy and perceptiveness of some of Dreyfus's comments.\" Dreyfus said in 2007, \"I figure I won and it's over—they've given up.\"\n\nIn \"Alchemy and AI\" (1965) and \"What Computers Can't Do\" (1972), Dreyfus summarized the history of artificial intelligence and ridiculed the unbridled optimism that permeated the field. For example, Herbert A. Simon, following the success of his program General Problem Solver (1957), predicted that by 1967:\nThe press reported these predictions in glowing reports of the imminent arrival of machine intelligence.\n\nDreyfus felt that this optimism was totally unwarranted. He believed that they were based on false assumptions about the nature of human intelligence. Pamela McCorduck explains Dreyfus position:\n[A] great misunderstanding accounts for public confusion about thinking machines, a misunderstanding perpetrated by the unrealistic claims researchers in AI have been making, claims that thinking machines are already here, or at any rate, just around the corner.\n\nThese predictions were based on the success of an \"information processing\" model of the mind, articulated by Newell and Simon in their physical symbol systems hypothesis, and later expanded into a philosophical position known as computationalism by philosophers such as Jerry Fodor and Hilary Putnam. Believing that they had successfully simulated the essential process of human thought with simple programs, it seemed a short step to producing fully intelligent machines. However, Dreyfus argued that philosophy, especially 20th-century philosophy, had discovered serious problems with this information processing viewpoint. The mind, according to modern philosophy, is nothing like a digital computer.\n\nIn \"Alchemy and AI\" and \"What Computers Can't Do\", Dreyfus identified four philosophical assumptions that supported the faith of early AI researchers that human intelligence depended on the manipulation of symbols. \"In each case,\" Dreyfus writes, \"the assumption is taken by workers in [AI] as an axiom, guaranteeing results, whereas it is, in fact, one hypothesis among others, to be tested by the success of such work.\"\n\n\nIn the early days of research into neurology, scientists realized that neurons fire in all-or-nothing pulses. Several researchers, such as Walter Pitts and Warren McCulloch, argued that neurons functioned similar to the way Boolean logic gates operate, and so could be imitated by electronic circuitry at the level of the neuron.\nWhen digital computers became widely used in the early 50s, this argument was extended to suggest that the brain was a vast physical symbol system, manipulating the binary symbols of zero and one. Dreyfus was able to refute the biological assumption by citing research in neurology that suggested that the action and timing of neuron firing had analog components. To be fair, however, Daniel Crevier observes that \"few still held that belief in the early 1970s, and nobody argued against Dreyfus\" about the biological assumption.\n\n\nHe refuted this assumption by showing that much of what we \"know\" about the world consists of complex \"attitudes\" or \"tendencies\" that make us lean towards one interpretation over another. He argued that, even when we use explicit symbols, we are using them against an unconscious background of commonsense knowledge and that without this background our symbols cease to mean anything. This background, in Dreyfus' view, was not implemented in individual brains as explicit individual symbols with explicit individual meanings.\n\n\nThis concerns the philosophical issue of epistemology, or the study of knowledge. Even if we agree that the psychological assumption is false, AI researchers could still argue (as AI founder John McCarthy has) that it was possible for a symbol processing machine to represent all knowledge, regardless of whether human beings represented knowledge the same way. Dreyfus argued that there was no justification for this assumption, since so much of human knowledge was not symbolic.\n\n\nDreyfus also identified a subtler assumption about the world. AI researchers (and futurists and science fiction writers) often assume that there is no limit to formal, scientific knowledge, because they assume that any phenomenon in the universe can be described by symbols or scientific theories. This assumes that everything that \"exists\" can be understood as objects, properties of objects, classes of objects, relations of objects, and so on: precisely those things that can be described by logic, language and mathematics. The question of what exists is called ontology, and so Dreyfus calls this the ontological assumption. If this is false, then it raises doubts about what we can ultimately know and what intelligent machines will ultimately be able to help us to do.\n\nIn \"Mind Over Machine\" (1986), written during the heyday of expert systems, Dreyfus analyzed the difference between human expertise and the programs that claimed to capture it. This expanded on ideas from \"What Computers Can't Do\", where he had made a similar argument criticizing the \"cognitive simulation\" school of AI research practiced by Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon in the 1960s.\n\nDreyfus argued that human problem solving and expertise depend on our background sense of the context, of what is important and interesting given the situation, rather than on the process of searching through combinations of possibilities to find what we need. Dreyfus would describe it in 1986 as the difference between \"knowing-that\" and \"knowing-how\", based on Heidegger's distinction of present-at-hand and ready-to-hand.\n\nKnowing-that is our conscious, step-by-step problem solving abilities. We use these skills when we encounter a difficult problem that requires us to stop, step back and search through ideas one at time. At moments like this, the ideas become very precise and simple: they become context free symbols, which we manipulate using logic and language. These are the skills that Newell and Simon had demonstrated with both psychological experiments and computer programs. Dreyfus agreed that their programs adequately imitated the skills he calls \"knowing-that.\"\n\nKnowing-how, on the other hand, is the way we deal with things normally. We take actions without using conscious symbolic reasoning at all, as when we recognize a face, drive ourselves to work or find the right thing to say. We seem to simply jump to the appropriate response, without considering any alternatives. This is the essence of expertise, Dreyfus argued: when our intuitions have been trained to the point that we forget the rules and simply \"size up the situation\" and react.\n\nThe human sense of the situation, according to Dreyfus, is based on our goals, our bodies and our culture—all of our unconscious intuitions, attitudes and knowledge about the world. This “context” or \"background\" (related to Heidegger's Dasein) is a form of knowledge that is not stored in our brains symbolically, but intuitively in some way. It affects what we notice and what we don't notice, what we expect and what possibilities we don't consider: we discriminate between what is essential and inessential. The things that are inessential are relegated to our \"fringe consciousness\" (borrowing a phrase from William James): the millions of things we're aware of, but we're not really thinking about right now. \n\nDreyfus does not believe that AI programs, as they were implemented in the 70s and 80s, could capture this \"background\" or do the kind of fast problem solving that it allows. He argued that our unconscious knowledge could \"never\" be captured symbolically. If AI could not find a way to address these issues, then it was doomed to failure, an exercise in \"tree climbing with one's eyes on the moon.\"\n\nDreyfus began to formulate his critique in the early 1960s while he was a professor at MIT, then a hotbed of artificial intelligence research. His first publication on the subject is a half-page objection to a talk given by Herbert A. Simon in the spring of 1961. Dreyfus was especially bothered, as a philosopher, that AI researchers seemed to believe they were on the verge of solving many long standing philosophical problems within a few years, using computers.\n\nIn 1965, Dreyfus was hired (with his brother Stuart Dreyfus' help) by Paul Armer to spend the summer at RAND Corporation's Santa Monica facility, where he would write \"Alchemy and AI\", the first salvo of his attack. Armer had thought he was hiring an impartial critic and was surprised when Dreyfus produced a scathing paper intended to demolish the foundations of the field. (Armer stated he was unaware of Dreyfus' previous publication.) Armer delayed publishing it, but ultimately realized that \"just because it came to a conclusion you didn't like was no reason not to publish it.\" It finally came out as RAND Memo and soon became a best seller.\n\nThe paper flatly ridiculed AI research, comparing it to alchemy: a misguided attempt to change metals to gold based on a theoretical foundation that was no more than mythology and wishful thinking. It ridiculed the grandiose predictions of leading AI researchers, predicting that there were limits beyond which AI would not progress and intimating that those limits would be reached soon.\n\nThe paper \"caused an uproar\", according to Pamela McCorduck. The AI community's response was derisive and personal. Seymour Papert dismissed one third of the paper as \"gossip\" and claimed that every quotation was deliberately taken out of context. Herbert A. Simon accused Dreyfus of playing \"politics\" so that he could attach the prestigious RAND name to his ideas. Simon said, \"what I resent about this was the RAND name attached to that garbage\".\n\nDreyfus, who taught at MIT, remembers that his colleagues working in AI \"dared not be seen having lunch with me.\" Joseph Weizenbaum, the author of ELIZA, felt his colleagues' treatment of Dreyfus was unprofessional and childish. Although he was an outspoken critic of Dreyfus' positions, he recalls \"I became the only member of the AI community to be seen eating lunch with Dreyfus. And I deliberately made it plain that theirs was not the way to treat a human being.\"\n\nThe paper was the subject of a short in \"The New Yorker\" magazine on June 11, 1966. The piece mentioned Dreyfus' contention that, while computers may be able to play checkers, no computer could yet play a decent game of chess. It reported with wry humor (as Dreyfus had) about the victory of a ten-year-old over the leading chess program, with \"even more than its usual smugness.\"\n\nIn hope of restoring AI's reputation, Seymour Papert arranged a chess match between Dreyfus and Richard Greenblatt's Mac Hack program. Dreyfus lost, much to Papert's satisfaction. An Association for Computing Machinery bulletin used the headline:\nDreyfus complained in print that he hadn't said a computer will \"never\" play chess, to which Herbert A. Simon replied: \"You should recognize that some of those who are bitten by your sharp-toothed prose are likely, in their human weakness, to bite back ... may I be so bold as to suggest that you could well begin the cooling---a recovery of your sense of humor being a good first step.\"\n\nBy the early 1990s several of Dreyfus' radical opinions had become mainstream.\n\nFailed predictions. As Dreyfus had foreseen, the grandiose predictions of early AI researchers failed to come true. Fully intelligent machines (now known as \"strong AI\") did not appear in the mid-1970s as predicted. HAL 9000 (whose capabilities for natural language, perception and problem solving were based on the advice and opinions of Marvin Minsky) did not appear in the year 2001. \"AI researchers\", writes Nicolas Fearn, \"clearly have some explaining to do.\" Today researchers are far more reluctant to make the kind of predictions that were made in the early days. (Although some futurists, such as Ray Kurzweil, are still given to the same kind of optimism.)\n\nThe biological assumption, although common in the forties and early fifties, was no longer assumed by most AI researchers by the time Dreyfus published \"What Computers Can't Do\". Although many still argue that it is essential to reverse-engineer the brain by simulating the action of neurons (such as Ray Kurzweil or Jeff Hawkins), they don't assume that neurons are essentially digital, but rather that the action of analog neurons can be simulated by digital machines to a reasonable level of accuracy. (Alan Turing had made this same observation as early as 1950.)\n\nThe psychological assumption and unconscious skills. Many AI researchers have come to agree that human reasoning does not consist primarily of high-level symbol manipulation. In fact, since Dreyfus first published his critiques in the 60s, AI research in general has moved away from high level symbol manipulation or \"GOFAI\", towards new models that are intended to capture more of our \"unconscious\" reasoning. Daniel Crevier writes that by 1993, unlike 1965, AI researchers \"no longer made the psychological assumption\", and had continued forward without it. \n\nIn the 1980s, these new \"sub-symbolic\" approaches included: \n\nIn the 1990s and the early decades of the 21st century, statistics-based approaches to machine learning used techniques related to economics and statistics to allow machines to \"guess\" – to make inexact, probabilistic decisions and predictions based on experience and learning. These programs simulate the way our unconscious instincts are able to perceive, notice anomalies and make quick judgements, similar to what Dreyfus called \"sizing up the situation and reacting\", but here the \"situation\" consists of vast amounts of numerical data. These techniques are highly successful and are currently widely used in both industry and academia.\n\nThis research has gone forward without any direct connection to Dreyfus' work.\n\nKnowing-how and knowing-that. Research in psychology and economics has been able to show that Dreyfus' (and Heidegger's) speculation about the nature of human problem solving was essentially correct. Daniel Kahnemann and Amos Tversky collected a vast amount of hard evidence that human beings use two very different methods to solve problems, which they named \"system 1\" and \"system 2\". System one, also known as the adaptive unconscious, is fast, intuitive and unconscious. System 2 is slow, logical and deliberate. Their research was collected in the book \"Thinking, Fast and Slow\", and inspired Malcolm Gladwell's popular book \"Blink\". As with AI, this research was entirely independent of both Dreyfus and Heidegger.\n\nAlthough clearly AI research has come to agree with Dreyfus, McCorduck claimed that \"my impression is that this progress has taken place piecemeal and in response to tough given problems, and owes nothing to Dreyfus.\"\n\nThe AI community, with a few exceptions, chose not to respond to Dreyfus directly. \"He's too silly to take seriously\" a researcher told Pamela McCorduck. Marvin Minsky said of Dreyfus (and the other critiques coming from philosophy) that \"they misunderstand, and should be ignored.\" When Dreyfus expanded \"Alchemy and AI\" to book length and published it as \"What Computers Can't Do\" in 1972, no one from the AI community chose to respond (with the exception of a few critical reviews). McCorduck asks \"If Dreyfus is so wrong-headed, why haven't the artificial intelligence people made more effort to contradict him?\"\n\nPart of the problem was the \"kind\" of philosophy that Dreyfus used in his critique. Dreyfus was an expert in modern European philosophers (like Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty). AI researchers of the 1960s, by contrast, based their understanding of the human mind on engineering principles and efficient problem solving techniques related to management science. On a fundamental level, they spoke a different language. Edward Feigenbaum complained, \"What does he offer us? Phenomenology! That ball of fluff. That cotton candy!\" In 1965, there was simply too huge a gap between European philosophy and artificial intelligence, a gap that has since been filled by cognitive science, connectionism and robotics research. It would take many years before artificial intelligence researchers were able to address the issues that were important to continental philosophy, such as situatedness, embodiment, perception and gestalt.\n\nAnother problem was that he claimed (or seemed to claim) that AI would \"never\" be able to capture the human ability to understand context, situation or purpose in the form of rules. But (as Peter Norvig and Stuart Russell would later explain), an argument of this form cannot be won: just because one cannot imagine formal rules that govern human intelligence and expertise, this does not mean that no such rules exist. They quote Alan Turing's answer to all arguments similar to Dreyfus's:\"we cannot so easily convince ourselves of the absence of complete laws of behaviour ... The only way we know of for finding such laws is scientific observation, and we certainly know of no circumstances under which we could say, 'We have searched enough. There are no such laws.'\"Dreyfus did not anticipate that AI researchers would realize their mistake and begin to work towards new solutions, moving away from the symbolic methods that Dreyfus criticized. In 1965, he did not imagine that such programs would one day be created, so he claimed AI was impossible. In 1965, AI researchers did not imagine that such programs were necessary, so they claimed AI was almost complete. Both were wrong.\n\nA more serious issue was the impression that Dreyfus' critique was incorrigibly hostile. McCorduck wrote, \"His derisiveness has been so provoking that he has estranged anyone he might have enlightened. And that's a pity.\" Daniel Crevier stated that \"time has proven the accuracy and perceptiveness of some of Dreyfus's comments. Had he formulated them less aggressively, constructive actions they suggested might have been taken much earlier.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2445375", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2445375", "title": "Jaegwon Kim", "text": "Jaegwon Kim\n\nJaegwon Kim (born September 12, 1934) is a Korean-American philosopher who is now an emeritus professor at Brown University, but who also taught at several other leading American universities. He is best known for his work on mental causation, the mind-body problem and the metaphysics of supervenience and events. Key themes in his work include: a rejection of Cartesian metaphysics, the limitations of strict psychophysical identity, supervenience, and the individuation of events. Kim's work on these and other contemporary metaphysical and epistemological issues is well represented by the papers collected in \"Supervenience and Mind: Selected Philosophical Essays\" (1993).\n\nKim took two years of college in Seoul, South Korea as a French literature major, before transferring to Dartmouth College in 1955. Soon after, at Dartmouth, he changed to a combined major in French, mathematics, and philosophy and received a B.A. degree. After Dartmouth, he went to Princeton University, where he earned his Ph.D. in philosophy.\n\nKim is the Emeritus William Herbert Perry Faunce Professor of Philosophy at Brown University (since 1987). He has also taught at Swarthmore College, Cornell University, the University of Notre Dame, Johns Hopkins University, and, for many years, at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. From 1988–1989, he was president of the American Philosophical Association, Central Division. Since 1991, he has been a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Along with Ernest Sosa, he is a joint editor of the quarterly philosophical journal \"Noûs\".\n\nAccording to Kim, two of his major philosophical influences are Carl Hempel and Roderick Chisholm. Hempel, who sent him a letter encouraging him to go to Princeton, was a \"formative influence\". More specifically, Kim claims that he hopes he learned \"a certain style of philosophy, one that emphasizes clarity, responsible argument, and aversion to studied obscurities and feigned profundities.\" From Chisholm he learned \"not to fear metaphysics.\" This allowed him to go beyond the logical positivist approaches, that he had learned from Hempel, in his investigations in metaphysics and the philosophy of mind. Although not a logical positivist, Kim's work always respected the limitations on philosophical speculation imposed by the sciences.\n\nKim's philosophical work focuses on the areas of philosophy of mind, metaphysics, action theory, epistemology, and philosophy of science.\n\nKim has defended various mind-body theories during his career. He began defending a version of the identity theory in the early 1970s, and then moved to a non-reductive version of physicalism, which relied heavily on the supervenience relation.\n\nMore recently, he has rejected strict physicalism on the grounds that it is an insufficient basis for resolving the mind-body problem. In particular, he has concluded that the hard problem of consciousness—according to which a detailed and comprehensive neurophysical description of the brain would still not account for the fact of consciousness—is insurmountable in the context of a thoroughgoing physicalism. His arguments against physicalism can be found in his two latest monographs: \"Mind in a Physical World\" (1998) and \"Physicalism, or Something Near Enough\" (2005). Kim claims \"that physicalism will not be able to survive intact and in its entirety.\" This, according to Kim, is because qualia (the phenomenal or qualitative aspect of mental states) cannot be reduced to physical states or processes. Kim claims that \"phenomenal mental properties are not functionally definable and hence functionally irreducible\" and \"if functional reduction doesn't work for qualia, nothing will\" Thus, there is an aspect of the mind that physicalism cannot capture.\n\nKim currently defends the thesis that intentional mental states (e.g., beliefs and desires) can be functionally reduced to their neurological realizers, but that the qualitative or phenomenal mental states (e.g., sensations) are irreducibly non-physical and epiphenomenal. He, thus, defends a version of dualism, although Kim argues that it is physicalism near enough. As of March, 2008, Kim still sees physicalism to be the most comprehensive world view that is irreplaceable with any other world view.\n\nIn a 2008 interview with Korean daily newspaper Joongang Ilbo, Kim stated that we must seek a naturalistic explanation for mind because mind is a natural phenomenon, and supernatural explanation only provides \"one riddle over another\". He believes that any correct explanation for the nature of mind would come from natural science rather than philosophy or psychology.\n\nKim has raised an objection based on causal closure and overdetermination to non-reductive physicalism.\n\nThe non-reductive physicalist is committed to following three principles: the irreducibility of the mental to the physical, some version of mental-physical supervenience, and the causal efficaciousness of mental states. The problem, according to Kim, is that when these three commitments are combined with a few other well-accepted principles, an inconsistency is generated that entails the causal impotence of mental properties. The first principle, which most ontological physicalists would accept, is the causal closure of the physical domain, according to which, every physical effect has a sufficient physical cause. The second principle Kim notes is that of causal exclusion, which holds that no normal event can have more than one sufficient cause. The problem is that a behavior cannot have as its cause, both a physical event and a (supervening) mental event, without resulting in a case of overdetermination (thus violating the principle of causal exclusion). The result is that physical causes exclude mental states from causally contributing to the behavior.\n\nIn detail: he proposes (using the chart on the right) that \"M1\" causes \"M2\" (these are mental events) and \"P1\" causes \"P2\" (these are physical events). \"M1\" has \"P1\" as its supervenience base, and \"M2\" has \"P2\" as its supervenience base. The only way for \"M1\" to cause \"M2\", is by causing its supervenience base \"P2\" (a case of mental-to-physical causation). If \"P1\" causes \"P2\", and \"M1\" causes \"P2\", then we have a case of causal overdetermination. Applying the principle of causal-exclusion, either \"P1\" or \"M1\" must be eliminated as a cause of \"P2\". Given the principle of the causal closure of the physical domain, \"M1\" is excluded.\n\nThe non-reductive physicalist is forced to choose between two unappealing options: one could reject the causal-exclusion principle and claim that in this scenario we are dealing with a genuine case of overdetermination, or one could embrace epiphenomenalism. Kim argues that mental causation can only be preserved by rejecting the premise of irreducibility in favor of reduction; in order for mental properties to be considered causally efficacious, they must be reducible to physical properties.\n\nKim's work in metaphysics focuses primarily on events and properties.\n\nKim developed an event identity theory, but has not defended it recently. This theory holds that events are identical if and only if they occur in the same time and place and instantiate the same property. Thus if one waves ten fingers, several events occur, including the waving of an even number of fingers, the event of waving fingers that are evenly divisible by five, and evenly divisible by ten. Some have criticized his theory as producing too many events.\n\nKim also theorized that events are structured. He is known for a property-exemplification account of events. They are composed of three things: Object(s), a property and time or a temporal interval. Events are defined using the operation [x, P, t].\n\nA unique event is defined by two principles: the existence condition and the identity condition. The existence condition states \"[x, P, t] exists if and only if object x exemplifies the n-adic P at time t\". This means a unique event exists if the above is met. The identity condition states \"[x, P, t] is [y, Q, t`] if and only if x=y, P=Q and t=t`\".\n\nKim is a critic of the \"naturalized\" epistemology popularized by Willard Van Orman Quine in the latter half of the twentieth century. Kim's influential article \"What is 'Naturalized Epistemology'?\" (1988) argues that \"naturalized\" epistemologies like Quine's are not proper epistemologies as they are merely descriptive in scope, while one generally expects an \"epistemology\" to make normative claims about knowledge. Kim argues that mere description of belief-forming practices cannot account for justified belief. (He also argues that to even individuate beliefs, the naturalized epistemologist must presuppose normative criteria of justification.) Naturalized epistemology cannot address the issue of justification, and therefore it does not share the same aspiration as the traditional approach to epistemology.\n\nThe following is a \"partial\" list of publications by Jaegwon Kim.\n\n\n"}

It is undated, but, having been licensed towards the end of 1566 (Arber's \"Transcript of the Stationers' Register,\" i.366), the translation was probably published early in the next year. The work contains several pieces of verse, and on their account Joseph Ritson numbered Alday among the English poets of the sixteenth century (\"Bibliographia Poetica,\" p. 114). The longest piece is entitled ‘A complaint of the pore husbandmen in meter.’ A second edition of the work appeared in 1574, printed by H. Bynneman for Thomas Hacket. From his address to the reader there, we gather that Alday claimed to be the first to use the word theatre in an English book, or to introduce into England the simile comparing human life to the stage. A third edition of the work was published in 1581, and there it was stated that John Alday had ‘perused, corrected, and amended’ the English rendering, ‘the old translation being corrupted.’ The latter part of the book—‘Of the Excellencie of Mankinde’—is frequently referred to by Robert Burton in his \"Anatomy of Melancholie\". A new English translation of the whole work, by Francis Farrer, merchant, was published in 1663.\n\nAn English version of a French summary of Pliny's ‘History,’ which was licensed in July 1566 (Arber's \"Stationers' Register,\" i.314), is also ascribed to Alday.

{"id": "15415657", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15415657", "title": "Leonardo Garzoni", "text": "Leonardo Garzoni\n\nLeonardo Garzoni (Venice, Italy, 1543 – Venice, Italy, March 10, 1592) was a Jesuit natural philosopher.\n\nThe little data we have about Garzoni’s life are the brief notices registered on official documents of the Society of Jesus. From these sources we know that Garzoni was born into a patrician family and that he began his philosophical studies before 1565. About 1566 he joined a congregation near to the Jesuits’ College in Brescia and entered the Society of Jesus in 1567 or 1568. In 1568 he lectured in logic in Parma and in 1573 he was a third–year student in theology in Padua. On June 9, 1579 he took his four vows in Brescia and from 1579 he lived, as a confessor, in Venice. After a stay in Verona (about 1588) he came back to Venice, where he died.\n\nGarzoni’s only extant work, the \"Due trattati sopra la natura, e le qualità della calamita\", is the first known example of a modern treatment of magnetic phenomena. Written in years near 1580 and never published, the treatise had a wide diffusion. In particular, Garzoni is referred to as an expert in magnetism by Niccolò Cabeo, whose \"Philosophia Magnetica\" (1629) is just a re-adjustement of Garzoni’s work. Garzoni’s treatise was known also to Giovanni Battista Della Porta and William Gilbert. Even if the Jesuit is never mentioned, both Della Porta’s \"Magia Naturalis\" (1589) and Gilbert’s \"De Magnete\" (1600) shows a heavy dependence on Garzoni’s treatise. In the case of Della Porta we are facing a blatant plagiarism, as was already remarked by Niccolò Cabeo (\"Philosophia Magnetica\", Praefatio ad lectorem) and Niccolò Zucchi (\"Philosophia magnetica…\", fols. 62v-63r).\n\nThe first treatise, consisting of 17 chapters, contains Garzoni's theory of magnetism. The second treatise contains the description of a number of experiments, presented as 90 conclusions or doubts, and 39 corollaries.\n\nIn the first treatise Garzoni explains the two principal magnetic effects displayed by the loadstone: its tendency to the poles and its interaction with other loadstones, or with iron. Firstly, the author ascertains that the motion towards the poles is a natural one, ascribes it to an internal mover ant its appropriate instrument, which he names the \"qualità delle due facce\" (quality of two faces). The loadstone naturally possesses the quality, or verticity, while iron can acquire it from the stone, becoming magnetized. Iron naturally possesses a similar quality, or 'qualità di una faccia\" (quality of one face), by means of which it is disposed to receive verticity from a loadstone. Once magnetized, iron behaves exactly like a loadstone.\nThe most interesting features concerns Garzoni's description of the way verticity moves the loadstone and the way it alters surrounding bodies, virtually propagating itself outside the stone. Other interesting features arise from the explanation of double nature of the magnetic quality, and from the problem of the location of the geographical magnetical poles.\n\nThe second treatise starts with a classical experiment showing the proper alignment of the loadstone to the poles, followed by a lot of experiences about the interaction between two loadstones, between the loadstone and iron, and about the transmission of the magnetic virtue. Garzoni then considers the diffusion of the magnetic virtue inside the stone, outside it, and inside iron. These results are obtained by magnetizing bodies of different shapes and sizes. In particular, Garzoni considers the behaviour of magnetized iron dust. The behaviour of iron placed in the sphere of action of more loadstones is salso investigated. In the subsequent experiments, Garzoni studies the external diffusion of magnetic virtue by displacing a magnetic needle within the sphere of action. At every point, the direction of the needle gives the direction of the magnetic virtue. The configuration Garzoni obtains coincides with the one theorized in the first treatise (look at the accompanying diagrams displaying the lines of propagation of verticity). Garzoni then studies the behaviour of two magnetized needles, and he investigates the action of non–magnetized iron, the properties of the quality of one face and the alteration of the quality of one and two faces. Finally, he quickly mentions spontaneous magnetization and the loss of verticity.\n\n"}

This means that the Constitution cannot be interpreted in the same way as an ordinary statute. Rather, it must be read within the context of society to ensure that it adapts and reflects changes. If constitutional interpretation adheres to the Framer's Intent and remains rooted in the past, the Constitution would not be reflective of society and eventually fall into disuse. \n\nHowever, \"natural limits\" cannot be granted too elastic a definition. In the Marcotte trilogy, it was held that payments by credit card could not be considered to fall within the federal bills of exchange power, as there had been no shift in how a bill of exchange is defined in Canada.\n\nThe interpretation of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms also makes use of the living tree doctrine. Chief Justice Antonio Lamer stated in \"Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act\", \"If the newly planted 'living tree' which is the Charter is to have the possibility of growth and adjustment over time, care must be taken to ensure that historical materials, such as the Minutes of Proceedings and Evidence of the Special Joint Committee, do not stunt its growth.\"\n\n"}

Finally he came back to his native village, Soleto, where in 1569 he was accused of witchcraft and satanic powers by the Inquisition, was imprisoned for 15 months, and later acquitted.\nIn 1571 he received a visit from Juan of Austria, a commander of the fleet of the Holy League that won the Battle of Lepanto, who wanted to meet the \"old Matteo\".\n\nHe lived his last years in poverty in Soleto, feared and disliked by the people, receiving a pension from the Archbishop of Capua and a support from the “Universitas” of Soleto, which wanted to reward him for his contribution to the education of the citizens.\nHe died in Soleto on 13 June 1582.\n\nMatteo Tafuri was one of the most eminent personalities of Apulia in the 16th century and he remained in the popular culture as a sorcerer and a practitioner of the \"demonic religion\".\nThe magic of Tafuri must be understood as knowledge of natural mysteries through astrology, alchemy and medicine, which could break the \"spell of evil.\"\nHe was defended by Father Stanislao, who said, in his \"critical propositio\", that Tafuri never practiced the demonic magic and that many powerful and wise men came from everywhere attracted by his wide culture.\n\nMatteo Tafuri wrote many works but they were lost by his relatives in the course of the years, and what we have nowadays, except for the \"Pronostico\", is only a list of names.\nHe was a great astrologer and an expert of physiognomy. According to his contemporaries, he based himself on somatic characteristics to know the future events about a person.\nHe was also expert in herbs and medical plants and studied the properties of mandrake to cause apparent death, he studied anesthetic substances and methods of inducing sleep (contained in the \"somnibus\" and \"de insomniandi artificial\") and he has likely used the \"treacle\", an alchemical medicine, to cure sick people when the plague spread throughout the area of Soleto in 1571.\n\nIn his work \"Pronostico\", dated 1571, we learn that Tafuri suggested to the Marquis Giovanni Del Tufo to stick on the shoulders of his sick child some pieces of paper with a psalm of death written on, in order to drive away bad luck and evil forces, a typically ecclesiastical remedy.\n\n"}

Asad was one of the most influential European Muslims of the 20th century.\n\nBy the age of thirteen, young Weiss had acquired a passing fluency in Hebrew and Aramaic, other than his native languages German and Polish. By his mid-twenties, he could read and write in English, French, Persian and Arabic. In Mandatory Palestine, Weiss engaged in arguments with Zionist leaders like Chaim Weizmann, voicing his reservations about some aspects of the Zionist Movement. After traveling across the Arab World as a journalist, he converted to Sunni Islam in 1926 and chose for himself the Muslim name \"Muhammad Asad\"—Asad being the Arabic rendition of his root name Leo (Lion).\n\nDuring his stay in Saudi Arabia, he spent time with Bedouins and enjoyed the close company of Ibn Saud—the founder of modern Saudi Arabia. He also carried out a secret mission for Ibn Saud to trace the sources of funding for the Ikhwan Revolt. Due to these activities, he was dubbed in a Haaretz article as \"Leopold of Arabia\"—hinting similarity of his activities to those of Lawrence of Arabia.\n\nOn his visit to India, Asad became friends with Muslim poet-philosopher Muhammad Iqbal, who persuaded him to abandon his eastward travels and \"help elucidate the intellectual premises of the future Islamic state\". He also spent five years in internment by the British Government at the outbreak of World War II. On 14 August 1947, Asad received Pakistani citizenship and later served at several bureaucratic and diplomatic positions including the Director of Department of Islamic Reconstruction, Deputy Secretary (Middle East Division) in the Foreign Ministry of Pakistan and Pakistan's Envoy to the United Nations.\n\nIn the West, Asad rose to prominence as a writer with his best-selling autobiography, \"The Road to Mecca\". Later, after seventeen years of scholarly research, he published his magnum opus: \"The Message of the Qur'an\"—an English translation and commentary of the Quran. The book, along with the translations of Pickthall and Yusuf Ali, is regarded as one of the most influential translations of the modern era. An ardent proponent of Ijtihad and rationality in interpreting religious texts, he dedicated his works \"to People who Think\". \nIn 2008, the entrance square to the UN Office in Vienna was named \"Muhammad Asad Platz\" in commemoration of his work as a \"religious bridge-builder\". Asad has been described by his biographers as \"Europe's gift to Islam\" and \"a Mediator between Islam and the West\".\n\nLeopold Weiss was born on 2 July 1900 to a Jewish family in Lemberg, Galicia, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire (which is currently the city of Lviv, Ukraine). Weiss was a descendant of a long line of Jewish rabbis; however, his father, Akiva Weiss, broke from tradition and became a lawyer. Leopold received a religious education and was proficient in Hebrew from an early age, as well as familiar with Aramaic. He studied the Jewish Bible or Tanakh, the text and commentaries of the Talmud, the Mishna and Gemara, also delving into the intricacies of Biblical exegesis and the Targum.\n\nAt the age of fourteen he escaped school and joined the Austrian army under a false name. After a week or so, his father traced him with the help of the police, and he was escorted back to Vienna.\n\nAfter abandoning university in Vienna, Weiss drifted aimlessly around 1920s Germany, working briefly for the expressionist film director Fritz Lang (F. W. Murnau, according to \"The Road to Mecca\"). By his own account, after selling a jointly written film script, he splurged the windfall on a wild party at an expensive Berlin restaurant, in the spirit of the times. While working as a telephone operator for an American news agency in Berlin, Weiss obtained a coveted interview with Russian author Maxim Gorky's wife, his first published piece of journalism, after simply ringing up her hotel room.\nIn 1922 Weiss moved to the British Mandate of Palestine, staying in Jerusalem at the house of his maternal uncle Dorian Feigenbaum at his invitation. Feigenbaum was a psychoanalyst, a disciple of Freud, and later founded the \"Psychoanalytic Quarterly\".\n\nHe picked up work as a stringer for the German newspaper \"Frankfurter Zeitung\", one of the most prestigious newspapers of Germany and Europe, selling articles on a freelance basis. His pieces were noteworthy for their understanding of Arab fears and grievances against the Zionist project. He published a small book on the subject in 1924, and this so inspired the confidence of the \"Frankfurter Zeitung\" that it commissioned him to travel more widely still, to collect information for a full-scale book. Weiss made the trip, which lasted two years.\n\nTo gain closer assignments in the Arabic world, Weiss developed an ever-deepening engagement with Islam. This led to his religious conversion in 1926 in Berlin and adopting an Arabic name, Muhammad Asad.\n\nAsad spoke of Islam:\n\"Islam appears to me like a perfect work of architecture. All its parts are harmoniously conceived to complement and support each other; nothing is superfluous and nothing lacking; and the result is a structure of absolute balance and solid composure.\" \n\nMagazine \"Saudi Aramco World\" in a 2002 essay described his journey to conversion in these words: \"Two roads diverged in Berlin in the 1920s: a well-worn one to the West, the other, rarely traveled, to the East. Leopold Weiss, a gifted young writer, traveler and linguist with a thorough knowledge of the Bible and the Talmud and with deep roots in European culture, took the road eastward to Makkah.\"\n\nAfter his conversion to Islam, Asad moved to Saudi Arabia making a journey by camel across the Arabian Desert, from Tayma to Mecca. He stayed there for nearly six years during which he made five pilgrimages. Alongside, he started writing essays for the Swiss newspaper \"Neue Zürcher Zeitung\", and continued to do so till 1934.\n\nAfter the sudden death of his wife Elsa, Asad stayed on in Mecca where, in a chance encounter in the Grand Mosque's library, he met Prince Faysal. On Faysal's invitation, Asad met King Abdulaziz (founder of modern Saudi Arabia); the meeting led to almost daily audiences with the King, who quickly came to appreciate Asad's knowledge, keen mind and spiritual depth. Ibn Saud allowed Asad to visit the Najd region (in the King's company), which was forbidden to foreigners at that time.\n\nIn late 1928, an Iraqi named Abdallah Damluji, who had been an adviser to Ibn Saud, submitted a report to the British on \"Bolshevik and Soviet penetration\" of the Hijaz. In this report, after highlighting Asad's activities in Arabia, Damluji alleged that Asad had connections with Bolsheviks: \"What is the real mission which makes him endure the greatest discomforts and the worst conditions of life? On what basis rests the close intimacy between him and Shaykh Yusuf Yasin (secretary to the King and editor of the official newspaper \"Umm al-Qura\")? Is there some connection between von Weiss and the Bolshevik consulate in Jidda?\"\n\nAccording to Asad, he did finally become a secret agent of sorts. Ibn Saud sent him on a secret mission to Kuwait in 1929, to trace the sources of financial and military assistance being provided to Faysal al-Dawish – an Ikhwan leader-turned-rebel against Ibn Saud's rule. Asad, after traveling day and night through the desert without lighting fire, reached Kuwait to collect first-hand evidence. He concluded that the British were providing arms and money to Ad-Dawish to weaken Ibn Saud for the purpose of securing a 'land route to India' – a railroad from Haifa to Basra ultimately connecting the Mediterranean Sea with the Indian subcontinent. \n\nAsad left Arabia and came to British India in 1932 where he met South Asia's premier Muslim poet, philosopher and thinker Muhammad Iqbal. Iqbal had proposed the idea of an independent Muslim state in India, which later became Pakistan. Iqbal persuaded Asad to stay on in British India and help the Muslims of India establish their separate Muslim state. Iqbal introduced Asad to Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan, a philanthropist and agriculturalist, who, on the advice of Muhammad Iqbal, established the Dar-ul-Islam Trust Institutes in Pathankot, India and Jauharabad, Pakistan. Asad stayed on in British India and worked with both Muhammad Iqbal and Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan.\nAllama Iqbal encouraged Asad to translate Sahih Al-Bukhari in English for the first time in history. Asad responded positively and started making the arrangements for his translation. In order to find a place serene enough to stimulate his intellectual and spiritual cerebration, he arrived in Kashmir during the summer of 1934. There, he met Mirwaiz Mouli Yusuf who became his close friend. While working enthusiastically on his translation, he also set up his own printing press in Srinagar. The first two chapters of his translation were printed in Srinagar. Asad mentions in his book \"Home-coming of the Heart\" that he had a special relationship with Kashmir and that he felt very sad when he left it.\n\nWhen the Second World War broke out in 1939, Asad's parents were arrested and, subsequently, murdered by the Nazis. Asad himself was arrested in Lahore in 1939, a day after the war broke out, by the British as an enemy alien. This was despite the fact that Asad had refused German nationality after the annexation of Austria in 1938 and had insisted on retaining his Austrian citizenship. Asad spent three years in prison, while his family consisting of his wife, Munira, and son, Talal, after being released from detention earlier, lived under the protection of Chaudhry Niaz Ali Khan at the latter's vast estate in Jamalpur, 5 km west of Pathankot. Asad was finally released and reunited with his family in Jamalpur when the Second World War ended in 1945.\n\nAsad supported the idea of a separate Muslim state in India. After the independence of Pakistan on 14 August 1947, in recognition for his support for Pakistan, Asad was conferred full citizenship by Pakistan and appointed the Director of the Department of Islamic Reconstruction by the Government of Pakistan, where he made recommendations on the drafting of Pakistan's first Constitution. In 1949, Asad joined Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs as head of the Middle East Division and made efforts to strengthen Pakistan's ties with the Muslim states of the Middle East. In 1952, Asad was appointed as Pakistan's Minister Plenipotentiary to the United Nations in New York – a position that he relinquished in 1952 to write his autobiography (up to the age of 32), \"The Road to Mecca\".\n\nAsad contributed much to Pakistan's early political and cultural life but was shunned from the corridors of power. He served this country as the head of the Directorate of Islamic Reconstruction, Joint Secretary of the Middle East Division in Foreign Office, Minister Plenipotentiary to the United Nations and organizer of the International Islamic Colloquium. If one delves into the archival material of these government departments, the role played by Asad for his beloved Pakistan can be dealt with in detail.\n\nBy chance, at a reception Asad met Pola, an American of Polish origin who was destined to become his third wife (d. 2007). She was a young, beautiful and intelligent woman. He fell in love with her and when he came to know that she had already embraced Islam he decided to marry her, despite the difference of age and temperament. But under the rules of the Foreign Office, he was bound to get prior permission to marry a non-Pakistani national. He applied through the proper channels but the Governor-General rejected his application. So, he submitted his resignation from the Foreign Service, divorced his Arabian wife (Munira, d. 1978) and in the inspiring company of his new wife, he sat down and wrote his extraordinary The Road to Mecca.\n\nDuring his stay in Switzerland, Asad received a letter from the President of Pakistan, General Ayub Khan, who was a great admirer of his book named The Principles of State and Government in Islam (1961). In a subsequent exchange of letters, he proposed to Asad to come to Pakistan and have the membership of a seven-man group of Muslim scholars – who both supposedly knew the world and were experts on Islam – to advise him with regard to everyday matters as well as the drawing up of a new Islamic constitution for the country. At that time, Asad was immersed in his cherished work on the Qur'an, and so he regretfully declined.\n\nAfter many years, Asad was again invited by another President of Pakistan, General Zia ul-Haq, in 1983 and that was his last visit to this country. When he arrived at Islamabad, which he had not yet seen, he was received at the plane with great honour and escorted to the Presidency. During his sojourn in Islamabad, there was a series of meetings with members of the Ansari Commission in order to prepare a kind of programme for the President for the future. Asad agreed with some, and as usual disagreed with others, which he found retrograde. On one point he was firm and insistent that Muslim women should have exactly the same rights in the political sphere as had men, to the extent of becoming Prime Minister. Asad also spared some time to meet with his surviving friends in Lahore and Islamabad and at the request of the President made several radio and television appearances, as always spontaneous. On his return, he was besieged by letters from literally hundreds of admirers in Pakistan, offering him land, a house, everything but he refused politely, as his concept of Pakistan was beyond all these worldly trivialities.\n\nTowards the end of his life, Asad moved to Spain and lived there with his third wife, Pola Hamida Asad, an American national of Polish Catholic descent who had also converted to Islam, until his death on 20 February 1992 at the age of 91. He was buried in the Muslim cemetery of Granada in the former Moorish province of Andalusia, Spain.\n\nAsad had a son, Talal Asad, from his second Saudi Arabian wife, Munira. Talal Asad is now an anthropologist specializing in religious studies and postcolonialism. Asad also had a step-son named Heinrich (converted name Ahmad) with his first wife Else (converted name Aziza).\n\nIn April 2008, a space in front of the UNO City in the 22nd District of Vienna was named \"Muhammad-Asad-Platz\" in honor of Muhammad Asad. The step was taken as part of a two-day program on the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue focusing on Islam and its relationship with Europe. The program commemorated the life and work of Asad, described as a great Austrian visionary, who earned international recognition by building bridges between religions. The honoree's son Talal Asad, the President of the Islamic Community of Austria Anas Schakfeh and Vienna's cultural adviser Andreas Mailath-Pokorny were present at the unveiling of the square. Mailath-Pokorny, while talking to the media said: \"There is probably no more appropriate place to honor Muhammad Asad than that in front of the UN-City.

{"id": "1519272", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1519272", "title": "Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime", "text": "Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime\n\nObservations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime () is a 1764 book by Immanuel Kant.\n\nThe first complete translation into English was published in 1799. The second, by John T. Goldthwait, was published in 1960 by the University of California Press.\n\n\"Of the Distinct Objects of the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime\"\n\nKant states that feelings of enjoyment are subjective. In this book, he describes his observations. His interest is not in coarse, thoughtless feelings or in the other extreme, the finest feelings of intellectual discovery. Instead, he writes about the finer feelings, which are intermediate. These require some sensitivity, intellectual excellence, talent, or virtue.\n\nThere are two kinds of finer feeling: the feeling of the sublime and the feeling of the beautiful. Kant gives examples of these pleasant feelings. Some of his examples of feelings of the beautiful are the sight of flower beds, grazing flocks, and daylight. Feelings of the sublime are the result of seeing mountain peaks, raging storms, and night.\n\nIn this section, Kant gives many particular examples of feelings of the beautiful and the sublime. Feelings of the beautiful \"occasion a pleasant sensation but one that is joyous and smiling.\" On the other hand, feelings of the sublime \"arouse enjoyment but with horror.\"\n\nKant subdivided the sublime into three kinds. The feeling of the terrifying sublime is sometimes accompanied with a certain dread or melancholy. The feeling of the noble sublime is quiet wonder. Feelings of the splendid sublime are pervaded with beauty.\n\n\"Of the Attributes of the Beautiful and Sublime in Man in General\"\n\nKant described the relationship between these finer feelings and humanity. The feelings are not totally separate from each other. Beauty and the sublime can be joined or alternated. Kant claimed that tragedy, for the most part, stirs the feeling of the sublime. Comedy arouses feelings for beauty. The personal appearance of humans prompts these feelings in various cases. A person's social position also affects these feelings.\n\nHuman nature has many variations of the feelings of the beautiful and the sublime. Some variations of the terrifying sublime are the adventurous and grotesque. Visionaries and cranks are persons who have fantasies and whims. The beautiful, when it degenerates, produces triflers, fops, dandies, chatterers, silliness, bores, and fools.\n\nSympathy or compassion and also good-natured agreeableness are not true virtues, according to Kant. True virtue is the quality of raising the feeling of humanity's beauty and dignity to a principle. When a person acts in accordance with this principle, regardless of inclination, that person is truly and sublimely virtuous.\n\n\"A profound feeling for the beauty and dignity of human nature and a firmness and determination of the mind to refer all one's actions to this as to a universal ground is earnest, and does not at all join with a changeable gaiety nor with the inconstancy of a frivolous person.\" With this observation, Kant will attempt to fit the various feelings of the beautiful and sublime, and the resulting moral characters, into Galen's rigid arrangement of the four humours or human temperaments: melancholic, sanguine, choleric, and phlegmatic.\n\nKant asserted that the human temperaments or dispositions are fixed and separate characters. An individual who has one frame of mind has no feeling or sense for the finer feelings that occur in a person of another temperament. \nAs a whole, human nature in general is a combination of these virtues. As such, it is a splendid expression of beauty and dignity.\n\n\"Of the Distinction of the Beautiful and Sublime in the Interrelations of the Two Sexes\"\n\nIn Section Three, Kant asserts that women predominantly have feelings for all that is beautiful. Men, on the contrary, have mostly feelings for the sublime. Any other feelings that are only for the enhancement of the main feeling. Kant admits, though, that the distinction is not absolute. Since \"we are dealing with human beings; we must also remember that they are not all alike.\"\n\nKant helps to root notions of inequality in the Western social structure. For example, Kant argues that \"a woman is little embarrassed that she does not possess high insights; she is beautiful and captivates, and that is enough ... Laborious learning or painful pondering, even if a woman should greatly succeed in it, destroys the merits that are proper to her sex.\"\n\nWomen's mental ability and understanding, then, refer to the beautiful. Men's deep, noble understanding is not suitable for women. Women have beautiful virtues such as kindness and benevolence. Men's virtue is noble and has to do with principles and duty. Because a woman is concerned with the beautiful, the worst that can be said against her is that she is disgusting. A man's greatest defect, however, would be that he is ridiculous, as this is the opposite of the sublime.\n\nIn sexual selection, a woman demands that the man have noble and sublime characteristics. A man wants a woman to possess beautiful qualities. In a marriage, the husband and wife unite their disparate attributes to form, as it were, a single moral person. The man's understanding combines with the wife's taste to constitute a union.\n\n\"Of National Characteristics, so far as They Depend upon the Distinct Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime\"\n\nHere Kant describes the different ways that various people have finer feelings. He qualifies his remarks by stating, \"[W]hether these national differences are contingent and depend upon the times and the type of government, or are bound by a certain necessity to the climate, I do not here inquire.\"\n\nThe Italians have a strong feeling for the beautiful with some mixture of the thoughtful sublime. The French have mostly a feeling for the beautiful, but with the addition of the joyful sublime. The feeling of the Germans is an almost equal blend of both the beautiful and the splendid sublime in that they are much concerned with outward appearances. The feeling of the noble sublime predominates with the English, whose actions are guided by principles rather than impulses. With their cruel autos-da-fé and harsh conquests, the Spaniards have feeling for the terrifying sublime. Dutch people in Holland have no finer taste and are concerned only with what is useful. Arabs are like the Spaniards. Persians resemble the French. The Japanese are the Englishmen of the Orient. West India displays its love of the grotesque sublime, as also do the Chinese. African Negroes possess no finer feelings. North American Indians, however, have a feeling for the sublime in that they are adventurous, honorable, truthful, proud, brave, and valorous.\n\nIn antiquity, the ancient Greeks and Romans had remarkable feelings for both the beautiful and the sublime. However, with the Caesars, this decayed into a love of false glitter. The subsequent barbarian Gothic civilization had an overpowering feeling for the grotesque. Kant claimed that his time witnessed \"the sound taste of the beautiful and noble blossoming forth both in the arts and sciences and in respect to morals.\" He declared that it is necessary to educate the younger generation so that they will have noble simplicity, high morals, and finer feelings.\n\n\n"}

It is dated to the first century BC . It is believed to have been the meeting place of the neo-Pythagoreans, and is the only historical site that has been associated with the neo-Pythagorean movement. This school of mystical Hellenistic philosophy preached asceticism and was based on the works of Pythagoras and Plato. It was a precursor to the basilicas built during the Christian period, centuries later. It was opened to small groups of visitors only in April 2015.\n\nIt is below the street level. The underground chamber was discovered accidentally in 1917 during the construction of a railway line from Rome to Cassino. An underground passage caved in, revealing the hidden chamber.\n\nThe structure is thought to have been constructed by the Statilius family. The then head of the family, Titus Statilius Taurus, was accused by the Senate for what Tacitus in his Annals called “addiction to magical superstitions”. He protested his innocence but eventually committed suicide in CE53.\n\nThe basilica has three naves lined by six rock pillars and an apse. They are decorated with stucco images of centaurs, griffins and satyrs. Classical heroes such as Achilles, Orpheus, Paris and Hercules are also represented.\n\nOriginally the basilica was entered through a long downhill entrance from the Prenestina Street, and through a vestibule.\n\nIt has undergone a restoration that has taken several years. In 1951 a concrete shell was constructed that enclosed the entire basilica. Air purifiers have been installed to combat radon gas.\n\nThe 40ft-long basilica is now opened to visitors. The visiting groups are kept small because of the fragility of the monument. The temperature and humidity must be kept within a narrow range. It is open during 2nd and 4th Sunday of every month, and the tour must be prearranged.\n\n"}

Adhyatma Upanishad. 14, \nterms Pramada as death itself.\n\nPramada in Sanskrit variously means - negligence, inertia, inadvertence, indolence, idleness, sluggishness, inattentiveness. Pramada produces forgetfulness. It is the root cause of all pains and problems afflicting human-beings.\n\nThe Bhagavad Gita XIV 13,17, lists Pramada (negligence) with Apravrtti (inactivity), Aprakasha (non-illumination) and Moha (delusion) as the products of Tamasi vivrddhe (preponderant state of dullness), which is opposite to knowledge produced by Sattva. The yogasutra ( chapter 1 verse 30 ) includes it in a list of nine causes of mental disturbances.\n\nIn Buddhism, Aceshta (sloth), Apravrtti (inactivity) and Pramada (negligence) are collectively known as Thinamiddha.\n\nIn Jainism, the expression, Yoga, means activity of the mind, speech and body and Pramada-yoga means careless activity of mind, speech and body, and without caution; it is included in Himsa (injury to the vitalities of the mind, speech and body). Asatya (falsehood) and Chaurya (theft) i.e. statement uttered and things taken influenced by Pramada, are also Himsa. There are fifteen kinds of indolence or Pramada which can over-power the human-mind. In the list of five causes of bondage given at Umasvati’s Tattvartha Sutra 8:1, Kasaya (passion) and Pramada (negligence) are listed as independent causes of Bandhahetavah (bondage). In Jainism,s Sarvarthasiddhi – Pramada connotes passion.\n\nAdhyatma Upanishad 14 terms Pramada as death itself, therefore, forgetfulness is death. Pramada is certainly the root cause of downfall, decay and death. Asuras were defeated by Pramada only. as per the concept of Sanatkumara described in Sanatsujiyatam it is declared that Pramada understood as wrong perception of the nature of the world amounts to death (Mahabharata 5.42-45).\n\nSlokas 322 to 329 of Vivekachudamani of Sankaracharya, explain the Advaita Vedanta,s concept of the Sanskrit expression, Pramada.\n\nSankara begins with the instruction that those who are firmly established in Brahman should not be guilty of Pramada i.e. negligence or carelessness about which state Sanatkumara had told Dhritarashtra, was death – pramadam vai mrtyumaham bravimi (I call negligence itself death.) Because fall by negligence is fall from one’s real nature, then forgetfulness arises, the ensues the sense of the “I” in the Anatman the cause of all miseries. Sankara adds that forgetfulness confounds even a learned man through defects of intellect for Maya covers a man who is out-ward-bent even if he has annulled the Panchakoshas. Furthermore, if the mind, outward bent, strays away even in the least from its ideal, it will fall continuously; the one who has fallen comes to ruin then there is no going up. For a man of discrimination and in deep concentration on Brahman, there is no other death than Pramada or inadvertence.\n"}

The name also refers to the Victorines, the group of philosophers and mystics based at this school as part of the University of Paris.\n\nIt was founded in the twelfth century by Peter Abelard's tutor and subsequent opponent, the realist school master William of Champeaux, and a prominent early member of their community was Hugh of St Victor. Other prominent members were Achard of St. Victor, Andrew of St Victor, Richard of St Victor, Walter of St Victor and Godfrey of St Victor, as well as Thomas Gallus.\n\nUnder the rigorous supervision of Hugh, St Victor offered a coherent and structured approach to learning through the cultivation of personal virtue rather than the requisition of knowledge for its own sake. This is exemplified in the schema for the liberal arts laid out in Hugh's \"Didascalicon\", in which he exhorts the reader to \"Omnia Disce\", or to know all. By 1160, the abbey had become a place of retreat from the schools, echoing the original act of weary retirement enacted by William of Champeaux at its founding. By the time of Godfrey, St Victor was primarily concerned with the instruction of its own canons, rather than the emphasis on the extern school operated earlier in the twelfth century.\n<br>The end of the Victorines as a unique force came by 1173, when the reactionary Walter was appointed as prior. Walter launched a furious attack upon the intellectual culture of the school and its members with his \"Contra quatuor labyrinthos Francae\" (Against the Four Labyrinths of France), a denunciation of secular theological teaching. After this violent repudiation of Victorine pedagogical tradition the abbey was, in effect, a self-contained Augustinian priory like any other.\nJan van Ruusbroec submitted his Groenendael Priory to their Rule in 1335, from which stemmed the Brethren of the Common Life and Thomas à Kempis' Devotio Moderna.

{"id": "360830", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=360830", "title": "Shang Yang", "text": "Shang Yang\n\nShang Yang (; ), or Wei Yang Gongsun (; c. 390 – 338 BCE). Born in Wey, Zhou Kingdom, he was a statesman and reformer of the State of Qin during the Warring States period of ancient China. His policies laid the administrative and political foundations that would enable Qin to conquer all of China, uniting the country for the first time and ushering in the Qin dynasty. He and his followers contributed to the Book of Lord Shang, a foundational work of what has modernly been termed Chinese Legalism.\n\nWith the support of Duke Xiao of Qin, Gongsun left his lowly position in Wei (to whose ruling family he had been born, but had yet to obtain a high position in) to become the chief adviser in Qin, where he received the title of Shang (after his fief). His numerous reforms transformed the peripheral Qin state into a militarily powerful and strongly centralized kingdom. Changes to the state's legal system (which were said to have been built upon Li Kui's \"Canon of Laws\") propelled the Qin to prosperity. Enhancing the administration through an emphasis on meritocracy, his policies weakened the power of the feudal lords.\n\nMark Edward Lewis once identified his reorganization of the military as responsible for the orderly plan of roads and fields throughout north China. This might be far fetched, but Gongsun was as much a military reformer as a legal one. Gongsun oversaw the construction of Xiangyang. \n\nThe Shang Yang school of thought was favoured by Emperor Wu of Han, and John Keay mentions that Tang figure Du You was drawn to Shang Yang.\n\nHe is credited by Han Fei with the creation of two theories;\n\nBelieving in the rule of law and considering loyalty to the state above that of the family, Gongsun introduced two sets of changes to the State of Qin. The first, in 356 BCE, were:\n\nGongsun introduced his second set of changes in 350 BCE, which included a new standardized system of land allocation and reforms to taxation.\n\nThe vast majority of Gongsun's reforms were taken from policies instituted elsewhere, such as from Wu Qi of the State of Chu; however, Gongsuns's reforms were more thorough and extreme than those of other states, and monopolized policy in the hands of the ruler. Under his tenure, Qin quickly caught up with and surpassed the reforms of other states.\n\nGongsun introduced land reforms, privatized land, rewarded farmers who exceeded harvest quotas, enslaved farmers who failed to meet quotas, and used enslaved subjects as (state-owned) rewards for those who met government policies.\n\nAs manpower was short in Qin relative to the other states at the time, Gongsun enacted policies to increase its manpower. As Qin peasants were recruited into the military, he encouraged active migration of peasants from other states into Qin as a replacement workforce; this policy simultaneously increased the manpower of Qin and weakened the manpower of Qin's rivals. Gongsun made laws forcing citizens to marry at a young age and passed tax laws to encourage raising multiple children. He also enacted policies to free convicts who worked in opening wastelands for agriculture. \n\nGongsun partly abolished primogeniture (depending on the performance of the son) and created a double tax on households that had more than one son living in the household, to break up large clans into nuclear families.\n\nGongsun moved the capital to reduce the influence of nobles on the administration.\n\nDeeply despised by the Qin nobility, Gongsun could not survive Duke Xiao of Qin's death. The next ruler, King Huiwen, ordered the nine familial exterminations against Gongsun and his family, on the grounds of fomenting rebellion. Yang had previously humiliated the new duke \"by causing him to be punished for an offense as though he were an ordinary citizen.\" Yang went into hiding and tried to stay at an inn. The innkeeper refused because it was against Yang's laws to admit a guest without proper identification, a law Yang himself had implemented.\n\nYang was executed by jūliè (, dismemberment by being fastened to five chariots, cattle or horses and being torn to pieces); his whole family was also executed. Despite his death, King Huiwen kept the reforms enacted by Gongsun. A number of alternate versions of Gongsun's death have survived. According to Sima Qian in his \"Records of the Grand Historian\", Gongsun fled to his fiefdom, where he raised a rebel army but was killed in battle. After the battle, King Hui of Qin had Yang's corpse torn apart by chariots as a warning to others.\n\nFollowing the execution of Gongsun, King Huiwen turned away from the central valley south to conquer Sichuan (Shu and Ba) in what Steven Sage calls a \"visionary reorientation of thinking\" toward material interests in Qin's bid for universal rule.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

A vast body of work is attributed to Falaquera, including encyclopedias of Arabic and Greek philosophies, maqamas, some 20,000 poetic verses, and commentaries on Maimonides’ \"Guide to the Perplexed\". The common theme in Falaquera’s writing was to encourage observant Jews to study philosophy and to appreciate the harmony that existed between Torah and rational truth learned in philosophy. While Falaquera did not advocate teaching the secrets of science and divine sciences to every man, he did advocate the teaching of these truths to a broader range of educated Jewish males than previous proponents of rationalist thinking.\n\nAlthough not much is known about his personal life, it is believed that Falaquera’s \"Sefer ha-Mevakkesh\", The Book of the Seeker, was a semi-autobiographical work representing a time in Falaquera’s life when he underwent a mid-life crisis and moved away from his youthful poetry towards more intellectual works. From this book and other writings it is assumed that Falaquera was never married due to the views on women he expressed. Furthermore, there is no information regarding how he supported himself, although references to poverty in the \"Sefer ha-Mevakkesh\" and other writings may signify his own personal destitution. Another note regarding the tensions that existed between the Jews and non-Jewish nations during Falaquera’s time is seen in the \"Megillat ha-Zikkaron\" and a comment in the \"Sefer ha-Mevakkesh\" about the “difficult times under the powerful hand of the non-Jewish nations who prevailed over us.”\n\nOne of the biggest criticisms by historians concerning Falaquera is that he was not original. Falaquera would not have taken issue with these complaints since he saw his purpose as clarifying, interpreting, and teaching older established philosophical systems to a broader audience of educated Jews. In order to accomplish this task, Falaquera produced many translations and compilations of Greek and Arabic philosophical texts into Hebrew. However, Falaquera did not merely transcribe other texts. He would paraphrase, edit, and weave in commentaries from other authors in order to make the texts more comprehensible and more palatable to an observant educated Jewish audience. In addition, inspired by the debate between David Kimhi, a Maimonidean, and Judah Alfakhar, an anti-Maimonidean, Falaquera wrote the \"Iggeret ha-Vikku’ah\", The Epistle of the Debate, in order to counter the objections of anti-rationalist thinkers and to persuade them of the value of studying philosophy and science. However, this goal was ultimately not successful as evidenced by continued further controversies surrounding Maimonides and rationalist studies. In the \"Iggeret ha-Vikku’ah\", a debate between a traditionally observant Jew, the pietist, and a Jew educated in philosophy, the scholar, is described. Over the course of the dialogue, the scholar showed the pietist that many elements of philosophy do not conflict with the Torah and in fact provide a better understanding of it. Furthermore, the scholar shows the pietist that philosophy should be studied by those educated Jews who will know what teachings of philosophy to disregard and what teachings to incorporate into their understanding.\n\nFalaquera also wrote one of the first commentaries on Maimonides’ \"Guide to the Perplexed\" in order to clarify sections that he felt people were misreading or misinterpreting, despite Maimonides urgings in the Guide that readers not comment or expound upon his work. Falaquera used his robust knowledge of sources to both strengthen and part from Maimonides’ teachings according to his own beliefs. Indeed, Falaquera’s commentary contains some viewpoints in his own name which is rarely seen in Falaquera’s other works.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "237535", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=237535", "title": "Shikantaza", "text": "Shikantaza\n\nThe term \"shikantaza\" is attributed to Dōgen's teacher Tiantong Rujing (1162-1228), and it literally means, \"nothing but (\"shikan\") precisely (\"da\") sitting (\"za\").\" In other words, Dōgen means, \"doing only zazen whole-heartedly\" or \"single-minded sitting.\"\n\n\"Shikantaza\" is the Sino-Japanese reading of the Chinese words \"zhǐguǎn\" 只管 \"by all means; merely, simply; only concerned with\" and \"dǎzuò\" 打坐 \"[Buddhism/Daoism] sit in meditation\". The \"Digital Dictionary of Buddhism\" translates \"shikan\" or \"zhǐguǎn\" 只管 as \"to focus exclusively on\", \"taza\" or \"dǎzuò\" 打坐 as \"to squat, sit down cross-legged\", which corresponds with Sanskrit \"utkuṭuka-stha\", and translates \"shikan taza\" from \"zhǐguǎn dǎzuò\" 只管打坐 (or \"qíguǎn dǎzuò\" 祇管打坐 with qí \"earth god; local god\") as \"meditation of just sitting\", explained as the \"Zen form of meditation chiefly associated with the Sōtō school, which places emphasis on emptying the mind, in contrast to the kōan method\".\n\nJames Ishmael Ford says some authors hypothetically trace the root of \"shikantaza\" \"just sitting\" to vipassana meditation, but \"this is far from certain.\" Japanese has many homophones pronounced \"shikan\", and this etymological mix-up about \"shikan\" 只管 \"only; just\" stems from a more commonly used word that translates the Sanskrit \"\"śamatha\" and \"vipaśyanā\",\" names for the two basic forms of Buddhist meditation: Japanese \"shikan\" 止観 \"concentration and observation\" (as practiced by the Tendai sect), from Chinese \"zhǐguān\" 止觀 \"[Buddhism] keep mental calm while observing the universe\" (cf. the \"Mohe Zhiguan\"), which compounds \"shi\" or \"zhǐ\" 止 \"stop; stabilize; \"śamatha\"\" and \"kan\" or \"guān\" 觀 \"observe; contemplate; \"vipaśyanā\". An instance of the confusion of 止観 for 只管 is Steve Hagen's claim that \"shi\" [Hagen is referring to Dōgen's '只'] means tranquility [= '止'], \"kan\" [Hagen is referring to Dōgen's '管'] means awareness [= '観'], \"ta\" means hitting exactly the right spot (not one atom off), and \"za\" means to sit.\"\n\n\"Just sitting\" is the term that Rujing used for \"silent illumination\" or \"silent reflection\" (Chinese \"mòzhào\" 默照; Japanese \"mokushō\") which may be understood as the integrated practice of shamatha (calming the mind) and vipashyana (insightful contemplation), and was the hallmark of the Chinese Caodong school of Chan. \n\nIt is not merely just the union of calming and insight, which had already been developed within the Tiantai Buddhist tradition in medieval China. Rather, it is a description of the natural essence and function of the mind. In this sense, it can be traced back to the earliest Chan teachings of Bodhidharma.\n\nThe first Chan teacher to articulate silent illumination was the Caodong master Hongzhi Zhengjue (1091—1157), who wrote an inscription entitled \"silent illumination meditation\" (\"Mokushō zen\" 默照禅 or \"Mòzhào chán\" 默照禪). According to Taigen Dan Leighton, this practice is a \"nondual objectless meditation\" which:\n\n...involves withdrawal from exclusive focus on a particular sensory or mental object to allow intent apprehension of all phenomena as a unified totality. This objectless meditation aims at a radical, refined nondualism that does not grasp at any of the highly subtle distinctions to which our familiar mental workings are prone and which estranges us from our experience. Such subject-object dichotomization is understood as artificial, a fabrication. \n\nSilent illumination is also objectless in the sense of not seeking after specific limited goals. The ultimate purpose of spiritual practice, universally awakened heart/mind, cannot be set apart from our own inherent being and our immediate, moment-to-moment awareness.\n\nA. Charles Muller explains that this method, which involved seeking enlightened wisdom through complete stillness of the mind, became \"the main practice of the Sōtō Zen school, where Dōgen characterized it by such terms of as 'just sitting' 只管打坐.\".\n\nShikantaza's origins can also be traced back to silent illumination. However, some teachers see it as different from the teachings of Hongzhi Zhengjue in terms of practice and theory.\n\nIn the thirteenth century, Dōgen Zenji who introduced the Soto School in Japan, used much of Hongzhi's writings on silent illumination to help shed light on what he termed \"shikantaza\". From then on the practice of shikantaza has been primarily associated with the Soto school. While silent illumination is in theory a \"methodless method\", it is important to realize that, the Dogen practice of shikantaza \"took a somewhat different approach.\"\n\nThe Chinese Chán Master Shengyen has stated, that shikantaza is similar to silent illumination.\n\nMaster Shengyen explains the meaning of the term in this way:\nAccording to Merv Fowler, shikantaza is described best as, \nShikantaza is often termed a goalless meditation in quiet awareness, \n\nIn his work \"Fukanzazenji\", Dogen writes of, \nFred Reinhard Dallmayr writes, \nAccording to Master Shengyen, \nThe modern Japanese Zen master, Haku'un Ryōko Yasutani says: \nIn contrast to this opinion, some of the Zen masters in Loori's book \"The Art of Just Sitting\" deride Yasutani's description, giving their own version as the right or correct way to do shikantaza.\n\nConcerning the Rinzai school, John Daido Loori writes, \nHaku'un Yasutani agrees, stating, \nIn Japan, vipassana and shamatha are sometimes used in addition to shikantaza as complementary practices.\n\n\n"}

She was the author of \"The Real World of Technology\", which is based on her 1989 Massey Lectures; \"The Ursula Franklin Reader: Pacifism as a Map\", a collection of her papers, interviews, and talks; and \"Ursula Franklin Speaks: Thoughts and Afterthoughts\", containing 22 of her speeches and five interviews between 1986 and 2012. Franklin was a practising Quaker and actively worked on behalf of pacifist and feminist causes. She wrote and spoke extensively about the futility of war and the connection between peace and social justice. Franklin received numerous honours and awards, including the Governor General's Award in Commemoration of the Persons Case for promoting the equality of girls and women in Canada and the Pearson Medal of Peace for her work in advancing human rights. In 2012, she was inducted into the Canadian Science and Engineering Hall of Fame. A Toronto high school, Ursula Franklin Academy, has been named in her honour.\n\nFranklin is best known for her writings on the political and social effects of technology. For her, technology was much more than machines, gadgets or electronic transmitters. It was a comprehensive \"system\" that includes methods, procedures, organization, \"and most of all, a mindset\". She distinguished between \"holistic\" technologies used by craft workers or artisans and \"prescriptive\" ones associated with a division of labour in large-scale production. Holistic technologies allow artisans to control their own work from start to finish. Prescriptive technologies organize work as a sequence of steps requiring supervision by bosses or managers. Franklin argued that the dominance of prescriptive technologies in modern society discourages critical thinking and promotes \"a culture of compliance\".\n\nFor some, Franklin belongs in the intellectual tradition of Harold Innis and Jacques Ellul who warn about technology's tendency to suppress freedom and endanger civilization. Franklin herself acknowledged her debt to Ellul as well as to several other thinkers including Lewis Mumford, C. B. Macpherson, E. F. Schumacher, and Vandana Shiva. This debt was not without recognizing that this list was largely absent of women. In addition to the Philosophy of technology, she believed that science was \"severely impoverished because women are discouraged from taking part in the exploration of knowledge\".\n\nUrsula Maria Martius was born in Munich, Germany on September 16, 1921. Her mother was Jewish and an art historian and her father, an ethnographer, came from an old German Protestant family. Franklin once stated that her father was an \"Africanist.\" Because of the Nazi persecution of the Jews, her parents tried to send their only child to school in Britain when World War II broke out, but the British refused to issue a student visa to anyone under 18. Ursula studied chemistry and physics at Berlin University until she was expelled by the Nazis. Her parents were interned in concentration camps while Franklin herself was sent to a forced labour camp and repaired bombed buildings. The family survived The Holocaust and was reunited in Berlin after the war.\n\nFranklin decided to study science because she went to school during a time when the teaching of history was censored. \"I remember a real subversive pleasure,\" she told an interviewer many years later, \"that there was no word of authority that could change either the laws of physics or the conduct of mathematics.\" In 1948, Franklin received her Ph.D. in experimental physics at the Technical University of Berlin. She began to look for opportunities to leave Germany after realizing there was no place there for someone fundamentally opposed to militarism and oppression. Franklin moved to Canada after being offered the Lady Davis postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Toronto in 1949. She then worked for 15 years (from 1952 to 1967) as first a research fellow and then as a senior research scientist at the Ontario Research Foundation. In 1967, Franklin became a researcher and associate professor at the Department of Metallurgy and Materials Science University of Toronto's Faculty of Engineering where she was an expert in metallurgy and materials science. She was promoted to full professor in 1973 and was given the designation of University Professor in 1984, becoming the first female professor to receive the university's highest honour. She was appointed professor emerita in 1987, a title she retained until her death. She served as director of the university’s Museum Studies Program from 1987 to 1989, was named a Fellow of the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education in 1988, and a Senior Fellow of Massey College in 1989.\n\nFranklin was a pioneer in the field of archaeometry, which applies modern materials analysis to archaeology. She worked for example, on the dating of prehistoric bronze, copper and ceramic artifacts. One small example of her work in this field regards what was a standing question on the nature of shiny black Chinese mirrors found in high quantities in ancient tombs. Franklin's use of microscopic, etching, electron microprobe and x-ray fluorescence analyses produced evidence that what was thought by some to be a corrosive effect was in fact present in these ancient mirrors (and weapons) at their inception, in dark iron oxides intentionally added near the objects' surfaces. Franklin additionally pulled from historic and literary accounts of black mirrors in Chinese literature to support these findings. Franklin's expertise was also instrumental to dating glass; she guided a study on the remains of blue glass beads in North America remaining from early trade relationships between American Indian tribes and Europe.\n\nIn the early 1960s Franklin was one of a number of scientists who participated in the Baby Tooth Survey, a project founded by Eric and Louise Reiss along with other scientists such as Barry Commoner, which investigated levels of strontium-90—a radioactive isotope in fallout from nuclear weapons testing—in children's teeth. This research contributed to the cessation of atmospheric weapons testing. Franklin published more than a hundred scientific papers and contributions to books on the structure and properties of metals and alloys as well as on the history and social effects of technology.\n\nAs a member of the Science Council of Canada during the 1970s, Franklin chaired an influential study on conserving resources and protecting nature. The study's 1977 report, \"Canada as a Conserver Society\", recommended a wide range of steps aimed at reducing wasteful consumption and the environmental degradation that goes with it. The work on that study helped shape Franklin's ideas about the complexities of modern technological society.\n\nFranklin was also active in the Voice of Women (VOW), now the Canadian Voice of Women for Peace, one of Canada's leading social advocacy organizations. In 1968, she and VOW national president Muriel Duckworth presented a brief to a House of Commons committee asserting that Canada and the United States had entered into military trade agreements without adequate public debate. They argued that these commercial arrangements made it difficult for Canada to adopt independent foreign policy positions such as calling for an immediate U.S. military withdrawal from South Vietnam. In 1969, Franklin and Duckworth called on a committee of the Canadian Senate to recommend that Canada discontinue its chemical and biological weapons research and spend money instead on environmental research and preventive medicine. Franklin was also part of a 1969 VOW delegation that urged the federal government to withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and establish a special agency to oversee Canadian disarmament.\n\nIn the 1980s, Franklin participated in an organized campaign to win the right for conscientious objectors to redirect part of their income taxes from military uses to peaceful purposes. Her 1987 paper, written to support the campaign, argued that the well-recognized right to refuse military service on grounds of conscience should be extended to include the right to refuse to pay taxes for war preparations. Franklin asserted that the freedom of conscience provision of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guaranteed this form of conscientious objection. Her paper was to be part of an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. The lower courts had convicted those withholding part of their taxes of violating the Income Tax Act. In 1990 however, the Supreme Court declined to hear the appeal.\n\nFollowing Franklin's retirement, she and several other retired female faculty members filed a class action lawsuit against the University of Toronto claiming it had been unjustly enriched by paying women faculty less than comparably qualified men. In 2002, the lawsuit was settled when the university acknowledged that many of its female professors had suffered from gender barriers and pay discrimination during their careers. As a result, about 60 retired women faculty received a pay equity settlement intended to compensate them for the lower salaries and pensions they had received.\n\nFranklin continued to have a strong association with the University of Toronto's Massey College as a continuing senior fellow and senior resident. Her many activities include encouraging young women to pursue careers in science, promoting peace and social justice, and speaking and writing about the social effects of science and technology. Many of her articles and speeches on pacifism, feminism, technology and teaching are collected in \"The Ursula Franklin Reader\" published in 2006. Franklin is also the author of \"The Real World of Technology\" which is based on her 1989 Massey Lectures broadcast on CBC Radio.\n\nIn a piece of writing entitled \"Letter to a Graduate Student,\" Franklin encouraged the physics career of a student \"Marcia,\" who is devoted to feminism yet interested in physics and unsure of how to integrate the two. In the letter Franklin extolls the merits of colleague Maggie Benston, whose contributions to feminist thought and pedagogy, Franklin stated, issued from her integrated way of being and philosophical foundation in science. She cites as an example Benston's point that the negative side affects of contraceptive pills are considered tolerable according to present medical practices that are permeated by the patriarchal bias of reductionism. New methodologies are radically needed, she stressed, in concord with Benston's writings. Franklin's trust in relying on scientific principles to navigate even daily struggles such as an environment \"surrounded by jerks\" characterizes the letter's cheerful closing, in which she recommends \"taking field notes\" and imagining oneself as an \"explorer come upon a strange tribe.\" In the letter Franklin mentions as an interested aside the extremely early state of research in solid organic matter, compared to the very well studied condition of solid state physics. She speculates that the neglect of this research area could have a political component, given its benefits to humans rather than to the military.\n\nUrsula Franklin explains in a prelude to her 2006 collection of papers, interviews and talks that her lifelong interest in structures, in what she terms \"the arrangement and interplay of the parts within a whole,\" has been at the root of most of her activities. Looking back after almost 40 years, she adds, \"I can see how I have tried to wrestle with just one fundamental question: 'How can one live and work as a pacifist in the here and now and help to structure a society in which oppression, violence, and wars would diminish and co-operation, equality, and justice would rise?'\" As part of the answer, Franklin turns to the metaphor of mapmaking to explain her intellectual journey. \"Increasingly I found the maps of conventional wisdom inadequate for my travels,\" she writes. \"I became unwilling and unable to orient my life according to national maps depicting the realms of 'them' and 'us,' of good guys and bad guys, of winning, defeating, and being defeated; in short, all those maps drawn up for travel towards private gain and personal advancement.\" Franklin concludes that she has been guided in understanding what she calls \"the real world\" by \"the maps of pacifism and feminism\".\n\nFor her, feminism meant a completely new point of view: \"Feminism isn't an employment agency for women; it's an alternative way of ordering the social space, in which women are the prototype rather than men. It is based on collaboration rather than competition. As a youngster, I still remember my feeling of joy that one could look at the earth differently. That's feminism; everything is differently oriented. Seeing the same world with different eyes.\"\n\nCentral to Franklin's pacifism and her view of life is what she calls \"the Quaker vision of the world\". Individual conscience is at the heart of that vision. So too, is the need to discern appropriate ways of working for peace in each time and place \"rather than relying on a dogma of unvarying rules of conduct\". She notes that for more than 300 years, Quakers have opposed war and violence and have objected to military service and conscription. They have worked on reconciliation, peace research and disarmament and in many countries have won the right for conscientious objectors to perform alternative service instead of taking part in war. Franklin remarks that Quaker principles have not changed, but technology \"has\" changed the nature of war. In a modern technological society she argues, there is no longer a clear boundary between war and peace. War planning is constant during peacetime and when wars are fought, women and children become targets. Nations no longer depend primarily on conscripting military recruits, but rely on advanced weapons systems that are costly to build or acquire. She writes that the arms race is driven by a \"technological imperative\" which requires the creation of an enemy as a permanent social institution:\n\nModern weapons technologies, including the required research and development, are particularly capital-intensive and costly. The time between initial research and the deployment of weapon systems can be as long as a decade, during which the government must provide financial security and political justification for the project. In other words, the state not only provides the funding but also identifies a credible external enemy who warrants such expenditure.\n\nFranklin points out that the technological nature of war requires states to conscript the resources needed to pay for hi-tech devices designed for destruction. Thus, people opposed to war are forced—through taxation—to pay for war preparations even if it violates their individual conscience.\n\nIn her 1987 paper, \"Reflections on Theology and Peace\", Ursula Franklin contends that \"peace is not the absence of war—peace is the absence of fear.\" She asserts however, that fear of war and violence is not the only kind of fear that destroys peace. She includes fears arising for example, from economic insecurity, unemployment and the lack of adequate shelter. Franklin points to what she calls \"the threat system\" which manages people by instilling fear and uncertainty at all levels of society.\nFor her, social justice is the essential element needed to banish fear and bring peace. Justice means freedom from oppression, but it also implies equality for all. \"In God's eyes,\" she writes, \"all creatures have value and are subjects of equal care and love; similarly, in a society of justice and peace, all people matter equally.\" Franklin suggests that in consumer-oriented societies, war and violence are the inevitable result of an acquisitive lifestyle that rejects caring and social justice. She quotes historian Lewis Mumford's observation that during the rise of capitalism, the sins of greed, gluttony, avarice, envy and luxury became cardinal virtues. Mumford goes on to argue that the \"moral change that took place under capitalism can be summed up in the fact that human purposes, human needs, and human limits no longer exercised a directing and restraining influence upon industry: people worked, not to maintain life, but to increase money and power and to minister to the ego that found satisfaction in vast accumulations of money and power.\" Franklin extends Mumford's argument by pointing to new global realities such as militarized economies dependent on weapons production and national borders increasingly closed to refugees. \"Any modern theology of peace,\" she writes, \"must, I think, take into account the worldwide drift towards 'techno-fascism,' the anti-people, anti-justice form of global management and power sharing that is developing around the world.\"\n\nFranklin argues that the end of the Cold War brought two main changes. First, the threat of war between the United States and Soviet Union was replaced by regional wars among smaller states. Second, war was transposed to what Franklin calls \"another key\"—the struggle for global commercial and economic dominance. She asserts that this new form of war is now called globalization and its battlefields are global stock and currency markets. This economic warfare defines the enemy as all those who care about the values of community. \"Whatever cannot be merely bought and sold,\" Franklin writes, \"whatever cannot be expressed in terms of money and gain-loss transactions stands in the way of the 'market' as enemy territory to be occupied, transformed and conquered.\" A main strategy in this kind of warfare is the privatization of formerly public domains such as culture, health care, prisons and education to generate private profit. Franklin contends that the new economic warlords or \"marketeers\" aim, for example, to transform \"the ill health or misery of our neighbours into investment opportunities for the next round of capitalism.\" She argues that marketeers have become occupying forces served by \"puppet governments who run the country for the benefit of the occupiers.\" Franklin has also noted that in democratic politics, the economy is all that seems to matter. \"Canada has almost no foreign policy,\" she says, \"but rather is part of an elaborate network of trade agreements.\"\n\nFranklin recommends that resistance take the form of refusing to speak the language of the occupiers. This language includes such terms as \"stakeholders\", \"users\", \"health-care providers\" and \"consumers of education\" to refer to teachers and students, doctors, nurses, patients and communities. Franklin also calls for resistance through court challenges and \"the creative use of electronic media to bypass the occupation forces' control of information.\" Finally, Franklin is a strong supporter of \"citizen politics\", a civic movement which focuses on practical solutions to common problems—everything from the absence of peace to homelessness and local traffic congestion. Borrowing a Quaker term, Franklin calls on citizens to engage in \"scrupling\", the process of sitting down together to discuss and clarify common moral and political concerns. She writes that citizen politics does not seek to overthrow existing governments but to improve them \"whether those in power like it or not.\" The movement also tries to defend communities against those intent, in Franklin's words, on \"turning the globe into one giant commercial resource base, while denying a decent and appropriate habitat to many of the world's citizens.\"\n\nAgain and again in her writings, speeches and interviews, Ursula Franklin insists that war and its violence are not only morally wrong, but also ineffective, impractical, and costly. During a radio interview broadcast two days after the September 11 attacks in the U.S., Franklin argued that violence nowadays is always unsuccessful even for the powerful who try to use it. \"Nothing has been resolved by violence over the past fifty years,\" Franklin said. \"The rational thinking that force does not work, even for the enforcer, is staring us in the face.\" In a newspaper article published just before the first anniversary of 9/11, Franklin wrote, \"It is crucial to recognize that war and war measures are fundamentally dysfunctional instruments of problem-solving. Violence begets more violence, war begets further wars, more enemies and more suffering.\"\n\nFranklin suggested that it would have been more effective if, instead of launching a War on Terrorism, the U.S. had interpreted the attacks as a political earthquake instead of an act of war. She argued that social and political structures are as inherently unstable as geological ones. \"Geological fissures and human terrorists are created in a context of forces that can be understood and—at times—mitigated. Neither can be eliminated by bombing.\"\n\nFranklin asserts that militarism is the ultimate development of hierarchical social structures and threat-based systems. \"They all work under the implicit assumption that some people matter much less than others, and that all people are of interest only as long as they are needed to support the system or to justify it.\" She notes that many prominent advocates for women's rights such as Jane Addams and Sylvia Pankhurst were pacifists. \"To me, the struggle for women's rights and the opposition to militarism in all its forms are two sides of the same coin.\"\n\nWhen a CBC Radio interviewer suggested to Franklin that her ideas about peace and justice were not connected with what was actually happening in the aftermath of 9/11, she readily agreed. \"Yes, you are quite right. They are totally unconnected. I have spent the best part of my life trying to put these thoughts into the stream that makes decisions, and I've been spectacularly unsuccessful. That, I think, is a reflection on my ability in the climate of the time, not on the value of the thoughts.\"\n\nFor Ursula Franklin, technology is a set of practices in the \"here and now\" rather than an array of machines or gadgets. It is also a comprehensive \"system.\" \"Technology involves organization, procedures, symbols, new words, equations, and, most of all, a mindset.\" Her definition is similar to the French thinker Jacques Ellul's concept of \"technique\". Like Ellul, Franklin asserts that technological methods dominate the modern world. \"Technology has built the house in which we all live,\" she writes, \"today there is hardly any human activity that does not occur within this house.\" As such, technology is a central element of the here and now. \"In the broadest sense of the term, the here and now is our environment, that is, all that is around us—the ever-changing overlay of nature, the built environment, the institutional and social structures within which human activities take place, as well as the activities themselves—'the way things are done around here.'\" Franklin sees her studies of technology as an attempt to understand how technological practices affect the advancement of justice and peace.\n\nAccording to Ursula Franklin, technology is not a set of neutral tools, methods or practices. She asserts that various categories of technology have markedly different social and political effects. She distinguishes for example, between work-related and control-related technologies. Work-related technologies, such as electric typewriters, are designed to make tasks easier. Computerized word processing makes typing easier still. But when computers are linked into work stations—part of a system—word processing becomes a control-related technology. \"Now workers can be timed,\" Franklin writes, \"assignments can be broken up, and the interaction between the operators can be monitored.\"\n\nFranklin extends the distinction between work and control-related technologies to the larger concept of \"holistic\" and \"prescriptive\" ones. This enables her to consider the social implications of \"how\" work is performed. She writes that holistic technologies are usually associated with craft work. \"Artisans, be they potters, weavers, metal-smiths, or cooks, control the process of their own work from beginning to finish.\" Artisans may specialize in a particular kind of product, but they are always in total control of the process of production and each thing they make or create is unique. Prescriptive technologies, on the other hand, break work down into a series of discrete, standardized steps. \"Each step is carried out by a separate worker, or group of workers, who need to be familiar only with the skills of performing that one step.\"\n\nAlthough the division of labour inherent in prescriptive technologies is usually associated with the industrial revolution, Franklin points out that such production methods have been used since ancient times. Chinese bronze casting before 1200 BC for example, required a tightly controlled and closely supervised production process as well as a strict division of labour. Franklin writes that when she studied Chinese bronze casting as a metallurgist, \"the extraordinary social meaning of prescriptive technologies dawned on me. I began to understand what they meant, not just in terms of casting bronze but in terms of discipline and planning, of organization and command.\"\n\nFranklin argues that in modern society, control-related and prescriptive technologies are dominant. \"When work is organized as a sequence of separately executable steps, the control over the work moves to the organizer, the boss or manager,\" she writes. \"In political terms, prescriptive technologies are \"designs for compliance\".\" For Franklin, workers accustomed to following prescriptive rules become used to seeing external control and internal compliance as normal and necessary. They also come to believe that there is only one prescribed way of performing a wide variety of tasks. \"While we should not forget that these prescriptive technologies are often exceedingly effective and efficient, they come with an enormous social mortgage. The mortgage means that we live in a culture of compliance, that we are ever more conditioned to accept orthodoxy as normal, and to accept that there is only one way of doing 'it'.\"\n\nFranklin points out that prescriptive technologies have moved beyond materials production to the realms of administration, government and social services. She argues that tasks which require nurturing or caring for people, in health and education for example, are best done holistically. Yet such tasks are increasingly coming under the sway of prescriptive technologies based on what Franklin calls a production model. Professor Heather Menzies, an admirer of Franklin, describes for example, how nursing tasks are performed in keeping with preset, computerized check lists which leave little discretionary time for dealing with the unexpected or talking with patients who are lonely or distressed. Franklin herself notes that schools and universities test and promote students based on strict production schedules yet \"if there ever was a holistic process, a process that cannot be divided into rigid predetermined steps, it is education.\"\n\nUrsula Franklin rejects the idea that powerful technologies automatically determine the ways in which people live and work. She maintains that the uses of technology are not preordained, but are the result of conscious choices. The dominant prescriptive technologies establish structures of power and control that follow what Franklin sees as male patterns of hierarchy, authoritarianism, competition and exclusion. Female workers are often victims of these patterns. Mechanical sewing machines were introduced in 1851 with the promise that they would liberate women from household drudgery. But when the machines ended up in factory sweatshops to produce cheap clothing, the new technology was used to exploit female workers. \"A strictly prescriptive technology with the classic division of labour arose from the introduction of new, supposedly liberating 'domestic' machines,\" Franklin notes. \"In the subsequent evolution of the garment industry, much of the designing, cutting, and assembling began to be automated, often to the complete exclusion of workers.\" She points to similar examples in other industries. Female operators helped introduce the telephone only to be replaced by automated switchboards after the technology had been successfully established while secretaries struggled to make the early mechanical typewriters function properly, but ended up performing fragmented and increasingly meaningless tasks.\n\n\"Many technological systems, when examined for context and overall design, are basically anti-people,\" Franklin writes. \"People are seen as sources of problems while technology is seen as a source of solutions.\" As a result, people live and work under conditions structured for the well-being of technology even though manufacturers and promoters always present new technologies as liberating. \"The dreams of flight, of fast private transportation, of instant communication across continents, and of helpful machines, all stress liberation from hard physical labour at work or drudgery at home.\" But once technologies are accepted and standardized, they often enslave or displace their users. Franklin argues that work could be made less prescriptive in workplaces that are less rigidly hierarchical if we adopted more holistic practices based on the way women traditionally work in running households for example, or in caring for children.\n\nFranklin asserts that powerful communications technologies have reshaped political and social realities distancing people from each other and their immediate environments. Radio and television for example, transmit messages instantaneously from afar—messages that are separated from people's experiences in the vicinities where they live and work. Franklin calls such messages \"pseudorealities\". She writes they are based on images that are constructed, staged and selected to create emotional effects and the illusion of \"being there\" as a participant, not just as an observer. She asserts however, that one-way communications technologies reduce or eliminate \"reciprocity\", the normal give and take of face-to-face communication.\n\nAccording to Franklin, the selective fragments or pseudorealities that become news stories are produced to attract and hold people's attention by focusing on the unusual over the usual. She acknowledges that no one is forced to watch television or listen to radio; people can explore other channels of communication. But the pseudorealities created by the media are still there \"and the world is structured to believe in them.\" She argues that images from afar have taken over much of our everyday reality like an immensely powerful occupation force. \"And somewhere, someone will have to ask, 'How come the right to change our mental environment—to change the constructs of our minds and the sounds around us—seems to have been given away without anybody's consent?'\"\n\n\"Silence,\" Franklin writes, \"possesses striking similarities [to] aspects of life and community, such as unpolluted water, air, or soil, that were once taken as normal and given, but have become special and precious in technologically mediated environments.\" She argues that the technological ability to separate recorded sound from its source makes the sound as permanent as the Muzak that plays endlessly in public places without anyone's consent. For Franklin, such canned music is a manipulative technology programmed to generate predictable emotional responses and to increase private profit. She compares this destruction of silence to the British enclosure laws which fenced off the commons for private farming.\n\nFranklin maintains that the core of the strength of silence is its openness to unplanned events. Quakers, she writes, worship God in collective silence. \"I think that if any one of you attended a Quaker meeting, particularly on a regular basis,\" she told a 1993 conference on acoustic ecology, \"you would find that suddenly, out of the silence, someone will speak about something that had just entered \"your\" mind. It's an uncanny thing, but the strength of collective silence is probably one of the most powerful spiritual forces.\" Franklin advocates defending the human right to public silence—negotiating one music-free elevator for example, or lobbying for quiet rooms in public buildings. She also recommends starting and ending meetings with a few minutes of silence.\n\nIn 1952, Ursula Franklin married Fred Franklin (born 1921), an engineer of German Jewish ancestry who had been exposed to Quakerism while living in England, where he had been sent to boarding school to escape the Nazis in 1936 and remained until emigrating to Canada in 1948. They had no family in Canada and, after their two children were born, they searched for a spiritual home and joined the Society of Friends (Quakers) in 1964. \"We were pacifists before we were Quakers,\" Franklin says, \"but it was a very easy transition to Quakerism for us, and it has been a very good home and an extended family for us and our children.\" Franklin spent her last years in a nursing home with Fred, who survived her. She died on July 22, 2016 at the age of 94.\n\nIn April 2013, Franklin donated her extensive collection of writings devoted to Chinese culture and history to the Confucius Institute at Seneca College in Toronto. The collection included more than 220 texts, books, publications, and journals interpreting Chinese culture and history from the perspective of Western scholars. It also contained some of Franklin's own working papers and files.\n\nFranklin received numerous awards and honours during her long career. In 1984, she became the first woman at the University of Toronto to be named \"University Professor\", a special title which is the highest honour given by the university. She was named Officer of the Order of Canada in 1981 and a Companion of the Order in 1992. She was appointed to the Order of Ontario in 1990. In 1982, she was given the award of merit for the City of Toronto, mainly for her work in neighbourhood planning. She received an honorary membership in the Delta Kappa Gamma Society International for women educators in 1985. Two years later, she was given the Elsie Gregory McGill memorial award for her contributions to education, science and technology. In 1989, she received the Wiegand Award which recognizes Canadians who have made significant contributions to the understanding of the human dimensions of science and technology. In 1991, she received a Governor General's Award in Commemoration of the Person's Case for advancing the equality of girls and women in Canada. The same year, she received the Sir John William Dawson Medal. She received the 2001 Pearson Medal of Peace for her work in human rights. She has a Toronto high school named after her, Ursula Franklin Academy. In 2004, Franklin was awarded one of Massey College's first Adrienne Clarkson Laureateships, honoring outstanding achievement in public service. She was inducted into the Canadian Science and Engineering Hall of Fame in 2012. She received honorary degrees from more than a dozen Canadian universities including a Doctor of Science from Queen's University and a Doctor of Humane Letters from Mount Saint Vincent University, both awarded in 1985.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2635773", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2635773", "title": "William Ernest Johnson", "text": "William Ernest Johnson\n\nWilliam Ernest Johnson (23 June 1858 – 14 January 1931), usually cited as W. E. Johnson, was a British philosopher and logician mainly remembered for his \"Logic\" (1921–1924), in 3 volumes. In 1924, in volume III he introduced the important concept of exchangeability.\n\nJohnson was born in Cambridge on 23 June 1858 to William Henry Farthing Johnson and his wife, Harriet (nee Brimley). He was their fifth child. The family were baptists and political liberals.\n\nHe attended the Llandaff House School, Cambridge where his father was the proprietor and headteacher, then the Perse School, Cambridge, and the Liverpool Royal Institution School. At the age of around eight he became seriously ill and he developed severe asthma and lifelong ill health. Due to this his education was frequently disrupted.\n\nIn 1879 he entered King's College, Cambridge to read mathematics having won a scholarship and he was 11th Wrangler in 1882. He stayed on to study for the Moral Sciences Tripos from which graduated in 1883 with a First Class degree.\n\nIn 1895 he married Barbara Keymer. After her sudden death in 1904 his sister Fanny moved in with him to care for his two sons\n\nHaving failed to win a prize-fellowship, he spent some time teaching mathematics. His first teaching post was as a lecturer in Psychology and Education at the Cambridge Women's Training College which he held for several years. In 1896 thanks to Henry Sidgwick's efforts he was appointed as University lecturer at the University of Cambridge. In 1902 he was elected a Fellow of King's College, and Sidgwick Lecturer in Moral Sciences. His students included John Maynard Keynes, Frank Ramsey, Ludwig Wittgenstein, C.D. Broad and Dorothy Wrinch. He held these positions for nearly thirty years until his death in 1931.\n\nIn 1923 he was elected a Fellow of the British Academy.\n\nHe died in St Andrew's Hospital, Northampton, on 14 January 1931 and is buried at Grantchester, Cambridgeshire.\n\nJohnson had ill health and was a famous procrastinator and he therefore published little. His major publication was a three volume work \"Logic\" (1921–1924) which was based on his lectures. This may never have been published if it hadn't been for the efforts of Newnham student Naomi Bentwich (1891–1988). Naomi persuaded him to publish, typed and co-edited the manuscript and encouraged him to finish the project. The preface to the first volume carries the acknowledgement: \"I have to express my great obligations to my former pupil, Miss Naomi Bentwich, without whose encouragement and valuable assistance in the composition and arrangement of the work, it would not have been produced in its present form\".\n\n\"Logic\" ensured his election to the British Academy but by his death it appeared dated. Johnson can be seen as a member of the British logic \"old guard\" pushed aside by the \"Principia Mathematica\" of Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell. Yet an article entitled \"The Logical Calculus\" (Johnson 1892) reveals that he had nontrivial technical capabilities in his youth, and that he was significantly influenced by the formal logical work of Charles Sanders Peirce. The article begins as follows:\n\"As a material machine economises the exertion of force, so a symbolic calculus economises the exertion of intelligence ... the more perfect the calculus, the smaller the intelligence compared to the results.\"\nA. N. Prior's \"Formal Logic\" cites this article several times.\n\nJohn Passmore tells us:\n\n\"His neologisms, as rarely happens, have won wide acceptance: such phrases as “ostensive definition”, such contrasts as those between ... “determinates” and “determinables”, “continuants” and “occurrents”, are now familiar in philosophical literature\" (Passmore, 1917, p.346)\n\nJohnson also wrote three papers on economics (1891; 1894; 1913). ‘The Pure Theory of Utility Curves’ (1913) was an important paper, representing \"a considerable advance in the development of utility theory\". Johnson was an influence on his student, John Maynard Keynes. Johnson was a colleague of Keynes's father, John Neville Keynes. He was a Cambridge Apostle.\n\n\n\n"}
