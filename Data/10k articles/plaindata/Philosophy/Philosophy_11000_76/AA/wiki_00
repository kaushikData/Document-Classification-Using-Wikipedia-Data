He is one of the pioneers of using large-scale computing to investigate the formation of large-scale structure in a Universe dominated by dark matter. He later turned his attention to an area he calls “astrobiophysics”, examining a variety of ways that external events in our galaxy may have influenced the course of life on Earth, including analysis of gamma-ray burst events.\n\nBorn in Moundsville, West Virginia, his early scientific interest was in physical chemistry, but later changed to study physics at Bethany College in West Virginia.\n\nHe became active in the antiwar and educational movements of the 60’s, and was drawn into the Unitarian ministry. He attended Starr King School for the Ministry in Berkeley, California and was minister in Tampa, Florida for 7 years. During this time he continued his interest in physics. In 1977 he entered the physics program at the University of Texas at Austin where he met and quickly decided to work with noted cosmologist Dennis W. Sciama. He was among one of three groups who had initiated the numerical simulation of the formation of structure in a Universe dominated by dark matter.\n\nHe received his Ph.D. in 1981, and followed with postdoctoral work with Arthur M. Wolfe at Pittsburgh, with the group of Yakov Borisovich Zel'dovich in Moscow, and as Enrico Fermi Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Chicago. In 1986 he joined the faculty of the University of Kansas, where he has been ever since.\n\nIn 1998-2001, he was active in the “controversy” surrounding evolution in the public school curriculum in Kansas. In 2002, he received the Joseph Burton Forum Award for his central role in organizing public support for the return of modern evolutionary biology to the Kansas public school curriculum \n\nHe is married to Gillian, and has two sons, Christopher and Jesse.\n\nHis work in dark matter focused on the formation of what has come to be called the “cosmic web” from Zeldovich pancakes. In 1983, before the existence of such structure was generally accepted, he and collaborators predicted its existence in a Universe dominated by cold dark matter. Later in the 80’s, he worked with J. Richard Gott on the topology of large-scale structure, then with Sergei Shandarin on the merging of hierarchical clustering models with the Zel’dovich pancake picture as a description of large-scale structure.\n\nBeginning in 2003, he made an abrupt transition into a new area which began by examining the effects the radiation from a gamma-ray burst would have upon the Earth, and attempting to draw a connection with past mass extinction events. This has branched out into examination of comet impacts, solar flares, and other phenomenae. He showed that a 63 million-year oscillation in fossil biodiversity cuts across a variety of data sets and has found clues to its cause, which, however, is still an unsolved problem.\n\nMelott is a member of the Paleontological Society. He was elected Fellow of the American Physical Society “For groundbreaking studies of the origin and evolution of cosmic structure” in 1996, and received its Joseph Burton Forum award for his educational work in 2003. In 2007, he was elected Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science “For distinguished contributions to cosmological large-scale structure, for organizing public support for teaching evolution, and for interdisciplinary research on astrophysical impacts on the biosphere.”\n\n\n"}
{"id": "244119", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=244119", "title": "Androcentrism", "text": "Androcentrism\n\nAndrocentrism (Ancient Greek, ἀνήρ, \"man, male\") is the practice, conscious or otherwise, of placing a masculine point of view at the center of one's world view, culture, and history, thereby culturally marginalizing femininity. The related adjective is \"androcentric\", while the practice of placing the feminine point of view at the center is \"gynocentric\".\n\nThe term \"androcentrism\" was introduced as an analytic concept by Charlotte Perkins Gilman in a scientific debate. Perkins Gilman described androcentric practices in society and the resulting problems they created in her investigation on \"The Man-Made World; or, Our Androcentric Culture\", published in 1911. Because of this androcentrism can be understood as a societal fixation on masculinity whereby all things originate. Under androcentrism, masculinity is normative and all things outside of masculinity are defined as \"other\". According to Perkins Gilman, masculine patterns of life and masculine mindsets claimed universality while female patterns were considered as deviance.\n\nIn the past boys and men were expected to have better formal education than girls and women. Girls and women were less frequently able to read and write than boys and men were; thus, written material tended to reflect the male point of view. Well into the second half of the 20th century young men entered university far more frequently than young women. Some universities such as the University of Oxford consciously practiced a numerus clausus and restricted the number of female undergraduates they accepted. Therefore, \"educated opinion\" risked being androcentric.\n\nIn the majority of societies today, books, magazine articles and book reviews are written predominantly by men and therefore may privilege a male viewpoint. For instance, in 2010 only 37% of the books published by Random House were written by women, and only 17% of the books reviewed by \"The New York Review of Books\" were written by women. Research conducted by VIDA in 2010 found that men wrote the vast majority of articles and book reviews in leading magazines in the United States and the UK.\n\nResearch by Dr. David Anderson and Dr. Mykol Hamilton has documented the under-representation of female characters in 200 top-selling children's books from 2001 and a seven-year sample of Caldecott award-winning books. There were nearly twice as many male main characters as female main characters, and male characters appeared in illustrations 53 percent more than female characters. Most of the plot-lines centered on the male characters and their experiences of life.\n\nThe vast majority of films are written and directed by men. This may result in an androcentric bias, with most films (and film characters) being created from a male perspective. Of the top 250 grossing films in 2007, 82% had no female writers and only 6% had a female director. 70% of all film reviews published in the USA are written by men. Therefore, not only do men have more influence than women over the storyline and characters of most films but also they have the most influence when it comes to publicly reviewing them. Because most film reviewers are male, androcentric films (films from a masculine viewpoint) may tend to receive more glowing reviews than female-centric films.\n\nA 2009 study conducted by the Geena Davis Institute analyzed 122 children's films (released between 2006 and 2009) and found both a male bias 'behind the scenes' of the films as well as a male bias in the content of the films. Of this sample, 93% of directors, 87% of writers, and 80% of producers were male. Therefore, an androcentric (male) perspective was dominant in most of the films. The report argued that the male dominance behind most of the films was connected to a male bias (an androcentric bias) in the content of the films themselves. For instance, the majority (70.8%) of the speaking characters in these films were also male, and female characters were much more likely than male characters to be portrayed as beautiful. The report argued that \"cinematic females are valued more than cinematic males for their looks, youthfulness, and sexy demeanor\".\n\nIn 1985 a group of female artists from New York, the Guerrilla Girls, began to protest the under-representation of female artists. According to them, male artists and the male viewpoint continued to dominate the visual art world. In a 1989 poster (displayed on NYC buses) titled \"Do women have to be naked to get into the Met. Museum?\" They reported that less than 5% of the artists in the Modern Art sections of the Met Museum were women, but 85% of the nudes were female.\n\nOver 20 years later, women were still under-represented in the art world. In 2007, Jerry Saltz (journalist from the New York Times) criticized the Museum of Modern Art for undervaluing work by female artists. Of the 400 works of art he counted in the Museum of Modern Art, only 14 were by women (3.5%). Saltz also found a significant under-representation of female artists in the six other art institutions he studied.\n\nIn literature, the use of masculine language to refer to men, women, intersex, and non-binary may indicate a male or androcentic bias in society where men are seen as the 'norm', and women, intersex, and non-binary are seen as the 'other'. Some examples are forms of address (such as \"Hey guys\" or \"Dear Sirs\") and masculine nouns and pronouns (such as 'mankind', 'man' or 'he') to refer to men, women, intersex, and non-binary. Philosophy scholar Jennifer Saul argued that the use of male generic language marginalizes women, intersex, and non-binary in society. In recent years, some writers have started to use more gender-inclusive language (for instance, using the pronouns they/them, and using gender-inclusive words like humankind, person, partner, spouse, businessperson, fire-fighter, chairperson and police-officer).\n\nMany Latin-based languages in the world are also male-centric. For instance, in Spanish the word \"padres\" (plural of 'father') means 'parents', \"abuelos\" (plural of 'grandfather') means 'grandparents', and \"chicos\" means either 'boys' or 'children'. Pluralized nouns are, if describing a mixed-gender group, assigned male word-endings, pronouns, and adjectives. This dominance of the masculine grammatical form in formation of the plural is a property also of Italian, Portuguese and French.\n\nMany studies have shown that male generic language is not interpreted as truly 'gender-inclusive.' Psychological research has shown that, in comparison to unbiased terms such as \"they\" and \"humankind,\" masculine terms lead to male-biased mental imagery in the mind of both the listener and the communicator.\n\nThree studies by Mykol Hamilton show that there is not only a male → people bias but also a people → male bias. In other words, a masculine bias remains even when people are exposed to only gender neutral language (although the bias is lessened). In two of her studies, half of the participants (after exposure to gender neutral language) had male-biased imagery but the rest of the participants displayed no gender bias at all. In her third study, only males showed a masculine-bias (after exposure to gender neutral language) — females showed no gender bias. Hamilton asserted that this may be due to the fact that males have grown up being able to think more easily than females of \"any person\" as generic \"he,\" since \"he\" applies to them. Further, of the two options for neutral language, neutral language that explicitly names women (e.g., \"he or she\") reduces androcentrism more effectively than neutral language that makes no mention of gender whatsoever (e.g., \"human\").\n\nFeminist anthropologist Sally Slocum argues that there has been a longstanding male bias in anthropological thought as evidenced by terminology used when referring to society, culture and humankind. According to Slocum, \"All too often the word 'man' is used in such an ambiguous fashion that it is impossible to decide whether it refers to males or just the human species in general, including both males and females.\"\n\nThe default images in Western society for 'man' and for 'human being' are usually the same. For example, the 'walking person' light (that indicates when it is safe for pedestrians to cross the road) looks the same as the symbol for 'man' on the door of a male restroom. The typical symbol for 'woman' looks quite different (with long hair and a triangle body to indicate she is wearing a dress).\n\nOn the Internet, many avatars are gender-neutral (such as an image of a smiley face). However, when an avatar is human and discernibly gendered, it usually appears to be male. This indicates that the image of a man (but not that of a woman) is considered to be a normative representation of humankind in general.\n\nIn 2008 Rwanda became the first country in the world to have a female-majority parliament (56% of seats). As of March 2011, Rwanda remains the only country in the world to have a female majority parliament. As of 2015, the global average of women in parliament is 22.1%. In the Nordic countries the proportion of females in parliament is high, about 41.5% on average, but the representation of women in parliament in many other Western countries is much lower (for example, the proportion of women in Congress in the United States of America is 19.6%, and in the United Kingdom it is 32%).\n\nSports media channels such as ESPN and Fox Sports, as well as sports magazines like Sports Illustrated, are assumed to appeal to a predominantly male audience. This is reflected by its advertisers who almost exclusively target men. Men are also most likely to stimulate the sporting economy whether the advertising is targeted non-gender specifically. \"analysis.\"\n\n\n\n"}

He received his advanced musical education at the Eastman School of Music and his doctorate in philosophy at the State University of New York at Buffalo. He is Professor of Philosophy (Emeritus) at Long Island University, former Secretary-General and Past President of the International Association of Aesthetics, and former Secretary-Treasurer of the American Society for Aesthetics. His books and articles in philosophy focus on aesthetics, environmental aesthetics, and ethics. Arnold Berleant is the founding editor of \"Contemporary Aesthetics\", an international on-line journal of contemporary aesthetic theory, research, and application.\n\nAs a philosopher Berleant has written on important aspects of both aesthetic theory and the arts. These include ontological and metaphysical issues, basic theoretical questions such as appreciation and aesthetic experience, and explorations of music, architecture, painting and literature. His first book, \"The Aesthetic Field: A Phenomenology of Aesthetic Experience\" (1970), established the concept of the aesthetic field as a contextual framework within which questions in aesthetics and the arts can be most fully illuminated. Much of his subsequent work has focused on environmental aesthetics, attending both to general issues and to specific kinds of environment. The aesthetics of environment is a theme that he has elaborated and extended in much of his writing. \"In Art and Engagement\" (1991), Berleant exemplified the usefulness of the concept of the aesthetic field by applying it to a range of arts – landscape painting, architecture and environmental design, literature, music, dance, and film. Emerging from these original studies was the recognition that the different arts evoke experiences with their own claims to reality. Moreover, these experiences exhibit an intense, active perceptual involvement that he calls “aesthetic engagement,” which belies the traditional claim of aesthetic disinterestedness.\n\nThe innovative concept of engagement leads to new perspectives on a variety of traditional esthetic topics, including metaphorical language, urban design, music, and metaphysics, and opens less traditional topics, such as virtual reality and social interaction to aesthetic analysis.\nThe body of Berleant’s work challenges the traditional view of philosophical aesthetics, which posits “disinterestedness” as foundational in aesthetic experience. Berleant draws upon both phenomenology and pragmatism for an opposing theory of aesthetic perception based on the notion of engagement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

His father was a surgeon. He had a sister (who later became Sister Monica O'Brien RSCJ, of Wellington) and two brothers, Arthur and Michael, who remained in Christchurch.\n\nIn January 1924, O'Brien commenced his studies as a Jesuit novice at the Loyola Novitiate of the Society of Jesus in Sydney, Australia. There and at Riverview College he also advanced his study of Greek. O'Brien obtained his BA at the National University of Ireland where he also studied music. In 1929, O'Brien went to the Jesuit house of Philosophy at Pullach, a village just outside Munich where, after learning German, and with many German, Austrian and other students from many countries, he embarked on three years of laborious philosophic studes. The Philosophy taught was fundamentally medieval scholasticism, as modified by the sixteenth century Jesuit Suárez. O'Brien's \"best teacher\" was Father Alois Maier who promoted Kant. O'Brien made a special study of Plotinus in relation to the Psychology of art. Karl Rahner was two years ahead of O'Brien but among his companions were Hans Urs von Balthasar, and Alfred Delp. In 1932, at the end of his Philosophy course, O'Brien received minor orders from Cardinal Faulhaber, Archbishop of Munich. He then returned to Sydney and was given the job of coaching young novices who were beginning their university studes. In 1935, O'Brien went to the Louvain in Belgium to study Theology. His most important teacher there was Joseph Maréchal who combined the \"best insights\" of Thomas Aquinas with the transcendental speculations of Kant. \"His teaching set flowing one of the principal streams of present-day Catholic Philosophy and Theology, a stream from which André Marc and Karl Rahner, , Emerich Coreth and Bernard Lonergan have all drunk\". O'Brien read particularly the German theologian and mystic Matthias Scheeben and wrote a theological dissertation on Friedrich von Hügel. O'Brien was ordained a priest in 1938 at Louvain and after spending the first few years of World War II in Jesuit establishments in England and in Ireland, he returned to Sydney in 1941.\n\nIn Australia, O'Brien was appointed to St Patrick's College, Melbourne to teach boys in 1941. It was there that he published a book on the vocation of a Jesuit priest. In 1942 he was appointed to the Jesuit scholasticate at Watsonia to take care of the university studies of the Jesuit scholastics as he had before. On 2 February 1942 he was admitted to his final vows as a Jesuit. In 1943 he was appointed to Corpus Christi College, Werribee (a seminary for the training of secular priests) near Melbourne to lecture in theology. He filled this position until 1949. In late 1947 temporarily and then permanently in 1950 O'Brien was appointed to Holy Name Seminary in his home town of Christchurch. At that time it was a minor seminary with generally 70–90 secondary school age boys boarding there. By 1959, however, the school aspect had been fazed out and the seminary was teaching Philosophy to men who had finished secondary school and were in training to be ordained as secular priests. The result of the change for O'Brien was that he then became a Philosophy lecturer and set about preparing courses in Logic and Theory of Knowledge and the Philosophy of Being. Philosophy hitherto had been taught at Holy Name in programs of a traditional Thomist stamp, whether taught directly from the Catholic textbooks known as \"manuals\", or from private course notes which represented an updated form of the scholastic system. Even in the 1950s, textbooks were still in Latin, with students expected to know enough of the language to make their way through the three-volume \"Summula Philosophiae Scholasticae\" of J. S. Hickey, or, if this was beyond them, with the simplified \"dog Latin\" of the \"Manuale Philosophiae ad Usum Seminariorum\" of Giovanni di Napoli. O'Brien, with his broad interests and education, and his colleagues initiated great changes and he gave Philosophy studies at Holy Name Seminary some standing and \"twenty years of clergy owe, if not an appreciation for scholarship at least an acceptance of it to him.\" O'Brien was well remembered by his students especially for his lectures in logic and metaphysics and for his keen interest in music, art and literature. For many years he supervised the choir at Holy Name Seminary.\n\nO'Brien taught at Holy Name Seminary until it was closed in 1979. He then continued at Holy Cross Seminary, Mosgiel where he lectured in literature and Art. In 1980 his health began to fail and he spent some time at the Home of the Little Sisters of the Poor in Dunedin. He died at the hospice of St John of God in Richmond, New South Wales, on 3 January 1982.\n\nO'Brien made a considerable contribution, especially in journals and book reviews, to the Catholic church in New Zealand. He once recalled an occasion when, as a young Jesuit in Australia, he barely escaped drowning. \"I came to realise that God might call me in early years. I found that I could renounce life, if God so wished. This was a salutary experience – a deepening one.\" He also wrote of the knowledge in every field of learning, and of the enormous change in the church since Vatican II. \"Who can possibly hold that we are simply recalling the stand we took in the past, and adding to it?\" He urged that Catholics should adopt what is needed for each new age. \"We must learn to react to God's call when it is given, and wait for the time when it is ripe.\"\n\n\n"}

The point was established in \"Carltona Ltd v Commissioners of Works.\"\n\nFaced with the requisition of their factory by the war-time government, the factory owners raised a judicial review action to challenge the legality of the requisition order. The order had been made under the auspices of the Defence (General) Regulations 1939, which authorised the Commissioners of Works to requisition such land as they deemed necessary in the national interest. The Regulations specified that the Commissioner's powers were exercisable by, \"inter alia\" the Minister of Works and Planning. The factory owners sought to argue that the requisition was invalid because the order had not in fact been signed by the minister, but by an official within the Ministry of Works and Planning. In rejecting this contention, the Master of the Rolls, Lord Greene, acknowledged the realities of government in the 20th century:\n\nThis statement of the way government operates has only become more true in recent decades as increased state interventionism and juridification have produced a rapid growth in the use of delegated legislation. Clearly, confronted with this reality, it would have been preposterous for the Court to construe the wording of the Regulations so narrowly that only the Minister, in person, could exercise the powers. Thus Lord Greene explained that:\n\nIt should be emphasised that the essence of the \"Carltona\" doctrine therefore lies in the elision of the identity of departmental officials with the relevant Minister. It is emphatically not the case that the Minister has delegated his decision-making power to a subordinate and therefore the doctrine achieves consistency with the principle that Parliament's delegatees have, unless specifically provided by statute, no power to delegate (\"delegatus non potest delegare\").\n\nLord Greene proceeded to reconcile this with the doctrine of parliamentary accountability on the basis that:\n\nDespite suggestions to the contrary by some academic commentators, it seems that there is no restriction on the applicability of the doctrine on account of the nature of the power being wielded. In \"HMA v. Copeland\" it was opined, by the highest criminal court in Scotland that:\n\nHowever, in some instances Parliament has chosen to statutorily override this position by providing that the relevant minister must exercise the power in person.\n\nThe Supreme Court of Ireland has confirmed that the Carltona doctrine applies to its fullest extent to the Irish civil service also- see \"Devanney v\" \"Shields\" [1998] 2 I.R. 230.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6692852", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6692852", "title": "Character Strengths and Virtues", "text": "Character Strengths and Virtues\n\nCharacter Strengths and Virtues (CSV) is a book by Christopher Peterson and Martin Seligman (2004) that attempts\nto present a measure of humanist ideals of virtue in an empirical, rigorously scientific manner.\nIn the same way that the \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\" is used to assess and facilitate research on mental disorders, CSV is intended to provide a theoretical framework to assist in developing practical applications for positive psychology.\n\nCSV identifies 6 classes of virtue (i.e., \"core virtues\"), made up of 26 measurable \"character strengths\":\nThe organization of the 6 virtues and 26 strengths is as follows:\n\nCSV defined character strengths as satisfying most of the ten following criteria. Character strengths are fulfilling; intrinsically valuable, in an ethical sense (gifts, skills, aptitudes, and expertise can be squandered, but character strengths and virtues cannot); non-rivalrous; not the opposite of a desirable trait (a counterexample is steadfast and flexible, which are opposites but are both commonly seen as desirable); trait-like (habitual patterns that are relatively stable over time); not a combination of the other character strengths in the CSV; personified (at least in the popular imagination) by people made famous through story, song, etc.; observable in child prodigies (though this criterion is not applicable to all character strengths); absent in some individuals; and nurtured by societal norms and institutions.\n\nThe introduction of CSV suggests that these six virtues are considered good by the vast majority of cultures and throughout history and that these traits lead to increased happiness when practiced. Notwithstanding numerous cautions and caveats, this suggestion of universality hints that in addition to trying to broaden the scope of psychological research to include mental wellness, the leaders of the positive psychology movement are challenging moral relativism and suggesting that virtue has a biological basis. These arguments are in line with the science of morality.\n\nEach of the 26 character traits is defined behaviorally, with psychometric evidence demonstrating that it can be reliably measured.\nThe book shows that \"empirically minded humanists can measure character strengths and virtues in a rigorous scientific manner.\"\n\nPractical applications of positive psychology include helping individuals and organizations correctly identify their strengths and use them to increase and sustain their respective levels of well-being. Each trait \"provides one of many alternative paths to virtue and well-being.\" Therapists, counselors, coaches, and various other psychological professionals can use the new methods and techniques to build and broaden the lives of individuals who are not necessarily suffering from mental illness or disorder.\n\nFinally, other researchers have advocated grouping the 26 identified character traits into just four classes of strength (Intellectual, Social, Temperance, Transcendent) or even just three classes (without Transcendence). Not only is this easier to remember, but additionally there is evidence that these adequately capture the components of the 26 original traits.\n\nPerspective and wisdom (personified for example by Ann Landers): the coordination of \"knowledge and experience\" and \"its deliberate use to improve wellbeing.\" Many, but not all, studies find that adults' self-ratings of perspective/wisdom do not depend on age. This stands in contrast to the popular notion that wisdom increases with age.\n\nThe virtues presented to some extent mirror the cardinal virtues and theological virtues of Aristotle and Aquinas: hope, faith, charity, prudence, justice, fortitude and temperance, and their respective parts.\n\n\n"}

His disciples included Shri Anandi Ma and Omdasji Maharaj. He was a master of Kundalini Maha Yoga who was responsible for popularizing it in the United States..\n\nKashinath was born in winter of 1878* (Footnote 1) in Durgadi, a village in Bihar, India, to Sampatti Devi Mishra and Ramdahin Mishra. His parents named him \"Kashinath\" after Lord Shiva. Prior to his birth, his mother reported having a vision of Lord Krishna. Devotees in India regard such visions as auspicious signs indicating the coming of a \"great being\".\n\nKashinath grew up in a devout Hindu family. While other children were playing, he was reportedly meditating. By age seven, Kashinath was consumed by questions about identity and mortality. At one point, he reportedly ran away in search of the meaning of death, but was retrieved by his parents and sent to a school. At age 13, Kashinath left home for good to reportedly search for spiritual enlightenment.\n\nFor the next 30 years, Kashinath travelled across India. He ofter visited remote and unsettled areas, seeking saints and yogis living in seclusion to teach him. He would eventually become adept at Mantra, Yantra, Hatha, Raja and Jnana yogic practices and philosophies. At age 27, Kashinath took his vows of renunciation (sannyasa) and received the spiritual name of \"Madhusudandas\". \n\nAlthough he had mastered many yogic paths and practised intense austerities, Kashinath believed that he had failed to attain his ultimate goal of self-realization. In 1921, while practising stringent austerities in a cave on Mount Abu in Rajasthan, Kashinath met his Satguru. Shri Yogiraj Parameshwardas, a master of Kundalini yoga. Shri Parameshwardas bestowed Shaktipat initiation on Kashinath. According to Kashinath, he immediately he attained the highest state of samadhi and his ultimate goal of self-realization.\n\nKashinath recounts that when he opened his eyes three days later, Shri Parameshwardas was sitting before him in the form of Lord Hanuman. Lord Hanuman, was the quintessential devotee of Shri Rama embodying the highest level of bhakti (devotional love), jnana (knowledge of Reality), vairagya (renunciation or detachment) and seva (selfless service). According to And these Divine qualities of Lord Hanuman became the hallmarks of Shri Dhyanyogi Madhusudandas.\n\nThrough the guidance of Shri Parameshwardas, Kashinath became a master of Kundalini Maha Yoga. This would give him the power to awaken the dormant Kundalini in spiritual aspirants, and to then guide their spiritual evolution from subtle levels. In recognition of this attainment, Shri Parameshwardas conferred on Kashinath the honorary title \"Dhyanyogi.\" *(footnote 2)\n\nAfter this, Kashinath carried on his work and teachings in a small ashram which he established in Bandhavad in the Indian state of Gujarat.\n\nIn 1960, Kashinath began widespread public instruction in Kundalini Maha Yoga, conducting group meditations throughout India. For millennia, Shaktipat had been an esoteric path to self-realization, not openly bestowed, or explicitly discussed in ancient Vedic scriptures like the Bhagavad Gita. Kashinath became one of the first teachers of this ancient tradition to openly work at a mass level by bestowing Shaktipat initiation on all who sought it from him. He said: \"“All those who came to me for Shaktipat are worthy, and all of them are my spiritual heirs. For my energy works through them.” \"\n\nIn late 1960s and early 1970s, During a protracted drought and famine in Gujarat, Kashinath collected charitable funds for relief there.\n\nOn 7 December 1971, exhausted by his unceasing efforts for famine victims, Kashinath suffered a dramatic near-death experience (NDE) which he recounted in a pamphlet entitled \"Death, Dying and Beyond\". He reported being taken to a heavenly abode of Lord Rama, his principal devotional deity. But then being sent back by Rama to his \"dead\" body to fulfill his desire to help many people, whose faces were shown to him from that subtle dimension beyond our Earthly \"reality\". After the NDE, Kashinath established a secondary school in Bandhwad, a hospital in a backward area of Bihar to help the needy, and a temple on his small Bandhwad ashram.\n\nIn 1976, Kashinath left India for the first time to expand his worldwide mission, described as helping spiritual seekers and raising humanity's consciousness. Following prior requests from American devotees, Kashinath came to the United States. He traveled around the country teaching meditation and offering Shaktipat. .\n\nDuring Kashinath's four years in the US, he established many local groups and initiated thousands into Kundalini Maha Yoga. In his US lectures, he revealed that during his 1971 NDE he had seen and identified many of the same people who came to him in the West. He said: \"“Many of those faces that I saw in the courtyard of Lord Rama, I have seen here, since I came to America. All of the people I saw are my family, and I have to help them.”\" In introducing Kundalini Maha Yoga to Americans, Kashinath said that it was not a religion but a spiritual practice bringing\" “lasting inner peace and happiness to individuals of any belief or religious affiliation.”\" He describes this path in the book \"“Shakti: An Introduction to Kundalini Maha Yoga.”\"\n\nIn 1980, at age 102, Kashinath returned to India where he spent his remaining years in or near Ahmedabad, in Gujarat.\n\nOn 29 August 1994, the anniversary of Lord Krishna's birth, Kashinath died. To his devotees, it meant that he left his physical. Many of his devotees report that they continue to experience his transformative shakti energy at subtle levels of awareness.\n\nAccording to his devotees, Kashinath displayed extraordinary physical prowess, emanated exceptional spiritual energy, and sometimes demonstrated what Westerners call “miracles”. People witnessed him as a centenarian demonstrating difficult yogic postures – like head stands – and walking so fast that young people had to jog to keep up with his extraordinary pace.\n\nEven after he became physically debilitated, Kashinath reportedly emanated an intense shakti energy field. People (and even objects) touched by or near him were long imbued with this transformative energy. In \"Death, Dying and Beyond\" Kashinath told how three or four different people who attempted to help him during his NDE experience immediately fell unconscious into deep meditative states when they touched his body. Only after he returned to his body to help them were they able to awaken from these states.\n\nKashinath occasionally demonstrated \"miracles\" to foster faith in the Divine. Many of those \"miracles\" were anecdotally reported by his devotees. In his writings and lectures, Kashinath explained that yogic powers (\"siddhis\") might be attained via control of life-force energies, but that they were seldom displayed; that such powers are used \"sparingly and on occasion for humanitarian and other discretionary ends,\" but not \"\"for self-aggrandizement.\" ~ Light on Meditation, Shri Dhyanyogi Madhusudandas, page 71:\"\n\nKashinath was especially interested in scientifically demonstrating yogic powers of mantra and of mind. Accordingly, he presided over scientific demonstrations of how pulse and blood pressure readings of meditators could be influenced by his chanting of powerful Bija (seed) Mantras. Kashinath reportedly demonstrated that he could at will increase or decrease his own blood pressure by his yogic powers.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "525885", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=525885", "title": "Euthyphro dilemma", "text": "Euthyphro dilemma\n\nThe Euthyphro dilemma is found in Plato's dialogue \"Euthyphro\", in which Socrates asks Euthyphro, \"Is the pious (τὸ ὅσιον) loved by the gods because it is pious, or is it pious because it is loved by the gods?\" (10a) It implies that if moral authority must come from the gods it does not have to be good, and if moral authority must be good it does not have to come from the gods – a highly controversial idea at the time Socrates first presented it. \n\nAlthough the argument applied to the many capricious gods of ancient Greece, it has implications for the monotheistic religions of today. \"Is what is morally good commanded by God because it is morally good, or is it morally good because it is commanded by God?\" Ever since Plato's original discussion, this question has presented a problem for some theists, though others have thought it a false dilemma, and it continues to be an object of theological and philosophical discussion today.\n\nSocrates and Euthyphro discuss the nature of piety in Plato's \"Euthyphro\". Euthyphro proposes (6e) that the pious (τὸ ὅσιον) is the same thing as that which is loved by the gods (τὸ θεοφιλές), but Socrates finds a problem with this proposal: the gods may disagree among themselves (7e). Euthyphro then revises his definition, so that piety is only that which is loved by all of the gods unanimously (9e).\n\nAt this point the dilemma surfaces. Socrates asks whether the gods love the pious because it is the pious, or whether the pious is pious only because it is loved by the gods (10a). Socrates and Euthyphro both contemplate the first option: surely the gods love the pious because it is the pious. But this means, Socrates argues, that we are forced to reject the second option: the fact that the gods love something cannot explain why the pious is the pious (10d). Socrates points out that if both options were true, they together would yield a vicious circle, with the gods loving the pious because it is the pious, and the pious being the pious because the gods love it. And this in turn means, Socrates argues, that the pious is not the same as the god-beloved, for what makes the pious the pious is not what makes the god-beloved the god-beloved. After all, what makes the god-beloved the god-beloved is the fact that the gods love it, whereas what makes the pious the pious is something else (9d-11a). Thus Euthyphro's theory does not give us the very \"nature\" of the pious, but at most a \"quality\" of the pious (11ab).\n\nThe dilemma can be modified to apply to philosophical theism, where it is still the object of theological and philosophical discussion, largely within the Christian, Jewish, and Islamic traditions. As German philosopher and mathematician Gottfried Leibniz presented this version of the dilemma: \"It is generally agreed that whatever God wills is good and just. But there remains the question whether it is good and just because God wills it or whether God wills it because it is good and just; in other words, whether justice and Goodness are arbitrary or whether they belong to the necessary and eternal truths about the nature of things.\"\n\nMany philosophers and theologians have addressed the Euthyphro dilemma since the time of Plato, though not always with reference to the Platonic dialogue. According to scholar Terence Irwin, the issue and its connection with Plato was revived by Ralph Cudworth and Samuel Clarke in the 17th and 18th centuries. More recently, it has received a great deal of attention from contemporary philosophers working in metaethics and the philosophy of religion. Philosophers and theologians aiming to defend theism against the threat of the dilemma have developed a variety of responses.\n\nThe first horn of the dilemma (i.e. that which is right is commanded by God \"because it is right\") goes by a variety of names, including intellectualism, rationalism, realism, naturalism, and objectivism. Roughly, it is the view that there are independent moral standards: some actions are right or wrong in themselves, independent of God's commands. This is the view accepted by Socrates and Euthyphro in Plato's dialogue. The Mu'tazilah school of Islamic theology also defended the view (with, for example, Nazzam maintaining that God is powerless to engage in injustice or lying), as did the Islamic philosopher Averroes. Thomas Aquinas never explicitly addresses the Euthyphro dilemma, but Aquinas scholars often put him on this side of the issue. Aquinas draws a distinction between what is good or evil in itself and what is good or evil because of God's commands, with unchangeable moral standards forming the bulk of natural law. Thus he contends that not even God can change the Ten Commandments (adding, however, that God \"can\" change what individuals deserve in particular cases, in what might look like special dispensations to murder or steal). Among later Scholastics, Gabriel Vásquez is particularly clear-cut about obligations existing prior to anyone's will, even God's. Modern natural law theory saw Grotius and Leibniz also putting morality prior to God's will, comparing moral truths to unchangeable mathematical truths, and engaging voluntarists like Pufendorf in philosophical controversy. Cambridge Platonists like Benjamin Whichcote and Ralph Cudworth mounted seminal attacks on voluntarist theories, paving the way for the later rationalist metaethics of Samuel Clarke and Richard Price; what emerged was a view on which eternal moral standards, though dependent on God in some way, exist independently of God's will and prior to God's commands. Contemporary philosophers of religion who embrace this horn of the Euthyphro dilemma include Richard Swinburne and T. J. Mawson (though see below for complications).\n\n\nContemporary philosophers Joshua Hoffman and Gary S. Rosenkrantz take the first horn of the dilemma, branding divine command theory a \"subjective theory of value\" that makes morality arbitrary. They accept a theory of morality on which, \"right and wrong, good and bad, are in a sense independent of what \"anyone\" believes, wants, or prefers.\" They do not address the aforementioned problems with the first horn, but do consider a related problem concerning God's omnipotence: namely, that it might be handicapped by his inability to bring about what is independently evil. To this they reply that God is omnipotent, even though there are states of affairs he cannot bring about: omnipotence is a matter of \"maximal power\", not an ability to bring about all possible states of affairs. And supposing that it is impossible for God not to exist, then since there cannot be more than one omnipotent being, it is therefore impossible for any being to have more power than God (e.g., a being who is omnipotent but not omnibenevolent). Thus God's omnipotence remains intact.\n\nRichard Swinburne and T. J. Mawson have a slightly more complicated view. They both take the first horn of the dilemma when it comes to \"necessary\" moral truths. But divine commands are not totally irrelevant, for God and his will can still affect \"contingent\" moral truths. On the one hand, the most fundamental moral truths hold true regardless of whether God exists or what God has commanded: \"Genocide and torturing children are wrong and would remain so whatever commands any person issued.\" This is because, according to Swinburne, such truths are true as a matter of logical necessity: like the laws of logic, one cannot deny them without contradiction. This parallel offers a solution to the aforementioned problems of God's sovereignty, omnipotence, and freedom: namely, that these necessary truths of morality pose no more of a threat than the laws of logic. On the other hand, there is still an important role for God's will. First, there are some divine commands that can directly create moral obligations: e.g., the command to worship on Sundays instead of on Tuesdays. Notably, not even these commands, for which Swinburne and Mawson take the second horn of the dilemma, have ultimate, underived authority. Rather, they create obligations only because of God's role as creator and sustainer and indeed owner of the universe, together with the necessary moral truth that we owe some limited consideration to benefactors and owners. Second, God can make an \"indirect\" moral difference by deciding what sort of universe to create. For example, whether a public policy is morally good might indirectly depend on God's creative acts: the policy's goodness or badness might depend on its effects, and those effects would in turn depend on the sort of universe God has decided to create.\n\nThe second horn of the dilemma (i.e. that which is right is right \"because it is commanded by God\") is sometimes known as divine command theory or voluntarism. Roughly, it is the view that there are no moral standards other than God's will: without God's commands, nothing would be right or wrong. This view was partially defended by Duns Scotus, who argued that not all Ten Commandments belong to the Natural Law in the strictest sense. Scotus held that while our duties to God (the first three commandments, traditionally thought of as the First Tablet) are self-evident, true by definition, and unchangeable even by God, our duties to others (found on the second tablet) were arbitrarily willed by God and are within his power to revoke and replace (although, the third commandment, to honour the Sabbath and keep it holy, has a little of both, as we are absolutely obliged to render worship to God, but there is no obligation in natural law to do it on this day or that). Scotus does note, however that the last seven commandments \"are highly consonant with [the natural law], though they do not follow necessarily from first practical principles that are known in virtue of their terms and are necessarily known by any intellect [that understands their terms. And it is certain that all the precepts of the second table belong to the natural law in this second way, since their rectitude is highly consonant with first practical principles that are known necessarily\". Scotus justifies this position with the example of a peaceful society, noting that the possession of private property is not necessary to have a peaceful society, but that \"those of weak character\" would be more easily made peaceful with private property than without.\n\nWilliam of Ockham went further, contending that (since there is no contradiction in it) God could command us not to love God and even to \"hate\" God. Later Scholastics like Pierre D'Ailly and his student Jean de Gerson explicitly confronted the Euthyphro dilemma, taking the voluntarist position that God does not \"command good actions because they are good or prohibit evil ones because they are evil; but... these are therefore good because they are commanded and evil because prohibited.\" Protestant reformers Martin Luther and John Calvin both stressed the absolute sovereignty of God's will, with Luther writing that \"for [God's] will there is no cause or reason that can be laid down as a rule or measure for it\", and Calvin writing that \"everything which [God] wills must be held to be righteous by the mere fact of his willing it.\" The voluntarist emphasis on God's absolute power was carried further by Descartes, who notoriously held that God had freely created the eternal truths of logic and mathematics, and that God was therefore capable of giving circles unequal radii, giving triangles other than 180 internal degrees, and even making contradictions true. Descartes explicitly seconded Ockham: \"why should [God] not have been able to give this command [i.e., the command to hate God] to one of his creatures?\" Thomas Hobbes notoriously reduced the justice of God to \"irresistible power\" (drawing the complaint of Bishop Bramhall that this \"overturns... all law\"). And William Paley held that all moral obligations bottom out in the self-interested \"urge\" to avoid Hell and enter Heaven by acting in accord with God's commands. Islam's Ash'arite theologians, al-Ghazali foremost among them, embraced voluntarism: scholar George Hourani writes that the view \"was probably more prominent and widespread in Islam than in any other civilization.\" Wittgenstein said that of \"the two interpretations of the Essence of the Good\", that which holds that \"the Good is good, in virtue of the fact that God wills it\" is \"the deeper\", while that which holds that \"God wills the good, because it is good\" is \"the shallow, rationalistic one, in that it behaves 'as though' that which is good could be given some further foundation\". Today, divine command theory is defended by many philosophers of religion, though typically in a restricted form (see below).\n\nThis horn of the dilemma also faces several problems:\n\n\nOne common response to the Euthyphro dilemma centers on a distinction between \"value\" and \"obligation\". Obligation, which concerns rightness and wrongness (or what is required, forbidden, or permissible), is given a voluntarist treatment. But value, which concerns goodness and badness, is treated as independent of divine commands. The result is a \"restricted\" divine command theory that applies only to a specific region of morality: the deontic region of obligation. This response is found in Francisco Suárez's discussion of natural law and voluntarism in \"De legibus\" and has been prominent in contemporary philosophy of religion, appearing in the work of Robert M. Adams, Philip L. Quinn, and William P. Alston.\n\nA significant attraction of such a view is that, since it allows for a non-voluntarist treatment of goodness and badness, and therefore of God's own moral attributes, some of the aforementioned problems with voluntarism can perhaps be answered. God's commands are not arbitrary: there are reasons which guide his commands based ultimately on this goodness and badness. God could not issue horrible commands: God's own essential goodness or loving character would keep him from issuing any unsuitable commands. Our obligation to obey God's commands does not result in circular reasoning; it might instead be based on a gratitude whose appropriateness is itself independent of divine commands. These proposed solutions are controversial, and some steer the view back into problems associated with the first horn.\n\nOne problem remains for such views: if God's own essential goodness does not depend on divine commands, then on what \"does\" it depend? Something other than God? Here the restricted divine command theory is commonly combined with a view reminiscent of Plato: God is identical to the ultimate standard for goodness. Alston offers the analogy of the standard meter bar in France. Something is a meter long inasmuch as it is the same length as the standard meter bar, and likewise, something is good inasmuch as it approximates God. If one asks why \"God\" is identified as the ultimate standard for goodness, Alston replies that this is \"the end of the line,\" with no further explanation available, but adds that this is no more arbitrary than a view that invokes a fundamental moral standard. On this view, then, even though goodness is independent of God's \"will\", it still depends on \"God\", and thus God's sovereignty remains intact.\n\nThis solution has been criticized by Wes Morriston. If we identify the ultimate standard for goodness with God's nature, then it seems we are identifying it with certain properties of God (e.g., being loving, being just). If so, then the dilemma resurfaces: is God good because he has those properties, or are those properties good because God has them? Nevertheless, Morriston concludes that the appeal to God's essential goodness is the divine-command theorist's best bet. To produce a satisfying result, however, it would have to give an account of God's goodness that does not trivialize it and does not make God subject to an independent standard of goodness.\n\nMoral philosopher Peter Singer, disputing the perspective that \"God is good\" and could never advocate something like torture, states that those who propose this are \"caught in a trap of their own making, for what can they possibly mean by the assertion that God is good? That God is approved of by God?\"\n\nAugustine, Anselm, and Aquinas all wrote about the issues raised by the Euthyphro dilemma, although, like William James and Wittgenstein later, they did not mention it by name. As philosopher and Anselm scholar Katherin A. Rogers observes, many contemporary philosophers of religion suppose that there are true propositions which exist as platonic abstracta independently of God. Among these are propositions constituting a moral order, to which God must conform in order to be good. Classical Judaeo-Christian theism, however, rejects such a view as inconsistent with God's omnipotence, which requires that God and what he has made is all that there is. \"The classical tradition,\" Rogers notes, \"also steers clear of the other horn of the Euthyphro dilemma, divine command theory.\" From a classical theistic perspective, therefore, the Euthyphro dilemma is false. As Rogers puts it, \"Anselm, like Augustine before him and Aquinas later, rejects both horns of the Euthyphro dilemma. God neither conforms to nor invents the moral order. Rather His very nature is the standard for value.\"\n\nThe basis of the false dilemma response—God's nature is the standard for value—predates the dilemma itself, appearing first in the thought of the eighth-century BC Hebrew prophets, Amos, Hosea, Micah and Isaiah. (Amos lived some three centuries before Socrates and two before Thales, traditionally regarded as the first Greek philosopher.) \"Their message,\" writes British scholar Norman H. Snaith, \"is recognized by all as marking a considerable advance on all previous ideas,\" not least in its \"special consideration for the poor and down-trodden.\" As Snaith observes, \"tsedeq\", the Hebrew word for righteousness, \"actually stands for the establishment of God's will in the land.\" This includes justice, but goes beyond it, \"because God's will is wider than justice. He has a particular regard for the helpless ones on earth.\" \"Tsedeq\" \"is the norm by which all must be judged\" and it \"depends entirely upon the Nature of God.\"\n\nHebrew has few abstract nouns. What the Greeks thought of as ideas or abstractions, the Hebrews thought of as activities. In contrast to the Greek \"dikaiosune\" (justice) of the philosophers, \"tsedeq\" is not an idea abstracted from this world of affairs. As Snaith writes:\n\nThe Hebrew stance on what came to be called the problem of universals, as on much else, was very different from that of Plato and precluded anything like the Euthyphro dilemma. This has not changed. In 2005, Jonathan Sacks wrote, \"In Judaism, the Euthyphro dilemma does not exist.\" Jewish philosophers Avi Sagi and Daniel Statman criticized the Euthyphro dilemma as \"misleading\" because \"it is not exhaustive\": it leaves out a third option, namely that God \"acts only out of His nature.\"\n\nLike Aristotle, Aquinas rejected Platonism. In his view, to speak of abstractions not only as existent, but as more perfect exemplars than fully designated particulars, is to put a premium on generality and vagueness. On this analysis, the abstract \"good\" in the first horn of the Euthyphro dilemma is an unnecessary obfuscation. Aquinas frequently quoted with approval Aristotle's definition, \"Good is what all desire.\" As he clarified, \"When we say that good is what all desire, it is not to be understood that every kind of good thing is desired by all, but that whatever is desired has the nature of good.\" In other words, even those who desire evil desire it \"only under the aspect of good,\" i.e., of what is desirable. The difference between desiring good and desiring evil is that in the former, will and reason are in harmony, whereas in the latter, they are in discord.\n\nAquinas's discussion of sin provides a good point of entry to his philosophical explanation of why the nature of God is the standard for value. \"Every sin,\" he writes, \"consists in the longing for a passing [i.e., ultimately unreal or false] good.\" Thus, \"in a certain sense it is true what Socrates says, namely that no one sins with full knowledge.\" \"No sin in the will happens without an ignorance of the understanding.\" God, however, has full knowledge (omniscience) and therefore by definition (that of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle as well as Aquinas) can never will anything other than what is good. It has been claimed – for instance, by Nicolai Hartmann, who wrote: \"There is no freedom for the good that would not be at the same time freedom for evil\" – that this would limit God's freedom, and therefore his omnipotence. Josef Pieper, however, replies that such arguments rest upon an impermissibly anthropomorphic conception of God. In the case of humans, as Aquinas says, to be able to sin is indeed a consequence, or even a sign, of freedom (\"quodam libertatis signum\"). Humans, in other words, are not puppets manipulated by God so that they always do what is right. However, \"it does not belong to the essence of the free will to be able to decide for evil.\" \"To will evil is neither freedom nor a part of freedom.\" It is precisely humans' creatureliness – that is, their not being God and therefore omniscient – that makes them capable of sinning. Consequently, writes Pieper, \"the inability to sin should be looked on as the very signature of a higher freedom – contrary to the usual way of conceiving the issue.\" Pieper concludes: \"Only \"the\" will [i.e., God's] can be the right standard of its own willing and must will what is right necessarily, from within itself, and always. A deviation from the norm would not even be thinkable. And obviously only the absolute divine will is the right standard of its own act\" – and consequently of all human acts. Thus the second horn of the Euthyphro dilemma, divine command theory, is also disposed of.\n\nWilliam James, in his essay \"The Moral Philosopher and the Moral Life\", dismisses the first horn of the Euthyphro dilemma and stays clear of the second. He writes: \"Our ordinary attitude of regarding ourselves as subject to an overarching system of moral relations, true 'in themselves,' is ... either an out-and-out superstition, or else it must be treated as a merely provisional abstraction from that real Thinker ... to whom the existence of the universe is due.\" Moral obligations are created by \"personal demands,\" whether these demands come from the weakest creatures, from the most insignificant persons, or from God. It follows that \"ethics have as genuine a foothold in a universe where the highest consciousness is human, as in a universe where there is a God as well.\" However, whether \"the purely human system\" works \"as well as the other is a different question.\"\n\nFor James, the deepest practical difference in the moral life is between what he calls \"the easy-going and the strenuous mood.\" In a purely human moral system, it is hard to rise above the easy-going mood, since the thinker's \"various ideals, known to him to be mere preferences of his own, are too nearly of the same denominational value; he can play fast and loose with them at will. This too is why, in a merely human world without a God, the appeal to our moral energy falls short of its maximum stimulating power.\" Our attitude is \"entirely different\" in a world where there are none but \"finite demanders\" from that in a world where there is also \"an infinite demander.\" This is because \"the stable and systematic moral universe for which the ethical philosopher asks is fully possible only in a world where there is a divine thinker with all-enveloping demands\", for in that case, \"actualized in his thought already must be that ethical philosophy which we seek as the pattern which our own must evermore approach.\" Even though \"exactly what the thought of this infinite thinker may be is hidden from us\", our postulation of him serves \"to let loose in us the strenuous mood\" and confront us with an existential \"challenge\" in which \"our total character and personal genius ... are on trial; and if we invoke any so-called philosophy, our choice and use of that also are but revelations of our personal aptitude or incapacity for moral life. From this unsparing practical ordeal no professor's lectures and no array of books can save us.\" In the words of Richard M. Gale, \"God inspires us to lead the morally strenuous life in virtue of our conceiving of him as unsurpassably \"good\". This supplies James with an adequate answer to the underlying question of the \"Euthyphro\".\"\n\nAtheism challenges the assumption of the dilemma that God exists (or in the original formulation, that the many gods in Greek religion existed). This eliminates the need to decide whether God is either non-omniscient or arbitrary, and also eliminates the possibility of God as the source of morality.\n\nSecular humanism takes the positive stance that morality is not dependent on religion or theology, and that ethical rules should be developed based on reason, science, experience, debate, and democracy. Some secular humanists believe in ethical naturalism, that there are objective, discoverable laws of morality inherent to the human condition, of which humans may have imperfect knowledge. Others have adopted moral relativism in the sense of meta-ethics – the idea that ethics are a social construct – but nonetheless by way of utilitarianism advocate imposing a set of universal ethics and laws that create the type of society in which they wish to live, where people are safe, prosperous, and happy. These competing resolutions represent different answers to a question similar to the original dilemma: \"Is something inherently ethical or unethical, or is something ethical or unethical because a person or society says it is so?\"\n\nThe other assumption of the dilemma is that there is a universal right and wrong, against which a god either creates or is defined by. Moral nihilism challenges that assumption by rejecting the concept of morality entirely. This conflicts with the teachings of most religions (and thus is usually accompanied by atheism) but is theoretically compatible with the notion of a powerful God or gods who have opinions about how people should behave.\n\nMoral relativism accepts the idea of morality, but asserts that there are multiple potential arbiters of moral truth. This opens the possibility of disagreeing with God about the rules of ethics, and of creating multiple societies with different, equally valid sets of ethics (just as different countries have different sets of laws). \"Normative moral relativism\" asserts that behavior based on alternative systems of morality should be tolerated. In the context of religious pluralism, strong relativism it also opens the possibility that different gods and different belief systems produce different but equally valid moral systems, which may apply only to adherents of those faiths.\n\nIn the song \"No Church in the Wild\" from the album \"Watch the Throne\", rapper Jay Z references the dilemma with the line, \"Is pious pious 'cause God loves pious? Socrates asked whose bias do y'all seek.\"\n\nYale Law School Professor Myres S. McDougal, formerly a classicist, later a scholar of property law, posed the question, \"Do we protect it because it's a property right, or is it a property right because we protect it?\"\n\nSubsequently, in \"United States v. Willow River Power Co.\", 324 U.S. 499 (1945), Justice Robert H. Jackson addressed whether there was a protectable property interest in a head of water lessened by federal action. He stated:\n[N]ot all economic interests are \"property rights;\" only those economic advantages are \"rights\" which have the law back of them, and only when they are so recognized may courts compel others to forbear from interfering with them or to compensate for their invasion. ... We cannot start the process of decision by calling such a claim as we have here a \"property right;\" whether it is a property right is really the question to be answered. Such economic uses are rights only when they are legally protected interests.\n\nThe Court's majority (per Justice Jackson) resolved its version of the Euthyphro dilemma by ruling that property rights exist if courts recognize and protect them, rather than holding that property rights pre-exist and courts merely perceive them. A dissenting opinion, however, considered that property rights existed \"a priori\" and that they dictated the conclusion that courts should (therefore) enforce them.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He has published many books and journal articles outlining his research in this field.\n\nHe is the founder and Editor-in-Chief of the journal \"Nanoethics: Ethics for Technologies that Converge at the Nanoscale\", as well as the Australian Computer Society (ACS) representative on the Technical Committee on Computers and Society. He works closely with the ACS on various projects, including developing case studies to accompany the ACS Code of Ethics, with the case studies linking to clauses outlined in the CoE. He is also the manager of the Centre for Applied Philosophy and Public Ethics (CAPPE) Program on Emerging Technologies: IT and Nanotechnology at Charles Sturt University. He is currently the Senior Professor of Information Technology in the School of Information Studies at Charles Sturt University.\n\n\n\nWeckert has contributed many ideas to Information Ethics, specifically relative to the relationship between the philosophical and applied sides of Information and Computer Ethics.\n\nWeckert has done extensive research on the idea of trust within an online environment. He sums up his theories in his 2005 article, \"Trust in Cyberspace\".\n\nIn the article, Weckert focuses on a few key issues regarding the concept of trust and if and when it may be possible in cyberspace. Trust has both cognitive and non-cognitive aspects: one may feel a certain way about another's trustworthiness without believing it in their mind. Trust opens one up to a degree of risk and is thus indispensable to friendship. Weckert opposes trust with monitoring by arguing that in order for trust to exist there must be limits on monitoring. He argues that a lack of community values or online social norms makes the internet less trustworthy but this obstacle may dissipate over time. He also addresses the hurdles that online anonymity and disembodiment put in front of online trust.\n\nIn terms of the effect trust has on the average person (or digital representation of a person) in an online environment, Weckert's ideas apply similarly. He assesses some factors relevant to video gaming, where trust is often an issue, specifically when playing against human opponents. In his 2005 article, he specifies some methods for obtaining online trust, and his second method focuses on how to do so in the context of e-commerce. Near the end he mentions that developing trust in areas such as chat groups is not as much of a problem because not as much is at stake. This is also true in some cases with respect to online gaming. While gaming certainly does not place as much at stake as a financial transaction, players sometimes have a very strong connection to the game or some part of the game such as their avatar, and for this reason trust is an important factor for them within the game.\n\nWeckert's work with online trust also has significant implications on cheating. Due to the increased sense of community and closeness associated with the establishment of trust in an online environment, occurrences of cheating are likely to decline. In Mia Consalvo's 2007 article on gaining advantages in video games, she states that one sense of cheating can be defined as \"violating the spirit of the game.\" The \"spirit of the game\" is less likely to be violated if each player in the virtual world has some type of trust that the others will respect the game in at least a similar sense to their own. By definition, the spirit of the game would not be violated by the players (or at least minimally violated), therefore by definition this would mean that cheating would at least decline.\n\nIn addition to his work related to trust, Weckert has contributed to many other areas within Information and Computer Ethics. Recently, he has begun research on the application of the precautionary principle to nanotechnology. This research involves a careful analysis of the real and potential risks of developments in nanotechnology, as well as an examination of just what the precautionary principle is.\n\nWeckert has published both books and scholarly journal entries. This is an abridged version of the list of his work, as he has contributed to many other publications including guest editorships, book chapters, conferences, talks, and professional magazines.\n\n\n\n"}

It was founded in 2003 by five individuals, Segyu Choepel Rinpoche, Hillary Brook Levy, Christina Juskiewicz, Pam Moriarty and Lawrence Levy. Juniper calls its approach \"meditation tradition for modern life\" and it emphasizes meditation, balancing emotions, cultivating compassion and developing insight as four building blocks of meditation training.\n\nJuniper holds that Buddhist ideas have enormous potential to benefit modern culture but, to do so, their religious and cultural wrapper must be removed so modern individuals can access these methods in a way that matches their sensibility and psychology. These methods must become integrated into modern culture just as they were in the cultures of India, China, Japan, Tibet and others. The 14th Dalai Lama acknowledged this principle when, in his book \"The Meaning of Life from a Buddhist Perspective\", he wrote \n\nIt is important to adopt the \"essence\" of Buddha's teaching, recognizing that Buddhism as it is practiced by Tibetans is influenced by Tibetan culture and thus it would be a mistake to try to practice a Tibetanized form of Buddhism. \n\nBecause Buddhist ideas value inquiry and critical thinking, Juniper holds that we can apply these to build a bridge from ancient culture to modern life, one that is grounded in tradition but evolved to embrace discovery and modern social norms.\n\nBuddhist thought is not based on a centralized authority but is held in lineages. Juniper's lineage is from an Indo-Tibetan Buddhist tradition dating back over two thousand years to the time of the Buddha. This lineage passed through India and Tibet and came to Juniper through its Brazilian born co-founder Segyu Choepel Rinpoche. In 1984, Segyu Rinpoche was recognized by the 98th Ganden Tripa, the spiritual leader of the Gelug (Dge-lugs) school of Tibetan Buddhism, as a master and holder of a Gelug lineage known as the Segyu (Sed Gyued). Segyu Rinpoche's primary teacher was Kyabje Lati Rinpoche (1922-2010), the former abbot of Ganden Shartse Monastery, under whom Segyu Rinpoche received the full gelong monastic ordination. For over twenty-five years Segyu Rinpoche studied under, and received initiations from, Kyabje Lati Rinpoche, Khensur Tara Tulku Rinpoche and other masters of the Gelug school. In tandem with his training, Segyu Rinpoche studied Tibetan Medicine, a tradition of healing that integrates the philosophy and practices of the Buddhist path. Through Segyu Rinpoche, Juniper works to pass the knowledge and methods of its lineage to others in a manner that propagates those methods in a secular form.\n\n\nJuniper is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization located in Redwood City, California.\n\n"}

It is usually translated as \"seeing one's (true) nature,\" that is, the Buddha-nature.\n\nKenshō is an \"initial\" insight or awakening, not full Buddhahood. It is to be followed by further training to deepen this insight, and learn to express it in daily life.\n\nThe term kenshō is often used interchangeably with satori, which is derived from the verb satoru, and means \"comprehension; understanding\".\n\nThe Chinese Buddhist term \"jianxing\" () compounds:\n\nBuddhist monks who produced Sanskrit-Chinese translations of sutras faced many linguistic difficulties:\nThus, \"jianxing\" was the translation for \"dṛṣṭi-svabhāva\", \"view one's essential nature\".\n\nThe (c. 8th century) Chinese \"Platform Sutra\" (2, Prajñā \"wisdom, understanding\") first records \"jianxing\".\n\nThe Standard Chinese pronunciation \"jianxing\" historically derives from (c. 7th century CE) Middle Chinese \"kiensjäŋ\". Sino-Xenic pronunciations of this term exist:\n\nTranslating \"kenshō\" into English is semantically complex.\n\nSome encyclopedia and dictionary definitions are:\n\nBuddhist scholars have defined \"kenshō\" as:\n\nBuddhist teachers and practitioners have defined \"kenshō\" as:\n\nThe term \"kenshō\" refers to the realization of non-duality of subject and object in general, but the term \"kenshō\" may also be applied in other contexts: \"How do you \"kenshō\" this?\"\n\n\"Kenshō\" is not a single experience, but refers to a whole series of realizations from a beginner's shallow glimpse of the nature of mind, up to a vision of emptiness equivalent to the 'Path of Seeing' or to Buddhahood itself. In all of these, the same 'thing' is known, but in different degrees of clarity and profundity.\n\n\"Kenshō\" is commonly translated as enlightenment, a word that is also used to translate bodhi, prajna, satori and buddhahood. Western discourse tends to use these terms interchangeably, but there is a distinction between a first insight, and the further development toward Buddhahood.\n\nKensho is insight, an understanding of reality as-it-is. Contemporary understanding also describes kensho as an \"experience\", as in \"enlightenment experience\"; the term \"enlightenment experience\" is itself a tautology: \"Kensho (enlightenment) is an enlightenment (kensho)-experience\".\n\nThe notion of \"experience\" fits in a popular set of dichotomies: pure (unmediated) versus mediated, noncognitive versus cognitive, experiential versus intellectual, intuitive versus intellectual, nonrational versus rational, nondiscursive versus discursive, nonpropositional versus propositional.\n\nThe notion of \"pure experience\" (\"junsui kuiken\") to interpret and understand kensho was introduced by Nishida Kitaro in his An Inquiry into the Good (1911), under influence of \"his somewhat idiosyncratic reading of western philosophy\", especially William James, who wrote The Varieties of Religious Experience. Wayne Proudfoot traces the roots of the notion of \"religious experience\" to the German theologian Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768-1834), who argued that religion is based on a feeling of the infinite. The notion of \"religious experience\" was used by Schleiermacher to defend religion against the growing scientific and secular critique. It was adopted by many scholars of religion, of which William James was the most influential. D.T. Suzuki, who introduced Nishida Kitaro to western philosophy, took over this notion of \"pure experience\", describing it as the essence of all religions, but best represented in the superior Japanese culture and religion.\n\nThe influence of western psychology and philosophy on Japanese Buddhism was due to the persecution of Buddhism at the beginning of the Meiji Restoration, and the subsequent efforts to construct a New Buddhism (\"shin bukkyo\"), adapted to the modern times. It was this New Buddhism which has shaped the understanding of Zen in the west, especially through the writings of D.T. Suzuki and the Sanbo Kyodan, an exponent of the Meiji-era opening of Zen-training for lay-followers.\n\nThe notion of \"experience\" has been criticised. Robert Sharf points out that \"experience\" is a typical western term, which has found its way into Asian religiosity via western influences. The notion of \"experience\" introduces a false notion of duality between \"experiencer\" and \"experienced\", where-as the essence of kensho is the realisation of the \"non-duality\" of observer and observed. \"Pure experience\" does not exist; all experience is mediated by intellectual and cognitive activity. The specific teachings and practices of a specific tradition may even determine what \"experience\" someone has, which means that this \"experience\" is not the \"proof\" of the teaching, but a \"result\" of the teaching. A pure consciousness without concepts, reached by \"cleaning the doors of perception\", would be an overwhelming chaos of sensory input without coherence.\nThe notion of \"experience\" also over-emphasises kensho, as if it were the single goal of Zen-training, where-as the Zen-tradition clearly states that \"the stink of Zen\" has to be removed and the \"experience\" of kensho has to be integrated into daily life. In the Rinzai-school this post-satori training includes the study and mastering of great amounts of classical Chinese poetry, which is far from \"universal\" and culture-transcending. On the contrary, it demands an education in culture-specific language and behaviour, which is measured by specific and strict cultural norms. Emphasising \"experience\" \"reduces the sophisticated dialectic of Ch'an/Zen doctrine and praxis to a mere \"means\" or set of techniques intended to inculcate such experiences\".\n\nThe classical Zen-texts, such as the \"Kao-seng-chuan\" (Biographies of Eminent Monks) and the transmission lists, called \"Transmission of the Lamp\" the \"yü-lü\" genre (the recorded sayings of the masters, such as the Linji yü lü); and the various koan-collections, contain accounts of \"enlightenment experiences\". These accounts are not verbatim recordings of such \"experiences\", but well-edited texts, written down decades or even decennia after the supposed sayings and meetings.\n\n\"The Denkōroku\", \"The Record of the Transmission of the Light\", written by Keizan Jōkin 瑩山紹瑾 (1268–1325), is an example of the \"Transmission of the Lamp\" genre. It contains literary accounts of the patriarchs of the Soto-lineage, from Shakyamuni Buddha to Koun Ejō, in which kensho plays a central role. They are not to be taken as literal accounts of awakening, but as stories underpinning the legitimacy of the Dogen-shu, which in its early history had seen a fierce internal conflict over the correct lineage during the Sandai sōron.\n\nThe Denkoroku gives the following account of Dogen's awakening:\nAlthough the Zen tradition is reluctant to speak openly about the 'experience' of kensho, personal accounts can be found in Zen-texts.\n\nHakuin gives this description of his first kensho, when he was 21:\nHakuin's \"kensho\" was not approved by Shoju Rojin, who subjected Hakuin to more koan-training. This resulted in a second kensho, where-after Hakuin left Shoju Rojin. It was only when he was 41 that he attained \"his final great enlightenment\":\nKeido Fukushima, a 20th-century Rinzai abbott, gives the following description:\nOther accounts can be found throughout the Zen-literature.\n\nKenshō may be attained without the aid of a teacher. For example, Richard Clarke (1933), who studied with Philip Kapleau, states that he had a spontaneous kensho when he was 13. Dennis Genpo Merzel states he had what he described as an \"awakening experience\" in 1971:\nMore descriptions of \"spontaneous kensho\" can be found throughout the Zen-literature, while a classic example may be Ramana Maharshi's awakening.\n\nAccording to Harris, working towards kensho is usually a lengthy process stretched out over years or even decades. Contrary to this, Victor Hori notes that with koan-study kensho may appear within six months.\nSōtō tends towards a gradual approach, preferring to let the experiences happen on their own. Rinzai tends toward the use of Koans as a technique to unroot the habitual workings of the mind.\n\nDuring intensive zazen various hallucinations and psychological disturbances may arise. These are referred to as makyo. Distinguishing these delusions from actual kensho is the primary function of the teacher, as the student may be erroneously convinced they have realized kensho.\n\nIn the Rinzai school, kensho is seen as indispensable:\nIn the Rinzai-training, the student is expected to pour oneself totally into both koan-study and daily activities 'to become one' with it. Kenshō is used to describe the first breakthrough in kōan study.\n\nIn the Sōtō school there are two kinds of awakening. One is the practice of shikantaza, which is the \"actual enlightened activity of the Buddha\". The other is the accumulation of little bits of understanding, which come together, giving way to a deeper intuitive knowledge.\n\nThe \"genjo-koan\", or the \"koan of everyday life\" which \"appears naturally in daily life\", is emphasized. Students are not encouraged to actively seek out kenshō experiences. In Sōtō practice kenshōs \"are allowed to occur naturally, as a by-product of practice. Meditative training is seen as the unfolding of one great \"kenshō\":\nKenshō also plays a central in the Sanbō Kyōdan, a Japanese Zen organisation which played a decisive role in the transmission of Zen to the United States. Yasutani, the founder of the Sanbo Kyodan, was disappointed about the lack of interest in kensho in the Soto school. Yasutani's emphasis on koan training and the importance of kensho was transmitted to his American students:\nIt is also reflected in the inclusion of a relative great amount of kensho stories in \"The Three Pillars of Zen\", written by Philip Kapleau, a student of Yasutani.\n\nZen Buddhist training does not end with kenshō. Practice is to be continued to deepen the insight and to express it in daily life. According to the contemporary Chan Master Sheng Yen:\nAnd the contemporary western Rev. Master Jiyu-Kennett:\nTo deepen the initial insight of kensho, shikantaza and kōan-study are necessary. This trajectory of initial insight followed by a gradual deepening and ripening is expressed by Linji Yixuan in his Three mysterious Gates, the Four Ways of Knowing of Hakuin, and the Ten Ox-Herding Pictures which detail the steps on the Path.\n\nPost-awakening practice is called \"seitai choyo\", the \"long nurturing of the sacred fetus\". According to Spiegelberg,\nDuring the T'ang-era, the term became associated with the ideal of the recluse who leaves the world. An ideal period of \"twenty years\" was taken for it, echoing a story from the \"Lotus Sutra\" about a prodigal son who wandered in poverty for twenty years before returning home. References to these twenty years are found throughout the Chán-tradition, for example Linji, who is reported to have studied under Huang-po for twenty years, and Daito, the founder of Daitoku-ji, who famoulsy spent twenty years living under a bridge with beggars.\n\nAccording to Hakuin, the main aim of \"post-satori practice\" (\"gogo no shugyo\" or \"kojo\", \"going beyond\") is to cultivate the \"Mind of Enlightenment\", \"benefiting others by giving them the gift of the Dharma teaching\". According to Yamada Koun, \"if you cannot weep with a person who is crying, there is no kensho\". And according to Barry \nOne also has to purify oneself by ongoing practice, since \nAnd \"experience\" has to be supplemented by intellectual understanding and study of the Buddhist teachings; otherwise one remains a \"zen temma\", a \"Zen devil\". Finally, these efforts are to result in a natural, effortless, down-to-earth state of being, the \"ultimate liberation\", \"knowing without any kind of defilement\".\n\nKenshō is described as appearing suddenly, upon an interaction with someone else, at hearing or reading some significant phrase, or at the perceiving of an unexpected sound or sight. The idea of \"sudden insight\" has been hotly debated in the history of Zen. It became part of the Traditional Zen Narrative in the 8th century.\n\nChinul, a 12th-century Korean Seon master, emphasized that insight into our true nature is sudden, but is to be followed by practice to ripen the insight and attain full Buddhahood. The contemporary Korean Seon master Seongcheol opposed this, emphasizing \"sudden enlightenment, sudden cultivation\". But Jiyu-Kennett, a contemporary western teacher, warns that attaining kenshō does not mean that a person is free from morality, the laws of karma, or the consequences of ones actions. This warning is reflected in the Wild fox koan.\n\nKenshō may be attained without the aid of a teacher, as in the case of mushi-dokugo or (mushi-)dokkaku, a self-awakened pratyeka-buddha.\n\nThough the literal meaning is self-awakened, or awakened on one's own, the emphasis in Zen, when using these terms, lies in the ultimate reliance on one's own insight, instead of the authority of a teacher:\nWhile the Japanese term \"kenshō\" is generally used by practitioners of Zen Buddhism, the insight it refers to is not limited to Japanese Zen Buddhism, or even to Buddhism in general.\n\nThe Theravada tradition, which is best known in the west through the modern Vipassana movement, discerns four stages of enlightenment, in which Nirvana is being reached in four succeeding sudden steps of insight.\n\nThe Dzogchen-traditions states that the ultimate nature of all sentient beings is \"pure, all-encompassing, primordial awareness\", or \"naturally occurring timeless awareness\". This intrinsic awareness has no form of its own, and yet is capable of perceiving, experiencing, reflecting, or expressing all form. It does so without being affected by those forms in any ultimate, permanent way.\n\nThe analogy given by Dzogchen masters is that one's nature is like a mirror which reflects with complete openness, but is not affected by the reflections. Rigpa is the knowledge that ensues from recognizing this mirror-like clarity, which cannot be found by searching nor identified. One \"knows\" that there is a primordial freedom from grasping his or her mind.\n\nIn Advaita Vedanta moksha is attained by jnana, insight-knowledge. In Shankara's philosophical synthesis insight samadhi is used as a subsidiary to this goal. Swami Vivekananda emphasized the \"experience\" of nirvikalpa samadhi as a means to validate religious, transcendental knowledge.\n\n\nRinzai\nSoto\nSanbo Kyodan\nCritical\n\n"}

He calls this ship the \"Argo\", on which Theseus was said to have sailed with Jason; he may have confused the \"Argo\" (referred to in passing in Plutarch's \"Theseus\" at 19.4) with the ship that sailed from Crete (\"Theseus\", 23.1).\n\nIn the book \"Last Chance to See\" Douglas Adams discusses the Gold Pavilion Temple in Kyoto, which is an example similar to the Shinto shrine (discussed in the main article), and realised the following: \n\nTheseus's paradox bears also on the question of virtual human identity discussed in Douglas Hofstadter's and Daniel Dennett's \"The Mind's I: Fantasies and reflections on self and soul\" (1981). Speculations concerning mind uploading suggest it is possible to transfer a human mind from an organic brain to a computer, incrementally and in such a way that consciousness is never interrupted, e.g. by replacing neurons one by one with electronics designed to simulate the neurons' firing patterns. Yet the result of this process is an object entirely physically distinct from the starting point.\n\nThe Talmud presents the paradox with three practical implications to Jewish law, and concludes that it is indeed considered as if it was a different object.\n\nIn the Oz books by L. Frank Baum, the lumberjack Nick Chopper's axe chopped off all his limbs one by one, and each time a limb was cut off, a smith made him a mechanical one, finally making him a torso and a head, thus turning him into the Tin Woodman, an entirely mechanical being, albeit possessing the consciousness of the lumberjack he once was. In The Tin Woodman of Oz he seeks out his old girlfriend, to find that she has married Chopfyt, who was created partly from the leftover parts of Nick Chopper.\n\nIn the novel \"John Dies at the End\" the starting chapter presents the experiment as a riddle with an axe that has its handle and its head replaced.\n\nIn the Discworld series by Terry Pratchett:\n\nThe short story \"The Man That Was Used Up\" by Edgar Allan Poe is about a man who reconstructs himself after going through a war.\n\nRobert Graves employs the \"grandfather's axe\" version of the paradox in his historical novel, \"The Golden Fleece\", first published in 1945.\n\nIsaac Asimov's \"Bicentennial Man\" applies this to humanity; the title character being a robot gradually rebuilt by prostheses intended for humans. When contrasted with a human who has been \"rebuilt\" by the same prostheses, the question of the distinction between man and robot is explored.\n\nIn the 1986 book \"Foundation and Earth\" by Isaac Asimov, the ancient robot R. Daneel Olivaw says that over the thousands of years of his existence, every part of him has been replaced several times, including his brain, which he has carefully redesigned six times, replacing it each time with a newly constructed brain having the positronic pathways containing his current memories and skills, along with free space for him to learn more and continue operating for longer.\n\nThe Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series by Douglas Adams makes continuing sport of classic paradoxes. In the trilogy's fourth book So Long, and Thanks For All the Fish, Marvin the Paranoid Android says of himself: \"Every part of me has been replaced at least fifty times...\" (except for the diodes down his left side, which hurt). In the sixth book of the series, character Trillian has had so many body parts and functions replaced by technology that she doubts she is still the same person, referring to her present self as New Trillian and the past as Old Trillian.\n\nJapanese manga and animated series Ghost in the Shell cyclically returns to this paradox of a \"human\" in which people often have their organic body parts replaced by artificial parts, sometimes going so far as to have their entire body replaced with a prosthetic one, leaving the brain as the only remaining original part.\n\nThe plot of the James Blish novel \"Spock Must Die!\" hinges on this philosophical dilemma.\n\nIn Peter Watts' interstellar sci-fi novel Blindsight, the crew's ship is called Theseus. It features technology to create and replace its own parts when broken, and can heal and replace crew members' organs and tissue when they are injured.\n\nLikely hinted at in the Star Wars Legends novel \"Bloodlines\" by Karen Traviss. In the book, Boba Fett notes that the only original part of his ship Slave I that survives from his father's days was the pilot's chair.\n\nIn the 2017 book Run Program, by Scott Meyer, when trying to trick the artificial intelligence which is the main antagonist of the story, one of the characters references the Ship of Theseus. When his reference can't be adequately explained, another character poses a thought experiment involving the transporters in Star Trek. She says when people use the transporter, a copy of themselves is made in the new location and the original is killed by the machine.\n\nIn Michael Rea's \"Material Constitution\", there is a scenario in which Socrates and Plato exchange the parts of their carriages one by one until, finally, Socrates's carriage is made up of all the parts of Plato's original carriage and vice versa. The question is whether, or at what point, they exchanged their carriages. This thought experiment is \"a model for the philosophers\": some say, \"it remained the same,\" others say, \"it did not remain the same\".\n\nIn Hans Moravec's \"Mind Children\", an example of mind uploading is given - a human brain is replaced a single neuron at a time by a nanorobot and computer that perfectly simulates the behaviour of the neuron and its neurotransmitters. The end result is a completely digital copy of brain in simulation. However, there are other factors such as the fact that the intricate structure of the brain is changing as the brain learns, so a simulated brain may not learn the same way.\n\nIn \"The Three Basic Facts of Existence\", Piyadassi Thera uses the teachings of Dharma to suggest that nothing in the universe is ever the same: \n\nIn Johann A. R. Roduit's poem 'Flesh & Foil', the imagery of the Ship of Theseus is used to illustrate the consequences human enhancements could have on someone's physical body.\n\nIn the \"Only Fools and Horses\" episode \"Heroes and Villains\", the road sweeper Trigger declares he has won an award for keeping the same broom for 20 years — \"17 new heads and 14 new handles\".\n\nIn the 2011 documentary series \"Curiosity\", an episode entitled \"Can You Live Forever?\", elaborates on the concept of replacing the human body, piece by piece. Adam Savage, the episode's host, presents the audience with several plausible scenarios.\n\nIn \"An Idiot Abroad\", Karl Pilkington ruminates over the restoration done to the Great Wall of China after discovering monkey bars that had been installed in the tourist area. Pilkington decides that the wall isn't very impressive because \"it's not even the same bloody wall is it?\"\n\nIn the \"Futurama\" episode \"The Six Million Dollar Mon,\" accountant Hermes Conrad replaces his body parts one by one with robotic ones. Dr. Zoidberg requests to keep the discarded body parts, fashioning them into a marionette of Hermes, which he uses for a stand-up routine. When Hermes goes to replace his brain with a robotic one, Zoidberg puts the old brain into his marionette body, bringing Hermes back to life as his old self and leaving his previous body to be taken over by the new brain.\n\nIn \"Star Trek\":\nIn the \"Doctor Who\" episode \"Deep Breath\", the Doctor postulates that a broom that has had its handle and brush replaced several times is not the same broom, \"but you can still sweep the floor\", when talking to an android who has replaced every part of himself several times. This is often taken to be a loving in-joke reference to the above stated \"Trigger's Broom\" scene in another well-known BBC TV series \"Only Fools and Horses\".\n\nIn the 1995 movie, \"Ghost in the Shell\", the main character, a woman who has been \"cybernetically augmented\" to become nearly 100% robot, encounters an intelligent entity claiming to be indistinguishable from a human, who is actually a rogue A.I.; this causes the main character to question her own reality and the nature of a human or being 'alive' or synthetic; with respect to how much of a human can you replace before it ceases to be human, or how human a robot can be before it ceases to be a robot, in an age of synthetic and cybernetic replacement of humans parts on a grand scale.\n\nThe 1999 movie \"Bicentennial Man\", based on the novel, stars an android who develops a personality and replaces his entire physiology with cybernetic-organic parts, so that he is the same character but now mortal.\n\nIn the 2008 animated film \"WALL-E\", it's suggested that possibly every single piece of the character WALL·E has been replaced by himself prior to the story.\n\nIn the 2009 film, \"Gamer\", Michael C. Hall's character Ken Castle develops a nanotechnology method to supplant one's biological central nervous system with a synthetic one, cell by cell. The percentage of supplanted cells in an individual's brain varied by character, depending on the desired function (i.e.- wirelessly receive information like a computer, or send it, in the case of Ken Castle). Although not fully expressed in any character of the film, Castle ultimately presents the audience with the concept of fully supplanting one's biological brain with an entirely synthetic one. Midway into the film, Theseus' Ship Paradox does come into question when the character of Gina Parker Smith (Kyra Sedgwick) shares that she would rather have the new parts removed, a statement that prompts Trace (Alison Lohman) to explain that such an attempt would kill the individual because it would mean removing a part of one's brain.\n\nThe 2012 movie \"John Dies At The End\" based on the novel, begins with a narration recounting the axe variant of the paradox.\n\nThe 2013 movie \"Ship of Theseus\" portrays the paradox through intertwined stories of human organ donation.\n\nSugababes, a British band, \"were formed in 1998 [..] but one by one they left, till by September 2009 none of the founders remained in the band; each had been replaced by another member, just like the planks of Theseus’s boat.\" The three original members reunited in 2011 under the name Mutya Keisha Siobhan, with the \"original\" Sugababes still in existence.\n\nMembership of the British pop band The Pipettes has gradually changed such that none of the founding members are any longer part of the band.\n\nYes no longer features any original members.\n\nStratovarius was formed in 1984 under the name Black Water. The \"classic line-up\" (1996–2005) has no members in common with the founding line-up. Also, as of 2018, the current incarnation of the band has no members in common with the 1994 line-up that recorded \"Dreamspace\"; yet continuity was never broken.\n\nJapanese idol groups such as AKB48 are often like this, employing new members as the older ones \"graduate\", eventually coming to a point where none of the original members are part of the group anymore. Or they distribute members into teams and rotate them around, eventually coming to a point where the team no longer has any of its original members.\n\nComputer systems will sometimes split into two or more versions, such as when its programmers disagree and spit into rival teams. This may happen in open source software as a fork, or commercially when company founders leave to create a new company doing similar work. This can lead to situations where, for example, one team retains the original name but the other retains most of the core people.\n\nThe 2013 game \"The Swapper\"'s staple mechanic is a cloning device that allows the player to create perfect clones and swap consciousness between them. The majority of the game takes place aboard a spaceship named \"Theseus\", which is a heavy nod to the thought experiment's involvement in the game's use of themes such as the subject of consciousness and a lost sense of originality.\n\nThe 2015 psychological horror game \"SOMA\" features dialogue and text records that presents the player with the paradox of the human body, as the cells of the body are all being replaced at different rates - the body and mind is always growing and changing. As every second passes, a person is never physically the same, but they always represent the same person, \"a continuous flow of thought and perception keeps an unbroken chain of continuity that we know as our self\".\n\nThe contemporary writer Martin Cohen creatively imagined John Locke regarding a favorite sock that develops a hole. He pondered whether the sock would still be the same after a patch was applied to the hole, and if it would be the same sock after a second patch was applied, and a third, etc., until all of the material of the original sock has been replaced with patches.\n\nAn instance known generally as grandfather's axe, where over time both the head and handle have been replaced, has been personified with the names of famous hatchet and axe wielders such as George Washington and Abraham Lincoln.\n\nIn Europe, several independent tales and stories feature knives that have had their blades and handles replaced several times, but are still used and represent the same knife. France has Jeannot's knife, Spain uses Jeannot's knife as a proverb, though it is referred to simply as \"the family knife\", and Hungary has \"Lajos Kossuth's pocket knife\".\n\nIn Japan, Shinto shrines are rebuilt every twenty years with entirely \"new wood\". The continuity over the centuries is spiritual and comes from the source of the wood in the case of Ise Jingu's Naiku shrine, which is harvested from an adjoining forest that is considered sacred. In 2013, the shrine was rebuilt for the 62nd time.\n\nThe question of identity posed by the \"Ship of Theseus\" remains problematic even in the 21st century, foremost with both the piecemeal and wholesale reconstruction of wooden boats and tall ships, as well as structures of historic merit and not. An illustrative example is the provenance of the USS \"Constellation\", the identity controversy over which long vexed even respected naval historians and publications of record. Credible records allowed its history to finally be resolved, but many instances occur whether either records are lacking or the matter is simply one of point of view.\n\n"}

{"id": "25113302", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25113302", "title": "Movement Medicine", "text": "Movement Medicine\n\nMovement Medicine is a movement meditation practice, intended to create an experiential and embodied connectedness with the world. It was developed by Susannah and Ya'Acov Darling Khan, who directed the Moving Centre School Europe, representing Gabrielle Roth and the 5Rhythms in Europe until 2007. Movement Medicine integrates physical, artistic, spiritual, shamanic and therapeutic practices so as to stimulate human creativity, healing and transformation, focussing on the relationship with ourselves, each other, the earth, and the spirit of life. It is non-denominational, aiming to answer the spiritual impulse without the need for dogma or belief. The Movement Medicine practice is meant to give people tools to integrate the freedom and aliveness of the dance into daily life.\n\nBesides 5Rhythms, Movement Medicine is influenced by shamanism, Helen Poynor's \"Walk of Life\" movement work, and global environmental initiatives such as the \"Awakening the Dreamer\" Symposium. Although not a social movement in the traditional sense of the word, the practice shows similarities with the Human Potential Movement and the New Age movement, sharing interest in a search for self actualization, empowerment and spiritual transformation.\n\nThere is a professional organization of Movement Medicine Teachers and Facilitators, and a Registered Charity which sponsors dancers from different countries to train to teach the practice.\n\nMovement Medicine works with 4 different 'maps', which focus on different aspects of life in general and the dance practice in particular. Each map is accompanied by different tools, exercises and practices.\n\nFirstly, the map of the 4 Aristotelian elements, Earth, Fire, Water and Air is foundational to Movement Medicine. According to Ya'Acov and Susannah Darling Khan, these elements provide an opportunity to explore different movement qualities, and provide a language of metaphor to support the practice. Each element is considered to exist both inside and outside the dancer, who connects to them through movement and imagination.\n\nSecondly, \"the 5 dimensions of awareness\" concern different dimensions of moving between micro and macro, individual, inter-personal and global. These are called \"the 5 dimensions of awareness\": Self, Relational, Environmental, Ancestral and Divine. The practice supports movement across each of these. According to Ya'Acov Darling Khan, trance is like \"discovering that you've got second, third, fourth, and fifth gears of perception when you've been ambling along in first.\"\n\nThe third map, called \"the 9 Gateways\" provides an orientation in space and time and reflects the following 9 aspects of life, divided into groups of three, called \"Journeys\": 1 Body, 2 Heart, 3 Mind, 4 Past, 5 Present, 6 Future, 7 Fulfilment 8 Interconnection, 9 Realisation.\n\nThe 1st \"Journey\" covers the first three gateways; Body, Heart and Mind. In Movement Medicine, this is represented as a vertical axis from the feet, through the head upwards, and back down again. The 2nd \"Journey\" explores the 4th, 5th, and 6th gateways, which are Past, Present and Future, which are said to form an axis through time, with the 'present' represented \"in\" the body, connected horizontally to the past (behind) and future (in front). The \"3rd Journey\", which is visualised as a horizontal connection from side to side, aims to manifest individual qualities, a sense of connection with the culture or community around, and a sense of the realisation of the mystical experience of 'one-ness.'\n\nFinally, the last map reflects the dynamic relationship between yin and yang at the centre and the tree of life which is found in many cultures worldwide. In the tree sits the phoenix, which, as symbol for the power of transformation, seems to reflect the essence of Movement Medicine.\n\nA PhD research describes that Movement Medicine dancers experience fundamental shifts in their personal growth and wellbeing in areas of the body, emotions, mind and spirituality. Participants describe insights regarding personal beliefs and patterns, their relationship to ancestral and family history, and to cultural patterns and mechanisms. Furthermore, participants sometimes experience new awareness regarding the nature of life, oneness, and various other ‘life lessons’. Although the variety of different traditions that inform the practice has been criticized, the mixture of different techniques are united in a coherent structure, which offers people from many different backgrounds useful entry points.\n\nA second PhD research project is still being carried out at Exeter University, which looks at the transformational aspects of Movement Medicine through the lens of leadership studies.\n\n\n\n"}

They criticized Jean-Paul Sartre and post-structuralism, as well as the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche and Martin Heidegger.\n\nThe term was created by Bernard-Henri Lévy in 1976. Most of the philosophers he included in that description had a previous history of Marxism with which they had recently broken. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's writings on \"The Gulag Archipelago\" had a profound effect upon many of these former Leftists.\n\nThe New Philosophers rejected what they saw as the power-worship of the Left, a tradition which they traced back to at least Hegel and Marx. They argued that various \"master thinkers\" had created the foundations for systems of oppression. More recently Pascal Bruckner has targeted multiculturalism.\n\nBecause they are defined by a negative quality (i.e., the rejection of systems of authoritarian power) the New Philosophers are very disparate. In 1978, Michael Ryan argued that they exist in name only; their \"homogeneity derives from their espousal of heterogeneity.\" They have been described as \"a brand name\" for an \"extremely heterogeneous group of about ten intellectuals who are held together more from without than from within... they do not serve as representatives of any clearly defined political movement or force.\"\n\nThey were attacked as superficial and ideological by critics such as Gilles Deleuze, Pierre Vidal-Naquet, Pierre Bourdieu, Alain Badiou, Jean-François Lyotard, and Cornelius Castoriadis.\n"}
{"id": "216399", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=216399", "title": "Nicholas Roerich", "text": "Nicholas Roerich\n\nNicholas Roerich (; October 9, 1874 – December 13, 1947) – known also as Nikolai Konstantinovich Rerikh () – was a Russian painter, writer, archaeologist, theosophist, philosopher, and public figure, who in his youth was influenced by a movement in Russian society around the spiritual. He was interested in hypnosis and other spiritual practices and his paintings are said to have hypnotic expression.\n\nBorn in Saint Petersburg, Russia, to a well-to-do notary public father of Baltic German ancestry and a Russian mother, he lived in various places around the world until his death in Naggar, Himachal Pradesh, India. Trained as an artist and a lawyer, his main interests were literature, philosophy, archaeology, and especially art. Roerich was a dedicated activist for the cause of preserving art and architecture during times of war. He earned several nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize long list. The so-called Roerich Pact was signed into law by the United States and most nations of the Pan-American Union in April 1935.\n\nRaised in late-19th-century St. Petersburg, Roerich matriculated simultaneously at St. Petersburg University and the Imperial Academy of Arts during 1893. He received the title of \"artist\" in 1897 and a degree in law the next year. He found early employment with the Imperial Society for the Encouragement of the Arts, whose school he directed from 1906 to 1917. Despite early tensions with the group, he became a member of Sergei Diaghilev's \"World of Art\" society; he was president of the society from 1910 to 1916.\n\nArtistically, he became known as his generation's most talented painter of Russia's ancient past, a topic that was compatible with his lifelong interest in archaeology. He also succeeded as a stage designer, achieving his greatest fame as one of the designers for Diaghilev's Ballets Russes. His best-known designs were for Borodin's \"Prince Igor\" (1909 and later productions), and costumes and set for \"The Rite of Spring\" (1913), composed by Igor Stravinsky.\n\nAlong with Mikhail Vrubel and Mikhail Nesterov he is considered a major representative of the Russian Symbolism in art. From an early period of his life, Roerich was influenced by apocrypha and medieval sectarian writings such as the mysterious Dove Book. His designs for the Talashkino church were so radical that the Orthodox church refused to consecrate the building.\n\nAnother of Roerich's passions was architecture. His acclaimed publication \"Architectural Studies\" (1904–1905) – the dozens of paintings he completed of fortresses, monasteries, churches, and other monuments during two long trips through Russia – inspired his decades-long career as an activist on behalf of artistic and architectural preservation. He also designed religious art for places of worship throughout Russia and Ukraine: most notably the \"Queen of Heaven\" fresco for the Church of the Holy Spirit which the patroness Maria Tenisheva built near her Talashkino estate; and the stained glass windows for the Datsan Gunzechoinei during 1913–1915.\n\nDuring the first decade of the 1900s and in the early 1910s, Roerich, largely due to the influence of his wife Helena, developed an interest in eastern religions, as well as alternative (to Christianity) belief systems such as Theosophy. Both Roerichs became avid readers of the Vedantist essays of Ramakrishna and Vivekananda, the poetry of Rabindranath Tagore, and the \"Bhagavad Gita\". The Roerichs' commitment to occult mysticism increased steadily. It was especially intense during World War I and the Russian revolutions of 1917, to which the couple, like many Russian intellectuals, accorded apocalyptic significance. The influence of Theosophy, Vedanta, Buddhism, and other mystical topics can be detected not only in many of his paintings, but in the many short stories and poems Roerich wrote before and after the 1917 revolutions, including the \"Flowers of Morya\" cycle, begun in 1907 and completed in 1921.\n\nAfter the February Revolution of 1917 and the end of the czarist regime, Roerich, a political moderate who valued Russia's cultural heritage more than ideology and party politics, had an active part in artistic politics. With Maxim Gorky and Aleksandr Benois, he participated with the so-called \"Gorky Commission\" and its successor organization, the Arts Union (SDI). Both attempted to gain the attention of the Provisional Government and Petrograd Soviet on the need to form a coherent cultural policy and, most urgently, protect art and architecture from destruction and vandalism. At the same time, however, illness forced Roerich to leave the capital and reside in Karelia, the district bordering Finland. He had already quit the presidency of the World of Art society, and he now quit the directorship of the School of the Imperial Society for the Encouragement of the Arts. After the October Revolution and the acquisition of power of Lenin's Bolshevik Party, Roerich became increasingly discouraged about Russia's political future. During early 1918, he, Helena, and their two sons George and Svetoslav emigrated to Finland.\n\nTwo unresolved historical debates are associated with Roerich's departure. First, it is often claimed that Roerich was a major candidate to direct a people's commissariat of culture (the Soviet equivalent of a ministry of culture) which the Bolsheviks considered establishing during 1917–1918, but that he refused to accept the job. In fact, Benois was the most likely choice to direct any such commissariat. It seems that Roerich was a preferred choice to manage its department of artistic education; the topic is rendered moot by the fact that the Soviets elected not to establish such a commissariat. Second, when he wished to reconcile with the USSR, Roerich maintained later that he had not left Soviet Russia deliberately, but that he and his family, living in Karelia (there he painted a series of pictures under the name \"Karelian Suite\"), had been isolated from their homeland when civil war began in Finland. However, Roerich's extreme hostility to the Bolshevik regime – prompted not so much by a dislike of communism as by his revulsion at Lenin's ruthlessness and his fear that Bolshevism would result in the destruction of Russia's artistic and architectural heritage – was amply documented. He illustrated Leonid Andreyev's anti-communist polemic \"S.O.S.\" and had a widely published pamphlet, \"Violators of Art\" (1918–1919). Roerich believed that \"the triumph of Russian culture would come about through a new appreciation of ancient myth and legend\".\n\nAfter some months in Finland and Scandinavia, the Roerichs relocated to London, arriving in mid-1919. Engrossed with Theosophical mysticism, the Roerichs now had millenarian expectations that a new age was imminent, and they wished to travel to India as soon as possible. They joined the English-Welsh chapter of the Theosophical Society. It was in London, in March 1920, that the Roerichs founded their own school of mysticism, \"Agni Yoga\", which they referred to also as \"the system of living ethics.\" To earn passage to India, Roerich worked as a stage designer for Thomas Beecham's Covent Garden Theatre, but the enterprise ended unsuccessfully in 1920, and the artist never received full payment for his work. Among the notable people Roerich befriended while in England were the famed British Buddhist Christmas Humphreys, philosopher-author H. G. Wells, and the poet and Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore (whose grand-niece Devika Rani would later marry Roerich's son Svetoslav).\n\nLater, a successful exhibition resulted in an invitation from a director at the Art Institute of Chicago, offering to arrange for Roerich's art to tour the United States. During the autumn of 1920, the Roerichs traveled to America by sea.\n\nThe Roerichs remained in the United States from October 1920 until May 1923. A large exhibition of Roerich's art, organized partly by U.S. impresario Christian Brinton and partly by the Chicago Art Institute, began in New York in December 1920 and toured the country, to San Francisco and back, during 1921 and early 1922. Roerich befriended acclaimed soprano Mary Garden of the Chicago Opera and received a commission to design a 1922 production of Rimsky-Korsakov's \"The Snow Maiden\" for her. During the exhibition, the Roerichs spent significant amounts of time in Chicago, New Mexico, and California.\n\nThey settled in New York City, which became the base of their many American operations. The Roerichs initiated several institutions during these years: \"Cor Ardens\" and \"Corona Mundi\", both of which were meant to unite artists around the globe in the cause of civic activism; the Master Institute of United Arts, an art school with an exceptionally versatile curriculum, and the eventual home of the first Nicholas Roerich Museum; and an American Agni Yoga Society. They also joined various theosophical societies, and their activities with these groups dominated their lives.\n\nAfter leaving New York, the Roerichs – together with their son George and six friends – began the five-year-long 'Roerich Asian Expedition' that, in Roerich's own words: \"started from Sikkim through Punjab, Kashmir, Ladakh, the Karakoram Mountains, Khotan, Kashgar, Qara Shar, Urumchi, Irtysh, the Altai Mountains, the Oyrot region of Mongolia, the Central Gobi, Kansu, Tsaidam, and Tibet\" with a detour through Siberia to Moscow in 1926. Roerichs' Asian expedition attracted attention from the foreign services and intelligence agencies of the USSR, the United States, Great Britain, and Japan. In fact, prior to this expedition, Roerich himself solicited help of Soviet government and Bolshevik secret police to assist him in his expedition, promising in return to monitor British activities in the area, but received only a lukewarm response from Michail Abramowitsch Trilisser, chief of the Soviet foreign intelligence at that time. On the one hand, the Bolsheviks assisted him with logistics when Roerich was traveling through Siberia and Mongolia. Yet, on the other hand, they refused to totally commit themselves to his reckless utopian project of the Sacred Union of the East – a spiritual utopia that boiled down to Roerich's ambitious attempts to stir the Buddhist masses of inner Asia to create a highly spiritual cooperative commonwealth under the patronage of Bolshevik Russia. The official mission of this expedition, as Roerich put it, was to act as the embassy of Western Buddhism to Tibet. However, for Western media his expedition was presented as an artistic and scientific enterprise; Between the summer of 1927 and June 1928 the expedition was thought to be lost, since communication with them ceased for a year. They had been attacked in Tibet and only the \"superiority of our firearms prevented bloodshed... In spite of our having Tibet passports, the expedition was forcibly stopped by Tibetan authorities.\" The expedition was detained by the government for five months, and forced to live in tents in sub-zero conditions and to subsist on meagre rations. Five men of the expedition died during this time. In March 1928 they were allowed to leave Tibet, and trekked south to settle in India, where they founded a research center, the Himalayan Research Institute.\n\nIn 1929 Nicholas Roerich was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize by the University of Paris. He received two more nominations in 1932 and 1935. His concern for peace resulted in his creation of the Pax Cultura, the \"Red Cross\" of art and culture. His work for this cause also resulted in the United States and the twenty other nations of the Pan-American Union signing the Roerich Pact on April 15, 1935 at the White House. The Roerich Pact is an early international instrument protecting cultural property.\n\nIn 1934–1935, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (then headed by Roerich admirer Henry A. Wallace) sponsored an expedition by Roerich and USDA scientists H. G. MacMillan and James F. Stephens to Inner Mongolia, Manchuria, and China. The expedition's purpose was to collect seeds of plants which prevent the destruction of benign layers of soil.\n\nThe expedition consisted of two parts. In 1934, they explored the Greater Khingan mountains and Bargan plateau in western Manchuria. In 1935, they explored parts of Inner Mongolia: the Gobi Desert, Ordos Desert, and Helan Mountains. The expedition found almost 300 species of xerophytes, collected herbs, conducted archeological studies, and found antique manuscripts of great scientific importance.\n\nRoerich was in India during the Second World War, where he painted Russian epic heroic and saintly themes, including: \"Alexander Nevsky\", \"The Fight of Mstislav and Rededia\" and \"Boris and Gleb\".\n\nIn 1942, Roerich received Jawaharlal Nehru at his house in Kullu and Nehru's daughter, Indira Gandhi. Together they discussed the fate of the new world: \"We spoke about Indian–Russian cultural association [...] it is time to think about useful and creative cooperation\".\n\nGandhi would later recall about several days spent together with Roerich's family: \"That was a memorable visit to a surprising and gifted family where each member was a remarkable figure in himself, with a well-defined range of interests. ... Roerich himself stays in my memory. He was a man with extensive knowledge and enormous experience, a man with a big heart, deeply influenced by all that he observed\".\n\nDuring the visit, \"ideas and thoughts about closer cooperation between India and USSR were expressed. Now, after India wins independence, they have got its own real implementation. And as you know, there are friendly and mutually-understanding relationships today between both our countries\".\n\nIn 1942, the American–Russian cultural Association (ARCA) was created in New York. Its active participants were Ernest Hemingway, Rockwell Kent, Charlie Chaplin, Emil Cooper, Serge Koussevitzky, and Valeriy Ivanovich Tereshchenko. The Association's activity was welcomed by scientists like Robert Millikan and Arthur Compton.\n\nRoerich died on December 13, 1947.\n\nVice President of the United States Henry A. Wallace was a frequent correspondent and sometime advocate of Nicholas Roerich's teachings. Wallace became attracted to the idea of Sacred Union of the East, a spiritual and geopolitical utopia Nicholas and Helena Roerich contemplated to establish in the heart of Asia. Based on spiritual ideas, which the Roerichs claimed they received from otherworld masters, this utopia was to show the humankind a blueprint of ideal society. As the US Secretary of Agriculture, Wallace became so much interested in the whole project that he decided to sponsor the second Roerich expedition to Asia in 1933–1934. In the meantime, Helena Roerich was corresponding with US President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was intrigued by her \"fiery letters.\" The whole project ended in a disaster and resulted in energetic efforts by Wallace and FDR to cut their ties with the Roerichs. The whole incident later partially resurfaced and became controversial when Wallace campaigned for President in 1948 and portions of the correspondence were printed by columnist Westbrook Pegler, becoming known as the Guru Letters,\n\nPresently, the Nicholas Roerich Museum in New York City is a major institution for Roerich's artistic work. Numerous Roerich societies continue to promote his theosophical teachings worldwide. His paintings can be seen in several museums including the Roerich Department of the State Museum of Oriental Arts in Moscow; the Roerich Museum at the International Centre of the Roerichs in Moscow; the Russian State Museum in Saint Petersburg, Russia; a collection in the Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow; a collection in the Art Museum in Novosibirsk, Russia; an important collection in the National Gallery for Foreign Art in Sofia, Bulgaria; a collection in the Art Museum in Nizhny Novgorod Russia; National Museum of Serbia; the Roerich Hall Estate in Naggar, India; the Sree Chitra Art Gallery, Thiruvananthapuram, India; in various art museums in India; and a selection featuring several of his larger works in The Latvian National Museum of Art.\n\nRoerich's biography and his controversial expeditions to Tibet and Manchuria have been examined recently by a number of authors, including two Russians, Vladimir Rosov and Alexandre Andreyev, American (Andrei Znamenski), and the German Ernst von Waldenfels.\n\nH.P. Lovecraft refers numerous times to the \"strange and disturbing paintings of Nicholas Roerich\" in his Antarctic horror story \"At the Mountains of Madness\".\n\nThe minor planet 4426 Roerich in the Solar System was named in honor of Roerich.\n\nIn June 2013 during Russian Art Week in London, Roerich's \"Madonna Laboris\" sold at auction at Bonhams shop for £7,881,250 inc. buyer's premium, making it the most valuable painting ever sold at a Russian art auction.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3944846", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3944846", "title": "Philosophy of Søren Kierkegaard", "text": "Philosophy of Søren Kierkegaard\n\nThe philosophy of Søren Kierkegaard has been a major influence in the development of 20th-century philosophy, especially existentialism and postmodernism. Kierkegaard was a 19th-century Danish philosopher who has been called the \"Father of Existentialism\". His philosophy also influenced the development of existential psychology.\n\nKierkegaard criticized aspects of the philosophical systems that were brought on by philosophers such as Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel before him and the Danish Hegelians. He was also indirectly influenced by the philosophy of Immanuel Kant. He measured himself against the model of philosophy which he found in Socrates, which aims to draw one's attention not to explanatory systems, but rather to the issue of how one exists.\n\nOne of Kierkegaard's recurrent themes is the importance of subjectivity, which has to do with the way people relate themselves to (objective) truths. In \"Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments\", he argues that \"subjectivity is truth\" and \"truth is subjectivity.\" What he means by this is that most essentially, truth is not just a matter of discovering objective facts. While objective facts are important, there is a second and more crucial element of truth, which involves how one relates oneself to those matters of fact. Since how one acts is, from the ethical perspective, more important than any matter of fact, truth is to be found in subjectivity rather than objectivity.\n\nMany of Kierkegaard's earlier writings from 1843 to 1846 were written pseudonymously. In the non-pseudonymous \"The Point of View of My Work as an Author\", he explained that the pseudonymous works are written from perspectives which are not his own: while Kierkegaard himself was a religious author, the pseudonymous authors wrote from points of view that were aesthetic or speculative. One exception to this is \"Anti-Climacus\", a pseudonymous author developed after the writing of \"The Point of View\": Anti-Climacus is a religious author who writes from a Christian perspective so ideal that Kierkegaard did not wish it to be attributed to himself.\n\nBecause the pseudonymous authors write from perspectives which are not Kierkegaard's own, some of the philosophy mentioned in this article may or may not necessarily reflect Kierkegaard's own beliefs. Just as other philosophers bring up viewpoints in their essays to discuss and criticize them, Kierkegaard assigns pseudonyms to explore a particular viewpoint in-depth, which may take up a whole book or two in some instances, and Kierkegaard, or another pseudonym, critiques that position. For example, the author, \"Johannes Climacus\" is not a Christian and he argues from a non-Christian viewpoint. \"Anti-Climacus\", as mentioned earlier, is a Christian to a high degree and he argues from a devout Christian viewpoint. Kierkegaard places his beliefs in-between these two authors.\n\nMost of Kierkegaard's later philosophical and religious writings from 1846 to 1855 were written and authored by himself, and he assigned no pseudonyms to these works. Subsequently, these works are considered by most scholars to reflect Kierkegaard's own beliefs. Where appropriate, this article will mention the respective author, pseudonymous or not.\n\nAlienation is a term philosophers apply to a wide variety of phenomena, including any feeling of separation from, and discontent with, society; feeling that there is a moral breakdown in society; feelings of powerlessness in the face of the solidity of social institutions; the impersonal, dehumanised nature of large-scale and bureaucratic social organisations. Kierkegaard recognizes and accepts the notion of alienation, although he phrases it and understands it in his own distinctly original terms. For Kierkegaard, the present age is a reflective age—one that values objectivity and thought over action, lip-service to ideals rather than action, discussion over action, publicity and advertising over reality, and fantasy over the real world. For Kierkegaard, the meaning of values has been removed from life, by lack of finding any true and legitimate authority. Instead of falling into any claimed authority, any \"literal\" sacred book or any other great and lasting voice, self-aware humans must confront an existential uncertainty.\n\nHumanity has lost meaning because the accepted criterion of reality and truth is ambiguous and subjective thought—that which cannot be proven with logic, historical research, or scientific analysis. Humans cannot think out choices in life, we must live them; and even those choices that we often think about become different once life itself enters into the picture. For Kierkegaard, the type of objectivity that a scientist or historian might use misses the point—humans are not motivated and do not find meaning in life through pure objectivity. Instead, they find it through passion, desire, and moral and religious commitment. These phenomena are not objectively provable—nor do they come about through any form of analysis of the external world; they come about through a direct relationship between one and the external world. Here Kierkegaard's emphasis is on relationship rather than analysis. This relationship is a way of looking at one’s life that evades objective scrutiny. \n\nKierkegaard's analysis of the present age uses terms that resemble but are not exactly coincident with Hegel and Marx's theory of alienation. However Kierkegaard expressly means that human beings are alienated from God because they are living too much in the world. Individuals need to gain their souls from the world because it actually belongs to God. Kierkegaard has no interest in external battles as Karl Marx does. His concern is about the inner fight for faith.\n\nAlbert Camus wrote about the idea of being a stranger in the world but reversed Kierkegaard's meaning. A stranger for Camus was someone living in the world who is forced to exist in a Christian way even though the individual does not want to be a Christian. But Kierkegaard was discussing the Christian who wants to be a Christian living in a world that has abandoned Christianity. Both Camus and Kierkegaard had in common an equal distaste for a Christian Democracy where all are forced to take a positive part in Christianity because freedom of choice would be lacking and in a non-Christian Democracy where none are allowed to take an active part in Christianity. Kierkegaard was against voting about Christianity, for him, Christ was the only authority. Camus called \"the existential attitude philosophical suicide.\" This is how he put it in \"The Myth of Sisyphus and Other Writings\" \n\nKierkegaard put it this way in \"Three Edifying Discourses\" 1843 and \"Concluding Unscientific Postscript\" (1846). \n\nAn element of Kierkegaard's critique of modernity in his socio-political work, \"Two Ages\", is the mention of money — which he calls an abstraction. An abstraction is something that only has a reality in an ersatz reality. It is not tangible, and only has meaning within an artificial context, which ultimately serves devious and deceptive purposes. It is a figment of thought that has no concrete reality, neither now nor in the future.\n\nHow is money an abstraction? Money gives the illusion that it has a direct relationship to the work that is done. That is, the work one does is worth so much, equals so much money. In reality, however, the work one does is an expression of who one is as a person; it expresses one's goals in life and associated meaning. As a person, the work one performs is supposed to be an external realization of one's relationship to others and to the world. It is one's way of making the world a better place for oneself and for others. What reducing work to a monetary value does is to replace the concrete reality of one's everyday struggles with the world —to give it shape, form and meaning— with an abstraction. Kierkegaard lamented that \"a young man today would scarcely envy another his capacities or skill or the love of a beautiful girl or his fame, no, but he would envy him his money. Give me money, the young man will say, and I will be all right.\" But Kierkegaard thinks this emphasis on money leads to a denial of the gifts of the spirit to those who are poor and in misery. \n\nBelow are three quotes concerning Kierkegaard's idea of abstraction which cannot be thought about without thinking about concretion. He moves from the world historical, the general, to the single individual, the specific. The first from the esthete and the second from the ethicist in \"Either/Or\" and the third from the book that explained all his previous works; \"Concluding Unscientific Postscript\". \n\nDeath is inevitable and temporally unpredictable. Kierkegaard believed that individuals needed to sincerely and intensely come to realize the truth of that fact in order to live passionately. Kierkegaard accuses society of being in death-denial. Even though people see death all around them and grasp as an objective fact that everyone dies, few people truly understand, subjectively and inwardly, that they will die someday. For example, in \"Concluding Unscientific Postscript\", Kierkegaard notes that people never think to say, \"I shall certainly attend your party, but I must make an exception for the contingency that a roof tile happens to blow down and kill me; for in that case, I cannot attend.\" This is jest as far as Kierkegaard is concerned. But there is also earnestness involved in the thought of death. Kierkegaard said the following about death in his Three Upbuilding Discourses, 1844. We shall not decide which life fights the good fight most easily, but we all agree that every human being ought to fight the good fight, from which no one is shut out, and yet this is so glorious that if it were granted only once to a past generation under exceptional circumstances-yes, what a description envy and discouragement would then know how to give! The difference is about the same as that in connection with the thought of death. As soon as a human being is born, he begins to die. But the difference is that there are some people for whom the thought of death comes into existence with birth and is present to them in the quiet peacefulness of childhood and the buoyancy of youth; whereas others have a period in which this thought is not present to them until, when the years run out, the years of vigor and vitality, the thought of death meets them on their way. Who, now, is going to decide which life was easier, whether it was the life of those who continually lived with a certain reserve because the thought of death was present to them or the life of those who so abandoned themselves to life that they almost forgot the existence of death?\n\nFor Kierkegaard's author, \"Vigilius Haufniensis\", anxiety/dread/angst (depending on the translation and context) is unfocused fear. Haufniensis uses the example of a man standing on the edge of a tall building or cliff. From this height he can see all the possibilities of life. He's reflecting on what he could become if he only threw himself into the power of his own choice. As long as he stands there he stands at the crossroads of life, unable to make a decision and live within its boundaries. The mere fact that one has the possibility and freedom to do something, even the most terrifying of possibilities, triggers immense feelings of dread. Haufniensis called this our \"dizziness of freedom.\"Anxiety may be compared with dizziness. He whose eye happens to look down into the yawning abyss becomes dizzy. But what is the reason for this? It is just as much in his own eye as in the abyss, for suppose he had not looked down. Hence, anxiety is the dizziness of freedom, which emerges when the spirit wants to posit the synthesis and freedom looks down into its own possibility, laying hold of finiteness to support itself. Freedom succumbs to dizziness. Further than this, psychology cannot and will not go. In that very moment everything is changed, and freedom, when it again rises, sees that it is guilty. Between these two moments lies the leap, which no science has explained and which no science can explain. He who becomes guilty in anxiety becomes as ambiguously guilty as it is possible to become. Vigilius Haufniensis, \"The Concept of Anxiety\" p. 61.\n\nIn \"The Concept of Anxiety\", Haufniensis focuses on the first anxiety experienced by man: Adam's choice to eat from God's forbidden tree of knowledge or not. Since the concepts of good and evil did not come into existence before Adam ate the fruit, which is now dubbed original sin, Adam had no concept of good and evil, and did not know that eating from the tree was evil. What he did know was that God told him not to eat from the tree. The anxiety comes from the fact that God's prohibition itself implies that Adam is free and that he could choose to obey God or not. After Adam ate from the tree, sin was born. So, according to Kierkegaard, anxiety precedes sin, and it is anxiety that leads Adam to sin. Haufniensis mentions that anxiety is the presupposition for hereditary sin.\n\nHowever, Haufniensis mentions that anxiety is a way for humanity to be saved as well. Anxiety informs us of our choices, our self-awareness and personal responsibility, and brings us from a state of un-self-conscious immediacy to self-conscious reflection. (Jean-Paul Sartre calls these terms pre-reflexive consciousness and reflexive consciousness.) An individual becomes truly aware of their potential through the experience of dread. So, anxiety may be a possibility for sin, but anxiety can also be a recognition or realization of one's true identity and freedoms.\n\nMost emphatically in \"The Sickness Unto Death\", Kierkegaard's author argues that the human self is a composition of various aspects that must be brought into conscious balance: the finite, the infinite, a consciousness of the \"relationship of the two to itself,\" and a consciousness of \"the power that posited\" the self. The finite (limitations such as those imposed by one's body or one's concrete circumstances) and the infinite (those capacities that free us from limitations such as imagination) always exist in a state of tension. That tension between two aspects of the \"self\" that must be brought into balance. When the self is out of balance, i.e., has the wrong understanding of who it is because it conceives itself too much in terms of its own limiting circumstances (and thus fails to recognize its own freedom to determine what it will be) or too much in terms of what it would like to be, (thus ignoring its own circumstances), the person is in a state of despair. Notably, Anti-Climacus says one can be in despair even if one feels perfectly happy. Despair is not just an emotion, in a deeper sense it is the loss of self, i.e., it describes the state when one has the wrong conception of oneself.\nIn \"Either/Or\", \"A\" and \"Judge William\" each has one epistolary novel in two volumes. The \"A\" is an aesthete well aware that he can use the power of interpretation to define who he is and what he takes to be valuable. He knows he can shape and reshape his own self-identity. Nothing binds him to his relationships. Nothing binds him to his past actions. In the end though, he also knows he lacks a consistent understanding of who he is. He lacks a self that resists his own power of reinterpretation. His older friend \"Judge William,\" argues that a deeper concept of selfhood is discovered as one commits to one's actions, and takes ownership of the past and present. A concept of oneself, as this particular human being, begins to take form in one's own consciousness.\nAnother perspective, one in which an individual can find some measure of freedom from despair, is available for the person with religious \"faith.\" This attunes the individual so that he or she can recognize what has always been there: a self to be realized within the circumstances it finds itself right now, i.e., this inner attunement brings about a sort of synthesis between the infinite and the finite.\nIn \"Fear and Trembling\", \"Johannes de Silentio\" argues that the choice of Abraham to obey the private, unethical, commandment of God to sacrifice his son reveals what faith entails: he directs his consciousness absolutely toward \"the absolute\" rather than the merely ethical, i.e., he practices an inner spirituality that seeks to be \"before god\" rather than seeking to understand himself as an ethically upright person. His God requires more than being good, he demands that he seek out an inner commitment to him. If Abraham were to blithely obey, his actions would have no meaning. It is only when he acts \"with fear and trembling\" that he demonstrates a full awareness that murdering a son is absolutely wrong, ethically speaking.\n\nDespair has several specific levels that a person can find themselves, each one further in despair than the last as laid out in \"The Sickness Unto Death\".\n\nThe first level is \"The despair that is ignorant of being despair or the despairing ignorance of having a self and an eternal self.\" Essentially this level is one which has the wrong conception of what a self is, i.e., is ignorant of how to realize the self one already potentially is. In this sense, the person does not recognize his own despair because he often measures the success of his life based on whether he himself judges himself to be happy. Regardless of whether you know you are in despair or not, Kierkegaard asserts, you can still be in that state. He notes that this is the most common in the world.\n\nThe next level of despair is \"The despair that is conscious of being despair and therefore is conscious of having a self in which there is something eternal and then either in despair does not will to be itself or in despair wills to be itself.\" This becomes further subdivided into three categories: the despair not to will or want to be oneself, the despair not to will to be a self, and lowest, the despair to wish for a new self. These three divisions are mostly the self-worth the person has and the amount to which they understand their own despair. The despair to not be oneself is pretty straightforward. A person sees themself as unworthy and as such does not see themself as worthy before something they do not understand. The despair not to be a self is deeper, because to not wish to be a self is to wish to not have a relation to God or at the very least see one's relation to God as unworthy, and thus shrink from it. The lowest form of this group, however, is the desire to be a new self. This is logically the deepest form as it assumes the deepest understanding of one's despair. Once in despair, without a complete relation to God one will always be in despair, so to be in this level one understands the permanence of the despair. The despair in this group arises from the nature of sensate things and physical desires. These three sub groups are also grouped under the heading \"Despair over the earthly.\"\n\nThe second level of conscious despair under the heading \"Despair over the eternal.\" Someone in this level views themself in light of their own weakness. Unlike in the upper level, this weakness is understood and as such, instead of turning to faith and humbling oneself before God, they despair in their own weakness and unworthiness. In this sense, they despair over the eternal and refuse to be comforted by the light of God.\n\nThe last and lowest form of despair is the desire \"In despair to will to be oneself.\" This last form of despair is also referred to by Kierkegaard as \"demonic despair\" (Note that the term demonic is used in the Classical Greek Sense, not the modern sense). In this form of despair, the individual finds him or herself in despair, understands they are in despair, seeks some way to alleviate it, and yet no help is forthcoming. As a result, the self becomes hardened against any form of help and \"Even if God in heaven and all the angels offered him aid, he would not want it.\" At this level of despair the individual revels in their own despair and sees their own pain as lifting them up above the base nature of other humans who do not find themselves in this state. This is the least common form of despair and Kierkegaard claims it is mostly found in true poets. This despair can also be called the despair of defiance, as it is the despair that strikes out against all that is eternal. One last note is that as one travels further down the forms of despair, the number of people in each group becomes fewer.\n\nMany philosophers who initially read Kierkegaard, especially Kierkegaard's (written under the pseudonym of \"Johannes de Silentio\") \"Fear and Trembling\", often come to the conclusion that Kierkegaard supports a divine command law of ethics. The divine command theory is a metaethical theory which claims moral values are whatever is commanded by a god or gods. However, Kierkegaard is not arguing that morality is created by God; instead, he would argue that a divine command from God \"transcends\" ethics. This distinction means that God does not necessarily create human morality: it is up to us as individuals to create our own morals and values. But any religious person must be prepared for the event of a divine command from God that would take precedence over all moral and rational obligations. Kierkegaard called this event the \"teleological suspension of the ethical\". Abraham, the knight of faith, chose to obey God unconditionally, and was rewarded with his son, his faith, and the title of \"Father of Faith\". Abraham transcended ethics and leaped into faith.\n\nBut there is no valid logical argument one can make to claim that morality ought to be or can be suspended in any given circumstance, or ever. Thus, Silentio believes ethics and faith are separate stages of consciousness. The choice to obey God unconditionally is a true existential 'either/or' decision faced by the individual. Either one chooses to live in faith (the religious stage) or to live ethically (the ethical stage).\n\nIn \"Either/Or\", Kierkegaard insists that the single individual has ethical responsibility of his life. However, everyone wants to enjoy themselves and ethics gets in the way of a person's enjoyment of life if taken to extremes. This results in a battle between those who want to live for pleasure and those who demand an ethical existence. But Kierkegaard always points toward the religious goal, an \"eternal happiness\", or the salvation of the soul as the highest good. He says, be whatever you want, but remember that your soul belongs to God, not to the world. \n\nIn \"Works of Love\" and \"Purity of Heart\", Kierkegaard skillfully examines Christian ethics and the maxim, \"Love Thy Neighbour\". Kierkegaard stressed that it was Christianity that \"discovered the neighbor\". \n\nFor Kierkegaard, true individuality is called selfhood. Becoming aware of our true self is our true task and endeavor in life—it is an ethical imperative, as well as preparatory to a true religious understanding. Individuals can exist at a level that is less than true selfhood. We can live, for example, simply in terms of our pleasures—our immediate satisfaction of desires, propensities, or distractions. In this way, we glide through life without direction or purpose. To have a direction, we must have a purpose that defines for us the meaning of our lives. Kierkegaard puts it this way in \"Either/Or\", Here, then, I have your view of life, and, believe me, much of your life will become clear to you if you will consider it along with me as thought-despair. You are a hater of activity in life-quite appropriately, because if there is to be meaning in it life must have continuity, and this your life does not have. You keep busy with your studies, to be sure; you are even diligent; but it is only for your sake, and it is done with as little teleology as possible. Moreover, you are unoccupied; like the laborers in the Gospel standing idle in the marketplace, you stick your hands in your pocket and contemplate life. Now you rest in despair. Nothing concerns you; you step aside for nothing; “If someone threw a roof tile down I would still not step aside.” You are like a dying person. You die daily, not in the profound, earnest sense in which one usually understands these words, but life has lost its reality and you “Always count the days of your life from one termination-notice to the next.” You let everything pass you by; nothing makes any impact. But then something suddenly comes along that grips you, an idea, a situation, a young girl’s smile, and now you are “involved,” for just on certain occasions you are not “involved,” so at other times you are “at your service” in every way. Wherever there is something going on you join in. You behave in life as you usually do in a crowd. “You work yourself into the tightest group, see to it, if possible, to get yourself shoved up over the others so that you come to be above them, and as soon as you are up there you make yourself as comfortable as possible, and in this way you let yourself be carried through life.” But when the crowd is gone, when the event is over, you again stand on the street corner and look at the world. \"Either/Or Part II\" p. 195-196, 272ff\n\nIn \"Sickness Unto Death\" specifically Kierkegaard deals with the self as a product of relations. In this sense, a human results from a relation between the Infinite (Noumena, spirit, eternal) and Finite (Phenomena, body, temporal). This does not create a true self, as a human can live without a \"self\" as he defines it. Instead, the Self or ability for the self to be created from a relation to the Absolute or God (the Self can only be realized through a relation to God) arises as a relation between the relation of the Finite and Infinite relating back to the human. This would be a positive relation.\n\nAn individual person, for Kierkegaard, is a particular that no abstract formula or definition can ever capture. Including the individual in \"the public\" (or \"the crowd\" or \"the herd\") or subsuming a human being as simply a member of a species is a reduction of the true meaning of life for individuals. What philosophy or politics try to do is to categorize and pigeonhole individuals by group characteristics, each with their own individual differences. In Four Upbuilding Discourses, 1843 Kierkegaard says the differences aren't important, the likeness with God is what brings equality. In the hallowed places, in every upbuilding view of life, the thought arises in a person’s soul that help him to fight the good fight with flesh and blood, with principalities and powers, and in the fight to free himself for equality before God, whether this battle is more a war of aggression against the differences that want to encumber him with worldly favoritism or a defensive war against the differences that want to make him anxious in worldly perdition. Only in this way is equality the divine law, only in this way is the struggle the truth, only in this way does the victory have validity- only when the single individual fights for himself with himself within himself and does not unseasonably presume to help the whole world to obtain external equality, which is of very little benefit, all the less so because it never existed, if for no other reason than that everyone would come to thank him and become unequal before him, only in this way is equality the divine law. \"Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses\", by Soren Kiekegaard Hong, p. 143\n\nKierkegaard's critique of the modern age, therefore, is about the loss of what it means to be an individual. Modern society contributes to this dissolution of what it means to be an individual. Through its production of the false idol of \"the public\", it diverts attention away from individuals to a mass public that loses itself in abstractions, communal dreams, and fantasies. It is helped in this task by the media and the mass production of products to keep it distracted. Even the fight for temporal equality is a distraction. In Works of Love he writes, \n\nAlthough Kierkegaard attacked \"the public\", he is supportive of communities:\nFor Kierkegaard, in order to apprehend the absolute, the mind must radically empty itself of objective content. What supports this radical emptying, however, is the desire for the absolute. Kierkegaard names this desire \"Passion\".\n\nIn line with this philosophy, some scholars have drawn similarities between the Stoics concept of Apatheia and Subjective Truth as the highest form of Wisdom. For the Stoics, Pathos (Passion) is a Perturbation which man has to overcome in a similar manner to Kierkegaard's concept of Objective Truth.\n\nAccording to Kierkegaard, the human self desires that which is beyond reason. Desire itself appears to be a desire for the infinite, as Plato once wrote. Even the desire to propagate, according to Plato, is a kind of desire for immortality—that is, we wish to live on in time through our children and their children. Erotic love itself appears as an example of this desire for something beyond the purely finite. It is a taste of what could be, if only it could continue beyond the boundaries of time and space. As the analogy implies, humans seek something beyond the here and now. The question remains, however, why is it that human pathos or passion is the most precious thing? In some ways, it might have to do with our status as existential beings. It is not thought that gets us through life—it is action; and what motivates and sustains action is passion, the desire to overcome hardships, pain, and suffering. It is also passion that enables us to die for ideals in the name of a higher reality. While a scientist might see this as plain emotion or simple animal desire, Kierkegaard sees it as that which binds to the source of life itself. The desire to live, and to live in the right way, for the right reasons, and with the right desires, is a holy and sacred force. For Kierkegaard all Christian action should have its ground in love, which is a passion. \n\nOne can also look at this from the perspective of what the meaning of our existence is. Why suffer what humans have suffered, the pain and despair—what meaning can all of this have? For Kierkegaard, there is no meaning unless passion, the emotions and will of humans, has a divine source.\n\nPassion is closely aligned with faith in Kierkegaard's thought. Faith as a passion is what drives humans to seek reality and truth in a transcendent world, even though everything we can know intellectually speaks against it. To live and die for a belief, to stake everything one has and is in the belief in something that has a higher meaning than anything in the world—this is belief and passion at their highest.\n\nKierkegaard wrote of the subjective thinker's task in his \"Concluding Unscientific Postscript\". Intellectual reason had been deified by Hegel in his theology and Kierkegaard felt this would lead to the objectification of religion.\n\n\"Johannes Climacus\", in \"Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments\", writes the following cryptic line: \"Subjectivity is Truth\". To understand Climacus's concept of the individual, it is important to look at what he says regarding subjectivity. What is subjectivity? In very rough terms, subjectivity refers to what is personal to the individual—what makes the individual \"who he is in distinction from others\". It is what is inside—what the individual can see, feel, think, imagine, dream, etc. It is often opposed to objectivity—that which is outside the individual, which the individual and others around can feel, see, measure, and think about. Another way to interpret subjectivity is the \"unique\" relationship between the subject and object.\n\nJohann Fichte wrote similarly about subjectivity in his 1799 book \"The Vocation of Man\". I must, however, remind my reader that the \"I\" who speaks in the book is not the author himself, but it is his earnest wish that the reader should himself assume this character, and that he should not rest contented with a mere historical apprehension of what is here said, but really and truly, during reading, hold converse with himself, deliberate, draw conclusions, and form resolutions, like his representative in the book, and, by his own labour and reflection, developed out of his own soul, and build up within himself, that mode of thought the mere picture of which is laid before him in the work. Preface\n\nScientists and historians, for example, study the objective world, hoping to elicit the truth of nature—or perhaps the truth of history. In this way, they hope to predict how the future will unfold in accordance with these laws. In terms of history, by studying the past, the individual can perhaps elicit the laws that determine how events will unfold—in this way the individual can predict the future with more exactness and perhaps take control of events that in the past appeared to fall outside the control of humans.\n\nIn most respects, Climacus did not have problems with science or the scientific endeavor. He would not disregard the importance of objective knowledge. Where the scientist or historian finds certainty, however, Climacus noted very accurately that results in science change as the tools of observation change. But Climacus's special interest was in history. His most vehement attacks came against those who believed that they had understood history and its laws—and by doing so could ascertain what a human’s true self is. That is, the assumption is that by studying history someone can come to know who he really is as a person. Kierkegaard especially accused Hegel's philosophy of falling prey to this assumption. He explained this in, \"Concluding Unscientific Postscript\": \n\nHegel wanted to philosophize about Christianity but had no intention to ever become a Christian. For Climacus, the individual comes to know who he is by an intensely personal and passionate pursuit of what will give meaning to his life. As an existing individual, who must come to terms with everyday life, overcome its obstacles and setbacks, who must live and die, the single individual has a life that no one else will ever live. In dealing with what life brings his way, the individual must encounter them with all his psycho-physical resources.\n\nSubjectivity is that which the individual—and no one else—has. But what does it mean to have something like this? It cannot be understood in the same way as having a car or a bank account. It means to be someone who is becoming someone—it means being a person with a past, a present, and a future. No one can have an individual's past, present or future. Different people experience these in various ways—these experiences are unique, not anyone else's. Having a past, present, and future means that a person is an existing individual—that a person can find meaning in time and by existing. Individuals do not think themselves into existence, they are born. But once born and past a certain age, the individual begins to make choices in life; now those choices can be his, his parents', society's, etc. The important point is that to exist, the individual must make choices—the individual must decide what to do the next moment and on into the future. What the individual chooses and how he chooses will define who and what he is—to himself and to others. Kierkegaard put it this way in Works of Love, 1847: \n\nThe goal of life, according to Socrates, is to know thyself. Knowing oneself means being aware of who one is, what one can be and what one cannot be. Kierkegaard uses the same idea that Socrates used in his own writings. He asks the one who wants to be a single individual the following questions in his 1847 book, \"Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits\" \n\nSubjectivity comes with consciousness of myself as a self. It encompasses the emotional and intellectual resources that the individual is born with. Subjectivity is what the individual is as a human being. Now the problem of subjectivity is to decide how to choose—what rules or models is the individual going to use to make the right choices? What are the right choices? Who defines right? To be truly an individual, to be true to himself, his actions should in some way be expressed so that they describe who and what he is to himself and to others. The problem, according to Kierkegaard, is that we must choose who and what we will be based on subjective interests—the individual must make choices that will mean something to him as a reasoning, feeling being.\n\nKierkegaard decided to step up to the Tree of the knowledge of good and evil for himself, replacing Adam, and make his choice in the presence of God, where no one was there to accuse or judge him but his Creator. This is what he had Abraham do in \"Fear and Trembling\". This is how Kierkegaard thought learning about oneself takes place. Here is where the single individual learns about guilt and innocence. His book, \"The Concept of Anxiety\", makes clear that Adam did have knowledge when he made his choice and that was the knowledge of freedom. The prohibition was there but so was freedom and Eve and Adam decided to use it.\n\nIn Kierkegaard's meaning, purely theological assertions are subjective truths and they cannot be either verified or invalidated by science, i.e. through objective knowledge. For him, choosing if one is for or against a certain subjective truth is a purely arbitrary choice. He calls the jump from objective knowledge to religious faith a leap of faith, since it means subjectively accepting statements which cannot be rationally justified. For him the Christian faith is the result of the trajectory initiated by such choices, which don't have and cannot have a rational ground (meaning that reason is neither for or against making such choices). Objectively regarded, purely theological assertions are neither true nor false.\n\nEarly American Kierkegaard scholars tried to reduce the complexity of Kierkegaard's authorship by focusing on three levels of individual existence, which are named in passing by one of Kierkegaard's pseudonyms, Johannes Climacus, who wrote \"Concluding Unscientific Postscript\". Though the stages represent only one way of interpreting Kierkegaard's thought, it has become a popular way of introducing his authorship. In continental European circles, stage theory never took hold in the same way. This typifies what Kierkegaard was talking about throughout his writing career. \"Early American scholars\" and \"European circles\" denote partitions of thought concerning the writings of his works. He was against \"reflecting oneself out of reality\" and partitioning the \"world of the spirit\" because the world of the spirit cannot be objectively divided. He wrote about Hegel's stages in his book, \"Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion\": \n\nIn one popular interpretation of stage theory, each of the so-called levels of existence envelops those below it: an ethical person is still capable of aesthetic enjoyment, for example, and a religious person is still capable of aesthetic enjoyment and ethical duty. The difference between these ways of living are internal, not external, and thus there are no external signs one can point to determine at what level a person is living. This inner and outer relationship is commonly determined by an individual by looking to others to gauge one's action, Kierkegaard believed one should look to oneself and in that relationship look to Christ as the example instead of looking at others because the more you look at others the less you see of yourself. This makes it easier to degrade your neighbor instead of loving your neighbor. But one must love the person one sees not the person one wishes to see. Either love the person you see as that person is the person he is or stop talking about loving everyone. \n\nKierkegaard was interested in aesthetics, and is sometimes referred to as the \"poet-philosopher\" because of the passionate way in which he approached philosophy. But he is often said to be interested in showing the inadequacy of a life lived entirely in the aesthetic level. Aesthetic life is defined in numerous different ways in Kierkegaard's authorship, including a life defined by intellectual enjoyment, sensuous desire, and an inclination to interpret oneself as if one were \"on stage.\" There are many degrees of this aesthetic existence and a single definition is thus difficult to offer. At bottom, one might see the purely unreflective lifestyle. At the top, we might find those lives which are lived in a reflective, independent, critical and socially apathetic way. But many interpreters of Kierkegaard believe that most people live in the least reflective sort of aesthetic stage, their lives and activities guided by everyday tasks and concerns. Fewer aesthetically guided people are the reflective sort. Whether such people know it or not, their lives will inevitably lead to complete despair. Kierkegaard's author \"A\" is an example of an individual living the aesthetic life. \n\nThe second level of existence is the ethical. This is where an individual begins to take on a true direction in life, becoming aware of and personally responsible for good and evil and forming a commitment to oneself and others. One's actions at this level of existence have a consistency and coherence that they lacked in the previous sphere of existence. For many readers of Kierkegaard, the ethical is central. It calls each individual to take account of their lives and to scrutinize their actions in terms of absolute responsibility, which is what Kierkegaard calls repentance. If we compare Kierkegaard's idea of ethics with Vedic system of four aims of life, this Ethical system probably correlates most with Dharma - following this or that religion,set of rules, laws etc. (Hindus would call any religion as \"dharma\", though dharma is also a law). \"He repents himself back into himself, back into the family, back into the race, until he finds himself in God. Only on this condition can he choose himself. And this is the only condition he wants, for only in this way can he choose himself absolutely.\" ... “I repent myself out of the whole existence. Repentance specifically expresses that evil essentially belongs to me and at the same time expresses that it does not essentially belong to me. If the evil in me did not essentially belong to me, I could not choose it; but if there were something in me that I could not choose absolutely, then I would not be choosing myself absolutely at all, then I myself would not be the absolute but only a product.\" ... \"It is a sign of a well brought up child to be inclined to say it is sorry without too much pondering whether it is in the right or not, and it is likewise a sign of a high-minded person and a deep soul if he is inclined to repent, if he does not take God to court but repents and loves God in his repentance. Without this, his life is nothing, only like foam.\" ... \"The Either/Or I erected between living esthetically and living ethically is not an unqualified dilemma, because it actually is a matter of only one choice. Through this choice, I actually choose between good and evil, but I choose the good, I choose \"eo ipso\" the choice between good and evil. The original choice is forever present in every succeeding choice.\" Søren Kierkegaard, Either/Or Part II, Hong, p. 216-217, 224, 237-238, 219\n\n\"Judge Wilhelm,\" a pseudonymous author of \"Either/Or\" and the voice who defines the ethical consciousness, argues that the commitment to take responsibility for one's own choices must be made individually. To take responsibility for the various relationships in which an individual finds him- or herself is a possibility open to every human being, but it does not follow that every human being chooses to do so as a matter of course. The meaning of a person's life for Wilhelm depends on how he takes responsibility for his current and future choices, and how he takes ownership of those choices already made. For Wilhelm, the ethically governed person takes responsibility for past actions, some good and some bad, seeks consistency, and takes seriously the obligation to live in a passionate and devoted way. \nThe ethical and the religious are intimately connected: a person can be ethically serious without being religious, but the religious stage includes the ethical. Whereas living in the ethical sphere involves a commitment to some moral absolute, living in the religious sphere involves a commitment and relation to the Christian God. Kierkegaard explained this in \"Concluding Unscientific Postscript\" like this: \n\nThe Kierkegaardian pseudonyms who speak of stage theory consider religion to be the highest stage in human existence. In one discussion of religious life, one of Kierkegaard's pseudonyms, Johannes Climacus, distinguishes two types within this stage, which have been called \"Religiousness A\" and \"Religiousness B\". One type is symbolized by the Greek philosopher Socrates, whose passionate pursuit of the truth and individual conscience came into conflict with his society. Another type of religiousness is one characterized by the realization that the individual is sinful and is the source of untruth. In time, through revelation and in direct relationship with the paradox that is Jesus, the individual begins to see that his or her eternal salvation rests on a paradox—God, the transcendent, coming into time in human form to redeem human beings. For Kierkegaard, the very notion of this occurring was scandalous to human reason—indeed, it must be, and if it is not then one does not truly understand the Incarnation nor the meaning of human sinfulness. For Kierkegaard, the impulse towards an awareness of a transcendent power in the universe is what religion is. Religion has a social and an individual (not just personal) dimension. But it begins with the individual and his or her awareness of sinfulness. Here are several quotes from Kierkegaard's where he discusses his concept of sin. The sin/faith opposition is the Christian one which transforms all ethical concepts in a Christian way and distils one more decoction from them. At the root of the opposition lies the crucial Christian specification: before God; and that in turn has the crucial Christian characteristic: the absurd, the paradox, the possibility of offense. And it is of the utmost importance that this is demonstrated in every specification of the Christian, since offense is the Christian protection against all speculative philosophy. In what, then, do we find the possibility of offense here? In the fact that a person should have the reality of his being, as a particular human being, directly before God, and accordingly, again, and by the same token, that man’s sin should be of concern of God. This notion of the single human being before God never occurs to speculative thought; it only universalizes particular human phantastically into the human race. It is exactly for this reason that a disbelieving Christianity came up with the idea that sin is sin, that it is neither here nor there whether it is before God. In other words, it wanted to get rid of the specification ‘before God’, and to that end invented a new wisdom, which nevertheless, curiously enough, was neither more nor less than what the higher wisdom generally is-old paganism. \"The Sickness Unto Death\", Hannay, 1989 p. 115 Admittance is only through the consciousness of sin; to want to enter by any other road is high treason against Christianity. … The simple soul who humbly acknowledges himself to be a sinner, himself personally (the single individual), has no need at all to learn about all the difficulties that come when one is neither simple or humble. … To the extent Christianity, terrifying, will rise up against him and transform itself into madness or horror until he either learns to give up Christianity or-by means of what is anything but scholarly propaedeutics, apologetics, etc., by means of the anguish of a contrite conscience, all in proportion to his need-learns to enter into Christianity by the narrow way, through the consciousness of sin. \"Practice in Christianity\", Hong, 1991, p. 67-68\n\n Kierkegaard wrote much about Johann Gottlieb Fichte in his thesis \"The Concept of Irony\" as well as in his first book \"De omnibus dubitandum est\", written under the pseudonym Johannes Climacus, and his Journals. Fichte wrote the book \"The Vocation of Man\" (1800) which called for a progression in the life of the human being from doubt to knowledge and then to faith. \"De omnibus dubitandum est\" is from Descartes and means everything must be doubted. Both Kierkegaard and Fichte were interested in this idea of beginning with doubt as well as subjectivity. Kierkegaard wrote: \"In Fichte, subjectivity became free, infinite, negative. But in order for subjectivity to get out of this movement of emptiness in which it moved in infinite abstraction, it had to be negated; in order for thought to become actual, it had to become concrete.\"\n\nMany philosophers think that one of Kierkegaard's greatest contributions to philosophy is his critique of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. Indeed, many of Kierkegaard's works are written in response to or as a critique of Hegel. Although Kierkegaard strongly criticized some aspects of Hegelian philosophy, his work also shows that he was also positively influenced by Hegel, and had respect for Hegel himself.\nIn a journal entry made in 1844, Kierkegaard wrote:\nWhile Kierkegaard was a student of theology at the University of Copenhagen, Hegelianism had become increasingly popular. Johan Ludvig Heiberg and Hans Lassen Martensen were key figures in Danish Hegelianism. Kierkegaard remarked in his journal on 17 May 1843 that Heiberg's writings were \"borrowed\" from Hegel, implying Heiberg would have been a nobody without Hegel.\n\nKierkegaard objected to Hegel's claim that he had devised a system of thought that could explain the whole of reality, with a dialectical analysis of history leading the way to this whole. Hegel claimed that the doctrines and history of Christianity could be explained as a part of the rational unfolding and development of our understanding of the natural world and our place within it. Kierkegaard considered Hegel's explanation of Christianity as a necessary part of world history to be a distortion of the Christian message and a misunderstanding of the limits of human reason. He attempted to refute this aspect of Hegel's thought by suggesting that many doctrines of Christianity - including the doctrine of Incarnation, a God who is also human - cannot be explained rationally but remain a logical paradox. However, he was in favor of youthful striving after truth. \n\nTo refute Hegel's claim that Christianity should be understood as a part of the necessary evolution of thought, or in Hegelians terms, Spirit, in \"Fear and Trembling\", Kierkegaard attempts to use the story of Abraham to show that there is a goal higher than that of ethics (questioning the Hegelian claim that doing one's ethical duty is the highest that can be said of a human being) and that faith cannot be explained by Hegelian ethics, (disproving Hegel's claim that Christianity can be rationally explained by philosophy). Either way, this work can be read as a challenge to the Hegelian notion that a human being's ultimate purpose is to fulfill ethical demands.\nBy doing this, Hegelian critics accuse Kierkegaard of using the dialectic to disprove the dialectic, which seems somewhat contradictory and hypocritical. However, Kierkegaard would not claim the dialectic itself is bad, only the Hegelian premise that the dialectic \"would lead to a harmonious reconciliation of everything\", which Hegel called the Absolute. Kierkegaard stated this most clearly in his book \"The Concept of Anxiety\", Dogmatics must not explain hereditary sin but rather explain it by presupposing it, like that vortex about which Greek speculation concerning nature had so much to say, a moving something that no science can grasp. That such is the case with dogmatics will readily be granted if once again time is taken to understand Schleiermacher’s immortal service to this science. He was left behind long ago when men chose Hegel. Yet Schleiermacher was a thinker in the beautiful Greek sense, a thinker who spoke only of what he knew. Hegel, on the contrary, despite all his outstanding ability and stupendous learning, reminds us again and again by his performance that he was in the German sense a professor of philosophy on a large scale, because he \"a tout prix\" [at any price] must explain all things. \"The Concept of Anxiety\", by Reidar Thomte Princeton University Press 1980 P. 20\n\nKierkegaardian scholars have made several interpretations of how Kierkegaard proceeds with parodying Hegel's dialectic. One of the more popular interpretations argues the aesthetic-ethical-religious stages are the triadic process Kierkegaard was talking about. See section \"Spheres of existence\" for more information. Another interpretation argues for the world-individual-will triadic process. The dialectic here is either to assert an individual's own desire to be independent and the desire to be part of a community. Instead of reconciliation of the world and the individual where problems between the individual and society are neatly resolved in the Hegelian system, Kierkegaard argues that there's a delicate bond holding the interaction between them together, which needs to be constantly reaffirmed. Jean-Paul Sartre takes this latter view and says the individual is in a constant state of reaffirming his or her own identity, else one falls into bad faith.\n\nThis process of reconciliation leads to a \"both/and\" view of life, where both thesis and antithesis are resolved into a synthesis, which negates the importance of personal responsibility and the human choice of either/or. The work \"Either/Or\" is a response to this aspect of Hegel's philosophy. A passage from that work exemplifies Kierkegaard's contempt for Hegel's philosophy. Note the comparison between \"A\" and \"B\" (Judge Vilhelm) in \"Either/Or\" and \"Stages on Life's Way\". \n\nHere are two more from 1846\n\nThe whole idea of one generation spending all its time studying past generations and then the next generation spending their time studying past generations and making moral and social comments about preceding generations was called, \"The Hegelian cud-chewing process with three-stomachs - first immediacy - then regurgitation - then down again.\" He said, \"Maybe a succeeding master-mind could continue this with four stomachs, etc., down once more and up again. I don't know if the master-mind grasps what I mean.\"\n\nIn 1841–1842, Kierkegaard attended the Berlin lectures of Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling. Schelling was a critic of Georg Hegel and a professor at the University of Berlin. The university started a lecture series given by Schelling in order to espouse a type of positive philosophy which would be diametrically opposed to Hegelianism. Kierkegaard was initially delighted with Schelling. Before he left Copenhagen to attend Schelling's lectures in Berlin, he wrote to his friend Peter Johannes Sprang:\nAt Berlin, Kierkegaard gave high praises to Schelling. In a journal entry made sometime around October or November 1841, Kierkegaard wrote this piece about Schelling's second lecture:\nAs time went on, however, Kierkegaard, as well as many in Schelling's audience, began to become disillusioned with Schelling. In a particularly insulting letter about Schelling, Kierkegaard wrote to his brother, Peter Kierkegaard:\n\nKierkegaard became disillusioned with Schelling partly because Schelling shifted his focus on actuality, including a discussion on \"quid sit\" [what is] and \"quod sit\" [that is], to a more mythological, psychic-type pseudo-philosophy. Kierkegaard's last writing about Schelling's lectures was on 4 February 1842. He wrote the following in 1844, \n\nAlthough Schelling had little influence on Kierkegaard's subsequent writings, Kierkegaard's trip to Berlin provided him ample time to work on his masterpiece, \"Either/Or\". In a reflection about Schelling in 1849, Kierkegaard remarked that Schelling was \"like the Rhine at its mouth where it became stagnant water - he was degenerating into a Prussian \"Excellency\". (Journals, January 1849)\"\n\nKierkegaard became acquainted with Arthur Schopenhauer's writings quite late in his life. Kierkegaard felt Schopenhauer was an important writer, but disagreed on almost every point Schopenhauer made. In several journal entries made in 1854, a year before he died, Kierkegaard spoke highly of Schopenhauer:\nHowever, Kierkegaard also considered him, \"a most dangerous sign\" of things to come:\nKierkegaard believes Schopenhauer's ethical point of view is that the individual succeeds in seeing through the wretchedness of existence and then decides to deaden or mortify the joy of life. As a result of this complete asceticism, one reaches contemplation: the individual does this out of sympathy. He sympathizes with all the misery and the misery of others, which is to exist. Kierkegaard here is probably referring to the pessimistic nature of Schopenhauer's philosophy. One of Kierkegaard's main concerns is a suspicion of his whole philosophy:\nLittle else is known about Kierkegaard's attitude to Schopenhauer. On Schopenhauer himself, Kierkegaard felt that Schopenhauer would have been patronizing. \"Schopenhauer interests me very much, as does his fate in Germany. If I could talk to him I am sure he would shudder or laugh if I were to show him [my philosophy].\" \"(Journals, 1854)\"\n\nBecause Kierkegaard read Schopenhauer, and because Schopenhauer was heavily influenced by Eastern philosophy, it would seem that Kierkegaard would have shown an awareness of Eastern philosophy. There is, however, little direct reference to Asian thought in Kierkegaard's writings. Anyone who is familiar with such Asian traditions as Buddhist, Taoist, or Shinto philosophy, will quickly see the philosophical similarities that Kierkegaard shares with these traditions. These similarities perhaps explain the Japanese reception of Kierkegaard and the fact that Japanese awareness and translations of Kierkegaard were appearing at least 30 years before any English translations. There is also extensive Japanese scholarship on Kierkegaard, a scholarship that interprets Kierkegaard's philosophy in terms of Asian thought. This interpretation is understandable when one sees that Kierkegaard's central concerns of subjectivity, anxiety, freedom, despair, and self-deception, are also of central concern to Buddhism and, consequently, that there is nothing exclusively Christian about such concerns. Both Kierkegaard and Zen Buddhism, for example, have seen the predicaments of existence in very similar ways. A specific example of the similarities here can be seen in \"Purity of Heart\" where Kierkegaard describes the state of awareness that one must enter in order to partake of confession. Kierkegaard's description of this state is similar to the state of meditation described by Buddhist philosophers. It is distinct, however, in that the aim of confession, for Kierkegaard, is \"to center itself upon this relation to itself as an individual who is responsible to God\" (cf. Kierkegaard, \"Purity of Heart\"). Kierkegaard aims to claim back the subject from the \"crowd\" mentality of Christendom (cf. Kierkegaard, \"On the Dedication to 'That Single Individual' \") and reaffirm the absolute responsibility to God, which is our telos (cf. Kierkegaard, \"Fear and Trembling\").\n\nHarald Hoffding (1843-1931) helped introduce Kierkegaard to Western Europe in the early years of the 20th century. He compared Kierkegaard to Eastern philosophy in his 1914 book \"The Philosophy Of Religion\" in this way: \n\n\n\n"}

The term was invented by Robbie Parrish, a friend of neuroscientist David Eagleman who defined the term in relation to his book of fiction \"\". \nAsked whether he was an atheist or a religious person on a National Public Radio interview in February 2009, Eagleman replied \"I call myself a Possibilian: I'm open to...ideas that we don't have any way of testing right now.\" In a subsequent interview with the \"New York Times\", Eagleman expanded on the definition:\n\n\"Our ignorance of the cosmos is too vast to commit to atheism, and yet we know too much to commit to a particular religion. A third position, agnosticism, is often an uninteresting stance in which a person simply questions whether his traditional religious story (say, a man with a beard on a cloud) is true or not true. But with Possibilianism I'm hoping to define a new position — one that emphasizes the exploration of new, unconsidered possibilities. Possibilianism is comfortable holding multiple ideas in mind; it is not interested in committing to any particular story.\" \nIn a \"New Yorker\" profile of Eagleman—entitled \"The Possibilian\"—Burkhard Bilger wrote: \n\nScience had taught him to be skeptical of cosmic certainties, [Eagleman] told me. From the unfathomed complexity of brain tissue—\"essentially an alien computational material\"—to the mystery of dark matter, we know too little about our own minds and the universe around us to insist on strict atheism, he said. \"And we know far too much to commit to a particular religious story.\" Why not revel in the alternatives? Why not imagine ourselves, as he did in \"Sum\", as bits of networked hardware in a cosmic program, or as particles of some celestial organism, or any of a thousand other possibilities, and then test those ideas against the available evidence? \"Part of the scientific temperament is this tolerance for holding multiple hypotheses in mind at the same time,\" he said. \"As Voltaire said, uncertainty is an uncomfortable position. But certainty is an absurd one.\"\nAn adherent of possibilianism is called a possibilian. The possibilian perspective is distinguished from agnosticism in its active exploration of novel possibilities and its emphasis on the necessity of holding multiple positions at once if there is no available data to privilege one over the others. Eagleman has emphasized that possibilianism reflects the scientific temperament of creativity and intellectual humility in the face of \"the known unknowns.\"\n\nAccording to the \"Dallas Morning News\" and MSNBC, the possibilian concept—including various spellings (e.g. \"possibillion\") and modifications (e.g. \"possibilitarian\")—has become popular on the internet. By November 2009, \"The List\" Magazine wrote: \"Googling 'possibilian', the position Eagleman invented to explain his belief system, throws up the beginnings of a worldwide movement.\"\n\nArticles about possibilianism have appeared in major news outlets around the globe—for example, in the \"Daily Monitor\" of Uganda, \"The Economic Times of India\" and \"New Scientist\".\n\nIn an article in the \"New Statesman\", the atheist author Philip Pullman declared himself a possibilian, as did \"Wired magazine\" founding editor Kevin Kelly in an interview in the \"LA Times\". By April 2011, \"close to a thousand Facebook members had switched their religious affiliation to Possibilianism.\"\n\nSam Harris (a new atheist) has attacked possibilianism as \"intellectually dishonest\", and its description of strict atheism as a straw man. Harris writes that the position Eagleman espouses \"is, simply, atheism.\" Harris calls on Eagleman \"to admit that “possibilianism,” this middle position of yours, is just a piece of performance art, rather than a serious thesis.\"\nIn response, Eagleman stated that \"[Harris'] braggadocio appears to be emblematic of the neo-atheist posture, and confirms why I don't feel completely at home in that camp.\"\nJournalist Steve Volk in the Huffington Post suggested that Harris and Eagleman should be \"new allies\": \"If we're going to get beyond the typical exchanges between new atheists and the religious, I'd argue that it's through figures like Eagleman and Harris that we will find the most productive path: men who are eager to use science while demonstrating a capacity to consider ideas from other areas of human experience and systems of thought.\"\n\n\n"}

She lived perhaps in the 3rd century BC, and \"certainly not after the first century AD.\"\n\nAlmost nothing is known about her life; her work is known only from references in Porphyry's commentary on Ptolemy's \"Harmonics\". She shares the same place of origin (Cyrene, Libya) as Arete of Cyrene (a female philosopher of the Cyrenaic school, whose doctrines included Pythagorean elements) and Eratosthenes (whose many interests included music theory). She is one of several women writers associated with Pythagoreanism.\n\nIn her work, written in the form of a catechism, she commented on the music-theoretical debate concerning the proper roles of reason and sensory experience in the study of music. Despite her apparent adherence to Pythagoreanism, a school whose theorists (the \"canonici\") put music on a rational and mathematical basis, there is no apparent hostility in her citations of the empiricist followers of Aristoxenus (the \"musici\"); perhaps the methodological division was not a stark absolute during her period or from her point of view. Ptolemais also makes reference to musicologists who gave equal importance to perception and reason, preferring to see Aristoxenus himself (as opposed to his followers) in this light, and even stressing the compatible role of perception in the Pythagorean theory:\nIn this same passage, Ptolemais criticizes the extreme partisans of both schools, \"the Pythagoreans who enjoyed disputing with the musici\" for dismissing perception entirely (despite their contradictory \"adoption of something perceivable in the beginning\"), and \"some of the musici who follow Aristoxenus\" for adopting their master's \"theory based upon thought\" but proceeding \"through expertise on musical instruments\" and \"regard[ing] perception as authoritative, and reason as accompanying it, and for necessity only.\"\n\n\n"}

Qutb can refer to celestial movements and used as an astronomical term or a spiritual symbol. In Sufism, a Qutb is the perfect human being, \"al-insān al-kāmil\" (The Universal Man), who leads the saintly hierarchy. The Qutb is the Sufi spiritual leader that has a divine connection with God and passes knowledge on which makes him central to, or the axis of, Sufism, but he is unknown to the world. There are five Qutbs per era and they are infallible and trusted spiritual leaders. They are only revealed to a select group of mystics because there is a \"human need for direct knowledge of God\".\n\nAccording to the Institute of Ismaili Studies, \"In mystical literature, such as the writings of al–Tirmidhi, Abd al–Razzaq and Ibn Arabi (d. 1240), [Qutb] refers to the most perfect human being who is thought to be the universal leader of all saints, to mediate between the divine and the human and whose presence is deemed necessary for the existence of the world.\"\n\nIn the teachings of Al-Hakim al-Tirmidhi, there is evidence to suggest that the Qutb is the head of the saintly hierarchy which provides scriptural evidence to support the belief in the qutb. The hadīth attributed to Ibn Mas‘ūd has been used as proof that a qutb exists.\n\nThere are two different conceptions of the Qutb in Sufism: temporal Qutb and cosmic Qutb. The temporal and cosmic qutb are connected which guarantees that God is present in the world at all times. The temporal qutb is known as \"the helper\" or \"al-ghawth\" and is located in a person on Earth. The cosmic qutb is manifested in the temporal qutb as a virtue which can be traced back to al-Hallādj. The temporal qutb is the spiritual leader for the earth-bound saints. It is said that all beings - secret, animate, and inanimate - must give the qutb their pledge which gives him great authority. The only beings exempt from this are \"al-afrād\", which belong to the angels; the \"djinn\", who are under the jurisdiction of Khadir; and those who belong to the tenth stratum of \"ridjālal-ghayb\".\n\nDue to the nature of the Qutb, the location where he resides, whether temporal or cosmic, is questionable. It is thought by most that the Qutb is corporeally or spiritually present in Mecca at the Ka'ba, which is referred to as his \"maqām\".\n\nThe cosmic Qutb is the \"Axis of the Universe\" in a higher dimension from which originates the power (ultimately from Allah) of the temporal Qutb.\n\nThe cosmic hierarchy is the way that the spiritual power is ensured to exist through the cosmos. Two descriptions of the hierarchy come from notable Sufis. The first is Ali Hujwiri's divine court. There are three hundred \"akhyār\" (“excellent ones”), forty \"abdāl\" (“substitutes”), seven \"abrār\" (“piously devoted ones”), four \"awtād\" (“pillars”) three \"nuqabā\" (“leaders”) and one qutb.\n\nThe second version is Ibn Arabī’s which has a different, more exclusive structure. There are eight \"nujabā\" (“nobles”), twelve \"nuqabā\", seven \"abdāl\", four \"awtād\", two \"a’immah\" (“guides”), and the qutb.\n\nFor those named Qutb ad-Din, with many variant transliterations, see Qutb ad-Din.

He attended high school in Port of Spain Trinidad while his father was posted there and won a scholarship to the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. He graduated MA in 1889 and then spent three years at the divinity school of the Free Church of Scotland.\n\nFalconer was ordained in 1892 but never held a clerical position. He returned to Canada that year and took a lecturership in New Testament Greek and exegesis at the Presbyterian college in Halifax, Nova Scotia. He also began to publish articles in learned journals. In 1907 he became president of the University of Toronto. He steered a middle path, combining pure scholarship with practicality. Thus he introduced more vocational subjects, while also developing higher degree programmes. He sought to maximise the independence of the university, battling unsuccessfully to retain German faculty members in 1914. Nonetheless he was knighted in 1917 for his advocacy of wartime recruitment. Falconer believed in the need to increase public awareness of, and accessibility to, Canada's historical records. He was a long time member of The Champlain Society's Council, serving as its Vice-President (1909-1935) and President (1936-42).\n\nFalconer wrote several books on current affairs, including \"The German Tragedy and its Meaning for Canada\" (1915), \"Idealism in National Character\" (1920) and \"The United States as a Neighbour\" (1926).

{"id": "666420", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=666420", "title": "Sahaja Yoga", "text": "Sahaja Yoga\n\nSahaja Yoga is a religious movement founded in 1970 by Nirmala Srivastava (1923-2011), more widely known as Her Holiness Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi or as \"Mother\" by her followers, who are called Sahaja yogis. \n\nSahaja Yoga is not only the name of the movement, but also the meditation technique the movement teaches and the state of awareness that is said to be achieved by the technique. According to the movement, this state is the state of self-realization produced by kundalini awakening and is accompanied by the experience of thoughtless awareness or mental silence. The movement teaches the belief that self-realization through kundalini awakening is a transformation which can be experienced on the central nervous system and results in a more \"moral, united, integrated and balanced\" personality.\n\nSrivastava described Sahaja Yoga as the pure, universal religion integrating all other religions. She also claimed that she herself was a divine incarnation, more precisely an incarnation of the Holy Ghost, or the Adi Shakti of the Hindu tradition, the great mother goddess who had come to save humanity. This is also how she is regarded by most of her devotees.\n\nThe teachings, practices and beliefs of Sahaja Yoga are mainly Hindu-based, with a predominance of elements from mystical traditions, as well as local customs of India. There are however important elements of Christian origin, such as the eternal battle between good and evil. References to a variety of other religious, spiritual, mystical as well as modern scientific frameworks are also interwoven in Srivastava's teachings, although to a lesser degree.\n\nSahaja Yoga ashrams are present in diverse countries which include the following : Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark, France, Germany, India, Italy, Kuwait, Nigeria, United Kingdom, United States of America, but are not limited to the aforementioned countries.\n\nThe word 'Sahaja' in Sanskrit has two components: 'Saha' meaning 'with you' and 'ja' meaning 'born'. \"A Dictionary of Buddhism\" gives the literal translation of Sahaja as \"innate\" and defines it as \"denoting the natural presence of enlightenment (bodhi) or purity.\" and Yoga means \"union\" or \"yoking\" and refers to a spiritual path or a state of spiritual absorption. According to a book published by the movement, Sahaja Yoga means \"spontaneous\" and \"born with you\" meaning that the kundalini is born within us and can be awakened spontaneously, without effort.\n\nThe term 'Sahaja Yoga' goes back at least to the 15th Century Indian mystic Kabir. and has also been used to refer to Surat Shabd Yoga.\n\nIn 2000, the term 'Sahaja Yoga' was trademarked in the United States by Vishwa Nirmala Dharma.\n\nBefore starting Sahaja Yoga, its founder Nirmala Srivastava earned a reputation as a faith healer. With a small group of devotees around her, she began spreading her message of Sahaja Yoga in India in the year 1970. As she moved with her husband to London, UK, she continued her work there, and year by year the movement grew and spread throughout Europe, by the mid-80's reaching North America. In 1989, Srivastava made her first trip to Russia and Eastern Europe. Srivastava charged no money, insisting that her lesson was a birthright which should be freely available to all. \"There can be no peace in the world until there is peace within,\" she said.\n\nSahaja Yoga beliefs are seen by the organisation as a re-discovered ancient knowledge that should be treated respectfully and scientifically, like a hypothesis and if found by experiments as truth, should be accepted. Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi is considered to be an \"avatar\" by many of her followers and as a carrier of the divine presence which leads some critics to find the organization as cultic.\nAdvanced concepts are not generally taught until a beginner is understood to have gained enough knowledge of their own subtle system through actual experience. Without direct experience of the meditation, some people have reported difficulties understanding or proceeding to the more advanced material. Sociologist, Judith Coney, for example, reported facing a challenge in getting behind what she called \"the public facade\". She described Sahaja yogis as adopting a low profile with uncommitted individuals to avoid unnecessary conflict.\n\nSahaja Yoga also states that spreading Sahaja Yoga techniques should be free for everyone.\n\nJudith Coney observed that the movement tolerates a variety of world views and levels of commitment with some practitioners choosing to remain on the periphery.\n\nSahaja Yoga believes that in addition to our physical body there is a subtle body composed of nadis (channels) and chakras (energy centres). There is no biomedical evidence of chakras. Psychoanalyst Sudhir Kakar writes that Nirmala Srivastava's additions to this widespread traditional 'tantric' model include giving it a scientific, neurological veneer, an elaboration of the health aspects and an introduction of notions of traditional Christian morality. Nirmala Srivastava equates the Sushumna nadi with the parasympathetic nervous system, the Ida nadi with the left and the Pingala nadi with the right sides of the sympathetic nervous system.\nSahaja Yoga believes that the chakras can be balanced by awakening the kundalini in the sacrum bone, which is conceived of as a normally dormant 'mother' energy. Nirmala Srivastava has said that the kundalini is the reflection within us of the Holy Spirit or Adi (Primordial) Shakti. She has said that kundalini \"is the desire of God... and the desire of God is the Shakti\" and that yoga is impossible without kundalini awakening. As the kundalini rises through these centres, the qualities of the chakras are said to begin manifesting spontaneously. Most illnesses are said to be a result of damage to the chakras, and kundalini is said to repair them.\n\nAccording to Sahaja Yoga, once the sahasrara (topmost) chakra is pierced by the kundalini, a person will feel a cool breeze on top of their head and/or on their hands. The chakras and nadis are believed by Sahaja Yoga to have associated places on the hands. Sensations of heat or coolness in the hands, head and/or body are used to make purported diagnoses of imbalances in the different chakras and nadis. These sensations (referred to as 'vibrations') are interpreted in Sahaja Yoga as indicating Self-Realization or an \"encounter with Reality.\" The vibrations sensed are believed to be an objective divine energy that can even be caught on camera.\n\nA Sahaja Yoga belief is that upon self-realization, the practitioner may also experience thoughtless awareness (Nirvichar Samādhi).\n\nVishwa Nirmala Dharma (trans: Universal Pure Religion, also known as Sahaja Yoga International) is the organizational part of the movement. It is a registered organisation in countries such as Colombia, the United States of America, and Austria. It is registered as a religion in Spain. \n\nThe organisation is governed by the World Council for the Advancement of Sahaja Yoga (WCASY), proposed in 2003 and formed the following year.\n\nIn addition to directly promoting Sahaja Yoga, the council promotes Sahaja culture, runs schools, a health centre, a youth movement, and a project for the rehabilitation of \"destitute women and orphaned children\".\n\nThere are no available statistical data about Sahaja Yoga membership. In 2001, the number of core members worldwide were estimated to 10,000, in addition to which around 100,000 practitioners more or less in the periphery were estimated to be found. There are varying reports about the movement's distribution worldwide. According to the Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi Sahaja Yoga World Foundation, Sahaja Yoga centers are established in over 95 countries. In a news article in Indian Express published on the occasion of Srivastava's death in 2011, however, Sahaja Yoga centers were told to be found in over 140 countries.\n\n\nSahaja Yoga's youth movement is called \"Yuvashakti\" (also \"Nirmal Shakti Yuva Sangha\"), from the Sanskrit words Yuva (Youth) and Shakti (Power).\n\nThe movement is active in forums such as the World Youth Conference and TakingITGlobal which aim at discussing global issues, and ways of solving them.\n\nThe Yuvashakti participated in the 2000 \"Civil Society & Governance Project\" in which they were \"instrumental in reaching out to women from the poor communities and providing them with work\".\n\nThe \"Vishwa Nirmala Prem Ashram\" is a not-for profit project by the NGO Vishwa Nirmala Dharma (Sahaja Yoga International) located in Noida, Delhi, India, opened in 2003. The ashram is a \"facility where women and girls are rehabilitated by being taught meditation and other skills that help them overcome trauma\".\n\nThe methods for practising Sahaja Yoga are made available free of charge to those interested. According to the official Sahaja Yoga website there is a fee for attending international pujas to cover costs and voluntary dakshina.\n\nAccording to author David V. Barrett, \"Shri Mataji neither charged for her lectures nor for her ability to give Self Realization, nor does one have to become a member of this organisation. She insisted that one cannot pay for enlightenment and she continued to denounce the false self-proclaimed 'gurus' who are more interested in the seekers' purse than their spiritual ascent\". However, the movement had been criticised because of encouragement of its members to make donations to pay the travel charges for Mataji's visits to their respective countries.\n\nJudith Coney found that most people who leave the movement voluntarily still had positive things to say about it. A smaller group of ex-members have made complaints against the movement which have been reported in the press. In 2001, \"The Independent\" reported that certain ex-members say \"that Sahaja Yoga is a cult which aims to control the minds of its members\" and ex-members claim that the organisation insists all family ties are broken and all communication with them cease. The article further details a number of beliefs - including that crying children are possessed by daemons, that negative and positive vibrations need 'clearing', advocates husbands slapping their spouses and hides many of the more occult practices from new members - including the high costs for participating in rituals. In 2005, \"The Record\" reported that some critics who feel that the group is a cult have started their own websites. In response to this, Sahaja yogis in one centre reflected on the ways in which some of their beliefs are disguised when in contact with non-members. Coney described this discussion as a \"frank and revealing\".\n\nA 2008 court case in Brussels ruled that Sahaja Yoga had been wrongly labelled as a cult by a Belgian state authority and awarded the group compensation.\n\nIn 2013, \"De Morgen\" reported that the Belgian Department of State Security monitors how often politicians are contacted and lobbied by organisations. The list of organisations includes Sahaja Yoga, as well as Scientology and The Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nIn 2001, The \"Evening Standard\" reported that Sahaja Yoga has been \"described as a dangerous cult\" and \"has a dissident website created by former members\". The reporter, John Crace, wrote about an event he attended and noted that a Sahaja Yoga representative asked him to feel free to talk to whomever he wanted. He remarked, \"Either their openness is a PR charm offensive, or they genuinely have nothing to hide.\" He proposed that \"one of the key definitions of a cult is the rigour with which it strives to recruit new members\" and concluded that there was no aggressive recruitment squeeze.\n\nA 2001 INFORM leaflet says that the emphasis on complete devotion has led to problems and controversy. There is a culture amongst a minority of Sahaja yogis to believe that those who deviate in particular ways may be possessed by 'negativity' or may be said to be mentally abnormal. Those who fight the pressure to follow the Guru's suggestions and radically change their lifestyle risk being expelled. It is claimed that this may bring problems for those who still believe in the power of the Guru and fear 'losing vibrations'. This expulsion is not enforced but is something understood socially and other yogis are not expected to change the way they react to those who have been expelled. It is also not a permanent expulsion; there have been cases of returning Sahaja yogis following brief periods 'out'.\n\nDavid V. Barrett wrote that some former members say that they were expelled from the movement because they \"resisted influence that Mataji had over their lives\". According to Barrett, the movement's founder's degree of control over members' lives has given rise to concerns. The Austrian Ministry for Environment, Youth and Family states that \"Sahaja Yoga\" regards Nirmala Srivastava as an authority who cannot be questioned.\n\nIn the meditation practice of the Sahaja movement the focus is on thoughts ceasing.\n\nA study comparing practitioners of Sahaja Yoga meditation with a group of non-meditators doing a simple relaxation exercise measured a drop in skin temperature in the meditators compared to a rise in skin temperature in the non-meditators as they relaxed. The researchers noted that all other meditation studies that have observed skin temperature have recorded increases and none has recorded a decrease in skin temperature. This suggests that Sahaja Yoga meditation, being a mental silence approach, may differ both experientially and physiologically from simple relaxation. Other brain characteristics have also been found.\n\nSahaja meditators appear to benefit from lower depression and scored above a broad control group for emotional well-being and mental health measures on SF-36 ratings, but this may reflect other factors, such as meditators being more interested in self care.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "179955", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=179955", "title": "Simone Weil", "text": "Simone Weil\n\nSimone Adolphine Weil (; ; 3 February 1909 – 24 August 1943) was a French philosopher, mystic, and political activist. The mathematician Andre Weil was her brother.\n\nAfter her graduation from formal education, Weil became a teacher. She taught intermittently throughout the 1930s, taking several breaks due to poor health and to devote herself to political activism, work that would see her assisting in the trade union movement, taking the side of the Anarchists known as the Durruti Column in the Spanish Civil War, and spending more than a year working as a labourer, mostly in auto factories, so she could better understand the working class.\n\nTaking a path that was unusual among twentieth-century left-leaning intellectuals, she became more religious and inclined towards mysticism as her life progressed. Weil wrote throughout her life, though most of her writings did not attract much attention until after her death. In the 1950s and 1960s, her work became famous in continental Europe and throughout the English-speaking world. Her thought has continued to be the subject of extensive scholarship across a wide range of fields. A meta study from the University of Calgary found that between 1995 and 2012 over 2,500 new scholarly works had been published about her. \nAlbert Camus described her as \"the only great spirit of our times\".\n\nWeil was born in her parents' apartment in Paris on 3 February 1909. Her mother was Saolomea Weil and her father Bernard was a medical doctor. Both were Alsatian Jews who had moved to Paris after the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine by Germany. Weil was a healthy baby for her first six months, until she had a severe attack of appendicitis—thereafter she struggled with poor health throughout her life. She was the second of her parents' two children; her older brother was mathematician André Weil, with whom she would always enjoy a close relationship. Their parents were agnostic and fairly affluent, raising their children in an attentive and supportive atmosphere.\n\nWeil suffered some distress due to her father's having to leave home for several years after being drafted in World War I. According to several Weil scholars, including Eva Fogelman and Robert Coles, this experience may have been related to the exceptionally strong altruism displayed throughout her life. \nWeil acquired from her family home an obsession with cleanliness; in her later life she would sometimes speak of her \"disgustingness\" and think that others would see her this way, despite the fact that in her youth she was considered highly attractive. Despite the fact that Weil was generally highly affectionate, she almost always avoided any form of physical contact, even with female friends.\n\nAccording to her friend and biographer, Simone Pétrement, Weil decided early in life that she would need to adopt masculine qualities and sacrifice opportunities to have love affairs in order to fully pursue her vocation to improve social conditions for the disadvantaged. From her late teenage years, Weil would generally disguise her \"fragile beauty\" by adopting a masculine appearance, hardly ever using makeup and often wearing men's clothes.\n\nWeil was a precocious student, proficient in Ancient Greek by age 12. She later learned Sanskrit after reading the Bhagavad Gita. Like the Renaissance thinker Pico della Mirandola, her interests in other religions were universal and she attempted to understand each religious tradition as an expression of transcendent wisdom.\n\nAs a teenager, Weil studied at the Lycée Henri IV under the tutelage of her admired teacher Émile Chartier, more commonly known as \"Alain\". Her first attempt at the entrance examination for the École Normale Supérieure in June 1927 ended in failure, due to her low marks in history. In 1928 she was successful in gaining admission. She finished first in the exam for the certificate of \"General Philosophy and Logic\"; Simone de Beauvoir finished second. During these years, Weil attracted much attention with her radical opinions. She was called the \"Red virgin\", and even \"The Martian\" by her admired mentor.\n\nAt the École Normale Supérieure, she studied philosophy, earning her DES (\"\", roughly equivalent to an MA) in 1931 with a thesis under the title \"Science et perfection dans Descartes\" (\"Science and Perfection in Descartes\"). She received her \"agrégation\" that same year. Weil taught philosophy at a secondary school for girls in Le Puy and teaching was her primary employment during her short life.\n\nWeil's most famous works were published posthumously.\n\nShe often became involved in political action out of sympathy with the working class. In 1915, when she was only six years old, she refused sugar in solidarity with the troops entrenched along the Western Front. In 1919, at 10 years of age, she declared herself a Bolshevik. In her late teens, she became involved in the workers' movement. She wrote political tracts, marched in demonstrations, and advocated workers' rights. At this time, she was a Marxist, pacifist, and trade unionist. While teaching in Le Puy, she became involved in local political activity, supporting the unemployed and striking workers despite criticism. Weil had never formally joined the Communist party, and in her twenties she became increasingly critical of Marxism. According to Pétrement, she was one of the first to identify a new form of oppression not anticipated by Marx, where élite bureaucrats could make life just as miserable for ordinary people as did the most exploitative capitalists.\n\nIn 1932, Weil visited Germany to help Marxist activists who were at the time considered to be the strongest and best organised communists in Western Europe, but Weil considered them no match for the then up-and-coming fascists. When she returned to France, her political friends in France dismissed her fears, thinking Germany would continue to be controlled by the centrists or those to the left. After Hitler rose to power in 1933, Weil spent much of her time trying to help German communists fleeing his regime. Weil would sometimes publish articles about social and economic issues, including \"Oppression and Liberty\" and numerous short articles for trade union journals. This work criticised popular Marxist thought and gave a pessimistic account of the limits of both capitalism and socialism. Trotsky himself personally responded to several of her articles, attacking both her ideas and her as a person. However, according to Pétrement, he was influenced by some of Weil's ideas.\n\nWeil participated in the French general strike of 1933, called to protest against unemployment and wage cuts. The following year, she took a 12-month leave of absence from her teaching position to work incognito as a labourer in two factories, one owned by Renault, believing that this experience would allow her to connect with the working class. In 1935, she resumed teaching and donated most of her income to political causes and charitable endeavours.\n\nIn 1936, despite her professed pacifism, she travelled to the Spanish Civil War on the Republican side, and joined the anarchist columns of Buenaventura Durruti. She even took a rifle, but was expelled from combat line by her comrades, as she was extremely short-sighted, and they feared Simone shooting one of them. She hit a pot of boiling liquid because of her short-sightedness, had noticeable burns, and her family came to Spain to bring her back home. During her stay in the Aragon front, she sent some chronicles to the French publication: 'Le Libertaire'. She identified herself as an anarchist, and upon arriving in Spain, sought out the anti-fascist commander Julián Gorkin, asking to be sent on a mission as a covert agent, to rescue the prisoner Joaquín Maurín. Gorkin refused, saying she would almost certainly be sacrificing herself for nothing, as it would be most unlikely she could pass as a Spaniard. Weil replied that she had \"every right\" to sacrifice herself if she chose, but after arguing for more than an hour, she was unable to convince Gorkin to give her the assignment. Instead she joined a unit of the Sébastien Faure Century, which specialised in high-risk \"commando\"-style engagements.\n\nThe unit was part of the French-speaking section of the anarchist militia. From seeing her practice on makeshift shooting ranges, her comrades saw she was a very poor shot and tried to avoid taking her on missions, though she did sometimes insist. Her only direct participation in combat was to shoot with her rifle at a bomber during an air raid; in a second raid, she tried to man the group's heavy machine gun, but her comrades prevented her, as they thought it would be best for someone less clumsy and short-sighted to use the weapon. After being with the group for a few weeks, she burnt herself over a cooking fire. She was forced to leave the unit, and was met by her parents who had followed her to Spain. They helped her leave the country, to recuperate in Assisi. About a month after her departure, Weil's unit was nearly wiped out at an engagement in Perdiguera in October 1936, with every woman in the group being killed. On returning to Paris, Weil continued to write essays on labour, on management, war and peace.\n\nWeil was born into a secular household and raised in \"complete agnosticism\".\nAs a teenager, she considered the existence of God for herself and decided nothing could be known either way. In her \"Spiritual Autobiography\" however, Weil records that she always had a Christian outlook, taking to heart from her earliest childhood the idea of loving one's neighbour. Weil became attracted to the Christian faith beginning in 1935, the first of three pivotal experiences for her being when she was moved by the beauty of villagers singing hymns during an outdoor service that she stumbled across during a holiday to Portugal.\nWhile in Assisi in the spring of 1937, Weil experienced a religious ecstasy in the Basilica of Santa Maria degli Angeli—the same church in which Saint Francis of Assisi had prayed. She was led to pray for the first time in her life as Cunningham (2004: p. 118) relates: \nBelow the town is the beautiful church and convent of San Damiano where Saint Clare once lived. Near that spot is the place purported to be where Saint Francis composed the larger part of his \"Canticle of Brother Sun\". Below the town in the valley is the ugliest church in the entire environs: the massive baroque basilica of Saint Mary of the Angels, finished in the seventeenth century and rebuilt in the nineteenth century, which houses a rare treasure: a tiny Romanesque chapel that stood in the days of Saint Francis—the \"Little Portion\" where he would gather his brethren. It was in that tiny chapel that the great mystic Simone Weil first felt compelled to kneel down and pray.\n\nShe had another, more powerful, revelation a year later while reciting George Herbert's poem \"Love III\", after which \"Christ himself came down and took possession of me\", and, from 1938 on, her writings became more mystical and spiritual, while retaining their focus on social and political issues. She was attracted to Roman Catholicism, but declined to be baptized, preferring to remain outside due to \"the love of those things that are outside Christianity\". During World War II, she lived for a time in Marseille, receiving spiritual direction from a Dominican Friar. Around this time, she met the French Catholic author Gustave Thibon, who later edited some of her work.\n\nWeil did not limit her curiosity to Christianity. She was keenly interested in other religious traditions—especially the Greek and Egyptian mysteries; Hinduism (especially the Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita); and Mahayana Buddhism. She believed that all these and other traditions contained elements of genuine revelation, writing that: \nGreece, Egypt, ancient India, the beauty of the world, the pure and authentic reflection of this beauty in art and science...these things have done as much as the visibly Christian ones to deliver me into Christ's hands as his captive. I think I might even say more. \nShe was, nevertheless, opposed to religious syncretism, claiming that it effaced the particularity of the individual traditions: \nEach religion is alone true, that is to say, that at the moment we are thinking of it we must bring as much attention to bear on it as if there were nothing else ... A \"synthesis\" of religion implies a lower quality of attention.\n\nIn 1942, Weil traveled to the United States of America with her family. She had been reluctant to leave France, but agreed to do so as she wanted to see her parents to safety and knew they would not leave without her. She was also encouraged by the fact that it would be relatively easy for her to reach Britain from the United States, where she could join the French Resistance. She had hopes of being sent back to France as a covert agent.\n\nOlder biographies suggest Weil made no further progress in achieving her desire to return to France as an agent—she was limited to desk work in London, although this did give her time to write one of her largest and best known works: \"The Need for Roots\".\nYet there is now evidence that Weil was recruited by the Special Operations Executive, with a view to sending her back to France as a clandestine wireless operator. In May 1943, plans were underway to send her to Thame Park in Oxfordshire for training, but were cancelled soon after, as her failing health became known.\nThe punishing work-régime she assumed soon took a heavy toll; in 1943, she was diagnosed with tuberculosis and instructed to rest and eat well. However, she refused special treatment because of her long-standing political idealism and her detachment from material things. Instead, she limited her food intake to what she believed residents of German-occupied France ate. She most likely ate even less, as she refused food on most occasions. Her condition quickly deteriorated, and she was moved to a sanatorium in Ashford, Kent, England.\n\nAfter a lifetime of battling illness and frailty, Weil died in August 1943 from cardiac failure at the age of 34. The coroner's report said that \"the deceased did kill and slay herself by refusing to eat whilst the balance of her mind was disturbed\".\n\nThe exact cause of her death remains a subject of debate. Some claim that her refusal to eat came from her desire to express some form of solidarity toward the victims of the war. Others think that Weil's self-starvation occurred after her study of Schopenhauer. (In his chapters on Christian saintly asceticism and salvation, Schopenhauer had described self-starvation as a preferred method of self-denial). However, Simone Pétrement, one of Weil's first and most significant biographers, regards the coroner's report as simply mistaken. Basing her opinion on letters written by the personnel of the sanatorium at which Simone Weil was treated, Pétrement affirms that Weil asked for food on different occasions while she was hospitalized and even ate a little bit a few days before her death; according to her, it is in fact Weil's poor health condition that eventually made her unable to eat.\n\nWeil's first English biographer, Richard Rees, offers several possible explanations for her death, citing her compassion for the suffering of her countrymen in Occupied France and her love for and close imitation of Christ. Rees sums up by saying: \"As for her death, whatever explanation one may give of it will amount in the end to saying that she died of love\".\n\nWhile \"Gravity and Grace\" () is one of the books most associated with Simone Weil, the work was not one she wrote to be published \"as a book\". Rather, the work consists of various passages selected from Weil's notebooks and arranged topically by Gustave Thibon, who knew and befriended her. Weil had in fact given to Thibon some of her notebooks, written before May 1942, but not with any idea or request to publish them. Hence, the resulting work, in its selections, organization and editing, is much influenced by Mr. Thibon, a devout Catholic. (See Thibon's Introduction to \"Gravity and Grace\" (Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1952).)\n\nT. S. Eliot's preface to \"The Need for Roots\" suggests that Weil might be regarded as a modern-day Marcionite, due to her virtually wholesale rejection of the Old Testament and her overall distaste for the Judaism that was technically hers by birth. Her niece, Sylvie Weil, and biographer Thomas R. Nevin have sought, on the contrary, to demonstrate that Weil did not reject Judaism and was heavily influenced by its precepts.\n\nAbsence is the key image for her metaphysics, cosmology, cosmogony, and theodicy. She believed that God created by an act of self-delimitation—in other words, because God is conceived as a kind of utter fullness, a perfect being, no creature could exist except where God was not. Thus creation occurred only when God withdrew in part. Similar ideas occur in Jewish mysticism.\n\nThis is, for Weil, an original \"kenosis\" (\"emptiness\") preceding the corrective kenosis of Christ's incarnation (cf. Athanasius). We are thus born in a sort of damned position not owing to original sin as such, but because to be created at all we had to be precisely what God is not, i.e., we had to be the opposite of what is holy. (See Apophatic theology.)\n\nThis notion of creation is a cornerstone of her theodicy, for if creation is conceived this way (as necessarily containing evil within itself), then there is no problem of the entrance of evil into a perfect world. Nor does this constitute a delimitation of God's omnipotence, if it is not that God could not create a perfect world, but that the act which we refer towards by saying \"create\" in its very essence implies the impossibility of perfection.\n\nHowever, this notion of the necessity of evil does not mean that we are simply, originally, and continually doomed; on the contrary, Weil tells us that \"Evil is the form which God's mercy takes in this world\". Weil believed that evil, and its consequence, affliction, served the role of driving us out of ourselves and towards God—\"The extreme affliction which overtakes human beings does not create human misery, it merely reveals it.\"\n\nWeil's concept of affliction (\"malheur\") goes beyond simple suffering, though it certainly includes it. Only some souls are capable of truly experiencing affliction; these are precisely those souls which are least deserving of it—that are most prone or open to spiritual realization. Affliction is a sort of suffering \"plus\", which transcends both body and mind; such physical and mental anguish scourges the very soul.\n\nWar and oppression were the most intense cases of affliction within her reach; to experience it, she turned to the life of a factory worker, while to understand it she turned to Homer's \"Iliad\". (Her essay \"The Iliad or the Poem of Force\", first translated by Mary McCarthy, is a piece of Homeric literary criticism.) Affliction was associated both with necessity and with chance—it was fraught with necessity because it was hard-wired into existence itself, and thus imposed itself upon the sufferer with the full force of the inescapable, but it was also subject to chance inasmuch as chance, too, is an inescapable part of the nature of existence. The element of chance was essential to the unjust character of affliction; in other words, my affliction should not usually—let alone always—follow from my sin, as per traditional Christian theodicy, but should be visited upon me for no special reason.\n\nThe concept of \"metaxu\", which Weil borrowed from Plato, is that which both separates and connects (e.g., as a wall separates two prisoners but can be used to tap messages). This idea of connecting distance was of the first importance for Weil's understanding of the created realm. The world as a whole, along with any of its components, including our physical bodies, is to be regarded as serving the same function for us in relation to God that a blind man's stick serves for him in relation to the world about him. They do not afford direct insight, but can be used experimentally to bring the mind into practical contact with reality. This metaphor allows any absence to be interpreted as a presence, and is a further component in Weil's theodicy.\n\nFor Weil, \"The beautiful is the experimental proof that the incarnation is possible\". The beauty which is inherent in the form of the world (this inherency is proven, for her, in geometry, and expressed in all good art) is the proof that the world points to something beyond itself; it establishes the essentially telic character of all that exists. Her concept of beauty extends throughout the universe: \"we must have faith that the universe is beautiful on all levels...and that it has a fullness of beauty in relation to the bodily and psychic structure of each of the thinking beings that actually do exist and of all those that are possible. It is this very agreement of an infinity of perfect beauties that gives a transcendent character to the beauty of the world...He (Christ) is really present in the universal beauty. The love of this beauty proceeds from God dwelling in our souls and goes out to God present in the universe\". She also wrote that \"The beauty of this world is Christ's tender smile coming to us through matter\".\n\nBeauty also served a soteriological function for Weil: \"Beauty captivates the flesh in order to obtain permission to pass right to the soul.\" It constitutes, then, another way in which the divine reality behind the world invades our lives. Where affliction conquers us with brute force, beauty sneaks in and topples the empire of the self from within.\n\nWeil's book \"The Need for Roots\" was written in early 1943, immediately before her death later that year. She was in London working for the French Resistance and trying to convince its leader, Charles de Gaulle, to form a contingent of nurses who would serve at the front lines.\n\n\"The Need for Roots\" has an ambitious plan. It sets out to address the past and to set out a road map for the future of France after World War II. She painstakingly analyzes the spiritual and ethical milieu that led to France's defeat by the German army, and then addresses these issues with the prospect of eventual French victory.\n\nDuring her lifetime, Weil was only known to relatively narrow circles; even in France, her essays were mostly read only by those interested in radical politics. Yet during the first decade after her death, Weil rapidly became famous, attracting attention throughout the West. For the 3rd quarter of the twentieth century, she was widely regarded as the most influential person in the world on new work concerning religious and spiritual matters. Her philosophical, social and political thought also became popular, although not to the same degree as her religious work.\n\nAs well as influencing fields of study, Weil deeply affected the personal lives of numerous individuals; Pope Paul VI, for example, said that Weil was one of his three greatest influences. Weil's popularity began to decline in the late sixties and seventies. However more of her work was gradually published, leading to many thousands of new secondary works by Weil scholars; some of whom focused on achieving a deeper understanding of her religious, philosophical and political work. Others broadened the scope of Weil scholarship to investigate her applicability to fields like classical studies, cultural studies, education and even technical fields like ergonomics. In 2010, Julia Haslett released the film \"An encounter with Simone Weil\"; she noted that Weil had become \"a little-known figure, practically forgotten in her native France, and rarely taught in universities or secondary schools\". \nHowever Weil's work has continued to be the subject of ongoing scholarship, with a metastudy finding that over 2500 new scholarly works had been published about her between 1995 and 2012.\n\nMany commentators who have assessed Weil as a person were highly positive; many described her as a saint, some even as the greatest saint of the twentieth century, including T. S. Eliot, Dwight Macdonald, Leslie Fiedler, and Robert Coles. Weil biographer Gabriella Fiori writes that Weil was \"a moral genius in the orbit of ethics, a genius of immense revolutionary range.\" In 1951 Albert Camus wrote that she was \"the only great spirit of our times.\" Foolish though she may have appeared at times—dropping a suitcase full of French resistance papers all over the sidewalk and scrambling to gather them up—her deep engagement with both the theory and practice of caritas, in all its myriad forms, functions as the unifying force of her life and thought. Gustave Thibon, the French philosopher and close friend, recounts their last meeting, not long before her death: \"I will only say that I had the impression of being in the presence of an absolutely transparent soul which was ready to be reabsorbed into original light\".\n\nWeil has however been criticised even by those who otherwise deeply admired her, such as Eliot, for being excessively prone to divide the world into good and evil, and for her sometimes intemperate judgments. Weil was a harsh critic of the influence of Judaism on Western civilisation, and an even harsher critic of the Roman empire, in which she refused to see any value at all. On the other hand, according to Eliot, she held up the Cathars as exemplars of goodness, despite there being in his view little concrete evidence on which to base such an assessment. According to Pétrement she idolised Lawrence of Arabia, considering him to be a Saint. A few critics have taken an overall negative view: several Jewish writers, including Susan Sontag, accused her of anti-Semitism, though this was far from a universal shared perspective. A small minority of commentators have judged her to be psychologically unbalanced or sexually obsessed. General Charles de Gaulle, her ultimate boss while she worked for the \"French Resistance\", considered her \"insane\", though even he was influenced by her and repeated some of her sayings for years after her death.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1673736", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1673736", "title": "Sociology of the history of science", "text": "Sociology of the history of science\n\nThe sociology and philosophy of science, as well as the entire field of science studies, have in the 20th century been occupied with the question of large-scale patterns and trends in the development of science, and asking questions about how science \"works\" both in a philosophical and practical sense.\n\nScience as a social enterprise has been developing exponentially for the past few centuries. In antiquity, the few people who were able to engage in natural inquiry were either wealthy themselves, had rich benefactors, or had the support of a religious community. Today, scientific research has tremendous government support and also ongoing support from the private sector.\n\nAvailable methods of communication have improved tremendously over time. Instead of waiting months or years for a hand-copied letter to arrive, today scientific communication can be practically instantaneous. Earlier, most natural philosophers worked in relative isolation, due to the difficulty and slowness of communication. Still, there was a considerable amount of cross-fertilization between distant groups and individuals.\n\nNowadays, almost all modern scientists participate in a scientific community, hypothetically global in nature (though often based around a relatively few nations and institutions of stature), but also strongly segregated into different fields of study. The scientific community is important because it represents a source of established knowledge which, if used properly, ought to be more reliable than personally acquired knowledge of any given individual. The community also provides a feedback mechanism, often in the form of practices such as peer review and reproducibility. Most items of scientific content (experimental results, theoretical proposals, or literature reviews) are reported in scientific journals and are hypothetically subjected to peer scrutiny, though a number of scholarly critics from both inside and outside the scientific community have, in recent decades, began to question the effect of commercial and government investment in science on the peer review and publishing process, as well as the internal disciplinary limitations to the scientific publication process.\n\nA major development of the Scientific Revolution was the foundation of scientific societies: Academia Secretorum Naturae (Accademia dei Segreti, the Academy of the Mysteries of Nature) can be considered the first scientific community; founded in Naples 1560 by Giambattista della Porta. The Academy had an exclusive membership rule: discovery of a new law of nature was a prerequisite for admission. It was soon shut down by Pope Paul V for alleged sorcery.\n\nThe Academia Secretorum Naturae was replaced by the Accademia dei Lincei, which was founded in Rome in 1603. The Lincei included Galileo as a member, but failed upon his condemnation in 1633. The Accademia del Cimento, Florence 1657, lasted 10 years. The Royal Society of London, 1660 to the present day, brought together a diverse collection of scientists to discuss theories, conduct experiments, and review each other's work. The Académie des Sciences was created as an institution of the government of France 1666, meeting in the King's library. The Akademie der Wissenschaften began in Berlin 1700.\n\nEarly scientific societies provided valuable functions, including a community open to and interested in empirical inquiry, and also more familiar with and more educated about the subject. In 1758, with the aid of his pupils, Lagrange established a society, which was subsequently incorporated as the Turin Academy.\n\nMuch of what is considered the modern institution of science was formed during its professionalization in the 19th century. During this time the location of scientific research shifted primarily to universities, though to some extent it also became a standard component of industry as well. In the early years of the 20th century, especially after the role of science in the first World War, governments of major industrial nations began to invest heavily in scientific research. This effort was dwarfed by the funding of scientific research undertaken by all sides in World War II, which produced such \"wonder weapons\" as radar, rocketry, and the atomic bomb. During the Cold War, a large amount of government resources were poured into science by the United States, USSR, and many European powers. It was during this time that DARPA funded nationwide computer networks, one of them eventually under the internet protocol. In the post-Cold War era, a decline in government funding from many countries has been met with an increase of industrial and private investment. The funding of science is a major factor in its historical and global development. So although science is hypothetically international in scope, in a practical sense it has usually centered around wherever it could find the most funding.\n\n\nOne of the basic requirements for a scientific community is the existence and approval of a political sponsor; in England, the Royal Society operates under the aegis of the monarchy; in the US, the National Academy of Sciences was founded by Act of the United States Congress; etc. Otherwise, when the basic elements of knowledge were being formulated, the political rulers of the respective communities could choose to arbitrarily either support or disallow the nascent scientific communities. For example, Alhazen had to feign madness to avoid execution. The polymath Shen Kuo lost political support, and could not continue his studies until he came up with discoveries that showed his worth to the political rulers. The admiral Zheng He could not continue his voyages of exploration after the emperors withdrew their support. Another famous example was the suppression of the work of Galileo, by the twentieth century, Galileo would be pardoned.\n\nOne of the major occupations with those interested in the history of science is whether or not it displays certain patterns or trends, usually along the question of change between one or more scientific theories. Generally speaking, there have historically been three major models adopted in various forms within the philosophy of science.\n\nThe first major model, implicit in most early histories of science and generally a model put forward by practicing scientists themselves in their textbook literature, is associated with the criticisms of logical positivism by Karl Popper (1902–1994) from the 1930s. Popper's model of science is one in which scientific progress is achieved through a falsification of incorrect theories and the adoption instead of theories which are progressively closer to truth. In this model, scientific progress is a linear accumulation of facts, each one adding to the last. In this model, the physics of Aristotle (384 BC322 BC) was simply subsumed by the work of Isaac Newton (1642–1727) (classical mechanics), which itself was eclipsed by the work of Albert Einstein (1879–1955) (Relativity), and later the theory of quantum mechanics (established in 1925), each one more accurate than the last.\n\nA major challenge to this model came from the work of the historian and philosopher Thomas Kuhn (1922–1996) in his work \"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\" published in 1962. Kuhn, a former physicist, argued against the view that scientific progress was linear, and that modern scientific theories were necessarily just more accurate versions of theories of the past. Rather, Kuhn's version of scientific development consisted of dominant structures of thought and practices, which he called \"paradigms\", in which research went through phases of \"normal\" science (\"puzzle solving\") and \"revolutionary\" science (testing out new theories based on new assumptions, brought on by uncertainty and crisis in existing theories). In Kuhn's model, different paradigms represented entirely different and incommensurate assumptions about the universe. The mode was thus uncertain about whether paradigms shifted in a way which necessarily relied upon greater attainment of truth. In Kuhn's view, Aristotle's physics, Newton's classical mechanics, and Einstein's Relativity were entirely different ways to think about the world; each successive paradigm defined what questions could be asked about the world and (perhaps arbitrarily) discarded aspects of the previous paradigm which no longer seemed applicable or important. Kuhn claimed that far from merely building on the previous theory's accomplishments, each new paradigm essentially throws out the old way of looking at the universe, and comes up with its own vocabulary to describe it and its own guidelines for expanding knowledge within the new paradigm.\n\nKuhn's model met with much suspicion from scientists, historians, and philosophers. Some scientists felt that Kuhn went too far in divorcing scientific progress from truth; many historians felt that his argument was too codified for something as polyvariant and historically contingent as scientific change; and many philosophers felt that the argument did not go far enough. The furthest extreme of such reasoning was put forth by the philosopher Paul Feyerabend (1924–1994), who argued that there were no consistent methodologies used by all scientists at all times which allowed certain forms of inquiry to be labeled \"scientific\" in a way which made them different from any other form of inquiry, such as witchcraft. Feyerabend argued harshly against the notion that falsification was ever truly followed in the history of science, and noted that scientists had long undertaken practices to arbitrarily consider theories to be accurate even if they failed many sets of tests. Feyerabend argued that a pluralistic methodology should be undertaken for the investigation of knowledge, and noted that many forms of knowledge which were previously thought to be \"non-scientific\" were later accepted as a valid part of the scientific canon.\n\nMany other theories of scientific change have been proposed over the years with various changes of emphasis and implications. In general, though, most float somewhere between these three models for change in scientific theory, the connection between theory and truth, and the nature of scientific progress.\n\nIndividual ideas and accomplishments are among the most famous aspects of science, both internally and in larger society. Breakthrough figures like Sir Isaac Newton or Albert Einstein are often celebrated as geniuses and heroes of science. Popularizers of science, including the news media and scientific biographers, contribute to this phenomenon. But many scientific historians emphasize the collective aspects of scientific discovery, and de-emphasize the importance of the \"Eureka!\" moment.\n\nA detailed look at the history of science often reveals that the minds of great thinkers were primed with the results of previous efforts, and often arrive on the scene to find a crisis of one kind or another. For example, Einstein did not consider the physics of motion and gravitation in isolation. His major accomplishments solved a problem which had come to a head in the field only in recent years — empirical data showing that the speed of light was inexplicably constant, no matter the apparent speed of the observer. (See Michelson-Morley experiment.) Without this information, it is very unlikely that Einstein would have conceived of anything like relativity.\n\nThe question of who should get credit for any given discovery is often a source of some controversy. There are many priority disputes, in which multiple individuals or teams have competing claims over who discovered something first. Multiple simultaneous discovery is actually a surprisingly common phenomenon, perhaps largely explained by the idea that previous contributions (including the emergence of contradictions between existing theories, or unexpected empirical results) make a certain concept ready for discovery. Simple priority disputes are often a matter of documenting when certain experiments were performed, or when certain ideas were first articulated to colleagues or recorded in a fixed medium.\n\nMany times the question of exactly which event should qualify as the moment of discovery is difficult to answer. One of the most famous examples of this is the question of the discovery of oxygen. While Carl Wilhelm Scheele and Joseph Priestley were able to concentrate oxygen in the laboratory and characterize its properties, they did not recognize it as a component of air. Priestly actually thought it was \"missing\" a hypothetical component of air, known as phlogiston, which air was supposed to absorb from materials that are being burned. It was only several years later that Antoine Lavoisier first conceived of the modern notion of oxygen — as a substance that is consumed from the air in the processes of burning and respiration.\n\nBy the late 20th Century, scientific research has become a large-scale effort, largely accomplished in institutional teams. The amount and frequency of inter-team collaboration has continued to increase, especially after the rise of the Internet, which is a central tool for the modern scientific community. This further complicates the notion of individual accomplishment in science.\n\n"}

{"id": "25754129", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25754129", "title": "Theory of forms", "text": "Theory of forms\n\nThe theory of Forms or theory of Ideas is a viewpoint attributed to Plato, which holds that non-physical (but substantial) forms (or ideas) represent the most accurate reality. When used in this sense, the word \"form\" or \"idea\" is often capitalized. Plato speaks of these entities only through the characters (primarily Socrates) of his dialogues who sometimes suggest that these Forms are the only objects of study that can provide knowledge. The theory itself is contested from within Plato's dialogues, and it is a general point of controversy in philosophy. Even whether the theory represents Plato's own views is held in doubt by modern scholarship. However, the theory is considered a classical solution to the problem of universals.\n\nThe early Greek concept of form precedes attested philosophical usage and is represented by a number of words mainly having to do with vision, sight, and appearance. \n\nThe meaning of the term (\"eidos\"), \"visible form\", and related terms μορφή (\"morphē\"), \"shape\", and φαινόμενα (\"phainomena\"), \"appearances\", from φαίνω (\"phainō\"), \"shine\", Indo-European \"\"*bʰeh₂-\"\" or \"*bhā-\" remained stable over the centuries until the beginning of philosophy, when they became equivocal, acquiring additional specialized philosophic meanings. The pre-Socratic philosophers, starting with Thales, noted that appearances change, and began to ask what the thing that changes \"really\" is. The answer was substance, which stands under the changes and is the actually existing thing being seen. The status of appearances now came into question. What is the form really and how is that related to substance?\n\nThus, the theory of matter and form (today's hylomorphism) was born. Starting with at least Plato and possibly germinal in some of the presocratics the forms were considered as being \"in\" something else, which Plato called nature (\"physis\"). The latter seemed as carved \"wood\", ὕλη (\"hyle\") in Greek, corresponding to \"materia\" in Latin, from which the English word \"matter\" is derived, shaped by receiving (or exchanging) forms.\n\nThe Forms are expounded upon in Plato's dialogues and general speech, in that every object or quality in reality has a form: dogs, human beings, mountains, colors, courage, love, and goodness. Form answers the question, \"What is that?\" Plato was going a step further and asking what Form itself is. He supposed that the object was essentially or \"really\" the Form and that the phenomena were mere shadows mimicking the Form; that is, momentary portrayals of the Form under different circumstances. The problem of universals – how can one thing in general be many things in particular – was solved by presuming that Form was a distinct singular thing but caused plural representations of itself in particular objects. For example, Parmenides states, \"Nor, again, if a person were to show that all is one by partaking of one, and at the same time many by partaking of many, would that be very astonishing. But if he were to show me that the absolute one was many, or the absolute many one, I should be truly amazed.\" Matter is considered particular in itself. For Plato, forms, such as beauty, are more real than any objects that imitate them. Though the forms are timeless and unchanging, physical things are in a constant change of existence. Where forms are unqualified perfection, physical things are qualified and conditioned.\n\nThese Forms are the essences of various objects: they are that without which a thing would not be the kind of thing it is. For example, there are countless tables in the world but the Form of tableness is at the core; it is the essence of all of them. Plato's Socrates held that the world of Forms is transcendent to our own world (the world of substances) and also is the essential basis of reality. Super-ordinate to matter, Forms are the most pure of all things. Furthermore, he believed that true knowledge/intelligence is the ability to grasp the world of Forms with one's mind.\n\nA Form is \"aspatial\" (transcendent to space) and \"atemporal\" (transcendent to time). Atemporal means that it does not exist within any time period, rather it provides the formal basis for time. It therefore formally grounds beginning, persisting and ending. It is neither eternal in the sense of existing forever, nor mortal, of limited duration. It exists transcendent to time altogether. Forms are aspatial in that they have no spatial dimensions, and thus no orientation in space, nor do they even (like the point) have a location. They are non-physical, but they are not in the mind. Forms are extra-mental (i.e. real in the strictest sense of the word).\n\nA Form is an objective \"blueprint\" of perfection. The Forms are perfect themselves because they are unchanging. For example, say we have a triangle drawn on a blackboard. A triangle is a polygon with 3 sides. The triangle as it is on the blackboard is far from perfect. However, it is only the intelligibility of the Form \"triangle\" that allows us to know the drawing on the chalkboard is a triangle, and the Form \"triangle\" is perfect and unchanging. It is exactly the same whenever anyone chooses to consider it; however, the time is that of the observer and not of the triangle.\n\nThe words, εἶδος (\"eidos\") and ἰδέα (\"idea\") come from the Indo-European root or \"*weid-\" \"see\" (cognate with Sanskrit \"vétti\"). \"Eidos\" (though not \"idea\") is already attested in texts of the Homeric era, the earliest Greek literature. This transliteration and the translation tradition of German and Latin lead to the expression \"theory of Ideas.\" The word is however not the English \"idea,\" which is a mental concept only.\n\nThe English word \"form\" may be used to translate two distinct concepts that concerned Plato—the outward \"form\" or appearance of something, and \"Form\" in a new, technical nature, that never...assumes a form like that of any of the things which enter into her; ... But the forms which enter into and go out of her are the likenesses of real existences modelled after their patterns in a wonderful and inexplicable manner... The objects that are seen, according to Plato, are not real, but literally \"mimic\" the real Forms. In the Allegory of the Cave expressed in \"Republic\", the things that are ordinarily perceived in the world are characterized as shadows of the real things, which are not perceived directly. That which the observer understands when he views the world mimics the archetypes of the many types and properties (that is, of universals) of things observed.\n\nPlato often invokes, particularly in his dialogues \"Phaedo\", \"Republic\" and \"Phaedrus\", poetic language to illustrate the mode in which the Forms are said to exist. Near the end of the \"Phaedo\", for example, Plato describes the world of Forms as a pristine region of the physical universe located above the surface of the Earth (\"Phd.\" 109a-111c). In the \"Phaedrus\" the Forms are in a \"place beyond heaven\" (\"huperouranios topos\") (\"Phdr.\" 247c ff); and in the \"Republic\" the sensible world is contrasted with the intelligible realm (\"noēton topon\") in the famous Allegory of the Cave.\n\nIt would be a mistake to take Plato's imagery as positing the intelligible world as a literal physical space apart from this one. Plato emphasizes that the Forms are not beings that extend in space (or time), but subsist apart from any physical space whatsoever. Thus we read in the \"Symposium\" of the Form of Beauty: \"It is not anywhere in another thing, as in an animal, or in earth, or in heaven, or in anything else, but itself by itself with itself,\" (211b). And in the \"Timaeus\" Plato writes: \"Since these things are so, we must agree that that which keeps its own form unchangingly, which has not been brought into being and is not destroyed, which neither receives into itself anything else from anywhere else, \"nor itself enters into anything anywhere\", is one thing,\" (52a, emphasis added).\n\nAccording to Plato, Socrates postulated a world of ideal Forms, which he admitted were impossible to know. Nevertheless, he formulated a very specific description of that world, which did not match his metaphysical principles. Corresponding to the world of Forms is our world, that of the shadows, an imitation of the real one. Just as shadows exist only because of the light of a fire, our world exists as, \"the offspring of the good\". Our world is modeled after the patterns of the Forms. The function of humans in our world is therefore to imitate the ideal world as much as possible which, importantly, includes imitating the good, i.e. acting morally.\n\nPlato lays out much of this theory in the \"Republic\" where, in an attempt to define Justice, he considers many topics including the constitution of the ideal state. While this state, and the Forms, do not exist on earth, because their imitations do, Plato says we are able to form certain well-founded opinions about them, through a theory called recollection.\n\nThe republic is a greater imitation of Justice:Our aim in founding the state was not the disproportional happiness of any one class, but the greatest happiness of the whole; we thought that in a state ordered with a view to the good of the whole we should be most likely to find justice.\n\nThe key to not know how such a state might come into existence is the word \"founding\" (\"oikidzomen\"), which is used of colonization. It was customary in such instances to receive a constitution from an elected or appointed lawgiver; however in Athens, lawgivers were appointed to reform the constitution from time to time (for example, Draco, Solon). In speaking of reform, Socrates uses the word \"purge\" (\"diakathairountes\") in the same sense that Forms exist purged of matter.\n\nThe purged society is a regulated one presided over by philosophers educated by the state, who maintain three non-hereditary classes as required: the tradesmen (including merchants and professionals), the guardians (militia and police) and the philosophers (legislators, administrators and the philosopher-king). Class is assigned at the end of education, when the state institutes individuals in their occupation. Socrates expects class to be hereditary but he allows for mobility according to natural ability. The criteria for selection by the academics is ability to perceive forms (the analog of English \"intelligence\") and martial spirit as well as predisposition or aptitude.\n\nThe views of Socrates on the proper order of society are certainly contrary to Athenian values of the time and must have produced a shock effect, intentional or not, accounting for the animosity against him. For example, reproduction is much too important to be left in the hands of untrained individuals: \"... the possession of women and the procreation of children ... will ... follow the general principle that friends have all things in common, ...\" The family is therefore to be abolished and the children – whatever their parentage – to be raised by the appointed mentors of the state.\n\nTheir genetic fitness is to be monitored by the physicians: \"... he (Asclepius, a culture hero) did not want to lengthen out good-for-nothing lives, or have weak fathers begetting weaker sons – if a man was not able to live in the ordinary way he had no business to cure him ...\" Physicians minister to the healthy rather than cure the sick: \"... (Physicians) will minister to better natures, giving health both of soul and of body; but those who are diseased in their bodies they will leave to die, and the corrupt and incurable souls they will put an end to themselves.\" Nothing at all in Greek medicine so far as can be known supports the airy (in the Athenian view) propositions of Socrates. Yet it is hard to be sure of Socrates' real views considering that there are no works written by Socrates himself. There are two common ideas pertaining to the beliefs and character of Socrates: the first being the Mouthpiece Theory where writers use Socrates in dialogue as a mouthpiece to get their own views across. However, since most of what we know about Socrates comes from plays, most of the Platonic plays are accepted as the more accurate Socrates since Plato was a direct student of Socrates.\n\nPerhaps the most important principle is that just as the Good must be supreme so must its image, the state, take precedence over individuals in everything. For example, guardians \"... will have to be watched at every age in order that we may see whether they preserve their resolution and never, under the influence either of force or enchantment, forget or cast off their sense of duty to the state.\" This concept of requiring guardians of guardians perhaps suffers from the Third Man weakness (see below): guardians require guardians require guardians, ad infinitum. The ultimate trusty guardian is missing. Socrates does not hesitate to face governmental issues many later governors have found formidable: \"Then if anyone at all is to have the privilege of lying, the rulers of the state should be the persons, and they ... may be allowed to lie for the public good.\"\n\nPlato's conception of Forms actually differs from dialogue to dialogue, and in certain respects it is never fully explained, so many aspects of the theory are open to interpretation. Forms are first introduced in the Phaedo, but in that dialogue the concept is simply referred to as something the participants are already familiar with, and the theory itself is not developed. Similarly, in the Republic, Plato relies on the concept of Forms as the basis of many of his arguments but feels no need to argue for the validity of the theory itself or to explain precisely what Forms are. Commentators have been left with the task of explaining what Forms are and how visible objects participate in them, and there has been no shortage of disagreement. Some scholars advance the view that Forms are paradigms, perfect examples on which the imperfect world is modeled. Others interpret Forms as universals, so that the Form of Beauty, for example, is that quality that all beautiful things share. Yet others interpret Forms as \"stuffs,\" the conglomeration of all instances of a quality in the visible world. Under this interpretation, we could say there is a little beauty in one person, a little beauty in another—all the beauty in the world put together is the Form of Beauty. Plato himself was aware of the ambiguities and inconsistencies in his Theory of Forms, as is evident from the incisive criticism he makes of his own theory in the Parmenides.\n\nPlato's main evidence for the existence of Forms is intuitive only and is as follows.\n\nWe call both the sky and blue jeans by the same color, blue. However, clearly a pair of jeans and the sky are not the same color; moreover, the wavelengths of light reflected by the sky at every location and all the millions of blue jeans in every state of fading constantly change, and yet we somehow have a consensus of the basic form Blueness as it applies to them. Says Plato:But if the very nature of knowledge changes, at the time when the change occurs there will be no knowledge, and, according to this view, there will be no one to know and nothing to be known: but if that which knows and that which is known exist ever, and the beautiful and the good and every other thing also exist, then I do not think that they can resemble a process of flux, as we were just now supposing.\n\nPlato believed that long before our bodies ever existed, our souls existed and inhabited heaven, where they became directly acquainted with the forms themselves. Real knowledge, to him, was knowledge of the forms. But knowledge of the forms cannot be gained through sensory experience because the forms are not in the physical world. Therefore, our real knowledge of the forms must be the memory of our initial acquaintance with the forms in heaven. Therefore, what we seem to learn is in fact just remembering.\n\nNo one has ever seen a perfect circle, nor a perfectly straight line, yet everyone knows what a circle and a straight line are. Plato utilizes the tool-maker's blueprint as evidence that Forms are real:... when a man has discovered the instrument which is naturally adapted to each work, he must express this natural form, and not others which he fancies, in the material ...\n\nPerceived circles or lines are not exactly circular or straight, and true circles and lines could never be detected since by definition they are sets of infinitely small points. But if the perfect ones were not real, how could they direct the manufacturer?\n\nPlato was well aware of the limitations of the theory, as he offered his own criticisms of it in his dialogue \"Parmenides\". There Socrates is portrayed as a young philosopher acting as junior counterfoil to aged Parmenides. To a certain extent it is tongue-in-cheek as the older Socrates will have solutions to some of the problems that are made to puzzle the younger.\n\nThe dialogue does present a very real difficulty with the Theory of Forms, which Plato most likely only viewed as problems for later thought. These criticisms were later emphasized by Aristotle in rejecting an independently existing world of Forms. It is worth noting that Aristotle was a pupil and then a junior colleague of Plato; it is entirely possible that the presentation of \"Parmenides\" \"sets up\" for Aristotle; that is, they agreed to disagree.\n\nOne difficulty lies in the conceptualization of the \"participation\" of an object in a form (or Form). The young Socrates conceives of his solution to the problem of the universals in another metaphor, which though wonderfully apt, remains to be elucidated:\nNay, but the idea may be like the day which is one and the same in many places at once, and yet continuous with itself; in this way each idea may be one and the same in all at the same time.\n\nBut exactly how is a Form like the day in being everywhere at once? The solution calls for a distinct form, in which the particular instances, which are not identical to the form, participate; i.e., the form is shared out somehow like the day to many places. The concept of \"participate\", represented in Greek by more than one word, is as obscure in Greek as it is in English. Plato hypothesized that distinctness meant existence as an independent being, thus opening himself to the famous third man argument of Parmenides, which proves that forms cannot independently exist and be participated.\n\nIf universal and particulars – say man or greatness – all exist and are the same then the Form is not one but is multiple. If they are only like each other then they contain a form that is the same and others that are different. Thus if we presume that the Form and a particular are alike then there must be another, or third Form, man or greatness by possession of which they are alike. An infinite regression would then result; that is, an endless series of third men. The ultimate participant, greatness, rendering the entire series great, is missing. Moreover, any Form is not unitary but is composed of infinite parts, none of which is the proper Form.\n\nThe young Socrates (some may say the young Plato) did not give up the Theory of Forms over the Third Man but took another tack, that the particulars do not exist as such. Whatever they are, they \"mime\" the Forms, appearing to be particulars. This is a clear dip into representationalism, that we cannot observe the objects as they are in themselves but only their representations. That view has the weakness that if only the mimes can be observed then the real Forms cannot be known at all and the observer can have no idea of what the representations are supposed to represent or that they are representations.\n\nSocrates' later answer would be that men already know the Forms because they were in the world of Forms before birth. The mimes only recall these Forms to memory. The comedian Aristophanes wrote a play, \"The Clouds\", poking fun of Socrates with his head in the clouds.\n\nThe topic of Aristotle's criticism of Plato's Theory of Forms is a large one and continues to expand. Rather than quote Plato, Aristotle often summarized. Classical commentaries thus recommended Aristotle as an introduction to Plato. As a historian of prior thought, Aristotle was invaluable, however this was secondary to his own dialectic and in some cases he treats purported implications as if Plato had actually mentioned them, or even defended them. In examining Aristotle's criticism of The Forms, it is helpful to understand Aristotle's own hylomorphic forms, by which he intends to salvage much of Plato's theory.\n\nIn the summary passage quoted above Plato distinguishes between real and non-real \"existing things\", where the latter term is used of substance. The figures that the artificer places in the gold are not substance, but gold is. Aristotle stated that, for Plato, all things studied by the sciences have Form and asserted that Plato considered only substance to have Form. Uncharitably, this leads him to something like a contradiction: Forms existing as the objects of science, but not-existing as non-substance. Scottish philosopher W.D. Ross objects to this as a mischaracterization of Plato.\n\nPlato did not claim to know where the line between Form and non-Form is to be drawn. As Cornford points out, those things about which the young Socrates (and Plato) asserted \"I have often been puzzled about these things\" (in reference to Man, Fire and Water), appear as Forms in later works. However, others do not, such as Hair, Mud, Dirt. Of these, Socrates is made to assert, \"it would be too absurd to suppose that they have a Form.\"\n\nRoss also objects to Aristotle's criticism that Form Otherness accounts for the differences between Forms and purportedly leads to contradictory forms: the Not-tall, the Not-beautiful, etc. That particulars participate in a Form is for Aristotle much too vague to permit analysis. By one way in which he unpacks the concept, the Forms would cease to be of one essence due to any multiple participation. As Ross indicates, Plato didn't make that leap from \"A is not B\" to \"A is Not-B.\" Otherness would only apply to its own particulars and not to those of other Forms. For example, there is no Form Not-Greek, only \"particulars\" of Form Otherness that somehow \"suppress\" Form Greek.\n\nRegardless of whether Socrates meant the particulars of Otherness yield Not-Greek, Not-tall, Not-beautiful, etc., the particulars would operate specifically rather than generally, each somehow yielding only one exclusion.\n\nPlato had postulated that we know Forms through a remembrance of the soul's past lives and Aristotle's arguments against this treatment of epistemology are compelling. For Plato, particulars somehow do not exist, and, on the face of it, \"that which is non-existent cannot be known\". See \"Metaphysics\" III 3–4.\n\nThe theory is presented in the following dialogues:\n\n\n\n"}

His aim was to discover how the inspired writers would have expressed and described the events of the New Testament had they been writing in nineteenth-century English. The translation was edited for publication by Hampden-Cook, also in 1903. It was published in 1903 by Baker & Taylor Company (New York) and James Clarke & Co (London).

{"id": "2343791", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343791", "title": "William of Saint-Amour", "text": "William of Saint-Amour\n\nWilliam of Saint-Amour was a minor figure in thirteenth-century scholasticism, chiefly notable for his withering attacks on the friars.\n\nWilliam was born in Saint-Amour, Jura, then part of the Duchy of Burgundy, in c. 1200. Under the patronage of the Count of Savoy, he was active at the University of Paris from the 1220s, becoming master of arts in 1228. From a reference in a letter by Gregory IX, it is evident that he had become a doctor of Canon law by 1238. By 1250 he had been made master of theology.\n\nThe controversy on which his fame rests began in earnest in the 1250s. The gradual encroachment of the newly formed mendicant orders into the university was the immediate cause of this. The secular clergy had previously enjoyed unrivalled teaching privileges at Paris, but the friars presented a serious challenge to their monopoly, gaining a number of prominent lecturing posts: the career of Bonaventure is indicative of the friars' rising stature in academia. The seculars bitterly resented this incursion, and engaged in a prolonged conflict with the friars. According to Matthew Paris' \"Chronica Majora\", this controversy brought the university to a point of near-collapse, 'exposed to danger, owing to the suspension of its lectures and disputations, and the dispersion of many of its scholars...owing to the insults and reproaches of the Preachers and Minors'. Particularly offensive was the friars' desire to increase the number of teaching positions, entirely against established custom. At length the dispute was brought before the papal curia. William had emerged as the mouthpiece of the secular party, and in 1254 he and five other masters directly petitioned Innocent IV. The pope proved sympathetic to their concerns: Innocent duly limited many of the friars' powers, and reduced the number of chairs they could legitimately occupy at the university. This victory, however, was short-lived. Innocent died in the December of the same year, and was replaced by Alexander IV. Alexander was cardinal protector of the Franciscans and therefore unlikely to side with the seculars: he promptly overturned the restrictions imposed by his predecessor, allowing the friars to be readmitted to Paris.\n\nHostilities resumed immediately, and William began to produce some of his most sustained and vitriolic sermons and treatises. As might be expected, his campaign against the regulars was not tolerated for long. In 1255 Pope Alexander ordered an inquiry into William's orthodoxy, resulting in his suspension from all teaching and administrative duties. In 1256 William produced \"De periculis novissimorum temporum\" (On the Dangers of the Final Days), a vicious tirade against the friars, and the culmination of his antifraternal thought. This ridiculed the more extreme eschatological speculations of some friars (e.g., Gerard da Burgo Santo Donnino, author of the \"Introductorius ad Evangelium Aeternum\"), who alleged that the fraternal orders would usher in the third and final age of the world, a glorious era of the Holy Spirit. \"De Periculis\" implied that the friars would indeed be instrumental in precipitating the end of the world, but only because they would facilitate the coming of the Antichrist. The treatise attracted written opposition from Thomas Aquinas and Albertus Magnus, both Dominican friars, and was examined by a curial committee. Thomas Aquinas wrote Contra Impugnantes to rebut William's charges. In 1257 Alexander ordered William's treatise to be burned: he also excommunicated William, and exiled him from France. Upon Alexander's death in 1266, William returned to Paris, although does not appear to have been reinstated at the university. He died at Burgundy in September 1272.\n\nWilliam's major work had an influence far beyond the compass of his own lifetime. It became the fountainhead of a long polemical tradition. Its most important section consists of thirty-nine 'signa' (or forty-one, in some versions) by which 'false Apostles' may be known. Although it is never openly stated, these 'signs' describe the behaviour of friars. The signs are, in order:\n\nWilliam decorates these imputations with various allusions to the Benedictine Rule, the Pauline epistles and Acts of the Apostles. The friars are variously likened to ravening wolves (\"lupi graves\"), stealers into people's homes (\"penetrantes domos\"), idlers and meddlers (\"otiosos et curiosos\"), aimless wanderers (\"gyrovaguos\") and, most recurrently, false preachers (\"pseudo-praedicatores\").\n\nIn Penn Szittya's phrase, this set of accusations and themes formed an enduring 'symbolic language', one that persisted among the friars' opponents for the next three centuries. In France, William's attacks were reiterated in the Parisian disputes of 1354, when two prominent bishops delivered diatribes against the friars; they also directly stimulated the satires of Rutebeuf and Jean de Meun. In Ireland, his arguments formed the backbone of Richard Fitzralph's \"Defensio Curatorum\", a much-copied and widely circulated sermon of 1350. In Scotland, Dunbar and Robert Henryson drew on William's motifs; in Germany, the Lutheran pamphleteers Johann Eberlin von Gunzburg and Heinrich Spelt made much use of his ideas. William's work proved especially influential in England, where one of his earliest supporters, a Master Laurence, appears to have been active. The work of Langland, John Gower and Chaucer directly echoes \"De Periculis\", while its key ideas were assimilated into Lollard ideology from Wyclif onwards (see especially Pierce the Ploughman's Crede). William's ideas even re-emerge in the Protestant writings of William Tyndale, John Bale and John Foxe, whose \"Actes and Monuments\" quotes \"De Periculis\" in its entirety. Although his own struggle against the friars ended in abject failure, William's legacy was thus extremely far-reaching. He powerfully stigmatised one of the dominant factions in the late medieval church, providing generations of critics with an arsenal of ready-made indictments.\n\nFor a Latin edition and English translation of the \"De Periculis\", see: William of Saint-Amour, \"De periculis novissimorum temporum\".
