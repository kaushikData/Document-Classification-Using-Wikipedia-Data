{"id": "9177077", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9177077", "title": "Abstraction principle (law)", "text": "Abstraction principle (law)\n\nThe abstract system of title transfer (German \"Abstraktionsprinzip\") is a legal term in German law relating to the law of obligations (\"Schuldrecht\") and property law (\"Eigentumsrecht\"). Although no express reference to it is made in the German Civil Code (BGB), the concept of separating a personal undertaking to pay or exchange goods or legal rights (e.g. through contract) from the conveyance of title to those goods or legal rights (e.g. through a deed or land registration) is fundamental to German private law (as well as Dutch law, South African law, and Common law).\n\nAbstract title transfer dominates the entire BGB and is vital for the understanding of how it treats legal transactions, such as contracts. For example, under the BGB's system, ownership is not transferred by a sale contract, as in some other jurisdictions (e.g. France, Spain, Italy, etc.). Instead, the sale contract merely obligates the seller to transfer ownership of the good sold to the buyer, while the buyer is obligated to pay the stipulated price. The buyer does not automatically gain ownership by virtue of the contract of sale whereas the seller has not automatically gained ownership of the money. Article 433 of the BGB explicitly states this obligation of the seller, as well as the buyer's obligation to pay the agreed upon price and take the thing he bought. So, seller and buyer have just made reciprocal undertakings and gained reciprocal obligations. For transfer of ownership, another contract is necessary which is governed by ss. 929 et seq. Thus, in a simple purchase of goods paid immediately in cash, German civil law interprets the transaction as (at least) three contracts: the contract of sale itself, obligating the seller to transfer ownership of the product to the buyer and the buyer to pay the price; a contract that transfers ownership of the product to the buyer, fulfilling the seller’s obligation; and a contract that transfers ownership of the money (bills and coins) from the buyer to the seller, fulfilling the buyer’s obligation.\n\nThis doesn't mean that contracts in Germany are more complicated to the people involved. Especially the contracts of everyday life don't differ from those in other countries in their outer appearance. For instance, if someone buys a newspaper at a newsstand without saying one single word to the seller, all the three abovementioned contracts are performed and can be construed to have been performed from the parties' behavior.\n\nAlthough abstract title transfer seemingly contradicts the usual common sense interpretation of commercial transactions, it is undisputed among the German legal community. The main advantage of the abstract system is its ability to provide a secure legal construction to nearly any financial transaction however complicated this transaction may be. A good example is retention of title. If someone buys something and pays the purchase price by installments, the system faces two conflicting interests: the buyer wants to have the purchased goods immediately, whereas the seller wants to secure full payment of the purchase price. Under abstract title transfer, the BGB has a simple answer to that: the purchase contract obligates the buyer to pay the full price and requires the seller to transfer property upon receipt of the last installment. Since the obligations and the actual conveyance of title are in two different contracts, it is quite simple to secure both parties' interests. The seller retains title up to the last payment, and the buyer is merely the holder of the purchased goods. If he fails to pay in full the seller may reclaim his property just like any other owner.\n\nCritics say that what German legal scholars call \"Verpflichtungsgeschäft\" and \"Verfügungsgeschäft\" (i.e. undertakings vs. conveyance) are actually the same thing, but expressed in other words. Stating that this difference turns the transaction into something more secure is a false inference. In fact, all other jurisdictions preserve the same certainty through other legal doctrines and devices in their civil codes, not necessarily demanding a double-analysis of the same matter and treating it like two different legal acts.\n\nThis is the main criticism of those jurisdictions that follow the opposite system, the causal system of title transfer (Germ: \"Kausalprinzip\" or \"Prinzip der kausalen Tradition\"), which follows the canon law maxim \"solo consensus obligat\", under which the meeting of the minds in a contract of sale is sufficient both to create obligations and convey title. This includes mainly jurisdictions that have adopted or been influenced by the Napoleonic Code, e.g. France, Louisiana, Quebec, Spain, Portugal, French-speaking Africa, much of Latin America, etc.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2197857", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2197857", "title": "Acosmism", "text": "Acosmism\n\nAcosmism, in contrast to pantheism, denies the reality of the universe, seeing it as ultimately illusory, (the prefix \"a-\" in Greek meaning negation; like \"un-\" in English), and only the infinite unmanifest Absolute as real. Conceptual versions of Acosmism are found in eastern and western philosophies.\n\nThe concept of Maya in the non-dual Advaita Vedanta school of Hinduism is a form of acosmism. Maya means \"illusion, appearances\". The universe is considered to be Māyā, however this does not mean universe is considered as unreal. Wendy Doniger explains, \"to say that the universe is an illusion (māyā) is not to say that it is unreal; it is to say, instead, that it is not what it seems to be, that it is something constantly being made. Māyā not only deceives people about the things they think they know; more basically, it limits their knowledge to things that are epistemologically and ontologically second-rate.\"\n\nIn the Vedanta school of Hinduism, the perceived world is Maya that hides the Absolute and Ultimate Reality (Brahman). The human mind constructs a subjective experience, states Vedanta, which leads to the peril of misunderstanding Maya as well as interpreting Maya as the only and final reality. Vedantins assert the \"perceived world including people are not what they appear to be, there is more to them than their perceived physical forms\". Māyā is that which manifests, perpetuates a sense of false duality (or divisional plurality). This manifestation is real, but it obfuscates and eludes the hidden principles and true nature of reality. Vedanta holds that liberation is the unfettered realization and understanding of these invisible principles, primarily that the individual Self (Soul) is the same as the Self in others and the Self in everything (Brahman).\n\nAdvaita Vedanta school is best described as monistic, absolute idealism, while Dvaita Vedanta school as pluralistic idealism. Both have elements of ontological acosmism, where the material aspect of cosmos is considered an \"illusion, appearance, incomplete reality\" compared to that \"which is spiritual, eternal, unchanging\". In Advaita Vedanta philosophy, there are two realities: \"Vyavaharika\" (empirical reality) and \"Paramarthika\" (absolute, spiritual reality). Māyā is a fact in that it is the appearance of phenomena. Brahman (Ultimate Reality, Absolute, Cosmic Soul) is held by Advaitins as the metaphysical truth. The perceived world, Māyā is true in epistemological and empirical sense; however, Māyā is not considered by Vedantins as the metaphysical and spiritual truth. The spiritual truth is the truth forever, while what is empirical truth is only true for now. Since Māyā is the perceived material world, it is true in perception context, but is \"untrue\" in spiritual context of Brahman. True Reality, to Advaita scholars, includes both \"Vyavaharika\" (empirical) and \"Paramarthika\" (spiritual), the Māyā and the Brahman. The goal of spiritual enlightenment, state Advaitins, is to realize one's soul as same as Cosmic Soul (Brahman), realize the eternal, fearless, resplendent Oneness.\n\nAdvaita Hinduism and Buddhism have both been called as examples of acosmism. Other scholars state Buddhism cannot be accurately classified as a philosophy based on acosmism, and that Advaita Vedanta is not acosmism either.\n\nAcosmism has been seen in the work of a number of Western philosophers, including Parmenides, Plato, Spinoza, Kant, Hegel, Schopenhauer, and British and American idealists, such as F.H. Bradley. The word acosmism is often traced to Hegel who used it in his discussion of the philosophy of religion, in particular his understanding of pantheism and refutation of the charge that Spinoza was an atheist. Hegel explains that for Spinoza it is the infinite 'substance' which is real, while the finite world doesn't exist. \"But the accusers of Spinozism are unable to liberate themselves from the finite; hence they declare for Spinozism everything is God, because it is precisely the aggregate of finitudes (the world) that has there disappeared. If one employs the expression \"All is One\" and [claims] therefore that unity is the truth of multiplicity, then the \"all\" simply is no longer. The multiplicity vanishes, for it has its truth in the unity.\" W.T. Stace sees all philosophical acosmism as rooted in the mystical experience, whether or not the authors are aware of this. Stace points out that most Western philosophers tend to a form of qualified acosmism, where the world is less real rather than utterly illusory. He sees two mystical sources of acosmism from within the eternal moment, firstly the mystical moment contains all eternity and infinity and thus there is nothing outside it, and secondly because the eternal moment is experienced as the supreme value.\n\n"}

{"id": "66975", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66975", "title": "Apophatic theology", "text": "Apophatic theology\n\nApophatic theology, also known as negative theology, is a form of theological thinking and religious practice which attempts to approach God, the Divine, by negation, to speak only in terms of what may not be said about the perfect goodness that is God. It forms a pair together with cataphatic theology, which approaches God or the Divine by affirmations or positive statements about what God \"is\".\n\nThe apophatic tradition is often, though not always, allied with the approach of mysticism, which aims at the vision of God, the perception of the divine reality beyond the realm of ordinary perception.\n\n\"Apophatic\", (adjective); from ἀπόφημι \"apophēmi\", meaning \"to deny\". From \"Online Etymology Dictionary\": \n\"Via negativa\" or \"via negationis\" (Latin), \"negative way\" or \"by way of denial\". The negative way forms a pair together with the \"kataphatic\" or positive way. According to Deirdre Carabine,\nAccording to Fagenblat, \"negative theology is as old as philosophy itself;\" elements of it can be found in Plato's \"unwritten doctrines,\" while it is also present in Neo-Platonic, Gnostic and early Christian writers. A tendency to apophatic thought can also be found in Philo of Alexandria.\n\nAccording to Carabine, \"apophasis proper\" in Greek thought starts with Neo-Platonism, with its speculations about the nature of the One, culminating in the works of Proclus. According to Carabine, there are two major points in the development of apophatic theology, namely the fusion of the Jewish tradition with Platonic philosophy in the writings of Philo, and the works of Dionysius the Pseudo-Areopagite, who infused Christian thought with Neo-Platonic ideas.\n\nThe Early Church Fathers were influenced by Philo, and Meredith even states that Philo \"is the real founder of the apophatic tradition.\" Yet, it was with Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite and Maximus the Confessor, whose writings shaped both Hesychasm, the contemplative tradition of the Eastern Orthodox Churches, and the mystical traditions of western Europe, that apophatic theology became a central element of Christian theology and contemplative practice.\n\nFor the ancient Greeks, knowledge of the gods was essential for proper worship. Poets had an important responsibility in this regard, and a central question was how knowledge of the Divine forms can be attained. Epiphany played an essential role in attaining this knowledge. Xenophanes (c. 570 – c. 475 BC) noted that the knowledge of the Divine forms is restrained by the human imagination, and Greek philosophers realized that this knowledge can only be mediated through myth and visual representations, which are culture-dependent.\n\nAccording to Herodotus (484–425 BCE), Homer and Hesiod (between 750 and 650 BC) taught the Greek the knowledge of the Divine bodies of the Gods. The ancient Greek poet Hesiod (between 750 and 650 BC) describes in his \"Theogony\" the birth of the gods and creation of the world, which became an \"ur-text for programmatic, first-person epiphanic narratives in Greek literature,\" but also \"explores the necessary limitations placed on human access to the divine.\" According to Platt, the statement of the Muses who grant Hesiod knowledge of the Gods \"actually accords better with the logic of apophatic religious thought.\"\n\nParmenides (fl. late sixth or early fifth century BC), in his poem \"On Nature\", gives an account of a revelation on two ways of inquiry. \"The way of conviction\" explores Being, true reality (\"what-is\"), which is \"What is ungenerated and deathless,/whole and uniform, and still and perfect.\" \"The way of opinion\" is the world of appearances, in which one's sensory faculties lead to conceptions which are false and deceitful. His distinction between unchanging Truth and shifting opinion is reflected in Plato's allegory of the Cave. Together with the Biblical story of Moses's ascent of Mount Sinai, it is used by Gregory of Nyssa and Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite to give a Christian account of the ascent of the soul toward God. Cook notes that Parmenides poem is a religious account of a mystical journey, akin to the mystery cults, giving a philosophical form to a religious outlook. Cook further notes that the philosopher's task is to \"attempt through 'negative' thinking to tear themselves loose from all that frustrates their pursuit of wisdom.\"\n\nPlato (428/427 or 424/423 – 348/347 BCE), \"deciding for Parmenides against Heraclitus\" and his theory of eternal change, had a strong influence on the development of apophatic thought.\n\nPlato further explored Parmenides's idea of timeless truth in his dialogue \"Parmenides\", which is a treatment of the eternal forms, \"Truth, Beauty and Goodness\", which are the real aims for knowledge. The Theory of Forms is Plato's answer to the problem \"how one unchanging reality or essential being can admit of many changing phenomena (and not just by dismissing them as being mere illusion).\"\n\nIn \"The Republic\", Plato argues that the \"real objects of knowledge are not the changing objects of the senses, but the immutable Forms,\" stating that the \"Form of the Good\" is the highest object of knowledge. His argument culminates in the Allegory of the Cave, in which he argues that humans are like prisoners in a cave, who can only see shadows of the Real, the \"Form of the Good\". Humans are to be educated to search for knowledge, by turning away from their bodily desires toward higher contemplation, culminating in an intellectual understanding or apprehension of the Forms, c.q. the \"first principles of all knowledge.\"\n\nAccording to Cook, the \"Theory of Forms\" has a theological flavour, and had a strong influence on the ideas of his Neo-Platonist interpreters Proclus and Plotinus. The pursuit of \"Truth, Beauty and Goodness\" became a central element in the apophatic tradition, but nevertheless, according to Carabine \"Plato himself cannot be regarded as the founder of the negative way.\" Carabine warns not to read later Neo-Platonic and Christian understandings into Plato, and notes that Plato did not identify his Forms with \"one transcendent source,\" an identification which his later interpreters made.\n\nMiddle Platonism (1st century BCE - 3rd century CE) further investigated Plato's \"Unwritten Doctrines,\" which drew on Pythagoras' first principles of the Monad and the Dyad (matter). Middle Platonism proposed a hierarchy of being, with God as its first principle at its top, identifying it with Plato's \"Form of the Good\". An influential proponent of Middle Platonism was Philo (c.25 BCE–c. 50 CE), who employed Middle Platonic philosophy in his interpretation of the Hebrew scriptures, and asserted a strong influence on early Christianity. According to Craig D. Allert, \"Philo made a monumental contribution to the creation of a vocabulary for use in negative statements about God.\" For Philo, God is undescribable, and he uses terms which emphasize God's transcendence.\n\nNeo-Platonism was a mystical or contemplative form of Platonism, which \"developed outside the mainstream of Academic Platonism.\" It started with the writings of Plotinus (204/5–270), and ended with the closing of the Platonic Academy by Emperor Justinian in 529 CE, when the pagan traditions were ousted. It is a product of Hellenistic syncretism, which developed due to the crossover between Greek thought and the Jewish scriptures, and also gave birth to Gnosticism. Proclus was the last head of the Platonic Academy; his student Pseudo-Dinosysius had a far-stretching Neo-Platonic influence on Christianity and Christian mysticism.\n\nPlotinus (204/5–270) was the founder of Neo-Platonism. In the Neo-Platonic philosophy of Plotinus and Proclus, the first principle became even more elevated as a radical unity, which was presented as an unknowable Absolute. For Plotinus, \"the One\" is the first principle, from which everything else emanates. He took it from Plato's writings, identifying the Good of the \"Republic\", as the cause of the other Forms, with \"the One\" of the first hypothesis of the second part of the \"Parmenides\". For Plotinus, \"the One\" precedes the Forms, and \"is beyond Mind and indeed beyond Being.\" From \"the One\" comes the Intellect, which contains all the Forms. \"The One\" is the principle of Being, while the Forms are the principle of the essence of beings, and the intelligibility which can recognize them as such. Plotinus's third principle is Soul, the desire for objects external to the person. The highest satisfaction of desire is the contemplation of \"the One\", which unites all existents \"as a single, all-pervasive reality.\"\n\n\"The One\" is radically simple, and does not even have self-knowledge, since self-knowledge would imply multiplicity. Nevertheless, Plotinus does urge for a search for the Absolute, turning inward and becoming aware of the \"presence of the intellect in the human soul,\" initiating an ascent of the soul by abstraction or \"taking away,\" culminating in a sudden appearance of \"the One\". In the \"Enneads\" Plotinus writes: \nCarabine notes that Plotinus' apophasis is not just a mental exercise, an acknowledgement of the unknowability of \"the One\", but a means to \"extasis\" and an ascent to \"the unapproachable light that is God.\" Pao-Shen Ho, investigating what are Plotinus' methods for reaching \"henosis\", concludes that \"Plotinus' mystical teaching is made up of two practices only, namely philosophy and negative theology.\" According to Moore, Plotinus appeals to the \"non-discursive, intuitive faculty of the soul,\" by \"calling for a sort of prayer, an invocation of the deity, that will permit the soul to lift itself up to the unmediated, direct, and intimate contemplation of that which exceeds it (V.1.6).\" Pao-Shen Ho further notes that \"for Plotinus, mystical experience is irreducible to philosophical arguments.\" The argumentation about \"henosis\" is preceded by the actual experience of it, and can only be understood when \"henosis\" has been attained. Ho further notes that Plotinus's writings have a didactic flavour, aiming to \"bring his own soul and \"the souls of others\" by way of Intellect to union with the One.\" As such, the \"Enneads\" as a spiritual or ascetic teaching device, akin to \"The Cloud of Unknowing\", demonstrating the methods of philosophical and apophatic inquiry. Ultimately, this leads to silence and the abandonment of all intellectual inquiry, leaving contemplation and unity.\n\nProclus (412-485) introduced the terminology which is being used in apophatic and cataphatic theology. He did this in the second book of his \"Platonic Theology\", arguing that Plato states that \"the One\" can be revealed \"through analogy,\" and that \"through negations [\"dia ton apophaseon\"] its transcendence over everything can be shown.\" For Proclus, apophatic and cataphonic theology form a contemplatory pair, with the apophatic approach corresponding to the manifestation of the world from \"the One\", and cataphonic theology corresponding to the return to \"the One\". The analogies are affirmations which direct us toward \"the One\", while the negations underlie the confirmations, being closer to \"the One\". According to Luz, Proclus also attracted students from other faiths, including the Samaritan Marinus. Luz notes that \"Marinus' Samaritan origins with its Abrahamic notion of a single ineffable Name of God () should also have been in many ways compatible with the school's ineffable and apophatic divine principle.\"\nThe Book of Revelation 8:1 mentions \"the silence of the perpetual choir in heaven.\" According to Dan Merkur,\nThe Early Church Fathers were influenced by Philo (c. 25 BCE – c. 50 CE), who saw Moses as \"the model of human virtue and Sinai as the archetype of man's ascent into the \"luminous darkness\" of God.\" His interpretation of Moses was followed by Clement of Alexandria, Origen, the Cappadocian Fathers, Pseudo-Dionysius, and Maximus the Confessor.\n\nGod's appearance to Moses in the burning bush was often elaborated on by the Early Church Fathers, especially Gregory of Nyssa (c. 335 – c. 395), realizing the fundamental unknowability of God; an exegesis which continued in the medieval mystical tradition. Their response is that, although God is unknowable, Jesus as person can be followed, since \"following Christ is the human way of seeing God.\"\n\nClement of Alexandria (c. 150 – c. 215) was an early proponent of apophatic theology. According to R.A. Baker, in Clement's writings the term \"theoria\" develops further from a mere intellectual \"seeing\" toward a spirutal form of contemplation. Clement's apophatic theology or philosophy is closely related to this kind of \"theoria\" and the \"mystic vision of the soul.\" For Clement, God is transcendent and immanent. According to Baker, Clement's apophaticism is mainly driven by Biblical texts, but by the Platonic tradition. His conception of an ineffable God is a synthesis of Plato and Philo, as seen from a Biblical perspective. According to Osborne, it is a synthesis in a Biblical framework; according to Baker, while the Platonic tradition accounts for the negative approach, the Biblical tradition accounts for the positive approach. \"Theoria\" and abstraction is the means to conceive of this ineffable God; it is preceded by dispassion.\n\nAccording to Tertullian (c. 155 – c. 240),\nSaint Cyril of Jerusalem (313-386), in his \"Catechetical Homilies\", states: \nAugustine of Hippo (354-430) defined God \"aliud, aliud valde\", meaning \"other, completely other\", in \"Confessions\" 7.10.16.\n\nApophatic theology found its most influential expression in the works of Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite (late 5th to early 6th century), a student of Proclus (412-485), combining a Christian worldview with Neo-Platonic ideas. He is a constant factor in the contemplative tradition of the eastern Orthodox Churches, and from the 9th century onwards his writings also had a strong impact on western mysticism.\n\nDionysius the Areopagite was a pseudonym, taken from Acts of the Apostles chapter 17, in which Paul gives a missionary speech to the court of the Areopagus in Athens. In Paul makes a reference to an altar-inscription, dedicated to the Unknown God, \"a safety measure honoring foreign gods still unknown to the Hellenistic world.\" For Paul, Jesus Christ is this unknown God, and as a result of Paul's speech Dionysius the Areopagite converts to Christianity. Yet, according to Stang, for Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite Athens is also the place of Neo-Platonic wisdom, and the term \"unknown God\" is a reversal of Paul's preaching toward an integration of Christianity with Neo-Platonism, and the union with the \"unknown God.\"\n\nAccording to Corrigan and Harrington, \"Dionysius' central concern is how a triune God, ... who is utterly unknowable, unrestricted being, beyond individual substances, beyond even goodness, can become manifest to, in, and through the whole of creation in order to bring back all things to the hidden darkness of their source.\" Drawing on Neo-Platonism, Pseudo-Dionysius described humans ascend to divinity as a process of purgation, illumination and union. Another Neo-Platonic influence was his description of the cosmos as a series of hierarchies, which overcome the distance between God and humans.\n\nIn Orthodox Christianity apophatic theology is taught as superior to cataphatic theology. The fourth-century Cappadocian Fathers stated a belief in the existence of God, but an existence unlike that of everything else: everything else that exists was created, but the Creator transcends this existence, is uncreated. The essence of God is completely unknowable; mankind can know God only through His energies. Gregory of Nyssa (c.335-c.395), John Chrysostom (c. 349 – 407), and Basil the Great (329-379) emphasized the importance of negative theology to an orthodox understanding of God. John of Damascus (c.675/676–749) employed negative theology when he wrote that positive statements about God reveal \"not the nature, but the things around the nature.\"\n\nMaximus the Confessor (580-622) took over Pseudo-Dionysius' ideas, and had a strong influence on the theology and contemplative practices of the Eastern Orthodox Churches. Gregory Palamas (1296–1359) formulated the definite theology of Hesychasm, the Orthodox practices of contemplative prayer and theosis, \"deification.\"\n\nInfluential modern Eastern Orthodox theologians are Vladimir Lossky, John Meyendorff, John S. Romanides and Georges Florovsky. Lossky argues, based on his reading of Dionysius and Maximus Confessor, that positive theology is always inferior to negative theology which is a step along the way to the superior knowledge attained by negation. This is expressed in the idea that mysticism is the expression of dogmatic theology \"par excellence\".\n\nAccording to Lossky, outside of directly revealed knowledge through Scripture and Sacred Tradition, such as the Trinitarian nature of God, God in His essence is beyond the limits of what human beings (or even angels) can understand. He is transcendent in essence (\"ousia\"). Further knowledge must be sought in a direct experience of God or His indestructible energies through \"theoria\" (vision of God). According to Aristotle Papanikolaou, in Eastern Christianity, God is immanent in his hypostasis or existences.\n\nNegative theology has a place in the Western Christian tradition as well. The 9th-century theologian John Scotus Erigena wrote: \n\nWhen he says \"\"He is not anything\" and \"God is not\"\", Scotus does not mean that there is no God, but that God cannot be said to exist in the way that creation exists, i.e. that God is uncreated. He is using apophatic language to emphasise that God is \"other\".\n\nTheologians like Meister Eckhart and Saint John of the Cross (San Juan de la Cruz) exemplify some aspects of or tendencies towards the apophatic tradition in the West. The medieval work, \"The Cloud of Unknowing\" and Saint John's \"Dark Night of the Soul\" are particularly well known. In 1215 apophatism became the official position of the Catholic Church, which, on the basis of Scripture and church tradition, during the Fourth Lateran Council formulated the following dogma:\nThomas Aquinas was born ten years later (1225-1274) and, although in his \"Summa Theologica\" he quotes Pseudo-Dionysius 1,760 times, his reading in a neo-Aristotelian key of the conciliar declaration overthrew its meaning inaugurating the \"analogical way\" as \"tertium\" between \"via negativa\" and \"via positiva\": the \"via eminentiae\" (see also \"analogia entis\"). According to Adrian Langdon,\nAccording to \"Catholic Encyclopedia\", the \"Doctor Angelicus\" and the scholastici declare [that] \nSince then Thomism has played a decisive role in resizing the negative or apophatic tradition of the magisterium.\n\nApophatic statements are still crucial to many modern theologians, restarting in 1800s by Søren Kierkegaard (see his concept of the infinite qualitative distinction) up to Rudolf Otto and Karl Barth (see their idea of \"Wholly Other\", i.e. \"ganz Andere\" or \"totaliter aliter\").\n\nC. S. Lewis, in his book \"Miracles\" (1947), advocates the use of negative theology when first thinking about God, in order to cleanse our minds of misconceptions. He goes on to say we must then refill our minds with the truth about God, untainted by mythology, bad analogies or false mind-pictures.\n\nThe mid-20th century Dutch philosopher Herman Dooyeweerd, who is often associated with a neo-Calvinistic tradition, provides a philosophical foundation for understanding why we can never absolutely know God, and yet, paradoxically, truly know something of God. Dooyeweerd made a sharp distinction between theoretical and pre-theoretical attitudes of thought. Most of the discussion of knowledge of God presupposes theoretical knowledge, in which we reflect and try to define and discuss. Theoretical knowing, by its very nature, is never absolute, always depends on religious presuppositions, and cannot grasp either God or the law side. Pre-theoretical knowing, on the other hand, is intimate engagement, and exhibits a diverse range of aspects. Pre-theoretical intuition, on the other hand, can grasp at least the law side. Knowledge of God, as God wishes to reveal it, is pre-theoretical, immediate and intuitive, never theoretical in nature. The philosopher Leo Strauss considered that the Bible, for example, should be treated as pre-theoretical (everyday) rather than theoretical in what it contains.\n\nIvan Illich (1926-2002), the historian and social critic, can be read as an apophatic theologian, according to a longtime collaborator, Lee Hoinacki, in a paper presented in memory of Illich, called \"Why Philia?\"\n\nAccording to Deirdre Carabine, negative theology has become a hot topic since the 1990s, resulting from a broad effort in the 19 and 20th century to portray Plato as a mysticist, which revived the interest in Neoplatonism and negative theology.\n\nKaren Armstrong, in her book \"The Case for God\" (2009), notices a recovery of apophatic theology in postmodern theology.\n\nThe Arabic term for \"negative theology\" is \"lahoot salbi\", which is a \"system of theology\" or \"nizaam al lahoot\" in Arabic. Different traditions/doctrine schools in Islam called Kalam schools (see Islamic schools and branches) use different theological approaches or \"nizaam al lahoot\" in approaching God in Islam (\"Allah\", Arabic الله) or the ultimate reality. The \"lahoot salbi\" or \"negative theology\" involves the use of \"ta'til\", which means \"negation,\" and the followers of the Mu'tazili school of Kalam, founded by Imam Wasil ibn Ata, are often called the \"Mu'attili\", because they are frequent users of the \"ta'tili\" methodology.\n\nRajab ʿAlī Tabrīzī, an Iranian and Shiat philosopher and mystic of the 17th century. instilled a radical apophatic theology in a generation of philosophers and theologians whose influence extended into the Qajar period. Mulla Rajab affirmed the completely unknowable,\nunqualifiable, and attributeless nature of God and upheld a general view concerning God’s attributes which can only be negatively ‘affirmed’, by means of the via\nnegativa.\n\nShia Islam adopted \"negative theology\". In the words of the Persian Ismaili missionary, Abu Yaqub al-Sijistani: \"There does not exist a tanzíh [\"transcendence\"] more brilliant and more splendid than that by which we establish the absolute transcendence of our Originator through the use of these phrases in which a negative and a negative of a negative apply to the thing denied.\" Early Sunni scholars who held to a literal reading of the Quran and hadith rejected this view, adhering to its opposite, believing that the Attributes of God such as \"Hand\", \"Foot\" etc... should be taken literally and that, therefore, God is like a human being. Today, most Sunnis, like the Ash'ari and Maturidi, adhere to a middle path between negation and anthropomorphism.\n\nMaimonides (1135/1138-1204) was \"the most influential medieval Jewish exponent of the \"via negativa\".\" Maimonides, but also Samuel ibn Tibbon, draw on Bahya ibn Paquda, who shows that our inability to describe God is related to the fact of His absolute unity. God, as the entity which is \"truly One\" (האחד האמת), must be free of properties and is thus unlike anything else and indescribable. According to Rabbi Yosef Wineberg, Maimonides stated that \"[God] is knowledge,\" and saw His Essence, Being and knowledge as completely one, \"a perfect unity and not a composite at all.\" Wineberg quotes Maimonides as stating\nIn \"The Guide for the Perplexed\" Maimonides stated:\nAccording to Fagenblat, it is only in the modern period that negative theology really gains importance in Jewish thought. Yeshayahu Leibowitz (1903-1994) was a prominent modern exponent of Jewish negative theology. According to Leibowitz, a person's faith is his commitment to obey God, meaning God's commandments, and this has nothing to do with a person’s image of God. This must be so because Leibowitz thought that God cannot be described, that God's understanding is not man's understanding, and thus all the questions asked of God are out of place.\n\nThere are interesting parallels in Indian thought, which developed largely separate from Western thought. Early Indian philosophical works which have apophatic themes include the Principal Upanishads (800 BCE to the start of common era) and the Brahma Sutras (from 450 BCE and 200 CE). An expression of negative theology is found in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, where Brahman is described as \"neti neti\" or \"neither this, nor that\". Further use of apophatic theology is found in the Brahma Sutras, which state:\n\nBuddhist philosophy has also strongly advocated the way of negation, beginning with the Buddha's own theory of anatta (not-atman, not-self) which denies any truly existent and unchanging essence of a person. Madhyamaka is a Buddhist philosophical school founded by Nagarjuna (2nd-3rd century CE), which is based on a fourfold negation of all assertions and concepts and promotes the theory of emptiness (shunyata). Apophatic assertions are also an important feature of Mahayana sutras, especially the prajñaparamita genre. These currents of negative theology are visible in all forms of Buddhism.\n\nApophatic movements in medieval Hindu philosophy are visible in the works of Shankara (8th century), a philosopher of Advaita Vedanta (non-dualism), and Bhartṛhari (5th century), a grammarian. While Shankara holds that the transcendent noumenon, Brahman, is realized by the means of negation of every phenomenon including language, Bhartṛhari theorizes that language has both phenomenal and noumenal dimensions, the latter of which manifests Brahman.\n\nIn Advaita, Brahman is defined as being Nirguna or without qualities. Anything imaginable or conceivable is not deemed to be the ultimate reality. The Taittiriya hymn speaks of Brahman as \"one where the mind does not reach\". Yet the Hindu scriptures often speak of Brahman's positive aspect. For instance, Brahman is often equated with bliss. These contradictory descriptions of Brahman are used to show that the attributes of Brahman are similar to ones experienced by mortals, but not the same. \n\nNegative theology also figures in the Buddhist and Hindu polemics. The arguments go something like this – Is Brahman an object of experience? If so, how do you convey this experience to others who have not had a similar experience? The only way possible is to relate this unique experience to common experiences while explicitly negating their sameness.\n\nEven though the \"via negativa\" essentially rejects theological understanding in and of itself as a path to God, some have sought to make it into an intellectual exercise, by describing God only in terms of what God is not. One problem noted with this approach is that there seems to be no fixed basis on deciding what God is not, unless the Divine is understood as an abstract experience of full aliveness unique to each individual consciousness, and universally, the perfect goodness applicable to the whole field of reality. Apophatic theology is often accused of being a version of atheism or agnosticism, since it cannot say truly that God exists. \"The comparison is crude, however, for conventional atheism treats the existence of God as a predicate that can be denied (“God is nonexistent”), whereas negative theology denies that God has predicates\". \"God or the Divine is\" without being able to attribute qualities about \"what He is\" would be the prerequisite of positive theology in negative theology that distinguishes theism from atheism. \"Negative theology is a complement to, not the enemy of, positive theology\". Since religious experience—or consciousness of the holy or sacred, is not reducible to other kinds of human experience, an abstract understanding of religious experience cannot be used as evidence or proof that religious discourse or praxis can have no meaning or value. In apophatic theology, the negation of theisms in the \"via negativa\" also requires the negation of their correlative atheisms if the dialectical method it employs is to maintain integrity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n"}

He had an elder brother (Cory), an elder sister (Lorna, Mrs Acton), and a younger sister (Dorothy, Mrs Hony). His father was a civil engineer who built his fortune in the family coal mines in Wiltshire in England and Merthyr Tydfil in Wales – \"a family which drew its wealth from Welsh mines and expended it on the destruction of wild animals\". They lived at Cleeve House, Seend, near Devizes, Wiltshire, which was adorned with Squire Bell's many hunting trophies.\n\nHe was educated at the public school Marlborough College and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied history. In 1902 he received an Earl of Derby scholarship to study in Paris, where his interest in art originated. Upon his return to England, he moved to London, where he met and married artist Vanessa Stephen, sister of Virginia Woolf, early in 1907. Clive and Vanessa had two sons, Julian and Quentin, who both became writers. Julian joined the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War as an ambulance driver and was killed in 1937 by an enemy shell, aged 29.\n\nBy World War I their marriage was over. Vanessa had begun a lifelong relationship with Duncan Grant, and Clive had a number of liaisons with other women including Mary Hutchinson. However, Clive and Vanessa never officially separated or divorced. Not only did they visit each other regularly, they also sometimes spent holidays together and paid \"family\" visits to Clive's parents. Clive lived in London but often spent long stretches of time at the farmhouse of Charleston, Sussex, where Vanessa lived with Duncan and her three children by Clive and Duncan. He fully supported her wish to have a child by Duncan and allowed his wife's only daughter, Angelica, to bear his surname.\n\nVanessa's daughter by Duncan, Angelica Garnett (née Bell), was raised as Clive's daughter until she married. She was informed, by her mother Vanessa, just prior to her marriage and shortly after her brother Julian's death, that Duncan Grant was her biological father.\nAccording to historian Stanley Rosenbaum, \"Bell may, indeed, be the least liked member of Bloomsbury... Bell has been found wanting by biographers and critics of the Group – as a husband, a father, and especially a brother-in-law. It is undeniable that he was a wealthy snob, hedonist, and womaniser, a racist and an anti-Semite (but not a homophobe), who changed from a liberal socialist and pacifist into a reactionary appeaser. Bell's reputation has led to his being underestimated in the history of Bloomsbury...\"\n\nSoon after Bell met Roger Fry, he developed his art theory called \"significant form\". The two shared a passion for contemporary French art. Bell's book \"Art\" (1914) was the first publication of his theory, which he describes as \"lines and colours combined in a particular way, certain forms, and relations of forms, that stir our aesthetic emotions.\" This form can be seen in art created by many members of the Bloomsbury Group, an example being \"Interior at Gordon Square\" by Duncan Grant.\n\nBell was at one point an adherent of absolute pacifism, and during the First World War was a conscientious objector, allowed to perform Work of National Importance by assisting on the farm of Philip Morrell MP, at Garsington Manor. In his 1938 pamphlet \"War Mongers\", he opposed any attempt by Britain to use military force, arguing \"the worst tyranny is better than the best war.\" However, by 1940 Bell was a supporter of the British war effort, calling for a \"ceaseless war against Hitler\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "936112", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=936112", "title": "Drama therapy", "text": "Drama therapy\n\nDrama therapy (written \"dramatherapy\" in the UK, Europe, Australia, and Africa) is the use of theatre techniques to facilitate personal growth and promote mental health. Drama therapy is used in a wide variety of settings, including hospitals, schools, mental health centers, prisons, and businesses. Drama therapy, as a modality of the creative arts therapies, exists in many forms and can be applicable to individuals, couples, families, and various groups.\n\nThe modern use of dramatic process and theatre as a therapeutic intervention began with Dr. Jacob L. Moreno's development of Psychodrama, an action-based form of psychoanalysis. However, although Moreno's psychodrama preceded the beginning and development of drama therapy by roughly half a century, the field of drama therapy established itself as a distinct modality within the creative arts therapies and cannot be seen as merely a evolved form of psychodrama. The field of drama therapy has expanded to allow many forms of theatrical interventions as therapy including role-play, theatre games, group-dynamic games, mime, puppetry, and other improvisational techniques. Often, drama therapy is utilized to help a client:\n\nThe theoretical foundation of drama therapy lies in drama, theater, psychology, psychotherapy, anthropology, play, as well as interactive and creative processes.\nIn his book, \"Drama as Therapy: Theory, practice and research,\" Phil Jones describes the emergence of the intentional use of drama as therapy as three-fold. First a long history of drama as a healing force with ancient roots in the healing rituals and dramas of various societies. The connection between drama and the psychological healing of society, though not of the individual, was first formally acknowledged by Aristotle, who was the originator of the term 'catharsis'. Secondly, in the early twentieth century, hospital theatre and the work of Moreno, Evreinov, and Iljine, marked a new attitude towards the relationship between therapy and theatre that provided a foundation for the emergence of drama therapy later in the century. Finally, influenced by experimental approaches to theatre, the advent and popularization of improvisational theater, group dynamics, role playing and psychology in the 1960s, drama therapy emerged as a creative arts therapy in the 1970s.\n\nToday, drama therapy is practiced around the world and there are presently academic training programs in Britain, Germany, the Netherlands, Canada, Croatia, Israel and the United States.\n\nPhil Jones has written in his book \"Drama as Therapy, Theatre as Living\" that there are nine core processes at the heart of drama therapy. These include projective identification and dramatic distancing. Projective identification is the process whereby a person feels the feelings that the other is unable to access themselves. Dramatic distancing refers to the way that emotional and psychological problems can be accessed easier through metaphor. The client has a distanced relationship through metaphor to these problems that makes them easier to tolerate.\n\nIn the US and Canada, the governing body is the North American Drama Therapy Association (NADTA), which establishes guidelines for the RDT (Registered Drama Therapist) credential and which provides accreditation for MA level programs and guidelines for alternative track training. In North America, Registered Drama Therapists hold a master's degree from one of five institutions accredited by the National Association for Drama Therapy: Antioch University at Seattle, Washington; Lesley University at Cambridge, Massachusetts; NYU Steinhardt at New York City, New York; California Institute of Integral Studies (CIIS) at San Francisco, California and Concordia University at Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Persons who hold a master's degree in a related field can be registered as a Drama Therapist by pursuing what is known as Alternate Route Training, which consists of graduate coursework and internships performed under the supervision of a board-certified trainer.\n\nIn the UK, the governing body is the British Association of Dramatherapists (BADth). There are currently five post-graduate training courses in Dramatherapy in the UK that lead to a qualification approved by the Health Professions Council, accredited by the British Association of Dramatherapists, and recognized by the Department of Health. These courses are offered at Roehampton University, University of Derby, Central School of Speech and Drama, Anglia Ruskin University, and The School of Dramatherapy at the Iron Mill Institute.\n\nIn China, drama therapy is an emerging field. It was first introduced to China in 2013. There heve been a few organizations working on the field recently, such as Apollo, Xinyishe etc. \nThe Hong Kong Association of Drama Therapists was established in 2009. Mr. Eddie Yu (President), Adeline Chan (Vice-president), Dorothy Wong and Kevin Ma are the founding members. Missions are to promote professional development of drama therapists in Hong Kong.\n\nMany of these universities suggest specific subjects to complete at degree level if you wish to pursue on to a masters programme in Drama Therapy. Some of these subjects are the following, Drama, Psychology or another such relevant profession.\n\nThe field of drama therapy can be somewhat intermittent in terms of techniques and procedures. However, there are some general commonalities. At the center of drama therapy are the elements of role and story. Participants in drama therapy follow roles to tell a story or perform a part, thus embracing a new perspective of the character and themselves. Another key element is space, or where the acting takes place. Other components of drama therapy include ritual, conflict, resistance, spontaneity, distance and catharsis.\n\nDrama therapy works to shed light on a feelings and behaviors of a person and helps teach them ways to manage and overcome obstacles they struggle with. The hope is that by taking on specific roles a person can gain personal insight and break free from barriers. Though this process can be very beneficial and rewarding, it can be very difficult. Progressions and developments can be slow going, and participants may be resistant to the process.\n\nThough drama therapy can be done individually, it is typically done in groups or community settings. Groups can involve hundreds of people at a time, but more commonly range from six to ten people in institutional settings. As a form of counseling drama therapy is usually private and doesn't involve spectators. The exception to this rule is therapeutic theatre, which blends the techniques of applied drama to drama therapy. Therapeutic theatre entails the performance of a group of people to a selected audience, making it somewhat public.\n\n\n"}

Drawing upon the writings of Ratramnus of the ninth century who considered Jesus \"spiritually present\" in the Eucharist, Berengarius denied that the historical Jesus, born of the Virgin Mary was present in the Eucharistic elements. His teaching on the subject became known throughout Europe by around 1047. His position was condemned subsequently by several regional councils including Rome (1050), Verecelli (1050) where for reasons unclear he was imprisoned briefly by the King, Tours (1055), Rome (1059), Poitiers (1075), and St. Maixeut (1076).\n\nWhile Berengarius had signed several vague retractions, it was when summoned to Rome by Pope Gregory VII in 1078 that he was given the historically famous \"credo\" to affirm publicly. This credo has been considered by theologians through the centuries as the first succinct doctrinal definition by the Church on the Eucharist. It is credited with crystallizing the ancient teachings of the Church on the Eucharist and ushering in the \"Eucharistic Renaissance\" of the High Middle Ages typified by a flourishing of various Eucharistic devotions.\n\nThe text of Gregory VII's Credo was quoted in it entirety in Pope Paul VI's encyclical letter, \"Mysterium fidei\", published in 1965.\n\nI believe in my heart and openly profess that the bread and wine placed upon the altar are, by the mystery of the sacred prayer and the words of the Redeemer, substantially changed into the true and life-giving flesh and blood of Jesus Christ our Lord, and that after the consecration, there is present the true body of Christ which was born of the Virgin and offered up for the salvation of the world, hung on the cross and now sits at the right hand of the Father, and that there is present the true blood of Christ which flowed from his side. They are present not only by means of a sign and of the efficacy of the Sacrament, but also in the very reality and truth of their nature and substance.\n\n"}

Prior to this revolution, the role of the Bolshevik woman was to tend to the household. Making sure the children were brought up in the traditional Soviet way of life was of up most importance in the household of the average Bolshevik. The average woman would prepare a meal that consisted of bread, vegetables and broth; and for wealthier families cheese, and a source of protein. In Bolshevik folklore the mother had the influential role of raising the children in the household; specifically about the household, values and the culture that would be represented among family members. The success and the rise of the Bolshevik regime, and the downfall of Czar Nicholas II and essentially his entire family, would subsequently leave a unique opportunity for the women of Russia. The Revolutionary War, and the large number of soldiers necessary to have an adequate defense left a void in the industrial sectors of the workforce, and that void was filled with hundreds of thousands of women, who had to assume the role left absent, by soldier fathers. As a platform Bolshevism advocated for the evolution of traditional gender roles; instead offering opportunities for women inside of the party when the Department for Work Among Women was created in 1919. Despite this strong push for change by the Zhenotdel, the immensely patriarchal society that had existed for hundreds of years prior, would supersede these efforts.\n\nThe feminist movement was seen by the majority peasant and workforce population as bourgeois, and therefore represented something opposite of the Bolshevik idea. The emphasis on the immediate household as priority was pertinent, especially to the 1930s era of Soviet Russia. Since the Paleolithic era of Russia, there has been a fascination with the immortalization, of the mother figure. \"The Motherland Calls\", statute spoke up about the unrealistic expectations that the Soviet Union had on their female mothers. Motherhood, they posited, was not some divine consciousness, but instead something inherently learned as a result of being a woman. Some argued that the traditional role of the mother should be challenged, and that it was not like it had been in years passed. In many instances the domestic work was piled onto the female head of the house, despite promotion of equality between genders. This left in unequal workload on the woman, who would also have a job outside of the home to help provide in a particularly difficult economy where food and adequate housing was often scarce. However, despite this argument, the role of the Bolshevik woman remained static. Stalin himself held both men and women to the same standard, with equal harshness doled out to both sexes. In the final years of his rule, pre-revolution ideology persisted, and women were merely thought of as objects necessary for child-bearing. In the 1960s, it was expected of the Russian woman to fall in line with the patriarchal leadership of her husband.\n\nMarxist theory on family established the revolutionary ideal for the Soviet state and influenced state policy concerning family in varying degrees throughout the history of the country. The principals are: The nuclear family unit is an economic arrangement structured to maintain the ideological functions of Capitalism. The family unit perpetuates class inequality through the transfer of private property through inheritance. Following the abolition of private property, the bourgeois family will cease to exist and the union of individuals will become a “purely private affair”. \nThe Soviet state’s first code on marriage and family was written in 1918 and enacted a series of trans-formative laws designed to bring the soviet family closer in line with Marxist theory.\n\nOne year after the Bolsheviks took power, they ratified the 1918 Code on Marriage, the Family and Guardianship. The revolutionary jurists, led by Alexander Goikhbarg, adhered to the revolutionary principals of Marx, Engles, and Lenin when drafting the codes. Goikhbarg considered the nuclear family unit to be a necessary but transitive social arrangement that would quickly be phased out by the growing communal resources of the state and would eventually “wither away”. The jurists intended for the code to provide a temporary legal framework to maintain protections for women and children until a system of total communal support could be established.\n\nThe 1918 code also served to recognize the legal rights of the individual at the expense of the existing tsarist/patriarchal system of family and marriage. This was accomplished by allowing easily obtainable “no-grounds” divorces. It abolished “illegitimacy” of birth as a legal concept and entitled all children to parental support. It abolished the adoption of orphans ( Orphans would be cared for by the state to avoid exploitation). A married couple could take either surname. Individual property would be retained in the event of divorce. An unlimited term of alimony could be awarded to either spouse, but upon separation each party was expected to care for themselves. Women were to be recognized as equal under the law; Prior to 1914, women were not allowed to earn a wage, seek education, or exchange property without the consent of her husband.\n\nThe 1918 code accomplished many of the goals that the jurists had sought to set into motion, but the social disruption left in the wake of World War I exposed the inadequacies of the code to alleviate social problems. The 1926 code would revive a more conservative definition of the family in a legal sense. “The 1918 code had been motivated by a desire to lead society forward to new social relationships in line with socialist thought on marriage and family, the 1926 code attempted to solve immediate problems, in particular to ensure the financial well-being”. The hotly debated social concerns included: the unmanageable number of orphans, the unemployment of women, the lack of protection after divorce, common property and divorce, and the obligations of unmarried, cohabitating partners.\n\nIn 1921 alone, seven million orphans were displaced, roaming town and countryside. Government agencies simply did not have the resources to care for the children. An adopted child could be cared for by a family at virtually no cost to the state. The 1926 code would reinstate adoption as a solution for child homelessness.\n\nIn 1921 New Economic Policy (NEP), brought about a limited restoration of private enterprise and free markets. It also brought and end to labor conscription. The result was a spike in female unemployment as “War Communism” came to and end and NEP emerged. Hundreds of thousands of unemployed women did not have registered marriages and were left with no means of support or protections following a divorce under the 1918 code. The 1926 code would make unregistered marriages legal in order to safeguard women by extending alimony to unregistered\", de facto\" wives. The purpose being that more women would be cared for in times of widespread unemployment.\n\nUnder the 1918 code, there was no division of property in the event of a divorce. Marriage was not be an economic partnership and each party was entitled to individual property. This meant that women who ran the household and cared for the children would not be entitled to any material share of what the “provider” had brought to the marriage. In another conservative move, the 1926 code would require an equal division of property acquired during a marriage. All property acquired during the course of a marriage would become “common”. With intentions similar to the legal recognition of \"de facto\" marriages, this new property law was a response to the lack of protections offered to women in the event of divorce.\n\nAdditionally the code would do away with the 1918 concept of “collective paternity” where multiple men could be assigned to pay alimony if the father of a child could not be determined. According to the 1926 code, paternity could be assigned by a judge. It also enlarged family obligations by expanding alimony obligations to include children, parents, siblings and grandparents. Alimony would also have set time limits. The 1926 code would signal a retreat from many policies that served to weaken the family in 1918. The jurists were not pursuing an ideological maneuver away from socialism, rather than taking more “temporary” measures to ensure the well-being of women and children since communal care had yet to materialize.\n\nUnlike earlier codes that arranged for temporary and transitive laws as a step toward the revolutionary vision of family; the Code of 1936 marked an ideological shift away from Marxist / revolutionary visions of the nuclear family. Coinciding with the rise of Stalinism, the law demanded the stabilizing and strengthening of the family. “The “withering-away” doctrine, once central to socialist understand of the family, law, and the state, was anathematized.”\n\nThe 1936 code emerged among along with an eruption of pro-family propaganda. For the first time, the code outlawed abortion and imposed fines and jail time for any that received or performed the service. The code also enacted a bevy of laws aimed to encourage pregnancy and child birth. Insurance stipends, pregnancy leave, job security, light duty, child care services and payments for large families. In another drastic move, the code made it more difficult to obtain a divorce. Under the code, both parties would need to be present for a divorce and pay a fine. There could be harsh penalties for those who failed to pay alimony and child-support payments.\n\n“Our demands grow day to day. We need fighters, they build this life. We need people.” The wider campaign to encourage the family unit elevated motherhood to a form of Stakhanovite labor. During this time, motherhood was celebrated as patriotic and the joys of children and family were extolled by the country’s leaders.\n\nThe Family Edict of 1944 would be a continuation of the conservative trending of the 1936 code. Citing the heavy manpower losses and social disruption following World War II, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet enacted laws that would further encourage marriage and childbirth.\n\nThe 1944 Edict offered greater state-sponsored benefits to mothers, including: Extended maternity leave, increased family allowances even to unmarried mothers, promises of burgeoning child care services, targeted labor protections, and most notably, state recognition and the honorary title “Mother Heroine” for mothers who could produce large families.\n\nThe edict also sought to preserve the family unit by making divorces even more difficult to obtain. Fines were increased and the parties were often ordered to attempt reconciliation. Divorce also became a public matter. Divorcees were required to appear in public court and their intent was published in the local newspaper.\n\nThe early Soviet state sought to remake the family, believing that although the economic emancipation of workers would deprive families of their economic function, it would not destroy the institution but rather base family relations exclusively on mutual affection. The Bolsheviks replaced religious marriage with civil marriage, divorce became easy to obtain, and unwed mothers received special protection. All children, whether legitimate or illegitimate, had equal rights before the law, women gained sexual equality under matrimonial law, inheritance of property was abolished, and abortion was legalized.\n\nIn the early 1920s, however, the weakening of family ties, combined with the devastation and dislocation caused by the Russian Civil War (1918–21), resulted in nearly 7 million homeless children. This situation prompted senior Bolshevik Party officials to conclude that the State needed a more stable family life to rebuild the country's economy and shattered social structure. By 1922 the government allowed some forms of inheritance, and after 1926 full inheritance rights were restored. By the late 1920s, adults had been made more responsible for the care of their children, and common-law marriage had been given equal legal status with civil marriage.\nDuring Joseph Stalin's rule (late 1920s to 1953), the trend toward strengthening the family continued. In 1936 the government began to award payments to women with large families, banned abortions, and made divorces more difficult to obtain. In 1942 it subjected single persons and childless married persons to additional taxes. In 1944 only registered marriages were recognized to be legal, and divorce became subject to court discretion. In the same year the government began to award medals to women who gave birth to five or more children and took upon itself the support of illegitimate children.\n\nAfter Stalin's death in 1953, the government moved in a more revisionist direction and rescinded some of its natalist legislation. In 1955 it declared abortions for medical reasons legal, and in 1968 it declared all abortions legal, following Western European policy. The state also liberalized divorce procedures in the mid-1960s, but in 1968 introduced new limitations.\n\nIn 1974 the government began to subsidize poorer families whose average per-capita income did not exceed 50 rubles per month (later raised to 75 rubles per month in some northern and eastern regions). The subsidy amounted to 12 rubles per month for each child below eight years of age. It was estimated that in 1974 about 3.5 million families (14 million people, or about 5% of the entire population) received this subsidy. With the increase in per-capita income, however, the number of children requiring such assistance decreased. In 1985 the government raised the age limit for assistance to twelve years and under. In 1981 the subsidy to an unwed mother with a child increased to 20 rubles per month; in early 1987 an estimated 1.5 million unwed mothers were receiving such assistance, or twice as many as during the late 1970s.\n\nFamily size and composition depended mainly on the place of residence—urban or rural—and ethnic group. The size and composition of such families was also influenced by housing and income limitations, pensions, and female employment outside the home. The typical urban family consisted of a married couple, two children, and, in about 20% of the cases, one of the grandmothers, whose assistance in raising the children and in housekeeping was important in the large majority of families having two wage earners. Rural families generally had more children than urban families and often supported three generations under one roof. Families in Central Asia and the Caucasus tended to have more children than families elsewhere in the Soviet Union and included grandparents in the family structure. In general, the average family size followed that of other industrialized countries, with higher income families having both fewer children and a lower rate of infant mortality. From the early 1960s to the late 1980s, the number of families with more than one child decreased by about 50% and in 1988 totaled 1.9 million. About 75% of the families with more than one child lived in the southern regions of the country, half of them in Central Asia. In the Russian, Ukrainian, Belorussian, Moldovian, Estonian, Latvian, and Lithuanian republics, families with one and two children constituted more than 90% of all families, whereas in Central Asia those with three or more children ranged from 14% in the Kyrgyz Republic to 31% in the Tajik. Surveys suggested that most parents would have had more children if they had had more living space.\n\nBeginning in the mid-1980s, the government promoted family planning in order to slow the growth of the Central Asian indigenous populations. Local opposition to this policy surfaced especially in the Uzbek and Tajik republics. In general, however, the government continued publicly to honor mothers of large families. Women received the Motherhood Medal, Second Class, for their fifth live birth and the Mother Heroine medal for their tenth. Most of these awards went to women in Central Asia and the Caucasus.\n\nThe primary form of contraception practiced in the early USSR was coitus interruptus. Scarcity of rubber made condoms and diaphragms unavailable, and contraception was rarely discussed by political figures.\n\nThe U.S.S.R. was the first country in the world to legalize abortion. For many years prior to the October Revolution, abortion was not uncommon in Russia, although it was illegal and carried a possible sentence of hard labor or exile. After the revolution, famine and poor economic conditions led to an increase in the number of “back alley” abortions, and after pressure from doctors and jurists, the Commissariats of Health and Justice legalized abortion in 1920. Abortions were free for all women, although they were seen as a necessary evil due to economic hardship rather than a woman’s right to control her own reproductive system.\n\nThrough the 1930s, a rising number of abortions coupled with a falling birthrate alarmed Soviet officials, with a recorded 400,000 abortions taking place in 1926 alone. In 1936 the Soviet Central Executive Committee made abortion illegal once again. This, along with stipends granted to recent mothers and bonuses given for women who bore many children, was part of an effort to combat the falling birthrate.\n\nThe extended family was more prevalent in Central Asia and the Caucasus than in the other sections of the country and, generally, in rural areas more than in urban areas. Deference to parental wishes regarding marriage was particularly strong in these areas, even among the Russians residing there.\n\nExtended families helped perpetuate traditional life-styles. The patriarchal values that accompany this life-style affected such issues as contraception, the distribution of family power, and the roles of individuals in marriage and the family. For example, traditional Uzbeks placed a higher value on their responsibilities as parents than on their own happiness as spouses and individuals. The younger and better educated Uzbeks and working women, however, were more likely to behave and think like their counterparts in the European areas of the Soviet Union, who tended to emphasize individual careers.\n\nExtended families were not prevalent in the cities. Couples lived with parents during the first years of marriage only because of economics or the housing shortage. When children were born, the couple usually acquired a separate apartment.\n\nThe government assumed many functions of the pre-Soviet family. Various public institutions, for example, took responsibility for supporting individuals during times of sickness, incapacity, old age, maternity, and industrial injury. State-run nurseries, preschools, schools, clubs, and youth organizations took over a great part of the family's role in socializing children. Their role in socialization was limited, however, because preschools had places for only half of all Soviet children under seven. Despite government assumption of many responsibilities, spouses were still responsible for the material support of each other, minor children, and disabled adult children.\n\nThe transformation of the patriarchal, three-generation rural household to a modern, urban family of two adults and two children attests to the great changes that Soviet society had undergone since 1917. That transformation did not produce the originally envisioned egalitarianism, but it has forever changed the nature of what was once the Russian Empire.\n\nThe history of the Soviet Union diet prior to World War II encompasses different periods that have varying influences on food production and availability. Periods of low crop yields, and restrictive distribution of food in the early 1920s, and again in the early 1930s brought about great famine and suffrage in the Soviet Union. Farming was one of the main efforts for food production, and was at the center of development in support of Soviet communism. When crops failed or suffered from low yields, Soviet peasants suffered greatly from malnutrition.\nThe traditional types of food found in the Soviet Union were made up of various grains for breads and pastries, dairy products such as cheese and yogurt, and various meats such as pork, fish, beef and chicken. Vegetables were less abundant than the other forms of food due to the strain on resources and poor crop yields. Potatoes were a very important staple for Soviet families. Potatoes were easily grown and harvested in many different environments, and were usually reliable as a food source. Malnutrition was a prominent factor in poor health conditions and individual growth during this period in the Soviet Union. \nMuch like the Western tradition of three main meals a day, the Soviet meals consisted of breakfast (Zavtrak), lunch (Obed), and dinner (Ouzin). Soups and broths made of meats and vegetables when available, were common meals for the Soviet peasant Family.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "14540045", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14540045", "title": "George Jackson Brigade", "text": "George Jackson Brigade\n\nThe George Jackson Brigade, was a revolutionary group based in Seattle, Washington, which was named after George Jackson, a dissident prisoner and Black Panther member shot and killed during an alleged escape attempt at San Quentin Prison in 1971.\n\nThe members included two ex-cons: Ed Mead and John Sherman, and prison-rights activists: Bruce Seidel, Rita \"Bo\" Brown, and Therese Coupez. They were later joined by Mark Cook, who was the only African American in the group. They were involved in violent acts and claimed to use force to overthrow the United States Government or the government of the State of Washington. The group justified their actions by claiming to further the ends of a revolution of the masses to overthrow the present governmental and international business structures and to establish a system of communism. In various communiqués, the group claimed credit for bank robberies, bombings, attacks against custom houses, court houses, Safeway stores, public utilities and correction facilities.\n\nFrom March 1975 to December 1977, the Seattle Brigade robbed at least seven banks and detonated about 20 pipe bombs—mainly targeting government buildings, electric power facilities, Safeway stores, and companies accused of racism.\n\nOn January 23, 1976, the Tukwila branch of the Pacific National Bank was robbed by several armed men including Mead, Sherman, Siedel, and Cook. Mead was captured, Sherman was wounded in the jaw, and Seidel was killed. Cook fled in a car. Six weeks later, Cook freed Sherman after shooting his police escort(King County Sheriff Officer Virgil Johnson) as they walked out of Harborview Medical Center, but Cook was captured the following day. Sherman remained free for two years before his recapture.\n\nIn 1974 Ed Mead traveled to San Francisco, just a few years after his release from prison for a pharmacy burglary, hoping to connect with the Symbionese Liberation Army however when he arrived it was another group he joined with. The group he joined was the New World Liberation Front or NWLF, it was from this group that Ed Mead learned to make pipe bombs. Upon arriving back home in Seattle he met with his friend Bruce Seidel and it was at this meeting that they decided to take up arms for their political beliefs. The two decided to deliver on the former Black Panther lieutenant George Jackson’s promise and thus the name George Jackson Brigade. In the George Jackson Brigade there were a mixture of Communist and Anarchist ideologies. In its operations, it also tried to avoid killing or injuring civilians at all costs.\nMead was released in 1993 after serving 18 years in state and federal institutions. Sherman, who later escaped—again—from a federal prison in California, was released in 1998. Brown, Coupez, and Janine Bertram, are all free after serving four- to eight-year sentences. Mark Cook remained in prison for 24 years, until 2000. \n\nTheir first attack was the bombing of the department of corrections building in Olympia, Washington. Their second attack was also their first failure as a group, the target was the Safeway on Capitol Hill the group snuck a pipe bomb hidden in a 50-pound bag of dog food and left it in the store. Ed Mead then called the Safeway store and informed them there was a bomb however, he claimed he was blown off as a prank while the Seattle press reported he called the wrong number. Civilians were injured and the George Jackson Brigade received a lot of bad press for the attack. The George Jackson Brigade wanted to redistribute wealth as well as overthrow the government and make the \"ruling class\" pay for keeping them from being successful. The main goal of the George Jackson Brigade was to replace the Capitalist government with a more humane government. The George Jackson Brigade stated that any revolution that occurs the ruling class would meet with violence so they must be prepared to use violence themselves. After each attack the carried out, successful or unsuccessful they would send a communique explaining why each place had been attacked. They also used these communiques as a way to communicate with authorities.\n\nThe downfall of the George Jackson Brigade started in January 23 1976 when they attempted to rob a bank in Tukwila, Washington. Two police officers and one member of the George Jackson Brigade, Bruce Seidel, were killed along with John Sherman and Ed Mead being arrested with John Sherman also being wounded. Then on March 10 of the same year Mark Cook rescued John Sherman from police custody however he shot a police officer in the stomach in the process they both escaped but Cook was captured a few days later and spent the next 25 years in prison. The remaining members retreated to regroup and came back in the Fall of 1977 however in September 1977 Brown was arrested while casing a bank. Then on March 21 of 1978 Sherman, Coupez, and Brown's now new girlfriend Bertram were arrested in a Tacoma restaurant right before executing another robbery. \n\nAccording to a report published by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism for the United States Department of Homeland Security's DHS Science and Technology Directorate, the George Jackson Brigade was ranked fifteenth among terrorist groups that perpetrated the most terrorist attacks in the United States between 1970 and 2011.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "17097555", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17097555", "title": "Hard and soft science", "text": "Hard and soft science\n\nHard science and soft science are colloquial terms used to compare scientific fields on the basis of perceived methodological rigor, exactitude, and objectivity. Roughly speaking natural sciences (e.g. biology, chemistry, physics) are considered \"hard\", whereas the social sciences (e.g. economics, psychology, sociology) are usually described as \"soft\".\n\nPrecise definitions vary, but features often cited as characteristic of hard science include producing testable predictions, performing controlled experiments, relying on quantifiable data and mathematical models, a high degree of accuracy and objectivity, higher levels of consensus, faster progression of the field, greater explanatory success, cumulativeness, replicability, and generally applying a purer form of the scientific method. A closely related idea (originating in the nineteenth century with Auguste Comte) is that scientific disciplines can be arranged into a hierarchy of hard to soft on the basis of factors such as rigor, \"development\", and whether they are basic or applied.\n\nSome philosophers and sociologists of science have questioned the relationship between these characteristics and perceived hardness or softness. The more \"developed\" hard sciences do not necessarily have a greater degree of consensus or selectivity in accepting new results. Commonly cited methodological differences are also not a reliable indicator. For example, social sciences such as psychology and sociology use mathematical models extensively, but are usually considered soft sciences. However, there are some measurable differences between hard and soft sciences. For example, hard sciences make more extensive use of graphs, and soft sciences are more prone to a rapid turnover of buzzwords.\n\nThe metaphor has been criticised for unduly stigmatizing soft sciences, creating an imbalance in the public perception, funding, and recognition of different fields.\n\nThe origin of the terms \"hard science\" and \"soft science\" is obscure. The earliest attested use of \"hard science\" is found in an 1858 issue of the \"Journal of the Society of Arts\", but the idea of a hierarchy of the sciences can be found earlier, in the work of the French philosopher Auguste Comte (1798‒1857). He identified astronomy as the most general science, followed by physics, chemistry, biology, then sociology. This view was highly influential, and was intended to classify fields based on their degree of intellectual development and the complexity of their subject matter.\n\nThe modern distinction between hard and soft science is often attributed to an 1964 article published in \"Science\" by John R. Platt. He explored why he considered some scientific fields to be more productive than others, though he did not actually use the terms themselves. In 1967, sociologist of science Norman W. Storer specifically distinguished between the natural sciences as hard and the social sciences as soft. He defined hardness in terms of the degree to which a field uses mathematics and described a trend of scientific fields increasing in hardness over time, identifying features of increased hardness as including better integration and organization of knowledge, an improved ability to detect errors, and an increase in the difficulty of learning the subject.\n\nSociologist Stephen Cole conducted a number of empirical studies attempting to find evidence for a hierarchy of scientific disciplines, and was unable to find significant differences in terms of core of knowledge, degree of codification, or research material. Differences that he did find evidence for included a tendency for textbooks in soft sciences to rely on more recent work, while the material in textbooks from the hard sciences was more consistent over time. However, it has been suggested that Cole might have missed some relationships in the data because he studied individual measurements, without accounting for the way multiple measurements could trend in the same direction, and because not all the criteria that could indicate a discipline’s scientific status were analysed.\n\nCleveland 1984 performed a survey of 57 journals and found that natural science journals used many more graphs than journals in mathematics or social science, and that social science journals often presented large amounts of observational data in the absence of graphs. The amount of page area used for graphs ranged from 0% to 31%, and the variation was primarily due to the number of graphs included rather than their sizes. Further analyses by Smith in 2000, based on samples of graphs from journals in seven major scientific disciplines, found that the amount of graph usage correlated \"almost perfectly\" with hardness (r=0.97). They also suggested that the hierarchy applies with individual fields, and demonstrated the same result using ten subfields of psychology (r=0.93).\n\nFanelli 2010 proposed that we expect more positive outcomes in \"softer\" sciences because there are fewer constraints on researcher bias. They found that among research papers that tested a hypothesis, the frequency of positive results was predicted by the perceived hardness of the field. For example, the social sciences as a whole had a 2.3-fold increased odds of positive results compared to the physical sciences, with the biological sciences in between. They added that this supported the idea that the social sciences and natural sciences differ only in degree, as long as the social sciences follow the scientific approach.\n\nFanelli 2013 tested whether the ability of researchers in a field to \"achieve consensus and accumulate knowledge\" increases with the hardness of the science, and sampled 29,000 papers from 12 disciplines using measurements that indicate the degree of scholarly consensus. Out of the three possibilities (hierarchy, hard/soft distinction, or no ordering), the results supported a hierarchy, with physical sciences performing the best followed by biological sciences and then social sciences. The results also held within disciplines, as well as when mathematics and the humanities were included.\n\nCritics of the concept argue that soft sciences are implicitly considered to be less \"legitimate\" scientific fields, or simply not scientific at all. An editorial in \"Nature\" stated that social science findings are more likely to intersect with everyday experience and may be dismissed as \"obvious or insignificant\" as a result. Being labelled a soft science can affect the perceived value of a discipline to society and the amount of funding available to it. In the 1980s, mathematician Serge Lang successfully blocked influential political scientist Samuel P. Huntington's admission to the US National Academy of Sciences, describing Huntington's use of mathematics to quantify the relationship between factors such as \"social frustration\" (Lang asked Huntington if he possessed a \"social-frustration meter\") as \"pseudoscience\". During the late 2000s recessions, social science was disproportionately targeted for funding cuts compared to mathematics and natural science. Proposals were made for the United States' National Science Foundation to cease funding disciplines such as political science altogether. Both of these incidents prompted critical discussion of the distinction between hard and soft sciences.\n\n"}

The global crisis was felt in all areas of human activity in the personal, social, economic, political and religious fields. By 1969, this small initial group had expanded into numerous groups in Argentina and Chile and their presence began to be noticed by the military regime of Argentina then in power. In the early years, the Humanist Movement was known as \"Siloism\", coined from the penname \"Silo\" of its founder Mario Rodríguez Cobos. The military regimes of Argentina and Chile began to censor and persecute the members during its meetings, gatherings, public acts and demonstrations. On May 4, 1969, the \"siloists\" gathered in Punta de Vacas, Mendoza, Argentina and the speech \"The Healing of Suffering\" was given by Silo. This marks the foundation day for the Humanist Movement.\n\nThe systematic persecution of members in Chile and Argentina propelled the expansion of the movement to other countries. These countries included those in North America and Europe (i.e., Spain, Italy, Portugal and France) and the Asian countries of Philippines, South Korea, India and China.\n\nIn March 1973, four Chilean movement members arrived in the Philippines. On September of the previous year, martial law had been declared and the Philippines was experiencing the violence and suppression of the Ferdinand Marcos dictatorship. The press was controlled, the leftist and opposition groups had been neutralized or gone underground, curfews were enforced and fear permeated the political and university scenario. The Chilean humanists initially made contact with the students of the University of the Philippines Diliman.\n\nIn 1974, soloist books \"Transcendental Meditation\" and \"Silo and the Liberation\" (Vol. II) were printed locally.\n\nIn 1975 the Chileans left and in the next years were followed by Argentinian members who continued the tasks of organizing and transmitting the studies underlying the Humanist Movement. The Humanist Movement in the following years briefly went through internal stages at different moments and was then referred to as the School. The Synthesis Institute and enter of Inner Religion were launched in order to carry forward its studies but these were later discontinued.\n\nBy 1979, there was a core group of Filipinos who took on the challenge of organizing the movement in the Philippines. In December 1980, \"Silo\" or Mario Rodriguez Cobos visited the Philippines for a working seminar with Filipino members held at the AIT in the University of the Philippines in Diliman, Quezon City.\n\nThe 1980s marked the stage of public demonstrations. A worldwide campaign “Humanize the Earth” was launched in a massive public act on November 1, 1981 at Chowpatty Beach, Mumbai, India by its newly formed socio-cultural organization The Community for the Equilibrium and Development of the Human Being. This was followed by large public acts done in the major cities of North and South America, Europe and India. Speakers from various countries, among them members from India and the Philippines, represented these public acts.\n\nIn 1982, the Community translated its materials into Pilipino and published its books “Ang Mga Gawain ng Komunidad” and “Ang Tanawing Panloob”.\n\nThe Community for the Equilibrium and Development of the Human Being was registered under the Securities and Exchange Commission on July, 1981, with nine incorporators. Meetings and activities started in Orion/Guerrero Sts. in Makati, P. Tuazon at Quezon City, Petrona Apartment in Manila, Carolina’s at Quezon Blvd., rented rooms, homes and ad hoc meeting places in schools and universities.\n\nAt this time Filipino society was gradually deteriorating under the Marcos dictatorship and the climate of apathy and suspicion surrounded its initial public activities. However, as a SEC registered organization espousing change through non-violence, the initial obstacles placed by government officials on its public acts were gradually overcome. A flurry of public events and organizing activities marked the next three years carrying the banner “Humanize the Earth”. This was marked by numerous cultural open-air presentations, free public concerts and festivals, indoor socio-cultural events, AV shows, lectures and workshops.\n\nIn 1982, student chapters of The Community were formed in the National College of Business Administration, University of Sto. Tomas, University of the Philippines, Philippine Normal College, and University of the East where a locale was established in the Underwood Building along Claro M. Recto, Manila along what is known as the university belt. The Community UP Chapter organized the “Humanist Week” composed of exhibits, film showing, seminars and workshops (April 30 to May 6, 1984, Diliman Campus in Quezon City). Workshops such as \"Student Power for Non-Violence\" were organized in schools and universities.\n\nOn May 4, 1984, the Movement in the Philippines launched a public concert called \"A Day of Joy\" held at the Glorietta Park in Makati.\n\nThere were metro-wide signature campaigns done to create awareness on the violence, get support and participation, and to address social issues. There were socio-cultural celebrations, symposia, campaigns on education and women's rights.\n\nIn the late 1970s and early years of the 1980s, the Marcos regime was fast losing its popularity. Business investments were pulling out, the economic and political future bleak. There was an exodus of Filipinos who left the country to look for better prospects or to seek political asylum. The majority of Filipinos were getting fed up but kept their views to themselves; in general, avoiding public outcry due to adverse reaction from the repressive government. It was in this general repressed scenario that The Community launched its public acts. Denouncements were made against violence, and active non-violence was proposed as a way of action. Forums, workshops, lectures, slide presentations and film showings were held in private as well as public municipal halls.\n\nOn August 21, 1983, the assassination of Benigno Aquino, Marcos’ political opponent, created ripples in Philippine society. It broke the political stupor of the Filipinos and their discontent could not be silenced anymore.\n\nIn 1984, the Humanist Movement, as an international structure, simultaneously launched the Humanist Party in different parts of the world. The Humanist Party is a political party to carry forward the humanist aspirations in the political arena. In 1984, a team of Italian humanists came to the Philippines to help establish the Humanist Party.\n\nIn 1985, it launched national campaigns with signature campaigns against the Preventive Detention Action, Pasya ng Bayan (people’s vote to oust Marcos), Magkaisa (awareness campaign against traditional political parties with the proposal for the people to organize themselves), labor and human rights. In 1985, The Humanist Party participated in labor rallies, conducted surveys and free medical and dental clinics. It organized chapters in the NCR, northern and southern Luzon, and Mindanao. In 1987 it organized and held Humanist Party internal elections in the base council levels.\n\nOn February 7, 1986, the national snap elections were held by the Marcos regime to try to pacify the increasing discontent of the Filipino people. Corazon “Cory” Aquino (the widow of assassinated Benigno Aquino) ran for presidential office. Marcos’victory was declared by the Commission on Elections but the majority of Filipino people refused to accept the rigged outcome. When the call for people's support came from the Enrile-Ramos breakaway military group in Camp Crame on February 22, spontaneous groups and organizations from different political positions, conscientious citizens, Catholic organizations rushed to the gates of Camp Crame. The spontaneous mobilization of people effectively blocked the main thoroughfare of the city. Subsequently, people from the other cities and provinces joined their support. The Humanist Party was among the first groups to answer the call for people's support, its political headquarters was located at P. Tuazon Street near Camp Crame. History recalls this moment as the 1986 People Power Revolution (People Power 1 or the EDSA 1 Revolution), a non-violent phenomenon that gathered hundreds of thousands of people, finally culminating in the overthrow of the Marcos dictatorship and placing Corazon Aquino as the president.\n\nIt was during the 1986 Snap Elections that the Humanist Party first fielded independent candidates for Councilors of Manila and Quezon City as its first political campaign action.\n\nOn December 10, 1986 the Humanist Party was launched at the steps of the Arts and Science Building of the University of the Philippines, Diliman, Quezon City. This launch was preceded by a metro-wide teaser campaign that consisted of posting large posters with the words DEC 10 all along the main streets and avenues. On December 14, 1986, the Humanist Party held its first National Congress at U.P. Diliman, Quezon City.\n\nWhen President Corazon Aquino took office, one of the priorities of the government was to abolish the 1973 Philippine Constitution (which was in force during the Martial Law under the Marcos regime) and draft a new constitution by elected representatives to the Constitutional Assembly. One of the first campaigns launched by the Humanist Party after the fall of the Marcos dictatorship was \"Konsultahin Ang Tao\" as a requisite before drafting a new Philippine constitution.\n\nIn March 1987, the Humanist Party of the Philippines filed with the Commission on Elections for political party status and was granted.\n\nHowever, the Humanist Party was short-lived. Its members, at that time were more inclined towards socio-cultural activities rather than political expression. It experienced a loss of crucial leadership by emigration of some of its founding members to other countries; and when there was an emphasis and redirection towards structural Humanist Movement activities, the Humanist Party activities were dropped.\n\nOn May 2, 1988, “Unzipped” A Festival of Converging Diversity participated by various artists and musicians was organized at the Greenbelt Park at Makati, this time by the Humanist Movement in close coordination with the Greenbelt Organic Producers Market.\n\nThe 1990s ushered in a new stage, that of influencing the social and immediate environment and taking root in the community, work and school places where members belonged. The Humanist Movement was the banner organization and numerous study groups, weekly meetings, workshops, “encounters” of self-development, “retreats”, “personal works” were organized to qualify members and plan activities. Neighborhood Centers were established in Baclaran, Sampaloc, Pasig at the Victory Theater Building, Taytay, Makati, Mandaluyong, Muñoz-Quezon City, San Francisco del Monte-Quezon City, Teachers Village-Quezon City, Iligan City. The thrust was that the principles of new humanism take root not only in the inner life (in the heart and mind) but to find its expression (in action) in the social life of family, friends, school and work.\n\nFrom 1988 to 1993, the Humanist Movement took up the ecological banner and launched activities under the Green Party of the Philippines and Green Future. Concerned with environmental deterioration due to indiscriminate logging and mining in the countryside and industrial pollution, its members organized environmental awareness activities in the areas of Pasig, Mandaluyong, Pasay and Makati and the universities of Manila and Quezon City.\n\nInformation campaigns such as Unite and Sign to Oppose Killer Smog (USOK) were organized in public parks and high schools, art contests were sponsored, youth \"No Nukes\" parties were organized.\n\nIn Pasig City, the issue of industrial pollution by Chemphil led to an investigative committee composed of residents, religious and community organizers, and Green Party members. With this strong alliance of various organizations, a congressional hearing was held on Chemphil at the Batasang Pambansa Complex.\n\nIt was that in the mid and later years of the 1990s that neighborhood and university newsletters under the Humanist Movement began to proliferate. Newsletters: Tangy Na, Voices of Taytay, Humanist Movement Monthly, Poblacion Neighborhood Newsletter, Human-Net, Naked Eye, ZONE-Net, ABAI, Humanista, Born to Write, Humanists Writers Club.\n\nHumanist clubs such as Samahan ng Makataong Kabataan (SMK), UP Student Humanist Movement (UPHSM), Taytay Humanists, ABAI, Baclaran Humanist Club were formed. Action fronts such as World Without Wars and ZONE were formed.\n\nAlso it was also in these years that books of the Humanist Movement were published internationally and began to circulate. Also activities of The Community for Human Development was developed through self-development workshops given to NGOs and social work groups.\n\nOn May 4, 1997 the Humanist Movement publicly celebrated its founding date at the Quezon Memorial Circle at Quezon City.\n\nIn 1996, gay humanists participated in the Gay Pride Parade – Solidarity ’96: The Lesbian and Gay Pride March. It was a significant stage for the humanist members to come out into the open and fight gender discrimination. They demanded no special rights but equal rights as human beings. The Humanist Movement members participated carrying the banner of ZONE: Convergence of Gay Humanists and Friends. They also organized workshops for personal work, seminars on gay rights.\n\nThe next year ZONE together with the Kilusan ng Kasamang Minorya ng Pilipinas Inc. (KAMPI) and strongly supported by the Imelda Arcilla Papin Foundation, organized The First Philippine Gay Olympics: Unity in Diversity.\n\nOn March 17, 1997, active members of the Humanist Movement in the Philippines formalized the action front ZONE Convergence of Gay Humanists and Friends with the Securities and Exchange Commission. They were invited to talk shows to give their position on gays in the military.\n\nOn March 21–22, 1998, the Coalition of Humanist Gays and Lesbians for Elections ’98 held a two-day forum for presidential candidates called “Elections ’98: Gay Empowerment Year 2000” at theU.P. Film Center Cinematheque, Diliman. Presidential candidates were invited to talk on their political agenda for gays and lesbians and after the forum mock presidential elections were held. This activity attracted wide media interest.\n\nIn 1999, ZONE joined the Task Force Pride in charge with organizing the Manila Gay Pride March ’99: 1999 Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Pride March.\n\nAmong its varied activities ZONE continues to study and research on gay issues and release position papers. Among these are the issues on the prohibition on sexual transplant, gay marriages, military service, charter change. It continues networking activities with other organizations as well as media development.\n\nThe Kapisanan ng Tao Bilang Sentro took root in Payatas, Quezon City.\n\nIn the 1996 the organization World Without Wars or Violence was organized worldwide and locally. It started with a global project petitioning for a one-week ceasefire in Year 2000, to demonstrate the feasibility of worldwide peace. The Foundation for World Without Wars was SEC-registered and signature campaigns were launched in San Sebastian College, University of the Philippines, Greenbelt Mall and other areas in Metro-Manila.\n\nThere was no significant activity of The Community during these years. Activities had shifted to action fronts, initiatives and activities of the Humanist Movement. The Community lay dormant in the Philippines. However, The Community for Human Development, as an international organization, continued to develop in other countries.\n\nWith the start of the millennium a new mission arrived in the Philippines to open up new structural lines of the movement.\n\nIn July, 2005, The Community was registered at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as Ang Komunidad para sa Ikauunlad ng Tao. From 2005 to 2006, workshops on nonviolence, forums, and painting activities involved the students of Manggahan, Kapitolyo, Sagad, Pinagbuhatan, Eusebio and Rizal HS, public secondary level schools in Pasig City as well as the tertiary Rizal Technological University, Pasig Campus.\n\nIn 2007, a joint activity was launched by the different councils - “Edukasyong Walang Karahasan”, (Forum for Active Nonviolence In Education) where teachers, students and school administrators attended coming from NCR area.\n\nThe same year the United Nations declared October 2 as International Day of Non-Violence. To commemorate this day Ang Komunidad launched “Week of Peace and Nonviolence”. Public secondary schools of Pasig and San Juan, the local government university Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Pasig and the local Pasig Art Club jointly participated. This was part of the simultaneous global campaign celebrating the International Day of Non-Violence through simultaneous formation of Human Peace Signs by peoples in more than 50 countries.\n\nThis event was followed in 2008 with “5K Run for Peace and Unity”, “Celebration for Peace and Non-Violence”, and World Without Wars Forum.\n\nIn October 2008, upon the invitation of Council 208, two Filipinos attended the European Humanist Forum in Milan. Already then, the Humanist Movement worldwide was starting to gear up for the ambitious plan to launch the World March for Peace and Nonviolence. In between the main program of the forum, spontaneous meetings and coffee break meetings livened up the trip. On the last day, the theme of the forum was \"Beyond Justice... Beyond Revenge\" where well-known Italian personages talked of their experiences with personal tragedy and how it led them to commit to transform their social world through non-violence.\n\nIn 2009, the Humanist Movement launched an international campaign called the World March for Peace and Nonviolence, initiated by Mundo Sin Guerras. It was a tremendous plan for a march to circle the earth proposing the end of wars and nuclear disarmament. The World March international base team, started in New Zealand on Oct, 2, 2009 and passed the Philippines on Oct. 5-7, 2009, to culminate after passing more than 100 countries in Punta de Vacas, Argentina.\n\nNumerous activities were done by World Without Wars Philippines and Ang Komunidad, and the Kapisanan ng Tao Bilang Sentro to promote the World March, ranging from presentations in universities and conferences, direct promotion team formation in schools, networking with peace, inter-faith, arts and culture and ecological non-government organizations, religious institutions, educational institutions, government offices and agencies.\n\nActivities included public marches, presentations in conferences, signature campaigns on nuclear disarmament, the Hiroshima Memorial Dinner with foreign consuls, ambassadors, educators, media; and press conference at Batasan Pambansa.\n\nCoordinated by the World Without Wars Philippines, activities were hyped during their passage to the Philippines on Oct 5-7, 2009. Events included wreath-laying at the Rizal Monument at Luneta, cultural welcome at the Rizal Technological University, parade and march from Manila Bay area to the San Andres Sports Complex with a cultural program, visit to the Batasan Pambansa, Lucena City march and formation of a huge human peace sign by 10,000 students, visit to the Taguig University, support of the unveiling of the Zero Violence Billboard at Isabela City, Basilan.\n\nThe World March marked a new stage, ending the decade of localized action and introduced new dynamics and ways of work that could be carried forward to the next decade. Networking and linkages, both local and international, were developed. Also, the use of media to spread the global consciousness for peace was a significant development.\n\nWith the World March, the call for a new world was launched and was taken up by millions of people from different latitudes and cultures. Time will tell if this signal was strong enough to resonate to the future in the coming decade.\n\nIn January 2010, the Humanist Movement met briefly in Argentina and officially de-structured itself. Existing internal councils functioning within the Humanist Movement were dissolved, allowing the independent development of the five organizations: the Community for Human Development, Convergence of Cultures, Center of Humanist Studies, Humanist Party and World Without Wars.\n\n"}

He enrolled at the Faculty of Letters and Philosophy in Bucharest in autumn 1899, having Titu Maiorescu and Nicolae Iorga as teachers. He proposed his rhymed play \"O sărutare\" to the National Theatre of Bucharest during the same autumn. As I. L. Caragiale commended it, the play was performed on 21st March 1900. (He later became a board member of the National Theatre.) As a member of a student delegation representing the University of Bucharest, Petrovici participated in the commemoration of the 400th anniversary of Stephen the Great's death, which took place in the then Austrian town of Suceava in summer 1904.

According to Stotz, the Modern Evolutionary Synthesis should go beyond the antinomy of biological vs cultural and revise more inclusive theories of gene-culture coevolution and niche construction. Such a revised theory of evolution should take into account genetic, epigenetic (molecular and cellular), behavioral, ecological, socio-cultural and cognitive-symbolic legacies.\nStotz argues that:\n\n“Environments, particularly in the form of developmental environments, do not just select for variation, they also create new variation by inﬂuencing development through the liable transmission of non-genetic but heritable information.”\n\nStotz introduced the concept of Developmental Niche Construction as an integrative framework for the study of various non-genetic (exogenetic) inheritance mechanisms and for an explanation of how the environment (physical, biological or social) can construct new heritable variations during individual development. This concept originated in the idea of the ‘ontogenetic niche’ introduced in 1987 by developmental psychobiologists Meredith West and Andrew King, and theory of 'niche construction' presented by biologist John Odling-Smee in 1988. Stotz juxtaposes Developmental Niche Construction with Niche Constriction Theory and its concept of the ‘Selective Niche’ that stresses the role of selection in evolution rather than the production of new variation in developmental systems. She reconstructs the developmental system of DST as the Organism-Developmental Niche System. It informs the Developmental Systems Account of Human Nature developed together with Paul Griffiths. \n\nAccording to Stotz there is a natural afﬁnity between the theoretical view of the nature of the mind and an understanding of how the mind developed and evolved. “Which kind of evolutionary theory you apply matters deeply to which kind of (evolutionary) psychology you get.”\nFor example, the ideas of nativist’s evolutionary psychologists are often based on the Modern Evolutionary Synthesis which explains the origin of behavioral, social and cognitive capacities by the sudden appearance of genetically determined mental modules or representational systems. \nAs an alternative, Stotz proposes an Extended Evolutionary Psychology based on ideas of an Extended Evolutionary synthesis, Developmental Systems Theory, and embodied, embedded, enacted and extended models of cognition. She states that these approaches are a more appropriate alternative to traditional cognitivism and methodological individualism because they emphasise the importance of external scaffolding of cognition through developmental, ecological, cognitive and cultural niche construction.\n\n"}

The group is not a tribe in the usual sense, since anyone can become a member. It owns several houses and businesses in the city, and critics sometimes view it as a cult or sect, although members do not share a common well-defined religious or spiritual belief system.\n\nThe community was founded in 1974 by then 17-year-old Wolfgang Wankmiller, who still leads it. It strives for independence and self-sufficiency with minimal environmental impact, practices ovo-lacto vegetarianism, and encourages free love while tolerating stable relationships. Separate men's and women's discussion groups meet weekly. Children are raised as a group by several women; some children are schooled privately by members of the tribe in a house across the border in Austria (as home schooling is not possible in Germany).\n\nSeveral of the group's activities are related to esotericism, and a \nself-description states \"our foremost goal is the perception and understanding of reality and its expression in vibrancy\". The group also has its own internal currency and employs a creative approach to language, giving uncommon names to days or to everyday objects. It intends to create a genuine new \"tribe culture\" and is in active contact with other ecological communities around the world.\n\nThe group is hierarchically organized, with members having different \"levels\" reflecting their commitment to the tribe. There is also an outer circle of people who join the group in some of its activities but for the most part live separately.\n\nIn the 1970s the tribe tried to undermine several organizations in Füssen, and Wankmiller was active in local politics for a while. The Likatier are generally regarded with suspicion or even hostility in the city, and a citizen's action group has been formed that opposes the tribe and supports people who want to leave it.\n\nIn 2001, a cook of the group was sentenced to 2 and a half years in prison for sexual abuse of five minor members of the tribe. While the trial judge found that the behavior was neither condoned by nor connected to the group, critics have pointed out that the cook was readmitted to the community after having served his sentence. The German yellow press occasionally reports on the group in a sensationalist manner, labeling Wankmiller as a \"Sex-Guru\", claiming that he believe himself to be a reincarnation of Jesus, and accusing the group of running sex orgies in the presence of minors.\n\nTo counter negative publicity, the group started a website in 2003. It has always welcomed outside visitors, and has recently started to offer \"get-to-know\" seminars.\n\n\n"}

Rougier made many important contributions to epistemology, philosophy of science, political philosophy and the history of Christianity.\n\nRougier was born in Lyon. Debilitated by pleurisy in his youth, he was declared unfit for service in World War I and devoted his adolescence to intellectual pursuits.\n\nAfter receiving the \"agrégation de philosophie\" degree from the University of Lyon, Rougier taught until 1924 at various lycées and obtained his doctorate from the Sorbonne in 1920. His doctoral thesis work was published that year as \"La philosophie géometrique de Poincaré\" and \"Les paralogismes du rationalisme\". Rougier already had several publications to his name, however, beginning with a 1914 paper on the use of non-Euclidean geometry in relativity theory.\n\nRougier taught in Algiers from 1917-20, and then in Rome from 1920 to 1924. His first university appointment in France was at the University of Besançon in 1925, where he served on the faculty until his dismissal in 1948 for political reasons. Further university appointments were in Cairo from 1931–36, the New School for Social Research from 1941–43 and the Université de Montréal in 1945. Rougier's final academic appointment was to the Université de Caen in 1954, but he retired at the age of 66 after only one year there.\n\nRougier lived to the age of 93 and was survived by his third wife, Lucy Friedman. Dr. Friedman, whom he married in 1942, was a former secretary to Moritz Schlick. Although Friedman had a daughter from a previous marriage, Rougier himself had no children.\n\nUnder the influence of Henri Poincaré and Wittgenstein, Rougier developed a philosophy based on the idea that systems of logic are neither apodictic (\"i.e.\", necessarily true and therefore deducible) nor assertoric (\"i.e.\", not necessarily true and whose truth must therefore be induced through empirical investigation.) Instead, Rougier proposed that the various systems of logic are simply conventions that are adopted based on contingent circumstances.\n\nThis view, which implies that there are no \"objective,\" \"a priori\" truths that exist independently of the human mind, closely resembled the logical positivism of the Vienna Circle. Many members of this group, including Philipp Frank, greatly admired Rougier's 1920 work \"Les paralogismes du rationalisme.\" Rougier soon became the group's only French associate and formed close personal ties to several of its leading members, including Moritz Schlick (to whom Rougier's 1955 book \"Traité de la connaissance\" is dedicated) and Hans Reichenbach. Rougier also participated as an organizer and contributor to many Vienna Circle activities, including the International Encyclopedia of Unified Science. Rougier's own contribution to the \"Encyclopedia\" never materialized, however, because he soon became one of many participants who ended up quarreling with Otto Neurath, the project's editor-in-chief.\n\nRougier's conventionalist philosophical position naturally led him to oppose Neo-Thomism, which had been the official philosophy of the Roman Catholic Church since the 1879 encyclical \"Aeterna Patris\" but was gaining particular momentum during the 1920s and 1930s. Rougier published several works during this period attacking this contemporary revival of scholasticism, thereby earning the personal enmity of prominent Thomists such as Étienne Gilson and Jacques Maritain.\n\nRougier's objections to Neo-Thomism were not merely philosophical, however, but formed part of a general opposition to Christianity that he had already begun to develop during his adolescence under the influence of Ernest Renan. This early opposition to Christianity continued to influence intellectual work of Rougier's maturity, leading him in 1926 to publish a translation of Celsus that is still in use today.\n\nRougier was also a political philosopher in the liberal tradition of Montesquieu, Constant, Guizot, and Tocqueville. Consistent with his conventionalist epistemology, Rougier believed that political power rests not upon eternally valid claims, but upon conventions that he called \"mystiques\". The only possible reason to prefer one political system over another, he believed, depends not on eternal truths but on purely pragmatic grounds. In other words, political systems should be chosen not based on how \"true\" they are, but rather on how well they work.\n\nAfter visiting the Soviet Union in 1932 on a visit sponsored by France's Ministry of Education, Rougier became convinced that planned economies do not work as well as market economies. This conviction led him to participate in the organization of the first neoliberal organization of the twentieth century, the \"Colloque Walter Lippmann\", in 1938. During the same year, Rougier helped to found the \"Centre international d'études pour la rénovation du libéralisme\". The political network established by these two groups eventually led to the 1947 foundation of the famous Mont Pelerin Society, to which Rougier was elected in the 1960s through the personal backing of Friedrich von Hayek.\n\nRougier, as one of the founding fathers of neoliberalism, would no doubt have been admitted to the first meeting of the Mont Pelerin Society had it not been for a second political engagement that proved disastrous to his career and reputation: his activities on behalf of the Vichy regime in France during World War II. In October 1940, Philippe Pétain sent Rougier on a secret mission to the British government in London, where he met with Winston Churchill between 21-25 October. \n\nRougier later claimed in several published works that these meetings resulted in an agreement between Vichy and Churchill that he called the \" \"Mission secrète à Londres : les Accords Pétain-Churchill \"\", an allegation that the British government later denied in an official White Paper. Although these activities and publications eventually led to Rougier's dismissal in 1948 from his teaching position at the University of Besançon, Rougier continued to be active throughout the 1950s in organizations that defended Pétain. He also published works denouncing the \"épuration\" (the French equivalent of denazification that was carried out on formerly Vichy territory by the Allies after the war) as illegal and totalitarian. Finally, Rougier was active in an effort that petitioned the United Nations in 1951, alleging that the Allies had committed human rights violations and war crimes during the \"Libération\".\n\nDuring the 1970s, Rougier formed a second controversial political alliance: with the Nouvelle Droite of the French writer Alain de Benoist. Rougier's long-standing opposition to Christianity, together with his conviction that \"the West\" possesses a pragmatically superior \"mentalité\" to those of other cultures, aligned closely with the views of this movement. Benoist reissued and wrote prefaces to several of Rougier's earlier works, and in 1974 Benoist's think tank GRECE published an entirely new book by Rougier: \"Le conflit du Christianisme primitif et de la civilisation antique\".\n\n\n"}

Not to be confused with modern Stoicism, a similar movement in the early 21st century.\n\nNeostoicism was founded by Flemish humanist Justus Lipsius (1547 – 1606), who in 1584 presented its rules, expounded in his book \"De constantia\" (\"On Constancy\"), as a dialogue between Lipsius and his friend Charles de Langhe. In the dialogue, Lipsius and de Langhe explore aspects of contemporary political predicaments, by reference to the classical Greek and pagan Stoicism, in particular as found in the Latin writings of Seneca. He further developed Neostoicism in his treatises \"Manuductionis ad stoicam philosophiam\" (\"Introduction to the Stoic Philosophy\") and \"Physiologia stoicorum\" (\"Physics of the Stoics\"), both published in 1604.\n\nNeostoicism is a practical philosophy which holds that the basic rule of good life is that the human should not yield to the passions, but submit to God. Neostoicism recognizes four passions: greed, joy, fear and sorrow. Although the human has the free will, everything that happens (even if it is wrong because of the human) is under control of God and finally it tends to the good. The human who complies with this rule is free, because he is not overcome by the instincts. He is also calm, because all the material pleasures and sufferings are irrelevant for him. Finally, he is really, spiritually happy, because he lives close to God.\n\nNeostoicism had a direct influence on many seventeenth and eighteenth-century writers including Montesquieu, Bossuet, Francis Bacon, Joseph Hall, Francisco de Quevedo and Juan de Vera y Figueroa. The work of Guillaume du Vair, \"Traité de la Constance\" (1594), was another important influence in the Neostoicism movement, but while Lipsius based his Stoicism on the writings of Seneca, du Vair emphasised the Stoic thought of Epictetus. The painter Peter Paul Rubens was a disciple and friend of Lipsius, and there is a painting made by Rubens, now in the Pitti Palace showing Rubens standing next to Lipsius as he teaches two students who are seated in front of him.\n\n\n\n"}

It was popularised by Willard Van Orman Quine in \"Word and Object\" (1960).\n\nNeurath used the simile in several occasions, the first being in Neurath's text \"Problems in War Economics\".\n\nStanovich, in his book \"The Robot's Rebellion\", refers to it as a Neurathian bootstrap and uses it as an analogy to the recursive nature of revising one's beliefs. A \"rotten plank\" on the ship, for instance, might refer to a meme virus or a junk meme (i.e., a meme that is either maladaptive to the individual, or serves no beneficial purpose for the realization of an individual's life goals).

He taught for many decades various metaphysical and philosophical subjects. He wrote also many practical and philosophical books.\n\nNikolaos Margioris was born in the island of Samos on 15 December 1913. He moved to Alexandria, Egypt at a very young age. He fought in World War Two and in the Greek Civil War. He fought in World War II as a reserve officer, where he was seriously injured in El Alamein and in Rimini. For his services to the country he was honored with many medals (it is worth mentioning the Grand Cross) as well as with the veteran’s disability pension. Later, he was in Tibet and India for his training for almost one decade. He returned in Alexandria afterwards, where he started teaching to sophisticated people of the region. He left Egypt in 1958 with his family, and moved to Athens, Greece.\nHe created many philosophical schools called Omakoio (Ομακοείο), in many different Greek cities.\n\nHe wrote 33 books.\n\nHe died on 6 May 1993.\n\nNikolaos Margioris belongs also to the \"100 Great Greeks\" as he greatly contributed to the formation, presentation and popularization of current Greek metaphysical philosophy based on the comparative analysis of the most popular international philosophical views in this area with the corresponding Greek views.\n\nNikolaos Margioris was a uniquely gifted modern esoteric experiential personality, of multiple talents and of unprecedented dynamism and productivity, who noiselessly passed the threshold of his country, delivered the quintessence of integrated spiritual experiences that summarizes the interaction of a metaphysical worldview in the oriental cultures and the ancient Greek, Hellenistic and Christian Orthodox view of life and death.\n\nNikolaos Margioris considered metaphysics as the only truth, believing that it is possible for the man to realize the truth.\n\nIn his writings he deals with issues such as arithmosofia, considered pseudomathematics or pseudoscience by scientists.\n\nBooks such as \"Dravidians, the Pre-hellenic Greeks\" belong to the movement of Neopythagoreanism. He describes myths as reaity, like the war of the Atlanteans against Dravidians, which he places chronologically around 16,000 years BC, a time where is no documentation.\n\nAfter 23 years of metaphysical publications (1970–1993), he wrote 33 books of clearly Esoteric subject-matter, with an incredible and unprecedented metaphysical analysis which led to increasing popularity for those who know the subject. He also wrote multiple essays on various Esoteric matters. He circulated the metaphysical journal \"OMAKOIO\". He created a field of studies through correspondence courses under the name Esoteric Key. In this field, the students received instruction characterized by a deep, theoretical and practical Esoteric analysis, in many different courses.\n\nEvery three months, he held seminars in Shiatsu lasting for many days in which he himself not only taught Shiatsu but a lot of other Esoteric therapeutic systems among which were also his own discoveries.\n\nApart from teaching therapeutic systems, he himself applied therapies. Also, his students who had been instructed in these techniques applied these therapies. Meanwhile, a school of Kriya Yoga was established, bringin Kriya Yoga in Greece for the first time.\n\nHe himself taught the pure and complete Raja Yoga, as well as many other yoga systems like Mantram, Karma, Gnani-a, Bakti-a, Kundalini.\n\nHe also started teaching in Greece the mysticism of Christianity, and the Christocentral mysticism.\n\nAll his lectures and didactic activities took place in his seat, in his Spiritual Laboratory, which, from its establishment in 1976, he called the Omakoio of Athens in memory of the Omakoio which Pythagoras first established in Croton of South Italy.\n\nIn 1972, he established the Association The Pious Pilgrims, where he tirelessly held free lectures on various Esoteric subjects.\n\n"}

{"id": "2685048", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2685048", "title": "Peacemaking", "text": "Peacemaking\n\nPeacemaking is practical conflict transformation focused upon establishing equitable power relationships robust enough to forestall future conflict, often including the establishment of means of agreeing on ethical decisions within a community, or among parties, that had previously engaged in inappropriate (i.e. violent) responses to conflict. Peacemaking seeks to achieve full reconciliation among adversaries and new mutual understanding among parties and stakeholders. When applied in criminal justice matters, peacemaking is usually called restorative justice, but sometimes also transformative justice, a term coined by the late Canadian justice theorist and activist Ruth Morris. One popular example of peacemaking is the several types of mediation, usually between two parties and involving a third, a facilitator or mediator.\n\nSome geopolitical entities, such as nation-states and international organizations, attempt to relegate the term peacemaking to large, systemic, often factional conflicts in which no member of the community can avoid involvement, and in which no faction or segment can claim to be completely innocent of the problems, citing as instances post-genocide situations, or extreme situations of oppression such as apartheid. However peacemaking is a universal and age-old approach to conflict at all levels and among any and all parties, and its principles may be generalized and used in many different kinds of conflicts.\nIn contemporary international affairs, especially after the end of the Cold War, the concept of peacemaking has often been associated to the imposition upon warring parties of a peace settlement, usually under the auspices of an international organization.\nPeacemaking in smaller, traditional societies has often involved rituals. For example, Alula Pankhurst has produced films about peacemaking among Ethiopian communities.\n\nThe process of peacemaking is distinct from the rationale of pacifism or the use of non-violent protest or civil disobedience techniques, though they are often practiced by the same people. Indeed, those who master using nonviolent techniques under extreme violent pressure, and those who lead others in such resistance, have usually demonstrated the capacity not to react to violent provocation in kind, and thus may be more highly skilled at working with groups of people that may have suffered through violence and oppression, keeping them coordinated and in good order through the necessary, often difficult phases of rapprochement.\nGiven that, and a track record of not advocating violent responses, it is these leaders who are usually most qualified for peacemaking when future conflict breaks out between the previously warring sides.\n\nMohandas Karamchand Gandhi is widely recognized as an important theorist of peacemaking strategies. He noted in particular that leaders who had been successful at violent strategies were counter-productive in peace time, simply because these strategies now had to be abandoned. But if a movement had adulated and emulated these people, it was unlikely ever to be able to make permanent peace even with those factions it had conquered or dominated, simply because the leaders lacked the skills and had become leaders in part for their suppression of the other side. Accordingly, even if a movement were to benefit from violent action, and even if such action was extremely effective in ending some other oppression, no movement that sought long-term peace could safely hold up these acts or persons as a moral example or advise emulating either. Gandhi's views have influenced modern ethicists in forming a critique of terrorism, in which even those who support the goals must decry the methods and avoid making, for instance, a suicide bomber into a hero.\n\nThe Catholic Church has changed its view on peacemaking over the centuries. Some early Christians refused to join Rome’s Imperial army. A doctrine of a Just War theory originated with St. Augustine of Hippo in the 5th century. Versions of Just War doctrines have claimed that countries and people should keep peace at all cost. The right of a ruler to go to war must meet the criteria of just cause, comparative justice, competent authority, right intention, probability of success, last resort, and proportionality. The Colombian conflict is the present day, prime Catholic example.\n\nThe tradition of Christianity continues to be taken up by those who seek peace. Jesus taught, \"[...] all who take the sword will perish by the sword.\" (Matthew 26:52, NAB) Twenty years after the cessation of the Reichskonkordat\",\" Pope Paul VI proclaimed “No more war, war never again!” (Address to United Nations General Assembly, October 4, 1965 retweeted by Pope Francis Sept.2, 2013) Christians teach that a great (false) peace will soon be made.\n\n\n\n"}

He was born in the Italian town from which he takes his name, now Abano Terme. He gained fame by writing \"Conciliator Differentiarum, quæ inter Philosophos et Medicos Versantur\". He was eventually accused of heresy and atheism, and came before the Inquisition. He died in prison in 1315 (some sources say 1316) before the end of his trial.\n\nHe lived in Greece for a period of time before he moved and commenced his studies for a long time at Constantinople (between 1270 and 1290). Around 1300 he moved to Paris, where he was promoted to the degrees of doctor in philosophy and medicine, in the practice of which he was very successful, but his fees were remarkably high. In Paris he became known as \"the Great Lombard\". He settled at Padua, where he gained a reputation as a physician. Also an astrologer, he was charged with practising magic: the specific accusations being that he got back, by the aid of the devil, all the money he paid away, and that he possessed the philosopher's stone.\n\nGabriel Naude, in his \"Antiquitate Scholæ Medicæ Parisiensis\", gives the following account of him:\n\nHe carried his enquiries so far into the occult sciences of abstruse and hidden nature, that, after having given most ample proofs, by his writings concerning physiognomy, geomancy, and chiromancy, he moved on to the study of philosophy, physics, and astrology; which studies proved so advantageous to him, that, not to speak of the two first, which introduced him to all the popes of his time, and acquired him a reputation among learned men, it is certain that he was a great master in the latter, which appears not only by the astronomical figures he had painted in the great hall of the palace at Padua, and the translations he made of the books of the most learned rabbi Abraham Aben Ezra, added to those he himself composed on critical days, and the improvement of astronomy, but by the testimony of the renowned mathematician Regiomontanus, who made a fine panegyric on him, in quality of an astrologer, in the oration he delivered publicly at Padua when he explained there the book of \"Alfraganus\".\n\nIn his writings he expounds and advocates the medical and philosophical systems of Averroes, Avicenna, and other Islamic writers. His best known works are the \"Conciliator differentiarum quae inter philosophos et medicos versantur\" and \"De venenis eorumque remediis\", both of which are extant in dozens of manuscripts and various printed editions from the late fifteenth through sixteenth centuries. The former was an attempt to reconcile apparent contradictions between medical theory and Aristotelian natural philosophy, and was considered authoritative as late as the sixteenth century.\n\nIt has been alleged that Abano also wrote a grimoire called the \"Heptameron\", a concise book of ritual magical rites concerned with conjuring specific angels for the seven days of the week (hence the title). It should not be confused with the \"Heptaméron\" of Marguerite of Navarre. He is also credited with writing \"De venenis eorumque remediis\", which expounded on Arab theories concerning superstitions, poisons and contagions.\n\nHe was twice brought to trial by the Inquisition; on the first occasion he was acquitted, and he died before the second trial was completed. He was found guilty, however, and his body was ordered to be exhumed and burned; but a friend had secretly removed it, and the Inquisition had therefore to content itself with the public proclamation of its sentence and the burning of Abano in effigy.\n\nAccording to Naude:\n\nBarrett (p. 157) refers to the opinion that it was not on the score of magic that the Inquisition sentenced Pietro to death, but because he endeavoured to account for the wonderful effects in nature by the influences of the celestial bodies, not attributing them to angels or demons; so that heresy, rather than magic, in the form of opposition to the doctrine of spiritual beings, seems to have led to his persecution.

{"id": "43104559", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43104559", "title": "Postinternet", "text": "Postinternet\n\nPostinternet denotes an idea in arts and criticism that refers to society and modes of interaction following the widespread adoption of the internet. The term emerged from discussions about Internet Art by Marisa Olson, Gene McHugh, and Artie Vierkant. Guthrie Lonergan and Cory Arcangel have mentioned it as a term for being \"internet aware\", which some believe to be more accurate. Generally it is described as art that is about the internet's effects on aesthetics, culture and society.\n\nCritics of the term claim that it falsely implies that there is a kind of art made after the internet has ceased to exist (and artists such as Rafael Rozendaal have criticized the ambiguity of \"post-\" in this instance).\n\nThe idea of art post-internet was born in the wake of Internet Art, which gained significant traction in the early- to mid-2000s. Much like Internet Art, the postinternet art movement has roots in Dada, Fluxus, and exploration of net culture in general. Unlike Internet Art, postinternet art is less heavily influenced, at least in form, by telematic art, being more concerned in commenting on communications technology (the internet) than in being medium-native to the internet.\n\nWorks created within the postinternet paradigm often shares the aesthetics of the Internet Art, net.art and DataDada Art. It differs in that it does not use the internet only as a tool to produce art, but addresses the internet as a force that has altered social structures in both digital and physical spaces. Postinternet art is not necessarily art produced on the internet, but art that reflects the internet and the internet's effects on culture and society.\n\nPostinternet art has gained some attention because of Petra Cortright's work, \"BRIDAL SHOWER\" and notably also Katja Novitskova's work, \"Post Internet Survival Guide\". Postinternet art by Harm van den Dorpel has been covered on the Creators Project. In 2014, LaBeouf, Rönkkö & Turner described their collaborative practice as \"partly a response to how post-internet artists were using social media to promote their work and how that promotion became the work.\"\n\nSome critics have also applied the ideas of postinternet art in discussions of the use of the internet by some contemporary British and American poets, for instance Steve Roggenbuck, Sam Riviere and Steven Zultanski. Encompassing work otherwise frequently grouped under Alt lit, flarf or conceptual poetry, postinternet poetry articulates the ubiquity of the experience of internet and social media usage among poets, similar to the ideas in visual art described above, such that the internet touches all elements of a poem's composition and distribution without necessarily being an explicit focus of the work itself. As the conceptual poet Kenneth Goldsmith remarks in \"The New Yorker\", a postinternet poem \"seems to view the Internet with a shrug\".\n\nPostinternet art has been criticized as being art \"about\" the internet, rather than art \"of\" the internet, in the manner of Net Art. In doing so, postinternet art loses many of the structural benefits of Net Art, namely that postinternet art exists through the institution of physical galleries. While Net Art sought to redefine a space for its work, postinternet art is more rooted in an older, traditional notion of the role of art. The crisis of postinternet art is often characterized as a question of how the inherently intangible and democratized work resulting from internet content-creation paradigms can be monetized, and in this sense postinternet art is sometimes negatively described as the image of network-native art repackaged for the gallery or for sale.\n\nOn the contrary, it has also been proposed that postinternet is more like a condition for art making and critical thinking. Since the internet is no longer an option but a necessity in our society, one must also be critically aware of the internet's impact on society when making art. This is also clearly stated by Marisa Olson in an interview with \"\"we make money not art\"-\" blogger Regine Debatty;\n\n\"\"There doesn't seem to be a need to distinguish, any more, whether technology was used in making the work - after all, everything is a technology, and everyone uses technology to do everything. What is even more interesting is the way in which people are starting to make what I've called \"post-internet\" art in my own work (such as my\" Monitor Tracings\"), or what Guthrie Lonergan recently called \"Internet Aware Art\". I think it's important to address the impacts of the internet on culture at large, and this can be done well on networks but can and should also exist offline. Of course, it's an exciting challenge to explain to someone how this is still internet art... If that really matters\".\"\n\nFurthermore, it has been proposed by Stefan Heidenreich in discussions with students at \"The Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts\" during his lecture, \"Networks and Objects: On Postinternet, Speculative Realism, Media- or Network Theory and related artistic practises,\" that the strength of the postinternet term comes from it being undefinable or at least very difficult to define.\n\nArtist Paul Kneale discusses post internet in an interview with i-D. In the interview entitled 'Canadian Artist Paul Kneale Says Post Internet is Dead', Kneale rephrases the term calling it 'Post-Art Internet.' He uses this to highlight that categorising art in terms of the period it belongs to has lost its validity in the new age of internet. He states: \n\n″The thing we call 'art' is a historical period, like ancient art — it has a vague beginning point that makes it a period, and also an end, which is usually marked by a major changes in other areas of life. Quite possibly we've just witnessed this end. The thing that we call 'Internet' is a whole way of being in the world. It's the Internet you know from your browser window, but also the Internet of things and materials, and also the internet of minds, of tastes and feelings. After this passing historical period 'Art', you have this new period 'Internet'. So it makes sense to ask, what does that change mean for aesthetics? How do we present and represent in this new period?″\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It developed out of the Liberal Christianity of the modern-era, which was rooted in enlightenment thinking. \n\nProgressive Christianity is characterized by a willingness to question tradition, acceptance of human diversity, a strong emphasis on social justice and care for the poor and the oppressed, and environmental stewardship of the earth. Progressive Christians have a deep belief in the centrality of the instruction to \"love one another\" (John 15:17) within the teachings of Jesus Christ. This leads to a focus on promoting values such as compassion, justice, mercy, and tolerance, often through political activism. Though prominent, the movement is by no means the only significant movement of progressive thought among Christians.\n\nProgressive Christianity draws on the insights of multiple theological streams including evangelicalism, liberalism, neo-orthodoxy, pragmatism, postmodernism, Progressive Reconstructionism, and liberation theology. Though the terms Progressive Christianity and Liberal Christianity are often used synonymously, the two movements are distinct, despite much overlap.\n\nA priority of justice and care for the down-trodden are a recurrent theme in the Hebrew prophetic tradition inherited by Christianity. This has been reflected in many later Christian traditions of service and ministry, and more recently in the United States of America through Christian involvement in political trends such as the Progressive Movement and the Social Gospel.\n\nThroughout the 20th century, a strand of progressive or liberal Christian thought outlined the values of a 'good society'. It stresses fairness, justice, responsibility, and compassion, and condemns the forms of governance that wage unjust war, rely on corruption for continued power, deprive the poor of facilities, or exclude particular racial or sexual groups from fair participation in national liberties. It was influential in the US mainline churches, and reflected global trends in student activism. It contributed to the ecumenical movement, as represented internationally by the World Student Christian Federation and the World Council of Churches internationally, and at the national level through groups such as the National Council of Churches in the USA and Australian Student Christian Movement.\n\nThe ascendancy of Evangelicalism in the US, particularly in its more socially conservative forms, challenged many people in mainline churches. Recently, a focus for those who wish to challenge this ascendancy has been provided by Jim Wallis of \"Sojourners\", who described himself as a progressive evangelical Christian, although Sojourners has rejected advertisements urging mainline churches to welcome gay members. This has enabled many Christians who are uncomfortable with conservative evangelicalism to identify themselves explicitly as \"Progressive Christians.\" At the onset of this new movement to organize Progressive Christians, the single largest force holding together was a webring, \"The Progressive Christian Bloggers Network\", and supporters frequently find and contact each other through dozens of online chat-rooms.\n\nNotable initiatives within the movement for progressive Christianity include The Center for Progressive Christianity (TCPC) in Cambridge, MA, The Beatitudes Society, the campaigning organization CrossLeft, the technology working group Social Redemption and The Progressive Episcopal Church (TPEC).\n\nCrossLeft joined with Every Voice Network and Claiming the Blessing in October 2005 to stage a major conference, Path to Action, at the National Cathedral in Washington, DC. Among the speakers were E. J. Dionne, Richard Parker, Jim Wallis, Senator Danforth, and David Hollinger.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the movement is represented by the Progressive Christianity Network Britain. Notable related UK organisations include the Center for Radical Christianity at St Marks, Sheffield, and the UK-based Sea of Faith network.\n\nExamples of statements of contemporary Progressive Christian beliefs include:\n\nAccording to Archbishop Wynn Wagner of the Old Catholic Church, holding to the ideals of progressive Christianity sets the movement apart from traditional Christianity. Inclusiveness and acceptance is the basic posture of progressive Christianity.\n\nWithin the Seventh-day Adventist Church, the liberal wing describe themselves as \"progressive Adventists\". They disagree with some of the traditional teachings of the church. While most are still of evangelical persuasion, a minority are liberal Christians.\n\nAs Bruce Sanguin writes, \"It's time for the Christian church to get with a cosmological program (...). We now know, for instance, that we live in an evolving or evolutionary universe. Evolution is the way that the Holy creates in space and in time, in every sphere: material, biological, social, cultural, psychological, and spiritual. This new cosmology simply cannot be contained by old models and images of God, or by old ways of being the church.\".\n\nCentral to this recovery of awe in the cosmos is the epic of evolution, the 14-billion-year history of the universe. Scientists (Edward O. Wilson, Brian Swimme, Eric Chaisson, Ursula Goodenough and others) initiated this story which has been perpetuated with a religion component by some liberal theologians (Gordon D. Kaufman, Jerome A. Stone, Michael Dowd, etc.).\n\nEvolutionary evangelist and progressive minister Michael Dowd uses the term Epic of Evolution or Great Story to help construct his viewpoint of evolution theology. His position is that science and religious faith are not mutually exclusive (a form of religious naturalism). He preaches that the epic of cosmic, biological, and human evolution, revealed by science, is a basis for an inspiring and meaningful view of our place in the universe and a new approach to religion. Evolution is viewed as a religious spiritual process that is not meaningless blind chance.\n\nGeoff Thompson argues that the rhetoric of Progressive Christianity, as represented by Gretta Vosper and John Shelby Spong, \"often over-reaches its arguments.\" In particular, he concludes that \"[i]t is very difficult to see how what [Vosper] proposes needs any church or even the minimalist, idiosyncratic definition of Christianity which she offers.\n\n"}

Basic semantic properties include being \"meaningful\" or \"meaningless\" – for example, whether a given word is part of a language's lexicon with a generally understood meaning; \"polysemy\", having multiple, typically related, meanings; \"ambiguity\", having meanings which aren't necessarily related ; and \"anomaly\", where the elements of a unit are semantically incompatible with each other, although possibly grammatically sound. Beyond the expression itself, there are higher-level semantic relations that describe the relationship between units: these include synonymy, antonymy, and hyponymy.\n\nBesides basic properties of semantics, semantic property is also sometimes used to describe the semantic components of a word, such as \"man\" assuming that the referent is \"human\", \"male\", and \"adult\", or \"female\" being a common component of \"girl\", \"woman\", and \"actress\". In this sense, semantic properties are used to define the semantic field of a word or set of words.\n\nSemantic properties of nouns/entities can be divided into eight classes: specificity, boundedness, animacy, gender, kinship, social status, physical properties, and function.\n\nPhysical properties refer to how an entity exists in space. It can include shape, size, and material, for example.\n\nThe function class of semantic properties refers to noun class markers that indicate the purpose of an entity or how humans utilize an entity. \nFor example, in the Dyirbal language, the morpheme \"balam\" marks each entity in its noun class with the semantic property of edibility, and Burmese encodes the semantic property for the ability to cut or pierce. Encoding the functional property for transportation, housing, and speech are also attested in world languages.\n\n"}
{"id": "44839504", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44839504", "title": "Syntheism", "text": "Syntheism\n\nSyntheism is a new religious movement focused on how atheists and pantheists can achieve the same feelings of community and awe experienced in traditional theistic religions. The Syntheist Movement sees itself as the practical realisation of a philosophical ambition for a new religion dating back as far as Baruch Spinoza's pantheism in the 17th century and, most directly, British-American philosopher Alfred North Whitehead's pioneering work towards a process theology in his books \"Religion in the Making\" in 1926 and \"Process and Reality\" in 1929.\n\nSyntheism may also be viewed as a response to the lack of atheistic and pantheistic belief systems in Western cultures, while being more abundant in Eastern cultures, for example as Zen Buddhism, Dzogchen Buddhism, Advaita Vedanta Hinduism, Zoroastrianism and Jainism.\n\nSyntheism comes from the Greek \"syntheos\" (from syn- for \"with\" or \"creating with\" and -theos for \"god\"). It implies that the proper approach to the concept of God is that humanity has created, creates or will eventually create God – as opposed to the traditional monotheistic view that God created the world and humanity.\n\nBesides the activism of The Syntheist Movement, a syntheistic approach to philosophy and religion has also been advocated by American philosopher Ray Kurzweil in his concept of the forthcoming Singularity. It is also supported by French philosopher Quentin Meillassoux in his idea of \"God is a concept far too important to leave to the religious\" in his book \"After Finitude\".\n\nSyntheism has an international Facebook community with over 1,500 members. Its website hosts a blog, holy festival information, and links to media and other resources. A Swedish community of over 700 members has held several local events.\n\nSpiritual naturalism is considered to be an American version of Syntheism.\n\nAs early as 1982, Mikhail Epstein, Russian–American critical thinker, produced his \"Manifesto of Minimal Religion\" claiming that post–atheistic spirituality in the Soviet Union moves beyond all differences among traditional religions and establishes a new type of spirituality, principally non–dogmatic and unorganized, aspiring for the God in the future rather than in the past tense. \n\nAmerican theoretical biologist and complexity theorist Stuart Kauffman published a syntheist manifesto called \"Reinventing The Sacred\" in 2010. In it, he calls for an emergentism beyond traditional scientific reductionism towards a new syntheist spirituality. American philosopher and neuroscientist Sam Harris published \"\" in 2014. In this book, Harris promotes a syntheistic, post-atheist spirituality beyond traditional religion, especially beyond the Abrahamic faiths, inspired by Buddhism and the Indian philosophical school of Advaita Vedanta. Harris advocates the search for a love and happiness that transcends cause and effect - which he claims to have found in deep meditation and during psychedelic experiences - while entirely set within a monist and immanent universe. Both Kauffman and Harris are widely quoted as inspirations for the foundation of The Syntheist Movement.\n\nAmerican philosopher and theologian Robert Corrington has advocated a syntheistic approach he refers to as \"ecstatic naturalism\" to religion and spirituality in a series of books, including \"Nature's Sublime: An Essay in Aesthetic Naturalism\", \"Nature and Spirit: An Essay in Ecstatic Naturalism\" and \"A Semiotic Theory of Theology and Philosophy\". British political philosopher Simon Critchley calls for syntheist subtraction (a position he refers to as \"mystical anarchism\") as the proper response to the call for a revolutionary radicality in his book \"The Faith of The Faithless: Experiments in Political Theology\". \n\nWhen Swedish cyberphilosophers Alexander Bard and Jan Söderqvist published their syntheist manifesto \"Syntheism - Creating God in the Internet Age\" in October 2014, it became the first book to actively use the term Syntheism in its title. Bard & Söderqvist frequently quote Kauffman, Harris, Corrington and Critchley in the book, but also find inspiration for a syntheist worldview from a variety of contemporary phenomena such as digitalisation, globalisation, participatory culture, psychedelic practices, quantum physics and the science of cosmology.\n\nSwiss-British philosopher Alain de Botton has advocated a syntheistic approach towards an atheist religion both in his book \"Religion for Atheists\" and his TED talk \"Atheism 2.0\". American philosopher Daniel Colucciello Barber explores the potential for a syntheistic, post-secular spirituality of immanence rather than transcendence, inspired by French philosopher Gilles Deleuze, in his book \"Deleuze and the Naming of God\". Among the most quoted inspirations for Syntheism are the writings on a future \"atheology\" by French surrealist philosopher Georges Bataille in the 1950s.\n\nSyntheism is the belief that the classic division between theism and atheism in theology has become redundant and must be overcome to fulfill contemporary and future spiritual needs. This requires the acknowledgement that all metaphysical beliefs center on a divinity or focal point which is man-made. Therefore, all current and future religious beliefs are created by humans, as well as systems such as Individualism developed by philosophers like René Descartes and Immanuel Kant).\n\nDespite being human creations, what is important is that these beliefs strengthen, and not contradict, science. They must therefore be developed within a monist worldview (the conviction that there is one world and one world only, and that everything within this one world can affect everything else). In a more poetic vein, Bataille describes his atheology as “the art of non-knowledge”. He rather advocates a syntheist religion without a core set of beliefs. Participatory festivals with utopian themes such as Burning Man are considered examples of syntheistic practice.\n\nLack of central leadership and core beliefs have led some scholars, such as Dr. Stephen O'Leary, to believe Syntheism will fail. The idea has also been criticised for a potential lack of mystery.\n"}

Zimmer (1953, p. 182) uses the term to describe the position of the Tirthankaras having passed \"beyond the godly governors of the natural order\".\n\nThe term has more recently also been applied to Buddhism, Advaita Vedanta and the Bhakti movement.\n\nNathan Katz in \"Buddhist and Western Philosophy\" (1981, p. 446) points out that the term \"transpolytheistic\" would be more accurate, since it entails that the polytheistic gods are not denied or rejected even after the development of a notion of the Absolute that transcends them, but criticizes the classification as characterizing the mainstream by the periphery: \"like categorizing Roman Catholicism as a good example of non-Nestorianism\". The term is indeed informed by the fact that the corresponding development in the West, the development of monotheism, did not \"transcend\" polytheism, but abolish it, while in the mainstream of the Indian religions, the notion of \"gods\" (deva) was never elevated to the status of \"God\" or Ishvara, or the impersonal Absolute Brahman, but adopted roles comparable to Western angels. \"Transtheism\", according to the criticism of Katz, is then an artifact of comparative religion.\n\nPaul Tillich uses \"transtheistic\" in \"The Courage to Be\" (1952), as an aspect of Stoicism. Tillich stated that Stoicism and Neo-Stoicism\nare the way in which some of the noblest figures in later antiquity and their followers in modern times have answered the problem of existence and conquered the anxieties of fate and death. Stoicism in this sense is a basic religious attitude, whether it appears in theistic, atheistic, or transtheistic forms.\n\nLike Zimmer trying to express a religious notion that is neither theistic nor atheistic. However, the theism that is being transcended in Stoicism according to Tillich is not polytheism as in Jainism, but monotheism, pursuing an ideal of human courage which has emancipated itself from God.\nThe courage to take meaninglessness into itself presupposes a relation to the ground of being which we have called \"absolute faith.\" It is without a special content, yet it is not without content. The content of absolute faith is the \"god above God.\" Absolute faith and its consequence, the courage that takes the radical doubt, the doubt about God, into itself, transcends the theistic idea of God.\nMartin Buber criticized Tillich's \"transtheistic position\" as a reduction of God to the impersonal \"necessary being\" of Thomas Aquinas.\n\nFollowing the term coined by the philosophers Tillich and Zimmer, Buddhism can be regarded as a transtheistic religion. This can be evident by the transcendence of the state of Nibbana (Nirvana) that surpasses all the realms of existence, including the planes of devas and brahmas who are considered gods in Buddhist cosmology. The historical Buddha made it clear that the path to enlightenment does not depend on a god or gods. Although there is acknowledgment of a multitude of gods in the oldest Buddhist scriptures, there is also reference to Maha Brahma, who considered himself to be the all-powerful all-creator god, only to be critiqued by the Buddha as having wrongly perceived his plane of existence as the highest.\n\n\n"}

He was a member of the University of Michigan's department of philosophy for 41 years (1937–1978), and chair of the department for 14 years (1947–1961).\n\nFrankena's father and mother immigrated to the U.S. as teenagers, in 1892 and 1896 respectively, from Friesland, a province in the north of the Netherlands. William Frankena was the middle of three children. He was born in Manhattan, Montana, grew up in small Dutch communities in Montana and western Michigan, and spoke West Frisian and Dutch. In primary school, his given name, Wiebe, was Anglicized to William. Throughout his life, his family and friends called him Bill. His mother died when he was nine years old. He graduated from Holland Christian High School in Holland, MI, in 1926. After farming, his father, Nicholas A. Frankena (1875–1955), devoted the later decades of his life to elected office in Zeeland, MI, where he was mayor, and to service as an elder in the Christian Reformed Church in North America, which was founded by Calvinist Dutch immigrants.\n\nIn 1930, Frankena received a B.A. with majors in English and philosophy from Calvin College, a liberal arts college of the Christian Reformed Church. At Calvin, Frankena studied with William Harry Jellema (1893–1982). Frankena then earned an M.A. from the University of Michigan (1931), where the Department of Philosophy included C. Harold Langford(1895–1964), Dewitt H. Parker (1885–1949), and Roy Wood Sellars (1880–1973). Next Frankena earned a second M.A. and a Ph.D. (1937) at Harvard University. He studied with C. I. Lewis, Ralph Barton Perry, and Alfred North Whitehead at Harvard, and with G. E. Moore and C. D. Broad at the University of Cambridge in England while he did Ph.D. research. His doctoral dissertation, which focused on Moore's work, was entitled \"Recent Intuitionism in British Ethics.\" Frankena became well known in the profession with his first published paper, \"The Naturalistic Fallacy,\" \"Mind\", 1939. During World War II, Frankena taught American history at the University of Michigan.\n\nFrankena met his future wife, Sadie, when they were students at Calvin College. In 1928–29, Sadie was president of Calvin's forensic (oration and debate) club and editor-in-chief of Calvin's literary review, \"Chimes\"; Frankena was business manager of the club and associate editor of the review. (\"Prism\", Calvin College, 1929) He and Sadie were married for 44 years, until Sadie's death in 1978. He was an avid birder, and is survived by two sons, four grandchildren, and four great grandchildren.\n\nMany Michigan undergraduates were introduced to philosophy in the popular, historically-based course taught by Frankena and his close friend Paul Henle. For nearly his entire career, Frankena did most of his philosophical reading and writing at home at a desk made circa 1870. When he wrote a philosophical paper, he prepared a detailed outline, including very abbreviated versions of all points and cites, before writing the paper longhand using a mechanical pencil. He never used a typewriter or computer. Frankena greatly valued his many conversations with other moral philosophers throughout the U.S. and western Europe. William K. Frankena's philosophical papers are in the collection of the Bentley Historical Library at the University of Michigan. His philosophy books are in the collection of the Tanner Philosophy Library in Angell Hall at the University of Michigan.\n\nWhile he was chair of the Michigan Philosophy Department, Frankena devoted a considerable portion of his time to service to the university and the philosophy profession, and became known for his role in defending academic freedom during the McCarthy era.\n\nAfter that period, he had more time to publish books and articles. During his career Frankena was chair of the Board of Officers of the American Philosophical Association (APA), chair of the Council for Philosophical Studies, president of the APA's Western Division, a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and of the National Academy of Education, and a recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship, a Fellowship from the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, a National Endowment for the Humanities Senior Fellowship, and a Rockefeller Fellowship. Frankena was also active on Phi Beta Kappa Society committees. In 1974, he delivered the APA's prestigious Paul Carus Lectures on \"Three Questions about Morality.\" Calvin College named him a Distinguished Alumnus in 1984. Frankena received the University of Michigan's Distinguished Faculty Achievement Award, was Roy Wood Sellars Distinguished Collegiate Professor of Philosophy, and was the first College of Literature, Science, and the Arts Distinguished Senior Faculty Lecturer.\n\nA memorial essay by a member of the Michigan Philosophy Department states that \"William Frankena contributed as widely to moral philosophy and its neighboring areas as anyone in that remarkable group that dominated English-speaking ethics from the end of World War II well into the 1980s. From metaethics, the history of ethics, and normative ethical theory, to moral education, moral psychology, and applied ethics, to religious ethics and the philosophy of education, the sweep and quality of his ethical philosophizing was simply extraordinary.\" When Frankena retired and was awarded emeritus status in 1978, the University Regents stated that \"he is renowned for his learning in the history of ethics, a subject about which he is generally believed in the profession to know more than anyone else in the world.\" The July 1981 issue of \"The Monist\" is devoted to \"The Philosophy of William Frankena.\"\n\nThe University has created a chair for the \"Carl G. Hempel & William K. Frankena Distinguished University Professor,\" and annually awards the William K Frankena Prize for excellence in philosophy to an undergraduate student.\n\n\n\n"}
