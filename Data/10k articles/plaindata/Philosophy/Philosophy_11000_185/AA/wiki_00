{"id": "31468613", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31468613", "title": "Book of Nature", "text": "Book of Nature\n\nThe Book of Nature is a religious and philosophical concept originating in the Latin Middle Ages which views nature as a book to be read for knowledge and understanding. There also was a book written by Conrad of Megenberg in the 14th century with the original German title of \"Buch der Natur\". Early theologians believed the Book of Nature was a source of God's revelation to mankind: when read alongside sacred scripture, the \"book\" of nature and the study of God's creations would lead to a knowledge of God himself. The concept corresponds to the early Greek philosophical belief that man, as part of a coherent universe, is capable of understanding the design of the natural world through reason. The concept is frequently deployed by philosophers, theologians, and scholars.\n\nThe first use of the phrase is unknown. However, Galileo used the phrase, quoting Tertullian, when he wrote of how \" “We conclude that God is known first through Nature, and then again, more particularly, by doctrine; by Nature in His works, and by doctrine in His revealed word.” (5) (5) Adversus Marcionem, I, 18..\"\n\nFrom the earliest times in known civilizations, events in the natural world were expressed through a collection of stories concerning everyday life. In ancient times, a mortal world existed alongside an upper world of spirits and gods acting through nature to create a unified and intersecting moral and natural cosmos. Humans, living in a world that was acted upon by free acting and conspiring gods of nature, attempted to understand their world and the actions of the divine by observing and correctly interpreting natural phenomena, such as the motion and position of stars and planets. Efforts to interpret and understand divine intentions led mortals to believe that intervention and influence over godly acts was possible—either through religious persuasion, such as prayer or gifts, or through magic, which depended on sorcery and the manipulation of nature in order to bend the will of the gods. Knowing divine intentions and anticipating divine actions through the manipulation of the natural world was believed achievable and the most effective approach. Thus, mankind had a reason to know nature.\n\nAround the sixth century BC, man’s relationship with the deities and nature began to change. Greek philosophers, such as Thales of Miletus, no longer viewed natural phenomena as the result of free acting, omnipotent gods. Rather, natural forces resided within nature, which was an integral part of a created world, and appeared under certain conditions that had little to do with the manipulative tendencies of personal deities. Furthermore, the Greeks believed that natural phenomena occurred by “necessity” through intersecting chains of “cause” and “effect.” Greek philosophers, however, lacked a technical vocabulary to express such abstract concepts as “necessity” or “cause” and consequently co-opted words available in the Greek language to refer metaphorically to the new philosophy of nature. Accordingly, the Greeks conceptualized the natural world in more specific terms that aligned with a new philosophy that viewed nature as immanent in which natural phenomena occurred by necessity.[2]\n\nIn Christianity early Church Fathers appeared to use the idea of a book of nature, librum naturae, as part of a two-book theology: \"Among the Fathers of the Church, explicit references to the Book of Nature can be found, in St. Basil, St. Gregory of Nyssa, St. Augustine, John Cassian, St. John Chrysostom, St. Ephrem the Syrian, St. Maximus the Confessor.\" \n\nThe Greek concept of nature, metaphorically expressed in the Book of Nature, gave birth to three philosophical traditions that became the wellspring for natural philosophy and early scientific thinking. Among the three traditions inspired by Plato, Aristotle, and Pythagoras, the Aristotelian corpus became a pervasive force in natural philosophy until it was challenged in early modern times.[3] Natural philosophy, which encompassed a body of work whose purpose was to describe and explain the natural world, derived its foremost authority from Aristotle, who viewed natural philosophy as a doctrine intended to explain natural events in terms of readily understood causes. In contrast, Aristotle considered the purely abstract mathematical constructs by Plato and Pythagoras inadequate for knowing the natural world because of their inability to provide causal explanations.\n\nAristotle reasoned that knowledge of natural phenomena was derived by abstraction from a sensory awareness of the natural world—in short, knowledge was obtained through sensory experience.[4] A world constructed by abstract ideas alone could not exist. Furthermore, the structures inherent in nature are revealed through this process of abstraction, which may result in metaphysical principles that can be used to explain a variety of natural phenomena, including their causes and effects. Events that have no identifiable cause happen by chance and reside outside the boundaries of natural philosophy. The search for causal explanations became a dominant focus in natural philosophy whose origins lay in the Book of Nature as conceived by the earliest Greek philosophers.[5]\n\nThe Greeks succeeded in constructing a view of the natural world in which all references to mythological origins and causes were removed. By abandoning ancient ties to free acting, conspiring gods of nature, Greek philosophers inadvertently left the upper world vacant. The new philosophy of nature made unseen mythological forces irrelevant. While some philosophers drifted toward atheism, others worked within the new philosophy to reconstitute the concept of a divine being. Consequently, the new outlook toward the natural world inspired the belief for a supreme force that was compatible with the new philosophy—in other words, monotheistic. However, the path leading from nature to rediscovering a divine being was uncertain. Once again, the Book of Nature was consulted, and it was Aristotle who interpreted its spoken text.[6]\n\nThe belief in causality in nature implied an endless, interconnected chain of causation acting upon the natural world. It is presumed, however, that Greek thought denied the existence of a natural world where causality was infinite, which gave rise to Aristotle's doctrine of \"efficient cause,\" or “first cause,\" upon which the order of other causes must rely. The pathway to heaven became clear: “the First Cause is also the Prime Mover of the world; and, since motion is a fact revealed by the senses, the Prime Mover must exist by necessity, a being unable to be otherwise than it is. Consequently, it is also perfect and thus the ultimate object of desire, or the ‘Supreme Good’. And, since nature operates for a purpose, the Prime Mover must also be intelligent. Being eternal it is divine…” and we now know of it as “God.”[7] The ultimate cause, or source, of all natural phenomena occurring in the natural world had been discovered. There was but one God, and He has created all that resides in the Book of Nature.[8]\n\nThe first contact between Christianity and Greek culture occurred in Athens in the first century A.D. Christian theologians viewed the Greeks as a pagan culture whose philosophers were obsessed with the wonders of the material, or natural, world. Observation and explanation of natural phenomena were of little value to the Church. Consequently, early Christian theologians dismissed Greek knowledge as being perishable in contrast to true knowledge derived from sacred Scripture. Yet, the Church Fathers struggled with questions concerning the natural world and its creation that reflected the concerns of Greek philosophers. Despite their rejection of pagan thinking, the Church Fathers benefited from Greek dialectic and ontology by inheriting a technical language that could help express solutions to their concerns.[9] As Peter Harrison observes, “in the application of the principles of pagan philosophy to the raw materials of a faith, the content of which was expressed in those documents which were to become the New Testament, we can discern the beginnings of Christian theology.”[10] Eventually, Church Fathers would recognize the value of the natural world because it provided a means of deciphering God’s work and acquiring true knowledge of Him. In other words, God has infused the material world with symbolic meaning, which if understood by man, reveals higher spiritual truths.[11] For the moment, however, the Church’s indifference to nature would prevail in ecclesiastical matters.\n\nWhat the Church Fathers needed, and did not inherit from the early Greek philosophers, was a method of interpreting the symbolic meanings embedded in the material world. According to Harrison, it was Church Father Origen in the third century who perfected a hermeneutical method that was first developed by the Platonists of the Alexandrian school by which the natural world could be persuaded to give up hidden meanings.[12] “This universal hermeneutic was to provide interpretive strategies for dealing with both texts and objects in the physical world. It lay at the foundation of the ‘symbolist mentality’ of the middle ages, and was the \"sine qua non\" of the medieval image of the ‘book of nature’.\"[13]\n\nFor their part, the Platonists believed the visible world reveals knowledge about the invisible world, which in turn, reveals truth and knowledge of the Creator. Origen then demonstrated how the natural world could be made intelligible to man through a process that exposed the spiritual realities which the material world signified. Thus, if the natural world was created to minister to the physical and spiritual needs of mankind, reading the Book of Nature ensured both needs could be fulfilled, in part through what the visible world signifies.[14] The importance of reading the Book of Nature alongside sacred Scripture became evident because references to the natural world in sacred text were unintelligible unless the reader was knowledgeable about the Book of Nature in order to understand these references and interpret their meaning. However, whereas the Book of Nature served Scripture well, it lacked internal order and discernible relationships between the objects it represented thereby reducing nature to an inchoate and unintelligible language. The Book of Nature required substantial editing and revision, which would not occur for another nine hundred years.[15]\n\nBy the twelfth century, a renewed study of nature was beginning to emerge along with the recovered works of ancient philosophers, which were being translated from Arabic and original Greek. The writings of Aristotle were among the most important of the ancient texts and had a remarkable influence among intellectuals. Interest in the material world, in conjunction with the doctrines of Aristotle, elevated sensory experience to new levels of importance. Earlier teachings concerning the relationship between God and man’s knowledge of material things were giving way to a world in which knowledge of the material world conveyed knowledge of God. Whereas scholars and theologians once held a symbolist mentality of the natural world as expressive of spiritual realities, intellectual thinking now regarded nature as a “coherent entity which could be systematically investigated by the senses. The idea of nature is that of a particular ordering of natural objects, and the study of nature the systematic investigation of that order.”[16]\n\nThe notion of order in nature implied a structure to the physical world whereby relationships between objects could be defined. According to Harrison, the twelfth century marked an important time in the Christian era when the world became invested with its own patterns of order—patterns based on networks of likeness or similarities among material things, which served to determine the character of a pre-modern knowledge of nature. While God has made all things that reside in the Book of Nature, certain objects in nature share similar characteristics with other objects, which delineates the sphere of nature and “establishes the systematising principles upon which knowledge of the natural world is based.”[17] Thus, the Book of Nature was acquiring a table of contents and its subject matter could now be indexed. No longer a catalogue of religious symbols, the Book of Nature attained a unified and coherent whole in which the meaning of its contents was discernible.[18] Indeed, nature could now be read like a book.\n\nScholars, natural philosophers, emerging naturalists, and other readers of the new Book of Nature enthusiastically renewed their investigation of the natural world. Alongside sacred Scripture, the Book of Nature also became a font of divine revelation and a source of knowledge of God. This also implied that for mankind, nature itself became a new authority concerning the divine. There now existed two ways of knowing God—two texts, or two \"books\"—sacred Scripture and the Book of Nature, and two separate authorities, which was disquieting to many contemporary observers. Which textual authority took precedence? How would inconsistencies between the two texts be resolved? Who would mediate between the two books and exercise final interpretive authority? As Harrison points out, the exegesis of the Book of Nature became a critical concern, especially to the Church.[19] Religious indifference to the material world, which had survived for centuries, came to an end by the thirteenth century. Interest in nature by Church Fathers would transform the study of nature into a theological enterprise. The Book of Nature became a bestseller among clerics and theologians anxious for its knowledge in their search for divine truth and concern for preserving and strengthening the authority of the Church in all matters ecclesiastical, which now included the Book of Nature.[20]\n\nBy the sixteenth century, discord between traditional authorities was beginning to surface. Ancient texts and doctrines were disputed, knowledge of the natural world was found to be incomplete, interpretation of Scripture was being challenged, and Greek philosophy, which helped draft the Book of Nature, and Scripture were viewed as fundamentally opposed.[21] The Book of Nature was acquiring greater authority, for its wisdom and as an unmediated source of natural and divine knowledge. As a source of revelation, the Book of Nature remained moored to the Christian faith and occupied a prominent location in Western culture alongside sacred Scripture. The concern that these two books would eventually collide, however, was becoming increasingly evident among scholars, natural philosophers, and theologians, who viewed with trepidation the possibility of two separate and incompatible worlds—one determined to possess nature, and the other determined to uphold Christian faith. The social and religious transformations already underway in European society and western culture would shove these two diverging worlds even farther apart. The purpose for which the Book of Nature was written and the emerging confrontation between natural science and religion over the locus of authority on matters of truth and ideological certitude were fundamental issues that mankind, perched on the threshold of modernity, would be forced to contemplate.\n\n\n2.

In the colonial era, Spaniards extended the word as a title for the leaders of practically all indigenous groups that they encountered in the Western Hemisphere. In Spanish America, Brazil, Spain, and Portugal, the term also has come to mean a political boss or leader who exercises significant power in the political system known as caciquismo.\n\n\"Cacique\" comes from the Taíno word \"kassiquan\", meaning \"to keep house.\" In Taíno culture, the \"cacique\" rank was apparently established through democratic means. His importance in the tribe was determined by the size of his tribe rather than his warlord skills since the Taínos were mostly a peaceable culture. They also enjoyed several privileges for their standing: they lived in a larger rectangular hut in the centre of the village, rather than the circular huts of other villagers, and they had a special sitting place for the \"areytos\" (ceremonial dances) and the ceremonial ball game. \n\nSpaniards extended the usage of \"cacique\" to refer to leaders at the town or village level in virtually all indigenous groups in Spanish America. Caribbean caciques who did not initially oppose the Spanish were co-opted into being intermediaries between the Spanish and their communities, but their cooperation was transitional and most revolted, resulting in their deaths in battle or by execution. Two famous early colonial-era \"caciques\" are Hatuey (Cuba) and Enriquillo (Hispaniola) who are now national heroes in Cuba and the Dominican Republic. At the base of the monument to Hatuey the historical plaque reads: \"To the memory of Chief Hatuey, unforgettable native, precursor of the Cuban fight for freedom, he offered his life, glorifying his ideals while tormented by the flames on 2/2/1512. Monuments Delegation of Yara, 1999\". Hatuey was a historical character in the 2010 film \"Even the Rain\".\n\nIn central Mexico in the colonial era, the Spanish more successfully utilized the leaders of the much more hierarchically organized indigenous peoples to function as intermediaries in the system of colonial rule. The hierarchy and nomenclature of indigenous leadership there might survive internally within communities, but the Spaniards' designation of \"caciques\" did not necessarily correspond to the hereditary indigenous system of leadership.\n\nElite indigenous men willing to cooperate with the colonial rule replaced those with hereditary and traditional claims to leadership. The Spanish recognized the indigenous nobility as nobles within newly established colonial system, and \"caciques\"' status along with their families was reinforced by their being allowed to hold the Spanish noble honorific \"don\" and \"doña\". Some \"caciques\" had entailed estates called cacicazgos. The records of many of these Mexican estates are held in the Mexican national archives in a section \"Vínculos\" (\"entails\"). The establishment of Spanish-style town government [\"cabildos\"] was used as a mechanism to replace traditional rule. Spanish manipulation of cabildo elections. In some areas the traditional, members hereditary lineages became office holders on the town councils.\n\nBy the late colonial era in central Mexico, the term \"cacique\" had lost its dynastic meaning in many areas; \"cacique status could in some degree buttress a family's prestige, but it could no longer in itself be regarded as a rank of major authority.\" In a 1769 appeal to the Viceroy of New Spain by a \"cacique\" family for restoration of its privileges, they were enumerated: that the cacique should be seated separately from commoners at public functions; he was excused from serving in town government; he was exempted from tribute and other exactions; he was excused from Sunday worship and payments of the half real; his servants were not liable for community labor; he was exempt from incarceration for debt and his property from sequestration; he could be imprisoned for serious crime but not jailed in the public jail; the caciques' names were to be listed among the nobles in official registers; and \"all these privileges are to apply equally to the caciques' wives and widows.\" With Mexican independence in 1821, the special privileges of colonial-era caciques were abolished.\n\nIn the Andean region, the term \"kuraka\" was also used as an alternative to \"cacique\". In Peru, the Spaniards had allowed the \"caciques\" to maintain their titles of nobility and perquisites of local rule so long as they were loyal to the Spanish monarch. In the late eighteenth century, a massive uprising, the Tupac Amaru rebellion (1781), often called the \"Great Rebellion,\" was led by Tupac Amaru II, a \"cacique\" who claimed to be a descendant of the Inca royal line. At independence in 1825, Simón Bolívar abolished noble titles, but the power and prestige of the \"caciques\" was already in decline following the Great Rebellion. Unlike the early Caribbean \"caciques\" who rebelled shortly after the imposition of Spanish rule, the Tupac Amaru rebellion came after 250 years of colonial rule.\n\nAn extension of the term \"cacique\", Caciquismo (\"boss rule\") can refer to a political system dominated by the power of local political bosses, the \"caciques\". In the post-independence period in Mexico, the term retained its meaning of \"indigenous\" leaders, but also took on a more general usage of a \"local\" or \"regional\" leader as well. Some scholars make a distinction between \"caudillos\" (political strongmen) and their rule, caudillismo, and \"caciques\" and \"caciquismo\". One Argentine intellectual, Carlos Octavio Bunge viewed \"caciquismo\" as emerging from anarchy and political disruption and then evolving into a \"pacific\" form of \"civilized caciquismo,\" such as Mexico's Porfirio Díaz (r. 1876-1911). Argentine writer Fernando N.A. Cuevillas views \"caciquismo\" as being \"nothing more than a special brand of tyrant.\"\n\nIn Spain, \"caciquismo\" appeared in late 19th-century Spain and early 20th-century. \nWriter Ramón Akal González views Galicia in northwest of Spain, as having remained in a continual state of strangulated growth over centuries as a result of \"caciquismo\" and nepotism. \"Galicia still suffers from this anachronistic caste of caciques.\" Spanish strongman El Caudillo Francisco Franco (1892-1975) was born in Ferrol in Galicia.\n\nIn the Philippines, the term \"cacique democracy\" was coined by Benedict Anderson. It has been used to describe the political system where in many parts of the country local leaders remain very strong, with almost warlord-type powers. The Philippines was a colony of Spain from the late sixteenth century until the Spanish–American War of 1898, when the United States assumed control. The U.S. administration subsequently introduced many commercial, political and administrative reforms. They were sometimes quite progressive and directed towards the modernization of government and commerce in the Philippines. However, the local traditional Filipino elites, being better educated and better connected than much of the local population, were often able to take advantage of the changes to bolster their positions.\n\nThere is no consensus in the scholarly literature about the origins of \"caciquismo\". Murdo J. MacLeod suggests that the terms \"cacique\" and \"caudillo\" \"either require further scrutiny or, perhaps, they have become so stretched by the diversity of explanations and processes packed into them that they have become somewhat empty generalizations.\"\n\n"}

The Gospel of Judas was mentioned and summarized by the Church Father Irenaeus of Lyons in his work \"Against Heresies\". This would make the Gospel of Judas older than the codex. \n\nThe codex was rediscovered near El Minya, Egypt, during the 1970s, and stored in a variety of unorthodox ways by various dealers who had little experience with antiquities. One stored it in a safe deposit box and another actually froze the documents, causing a unique and difficult kind of decay that makes the papyrus appear sandblasted. (Archivists can do nothing to remedy this damage since it is caused by the outer layers of the papyrus flaking off—taking ink with them.) Scholars heard rumors of the text from the 1980s onward as dealers periodically offered it for sale (displaying portions of the text or photographs of portions of the text in the process.) It was not examined and translated until 2001 after its current owner, Frieda Nussberger-Tchacos, concerned with its deteriorating condition, transferred it to the Maecenas Foundation for Ancient Art in Basel, Switzerland. She named it in honor of her father, Dimaratos Tchacos.\n\nRoughly a dozen pages of the original manuscript, seen briefly by scholars in the 1970s, are missing from the Codex today; it is believed that they were sold secretly to dealers, but none have come forward. According to National Geographic's website, fragments purported to be from the codex may also be part of an Ohio antiquities dealer's estate.\n\nIn April 2006, a complete translation of the text, with extensive footnotes, was released by the National Geographic Society: \"The Gospel Of Judas\" (, April 2006). The Society also created a two-hour television documentary, \"The Gospel of Judas\", which aired worldwide on the National Geographic Channel on April 9, 2006. A special issue of \"National Geographic\" magazine was also devoted to the Gospel of Judas. A critical edition of the Codex Tchacos, including complete, near life-sized color photographs of 26 pages, a revised transcription of the Coptic, and complete translation of the codex was published by National Geographic Society in 2007. The team also hopes to look at the cartonnage (a sort of paper-mâché used to stiffen the codex's cover) in order to find clues about who made the codex and when/where. (As a book the Tchacos Codex may be older than the twelve surviving volumes of the Nag Hammadi Library.)\n\nApril D. DeConick (the Isla Carroll and Percy E. Turner Professor of Biblical Studies in the Department of Religious Studies at Rice University) has published a book, \"The Thirteenth Apostle: What the Gospel of Judas Really Says\", questioning both the \"National Geographic's\" handling of the Gospel of Judas' publication and the veracity of its translation. She has argued both that \"National Geographic\" denied competent scholars access and that the scholars who were granted access to the Codex Tchacos were not able to go about their work properly due to the constraints put upon them, accusations similar to those leveled at the guardians of the Dead Sea Scrolls. Most notably, she points out that the first \"National Geographic\" translation omitted a \"not,\" reversing the meaning of the text. In an opinion piece in the \"New York Times\" (December 1, 2007), she wrote:\n\nThe importance of the Codex Tchacos is not in doubt, but work has only begun in understanding its true influence and origin.\n\n\n"}

Abner Kneeland was an 1838 Massachusetts state court case, notable for being the last time a court in the United States jailed a defendant for blasphemy.\n\nThe defendant, Abner Kneeland, was a mercurial preacher who had been a Universalist, but had since converted to a form of pantheism. He published letters in which he expounded on his recently adopted pantheist philosophy, denying any God other than Nature as well as the uniquely particular divinity of Jesus Christ. Already a controversial figure, he was taken to court after he admitted having written these statements. The legal indictment was for \"willfully blaspheming the holy name of God\" and for his public disavowal of Christ. Though the statements used for the prosecution were written in 1833, delays and restarts of the trial meant that the final case was heard in 1838.\n\nAt trial, Kneeland raised three defenses of his actions:\n\n\nThe court was unconvinced by Kneeland's claims. It ruled that regardless of his beliefs, he had libeled God's name with malicious intent, rendering Kneeland's first point moot. As for the second, the court examined other states' colonial charters and pointed out that they too had reconciled blasphemy laws with guarantees of religious freedom, and that the law \"was passed very soon after the adoption of the constitution, and no doubt, many members of the convention which framed the constitution, were members of the legislature which passed this law.\" Therefore, they must not conflict. The court dismissed the third claim out of hand, saying that if unlimited freedom of the press was allowed,\n\nKneeland was sentenced to sixty days in prison. In his support, a petition was put forward by for his pardon under grounds of free speech by William Ellery Channing, signed by various prominent people including Ralph Waldo Emerson and William Lloyd Garrison.

The work is a poignant attack against Hegelianism, the philosophy of Hegel, especially Hegel's \"Science of Logic\". The work is also famous for its dictum, \"Subjectivity is Truth\". It was an attack on what Kierkegaard saw as Hegel's deterministic philosophy. Against Hegel's system, Kierkegaard is often interpreted as taking the side of metaphysical libertarianism or freewill, though it has been argued that an incompatibilist conception of free will is not essential to Kierkegaard's formulation of existentialism.\n\nAs the title suggests, the Postscript is sequel to the earlier \"Philosophical Fragments\". The title of the work is ironic because the Postscript is almost five times larger than the Fragments. The Postscript credits \"Johannes Climacus\" as the author and Kierkegaard as its editor. Like his other pseudonymous works, the Postscript is not a reflection of Kierkegaard's own beliefs. However, unlike his other pseudonymous works, Kierkegaard attaches his name as editor to this work, showing the importance of the Postscript to Kierkegaard's overall authorship.\n\nEduard Geismar was an early lecturer on the works of Soren Kierkegaard. He gave lectures at Princeton Theological Seminary in March 1936 and states this about Johannes Climacus: \nEmil Brunner mentioned Kierkegaard 51 times in his 1937 book \"Man in Revolt\" and wrote a semi-serious parody of Kierkegaard's idea of truth as subjectivity by making truth objectivity in 1947. \n\nThe question as to whether Kierkegaard was an existentialist was brought up by Libuse Lukas Miller. She wrote the following in 1957: \n\nIn 1963 Kenneth Hamilton described Paul Tillich as an individual who was as anti-Hegel as Kierkegaard was. He was referring to Kierkegaard's distrust of system builders which he discussed in \"The Concluding Unscientific Postscript\" (p. 13-15, 106-112.) \n\n"}

The 14th-century work \"'Aja'ib al-makhluqat wa-ghara'ib al-mawjudat\" by Persian physician Zakariya al-Qazwini is considered to be an early work of cosmography.\n\nTraditional Hindu, Buddhist and Jain cosmography schematize a universe centered on Mount Meru surrounded by rivers, continents and seas. These cosmographies posit a universe being repeatedly created and destroyed over time cycles of immense lengths.\n\nIn 1551, Martín Cortés de Albacar, from Zaragoza, Spain, published \"Breve compendio de la esfera y del arte de navegar\". Translated into English and reprinted several times, the work was of great influence in Britain for many years. He proposed spherical charts and mentioned magnetic deviation and the existence of magnetic poles.\n\nPeter Heylin's 1652 book \"Cosmographie\" (enlarged from his \"Microcosmos\" of 1621) was one of the earliest attempts to describe the entire world in English, and being the first known description of Australia and among the first of California. The book has 4 sections, examining the geography, politics, and cultures of Europe, Asia, Africa, and America, with an addendum on \"Terra Incognita\", including Australia, and extending to Utopia, Fairyland, and the \"Land of Chivalrie\".\n\nIn 1659, Thomas Porter published a smaller, but extensive \"Compendious Description of the Whole World\", which also included a chronology of world events from Creation forward. These were all part of a major trend in the European Renaissance to explore (and perhaps comprehend) the known world.\n\nThe word was also commonly used by Buckminster Fuller in his lectures.\n\nIn astrophysics, the term \"cosmography\" is beginning to be used to describe attempts to determine the large-scale matter distribution and kinematics of the observable universe, dependent on the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric but independent of the temporal dependence of the scale factor on the matter/energy composition of the Universe.\n"}
{"id": "52846751", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52846751", "title": "Countergradient variation", "text": "Countergradient variation\n\nCountergradient variation is a type of phenotypic plasticity that occurs when the phenotypic variation determined by a biological population's genetic components opposes the phenotypic variation caused by an environmental gradient. This can cause different populations of the same organism to display similar phenotypes regardless of their underlying genetics and differences in their environments.\n\nTo illustrate a common example known as countergradient growth rate, consider two populations. The two populations live in different environments that affect growth differently due to many ecological factors, such as the temperature and available food. One population is genetically predisposed to have an increased growth rate but inhabits an environment that reduces growth rate, such as a cool environment, and thereby limits the opportunities to take full advantage of any genetic predisposition. The second population is genetically predisposed to have a decreased growth rate but inhabits an environment that supports an increased growth rate, such as a warm environment, and allows members of the population to grow faster despite their genetic disadvantage. Since the genetic influence directly counteracts the environmental influence in each population, both populations will have a similar intermediate growth rate. Countergradient variation can reduce apparent variability by creating similar phenotypes, but it is still possible for the two populations to show phenotypic diversity if either the genetic gradient or the environmental gradient has a stronger influence.\n\nMany examples of countergradient variation have been discovered through the use of transplant experiments. Countergradient variation of growth rate is one of the most common examples. Growth rate and body size have important ecological implications, such as how they impact an organism's survival, life history, and fecundity. Countergradient variation has been described in many ectothermic animals, since ectotherms rely on environmental temperature to regulate their metabolic rates, and thus, their growth rates. Ectotherms grow at a slower rate as latitude increases due to this impact of temperature. However, under countergradient variation, when these same animals are placed in a common environment with their low-latitude relatives, they grow faster relative to the low-latitude population. These studies are useful in predicting how animals can adapt to and will survive in different environmental conditions.\n\nCountergradient variation, originally termed \"contra-gradient variation\", was coined by Richard Levins in his 1968 book \"Evolution in Changing Environments.\" Levins first used the term when describing patterns of body size across an altitudinal gradient in populations of \"Drosophila\", and since then many other instances of countergradient variation have been discovered. A study by Keith Berven and others was the first to find countergradient variation in a vertebrate. Specifically, they found that in comparing montane, high altitude, populations to lowland, low altitude populations of the green frog (\"Lithobates clamitans\", formerly \"Rana clamitans\"), rates of growth and development were higher in the montane populations. This is counter to what is expected since high altitude populations grow slower than low altitude ones in their respective environments. Similar to the results of this study, most of the known instances of countergradient variation are associated with a latitudinal or altitudinal gradient having an effect on growth rate (see Examples section).\n\nThe following are among the discovered cases of countergradient variation. The species name is followed by the trait affected and the environmental gradient studied.\n\n\n\nCountergradient variation is the opposite of cogradient variation, in which the environmental effect on the phenotype enhances the genetic effect on the phenotype. One common way to test for both of these patterns is with transplant experiments. By bringing the two populations to the same environment, the environmental effect on phenotype is eliminated and only the genetic effect will cause variation. If cogradient variation is occurring, the same relationship will be seen in the common environment as the two natural environments. However, if countergradient variation is occurring the opposite relationship of what is seen in the natural environments will be seen in the common environment. For example, if Population 1 has higher growth than Population 2 in their respective natural environments, countergradient variation can be detected if, when brought to the same environment, Population 1 now has lower growth than Population 2. Many of the examples listed above were discovered through these types of experiments. However, the mechanisms of how these differential growth rates arise is not fully understood.\n\nTake the example of \"Sceloporus undulatus,\" the eastern fence lizard. These lizards demonstrate countergradient variation in growth rate across a latitudinal gradient. That is, in a common environment eggs from populations from the northern part of their range hatch out sooner than the eggs from populations at a more southern range. This is opposite the pattern seen in their native habitats. One explanation for this could be that the northern eggs are also naturally larger, so they have more yolk energy available. Originally this maternal investment in larger eggs was thought to support increased developmental rate. However when yolk is removed from the eggs so that the populations have equal energy sources, there is still a substantial difference in growth. Therefore, the mechanism behind this differential growth rate may lie in the efficiency of energy use.\n\nPopulations that inhabit high latitudes experience shorter growing seasons than those that inhabit low latitudes due to the differences in seasonality. Because of this, it is thought that countergradient variation of growth is a means to compensate for the short amount of time juveniles have to prepare for winter. With a genetic disposition to grow faster, these individuals can reach a large enough body size to survive through the winter. Increased body size is also associated with higher reproductive output. Additionally, when countergradient variation acts on developmental rates, embryos that develop sooner or hatch out larger will have more time to grow or require less resources, respectively.\n\nSince these inherently fast growth rates are not observed in all populations, it seems there are potential trade-offs that would prevent this from being beneficial in low latitude populations. One proposed detriment of enhanced embryonic growth is that animals use too much of their supplied nutrients or yolk during development. In some species of lizards the yolk remaining after hatching is absorbed into the body and used as energy for growth as a hatchling. The use of more yolk energy during development diminishes the reserves available for hatchling growth and can impact hatchling survival. Another hypothesis is that animals that grow quickly do not expend as much energy on differentiation or cellular maintenance because they have shorter incubation times. This allows more energy to be used for growth, but less energy for differentiation. Increased growth has been shown to lead to higher occurrences of defects or complications that cause higher rates of mortality. Some examples include rapid growth leading to bone deformities in sandhill cranes and increased risk of cardiovascular problems in Atlantic salmon.\n\nAnimals are able to employ different strategies for growth and development to counteract environmental challenges. However, the fact that all individuals do not grow faster and the presence of the mentioned potential fitness trade-offs show that there must be some limit to how much animals can use countergradient growth to compensate for environmental conditions that cause slow growth. Studies of countergradient variation are being explored as a useful way to predict the evolutionary constraints animals face in differing environmental conditions.\n"}

During his lifetime, Likhachov was considered the world's foremost scholar of the Old Russian language and its literature.\n\nHe was revered as \"the last of old St Petersburgers\", and as \"a guardian of national culture\". Due to his high profile as a Soviet dissident during his later life, Likhachov was often referred to as \"Russia's conscience\".\n\nDmitry Likhachov was born in Saint Petersburg. From his early childhood he had a passion for literature, even though his parents did not approve of this interest.\n\nIn a 1987 interview with David Remnick, Likhachov recalled how he had, \"watched the February and October Revolutions from his window.\"\n\nIn 1923, at only 16 years old, Likhachov entered the Department of Linguistics and Literature of Leningrad State University. He attended the Roman-Germanic and Slavic-Russian sections at the same time, undertaking two diplomas. At the university the young Likhachov met many outstanding scientists and developed his own way of thinking. Likhachov graduated in 1928 from the Leningrad University. In 1928, at the end of his studies, Likhachyov was arrested and accused of being a member of what Remnick called, \"a students' literary group called the Cosmic Academy of Sciences\", which \"posed about as great a threat to the Kremlin as the \"Harvard Lampoon\" does to the White House.\"\n\nFor his election as an Academician, Likhachyov had presented a short report, in which he poked fun at the new spelling rules of 1918 and urged that they be \"reformed\" by restoring the banned letter \"Yat\". After his arrest, Likhachyov was confronted with the paper by a Soviet secret police interrogator, who screamed, \"What do you mean by language reform? Perhaps we won't even have any language at all under Socialism!\"\n\nAfter nine months in jail, the young scientist was unlawfully exiled without trial and spent five years in the USSR's first concentration camp, located on the Solovetsky Islands in the White Sea.\n\nDeported to the Solovki Special Purpose Camp, he spent 5 years studying \"criminal folklore\" (as he termed it). Dmitry Likhachov wrote his first scientific article, \"Card Games of Criminals\", in the camp. He didn't play cards himself, but was a keen observer. He also gathered much material about the language of thieves and later published articles and a book about thieves' slang and customs.\n\nAt the camp, hard work, poor living conditions and illness dramatically damaged Likhachov's health, but he survived. On the Solovetsky Islands he met both exiled Russian intellectuals and real criminals, who happened to save his life. As Dmitry Likhachov said many years later, \"At the Solovki, I understood that every person is a person.\"\n\nWhilst on the islands, for some period of time Dmitry Likhachov worked as a member of the Criminological Cabinet, organizing a labor colony for teenagers and saving them from death caused by hunger, drugs, and cold.\n\nOn the night of 28 October 1929, he was summoned from a visit with his parents and ordered to join a party of 300 prisoners destined for execution. Wishing to spare his parents the trauma, Likhachyov told them that he had been summoned for night work and that they should not wait for him. He then hid behind a wood pile and listened as the three hundred prisoners were shot and thrown into a mass grave. The next morning, Likhachyov returned from his hiding place as a completely different man. In a 1987 interview with David Remnick, Likhachyov recalled the events of that night and concluded, \"The executioner is older than me, and he is still alive.\"\n\nFrom 1931, Likhachov was a worker on the construction of the Stalin White Sea–Baltic Canal until his release.\n\nLikhachyov returned to Leningrad and started his spectacular scholarly career in the Pushkin House (as the Russian Literature Institute is known), which spanned more than 60 years and saw the publication of more than 500 scholarly works. Likhachov didn't stop his work even during the Siege of Leningrad. He believed that Russia was an integral and indivisible part of European civilization, contrary to \"Euroasiatic\" views of Russia popular with Lev Gumilev, Boris Rybakov, and many other contemporaries.\n\nLikhachov worked for five years as a proofreader in the publishing house of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR. In 1936, thanks to petitions by the president of the Academy of Sciences, Aleksandr Karpinsky, Dmitry Likhachyov's criminal record was cleared. In 1938 the talented scientist was noticed and invited to the Department of Old Russian Literature of the Institute of Russian Literature (known as the Pushkin House). Dmitry Likhachyov worked here until the end of his life.\n\nOld Russian literature, which at that time did not receive much academic attention, became the main scientific interest of Dmitry Likhachyov who, by the beginning of the 1940s, was one of the most renowned specialists in this sphere. In 1941 Likhachyov presented his thesis \"The Novgorod Annalistic Corpus of the 12th Century\".\n\nWorld War II brought new trials. Likhachov, together with his wife and twin daughters, survived the horrors of the siege of Leningrad (1941-1944). He described his experience in a story, full of harsh details, exposing different types of people and their heroic or appalling behavior when faced with starvation and death. In 1942, completely exhausted by hunger and cold, Dmitry Likhachyov started to gather materials on medieval poetry and soon published the book \"Defense of the Old Russian Cities\". In 1943 Likhachyov and his entire family were exiled to Kazan, supposedly because of the \"connection with the Solovetsky Camp\". But by the end of the war they had returned to Leningrad.\n\nIn 1947 Dmitry Likhachov received his Doctorate in Philology, having presented his thesis \"Essays on the History of Annalistic Literary Forms of the 11th–16th Centuries\". Three years later he became a professor at the Leningrad State University. From 1953 he was a corresponding member - and from 1970 a member of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR. Dmitry Likhachyov's conquest of the scientific world was definitely a triumphant one.\n\n1950 marked the publication of Likhachov’s two-volume edition containing unique, important literary works translated into the modern Russian language: \"The Primary Chronicle\", a history of Kievan Rus' from the 9th to the 12th centuries, and \"The Lay of the Host of Igor\", an account based on a failed raid by Prince Igor Svyatoslavich of Novgorod-Seversk against the Cumans in 1185.\n\nDmitry Likhachov was not a scientist detached from everyday life. From the 1950s he began a campaign to save the wooden temples of the Russian North and to preserve the historical appearance of Russian cities. He helped found the museums of Dostoevsky, Pushkin and Pasternak.\n\nIn 1953 Likhachov was admitted into the Soviet Academy of Sciences as a corresponding member. He defended Andrei Sakharov, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and other dissidents during their persecution by Soviet authorities.\n\nIn the 1960s Likhachyov was one of the initiators of the movement for the protection of historical monuments, libraries and archives. Thanks to Likhachyov many monuments were saved, including Marina Tsvetaeva's flat in Moscow, the Nevsky Prospect in Leningrad (which was supposed to be turned into a shopping street) and Aleksandr's Garden. In the 1980s he headed the Soviet (later renamed Russian) Cultural Fund, supporting the process of the Orthodox Church's reclaiming of its temples, formerly appropriated by the Soviet government. The scientist also participated in the preservation of national minorities in danger of dying out while aiding the return to Russia of émigré public and cultural figures.\n\nIn 1980 Likhachov was one of the members of the Academy of Sciences who refused to sign a letter requesting the expulsion the famous scientist Andrei Sakharov from the Academy because of Sakharov's public disapproval of the dispatch of Soviet troops to Afghanistan in 1979.\n\nDespite his busy social life, Likhachov still spent a lot of time on scientific work. Focusing on Old Russian literature, he developed the concept of artistic time and space. In 1969 the researcher was awarded with the USSR State Prize for his work \"Poetics of Old Russian Literature\".\n\nDmitry Likhachov gained worldwide recognition as a theorist of culture and as a publicist. In the 1980s he developed a concept that considered the problems of humanization and the reorientation of educational goals and ideas. The scientist viewed culture as a historical memory, as a process of accumulation, rather than consecutive changes. This was also the theoretical basis for Likhachov’s attention to ancient monuments, especially in architecture. Inspired by the works of Vladimir Vernadsky, Dmitry Likhachov suggested the idea of a “homosphere”- a human sphere of the Earth. His original contribution to general science was also the development of a new discipline called the ecology of culture, which was defined as an essential sphere of human life.\n\nOne of the ideas of Likhachov's concept was the correlation between culture and nature. In his book \"Poetics of the Gardens\" (1982), park and garden art was for the first time considered as a semiotic reflection of major cultural and artistic styles and their corresponding ideologies.\n\nIn Moscow and St. Petersburg, in 1986 he created the International Association of intellectuals and creative \"Myr Culture\", with the writer Nicolaj Sanvelian, the Italian economist and writer Giancarlo Pallavicini\nand other leading writers, artists and scientists, he was inspiring and President for many years.\n\nIn 1986 he was elected the first President of the Russian Cultural Fund. In his 1980s and 1990s, he became more of a public figure, serving as an informal advisor to St. Petersburg Mayor Anatoly Sobchak and Russian President Boris Yeltsin. In October 1993 he signed the Letter of Forty-Two. In the same year, he became the first person to be named an Honorary Citizen of St Petersburg. He also presided over the commission set up to prepare for Alexander Pushkin's bicentenary.\n\nLikhachov thought about his life journey as a vertical movement, towards the heavenly home. The reflections of his experience as a person are written in the book “Reminiscences” (1995).\n\nDuring the first visit to Rome Gorbachev, Myr Culture has officially handed over, on behalf of the intellectual-creative in the world, a cultural program, called \"Manifesto of the three\" by the signatories founders of the association, the Russian spokesman Zagladin presented the world's press at the Foro Italico, in 1998, as an instance of cultural freedom for Russia and for the world, signed by Dmitry Likhachov, Nicolaj Sanvelian e Giancarlo Pallavicini.\n\nThe last works by Dmitry Likhachov gathered together his general ideas about his native country. The book \"Thoughts About Russia\", completed in 1999, a few days before the author's death, is devoted to Russia'’s place in world history, its myths and its most characteristic features. The edition \"Russian Culture\" was published posthumously in 2000.\n\nAs a great scientist, Likhachov was a foreign member of the Academies of Sciences of Bulgaria, Hungary and Serbia and a corresponding member of the Austrian, American, British, Italian and Göttingen Academies. In 1984 the minor planet 2877 was named after Likhachyov.\n\nA year before his death, Likhachov became the very first recipient of the reinstated Order of St. Andrew.\n\nDmitry Likhachov died on 30 September 1999.\n\nIn 2001 Likhachyov's daughter and George Soros established the Likhachov Philanthropic Fund.\n\nLikhachov married Zinaida Makarova, who devoted her entire life to her husband. They had twin daughters, Vera and Lyudmila.\n\nA minor planet 2877 Likhachev discovered in 1969 by Soviet astronomer Lyudmila Chernykh is named after him.\n\n\n\n\n"}

For a large part of his life he lived and taught in Manchester and Altrincham, England, lecturing (in Manchester and Liverpool), running groups and giving personal tuition to a large number of interested people. He was a gifted artist, a writer of books, plays and poetry as well as possessing a profound understanding of philosophy, religion and the science of his day. Much of his work centred on his interpretation of the esoteric ideas behind religion. He practised and taught an approach to psychotherapy. He was a friend of the artist Käthe Schuftan, giving the tribute at her funeral in 1958.\n\nHalliday gave the term \"absolute sentient power\" to what we would call God and said that sentience and thus consciousness was an inherent quality of this power and by extension of all substances and created beings. Beings, including ourselves are modalities of this power which we feel as a field of energy, from which and through which we are informed about ourselves and the world. The goal and purpose of life is to grow towards an awareness of our true nature which is not different from this field and the absolute sentient power itself. This consciousness he called \"reflexive self-consciousness\" (\"resec\" for short). The force which calls and drives beings to work towards \"resec\" is Love – which he defined as \"a will to work for the development of the potentialities of all beings.\" Because of his own understanding and wisdom he valued individuality and encouraged others to discover their own valid way to reveal reflexivity to themselves. His extraordinary breadth of knowledge allowed him to interpret ideas from a variety of sources and made him a true renaissance man.\n\nThe IHS was founded by Eugene Halliday and Khen Ratcliffe. It is a study and meditation centre (in Tan y Garth Hall) dedicated to the teachings of Eugene Halliday. Under the guidance of its tutors, Tan y Garth Hall offers the opportunity for students and teachers from all denominations and walks of life to come together and study the hermeneutic techniques and principles of Yoga both East and West. Eugene Halliday's books and talks are available from the IHS at Tan y Garth Hall.\n\nHermeneutics is the art of interpretation; the theory of the discovery and communication of the concepts and teachings of the scriptures of the world; the science of attaining clarity, by comprehending, explaining and establishing the sense of both traditional and biblical authors. It looks to the individual's own apprehension rather than the conveyance of the meaning ascertained to others, thereby enabling individuals to interpret for themselves in the light of their own experience.\n\nEugene Halliday's work was wide ranging in scope, and he brought together into a coherent whole concepts from hierology (sacred texts), art, religion, philosophy, psychology and science. From his insight into human thought and motivation, he stated that no school of thought has access to the only truth about reality, that no one religion possesses the only true path to the divine. \"Each great philosopher has been a doorway for a part of Truth\". In 1966 Eugene Halliday founded the Charity ISHVAL, together with the Liverpool businessman and philanthropist Fred Freeman and his wife Yvonne, and the actors David Mahlowe and Zero Mahlowe. ISHVAL, the Institute for the Study of Hierological Values, had as its aims and objectives:\na) The promotion and propagation of the principles of Truth in all Religions in order to achieve unity in interpretations of Sacred Writings between all denominations and mutual understanding and practice of the principles of Truth in a true spirit of ecumenism.\nb) The instruction and education of all persons desirous of learning in the study of hierological values in relation to religion and philosophy for the better appreciation and enjoyment of art and science and the purpose of life.\n\nHierology is from the Greek hieros, priest, and logy, meaning \"a speaking, discourse, treatise, doctrine, theory, science,\". It is defined as sacred literature, learning or a body of knowledge regarding sacred things, the literary or traditional embodiment of the religious beliefs of a people. For example, the sacred texts of different religions.\n\nHalliday's ecumenism was of the most universal variety. While at the core of his teaching was the concept of the primacy of Jesus Christ, it came from an inner understanding of the nature of Love, and transcended the bounds of any religious orthodoxy. He had an integrated view of the development of world religions. \"India's religion (Hinduism) is non-historical, concerns itself with the Eternal Recurrence, the Great Cycle, Days and Nights of Brahma that endlessly follow each other: Yoga is aimed to break the cycle by releasing the individual from Manvantara into eternal Nirvana.\" In Judaism, a select group of people were separated from the mass of animal-men and subjected to pressures which led to the attainment of group consciousness; their commandments were negative \"Thou shalt not\". Jesus Christ \"presents the first true individuated person able to stand against the elect group\". The commandments of Christianity were positive, \"Thou shalt love\". Having taught his disciples, he left them \"so that they too may find themselves and become authors of their own being\". \"In Islam is no barrier of race or colour or class. The goal was not the individual as such, but the individual-able-to-relate-to-all-beings without self-loss or regression\". \"The one Eternal Religion which Hindu thought intuited appears in its historical aspect in Judaism, Christianity and Islam, as Law (Father), Love (Son) and Illuminative Knowledge (Holy Ghost). The Fourth Revelation (Maitreya) will but put these three together as of equal validity in the cosmic plan.\"\n\nISHVAL closed as a charity in 2015, its work being continuous with the newly formed, more simply administered, not-for-profit organisation, Eugene Halliday Association. Its members recognise that Eugene Halliday worked to enable the development of potential of himself and all those who are willing to work with him. He left a legacy of written, artistic and spoken work setting out his principles of self-development, the way to reflexive self-consciousness and an understanding of how to live in the world. Its aims and objectives are:\n1) To educate ourselves through studying and engaging with the work of Eugene Halliday, artist and writer, and the principles he taught. 2) To establish and communicate a wider awareness of the legacy of Eugene Halliday and to encourage and support others who are interested to study and engage with his work. 3) To investigate areas of study to which Eugene Halliday introduced us, and other appropriate areas which may be worthy of investigation. These include art, religion, philosophy and science. Its mission is: 'Our purpose is self-development: to centre and balance ourselves through the intelligent co-ordination of clear thought, sensitive feeling and action of good will; to work to develop our creative potential and that of our fellow beings.'\n\nReflexive self-consciousness is perhaps the most important and core concept in Eugene Halliday's work. In his book, \"Reflexive Self-Consciousness\", published in the 1950s, he sets out a way by which we can develop the ability to respond adequately to the demands life makes of us, the ability to assimilate the shocks and blows of experience, so we can live a whole and balanced life. The way to this balance is through an understanding of the centre of our own being, our consciousness, and through this, finding our place in relation to the universe.\n\nHalliday's philosophy is non-dualist, as in the Hindu concept of advaita, expounded by Adi Shankara and other advaitin philosophers. Advaita is sometimes described as a monistic philosophy, but Halliday is careful to distinguish it both from monism and pluralism, as a description of the nature of the universe, and our relationship to 'God' or 'absolute sentient power' (see above) (A.S.P.). \"Infinity is not comprehensible in a monistic concept, for monism implies circumscription, which is encapsulation or finitisation [making finite]. Non-dualism and Non-pluralism refer to the Infinity of the Absolute Sentient Power (A.S.P.), the infinite modalising activities of which generate all noumena and phenomena. Monism is an attempt to grasp in a knowable concept that which is of itself unknowable, for to know is to finite form within the A.S.P.\"\n\nAccording to Adi Shankara's Advaita Vedanta, Brahman (God, or the Supreme Cosmic Spirit) is the only reality; Maya is the illusionary power of Brahman \"which causes the Brahman to be seen as the illusory world\"; the Atman (soul or self) is not different from Brahman (see Wikipedia article Advaita Vedanta).\n\nHalliday's concept of 'A.S.P.' is related to the Hindu concept of Brahman, and to the Greek philosopher Anaximander's \"apeiron\", the 'limitless or boundless' source of the world. \"The Absolute is an infinite sentient power, an eternal continuum of motion. Because it is sentient it feels its own motion. Its motion is the content of its sentiency. It is from this fact that is derived the principle that says that a being knows only the modifications of its own substance; or consciousness is aware only of its own modalities\". Individual beings are rotatory motions, or modalities, within the A.S.P., and are not-different from It. And not only individual beings but all phenomena: \"Ultimately we have to say that all things we know, all the ideas we think, and all the feeling states we experience, the totality of phenomena of all worlds, are merely modalities of the motion initiated and sustained by the Infinite Sentient Power we call God\".\n\nAlthough he does not seem to have employed the term, Halliday's religious philosophy can be described as one of Panentheism (pan-en-theism, all-within-god), the view that the universe is within God and that God also transcends the universe. The term was coined by German idealist philosopher Karl Christian Friedrich Krause (1781–1832). Halliday did not hold with the view of pantheism, which sees the universe as identical with God. He was well-versed both in comparative religion and the science of his day, and wrote extensively on the relation between the different religions, and between science and religion. He often quoted Einstein's famous equation and explained \"We all know today, as a matter of fact, not fantasy, that matter can be broken down and demonstrated to be energy\". One of the authors he recommended was Alfred North Whitehead, mathematician and philosopher of science, who had noted that the dominant model for the natural world had moved from mechanism to organism during the 19th century. In panentheism is found a concept of God in which natural laws and processes are respected.\n\n1942:The Manchester Academy of Fine Arts, Spring Exhibition which included a portrait \"Old Harry\" by Eugene Halliday and a portrait by Käthe Schuftan.\n\n1943: The Manchester Ballet Club, exhibition for the benefit of \"Mrs. Churchill's Aid to Russian Fund\", which included a scraperboard by Eugene Halliday and a watercolour by Käthe Schuftan.

Toolkit genes are central to the synthesis of molecular genetics, palaeontology, evolution and developmental biology in the science of evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo).\n\nToolkit genes are highly conserved among phyla, meaning that they are ancient, dating back to the last common ancestor of bilaterian animals. For example, that ancestor had at least 7 Pax genes for transcription factors.\n\nDifferences in deployment of toolkit genes affect the body plan and the number, identity, and pattern of body parts. The majority of toolkit genes are components of signaling pathways, and encode for the production of transcription factors, cell adhesion proteins, cell surface receptor proteins (and signalling ligands that bind to them), and secreted morphogens, all of these participate in defining the fate of undifferentiated cells, generating spatial and temporal patterns, which in turn form the body plan of the organism. Among the most important of the toolkit genes are those of the Hox gene cluster, or complex. Hox genes, transcription factors containing the more broadly distributed homeobox protein-binding DNA motif, function in patterning the body axis. Thus, by combinatorial specifying the identity of particular body regions, Hox genes determine where limbs and other body segments will grow in a developing embryo or larva. A paradigmatic toolkit gene is \"Pax6/eyeless\", which controls eye formation in all animals. It has been found to produce eyes in mice and \"Drosophila\", even if mouse \"Pax6/eyeless\" was expressed in \"Drosophila\".\n\nThis means that a big part of the morphological evolution undergone by organisms is a product of variation in the genetic toolkit, either by the genes changing their expression pattern or acquiring new functions. A good example of the first is the enlargement of the beak in Darwin's large ground-finch (\"Geospiza magnirostris\"), in which the gene \"BMP\" is responsible for the larger beak of this bird, relative to the other finches.\n\nThe loss of legs in snakes and other squamates is another good example of genes changing their expression pattern. In this case the gene \"Distal-less\" is very under-expressed, or not expressed at all, in the regions where limbs would form in other tetrapods.\nIn 1994, Sean B. Carroll's team made the \"groundbreaking\" discovery that this same gene determines the eyespot pattern in butterfly wings, showing that toolbox genes can change their function.\n\nToolkit genes, as well as being highly conserved, also tend to evolve the same function convergently or in parallel. Classic examples of this are the already mentioned \"Distal-less\" gene, which is responsible for appendage formation in both tetrapods and insects, or, at a finer scale, the generation of wing patterns in the butterflies \"Heliconius erato\" and \"Heliconius melpomene\". These butterflies are Müllerian mimics whose coloration pattern arose in different evolutionary events, but is controlled by the same genes.\nThis supports Marc Kirschner and John C. Gerhart's theory of Facilitated Variation, which states that morphological evolutionary novelty is generated by regulatory changes in various members of a large set of conserved mechanisms of development and physiology.\n\n"}
{"id": "57435582", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57435582", "title": "Finite-valued logic", "text": "Finite-valued logic\n\nIn logic, a finite-valued logic (also finitely many-valued logic) is a propositional calculus in which truth values are discrete. Traditionally, in Aristotle's logic, the bivalent logic, also known as binary logic was the norm, as the law of the excluded middle precluded more than two possible values (i.e., \"true\" and \"false\") for any proposition. Modern three-valued logic (ternary logic) allows for an additional possible truth value (i.e. \"undecided\").\n\nThe term finitely many-valued logic is typically used to describe many-valued logic having three or more, but not infinite, truth values. The term finite-valued logic encompasses both finitely many-valued logic and bivalent logic. Fuzzy logics, which allow for degrees of values between \"true\" and \"false\"), are typically not considered forms of finite-valued logic. However, finite-valued logic can be applied in Boolean-valued modeling, description logics, and defuzzification of fuzzy logic. A finite-valued logic is decidable (sure to determine outcomes of the logic when it is applied to propositions) if and only if it has a computational semantics.\n\nAristotle's collected works regarding logic, known as the \"Organon\", describe bivalent logic primarily, though Aristotle's views may have allowed for propositions that are not actually true or false. The \"Organon\" influenced philosophers and mathematicians throughout the Enlightenment. George Boole developed an algebraic structure and an algorithmic probability theory based on bivalent logic in the 19th century.\n\nJan Łukasiewicz developed a system of three-valued logic in 1920. Emil Leon Post introduced further truth degrees in 1921.\n\nStephen Cole Kleene and U. Blau expanded the three-valued logic system of Łukasiewicz, for computer applications and for natural language analyses, repectively. Nuel Belnap and J. Michael Dunn developed a four-valued logic for computer applications in 1977. Since the mid-1970s, various procedures for providing arbitrary finite-valued logics have been developed.\n\nIn linguistics, finite-valued logic is used to treat presuppositions as product systems with ordered pairs of truth degrees, or truth tables. This enables assumptions built into verbal or written statements to be associated with varying degrees of truth values in the course of natural-language processing.\n\nIn the study of formal languages, finite-valued logic has shown that encapsulating a truth predicate in a language can render the language inconsistent. Saul Kripke has built on work pioneered by Alfred Tarski to demonstrate that such a truth predicate can be modeled using three-valued logic.\n\nPhilosophical questions, including the Sorites paradox, have been considered based on a finite-valued logic known as fuzzy plurivaluationism. The Sorites paradox suggests that if adding a grain of sand to something that is not a heap cannot create a heap, then a heap of sand cannot be created. A logical model of a heap in which there are as many truth degrees as grains of sand tends to refute that suggestion.\n\nIn electronics design, a logical model of the stable states of a circuit, in which there are as many truth degrees as there are states, serves as a model for finite-valued switching. Three-valued operators can be realized in integrated circuits.\n\nIn fuzzy logic, typically applied for approximate reasoning, a finitely-valued logic can represent propositions that may acquire values within a finite set.\n\nIn mathematics, logical matrices having multiple truth degrees are used to model systems of axioms.\n\nBiophysical indications suggest that in the brain, synaptic charge injections occur in finite steps, and that neuron arrangements can be modeled based on the probability distribution of a finitely valued random variable.\n\nIn the study of logic itself, finite-valued logic has served as an aid to understand the nature and existence of infinite-valued logic. Kurt Gödel attempted to comprehend the human ability for logical intuition in terms of finite-valued logic before concluding that the ability is based on infinite-valued logic.\n\n"}

He studied at the Ecole Normale Supérieure and the Sorbonne. He defended his doctoral dissertations in 1958 at the University of Paris. His main thesis, \"L'individuation à la lumière des notions de Forme et d'Information\" (\"Individuation in the light of the notions of Form and Information\"), was published in two parts, the first in 1964 under the title \"L'individu et sa génèse physico-biologique\" (\"Individuation and its physical-biological genesis\") at the Presses Universitaires de France, while it is only in 1989 that Aubier published the second part, \"L'individuation psychique et collective\" (\"Psychic and collective individuation\"). While his main thesis, which laid the foundations of his thinking, was not widely read until it was commented upon by Gilles Deleuze and, more recently, Bruno Latour and Bernard Stiegler, his complementary thesis, \"Du mode d'existence des objets techniques\" (\"On the mode of existence of technical objects\") was published by Aubier immediately after being completed (in 1958) and had an instant impact on a wide audience. It was only in 2005 that Jérôme Millon published a complete edition of the main thesis.\n\nIn \"L'individuation psychique et collective\", Simondon developed a theory of individual and collective individuation, in which the individual subject is considered as an effect of individuation, rather than as a cause. Thus the individual atom is replaced by the neverending process of individuation. Simondon also conceived of \"pre-individual fields\" as the funds making individuation itself possible. Individuation is an always incomplete process, always leaving a \"pre-individual\" left-over, itself making possible future individuations. Furthermore, individuation always creates both an individual and a collective subject, which individuate themselves together. Simondon criticized Norbert Wiener's theory of cybernetics, arguing that \"Right from the start, Cybernetics has accepted what all theory of technology must refuse: a classification of technological objects conducted by means of established criteria and following genera and species.\" Simondon aimed to overcome the shortcomings of cybernetics by developing a \"general phenomenology\" of machines.\n\nSimondon's theory of individuation through transduction in a metastable environment was an important influence on the thought of Gilles Deleuze, whose \"Différence et répétition\" (1968), \"Logique du sens\" (1969) and \"L'île déserte\" (2002) make explicit reference to Simondon's work. \"Gilbert Simondon: une pensée de l'individuation et de la technique\" (1994), the proceedings of the first conference devoted to Simondon's work, further charts his influence on such thinkers as François Laruelle, Gilles Châtelet, Anne Fagot-Largeau, Yves Deforge, René Thom, and Bernard Stiegler (the latter having placed Simondon's theory of individuation at the very heart of his ongoing and multi-volume philosophical project). Another contributor to \"Gilbert Simondon: une pensée de l'individuation et de la technique\", Simondon's friend John Hart, was the instigator of the very first translation—from French into English c.1980—of Simondon's work (this at University of Western Ontario in Canada where Hart had founded both a Department of Computer Science and a Simondon-inspired network: the ATN, or Audio Tactile Network in 1964). Currently, Simondon can be seen as a major influence on the work of such scholars as Paolo Virno, Jean-Hugues Barthélémy, Thierry Bardini, Luciana Parisi, Brian Massumi, Adrian Mackenzie, Muriel Combes, Carl Mitcham, Andrew Feenberg, Isabelle Stengers, Thomas LaMarre, Bruno Latour and Anne Sauvagnargues.\n\n\nPosthumous publications\n\nEnglish translations\n\n\nFrançois Lagarde and Pascal Chabot have made a movie on Simondon: Simondon of the Desert (english translation) with Anne Fagot-Largeault, Arne De Boever, Dominique Lecourt, Gilbert Hottois, Giovanni Carrozzini, Jean-Hugues Barthélémy, Jean Clottes, and music by Jean-Luc Guillonet.\n\n\n"}

In the German speaking world, Lesch plays a similar role to that of Neil deGrasse Tyson, as a bridge between the scientific community and the public.\n\nAfter completing secondary school in 1978 at the Theo-Koch-Schule in Grünberg, Hesse, Lesch studied physics at the University of Giessen, then at the University of Bonn, where he completed his doctoral degree in 1987 and worked at the Max-Planck-Institute for Radio Astronomy. From 1988 to 1991 he was a research assistant at the state observatory at Heidelberg-Königstuhl. In 1992 he was a visiting professor at the University of Toronto. In 1994 he was habilitated at the University of Bonn.\n\nSince 1995 Lesch has been a professor of theoretical astrophysics at the Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics at the LMU Munich. Additionally, he teaches natural philosophy at the University for Philosophy in Munich. His main areas of research are cosmic plasma physics, black holes, and neutron stars. He is the expert on astrophysics in the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) (German Research Society) and a member of the Astronomische Gesellschaft (Astronomical Society). He is also a textbook author.\n\nLesch has made television appearances for the longstanding, self-presented production of the channel BR-alpha: alpha-Centauri, Lesch & Co., Denker des Abendlandes (Thinkers of the Western World), and Alpha bis Omega (From Alpha to Omega). He also presented shorter television series. His presentations attempt to make complex physical or philosophical issues more accessible to the public. In 2005 he was awarded the Communicator Prize by the DFG and the Stifterverband für die Deutsche Wissenschaft (Foundation for German Scholarship) for his television appearances and publications. To honor his work on making scientific findings understandable to the broad public, the Naturforschende Gesellschaft zu Emden (nature research society) awarded him an honorary membership on March 15, 2011.\n\nFor many years, Lesch has presented a number of television series for the channel BR-alpha, beginning with alpha-Centauri, in which he is to be seen since 1998. In \"Lesch & Co.\" and \"Denker des Abendlandes\" (thinkers of the occident), he converses with the philosophy professor Wilhelm Vossenkuhl about philosophical topics. Alpha bis Omega deals with contradiction and consistency of religion and natural science, through conversations between Lesch and the Catholic theologist Thomas Schwartz.\n\nIn celebration of the Year of Einstein 2005, BR-alpha aired the 8-part series The Physics of Albert Einstein, where in each episode, one single scientific finding of Einstein was introduced by Lesch, who explained its significance. Starting in August 2007, the 16-part program The 4 Elements was aired weekly, which deals with the structure of the world, and in addition to scientific aspects, also handles cultural-historical aspects.\n\nFor the Pay-TV channel \"Syfy\" he differentiates scientifically based and fictional components of Star Trek in the series \"Star Trek – Science vs. Fiction\". From April to the end of 2007, Lesch moderated the weekly 5-minute program sci_xpert for this channel, which dealt with viewer questions, which mostly had to do with feasibility of science fiction concepts (such as \"How realistic are the huge spaceships from Independence Day?\"), but which also addressed purely scientific topics (for example \"What is gravity?\"), which were handled in the tradition of alpha-Centauri. There were a total of 35 episodes.\n\nSince September 2008 Lesch has been presenting the ZDF scholarly magazine \"Abenteuer Forschung\" (Adventures in Research). His predecessor was Joachim Bublath, who presented the show for many years.\n\nAt the start of the \"International Year of Astronomy 2009\", Lesch moderated in ZDF the 2½ hour special “How Light Was Born: the Long Night with Harald Lesch”, in which he, between short documentary films, led conversations with the cabaret artist and hobby-philosopher Christoph Süß, the physics professor Günther Hasinger, and the theology professor Thomas Schwartz.\n\nSince 2010, Lesch presents the show \"Lesch's Kosmos\", a 15-minute programme on the German documentary channel ZDFneo that deals with issues from various scientific fields. \n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Jiří Vacek (born May 25, 1931, Slaný, Czech Republic) is a Czech mystic, writer and translator of spiritual literature.\n\nHe is active as a teacher of yoga, mysticism and non-dualistic philosophy Advaita Vedanta in the Czech Republic. His spiritual practice is based on the teachings of Sri Ramana Maharshi, the Tamil sage of Arunachala. J. Vacek is the author of the unique encyclopaedia of yoga and mysticism published in the form of a book series entitled \"The Highest Yoga and Mysticism\". His articles on spiritual practice have been published in several Czech and foreign journals. He is also an author of many CDs and DVDs on various spiritual topics. J. Vacek translated a number of works from various fields of spiritual literature into the Czech language, especially, the teachings of Ramana Maharshi as well as many other foreign works. As a promoter of yoga and mysticism, he has significantly influenced the local spiritual scene and still continues to do so.\n\nJiří Vacek was born in 1931 in Slaný (a town near Prague) on Whit Monday, a day belonging to Whitsuntide – a significant feast of the liturgical year (the feast of the Holy Spirit). His childhood was affected by the German occupation of the Czechoslovakia during the World War II, when the whole Czech nation suffered greatly under the Nazi rule.\nThe beginnings of his interest in the spiritual life date back to as early as 1945. The very first spiritual book J. Vacek encountered, which influenced him greatly, was the Burning Bush (subtitled the \"Revealed Mystic Path\") by Karel Weinfurter. According to this book, J. Vacek started practising mystic exercises, namely the mantra repetition (IEOUA mantra) and silent concentration on the spiritual heart.\n\nFrom the very start, he also felt attracted to the personality of Ramana Maharshi, a spiritual teacher and sage from the 19th to 20th century, whose atma-vichara (the path of Self-enquiry) J. Vacek practiced from the end of the 1950s. His other spiritual masters, who he was personally in touch with, were Jaroslav Kočí from Ostrava and later Míla Tomášová.\n\nDuring the communist regime, Jiří Vacek was interrogated by the State Security (communist secret police) owing to his spiritual interests and even sentenced for \"disturbing the socialistic way of life\". Consequently, he was also sacked from work for a few times. Despite all that, he kept spreading both his original works and translations in the form of so-called samizdats .\n\nAfter the fall of the communist regime in former Czechoslovakia in 1989, J. Vacek began to operate in public and published translations of many spiritual books, especially the works with the teachings of Ramana Maharshi and also the books dealing with the non-dualistic realization – Advaita. He even translated several works from Christianity and Zen Buddhism. Altogether, he has so far published over 100 of his own original works and more than 30 translations from the English language.\n\nBeing retired, J. Vacek dedicates his free time to public meditations and meditations with his friends/students.\n\nWhat is the Path?\nThe path lies in turning away from the changing forms to their unchanging nature, which is their source. It lies in the withdrawal of consciousness´ attention from observed objects and its turning to the observer or witness, the consciousness itself, which leads to the realization of our true Nature, the Self, as pure consciousness and destruction of the illusion that we are a being limited by mind and body – ego. This way, it leads to liberation from worldly suffering and the rebirth cycle, countless lives and deaths in it, and to the restoration of the natural and original unlimited bliss of pure being. It removes the illusion of diversity and leads to the realization of the Unity, which is the highest Truth, the Lord, the eternal life and true happiness.\n\nThe spiritual practice as presented by Jiří Vacek is primarily based on the teaching of Ramana Maharshi. Just as him, Jiří Vacek teaches that the basis of the spiritual life lies in finding our true existence in the self-aware consciousness or, in other words, in the realisation of our true Self. The easiest way how to realise our true Self is to follow the \"footprint\" of the observer, since it is always true that to be able to observe anything, we – consciousness, that observes or is aware of observed objects, must be present here. In the consciousness of the observer, we continuously distinguish ourselves from all the observed/observable objects, which are: our body, the creations of our mind including our feelings, and the surrounding world. Simultaneously and directly, without words or thinking, we try to realise and experience that we are the non-material consciousness, which is aware of these observed objects. This is the most important element of the spiritual practice that we can and should practice permanently, even during all of our common daily activities. By the consciousness of the self-aware observer, we introduce the divine life into our day-to-day life. Then, we do not need to divide our life into the worldly activities and the spiritual ones, although formal meditation is still the basis. We simply try to carry out with all of our activities while being consciously aware of our true Self, our divine nature. This gradually makes all our activities easier since the level of our awareness rises and we can concentrate better and better on condition that we do not forget about our Self – us being different from anything that can be observed. This practice also enables us to work on the second crucial element of the spiritual practice, which is the dissolution of vasanas, tendencies of our mind directed towards our body and our world separated/fallen off from God. This practice, focused mostly on the static aspect of the Reality, was supplemented by Jiří Vacek with another inseparable element, which is so called inner pranayama. This meditation concentrates on the divine creative power and perfectly complements static, silent meditations so that both the aspects of the Reality – static and dynamic can be developed simultaneously.\n\nJiří Vacek is the author of more than 100 original titles on various topics of yoga and mysticism and more than 30 translations from various spiritual paths and directions. Other spiritual authors often quote or draw inspiration from his writings, e.g. Vojtěch Steiner in \"History of Yoga\" or the authors of the Russian edition of \"Talks with Ramana Maharshi\" and many others.\n\nJiří Vacek teaches the practice of the inner spiritual life in public meditations that have so far taken place in Prague, Brno, Olomouc and Hradec Králové (and before that even all over Slovakia) as well as in week-long meditation retreats that are held in various places in the Czech Republic.\n"}

In a set of five works written during this time he argued for a materialist philosophy, even though such a position \"entailed denial of free will and the soul.\"\n\nAs Shelburne's companion, Priestley had accompanied him on a tour of Europe in 1774; they spent quite a bit of time in Paris and the unsettling conversations Priestley had with the French \"philosophes\" there prompted him to write \"Letters to a Philosophical Unbeliever\", the last of his series of major metaphysical works. Priestley recalled the trip in his \"Memoirs\":\n\nAs I chose on all occasions to appear as a Christian, I was told by some of them [\"philosophes\"], that I was the only person they had ever met with, of whose understanding they had any opinion, who professed to believe Christianity. But on interrogating them on the subject, I soon found that they had given no proper attention to it, and did not really know what Christianity was ... Having conversed so much with unbelievers at home and abroad, I thought I should be able to combat their prejudices with some advantage, and with this view I wrote ... the first part of my ‘Letters to a Philosophical Unbeliever’, in proof of the doctrines of a God and a providence, and ... a second part, in defence of the evidences [sic] of Christianity.\n\nIn \"Letters\", he continued to defend his thesis, begun in \"Disquisitions relating to Matter and Spirit\" and \"The Doctrine of Philosophical Necessity Illustrated\", that materialism and determinism can be reconciled with a belief in God. The text addresses those whose faith is shaped by books and fashion; Priestley draws an analogy between the skepticism of educated men and the credulity of the masses. He again argues for the existence of God using what Schofield calls \"the classic argument from design ... leading from the necessary existence of a creator-designer to his self-comprehension, eternal existence, infinite power, omnipresence, and boundless benevolence.\"\n\nIn the three volumes, Priestley discusses, among many other works, Baron d'Holbach's \"Systeme de la Nature\". He claimed that d'Holbach's \"energy of nature,\" though it lacked intelligence or purpose, was really a description of God. Priestley believed that David Hume's style in the \"Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion\" (1779) was just as dangerous as its ideas; he feared the open-endedness of the Humean dialogue\n\n"}

{"id": "8642037", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8642037", "title": "Marco Pallis", "text": "Marco Pallis\n\nMarco Alexander Pallis (1895 – 5 June 1989) was a Greek-British author and mountaineer with close affiliations to the Traditionalist School. He wrote works on the religion and culture of Tibet.\n\nBorn in Liverpool on 19 June 1895, he was the youngest son of wealthy and cosmopolitan Greek parents. Pallis was educated at Harrow School and the University of Liverpool, where he studied entomology. In 1911 he traveled to British Guiana to study insects, and in 1912, he joined the Greek campaign against the Ottoman Empire during the first of the Balkan Wars. During the siege of Ioannina, the ancestral town of the Pallis family, he worked at a field hospital in Arta.\n\nDuring the First World War, Pallis, initially aided the Salvation Army in the region along the Sava River in Serbia. In 1916 he enlisted in the British Army and received a commission as an army interpreter in Macedonia. Malaria and a severe inflammation of his right eye cut short his Macedonian service. After a lengthy convalescence in Malta, Pallis applied to and was accepted by the Grenadier Guards. He received basic training, then advanced training as a machine-gunner. In 1918, as a second lieutenant, he was sent to fight in the trenches of the Western Front. During the battle of Cambrai, in a charge that killed his captain and first lieutenant, Pallis was shot through the knee and was forced to retire from combat.\n\nFollowing the war, Pallis climbed and explored against doctor's orders for his injured knee. He went on expeditions to the Arctic, Switzerland, and the Dolomites, and Snowdonia, the Peak District, and the Scottish Highlands when closer to home. In 1933 Pallis led a small mountaineering party to the area of Kinnaur, one of the Himalayan borderlands. Near the village of Nako, at the border with Tibet, Pallis and his team succeeded in making the first ascent of Leo Pargial (22,280 feet).\n\nIn 1936 Pallis returned to the Himalayas at the head of another expedition. His party traveled first to Sikkim, an “antechamber of Tibet”, where their failure to scale the summit of Simvu (22,360 feet) was, at least for Pallis, more than made up for by their encounter with the saintly abbot of Lachhen, in whom, according to Pallis, “intelligence, compassion, and initiatic authority were reflected in equal degree”.\n\nFrom Sikkim Pallis had hoped to cross the border into Tibet proper, but due to political circumstances it was impossible to obtain the necessary permissions. Forced to alter his plans, he decided instead to make his way to Ladakh. He was accompanied by his close friend Richard Nicholson and one other member of their climbing party, Dr. Robert Roaf. Once in Ladakh, they discarded Western clothes in favor of the \"chuba\", and assumed as much as possible a Tibetan manner of living. “It was our way of saying to our hosts: ‘We wish to be as one of you. Please make no unusual arrangements on our behalf. We love your tradition, and hope it will not be rashly changed. We have found means of attuning ourselves to its ways.’”\n\nPallis by now saw himself as a “pilgrim” of Tibetan Buddhism and in both Sikkim and Ladakh he received his religious education directly from qualified instructors within the living tradition. He dedicates his \"Peaks and Lamas\" to four teachers in particular, “the great contemplator, abbot of Lachhen, the venerable Dawa, bursar of Spituk, the venerable Konchhog Gyaltsan of P’hiyang, and the venerable Geshe Wangyal of Drepung, Lhasa who for my benefit and for the good of all creatures set in motion the Wheel of the Doctrine”.\n\nThe Second World War prevented further travels until 1947, when Pallis and Richard Nicholson were able to visit the Tibetan heartland before the coming Chinese invasion. They traveled widely throughout Tibet’s Tsang province, seeking to fulfill their shared desire to “absorb the spirit of the Tradition by direct experience”. Over the course of their stay they were able to make contact with each of the four major schools of Tibetan Buddhism (Gelugpa, Nyingmapa, Kagyudpa, and Sakyapa), visiting such holy sites as the ancient Pel Sakya monastery, seat of the Sakyapa and “a treasure-house of all the arts at their very best”, as well as the Tashilhunpo monastery, seat of the Panchen Lama and one of the four great monasteries of the Gelugpa.\n\nAfter his departure from the Tibetan plateau, Pallis lived in Kalimpong, India, for nearly four years before returning to England in 1951. Kalimpong was then a center of literary and cultural activity, as well as a refuge for many of those who were being forced to leave Tibet. Pallis formed many lasting relationships during this time, including an acquaintance with the then queen of Bhutan and her family, whom he later visited in England, and with the Dalai Lama’s former tutor Heinrich Harrer, with whom Pallis later collaborated in exposing the fraudulent writer Cyril Hoskin, alias “Lobsang Rampa”. While in Kalimpong, Pallis also met with the Dalai Lama’s Great Royal Mother, and he developed a close relationship with the abbot of the nearby Tharpa Choling monastery.\n\nAfter the political upheavals in Tibet in the 1950s, Pallis became active in the affairs of the Tibetan Society, the first Western support group created for the Tibetan people. Pallis also was able to house members of the Tibetan diaspora in his London flat. Pallis also formed a relationship with the young Chögyam Trungpa, who had just arrived in England. Trungpa asked Pallis to write the foreword to Trungpa’s first, autobiographical book, Born in Tibet. In his acknowledgment, Trungpa offers Pallis his “grateful thanks” for the “great help” that Pallis provided in bringing the book to completion. He goes on to say that “Mr. Pallis when consenting to write the foreword, devoted many weeks to the work of finally putting the book in order”.\n\nPallis studied music under Arnold Dolmetsch, the distinguished reviver of early English music, composer, and performer, and was considered “one of Dolmetsch's most devoted protégés”. Pallis soon discovered a love of early music—in particular chamber music of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries—and for the viola da gamba. Even while climbing in the region of the Satlej-Ganges watershed, he and his musically-minded friends did not fail to bring their instruments.\n\nPallis taught viol at the Royal Academy of Music, and reconstituted \"The English Consort of Viols\", an ensemble he had first formed in the 1930s. It was one of the first professional performing groups dedicated to the preservation of early English music. They released three records and made several concert tours in England and two tours to the United States.\n\nAccording to the New York Times review, their Town Hall concert of April 1962 “was a solid musical delight”, the players having possessed “a rhythmic fluidity that endowed the music with elegance and dignity”. Pallis also published several compositions, primarily for the viol, and wrote on the viol’s history and its place in early English music.\n\nThe Royal Academy of Music, in recognition of a lifetime of contribution to the field of early music, awarded Pallis an Honorary Fellowship. At age eighty-nine his \"Nocturne de l’Ephemere\" was performed at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London; his niece writes that “he was able to go on stage to accept the applause which he did with his customary modesty.” When he died he left unfinished an opera based on the life of Milarepa.\n\nPallis described \"tradition\" as being the leitmotif of his writing. He wrote from the perspective of what has come to be called the traditionalist or perennialist school of comparative religion founded by René Guénon, Ananda K. Coomaraswamy, and Frithjof Schuon, each of whom he knew personally. As a traditionalist, Pallis assumed the \"transcendent unity of religions\" (the title of Schuon's landmark 1948 book) and it was in part this understanding that gave Pallis insight into the innermost nature of the spiritual tradition of Tibet, his chosen love. He was a frequent contributor to the journal \"Studies in Comparative Religion\" (along with Schuon, Guénon, and Coomaraswamy), writings on both the topics of Tibetan culture and religious practice as well as the Perennialist philosophy.\n\nPallis published three books over a span of almost forty years. His first, \"Peaks and Lamas\" (1939), mentioned previously, tells the story “of how access was gained, across the varying episodes of Himalayan travel, to a traditional world, still complete and vigorous, that of Buddhism in its Tibetan branch”. This was followed by \"The Way and the Mountain\" (1960) and by \"A Buddhist Spectrum\" (1980), both collections of essays that attempt to deal “with a number of Buddhist themes of prime importance in such a fashion as to make up . . . a coherent view of the world and of a human destiny realizable in this world as seen through Buddhist eyes” Several of Pallis’ essays were also included in Jacob Needleman’s \"The Sword of Gnosis\". After his final journey to Tibet, while living in Kalimpong, Pallis wrote a short book in the Tibetan language addressing the dangers posed to Tibet by the encroachment of modern culture. In addition to penning his own writings, Pallis translated Buddhist texts into Greek, and translated works of fellow traditionalist writers René Guénon and Frithjof Schuon from French into English. Some of Pallis’ own works have also been translated into Italian, French, Spanish, and Turkish.\n\nSince the publication of his first book, sixty-six years ago, generations of scholars and students have turned to Pallis for insight into Buddhism and Tibet. His work is cited by such writers as Heinrich Harrer, Heinrich Zimmer, Joseph Campbell, Thomas Merton, Robert Aitken, and Huston Smith. Despite such scholarly acclaim, it is also true, as Harry Oldmeadow states, that “Pallis had no interest in research for its own sake, nor in any purely theoretical understanding of doctrine: his work was always attuned to the demands of the spiritual life itself. [His essays] should be of interest not only to those on the Buddhist path but to all spiritual wayfarers.” Huston Smith expresses a similar judgment when he declares: “Though Pallis respects scholarship, he doesn’t consider himself a Buddhist scholar. . . . What he does is focus on key Buddhist teachings and mine their essential and existential meaning. In the course of this project he regularly refers to other traditions, especially Christianity. . . . The result is completely satisfying. For insight, and the beauty insight requires if it is to be effective, I find no writer on Buddhism surpassing him.” Wendell Berry, Gary Snyder, and Robert Aitken gave encouragement to the reprinting of Pallis’ classic \"Peaks and Lamas\", which Wendell Berry has called, “The best book, in my limited reading, in connecting a form of Buddhism with its sustaining culture. . . . [It is] useful to anybody interested in what a traditional culture is or might be, and how such a culture might preserve itself.”\n\nMarco Pallis “retired to the Heavenly Fields” on 5 June 1989. Writing for the \"Independent\", Peter Talbot Wilcox concludes the obituary of his friend with these words:\n\nIt remains to risk a brief comment: that he was and remains a great teacher . . . who made sense of life and of the life to come; in whose presence insuperable difficulties became less daunting; who took endless troubles to help those who brought their problems to him; someone to whom the spiritual quest in prayer was the one thing needful, who by his own life demonstrated the validity and truth of traditional teachings; and that, however emasculated by modernism, these remain the only valid criteria for those who, as he would put it, have ears to hear. His life was a celebration of “The Marriage of Wisdom and Method”: which is the title of one of his essays.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "19570", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19570", "title": "Midrash", "text": "Midrash\n\nMidrash (; ; pl. \"\") is biblical exegesis by ancient Judaic authorities, using a mode of interpretation prominent in the Talmud. The term is also used of a rabbinic work that interprets Scripture in that manner.\n\nSuch works contain early interpretations and commentaries on the Written Torah and Oral Torah (spoken law and sermons), as well as non-legalistic rabbinic literature (') and occasionally Jewish religious laws ('), which usually form a running commentary on specific passages in the Hebrew Scripture (\"\"). \n\n\"Midrash\", especially if capitalized, can refer to a specific compilation of these rabbinic writings composed between 400 and 1200 CE.\n\nAccording to Gary Porson and Jacob Neusner, \"midrash\" has three technical meanings: 1) Judaic biblical interpretation; 2) the method used in interpreting; 3) a collection of such interpretations.\n\nThe Hebrew word \"midrash\" is derived from the root of the verb \"darash\" (), which means \"resort to, seek, seek with care, enquire, require\", forms of which appear frequently in the Bible.\n\nThe word \"midrash\" occurs twice in the Hebrew Bible: 2 Chronicles 13:22 \"in the \"midrash\" of the prophet Iddo\", and 24:27 \"in the \"midrash\" of the book of the kings\". KJV and ESV translate the word as \"story\" in both instances; the Septuagint translates it as βιβλίον (book) in the first, as γραφή (writing) in the second. The meaning of the Hebrew word in these contexts is uncertain: it has been interpreted as referring to \"a body of authoritative narratives, or interpretations thereof, concerning historically important figures\" and seems to refer to a \"book\", perhaps even a \"book of interpretation\", which might make its use a foreshadowing of the technical sense that the rabbis later gave to the word.\n\nSince the early Middle Ages the function of much of midrashic interpretation has been distinguished from that of \"peshat\", straight or direct interpretation aiming at the original literal meaning of a scriptural text.\n\nA definition of \"midrash\" repeatedly quoted by other scholars is that given by Gary G. Porton in 1981: \"a type of literature, oral or written, which stands in direct relationship to a fixed, canonical text, considered to be the authoritative and revealed word of God by the midrashist and his audience, and in which this canonical text is explicitly cited or clearly alluded to\".\n\nLieve M. Teugels, who would limit midrash to rabbinic literature, offered a definition of midrash as \"rabbinic interpretation of Scripture that bears the lemmatic form\", a definition that, unlike Porton's, has not been adopted by others. While some scholars agree with the limitation of the term \"midrash\" to rabbinic writings, others apply it also to certain Qumran writings, to parts of the New Testament, and of the Hebrew Bible (in particular the superscriptions of the Psalms, Deuteronomy, and Chronicles), and even modern compositions are called midrashim.\n\nMidrash is now viewed more as method than genre, although the rabbinic midrashim do constitute a distinct literary genre.\n\nAccording to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, \"Midrash was initially a philological method of interpreting the literal meaning of biblical texts. In time it developed into a sophisticated interpretive system that reconciled apparent biblical contradictions, established the scriptural basis of new laws, and enriched biblical content with new meaning. Midrashic creativity reached its peak in the schools of Rabbi Ishmael and Akiba, where two different hermeneutic methods were applied. The first was primarily logically oriented, making inferences based upon similarity of content and analogy. The second rested largely upon textual scrutiny, assuming that words and letters that seem superfluous teach something not openly stated in the text.\"\n\nMany different exegetical methods are employed in an effort to derive deeper meaning from a text. This is not limited to the traditional thirteen textual tools attributed to the Tanna Rabbi Ishmael, which are used in the interpretation of \"halakha\" (Jewish law). The presence of words or letters which are seen to be apparently superfluous, and the chronology of events, parallel narratives or what are seen as other textual \"anomalies\" are often used as a springboard for interpretation of segments of Biblical text. In many cases, a handful of lines in the Biblical narrative may become a long philosophical discussion\n\nJacob Neusner distinguishes three midrash processes:\n\nNumerous Jewish midrashim previously preserved in manuscript form have been published in print, including those denominated as smaller or minor midrashim. Bernard H. Mehlman and Seth M. Limmer deprecate this usage on the grounds that the term \"minor\" seems judgmental and \"small\" is inappropriate for midrashim some of which are lengthy. They propose instead the term \"medieval midrashim\", since the period of their production extended from the twilight of the rabbinic age to the dawn of the Age of Enlightenment.\n\nGenerally speaking, rabbinic midrashim either focus on religious law and practice (\"halakha\") or interpret biblical narrative in relation to non-legal ethics or theology, creating homilies and parables based on the text. In the latter case they are described as \"aggadic\". \n\n\"Midrash halakha\" is the name given to a group of tannaitic expositions on the first four books of the Hebrew Bible. These midrashim, written in Mishnahic Hebrew, clearly distinguish between the Biblical texts that they discuss, and the rabbinic interpretation of that text. They often go well beyond simple interpretation and derive or provide support for halakha. This work is based on pre-set assumptions about the sacred and divine nature of the text, and the belief in the legitimacy that accords with rabbinic interpretation. \n\nAlthough this material treats the biblical texts as the authoritative word of God, it is clear that not all of the Hebrew Bible was fixed in its wording at this time, as some verses that are cited differ from the Masoretic, and accord with the Septuagint, or Samaritan Torah instead. \n\nWith the growing canonization of the contents of the Hebrew Bible, both in terms of the books that it contained, and the version of the text in them, and an acceptance that new texts could not be added, there came a need to produce material that would clearly differentiate between that text, and rabbinic interpretation of it. By collecting and compiling these thoughts they could be presented in a manner which helped to refute claims that they were only human interpretations. The argument being that by presenting the various collections of different schools of thought each of which relied upon close study of the text, the growing difference between early biblical law, and its later rabbinic interpretation could be reconciled.\n\nMidrashim which seek to explain the non-legal portions of the Hebrew Bible are sometimes referred to as \"aggadah\" or \"haggadah\".\n\nAggadic discussions of the non-legal parts of Scripture are characterized by a much greater freedom of exposition than the halakhic midrashim (midrashim on Jewish law). Aggadic expositors availed themselves of various techniques, including sayings of prominent rabbis. These aggadic explanations could be philosophical or mystical disquisitions concerning angels, demons, paradise, hell, the messiah, Satan, feasts and fasts, parables, legends, satirical assaults on those who practice idolatry, etc.\n\nSome of these midrashim entail mystical teachings. The presentation is such that the midrash is a simple lesson to the uninitiated, and a direct allusion, or analogy, to a mystical teaching for those educated in this area.\n\nAn example of a midrashic interpretation:\n\n\n\n\nA wealth of literature and artwork has been created in the 20th and 21st centuries by people aspiring to create \"contemporary midrash\". Forms include poetry, prose, Bibliodrama (the acting out of Bible stories), murals, masks, and music, among others. The Institute for Contemporary Midrash was formed to facilitate these reinterpretations of sacred texts. The institute hosted several week-long intensives between 1995 and 2004, and published eight issues of \"Living Text: The Journal of Contemporary Midrash\" from 1997 to 2000.\n\nAccording to Carol Bakhos, recent studies that use literary-critical tools to concentrate on the cultural and literary aspects of midrash have led to a rediscovery of the importance of these texts for finding insights into the rabbinic culture that created them. Midrash is increasingly seen as a literary and cultural construction, responsive to literary means of analysis.\n\nFrank Kermode has written that midrash is an imaginative way of \"updating, enhancing, augmenting, explaining, and justifying the sacred text\". Because the Tanakh came to be seen as unintelligible or even offensive, midrash could be used as a means of rewriting it in a way that both makes it more acceptable to later ethical standards and renders it less obviously implausible.\n\nJames L. Kugel, in \"The Bible as It Was\" (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1997), examines a number of early Jewish and Christian texts that comment on, expand, or re-interpret passages from the first five books of the Tanakh between the third century BCE and the second century CE. Kugel traces how and why biblical interpreters produced new meanings by the use of exegesis on ambiguities, syntactical details, unusual or awkward vocabulary, repetitions, etc. in the text. As an example, Kugel examines the different ways in which the biblical story that God's instructions are not to be found in heaven (Deut 30:12) has been interpreted. Baruch 3:29-4:1 states that this means that divine wisdom is not available anywhere other than in the Torah. Targum Neophyti (Deut 30:12) and b. Baba Metzia 59b claim that this text means that Torah is no longer hidden away, but has been given to humans who are then responsible for following it.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "19228809", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19228809", "title": "Nakkirar II", "text": "Nakkirar II\n\nNakkirar II, also spelled Nakkeerar, was a medieval Tamil poet from Madurai. He is renowned for his most famous work, the \"Tirumurugatruppadai\". He was also the author of a detailed commentary of another work called \"Iraiyanar Akapporul\". He should not be confused with the Sangam period writer Nakkirar I (c. 250 CE), who composed anthologies like the \"Neṭunalvāṭai\". He is one of the prominent characters in the \"Thiruvilaiyadal Puranam\". The Thiruvilaiyadal episodes of the confrontation of Sundareswarar (Shiva) with Nakkeerar are enacted as a part of the Meenakshi Amman Temple festival traditions of Madurai.\n\nNakkeerar is the author of an epic titled \"Sriharnipuram\" which he composed at the behest of Kulachirai Nayanar, the Prime Minister of the Pandya king Gunapandiyan.\n\nThe \"Thiruvilaiyadal Puranam\" relates an incident involving Nakkeerar's confrontation with Shiva. Once the Pandiyan king had a doubt as to whether the scent from a woman's hair was natural or artificial. He announced a prize of 1000 gold coins for anyone to resolve his doubt. A poor poet named Tharumi prayed to Lord Shiva to make him get the award. The Lord, who appeared in the form of a Tamil scholar, gave a poem to the poet and asked him to take it to the King. When this poem was read in the court, Poet Nakkeerar found fault with it and stopped the Pandiyan king from giving the prize. Tharumi's grief grew and he again appealed to the Lord. He said he was not worried for not receiving the prize but he could not bear anyone finding fault with the Lord's poems. Thereupon, Shiva himself came to the court as Iraiyanar and challenged Nakkeerar. But Nakkeerar was not moved. Though Shiva asked him if the hair of Ganapoongodai, the consort of Kalathinathar, whom Nakkeerar worshipped, did not have a natural scent, Nakkeerar asserted that it was so. Shiva told that because of Nakkeerar's foolishness he had done so (since Parvathy is the other part of the supreme god who dwells in everything including flowers, so it is understood that she can possess fragrance as well as other attributes of the universe) and opened the eye in his forehead (Netrikkan) which emitted fire and looked at Nakkeerar to show the poet who he was. Even then, Nakkeerar persisted in his statement. As he could not bear the scorching heat emanating from the divine eye he jumped into the water of the Golden Lotus Tank. Then at the request of the other poets, the Lord took Nakkeerar out of the tank, forgave him and made him study under 'Agasthiar', the Tamil Sage. Shiva said that there were mistakes in Nakkeerar's poetry. He asked Nakkeerar to correct his Tamil grammatical mistakes and misplaced words before writing poems again.\n\nThe episode involving Nakkeerar and the Hindu god Shiva was depicted in the Tamil film \"Thiruvilayadal\" which was based on the stories of the \"Thiruvilaiyadal Puranam\". The role of Nakkeerar was played by the director of the movie, A. P. Nagarajan, himself. \n\n"}

Three spherical space-bodies hover in front of them, two of which are shaped like falling, burning meteorites. The painting is the first oil painting by Paalen, that is artfully based on his surrealist technique of Fumage. It explores the theme of mortal fears and primordial femininity with a hermetical iconography. The painting is actually in a private collection.\n\nPaalen started to work on this picture during the first two weeks of October 1936 after a severe psychogenic crisis. In August 1936, he had to learn that a prolonged affair of Pablo Picasso with his wife Alice (Alice Rahon) had led to a pregnancy and abortion. Paalen later commented on the depressions which he could finally channel into a proper furor of creation resulting in some of his best works of the surrealist period: \"It was as if the fire, or the germ to it, collapsed into itself, and in its place all that is terrible comes to the fore. During the day I can hardly think out of rage, leeriness or guilt, let alone talk with anyone. At night I am dying of fear, everything could be shattered. Peace is such a distant notion, hardly recognizable during those dark days. Perhaps it will be painting that pulls me out of these blows of frightful darkness and can put together the few stones that I no longer find in the empty world. And if this does not work, at least I know for sure that it is not about to have an ego, but only to listen the call to life when faced with absolute nothingness. My vision has once more turned inward. I now can say rightly, I contemplate like the old pagan Apollonius, from within.\" Back in Paris after a realigning journey to Greece in October 1936, he began to work on the mysterious picture that would occupy him until the following year and should testimony this fall into the abyss of death almost solemnly described with reference to the mystic Apollonius of Tyana: an apocalyptic landscape dominated by a female deity and falling meteoric planets. \"Pays interdit\" is also the first oil painting in which the Fumage is elaborately worked into the fine crystalline structures of the lower part. Paalen designs his personal model of the permeable surreal soul-image in the form of a fragmented landscape, pulsating with a mixture of feminine mysticism and romantic shudder, reminiscent of pre-Celtic fairies and their cosmic allusions as they are known from the lyrical tradition of Brittany. The poet friend André Breton spoke in view of this prototyp for the later great Fumages from 1937–39 of symbols for a kind of extended inner view: Paalen attempts \"nothing less than to attain total lucidity by effecting the osmosis not only of the visible and visionary, but of all those mysteriously alluring entities that lurk beneath the surface of the creations of \"primitive\" art. (...) Paalen´s secret lies in having succeeded in seeing, in letting us see \"from the inside of the bubble\".\"\n\nStriking in this picture is the colour in the upper part – subtly graded green tones, which look as if painted on gold – and in the lower part a fine execution of expanding crystalline spatial structures, suggestions of mucous membranes and moist inner tissue. The Fumage-spots are only visible in some places like black holes. The arm- and legless stone figure with its balloon-shaped body parts – belly, breasts and head – was biographically interpreted as a mythologized portrait of the friend Eva Sulzer, to whom Paalen refuged during the crisis with his wife: as a kind of Eva of the future, a woman, which was not born, but owes its life directly to the divine forces. Even unintentionally, she embodies the navel of the world where the past and the future are touching, a unity of womb, uterus and mother, or as James Joyce described it: \"Heva. Naked Eva. She had no navel. Look.\" Paalen had previously visited the oracle in Delphi with its Omphalos, the rounded, symbolic stone column for the navel of the world, that reportedly fell from the sky as a meteorite triggered by lightning and subsequently used as a sacrificial stone altar of the goddess Gaia. Delphi is devoted to the earth goddess Gaia (from \"delphos\" – Greek womb), and with her oracle, once reconfigured by the female priestess Pythia, was surely one of the dream places on the inner map of the artist, looking for deep symbols for birth and linguistic forms for an original femininity communicating directly from the uterus. Paalen's friend, the German writer Gustav Regler, spoke in view of the image of his \"realm of Amazons\": \"On a planet, that is circling around the great streets, quietly and musingly, lies the realm. (...) Far from there, he speaks to women, as if they belonged to his distant stars. (...) And he calls one queen, since she can not hide herself; Her tall figure turnes every branch of a tree under which she stands, into a floriferous homage, she looks to the mountains, as if they were her palaces; Shores are for her the strips of blessed amalgamation with the sun. The sea receives her like a repatriate, every time she betrays the shore, and it seems as if she were now living in the element that breathes on the pulse of the stars; (...) / time is to him invasion of space / and is to be measured according to the number of comets that hit upon her element, that made her visible and luminous, that consumed and nourished her. But the gods are creatures of these rustling streams, fragments of the falling stars, (...) His feeling that we are always on the brink of infinity, that the abyss accompanies us as a faithful shadow. (...) like meteors in the desert.\" The fertility symbolism of the figure and the larger, transparent one of the three spheres with the enclosed allusions for earth, femininity, erosion and an enfolding pre-birth space stand together in a compositional harmony, hieratically floating in front of the impenetrable thicket of the terrestrial abyss. The idea of the meteorite attacks had perhaps come from the reading of Camille Flammarion's visionary novel \"La Fin du Monde\" in which Eve was destined to contemplate the dying earth after a meteorite impact until her own icing.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "962308", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=962308", "title": "Peter Sloterdijk", "text": "Peter Sloterdijk\n\nPeter Sloterdijk (; ; born 26 June 1947) is a German philosopher and cultural theorist. He is a professor of philosophy and media theory at the University of Art and Design Karlsruhe. He co-hosted the German television show \"Im Glashaus: Das Philosophische Quartett\" from 2002 until 2012.\n\nSloterdijk's father was Dutch, his mother German. He studied philosophy, German studies and history at the University of Munich and the University of Hamburg from 1968 to 1974. In 1975 he received his PhD from the University of Hamburg. In the 1980s he worked as a freelance writer, and published his \"Kritik der zynischen Vernunft\" in 1983. He has since published a number of philosophical works acclaimed in Germany. In 2001 he was named chancellor of the University of Art and Design Karlsruhe, part of the Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe. His best-known Karlsruhe student and former assistant is MdB (Member of German Parliament) Dr Marc Jongen. In 2002 Sloterdijk began to co-host \"Im Glashaus: Das Philosophische Quartett\" (\"In the Glass House: The Philosophical Quartet\"), a show on the German ZDF television channel devoted to discussing key contemporary issues in-depth.\n\nSloterdijk rejects the existence of dualisms—body and soul, subject and object, culture and nature, etc.—since their interactions, \"spaces of coexistence\", and common technological advancement create hybrid realities. Sloterdijk's ideas are sometimes referred to as posthumanism, and seek to integrate different components that have been, in his opinion, erroneously considered detached from each other. Consequently, he proposes the creation of an \"ontological constitution\" that would incorporate all beings—humans, animals, plants, and machines.\n\nIn the style of Nietzsche, Sloterdijk remains convinced that contemporary philosophers have to think dangerously and let themselves be \"kidnapped\" by contemporary \"hyper-complexities\": they must forsake our present humanist and nationalist world for a wider horizon at once ecological and global.\nSloterdijk's philosophical style strikes a balance between the firm academicism of a scholarly professor and a certain sense of anti-academicism (witness his ongoing interest in the ideas of Osho, of whom he became a disciple in the late seventies). Taking a sociological stance, Andreas Dorschel sees Sloterdijk's timely innovation at the beginning of the 21st century in having introduced the principles of celebrity into philosophy. Sloterdijk himself, viewing exaggeration to be required in order to catch attention, describes the way he presents his ideas as \"hyperbolic\" (\"hyperbolisch\").\n\nThe \"Kritik der zynischen Vernunft\", published by Suhrkamp in 1983 (and in English as \"Critique of Cynical Reason\", 1988), became the best-selling work on philosophy in the German language since the Second World War and launched Sloterdijk's career as an author.\n\nThe trilogy \"Spheres\" is the philosopher's magnum opus. The first volume was published in 1998, the second in 1999, and the last in 2004.\n\nThe trilogy is notoriously erudite in its scope, but Sloterdijk is aware his books are not for everyone. This becomes clear in the introduction to the trilogy, where Sloterdijk writes about Plato's academy which allegedly denied anyone access who was not a mathematician, or a very precise scientist. However, to make clear that his book was written out of love for humanity and to find common ground, he cites the other rule of Plato's academy: anyone had to stay out who was not willing to enter into love affairs with other students. To underline this he notes that \"whomever turns away from Eros deprives himself of the vital form.\" Aside from that his writings were conceived because of his love for philosophy, which he regards highly, as the best thing there is even: \"If philosophy is regarded as something exclusive it's only because people deny for themselves the best\". And lastly the books were written to express his rich and detailed worldview succinctly, hoping it would enable others to enrich their own: \"The boundaries of what I'm able to express (or: of what I'm able to transmit) are the boundaries of my world. [...] If I were to keep anyone away from my trilogy it would only be those who are not willing to transmit (what they have learned or experienced) in order to subsequently lessen loneliness.\"\n\n\"Spheres\" is about \"spaces of coexistence\", spaces commonly overlooked or taken for granted that conceal information crucial to developing an understanding of the human. The exploration of these spheres begins with the basic difference between mammals and other animals: the biological and utopian comfort of the mother's womb, which humans try to recreate through science, ideology, and religion. From these microspheres (ontological relations such as fetus-placenta) to macrospheres (\"macro-uteri\" such as nations or states), Sloterdijk analyzes spheres where humans try but fail to dwell and traces a connection between vital crisis (e.g., emptiness and narcissistic detachment) and crises created when a sphere shatters.\n\nSloterdijk has said that the first paragraphs of \"Spheres\" are \"the book that Heidegger should have written\", a companion volume to \"Being and Time\", namely, \"Being and Space\". He was referring to his initial exploration of the idea of \"Dasein\", which is then taken further as Sloterdijk distances himself from Heidegger's positions.\n\nSloterdijk also argues that the current concept of globalization lacks historical perspective. In his view it is merely the third wave in a process of overcoming distances (the first wave being the metaphysical globalization of the Greek cosmology and the second the nautical globalization of the 15th century). The difference for Sloterdijk is that, while the second wave created cosmopolitanism, the third is creating a global provincialism. Sloterdijk's sketch of a philosophical history of globalization can be found in \"Im Weltinnenraum des Kapitals\" (2005; translated as \"In the World Interior of Capital\"), subtitled \"Die letzte Kugel\" (\"The final sphere\").\n\nIn his \"Zorn und Zeit\" (translated as \"Rage and Time\"), Sloterdijk characterizes the emotion of rage as a psychopolitical force throughout human history. The political aspects are especially pronounced in the Western tradition, beginning with the opening words of Homer's \"Iliad\", \"Of the rage of Achilles, son of Peleus, sing, O Goddess...\". Sloterdijk acknowledges the contributions of psychoanalysis for our understanding of strong emotional attitudes: \"In conformity with its basic erotodynamic approach, psychoanalysis brought much hatred to light, the other side of life.\" (\"Rage and Time\", p. 14) Importantly, for Sloterdijk, Judeo-Christian conceptions of God ultimately \"piggyback\" on the feelings of rage and resentment, creating \"metaphysical revenge banks\". For Sloterdijk, \"God thus becomes the location of a transcendent repository of suspended human rage-savings and frozen plans of revenge.\" \n\nShortly after Sloterdijk conducted a symposium on philosophy and Heidegger, he stirred up controversy with his essay \"Regeln für den Menschenpark\" (\"Rules for the Human Park\"). In this text, Sloterdijk regards cultures and civilizations as \"anthropogenic hothouses,\" installations for the cultivation of human beings; just as we have established wildlife preserves to protect certain animal species, so too ought we to adopt more deliberate policies to ensure the survival of Aristotle's \"zoon politikon\".\n\n\"The taming of man has failed\", Sloterdijk laments. \"Civilisation's potential for barbarism is growing; the everyday bestialisation of man is on the increase.\"\n\nBecause of the eugenic policies of the Nazis in Germany's recent history, such discussions are seen in Germany as carrying a sinister load. Breaking a German taboo on the discussion of genetic manipulation, Sloterdijk's essay suggests that the advent of new genetic technologies requires more forthright discussion and regulation of \"bio-cultural\" reproduction. In the eyes of Habermas, this made Sloterdijk a \"fascist\". Sloterdijk replied that this was, itself, resorting to \"fascist\" tactics to discredit him.\n\nThe core of the controversy was not only Sloterdijk's ideas but also his use of the German words \"Züchtung\" (\"breeding\", \"cultivation\") and \"Selektion\" (\"selection\"). Sloterdijk rejected the accusation of Nazism, which he considered alien to his historical context. Still, the paper started a controversy in which Sloterdijk was strongly criticized, both for his alleged usage of a fascist rhetoric to promote Plato's vision of a government with absolute control over the population, and for committing a non-normative, simplistic reduction of the bioethical issue itself. This second criticism was based on the vagueness of Sloterdijk's position on how exactly society would be affected by developments in genetic science. After the controversy multiplied positions both for and against him, \"Die Zeit\" published an open letter from Sloterdijk to Habermas in which he vehemently accused Habermas of \"criticizing behind his back\" and espousing a view of humanism that Sloterdijk had declared dead.\n\nAnother dispute emerged after Sloterdijk's article \"Die Revolution der gebenden Hand\" (13 June 2009; transl. \"The revolution of the giving hand\") in the \"Frankfurter Allgemeine\", one of Germany's most widely read newspapers. There Sloterdijk claimed that the national welfare state is a \"fiscal kleptocracy\" that had transformed the country into a \"swamp of resentment\" and degraded its citizens into \"mystified subjects of tax law\".\n\nSloterdijk opened the text with the famous quote of leftist critics of capitalism (made famous in the 19th century by Proudhon in his \"What Is Property?\") \"Property is theft\", stating, however, that it is nowadays the modern state that is the biggest taker. \"We are living in a fiscal grabbing semi-socialism – and nobody calls for a fiscal civil war.\"\n\nHe repeated his statements and stirred up the debate in his articles titled \"Kleptokratie des Staates\" (transl. \"Kleptocracy of the state\") and \"Aufbruch der Leistungsträger\" (transl. \"Uprising of the performers\") in the German monthly \"Cicero – Magazin für politische Kultur\".\n\nAccording to Sloterdijk, the institutions of the welfare state lend themselves to a system that privileges the marginalized, but relies, unsustainably, on the class of citizens who are materially successful. Sloterdijk's provocative recommendation was that income taxes should be deeply reduced, the difference being made up by donations from the rich in a system that would reward higher givers with social status. Achievers would be praised for their generosity, rather than being made to feel guilty for their success, or resentful of society's dependence on them.\n\nIn January 2010, an English translation was published, titled \"A Grasping Hand – The modern democratic state pillages its productive citizens\", in \"Forbes\" and in the Winter 2010 issue of \"City Journal\".\n\nSloterdijk's 2010 book, \"Die nehmende Hand und die gebende Seite\", contains the texts that triggered the 2009–2010 welfare state dispute.\n\nIn September 2016, Sloterdijk published the e-mail novel \"The Schelling Project\". The semi-autobiographical text contains a self-portrait of the author, appearing as \"Peer Sloterdijk\"; several of Sloterdijk's friends such as Thomas Macho, Siegfried Mauser and Michaela Boenke figure in the novel in slight disguise. Together, so the plot goes, they draft a research proposal to the German Research Funding Agency (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) on the evolution of the female orgasm. To make it look more profound and thus to impress the reviewers, the team fakes a connection of the issue to the metaphysics of the German idealist philosopher Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling. The reviewers, though, see through the mystification and turn down the application. Following the rejection, the team splits and each of its members takes his or her own course. While Sloterdijk's e-mail novel about an academic hoax was rated mediocre in terms of literary quality, it came to be seen more as a political statement, specifically as an attack on gender mainstreaming in 21st century Germany. Critic Elke Schmitter, in a review article for \"Der Spiegel\" under the heading 'Woman as an Old Boys' Joke', described Sloterdijk's text as an anti-feminist pamphlet thinly veiled as a novel. In an interview with \"Süddeutsche Zeitung\" Sloterdijk defended himself against the charges and claimed his attitude towards women to be adoration rather than contempt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "19523293", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19523293", "title": "Preface paradox", "text": "Preface paradox\n\nThe preface paradox, or the paradox of the preface, was introduced by David Makinson in 1965. Similar to the lottery paradox, it presents an argument according to which it can be rational to accept mutually incompatible beliefs. While the preface paradox \"nullifies\" a claim contrary to one's belief, it is opposite to Moore's paradox which \"asserts\" a claim contrary to one's belief.\n\nThe argument runs along these lines:\n\nIt is customary for authors of academic books to include in the preface of their books statements such as \"any errors that remain are my sole responsibility.\" Occasionally they go further and actually claim there are errors in the books, with statements such as \"the errors that are found herein are mine alone.\" \n\n(1) Such an author has written a book that contains many assertions, and has factually checked each one carefully, submitted it to reviewers for comment, etc. Thus, he has reason to believe that each assertion he has made is true. \n\n(2) However, he knows, having learned from experience, that, despite his best efforts, there are very likely undetected errors in his book. So he also has good reason to believe that there is at least one assertion in his book that is not true.\n\nThus, he has good reason, from (1), to rationally believe that each statement in his book is true, while at the same time he has good reason, from (2), to rationally believe that the book contains at least one error. Thus he can rationally believe that the book both does and does not contain at least one error.\n\nIn classical deductive logic, a set of statements is inconsistent if it contains a contradiction. The paradox then arises from the contradiction of the author's belief that all of the statements in his book are correct (1) with his belief that at least one of them is not correct (2). To resolve the paradox, one can attack either the contradiction between statements (1) and (2), or the inconsistency of their conjunction.\n\nProbabilistic perspective may restate the statements in other terms, thus resolving the paradox by making them non-contradictory. Even if the author is 99 % sure each single statement in his book is true (1), there can still be so many statements in the book that the aggregate probability of some of them being false (2) is very high as well. Since the principles of rational acceptance allows the author to accept a very likely statement as true, he may rationally chose to believe in (1). Same principles may make him rationally believe also in (2).\n\nAnother way to resolve the paradox is to reject the inconsistency of both (1) and (2) being true at the same time. This is done by rejecting the conjunction principle, i. e. that belief (or rational belief) in various propositions entails a belief (or rational belief) in their conjunction. Most philosophers intuitively believe the principle to be true, but some (e. g. Kyburg) intuitively believe it to be false. This is similar to Kyburg's solution to the lottery paradox.\n\n"}

{"id": "2088800", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2088800", "title": "Sacred mysteries", "text": "Sacred mysteries\n\nSacred mysteries are the areas of supernatural phenomena associated with a divinity or a religious ideology. Sacred mysteries may be either: \nAlthough the term \"mystery\" is not often used in anthropology, access by initiation or rite of passage to otherwise secret beliefs is an extremely common feature of indigenous religions all over the world.\n\nA mystagogue or hierophant is a holder and teacher of secret knowledge in the former sense above. Whereas, mysticism may be defined as an area of philosophical or religious thought which focuses on mysteries in the latter sense above. \n\nThe mystery religions of antiquity were religious cults which required initiation of an \"initiate\" or new member before they were accepted, and sometimes had different levels of initiation, as well as doctrines which were mysteries in the sense of requiring supernatural explanation. In some, parts of the doctrine were apparently only known to priests. They included the Eleusinian Mysteries, Mithraism, the Cult of Isis, the Cult of Sol Invictus, and the Essenes. Mystery traditions were popular in ancient Greece and during the height of the Roman Empire, and as discussed below, parts of Early Christianity used secrecy in the same way.\n\nAlthough the term is not used equally by all Christian traditions, many if not most basic aspects of Christian theology require a supernatural explanation. To name but a few key examples, these include the nature of the Trinity, the Virgin birth of Jesus, and the Resurrection of Jesus. These are mysteries in the sense that they cannot be explained or apprehended by reason alone.\n\nThe word \"mysterion\" (μυστήριον) is used 27 times in the New Testament. It denotes not so much the meaning of the modern English term \"mystery\", but rather something that is \"mystical\". In the biblical Greek, the term refers to \"that which awaits disclosure or interpretation\". In the Catholic church the Latin term is \"mysterium fidei\", \"mystery of faith\", defined in the Catechism of the Catholic Church (1997) to mean a mystery hidden in God, which can never be known unless revealed by God.\n\nIn the Roman Catholic Church the First Vatican Council re-affirmed the existence of mysteries as a doctrine of Catholic faith as follows: \"If any one say that in Divine Revelation there are contained no mysteries properly so called (\"vera et proprie dicta mysteria\"), but that through reason rightly developed (\"per rationem rite excultam\") all the dogmas of faith can be understood and demonstrated from natural principles: let him be anathema\" (Sess. III, \"De fide et ratione\", can. i). The position, if not the terminology, of other Christian churches is essentially the same.\n\nIn parts of the Early Christian Church, many aspects of Christian theology, including some sacraments and sacramentals, were kept hidden from the pagans—the so-called \"Disciplina arcani\"—lest they become objects of ridicule, and were also introduced gradually to catechumens or new converts. As the Age of Persecution ended, the secrecy was gradually relaxed. But the term continued to be used, and the same word is used in the Eastern Orthodox churches to describe \"mysteries\" and \"sacraments\". This is not usually so in the West, though theologically many aspects of sacraments are recognized as mysteries in the main sense described above, especially (for those churches accepting it) the doctrine of transubstantiation in the Eucharist. Hence Pope Paul VI's papal encyclical of 3 September 1965 on the Eucharist was titled, from its opening words, \"Mysterium fidei\". In the Roman Rite Catholic Mass within or immediately after the formula of consecration of the wine, the celebrant says \"The mystery of faith\". Originally the term \"Mystery\" was used for the sacraments generally in both the East and the West, as shown from the \"Mystagogical Homilies\" of St. Cyril of Jerusalem and the work, \"On the Mysteries\" by St. Ambrose of Milan.\n\nAlthough all the official doctrines of Christian churches have long been fully public, the loosely defined area of Christian thought called Christian mysticism often concerns the contemplation of sacred mysteries and may include the development of personal theories about them, undertaken in the knowledge that they can never be fully apprehended by man.\n\nThe term is used in Eastern Christianity to refer to what the Western Church currently calls Sacraments and Sacramentals, terms which the Western Church has carefully defined in Canon Law. Thus, for instance, the Council of Trent declared there to be \"exactly\" seven sacraments. The Eastern Churches, in contrast, have never defined the Mysteries in such precise terms. And, though the Western Church teaches that the consecrated bread and wine of the Eucharist are one Sacrament, the Divine Liturgy refers to the Eucharist as the \"Mysteries\", in the plural. Orthodox Christians have always received Holy Communion in both species (both the Body and the Blood), and even reserve both in the tabernacle. The Sacred Mysteries can be defined as \"those holy acts through which the Holy Spirit mysteriously and invisibly confers Grace (the saving power of God) upon man\".\n\nThough Orthodox instructional materials may list seven Sacred Mysteries (the same as the Western seven sacraments - Western names in parentheses) - Baptism, Chrismation (Confirmation), Confession (Penance, Reconciliation or Confession), Holy Communion (Eucharist or Holy Communion), Marriage (Holy Matrimony), Ordination (Holy Orders), and Unction (Anointing of the Sick. Archaic: Extreme Unction) - it must be understood that the term is not limited to these seven. As in the West, all faithful men are expected to receive six of the seven listed above, and may or may not receive either marriage or ordination, or both; women may not be received into the priesthood, but may be given monastic orders.\n\nChristian life is centered in the Mystery of the Incarnation of Christ, the union of God and man. However, the redemption of man is not considered to have taken place only in the past, but continues to this day through theosis. The Sacraments, or Sacred Mysteries are the most important means by which the faithful may obtain union with God, provided they are received with faith after appropriate preparation. Christians believe that God is present everywhere and fills all things by his Divine grace, and that all of creation is, in some sense, a \"sacrament\". However, they believe that \"He is more specifically and intensively present in [those] particular and reliable manners which He Himself has established,\" i.e., in the Sacred Mysteries.\n\nIn several other religions, knowledge of some esoteric parts of the doctrine or teachings is reserved only for certain members. This has been a feature of Tantric Buddhism, Hinduism, Catharism, some parts of Shia Islam, and the Druze religion. In traditional Judaism, study of much of the mystical tradition of Kabbalah is reserved for scholars. Esotericism is a strong characteristic of many modern movements such as Rosicrucianism, Theosophy, and Scientology.\n\n\n"}

Built in 1847 and opened in 1848, it served as home for the Victorian poet Gerard Manley Hopkins during his theology studies. In 2002 St Beuno's was categorised as a Grade II* listed building and a Welsh Historic Monument (Denbighshire CC, Record No. 26459).\n\nFollowing the restoration of the English Province of the Society of Jesus in 1803 and the Act of Catholic Emancipation of 1829, St Beuno's College in Tremeirchion, near St Asaph in North Wales, UK, was built in 1848 as a place of study for Jesuits. It was built as a \"theologate\", a place where trainee priests study theology, along the lines of a small Oxbridge college. Up to this time prospective Jesuit priests had studied at Stonyhurst College, near Clitheroe in rural Lancashire and for a short time abroad, but increasing numbers put a strain on the old buildings. In 1846 Fr Randal Lythgoe, the then Superior of the Society in Britain, while visiting a Jesuit parish at Holywell in Flintshire, travelled to see some farm land that the Society owned near Tremeirchion, and immediately decided that this should be the site for a new theologate. In early Victorian days, when epidemics of typhoid and cholera regularly swept towns and cities killing large numbers, the fresh country air of North Wales was considered to provide a suitable environment in which to prepare young men to go and serve in the new industrial towns and cities. It was decided to dedicate the college to a local saint, St Beuno, instead of a saint associated with the Society of Jesus.\n\nThe architect of the building was Joseph Aloysius Hansom, best known for the Hansom cab. The outside walls were made of stone, with Gothic gargoyles and stone carving, and inside are broad corridors and large but simple rooms. Gerard Manley Hopkins, the Jesuit poet who studied at St Beuno's from 1874–77, described the building in a letter to his father, \"It is built of limestone, decent outside, skimping within, Gothic like Lancing College done worse.\"\n\nHansom's St Beuno's enclosed a quadrangle garden. On the west side of the quad there was a basement corridor containing the recreation Room, a schoolroom, two private rooms and the entrance Hall. On the floor above was the library, which looks both inside and out as though it were a chapel (and is a chapel today), the rector's Room and a parlour. On the south side, the tallest side, rising higher than the tower, were three galleries which housed the teachers and the students. On the north side was the refectory with a pulpit for the reader.\n\nWithin 20 years of its being built the College was too small: extra rooms in the attics were added and a new North Wing was built to the left of the Tower, all very much in keeping with Hansom's original design.\n\nIn its early days heating for the lower floor was provided by heat from greenhouse below the west front being channelled into the house. Fresh water was provided from local streams and kept in tanks, which still exist above the terraces, and food was grown locally both in the college's grounds and on the adjacent college farm. The college had its own gas works. There was also a school built for local children.\n\nThe college remained as a theologate until 1926 when the students were moved to Heythrop College in Oxfordshire. It then became a place of study for the last year of Jesuit training, the tertianship. During the Second World War it was a place of refuge to many Jesuit novices who were sent from London during and after the Blitz. After the War it reverted to being a place of tertianship.\n\nFrom 1970 the house had begun to open to religious sisters on first 8-day and then 30-day retreats. During the 1970s, as those engaged in the tertianship became increasingly uneasy living in the countryside, the retreat work grew from strength to strength. In 1980, St Beuno's became a retreat centre.\n\nSt Beuno's has a programme of retreats all the year round, from weekends to 30 days. It also offers courses in Ignatian Spirituality from one to six months' duration.\n\nIn 1862 the College was presented with a medieval cross by a Mr Hynde, who bought it for £5 from the Anglicans at Corpus Christi, Tremeirchion. The Tremeirchion Rood of Grace stood for 140 years on a plinth at the entrance to St Beuno's before being restored and then translated back to Tremeirchion churchyard as a Millennium gift. It now stands beneath the yew under which in the mid-19th century it had been found buried.\n\nIn 1866 the 'Rock Chapel', was built on a wooded hill to the south of St Beuno's. It was designed by a Jesuit student, Ignatius Scoles, who had followed the footsteps of his father, Joseph John Scoles, and trained as an architect before joining the Jesuits to become a priest. He went on to design St Wilfrid's Church in Preston.\n\n"}

His final thesis was developed in Mexico supported by ITESM (Tec de Monterrey, Campus Ciudad de Mexico). He spent a year of his undergraduate career at the QUT in Brisbane, Australia.\n\nGualeni was awarded his Master of Arts in 2008 at the Utrecht School of the Arts. In his thesis, he proposed a hermeneutic model for digital aesthetics inspired by Martin Heidegger's existential phenomenology.\n\nHe obtained his Ph.D. in Philosophy (postphenomenology, philosophy of technology) at the Erasmus University Rotterdam in 2014. His dissertation, titled \"Augmented Ontologies\", analyse virtual worlds in their role as mediators: as interactive, artificial environments where philosophical ideas, world-views, and thought-experiments can be encountered, manipulated, and communicated experientially.\n\nGualeni's work takes place in the intersection between continental philosophy and the design of virtual worlds. Given the practical and interdisciplinary focus of his research - and depending on the topics and the resources at hand - his output takes the form of academic texts and/or of interactive digital experiences. In his articles and essays, he presents computers as instruments to prefigure and design ourselves and our worlds, and as gateways to experience alternative possibilities of being.\n\nIn 2015, Gualeni released the book \"Virtual Worlds as Philosophical Tools: How to Philosophize with a Digital Hammer\" with Palgrave Macmillan. Inspired by postphenomenology and by Martin Heidegger's philosophy of technology, the book attempts to answer questions such as: will experiencing worlds that are not 'actual' change our ways of structuring thought? Can virtual worlds open up new possibilities to philosophize? What does it mean to 'be' in virtual worlds? His contributions to the edited volumes \"Experience Machines: Philosophy in Virtual Worlds\" and \"Towards a Philosophy of Digital Media\" focus on the experiential and existential effects and possibilities disclosed by virtual technologies.\n\nThe central argument of Gualeni's work is that the history of philosophy has, until recently, merely been the history of written thought, and that we are witnessing a technological shift in how philosophy is pursued, valued, and communicated. In that respect, Gualeni argues that digital media can complement and extend the almost exclusively linguistic approach to developing and communicating thought. He considers virtual worlds to be philosophically viable and advantageous in contexts like thought experiments (where we can objectively test and evaluate possible courses of action and corresponding consequences) or in the case of philosophical enquiries concerning non-actual state of affairs and/or non-human phenomenologies.\n\nGualeni, S.

{"id": "16409823", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16409823", "title": "Suscipe", "text": "Suscipe\n\nSuscipe is the Latin word for ‘receive.’ While the term was popularized by St. Ignatius of Loyola, founder of the Society of Jesus, who incorporated it into his \"Spiritual Exercises\" in the early sixteenth century, it goes back to monastic profession, in reciting Psalm 118. This article focuses rather on its popularization through the \"Exercises\" and through the \"Roman Missal\", where it introduces the Canon of the Mass. \n\nThe prayer ‘suscipe’ occurs at the conclusion of the Preparation of the Gifts of the Mass, in anticipation of the transformation to be sought in the Eucharist Prayer. This prayer, translated in the current ritual as “May the Lord accept,” first appeared in Charles the Bald’s (875-877) prayer book. This follows the priest's words: \"Pray, brethren (brothers and sisters), that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God, the almighty Father.\" \n\nThe Latin word ‘suscipio’ is used instead of ‘accipio’ or ‘recipio,’ which in English means ‘receive.’ This is because ‘suscipe’ includes the idea of both receiving and taking up. Christ offered Himself to the Father on the cross and His offering was not only received by the Father, but was also ‘taken up’ by the Father, as indicated by Christ’s resurrection.\n\nIgnatius wrote that ‘spiritual exercises’ is the name given to every way of preparing and disposing one’s soul to rid oneself of all disordered attachments, so that once rid of them one might seek and find the divine will in regard to the disposition of one’s life. The Exercises are a set of meditations and contemplations of the life of Christ to be carried out over a four-week time period, most appropriately on a secluded retreat.\n\nThe Suscipe is not found in any of the four weeks of the Spiritual Exercises, but rather was included by Ignatius as additional material in regards to the “contemplation for attaining love” at the end of the Exercises. In this section, Ignatius speaks of the immeasurable love of God that is bestowed upon all of creation, and then asks what he might offer to such a loving God:\n\nThis is to recall to mind the blessings of creation and redemption, and the special favors I have received.\n\nI will ponder with great affection how much God our Lord has done for me, and how much He has given me of what He possesses, and finally, how much, as far as He can, the same Lord desires to give Himself to me according to His divine decrees.\n\nThen I will reflect upon myself, and consider, according to all reason and justice, what I ought to offer the Divine Majesty, that is, all I possess and myself with it. Thus, as one would do who is moved by great feeling, I will make this offering of myself:\n\nTake, Lord, and Receive\n\nTake, Lord, and receive all my liberty, my memory, my understanding, and my entire will, all that I have and possess. Thou hast given all to me. To Thee, O Lord, I return it. All is Thine, dispose of it wholly according to Thy will. Give me Thy love and Thy grace, for this is sufficient for me.\n\nSuscipe, Domine, universam meam libertatem. Accipe memoriam, intellectum, atque voluntatem omnem. Quidquid habeo vel possideo mihi largitus es; id tibi totum restituo, ac tuae prorsus voluntati trado gubernandum. Amorem tui solum cum gratia tua mihi dones, et dives sum satis, nec aliud quidquam ultra posco. Amen.\n\nLiteral translation: Receive, O Lord, all my liberty. Take my memory, understanding, and entire will. Whatever I have or possess you have given me; I restore it all to you, and surrender it wholly to be governed by your will. Give me love for you alone along with your grace, and I am rich enough, and ask for nothing more.\n\n\" '奉獻身心\n吾主天主，納我自由，\n能力意志，懇請受收；\n我身我靈，承恩隆厚，\n報本思源，虔心奉求。\n盡我所有，由汝支配，\n聖意唯從，力行不悖；\n期望我主，寵愛榮惠，\n我心永潔，更無稀匱。' \"\n\nThe Venerable Mother Catherine McAuley, an Irish nun who founded the Sisters of Mercy in 1831, is also credited with a 'suscipe' prayer. This prayer, also known as the Act of Resignation, is one of many that she wrote but is perhaps her best known prayer.\n\nA version by St. Louis Jesuits co-founder John Foley, SJ, was included in the Earthen Vessels collection in 1974, reissued in 2014.\n\nAmerican liturgical music composer Dan Schutte wrote a setting in 2004, \"These Alone Are Enough\", now published by OCP Publications., Schutte's setting has since been translated into Spanish and Vietnamese, \"These Alone Are Enough/Solo Eso Me Basta/Daang vao Xin\" and is found in most Catholic hymnals and missals.,\n\nA setting of the Ignatian \"Suscipe\" by the British composer Howard Goodall was given its first performance in the Royal Concert Hall, Glasgow, in November 2009, by the choir, orchestra, and gamelan of St Aloysius' College, Glasgow, conducted by Liam Devlin, to whom the work is dedicated, as part of the Jesuit college's 150th anniversary celebrations.\n\nIn the Philippines, the Jesuit Music Ministry has produced several settings of the prayer, with those by Manoling Francisco, SJ, Eduardo Hontiveros, SJ, and Fruto Ramírez, SJ, becoming popular hymns.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "163766", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=163766", "title": "The City of the Sun", "text": "The City of the Sun\n\nThe City of the Sun (; ) is a philosophical work by the Italian Dominican philosopher Tommaso Campanella. It is an important early utopian work. The work was written in Italian in 1602, shortly after Campanella's imprisonment for heresy and sedition. A Latin version was written in 1613–1614 and published in Frankfurt in 1623.\n\nThe book is presented as a dialogue between \"a Grandmaster of the Knights Hospitaller and a Genoese Sea-Captain\". Inspired by Plato's \"Republic\" and the description of Atlantis in \"Timaeus\", it describes a theocratic society where goods, women and children are held in common. It also resembles the City of Adocentyn in the \"Picatrix\", an Arabic grimoire of astrological magic. In the final part of the work, Campanella prophesies—in the veiled language of astrology—that the Spanish kings, in alliance with the Pope, are destined to be the instruments of a Divine Plan: the final victory of the True Faith and its diffusion in the whole world. While one could argue that Campanella was simply thinking of the conquest of the New World, it seems that this prophecy should be interpreted in the light of a work written shortly before \"The City of the Sun\", \"The Monarchy in Spain\", in which Campanella exposes his vision of a unified, peaceful world governed by a theocratic monarchy.\n\nProtected and defended by seven circles of walls, constructed of palaces that serve as dwellings for the citizens, the city is located in a place with an ideal climate, conducive to physical health, and on the slope of a hillside because the air there is lighter and purer. One of the most significant aspects of this community is the distribution of work. Once again Campanella engages in an explicit polemic with Aristotle, who had excluded artisans, peasants and those involved in manual labor from the category of full citizenship and from the highest levels of virtue.\n\nIn the City of the Sun no occupation is vile or base, and all are of equal dignity—in fact, those workers who are required to expend greater effort, such as artisans and builders, receive more praise. Everyone must be acquainted with all lines of work, and then each person practices the one for which he shows the greatest aptitude. They have no servants, and no service is regarded as unworthy. The only thing that they consider to be despicable is idleness, and in this way they come to privilege the dignity of work and to overturn an absurd conception of nobility, linked to inactivity and vice.\n\nThanks to the equal division of labour, it is sufficient for each person to spend only four hours a day working; but it is essential that they all work, because the idleness of one would have repercussions on the profit and the effort of the others. The citizens possess nothing; instead, everything is held in common, from food to houses, from the acquisition of knowledge to the exercise of activities, from honors to amusements, from women to children.\n\nThere are “officials” in charge of the distribution of each thing, who keep an eye out and make sure that this happens justly, but no one can appropriate anything for himself. According to them, possession of a house or a family reinforces “self-love”, with all the dire consequences this generates. They live “like philosophers in common” because they are aware of the negative impact, not only on the social but also on the moral level, of an unequal distribution of goods.\n\nOne of the most spectacular and imaginative aspects of The City of the Sun, which immediately struck its readers, are the painted walls of the city. Apart from enclosing and protecting the city, the walls are also the curtains of an extraordinary theater and the pages of an illustrated encyclopedia of knowledge. The walls of the palaces are painted with images of all the arts and sciences.\n\nStarting with the wall that holds up the columns of the temple and gradually descending in large circles, following the order of the planets from Mercury to Saturn, we encounter illustrations of the heavens and the stars, of mathematical figures, of every country on earth and of all the marvels and secrets of the mineral, vegetable and animal worlds, until we arrive at mankind: on the internal wall of the sixth circle the mechanical arts and their inventors are represented.\n\nCampanella was greatly interested in all ingenious discoveries, and in The City of the Sun he provides many examples of curious inventions, such as vessels able to navigate without wind and without sails, and stirrups that make it possible to guide a horse using only one's feet, leaving one's hands free. On the external wall legislators are depicted; and it is here, in “a place of great honor”—but along with Moses, Osiris, Jove, Mercury and Muhammad—that the Genoese sailor recognizes Christ and the twelve apostles. Knowledge is not enclosed in books kept in separate places such as libraries but is openly on show to everyone's eyes. Visualizing in this manner promotes a quicker, easier and more efficient form of learning, in that it is connected to the art of memory, which underlines the evocative and emotive power of images. From a tender age children run around in this theater of knowledge, appropriately guided and following correct itineraries, so that they learn joyously, as if playing a game, without effort or pain.\n\nIn addition to the community of goods and the painted walls, another characteristic feature of the City of the Sun, one that is more difficult and disconcerting and that Campanella himself describes as “hard and arduous”, is the community of wives. This is the solution adopted by the citizens to the problem of generation. Echoing the teaching of the Pythagorean Ocellus Lucanus, Campanella says that they are amazed that humans are preoccupied by the breeding of horses and dogs while neglecting their own. The act of generation entails a large responsibility of the part of the parents; and if it is exercised in an incorrect manner, it can give rise to a long chain of suffering.\n\nMoreover, there is a close connection between a person's natural “complexion” or character, which is inborn and not afterwards modifiable, and moral virtue, which needs a suitable terrain in order to take root and prosper. Generation should therefore respect precise norms and not be entrusted to chance nor to individual sentiments. The citizens distinguish between love and sex. Affection between men and women, based on friendship and respect more than sexual attraction, is expressed in acts that are far removed from sexuality, such as exchanges of gifts, conversation and dancing. Sexual generation, on the other hand, must obey strict rules regarding the physical and moral qualities of the parents and the choice of a propitious time for conception, determined by an astrologer. Such a union is not the expression of a personal, emotional or passionate relationship, but rather is connected to the social responsibility of generation and to love for the collective community.\n\nThe religious beliefs of the citizenry, even though they include fundamental principles of Christianity (such as the immortality of the soul and divine providence), form a natural religion that establishes a sort of osmosis between the city and the stars. The temple is open and not surrounded by walls. In one of his poems Campanella promises: “I shall make the heavens a temple and the stars an altar”. On the vault of the temple's dome the stars are depicted together with their influence on earthly affairs. The altar, on which are placed a celestial and a terrestrial globe, is in the form of the sun. Prayers are directed toward the heavens. The task of the twenty-four priests, who live in cells located in the highest part of the temple, is to observe the stars and, using astronomical instruments, to take account of all their movements. It is their job to indicate the times most favorable for generation and for agricultural labors, acting in this way as intermediaries between God and human beings.\n\nIn Trento's Civic Library, there is kept a 1602 manuscript of \"The City of the Sun\" (shelf mark BCT1-1538), discovered in 1943 by Italian historian Luigi Firpo. It is considered the most ancient manuscript copy that has survived to present time. The text arrived at the Library through the baron Antonio Mazzetti 's (1781–1841) bequest. He was a book collector and bibliophile and, as written in his will, he donated his book heritage to the Civic Library. \n\nThe manuscript was restored in 1980. It is made of parchment tied on paperboard. It consists of two codicological unities joined together years after their writing: the first is a Venetian historical chronicle from 1297 to 1582, followed by a list of \"Hospedali di Venezia\" (\"Hospitals in Venice\"). At the bottom, it is sewed to a small-sized booklet independently enumerated: it's a copy by anonymous author of \"The City of the Sun\". The transcription is meticulous and there only are a few insignificant mistakes.\n\nIn 2016, the manuscript was uploaded to the digital library Wikisource.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Originally published in three parts between 1898 and 1901, it is considered the first translation of the Bible into modern English. After further revisions based on suggestions from readers, the final version was published in 1904.\n\nThe Twentieth Century New Testament was produced in Britain over a period of 15 years by a group of approximately 20 people. Although they were all fluent in the \"koine\" Greek of the New Testament, the translators were not professional scholars but a varied cross section of society—ministers, housewives, school teachers, railroad workers, and businessmen. However they shared the desire (as the Preface to their work puts it), \"to do for the English nation what has been done already for the people of almost all other countries -- to enable Englishmen to read the most important part of their Bible in that form of their own language which they themselves use.\"\n\nAs the project progressed J. Rendel Harris and Richard Francis Weymouth, two well known scholars of the time, voluntarily advised the group, helping to ensure scholarly integrity. Also, translation was done using the then-cutting edge Westcott and Hort text of the Greek New Testament, further adding to the accuracy of their rendering.\n\nIn a break with most translations, the TCNT arranges the New Testament books in the order scholars believe they were written -- Mark comes before Matthew, for instance. They also include brief introductions before each book. Because of the translators' meticulous attention to the best scholarship of their day, Bruce Metzger concluded that their version still holds up remarkably well today, despite the lapse of over 100 years.\n\nA modern revision of the TCNT called the Open English Bible was released in 2010 as a public domain (Creative Commons CC0 license) work.\n\n"}

In 2003 he met Giovanni Raboni who rewarded him for a poetic composition. His poems were recited by the actor Walter Maestosi.\n\nHe developed the existential themes of mysticism, both in the Western philosophical and religious tradition and in the Vaishnava Bhakti one; in the essay “Lo yoga devozionale indiano” (The Indian devotional yoga) he explains the social importance of the spirituality as existential journey rather than as institutionalized dogma. From a sociological point of view his analysis focused on the origins of the ancient Vedic culture; in his essay about Varna he shows how the ills of modern society derive from the break with the great traditional civilizations; therefore the historical and epistemological paradigms have to be rethought in the light of the ancient wisdom. Furthermore, he investigated on the origins of Christianity, inspired by the work of Mario Canciani, identifying lost lifestyles and teachings. Bellucci proposes a critical recovery of ancient civilizations whose knowledges have a considerable social and individual value. His historical and sociological analyzes lead him to consider modernity as a mystification, a kind of collective self-deception that the society cultivates since the atheist and materialist Enlightenment; this mystification derives from an a priori rejection of the sacred, the divine, in order to follow the idols of technic and advanced capitalism. In this sense his investigation continues following in the footsteps of scholars as Jean Servier and Marcel de Corte.\n\n"}
{"id": "185441", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=185441", "title": "Veneration", "text": "Veneration\n\nVeneration (Latin \"veneratio\" or \"dulia\", Greek δουλεία, \"douleia\"), or veneration of saints, is the act of honoring a saint, a person who has been identified as having a high degree of sanctity or holiness. Angels are shown similar veneration in many religions. Philologically, \"to venerate\" derives from the Latin verb, \"venerare\", meaning to regard with reverence and respect. Veneration of saints is practiced, formally or informally, by adherents of some branches of all major religions, including Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism, Islam, and Buddhism.\n\nWithin Christianity, veneration is practiced by groups such as the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Roman Catholic, and Eastern Catholic Churches, all of which have varying types of canonization or glorification procedures. In the Catholic and Orthodox Churches, veneration is shown outwardly by respectfully bowing or making the sign of the cross before a saint's icon, relics, or statue, or by going on pilgrimage to sites associated with saints. In general, veneration is not practiced by Protestants.\n\nHinduism has a long tradition of veneration of saints, expressed toward various gurus and teachers of sanctity, both living and dead. Branches of Buddhism include formal liturgical worship of saints, with Mahayana Buddhism classifying degrees of sainthood.\n\nIn Islam, veneration of saints is practiced by many of the adherents of traditional Sunni Islam (Sunni Sufis, for example) and Shia Islam, and in many parts of places like Turkey, Egypt, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. Other sects, such as Wahhabists etc., abhor the practice.\n\nIn Judaism, there is no classical or formal recognition of saints, but there is a long history of reverence shown toward biblical heroes and martyrs. In some regions, for example within Judaism in Morocco, there is a long and widespread tradition of saint veneration.\n\nBoth main branches of Buddhism, Theravada and Mahayana, recognize those who have achieved a high degree of enlightenment as an Arhat. Mahayana Buddhism particularly gives emphasis to the power of saints to aid ordinary people on the path to enlightenment. Those who have reached enlightenment, and have delayed their own complete enlightenment in order to help others, are called Bodhisattvas. Mahayana Buddhism has formal liturgical practices for venerating saints, along with very specific levels of sainthood. Tibetan Buddhists venerate especially holy lamas, such as the Dalai Lama, as saints.\n\nVeneration towards those who were considered holy began in early Christianity, with the martyrs first being given special honor. Official church commemoration of saints in Rome beginning as early as the third century. Over time, the honor also began to be given to those Christians who lived lives of holiness and sanctity. Various denominations venerate and determine saints in different ways, with some having a formal canonization or glorification process. It is also the first step to becoming a saint. \nIn Roman Catholic and Orthodox theology, veneration is a type of honor distinct from the adoration due to God alone. According to Mark Miravelle of Franciscan University of Steubenville, the English word \"worship\" has been associated with both veneration and adoration:\n\nAs St. Thomas Aquinas once explained, adoration, which is known as latria in classical theology, is the worship and homage that is rightly offered to God alone. It is the manifestation of submission, and acknowledgement of dependence, appropriately shown towards the excellence of an uncreated divine person and to his absolute Lordship. It is the worship of the Creator that God alone deserves. Although we see in English a broader usage of the word “adoration” which may not refer to a form of worship exclusive to God—for example, when a husband says that he “adores his wife”—in general it can be maintained that adoration is the best English denotation for the worship of latria.\n\nVeneration, known as dulia in classical theology, is the honor and reverence appropriately due to the excellence of a created person. Excellence exhibited by created beings likewise deserves recognition and honor. We see a general example of veneration in events like the awarding of academic awards for excellence in school, or the awarding of olympic medals for excellence in sports. There is nothing contrary to the proper adoration of God when we offer the appropriate honor and recognition that created persons deserve based on achievement in excellence.\n\nWe must make a further clarification regarding the use of the term “worship” in relation to the categories of adoration and veneration. Historically, schools of theology have used the term “worship” as a general term which included both adoration and veneration. They would distinguish between “worship of adoration” and “worship of veneration.” The word “worship” (in a similar way to how the liturgical term “cult” is traditionally used) was not synonymous with adoration, but could be used to introduce either adoration or veneration. Hence Catholic sources will sometimes use the term “worship” not to indicate adoration, but only the worship of veneration given to Mary and the saints.\nChurch theologians have long adopted the terms \"latria\" for the type of worship due to God alone, and \"dulia\" and \"proskynesis\" for the veneration given to angels, saints, relics and icons. Catholic and Orthodox theologies also include the term hyperdulia for the type of veneration specifically paid to Mary, mother of Jesus, in Catholic and Orthodox traditions. This distinction is spelled out in the dogmatic conclusions of the Seventh Ecumenical Council (787), which also decreed that iconoclasm, i.e. forbidding icons and their veneration, a dogma central to the Iconoclastic controversy, is a heresy that amounts to a denial of the incarnation of Jesus.\n\nNow, the Roman Catholic tradition has a well established philosophy for the veneration of the Virgin Mary via the field of Mariology with Pontifical schools such as the Marianum specifically devoted to this task.\n\nIn Protestant churches, veneration is sometimes considered to amount to the heresy of idolatry, and the related practice of canonization amounts to the heresy of apotheosis. Protestant theology usually denies that any real distinction between veneration and worship can be made, and claims that the practice of veneration distracts the Christian soul from its true object, the worship of God. In his \"Institutes of the Christian Religion\", John Calvin writes that \"(t)he distinction of what is called \"dulia\" and \"latria\" was invented for the very purpose of permitting divine honours to be paid to angels and dead men with apparent impunity\".\n\nHinduism has a longstanding and living tradition of reverence toward saints, with the line often blurring between humanity and divinity with some Hindu deities. The bhakti movements helped to popularize the veneration of saints and gurus as models showing the way to liberation.\n\nIslam has had a rich history of veneration of saints (often called \"wali\", which literally means \"Friend [of God]\"), which has declined in some parts of the Islamic world in the twentieth century due to the influence of the various streams of Salafism. In Sunni Islam, the veneration of saints became a very common form of religious celebration early on, and saints came to be defined in the eighth-century as a group of \"special people chosen by God and endowed with exceptional gifts, such as the ability to work miracles.\" The classical Sunni scholars came to recognize and honor these individuals as venerable people who were both \"loved by God and developed a close relationship of love to Him.\" \"Belief in the miracles of saints (\"karāmāt al-awliyāʾ\") ... [became a] requirement in Sunni Islam [during the classical period],\" with even medieval critics of the ubiquitous practice of grave visitation like Ibn Taymiyyah emphatically declaring: \"The miracles of saints are absolutely true and correct, and acknowledged by all Muslim scholars. The Quran has pointed to it in different places, and the sayings of the Prophet have mentioned it, and whoever denies the miraculous power of saints are innovators or following innovators.\" The vast majority of saints venerated in the classical Sunni world were the Sufis, who were all Sunni mystics who belonged to one of the one of the four orthodox legal schools of Sunni law. \n\nVeneration of saints eventually became one of the most widespread Sunni practices for more than a millennium, before it was opposed in the twentieth century by the Salafi movement, whose various streams regard it as \"being both un-Islamic and backwards ... rather than the integral part of Islam which they were for over a millennium.\" In a manner similar to the Protestant Reformation, the specific traditional practices which Salafism has tried to curtail in both Sunni and Shia contexts include those of the veneration of saints, visiting their graves, seeking their intercession, and honoring their relics. As Christopher Taylor has remarked: \"[Throughout Islamic history] a vital dimension of Islamic piety was the veneration of Muslim saints…. [due, however to] certain strains of thought within the Islamic tradition itself, particularly pronounced in the nineteenth and the twentieth centuries ... [some modern day] Muslims have either resisted acknowledging the existence of Muslim saints altogether or have viewed their presence and veneration as unacceptable deviations.\"\n\nWhile orthodox and organized Judaism do not countenance the veneration of saints per se, veneration and pilgrimage to burial sites of holy Jewish leaders is an ancient part of the tradition.\n\nToday it is common for some Jews to visit the graves of many righteous Jewish leaders. The tradition is particularly strong among Moroccan Jews, and Jews of Sephardi descent, although also by some Ashkenazi Jews as well. This is particularly true in Israel, where many holy Jewish leaders are buried. The Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron, Rachel's Tomb in Bethlehem and that of Maimonides in Tiberius are examples of burial sites that attract large pilgrimages in Israel. In America, the only such example is the grave site of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, at the Ohel, in the cemetery in Queens where he is buried alongside his father-in-law. During his lifetime, Schneerson himself would frequently visit the gravesite (Ohel) of his father-in-law, where he would read letters and written prayers, and then place them on the grave. Today visitors to the grave of Schneerson include Jews of Orthodox, Reform and Conservative background, as well as non-Jews. Visitors typically recite prayers of psalms and bring with them petitions of prayers written on pieces of paper which are then torn and left on the grave.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "275574", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=275574", "title": "Will Durant", "text": "Will Durant\n\nWilliam James \"Will\" Durant (; November 5, 1885 – November 7, 1981) was an American writer, historian, and philosopher. He became best known for his work \"The Story of Civilization\", 11 volumes written in collaboration with his wife, Ariel Durant, and published between 1935 and 1975. He was earlier noted for \"The Story of Philosophy\" (1926), described as \"a groundbreaking work that helped to popularize philosophy\".\n\nHe conceived of philosophy as total perspective or seeing things \"sub specie totius\" (a phrase inspired by Spinoza's \"sub specie aeternitatis\"). He sought to unify and humanize the great body of historical knowledge, which had grown voluminous and become fragmented into esoteric specialties, and to vitalize it for contemporary application.\n\nThe Durants were awarded the Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction in 1968 and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1977.\n\nDurant was born in North Adams, Massachusetts, to French-Canadian Catholic parents Joseph Durant and Mary Allard, who had been part of the Quebec emigration to the United States.\n\nIn 1900, Durant was educated by the Jesuits in St. Peter's Preparatory School and, later, Saint Peter's College in Jersey City, New Jersey. Historian Joan Rubin writes of that period, \"Despite some adolescent flirtations, he began preparing for the vocation that promised to realize his mother's fondest hopes for him: the priesthood. In that way, one might argue, he embarked on a course that, while distant from Yale's or Columbia's apprenticeships in gentility, offered equivalent cultural authority within his own milieu.\"\n\nIn 1905, he began experimenting with socialist philosophy, but, after World War I, he began recognizing that a \"lust for power\" underlay all forms of political behavior. However, even before the war, \"other aspects of his sensibility had competed with his radical leanings,\" notes Rubin. She adds that \"the most concrete of those was a persistent penchant for philosophy. With his energy invested in Baruch Spinoza, he made little room for the Russian anarchist Mikhail Bakunin. From then on, writes Rubin, \"his retention of a model of selfhood predicated on discipline made him unsympathetic to anarchist injunctions to 'be yourself.'... To be one's 'deliberate self,' he explained, meant to 'rise above' the impulse to 'become the slaves of our passions' and instead to act with 'courageous devotion' to a moral cause.\"\n\nDurant graduated in 1907. He worked as a reporter for Arthur Brisbane's \"New York Evening Journal\" for 10 dollars a week. At the \"Evening Journal\", he wrote several articles on sexual criminals. In 1907, he began teaching Latin, French, English and geometry at Seton Hall University, South Orange, New Jersey. He was also made librarian there.\n\nIn 1911, he left the seminary. He became the principal of Ferrer Modern School, an advanced school intended to educate the working classes; he also taught there. Alden Freeman, a supporter of the Ferrer Modern School, sponsored him for a tour of Europe. At the Modern School, he fell in love with and married a 15-year-old pupil, Chaya (Ida) Kaufman, whom he later nicknamed \"Ariel\". The Durants had one daughter, Ethel, and adopted a son, Louis.\n\nBy 1914, he began to reject \"intimations of human evil\", notes Rubin, and to \"retreat from radical social change.\" She summarizes the changes in his overall philosophy:\nIn 1913, he resigned his post as teacher. To support themselves, he began lecturing in a Presbyterian church for $5 and $10; the material for the lectures became the starting point for \"The Story of Civilization\".\n\nIn 1917, while working on a doctorate in philosophy at Columbia University, he wrote his first book, \"Philosophy and the Social Problem\". He discussed the idea that philosophy had not grown because it avoided the actual problems of society. He received his doctorate that same year from Columbia. He was also an instructor at the university.\n\n\"The Story of Philosophy\" originated as a series of Little Blue Books (educational pamphlets aimed at workers) and was so popular it was republished in 1926 by Simon & Schuster as a hardcover book and became a bestseller, giving the Durants the financial independence that would allow them to travel the world several times and spend four decades writing \"The Story of Civilization\". Will left teaching and began work on the 11-volume \"Story of Civilization\".\n\nThe Durants strove throughout \"The Story of Civilization\" to create what they called \"integral history.\" They opposed it to the \"specialization\" of history, an anticipatory rejection of what some have called the \"cult of the expert.\" Their goal was to write a \"biography\" of a civilization, in this case, the West, including not just the usual wars, politics and biography of greatness and villainy but also the culture, art, philosophy, religion, and the rise of mass communication. Much of \"The Story\" considers the living conditions of everyday people throughout the 2500 year period that their \"story\" of the West covers. They also bring an unabashedly moral framework to their accounts, constantly stressing the \"dominance of strong over the weak, the clever over the simple.\" \"The Story of Civilization\" is the most successful historiographical series in history. It has been said that the series \"put Simon & Schuster on the map\" as a publishing house. In the 1990s, an unabridged audiobook production of all 11 volumes was produced by Books On Tape read by Alexander Adams (Grover Gardner).\n\nFor \"Rousseau and Revolution\" (1967), the 10th volume of \"The Story of Civilization\", the Durants were awarded the Pulitzer Prize for literature. In 1977, it was followed by one of the two highest awards granted by the United States government to civilians, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, awarded by Gerald Ford.\n\nThe first volume of \"The Story of Civilization\" series, called \"Our Oriental Heritage\" (1935), is divided into an introduction and three books. The introduction takes the reader through the different aspects of civilization (economical, political, moral and mental). Book One is dedicated to the civilizations of the Near East (\"Sumeria\", \"Egypt\", \"Babylonia\", \"Assyria\", \"Judea\" and \"Persia\"). Book two is \"\"India\" and Her Neighbors.\" Book three moves deeper into the east, where the \"Chinese Civilization\" flourishes and \"Japan\" starts to find its place in the world's political map.\n\nOn April 8, 1944, Durant was approached by two leaders of the Jewish and Christian faiths, Meyer David and Christian Richard about starting \"a movement, to raise moral standards.\" He suggested instead that they start a movement against racial intolerance and outlined his ideas for a \"Declaration of Interdependence\". The movement for the declaration, Declaration of INTERdependence, Inc., was launched at a gala dinner at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel on March 22, 1945, attended by over 400 people including Thomas Mann and Bette Davis. The Declaration was read into the \"Congressional Record\" on October 1, 1945, by Ellis E. Patterson.\n\nThroughout his career, Durant made several speeches, including \"Persia in the History of Civilization\", which was presented as an address before the Iran-America Society in Tehran, Iran, on April 21, 1948 and had been intended for inclusion in the \"Bulletin of the Asia Institute\" (formerly, \"Bulletin of the American Institute for Persian\", then \"Iranian, Art and Archaeology\"), Vol. VII, no. 2, which never saw publication.\n\n\"Rousseau and Revolution\" was followed by a slender volume of observations called \"The Lessons of History\", which was both a synopsis of the series as well as analysis.\n\nThough Ariel and Will had intended to carry the work on \"The Story of Civilisation\" into the 20th century, at their now very advanced age they expected the 10th volume to be their last. However, they went on to publish a final volume, their 11th, \"The Age of Napoleon\" in 1975. They also left behind notes for a 12th volume, \"The Age of Darwin\", and an outline for a 13th, \"The Age of Einstein\", which would have taken \"The Story of Civilization\" to 1945.\n\nThree posthumous works by Durant have been published in recent years, \"The Greatest Minds and Ideas of All Time\" (2002), \"Heroes of History: A Brief History of Civilization from Ancient Times to the Dawn of the Modern Age\" (2001), and \"Fallen Leaves\" (2014).\n\nThe Durants also shared an intense love for one another as explained in their \"Dual Autobiography\". After Will entered the hospital, Ariel stopped eating, and died on October 25, 1981. Though their daughter, Ethel, and grandchildren strove to keep Ariel's death from the ailing Will, he learned of it on the evening news, and died two weeks later, at the age of 96, on November 7, 1981. Will was buried beside Ariel in Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery, in Los Angeles.\n\nIn 1933, he published \"Tragedy of Russia: Impressions from a Brief Visit\" and soon afterward \"The Lesson of Russia\". A few years after the books were published, social commentator Will Rogers had read them and described a symposium he had attended that included Durant as one of the contributors. He later wrote of Durant, \"He is just about our best writer on Russia. He is the most fearless writer that has been there. He tells you just what it's like. He makes a mighty fine talk. One of the most interesting lecturers we have, and a fine fellow.\"\n\nIn 1930, he published \"The Case for India\" while he was on a visit to India as part of collecting data for \"The Story of Civilization\". He was so taken aback by the devastating poverty and starvation he saw as a result of British imperial policy in India that he took time off from his stated goal and instead concentrated on his polemic fiercely advocating Indian independence.\n\nDurant fought for equal wages, women's suffrage and fairer working conditions for the American labor force. Durant not only wrote on many topics but also put his ideas into effect. Durant, it has been said widely, attempted to bring philosophy to the common man.\n\nHe was trying to improve understanding of viewpoints of human beings and to have others forgive foibles and human waywardness. He chided the comfortable insularity of what is now known as Eurocentrism by pointing out in \"Our Oriental Heritage\" that Europe was only \"a jagged promontory of Asia\". He complained of \"the provincialism of our traditional histories which began with Greece and summed up Asia in a line\" and said they showed \"a possibly fatal error of perspective and intelligence\".\n\nMuch like Oswald Spengler, he saw the decline of a civilization as a culmination of strife between religion and secular intellectualism, thus toppling the precarious institutions of convention and morality:\nMore than twenty years after his death, a quote from Durant, \"A great civilization is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself within\" appeared as the opening graphic of Mel Gibson's 2006 film \"Apocalypto\". Durant also served as the history consultant for Anthony Mann's 1964 film \"The Fall of the Roman Empire\". The narration at the beginning and the end of the film is taken almost directly from Durant's work \"Caesar and Christ\".\n\nIn an article in 1927, he wrote his thoughts about reconciling religion and Darwinism:\nIn \"Our Oriental Heritage,\" Durant wrote:\nSee a full bibliography at Will Durant Online\n\n\n"}
