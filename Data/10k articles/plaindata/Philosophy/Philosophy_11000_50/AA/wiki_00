{"id": "2759509", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2759509", "title": "A Voyage to Arcturus", "text": "A Voyage to Arcturus\n\nA Voyage to Arcturus is a novel by the English writer David Lindsay, first published in 1920. It combines fantasy, philosophy, and science fiction in an exploration of the nature of good and evil and their relationship with existence. Described by critic and philosopher Colin Wilson as the \"greatest novel of the twentieth century\", it was a central influence on C. S. Lewis' \"Space Trilogy\", and through him on J. R. R. Tolkien, who said he read the book \"with avidity\". Clive Barker called it \"a masterpiece\" and \"an extraordinary work ... quite magnificent.\"\n\nAn interstellar voyage is the framework for a narrative of a journey through fantastic landscapes. The story is set at Tormance, an imaginary planet orbiting Arcturus, which in the novel (but not in reality) is a double star system, consisting of stars Branchspell and Alppain. The lands through which the characters travel represent philosophical systems or states of mind, through which the main character, Maskull, passes on his search for the meaning of life.\n\nThe book sold poorly during Lindsay's lifetime, but was republished in 1946 and many times thereafter. It has been translated into at least ten languages. Critics such as the novelist Michael Moorcock have noted that the book is unusual, but has been highly influential with its qualities of \"commitment to the Absolute\" and \"God-questioning genius\".\n\nDavid Lindsay was born in 1876; his father was a Scottish Calvinist and his mother English. He was brought up in London and Jedburgh in the Scottish borders. He enjoyed reading novels by Walter Scott, Jules Verne, Rider Haggard and Robert Louis Stevenson. He learnt German to read the philosophies of Schopenhauer and Nietzsche. He served in the army in the First World War, being called up at the age of 38. He married in 1916. After the war ended in 1918, he moved to Cornwall with his wife to write.\n\nMaskull, a man longing for adventures, accepts an invitation from Krag, an acquaintance of his friend Nightspore, to travel to Tormance after a seance. The three set off in a crystal ship from an abandoned observatory in Scotland but Maskull awakens to find himself alone on Tormance. In every land he passes through he usually meets only one or two persons; these meetings often (though not always) end in the death of those he meets, either at his own hand or by that of another. He learns of his own impending death, meets Krag again, and dies shortly after learning that he is in fact Nightspore himself. The book concludes with a final revelation from Krag (who claims to be known on Earth as \"Pain\") to Nightspore about the origin of the Universe. The author turns out to support a variation of the doctrine of the Demiurge, somewhat similar to that propounded by some Gnostics.\n\nAll of the characters and lands are types used to convey the author's critique of several philosophical systems. On Tormance, most such viewpoints or ways of life are accompanied by corresponding new bodily sense organs or modifications of the same, thus each distinct Weltanschauung landscape has its corresponding sensorium.\n\nA seance is organised in Hampstead to which Maskull and Nightspore are invited; their late arrival is marked by a supernatural noise. The medium causes a smiling man to materialise. Krag arrives uninvited, kills the apparition by breaking its neck, and summarily calls Maskull and Nightspore (with whom he was acquainted) out to the street.\n\nKrag invites Maskull and Nightspore to come to Tormance, a planet orbiting Arcturus, whence the apparition comes. Maskull initially treats the proposal as a joke, but accepts it when Krag shows him, with a small but strangely heavy and potent lens, that Arcturus consists of two suns. Upon questioning from Nightspore, Krag says that Surtur (unknown to Maskull) has gone ahead and that they must follow him.\n\nMaskull and Nightspore arrive on foot (after travelling by train) at the Scottish observatory of Starkness, where Krag was to meet them, only to find the observatory abandoned. Two bottles are found with \"Solar back rays\" and \"Arcturian back rays\". The first, when accidentally unfastened, flies back to the sun because of the light rays trapped within.\n\nNightspore leads Maskull to a spot on the shore some miles off, where they listen to The Drum Taps of Sorgie, and tells him that if he hears it again he is to \"try always to hear it more and more distinctly.\" Maskull attempts to climb the observatory tower but is unable to go beyond the first of the seven stories because of the heavy gravity. From the first magnifying window he sees Arcturus again. He hears a voice saying that he is but an instrument and that although he will go on the voyage, only Nightspore will return.\n\nNightspore says the gravity in the tower is Tormance's and that Maskull will find death on Tormance. Krag arrives, enables Maskull and Nightspore to resist Tormance's gravity by spitting on a cut in their arms, and the three climb the tower, whose windows no longer magnify. They depart naked in a 'torpedo of crystal' propelled by Arcturian back rays. During the 19-hour voyage, Maskull sleeps.\n\n\nMaskull awakes alone in a desert on Tormance and finds that he has new organs in his body, such as a tentacle (known as a magn) stemming from the heart and protuberances on his forehead and neck. A woman comes to him and exchanges blood with him (making it easier for him to live on Tormance, and harder for her), and says: that she is called Joiwind, her husband Panawe, and both live to the North in Poolingdred; that she understands his speech thanks to a forehead organ, the breve, that reads minds; that Surtur is called Shaping, or Crystalman, and created everything (she also implicitly says that he is God); that they do not eat, out of respect for living things, but drink gnawl water; and that the chest tentacle is used to increase love for other creatures. While journeying home they worship Shaping in a shrine, and meet Panawe upon arrival.\n\nPanawe suggests that Maskull may be \"a man [...] who stole something from the Maker of the universe, in order to ennoble his fellow creatures,\" a reference to the myth of Prometheus. He says that life on Tormance has many different forms because the planet is still new, that human beings resemble earthlings because \"all creatures that resemble Shaping must of necessity resemble one another,\" and that Alppain is visible only to the North. Panawe tells his story to Maskull; he travelled in the Wombflash forest (from where he saw Swaylone's island), Ifdawn Marest, and Poolingdred.\n\nMaskull sets out to further explore Tormance and gets to the Lusion Plain, where he meets a man, named Surtur.\n\nSurtur asserts the beauty of his world, claims Maskull is there to serve him, and disappears. Maskull continues his journey and meets a woman, Oceaxe, from Ifdawn, who instead of a tentacle has a third arm. Although she is peremptory and rude, she shows interest in having him as lover, and gives him a red-glowing stone to convert his magn into a third arm.\n\n\nWhen Maskull wakes up he finds his chest tentacle or magn has been transformed into the third arm, which causes lust for what is touched and his breve changed to an eyelike sorb which allows dominance of will over others. He travels through the volatile and Nietzschean landscape of Ifdawn with Oceaxe, who wants him to kill one of her husbands, Crimtyphon, and take his place. Maskull is revolted at the idea, but does kill Crimtyphon when he sees him using his will to force a man into becoming a tree.\n\nTydomin, another wife of Crimtyphon's, shows up and uses her will to force Oceaxe to commit suicide by walking off a cliff and persuades Maskull to follow her to her home in Disscourn, where she will take possession of his body. On the way they find Joiwind's brother Digrung who says he will tell her everything; to prevent this, and encouraged by Tydomin, Maskull absorbs Digrung, leaving his empty body behind. At Tydomin's cave, he goes out of his body to, anachronistically, become the apparition of the seance where he met Krag, but when he is killed he goes back to his body before Tydomin can possess it, whereupon he awakens free of her mental power.\n\nMaskull takes Tydomin to Sant, to kill her. In Sant no women are allowed, but only men, who go there to follow Hator's doctrine. On the way Maskull and Tydomin meet Spadevil, who proposes to reform Sant by amending Hator's teaching with the notion of duty. He turns Maskull and Tydomin into his disciples by modifying their sorbs into twin membranes called probes.\n\nCatice, the guardian of Hator's doctrine in Sant, who has only one probe, damages one of Maskull's to test Spadevil's arguments. Maskull accepts Hator's ideas and kills Spadevil and Tydomin. Catice says he will leave Sant to meditate on Spadevil's arguments, claims that Shaping is not Surtur, and sends Maskull away to the Wombflash Forest, in search of Muspel, their home.\n\nMaskull awakes in the dense Wombflash Forest with a third eye as his only foreign organ, hears the drumbeat, follows it, and meets Dreamsinter, who tells him that it was Nightspore whom Surtur brought to Tormance and that he, Maskull, is wanted to steal Muspel-light. Maskull then sees a vision in which Krag kills him while Nightspore follows a light, and faints.\n\nMaskull reawakes and proceeds to the shore of the Sinking Sea, from which Swaylone's Island can be seen. There he meets Polecrab, a simple fisherman, who is married to Gleameil.\n\nMaskull goes to Swaylone's Island, where Earthrid plays a musical instrument called Irontick (actually a lake) by night, and from where no one who heard it ever returned. Maskull is accompanied by Gleameil, who has left her family because of the attraction of the music. Earthrid warns Gleameil that the music he plays will kill her, but she stays and promptly dies. Maskull, after entering a trance, forcibly plays the lake, whereupon Earthrid dies, violently dismembered, and Irontick is destroyed.\n\nMaskull crosses the sea by maneuvering a many-eyed, heliotropic tree and reaches Matterplay, where much to his amazement a plethora of life-forms alongside a magical creek materialize and vanish before his eyes. He goes upstream and meets Leehallfae, an immensely old being (\"phaen\") who is neither man nor woman, but of a third sex, who has been seeking the underground country of Threal for eons, where ae [sic] believes a god called Faceny (which may be another name for Shaping) is to be found.\n\nThey reach Threal by entering a cave. Leehallfae promptly falls ill and dies. Corpang appears and says this is because Threal is not Faceny's world, but Thire's. Faceny, Amfuse, and Thire are the creators of three worlds of existence, relation, and feeling. Corpang has come to Threal to follow Thire, and leads Maskull to three statues of these divinities. There Maskull has a vision of their power, and hears a voice saying he is to die in a few hours, after which the statues are seen with faces like a corpse's, showing that they are merely disguises for Shaping/Crystalman. Realising that he has been worshipping false gods, Corpang follows Maskull to Lichstorm, where they hear the drumbeats.\n\nMaskull and Corpang meet Haunte, a hunter who travels in a boat that flies thanks to masculine stones which repel earth's femininity. After Maskull destroys the masculine rocks which protected Haunte from Sullenbode's femininity, all three journey to her cave. Sullenbode, a faceless woman, kills Haunte as they kiss.\n\nMaskull desires Sullenbode and she desires him, thereby becoming alive (without killing him) as long as he loves her. Maskull, Sullenbode and Corpang proceed in the direction someone looking for Muspel once went. As they near their destination, Corpang goes eagerly ahead but Maskull stops, caught in a vision of Muspel-light. His momentary loss of interest and her inability to recall him from his trance causes Sullenbode to die. As the vision fades Maskull discovers Sullenbode and, leaving Corpangs path, proceeds down the mountain to bury Sullenbode.\n\nMaskull, upon waking, discovers Krag again, and then Gangnet, who defends Shaping and his creation. Since Gangnet is unable to send the abusive Krag away, they travel together to the ocean and then take to the sea on a raft. When the sun Alppain rises, Maskull sees in a vision Krag causing the drum beat by beating his heart, and Gangnet, who is Shaping, dying in torment enveloped by Muspel-fire. Back on the raft, Krag tells Maskull that he (Maskull) is Nightspore; then Maskull dies.\n\nKrag and Nightspore arrive at Muspel, where there is a tower similar to that in Starkness (the observatory in Scotland). From the windows of its several stories Nightspore sees that Shaping (the Gnostic demiurge) uses what comes from Muspel to create the world in order that he may feel joy, fragmenting the Muspel matter in the process and producing suffering for all living things. Krag acknowledges that he is Surtur and is known on Earth as pain. Nightspore goes back with him to reincarnate and spread knowledge about Surtur, Shaping, and Muspel.\n\nThe story is set on Tormance, an imaginary planet orbiting the star Arcturus, which, in the novel (but not in reality) is a double star system, consisting of Branchspell, a large yellow sunlike star, and Alppain, a smaller blue star. It is said in the novel to be 100 light-years distant from Earth.\n\nThere is no systematic description of the geography of Tormance; Maskull simply travels from South to North (with a somewhat eastward excursion to the Sant levels). The direction is symbolic: the light of the second sun, Alppain, is seen to the north; the southern countries are illuminated only by Branchspell. Maskull travels always in the direction that puts behind him earthly sights and things, seeking the other world illuminated by Alppain.\n\nThe historian Shimon de Valencia states that the names \"Surtur\" and \"Muspel\" are taken from Surtr, the lord of M√∫spellsheimr (the world of fire) in Norse mythology.\n\nLindsay's choice of title (and therefore the setting in Arcturus) may have been influenced by the nonfictional \"A Voyage to the Arctic in the Whaler Aurora\" (1911), published by his namesake, David Moore Lindsay.\n\nThe novel is recognised for its strangeness. Among the many features of the world of Tormance are its alien sea, with water so dense that it can be walked on, while gnawl water is sufficient food to sustain life on its own. The local spectrum includes two primary colours, \"ulfire\" and \"jale\", unknown on Earth, as well as a third colour, \"dolm\", said to be compounded of ulfire and blue. (Lindsay writes: '[t]he sense impressions caused in Maskull by these two additional primary colors can only be vaguely hinted at by analogy. Just as blue is delicate and mysterious, yellow clear and unsubtle, and red sanguine and passionate, so he felt ulfire to be wild and painful, and jale dreamlike, feverish, and voluptuous.') Tormance people are able to speak to people from Earth, as their ability to read thoughts enables them to understand both meaning and words. The planet itself is entirely un-Earthlike with unique life-forms, such as three-legged animals that spin, and a ten-finned flying animal.\n\nThe sexuality of the Tormance species is ambiguous; Lindsay coined a new gender-specific pronoun series, \"ae\", \"aer\", and \"aerself\" for the phaen who are humanoid but formed of air. The character Panawe who briefly guides Maskull was born male and female, but becomes male when his female component relinquishes life to allow him to live as a male. Maskull himself acquires Tormance organs which give him additional senses including telepathy; these include a tentacle on his chest and a fleshy organ on his forehead that changes into a third eye.\n\nThe novel was a central influence on C. S. Lewis's 1938‚Äì1945 \"Space Trilogy\". Lewis also mentioned the \"sorbing\" (aggressive absorption of another's personality into one's own, fatal to the other person) as an influence on his 1942 book \"The Screwtape Letters\". Lewis in turn recommended the book to J. R. R. Tolkien, who said he read it \"with avidity\".\n\nThe composer John Ogdon wrote an oratorio for soprano, mezzosoprano, tenor and baritone accompanied by choir and piano, \"A Voyage to Arcturus\", in 1984, based on Lindsay's novel and \"biblical quotations\". Ogdon's biographer, Charles Beauclerk, notes that Lindsay was also a composer, and that the novel discusses the \"nature and meaning\" of music. In Beauclerk's view, Ogdon saw Linday's novel as a religious work, where for instance the wild 3-eyed, 3-armed woman Oceaxe becomes Oceania, described in the Bible's Book of Revelation 12 as \"a woman cloth'd with the sun, and the moon under her feet\".\n\nThe critic and philosopher Colin Wilson described \"A Voyage to Arcturus\" as the \"greatest novel of the twentieth century\". Clive Barker stated that \"\"A Voyage to Arcturus\" is a masterpiece\" and called it \"an extraordinary work . . . quite magnificent.\" Philip Pullman named it for \"The Guardian\" as the book he thought was most underrated.\n\nReviewing the book in 2002, the novelist Michael Moorcock asserted that \"Few English novels have been as eccentric or, ultimately, as influential\". He noted that Alan Moore, introducing the 2002 edition, had compared the book to John Bunyan (\"Pilgrim's Progress\", 1678) and Arthur Machen (\"The Great God Pan\", 1890), but that it nevertheless stood \"as one of the great originals\". In Moorcock's view, although Maskull seems to be commanded to do whatever is needed to save his soul, in a kind of \"Nietzschean \"Pilgrim's Progress\"\", Lindsay does not fall into fascism. Like Hitler, Moorcock argued, Lindsay was traumatised by the trench fighting of the First World War, but the \"astonishing and dramatic ambiguity of the novel's resolution\" makes the novel the antithesis of Hitler's \"visionary brutalism\". Moorcock noted that while the book had influenced C. S. Lewis's science fiction trilogy, Lewis had \"refused Lindsay's commitment to the Absolute and lacked his God-questioning genius, the very qualities which give this strange book its compelling, almost mesmerising influence.\"\n\nAlso in 2002, Steven H. Silver, criticising \"A Voyage to Arcturus\" on SF Site, observes that for a novel it has little plot or characterisation, and furthermore that it gives no motives for the actions taken by its characters. In his view, the book's strength lies in its \"philosophical musings\" on humanity after the First World War. Silver compares the book not with later science fiction but with that of H. G. Wells and Jules Verne, \"although with neither author's prose skills.\" He suggests that Lindsay was combining philosophy with an adventure tale in the manner of Edgar Rice Burroughs.\n\nMethuen agreed to publish the novel, but only if Lindsay agreed to cut 15,000 words, which he did. These passages are assumed lost forever. Methuen also insisted on a change of title, from Lindsay's original (\"Nightspore in Tormance\"), as it was considered too obscure. But out of an original press run of 1430 copies, no more than 596 were sold in total. \"A Voyage to Arcturus\" was made widely available in paperback form when published as one of the precursor volumes to the Ballantine Adult Fantasy series in 1968, featuring a cover by illustrator Bob Pepper.\n\nEditions of \"A Voyage to Arcturus\" have been published in 1920 (Methuen), 1946 (Gollancz), 1963 (Gollancz, Macmillan, Ballantine), 1968 (Gollancz, Ballantine),1971 (Gollancz), 1972, 1973, 1974 (Ballantine), 1978 (Gollancz), 1992 (Canongate), 2002 (Univ. Nebraska), and later by several publishers.\n\nThe book has been translated into Bulgarian, Catalan, Dutch, French, German, Japanese, Polish, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, and Turkish.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1505574", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1505574", "title": "An Essay on Man", "text": "An Essay on Man\n\nAn Essay on Man is a poem published by Alexander Pope in 1733‚Äì1734. It is an effort to rationalize or rather \"vindicate the ways of God to man\" (l.16), a variation of John Milton's claim in the opening lines of \"Paradise Lost\", that he will \"justify the ways of God to men\" (1.26). It is concerned with the natural order God has decreed for man. Because man cannot know God's purposes, he cannot complain about his position in the Great Chain of Being (ll.33-34) and must accept that \"Whatever IS, is RIGHT\" (l.292), a theme that was satirized by Voltaire in \"Candide\" (1759). More than any other work, it popularized optimistic philosophy throughout England and the rest of Europe.\n\nPope's \"Essay on Man\" and \"Moral Epistles\" were designed to be the parts of a system of ethics which he wanted to express in poetry. \"Moral Epistles\" has been known under various other names including \"Ethic Epistles\" and \"Moral Essays\".\n\nOn its publication, \"An Essay on Man\" received great admiration throughout Europe. Voltaire called it \"the most beautiful, the most useful, the most sublime didactic poem ever written in any language\". In 1756 Rousseau wrote to Voltaire admiring the poem and saying that it \"softens my ills and brings me patience\". Kant was fond of the poem and would recite long passages from it to his students.\n\nLater however, Voltaire renounced his admiration for Pope's and Leibniz's optimism and even wrote a novel, \"Candide\", as a satire on their philosophy of ethics. Rousseau also critiqued the work, questioning \"Pope's uncritical assumption that there must be an unbroken chain of being all the way from inanimate matter up to God.\"\n\nThe essay, written in heroic couplets, comprises four epistles. Pope began work on it in 1729, and had finished the first three by 1731. They appeared in early 1733, with the fourth epistle published the following year. The poem was originally published anonymously; Pope did not admit authorship until 1735.\n\nPope reveals in his introductory statement, \"The Design,\" that \"An Essay on Man\" was originally conceived as part of a longer philosophical poem which would have been expanded on through four separate books. According to his friend and editor, William Warburton, Pope intended to structure the work as follows: \n\nThe four epistles which had already been published would have comprised the first book. The second book was to contain another set of epistles, which in contrast to the first book would focus on subjects such as human reason, the practical and impractical aspects of varied arts and sciences, human talent, the use of learning, the science of the world, and wit, together with \"a satire against the misapplication\" of those same disciplines. The third book would discuss politics and religion, while the fourth book was concerned with \"private ethics\" or \"practical morality.\" The following passage, taken from the first two paragraphs of the opening verse of the second epistle, is often quoted by those familiar with Pope's work, as it neatly summarizes some of the religious and humanistic tenets of the poem:\nKnow then thyself, presume not God to scan<br>\nThe proper study of Mankind is Man.<br>\nPlaced on this isthmus of a middle state,<br>\nA Being darkly wise, and rudely great:<br>\nWith too much knowledge for the Sceptic side,<br>\nWith too much weakness for the Stoic's pride,<br>\nHe hangs between; in doubt to act, or rest;<br>\nIn doubt to deem himself a God, or Beast;<br>\nIn doubt his mind or body to prefer;<br>\nBorn but to die, and reas'ning but to err;<br>\nAlike in ignorance, his reason such,<br>\nWhether he thinks too little, or too much;<br>\nChaos of Thought and Passion, all confus'd;<br>\nStill by himself, abus'd or disabus'd;<br>\nCreated half to rise and half to fall;<br>\nGreat Lord of all things, yet a prey to all,<br>\nSole judge of truth, in endless error hurl'd;<br>\nThe glory, jest and riddle of the world.<br>\n\nGo, wondrous creature! mount where science guides,<br>\nGo, measure earth, weigh air, and state the tides; <br>\nInstruct the planets in what orbs to run, <br>\nCorrect old time, and regulate the sun; <br>\nGo, soar with Plato to th‚Äô empyreal sphere, <br>\nTo the first good, first perfect, and first fair; <br>\nOr tread the mazy round his followers trod, <br>\nAnd quitting sense call imitating God; <br>\nAs Eastern priests in giddy circles run, <br>\nAnd turn their heads to imitate the sun. <br>\nGo, teach Eternal Wisdom how to rule‚Äî <br>\nThen drop into thyself, and be a fool! <br>\nIn the above example, Pope's thesis is that man has learnt about nature and God's creation through science; consequently, science has given man power, but having become intoxicated by this power, man has begun to think that he is \"imitating God\". In response, Pope declares the species of man to be a \"fool\", absent of knowledge and plagued by \"ignorance\" in spite of all the progress achieved through science. Pope argues that humanity should make a study of itself, and not debase the spiritual essence of the world with earthly science, since the two are diametrically opposed to one another: man should \"presume not God to scan\".\n\n"}

The same applies to proof by assertion, where an unproved or disproved claim is asserted as true on no ground other than that of its truth having been asserted. \n\nThe name of this fallacy is derived from a famous incident in which Dr. Samuel Johnson claimed to disprove Bishop Berkeley's immaterialist philosophy (that there are no material objects, only minds and ideas in those minds) by kicking a large stone and asserting, \"I refute it \"thus\".\" This action, which is said to fail to prove the existence of the stone outside the ideas formed by perception, is said to fail to contradict Berkeley's argument, and has been seen as merely dismissing it.\n\n\nSpeaker B gives no evidence or reasoning, and when pressed, claims that Speaker A's statement is inherently absurd, thus applying the fallacy.\n\n"}

{"id": "102883", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=102883", "title": "Belief", "text": "Belief\n\nBelief is the state of mind in which a person thinks something to be the case with or without there being empirical evidence to prove that something is the case with factual certainty. Another way of defining belief sees it as a mental representation of an attitude positively oriented towards the likelihood of something being true. In the context of Ancient Greek thought, two related concepts were identified with regards to the concept of belief: \"pistis\" and \"doxa\". Simplified, we may say that \"pistis\" refers to \"trust\" and \"confidence\", while \"doxa\" refers to \"opinion\" and \"acceptance\". The English word \"orthodoxy\" derives from \"doxa\". Jonathan Leicester suggests that belief has the purpose of guiding action rather than indicating truth.\n\nIn epistemology, philosophers use the term \"belief\" to refer to personal attitudes\nassociated with true or false ideas and concepts. However, \"belief\" does not require active introspection and circumspection. For example, we never ponder whether or not the sun will rise. We simply assume the sun will rise. Since \"belief\" is an important aspect of mundane life, according to Eric Schwitzgebel in the \"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\", a related question asks: \"how a physical organism can have beliefs?\"\n\nEpistemology is concerned with delineating the boundary between justified belief and opinion, and involved generally with a theoretical philosophical study of knowledge. The primary problem in epistemology is to understand exactly what is needed in order for us to have knowledge. In a notion derived from Plato's dialogue \"Theaetetus\", where the epistemology of Socrates (Platon) most clearly departs from that of the sophists, who at the time of Plato seem to have defined knowledge as what is here expressed as \"justified true belief\". The tendency to translate from belief (here: doxa ‚Äì common opinion) to knowledge (here: episteme), which Plato (e.g. Socrates of the dialogue) utterly dismisses, results from failing to distinguish a dispositive belief (gr. 'doxa', not 'pistis') from knowledge (episteme) when the opinion is regarded \"true\" (here: orth√©), in terms of right, and juristically so (according to the premises of the dialogue), which was the task of the rhetors to prove. Plato dismisses this possibility of an affirmative relation between belief (i.e. opinion) and knowledge even when the one who opines grounds his belief on the rule, and is able to add \"justification\" (gr. logos: reasonable and necessarily plausible assertions/evidence/guidance) to it.\n\nPlato has been credited for the \"justified true belief\" theory of knowledge, even though Plato in the Theaetetus (dialogue) elegantly dismisses it, and even posits this argument of Socrates as a cause for his death penalty. Among American epistemologists, Gettier (1963) and Goldman (1967), have questioned the \"justified true belief\" definition, and challenged the \"sophists\" of their time.\n\nMainstream psychology and related disciplines have traditionally treated belief as if it were the simplest form of mental representation and therefore one of the building blocks of conscious thought. Philosophers have tended to be more abstract in their analysis, and much of the work examining the viability of the belief concept stems from philosophical analysis.\n\nThe concept of belief presumes a subject (the believer) and an object of belief (the proposition). So, like other propositional attitudes, belief implies the existence of mental states and intentionality, both of which are hotly debated topics in the philosophy of mind, whose foundations and relation to brain states are still controversial.\n\nBeliefs are sometimes divided into core beliefs (that are actively thought about) and \"dispositional beliefs\" (that may be ascribed to someone who has not thought about the issue). For example, if asked \"do you believe tigers wear pink pajamas?\" a person might answer that they do not, despite the fact they may never have thought about this situation before.\n\nThis has important implications for understanding the neuropsychology and neuroscience of belief. If the concept of belief is incoherent, then any attempt to find the underlying neural processes that support it will fail.\n\nPhilosopher Lynne Rudder Baker has outlined four main contemporary approaches to belief in her controversial book \"Saving Belief\":\nStrategic approaches make a distinction between rules, norms and beliefs as follows:\n(1) Rules. Explicit regulative processes such as policies, laws, inspection routines, or incentives. Rules function as a coercive regulator of behavior and are dependent upon the imposing entity's ability to enforce them.\n(2) Norms. Regulative mechanisms accepted by the social collective. Norms are enforced by normative mechanisms within the organization and are not strictly dependent upon law or regulation.\n(3) Beliefs. The collective perception of fundamental truths governing behavior. The adherence to accepted and shared beliefs by members of a social system will likely persist and be difficult to change over time. Strong beliefs about determinant factors (i.e., security, survival, or honor) are likely to cause a social entity or group to accept rules and norms.\n\nHistorically \"belief-in\" belonged in the realm of religious thought, \"belief-that\" instead belonged to epistemological considerations.\n\nTo \"believe in\" someone or something is a distinct concept from \"believing-that.\" There are at least these types of belief-in:\n\n\nEconomic beliefs are beliefs which are reasonably and necessarily contrary to the tenet of rational choice or instrumental rationality.\n\nStudies of the Austrian tradition of the economic thought, in the context of analysis of the influence and subsequent degree of change resulting from existing economic knowledge and belief, has contributed the most to the subsequent holistic collective analysis.\n\nInsofar as the truth of belief is expressed in sentential and propositional form we are using the sense of \"belief-that\" rather than \"belief-in\". Delusion arises when the truth value of the form is clearly nil.\n\nDelusions are defined as beliefs in psychiatric diagnostic criteria (for example in the \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\"). Psychiatrist and historian G.E. Berrios has challenged the view that delusions are genuine beliefs and instead labels them as \"empty speech acts,\" where affected persons are motivated to express false or bizarre belief statements due to an underlying psychological disturbance. However, the majority of mental health professionals and researchers treat delusions as if they were genuine beliefs.\n\nIn Lewis Carroll's \"Through the Looking-Glass\" the White Queen says, \"Why, sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.\" This is often quoted in mockery of the common ability of people to entertain beliefs contrary to fact.\n\nPsychologists study belief formation and the relationship between beliefs and actions. Three models of belief formation and change have been proposed:\n\nWhen people are asked to estimate the likelihood that a statement is true, they search their memory for information that has implications for the validity of this statement. Once this information has been identified, they estimate a) the likelihood that the statement would be true if the information were true, and b) the likelihood that the statement would be true if the information were false. If their estimates for these two probabilities differ, people average them, weighting each by the likelihood that the information is true and false (respectively). Thus, information bears directly on beliefs of another, related statement.\n\nUnlike the previous model, this one takes into consideration the possibility of multiple factors influencing belief formation. Using regression procedures, this model predicts belief formation on the basis of several different pieces of information, with weights assigned to each piece on the basis of their relative importance.\n\nThese models address the fact that the responses people have to belief-relevant information is unlikely to be predicted from the objective basis of the information that they can recall at the time their beliefs are reported. Instead, these responses reflect the number and meaning of the thoughts that people have about the message at the time that they encounter it.\n\nSome influences on people's belief formation include:\n\nHowever, even educated people, well aware of the process by which beliefs form, still strongly cling to their beliefs, and act on those beliefs even against their own self-interest. In Anna Rowley's book, Leadership Therapy, she states \"You want your beliefs to change. It's proof that you are keeping your eyes open, living fully, and welcoming everything that the world and people around you can teach you.\" This means that peoples' beliefs should evolve as they gain new experiences.\n\nJustified true belief is a definition of knowledge that gained approval during the Enlightenment, 'justified' standing in contrast to 'revealed'. There have been attempts to trace it back to Plato and his dialogues. The concept of justified true belief states that in order to know that a given proposition is true, one must not only believe the relevant true proposition, but also have justification for doing so. In more formal terms, an agent formula_1 knows that a proposition formula_2 is true if and only if:\n\nThis theory of knowledge suffered a significant setback with the discovery of Gettier problems, situations in which the above conditions were seemingly met but that many philosophers disagree that anything is known. Robert Nozick suggested a clarification of \"justification\" which he believed eliminates the problem: the justification has to be such that were the justification false, the knowledge would be false. Bernecker and Dretske (2000) argue that \"no epistemologist since Gettier has seriously and successfully defended the traditional view.\" On the other hand, Paul Boghossian argues that the Justified True Belief account is the \"standard, widely accepted\" definition of knowledge.\n\nAn extensive amount of scientific research and philosophical discussion exists around the modification of beliefs, which is commonly referred to as belief revision.\nGenerally speaking, the process of belief revision entails the believer weighing the set of truths and/or evidence, and the dominance of a set of truths or evidence on an alternative to a held belief can lead to revision. One process of belief revision is Bayesian updating and is often referenced for its mathematical basis and conceptual simplicity. However, such a process may not be representative for individuals whose beliefs are not easily characterized as probabilistic.\n\nThere are several techniques for individuals or groups to change the beliefs of others; these methods generally fall under the umbrella of persuasion. Persuasion can take on more specific forms such as consciousness raising when considered in an activist or political context.\nBelief modification may also occur as a result of the experience of outcomes. Because goals are based, in part on beliefs, the success or failure at a particular goal may contribute to modification of beliefs that supported the original goal.\n\nWhether or not belief modification actually occurs is dependent not only on the extent of truths or evidence for the alternative belief, but also characteristics outside the specific truths or evidence. This includes, but is not limited to: the source characteristics of the message, such as credibility; social pressures; the anticipated consequences of a modification; or the ability of the individual or group to act on the modification. Therefore, individuals seeking to achieve belief modification in themselves or others need to consider all possible forms of resistance to belief revision.\n\nWithout qualification, \"belief\" normally implies a lack of doubt, especially insofar as it is a designation of a life stance. In practical everyday use however, belief is normally partial and retractable with varying degrees of certainty.\n\nA copious literature exists in multiple disciplines to accommodate this reality. In mathematics probability, fuzzy logic, fuzzy set theory, and other topics are largely directed to this.\n\nDifferent psychological models have tried to predict people's beliefs and some of them try to estimate the exact probabilities of beliefs. For example, Robert Wyer developed a model of subjective probabilities. When people rate the likelihood of a certain statement (e.g., \"It will rain tomorrow\"), this rating can be seen as a subjective probability value. The subjective probability model posits that these subjective probabilities follow the same rules as objective probabilities. For example, the law of total probability might be applied to predict a subjective probability value. Wyer found that this model produces relatively accurate predictions for probabilities of single events and for changes in these probabilities, but that the probabilities of several beliefs linked by \"and\" or \"or\" do not follow the model as well.\n\nReligious belief refers to attitudes towards mythological, supernatural, or spiritual aspects of a religion. Religious belief is distinct from religious practice and from religious behaviours ‚Äì with some believers not practicing religion and some practitioners not believing religion. Religious beliefs, deriving from ideas that are exclusive to religion, often relate to the existence, characteristics and worship of a deity or deities, to the idea of divine intervention in the universe and in human life, or to the deontological explanations for the values and practices centered on the teachings of a spiritual leader or of a spiritual group. In contrast to other belief systems, religious beliefs are usually codified.\n\nA popular view holds that different religions each have identifiable and exclusive sets of beliefs or creeds, but surveys of religious belief have often found that the official doctrine and descriptions of the beliefs offered by religious authorities do not always agree with the privately held beliefs of those who identify as members of a particular religion. For a broad classification of the kinds of religious belief, see below.\n\nFirst self-applied as a term to the conservative doctrine outlined by anti-modernist Protestants in the United States of America, \"fundamentalism\" in religious terms denotes strict adherence to an interpretation of scriptures that are generally associated with theologically conservative positions or traditional understandings of the text and are distrustful of innovative readings, new revelation, or alternative interpretations. Religious fundamentalism has been identified in the media as being associated with fanatical or zealous political movements around the world that have used a strict adherence to a particular religious doctrine as a means to establish political identity and to enforce societal norms.\n\nFirst used in the context of Early Christianity, the term \"orthodoxy\" relates to religious belief that closely follows the edicts, apologies, and hermeneutics of a prevailing religious authority. In the case of Early Christianity, this authority was the communion of bishops, and is often referred to by the term \"Magisterium\". The term \"orthodox\" was applied almost as an epithet to a group of Jewish believers who held to pre-Enlightenment understanding of Judaism ‚Äì now known as Orthodox Judaism. The Eastern Orthodox Church of Christianity and the Catholic Church each consider themselves to be the true heir to Early Christian belief and practice. The antonym of \"orthodox\" is \"heterodox\", and those adhering to orthodoxy often accuse the heterodox of apostasy, schism, or heresy.\n\nThe Renaissance and later the Enlightenment in Europe exhibited varying degrees of religious tolerance and intolerance towards new and old religious ideas. The \"philosophes\" took particular exception to many of the more fantastical claims of religions and directly challenged religious authority and the prevailing beliefs associated with the established churches. In response to the liberalizing political and social movements, some religious groups attempted to integrate Enlightenment ideals of rationality, equality, and individual liberty into their belief systems, especially in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Reform Judaism and Liberal Christianity offer two examples of such religious associations.\n\nA term signifying derogation that is used by the religious and non-religious alike, \"superstition\" refers to a deprecated belief in supernatural causation. Those who deny the existence of the supernatural generally attribute all beliefs associated with it to be superstitious, while a typical religious critique of superstition holds that it either encompasses beliefs in non-existent supernatural activity or that the supernatural activity is inappropriately feared or held in improper regard (see idolatry). Christian Churches strongly condemned occultism, animism, paganism, and other folk religions as mean forms of superstition, though such condemnation did not necessarily eliminate the beliefs among the common people, and many such religious beliefs persist .\n\nIn Buddhism, practice and progress along the spiritual path happens when one follows the system of Buddhist practice. Any religion which follows (parts of) the fundamentals of this system has, according to the teachings of Buddha, good aspects to the extent it accords with this system. Any religion which goes against (parts of) the fundamentals of this system includes bad aspects too. Any religion which does not teach certain parts of this system, is not because of this a \"bad\" religion; it just lacks those teachings and is to that extent incomplete.\n\nA question by the monk Subhadda to the Buddha:\nThe Buddha replied:\nAs a religious tradition, Hinduism has experienced many attempts at systemization. In medieval times, Shankara advocated for the Advaita system of philosophy. In recent times, Tamala Krishna Gosvami has researched the systemization of Krishna theology as expounded by Srila Prabhupada. (See Krishnology)\n\nSome believe that religion cannot be separated from other aspects of life, or believe that certain cultures did not or do not separate their religious activities from other activities in the same way that some people in modern Western cultures do.\n\nSome anthropologists report cultures in which gods are involved in every aspect of life ‚Äì if a cow goes dry, a god has caused this, and must be propitiated; when the sun rises in the morning, a god has caused this, and must be thanked. Even in modern Western cultures, many people see supernatural forces behind every event, as described by Carl Sagan in his 1995 book \"The Demon-Haunted World\".\n\nPeople with such a worldview often regard the influence of Western culture as inimical. Others with this worldview resist the influence of science, and believe that science (or \"so-called science\") should be guided by religion. Still others with this worldview believe that all political decisions and laws should be guided by religion. This last belief, written into the constitutions of many Islamic nations, is shared by some fundamentalist Christians.\n\nIn addition, beliefs about the supernatural or metaphysical may not presuppose a difference between any such thing as nature and non-nature, nor between science and what most educated people believe. In the view of some historians, the pre-Socratic Athenians saw science, political tradition, culture and religion as not easily distinguishable, but as all part of the same body of knowledge and wisdom available to a community.\n\nAdherents of particular religions deal with the differing doctrines and practices espoused by other religions or by other religious denominations in a variety of ways. All strains of thought appear in different segments of all major world religions.\n\nPeople with exclusivist beliefs typically explain other beliefs either as in error, or as corruptions or counterfeits of the true faith. This approach is a fairly consistent feature among smaller new religious movements that often rely on doctrine that claims a unique revelation by the founders or leaders, and considers it a matter of faith that the \"correct\" religion has a monopoly on truth. All three major Abrahamic monotheistic religions have passages in their holy scriptures that attest to the primacy of the scriptural testimony, and indeed monotheism itself is often vouched as an innovation characterized specifically by its explicit rejection of earlier polytheistic faiths.\n\nSome exclusivist faiths incorporate a specific element of proselytization. This is a strongly-held belief in the Christian tradition which follows the doctrine of the Great Commission, and is less emphasized by the Islamic faith where the Quranic edict \"There shall be no compulsion in religion\" (2:256) is often quoted as a justification for toleration of alternative beliefs. The Jewish tradition does not actively seek out converts.\n\nExclusivism correlates with conservative, fundamentalist, and orthodox approaches of many religions, while pluralistic and syncretist approaches either explicitly downplay or reject the exclusivist tendencies within a religion.\n\nPeople with inclusivist beliefs recognize some truth in all faith systems, highlighting agreements and minimizing differences. This attitude is sometimes associated with Interfaith dialogue or with the Christian Ecumenical movement, though in principle such attempts at pluralism are not necessarily inclusivist and many actors in such interactions (for example, the Roman Catholic Church) still hold to exclusivist dogma while participating in inter-religious organizations.\n\nExplicitly inclusivist religions include many that are associated with the New Age movement, as well as modern reinterpretations of Hinduism and Buddhism. The Bah√°'√≠ Faith considers it doctrine that there is truth in all faith-systems.\n\nPeople with pluralist beliefs make no distinction between faith systems, viewing each one as valid within a particular culture. Examples include:\n\n\nPeople with syncretistic views blend the views of a variety of different religions or traditional beliefs into a unique fusion which suits their particular experiences and contexts (\"see\" eclecticism). Unitarian Universalism exemplifies a syncretistic faith.\n\nTypical reasons for adherence to religion include the following:\n\n\nPsychologist James Alcock also summarizes a number of apparent benefits which reinforce religious belief. These include prayer appearing to account for successful resolution of problems, \"a bulwark against existential anxiety and fear of annihilation,\" an increased sense of control, companionship with one's deity, a source of self-significance, and group identity.\n\nTypical reasons for rejection of religion include:\n\nA belief system is a set of mutually supportive beliefs. The beliefs of any such system can be classified as religious, philosophical, political, ideological, or a combination of these. Philosopher Jonathan Glover says that beliefs are always part of a belief system, and that tenanted belief systems are difficult for the tenants to completely revise or reject.\n\nA collective belief is referred to when people speak of what 'we' believe when this is not simply elliptical for what 'we all' believe.\n\nSociologist √âmile Durkheim wrote of collective beliefs and proposed that they, like all 'social facts', 'inhered in' social groups as opposed to individual persons. Durkheim's discussion of collective belief, though suggestive, is relatively obscure.\n\nPhilosopher Margaret Gilbert has offered a related account in terms of the joint commitment of a number of persons to accept a certain belief as a body. According to this account, individuals who together collectively believe something need not personally believe it themselves. Gilbert's work on the topic has stimulated a developing literature among philosophers. One question that has arisen is whether and how philosophical accounts of belief in general need to be sensitive to the possibility of collective belief.\n\nJonathan Glover believes that he and other philosophers ought to play some role in starting dialogues between people with deeply held, opposing beliefs, especially if there is risk of violence. Glover also believes that philosophy can offer insights about beliefs that would be relevant to such dialogue.\nGlover suggests that beliefs have to be considered holistically, and that no belief exists in isolation in the mind of the believer. It always implicates and relates to other beliefs. Glover provides the example of a patient with an illness who returns to a doctor, but the doctor says that the prescribed medicine is not working. At that point, the patient has a great deal of flexibility in choosing what beliefs to keep or reject: the patient could believe that the doctor is incompetent, that the doctor's assistants made a mistake, that the patient's own body is unique in some unexpected way, that Western medicine is ineffective, or even that Western science is entirely unable to discover truths about ailments.\n\nGlover maintains that any person can continue to hold any belief if they would really like to (e.g., with help from ad hoc hypotheses). One belief can be held fixed, and other beliefs will be altered around it. Glover warns that some beliefs may not be entirely explicitly believed (e.g., some people may not realize they have racist belief systems adopted from their environment as a child). Glover believes that people tend to first realize that beliefs can change, and may be contingent on their upbringing, around age 12 or 15.\n\nGlover emphasizes that beliefs are difficult to change. He says that one may try to rebuild one's beliefs on more secure foundations (axioms), like building a new house, but warns that this may not be possible. Glover offers the example of Ren√© Descartes, saying about Descartes that \"[h]e starts off with the characteristic beliefs of a 17th-century Frenchman; he then junks the lot, he rebuilds the system, and somehow it looks a lot like the beliefs of a 17th-century Frenchman.\" To Glover, belief systems are not like houses but are instead like boats. As Glover puts it: \"Maybe the whole thing needs rebuilding, but inevitably at any point you have to keep enough of it intact to keep floating.\"\n\nGlover's final message is that if people talk about their beliefs, they may find more deep, relevant, philosophical ways in which they disagree (e.g., less obvious beliefs, or more deeply held beliefs). Glover thinks that people often manage to find agreements and consensus through philosophy. He says that at the very least, if people do not convert each other, they will hold their own beliefs more openmindedly and will be less likely to go to war over conflicting beliefs.\n\nThe British philosopher Stephen Law has described some belief systems (including belief in homeopathy, psychic powers, and alien abduction) as \"claptrap\" and said that they \"draw people in and hold them captive so they become willing slaves to victory... if you get sucked in, it can be extremely difficult to think your way clear again\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5734", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5734", "title": "Consequentialism", "text": "Consequentialism\n\nConsequentialism is the class of normative ethical theories holding that the consequences of one's conduct are the ultimate basis for any judgment about the rightness or wrongness of that conduct. Thus, from a consequentialist standpoint, a morally right act (or omission from acting) is one that will produce a good outcome, or consequence. \n\nConsequentialism is primarily non-prescriptive, meaning the moral worth of an action is determined by its potential consequence, not by whether it follows a set of written edicts or laws. One example would entail lying under the threat of government punishment to save an innocent person's life, even though it is illegal to lie under oath.\n\nConsequentialism is usually contrasted with deontological ethics (or \"deontology\"), in that deontology, in which rules and moral duty are central, derives the rightness or wrongness of one's conduct from the character of the behaviour itself rather than the outcomes of the conduct. It is also contrasted with virtue ethics, which focuses on the character of the agent rather than on the nature or consequences of the act (or omission) itself, and pragmatic ethics which treats morality like science: advancing socially over the course of many lifetimes, such that any moral criterion is subject to revision. Consequentialist theories differ in how they define moral goods.\n\nSome argue that consequentialist and deontological theories are not necessarily mutually exclusive. For example, T. M. Scanlon advances the idea that human rights, which are commonly considered a \"deontological\" concept, can only be justified with reference to the consequences of having those rights. Similarly, Robert Nozick argues for a theory that is mostly consequentialist, but incorporates inviolable \"side-constraints\" which restrict the sort of actions agents are permitted to do.\n\nMohist consequentialism, also known as state consequentialism, is an ethical theory which evaluates the moral worth of an action based on how much it contributes to the welfare of a state. According to the \"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\", Mohist consequentialism, dating back to the 5th century BCE, is the \"world's earliest form of consequentialism, a remarkably sophisticated version based on a plurality of intrinsic goods taken as constitutive of human welfare\".\n\nUnlike utilitarianism, which views utility as the sole moral good, \"the basic goods in Mohist consequentialist thinking are... order, material wealth, and increase in population\". During Mozi's era, war and famines were common, and population growth was seen as a moral necessity for a harmonious society. The \"material wealth\" of Mohist consequentialism refers to basic needs like shelter and clothing, and the \"order\" of Mohist consequentialism refers to Mozi's stance against warfare and violence, which he viewed as pointless and a threat to social stability. Stanford sinologist David Shepherd Nivison, in \"The Cambridge History of Ancient China\", writes that the moral goods of Mohism \"are interrelated: more basic wealth, then more reproduction; more people, then more production and wealth... if people have plenty, they would be good, filial, kind, and so on unproblematically\".\n\nThe Mohists believed that morality is based on \"promoting the benefit of all under heaven and eliminating harm to all under heaven\". In contrast to Jeremy Bentham's views, state consequentialism is not utilitarian because it is not hedonistic or individualistic. The importance of outcomes that are good for the community outweigh the importance of individual pleasure and pain. The term state consequentialism has also been applied to the political philosophy of the Confucian philosopher Xunzi.\n\nOn the other hand, the \"Legalist\" Han Fei \"is motivated almost totally from the ruler's point of view\".\n\nIn summary, Jeremy Bentham states that people are driven by their interests and their fears, but their interests take precedence over their fears, and their interests are carried out in accordance with how people view the consequences that might be involved with their interests. \"Happiness\" on this account is defined as the maximization of pleasure and the minimization of pain.\nHistorically, hedonistic utilitarianism is the paradigmatic example of a consequentialist moral theory. This form of utilitarianism holds that what matters is the aggregate happiness; the happiness of everyone and not the happiness of any particular person. John Stuart Mill, in his exposition of hedonistic utilitarianism, proposed a hierarchy of pleasures, meaning that the pursuit of certain kinds of pleasure is more highly valued than the pursuit of other pleasures. However, some contemporary utilitarians, such as Peter Singer, are concerned with maximizing the satisfaction of preferences, hence \"preference utilitarianism\". Other contemporary forms of utilitarianism mirror the forms of consequentialism outlined below.\n\nEthical egoism can be understood as a consequentialist theory according to which the consequences for the individual agent are taken to matter more than any other result. Thus, egoism will prescribe actions that may be beneficial, detrimental, or neutral to the welfare of others. Some, like Henry Sidgwick, argue that a certain degree of egoism \"promotes\" the general welfare of society for two reasons: because individuals know how to please themselves best, and because if everyone were an austere altruist then general welfare would inevitably decrease.\n\nEthical altruism can be seen as a consequentialist ethic which prescribes that an individual take actions that have the best consequences for everyone except for himself. This was advocated by Auguste Comte, who coined the term \"altruism,\" and whose ethics can be summed up in the phrase \"Live for others\".\n\nIn general, consequentialist theories focus on actions. However, this need not be the case. Rule consequentialism is a theory that is sometimes seen as an attempt to reconcile deontology and consequentialism‚Äîand in some cases, this is stated as a criticism of rule consequentialism. Like deontology, rule consequentialism holds that moral behavior involves following certain rules. However, rule consequentialism chooses rules based on the consequences that the selection of those rules has. Rule consequentialism exists in the forms of rule utilitarianism and rule egoism.\n\nVarious theorists are split as to whether the rules are the only determinant of moral behavior or not. For example, Robert Nozick holds that a certain set of minimal rules, which he calls \"side-constraints\", are necessary to ensure appropriate actions. There are also differences as to how absolute these moral rules are. Thus, while Nozick's side-constraints are absolute restrictions on behavior, Amartya Sen proposes a theory that recognizes the importance of certain rules, but these rules are not absolute. That is, they may be violated if strict adherence to the rule would lead to much more undesirable consequences.\n\nOne of the most common objections to rule-consequentialism is that it is incoherent, because it is based on the consequentialist principle that what we should be concerned with is maximizing the good, but then it tells us not to act to maximize the good, but to follow rules (even in cases where we know that breaking the rule could produce better results).\n\nBrad Hooker avoided this objection by not basing his form of rule-consequentialism on the ideal of maximizing the good. He writes:\n\n‚Ä¶the best argument for rule-consequentialism is not that it derives from an overarching commitment to maximise the good. The best argument for rule-consequentialism is that it does a better job than its rivals of matching and tying together our moral convictions, as well as offering us help with our moral disagreements and uncertainties.\n\nDerek Parfit described Brad Hooker's book on rule-consequentialism \"Ideal Code, Real World\" as the \"best statement and defence, so far, of one of the most important moral theories\".\n\nRule-consequentialism may offer a means to reconcile pure consequentialism with deontological, or rules-based ethics.\n\nThe two-level approach involves engaging in critical reasoning and considering all the possible ramifications of one's actions before making an ethical decision, but reverting to generally reliable moral rules when one is not in a position to stand back and examine the dilemma as a whole. In practice, this equates to adhering to rule consequentialism when one can only reason on an intuitive level, and to act consequentialism when in a position to stand back and reason on a more critical level.\n\nThis position can be described as a reconciliation between act consequentialism ‚Äì in which the morality of an action is determined by that action's effects ‚Äì and rule consequentialism ‚Äì in which moral behavior is derived from following rules that lead to positive outcomes.\n\nThe two-level approach to consequentialism is most often associated with R. M. Hare and Peter Singer.\n\nAnother consequentialist version is motive consequentialism which looks at whether the state of affairs that results from the motive to choose an action is better or at least as good as each of the alternative state of affairs that would have resulted from alternative actions. This version gives relevance to the motive of an act and links it to its consequences. An act can therefore not be wrong if the decision to act was based on a right motive. A possible inference is, that one can not be blamed for mistaken judgments if the motivation was to do good.\n\nMost consequentialist theories focus on \"promoting\" some sort of good consequences. However, negative utilitarianism lays out a consequentialist theory that focuses solely on minimizing bad consequences.\n\nOne major difference between these two approaches is the agent's responsibility. Positive consequentialism demands that we bring about good states of affairs, whereas negative consequentialism requires that we avoid bad ones. Stronger versions of negative consequentialism will require active intervention to prevent bad and ameliorate existing harm. In weaker versions, simple forbearance from acts tending to harm others is sufficient. An example of this is the Slippery Slope Argument, which encourages others to avoid a specified act on the grounds that it may ultimately lead to undesirable consequences.\n\nOften \"negative\" consequentialist theories assert that reducing suffering is more important than increasing pleasure. Karl Popper, for example, claimed \"‚Ä¶from the moral point of view, pain cannot be outweighed by pleasure...\". (While Popper is not a consequentialist per se, this is taken as a classic statement of negative utilitarianism.) When considering a theory of justice, negative consequentialists may use a statewide or global-reaching principle: the reduction of suffering (for the disadvantaged) is more valuable than increased pleasure (for the affluent or luxurious).\n\nTeleological ethics (Greek telos, \"end\"; logos, \"science\") is an ethical theory that holds that the ends or consequences of an act determine whether an act is good or evil. Teleological theories are often discussed in opposition to deontological ethical theories, which hold that acts themselves are \"inherently\" good or evil, regardless of the consequences of acts. The saying, \"the end justifies the means\", meaning that if a goal is morally important enough, any method of achieving it is acceptable.\n\nTeleological theories differ on the nature of the end that actions ought to promote. Eudaemonist theories (Greek eudaimonia, \"happiness\") hold that the goal of ethics consists in some function or activity appropriate to man as a human being, and thus tend to emphasize the cultivation of virtue or excellence in the agent as the end of all action. These could be the classical virtues‚Äîcourage, temperance, justice, and wisdom‚Äîthat promoted the Greek ideal of man as the \"rational animal\", or the theological virtues‚Äîfaith, hope, and love‚Äîthat distinguished the Christian ideal of man as a being created in the image of God.\nUtilitarian-type theories hold that the end consists in an experience or feeling produced by the action. Hedonism, for example, teaches that this feeling is pleasure‚Äîeither one's own, as in egoism (the 17th-century English philosopher Thomas Hobbes), or everyone's, as in universalistic hedonism, or utilitarianism (the 19th-century English philosophers Jeremy Bentham, John Stuart Mill, and Henry Sidgwick), with its formula of the \"greatest pleasure of the greatest number\".\n\nOther utilitarian-type views include the claims that the end of action is survival and growth, as in evolutionary ethics (the 19th-century English philosopher Herbert Spencer); the experience of power, as in despotism; satisfaction and adjustment, as in pragmatism (20th-century American philosophers Ralph Barton Perry and John Dewey); and freedom, as in existentialism (the 20th-century French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre).\n\nThe chief problem for eudaemonist theories is to show that leading a life of virtue will also be attended by happiness‚Äîby the winning of the goods regarded as the chief end of action. That Job should suffer and Socrates and Jesus die while the wicked prosper, then seems unjust. Eudaemonists generally reply that the universe is moral and that, in Socrates' words, \"No evil can happen to a good man, either in life or after death,\" or, in Jesus' words, \"But he who endures to the end will be saved.\" (Matt 10:22).\n\nUtilitarian theories, on the other hand, must answer the charge that ends do not justify the means. The problem arises in these theories because they tend to separate the achieved ends from the action by which these ends were produced. One implication of utilitarianism is that one's intention in performing an act may include all of its foreseen consequences. The goodness of the intention then reflects the balance of the good and evil of these consequences, with no limits imposed upon it by the nature of the act itself‚Äîeven if it be, say, the breaking of a promise or the execution of an innocent man. Utilitarianism, in answering this charge, must show either that what is apparently immoral is not really so or that, if it really is so, then closer examination of the consequences will bring this fact to light. Ideal utilitarianism (G.E. Moore and Hastings Rashdall) tries to meet the difficulty by advocating a plurality of ends and including among them the attainment of virtue itself, which, as John Stuart Mill affirmed, \"may be felt a good in itself, and desired as such with as great intensity as any other good\".\n\nSince pure consequentialism holds that an action is to be judged solely by its result, most consequentialist theories hold that a deliberate action is no different from a deliberate decision not to act. This contrasts with the \"acts and omissions doctrine\", which is upheld by some medical ethicists and some religions: it asserts there is a significant moral distinction between acts and deliberate non-actions which lead to the same outcome. This contrast is brought out in issues such as voluntary euthanasia.\n\nOne important characteristic of many normative moral theories such as consequentialism is the ability to produce practical moral judgements. At the very least, any moral theory needs to define the standpoint from which the goodness of the consequences are to be determined. What is primarily at stake here is the \"responsibility\" of the agent.\n\nOne common tactic among consequentialists, particularly those committed to an altruistic (selfless) account of consequentialism, is to employ an ideal, neutral observer from which moral judgements can be made. John Rawls, a critic of utilitarianism, argues that utilitarianism, in common with other forms of consequentialism, relies on the perspective of such an ideal observer. The particular characteristics of this ideal observer can vary from an omniscient observer, who would grasp all the consequences of any action, to an ideally informed observer, who knows as much as could reasonably be expected, but not necessarily all the circumstances or all the possible consequences. Consequentialist theories that adopt this paradigm hold that right action is the action that will bring about the best consequences from this ideal observer's perspective.\n\nIn practice, it is very difficult, and at times arguably impossible, to adopt the point of view of an ideal observer. Individual moral agents do not know everything about their particular situations, and thus do not know all the possible consequences of their potential actions. For this reason, some theorists have argued that consequentialist theories can only require agents to choose the best action in line with what they know about the situation. However, if this approach is na√Øvely adopted, then moral agents who, for example, recklessly fail to reflect on their situation, and act in a way that brings about terrible results, could be said to be acting in a morally justifiable way. Acting in a situation without first informing oneself of the circumstances of the situation can lead to even the most well-intended actions yielding miserable consequences. As a result, it could be argued that there is a moral imperative for an agent to inform himself as much as possible about a situation before judging the appropriate course of action. This imperative, of course, is derived from consequential thinking: a better-informed agent is able to bring about better consequences.\n\nMoral action always has consequences for certain people or things. Varieties of consequentialism can be differentiated by the beneficiary of the good consequences. That is, one might ask \"Consequences for whom?\"\n\nA fundamental distinction can be drawn between theories which require that agents act for ends perhaps disconnected from their own interests and drives, and theories which permit that agents act for ends in which they have some personal interest or motivation. These are called \"agent-neutral\" and \"agent-focused\" theories respectively.\n\nAgent-neutral consequentialism ignores the specific value a state of affairs has for any particular agent. Thus, in an agent-neutral theory, an actor's personal goals do not count any more than anyone else's goals in evaluating what action the actor should take. Agent-focused consequentialism, on the other hand, focuses on the particular needs of the moral agent. Thus, in an agent-focused account, such as one that Peter Railton outlines, the agent might be concerned with the general welfare, but the agent is \"more\" concerned with the immediate welfare of herself and her friends and family.\n\nThese two approaches could be reconciled by acknowledging the tension between an agent's interests as an individual and as a member of various groups, and seeking to somehow optimize among all of these interests. For example, it may be meaningful to speak of an action as being good for someone as an individual, but bad for them as a citizen of their town.\n\nMany consequentialist theories may seem primarily concerned with human beings and their relationships with other human beings. However, some philosophers argue that we should not limit our ethical consideration to the interests of human beings alone. Jeremy Bentham, who is regarded as the founder of utilitarianism, argues that animals can experience pleasure and pain, thus demanding that 'non-human animals' should be a serious object of moral concern. More recently, Peter Singer has argued that it is unreasonable that we do not give equal consideration to the interests of animals as to those of human beings when we choose the way we are to treat them. Such equal consideration does not necessarily imply identical treatment of humans and non-humans, any more than it necessarily implies identical treatment of all humans.\n\nOne way to divide various consequentialisms is by the types of consequences that are taken to matter most, that is, which consequences count as good states of affairs. According to utilitarianism, a good action is one that results in an increase in pleasure, and the best action is one that results in the most pleasure for the greatest number. Closely related is eudaimonic consequentialism, according to which a full, flourishing life, which may or may not be the same as enjoying a great deal of pleasure, is the ultimate aim. Similarly, one might adopt an aesthetic consequentialism, in which the ultimate aim is to produce beauty. However, one might fix on non-psychological goods as the relevant effect. Thus, one might pursue an increase in material equality or political liberty instead of something like the more ephemeral \"pleasure\". Other theories adopt a package of several goods, all to be promoted equally.\n\nConsequentialism can also be contrasted with aretaic moral theories such as virtue ethics. Whereas consequentialist theories posit that consequences of action should be the primary focus of our thinking about ethics, virtue ethics insists that it is the character rather than the consequences of actions that should be the focal point. Some virtue ethicists hold that consequentialist theories totally disregard the development and importance of moral character. For example, Philippa Foot argues that consequences in themselves have no ethical content, unless it has been provided by a virtue such as benevolence.\n\nHowever, consequentialism and virtue ethics need not be entirely antagonistic. Iain King has developed an approach that reconciles the two schools. Other consequentialists consider effects on the character of people involved in an action when assessing consequence. Similarly, a consequentialist theory may aim at the maximization of a particular virtue or set of virtues. Finally, following Foot's lead, one might adopt a sort of consequentialism that argues that virtuous activity ultimately produces the best consequences.\nThe \"ultimate end\" is a concept in the moral philosophy of Max Weber, in which individuals act in a faithful, rather than rational, manner.\n\nThe term \"consequentialism\" was G. E. M. Anscombe in her essay \"Modern Moral Philosophy\" in 1958, to describe what she saw as the central error of certain moral theories, such as those propounded by Mill and Sidgwick.\n\nThe phrase and concept of \"The end justifies the means\" are at least as old as the first century BC. Ovid wrote in his Heroides that \"Exitus acta probat\" \"The result justifies the deed\".\n\nG. E. M. Anscombe objects to consequentialism on the grounds that it does not provide ethical guidance in what one ought to do because there is no distinction between consequences that are foreseen and those that are intended.\nBernard Williams has argued that consequentialism is alienating because it requires moral agents to put too much distance between themselves and their own projects and commitments. Williams argues that consequentialism requires moral agents to take a strictly impersonal view of all actions, since it is only the consequences, and not who produces them, that are said to matter. Williams argues that this demands too much of moral agents‚Äîsince (he claims) consequentialism demands that they be willing to sacrifice any and all personal projects and commitments in any given circumstance in order to pursue the most beneficent course of action possible. He argues further that consequentialism fails to make sense of intuitions that it can matter whether or not someone is personally the author of a particular consequence. For example, that participating in a crime can matter, even if the crime would have been committed anyway, or would even have been worse, without the agent's participation.\n\nSome consequentialists‚Äîmost notably Peter Railton‚Äîhave attempted to develop a form of consequentialism that acknowledges and avoids the objections raised by Williams. Railton argues that Williams's criticisms can be avoided by adopting a form of consequentialism in which moral decisions are to be determined by the sort of life that they express. On his account, the agent should choose the sort of life that will, on the whole, produce the best overall effects.\n\n\n"}

He was also the third president of the Aristotelian Society in 1898.\n\nRitchie was born at Jedburgh on 26 October 1853. He was the only son of the three children of George Ritchie, D.D., minister of the parish and a man of scholarship and culture, who was elected to the office of moderator of the general assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1870. His mother was Elizabeth Bradfute Dudgeon. The family was connected with the Carlyles, and early in 1889 Ritchie edited a volume of \"Early Letters of Jane Welsh Carlyle.\"\n\nRitchie received his early schooling at Jedburgh Academy. Not allowed to make friends with other boys of his own age, he never learned to play games, and lived a solitary life, concentrating his mind on purely intellectual subjects. He matriculated in 1869 at Edinburgh University, where he made a special study of classics under Professors William Young Sellar and J. S. Blackie, while he began to study philosophy under Professor Campbell Fraser, in whose class and in that of Professor Henry Calderwood (on moral philosophy) he gained the highest prizes. After graduating M.A. at Edinburgh in 1875 with first-class honours in classics, Ritchie gained a classical exhibition at Balliol College, Oxford, and won a first-class both in classical moderations (Michaelmas 1875) and in the final classical school (Trinity term, 1878). In 1878 he became a fellow of Jesus College, Oxford and in 1881 a tutor. From 1882 to 1886 he was also a tutor at Balliol College. At Oxford Ritchie came under the influence of Thomas Hill Green and Arnold Toynbee, and it was there that the foundations were laid both for his interest in idealistic\nphilosophy associated with the name of G. W. F. Hegel (see British idealism), and also of his strong bent toward practical politics; his political philosophy was dominated by the belief that practical action must be derived from principles.\n\nRitchie married twice. His first marriage was in 1881 to Flora Lindsay, daughter of Col. A. A. Macdonell of Lochgarry, and sister of Professor A. A. Macdonell of Oxford. Flora died in 1888. He was married a second time in 1889 to Ellen Haycraft, sister of Professor John Berry Haycraft. He had a daughter by the first marriage and a son, Arthur David Ritchie, by the second.\n\nIn 1894 Ritchie left Oxford on being appointed professor of logic and metaphysics at the University of St. Andrews. At this time the university was in the midst of a turmoil of conflicting interests which involved litigation and much partisan feeling. In this conflict Ritchie supported the side of progress, which ultimately prevailed. \n\nD. G. Ritchie was a founding member, and the third President (1898‚Äì1899), of the Aristotelian Society, an influential academic organisation that is still very much in active existence.\n\nHe remained at St. Andrews until his death on 3 February 1903. He is buried in the north-east corner of the Eastern Cemetery in St Andrews beneath a large black granite cross.\n\nBoth at Oxford and at St. Andrews, Ritchie wrote mostly on ethics and political philosophy. One of his earliest writings was an essay on \"The Rationality of History,\" contributed to \"Essays in Philosophical Criticism,\" written in 1883 by a number of young men influenced by Hegel and his interpreters. He was very much one of the generation of thinkers who were sometimes referred to as the Young Hegelians.\n\nOf a simple and unaffected nature, Ritchie pursued the truth he set himself to seek with an entire devotion. Despite his retiring manner, he had many friends. He held strongly that questions of ethics and politics must be regarded from a metaphysical point of view. For him the foundation of ethics necessarily rested on the ideal end of social well-being, and keeping this end in view, he proceeded to trace its history at different times, the manner in which it shapes itself in the mind of each individual, and the way in which it can be developed and realised. Ritchie was an advanced liberal with socialist leanings. He considered that the ultimate value of religion depended on the ideal it set before mankind when it represented its highest form.\n\nAmong his works may be cited:\n\nHis \"Philosophical Studies\" was edited with a memoir by Robert Latta (1905).\n\n"}

Further he reflected on the task of the scientist, bearing in mind that a particular complex \"object\" might be viewed from a number of different scientific perspectives: thus the work of the scientist involves not just examining the object within a specific scientific framework, but must also involve the choice of methodology by which the subject is marked as a distinct subject of scientific enquiry.\n\nIn 1958 he joined Vasily Davydov in founding the Commission for The Study of The Psychology of Thought and Logic.\n\nIn 1962 he joined Vadim Sadovsky and Erik Yudin, in creating the \"Interdisciplinary Seminar on Structural and Systemic Methods of Analysis in Science and Technology\" at the \"Commission on Cybernetics\" of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR which was headed by Aksel Berg.

{"id": "12327", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12327", "title": "Glossolalia", "text": "Glossolalia\n\nGlossolalia or speaking in tongues is a phenomenon in which people appear to speak in languages unknown to them. One definition used by linguists is the fluid vocalizing of speech-like syllables that lack any readily comprehended meaning, in some cases as part of religious practice in which it is believed to be a divine language unknown to the speaker. Glossolalia is practiced in Pentecostal and charismatic Christianity as well as in other religions. The term derives from , a Greek phrase used in the New Testament meaning \"to speak in or with tongues [i.e., other languages]\" (, ).\n\nSometimes a distinction is made between \"glossolalia\" and \"xenolalia\" or \"xenoglossy\", which specifically designates when the language being spoken is a natural language previously unknown to the speaker. However, this distinction is not universally made, and the New Testament uses the phrase \"gl≈çssais lalein\" in at least one passage to refer to speaking in languages known to others but not to the speakers.\n\n\"Glossolalia\" is from the Greek word Œ≥ŒªœâœÉœÉŒøŒªŒ±ŒªŒØŒ±, itself a compound of the words Œ≥Œª·ø∂œÉœÉŒ± (\"glossa\"), meaning \"tongue\" or \"language\" and ŒªŒ±ŒªŒ≠œâ (\"lale≈ç\"), \"to speak, talk, chat, prattle, or to make a sound\". The Greek expression (in various forms) appears in the New Testament in the books of Acts and First Corinthians. In Acts 2, the followers of Christ receive the Holy Spirit and speak in the languages of at least fifteen countries or ethnic groups.\n\nThe exact phrase \"speaking in tongues\" has been used at least since the translation of the New Testament into Middle English in the Wycliffe Bible in the 14th century. Frederic Farrar first used the word \"glossolalia\" in 1879.\n\nIn 1972, William J. Samarin, a linguist from the University of Toronto, published a thorough assessment of Pentecostal glossolalia that became a classic work on its linguistic characteristics. His assessment was based on a large sample of glossolalia recorded in public and private Christian meetings in Italy, the Netherlands, Jamaica, Canada, and the United States over the course of five years; his wide range of subjects included the Puerto Ricans of the Bronx, the snake handlers of the Appalachians and the Spiritual Christians from Russia in Los Angeles (\"Pryguny, Dukh-i-zhizniki\").\n\nSamarin found that glossolalic speech does resemble human language in some respects. The speaker uses accent, rhythm, intonation and pauses to break up the speech into distinct units. Each unit is itself made up of syllables, the syllables being formed from consonants and vowels taken from a language known to the speaker:\n\nIt is verbal behaviour that consists of using a certain number of consonants and vowels...in a limited number of syllables that in turn are organized into larger units that are taken apart and rearranged pseudogrammatically...with variations in pitch, volume, speed and intensity.\n\n[Glossolalia] consists of strings of syllables, made up of sounds taken from all those that the speaker knows, put together more or less haphazardly but emerging nevertheless as word-like and sentence-like units because of realistic, language-like rhythm and melody.\n\nThat the sounds are taken from the set of sounds already known to the speaker is confirmed by others. Felicitas Goodman, a psychological anthropologist and linguist, also found that the speech of glossolalists reflected the patterns of speech of the speaker's native language. These findings were confirmed by Kavan (2004).\n\nSamarin found that the resemblance to human language was merely on the surface and so concluded that glossolalia is \"only a facade of language\". He reached this conclusion because the syllable string did not form words, the stream of speech was not internally organized, and ‚Äì most importantly of all ‚Äì there was no systematic relationship between units of speech and concepts. Humans use language to communicate but glossolalia does not. Therefore, he concluded that glossolalia is not \"a specimen of human language because it is neither internally organized nor systematically related to the world man perceives\". On the basis of his linguistic analysis, Samarin defined Pentecostal glossolalia as \"meaningless but phonologically structured human utterance, believed by the speaker to be a real language but bearing no systematic resemblance to any natural language, living or dead\".\n\nPractitioners of glossolalia may disagree with linguistic researchers and claim that they are speaking human languages (xenoglossia). Felicitas Goodman studied a number of Pentecostal communities in the United States, the Caribbean, and Mexico; these included English-, Spanish- and Mayan-speaking groups. She compared what she found with recordings of non-Christian rituals from Africa, Borneo, Indonesia and Japan. She took into account both the segmental structure (such as sounds, syllables, phrases) and the supra-segmental elements (rhythm, accent, intonation) and concluded that there was no distinction between what was practised by the Pentecostal Protestants and the followers of other religions.\n\nIt was a commonplace idea within the Greco-Roman world that divine beings spoke languages different from human languages, and historians of religion have identified references to esoteric speech in Greco-Roman literature that resemble glossolalia, sometimes explained as angelic or divine language. An example is the account in the Testament of Job, a non-canonical elaboration of the Book of Job, where the daughters of Job are described as being given sashes enabling them to speak and sing in angelic languages.\n\nAccording to Dale B. Martin, glossolalia accorded high status in the ancient world due to its association with the divine. Alexander of Abonoteichus may have exhibited glossolalia during his episodes of prophetic ecstasy. Neoplatonist philosopher Iamblichus linked glossolalia to prophecy, writing that prophecy was divine spirit possession that \"emits words which are not understood by those that utter them; for they pronounce them, as it is said, with an insane mouth (\"mainomenœå stomati\") and are wholly subservient, and entirely yield themselves to the energy of the predominating God.\"\n\nAs part of his attack on early Christianity, the Greek philosopher Celsus includes an account of Christian glossolalia. Celsus describes prophecies made by several Christians in Palestine and Phoenicia of which he writes, \"Having brandished these threats they then go on to add incomprehensible, incoherent, and utterly obscure utterances, the meaning of which no intelligent person could discover: for they are meaningless and nonsensical, and give a chance for any fool or sorcerer to take the words in whatever sense he likes.\"\n\nReferences to speaking in tongues by the Church fathers are rare. Except for Irenaeus' 2nd-century reference to many in the church speaking all kinds of languages \"through the Spirit\", and Tertullian's reference in 207 AD to the spiritual gift of interpretation of tongues being encountered in his day, there are no other known first-hand accounts of glossolalia, and very few second-hand accounts among their writings.\n\n\n\nDuring the 20th century, glossolalia primarily became associated with Pentecostalism and the later charismatic movement. The holiness preachers Charles Parham and William Seymour are credited as co-founders of the movement. Parham and Seymour taught that \"baptism of the Holy Spirit was not the blessing of sanctification but rather a third work of grace that was accompanied by the experience of tongues.\" It was Parham who formulated the doctrine of \"initial evidence\". After studying the Bible, Parham came to the conclusion that speaking in tongues was the Bible evidence that one had received the baptism with the Holy Spirit.\n\nIn 1900, Parham opened Bethel Bible College in Topeka, Kansas, America, where he taught initial evidence. During a service on 1 January 1901, a student named Agnes Ozman asked for prayer and the laying on of hands to specifically ask God to fill her with the Holy Spirit. She became the first of many students to experience glossolalia, coincidentally in the first hours of the 20th century. Parham followed within the next few days. Parham called his new movement the Apostolic Faith. In 1905, he moved to Houston and opened a Bible school there. One of his students was William Seymour, an African-American preacher. In 1906, Seymour traveled to Los Angeles where his preaching ignited the Azusa Street Revival. This revival is considered the birth of the global Pentecostal movement. Witnesses at the Azusa Street Revival wrote of seeing fire resting on the heads of participants, miraculous healings in the meetings, and incidents of speaking in tongues being understood by native speakers of the language. According to the first issue of William Seymour's newsletter, \"The Apostolic Faith\", from 1906:\n\nParham and his early followers believed that speaking in tongues was xenoglossia, and some followers traveled to foreign countries and tried to use the gift to share the Gospel with non-English-speaking people. From the time of the Azusa Street revival and among early participants in the Pentecostal movement, there were many accounts of individuals hearing their own languages spoken 'in tongues'. It is likely that the majority of Pentecostals and Charismatics still consider speaking in tongues to primarily be human languages. In the years following the Azusa Street revival Pentecostals who went to the mission field found that they were unable to speak in the language of the local inhabitants at will when they spoke in tongues in strange lands. But Pentecostals and Charismatics have reported many cases of 'speaking in tongues' that were identified as human languages since.\n\nThe revival at Azusa Street lasted until around 1915. From it grew many new Pentecostal churches as people visited the services in Los Angeles and took their newfound beliefs to communities around the United States and abroad. During the 20th century, glossolalia became an important part of the identity of these religious groups. During the 1960s, the charismatic movement within the mainline Protestant churches and among charismatic Roman Catholics adopted some Pentecostal beliefs, and the practice of glossolalia spread to other Christian denominations. The discussion regarding tongues has permeated many branches of the Protestantism, particularly since the widespread Charismatic Movement in the 1960s. Many books have been published either defending or attacking the practice.\n\nIn Christianity, a supernatural explanation for glossolalia is advocated by some and rejected by others.\n\nProponents of each viewpoint use the biblical writings and historical arguments to support their positions.\n\nThere are five places in the New Testament where speaking in tongues is referred to \"explicitly\":\n\nOther verses by inference may be considered to refer to \"speaking in tongues\", such as , and .\n\nThe biblical account of Pentecost in the second chapter of the book of Acts describes the sound of a mighty rushing wind and \"divided tongues like fire\" coming to rest on the apostles. The text further describes that \"they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak in other languages\". It goes on to say in verses 5-11 that when the Apostles spoke, each person in attendance \"heard their own language being spoken\". Therefore, the gift of speaking in tongues refers to the Apostles' speaking languages that the people listening heard as \"them telling in our own tongues the mighty works of God\". Glossolalists and cessationists both recognize this as xenoglossia, a miraculous ability that marked their baptism in the Holy Spirit. Something similar (although perhaps not xenoglossia) took place on at least two subsequent occasions, in Caesarea and Ephesus.\n\nGlossolalists and cessationists generally agree that the primary purpose of the gift of speaking in tongues was to mark the Holy Spirit being poured out. At Pentecost the Apostle Peter declared that this gift, which was making some in the audience ridicule the disciples as drunks, was the fulfilment of the prophecy of Joel which described that God would pour out his Spirit on all flesh ().\n\nDespite these commonalities, there are significant variations in interpretation.\n\nInfluenced by the Holiness movement, baptism with the Holy Spirit was regarded by the first Pentecostals as being the third work of grace, following the new birth (first work of grace) and entire sanctification (second work of grace). This third work of grace was accompanied with glossolalia.\n\nBecause Pentecostal and charismatic beliefs are not monolithic, there is not complete theological agreement on speaking in tongues. Generally, however, it is agreed that speaking in tongues is a spiritual gift that can be manifested as either a human language or a heavenly supernatural language in three ways:\nMany Pentecostals and charismatics adhere to Paul's words in 1 Corinthians 14 which established guidelines on the public use of glossolalia in the church at Corinth.\n\nThe gift of tongues is often referred to as a \"message in tongues\". This use of glossolalia requires an interpretation so that the gathered congregation can understand the message. This is accomplished by the interpretation of tongues, another spiritual gift. There are two schools of thought concerning the nature of a message in tongues:\n\nIn addition to praying in the Spirit, many Pentecostal and charismatic churches practice what is known as singing in the Spirit. The Apostle \"Paul's definition of spiritual songs ‚Äì is singing in the Spirit which is singing in tongues (1 Corinthians 14:15). Paul made it clear that praying in the Spirit was praying in tongues because it was in direct contrast to praying with the understanding or the language that could not be understood in the context of human languages (1 Corinthians 14:14, 16‚Äì18)\"\n\nOther religious groups have been observed to practice some form of theopneustic glossolalia. It is perhaps most commonly in Paganism, Shamanism, and other mediumistic religious practices. In Japan, the God Light Association believed that glossolalia could cause adherents to recall past lives.\n\nGlossolalia has been postulated as an explanation for the Voynich manuscript.\n\nIn the 19th century, Spiritism was developed by the work of Allan Kardec, and the phenomenon was seen as one of the self-evident manifestations of spirits. Spiritists argued that some cases were actually cases of xenoglossia.\n\nNeuroimaging of brain activity during glossolalia does not show activity in the language areas of the brain.\n\nA study done by the American Journal of Human biology found that speaking in tongues was associated with both a reduction in circulatory cortisol, and enhancements in alpha-amylase enzyme activity‚Äîtwo common biomarkers of stress reduction that can be measured in saliva.\n\nAdriano Celentano's 1972 song \"Prisencolinensinainciusol\" is an Italian song purposely written in mock-up English. It uses sounds from American English to simulate having been written in that language, while conveying no actual meaning.\n\n\n\n"}

The method was described in the 1998 book \"Living from the Heart\", by Puran Bair (2nd Edition Published in 2009) and in the 2007 book \"Energize Your Heart in 4 Dimensions\", by Puran and Susanna Bair.\n\nAll meditation methods are effective in reducing stress, but they do so in different ways. \nThe method of HRM involves conscious breathing, use of the full lung capacity, a concentration on the heart (both the physical heart and the emotional or poetic heart) and an intervention in the breath to make it rhythmic, through the coordination of the breath and heartbeat. Several different rhythmic patterns are used, including making the length of the inhale even with the length of the exhale, for example, 8 beats in, 8 beats out; this is called ‚ÄúThe Swinging Breath‚Äù. Another pattern involves a longer holding of the breath, so that the holding period equals the breathing period, for example, 8 beats in, 16 beats hold, 8 beats out; this is called ‚ÄúThe Square Breath‚Äù. This square breath has a great stabilizing quality and is very helpful for anxiety or feelings of panic. The method of HRM never involves holding the breath after an exhalation, only after an inhalation.\n\nBecause of its ancient history, other interpretations abound, but these other variations may not center on the heart or the heartbeat. For example, call-in radio personality Dr. Joy Browne describes a practice she calls 'square breathing' in a chapter of her recent book \"Getting Unstuck\". Dr. Browne does not use the heartbeat, but counts seconds. With this method, for each breathing element (in, out, hold), one can use any count. Dr. Browne's square breathing is defined as N seconds in, N seconds hold, N seconds out, ending with N seconds hold. This practice is never done within HRM, for it is incompatible with the full breath. The average breath rate is 16 times a minute, which approximates a rhythm of 2 seconds in and 2 seconds out. The example of 8 seconds per element results in 2 breaths per minute. While possible for veteran practitioners, most beginners would have great difficulty achieving this. Beginners can start with an easy 2 seconds per element, resulting in 8 breaths per minute. The number of seconds per element can then be increased gradually with practice.\n\n\n"}

He holds a University Professorship at the New York University School of Law and was formerly the Chichele Professor of Social and Political Theory at All Souls College, Oxford University. Waldron also holds an adjunct professorship at Victoria University of Wellington. Waldron is regarded as one of the world's leading legal and political philosophers.\n\nWaldron attended Southland Boys' High School, and then went on to study at the University of Otago, New Zealand, where he graduated with a B.A. in 1974 and an LL.B. in 1978. He later studied for a D.Phil. at Lincoln College, Oxford under legal philosopher Ronald Dworkin and political theorist Alan Ryan; Waldron graduated in 1986.\n\nHe also taught legal and political philosophy at Otago (1975‚Äì78), Lincoln College, Oxford (1980‚Äì82), the University of Edinburgh, Scotland (1983‚Äì87), the Jurisprudence and Social Policy Program at Boalt Hall School of Law at Berkeley (1986‚Äì96), Princeton University (1996‚Äì97), and Columbia Law School (1997‚Äì2006). He has also been a visiting professor at Cornell (1989‚Äì90), Otago (1991‚Äì92) and Columbia (1995) Universities. Currently at NYU he teaches Rule of Law, Jurisprudence, seminars on Property and Human Dignity and regularly hosts the Colloquium on Legal, Social and Political Philosophy, founded by Ronald Dworkin and Thomas Nagel in 1987, and currently convened by Liam Murphy, Samuel Scheffler, and Waldron.\n\nWaldron gave the second series of Seeley Lectures at Cambridge University in 1996, the 1999 Carlyle Lectures at Oxford, the spring 2000 University Lecture at Columbia Law School, the Wesson Lectures at Stanford University in 2004, the Storrs Lectures at Yale Law School in 2007, and the Gifford Lectures at the University of Edinburgh in 2015. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1998.\n\nIn 2005, Waldron received an honorary doctorate from the University of Otago, his alma mater.\n\nWaldron is a liberal and a normative legal positivist. He has written extensively on the analysis and justification of private property and on the political and legal philosophy of John Locke. He is an outspoken opponent of judicial review and of torture, both of which he believes to be in tension with democratic principles. He believes that hate speech should not be protected by the First Amendment. His later work is devoted to providing a non-religious and non-Kantian concept of human dignity, based on a thought experiment of leveling up all human beings to the high rank of nobility or aristocracy, thus constituting a single rank or caste. He has been working on this topic since he gave the Tanner Lectures on the subject in 2009, published in 2012 as \"Dignity, Rank and Rights\".\n\nWaldron has also criticized analytic legal philosophy for its failure to engage with the questions addressed by political theory.\n\nSandrine Baume has identified Jeremy Waldron and Bruce Ackerman as leading critics of the \"compatibility of judicial review with the very principles of democracy\". Baume identified John Hart Ely alongside Dworkin as the foremost defenders of this principle in recent years, while the opposition to this principle of \"compatibility\" were identified as Bruce Ackerman and Jeremy Waldron. In contrast to Waldron and Ackerman, Dworkin was a long-time advocate of a moral reading of the United States Constitution, whose lines of support he sees as strongly associated with enhanced versions of judicial review in the federal government.\n\nA staunch defender of the principle of democratic legislation, in an article titled \"The Core of the Case against Judicial Review\", Waldron has argued for a limited role for judicial review in a robust democratic government. Waldron asserts that there is no inherent advantage to a judiciary's protection of rights than to a legislature's if (1) there is a broadly democratic political system with appropriate suffrage and process,(2) there is a system of courts somewhat insulated from popular pressure and engaged in judicial review, there is a general commitment to rights, and there is disagreement as to the content and extent of rights. Even so, Waldron does not argue against the existence of judicial review, which may be appropriate when there is institutional dysfunction. In this case, the defense of judicial review compatible with democracy is limited to remedies for that dysfunction and are neither unlimited nor universal. Thus Waldron places his view of judicial review in the tradition of Justice Harlan Fiske Stone.\n\nIn a review of a 2015 book by Cass Sunstein, Waldron has stated that between the polarity represented by judges who can be \"heroic\" in the interpretation of their judgments and those who abstain, that his preference would be sympathetic to a position which could be described as \"judicial minimalism\". Waldron states his examples of such judges as including Sandra O'Connor, Ruth Ginsburg, and Felix Frankfurter.\n\nBooks\nArticles\n\n"}

{"id": "31002435", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31002435", "title": "Knowledge extraction", "text": "Knowledge extraction\n\nKnowledge extraction is the creation of knowledge from structured (relational databases, XML) and unstructured (text, documents, images) sources. The resulting knowledge needs to be in a machine-readable and machine-interpretable format and must represent knowledge in a manner that facilitates inferencing. Although it is methodically similar to information extraction (NLP) and ETL (data warehouse), the main criteria is that the extraction result goes beyond the creation of structured information or the transformation into a relational schema. It requires either the reuse of existing formal knowledge (reusing identifiers or ontologies) or the generation of a schema based on the source data.\n\nThe RDB2RDF W3C group is currently standardizing a language for extraction of resource description frameworks (RDF) from relational databases. Another popular example for knowledge extraction is the transformation of Wikipedia into structured data and also the mapping to existing knowledge (see DBpedia and Freebase).\n\nAfter the standardization of knowledge representation languages such as RDF and OWL, much research has been conducted in the area, especially regarding transforming relational databases into RDF, identity resolution, knowledge discovery and ontology learning. The general process uses traditional methods from information extraction and extract, transform, and load (ETL), which transform the data from the sources into structured formats.\n\nThe following criteria can be used to categorize approaches in this topic (some of them only account for extraction from relational databases):\n\n\nPresident Obama called Wednesday on Congress to extend a tax break for students included in last year's economic stimulus package, arguing that the policy provides more generous assistance. \n\n\nWhen building a RDB representation of a problem domain, the starting point is frequently an entity-relationship diagram (ERD). Typically, each entity is represented as a database table, each attribute of the entity becomes a column in that table, and relationships between entities are indicated by foreign keys. Each table typically defines a particular class of entity, each column one of its attributes. Each row in the table describes an entity\ninstance, uniquely identified by a primary key. The table rows collectively describe an entity set. In an equivalent RDF representation of the same entity set:\n\nSo, to render an equivalent view based on RDF semantics, the basic mapping algorithm would be as follows:\n\nEarly mentioning of this basic or direct mapping can be found in Tim Berners-Lee's comparison of the ER model to the RDF model.\n\nThe 1:1 mapping mentioned above exposes the legacy data as RDF in a straightforward way, additional refinements can be employed to improve the usefulness of RDF output respective the given Use Cases. Normally, information is lost during the transformation of an entity-relationship diagram (ERD) to relational tables (Details can be found in object-relational impedance mismatch) and has to be reverse engineered. From a conceptual view, approaches for extraction can come from two directions. The first direction tries to extract or learn an OWL schema from the given database schema. Early approaches used a fixed amount of manually created mapping rules to refine the 1:1 mapping. More elaborate methods are employing heuristics or learning algorithms to induce schematic information (methods overlap with ontology learning). While some approaches try to extract the information from the structure inherent in the SQL schema (analysing e.g. foreign keys), others analyse the content and the values in the tables to create conceptual hierarchies (e.g. a columns with few values are candidates for becoming categories). The second direction tries to map the schema and its contents to a pre-existing domain ontology (see also: ontology alignment). Often, however, a suitable domain ontology does not exist and has to be created first.\n\nAs XML is structured as a tree, any data can be easily represented in RDF, which is structured as a graph. XML2RDF is one example of an approach that uses RDF blank nodes and transforms XML elements and attributes to RDF properties. The topic however is more complex as in the case of relational databases. In a relational table the primary key is an ideal candidate for becoming the subject of the extracted triples. An XML element, however, can be transformed - depending on the context- as a subject, a predicate or object of a triple. XSLT can be used a standard transformation language to manually convert XML to RDF.\n\nThe largest portion of information contained in business documents (about 80%) is encoded in natural language and therefore unstructured. Because unstructured data is rather a challenge for knowledge extraction, more sophisticated methods are required, which generally tend to supply worse results compared to structured data. The potential for a massive acquisition of extracted knowledge, however, should compensate the increased complexity and decreased quality of extraction. In the following, natural language sources are understood as sources of information, where the data is given in an unstructured fashion as plain text. If the given text is additionally embedded in a markup document (e. g. HTML document), the mentioned systems normally remove the markup elements automatically.\n\nTraditional information extraction is a technology of natural language processing, which extracts information from typically natural language texts and structures these in a suitable manner. The kinds of information to be identified must be specified in a model before beginning the process, which is why the whole process of traditional Information Extraction is domain dependent. The IE is split in the following five subtasks.\n\n\nThe task of named entity recognition is to recognize and to categorize all named entities contained in a text (assignment of a named entity to a predefined category). This works by application of grammar based methods or statistical models.\n\nCoreference resolution identifies equivalent entities, which were recognized by NER, within a text. There are two relevant kinds of equivalence relationship. The first one relates to the relationship between two different represented entities (e.g. IBM Europe and IBM) and the second one to the relationship between an entity and their anaphoric references (e.g. it and IBM). Both kinds can be recognized by coreference resolution.\n\nDuring template element construction the IE system identifies descriptive properties of entities, recognized by NER and CO. These properties correspond to ordinary qualities like red or big.\n\nTemplate relation construction identifies relations, which exist between the template elements. These relations can be of several kinds, such as works-for or located-in, with the restriction, that both domain and range correspond to entities.\n\nIn the template scenario production events, which are described in the text, will be identified and structured with respect to the entities, recognized by NER and CO and relations, identified by TR.\n\nOntology-based information extraction is a subfield of information extraction, with which at least one ontology is used to guide the process of information extraction from natural language text. The OBIE system uses methods of traditional information extraction to identify concepts, instances and relations of the used ontologies in the text, which will be structured to an ontology after the process. Thus, the input ontologies constitute the model of information to be extracted.\n\nOntology learning is the automatic or semi-automatic creation of ontologies, including extracting the corresponding domain's terms from natural language text. As building ontologies manually is extremely labor-intensive and time consuming, there is great motivation to automate the process.\n\nDuring semantic annotation, natural language text is augmented with metadata (often represented in RDFa), which should make the semantics of contained terms machine-understandable. At this process, which is generally semi-automatic, knowledge is extracted in the sense, that a link between lexical terms and for example concepts from ontologies is established. Thus, knowledge is gained, which meaning of a term in the processed context was intended and therefore the meaning of the text is grounded in machine-readable data with the ability to draw inferences. Semantic annotation is typically split into the following two subtasks.\n\n\nAt the terminology extraction level, lexical terms from the text are extracted. For this purpose a tokenizer determines at first the word boundaries and solves abbreviations. Afterwards terms from the text, which correspond to a concept, are extracted with the help of a domain-specific lexicon to link these at entity linking.\n\nIn entity linking a link between the extracted lexical terms from the source text and the concepts from an ontology or knowledge base such as DBpedia is established. For this, candidate-concepts are detected appropriately to the several meanings of a term with the help of a lexicon. Finally, the context of the terms is analyzed to determine the most appropriate disambiguation and to assign the term to the correct concept.\n\nThe following criteria can be used to categorize tools, which extract knowledge from natural language text.\n\nThe following table characterizes some tools for Knowledge Extraction from natural language sources.\n\nKnowledge discovery describes the process of automatically searching large volumes of data for patterns that can be considered knowledge \"about\" the data. It is often described as \"deriving\" knowledge from the input data. Knowledge discovery developed out of the data mining domain, and is closely related to it both in terms of methodology and terminology.\n\nThe most well-known branch of data mining is knowledge discovery, also known as knowledge discovery in databases (KDD). Just as many other forms of knowledge discovery it creates abstractions of the input data. The \"knowledge\" obtained through the process may become additional \"data\" that can be used for further usage and discovery. Often the outcomes from knowledge discovery are not actionable, actionable knowledge discovery, also known as domain driven data mining, aims to discover and deliver actionable knowledge and insights.\n\nAnother promising application of knowledge discovery is in the area of software modernization, weakness discovery and compliance which involves understanding existing software artifacts. This process is related to a concept of reverse engineering. Usually the knowledge obtained from existing software is presented in the form of models to which specific queries can be made when necessary. An entity relationship is a frequent format of representing knowledge obtained from existing software. Object Management Group (OMG) developed specification Knowledge Discovery Metamodel (KDM) which defines an ontology for the software assets and their relationships for the purpose of performing knowledge discovery of existing code. Knowledge discovery from existing software systems, also known as software mining is closely related to data mining, since existing software artifacts contain enormous value for risk management and business value, key for the evaluation and evolution of software systems. Instead of mining individual data sets, software mining focuses on metadata, such as process flows (e.g. data flows, control flows, & call maps), architecture, database schemas, and business rules/terms/process.\n\n\n\n"}

The use of the prefix in this sense occurs occasionally in scientific English terms derived from Greek. For example: the term \"Metatheria\" (the name for the clade of marsupial mammals) uses the prefix \"meta-\" in the sense the \"Metatheria\" occur on the tree of life adjacent to the \"Theria\" (the placental mammals).\n\nIn epistemology, and often in common use, the prefix \"meta-\" is used to mean \"about (its own category)\". For example, metadata are data about data (who has produced them, when, what format the data are in and so on). In a database, metadata are also data about data stored in a data dictionary and describe information (data) about database tables such as the table name, table owner, details about columns, ‚Äì essentially describing the table. Also, metamemory in psychology means an individual's knowledge about whether or not they would remember something if they concentrated on recalling it. The modern sense of \"an X about X\" has given rise to concepts like \"meta-cognition\" (i.e. cognition about cognition), \"meta-emotion\" (i.e. emotion about emotion), \"meta-discussion\" (i.e. discussion about discussion), \"meta-joke\" (i.e. joke about jokes), and \"metaprogramming\" (i.e. writing programs that manipulate programs).\n\nIn a rule-based system, a metarule is a rule governing the application of other rules.\n\nAny subject can be said to have a \"metatheory\", a theoretical consideration of its properties, such as its foundations, methods, form and utility, on a higher level of abstraction. In linguistics, a grammar is considered as being expressed in a metalanguage, language operating on a higher level to describe properties of the plain language (and not itself).\n\nThe prefix comes from the Greek preposition and prefix \"meta-\" (ŒºŒµœÑŒ¨-), from ŒºŒµœÑŒ¨, which meant \"after\", \"beside\", \"with\", \"among\" (with respect to the preposition, some of these meanings were distinguished by case marking). Other meanings include \"beyond\", \"adjacent\" and \"self\", and it is also used in the form ŒºŒ∑œÑŒ±- as a prefix in Greek, with variants ŒºŒµœÑ- before vowels and ŒºŒµŒ∏- \"meth-\" before aspirated vowels.\n\nThe earliest form of the word \"meta\" is the Mycenaean Greek \"me-ta\", written in Linear B syllabic script. The Greek preposition is cognate with the Old English preposition \"mid\" \"with\", still found as a prefix in \"midwife\". Its use in English is the result of back-formation from the word \"metaphysics\". In origin \"Metaphysics\" was just the title of one of the principal works of Aristotle; it was so named (by Andronicus of Rhodes) because in the customary ordering of the works of Aristotle it was the book following \"Physics\"; it thus meant nothing more than \"[the book that comes] after [the book entitled] \"Physics\"\". However, even Latin writers misinterpreted this as entailing metaphysics constituted \"the science of what is beyond the physical\". Nonetheless, Aristotle's \"Metaphysics\" enunciates considerations of natures above physical realities, which one can examine through this particular part of philosophy, e.g., the existence of God. The use of the prefix was later extended to other contexts based on the understanding of metaphysics to mean \"the science of what is beyond the physical\".\n\nThe \"Oxford English Dictionary\" cites uses of the meta- prefix as \"beyond, about\" (such as meta-economics and meta-philosophy) going back to 1917. However, these formations are parallel to the original \"metaphysics\" and \"metaphysical\", that is, as a prefix to general nouns (fields of study) or adjectives. Going by the \"OED\" citations, it began being used with specific nouns in connection with mathematical logic sometime before 1929. (In 1920 David Hilbert proposed a research project in what was called \"metamathematics.\")\n\nA notable early citation is Quine's 1937 use of the word \"metatheorem\", where meta- has the modern meaning of \"an X about X\". (Note earlier uses of \"meta-economics\" and even \"metaphysics\" do not have this doubled conceptual structure ‚Äì they are about or beyond X but they do not themselves constitute an X).\n\nDouglas Hofstadter, in his 1979 book \"G√∂del, Escher, Bach\" (and in the sequel, \"Metamagical Themas\"), popularized this meaning of the term. The book, which deals with self-reference and strange loops, and touches on Quine and his work, was influential in many computer-related subcultures and may be responsible for the popularity of the prefix, for its use as a solo term, and for the many recent coinages which use it. Hofstadter uses meta as a stand-alone word, as an adjective and as a directional preposition (\"going meta,\" a term he coins for the old rhetorical trick of taking a debate or analysis to another level of abstraction, as when somebody says \"This debate isn't going anywhere\"). This book may also be responsible for the association of \"meta\" with strange loops, as opposed to just abstraction.

In 1950, he graduated from the Faculty of Philosophy in Zagreb, where he commenced his work as a teaching assistant working in the fields of ethics and aesthetics. Between 1962 and 1964, he studied in Heidelberg, Germany. He became a tenured professor in 1972 and he held this position until his retirement in 1993.\n\nKangrga started his confrontation with the Yugoslav communist leadership during his undergraduate studies in February 1948, before the clash of Joseph Broz Tito with Joseph Stalin. Then, he published his first philosophical article entitled \"On Ethics\" in \"Studentski list\" (Zagreb), which the League of Communists of Yugoslavia bureaucrats found provoking. In 1953, Kangrga became a member of the LCY but in 1954 he was expelled from the party because he announced that he was inspired to become a communist by the works of Miroslav Krle≈æa, who still wasn't wholly rehabilitated by the regime.\n\nIn 1964, Kangrga was one of the founders of the journal \"Praxis\". Together with Rudi Supek, he has established the Korƒçula Summer School, which was a unique meeting place for philosophers from the East and the West between 1964 and 1974. It is around these two institutions that the Praxis school took shape. The defining features of the school were: 1) emphasis on the writings of young Marx; and 2) call for freedom of speech in both East and West based upon Marx's insistence on ruthless critique of everything existent. Milan Kangrga emphasized creativity as well, but also the understanding of human beings as producers humanizing nature.\n\nWhile he was critical of the Communist party in Yugoslavia, mainly for not implementing self-management socialism, he rejected non-Socialist reactions against SFR Yugoslavia, the most notable one being the Croatian Spring.\n\nMilan Kangrga has lectured in Bonn, M√ºnich, Prague, Budapest, Moscow, and Kiev among other cities. His articles have been published in Germany, Italy, the United States, France, Spain, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Austria and Mexico.\n\nKangrga has published 15 books. The most important are:\n\n"}

He illustrates the concept with an example that deals with a specific group of Alzheimer's patients in St. Louis (from p.¬†140 of the book \"Natural-Born Cyborgs\"):\n\nThese patients were a puzzle because although they still lived alone, successfully, in the city, they really should not have been able to do so. On standard psychological tests they performed rather dismally. They should have been unable to cope with the demands of daily life. What was going on?\n\nA sequence of visits to their home environments provided the answer. These home environments, it transpired, were wonderfully calibrated to support and scaffold these biological brains. The homes were stuffed full of cognitive props, tools, and aids. Examples included message centers where they stored notes about what to do and when; photos of family and friends complete with indications of names and relationships; labels and pictures on doors; \"memory books\" to record new events, meetings, and plans; and \"open-storage\" strategies in which crucial items (pots, pans, checkbooks) are always kept in plain view, not locked away in drawers.\n\nBefore you allow this image of intensive scaffolding to simply confirm your opinion of these patients as hopelessly cognitively compromised, try to imagine a world in which normal human brains are somewhat Alzheimic. Imagine that in this world we had gradually evolved a society in which the kinds of scaffolding found in the St. Louis home environments were the norm. And then reflect that, in a certain sense, this is exactly what we have done. Our own pens, paper, notebooks, diaries, and alarm clocks complement our brute biological profiles in much the same kind of way. Yet we never say of the artist, or poet, or scientist, \"Oh, poor soul -- she is not really responsible for that painting/theory/poem; for don't you see how she had to rely on pen, paper, and sketches to offset the inadequacies of her own brain?\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2880916", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2880916", "title": "National Higher Education Entrance Examination", "text": "National Higher Education Entrance Examination\n\nThe National College Entrance Examination (NCEE), commonly known as Gaokao (È´òËÄÉ, \"Higher Education Exam\", Pinyin \"gƒÅo k«éo\", lit. \"High exam\"), is an academic examination held annually in the People's Republic of China (except Hong Kong and Macau, which have their own education systems). This examination is a prerequisite for entrance into almost all higher education institutions at the undergraduate level. It is usually taken by students in their last year of senior high school, although there has been no age restriction since 2001.\n\nThe exams last about nine hours over a period of two days, depending on the province. Chinese and mathematics are included in all tests. An English test was formerly required of all students, but now Japanese, Russian or French may be taken instead. In addition, students must choose between two concentrations in most regions, either the social-science-oriented area (ÊñáÁßëÂÄæÂêë) or the natural-science-oriented area (ÁêÜÁßëÂÄæÂêë). Students who choose social sciences receive further testing in history, politics and geography (ÊñáÁßëÁªºÂêà), while those who choose natural sciences are tested in physics, chemistry and biology (ÁêÜÁßëÁªºÂêà). \n\nIn 2006, a record high of 9.5 million people applied for tertiary education entry in China. Of these, 8.8 million (93%) took the national entrance exam and 27,600 (0.28%) were exempted (‰øùÈÄÅ) due to exceptional or special talent. Everyone else (700,000 students) took other standardized entrance exams, such as those designed for adult education students.\n\nThe overall mark received by the student is generally a weighted sum of their subject marks. The maximum possible mark varies widely from year to year and also varies from province to province.\n\nThe modern College Entrance Examination takes place from 7 to 9 June every year. \n\nThe National Higher Education Entrance Examination, commonly known as the gaokao (È´òËÄÉ) was created in 1952.\n\nThe unified national tertiary entrance examination in 1952 marked the start of reform of National Matriculation Tests Policies (NMTP) in the newly established PRC. With the implementation of the first Five Year Plan in 1953, the NMTP was further enhanced. After repeated discussions and experiments, the NMTP was eventually set as a fundamental policy system in 1959. From 1958, the tertiary entrance examination system was affected by the Great Leap Forward Movement. Soon, unified recruitment was replaced by separate recruitment by individual or allied tertiary education institutions. Meanwhile, political censorship on candidate students was enhanced. Since 1962, criticism of the NMTP system had become even harsher, because it hurt benefits of the working class. On July 1966, the NMTP was officially canceled and substituted by a new admission policy of recommending workers, farmers and soldiers to college. During the next ten years, the Down to the Countryside Movement, initiated by Mao Zedong, forced both senior and junior secondary school graduates, the so-called \"intellectual youths\", to go to the country and work as farmers in the villages. Against the backdrop of world revolution, millions of such young people, some full of religious-like fervor, joined the ranks of farmers, working and living alongside them. However, they were soon disillusioned by the reality of hard conditions in the countryside. \n\nIn the early 1970s, Mao Zedong realized that internal political struggle had taken too big a toll on him as well as the nation and decided to resume the operation of universities. However, the students were selected based on political and family backgrounds rather than academic achievements. This practice continued until the death of Mao in September 1976. In late 1977, Deng Xiaoping, then under Hua Guofeng, the heir apparent of Mao, officially resumed the traditional examination based on academics, the National Higher Education Entrance Examination, which has continued to the present day.\n\nThe first such examination after the Cultural Revolution took place in late 1977 and was a history-making event. There was no limit on the age or official educational background of examinees. Consequently, most of the hopefuls who had accumulated during the ten years of the Cultural Revolution and many others who simply wanted to try their luck emerged from society for the examination. The youngest were in their early teens and the oldest were in their late thirties. The questions in the examinations were designed by the individual provinces. The total number of candidate students for the national college entrance exam in 1977 was as many as 5.7 million. Although the Ministry of Education eventually expanded enrollment, adding 63,000 more to the admission quota, the admission ratio of 4.8% was the lowest in the history of the PRC, with only 272,971 students being admitted.\n\nStarting from 1978, the examination was uniformly designed by the Ministry of Education and all the students across the country took exactly the same examination.\n\nHowever, reforms on the content and form of the exam have never stopped, among which the permission for individual provinces to customize their own exams has been the most salient. The Ministry of Education allowed the College Enrollment Office of Shanghai to employ an independent exam in 1985, which was the beginning of provincial proposition. In the same year, Guangdong was also permitted to adopt independent proposition. Starting from 2003, Beijing, Tianjin, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang were allowed to adopt independent propositions. Till now, there have been 16 provinces and municipalities adopting customized exams.\n\nAlthough today's admission rate is much higher than in 1977, 1978 and before the 1990s, it is still fairly low compared to the availability of higher education in the Western world. Consequently, the examination is highly competitive, and the prospective examinees and their parents experience enormous pressure. For the majority, it is a watershed that divides two dramatically different lives.\n\nIn 1970, less than 1% of Chinese people had attended higher education; however, university admissions places are less than 1/1000 of the whole population of China. In the 1970s, 70% of students who were recommended to go to university had political backgrounds reflecting the political nature of university selection at the time. At the same time, the undergraduate course system narrowed down the time from 4 years to 3 years. According to incomplete statistics, from 1966 to 1977, institutions of higher learning recruited 940,000 people who belonged to the worker-peasant-soldier group.\n\nFor most provinces, the National Higher Education Entrance Examination is held once a year (in recent years some of the provinces in China hold examinations twice a year and the extra one is called the Spring Entrance Examination). The previous schedule (before 2003) of the National Higher Education Entrance Examination was in July every year. It now takes place in June every year. Partial Provincial administrative units determine the schedule of the exams on the 7th and 8 June.\n\n9.40 million students attended Gaokao in 2017, 7 million of whom were admitted by colleges and/or universities. The percentage of first-class admission (Yi Ben, deemed as good universities in China) varied from 9.48% to 30.5%,with the lowest admission rates in Henan province and Shanxi province, at less than 10%.\n\nthe changes of the exam scope in 2017 (in most areas)\n\nChinese \n\nAll the exam contents are set into compulsory examination scope.\n\nMathematics\n\nElective Course 4-1 (Selection of Geometric Proof) is removed from the elective examination scope.\n\nEnglish\n\nNo changes.\n\nPhysics\n\nElective Course 3-5 is changed from the elective examination scope into the compulsory examination scope.\n\nChemistry\n\nElective Course 2 (Chemistry and Technology) is removed from the elective examination scope.\n\nBiology\n\nSome exam contents in the elective examination scope are changed.\n\nPolitics\n\nNo changes.\n\nHistory\n\nElective Course 2 (Democratic Thought and Practice in Modern Society) is removed from the elective examination scope.\n\nGeography\n\nElective Course 5 (Natural Disasters and Prevention) is removed from the elective examination scope.\n\n9.75 million students attended Gaokao on June 7th and 8th. A citizen from zhihu, Chinese quora, reported that Guangdong donghua school had leaked some questions a day before Gaokao. The article was subsequently deleted by zhihu.\n\nNote: When reading the table below, the Chinese word \"‰∏á\" means ten thousands in English.\nThe National Higher Education Entrance Examination is not uniform across the country, but administered uniformly within each province of China or each direct-controlled municipality. The National Higher Education Entrance Examination is graded variously across the country. It is arranged at the end of the spring semester and secondary school graduates across the country take the examination simultaneously over a three-day period. Prior to 2003, the examination was held in July, but has since been moved to the month of June. This move was made in consideration of the adverse effects of hot weather on students living in southern China and possible flooding during the rainy season in July.\n\nIn different places and across different time in history, students were required to apply for their intended university or college \"prior\" to the exam, \"after\" the exam, or more recently, \"after\" they learned of their scores, by filling a list of ordered preferences. The application list is classified into several tiers (including at least early admissions, key universities, regular universities, vocational colleges), each of which can contain around 4-6 intended choices in institution and program, though typically an institution or program would only admit students who apply to it as their first choice in each tier. In some places, students are allowed to apply for different tiers at different times. For example, in Shanghai, students apply for early admission, key universities and regular universities prior to the exam, but can apply for other colleges after they learned of their scores.\n\nThe exam is administered for two or three days. Three subjects are mandatory everywhere: Chinese, Mathematics, and a foreign language‚Äîusually English, but this may also be substituted by Russian, Japanese, German, French or Spanish. The other six standard subjects are three sciences: Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and three humanities: History, Geography, and Political Education. Applicants to science/engineering or art/humanities programs typically take one to three from the respective category. Since the 2000s, an integrated test, science integrated test, humanities integrated test or wider integrated test has been introduced in some places. This integrated test may or may not be considered during admission. In addition, some special regional subjects are required or optional in some places. Currently, the actual requirement varies from province to province.\n\nHowever, the general requirements are as follows:\n\nThe following groups are prohibited from taking the exam:\n\nApplicants to some specialist programs are also screened by additional criteria: some art departments (e.g. audition), military and police schools (political screening and physical exam), and some sports programs (tryout).\n\nScores obtained in the examinations can be used in applying universities outside mainland China. Among all the places, the counterpart Hong Kong is on their top list. In 2007, 7 students with overall highest score in their provinces entered Hong Kong's universities rather than the two major universities in mainland China. In 2010, over 1,200 students entered the 12 local institutions which provide tertiary education courses through this examination. In addition, City University of Hong Kong and Chinese University of Hong Kong directly participate in the application procedure like other mainland universities.\n\nThe examination is essentially the only criterion for tertiary education admissions. A poor performance on the test almost always means giving up on that goal. Students hoping to attend university will spend most of their waking moments studying prior to the exam. If they fail in their first attempt, some of them repeat the last year of high school life and make another attempt the following year.\n\nThe subjects tested in the National Higher Education Entrance Examination have changed over time. Traditionally, students would undertake either a set of \"arts\" subjects or a set of \"science\" subjects, with some shared compulsory subjects. The subjects taken in the Examination affected the degree or career paths open to the student. In recent years, different provinces have included different subjects in the Examination, or implemented flexible systems for selecting the subjects to be tested, resulting in a number of different systems.\n\nAs a pilot examination system used in order to promote education system reform, this examination system has been implemented in most parts of the country, including Beijing City, Tianjin City, Hebei Province, Liaoning Province, Jilin Province, Heilongjiang Province, Anhui Province, Fujian Province, Guangdong Province, Jiangxi Province, Henan Province, Shandong Province, Hubei Province, Shaanxi Province, Sichuan Province, Guizhou Province, Yunnan Province, Shanxi Province, Chongqing City, Gansu Province, Qinghai Province, Inner Mongolia, Guangxi, Ningxia, Xinjiang and Tibet. In the context of the reform of the National College Entrance Examination, this program will be suspended in Beijing, Tianjin, Shandong and Hainan provinces from 2020, and will be suspended in most provinces and cities in China from 2021. It will cease across Mainland China by 2022.\n\n\nThis system was used after the New Curriculum Reform being employed in Guangdong province, and now it has been abandoned.\n\nThis system has been implemented in Shanghai since the employment of comprehensive courses, now abandoned.\n\nThis is a pilot college entrance examination system implemented by the Jiangsu Province in 2003 after examining other testing systems, but it was replaced by \"3+2\" system in 2008. Subject tests will take turns into the embrace of National Standard. A new policy is expected to substitute the old one in 2021. \n\n\nThis is part of the curriculum reform in China.\n\n\"3+3\" system\n\nSummary of information about this program,see \"the Education of Sina.\" \n\n\nRegional imbalance of social and economic development has resulted in disparity in education levels across China, which gives rise to provincial proposition. However, provincial governments have to increase budget on education in order to offset the declining credibility of the exam caused by lack of experienced proposition experts and management personnel, which will, more or less, cause a repetitive investment in Human Resources, finance or material. For example,exam in Jiangsu is totally a different from others.It only counts the scores of the three major subjects,which means the total cents are decreased largely.To compete in a narrow range of score,students must focus on the study of The Three.The other two subjects are not recorded in total score but a class will be recorded,and universities has a requirement of a exact class.Different from the folk,the assessment is according to the percentage of students' examination results.Moreover,independent proposition covers regional discrimination generated by huge disparity of cut off scores between different provinces.\n\nChinese students are required to choose either Social Sciences (political science, geography, and history) or Natural Sciences (physics, chemistry, and biology). This happens particularly at the end of the first year of high school, when students are mostly 15-16 years old. Once they make their decisions, they start preparing for the subject tests, and no longer take classes for the other three subjects. This decision will determine which college entrance test they will take at the age of 18, as well as influence their college majors and future career path.\n\nA university usually sets a fixed admission quota for each province, with a higher number of students coming from its home province. As the advanced educational resources (number and quality of universities) are distributed unevenly across China, it is argued that people are being discriminated against during the admission process based on their geographic region. For example, compared to Beijing, Jiangxi province has fewer universities per capita. Therefore, Jiangxi usually receives fewer admission quotas compared with Beijing, which makes a significantly higher position among applicants necessary for a Jiangxi candidate to be admitted by the same university than his Beijing counterpart. The unequal admission schemes for different provinces and regions might intensify competition among examinees from provinces with fewer advanced education resources. For example, Beijing University planned to admit 1800 science students from Beijing (with 80,000 candidates in total), but only 38 from Shandong (with 660,000 candidates in total). This is not similar to the practice of regional universities in other countries which receive subsidies from regional governments in addition to or in place of those received from central governments, as universities in China largely depend on state budget rather than local budget. However, this regionally preferential policy does provide subsidies to minority students from under-developed regions that enjoy limited educational resources, such as Tibet and Xinjiang.\n\nThe regional discrimination can be proved by the disparities between ratios of a province's enrollment of students to the total number of candidate students of the province. In 2010, acceptance rate for students from Beijing, Shanghai, Shandong and Henan who applied for universities of the first-ranking category were 20.1%, 18%, 7.1% and 3.5% respectively. High acceptance rates are likely to appear in the most and least developed cities and provinces, such as Beijing, Shanghai or Qinghai. In contrast, acceptance rates remain relatively equal among provinces of the average developmental level.\n\nIn recent years, varied admission standards have led some families to relocate for the sole purpose of advancing their children's chances of entering university.\n\nIn addition, regional discrimination is not only restricted to the ratio for admission. This is best illustrated with an example of the Hubei Province, where students' exam scores have been higher than other provinces for a long time. A score for a Hubei student to just reach the admission cut-off line for a key university may be enough for a student from another province to be admitted by a much better university, and even enough for a Beijing student to be admitted by top universities like Tsinghua University and Peking University.\n\nSome local students in Hong Kong complained that it was unfair that the increasing intake of Mainland students who have performed at a high level in this examination increases the admission grades of universities, making it harder for local students to get admission. In 2010, more than 5,000 out of the 17,000 students who achieved the minimum university entry requirement were not offered places in any degree courses in the UGC-funded universities.\n\nThere are special concessions for members of ethnic minorities, foreign nationals, persons with family origin in Taiwan, and children of military casualties. Students can also receive bonus marks by achieving high results in academic Olympiads, other science and technology competitions, sporting competitions, as well as \"political or moral\" distinction. In 2018 NPC, the government admitted to cancel all bonus scores from competitions.\n\nBecause Gaokao is one of the most influential examinations in China and the fact that students can only take the test once a year, both teachers and students undergo tremendous pressure in preparing for and taking the exam. For teachers, because the society focuses on the rate of admission into universities, teachers have to pay more attention to each student's ability to take the exam. Because of this, teachers would like to give students more and more practice for exams. This teaching methodology, colloquially referred to as \"cramming\", involves students memorizing large volumes of information fed to them by teachers and undertaking many practice exercises in order to optimize exam writing ability. One of the disadvantages of this method is the lack of focus on teaching critical thinking and ignoring students' emotions, values and personalities. Many examinees suffer from severe nervousness during the test. In some cases, examinees may faint in the examination room.\n\nFurther and deeper stemming criticisms have been leveled that the testing system is the \"most pressure packed examination in the world.\" Behaviors surrounding the testing period have been extreme under some reports, with doctors in Tianjin purportedly prescribing birth control pills to female students whose parents wanted to ensure the girls were not menstruating at the time of examination. Testing pressure, for some critics, has been linked to faintings, increased drop out rates, and even increasing rates of teenage clinical depression and suicide in China.\n\nThe Gaokao tends to rule the lives of most Chinese teenagers and their parents. In Zhengzhou (Henan), the local bus company parked a 985 number bus outside a Gaokao center for parents to wait in, the number reflecting a popular enrollment program number for university entrances.\n\nThe following are the exam scope for Gaokao in most areas of China, not including some areas that have their own exam scope. The contents refer to the textbooks from People's Education Press.\n\nStudents in some schools also take other Elective Courses (such as Study of Chinese Cultural Classics, Appreciation of Chinese Novels) because Chinese does not have an exact exam scope.\n\nCurrently, in the area of implement the Reform of the National College Entrance Examination, all high school students use such mathematics textbooks. Because the textbooks associated with this reform are still being written and not put into use. \n\n\nBesides Compulsory Courses, the compulsory exam scope for Social Sciences contains the two Elective Courses of series 1. Most contents in Elective Courses of series 1 are also contained in Elective Courses of series 2, but some contents in Elective Courses of series 2 is not contained in Elective Courses of series 1. This makes Mathematics exam easier for Social Sciences than for Natural Sciences.\nThe contents with * are not for Social Sciences.\n\nBesides Compulsory Courses, the compulsory exam scope for Natural Sciences also contains the three Elective Courses of series 2, so the Elective Courses of series 2 are regarded as compulsory courses for Natural Sciences. Most contents in Elective Courses of series 1 are also contained in Elective Courses of series 2, but some contents in Elective Courses of series 2 is not contained in Elective Courses of series 1. This makes Mathematics exam easier for Social Sciences than for Natural Sciences.\nThe contents with * are not for Social Sciences.\n\nAt least one of the following Elective Courses must be elected.\n\nStudents in some schools also take Elective Course 9, 10 and 11 because English does not have an exact exam scope.\n\nBesides Compulsory Courses, the compulsory exam scope also contains Elective Course 3-1, Elective Course 3-2 and Elective Course 3-5, so Elective Course 3-1, Elective Course 3-2 and Elective Course 3-5 are regarded as compulsory courses for Natural Sciences.\n\nFor Natural Sciences, at least one of the following Elective Courses must be elected.\n\nBesides Compulsory Courses, the compulsory exam scope also contains Elective Course 4 (Chemical Reaction Principle), so Elective Course 4 (Chemical Reaction Principle) is regarded as a compulsory course for Natural Sciences.\n\nFor Natural Sciences, at least one of the following Elective Courses must be elected.\n\n\nFor Natural Sciences, at least one of the following Elective Courses must be elected.\n\n\nFor Social Sciences, at least one of the following Elective Courses must be elected.\n\n\nFor Social Sciences, at least one of the following Elective Courses must be elected.\n\n\nI.modern article reading (36 scores)\n\nquestion 1 to 3 (3 scores for each) : single choice questions with four options\n\nquestion 4 (3 scores) : single choice question with four options\n\nquestion 5 (6 scores) : non choice question\n\nquestion 6 (6 scores) : non choice question\n\nquestion 7 and 8 (3 scores for each question) : single choice questions with four options\n\nquestion 9 (6 scores) : non choice question\n\nII.ancient poetry and article reading (34 scores)\n\nquestion 10 to 12 (3 scores for each question) : single choice questions with four options\n\nquestion 13 (10 scores) : translate 2 sentences\n\nquestion 14 (3 scores) : single choice question with four options\n\nquestion 15 (6 scores) : non choice question\n\nquestion 16 (6 scores) : sentences from 64 poems and articles (14 in senior high school and 50 in junior high school)\n\nIII.language use (20 scores)\n\nquestion 17 to 19 (3 scores for each question) : single choice questions with four options\n\nquestion 20 (5 scores) : non choice question\n\nquestion 21 (6 scores) : non choice question\n\nIV.writing (60 scores)\n\nquestion 22 (60 scores) : at least 800 characters\n\nI.choice questions (12 questions, 5 scores for each, 60 scores in total)\n\nquestion 1 to 12 : single choice questions with four options\n\nII.fill-in-the-blanks questions (4 questions, 5 scores for each, 20 scores in total)\n\nquestion 13 to 16\n\nIII.answer questions (70 scores in total)\n\nquestion 17 to 21 (12 scores for each)\n\nquestion 22 (10 scores) : Elective Course 4-4 (Coordinate System and Parameter Equation)\n\nquestion 23 (10 scores) : Elective Course 4-5 (Selection of Inequalities)\n\nI.listening (30 scores)\n\nquestion 1 to 5 : single choice questions with three options\n\nquestion 6 to 20 : single choice questions with three options\n\nII.reading comprehension (40 scores)\n\nquestion 21 to 35 : single choice questions with four options\n\nquestion 36 to 40 : five blanks in an article\n\nIII.application of linguistic knowledge (45 scores)\n\nquestion 41 to 60 : single choice questions with four options\n\nquestion 61 to 70 : ten blanks in an article, which need to be filled with a word or the correct form of the word in the parentheses\n\nIV.writing (35 scores)\n\nTen errors in an article need to be corrected by adding, deleting or modifying a word.

Except for a few statutory exemptions and in some medical cases there is no corresponding defense in English law for murder.\n\nFor example, a drunk driver might contend that he drove his car to get away from a kidnap (cf. \"North by Northwest\"). Most common law and civil law jurisdictions recognize this defense, but only under limited circumstances. Generally, the defendant must affirmatively show (i.e., introduce some evidence) that (a) the harm he sought to avoid outweighs the danger of the prohibited conduct he is charged with; (b) he had no reasonable alternative; (c) he ceased to engage in the prohibited conduct as soon as the danger passed; and (d) he did not himself create the danger he sought to avoid. Thus, with the \"drunk driver\" example cited above, the necessity defense will not be recognized if the defendant drove further than was reasonably necessary to get away from the kidnapper, or if some other reasonable alternative was available to him.\n\nAs a matter of political expediency, states usually allow some classes of person to be excused from liability when they are engaged in socially useful functions but intentionally cause injury, loss or damage. For example, the fire services and other civil defence organizations have a general duty to keep the community safe from harm. If a fire or flood is threatening to spread out of control, it may be reasonably necessary to destroy other property to form a fire break, or to trespass on land to throw up mounds of earth to prevent the water from spreading. These examples have the common feature of individuals intentionally breaking the law because they believe it to be urgently necessary to protect others from harm, but some states distinguish between a response to a crisis arising from an entirely natural cause (an inanimate force of nature), e.g. a fire from a lightning strike or rain from a storm, and a response to an entirely human crisis. Thus, parents who lack the financial means to feed their children cannot use necessity as a defense if they steal food. The existence of welfare benefits and strategies other than self-help defeat the claim of an urgent necessity that cannot be avoided in any way other than by breaking the law. Further, some states apply a test of proportionality. So the defense would only be allowed where the degree of harm actually caused was a reasonably proportionate response to the degree of harm threatened. This is a legal form of cost‚Äìbenefit analysis.\n\n\nEmergency law/right (\"n√∏dret\", \"n√∏drett\") is the equivalent of necessity in Denmark and Norway. It is considered related to but separate from self-defence. Common legal examples of necessity includes: breaking windows and other objects in order to escape a fire, commandeering a vehicle to serve as an emergency ambulance, ignoring traffic rules while rushing a dying patient to a hospital, and even killing a person who poses an immediate threat to several other people not including yourself. In the last case self-defense laws are not enough, but the case is covered by \"n√∏dret\". \"N√∏dret\" can only be invoked though when no other option is available.\n\nUnder international law, an obligation of customary international law or an obligation granted under a bilateral investment treaty may be suspended under the doctrine of necessity. It is \"an exception from illegality and in certain cases even as an exception from responsibility.\" \"See Continental Casualty Company v Argentine Republic, ICSID Case No ARB/03/09.\" \nIn order to invoke the doctrine of necessity:\n(1) The invoking State must not have contributed to the state of necessity,\n(2) Actions taken were the only way to safeguard an essential interest from grave and impending danger.\n\"Id. at page 72, paragraph 165.\"\n\nNecessity is a possible defense per the Criminal Code and the Administrative Penalty Act.\n\nNecessity as a defense to criminal acts conducted to meet political ends was rejected in the case of \"United States v. Schoon\". In that case, 30 people, including appellants, gained admittance to the IRS office in Tucson, where they chanted \"keep America's tax dollars out of El Salvador,\" splashed simulated blood on the counters, walls, and carpeting, and generally obstructed the office's operation. The court ruled that the elements of necessity did not exist in this case.\n\n\nNecessity is a defence per the Penal Code.\nThis requires lack of criminal intent, good faith (due care and attention), and the goal of preventing harm. The harm must be sufficiently serious and imminent to justify or excuse the act.\n\nIn Canada, Necessity is recognized as a defence for crimes committed in urgent situations of clear and imminent peril in which the accused has no safe or legal way out of the situation. \n\nThree Requirements for defence of necessity:\n(1) Urgent situation of imminent peril or danger \n(2) No reasonable legal alternative\n(3) Proportionality between harm inflicted and harm avoided\n\nIt should also be noted that the first and second element are evaluated on the modified objective standard. The third element is evaluated on a purely objective standard.

Nicholas is known principally for developing skepticism to extreme logical conclusions. He is sometimes considered the sole genuinely skeptic philosopher of medieval times. Nicholas founded his skeptical position on arguments that knowledge claims were not \"reducible to the first principle,\" that is, that it was not contradictory to deny them. His views have been compared to those of David Hume, but it has been suggested that the similarities are superficial, and there is no evidence Nicholas influenced Hume, or other modern philosophers such as Ren√© Descartes. Whether Nicholas was committed to skepticism is unclear, but on 19 May 1346 his views were condemned by Pope Clement VI as heretical. Nicholas was sentenced to burn his books publicly and recant, which he did in Paris in 1347.\n\nIn the 14th century, Nicholas of Autrecourt considered that matter, space, and time were all made up of indivisible atoms, points, and instants and that all generation and corruption took place by the rearrangement of material atoms. The similarities of his ideas with those of al-Ghazali suggest that Nicholas was familiar with the work of al-Ghazali, who was known as \"Algazel\" in Europe, either directly or indirectly through Averroes.\n\nMuch of the extant knowledge of Nicholas of Autrecourt's epistemology derives from one letter written by magister Egidius (master Giles) to Nicholas and an excerpt from his letter in reply to Egidius and from nine letters written by Nicholas to the Franciscan theologian Bernardus Aretinus (Bernard of Arezzo); however, only two of the nine letters survive. Some fragments of the lost letters are quoted in the records of the condemnatory proceedings against Nicholas. Almost nothing is known about these two correspondents.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "991217", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=991217", "title": "Perspectivism", "text": "Perspectivism\n\nPerspectivism () is the philosophical view (touched upon as far back as Plato's rendition of Protagoras) that all ideations take place from particular perspectives, and that there are many possible conceptual schemes, or perspectives in which judgment of truth or value can be made. This is often taken to imply that no way of seeing the world can be taken as definitively \"true\", but does \"not\" necessarily entail that all perspectives are equally valid. The term was coined by nineteenth-century philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche.\n\nPerspectivism rejects objective metaphysics, claiming that no evaluation of objectivity can transcend cultural formations or subjective designations. Therefore, there are no objective facts, nor any knowledge of a thing-in-itself. Truth is separated from any particular vantage point, and so there are no ethical or epistemological absolutes. Rules (i.e., those of philosophy, the scientific method, etc.) are constantly reassessed according to the circumstances of individual perspectives. \"Truth\" is thus created by integrating different vantage points together.\n\nPeople always adopt perspectives by default ‚Äì whether they are aware of it or not ‚Äì and the concepts of one's existence are defined by the circumstances surrounding that individual. Truth is made by and for individuals and peoples. This view differs from many types of relativism which consider the truth of a particular proposition as something that altogether cannot be evaluated with respect to an \"absolute truth\", without taking into consideration culture and context.\n\nThis view is outlined in an aphorism from Nietzsche's posthumously-assembled collection \"The Will to Power\":\n\nRichard Schacht, in his interpretation of Nietzsche's thought, argues that this can be expanded into a revised form of \"objectivity\" in relation to \"subjectivity\" as an aggregate of singular viewpoints that illuminate, for example, a particular idea in seemingly self-contradictory ways but upon closer inspection would reveal a difference of contextuality and of rule by which such an idea (e.g., that is fundamentally perspectival) can be validated. Therefore, it can be said each perspective is subsumed into and, taking account of its individuated context, adds to the overall objective measure of a proposition under examination. Nevertheless, perspectivism does not implicate any method of inquiry nor a structural theory of knowledge in general.\n\nIn contemporary philosophy, perspectivism was revived by Jos√© Ortega y Gasset.\n\n"}

Gerd B. Achenbach and Ad Hoogendijk are two, German and Dutch philosophers who established themselves as consultant philosophers in the 1980s (Achenbach 1984, 2002; Hoogendijk 1988) and led the way to a number of other developments all over the world. They proposed an alternative to psychotherapeutic culture by working exclusively within the field of existential investigation with clients or patients, whom they called 'visitors.'\n\nAchenbach argues that it is life that calls to thinking, rather than thinking that informs life. The act of philosophising can, therefore, give direction in its own right, as living precedes thinking and practice precedes theory.\n\nThe movement is sometimes referred to as philosophical counselling and it is also connected with and related to Existential Therapy, which has thrived in the United Kingdom since the establishment of the Society for Existential Analysis (SEA) in London in 1988. This was based on the work of Emmy van Deurzen, also a philosopher who has applied philosophical thinking to the practice of psychotherapy. Philosophical consultancy is often applied to business consultancy as well as to individuals, as it frequently involves a rethinking of values and beliefs and is also a method for rational conflict resolution.\n\nPhilosophical practice has continued to expand and is attractive as an alternative to counselling and psychotherapy for those who prefer to avoid a medicalization of life-problems. Numerous philosophical consultants have emerged and there is a strong international interest and a bi-annual international conference. There are a number of important publications in the field (Lahav and Tillmans 1995, Curnow 2001, Herrestad et al. 2002, Marinoff 1999, Rochelle 2008, 2011).\n\n"}

After a primary education often interrupted by health problems, Pierre Kaan entered in 1919 into kh√¢gne, the preparatory classes for the entrance exams of √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure at the Lyc√©e Louis-le-Grand. While at the Lyc√©e Louis-le-Grand Kaan founded a literary review called \"la Gerbe du Quartier Latin\", alongside fellow students Daniel Gu√©rin, Georges Altman, and Paul Verdier. Pierre Kaan's attendance in the preparatory classes were interrupted when his parents sent him to Brittany to recover from recurring asthma attacks. Nevertheless, Pierre Kaan was awarded a diploma in philosophy by \"l'Academie de Paris\" in 1923, with a dissertation titled 'The sociological basis of Nietzsche's thought during his intellectualist period 1876‚Äì1882'.\n\nFollowing a growing notoriety in French academic and Marxist circles in the early 1920s, Pierre Kaan was spotted by Boris Souvarine who placed him on the editing board of \"l'Humanit√©\" and shortly thereafter requested Kaan contribute as a writer and editor for the Bulletin Communiste.\n\nDuring the 1920s Pierre Kaan contributed to a number of Jewish literary reviews. In 1925 Kaan began an editorial collaboration with Albert Cohen at the \"Revue Juive\", a literary magazine founded by Cohen to review Jewish literature. And between 1927‚Äì1928, Pierre Kaan joined another literary review called \"Palestine\", a Zionist literary review presided by Justin Godart, as its secretary.\n\nHaving passed the agr√©gation in philosophy in 1928, Pierre Kaan was named associate professor of literature and philosophy at a secondary school in Montargis. However, Kaan resigned from his position in September 1929 in order to fulfill his military obligations, which he completes in November and is thereby named professor in another secondary school, this time in Nogent-le-Rotrou.\n\nAt odds over the party's close relationship with the Soviet Union, Pierre Kaan quit the French Communist Party (PCF) in 1929 and joined Souvarine's new group, the \"Cercle Communiste D√©mocratique\", whose members included Simone Weil, Georges Bataille, and Raymond Queneau.\n\nIn 1931 Pierre Kaan began his involvement with Boris Souvarine's \"La Critique Sociale\" joining Bataille, Weil, Queneau, Lucien Laurat and other writers, philosophers and economists to revue letters and ideas for what would become a widely read publication during the 1930s.\n\nShortly after the speech made by Marshal Philippe P√©tain on 17 June, Pierre Kaan unsuccessfully attempted to join the resistance group France Libre. Kaan thereby tasked himself of uniting and regrouping all those who shared the will to continue fighting against the Nazis. Alongside former comrades and old friends (Jean Cavaill√®s and Leo Hamon in Toulouse), Kaan participated in the founding of the group Lib√©ration-Sud. In February 1942, Pierre Kaan enlisted in the Forces Fran√ßaises Combattantes, handing his engagement personally to Jean Moulin and Leo Morandat when they arrived to visit him at his home in Montlu√ßon. Kaan undertook a number of resistance operations with Lib√©ration-Sud around the Montlu√ßon area alongside members of the entourage of Montlu√ßon's Mayor, Marx Dormoy. Pierre Kaan's resistance activities in Montlu√ßon ranged from painting anti-Nazi inscriptions on walls, coordinating the distribution of political tracts, compiling reports destined for headquarters of the Free French Forces in London, and during 1942, Kaan reconnoitered the surrounding territory to find appropriate landing zones for parachute operations and clandestine landings. On 6 January 1942, Kaan plays an important part in \norganising a large demonstration against the departure of workers following a speech made by Pierre Laval - the Nazi collaborating Prime Minister of the Vichy R√©gime. Following the success of his operations in Montlu√ßon, Pierre Kaan is named Jean Moulin's deputy responsible for safeguarding transport and communication links between Lyon and the occupied half of France.\n\nDenounced by a close collaborator in the winter of 1943, Pierre Kaan was arrested by the Gestapo on 29 December on the steps of Port-Royal m√©tro station in Paris, tortured and then deported to Buchenwald concentration camp. From Buchenwald, Pierre Kaan was deported to Gleina, liberated by Czech anti-fascist fighters, and died a few days later, exhausted and stricken by Typhus and Tuberculosis in Cesk√© Budejovice hospital on 18 May 1945.\n\nBoris Souvarine on Pierre Kaan:\n\nIn recognition of the operations Pierre Kaan led and undertook during the war, Kaan received three French and one British decoration. On 12 May 1948, the official journal of the French Government announced that Kaan had been posthumously decorated with Knight of the Legion of Honour, Medal of the Resistance with Rosette, War Cross with silver palm. In the same year, the British Government also decorated Kaan posthumously with the King's Military Commendation for Brave Conduct.\n\n\n\n"}

He was an Israeli diplomat from 1951 to 1969, among other position acting as Israeli Consul to Milan, and was instrumental in gaining recognition for the young state of Israel. He wrote more than 35 books during his lifetime. Pinchas Lapide was married to Ruth Lapide with whom he shared his interests and endeavors.\n\nIn 1967 Pinchas Lapide published his book \"Three Popes and the Jews\" which set out to answer the charges raised in Rolf Hochhuth's play The Deputy which contained criticisms of World War II Pope Pius XII and his response to the unfolding Holocaust.\n\nLapide credits Pope Pius XII for heading the effort to save hundreds of thousands of Jewish lives:\n\nAfter analyzing the available information he concludes:\n\nLapide quoted approvingly Samuel Taylor Coleridge observation that \"\"He who begins by loving Christianity better than truth will proceed by loving his own sect or church better than Christianity, and end by loving himself better than all\".\"\n\nIn his dialogue with German reformed theologian J√ºrgen Moltmann, Lapide says:\n\"On page 139 of his book \"The Church in the Power of the Spirit\" (New York: Harper & Row, Publishers, 1977) it says: Through his crucifixion Christ has become the Saviour of the Gentiles. But in his parousia he will also manifest himself as Israel's Messiah.\n\nI find this sentence an acceptable formula of reconciliation.\"\nMoltmann's compelling response:\n\"Christendom can gain salvation only together with Israel. The Christians will one day be asked, Where are your Jewish brothers and sisters? The church will one day be asked, Where have you left Israel? For the sake of the Jew Jesus there is no ultimate separation between church and Israel. For the sake of the gospel there is provisionally, before the eschatological future, also no fusion. But there is the communal way of the hoping ones.\"\nIn their common declaration, Lapide and Moltmann acknowledge that the diverging paths of Christianity and Judaism may only be as consequential as the man-made barriers that hinder rapprochement. Both agree that Christianity and Judaism are pilgrim's paths to the same God.\n\nIn another debate on the messianic connotations of Isaiah 53 with Walter C. Kaiser Jr., Lapide posits that the people of Israel collectively are the expiatory lamb of mankind; God visits the sin of Israel with the full impact in order to let guilty mankind survive, a position that Kaiser thought could be interpreted as being close to the traditional evangelical Christian interpretation of Isaiah 53. The interpretation of Israel as a guilt offering is less clear in the mind of Kaiser, when comparing Isaiah 29:13 with Isaiah 53:9:\n\nHe was assigned a grave with the wicked,<br>\nthough he had done no violence,<br>\n\n‚ÄúThese people come near to me with their mouth<br>\n\nIn responding, Lapide sees the selfless sacrifice of the Jewish prophets as synonymous with Israel becoming acceptable through the imputed righteousness of God. Likewise, he understands Jesus' suffering in the context of Isaiah 53 as a microcosm of the suffering of Israel as a people.\n\nTo conclude, Lapide accepts Jesus as the Messiah of the Gentiles, a position he substantiates more clearly in his book \"\". Furthermore, he suggests that the return of Jesus in the parousia will show him to be Israel's Messiah. Just as his interfaith agenda prescribed his presentation of Jesus, the same can be said of his unfamiliar and relatively non-threatening portrayal of Paul.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "192626", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=192626", "title": "Potlatch", "text": "Potlatch\n\nA potlatch is a gift-giving feast practiced by indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast of Canada and the United States, among whom it is traditionally the primary economic system. This includes the Heiltsuk, Haida, Nuxalk, Tlingit, Makah, Tsimshian, Nuu-chah-nulth, Kwakwaka'wakw, and Coast Salish cultures. Potlatches are also a common feature of the peoples of the Interior and of the Subarctic adjoining the Northwest Coast, though mostly without the elaborate ritual and gift-giving economy of the coastal peoples (see Athabaskan potlatch).\n\nPotlatches went through a history of rigorous ban by the Canadian federal government, continuing underground despite the risk of criminal punishment, and have been studied by many anthropologists. Since the practice was de-criminalized in the post-war years, the potlatch has re-emerged in some communities.\n\nThe word comes from the Chinook Jargon, meaning \"to give away\" or \"a gift\"; originally from the Nuu-chah-nulth word \"pa…¨aÀëƒç\", to make a ceremonial gift in a potlatch.\n\nA potlatch was held on the occasion of births, deaths, adoptions, weddings, and other major events. Typically the potlatch was practiced more in the winter seasons as historically the warmer months were for procuring wealth for the family, clan, or village, then coming home and sharing that with neighbors and friends. The event was hosted by a \"numaym\", or 'House', in Kwakwaka'wakw culture. A \"numaym\" was a complex cognatic kin group usually headed by aristocrats, but including commoners and occasional slaves. It had about one hundred members and several would be grouped together into a tribe. The House drew its identity from its ancestral founder, usually a mythical animal who descended to earth and removed his animal mask, thus becoming human. The mask became a family heirloom passed from father to son along with the name of the ancestor himself. This made him the leader of the \"numaym\", considered the living incarnation of the founder.\n\nOnly rich people could host a potlatch. Tribal slaves were not allowed to attend a potlatch as a host or a guest. In some instances, it was possible to have multiple hosts at one potlatch ceremony (although when this occurred the hosts generally tended to be from the same family). If a member of a tribe had suffered an injury or indignity, hosting a potlatch could help to heal their tarnished reputation (or ‚Äúcover his shame‚Äù, as anthropologist H. G. Barnett worded it.) The potlatch was the occasion on which titles associated with masks and other objects were \"fastened on\" to a new office holder. Two kinds of titles were transferred on these occasions. Firstly, each \"numaym\" had a number of named positions of ranked \"seats\" (which gave them a seat at potlatches) transferred within itself. These ranked titles granted rights to hunting, fishing and berrying territories. Secondly, there were a number of titles that would be passed between numayma, usually to in-laws, which included feast names that gave one a role in the Winter Ceremonial. Aristocrats felt safe giving these titles to their out-marrying daughter's children because this daughter and her children would later be rejoined with her natal numaym and the titles returned with them. Any one individual might have several \"seats\" which allowed them to sit, in rank order, according to their title, as the host displayed and distributed wealth and made speeches. Besides the transfer of titles at a potlatch, the event was given \"weight\" by the distribution of other less important objects such as Chilkat blankets, animal skins (later Hudson Bay blankets) and ornamental \"coppers\". It is the distribution of large numbers of Hudson Bay blankets, and the destruction of valued coppers that first drew government attention (and censure) to the potlatch. On occasion, preserved food was also given as a gift during a potlatch ceremony. Gifts known as \"sta-bigs\" consisted of preserved food that was wrapped in a mat or contained in a storage basket.\n\nDorothy Johansen describes the dynamic: \"In the \"potlatch\", the host in effect challenged a guest chieftain to exceed him in his 'power' to give away or to destroy goods. If the guest did not return 100 percent on the gifts received and destroy even more wealth in a bigger and better bonfire, he and his people lost face and so his 'power' was diminished.\" Hierarchical relations within and between clans, villages, and nations, were observed and reinforced through the distribution or sometimes destruction of wealth, dance performances, and other ceremonies. The status of any given family is raised not by who has the most resources, but by who distributes the most resources. The hosts demonstrate their wealth and prominence through giving away goods.\n\nPotlatch ceremonies were also used as coming-of-age rituals. When children were born, they would be given their first name at the time of their birth (which was usually associated with the location of their birthplace.) About a year later, the child's family would hold a potlatch and give gifts to the guests in attendance on behalf of the child. During this potlatch, the family would give the child their second name. Once the child reached about 12 years of age, they were expected to hold a potlatch of their own by giving out small gifts that they had collected to their family and tribe, at which point they would be able to receive their third name.\n\nFor some cultures, such as Kwakwaka'wakw, elaborate and theatrical dances are performed reflecting the hosts' genealogy and cultural wealth. Many of these dances are also sacred ceremonies of secret societies like the hamatsa, or display of family origin from supernatural creatures such as the dzunukwa. \n\nChief O'waxÃ±aÃ±lagaÃ±lis of the Kwagu'≈Ç describes the potlatch in his famous speech to anthropologist Franz Boas,\nIt is important to note the differences and uniqueness among the different cultural groups and nations along the coast. Each nation, tribe, and sometimes clan has its own way of practicing the potlatch with diverse presentation and meaning. The Tlingit and Kwakiutl tribes of the Pacific Northwest, for example, held potlatch ceremonies for different occasions. The Tlingit potlatches occurred for succession (the granting of tribal titles or land) and funerals. The Kwakiutl potlatches, on the other hand, occurred for marriages and incorporating new people into the tribe (i.e. the birth of a new member of the tribe.) The potlatch, as an overarching term, is quite general, since some cultures have many words in their language for various specific types of gatherings. It is important to keep this variation in mind as most of our detailed knowledge of the potlatch was acquired from the Kwakwaka'wakw around Fort Rupert on Vancouver Island in the period 1849 to 1925, a period of great social transition in which many features became exaggerated in reaction to British colonialism.\n\nBefore the arrival of the Europeans, gifts included storable food (oolichan, or candlefish, oil or dried food), canoes, slaves, and ornamental \"coppers\" among aristocrats, but not resource-generating assets such as hunting, fishing and berrying territories. Coppers were sheets of beaten copper, shield-like in appearance; they were about two feet long, wider on top, cruciform frame and schematic face on the top half. None of the copper used was ever of indigenous metal. A copper was considered the equivalent of a slave. They were only ever owned by individual aristocrats, and never by numaym, hence could circulate between groups. Coppers began to be produced in large numbers after the colonization of Vancouver Island in 1849 when war and slavery were ended.\nThe arrival of Europeans resulted in the introduction of numerous diseases against which indigenous peoples had no immunity, resulting in a massive population decline. Competition for the fixed number of potlatch titles grew as commoners began to seek titles from which they had previously been excluded by making their own remote or dubious claims validated by a potlatch. Aristocrats increased the size of their gifts in order to retain their titles and maintain social hierarchy. This resulted in massive inflation in gifting made possible by the introduction of mass-produced trade goods in the late 18th and earlier 19th centuries.\n\nPotlatching was made illegal in Canada in 1884 in an amendment to the Indian Act, largely at the urging of missionaries and government agents who considered it \"a worse than useless custom\" that was seen as wasteful, unproductive, and contrary to 'civilized values' of accumulation.\n\nThe potlatch was seen as a key target in assimilation policies and agendas. Missionary William Duncan wrote in 1875 that the potlatch was \"by far the most formidable of all obstacles in the way of Indians becoming Christians, or even civilized\". Thus in 1884, the Indian Act was revised to include clauses banning the Potlatch and making it illegal to practice. Section¬†3 of the Act read,\nIn 1888, the anthropologist Franz Boas described the potlatch ban as a failure:\nEventually the potlatch law, as it became known, was amended to be more inclusive and address technicalities that had led to dismissals of prosecutions by the court. Legislation included guests who participated in the ceremony. The indigenous people were too large to police and the law too difficult to enforce. Duncan Campbell Scott convinced Parliament to change the offence from criminal to summary, which meant \"the agents, as justice of the peace, could try a case, convict, and sentence\". Even so, except in a few small areas, the law was generally perceived as harsh and untenable. Even the Indian agents employed to enforce the legislation considered it unnecessary to prosecute, convinced instead that the potlatch would diminish as younger, educated, and more \"advanced\" Indians took over from the older Indians, who clung tenaciously to the custom.\n\nThe potlatch ban was repealed in 1951. Sustaining the customs and culture of their ancestors, indigenous people now openly hold potlatches to commit to the restoring of their ancestors' ways. Potlatches now occur frequently and increasingly more over the years as families reclaim their birthright. Anthropologist Sergei Kan was invited by the Tlingit tribe to attend several potlatch ceremonies between 1980 and 1987 and observed several similarities and differences between traditional and contemporary potlatch ceremonies. Kan notes that there was a language gap during the ceremonies between the older members of the tribe and the younger members of the tribe (age fifty and younger) due to the fact that most of the younger members of the tribe do not speak the Tlingit language. Kan also notes that unlike traditional potlatches, contemporary Tlingit potlatches are no longer obligatory, resulting in only about 30% of the adult tribal members opting to participate in the ceremonies that Kan attended between 1980 and 1987. Despite these differences, Kan stated that he believed that many of the essential elements and spirit of the traditional potlatch were still present in the contemporary Tlingit ceremonies.\n\nIn his book \"The Gift\", the French ethnologist, Marcel Mauss used the term potlatch to refer to a whole set of exchange practices in tribal societies characterized by \"total prestations\", i.e., a system of gift giving with political, religious, kinship and economic implications. These societies' economies are marked by the competitive exchange of gifts, in which gift-givers seek to out-give their competitors so as to capture important political, kinship and religious roles. Other examples of this \"potlatch type\" of gift economy include the Kula ring found in the Trobriand Islands.\n\n\n"}

It is also the first stage of the six-branch yoga (\"·π£a·∏ça·πÖgayoga\") of the Buddhist KƒÅlacakra tantra, where it refers to the withdrawal of the five senses from external objects to be replaced by the mentally created senses of an enlightened deity. This phase is roughly analogous to the physical isolation (\"kƒÅyaviveka\", Tib. \"lus bden\") phase of GuhyasamƒÅja tantra.\n\nFor Patanjali, it is a bridge between the \"bahiranga\" (external) aspects of yoga namely, yama, niyama, asana, pranayama, and the \"antaranga\" (internal) yoga. Having actualized the \"pratyahara\" stage, a practitioner is able to effectively engage into the practice of Samyama. At the stage of \"pratyahara\", the consciousness of the individual is internalized in order that the sensations from the senses of taste, touch, sight, hearing and smell don't reach their respective centers in the brain and takes the \"sadhaka\" (practitioner) to next stages of Yoga, namely Dharana (concentration) and Dhyana (meditation), and Samadhi (mystical absorption), being the aim of all Yogic practices.\n\nPratyahara is derived from two Sanskrit words: \"prati\" and \"ahara\", with ahara meaning food, or anything taken into ourselves, and prati, a preposition meaning away or against. Together they mean \"weaning away from ahara\", or simply ingestion.\n\nPrati in Sanskrit can also mean \"copy\". So in effect Pratyahara means that your 5 external senses can be copied and replaced by 5 internal representations/copies of those same senses. \n\nThis involves withdrawal of senses, or sensory inputs into our physical being, coming from our five senses, namely organs creating a sensory overload, and hence hinders collection of the mind, as in Dharana, the next stage of Yoga \n\nControl of our senses requires mastery over the flow of prana, as that is what drives the senses. To stop the scattering of valuable vital energy of the body or prana, we need to seek control over its flow, and harmonize it. This is done through various practices including bringing the entire focus to a single point in the body.\n\nThese two lead to the subsequent two types of pratyahara, the Control of Action or 'Karma pratyahara', which entails not just control of motor organs, but also right action or work, and Karma Yoga, surrender of every action to the divine and performing it as an act of service. This leads to the final form of pratyahara - the Withdrawal of Mind or 'Mano pratyahara', which is practiced by consciously withdrawing attention from anything that is unwholesome, and distracting for the mind such as by withdrawing attention from the senses, and directing it inwards \n\nOne of the most common practices for Pratyahara is Pranayama, wherein we automatically withdraw from the external and bring our focus inwards towards our breath, as connection with the external senses and stimuli are all severed gradually.\n\nApart from Pranayama, another method that is used to aid in the development of Pratyahara is to concentrate on the point between the eyebrows. This location is known as Ajna Chakra or the third eye.\n\nAnother common technique for inducing Pratyahara is to first reduce physical stimuli, then concentrate on one sense, such as hearing. The mind has a natural tendency to roam between the sensory inputs. In this situation, as there are no longer any other significant sensory inputs, when the mind gets tired of hearing, it is forced to turn inward.\n\nAt the advanced levels, the currents which pulsate through the nerves and even the involuntary muscles are turned off by the practitioner. This may also be accomplished through Pranayama or breath-control.\n\n\n\n"}

He studied sociology and history of literature at the University of Ljubljana, graduating in 1968 under the supervision of Du≈°an Pirjevec. During his student years, he was active in several avant-garde literary movements. In 1964, he became the last co-editor (together with the poet Toma≈æ ≈†alamun) of the alternative journal \"Perspektive\", before it was closed down by the Communist regime. Between 1968 and 1970 he worked as a journalist at the journal \"Delo\". He later studied at the √âcole des hautes √©tudes en sciences sociales in Paris, where he obtained a PhD in philosophy under the supervision of Algirdas Julien Greimas.\n\nAfter returning to Ljubljana, he became the editor of the alternative journal \"Problemi\". During this period, he started a close collaboration with Marxist philosophers Slavoj ≈Ωi≈æek and Mladen Dolar. Since 1984, Moƒçnik is professor of sociology at the Faculty of Arts of the University of Ljubljana. \n\nMoƒçnik was among the first Slovene theorists who introduced structuralism and the theories of Marxist philosopher Louis Althusser in Slovenian academia. He has written on several subjects including theory of ideology, theoretical psychoanalysis, semiotics, linguistics and epistemology of humanities and social sciences. He has also translated works of Jacques Lacan, √âmile Durkheim and Marcel Mauss into Slovene.\n\nMoƒçnik has also been active in several civil and political movements in Slovenia. In the early 1980s, he was one of the most outspoken opponents of a high school education reform, carried out by the Communist Party, in which the classical grammar schools (the so-called gymnasium) were abolished as a supposed remainder of old bourgeois elitism. In 1982, he also wrote a petition against such reform, together with editor Braco Rotar, social theorist Neda Pagon and jurist Matev≈æ Krivic. The petition was signed by over 600 intellectuals, and was one of the first wide and openly critical civil society initiatives in Socialist Slovenia. Between 1988 and 1990, he served on the board of the Committee for the Defence of Human Rights, the main civil society organization in Slovenia during the process of democratization. In the early 1990s, he opposed the dissolution of Yugoslavia, was critical of the DEMOS coalition and Slovenian independence. \n\nIn 1990, Moƒçnik was elected president of a small extra-parliamentary party, called Social Democratic Union (\"Socialdemokratska unija\", SDU), which was linked to Ante Markoviƒá's Union of Reform Forces. The party failed to win any significant popular support, and remained outside of the Slovenian Parliament. After its dissolution in the early 1990s, Moƒçnik left party politics, but continued to participate in the public debate. He was one of the few Slovenian public intellectuals who opposed the unilateral declaration of Slovenian independence. In the late 1990s, he opposed the Slovenian entry in NATO. He has also been highly critical of the Bologna process.\n\nMoƒçnik also writes weekly columns in the Slovene leftist journal \"Mladina\" and is a member of the Advisory Board of the regional left-wing magazine \"Novi Plamen\".\n\nMoƒçnik's amibiguous positions in the years 1989-1991, when he was critical of Slovenia's independence from Yugoslavia, was criticized by many at the time, and has remained one of the frequent political reproaches against him, including from the conservative Prime Minister Janez Jan≈°a.\n\nIn 2008, his article \"Slovene historians on the Destruction of Yugoslav Federation\" published in a special issue of the review \"Borec\" under the name \"Oddogodenje zgodovine ‚Äì primer Jugoslavije\"' (\"The Uneventment of History - The Case of Yugoslavia\") together with contributions by the \"new generation\" of Slovenian historians and young foreign researchers such as Ozren Pupovac, Alberto Toscano and Geoffroy Geraud-Legros, became highly polemical as he criticized some trends on historical revisionism in contemporary Slovenian historiography.

{"id": "1179960", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1179960", "title": "Scotism", "text": "Scotism\n\nScotism is the name given to the philosophical and theological system or school named after Blessed John Duns Scotus. The word comes from the name of its originator, whose Opus Oxoniense was one of the most important documents in medieval philosophy and Roman Catholic theology, defining what would later be declared the Dogma of the Immaculate conception by Pope Pius IX in his constitution \"Ineffabilis Deus\" on 8 December 1854.\n\nScotism developed out of the Old Franciscan School, which dominated theology during the Middle Ages. This school of thought initially followed Augustinism which dominated theology at the time.\n\nScotus found the ground already cleared for the conflict with the followers of Aquinas. He made very free use of Aristotelianism, but in its employment exercised sharp criticism, and in important points adhered to the teaching of the Older Franciscan School ‚Äì especially with regard to the plurality of forms or of souls, the spiritual matter of the angels and of souls, etc., wherein he energetically combatted Aquinas. Scotism, or what is known as the Later Franciscan School, is thus only a continuation or further development of the older school, with a much wider, although not exclusive acceptance of Peripatetic ideas. The difference between Thomism and Scotism could be expressed by saying that, while both derive from Arabic Neoplatonized Aristotelianism, Thomism is closer to the orthodox Aristotelianism of Maimonides, Averroes and Avicenna, while Scotism reflects the Platonizing tendency going back through Avicebron, the Brethren of Purity, the Liber de Causis and Proclus to Plotinus.\n\nConcerning the relation of these schools to each other, or the relation of Scotus to Alexander of Hales and St. Bonaventure, consult the work of the Flemish Recollect, Mathias Hauzeur. It is notable that, while Thomism became the official philosophy of the Church, Scotist influence prevailed on a number of important points, not least the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception.\n\nNominalism is older than Scotus, but its revival in Occamism may be traced to the one-sided exaggeration of some propositions of Scotus. Scotist Formalism is the direct opposite of Nominalism, and the Scotists were at one with the Thomists in combatting the latter; Occam himself was a bitter opponent of Scotus. The Council of Trent defined as dogma a series of doctrines especially emphasized by the Scotists (e.g. freedom of the will, free co-operation with grace, etc..). In other points the canons were intentionally so framed that they do not affect Scotism (e.g. that the first man was constitutus in holiness and justice). This was also done at the Vatican Council. In the Thomistic‚ÄìMolinistic controversy concerning the foreknowledge of God, predestination, the relation of grace to free will, the Scotists took little part. They either supported one of the parties, or took up a middle position, rejecting both the predetermination of the Thomists and the scientia media of the Molinists. God recognizes the free future acts in His essence, and provides a free decree of His will, which does not predetermine our free will, but only accompanies it.\n\nJesuit philosophers and theologians adopted a series of the Scotist propositions. Later authorities reject in part many of these propositions and another series of propositions was misunderstood even by Catholic theologians, and then in this false sense rightly rejected ‚Äì e.g. the doctrine of the \"univocatio entis\", of the acceptation of the merits of Christ and man, etc.\n\nNumerous other propositions have been accepted or at least favourably treated by a large number of Catholic scholars and amongst these are many propositions from psychology: e.g. that the powers of the soul are not merely accidents even natural and necessary of the soul, that they are not really distinct from the substance of the soul or from one another etc.\n\nThey also took from Scotism many propositions concerning the doctrine of the angels.\n\nScotism exercised an influence on the development of philosophy and theology; its importance is not, as is often asserted, purely negative ‚Äì i.e. it does not consist only in the fact that it exercised a criticism on Thomas Aquinas and the Thomistic school.\n\nA comparison of the Scotist teaching with that of Aquinas has been often attempted ‚Äì for example, in the abovementioned work of Hauzeur at the end of the first volume; by Sarnano (Costanzo Torri, \"Conciliatio omnium controversiarum etc.\" (1589‚Äì ). In many cases, the differences are mostly in the terminology and a reconciliation is possible if one emphasize certain parts of Scotus or Aquinas and passes over or tones down others. However, some contradictions remain on a number of points.\n\nGenerally speaking, Scotism found its supporters within the Franciscan Order; certainly, opposition to the Dominicans, i.e. to Aquinas, made many members of the order disciples of Scotus. However, this does not mean that the foundation and development of Scotism is to be regarded as a product of the rivalry between the two orders. Even Aquinas at first found a few opponents in his order ‚Äì not all his fellow-Dominicans followed him in every particular (e.g. Durandus of St. Pour√ßain).\n\nThe Scotist doctrines were also supported by many Minorites. Furthermore, Scotism found not a few supporters among secular professors and in other religious orders (e.g. the Augustinians, Servites, etc.), especially in England, Ireland, and Spain. Of the Minorites who supported Scotist doctrine, the Conventuals seem to have adhered most faithfully to Scotus, particularly at the University of Padua, where many highly esteemed teachers lectured.\n\nIt is only at the end of the 15th or the beginning of the sixteenth century that a special Scotist School can be spoken of. The works of the master were then collected, brought out in many editions and commentated, etc. And from 1501 we also find numerous regulations of general chapters recommending or directly prescribing Scotism as the teaching of the order.\n\nScotism appears to have attained its greatest popularity at the beginning of the seventeenth century; during the sixteenth and the seventeenth centuries we even find special Scotist chairs, e.g. at Paris, Rome, Coimbra, Salamanca, Alcal√°, Padua, and Pavia. In the eighteenth century it had still an important following, but in the 19th it suffered a great decline. One of the reasons for this was the repeated suppressions of the order in almost every country, while the recommendation of the teaching of St. Thomas by several popes could not be favourable to Scotism.\n\nIt has even been asserted that it was merely tolerated by the Catholic Church; but this statement is a priori improbable in regard to a school of which not a single proposition has been censured, and to which so many highly venerated men (bishops, cardinals, popes, and saints) have belonged; and it is still less probable in view of the approval of the various general statutes (repeated so often down to the present day), in which Scotism is at least recommended. In their Decrees Leo XIII and Pius X have recommended not alone St. Thomas, but also Scholasticism in general, and this includes also the Scotist School.\n\nMost Scotists are both philosophers and theologians. Notable Scotists of the fourteenth century included Antonius Andrea and Francis of Mayrone(c. 1280-1328) author of a \"Tractatus de transcendentibus\".Francis Mayron, who introduced the \"actus sorbonicus\" into the University of Paris.\n\nScotists of the fifteenth century included two popes, Alexander V and Sixtus IV, Elector Frederick III of Saxony and Angelus of Chivasso. The latter's work on Scotist theology was so notorious that it was publicly burned by Martin Luther.\n\nNotable Scotists of the sixteenth century included Paul Scriptoris, noted professor at the University of T√ºbingen, and the Archbishop of Athens Antonio Trombetta.\n\nOf very many names we may mention:\n\n\nIn the nineteenth century, although Scotism was retained in the schools of the Franciscan Order in accordance with the statutes, there were few works in the Scotist tradition, in any case no celebrated ones.\n\nThough the use of the term Scotism has become a bit antiquated, several contemporary theologians, especially from among the Franciscan Orders, like Kenan Osborne OFM and Daniel Horan OFM, can be seen as in the Scotist tradition. Several recent projects such as the Scotus Project of CUA, the International Scotistic Commission in Rome and the Commission of the Franciscan Intellectual Tradition of the English Speaking Conference of the OFM have sought to increase awareness of Duns Scotus and Scotism on contemporary theology. Scotism has also found a home amongst Anglo-Catholics, including Richard Cross and Thomas Williams, as well as influencing Protestants like William Lane Craig.\n\n"}

Thierry was a major figure in twelfth-century philosophy and learning, and, like many twelfth-century scholars, is notable for his embrace of Plato's \"Timaeus\" and his application of philosophy to theological issues. Some modern scholars believed Thierry to have been a brother of Bernard of Chartres who had founded the school of Chartres, but later research has shown that this is unlikely.\n\nThierry became chancellor of Chartres after his predecessor, Gilbert of Poitiers, returned to his native city in 1141. John of Salisbury, Herman of Carinthia, and Clarembald of Arras were among Thierry's students.\n\nThe \"Hexaemeron\" interprets the Genesis with reference to Plato's \"Timaeus\". The text serves as a reasoned defense of God's existence, by relying on Platonic natural philosophy and Aristotelian logic to explain the creation of the world. Thierry establishes that the moment of divine creation was the very beginning of time, and following that, creation evolved naturally through combinations of the four elements (fire, air, water, and earth). According to Thierry, God created the four elements in the first moment. Fire, which is constantly moving, rotated and lit up the air, causing the first night and day. On the second day, fire warmed the water, causing it to rise into the heavens and form clouds. Because of the reduction of water, land emerged on the third day. The continued heating of the waters above the firmament caused the water to create the heavenly bodies on the fourth day. The continued warming of land caused the plant, animal, and human life to arise on the fifth and sixth days.\n\nThierry's explanation of the creation of the world is based on a theological interpretation of Aristotle's four causes, which he identifies with the three persons of the Trinity plus matter (made up of the four elements): the Father is the efficient cause, the Son is the formal cause, the Holy Spirit is the final cause and the four elements are the material cause.\n\nAccording to Thierry, the act of divine creation is limited to the creation of the four elements, which then evolve by themselves, mix according to mathematical proportions and make up the physical world.\n\nThe \"Heptateuch\" is a broad encyclopedia of information relating to the liberal arts, all within the context of academic and theologic unity. It particularly examines the ways in which different types of knowledge can be distinguished, while still supporting a single purpose: explaining order in reality. The trivium (logic, grammar, and rhetoric) address the veracity, consistency, and beauty of the language of expression. The quadrivium (geometry, astronomy, arithmetic, and music) provide the intellectual content in need of expression.\n\nThierry also wrote some commentaries on Boethius' \"De Trinitate\".\n\n\n\n"}

Shackleton wrote, \"during that long and racking march of thirty-six hours over the unnamed mountains and glaciers of South Georgia, it seemed to me often that we were four, not three.\" His admission resulted in other survivors of extreme hardship coming forward and sharing similar experiences.\n\nIn recent years well-known adventurers like climber Reinhold Messner and polar explorers Peter Hillary and Ann Bancroft have reported the experience. One study of cases involving adventurers reported that the largest group involved climbers, with solo sailors and shipwreck survivors being the second most common group, followed by polar explorers.

{"id": "2194663", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2194663", "title": "William Thetford", "text": "William Thetford\n\nWilliam Thetford (April 25, 1923 ‚Äì July 4, 1988) was an American psychologist, medical psychologist and professor. He is best known for his collaboration with Helen Schucman in typing the original manuscript and being on the editing team for \"A Course in Miracles\" (\"ACIM\"), a self-study curriculum in religious psychology. He died in 1988, aged 65, in Tiburon, California, after having made his involvement with the ACIM material and its study the most central focus of his life.\n\nThetford was born on April 25, 1923, in Chicago, Illinois to John and Mabel Thetford as the youngest of three children. At the time of his birth and early childhood, his parents were both regular members of the Christian Science church. At the age of seven, the untimely death of his older sister caused his parents to disavow their affiliation with the Church of Christian Science. Afterwards, for the next few years, Thetford sampled various other Protestant denominations.\n\nAt the age of nine he contracted a severe case of scarlet fever, which led to rheumatic fever and a debilitating heart condition. These resulting health problems forced him to spend the next three years at home recuperating. During his forced recuperation period he took advantage of the many free hours, using the time to satisfy his voracious appetite for reading. Despite his absence from the classroom, he entered high school at the age of twelve.\n\nFollowing graduation from high school, he was awarded a four-year scholarship to DePauw University in Indiana where he graduated with majors in psychology and pre-medicine in 1944. During the course of his university studies, Thetford eventually settled on the idea of specializing in psychology, and in 1949 he received his PhD in this field from the University of Chicago.\n\nAfter graduating from DePauw in January 1944 until the summer of 1945, Thetford had a job as an administrative officer at the University of Chicago working with the scientific team doing atomic research. In his graduate studies he was fortunate to be one of the first students of the renowned psychologist, Carl Rogers.\n\nFor the five years following his graduation in 1949, Thetford worked as a research psychologist in both Chicago, and later in Washington, D.C. He was a research psychologist in the Institute for Psychosomatic & Psychiatric Research & Training at the Reese Hospital in Chicago from 1949-1951 and a senior psychologist for the United States government in Washington, DC from 1951-1954. In 1953 he was a consultant in Beirut, Lebanon at the Foreign Service Institute. He spent 1954 and 1955 as the director of clinical psychology at The Institute of Living in Hartford, Connecticut. From 1955 to 1957 he was an assistant professor of psychology at Cornell University.\n\nIn 1958 he accepted an assistant professorship, which later developed into a full professorship, at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. During a portion of this same period he also served as the Director of Clinical Psychology at the Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital. It was here that he would stay for the next 20 years, and it was here that he first met Helen Schucman, hiring her as a research psychologist and assistant.\n\nA c.v. listing his positions, affiliations, grants, publications and papers is given as Appendix 2 in a biography \"Never Forget to Laugh\" by Carol Howe.\n\nThe working relationship between Thetford and Schucman was apparently often somewhat strained, yet throughout these difficulties they would always maintain a certain level of professional courtesy and respect for one another. The story is often retold that it was into this environment of inter-relational strain between Thetford and Schucman that the \"ACIM\" material was in a sense first ‚Äúinvited‚Äù into this world. This ‚Äúinvitation‚Äù came in the form of an exclamation by Thetford one day, in the midst of one of their periodic difficulties, in which Thetford exclaimed, ‚ÄúThere must be another way!‚Äù This exclamation was followed by a certain speech he made to Schucman describing how he believed that it was time for them to try to refocus their energies on constructive and helpful agendas, rather than being forever hyper critical and hyper competitive with one another. Expecting a typically condescending response from Schucman, the studied silence that followed his speech was then followed by a most surprising concurrence from Schucman, fully supporting his new proposal. This speech was given in June 1965.\n\nThe next four months were filled with a number of unusually vivid dream sequences and even some unusual waking experiences for Schucman. Amongst her vivid dream sequences, she began to become familiar with a certain internal character who spoke to her as Jesus in her dreams. Little did she know that the voice of this dream character would soon come to dominate the rest of her life. Many of her unusual experiences during these four months are recorded in the biographical work, \"Absence from Felicity\", by Kenneth Wapnick. Schucman appears to have confided her experiences with Thetford, who acted as a sort of a calming, encouraging and stabilizing influence for Schucman during this period.\n\nFinally in October of that year, the transcriptions of what is now known as \"A Course In Miracles\" first began. According to both Thetford and Schucman, due to Schucman's intensely divided feelings about the work of the transcription, Schucman would at times require a great deal of reassurance from Thetford in order to complete the process that eventually resulted in the first typewritten copy of \"ACIM\", (which later became known as the Urtext).\n\nAccording to Thetford, Schucman was sitting at home on the night of October 21, 1965, when she heard an internal \"voice\" say to her, \"This is a course in miracles. Please take notes.\"\n\nWhen she first heard this internal voice, she thought she recognized it as the same voice of the dream sequence character that in her recent dream sequences had represented the person of Jesus to her. Schucman then wrote down about a page of notes before she realized that this request was going to be of much greater significance, and would require a far greater commitment in time than it had ever asked of her before. In a panic, she phoned Thetford to ask for his advice. Thetford encouraged Schucman to do what the voice asked, and to take the notes. He offered to meet with her the next morning before work, to review her notes, to discuss them further with her, and then to determine what she should do with this \"Voice\".\n\nOn the following morning, after Thetford's review of the notes, he was so impressed with what she read to him that he encouraged Schucman to continue with the note taking. Schucman was initially taken aback by Thetford's reaction, but then apparently after giving herself enough time to recover from her initial jitters to honestly review the notes herself, she agreed. Soon they recognized that the notes, which eventually became \"A Course in Miracles\" (referred to as \"The Course\" by \"ACIM\" students), was their answer, the \"other way\" that they had agreed to find together four months earlier.\n\nClassifying this transcription process as one of Schucman's unusual waking experiences is an understatement at best. During the process Schucman claimed to have the mental equivalent of a tape recorder in her thoughts, which she described as being able to turn on and off at will, at her convenience, so that she might be able to transcribe into shorthand notes, what she was internally hearing. This voice identified itself as none other than the historical Jesus.\n\nDuring the beginning of this process, one of Thetford's gentle complaints was, ‚ÄúIn the beginning I spent most of my time while typing these notes with one hand on the typewriter and the other on Helen‚Äôs shoulder‚Äù. After some months of experiencing an initial struggle in this process, eventually they both began to experience less subconscious resistance to the process, and the initial transcription began to move along more smoothly.\n\nFrom 1965 through 1972 Thetford directly assisted Schucman with the transcription of the first three sections of the work, which was in fact the great bulk of the material. Then in 1972, somewhat to both of their reliefs (yet on some levels to their dismay) it appeared that the writing was complete, which for the most part it was.\n\nIn 1972 Thetford and Schucman were introduced to Kenneth Wapnick through their mutual friend Father Groeshel. Wapnick was intrigued by the manuscript although he soon realized it needed considerable editing to render it into a publishable format. Wapnick urged Helen to go over the manuscript once again with his assistance, which they did, bringing the final editing to a completion in the Spring of 1975. Thetford, Wapnick and Schucman, the three principle transcriber-editors of ACIM were to remain friends for the rest of their lives, throughout the arduous process of seeing this manuscript through to first successful publication, and beyond to witness the initial spreading of its teachings.\n\nAfter the completion of the bulk of the initial scribing/ transcribing process, for brief periods during 1973, 1975, and 1977 the short transcriptions of Psychotherapy, of Clarification of Terms, and of the Song of Prayer, which are the remainder of the standard material of \"ACIM\", were transcribed in similar fashion.\n\nFrom 1971 to 1978 Thetford, along with David Saunders, headed the CIA mind control Project MKULTRA Subproject 130: Personality Theory.\n\nIn 1978 Thetford resigned from his positions at both Columbia University and at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital. In 1980 he packed up his household, and at the apparent invitation of Judith Skutch Whitson, moved to Tiburon, California, where Whitson was by now employed full-time in the publication and distribution of \"ACIM\".\n\nNow in Tiburon at age 57, Thetford transitioned into a sort of semi-retirement, no longer accepting any demanding positions of heavy responsibility in either his professional life, or in his involvement with the ever growing readership of \"ACIM\". In California Thetford took on two part-time professional positions; one as a psychology consultant at Travis Air Force Base and the other as one of the directors of the \"ACIM\" related Center for Attitudinal Healing in Tiburon, as offered to him by his friend and fellow student of ACIM, Dr. Gerald Jampolsky.\n\nIn California Thetford spent the final eight years of his life regularly attending meetings of fellow \"ACIM\" students where \"ACIM\" principles would be discussed, but only rarely engaging in these discussions in any kind of an authoritative manner. Instead, during this final period of his life, he appears to have been primarily concerned with his own personal study of the \"ACIM\" material, and with enriching his own grasp of its message.\n\nOn July 4, 1988, at age 65 Thetford died of a massive heart attack.\n\n"}
