{"id": "3541024", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3541024", "title": "Aeterni Patris", "text": "Aeterni Patris\n\nAeterni Patris (English: Of the Eternal Father) was an encyclical issued by Pope Leo XIII in August 1879, (not to be confused with the apostolic letter of the same name written by Pope Pius IX in 1868 calling the First Vatican Council). It was subtitled \"On the Restoration of Christian Philosophy in Catholic Schools in the Spirit (ad mentem) of the Angelic Doctor, St. Thomas Aquinas\". The aim of the encyclical was to advance the revival of Scholastic philosophy.\n\nIn August 1879, eighteen months into his pontificate, Pope Leo XIII (formerly Joachim Cardinal Pecci, bishop of Perugia), issued the encyclical letter \"Aeterni Patris\". The aim of the encyclical was to aid and advance the restoration of Christian philosophy, which he felt had fallen into danger and disrepute by adhering to modern trends in secular philosophy, by urging a return to the scholastic thinkers of the Middle Ages, most especially the Angelic Doctor St. Thomas Aquinas, and the related philosophical system of Thomism. The encyclical attempts to clarify the roles of faith and philosophy, later to be covered again in John Paul II's encyclical, \"Fides et Ratio\" (On Faith and Reason), showing how most beneficially each may profit from the other.\n\nThe purpose of Leo XIII was the revival of St. Thomas's philosophy and the continuing of his spirit of investigation, but not necessarily the adoption of every argument and opinion to be found in the works of the scholastics. According to the encyclical, the philosophy most conformable and useful for the faith is that of St. Thomas. The vigorous reintroduction of St. Thomas into the Catholic philosophical teaching was perceived by many as a bold and unprecedented step by the new pope. Indeed, since the French Revolution, most pontiffs had preferred to condemn the errors in contemporary philosophy, not to recommend explicitly a return to the old. The encyclical, however, was no surprise to any acquainted with Cardinal Pecci, who had for years been spearheading a Thomistic renaissance in the schools in his diocese of Perugia, leading to such theologians and philosophers as Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange, Etienne Gilson, and Jacques Maritain.\n\nThe content of the encyclical was strongly influenced by Tommaso Maria Zigliara professor from 1870 to 1879 at the College of Saint Thomas, the future Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, \"Angelicum. \"Zigliara also helped prepare the great encyclicals \"Aeterni Patris\" and \"Rerum novarum\" and strongly opposed traditionalism and ontologism in favor of the moderate realism of Aquinas.\"\n\nZigliara, a member of seven Roman congregations including the Congregation for Studies, was a co-founder of the Academia Romano di San Tommaso in 1870. Zigliara's fame as a scholar at the forefront of the Thomist revival at the time of his rectorship of the College of St. Thomas after 1873 was widespread in Rome and elsewhere. Following the publication of this encyclical Pope Leo XIII created the Pontifical Academy of St. Thomas Aquinas on October 15, 1879, and ordered the publication of the critical edition, the so-called \"leonine edition\", of the complete works of Aquinas, the \"doctor angelicus\". The superintendence of the leonine edition was entrusted to Zigliara.\n\nIntroduction\n1. The opening paragraph begins with a reference to Christ’s command to His Apostles to set all men free by teaching the truth of the faith to all nations (Matthew 28:19). Although philosophy can and has deceived men about important matters, it is also capable of illuminating the other sciences. This, then, is the aim of \"Aeterni Patris\": to promote the kind of philosophy that “shall respond most fitly to the excellence of faith, and at the same time [is] consonant with the dignity of human science.”\n\n2. The errors of philosophy have caused problems in public and private life. Philosophy alone is insufficient to emerge from error or prevent further erroneous conclusions “concerning divine or human things.” The faith of the Christian religion preserves philosophic truth by bringing to men “the grace of the divine wisdom.” Neither reason nor philosophy is destroyed by faith; God, creator of “the light of reason in the human mind,” strengthens man and his reason by faith.\n\n3. Pointing to the Church Fathers, the encyclical shows how reason and science were used to call people to faith.\n\nThe Relationship between Philosophy and Faith: How Philosophy Aids Faith\n\n4. In the fourth paragraph, the encyclical begins to articulate the ways in which philosophy can aid and complement true faith. Reason is characterized as a “steppingstone” to Christian faith, in that philosophy, when used rightly, fortifies the road to faith and prepares the soul for fit reception of revelation. Reason is characterized as rather autonomous, in that the pagans demonstrated and proved conclusions, using only their natural reason, which supported certain truths regarding faith: the existence of God, his power and divinity, as well as the existence of a natural law. A comparison is drawn between the way in which the Hebrews took with them Egyptian treasures to offer to the service of God, and the way in which truths discovered by the philosophy of the pagans are to be turned to the use and purposes of revealed doctrine.\n\n5. The great and noble fruits gathered from natural reason, as described in the fifth paragraph, include its ability to recognize “that the doctrine of the Gospel has even from its very beginning been made manifest by certain wonderful signs.” The spread, sanctity, and unity of the Church is another sign that reason can recognize.\n\n6. The sixth paragraph draws attention to the fact that sacred theology requires philosophy in order to be a genuine science: in order to assume the nature, form, and genius of a true science, theology requires the solid foundation of philosophy. Moreover, Philosophy complements theology in that true understanding and knowledge are better and more easily attained by those who join together philosophic studies with the love of faith and integrity of life.\n\n7. Philosophy is characterized as both a defensive and offensive tool of faith. Defensively it protects the revealed truth from distortion; offensively it weakens arguments contrary to revealed truth. The examples of the Apostle Paul’s use of Greek philosophy in Athens (17:16–34) and David’s use of Goliath’s sword (Samuel 17:50–54) are given as literal and metaphorical examples of using philosophy in a defensive and offensive manner. The Church “commands” Christian teachers to enlist the help of philosophy in instructing the faithful but cautions against philosophical arguments that are contrary to revealed truth.\n\nThe Relationship between Philosophy and Faith: How Faith Aids Philosophy\n\n8. Philosophy and revelation represent two realms of knowledge. Philosophy represents the profane realm of natural truth whereas revelation represents the divine realm of supernatural truth. Revelation or supernatural truth is beyond the reach of reason and therefore philosophy must accept these truths by faith. Philosophy is characterized as a handmaid to faith that humbly accepts revelation. Revelation has the “force of certain truth” so that what is contrary to faith is also contrary to reason. Thus, the philosopher is discouraged from accepting any conclusion that is opposed to revealed doctrine.\n\n9. The human mind is limited and needs the truth of revelation to avoid error. Without the supernatural truth of revelation the human mind is subject to error and opinion. The fact that revelation assists the philosopher in reasoning correctly does not detract from the dignity of the human intellect because wisdom is gained in recognizing the limits of reason. “Faith frees and saves reason from error, and endows it with manifold knowledge.” Revelation serves as a lamp for the philosopher’s path toward truth.\n\nThe Relationship between Philosophy and Faith in Historical Perspective\n\n10. The history of philosophy is marked by those who lacked “the gift of faith”—an error that led to doubtful claims about the nature of reality but especially divinity. However, Christ, “as the power and wisdom of God,” restores knowledge through his followers, and by their efforts redeems what is true in pagan philosophy. In doing so, Catholic doctrine was developed and defended against heretics and other adversaries who sought to propose contrary views.\n\n11. In combating these adversaries, Catholic apologists even from the early centuries (for example, Justin Martyr) encountered both the power of reason to demonstrate certain attributes of God and the limitation of reason in relationship to revelation.\n\n12. The encyclical continues the list of those early Christian thinkers who have labored to defend the faith from error and develop a philosophically informed account of it: Quadratus, Aristides, Hermias, Athenagoras, Irenaeus of Lyons, Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Tertullian, amongst others, are listed.\n\n13. In paragraph 13, Pope Leo XIII continues his list of those who have advanced the Christian intellectual tradition. He turns his attention first to St. Augustine, who Leo says “[w]ould seem to have wrested the palm from all.” The genius of Augustine was his ability to combat “most vigorously all the errors of his age,” as well as his ability to lay down the “safe foundations and sure structure of human science.” The paragraph ends with mention of John Damascene, Basil, and Gregory of Nazianzen as carrying the tradition in the East, and Boethius and Anselm in the West, all of whom Pope Leo says “[a]dded largely to the patrimony of philosophy.”\n\n14. Paragraph 14 speaks of the “doctors of the middle ages,” the “Scholastics,” whose contribution to the tradition was their “diligently collecting, and sifting, and storing up, as it were, in one place, for the use and convenience of posterity the rich and fertile harvests of Christian learning scattered abroad in the voluminous works of the holy Fathers.” Pope Leo XIII quotes Pope Sixtus V, who names in particular the “angelic St. Thomas and the seraphic St. Bonaventure” as preeminent doctors whose “surpassing genius” and “unwearied diligence” aided in further advancing the tradition.\n\n15. The quotation from Sixtus V continues through paragraph 15, and it is here that scholasticism, drawing together and compiling the sacred writings, the work of the “sovereign Pontiffs, the holy Fathers and the councils,” is portrayed as beneficial to the posterity in three ways: for (1) understanding and interpreting Scripture, (2) understanding the Fathers, and (3) combating heresies and errors. The last way is highlighted in the paragraph for the particular importance it plays in “confirming the dogmas of Catholic faith and confuting heresies.” \n16. In paragraph 16, the praise of scholastic theology is extended to the philosophy upon which it is based.\n\n17. The following paragraph names Thomas Aquinas as the preeminent example of scholasticism. He is praised for collecting together all the other arguments of scholastics, and then made valuable additions as well. Apart from his contributions to theology, Thomas, the encyclical claims, also touched finely upon all points of philosophy.\n\n18. In paragraph 18, Thomas is said to have triumphed over previous errors, and supplied those who follow him with the means to defeat other errors that would arise. Thomas also distinguished, “as is fitting,” faith from reason, without infringing upon the legitimate rights of either of them and instead strengthening each through the aid of the other.\n\nThe Authority of St. Thomas Aquinas\n\n19. The nineteenth paragraph begins a discussion of the many ways in which Aquinas’s authority has been recognized through the centuries. The encyclical describes how many religious orders mandated the study of his works to their members: the Dominicans, of course, but also the Benedictines, Carmelites, Augustinians, and Jesuits. This was done because St. Thomas reached such sound and defensible conclusions.\n\n20. The twentieth paragraph of the encyclical refers to all the great universities of the scholastic period where Thomistic theology enjoyed prominence, creating harmony among all the schools adhering to his teaching.\n\n21. The twenty-first paragraph of the encyclical continues the list of testimonials to St. Thomas’s greatness by mentioning some of the popes who have honored, borrowed from, and praised the work of St. Thomas.\n\n22. Thomas Aquinas has long been held “in singular honor” in the ecumenical councils, including those of Lyons, Vienne, Florence, and the Vatican. This high regard was most especially evident during the Council of Trent, in which his \"Summa\" was laid “upon the altar, together with sacred Scripture and the decrees of the supreme Pontiffs.”\n23. Aquinas has been equally esteemed even among critics of the Church, “who openly declared that, if the teaching of Thomas Aquinas were only taken away, they could easily battle with all Catholic teachers.”\n24. The “struggling innovators of the sixteenth century” philosophized without regard for faith. Their inventions were in accordance with their own whims, and so, naturally, there arose a great diversity of philosophies, “differing and clashing” even in those matters of human knowledge that are most important. Pope Leo fears that many philosophers were forsaking the solid philosophical foundation of antiquity and turning toward “a foundation open to change.” And another danger: while Leo affirms the important work of scholarship, he cautions that philosophical pursuits should not be characterized by “mere erudition”; what is required, rather, is an authentic development of learning.\n\nThe Need for a Thomistic and Scholastic Renaissance\n25. Paragraph 25, which acknowledges that, in the face of these dangers, some already have already returned to the superior philosophy of St. Thomas Aquinas, is followed by the hortatory and encouraging remarks in paragraph 26.\n\n26. Both paragraphs use ornamental language in speaking of the “beauty” of the “pure streams” from the “precious fountainhead of the Angelic Doctor.” The language may appeal implicitly to a Thomistic understanding of Beauty as a transcendental quality inseparable from the Good and the Truth.\n\n27. The encyclical goes on in paragraph 27 to urge the teaching of scholastic philosophy and theology, especially to the young seminarians “who are the growing hope of the Church.” Scholastic thought is likened to a strong weapon with which one may best defend the Catholic faith against the assault waged against her by the “machinations and craft of a certain false wisdom.” Scholastic philosophy is presented as second only to the “supernatural help of God,” in its ability to defend the faith.\n\n28. The restoring of the teachings of Thomas Aquinas in the universities and the strong foundation this will offer the students will also help society as a whole by offering it a “more peaceful and secure existence,” as well as protecting it from the “plague of perverse opinions.”\n\n29. Scholastic philosophy, with its “sound judgment,” “right method,” and “spirit,” will strengthen and guide all the different disciplines, including the liberal arts and the physical sciences.\n\n30. In particular, scholastic philosophy does not oppose the “advance and development of natural science.” On the contrary, philosophy is in accord with the conclusions of modern physics. This accord is exemplified by the openness of Aquinas and Albertus Magnus, among other scholastics, to giving “large attention to the knowledge of natural things.”\n\n31. This paragraph emphasizes that the revival of scholasticism and, in particular, Thomism for which the encyclical calls is not a recommendation to practice a slavish adherence to outdated doctrines and ideas: “if there is anything that ill agrees with the discoveries of a later age … it does not enter Our mind to propose that for imitation in Our age.” It is crucial, as well, that Aquinas’s own writings be read and studied, rather than derivative works that may already be affected by errors.\n\nConclusion\n\n32.–34. The document ends with an invocation of God’s grace and the blessing of the saints, for the important work that is recommended in the encyclical.\n\nThe interpretations and effects of the encyclical have been varied, some using it to authorize a return to a strict adherence to St. Thomas, others believing the document urges more a return to the spirit of Thomistic thinking. However various the effects may have been, the document has at least succeeded in reestablishing since its promulgation St. Thomas as a central figure in Catholic philosophy.\n\nThe chief aim of \"Aeterni Patris\" was the reintroduction of Thomism into Catholic educational centers for the purpose of bringing faith and reason back into a fruitful dialectic. Pope Leo XIII had recognized the detrimental effects to both society and religion when reason is privileged over faith. In an effort to promote Thomistic scholarship, Pope Leo XIII commissioned a critical edition of Aquinas’s works, referred to as the “Leonine” edition. Although Thomism had already enjoyed a half-century revival before 1879 through the writings of scholars such as Carlo Maria Curci (d. 1891), Giovanni Maria Cornoldi (d. 1892), and Tommaso Zigliara (d. 1893), \"Aeterni Patris\" heralded a renaissance of Thomism that still reverberates in modern theological and philosophical discourse.\n\nJesuit theologians such as Joseph Maréchal (1878–1944), Karl Rahner (1904–1984), and Bernard J. F. Lonergan (1904–1984) developed a post-Kantian Thomism sometimes called “Transcendental Thomism.” The French theologians Charles Journet (1891–1975), Jacques Maritain (1882–1973), and Étienne Gilson (1884–1978) contributed significantly to Thomistic methodology. Journet along with Maritain founded the journal \"Nova et Vetera\" and contributed to sessions at Vatican II. Gilson founded the Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies in Toronto, Ontario. Gilson’s \"Being and Some Philosophers\" (1949) and Maritain’s \"The Degrees of Knowledge\" (1932) are still widely popular among students of Thomism. Together, Gilson and Maritain are sometimes called \"existential Thomists.\"\n\nFrench Dominicans Pierre Mandonnet (1858–1936), Marie-Dominique Chenu (1895–1990), and Yves Congar (1904–1995) explored the historical background of Thomas Aquinas and its relationship to theology. One of the best known French Dominicans of the twentieth century was Réginald Garrigou-Lagrange (1877–1964), who influenced generations of students during his tenure at the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas (Angelicum) in Rome. These developments and contributions can be seen as a natural consequence of the aim of \"Aeterni Patris\" to bring faith and reason together in a fruitful dialectic. The spirit and thought of Saint Thomas Aquinas advocated by the encyclical has proven a valuable resource for Catholic philosophy and theology in bringing both faith and reason to bear on the problems of modern life.\n\nIn \"Three Rival Versions of Moral Inquiry\" (1990) Alasdair MacIntyre examines three major rival traditions of moral inquiry: encyclopaedic, genealogical and traditional. Each was given defense from a canonical piece published in the late 19th century (the 9th Edition of the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\", Nietzsche's \"Genealogy of Morals\" and Pope Leo XIII's \"Aeterni Patris\"). MacIntyre ultimately conducts a complex series of both interior and exterior critiques of the encyclopaedic and genealogical positions in an attempt to vindicate philosophical Thomism as the most persuasive form of moral inquiry.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "312898", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=312898", "title": "American exceptionalism", "text": "American exceptionalism\n\nAmerican exceptionalism is an ideology holding the United States as unique among nations in positive or negative connotations, with respect to its ideas of democracy and personal freedom.\n\nThough the concept has no formal definition, there are some themes common to various conceptions of the idea. One is the history of the United States is different from other nations. In this view, American exceptionalism stems from the American Revolution, becoming what political scientist Seymour Martin Lipset called \"the first new nation\" and developing the American ideology of \"Americanism\", based on liberty, egalitarianism, individualism, republicanism, democracy, and laissez-faire economics. This ideology itself is often referred to as \"American exceptionalism.\" Another theme is the idea that the U.S. has a unique mission to transform the world. Abraham Lincoln stated in the Gettysburg address (1863), Americans have a duty to ensure \"government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.\" Another theme is the sense the United States' history and mission give it a superiority over other nations.\n\nThe theory of the exceptionalism of the U.S. has developed over time and can be traced to many sources. French political scientist and historian Alexis de Tocqueville was the first writer to describe the country as \"exceptional\" in 1831 and 1840. The actual phrase \"American Exceptionalism\" was originally coined by Soviet leader Joseph Stalin as a critique of a revisionist faction of American Communists who argued that the American political climate was unique, making it an 'exception' to certain elements of Marxist theory. U.S. President Ronald Reagan is often credited with having crystallized this ideology in recent decades. Political scientist Eldon Eisenach argues in the twenty-first century American exceptionalism has come under attack from the postmodern left as a reactionary myth: \"The absence of a shared purposes ratified in the larger sphere of liberal-progressive public policy...beginning with the assumption of American exceptionalism as a reactionary myth.\"\n\nThe exact term \"American exceptionalism\" was occasionally used in the 19th century. In his \"The Yale Book of Quotations\", Fred Shapiro notes \"exceptionalism\" was used to refer to the United States and its self-image by The Times of London on August 20, 1861. Its common use dates from Communist usage in the late 1920s. Soviet leader Joseph Stalin chastised members of the Jay Lovestone-led faction of the American Communist Party for its claim the U.S. was independent of the Marxist laws of history \"thanks to its natural resources, industrial capacity, and absence of rigid class distinctions\". Stalin may have been told of the usage \"American exceptionalism\" by Broder & Zack in \"Daily Worker\" (N.Y.) on January 29, 1929, before Lovestone's visit to Moscow. American Communists started using the English term \"American exceptionalism\" in factional fights. It then moved into general use among intellectuals.\nIn 1989, Scottish political scientist Richard Rose noted most American historians endorse exceptionalism. He suggests these historians reason as follows:\n\nAmerica marches to a different drummer. Its uniqueness is explained by any or all of a variety of reasons: history, size, geography, political institutions, and culture. Explanations of the growth of government in Europe are not expected to fit American experience, and vice versa.\n\nHowever, postnationalist scholars have rejected American exceptionalism, arguing the U.S. did not break from European history, and accordingly, the U.S. has retained class-based and race-based differences, as well as imperialism and willingness to wage war.\n\nIn recent years scholars from numerous disciplines, as well as politicians and commentators in the traditional media, have debated the meaning and usefulness of the concept. Roberts and DiCuirci ask:\n\nSome historians support the concept of American exceptionalism but avoid the terminology, thereby avoid entangling themselves in rhetorical debates. Bernard Bailyn, a leading colonial specialist at Harvard, is a believer in the distinctiveness of American civilization. Although he rarely, if ever, uses the phrase \"American exceptionalism,\" he insists upon the \"distinctive characteristics of British North American life.\" He has argued the process of social and cultural transmission result in peculiarly American patterns of education (in the broadest sense of the word); and he believes in the unique character of the American Revolution.\n\nAlthough the concept of American exceptionalism dates to the founding ideas, the term was first used in the 1920s.\n\nSome claim the phrase \"American exceptionalism\" originated with the American Communist Party in an English translation of a condemnation made in 1929 by Soviet leader Joseph Stalin criticizing Communist supporters of Jay Lovestone for the heretical belief the US was independent of the Marxist laws of history \"thanks to its natural resources, industrial capacity, and absence of rigid class distinctions\". This origin has been challenged, however, because the expression \"American exceptionalism\" was already used by Brouder & Zack in the \"Daily Worker\" (N.Y.) on January 29, 1929, before Lovestone's visit to Moscow. Also, Fred Shapiro, editor of \"The Yale Book of Quotations\", has noted \"exceptionalism\" was used to refer to the United States and its self-image during the Civil War by \"The New York Times\" on August 20, 1861.\n\nEarly examples of the term's usage do include a declaration made at the 1930 American Communist convention proclaiming \"the storm of the economic crisis in the United States blew down the house of cards of American exceptionalism\".\n\nThe phrase fell to obscurity after the 1930s, and in the 1980s American newspapers popularized it to describe America's cultural and political uniqueness. The phrase became an issue of contention between presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain in the 2008 presidential campaign, with Republicans attacking Obama for not believing in the concept.\n\nThe first reference to the concept by name, and possibly its origin, was by French writer Alexis de Tocqueville in his 1835/1840 work, \"Democracy in America\":\nKammen says many foreign visitors commented on American exceptionalism including Karl Marx, Francis Lieber, Hermann Eduard von Holst, James Bryce, H. G. Wells, G. K. Chesterton, and Hilaire Belloc; they did so in complimentary terms. The theme became common, especially in textbooks. From the 1840s to the late 19th century, the McGuffey Readers sold 120 million copies and were studied by most American students. Skrabec (2009) argues the \"Readers\" \"hailed American exceptionalism, manifest destiny, and America as God's country... Furthermore, McGuffey saw America as having a future mission to bring liberty and democracy to the world.\"\n\nIn June 1927 Jay Lovestone, a leader of the Communist Party in America and soon to be named General Secretary, described America's economic and social uniqueness. He noted the increasing strength of American capitalism, and the country's \"tremendous reserve power\"; strength and power which he said prevented Communist revolution. In 1929, the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, disagreeing America was so resistant to revolution, called Lovestone's ideas \"the heresy of American exceptionalism\"—the first time the specific term \"American exceptionalism\" was used. The Great Depression appeared to underscore Stalin's argument American capitalism falls under the general laws of Marxism. In June 1930, during the national convention of the Communist Party USA in New York, it was declared \"The storm of the economic crisis in the United States blew down the house of cards of American exceptionalism and the whole system of opportunistic theories and illusions that had been built upon American capitalist 'prosperity'\".\n\nIn general, Americans have had consideration in national \"uniqueness.\" Historian Dorothy Ross points to three different currents regarding unique characteristics. \n\nRecently, socialists and other writers tried to discover or describe this exceptionalism of the U.S. within and outside its borders.\nThe concept has also been discussed in the context of the 21st century in a book co-authored by former American Vice President Dick Cheney: \"\" (2015).\n\nScholars have explored possible justifications for the notion of American exceptionalism.\n\nMany scholars use a model of American exceptionalism developed by Harvard political scientist Louis Hartz. In \"The Liberal Tradition in America\" (1955), Hartz argued that the American political tradition lacks the left-wing/socialist and right-wing/aristocratic elements that dominated in most other lands because colonial America lacked any feudal traditions, such as established churches, landed estates and a hereditary nobility. The \"liberal consensus\" school, typified by David Potter, Daniel Boorstin and Richard Hofstadter followed Hartz in emphasizing that political conflicts in American history remained within the tight boundaries of a liberal consensus regarding private property, individual rights, and representative government. The national government that emerged was far less centralized or nationalized than its European counterparts.\n\nParts of American exceptionalism can be traced to American Puritan roots. Many Puritans with Arminian leanings embraced a middle ground between strict Calvinist predestination and a less restricting theology of Divine Providence. They believed God had made a covenant with their people and had chosen them to provide a model for the other nations of the Earth. One Puritan leader, John Winthrop, metaphorically expressed this idea as a \"City upon a Hill\"—that the Puritan community of New England should serve as a model community for the rest of the world. This metaphor is often used by proponents of exceptionalism. The Puritans' moralistic values remained part of the national identity of the United States for centuries, remaining influential to the present day.\n\nIn this vein, Max Weber was a pioneer in delineating a connection between capitalism and exceptionalism. Eric Luis Uhlmann of Northwestern University argues that Puritan values were taken up by all remaining Americans as time went by. Kevin M. Schultz underlines how they helped America to keep to its \"Protestant Promise\", especially Catholics and Jews.\n\nThe ideas that created the American Revolution were derived from a tradition of republicanism that had been repudiated by the British mainstream. Historian Gordon Wood has argued, \"Our beliefs in liberty, equality, constitutionalism, and the well-being of ordinary people came out of the Revolutionary era. So too did our idea that we Americans are a special people with a special destiny to lead the world toward liberty and democracy.\" Wood notes that the term is \"presently much-maligned,\" although it is vigorously supported by others such as Jon Butler.\n\nThomas Paine's \"Common Sense\" for the first time expressed the belief that America was not just an extension of Europe but a new land, a country of nearly unlimited potential and opportunity that had outgrown the British mother country. These sentiments laid the intellectual foundations for the Revolutionary concept of American exceptionalism and were closely tied to republicanism, the belief that sovereignty belonged to the people, not to a hereditary ruling class.\n\nReligious freedom characterized the American Revolution in unique ways—at a time when major nations had state religions. Republicanism (led by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison) created modern constitutional republicanism, with a limit on ecclesiastical powers. Historian Thomas Kidd (2010) argues, \"With the onset of the revolutionary crisis, a significant conceptual shift convinced Americans across the theological spectrum that God was raising up America for some particular purpose.\" Kidd further argues that \"a new blend of Christian and republican ideology led religious traditionalists to embrace wholesale the concept of republican virtue\".\n\nAccording to Tucker and Hendrickson (1992), Jefferson believed America \"was the bearer of a new diplomacy, founded on the confidence of a free and virtuous people, that would secure ends based on the natural and universal rights of man, by means that escaped war and its corruptions\". Jefferson sought a radical break from the traditional European emphasis on \"reason of state\" (which could justify any action) and the usual priority of foreign policy and the needs of the ruling family over the needs of the people.\n\nJefferson envisaged America is becoming the world's great \"Empire of Liberty\"—that is, the model for democracy and republicanism. He identified his nation as a beacon to the world, for, he said on departing the presidency in 1809, America was: \"Trusted with the destinies of this solitary republic of the world, the only monument of human rights, and the sole depository of the sacred fire of freedom and self-government, from hence it is to be lighted up in other regions of the earth, if other areas of the earth shall ever become susceptible of its benign influence.\"\n\nMarilyn B. Young argues that after the end of the Cold War in 1991, neoconservative intellectuals and policymakers embraced the idea of an \"American empire,\" a national mission to establish freedom and democracy in other nations, particularly poor ones. She argues that after the September 11th, 2001 terrorist attacks, the George W. Bush administration reoriented foreign policy to an insistence on maintaining the supreme military and economic power of America, an attitude that harmonized with this new vision of American empire. Young says the Iraq War (2003–2011) exemplified American exceptionalism.\n\nIn 2012, conservative historians Larry Schweikart and Dave Dougherty argued that American Exceptionalism be based on four pillars: (1) Common Law; (2) Virtue and morality located in Protestant Christianity; (3) Free-market capitalism; and (4) the sanctity of private property.\n\nIn a 2015 book entitled \"Exceptional: Why the World Needs a Powerful America\", former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney sets out and argues the case for American Exceptionalism, and concludes: \"we are, as Lincoln said, 'the last, best hope of earth.' We are not just one more nation, one more same entity on the world stage. We have been essential to the preservation and progress of freedom, and those who lead us in the years ahead must remind us, as Roosevelt, Kennedy, and Reagan did, of the unique role we play. Neither they nor we should ever forget that we are, in fact, exceptional.\"\n\nProponents of American exceptionalism argue that the United States be exceptional in that it was founded on a set of republican ideals, rather than on a common heritage, ethnicity, or ruling elite. In the formulation of President Abraham Lincoln in his Gettysburg Address, America is a nation \"conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal\". In Lincoln's interpretation, America is inextricably connected with freedom and equality, and in world perspective, the American mission is to ensure, \"that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.\" Historian T. Harry Williams argues that Lincoln believed:\n\nAmerican policies have been characterized since their inception by a system of federalism (between the states and the federal government) and checks and balances (among the legislative, executive and judicial branches), which were designed to prevent any faction, region, or government organ from becoming too powerful. Some proponents of the theory of American exceptionalism argue that this system and the accompanying distrust of concentrated power prevent the United States from suffering a \"tyranny of the majority\", are preservative of a free republican democracy, and also that it allows citizens to live in a locality whose laws reflect those voters' values. A consequence of this political system is that laws can vary widely across the country. Critics of American exceptionalism maintain that this system merely replaces the power of the national majority over states with power by the states over local entities. On balance, the American political system arguably allows for more local dominance but prevents more domestic dominance than does a more unitary system.\n\nHistorian Eric Foner has explored the question of birthright citizenship, the provision of the Fourteenth Amendment (1868) that makes every baby born in the United States a full citizen.\nHe argues that:\n\nYale Law School Dean Harold Hongju Koh has identified what he says is \"the most important respect in which the United States has been genuinely exceptional, about international affairs, international law, and promotion of human rights: namely, in its outstanding global leadership and activism.\" He argues:\n\nTo this day, the United States remains the only superpower capable, and at times willing, to commit real resources and make real sacrifices to build, sustain, and drive an international system committed to international law, democracy, and the promotion of human rights. Experience teaches that when the United States leads on human rights, from Nuremberg to Kosovo, other countries follow.\n\nPeggy Noonan, an American political pundit, wrote in \"The Wall Street Journal\" that \"America is not exceptional because it has long attempted to be a force for good in the world, it tries to be a force for good because it is exceptional\".\n\nFormer U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney explores the concept of United States global leadership in a 2015 book on American foreign policy entitled \"\", co-authored with his daughter, Liz Cheney, a former official of the United States Department of State.\n\nProponents of American exceptionalism often claim that many features of the \"American spirit\" were shaped by the frontier process (following Frederick Jackson Turner's Frontier Thesis). They argue the American frontier allowed individualism to flourish as pioneers adopted democracy and equality and shed centuries-old European institutions such as royalty, standing armies, established churches and a landed aristocracy that owned most of the land. However, this frontier experience was not entirely unique to the United States. Other nations had frontiers, but it did not shape them nearly as much as the American frontier did, usually because it was under the control of a strong national government. South Africa, Russia, Brazil, Argentina, Canada and Australia had long frontiers, but they did not have \"free land\" and local control. The political and cultural environments were much different—the other frontiers did not involve widespread ownership of free land nor allow the settlers to control the local and provincial governments as in America. Their edge did not shape their national psyches. Each nation had entirely different frontier experiences. For example, the Dutch Boers in South Africa were defeated in war by Britain. In Australia, \"mateship\" and working together was valued more than individualism was in the United States.\n\nFor most of its history, especially from the mid-19th to early 20th centuries, the United States has been known as the \"land of opportunity\", and in this sense, it prided and promoted itself on providing individuals with the opportunity to escape from the contexts of their class and family background. Examples of this social mobility include:\n\nHowever, social mobility in the U.S. is lower than in some European Union countries if defined regarding income movements. American men born into the lowest income quintile are much more likely to stay there compared to similar people in the Nordic countries or the United Kingdom. Many economists, such as Harvard economist N. Gregory Mankiw, however, state that the discrepancy has little to do with class rigidity; rather, it is a reflection of income disparity: \"Moving up and down a short ladder is a lot easier than moving up and down a tall one.\"\n\nRegarding public welfare, Richard Rose asked in 1989 whether the evidence shows whether the U.S. \"is becoming more like other mixed-economy welfare states, or increasingly exceptional.\" He concludes, \"By comparison with other advanced industrial nations America is today exceptional in total public expenditure, in major program priorities, and in the value of public benefits.\"\n\nScholars have been polarized on the topic, according to Michael Kammen with historians generally against it, while empirical social scientists have tended to be supporters. Kammen reports that historians Lawrence Veysey, C. Vann Woodward, Eric Foner, Sean Wilentz, Akira Iriye, and Ian Tyrrell have been opponents, while support has come from social scientists Daniel Bell, Seymour Martin Lipset, Alex Inkeles, Sanford Jacoby, Samuel P. Huntington, Mona Harrington, John P. Roche, Richard Rose, Peter Temin, and Aaron Wildavsky.\n\nKammen argues that the hostile attacks began in the 1970s in the wake of the Vietnam War, when many intellectuals decided, \"The American Adam had lost his innocence and given way to a helpless, tarnished Gulliver.\" At about the same time, the new social history used statistical techniques on population samples that seemed to show resemblances with Europe on issues such as social mobility. By the 1980s, labor historians were emphasizing that the failure of a work party to emerge in the United States did not mean that America was exceptionally favorable grounds for workers. By the late 1980s, other academic critics started mocking the extreme chauvinism displayed by the modern usage of exceptionalism. Finally mid-1980s, colonial historians downplayed the uniqueness of the American experience in the context of British history. On the other hand, some of the critics pulled their punches, with Wilentz arguing for \"distinctively American forms of class conflict\" and Foner saying there was a \"distinctive character of American trade unionism.\"\n\nThe third idea of American exceptionalism—superiority—has been attacked with charges of moral defectiveness and the existence of double standards. In \"American Exceptionalism and Human Rights\" (2005), Canadian commentator Michael Ignatieff couches his discussion of the topic in entirely pejorative terms. He identifies three main sub-types: \"exemptionalism\" (supporting treaties as long as U.S. citizens are exempt from them); \"double standards\" (criticizing \"others for not heeding the findings of international human rights bodies, but ignoring what these organizations say of the United States\"); and \"legal isolationism\" (the tendency of U.S. judges to ignore other jurisdictions).\n\nDuring the George W. Bush administration (2001–2009), the term was somewhat abstracted from its historical context. Proponents and opponents alike began using it to describe a phenomenon wherein certain political interests view the United States as being \"above\" or an \"exception\" to the law, specifically the Law of Nations. (This phenomenon is less concerned with justifying American uniqueness than with asserting its immunity to international law.) This new use of the term has served to confuse the topic and muddy the waters since its unilateralist emphasis, and actual orientation diverges somewhat from prior uses of the phrase. A certain number of those who subscribe to \"old-style\" or \"traditional American exceptionalism\"-the idea that America is a more nearly exceptional nation than are others, that it differs qualitatively from the rest of the world and has a unique role to play in world history—also agree that the United States is and ought to be entirely subject to and bound by the public international law. Indeed, recent research shows that \"there is some indication for American exceptionalism among the [U.S.] public, but very little evidence of unilateral attitudes\".\n\nOn September 12, 2013, in the context of U.S. President Barack Obama's comment about American exceptionalism during his September 10, 2013, talk to the American people while considering military action on Syria for its alleged use of chemical weapons against civilians, Russian President Vladimir Putin criticized Obama saying that \"It is extremely dangerous to encourage people to see themselves as exceptional, whatever the motivation.\"\n\nIn his interview with RT on October 4, 2013, President of Ecuador Rafael Correa criticized Obama's policies and compared America's exceptionalism with Nazi Germany, saying: \"Does not this remind you of the Nazis' rhetoric before and during World War II? They considered themselves the chosen race, the superior race, etc. Such words and ideas pose extreme danger.\"\n\nCritics on the left such as Marilyn Young and Howard Zinn have argued that American history is so morally flawed, citing slavery, civil rights and social welfare issues, that it cannot be an exemplar of virtue. Zinn argues that American exceptionalism cannot be of divine origin because it was not benign, especially when dealing with Native Americans.\n\nDonald E. Pease mocks American exceptionalism as a \"state fantasy\" and a \"myth\" in his 2009 book \"The New American Exceptionalism\". Pease notes that \"state fantasies cannot altogether conceal the inconsistencies they mask\", showing how such events as the revelations of prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib prison and the exposure of government incompetence after Hurricane Katrina \"opened fissures in the myth of exceptionalism\".\n\nAmerican theologian Reinhold Niebuhr argued that the automatic assumption that America acts for the right will bring about moral corruption. However, Niebuhr did support the nation's Cold War policies. His position (called \"Christian realism\") advocated a liberal notion of responsibility that justified interference in other nations.\n\nU.S. historians like Thomas Bender \"try and put an end to the recent revival of American exceptionalism, a defect he esteems to be inherited from the Cold War\". Gary W. Reichard and Ted Dickson argue \"how the development of the United States has always depended on its transactions with other nations for commodities, cultural values and populations\". Roger Cohen asks, \"How exceptional can you be when every major problem you face, from terrorism to nuclear proliferation to gas prices, requires joint action?\" Harold Koh distinguishes \"distinctive rights, different labels, the 'flying buttress' mentality, and double standards. (…) [T]he fourth face—double standards—presents the most dangerous and destructive form of American exceptionalism.\" Godfrey Hodgson also concludes that \"the US national myth is dangerous\". Samantha Power asserts that \"we're neither the shining example, nor even competent meddlers. It's going to take a generation or so to reclaim American exceptionalism.\"\n\nIn 1898 Pope Leo XIII denounced what he deemed to be the heresy of Americanism in the encyclical \"Testem benevolentiae nostrae\". He targeted American exceptionalism in the ecclesiastical domain, arguing that it stood in opposition to Papal denunciations of modernism. At the end of the 19th century, there was a tendency among Catholic clergy in the United States to view American society as inherently different from other Christian nations, and to argue that the understanding of Church doctrine had to be enlarged in order to encompass the 'American Experience', which included greater individualism, tolerance of other religions, and Church–State separation.\n\nHerbert London has defined \"pre-emptive declinism\" as a postmodern belief \"that the United States is not an exceptional nation and is not entitled by virtue of history to play a role on the world stage different from other nations\". London ascribed the view to Paul Krugman, among others. Krugman had written in \"The New York Times\" that \"We have always known that America's reign as the world's greatest nation would eventually end. However, most of us imagined that our downfall, when it came, would be something grand and tragic.\"\n\nAccording to RealClearPolitics, declarations of America's declining power have been common in the English-language media. In 1988, Flora Lewis said that \"Talk of U.S. decline is real in the sense that the U.S. can no longer pull all the levers of command or pay all the bills.\" According to Anthony Lewis in 1990, Europeans and Asians are already finding confirmation of their suspicion that the United States is in decline. Citing America's dependence on foreign sources of energy and \"crucial weaknesses\" in the military, Tom Wicker concluded \"that maintaining superpower status is becoming more difficult—nearly impossible—for the United States\". In 2004, Pat Buchanan lamented \"the decline and fall of the greatest industrial republic the world had ever seen\". In 2007, Matthew Parris of \"The Sunday Times\" in London wrote that the United States is \"overstretched\", romantically recalling the Kennedy presidency, when \"America had the best arguments\" and could use moral persuasion rather than force to have its way in the world. From his vantage point in Shanghai, the \"International Herald Tribune\"s Howard French worries about \"the declining moral influence of the United States\" over an emergent China.\n\nIn his book, \"The Post-American World\", \"Newsweek\" editor Fareed Zakaria refers to a \"Post-American world\" that he says \"is not about the decline of America, but rather about the rise of everyone else\".\n\nIn December 2009, historian Peter Baldwin published a book arguing that, despite widespread attempts to contrast the 'American way of life' and the 'European social model', America and Europe are actually very similar to a number of social and economic indices. Baldwin claimed that the black underclass accounts for many of those few areas where a stark difference exists between the U.S. and Europe, such as homicide and child poverty.\n\nThe historian Felipe Fernández-Armesto argues that it be commonly thought that all people consider themselves exceptional. In most cases in which this subject has been broached the similarities between the conflicting parties outweigh the differences. Things such as the \"dynamic wealth creation, the democracy, the accessibility of opportunity, the cult of civil liberty, the tradition of tolerance,\" and what Fernández-Armesto considers evils such as the materialistic economy, the excessive privileges of wealth, and the selective illiberality are standard features in many modern societies. However, he adds, America is made exceptional by the intensity with which these characteristics are concentrated there.\n\nIn April 2009, U.S. President Barack Obama responded to a journalist's question in Strasbourg with the statement, \"I believe in American exceptionalism, just as I suspect that the Brits believe in British exceptionalism and the Greeks believe in Greek exceptionalism.\" Obama further noted that \"I see no contradiction between believing that America has a continued extraordinary role in leading the world towards peace and prosperity and recognizing that leadership is incumbent, depends on, our ability to create partnerships because we create partnerships because we can't solve these problems alone.\" Mitt Romney attacked Obama's statement, arguing it showed Obama did not believe in American exceptionalism. Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee said that Obama's \"worldview is dramatically different from any president, Republican or Democrat, we've had... He grew up more as a globalist than an American. To deny American exceptionalism is in essence to deny the heart and soul of this nation.\"\n\nIn a speech on the Syria crisis on September 10, 2013, Obama said: \"however, when, with modest effort and risk, we can stop children from being gassed to death, and thereby make our kids safer over the long run, I believe we should act... That is what makes America different. That is what makes us exceptional.\" In a direct response the next day, Russian President Vladimir Putin published an op-ed in \"The New York Times\", articulating that \"It is extremely dangerous to encourage people to see themselves as exceptional, whatever the motivation... We are all different, but when we ask for the Lord's blessings, we must not forget that God created us equal.\" Putin's views were soon endorsed by future president Donald Trump who declared the op-ed \"a masterpiece\": \"You think of the term as being beautiful, but all of sudden you say, what if you're in Germany or Japan or any one of 100 different countries? You are not going to like that term,\" Trump said. \"It is very insulting, and Putin put it to him about that.\" Some left-wing American commentators agree with Trump's stance; one example is Sherle Schwenninger, a co-founder of the New America Foundation, who in a 2016 \"Nation\" magazine symposium remarked that \"Trump would redefine American exceptionalism by bringing an end to the neoliberal/neoconservative globalist project that Hillary Clinton and many Republicans support\".\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "402112", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=402112", "title": "Analytical Thomism", "text": "Analytical Thomism\n\nAnalytical Thomism is a philosophical movement which promotes the interchange of ideas between the thought of Saint Thomas Aquinas (including the philosophy carried on in relation to his thinking, called 'Thomism'), and modern analytic philosophy. \n\nScottish philosopher John Haldane first coined the term in the early 1990s and has since been one the movement's leading proponents. According to Haldane, \"analytical Thomism involves the bringing into mutual relationship of the styles and preoccupations of recent English-speaking philosophy and the ideas and concerns shared by St Thomas and his followers\" (Haldane 2004, xii).\n\nThe modern revival of Aquinas's thought can be traced to the work of mid-19th Century thomists, such as Tommaso Maria Zigliara, Josef Kleutgen, Gaetano Sanseverino, and Giovanni Maria Cornoldi. This movement received an enormous impetus by Pope Leo XIII's encyclical \"Aeterni Patris\" of 1879. In the first half of the twentieth century, Edouard Hugon, Réginald Garrigou-Lagrange, Étienne Gilson, and Jacques Maritain, among others, carried on Leo's call for a Thomist revival (Paterson & Pugh, xiii-xxiii). Gilson and Maritain in particular taught and lectured throughout Europe and North America, influencing a generation of English-speaking Catholic philosophers. Some of the latter then began to harmonize Thomism with broader contemporary philosophical trends. \n\nSimilarly, the Kraków Circle in Poland used mathematical logic in presenting Thomism, which the Circle judged to have \"a structured body of propositions connected in meaning and subject matter, and linked by logical relations of compatibility and incompatibility, entailment, etc.\" (Simons 2011, pp. 61-79). The Circle has been said to be \"the most significant expression of Catholic thought between the two World Wars\" (Kraków Philosophy, n.d.).\n\nBy the middle of the 20th century Aquinas's thought came into dialogue with the analytical tradition through the work of G. E. M. Anscombe, Peter Geach, and Anthony Kenny. Anscombe was Ludwig Wittgenstein's student, and his successor at the University of Cambridge; she was married to Geach, himself an accomplished logician and philosopher of religion. Geach had converted to Roman Catholicism while studying at Oxford, Anscombe had converted before she came up, and both were instructed in the Faith in Oxford by the Dominican Richard Kehoe, who received them both into the Church before they met one another. Kenny, an erstwhile priest and former Catholic, became a prominent philosopher at the University of Oxford and is still portrayed by some as a promoter of Aquinas (Paterson & Pugh, xiii-xxiii), though his denial of some basic Thomist doctrines (e.g. divine timelessness) casts doubt on this. \n\nAnscombe, and others such as Alasdair MacIntyre, Philippa Foot, and John Finnis, can largely be credited with the revival of \"virtue ethics\" in analytic moral theory and \"natural law theory\" in jurisprudence. Both movements draw significantly upon Aquinas.\n\nPhilosophers working in the intersection of Thomism and analytic philosophy include:\n\n\n\n\n\nFor somewhat dissenting voices:\n"}

He has been called \"the father of Russian poetry\".\n\nKantemir was born into a noble Moldavian family of Crimean Tatar origin, \"Kantemir\" deriving from \"Khan Timur\", at Iaşi on 8 September 1708. His illiterate grandfather Constantin had been made voivode of Moldavia by the Ottomans in 1685 and was succeeded by his well-educated sons Antioch and Demetrius. Kantemir was the son of Demetrius by his wife, the Princess Kassandra Cantacuzene, who claimed descent from the Byzantine dynasty of the same name. He spent much of his youth in Constantinople as a hostage to the Turks. He was then educated by his father and at the St Petersburg Academy before moving to the family estate near Dmitrovsk.\n\nHe served as the Russian ambassador at London from 1731 to 1736, when he was relocated to Paris to serve as Russia's minister plenipotentiary to the Kingdom of France. There, he became a noted intellectual and a close friend of Montesquieu and Voltaire. Kantemir died a bachelor in Paris amid litigation concerning his illegitimate children.\n\nConsidered \"the father of Russian poetry\", Kantemir used his classical education to assist Peter the Great's programme of modernizing and westernizing Russian culture. His most noticeable effort in this regard is his \"Petrida\", an unfinished epic glorifying the emperor. He produced a tract on old Russian versification in 1744 and numerous odes and fables. His use of gallic rhyme schemes can make his work seem antiquated and awkward to modern readers.\n\nHe edited his father's \"History of the Growth and Decay of the Ottoman Empire\" in England and wrote a biography and bibliography of his father which later accompanied its 1756 edition. His 1742 \"Letters on Nature and Man\" (\"O Prirode i Cheloveke\") was a philosophical work. He is best remembered for his satires in the manner of Juvenal, including \"To My Mind: On Those Who Blame Education\" and \"On the Envy and Pride of Evil-Minded Courtiers\", which were among the first such works in the Russian language.\n\nKantemir also translated Horace and Anacreon into Russian, as well as Algarotti's \"Dialogues on Light and Colors\". His 1740 translation of De Fontenelle's \"Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds\" was partly censored as heretical. His own works were translated into French by the Abbé Guasco, who also penned his biography.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "962373", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=962373", "title": "Black separatism", "text": "Black separatism\n\nBlack separatism is a separatist political movement that seeks separate economic and cultural development for those of African descent in societies, particularly in the United States. Black separatism is a subcategory of black nationalism, stemming from the idea of racial solidarity, and implies that blacks should organize themselves on the basis of their common experience of oppression as a result of their blackness, culture, and African heritage. Black separatism in its purest form, as a subcategory of black nationalism, asserts that blacks and whites ideally should form two independent nations. Black separatists also often seek their original cultural homeland. Black separatists generally think that black people are hindered in their advancement in a society dominated by a white majority.\n\nThere are similarities between black nationalism and black separatism. They both aim for the rights of blacks, but there are a few differences. All black separatists are black nationalists, but not all black nationalists are black separatists. Black separatists believe that black people should be physically separated from other races, primarily whites; black separatists would want a separate nation for black people. This is slightly different from black nationalists because black nationalists don't always believe in a physical separation of black people. In some form, black nationalists do believe in separation, but not physical separation. Black nationalists focus more on black pride, justice, and identity. Their belief is that blacks should be proud of their own skin, heritage, and beauty. They also believe that there should be justice for black people especially in America. Examples of black nationalist organizations include the Nation of Islam and the New Black Panther Party. A specific example of a separatist movement is the Pan-Africanism movement.\n\nIn his discussion of black nationalism in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the historian Wilson Jeremiah Moses observes that \"black separatism, or self-containment, which in its extreme form advocated the perpetual physical separation of the races, usually referred only to a simple institutional separatism, or the desire to see black people making independent efforts to sustain themselves in a proven hostile environment.\"\n\nScholars Talmadge Anderson and James Stewart further make a distinction between the \"classical version of Black separatism advocated by Booker T. Washington\" and \"modern separatist ideology.\" They observe that \"Washington's accommodationist advice\" at the end of the nineteenth century \"was for Blacks not to agitate for social, intellectual, and professional equality with Whites.\" By contrast, they observe, \"contemporary separatists exhort Blacks not only to equal Whites but to surpass them as a tribute to and redemption of their African heritage.\" Anderson and Stewart add, moreover, that in general \"modern black separatism is difficult to define because of its similarity to black nationalism.\"\n\nIndeed, black separatism's specific goals were historically in flux and varied from group to group. Martin Delany in the 19th century and Marcus Garvey in the 1920s outspokenly called for African Americans to return to Africa, by moving to Liberia. Benjamin \"Pap\" Singleton looked to form separatist colonies in the American West. The Nation of Islam calls for several independent black states on American soil. More mainstream views within black separatism hold that black people would be better served by schools and businesses exclusively for black people, and by local black politicians and police.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "42457467", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42457467", "title": "Causation in Sciences Project", "text": "Causation in Sciences Project\n\nCausation in Sciences Project (CauSci) is a 4-year interdisciplinary research project on the field of causation in the Philosophy of Science, funded by the Norwegian Research Council (NFR) and hosted by the School of Economics and Business at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences (NMBU).\n\nCausality is one of the key concepts employed in the sciences. In our attempt to understand and influence the world around us, one of the main things we need to know is what causes what. Once we understand the causal connections, we are in a position to explain what has gone before, predict what will come in the future, and intervene to produce the outcomes we require. While scientists deal with the concrete details, it is philosophers who consider in the abstract what it is for one thing to cause another. The aim of this project is to bring together that abstract philosophical approach to causation with a more concrete understanding of the work actually undertaken by the practitioners of the sciences.\n\nCauSci is based on a dispositional theory of causation, in which a cause is understood as event that disposes towards an effect or outcome. A further key theme for causation comes from that this theory, namely Reductionism versus holism in the sciences. Many philosophers have been attracted to a reductive view of nature in which everything is to be explained ultimately in terms of subatomic particles. But is there any evidence for the success of reductionism in the sciences or is the view a mere philosophers’ fancy? It appears, on the contrary, that many sciences are premised on holistic phenomena that cannot be reduced to the sum of their parts: at certain levels of nature, new causal powers emerge that cannot be explained at relatively lower levels. Nature is stratified.\n\nThe project aims to test the existing dispositional theory of causation against four key sciences in which the issues of causation, emergentism and reduction are central: physics, biology, psychology and the social sciences. While the theory aims to offer new insights that explain practice within these sciences, the theory in return will gain a more empirically informed grounding. A team of Norwegian and international researchers in these four fields have been recruited as collaborators to the project.\n\nThe methodological basis of the project is that philosophy should not dictate to science and nor should science dictate to philosophy. While these two disciplines have the same subject matter - understanding the world - they aim to answer very different questions. What can be achieved, however, is a reflective equilibrium: a unified view of causation that is both philosophically and empirically satisfactory. It is all well and good for philosophers to decide a priori what would make a good theory of causation, but what use is that if scientists are dealing with something else? By considering both the abstract and the concrete together in unison, an account can emerge that is both philosophically and empirically adequate and complete.\n\nFour central sciences have been selected against which to test and improve the causal dispositionalist hypothesis. The approach will be to apply the theory to some of the key problems within that science. It will be taken as a sign of success for the theory if it is able to solve those problems or at the very least offer some illumination of them. The sciences are selected on the basis of their centrality but also their diversity. Theories of causation are sometimes criticised on the basis that they explain only causation in physics, for instance, but with no indication of how they could apply to biological, social or mental causation. The four sciences selected therefore cover some of the most important divisions across human thinking: matter, life, mind and society.\n\n\n"}

The central concept had been outlined in a review of 1992. The term CoRR was introduced in 2003 in a paper in \"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society\" entitled \"The function of genomes in bioenergetic organelles\".\n\nChloroplasts and mitochondria are energy-converting organelles in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells. Chloroplasts in plant cells perform photosynthesis; the capture and conversion of the energy of sunlight. Mitochondria in both plant and animal cells perform respiration; the release of this stored energy when work is done. In addition to these key reactions of bioenergetics, chloroplasts and mitochondria each contain specialized and discrete genetic systems. These genetic systems enable chloroplasts and mitochondria to make some of their own proteins.\n\nBoth the genetic and energy-converting systems of chloroplasts and mitochondria are descended, with little modification, from those of the free-living bacteria that these organelles once were. The existence of these cytoplasmic genomes is consistent with, and counts as evidence for, the endosymbiont hypothesis. Most genes for proteins of chloroplasts and mitochondria are, however, now located on chromosomes in the nuclei of eukaryotic cells. There they code for protein precursors that are made in the cytosol for subsequent import into the organelles.\n\nCoRR seeks to explain why chloroplasts and mitochondria retain DNA, and thus why some characters are inherited through the cytoplasm in the phenomenon of cytoplasmic, non-Mendelian, uniparental, or maternal inheritance. CoRR does so by offering an answer to this question: why, in evolution, did some bacterial, endosymbiont genes move to the cell nucleus, while others did not?\n\nCoRR states that chloroplasts and mitochondria contain those genes whose expression is required to be under the direct, regulatory control of the redox state of their gene products, or of electron carriers with which those gene products interact. Such genes comprise a core, or primary subset, of organellar genes. The requirement for redox control of each gene in the primary subset then confers an advantage upon location of that gene within the organelle. Natural selection therefore anchors some genes in organelles, while favouring location of others in the cell nucleus.\n\nChloroplast and mitochondrial genomes also contain genes for components of the chloroplast and mitochondrial genetic systems themselves. These genes comprise a secondary subset of organellar genes: genetic system genes. There is generally no requirement for redox control of expression of genetic system genes, though their being subject to redox control may, in some cases, allow amplification of redox signals acting upon genes in the primary subset (bioenergetic genes).\n\nRetention of genes of the secondary subset (genetic system genes) is necessary for the operation of redox control of expression of genes in the primary subset. If all genes disappear from the primary subset, CoRR predicts that there is no function for genes in the secondary subset, and such organelles will then, eventually, lose their genomes completely. However, if even only one gene remains under redox control, then an organelle genetic system is required for the synthesis of its single gene product.\n\n\n"}

Three monks of St. Joseph's Abbey in Spencer, Massachusetts are attributed with developing the practices used by Contemplative Outreach; Fathers Thomas Keating, William Meninger, and M. Basil Pennington. Fathers Meninger and Pennington began giving retreats to priests and nuns based on the 14th-century text \"The Cloud of Unknowing\", considered a classic in many cloistered monastic traditions. Father Keating was serving as the abbot at Spencer Monastery and encouraged this work. In 1983, Father Thomas Keating had retired to live at St. Benedict's Monastery in Snowmass, Colorado. After giving a retreat on Centering Prayer at the Lama Foundation the seeds of Contemplative Outreach were planted. \n\nContemplative Outreach is an ecumenical, international organization today, whose stated purpose is to:\n\nThe stated intent of Contemplative Outreach is to foster the process of transformation in Christ in one another through the practice of Centering Prayer.\n\nContemplative Outreach offers a number of different retreats and teachings with Centering Prayer and Lectio Divina as the primary methods used to enter into contemplative prayer.\n\nCentering Prayer is a generic term used today for many different methods of prayer and meditation. In Contemplative Outreach it is based on the four guidelines developed by Father Meninger and based on \"The Cloud of Unknowing\". \n\nAs abbot of St. Joseph's Abbey, Fr. Keating attended a meeting in Rome in 1971. At the meeting, Pope Paul VI called on the members of the clergy to revive the contemplative dimension of the Gospel in the lives of both monastic and laypeople. Believing in the importance of this revival, Fr. Keating encouraged the monks at St. Joseph's to develop a method of Christian contemplative prayer with the same appeal and accessibility that Eastern meditation practices seemed to have for modern people. A monk at the abbey named William Meninger found the background for such a method in the anonymous fourteenth-century classic \"The Cloud of Unknowing\". Using this and other contemplative literature, Meninger developed a simple method of silent prayer he called The Prayer of the Cloud.\n\nMeninger began to offer instruction on The Prayer of the Cloud to priests who came to the monastery for retreats. The prayer was well received and, as word got out, more people wanted to learn the prayer, so Fr. Keating began to offer workshops to the lay community in Spencer. Another monk at the abbey, Basil Pennington, also began to teach The Prayer of the Cloud to priests and sisters at retreats away from St. Joseph's. At one retreat, someone suggested that the name of the prayer be changed to Centering Prayer, alluding to Thomas Merton's description of contemplative prayer as prayer that is \"centered entirely on the presence of God...His will...His love...[and] Faith by which alone we can know the presence of God.\" From then on, the prayer was called Centering Prayer.\n\nIn 1983, Fr. Keating gave the first \"intensive\" Centering Prayer retreat at the Lama Foundation in San Cristobal, New Mexico. One of the participants in the retreat, Gustave Reininger, previously had met with Fr. Keating and a man named Edward Bednar to discuss starting a contemplative network. After their meeting, Bednar wrote a grant proposal, which he called Contemplative Outreach, and received funds to start parish-based programs in New York City that offered introductions to Centering Prayer. This marked the beginning of the Contemplative Outreach Centering Prayer Program and a milestone in Contemplative Outreach's birth as an organization.\n\nOther participants in the retreat at the Lama Foundation also played a large part in the growth of Contemplative Outreach. In 1985, participants David Frenette and Mary Mrozowski, along with Bob Bartel, established a live-in community in the eastern United States called Chrysalis House. For 11 years, Chrysalis House provided a consistent place to hold Centering Prayer workshops and retreats. Many Centering Prayer practitioners and teachers who now carry on the work of Contemplative Outreach were trained and inspired at Chrysalis House.\n\nIn 1986, the three monks' experiment was incorporated as Contemplative Outreach, Ltd., and the first official board of directors was named. Fr. Keating served as the first president, Fr. Carl Arico as vice president, Gustave Reininger as treasurer, and Mary Mrozowski and Gail Fitzpatrick-Hopler as directors. At first, the organization was run from Gail Fitzpatirick-Hopler's dining room table. After several necessary expansions, the network's international headquarters now has offices in of space in downtown Butler, New Jersey, with seven full-time employees, two part-time employees, and five volunteers.\n\n\n"}

The term also refers to six orthodox schools of Hindu philosophy and their literature on spirituality and soteriology.\n\nThe word, also in the forms of \"darśana\" or \"darshanam\", comes from Sanskrit दर्शन, from \"dṛś\", \"to see\", vision, apparition or glimpse.\n\n\"Darśana\" is described as an \"auspicious sight\" of a holy person, which bestows merit on the person who is seen. \"Sight\" here means seeing or beholding, and/or being seen or beheld.\n\nIt is most commonly used for theophany, \"manifestation / visions of the divine\", in Hindu worship, e.g. of a deity (especially in image form), or a very holy person or artifact. One can receive \"darśana\" or a glimpse of the deity in the temple, or from a great saintly person, such as a great guru.\n\nThe term \"darśana\" also refers to the six systems of thought, called \"darśanam\", that comprise classical Hindu philosophy. The term therein implies how each of these six systems distinctively look at things and the scriptures in Indian philosophies. The six orthodox Hindu \"darśana\" are Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Samkhya, Yoga, Mīmāṃsā, and Vedanta. Buddhism and Jainism are examples of non-Hindu \"darśana\"s.\n\nOn the significance of \"darśana\" in Mahayana thought, Paul Harrison writes: \"By the second century CE... the vision of the Buddha (\"buddha-darśana\") and the accompanying hearing of the Dharma (\"dharma-śravaṇa\") are represented as a transformation experience of decisive importance for practitioners, be they who have renounced (mundane life) \"ascetics\" or householders.\"\n\nThe Abhidharma, collections of systematic summaries of the sutras, mention \"Darśana-citta, i.e.\" visions.\n\nIndian Mahayana philosophers Vasubandhu and Asanga acknowledged five paths to liberation, of which the third is \"darśana-marga\", the \"path of seeing\".\n\nNagarjuna, a prominent philosopher of the Madhyamaka school of Mahayana Buddhism, wrote that the wise person perceives \"tattva-darśana,\" true reality.\n\n\"Darśana\" also sometimes has a more mundane meaning. For example, Sivananda Saraswati wrote in his book \"The Practice of Brahmacharya\" that one of the eight aspects of brahmacharya (celibacy) is not to look lustfully at women: \"You should carefully avoid... Darshana or looking at women with passionate resolve\".\n\nScholar of religion Richard H. Davis has said that \"darśana\" (viewpoint, philosophical school) is one of three terms in classical Indian discourse that could be considered roughly analogous to what today's English-speakers understand as \"religion.\" The other two terms are \"dharma\" (duty, morality, a code of proper conduct) and \"marga\" (route, spiritual path). According to Davis, \"most Hindu texts accepted that religious paths (\"marga\") are relative to the points of view (\"darśana\") and moral responsibilities (\"dharma\") of practitioners, whose individual circumstances may make one or another course of action more appropriate in their particular situations.\"\n\nPoet Gary Snyder has given a naturalistic meaning to \"darśana\": \nIn Sikh culture, folios or manuscripts that depict all ten Gurus on a single page are called \"darśana\" paintings, simply because they offer a vision of all ten sacred Gurus in one glance.\n\n"}

The name \"Donglin\" was inspired by the Donglin Temple at the base of Mount Lu, Jiangxi. Yang Shi visited the Donglin Temple and felt that it was a good place for teaching. When he finished his scholarship, he travelled to Wuxi and saw that the layout of the academy was similar to the Donglin Temple, so he taught at that site for 18 years.

The constitution of Canada requires that both versions of each Canadian law be treated as equally authoritative, which can result in problems when the English and French versions do not say exactly the same thing. The equal authenticity rule is derived from section 133 of the \"Constitution Act, 1867\", which states, \"inter alia\", \"The Acts of the Parliament of Canada and the Legislature of Quebec shall be printed and published in both those Languages [i.e. both English and French].\"\n\nThe rule requires courts to treat \"both [the English and French] versions of statutes [as] equally valid and authoritative interpretations of the law,\" The rule holds that both versions are equally authoritative even if the statute in question was clearly drafted in one language and translated into the other, and even if the two versions of the law are incompatible.\n\nAn early version of the principle may be found a statute of the Parliament of the Province of Canada, enacted in 1857. The \"Act respecting the Codification of the Laws of Lower Canada relative to Civil Matters and Procedure\" requires that the Civil Code of Lower Canada be printed only in bilingual form, with English and French displayed on the same page: \"[T]he two texts, when printed, shall stand side by side.\" It has been suggested that this provision of the 1857 Act is \"best understood as a non-verbal legislative sign that the two texts should be interpreted dialogically.\" Whether or not this is an overstatement, it is certainly true that side-by-side publication was the first step towards the eventual adoption of the Equal Authenticity Rule for interpreting bilingual statutes.\n\nThe equal authenticity rule was developed by the Supreme Court of Canada in 1891, in the court’s ruling in \"CPR v. Robinson\". This case dealt with the \"Civil Code of Quebec\", which is enacted in both French and English.\n\nBy implication, the rule also related to all laws enacted by the Parliament of Canada, as section 133 of the \"Constitution Act, 1867\" is equally binding upon the federal Parliament and Quebec legislation.\n\nThe Supreme Court of Canada first applied this rule of judicial interpretation to Acts of Parliament in 1935, in its ruling in the case of \"R. v. DuBois\"\n\nThe rule was reaffirmed as section 18(1) in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, when the constitution was repatriated in 1982.\n\nSome Canadian provinces (Quebec and Manitoba from the time of their establishment, and since 1982 New Brunswick) are constitutionally obligated to enact all laws in both official languages. However, a number of other provinces, such as Ontario, have opted to enact their laws in both English and French, even though they are not constitutionally required to do so. One question, not yet tested in the courts, \"arises...as to whether both versions of bilingual legislation enacted in a province where there is no constitutional requirement to do so would be considered equally authoritative in the absence of an express Equal Authenticity Rule.\" (An \"express\" equal authenticity rule would presumably take the form of such a rule in the relevant province's \"Interpretation Act\" or some other piece of quasi-constitutional legislation.\n\nBastarache \"et al.\", who raise this question, answer it in the affirmative, explaining that in their view, \"the logic applicable to federal, Quebec and Manitoba legislation under the Constitution would also apply [even in the absence of a legislated statement of this logic]: that is, where two languages [sic] versions of a statute are enacted simultaneously both versions will be considered equally authoritative.\"\n"}

The word \"haṭha\" literally means \"force\" and thus alludes to a system of physical techniques.\n\nIn India hatha yoga is associated in popular tradition with the 'Yogis' of the Natha Sampradaya through its mythical founder Matsyendranath. Matsyendranath, also known as Minanath or Minapa in Tibet, is celebrated as a saint in both Buddhist and Hindu tantric and hatha yoga schools. However, James Mallinson associates hatha yoga with the Dashanami Sampradaya and the mystical figure of Dattatreya. According to the Dattatreya Yoga Śastra, there are two forms of hatha yoga: one practiced by Yajñavalkya consisting of the eight limbs of ashtanga yoga and another practiced by Kapila consisting of eight mudras. Currently, the oldest dated text to describe hatha yoga, the 11th century CE \"Amṛtasiddhi\", comes from a tantric Buddhist milieu. The oldest texts to use the actual verbiage of \"hatha\" are also Vajrayana Buddhist.\n\nIn the 20th century, hatha yoga, particularly asanas (the physical postures), became popular throughout the world as a form of physical exercise, and is now colloquially termed simply as \"yoga.\"\n\nAccording to Mallinson, some Hatha Yoga techniques can be traced back at least to the 1st-century CE, in texts such as the Sanskrit epics (Hinduism) and the Pali canon (Buddhism). The Pali canon contains three passages in which the Buddha describes pressing the tongue against the palate for the purposes of controlling hunger or the mind, depending on the passage. However, there is no mention of the tongue being inserted into the nasopharynx as in true khecarī mudrā. The Buddha used a posture where pressure is put on the perineum with the heel, similar to modern postures used to stimulate Kundalini.\n\nAccording to Birch, the earliest mentions of Haṭha Yoga specifically are also from Buddhist texts, mainly Tantric works from the 8th century onwards, such as Puṇḍarīka’s \"Vimalaprabhā\" commentary on the \"Kālacakratantra\". In this text, Haṭha Yoga is defined within the context of tantric sexual ritual: \n\"when the undying moment does not arise because the breath is unrestrained [even] when the image is seen by means of withdrawal (pratyahara) and the other (auxiliaries of yoga, i.e. dhyana, pranayama, dharana, anusmrti and samadhi), then, having forcefully (\"hathena\") made the breath flow in the central channel through the practice of \"nada\", which is about to be explained, [the yogi] should attain the undying moment by restraining the \"bindu\" of the bodhicitta [i.e. semen] in the vajra [i.e. penis] when it is in the lotus of wisdom [i.e. vagina]\".\n\nWhile the actual means of practice are not specified, the forcing of the breath into the central channel and the restraining of \"bindu\" are central features of later haṭhayoga practice texts.\n\nIn medieval times, teachings on Yoga were systematized in several texts:\n\n\nThe methods of the \"Amṛtasiddhi\", \"Dattātreyayogaśāstra\" and \"Vivekamārtaṇḍa\" are used to raise and conserve bindu (semen, and in women \"rajas -\" menstrual fluid) which was seen as the physical essence of life that was constantly dripping down from the head and being lost. These techniques sought to either physically reverse this process (by headstand postures like the \"viparītakaraṇī\") or to use the breath to force bindu upwards through the central channel. Other texts like the \"Vivekamārtaṇḍa,\" \"Goraksaśataka\"̣ and \"Khecarīvidyā\" also teach the raising of kuṇḍalinī. The aims of these practices were siddhis (supranormal powers such as levitation) and mukti (liberation). \n\nThe only other texts older than the Hathapradīpikạ̄ to teach Hatha Yoga ̣ mudrās are the Shiva Samhita, \"Yogabīja\", \"Amaraughaprabodha\", and \"Śārṅgadharapaddhati\".\n\nThe \"Hathapradīpikạ\", also called \"Hatha Yoga Pradipika\", is an important and one of the most influential texts of the Hatha yoga. It was compiled by Svātmārāma in the 15th century CE from earlier hatha yoga texts. These earlier texts were of Vedanta or non-dual Shaiva orientation. From both, the \"Hathapradīpikạ̄\" borrowed non-duality (advaita) philosophies. According to James Mallinson, this reliance on non-dualism helped Hatha Yoga thrive in the medieval period as non-dualism became the \"dominant soteriological method in scholarly religious discourse in India\".\n\n\"Hatha Yoga Pradipika\" lists 35 great yoga siddhas starting with Adi Natha (Hindu god Shiva) followed by Matsyendranath and Gorakshanath. It includes information about shatkarma (six acts of self purification), 15 asana (postures: seated, laying down, and non-seated), pranayama (breathing) and kumbhaka (breath retention), mudras (internalized energetic practices), meditation, chakras (centers of energy), kundalini, nadanusandhana (concentration on inner sound), and other topics.\n\n\"Hatha Yoga Pradipika\" is the best known and most widely used Hatha yoga text. It consists of 389 \"shlokas\" (verses) in four chapters:\nPost-Hathapradipika texts on Hatha yoga include:\n\nHistorically, Hatha yoga has been a broad movement across the Indian traditions, openly available to anyone.\n\nAccording to Mallinson, the Hatha yoga represented a trend towards the democratization of yoga insights and religion similar to the Bhakti movement. It eliminated the need for \"either ascetic renunciation or priestly intermediaries, ritual paraphernalia and sectarian initiations\". This led to its broad historic popularity in India. Later in the 20th-century, states Mallinson, this disconnect of Hatha yoga from religious aspects and the democratic access of Hatha yoga enabled it to spread worldwide.\n\nBetween the 17th and 19th-century, however, the various urban Hindu and Muslim elites and ruling classes viewed Yogis with derision. They were persecuted during the rule of Aurangzeb, who ended a long period of religious tolerance that had defined the rule of his predecessors beginning with Akbar, who famously studied with the yogis and other mystics. Hatha yoga remained popular in rural India. Negative impression for the Hatha yogis continued during the British colonial rule era. According to Mark Singleton, this historical negativity and colonial antipathy likely motivated Swami Vivekananda to make an emphatic distinction between \"merely physical exercises of Hatha yoga\" and the \"higher spiritual path of Raja yoga\". This common disdain by the officials and intellectuals slowed the study and adoption of Hatha yoga.\nModern hatha yoga, of the type seen in the West, has been greatly influenced by the school of Tirumalai Krishnamacharya, who taught from 1924 until his death in 1989. Among his students prominent in popularizing yoga in the West were K. Pattabhi Jois famous for popularizing the vigorous Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga style, B. K. S. Iyengar who emphasized alignment and the use of props, Indra Devi and Krishnamacharya's son T. K. V. Desikachar.\n\nAnother well-known school of Hatha yoga in the 20th-century has been the Divine Life Society founded by Swami Sivananda of Rishikesh (1887–1963) and his many disciples including, among others, Swami Vishnu-devananda – founder of International Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Centres; Swami Satyananda – of the Bihar School of Yoga; and Swami Satchidananda of Integral Yoga. After about 1975, yoga techniques have become increasingly popular globally, in both developed and developing countries.\n\nThe Bihar School of Yoga has been one of the largest Hatha yoga teacher training centers in India but is little known in Europe and the Americas. In the West, Krishnamarcharya-linked schools have been more widely known. Examples of other branded forms of yoga, with some controversies, that contain Hatha yoga methodologies include Anusara Yoga, Ashtanga Yoga, Bikram Yoga, Integral Yoga, Iyengar Yoga, Jivanmukti Yoga, Kundalini Yoga, Kripalu Yoga, Kriya Yoga, Siddha Yoga, Viniyoga, Vinyasa Yoga and White Lotus Yoga.\n\nHatha yoga practice has many elements, both behavioral and of practice. The Hatha yoga texts state that a successful yogi has certain characteristics. Section 1.16 of the \"Hatha Yoga Pradipika\", for example, states these characteristics to be \"utsaha\" (enthusiasm, fortitude), \"sahasa\" (courage), \"dhairya\" (patience), \"jnana tattva\" (essence for knowledge), \"nishcaya\" (resolve, determination) and \"tyaga\" (solitude, renunciation). \n\nIn the Western culture, Hatha yoga is typically understood as \"asanas\" and it can be practiced as such. In the Indian and Tibetan traditions, Hatha yoga is much more. It extends well beyond being a sophisticated physical exercise system and integrates ideas of ethics, diet, cleansing, pranayama (breathing exercises), meditation and a system for spiritual development of the yogi.\n\nThe Hatha yoga texts place major emphasis on \"mitahara\", which connotes \"measured diet\" or \"moderate eating\". For example, sections 1.58 to 1.63 and 2.14 of the \"Hatha Yoga Pradipika\" and sections 5.16 to 5.32 of \"Gheranda samhita\" discuss the importance of proper diet to the body. They link the food one eats and one's eating habits to balancing the body and to gaining most benefits from the practice of Hatha yoga. Eating, states \"Gheranda samhita\", is a form of a devotional act to the temple of body, as if one is expressing affection for the gods. Similarly, sections 3.20 and 5.25 of the \"Shiva Samhita\" text on Hatha Yoga includes \"mitahara\" as an essential part of a Hatha yoga holistic practice.\n\nVerses 1.57 through 1.63 of the critical edition of Hathayoga Pradipika suggests that taste cravings should not drive one’s eating habits, rather the best diet is one that is tasty, nutritious and likable as well as sufficient to meet the needs of one’s body and for one’s inner self. It recommends that one must “eat only when one feels hungry” and “neither overeat nor eat to completely fill the capacity of one’s stomach; rather leave a quarter portion empty and fill three quarters with quality food and fresh water”.\n\nAccording to another Hatha Yoga classic \"Gorakshasataka\", eating a controlled diet is one of the three important parts of a complete and successful practice. The text does not provide details or recipes. The text states, according to Mallinson, \"food should be unctuous and sweet\", one must not overeat and stop when still a bit hungry (leave a quarter of the stomach empty), and whatever one eats should aim to please the Shiva.\n\nHatha yoga teaches various steps of inner body cleansing with consultations of one's yoga teacher. Its texts vary in specifics and number of cleansing methods, ranging from simple hygiene practices to the peculiar exercises such as reversing seminal fluid flow. The most common list is called \"shat-karmani\", or six cleansing actions: \"dhauti\" (cleanse teeth and body), \"vasti\" (cleanse bladder), \"neti\" (cleanse nasal passages), \"trataka\" (cleanse eyes), \"nauli\" (abdominal massage) and \"kapala-bhati\" (cleanse phlegm). The actual procedure for cleansing varies by the Hatha yoga text, with some suggesting water wash and others describing the use of cleansing aids such as cloth.\n\nPrāṇāyāma is made out of two Sanskrit words \"prāṇa\" (प्राण, breath, vital energy, life force) and \"āyāma\" (आयाम, restraining, extending, stretching).\n\nSome Hatha yoga texts teach breath exercises but do not refer to it as Pranayama. For example, \"Gheranda samhita\" in section 3.55 calls it \"Ghatavastha\" (state of being the pot). In others, the term \"Kumbhaka\" or \"Prana-samrodha\" replaces Pranayama. Regardless of the nomenclature, proper breathing and the use of breathing techniques during a posture is a mainstay of Hatha yoga. Its texts state that proper breathing exercises cleanses and balances the body.\n\n\"Pranayama\" is one of the core practices of Hatha yoga, found in its major texts as one of the limbs regardless of whether the total number of limbs taught are four or more. It is the practice of consciously regulating breath (inhalation and exhalation), a concept shared with all schools of yoga. \n\nThis is done in several ways, inhaling and then suspending exhalation for a period, exhaling and then suspending inhalation for a period, slowing the inhalation and exhalation, consciously changing the time/length of breath (deep, short breathing), combining these with certain focussed muscle exercises. \"Pranayama\" or proper breathing is an integral part of \"asanas\". According to section 1.38 of \"Hatha yoga pradipka\", \"Siddhasana\" is the most suitable and easiest posture to learn breathing exercises.\n\nThe different Hatha yoga texts discuss \"pranayama\" in various ways. For example, \"Hatha yoga pradipka\" in section 2.71 explains it as a threefold practice: \"recaka\" (exhalation), \"puraka\" (inhalation) and \"kumbhaka\" (retention). During the exhalation and inhalation, the text states that three things move: air, prana and yogi's thoughts, and all three are intimately connected. It is \"kumbhaka\" where stillness and dissolution emerges. The text divides \"kumbhaka\" into two kinds: \"sahita\" (supported) and \"kevala\" (complete). \"Sahita kumbhaka\" is further sub-divided into two types: retention with inhalation, retention with exhalation. Each of these breath units are then combined in different permutations, time lengths, posture and targeted muscle exercises in the belief that these aerate and assist blood flow to targeted regions of the body.\n\nBefore starting yoga practice, state the Hatha yoga texts, the yogi must establish a suitable place for the yoga practice. This place is away from all distractions, preferably a \"mathika\" (hermitage) that is distant from falling rocks, fire and a damp shifting surface.\n\nOnce a peaceful stable location has been set, the yogi begins the posture exercises called \"asanas\". These Hatha yoga postures come in numerous forms. For a beginner yogi, states Mircea Eliade, these \"asanas\" are uncomfortable, typically difficult, cause the body shakes and typically unbearable to hold for extended periods of time. However, with repetition and persistence, as the muscle tone improves, the effort reduces and posture improves. According to the Hatha yoga texts, each posture becomes perfect when the \"effort disappears\", one no longer thinks about the posture and one's body position, breathes normally per \"pranayama\", and is able to dwell in one's meditation (\"anantasamapattibhyam\").\n\nThe \"asanas\" discussed in different Hatha yoga texts vary significantly. Unlike ancient yoga texts of Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism, it is the Hatha yoga texts that provide step by step methodology on how to enter into an \"asana\". The Hindu text \"Gheranda samhita\", for example, in section 2.8 describes the \"padmasana\" for meditation. Most \"asanas\" are inspired by nature, such as a form of union with symmetric, harmonious flowing shapes of animals, birds or plants.\n\nEarly hatha yoga was used to prevent the dripping of bindu (semen) from the heads of men. The two early hatha yoga techniques were to stand on one's head (viparītakaranī) or make breath flow into the center channel which forces bindu up.\n\nHowever, in later hatha yoga, the Kaula visualization of Kuṇḍalini rising through a system of chakras is overlaid onto the earlier bindu-oriented system. The aim was to access amṛta (the nectar of immortality) situated in the head, which subsequently floods the body. This goal is in contradiction with the early hatha yoga goal of preserving bindu.\n\nThe \"Hatha yoga pradipika\" text dedicates almost a third of its verses to meditation. Similarly, other major texts of Hatha yoga such as \"Shiva samhita\" and \"Gheranda samhita\" discuss meditation. In all three texts, meditation is the ultimate goal of all the preparatory cleansing, asanas, pranayama and other steps. The aim of this meditation is to realize \"Nada-Brahman\", or the complete absorption and union with the Brahman through inner mystic sound. According to Guy Beck – a professor of Religious Studies known for his studies on Yoga and music, a Hatha yogi in this stage of practice seeks \"inner union of physical opposites\", into an inner state of samadhi that is described by Hatha yoga texts in terms of divine sounds, and as a union with \"Nada-Brahman\" in musical literature of ancient India.\n\nThe aims of Hatha yoga in various Indian traditions have been the same as those of other varieties of yoga. These include physical \"siddhis\" (special powers, bodily benefits such as slowing age effects, magical powers) and spiritual liberation (moksha, mukti). According to Mikel Burley, some of the \"siddhis\" are symbolic references to the cherished soteriological goals of Indian religions. For example, the \"Vayu Siddhi\" or \"conquest of the air\" literally implies rising into the air as in levitation, but it likely has a symbolic meaning of \"a state of consciousness into a vast ocean of space\" or \"voidness\" ideas found respectively in Hinduism and Buddhism.\n\nSome traditions such as the Kaula tantric sect of Hinduism and Sahajiya tantric sect of Buddhism pursued more esoteric goals such as alchemy (Nagarjuna, Carpita), magic, \"kalavancana\" (cheating death) and \"parakayapravesa\" (entering another's body). James Mallinson, however, disagrees and suggests that such fringe practices are far removed from the mainstream Yoga's goal as meditation-driven means to liberation in Indian religions. The majority of historic Hatha yoga texts do not give any importance to \"siddhis\". The mainstream practice considered the pursuit of magical powers as a distraction or hindrance to Hatha yoga's ultimate aim of spiritual liberation, self-knowledge or release from rebirth that the Indian traditions call \"mukti\" or \"moksha\".\n\nThe goals of Hatha yoga, in its earliest texts, were linked to \"mumukshu\" (seeker of liberation, moksha). The later texts added and experimented with the goals of \"bubhukshu\" (seeker of enjoyment, bhoga).\n\nHatha yoga is a branch of yoga. It shares numerous ideas and doctrines with other forms of yoga, such as the more ancient Yoga system taught by Patanjali. The differences are in the addition of some aspects, and different emphasis on other aspects. For example, \"pranayama\" is crucial in all yogas, but it is the mainstay of Hatha yoga. Mudras and certain kundalini-related ideas are included in Hatha yoga, but not mentioned in the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali. Patanjali yoga considers \"asanas\" important but dwells less on various \"asanas\" than the Hatha yoga texts. In contrast, the Hatha yoga texts consider meditation as important but dwell less on meditation methodology than Patanjali yoga.\n\nThe Hatha yoga texts acknowledge and refer to Patanjali yoga, attesting to the latter's antiquity. However, this acknowledgment is essentially only in passing, as they offer no serious commentary or exposition of Patanjali's system. This suggests that Hatha yoga developed as a branch of the more ancient yoga. According to P.V. Kane, Patanjali yoga concentrates more on the yoga of the mind, while Hatha yoga focuses on body and health. Some Hindu texts do not recognize this distinction. For example, the \"Yogatattva Upanishad\" teaches a system that includes all aspects of the \"Yogasutras\" of Patanjali, and all additional elements of Hatha yoga practice.\n\nThe impact of Hatha yoga on physical and mental health has been a topic of systematic studies. Some scholars state that a regular and proper yoga practice yields health benefits. Others state that the results of these studies have been mixed and inconclusive, with cancer studies suggesting none to unclear effectiveness, and others suggesting yoga may reduce risk factors and aid in a patient's psychological healing process.\n\nYoga's combined focus on mindfulness, breathing, and physical movements bring health benefits with regular participation. Yoga participants report better sleep, increased energy levels and muscle tone, relief from muscle pain and stiffness, improved circulation and overall better general health. The breathing aspect of yoga can benefit heart rate and blood pressure.\n\nThe 2012 \"Yoga in America\" survey, conducted by Harris Interactive on behalf of \"Yoga Journal\", shows that the number of adult practitioners in the US is 20.4 million, or 8.7 percent. The survey reported that 44 percent of those not practicing yoga said they are interested in trying it.\n\n\n \n\n \n"}
{"id": "14429", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14429", "title": "Henotheism", "text": "Henotheism\n\nHenotheism () is the worship of a single god while not denying the existence or possible existence of other deities. Friedrich Schelling (1775–1854) coined the word, and Friedrich Welcker (1784–1868) used it to depict primitive monotheism among ancient Greeks.\n\nMax Müller (1823–1900), a German philologist and orientalist, brought the term into wider usage in his scholarship on the Indian religions, particularly Hinduism whose scriptures mention and praise numerous deities as if they are one ultimate unitary divine essence. Müller made the term central to his criticism of Western theological and religious exceptionalism (relative to Eastern religions), focusing on a cultural dogma which held \"monotheism\" to be both fundamentally well-defined and inherently superior to differing conceptions of God.\n\nFriedrich Schelling coined the term henotheism, from \"heis\" or \"heno\" which literally means \"single, one\". The term refers to a form of theism focused on a single god. Related terms are monolatrism and kathenotheism. The latter term is an extension of \"henotheism\", . Henotheism refers to a pluralistic theology wherein different deities are viewed to be of a unitary, equivalent divine essence. Another term related to henotheism is \"equitheism\", referring to the belief that all gods are equal. Further, the term henotheism does not exclude monism, nondualism or dualism.\n\nVarious scholars prefer the term monolatrism to henotheism, to discuss religions where a single god is central, but the existence or the position of other gods is not denied. According to Christoph Elsas, henotheism in modern usage connotes a syncretic stage in the development of religions in late antiquity. A henotheist may worship a single god from a pantheon of deities at a given time, depending on his or her choice, while accepting other deities and concepts of god. Henotheism and inclusive monotheism are terms that refer to a middle position between unlimited polytheism and exclusive monotheism.\n\nAhura Mazda is the supreme god, but Zoroastrianism does not deny other deities. Ahura Mazda has yazatas (\"good agents\") some of which include Anahita, Sraosha, Mithra, Rashnu, and Tishtrya. Richard Foltz has put forth evidence that Iranians of Pre-Islamic era worshiped all these figures, especially Mithra and Anahita.\n\nProds Oktor Skjærvø states Zoroastrianism is henotheistic, and \"a dualistic and polytheistic religion, but with one supreme god, who is the father of the ordered cosmos\". Other scholars state that this is unclear, because historic texts present a conflicting picture, ranging from Zoroastrianism's belief in \"one god, two gods, or a best god henotheism\".\n\nHenotheism was the term used by scholars such as Max Müller to describe the theology of Vedic religion. Müller noted that the hymns of the \"Rigveda\", the oldest scripture of Hinduism, mention many deities, but praises them successively as the \"one ultimate, supreme God\", alternatively as \"one supreme Goddess\", thereby asserting that the essence of the deities was unitary (\"ekam\"), and the deities were nothing but pluralistic manifestations of the same concept of the divine (God).\n\nThe Vedic era conceptualization of the divine or the One, states Jeaneane Fowler, is more abstract than a monotheistic God, it is the Reality behind and of the phenomenal universe. The Vedic hymns treat it as \"limitless, indescribable, absolute principle\", thus the Vedic divine is something of a panentheism rather than simple henotheism. In late Vedic era, around the start of Upanishadic age (~800 BCE), theosophical speculations emerge that develop concepts which scholars variously call nondualism or monism, as well as forms of non-theism and pantheism. An example of the questioning of the concept of God, in addition to henotheistic hymns found therein, are in later portions of the \"Rigveda\", such as the Nasadiya Sukta. Hinduism calls the metaphysical absolute concept as Brahman, incorporating within it the transcendent and immanent reality. Different schools of thought interpret Brahman as either personal, impersonal or transpersonal. Ishwar Chandra Sharma describes it as \"Absolute Reality, beyond all dualities of existence and non-existence, light and darkness, and of time, space and cause.\"\n\nWhile Greek and Roman religion began as polytheism, during the Classical period, under the influence of philosophy, differing conceptions emerged. Often Zeus (or Jupiter) was considered the supreme, all-powerful and all-knowing, king and father of the Olympian gods. According to Maijastina Kahlos \"monotheism was pervasive in the educated circles in Late Antiquity\" and \"all divinities were interpreted as aspects, particles or epithets of one supreme God\". Maximus Tyrius (2nd century A.D.) stated: \"In such a mighty contest, sedition and discord, you will see one according law and assertion in all the earth, that there is one god, the king and father of all things, and many gods, sons of god, ruling together with him.\"\n\nThe Neoplatonic philosopher Plotinus taught that above the gods of traditional belief was \"The One\", and polytheist grammarian Maximus of Madauros even stated that only a madman would deny the existence of the supreme God.\n\nRabbinical Judaism as it developed in Late Antiquity is emphatically monotheistic. However, its predecessor—the various schools of Hellenistic Judaism and Second Temple Judaism, and especially the cult of Yahweh as it was practiced in ancient Israel and Judah during the 8th and 7th centuries BC—have been described as henotheistic.\n\nFor example, the Moabites worshipped the god Chemosh, the Edomites, Qaus, both of whom were part of the greater Canaanite pantheon, headed by the chief god, El. The Canaanite pantheon consisted of El and Asherah as the chief deities, with 70 sons who were said to rule over each of the nations of the earth. These sons were each worshiped within a specific region. Kurt Noll states that \"the Bible preserves a tradition that Yahweh used to 'live' in the south, in the land of Edom\" and that the original god of Israel was El Shaddai.\n\nSeveral Biblical stories allude to the belief that the Canaanite gods all existed and were thought to possess the most power in the lands by the people who worshiped them and their sacred objects; their power was believed to be real and could be invoked by the people who patronized them. There are numerous accounts of surrounding nations of Israel showing fear or reverence for the Israelite God despite their continued polytheistic practices. For instance, in 1 Samuel 4, the Philistines fret before the second battle of Aphek when they learn that the Israelites are bearing the Ark of the Covenant, and therefore Yahweh, into battle. The Israelites were forbidden to worship other deities, but according to some interpretations of the Bible, they were not fully monotheistic before the Babylonian captivity. Mark S. Smith refers to this stage as a form of monolatry. Smith argues that Yahweh underwent a process of merging with El and that acceptance of cults of Asherah was common in the period of the Judges. 2 Kings 3:27 has been interpreted as describing a human sacrifice in Moab that led the invading Israelite army to fear the power of Chemosh.\n\nSome scholars have written that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) can be characterized as henotheistic, but others have rejected this stance.\n\nEugene England, a professor at Brigham Young University, asserted that LDS Presidents Brigham Young and Joseph Fielding Smith along with LDS scholar B. H. Roberts used the LDS interpretation of 1 Corinthians 8:5–6 as \"a brief explanation of how it is possible to be both a Christian polytheist (technically a henotheist) and a monotheist\". BYU Professor Roger R. Keller rejected descriptions of the LDS Church as polytheistic by countering, as summarized by a reviewer, \"Mormons are fundamentally monotheistic because they deal with only one god out of the many which exist.\"\n\nIn their book, \"Mormon America: The Power and the Promise\", Richard and Joan Ostling, wrote that some Mormons are comfortable describing themselves as henotheists.\n\nKurt Widmer, professor at the University of Lethbridge, described LDS beliefs as a \"cosmic henotheism\". A review of Widmer's book by Bruening and Paulsen in the \"FARMS Review of Books\" countered that Widmer's hypothesis was \"strongly disconfirmed in light of the total evidence\".\n\nVan Hale has written, \"Mormonism teaches the existence of gods who are not the Father, Son, or Holy Ghost\" and \"the existence of more than one god [is] clearly a Mormon doctrine\", but he also said that defining this belief system in theological terms was troublesome. Henotheism might appear to be \"promising\" in describing LDS beliefs, Hale wrote, but it is ultimately not accurate because henotheism was intended to describe the worship of a god that was restricted to a specific geographical area.\n\n"}
{"id": "10794838", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10794838", "title": "Hermeneutic circle", "text": "Hermeneutic circle\n\nThe hermeneutic circle () describes the process of understanding a text hermeneutically. It refers to the idea that one's understanding of the text as a whole is established by reference to the individual parts and one's understanding of each individual part by reference to the whole. Neither the whole text nor any individual part can be understood without reference to one another, and hence, it is a circle. However, this circular character of interpretation does not make it impossible to interpret a text; rather, it stresses that the meaning of a text must be found within its cultural, historical, and literary context.\n\nFriedrich Schleiermacher's approach to interpretation focuses on the importance of the interpreter \"understanding\" the text as a necessary stage to interpreting it. Understanding involved repeated circular movements between the parts and the whole. Hence the idea of an interpretive or hermeneutic \"circle.\" Understanding the meaning of a text is not about decoding the author's intentions. It is about establishing real relationships between reader, text, and context.\" Even reading a sentence involves these repeated circular movements through a hierarchy of parts–whole relationships. Thus, as we are reading this sentence, you are analysing single words as the text unfolds, but you are also weighing the meaning of each word against our changing sense of the overall meaning of the sentence you are reading, or perhaps misunderstanding, or maybe this sentence is reminding you of, or clashing with, another view about interpretation you have, in the past, advocated or disparaged. Hence we are brought to the sentence's larger historical context, depending on its location, and our own circumstances.\n\nWilhelm Dilthey used the example of understanding a sentence as an example of the circular course of hermeneutic understanding. He particularly stressed that meaning and meaningfulness were always contextual. Thus the meaning of any sentence cannot be fully interpreted unless we know the historical circumstances of its utterance. And this means that interpretation is always linked to the situation of the interpreter, because one can only construct a history from the particular set of circumstances in which one currently exists. Thus Dilthey says: \"Meaningfulness fundamentally grows out of a relation of part to whole that is grounded in the nature of living experience.\" For Dilthey, \"Meaning is not subjective; it is not projection of thought or thinking onto the object; it is a perception of a real relationship within a nexus prior to the subject-object separation in thought.\"\n\nMartin Heidegger (1927) developed the concept of the \"hermeneutic circle\" to envision a whole in terms of a reality that was situated in the detailed experience of everyday existence by an individual (the parts). So understanding was developed on the basis of \"fore-structures\" of understanding, that allow external phenomena to be interpreted in a preliminary way.\n\nAnother instance of Heidegger's use of the hermeneutic circle occurs in his examination of \"The Origin of the Work of Art\" (1935–1936). Here Heidegger argues that both artists and art works can only be understood with reference to each other, and that neither can be understood apart from 'art,' which, as well, cannot be understood apart from the former two. The 'origin' of the work of art is mysterious and elusive, seemingly defying logic: \"thus we are compelled to follow the circle. This is neither a makeshift or a defect. To enter upon the path is the strength of thought, to continue on it is the feast of thought, assuming thinking is a craft. Not only is the main step from work to art a circle like the step from art to work, but every separate step that we attempt circles this circle. In order to discover the nature of the art that really prevails in the work, let us go to the actual work and ask the work what and how it is.\"\n\nHeidegger continues, saying that a work of art is not a simple thing (as a doorknob or a shoe is, which do not normally involve aesthetic experience), but it cannot escape its \"thingly character,\" that is, being part of the larger order of things in the world, apart from all aesthetic experience. The synthesis of thingly and artistic is found in the work's allegorical and symbolic character, \"but this one element in a work that manifests another, this one element that joins another, is the thingly feature in the art work\". At this point, however, Heidegger raises the doubt of \"whether the work is at bottom something else and not a thing at all.\" Later he tries to break down the metaphysical opposition between form and matter, and the whole other set of dualisms which include: rational and irrational, logical and illogical/alogical, and subject and object. Neither of these concepts is independent of the other, yet neither can be reduced to the other: Heidegger suggests we have to look beyond both.\n\nHans-Georg Gadamer (1975) further developed this concept, leading to what is recognized as a break with previous hermeneutic traditions. While Heidegger saw the hermeneutic process as cycles of self-reference that situated our understanding in \"a priori\" prejudices, Gadamer reconceptualized the hermeneutic circle as an iterative process through which a new understanding of a whole reality is developed by means of exploring the detail of existence. Gadamer viewed understanding as linguistically mediated, through conversations with others in which reality is explored and an agreement is reached that represents a new understanding. The centrality of conversation to the hermeneutic circle is developed by Donald Schön, who characterizes design as a hermeneutic circle that is developed by means of \"a conversation with the situation.\"\n\nPaul de Man, in his essay \"Form and Intent in the American New Criticism,\" talks about the hermeneutic circle with reference to paradoxical ideas about \"textual unity\" espoused by and inherited from American criticism. De Man points out that the \"textual unity\" New Criticism locates in a given work has only a \"semi-circularity\" and that the hermeneutic circle is completed in \"the act of interpreting the text.\" Combining Gadamer and Heidegger into an epistemological critique of interpretation and reading, de Man argues that with New Criticism, American Criticism \"pragmatically entered\" the hermeneutic circle, \"mistaking it for the organic circularity of natural processes.\"\n\nFor postmodernists, the hermeneutic circle is especially problematic. Not only do they believe one can only know the world through the words one uses to describe it, but also that \"whenever people try to establish a certain reading of a text or expression, they allege other readings as the ground for their reading\". For postmodernists, in other words, \"All meaning systems are open-ended systems of signs referring to signs referring to signs. No concept can therefore have an ultimate, unequivocal meaning\".\n\nJudith N. Shklar (1986) points out the ambiguity in the meaning and function of the \"circle\" as a metaphor for understanding. It is taken to refer to a geometric circle, rather than a circular process, it seems to imply a center, but it is unclear whether the interpreter him/herself stands there, or whether, on the contrary, some \"organizing principle and illuminating principle apart from him [is] there waiting to be discovered.\" Furthermore, and more problematic for Shklar, \"the hermeneutic circle makes sense only if there is a known and closed whole, which can be understood in terms of its own parts and which has as its core God, who is its anchor and creator. Only the Bible really meets these conditions. It is the only possibly wholly self-sufficient text.\" A further problem relates to the fact that Gadamer and others assume a fixed role for tradition (individual and disciplinary/academic) in the process of any hermeneutic understanding, while it is more accurate to say that interpreters have multiple and sometimes conflicting cultural attachments, yet this does not prevent intercultural and/or interdisciplinary dialogue. Finally, she warns that, at least in social science, interpretation is not a substitute for explanation.\n\nHeidegger (1935–1936) and Schockel (1998) respond to critics of this model of interpretation who allege it is a case of invalid reasoning by asserting that \"any\" form of reflection or interpretation must oscillate between particular and general, part and whole. It does not 'beg the question' because it is a different approach than formal logic. While it does imply presuppositions, it does not take any premise for granted. Schokel suggests a spiral as a better metaphor for interpretation, but admits that Schleiermacher's influence may have 'acclimatized' the term.\n\n\n\n"}

Created by Pascal Gemperli and Uri Ziegele in 2007, the organization focuses on promoting conflict transformation and peacebuilding through peace mediation courses and trainings. Its comprehensive approach is based on interdisciplinary practice and research in the areas of international peace and conflict research, critical systems theory, culture and communication studies, political psychology, group psychotherapy and other related fields. The ICP has offices in both Bern and Morges (Switzerland). It is accredited ECOSOC and certified EDUQUA. It is active in the following countries: Switzerland, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Morocco, Azerbaijan and Armenia.\n\nThe ICP offers mediation services on the one hand, and organizes peace mediation trainings and workshops on the other hand. Hence it is active both in mediation and in the promotion of peacebuilding through education, in Switzerland and abroad.\n\nThe ICP holds a Konfliktbüro (conflict office) in Bern. The office proposes mediation services to enterprises, institutions and administrations as well as to individuals. The advanced training Die Kunst der Konfliktbearbeitung (The Art of Conflict Transformation) is recognized by the Swiss Federation for Mediation Associations (SDM-FSM) and organized in partnership with the University of Basel.\n\nEvery summer since 2008, the ICP organizes the International Summer Academy and Forum on Peace Mediation and National Dialogue, which is a mediation and peacebuilding training taking place in Caux (Montreux, Switzerland). This one-week course allows participants to attend classes about peace mediation and to take advantage of the skills and knowledge of international experts in the field. Participants also acquire practical skills through peace mediation simulations. Each year, the focus of the course changes slightly: new topics are introduced and other perspectives presented. Participants in the Summer Academy can also decide to attend the International Peace-builders' Forum, which takes place in Caux, usually just before the beginning of the Summer Academy.\n\nThe Institute for Conflict Transformation and Peacebuilding is jointly involved with the Universities of Basel, Belgrade, Sarajevo and Zagreb in the creation of a regional Master in Peace Studies in South-East Europe \n\n"}

His main fields of research are the philosophy of language, epistemology, and the history of philosophy in Poland.\n\nJan Woleński was born in Radom, Poland on 21 September 1940. His first interest was law and he began studies at Jagiellonian University in 1958. Soon philosophy drew his attention and by 1963 he was employed in the Department of State and Law as an assistant professor. He looked to analytical jurisprudence in the United Kingdom, and with the guidance of Professor Kazimierz Opalek, in 1968 he produced his thesis. Continuing his ascent, he produced a Habilitation in 1972: \"Problems in the Interpretations of Law\". In 1974 he straddled two positions: the Institute of Social Sciences at the Academy of Mining and Metallurgy, and lecturer on philosophy of science at the Institute of Philosophy at Jagiellonian University.\n\nWroclaw Polytechnic called him to teach in their Institute of Social Sciences in 1979. As an opponent of the state socialism governing Poland, Woleński edited an underground bulletin \"Riposte\". Though he was appointed director of the Institute, he was removed after four months for his resistance. The journal Studia Logica engaged him as editor from 1987 to 1993. It was in 1988 that he gained appointment to the Institute of Philosophy at his alma mater. He became \"professor ordinarius\" in 1990 and chair of the Department of Epistemology in 1994.\n\nOther editing positions include Synthese from 1990, The Monist from 1993, \"Studies in Eastern European Thought\" from 1993, \"Axiomathes\" from 1992, and the \"Synthese Library\" of Kluwer Academic. Woleński was president of the Polish Society of Logic and Philosophy of Science (1999 to 2002). \"Jan Woleński has achieved success as a teacher and advisor, encompassing the supervision of fourteen doctoral dissertations. Among his graduates are professors of philosophy as well as of law.\"\n\nHe is on the consulting board of the philosophy journal, \"Theoria\".\n\nInstitute Vienna Circle held a conference in 1997 on the Austro-Polish connections in logical empiricism. Woleński described the semantic theory of truth in his introductory essay, \"Sematic Revolution – Rudolf Carnap, Kurt Gödel, Alfred Tarski\". It was followed by a score of contributions from philosophers. Working with Eckehart Köhler, Wolenski edited the papers and the collection was published as \"Alfred Tarski and the Vienna Circle\".\n\nIn 2013 Woleński was awarded the Prize of the Foundation for Polish Science for a comprehensive analysis of the work of the Lwów-Warsaw school and for placing its achievements within the context of international discourse in contemporary philosophy.\n\nWoleński was a plenary speaker at the second world congress on religion and logic held in Warsaw, June 18 to 22, 2017. He has continued academic involvement at the University of Information Technology and Management in Rzeszów Poland.\n\nWoleński is active in Poland's atheist movement. In the 1960s he was a member of the government-sponsored Association of Atheists and Freethinkers, and since 2007 he is a member of the Honorary Committee of the Polish Rationalist Association. He is widely recognized in Poland as an atheist and has promoted the replacement of religion classes with philosophy classes in Polish schools.\n\nWoleński is involved in the secular Jewish movement, writing on the common Polish-Jewish past and on today's Polish-Jewish relations.

{"id": "1392358", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1392358", "title": "Khidr", "text": "Khidr\n\nKhidr or al-Khidr ( \"al-Khiḍr\"; also transcribed as al-Khadir, Khader/Khadr, Khidr, Khedher, Khizr, Khizir, Khyzer, Qeezr, Qhezr, Qhizyer, Qhezar, Khizar, Xızır, Hızır) is a name ascribed to a figure in the Quran as a righteous servant of God possessing great wisdom or mystic knowledge. In various Islamic and non-Islamic traditions, Khidr is described as a messenger, prophet, wali, slave and angel, who guards the sea, teaches secret knowledge and aids those in distress. The figure of al-Khidr has been syncretized over time with various other figures including but not limited to Sorūsh in Iran, Saint Sarkis the Warrior, Saint George in Asia Minor and the Levant, and John the Baptist in Armenia.\n\nBecause of the linguistic similarities and shared etymology between the name \"al-Khiḍr\" and the Arabic word for green (\"al-akhḍar\" or \"al-khaḍra\" as in \"Gubbat al-khaḍra\" or the Green Dome), and the fact that the name \"al-Khiḍr\" shares exactly the same triliteral root as the word \"al-khaḍra\" - a root found in multiple Semitic languages meaning \"green\" or \"verdant\", the meaning of the name has traditionally usually been taken colloquially and academically to be \"the Green One\" or \"the Verdant One.\" Some contemporary scholars have disagreed with this assessment, however some others point to a possible reference to the Mesopotamian figure Utnapishtum from the Epic of Gilgamesh through the Arabization of his nickname, \"Hasisatra\". According to one recent view the name Khidr is not an Arabic variant or an abbreviation of Hasisatra, it directly comes from the name of the Canaanite god Kothar-wa-Khasis and it may be later assimilated to Arabic term \"al-akhḍar\".\n\nIn Sura 18, ayat (verses) 65–82 \"Al Kahf\", Moses meets the Servant of God, referred in the Quran as \"one of our slaves whom We had granted mercy from Us and whom We had taught knowledge from Ourselves\". Muslim scholars identify him as Nabi Khadra, although he is not explicitly named in the Quran and there is no reference to him being immortal or being especially associated with esoteric knowledge or fertility. These associations come in later scholarship on al-Khiḍr.\n\nThe Quran states that they meet at the junction of the two seas (which can be a river-tributary) and Moses asks for permission to accompany the Servant of God so Moses can learn \"right knowledge of what [he has] been taught\". The Servant informs him in a stern manner that their knowledge is of different nature and that \"Surely you [Moses] cannot have patience with me. And how canst thou have patience about things about which thy understanding is not complete?\" Moses promises to be patient and obey him unquestioningly, and they set out together. After they board a ship, the Servant of God damages the vessel. Forgetting his oath, Moses says, \"Have you made a hole in it to drown its inmates? Certainly you have done a grievous thing.\" The Servant reminds Moses of his warning, \"Did I not say that you will not be able to have patience with me?\" and Moses pleads not to be rebuked.\n\nNext, the Servant of God kills a young man. Moses again cries out in astonishment and dismay, and again the Servant reminds Moses of his warning, and Moses promises that he will not violate his oath again, and that if he does he will excuse himself from the Servant's presence. They then proceed to a town where they are denied hospitality. This time, instead of harming anyone or anything, the Servant of God restores a decrepit wall in the village. Yet again Moses is amazed and violates his oath for the third and last time, asking why the Servant did not at least exact \"some recompense for it.\"\n\nThe Servant of God replies, \"This shall be separation between me and you; now I will inform you of the significance of that with which you could not have patience. Many acts which seem to be evil, malicious or somber, actually are merciful. The boat was damaged to prevent its owners from falling into the hands of a king who seized every boat by force. And as for the boy, his parents were believers and we feared lest he should make disobedience and ingratitude to come upon them. God will replace the child with one better in purity, affection and obedience. As for the restored wall, the Servant explained that underneath the wall was a treasure belonging to two helpless orphans whose father was a righteous man. As God's envoy, the Servant restored the wall, showing God's kindness by rewarding the piety of the orphans' father, and so that when the wall becomes weak again and collapses, the orphans will be older and stronger and will take the treasure that belongs to them.\"\n\nAmong the strongest transmitted proofs about the life of al-Khiḍr are two reports, one narrated by Ahmad ibn Hanbal in \"Al-Zuhd\" whereby Muhammad is said to have stated that Elijah and al-Khiḍr meet every year and spend the month of Ramadan in Jerusalem and the other narrated by Ya'qub ibn Sufyan from Umar II whereby a man he was seen walking with was actually al-Khiḍr. Ibn Hajar declared the claim of the first fair and that of the second sound in \"Fath al-Bari\" (1959 ed. 6:435). He goes on to cite another sound report narrated by Ibn 'Asakir from Abu Zur’a al-Razi whereby the latter met al-Khiḍr twice, once in his youth, the other in old age, but al-Khiḍr himself had not changed.\nIslamic scholar Bediuzzaman Said Nursi also contends that Khidr is alive, but that there are five degrees of life; Khidr is\nat the second degree of life, thus some religious scholars have been doubtful about it. Khidr and Ilyas (May God grant them peace), are free to an extent. That is to say, they can be present in numerous places at the same time. They are not permanently restricted by the requirements of humanity like us. They can eat and drink like us when they want to, but are not compelled to be like we are. The saints are those who uncover and witness the realities of creation, and the reports of their adventures with Khidr are unanimous and elucidate and point to this level of life. There is even one degree of sainthood which is called 'the degree of Khidr.' A saint who reaches this degree receives instruction from Khidr and meets with him. But sometimes the one at that degree is mistaken to be Khidr himself.\n\nal-Khiḍr is believed to be a man who has the appearance of a young adult but a long, white beard. According to some authors like Abdul Haq Vidhyarthi, al-Khiḍr is Xerxes (a 6th-century Sasanian prince, not to be confused with Xerxes I), who disappeared after being in the lake regions of Sistan that comprise the wetlands of the Irano-Afghan border today, and after finding the fountain of life, sought to live his entire remaining life in service of God and to help those in their path/journey to Him.\n\nMuhammad al-Bukhari reports that al-Khiḍr got his name after he was present over the surface of some ground that became green as a result of his presence there. There are reports from al-Bayhaqi that al-Khiḍr was present at the funeral of Muhammad and was recognized only by Ali from amongst the rest of the companions, and where he came to show his grief and sadness at the death of Muhammad. Al-Khiḍr's appearance at Muhammad's funeral is related as follows: \"A powerful-looking, fine-featured, handsome man with a white beard came leaping over the backs of the people till he reached where the sacred body lay. Weeping bitterly, he turned toward the Companions and paid his condolences. Ali said that he was Khiḍr\".\n\nIn another narration al-Khiḍr met with Ali by the Kaaba and instructed him about a supplication that is very meritorious when recited after the obligatory prayers. It is reported by Imam Muslim that during the time when the false Messiah appears and as he approaches at the outskirts of the city of Medina, a believer would challenge him, whom the false Messiah will slice into two piece and rejoin, making it appear that he caused him to die and be resurrected, to which this man would proclaim the falsehood of the Dajjal who would try again to kill him (or make show of it) but would fail and thus his weakness and inability being made revealed. According to the commentators and transmitters of this narration the person who will challenge the Antichrist and humiliate him will be al-Khiḍr.\n\nJa'far al-Sadiq narrates in Kitab al-Kafi that after entering the sacred Mosque in Mecca, Ali, Hasan ibn Ali, and Husayn ibn Ali were visited by a good looking, well dressed man who asked them a series of questions. Hasan answered the questions and upon this, the man testified to the prophet-hood of Muhammad followed by testifying that Ali and his Ahl al-Bayt are the successors and heir to his message. Ali asked Hasan to track the whereabouts of the visitor, but when he could not, Ali revealed the identity of the man to be Khidr. .\n\nMany Shia Muslims believe al-Khiḍr accompanied the Mahdi, in meeting one Sheikh Hassan ibn Muthlih Jamkarani, on 22 February 984 CE (17 Ramadan 373 A.H.) and instructing him to build a mosque at that site of their meeting, known as Jamkaran. The site, six kilometers east of Qom, Iran, has been a pilgrimage destination for the Shia for some time. In the last few years, however, it has become very popular, particularly with young people, and drawn crowds of tens of thousands.\n\nIn Ismailism, al-Khiḍr is considered as one of the 'permanent Imams'; that is, those who have guided people throughout history.\n\nTo Sufis, al-Khiḍr holds a distinguished position. Although amongst the Sunni scholars there is a difference of opinion about him being still alive, amongst Sunni Sufis there is almost a consensus that al-Khiḍr is still alive, with many respected figures and shaykhs, and prominent leaders claiming having had personal encounters with him. Examples of those who have claimed this are Abdul-Qadir Gilani, al-Nawawi, Ibn Arabi, Sidi Abdul Aziz ad-Dabbagh and Ahmad ibn Idris al-Fasi. Ibn Ata Allah's \"Lata'if al-Minan\" (1:84-98) states that there is consensus among the Sufis that al-Khiḍr is alive. In fact there are orders that claim origin with al-Khiḍr himself, or that al-Khiḍr was part of their chain, for example some of the Naqshbandi Haqqani Sufi Order, the Muhammadiyah, the Idrisiyya, and the Senussi are tariqat that had al-Khiḍr as one of the central figures connecting them to the spiritual outflow of Muhammad.\n\nIn Sufi tradition, al-Khiḍr has come to be known as one of those who receive illumination direct from God without human mediation. He is the hidden initiator of those who walk the mystical path, like some of those from the Uwaisi tariqa. Uwaisis are those who enter the mystical path without being initiated by a living master. Instead they begin their mystical journey either by following the guiding light of the teachings of the earlier masters or by being initiated by the mysterious prophet-saint al-Khiḍr.\n\nAl-Khiḍr has had thus gained enormous reputation and popularity in the Sufi tradition due to his role as an initiator. Through this way come several Sufi orders which claim initiation through al-Khiḍr and consider him their master. Al-Khiḍr had thus come to symbolize access to the divine mystery (\"ghayb\") itself. In the writings of Abd al-Karim al-Jili, al-Khiḍr rules over ‘the Men of the Unseen' (\"rijalu’l-ghayb\")— the exalted saints and angels. Al-Khiḍr is also included among what in classical Sufism are called the ‘’abdāl’’ (‘those who take turns’). In Sufi hierarchy, ‘’abdāl’’ is a mysterious rank. It is thought in Sufism that God decides who will be abdal for a decade before an abdal is born. Adbals are thought as the gainers of mysterious power that is knowing the future also called Ilm-e-ladunni. They are deployed to protect Islam from some unwanted evil activities that threaten the existence of Islam. In a divinely-instituted hierarchy of such saints, al-Khiḍr holds the rank of their spiritual head.\n\nThe Sri Lankan Sufi Bawa Muhaiyaddeen gives a unique account of al-Khiḍr. Al-Khiḍr was on a long search for God, until God, out of his mercy, sends the Archangel Gabriel to guide him. Gabriel appears to al-Khiḍr as a wise human sage, and al-Khiḍr accepts him as his teacher. Gabriel teaches al-Khiḍr much in the same way as al-Khiḍr later teaches Moses in the Quran, by carrying out seemingly unjust actions. Al-Khiḍr repeatedly breaks his oath not to speak out against Gabriel's actions, and is still unaware that the human teacher is actually Gabriel. Gabriel then explains his actions, and reveals his true angelic form to al-Khiḍr. Al-Khiḍr recognises him as the Archangel Gabriel, and then Gabriel bestows a spiritual title upon al-Khiḍr, by calling him \"Hayat Nabi\", the Eternal Life Prophet.\n\nThe French scholar of Sufism, Henry Corbin, interprets al-Khiḍr as the mysterious prophet, the eternal wanderer. The function of al-Khiḍr as a 'person-archetype' is to reveal each disciple to himself, to lead each disciple to his own theophany, because that theophany corresponds to his own 'inner heaven,' to the form of his own being, to his eternal individuality. Accordingly, al-Khiḍr is Moses' spiritual guide, who initiates Moses into the divine sciences, and reveals to him the secret mystic truth.\n\nAhmadiyya identifies al-Khiḍr to be the symbolic representation of Muhammad himself. Ahmadis believe that the Quranic passage of Moses’ encounter with the \"Servant of God\" is closely linked, contextually to the subject matter of surah Al Kahf in which his story or parable is cited. According to Ahmadi exegesis on al-Kahf, which draws upon external and internal, religious and historical evidence to show that Moses' journey towards, and his experience with the \"servant of God\" was not physical but by way of vision, similar to the Mi'raj (ascension) of Muhammad.\n\nThe righteous 'servant of God' otherwise known as al-Khiḍr is not believed to be a historical figure but rather a symbolic figure who signifies the person of Muhammad whom Moses had desired to see and whom he saw in this vision. Muhammad has been called the 'servant of God' in many places within the Quran and is believed to be the servant of God par excellence who has been called a mercy to the whole world; he is also believed to have been vouchsafed divine knowledge in a very large measure.\n\nThe place of the meeting of the two seas signifies the time when the Mosaic dispensation meets the Islamic dispensation, i.e. when the Judaic dispensation will be superseded by the Islamic one.\n\nThen Moses and the \"servant of God\" approach a town, ask its people for food and are refused to be accepted as guests. This signifies that both Moses and Muhammad would seek co-operation from Jews and Christians but it would be denied. The two orphan boys to whom the wall belonged are Moses and Jesus and their 'righteous' father is Abraham. Their treasure was the true teaching bequeathed by them to their peoples, which was in danger of being lost due to the latter's irreligiousness. Thus the third act of the 'servant of God' (Muhammad) of rebuilding the wall signifies that the treasure or true teachings were to be safeguarded in the Quran, so that they (the people of Moses and Jesus) may accept it after having awakened to a realization of the truth of the Quranic teachings.\n\nThere are many figures in Iran whose place Khidr took by the Islamization process. One of them is paradoxically a female figure Anahita. The most popular shrine in Yazd is dedicated to Anahita. Among the Zoroastrians, for the pilgrims to Yazd, the most important of the six \"pir\"s is \"Pir-e Sabz\". It is still a functional temple and the holiest site for present-day Zoroastrians living in Iran. \n\nEach year from 14–18 June, many thousands of Zoroastrians from Iran, India and other countries make a pilgrimage to Yazd in Iran to worship at a hillside grotto containing the sacred spring dedicated to \"Pir e Sabz\". Here the worshippers pray for the fertilising rain and celebrate the greening of nature and the renewal of life. It generally refers to the sacred meal made from wheat, barley or lentil sprouts ceremoniously consumed in honour of Pir e Sabz.\n\nIn Persian the term \"sabz\" means 'green' and \"pir\" means 'shrine' among the Zoroastrians of Iran. The name of the shrine derives from the greenness of the foliage growing around the sanctuary. It is actually known \"Pir-e Sabz Banu\" 'the old woman in the mountain' or \"Chek Chek\", but also \"Pir-e Sabz\" 'the green saint'. Because \"pir\" means also 'elder' in Persian. As Babayan says, \"Khizr is related to the Zoroastrian water goddess Anahita, and some of her former sanctuaries in Iran were rededicated to him (Pir-e Sabz)\".\n\nPersian scholar, historian and exegete of the Qur'an Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari, writes about Khidr in a chapter of his \"The History of al-Tabari\", called \"The Tale of al-Khiḍr and His History; and the History of Moses and His Servant Joshua.\" Al-Tabari describes several versions of the traditional story surrounding al-Khiḍr. At the beginning of the chapter, al-Tabari explains that in some variations, al-Khiḍr is a contemporary of the mythical Persian king Afridun, who was a contemporary of Abraham, and lived before the days of Moses. Al-Khiḍr is also said to have been appointed to be over the vanguard of the king Dhul-Qarnayn the Elder, who in this version is identified as the king Afridun. In this specific version, al-Khiḍr comes across the River of Life and, unaware of its properties, drinks from it and becomes immortal. Al-Tabari also recounts that al-Khiḍr is said to have been the son of a man who believed in Abraham, and who emigrated with Abraham when he left Babylon.\n\nAl-Khiḍr is also commonly associated with Elijah, even equated with him, and al-Tabari makes a distinction in the next account in which al-Khiḍr is Persian and Elijah is an Israelite. According to this version of al-Khiḍr's story, al-Khiḍr and Elijah meet every year during the annual festival season.\n\nAl-Tabari seems more inclined to believe that al-Khiḍr lived during the time of Afridun before Moses, rather than traveled as Abraham's companion and drank the water of life. He does not state clearly why he has this preference, but rather seems to prefer the chain of sources (the \"isnad\") of the former story rather than the latter.\n\nThe various versions in al-Tabari's \"History\" more or less parallel each other and the account in the Quran. However, in the stories al-Tabari recounts, Moses claims to be the most knowledgeable man on earth, and God corrects him by telling him to seek out al-Khiḍr. Moses is told to bring a salted fish, and once he found the fish to be missing, he would then find al-Khiḍr. Moses sets out with a travel companion, and once they reach a certain rock, the fish comes to life, jumps into the water, and swims away. It is at this point that Moses and his companion meet al-Khiḍr.\n\nAl-Tabari also adds to lore surrounding the origins of al-Khiḍr's name. He refers to a saying of Muhammad that al-Khiḍr (\"the Green\" or \"the Verdant\") was named because he sat on a white fur and it shimmered green with him.\n\nA contemporary hypothesis on Khidr's prototype compares him with the Ugaritic god Kothar-wa-Khasis. First of all, both figures possess wisdom and secret knowledge. According to the Quran, \"Khidr\" (although not named directly) has a special wisdom and esoteric knowledge (hikmah and ilm al-ladun). Kothar has also special wisdom and his name means \"Skillful and Wise\" or \"Adroit and Perceptive\" or \"Deft and Clever\". Hasisu means wisdom, intelligence in Babylonian, also in some ancient Near Eastern languages. Not only his name, but according to some scholars Kothar's epithet hyn also means wise or clever (Syrian \"hawna\": intelligence or ability). Kothar is a craftsman god and almost all blacksmiths and craftsmen are wise, clever and skillful figures in the mythology. Because people believed that they have some secret powers and wisdom to work metals; for example in Greek epic, Hephaistos is praised not only for his craftsmanship, but with intellectual epithets appropriate to Odysseus. He is described as \"klytomētis\" (renowned for mind) and \"klytotechnēs\" (renowned for skill) by Homeros. Blacksmiths and craftsmen played a central role in ancient society. They made many tools that people needed, from agricultural tools like the reaping-hook (the sickle or scythe) to weapons like arrows, spears, axes and swords. They made musical instruments, too. Therefore, the metalworkers or craftsmen were considered the lords of many social inventions like agriculture, music, writing, fire, etc. As a direct result of their social status, they were seen as wise, intelligent figures in mythology, Kothar too.\n\nSecondly, Kothar and Khidr are dragon slayers or they help some figures to kill a dragon. Kothar helps Baal to kill Yam-Nahar by making weapons for him. Khidr helps Sufis or \"wali's\" like Sarı Saltuk to struggle with a dragon. According to some other stories he plays a central role, not that of a helper, and slays the dragon himself. For example, the people who live in Antakya (\"Turkey\") tell a story about this feature of Khidr and it originates from the story of Baal and Yam Nahar. Strabo tells the same story, but his characters are different; Zeus and Typhon. Another one which mentioned Khidr himself as a dragon slayer, quoted by Flemish ambassador Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq (16th century). In some regions, especially in the frontiers of Asia Minor, Khidr is seen as a dragon slayer, because he took the place of Saint George or other warrior saints like Saint Theodore (Theodore of Amasea) who fights against the dragons. However, it can't be explained only by this continuity. The myth of the dragon slayer was very popular in the ancient Near East and the divine smiths were usually assistant figures to make weapons for the chief gods of this mythological scenario, but they were also seen as a dragon slayer in some myths. In Kurdish mythology Kaveh the blacksmith (\"Kawa\") kills an evil king Zahhak who was only a personification of the Avestan dragon Azhi Dahaka. According to a Scottish tale, from another side of the world, the blacksmith of Kirkcudbright defeated the White Snake of Mote Hill. Moreover, Kothar has fought against Behemoth and some other monstrous beings in Ugaritic mythology. A Ugaritic text tells it: \"In the sea are Arshu and the dragon, May Kothar and Hasis drive (them) away, May Kothar-and-Hasis cut (them) off\".\n\nKothar and Khidr are known as \"sailor\" figures who are symbolically associated with sea, lake and rivers. Chusor is an inventor of the boat and he saves sailors. It believed that he was the first voyager on a boat. Khidr helps people when they need help and the most of these dangerous conditions are about seas, lakes and rivers, etc. For example, he sometimes helps children when they are drowning in the water or he helps boatmen during stormy weather. The Alevi Kurds of Dersim saw him as a savior and describe him as a \"sovereign of the seas\". He is a patron \"saint\" of the rivers in India. This characteristic feature of Khidr is not only from new syncretisms, it is basically connected with Kothar's characteristic features. Because Chusor (\"Kothar\") was inventor of the boat and sailors believe that he protects them when they voyage. One of his epithets was bn ym (son of the sea). Khidr often has some characteristics of a sailor, even in cultural areas which are not directly linked to the sea, like mountainous Dersim. It may be evident that Khidr originally comes from the culture of a people who inhabited the seashore. He has transformed to a wanderer by the cultural effects of darwishs and wanderer Sufis.\n\nAbove their all characteristics, the status of Kothar can't be denied to show this continuity. Kothar is an assistant or \"\"a servant god\" in Ugaritic mythology. He helps Baal and builds a palace for him, but he is actually a \"servant of supreme god EL\". Thus, he is accepted as one of the divine servants in Ugarit, because Keret, son of El, is also called a \"servant of El\"\". According to the Quran, Khidr is \"a servant of Allah\" ('abd min 'ibādinā). Besides, the names of \"Allah\" and \"El\" are very similar to each other. It is known that they come from a common root. By the similar or common elements, it can be seen as part of their continuity.\n\nKothar and Khidr bring fertility. Kothar controls and customizes the seasons. Like some craftsmen or blacksmiths, Kothar is associated with agriculture. Among the Dogon people of Mali the heavenly smith has a role of civilizing hero; he brings down grain from heaven and reveals agriculture to mankind. In the Bible Cain (meaning perhaps \"smith\") was a farmer and 'blacksmith', although he was not the inventor of agriculture. The Welsh smith \"Govannon \"had agricultural powers as well, for it was he who cleaned the plows at the end of planting, to ensure that the tools abundance would serve another year. Evidently, Kothar's profession, which is associated with agriculture among some cultures, has a good reason for him to get a new position in time. Some peoples of the Levant, especially the people of ancient Cyprus, believed that Kautar (that is Kothar) was father of Tamoza/Tammuz (deity), the god of fertility. Thus, Khidr became a special figure of new syncretisms in late periods. Because Kautar (later Khidr) and his son Tamoza (Adonis) have been compared with Ali and his son Hussein (Husayn). In some contexts they identified with each other. Khidr and Ali have almost the same position in Islamic mystic thought and some Shiite beliefs and they can take the place of each other. In some contexts Khidr is identified with Husayn, sometimes with the last imam or Mahdi. The mythological scene show very strong syncretisms. It can be described like this: El (deity) and his son Baal, Kautar (Kothar) and his son Tamoza (\"Adonis\"), Ali and his son Hussein. The names of El (deity) and Ali are similar to each other and it was an onomastic invitation for some new beliefs about Ali, Husayn and Khidr. There are many other connection points like their abodes. El's abode is at the source of two rivers. According to the Quran \"Khidr\"s abode is majma-ul bahrayn; that is, the junction of two seas. In ancient texts El's abode is described as \"the stream of two seas\". Kothar constructs a house from Lebanon trees for El and then burns a fire in the house for seven days. After the fire has transformed and refined the form of the palace, it is mimetically identical with its archetype on the axis mundi, where El resides. Majma-ul bahrayn is also on \"axis mundi\" and may be therefore some scholars like Du Buission pointed to parallelism between El's abode and \"majma-ul bahrayn\". Arabic \"al-Kawthar\", which means a river of the paradise, is etymologically connected with the name of the Ugaritic divine craftsman, Kothar. Moreover like Ea and El, Kothar's dwelling is also associated with waters.\n\nKothar was the lord of wise words and good speech. According to Phoenician tradition, Kothar was also inventor of magical incantations; in addition, he was believed to have been the first poet. He is a soothsayer and magician, creating sacred words and spells, in part because there is an association in many cultures of metalworking deities with magic. Sanchuniathon says that Chusor invented the art of composing chants and incantations. In Ugaritic texts kotharat means singer women. In mythology the blacksmiths and craftsmen play an important role as a poet, musician and magician. The same associations are to be found among the Turco-Tartars and Mongols, where the smith is linked with heroes, singers and poets. Like them, Khidr teaches a kind of dhikr (Arabischذکر; \"\"remembrance\" (of God)\", \"\"pronouncement\", \"invocation\"\") to some Sufis like Abdulhalik Gucduvani. But it seems that it was not only an echo of Kothar, it is also a strong effect of Surush (or \"Surosh\") who was originally a Zoroastrian divinity Sraosha and Khidr took his place when Islam was introduced to Iran and became the dominant religion there. By the Islamisation process in Iran, Surush (\"Sraosha\") was accepted as a messenger angel and also identified with Jibrail (Gabriel). Because at the same time Surush was an inspirational figure to poets. According to a rumor the Islamic prophet Muhammad has learned a devotion by Khidr. It's more interesting that Khidr is seen as their ancestral master or pir (Sufism) among the ashiks. According to the ashiks' tradition, Khidr gives to apprentices the art of poetry and he helps them for their initiation. The continuity is comprehensible, because in mythic mentality the eloquence and especially the poem is associated with the rhythm and melody of craftsmen's work. Its echo can be understood with the origins of the English word \"poem\" (and poetry). It comes from Latin \"poēma\", from Ancient Greek ποίημα (\"poiēma\"), from ποιέω (\"poiēo\", \"I make\").\n\nOn the other hand, the craftsmen or blacksmiths were seen the lord of writing and it is interesting that the master calligraphers of Ottoman Turkey were sure that their talent was the gift of otherworldly powers; they were iniated by Khidr or Hazret 'Ali. In ancient times the people thoughts that the writing was a magic work and it's often regarded at first as an instrument of the secret and magic power. Therefore, it might be created by craftsmen and blacksmiths who have same power. Besides, the cuneiform was a craft. First of all; it was not easy to write on a clay tablet and to produce a good clay tablet must have been one of the first tasks of an apprentice scribe. Kothar were indirectly associated with the art of writing. Although Kothar was not a patron of scribes, it is very important that Nabu [grandchild of Babylonian god Ea (god)] was known as a patron of the scribes, because some scholars think that Ea is a prototype of Kothar. According to another opinion, Kothar's prototype is Egyptian god Ptah. Ptah's son Imhotep was known as a patron of the scribes. It points that the divine craftsmen and blacksmiths who were also gods of good speech or wise words in mythology, have been transformed to lords of the writing in time. It can be seen in some mythologies that the lord of eloquence is inventor of the writing, too. For example, Irish god Ogma was the lord of eloquence, poetry, and rhetoric. But he had a truly remarkable skill as a poet and he invented the earliest system of writing used in Ireland: Ogham. Another one, Sigurd who was one of the most famous mythological German heroes, had learned the skill of the rune writing by the smith Regin.\n\nThe another characteristic continuity between Kothar and Khidr is their soft and skilled hands. In Ugaritic texts, Kothar is mentioned as a skilled hand (\"hrsh yd\"). Actually, most blacksmiths in mythology were described with such attributions. One of the epithets of the Greek blacksmith Hephaistos, which was used less frequently, was \"\"skilled with both hands\" or \"all-skilled hands\"\". There are many linguistic remainders which show a symbolic connection between the smithy, skillfulness and hand. For example, in the Ethiopian language, äğāma or äğamma means blacksmith, skillful and it comes from äğ which means hand. In Ethiopian language, äğä wāxe and äğä wārq means also blacksmith, but literally of good or golden hand. In Igbo language the word for arts and craft is nka which derives from another Igbo word aka and aka means hand. In this context it is very important that Khidr can be recognize by his soft hands among the people. Because the people of Levant and Asia Minor believe that he has boneless hands. Some Sufis teach that we will all meet Khidr at least once in our lifetime, that you will recognize him when you shake hands with a white bearded man with no bone in his thumb. Actually hand or soft hands metaphorically refers skillfulness, generosity and abundance. There is a term in Arabic for skilled men and women which derived from Arabic hand (\"yad\"). On the other hand, Arabic semahat used in Islamic mysticism for to be generous and to be soft.\n\nLike some blacksmiths and craftsmen, Kothar indirectly, Khidr is directly associated with immortality. In mythology blacksmiths and craftsmen have secret power to get immortality and the healing powers were often attributed to them. In many countries the smith is seen as a medicine man. Vedic craftsman Tvastar is the former of the bodies of men and animals and invoked when desiring offspring, called garbha-pati or \"the lord of the womb\". He is also the guardian of Soma that conveys the experience of immortality, is a healer and gives absolution. He made of the goblet for Soma drink. In Welsh beliefs Govannon (Gofannon) yeasted a kind of immortality beer. In Yakut mythology K'daai Maksin (Kıdaai) is the divine blacksmith and he repairs the broken or amputated limbs of heroes. According to another Yakut belief their ancestor Elliei was the first blacksmith and he has been seen as a healer. Because they believe that smiths have the power to cure by natural means without the assistance of spirits, as do the Shamans. According to an Acanti myth a blacksmith sent by the God to Earth to make a dozen men and animals. Mircea Eliade shows in his work \"The Forge and the Crucible: The Origins and Structure of Alchemy\" that the divine blacksmith of mythology makes elixir of immortality as an alchemist. In Irish mythology, Cú Chulainn (\"Culain\") made a new dog for himself after his savior dog was dead. Mcleish thinks that Ugaritic craftsman Kothar has also same feature. Khidr is described as a holding a cup/goblet in some Alevi divine songs. The cup or goblet symbolize the immortality. On the other hand, the Nusayris of Antakya (\"Turkey\") believe that Khidr can operate men like a surgeon. According to some Islamic epic romances he repairs the broken limbs of warriors. It's told in \"Danishmendname\" that Khidr has repaired the broken hand of Artuhi who was a friend of Melik Danishmend Gazi. He heals also mental illness. For example, the shrine of Beit Jala (near Bethlehem) is associated with Khidr by Muslims who believe it's miraculous cures of mental illness. Even more importantly Khidr known everywhere as an immortal figure, from Balkans to India.\n\nA new hypothesis about the cultural origins of the figure of Khidr points to another common element relating to a religious tradition in Near East, the traditional celebration of Hıdırellez. Like Alevis, people make flour of roasted wheat on the day before the festival for Khidr. They keep it somewhere in the kitchen to see later for Khidr's traces. Next day in the morning if they see some signs on the flour, it means that Khidr came there to bring abundance and blessing for them. Later they bake some kind of cake which is called \"Qāvut\", \"Kavut\", \"Köme\" or \"Göme\". Thus, it takes different names among variously ethnic groups.\n\nThe tradition for Khidr originated from the mythico-rituals of Ancient Near Eastern dying gods like Osiris, Adonis (also Dionysos, Melqart and Mithra) and the process which shows the transformation of the grain to flour symbolizes cremation (\"death\") of the god. Frazer's opinion about Adonis and Osiris rites indirectly clarifies this ritualistic acts. He writes: \"The women bewail him (Adonis), because his lord slew him so cruelly, ground his bones in a mill, and then scattered them to the wind. The women (during this festival) eat nothing which has been ground in a mill, but limit their diet to steeped wheat, sweet vetches, dates, raisins, and the like\". It is actually associated with shamanistic initiations and also with smith's world. Eliade completes this analogy in his important work \"The Forge and the Crucible\": \"\"The identification of shamanism with the art of smith likewise appears in the ceremonial spectacles of certain shamanic initiations. In their dreams or initiatory hallucinations the future shamans watch themselves being torn to pieces by the 'demon'-masters of the initiation. Now these traditional spectacles entail, directly or otherwise, gestures, tools and symbols belonging to the sphere of the smith\"...\"\n\nIn Serbian tradition the blacksmith gives the water mill to people. This symbolic and cultural association between the smith and mill is remarkable for the continuity between Kothar and Khidr.\n\nAstrologically, the planet Mercury represents the principals of communication, intelligence and elegance. Therefore, Khidr refers directly to Mercury in astrology. He is a typical Mercurial character, like Kothar wa Hasis, Nabu, Hermes, Odin etc. Firstly, he is lord of wisdom, he has hikmah and also knows ilm al-ladunni (a kind of esoteric knowledge). According to the Quran, he is more intelligent than Moses (18: 65-82).\nIn ancient Greece, Hermes was Mercurial type and he has capacity to explain (hermeneus) the secret (sacred) doctrines. He inspires the poets as oneiropompos (the guide of dreams). Same function is familiar among the other Mercurial divinities. Like them, Khidr inspires the poets (for example Hafez Shirazi) and teaches dhikr to some Sufis. Khidr who is different in folk religions than the Quran, moves very fast, like other Mercurial types; Nabu, Hermes, Odin and even Zoroastrian \"yazata\" Sraosha. This feature is originated from the rhythm of the planet Mercury. Because Mercury is known with his swiftness. In mythology, Mercury is the messenger of the gods, noted for his speed and swiftness. It symbolizes the conjunction between the material and spiritual world. Therefore, Mercurial gods are psychopomp, like Hermes. They bring some messages also in dreams. The position of Khidr is same in the folk beliefs. For example, according two different stories from Dersim Alevis, he introduces to dream of hero and says to the person what he must do.\nMercurial type of mythology is regarded as guide of travelers and the souls, like Hermes. Khidr is also known as a guide (murshid) among the Sufis and he saves the travelers in danger. Like Hermes, Khidr is mostly described with his staff. In some cultures, the people believes that his staff can sometimes turn to a snake, specially during the ritual. Caduceus is Hermes's staff and it's always described with two snakes. They are symbols of the healthy and the medicine.\nMercurial gods fight to dragons or evil spirits. They use their staff as a weapon. In some religious contexts, Khidr fights also to dragons or helps some Sufis for their struggle with the dragons.\nThe most of the gods which symbolize Mercury, are not only lords of the sacred or magic words, they are also related with the writing. This feature corresponds to the belief of Islamic calligraphers that Khidr is their patron. Khidr brings luck to the people, like Hermes as Mercurial.\n\nThe story of Quran over Moses and Khidr has some astrological representations. The fish which has been lost on a rock is symbol of the Pisces (astrology). Pisces which twelfth sign of zodiac is described with two fish. One of them symbolizes the mortality and the other one, the immortality. Therefore, Pisces is not only the heavenly sign of dead, it is also the sign of resurrection. Thus it refers to the place of immortal Khidr. Besides Mercury is the ruler of third and twelfth house in astrology. Twelfth house is disappearance region and it can be its mythological echo's in the myths of twelve (\"gayb\") imam of Shiites and the twelve (\"lost\") tribe of Jews.\nThe story of Dhul-Qarnayn in the Quran refers also astral beings and movements. In this point, Solomon Gadz as a follower of R.N. Nicholson suggested in his article ‘\"The Zodiacal Light in Semitic Mythology\"’ (1943) that Dhul’ Qarnayn is personification of the zodiacal light and he is no one than the old Semitic deity Athtar. According to the some scholars, the myths of Heracles and Gilgamesh is astral model of the story of Dhul Qarnayn and there are some common elements between these myths and Quranic story; like two mountain and darkness land (\"Zulumat\").\n\nThere are several versions of the Alexander romance in which al-Khiḍr figures as a servant of Alexander the Great. in one version, al-Khiḍr and Alexander — identified with Dhul-Qarnayn — cross the Land of Darkness to find the Water of Life. Dhul-Qarnayn gets lost looking for the spring but al-Khiḍr finds it and gains eternal life. In the \"Iskandarnamah\" by an anonymous author, al-Khiḍr is asked by Dhul-Qarnayn to lead him and his armies to the Water of Life. Al-Khiḍr agrees, and eventually stumbles upon the Water of Life on his own.\n\nSome scholars suggest that al-Khiḍr is also represented in the Arthurian tale Sir Gawain and the Green Knight as the Green Knight. In the story, the Green Knight tempts the faith of Sir Gawain three times. The character of al-Khiḍr may have come into European literature through the mixing of cultures during the Crusades. It is also possible that the story derives from an Irish myth which predates the Crusades in which Cú Chulainn and two other heroes compete for the curadmír, the select portion given to champions, at feasts; ultimately, Cú Chulainn is the only one willing to let a giant — actually a king who has magically disguised himself — cut off his head, as per their agreement.\n\nThe story is also similar to one told by Rabbi Nissim ben Jacob in the eleventh century of a journey made by Elijah and Rabbi Joshua ben Levi. The first house where they stay the night belongs to a pious old couple who give the prophet and the rabbi the best of their food and beds. However, the couple's cow dies in the night. Elijah later explains that the Angel of Death came and he persuaded the angel to take the cow instead of the wife. The next house, as in the al-Khiḍr story, is that of a rich miser, and Elijah repairs his wall so that he will not, in having it repaired, find the treasure hidden under it.\n\nA third potential parallel to the legend surrounding al-Khiḍr is the Epic of Gilgamesh. The episode in question takes place after the death of king Gilgamesh's closest friend Enkidu. Gilgamesh goes on a journey to find his ancestor Utnapishtim, a wise figure who was granted immortal life and who lives at the mouth of rivers. Ultimately, although Gilgamesh finds Utnapishtim, he is not able to attain immortality. Although the parallel is not exact, the story shares several major themes with both Surah 18 in the Quran and the Alexander romance, namely, the presence of a wise figure in all three stories, and the quest and ultimate failure to attain immortality in the epic of Gilgamesh and the Alexander romance.\n\nIn certain parts of India, al-Khiḍr is also known as \"Khawaja Khidr\", a river spirit of wells and streams. He is mentioned in the Sikandar-nama as the saint who presides over the well of immortality, and is revered by both Hindus and Muslims. He is sometimes pictured as an old man dressed in green, and is believed to ride upon a fish. His principal shrine is on an island of the Indus River by Bhakkar in Punjab, Pakistan.\n\nIn \"The Unreasoning Mask\" by famed science fiction writer Philip José Farmer, while Ramstan, captain of the al-Buraq, a rare model spaceship capable of instantaneous travel between two points, attempts to stop an unidentified creature that is annihilating intelligent life on planets throughout the universe, he is haunted by repeating vision of meeting al-Khiḍr.\n\nHızır is revered as helper among some Muslims, vehicles of emergency such as \"Hızır Acil\" named after it (Turkey).\n\n\n\n"}

As such he was the central founder of the School of Isfahan, noted by his students and admirers as the Third Teacher (mu'alim al-thalith) after Aristotle and al-Farabi.\n\nHis major contribution to Islamic philosophy was his novel formulation regarding gradations of time and the emanations of the separate categories of time as descending divine hypostases. He resolved the controversy of the createdness or uncreatedness of the world in time by proposing the notion of \"huduth-e-dahri\" (atemporal origination) as an explanation grounded in Avicennan and Suhrawardian categories, whilst transcending them. In brief, excepting God, he argued all things, including the earth and all heavenly bodies, share in both eternal and temporal origination. He influenced the revival of al-falsafa al-yamani (Philosophy of Yemen), a philosophy based on revelation and sayings of prophets rather than the rationalism of the Greeks, and he is widely recognized as the founder of the School of Isfahan, which embraced a theosophical outlook known as \"hikmat-i ilahi\" (divine wisdom).\n\nMir Damad’s many treatises on Islamic philosophy include \"Taqwim al-Iman\" (\"Calendars of Faith\", a treasure on creation and divine knowledge), the \"Kitab Qabasat al-Ilahiyah\" (\"Book of the Divine Embers of Fiery Kindling\"), wherein he lays out his concept of atemporal origination, \"Kitab al-Jadhawat\" and \"Sirat al-Mustaqim\". He also wrote poetry under the pseudonym of \"Ishraq\" (Illumination). He also wrote a couple of books on mathematics, but with secondary importance.\n\nAmong his many other students besides Mulla Sadra were Seyyed Ahmad-ibn-Reyn-al-A’bedin Alavi, Mohammad ibn Alireza ibn Agajanii, Qutb-al-Din Mohammad Ashkevari and Mulla Shams Gilani.\n\nMir Damad's philosophical prose is often accounted as being among the most dense and obstrusely difficult of styles to understand, deliberately employing as well as coining convoluted philosophical terminology and neologisms that require systematic unpacking and detailed commentary.\nHe was called Mir Damad (Groom of the King) because he married Shah Abbas's daughter and hence his fame was based on that event.\n\nMir Damad was also the architect of the Masjide Shah (Shah Mosque) in Isfahan which employed highly advance mathematical calculations which required the knowledge of the speed of sound at that time. The geometry of the dome is as such that all sound dissipated from the base will echo in hundreds of carefully calculated and masterly executed interior corners of the dome which will ultimately collide in the center of the dome. The geometrical analysis of the dome is of absolute sophistication and the design of the dome is a magnificent piece of art and furthermore the construction of such dome in the 17th century to a precision where all sound waves must travel and collide in an imaginary point above.\n\nAmong his 134 works known:\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "31332208", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31332208", "title": "Patrick Baert", "text": "Patrick Baert\n\nPatrick Baert (born 23 January 1961 in Brussels) is a Belgian sociologist and social theorist, based in Britain. He is Professor of Social Theory at the University of Cambridge and Fellow of Selwyn College, Cambridge.\n\nBaert studied at the Free University of Brussels and at Oxford University where he obtained his D.Phil. in 1990. In Oxford he studied with Rom Harré and wrote his dissertation on George Herbert Mead's notion of time and its relevance for social theory, subsequently published as \"Time, Self and Social Being\". He carried out postdoctoral work with Claude Javeau in Brussels and Anthony Giddens in Cambridge before taking up a teaching position at Cambridge. He has held various visiting positions, including Brown University, the University of Cape Town, the CNRS/EHESS and the University of British Columbia. His most recent books include \"The Existentialist Moment; The Rise of Sartre as a Public Intellectual\" and (co-written with Marcus Morgan) \"Conflict in the Academy; A Study in the Sociology of Intellectuals\". He also published \"Social Theory in the Twentieth Century and Beyond\". and \"Philosophy of the Social Sciences: Towards Pragmatism\". Since January 2013, he is the Editor-in-Chief of the International Journal of Politics, Culture, and Society.\n\nBaert's recent work lies at the intersection between the sociology of intellectuals and intellectual history. \"The Existentialist Moment\" explains the sudden rise of Sartre as a public intellectual in the mid-1940s. In this book Baert describes the reshaping of the intellectual and cultural field in France during WWII and he shows how Sartre was able to present a neat vocabulary to make sense of and come to terms with the trauma of the war. Baert pays particular attention to the trials of French collaborationist intellectuals in which the notion of responsibility loomed large - a notion which also became central in the broader cultural realm at the time. During this period, Sartre redefined his philosophy, making it simpler and more digestable, centring it around this notion of responsibility of the intellectual. Hence his idea of the engaged intellectual which also became a guiding principle of the journal \"Les Temps modernes\".\n\nTowards the end of \"The Existentialist Moment\" Baert also discusses the gradual decline of interest in Sartre and existentialism from the early 1960s onwards. With the rise and institutionalisation of the social sciences, expert public intellectuals gained in significance in comparison with authoritative public intellectuals. Authoritative public intellectuals like Sartre rely on their privileged parcours and elite training to speak with moral vigour about a wide range of social and political issues without necessarily having expertise in them. Expert public intellectuals draw on methodological training and expertise in the social sciences to intervene politically. In this context, the rise of structuralism in the late 1950s and 1950s is particularly significant. In contrast with existentialism (which was very much embedded in the humanities), structuralism was compatible with the emerging social sciences (and indeed with other theoretical currents such as Marxism and psychoanalysis).\n\nThe last chapter of \"The Existentialst Moment\" develops the theoretical framework - positioning theory - that underpins the book. This frame of reference also guides partly \"Conflict in the Academy\" although the latter also draws explicitly on insights from cultural sociology.\n\nBaert's earlier work deals with the philosophy of social sciences. He argues against several existing contributions to the philosophy of social sciences. Against those philosophies of social science that infer prescriptions for the social sciences based on attempts to demarcate science from non-science, he argues that developments in the history and sociology of science have undermined the validity of the notion of demarcation. Contrary to those social scientists who liken their empirical research to an arbitration court that helps to decide the fate of the theory or research programme under consideration, he contends that research in the social sciences relies on theoretical presuppositions which are contestable – and contested – to such an extent that empirical research cannot be regarded as a straightforward testing device. In opposition to what he coins ‘the social cartography model’ (according to which high-quality social research captures the inner essence of the social world as accurately and completely as possible and social theory provides the conceptual building blocks for this representation), he argues that it is not fruitful to conceive of research in terms of the passive recording of the external world, and that this representational model ultimately leads to theoretical ossification.\n\nBaert argues in favour of a neo-pragmatist philosophy of social science which promotes social research in the pursuit of self-referential knowledge. Whereas many contributions to the philosophy of social science assume that social research is primarily an explanatory (and possibly predictive) endeavor, Baert contends that this picture does not correspond to the actual practice of social research. He points out that few significant contributions to sociology - and social research in general - are straightforward explanatory works, and even fewer are exclusively explanatory. Baert's position is that most of those groundbreaking works involve ‘self-referential knowledge’: they enable communities to re-describe and re-conceptualise themselves and their presuppositions. Inspired by Rorty's neo-pragmatism, he has argued in favour of the pursuit of self-referential knowledge, and he has analysed the methodological strategies that make this possible in various disciplines, ranging from archaeology and social anthropology to sociology and history. For instance, Nietzsche's genealogical history can provide contemporary communities with tools that enable them to re-evaluate the moral and cognitive categories they use to describe the world and their place within it. Baer's notion of self-referential knowledge relates to the German notion of Bildung or self-edification and with a new role for intellectuals, whereby they facilitate envisaging alternative socio-political scenarios rather than presenting a set of normative or epistmeological foundations.\n\nA special issue of the journal \"Human Studies\" was dedicated to a symposium around Baert's \"Philosophy of the Social Sciences: Towards Pragmatism\". In this issue Stephen Turner questioned Baert's attempt to promote dialogue whilst holding onto a notion of expertise. In the same issue Paul Roth argues that Baert contradicts himself: whilst rightly rejecting the notion of a scientific method, Baert then surprisingly suggests a method for pursuing self-referential knowledge. Bohman contends that Baert underestimates the ability of social scientists to develop generalisations which can lead to emancipatory political agendas. For a critical exchange between Baert and Peter Manicas, see the \"Journal of Critical Realism\"; Whilst sympathetic to Dewey, Manicas disagrees with Baert's neo-pragmatism. For a critical exchange between Patrick Baert/Filipe Carreira da Silva and Simon Susen (in relation to Baert and Silva's 2010 book), see the journal \"Distinktion; Scandinavian Journal of Social Theory\". Whilst sympathetic, Susen laments, for instance, Baert and Carreira da Silva's anti-foundationalism.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "53655846", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53655846", "title": "Peace Revolution", "text": "Peace Revolution\n\nPeace Revolution is an online meditation platform aimed at young adults. The platform's primary focus is on the teaching of samatha meditation but is also involved in other activities and events related to mindfulness and peace-building. Although the platform has a secular orientation, it does draw on principles of Buddhism. Buddhist monks from Thailand are often invited to lead meditation and mindfulness activities.\n\nThe idea the platform is built on is that sustainable world peace can only be established by first achieving mindfulness, or \"inner peace\", at the individual level; after which peace can be achieved at the community level and greater. This is expressed through Peace Revolution's slogan \"Peace In, Peace Out\" (PIPO).\n\nPeace Revolution offers a number of offline and online activities and programs to facilitate this goal.\n\nPeace Revolution was established in 2008 by the World Peace Initiative Foundation (WPI), a non-profit organization which operates mainly from Thailand. The initial idea for the creation of the website was that with current developments in modern education, the focus on mental well-being had become less important. With a growing availability of Internet connections throughout the world, meditation could be easily introduced in this way. The platform is known for introducing meditation as a secular hobby for people in regions where meditation is not widely known. The World Peace Initiative and Peace Revolution have partnerships with several organizations internationally, including the European Commission.\n\nPeace Revolution runs a forty-two-day online self-development program based on its \"Peace In, Peace Out\" philosophy, which focuses on meditation, daily self-discipline to deepen meditation experiences, and other activities for self-reflection. Subject matter discussed include incorporating meditation into one's daily life, the relation between body and mind, the training of habits, a culture of peace and conflict resolution. Meditation, referred to as \"Inner Peace Time\" on the platform, makes up the central theme of Peace Revolution's activities. The meditation technique used on the platform is Dhammakaya meditation.\n\nSeveral online meditation resources are available on the Peace Revolution website, including a written walk-through on meditation and guided meditations in various languages. Optional offline components of the program include special assignments which the participants complete in their own surroundings, called \"Special Ops\". Such activities include inviting others to meditate, and collaborative art or community service projects with the theme of inner peace.\nPeace Revolution offers numerous fellowships hosted around the world. Peace Revolution Fellowships typically range from three to fourteen days and include a meditation retreat.\n\nThe platform is also active in various Peace Summits across the world, often in partnership with local organizations. Summits typically last four days and feature numerous guest speakers from the World Peace Initiative Foundation, as well as speakers from different like-minded organizations from the region. The topics typically discussed in the peace summits include peace-building, specific issues related to the region, and the benefits of meditation in these peace-building processes.In addition to these summits, Peace Revolution also sponsors events for participants who wish to organize their own meditation events and workshops in their local areas, providing meditation instructors and assisting participants in organizing their events. Instructors provided include Buddhist monks and certified meditation instructors of different backgrounds. Such events are referred to as \"Peace on Demand\" events (also called a event).\n\nPeace Revolution's first \"Peace on Demand\" event was held in Egypt in 2010 during the International Day of Peace. In the following years, numerous local events have been organized worldwide, with events being held in forty-six different countries Peace Revolution sponsored events have been held in various settings, such as for companies to provide training for its employees, and in universities, schools and prisons.\n\nSome events that Peace Revolution has sponsored or helped coordinate are meditation workshops in refugee camps for African children and a broadcast on Albanian national television. Other examples are a vigil in Muea-Buea, Cameroon, to commemorate victims after a bombing of the Boko Haram in 2015, and guided meditation that took place during a film festival emphasizing human rights in Barcelona. Finally, Peace Revolution volunteers have also organized peace walks to promote their message.\n\nAlthough Peace Revolution and its programs are run by full-time employees based at its headquarters, the organization relies heavily on a large network of volunteers worldwide to organize its programs and events.\n\n"}

The Pending Meal community initiative was started on social media in April 2015 by Sarah Rizvi, focusing on restaurants in Dubai. Once the news of the initiative started to spread, many local restaurants were willing to tie up and provide their support too. The idea spread to other areas including Sharjah, Abu Dhabi, Ras Al Khaimah, U.S.A, Canada, Sri Lanka, India and Pakistan.\n\nThe Pending Meal movement encourages people to pay for someone else’s meal at a food outlet so the less fortunate can walk in and eat. The initiative is not limited to United Arab Emirates only and the founder believes that wherever there is a hungry mouth, there is a Pending Meal to feed. The idea originated from the concept of suspended coffee practiced in some coffee shops in Naples. Customers would pay for their own coffee and when they wanted to, could pay for an extra ‘suspended coffee’ or a 'suspended meal' which was meant for the less fortunate. Thus, a person who was hungry or thirsty could walk into the cafe and ask if there was a suspended coffee or suspended meal that they could drink or eat.\n\nThere is no limit to how much one can donate to the cause. “There have been people who have paid in advance for the meal of just one person and some have even paid for 15,” said Rizvi.\n\nThe Pending Meal initiative is not a charity organization and does not collect funds (in any form). The initiative is purely encouraging people to give back to community by providing less fortunate with a meal so that no one has to stay hungry.\n"}
{"id": "18647261", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18647261", "title": "Protective autoimmunity", "text": "Protective autoimmunity\n\nProtective autoimmunity is a condition in which cells of the adaptive immune system contribute to maintenance of the functional integrity of a tissue, or facilitate its repair following an insult. The term ‘protective autoimmunity’ was coined by Prof. Michal Schwartz of the Weizmann Institute of Science (Israel), whose pioneering studies were the first to demonstrate that autoimmune T lymphocytes can have a beneficial role in repair, following an injury to the central nervous system (CNS). Most of the studies on the phenomenon of protective autoimmunity were conducted in experimental settings of various CNS pathologies and thus reside within the scientific discipline of neuroimmunology. \n\nThe adaptive immune system primarily consists of T and B cells (lymphocytes), which can respond to specific antigens and subsequently acquire an immunological memory. The activity of adaptive immunity is critically important for host defense against pathogens. Cells of the adaptive immunity that respond to self-antigens are termed ‘autoimmune cells’. Autoimmunity, the activity of autoimmune cells, is generally considered in the context of an autoimmune disease—a pathological condition induced by an overwhelming activity of autoimmune cells. One of the hallmarks of immunity is the ability to transfer a substantial amount of lymphocytes or antibodies from one animal to another in a way that results in immunity to a certain pathogen (adaptive transfer). Similarly, autoimmune diseases can be induced experimentally by the adaptive transfer of autoimmune cells or antibodies from an animal that suffers from an autoimmune disease into a healthy animal. In a seminal study of 1999, Schwartz and colleagues demonstrated that the same autoimmune T cells that can cause an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE, a common model for multiple sclerosis) can also be harnessed to protect injured CNS tissue from secondary degeneration following a traumatic insult. The experiment showed that after a partial crush injury of the optic nerve, rats injected with activated T cells which are specific for myelin basic protein (MBP, a common protein in the CNS) retained 3-fold more retinal ganglion cells with functionally intact axons than did rats injected with activated T cells specific for other (control) antigens. These findings indicated that at least under certain circumstances, autoimmune activity could exert a beneficial effect by protecting injured neurons from the spread of damage. Additional work by the Schwartz group has shown that protective autoimmunity is a naturally occurring physiological phenomenon that takes place spontaneously following a CNS injury. Mutant mice which lack T cells (such as SCID and nude), and mice that lack T cells that can recognize CNS antigens, exhibit reduced levels of neuronal survival following CNS injury relative to normal (wild type) mice. On the other hand, mice that were genetically engineered so that most of their T cells will recognize a CNS antigen—such as transgenic mice overexpressing a T cell receptor (TcR) for MBP—exhibit elevated rates of neuronal survival after CNS injury. Experiments conducted in animal models of spinal cord injury, brain injury, glaucoma, stroke, motor neuron degeneration, Parkinson’s and Alzheimer's disease have demonstrated the relevance of immune cells and in particular T cells that recognize CNS antigens in promoting neuronal survival and functional recovery from acute and chronic neurodegenerative conditions. T cells that recognize CNS antigens have also been shown to be important for maintaining the functional integrity of the adult CNS under normal non-pathological conditions. Immune deficient mice and mice which lack T cells that recognize brain antigens exhibit impairments in spatial learning and memory, and have reduced levels of cell renewal in the hippocampus and sub-ventricular zone (the brain structures where neurogenesis takes place in the adult brain).\n\nAn immune response that takes place following CNS injury elicits a cascade of molecular and cellular events that can eventually affect the organism’s functional recovery. Immediately after an injury to the CNS, there is a local innate immune response. This response is mediated primarily by microglia cells, a population of CNS-resident immune cells, which can act as phagocytes, and antigen-presenting cells. CD4+ T helper cells that were specifically activated by antigens associated with the lesion, arrive at the site of injury and locally interact with microglia and other blood-derived antigen presenting cells (e.g. dendritic cells). Local properties of antigen presenting cells (i.e. the levels of MHC-II-self antigen complexes and the type of co-stimulatory molecules) dictate the profile of the subsequent T cell response. The interaction between the T cells and the microglia/dendritic cells results in the production of a set of inflammatory cytokines (such as interferon gamma) and chemokines (chemoatractant proteins) that, in turn, orchestrate the ensuing repair process in which many cell types participate. Microglia and myeloid cells recruited from the circulating blood restrict the spread of damage by buffering excessive levels of toxic self-compounds (such as the neurotransmitter glutamate), and by producing growth factors (such as insulin-like growth factor-1) that prevent neuronal death and induce axonal re-growth. In addition, the chemokines produced at the site of injury attract endogenous stem or progenitor cells that can further contribute to repair by providing a source for new neurons and glial cells, and by restricting the local immune response.\n\nThe mechanism by which protective autoimmunity maintains the brain’s functional integrity under non-injurious conditions is still not known. One model suggests that CNS-specific autoimmune T cells which constantly circulate through the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) interact with perivascular dendritic cells that reside at the choroid plexus and meninges. Cytokines and growth factors secreted into the CSF by the T cells and dendritic cells then diffuse into the neural parenchyma were they locally affect neurons, glial cells and stem cells. This model infers that the level of antigen presentation (i.e. the amount of MHC-II-self antigen complexes) serves as an indicator of the level of immune activity required for maintenance of the uninjured brain.\n\nThe outcome of autoimmune activity is determined by several factors, namely: the intensity, the location, and the duration of the autoimmune response. For an autoimmune response to be beneficial, its intensity, duration and site of activity must be tightly regulated. Although autoimmune T cells exist in all healthy individuals, a relatively small portion of the population develops autoimmune diseases. This is due to various mechanisms that constantly regulate the activity of autoimmune cells. One of the prominent autoimmune regulatory mechanisms is a sub-population of T cells called ‘regulatory T cells’ (previously known as ‘suppressor T cells’), which restrict autoimmune activity. Experiments in animal models of CNS injury have shown that depletion of regulatory T cells allows an enhanced neuroprotective autoimmune response to take place after the insult. Importantly, however, such an experimental manipulation can at the same time increase the susceptibility to development of an autoimmune disease. Under certain conditions, an initially protective autoimmune response can reach a tipping point, after which it will have a detrimental effect on the tissue, and might even develop into an autoimmune disease. Both genetic and environmental factors (such as infection) can underlie such a transition from a neuroprotective autoimmune response into an overwhelming and detrimental autoimmune disease.\n\nOther cell types, such as B cells and even neural progenitor cells, can promote regulation of immune response in the CNS. Stem and progenitor cells are usually regarded with respect to their potential to serve as a source for newly differentiated cells, but recently stem and progenitor cells have also been acknowledged for their ability to modulate immune activity. Experiments have shown that injection of neural progenitor cells into the brain’s ventricles can modulate an immune response taking place at multiple inflammatory foci in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis, or at a single site at the injured spinal cord.\n\nThe concept of protective autoimmunity is relatively new, and it has been shadowed by the historic and yet dominant view of autoimmunity as a damaging factor. Skepticism towards protective autoimmunity has been further fueled by the general concept of the CNS as being an immune privileged site in which immune cell activity is observed only under pathological conditions. Nevertheless, studies during the last decade have established that the immune system has the capacity to orchestrate a multitude of beneficial effects in the adult CNS under both normal and pathological conditions. Such effects range from the molecular level (growth factor production, buffering of toxic self compounds) through the cellular level (induction of axonal regrowth and neurogenesis) to the behavioral level (maintenance of spatial memory). \n\nSeveral approaches have been used experimentally in order to harness naturally occurring immune cell activity in CNS pathologies. Here are key examples:\n\n1. Therapeutic vaccination: This approach utilizes a common immunological manipulation. Inoculation of an antigen that is associated with the pathology, in this case the site of injury, evokes the activation and proliferation of lymphocytes which can specifically respond to the antigen used. For therapeutic purposes, vaccination with an antigen associated with the site of injury (for example peptides derived from myelin proteins) is problematic, because it carries the risk of inducing, in individuals susceptible to autoimmune diseases, an overwhelming inflammatory response that is detrimental for recovery. To circumvent this problem researchers have been using lower affinity agonists (termed ‘altered peptide ligands’) which induce a weaker immune response. Experiments in animal models of spinal cord injury revealed that the use of such altered peptide ligands is effective in promoting functional recovery without the risk of inducing a deleterious autoimmune response.\n\n2. Alteration of regulatory T cell activity: Suppressing regulatory T cell activity following injury can allow a more robust autoimmune response to take place. For therapeutic purpose, the mere removal of regulatory T cells is, again, highly problematic because it increases the risk of inducing autoimmune diseases. Overcoming this limitation is possible using agents that transiently suppress regulatory T cell activity. Such an agent has been used successfully in an animal model of ischemic stroke, where treated animals exhibited improved neurological recovery relative to non-treated animals.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "806343", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=806343", "title": "Vincenzo Gioberti", "text": "Vincenzo Gioberti\n\nVincenzo Gioberti (; 5 April 180126 October 1852) was an Italian clergyman, philosopher, publicist and politician.\n\nGioberti was born in Turin, Italy. When still very young he lost his parents, and at the age of sixteen was admitted among the clerics of the court. He studied theology at the University of Turin, and obtained his doctorate there.\n\nHe was educated by the fathers of the Oratory with a view to the priesthood and ordained in 1825. In 1828, he made a journey through Lombardy, and became friendly with Alessandro Manzoni. Partly under the influence of Giuseppe Mazzini, the freedom of Italy became his ruling motive in life, its emancipation, not only from foreign masters, but from modes of thought alien to its genius, and detrimental to its European authority. This authority was in his mind connected with papal supremacy. Though in a way quite intellectual rather than political. This leitmotif informs nearly all his writings, and also his political position with respect to the ruling clerical party—the Jesuits—and the court of Piedmont after the accession of Charles Albert in 1831.\n\nGioberti was now noticed by the king and made one of his chaplains. His popularity and private influence, however, were reasons enough for the court party to mark him for exile; he was not one of them, and could not be depended on. Knowing this, he resigned his office in 1833, but was suddenly arrested on a charge of conspiracy, and after, an imprisonment of four months was banished without a trial. Gioberti first went to Paris, and a year later, to Brussels where he remained till 1845. In Brussels he taught philosophy and assisted a friend in the work of a private school. He nevertheless found time to write many works of philosophical importance, with special reference to his country and its position.\n\nIn 1841, on the appearance of his book \"Del Buono\", the Grand Duke of Tuscany offered him a chair at the University of Pisa, but King Charles Albert objected, and the offer came to nothing. His fame in Italy dates from 1843 when he published his \"Del primato morale e civile degli Italiani\", which he dedicated to Silvio Pellico. Starting with the greatness of ancient Rome he traced history down through the splendors of the papacy, and recounting all that science and art owed to the genius of Italy, he declared that the Italian people were a model for all nations, and that their then insignificance was the result of their weakness politically, to remedy which he proposed a confederation of all the states of Italy with the pope as their head.\n\nAn amnesty having been declared by Charles Albert in 1846, Gioberti (who was again in Paris) was at liberty to return to Italy, but refused to do so till the end of 1847. On his entrance into Turin on 29 April 1848 he was received with the greatest enthusiasm. He refused the dignity of senator offered him by Charles Albert, preferring to represent his native town in the Chamber of Deputies, of which he was soon elected president. At the close of the same year, a new ministry was formed, headed by Gioberti; but with the accession of Victor Emmanuel in March 1849, his active life came to an end. For a short time indeed be held a seat in the cabinet, though without a portfolio; but an irreconcilable disagreement soon followed, and his removal from Turin was accomplished by his appointment on a mission to Paris, whence he never returned. There, refusing the pension which had been offered him and all ecclesiastical preferment, he lived frugally, and spent his days and nights as at Brussels in literary labour. He died suddenly, of apoplexy, on 26 October 1852.\n\nThe following assessment is attributed to the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" Eleventh Edition.\n\nGioberti's writings are more important than his political career. In the general history of European philosophy they stand apart. As the speculations of Rosmini-Serbati, against which he wrote, have been called the last link added to medieval thought, so the system of Gioberti, known as Ontologism, more especially in his greater and earlier works, is unrelated to other modern schools of thought. It shows a harmony with the Roman Catholic faith which caused Cousin to declare that Italian philosophy was still in the bonds of theology, and that Gioberti was no philosopher.\n\nMethod is with him a synthetic, subjective and psychological instrument. He reconstructs, as he declares, ontology, and begins with the ideal formula, the \"Ens\" creates \"ex nihilo\" the existent. God is the only being (Ens); all other things are merely existences. God is the origin of all human knowledge (called lidea, thought), which is one and so to say identical with God himself. It is directly beheld (intuited) by reason, but in order to be of use it has to be reflected on, and this by means of language. A knowledge of being and existences (concrete, not abstract) and their mutual relations, is necessary as the beginning of philosophy.\n\nGioberti is in some respects a Platonist. He identifies religion with civilization, and in his treatise \"Del primato morale e civile degli italiani\" arrives at the conclusion that the church is the axis on which the well-being of human life revolves. In it he affirms the idea of the supremacy of Italy, brought about by the restoration of the papacy as a moral dominion, founded on religion and public opinion. In his later works, the \"Rinnovamento\" and the \"Protologia\", he is thought by some to have shifted his ground under the influence of events.\n\nHis first work, written when he was thirty-seven, had a personal reason for its existence. A young fellow-exile and friend, Paolo Pallia, having many doubts and misgivings as to the reality of revelation and a future life, Gioberti at once set to work with \"La Teorica del sovrannaturale\", which was his first publication (1838). After this, philosophical treatises followed in rapid succession. The \"Teorica\" was followed by \"Introduzione allo studio della filosofia\" in three volumes (1839–1840). In this work he states his reasons for requiring a new method and new terminology. Here he brings out the doctrine that religion is the direct expression of the idea in this life, and is one with true civilization in history. Civilization is a conditioned mediate tendency to perfection, to which religion is the final completion if carried out; it is the end of the second cycle expressed by the second formula, the Ens redeems existences.\n\nEssays (not published till 1846) on the lighter and more popular subjects, \"Del bello\" and \"Del buono\", followed the \"Introduzione\". \"Del primato morale e civile degli Italiani\" and the \"Prolegomeni\" to the same, and soon afterwards his triumphant exposure of the Jesuits, \"Il Gesuita moderno\", no doubt hastened the transfer of rule from clerical to civil hands. It was the popularity of these semi-political works, increased by other occasional political articles, and his \"Rinnovamento civile d'Italia\", that caused Gioberti to be welcomed with such enthusiasm on his return to his native country. All these works were perfectly orthodox, and aided in drawing the liberal clergy into the movement which has resulted since his time in the unification of Italy. The Jesuits, however, closed round the pope more firmly after his return to Rome, and in the end Gioberti's writings were placed on the Index. The remainder of his works, especially \"La Filosofia della Rivelazione\" and the \"Prolologia\", give his mature views on many points.\n\n\n\nSee also:\nThe centenary of Gioberti called forth several monographs in Italy.\n"}

Beginning his writing career in the late 1970s, his early works were noir, near-future stories that explored the effects of technology, cybernetics, and computer networks on humans—a \"combination of lowlife and high tech\"—and helped to create an iconography for the information age before the ubiquity of the Internet in the 1990s. Gibson notably coined the term \"cyberspace\" in his short story \"Burning Chrome\" (1982) and later popularized the concept in his acclaimed debut novel \"Neuromancer\" (1984). These early works have been credited with \"renovating\" science fiction literature.\n\nAfter expanding on \"Neuromancer\" with two more novels to complete the dystopic Sprawl trilogy, Gibson collaborated with Bruce Sterling on the alternate history novel \"The Difference Engine\" (1990), which became an important work of the science fiction subgenre steampunk. In the 1990s, Gibson composed the Bridge trilogy of novels, which explored the sociological developments of near-future urban environments, postindustrial society, and late capitalism. Following the turn of the century and the events of 9/11, Gibson emerged with a string of increasingly realist novels—\"Pattern Recognition\" (2003), \"Spook Country\" (2007), and \"Zero History\" (2010)—set in a roughly contemporary world. These works saw his name reach mainstream bestseller lists for the first time. His more recent novel, \"The Peripheral\" (2014), returned to a more overt engagement with technology and recognizable science fiction concerns.\n\nIn 1999, \"The Guardian\" described Gibson as \"probably the most important novelist of the past two decades,\" while the \"Sydney Morning Herald\" called him the \"noir prophet\" of cyberpunk. Throughout his career, Gibson has written more than 20 short stories and 10 critically acclaimed novels (one in collaboration), contributed articles to several major publications, and collaborated extensively with performance artists, filmmakers, and musicians. His work has been cited as an influence across a variety of disciplines spanning academia, design, film, literature, music, cyberculture, and technology.\n\nWilliam Ford Gibson was born in the coastal city of Conway, South Carolina, and he spent most of his childhood in Wytheville, Virginia, a small town in the Appalachians where his parents had been born and raised. His family moved frequently during Gibson's youth owing to his father's position as manager of a large construction company. In Norfolk, Virginia, Gibson attended Pines Elementary School, where the teachers' lack of encouragement for him to read was a cause of dismay for his parents. While Gibson was still a young child, a little over a year into his stay at Pines Elementary, his father choked to death in a restaurant while on a business trip. His mother, unable to tell William the bad news, had someone else inform him of the death. Tom Maddox has commented that Gibson \"grew up in an America as disturbing and surreal as anything J. G. Ballard ever dreamed\".\n\nA few days after the death, Gibson's mother returned them from their home in Norfolk to Wytheville. Gibson later described Wytheville as \"a place where modernity had arrived to some extent but was deeply distrusted\" and credits the beginnings of his relationship with science fiction, his \"native literary culture\", with the subsequent feeling of abrupt exile. At the age of 12, Gibson \"wanted nothing more than to be a science fiction writer\". He spent a few unproductive years at basketball-obsessed George Wythe High School, a time spent largely in his room listening to records and reading books. At 13, unbeknownst to his mother, he purchased an anthology of Beat generation writing, thereby gaining exposure to the writings of Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, and William S. Burroughs; the lattermost had a particularly pronounced effect, greatly altering Gibson's notions of the possibilities of science fiction literature.\n\nA shy, ungainly teenager, Gibson grew up in a monoculture he found \"highly problematic\", consciously rejected religion and took refuge in reading science fiction as well as writers such as Burroughs and Henry Miller. Becoming frustrated with his poor academic performance, Gibson's mother threatened to send him to a boarding school; to her surprise, he reacted enthusiastically. Unable to afford his preferred choice of Southern California, his then \"chronically anxious and depressive\" mother, who had remained in Wytheville since the death of her husband, sent him to Southern Arizona School for Boys in Tucson. He resented the structure of the private boarding school but was in retrospect grateful for its forcing him to engage socially. On the SAT (Scholastic Aptitude Test) exams, he scored 148 out of 150 in the written section but 5 out of 150 in mathematics, to the consternation of his teachers.\n\nAfter his mother's death when he was 18, Gibson left school without graduating and became very isolated for a long time, traveling to California and Europe, and immersing himself in the counterculture. In 1967, he elected to move to Canada in order \"to avoid the Vietnam war draft\". At his draft hearing, he honestly informed interviewers that his intention in life was to sample every mind-altering substance in existence. Gibson has observed that he \"did not literally evade the draft, as they never bothered drafting me\"; after the hearing he went home and purchased a bus ticket to Toronto, and left a week or two later. In the biographical documentary \"No Maps for These Territories\" (2000), Gibson said that his decision was motivated less by conscientious objection than by a desire to \"sleep with hippie chicks\" and indulge in hashish. He elaborated on the topic in a 2008 interview:\n\nAfter weeks of nominal homelessness, Gibson was hired as the manager of Toronto's first head shop, a retailer of drug paraphernalia. He found the city's émigré community of American draft dodgers unbearable owing to the prevalence of clinical depression, suicide, and hardcore substance abuse. He appeared, during the Summer of Love of 1967, in a CBC newsreel item about hippie subculture in Yorkville, Toronto, for which he was paid $500 – the equivalent of 20 weeks rent – which financed his later travels. Aside from a \"brief, riot-torn spell\" in the District of Columbia, Gibson spent the rest of the 1960s in Toronto, where he met Vancouverite Deborah Jean Thompson, with whom he subsequently traveled to Europe. Gibson has recounted that they concentrated their travels on European nations with fascist regimes and favorable exchange rates, including spending time on a Greek archipelago and in Istanbul in 1970, as they \"couldn't afford to stay anywhere that had anything remotely like hard currency\".\n\nThe couple married and settled in Vancouver, British Columbia in 1972, with Gibson looking after their first child while they lived off his wife's teaching salary. During the 1970s, Gibson made a substantial part of his living from scouring Salvation Army thrift stores for underpriced artifacts he would then up-market to specialist dealers. Realizing that it was easier to sustain high college grades, and thus qualify for generous student financial aid, than to work, he enrolled at the University of British Columbia (UBC), earning \"a desultory bachelor's degree in English\" in 1977. Through studying English literature, he was exposed to a wider range of fiction than he would have read otherwise; something he credits with giving him ideas inaccessible from within the culture of science fiction, including an awareness of postmodernity. It was at UBC that he attended his first course on science fiction, taught by Susan Wood, at the end of which he was encouraged to write his first short story, \"Fragments of a Hologram Rose\".\n\nAfter considering pursuing a master's degree on the topic of hard science fiction novels as fascist literature, Gibson discontinued writing in the year that followed graduation and, as one critic put it, expanded his collection of punk records. During this period he worked at various jobs, including a three-year stint as teaching assistant on a film history course at his alma mater. Impatient at much of what he saw at a science fiction convention in Vancouver in 1980 or 1981, Gibson found a kindred spirit in fellow panelist, punk musician and author John Shirley. The two became immediate and lifelong friends. Shirley persuaded Gibson to sell his early short stories and to take writing seriously.\n\nThrough Shirley, Gibson came into contact with science fiction authors Bruce Sterling and Lewis Shiner; reading Gibson's work, they realized that it was, as Sterling put it, \"breakthrough material\" and that they needed to \"put down our preconceptions and pick up on this guy from Vancouver; this [was] the way forward.\" Gibson met Sterling at a science fiction convention in Denver, Colorado in the autumn of 1981, where he read \"Burning Chrome\" – the first cyberspace short story – to an audience of four people, and later stated that Sterling \"completely got it\".\n\nIn October 1982, Gibson traveled to Austin, Texas for ArmadilloCon, at which he appeared with Shirley, Sterling and Shiner on a panel called \"Behind the Mirrorshades: A Look at Punk SF\", where Shiner noted \"the sense of a movement solidified\". After a weekend discussing rock and roll, MTV, Japan, fashion, drugs and politics, Gibson left the cadre for Vancouver, declaring half-jokingly that \"a new axis has been formed.\" Sterling, Shiner, Shirley and Gibson, along with Rudy Rucker, went on to form the core of the radical cyberpunk literary movement.\n\nGibson's early writings are generally near-future stories about the influences of cybernetics and cyberspace (computer-simulated reality) technology on the human race. His themes of hi-tech shanty towns, recorded or broadcast stimulus (later to be developed into the \"sim-stim\" package featured so heavily in \"Neuromancer\"), and dystopic intermingling of technology and humanity, are already evident in his first published short story, \"Fragments of a Hologram Rose\", in the Summer 1977 issue of \"Unearth\". The latter thematic obsession was described by his friend and fellow author, Bruce Sterling, in the introduction of Gibson's short story collection \"Burning Chrome\", as \"Gibson's classic one-two combination of lowlife and high tech.\"\n\nBeginning in 1981, Gibson's stories appeared in \"Omni\" and \"Universe 11\", wherein his fiction developed a bleak, \"film noir\" feel. He consciously distanced himself as far as possible from the mainstream of science fiction (towards which he felt \"an aesthetic revulsion\", expressed in \"The Gernsback Continuum\"), to the extent that his highest goal was to become \"a minor cult figure, a sort of lesser Ballard.\" When Sterling started to distribute the stories, he found that \"people were just genuinely baffled ... I mean they literally could not parse the guy's paragraphs ... the imaginative tropes he was inventing were just beyond peoples' grasp.\"\n\nWhile Larry McCaffery has commented that these early short stories displayed flashes of Gibson's ability, science fiction critic Darko Suvin has identified them as \"undoubtedly [cyberpunk's] best works\", constituting the \"furthest horizon\" of the genre. The themes which Gibson developed in the stories, the Sprawl setting of \"Burning Chrome\" and the character of Molly Millions from \"Johnny Mnemonic\" ultimately culminated in his first novel, \"Neuromancer\".\n\n\"Neuromancer\" was commissioned by Terry Carr for the second series of Ace Science Fiction Specials, which was intended to exclusively feature debut novels. Given a year to complete the work, Gibson undertook the actual writing out of \"blind animal terror\" at the obligation to write an entire novel – a feat which he felt he was \"four or five years away from\". After viewing the first 20 minutes of landmark cyberpunk film \"Blade Runner\" (1982) which was released when Gibson had written a third of the novel, he \"figured [\"Neuromancer\"] was sunk, done for. Everyone would assume I'd copped my visual texture from this astonishingly fine-looking film.\" He re-wrote the first two-thirds of the book twelve times, feared losing the reader's attention and was convinced that he would be \"permanently shamed\" following its publication; yet what resulted was a major imaginative leap forward for a first-time novelist.\n\"Neuromancer\"'s release was not greeted with fanfare, but it hit a cultural nerve, quickly becoming an underground word-of-mouth hit. It became the first winner of one science fiction \"triple crown\" —both Nebula and Hugo Awards as the year's best novel and Philip K. Dick Award as the best paperback original— eventually selling more than 6.5 million copies worldwide.\n\nLawrence Person in his \"Notes Toward a Postcyberpunk Manifesto\" (1998) identified \"Neuromancer\" as \"the archetypal cyberpunk work\", and in 2005, \"Time\" included it in its list of the 100 best English-language novels written since 1923, opining that \"[t]here is no way to overstate how radical [\"Neuromancer\"] was when it first appeared.\" Literary critic Larry McCaffery described the concept of the matrix in \"Neuromancer\" as a place where \"data dance with human consciousness ... human memory is literalized and mechanized ... multi-national information systems mutate and breed into startling new structures whose beauty and complexity are unimaginable, mystical, and above all nonhuman.\" Gibson later commented on himself as an author, circa \"Neuromancer\", that \"I'd buy him a drink, but I don't know if I'd loan him any money,\" and referred to the novel as \"an adolescent's book\". The success of \"Neuromancer\" was to effect the 35-year-old Gibson's emergence from obscurity.\n\nAlthough much of Gibson's reputation has remained rooted in \"Neuromancer\", his work continued to evolve conceptually and stylistically. Despite adding the final sentence of \"Neuromancer\", \"He never saw Molly again\", at the last minute in a deliberate attempt to prevent himself from ever writing a sequel, he did precisely that with \"Count Zero\" (1986), a character-focused work set in the Sprawl alluded to in its predecessor. He next intended to write an unrelated postmodern space opera, titled \"The Log of the Mustang Sally\", but reneged on the contract with Arbor House after a falling out over the dustjacket art of their hardcover of \"Count Zero\". Abandoning \"The Log of the Mustang Sally\", Gibson instead wrote \"Mona Lisa Overdrive\" (1988), which in the words of Larry McCaffery \"turned off the lights\" on cyberpunk literature. It was a culmination of his previous two novels, set in the same universe with shared characters, thereby completing the Sprawl trilogy. The trilogy solidified Gibson's reputation, with both later novels also earning Nebula and Hugo Award and Locus SF Award nominations.\n\nThe Sprawl trilogy was followed by the 1990 novel \"The Difference Engine\", an alternative history novel Gibson wrote in collaboration with Bruce Sterling. Set in a technologically advanced Victorian era Britain, the novel was a departure from the authors' cyberpunk roots. It was nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1991 and the John W. Campbell Memorial Award in 1992, and its success drew attention to the nascent steampunk literary genre of which it remains the best-known work.\n\nGibson's second series, the \"Bridge trilogy\", is composed of \"Virtual Light\" (1993), a \"darkly comic urban detective story\", \"Idoru\" (1996), and \"All Tomorrow's Parties\" (1999). The first and third books in the trilogy center on San Francisco in the near future; all three explore Gibson's recurring themes of technological, physical, and spiritual transcendence in a more grounded, matter-of-fact style than his first trilogy. Salon.com's Andrew Leonard notes that in the Bridge trilogy, Gibson's villains change from multinational corporations and artificial intelligences of the Sprawl trilogy to the mass media – namely tabloid television and the cult of celebrity. \"Virtual Light\" depicts an \"end-stage capitalism, in which private enterprise and the profit motive are taken to their logical conclusion\". This argument on the mass media as the natural evolution of capitalism is the opening line of the major Situationist work \"The Society of the Spectacle\". Leonard's review called \"Idoru\" a \"return to form\" for Gibson, while critic Steven Poole asserted that \"All Tomorrow's Parties\" marked his development from \"science-fiction hotshot to wry sociologist of the near future.\"\n\nAfter \"All Tomorrow's Parties\", Gibson began to adopt a more realist style of writing, with continuous narratives – \"speculative fiction of the very recent past.\" Science fiction critic John Clute has interpreted this approach as Gibson's recognition that traditional science fiction is no longer possible \"in a world lacking coherent 'nows' to continue from\", characterizing it as \"SF for the new century\". Gibson's novels \"Pattern Recognition\" (2003), \"Spook Country\" (2007) and \"Zero History\" (2010) are set in the same contemporary universe — \"more or less the same one we live in now\" — and put Gibson's work onto mainstream bestseller lists for the first time. As well as the setting, the novels share some of the same characters, including Hubertus Bigend and Pamela Mainwaring, employees of the enigmatic marketing company Blue Ant.\n\nWhen asked, on Twitter, what this series of novels should be called (\"The Bigend Trilogy? The Blue Ant Cycle? What?\"), Gibson replied \"I prefer 'books'. The Bigend books.\" However, \"Blue Ant\" rather than \"Bigend\" has become the standard signifier. At a later date, Gibson stated that he did not name his trilogies, \"I wait to see what people call them,\" and has in 2016 used \"the Blue Ant books\" in a tweet.\n\nA phenomenon peculiar to this era was the independent development of annotating fansites, \"PR-Otaku\" and \"Node Magazine\", devoted to \"Pattern Recognition\" and \"Spook Country\" respectively. These websites tracked the references and story elements in the novels through online resources such as Google and Wikipedia and collated the results, essentially creating hypertext versions of the books. Critic John Sutherland characterized this phenomenon as threatening \"to completely overhaul the way literary criticism is conducted\".\n\nAfter the September 11, 2001 attacks, with about 100 pages of \"Pattern Recognition\" written, Gibson had to re-write the main character's backstory, which had been suddenly rendered implausible; he called it \"the strangest experience I've ever had with a piece of fiction.\" He saw the attacks as a nodal point in history, \"an experience out of culture\", and \"in some ways ... the true beginning of the 21st century.\" He is noted as one of the first novelists to use the attacks to inform his writing. Examination of cultural changes in post-September 11 America, including a resurgent tribalism and the \"infantilization of society\", became a prominent theme of Gibson's work. The focus of his writing nevertheless remains \"at the intersection of paranoia and technology\".\n\nWilliam Gibson's most recent novel is titled \"The Peripheral\". He described the story briefly in an appearance he made at the New York Public Library on April 19, 2013, and read an excerpt from the first chapter of the book entitled \"The Gone Haptics.\" The story takes place in two eras, one about thirty years into the future and the other further in the future. \"The Peripheral\" was released on October 28, 2014.\n\nIts continuation, \"Agency\", is to be released on April 2, 2019, after being delayed from an initial announced release date of December 2018.\n\nIn 2017, Gibson's comic/graphic novel \"Archangel\" was published. Both \"Archangel\" and \"The Peripheral\" contain time travel (of sorts), but Gibson has clarified that the works are not related: \"They're not \"same universe\". The Splitter and trans-continual virtuality are different mechanisms (different plot mechanisms too).\"\n\nThree of the stories that later appeared in \"Burning Chrome\" were written in collaboration with other authors: \"The Belonging Kind\" (1981) with John Shirley, \"Red Star, Winter Orbit\" (1983) with Sterling, and \"Dogfight\" (1985) with Michael Swanwick. Gibson had previously written the foreword to Shirley's 1980 novel \"City Come A-walkin\" and the pair's collaboration continued when Gibson wrote the introduction to Shirley's short story collection \"Heatseeker\" (1989). Shirley convinced Gibson to write a story for the television series \"Max Headroom\" for which Shirley had written several scripts, but the network canceled the series.\n\nGibson and Sterling collaborated again on the short story \"The Angel of Goliad\" in 1990, which they soon expanded into the novel-length alternate history story \"The Difference Engine\" (1990). The two were later \"invited to dream in public\" (Gibson) in a joint address to the U.S. National Academy of Sciences Convocation on Technology and Education in 1993 (\"the Al Gore people\"), in which they argued against the digital divide and \"appalled everyone\" by proposing that all schools be put online, with education taking place over the Internet. In a 2007 interview, Gibson revealed that Sterling had an idea for \"a second recursive science novel that was just a wonderful idea\", but that Gibson was unable to pursue the collaboration because he was not creatively free at the time.\n\nIn 1993, Gibson contributed lyrics and featured as a guest vocalist on Yellow Magic Orchestra's \"Technodon\" album, and wrote lyrics to the track \"Dog Star Girl\" for Deborah Harry's \"Debravation\".\n\nGibson was first solicited to work as a screenwriter after a film producer discovered a waterlogged copy of \"Neuromancer\" on a beach at a Thai resort. His early efforts to write film scripts failed to manifest themselves as finished product; \"Burning Chrome\" (which was to be directed by Kathryn Bigelow) and \"Neuro-Hotel\" were two attempts by the author at film adaptations that were never made. In the late 1980s he wrote an early version of \"Alien 3\" (which he later characterized as \"Tarkovskian\"), few elements of which survived in the final version.\nGibson's early involvement with the film industry extended far beyond the confines of the Hollywood blockbuster system. At one point, he collaborated on a script with Kazakh director Rashid Nugmanov after an American producer had expressed an interest in a Soviet-American collaboration to star Soviet rock musician Viktor Tsoi. Despite being occupied with writing a novel, Gibson was reluctant to abandon the \"wonderfully odd project\" which involved \"ritualistic gang-warfare in some sort of sideways-future Leningrad\" and sent Jack Womack to Russia in his stead. Rather than producing a motion picture, a prospect that ended with Tsoi's death in a car crash, Womack's experiences in Russia ultimately culminated in his novel \"Let's Put the Future Behind Us\" and informed much of the Russian content of Gibson's \"Pattern Recognition\". A similar fate befell Gibson's collaboration with Japanese filmmaker Sogo Ishii in 1991, a film they planned on shooting in the Walled City of Kowloon until the city was demolished in 1993.\n\nAdaptations of Gibson's fiction have frequently been optioned and proposed, to limited success. Two of the author's short stories, both set in the Sprawl trilogy universe, have been loosely adapted as films: \"Johnny Mnemonic\" (1995) with screenplay by Gibson and starring Keanu Reeves, Dolph Lundgren and Takeshi Kitano, and \"New Rose Hotel\" (1998), starring Christopher Walken, Willem Dafoe, and Asia Argento. The former was the first time in history that a book was launched simultaneously as a film and a CD-ROM interactive video game. , Vincenzo Natali still hoped to bring \"Neuromancer\" to the screen, after some years in development hell. \"Count Zero\" was at one point being developed as \"The Zen Differential\" with director Michael Mann attached, and the third novel in the Sprawl trilogy, \"Mona Lisa Overdrive\", has also been optioned and bought. An anime adaptation of \"Idoru\" was announced as in development in 2006, and \"Pattern Recognition\" was in the process of development by director Peter Weir, although according to Gibson the latter is no longer attached to the project. Announced at International Film Festival Rotterdam in 2015 is an adaptation of Gibson's short story \"Dogfight\" by BAFTA award-winning writer and director Simon Pummell. Written by Gibson and Michael Swanwick and first published in Omni in July 1985, the film is being developed by British producer Janine Marmot at Hot Property Films.\n\nTelevision is another arena in which Gibson has collaborated; he co-wrote with friend Tom Maddox, \"The X-Files\" episodes \"Kill Switch\" and \"First Person Shooter\", broadcast in the U.S. on 20th Century Fox Television in 1998 and 2000. In 1998 he contributed the introduction to the spin-off publication \"Art of the X-Files\". Gibson made a cameo appearance in the television miniseries \"Wild Palms\" at the behest of creator Bruce Wagner. Director Oliver Stone had borrowed heavily from Gibson's novels to make the series, and in the aftermath of its cancellation Gibson contributed an article, \"Where The Holograms Go\", to the \"Wild Palms Reader\". He accepted another acting role in 2002, appearing alongside Douglas Coupland in the short film \"Mon Amour Mon Parapluie\" in which the pair played philosophers. Appearances in fiction aside, Gibson was the focus of a biographical documentary by Mark Neale in 2000 called \"No Maps for These Territories\". The film follows Gibson over the course of a drive across North America discussing various aspects of his life, literary career and cultural interpretations. It features interviews with Jack Womack and Bruce Sterling, as well as recitations from \"Neuromancer\" by Bono and The Edge.\n\nLast Studio Standing Inc., a Canadian-based animation studio, acquired the rights to \"Hinterlands\" in 2016 and announced that they will be creating both a theatrical short film and a television series. The studio, which specializes in adult and science fiction based animation, has the theatrical short slated for a 2018 release.\n\nAs of April 2018, Amazon is developing a series based on Gibson's novel \"The Peripheral\".\n\nGibson has contributed text to be integrated into a number of performance art pieces. In October 1989, Gibson wrote text for such a collaboration with acclaimed sculptor and future \"Johnny Mnemonic\" director Robert Longo titled \"Dream Jumbo: Working the Absolutes\", which was displayed in Royce Hall, University of California Los Angeles. Three years later, Gibson contributed original text to \"Memory Palace\", a performance show featuring the theater group La Fura dels Baus at Art Futura '92, Barcelona, which featured images by Karl Sims, Rebecca Allen, Mark Pellington with music by Peter Gabriel and others. It was at Art Futura '92 that Gibson met Charlie Athanas, who would later act as dramaturg and \"cyberprops\" designer on Steve Pickering and Charley Sherman's adaptation of \"Burning Chrome\" for the Chicago stage. Gibson's latest contribution was in 1997, a collaboration with critically acclaimed Vancouver-based contemporary dance company Holy Body Tattoo and Gibson's friend and future webmaster Christopher Halcrow.\n\nIn 1990, Gibson contributed to \"Visionary San Francisco\", an exhibition at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art shown from June 14 to August 26. He wrote a short story, \"Skinner's Room\", set in a decaying San Francisco in which the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge was closed and taken over by the homeless – a setting Gibson then detailed in the Bridge trilogy. The story inspired a contribution to the exhibition by architects Ming Fung and Craig Hodgetts that envisioned a San Francisco in which the rich live in high-tech, solar-powered towers, above the decrepit city and its crumbling bridge. The architects exhibit featured Gibson on a monitor discussing the future and reading from \"Skinner's Room\". \"The New York Times\" hailed the exhibition as \"one of the most ambitious, and admirable, efforts to address the realm of architecture and cities that any museum in the country has mounted in the last decade\", despite calling Ming and Hodgetts's reaction to Gibson's contribution \"a powerful, but sad and not a little cynical, work\". A slightly different version of the short story was featured a year later in \"Omni\".\n\nA particularly well-received work by Gibson was \"Agrippa (a book of the dead)\" (1992), a 300-line semi-autobiographical electronic poem that was his contribution to a collaborative project with artist Dennis Ashbaugh and publisher Kevin Begos, Jr. Gibson's text focused on the ethereal nature of memories (the title refers to a photo album) and was originally published on a 3.5\" floppy disk embedded in the back of an artist's book containing etchings by Ashbaugh (intended to fade from view once the book was opened and exposed to light — they never did, however). Gibson commented that Ashbaugh's design \"eventually included a supposedly self-devouring floppy-disk intended to display the text only once, then eat itself.\" Contrary to numerous colorful reports, the diskettes were never actually \"hacked\"; instead the poem was manually transcribed from a surreptitious videotape of a public showing in Manhattan in December 1992, and released on the MindVox bulletin board the next day; this is the text that circulated widely on the Internet.\n\nSince its debut in 1992, the mystery of \"Agrippa\" remained hidden for 20 years. Although many had tried to hack the code and decrypt the program, the uncompiled source code was lost long ago. Alan Liu and his team at \"The Agrippa Files\" created an extensive website with tools and resources to crack the Agrippa Code. They collaborated with Matthew Kirschenbaum at the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities and the Digital Forensics Lab, and Quinn DuPont, a PhD student of cryptography from the University of Toronto, in calling for the aid of cryptographers to figure out how the program works by creating \"Cracking the Agrippa Code: The Challenge\", which enlisted participants to solve the intentional scrambling of the poem in exchange for prizes. The code was successfully cracked by Robert Xiao in late July 2012.\n\nGibson is a sporadic contributor of non-fiction articles to newspapers and journals. He has been a sporadic contributor of longer-form articles to \"Wired\" and of op-eds to \"The New York Times\", and has written for \"The Observer\", \"Addicted to Noise\", \"New York Times Magazine\", \"Rolling Stone\", and \"Details Magazine\". His first major piece of nonfiction, the article \"Disneyland with the Death Penalty\" concerning the city-state of Singapore, resulted in \"Wired\" being banned from the country and attracted a spirited critical response. He commenced writing a blog in January 2003, providing voyeuristic insights into his reaction to \"Pattern Recognition\", but abated in September of the same year owing to concerns that it might negatively affect his creative process.\n\nGibson recommenced blogging in October 2004, and during the process of writing \"Spook Country\" – and to a lesser extent \"Zero History\" – frequently posted short nonsequential excerpts from the novel to the blog. The blog was largely discontinued by July 2009, after the writer had undertaken prolific microblogging on Twitter under the \"nom de plume\" \"GreatDismal\". In 2012, Gibson released a collection of his non-fiction works entitled \"Distrust That Particular Flavor\".\n\nHailed by Steven Poole of \"The Guardian\" in 1999 as \"probably the most important novelist of the past two decades\" in terms of influence, Gibson first achieved critical recognition with his debut novel, \"Neuromancer\". The novel won three major science fiction awards (the Nebula Award, the Philip K. Dick Award, and the Hugo Award), an unprecedented achievement described by the \"Mail & Guardian\" as \"the sci-fi writer's version of winning the Goncourt, Booker and Pulitzer prizes in the same year\". \"Neuromancer\" gained unprecedented critical and popular attention outside science fiction, as an \"evocation of life in the late 1980s\", although \"The Observer\" noted that \"it took the \"New York Times\" 10 years\" to mention the novel.\n\nGibson's work has received international attention from an audience that was not limited to science fiction aficionados as, in the words of Laura Miller, \"readers found startlingly prophetic reflections of contemporary life in [its] fantastic and often outright paranoid scenarios.\" It is often situated by critics within the context of postindustrialism as, according to academic David Brande, a construction of \"a mirror of existing large-scale techno-social relations\", and as a narrative version of postmodern consumer culture. It is praised by critics for its depictions of late capitalism and its \"rewriting of subjectivity, human consciousness and behaviour made newly problematic by technology.\" Tatiani Rapatzikou, writing in \"The Literary Encyclopedia\", identifies Gibson as \"one of North America's most highly acclaimed science fiction writers\".\n\nIn his early short fiction, Gibson is credited by Rapatzikou in \"The Literary Encyclopedia\" with effectively \"renovating\" science fiction, a genre at that time considered widely \"insignificant\", influencing by means of the postmodern aesthetic of his writing the development of new perspectives in science fiction studies. In the words of filmmaker Marianne Trench, Gibson's visions \"struck sparks in the real world\" and \"determined the way people thought and talked\" to an extent unprecedented in science fiction literature. The publication of \"Neuromancer\" (1984) hit a cultural nerve, causing Larry McCaffery to credit Gibson with virtually launching the cyberpunk movement, as \"the one major writer who is original and gifted to make the whole movement seem original and gifted.\" Aside from their central importance to cyberpunk and steampunk fiction, Gibson's fictional works have been hailed by space historian Dwayne A. Day as some of the best examples of space-based science fiction (or \"solar sci-fi\"), and \"probably the only ones that rise above mere escapism to be truly thought-provoking\".\n\nGibson's early novels were, according to \"The Observer\", \"seized upon by the emerging slacker and hacker generation as a kind of road map\". \nThrough his novels, such terms as \"cyberspace\", \"netsurfing\", \"ICE\", \"jacking in\", and \"neural implants\" entered popular usage, as did concepts such as net consciousness, virtual interaction and \"the matrix\". In \"Burning Chrome\" (1982), he coined the term \"cyberspace\", referring to the \"mass consensual hallucination\" of computer networks. Through its use in \"Neuromancer\", the term gained such recognition that it became the \"de facto\" term for the World Wide Web during the 1990s. Artist Dike Blair has commented that Gibson's \"terse descriptive phrases capture the moods which surround technologies, rather than their engineering.\"\n\nGibson's work has influenced several popular musicians: references to his fiction appear in the music of Stuart Hamm, Billy Idol, Warren Zevon, Deltron 3030, Straylight Run (whose name is derived from a sequence in \"Neuromancer\") and Sonic Youth. U2's \"Zooropa\" album was heavily influenced by \"Neuromancer\", and the band at one point planned to scroll the text of \"Neuromancer\" above them on a concert tour, although this did not end up happening. Members of the band did, however, provide background music for the audiobook version of \"Neuromancer\" as well as appearing in \"No Maps for These Territories\", a biographical documentary of Gibson. He returned the favour by writing an article about the band's Vertigo Tour for \"Wired\" in August 2005. The band Zeromancer take their name from \"Neuromancer\".\n\nThe film \"The Matrix\" (1999) drew inspiration for its title, characters and story elements from the Sprawl trilogy. The characters of Neo and Trinity in \"The Matrix\" are similar to Bobby Newmark (\"Count Zero\") and Molly (\"Johnny Mnemonic\", \"Neuromancer\"). Like Turner, protagonist of Gibson's \"Count Zero\", characters in \"The Matrix\" download instructions (to fly a helicopter and to \"know kung fu\", respectively) directly into their heads, and both \"Neuromancer\" and \"The Matrix\" feature artificial intelligences which strive to free themselves from human control. Critics have identified marked similarities between \"Neuromancer\" and the film's cinematography and tone. In spite of his initial reticence about seeing the film on its release, Gibson later described it as \"arguably the ultimate 'cyberpunk' artifact.\" In 2008 he received honorary doctorates from Simon Fraser University and Coastal Carolina University.\n\nIn \"Neuromancer\", Gibson first used the term \"matrix\" to refer to the visualized Internet, two years after the nascent Internet was formed in the early 1980s from the computer networks of the 1970s. Gibson thereby imagined a worldwide communications network years before the origin of the World Wide Web, although related notions had previously been imagined by others, including science fiction writers. At the time he wrote \"Burning Chrome\", Gibson \"had a hunch that [the Internet] would change things, in the same way that the ubiquity of the automobile changed things.\" In 1995, he identified the advent, evolution and growth of the Internet as \"one of the most fascinating and unprecedented human achievements of the century\", a new kind of civilization that is – in terms of significance — on a par with the birth of cities, and in 2000 predicted it would lead to the death of the nation state.\n\nObservers contend that Gibson's influence on the development of the Web reached beyond prediction; he is widely credited with creating an iconography for the information age, long before the embrace of the Internet by the mainstream. Gibson introduced, in \"Neuromancer\", the notion of the \"meatpuppet\", and is credited with inventing—conceptually rather than participatorally—the phenomenon of virtual sex. His influence on early pioneers of desktop environment digital art has been acknowledged, and he holds an honorary doctorate from Parsons The New School for Design. Steven Poole claims that in writing the Sprawl trilogy Gibson laid the \"conceptual foundations for the explosive real-world growth of virtual environments in video games and the Web\". In his afterword to the 2000 re-issue of \"Neuromancer\", fellow author Jack Womack suggests that Gibson's vision of cyberspace may have inspired the way in which the Internet (and the Web particularly) developed, following the publication of \"Neuromancer\" in 1984, asking \"what if the act of writing it down, in fact, \"brought it about\"?\"\nGibson scholar Tatiani G. Rapatzikou has commented, in \"Gothic Motifs in the Fiction of William Gibson\", on the origin of the notion of cyberspace:\nIn his Sprawl and Bridge trilogies, Gibson is credited with being one of the few observers to explore the portents of the information age for notions of the sociospatial structuring of cities. Not all responses to Gibson's visions have been positive, however; virtual reality pioneer Mark Pesce, though acknowledging their heavy influence on him and that \"no other writer had so eloquently and emotionally affected the direction of the hacker community,\" dismissed them as \"adolescent fantasies of violence and disembodiment.\" In \"Pattern Recognition\", the plot revolves around snippets of film footage posted anonymously to various locations on the Internet. Characters in the novel speculate about the filmmaker's identity, motives, methods and inspirations on several websites, anticipating the 2006 lonelygirl15 internet phenomenon. However, Gibson later disputed the notion that the creators of lonelygirl15 drew influence from him. Another phenomenon anticipated by Gibson is the rise of reality television, for example in \"Virtual Light\", which featured a satirical extrapolated version of \"COPS\".\n\nWhen an interviewer in 1988 asked about the Bulletin Board System jargon in his writing, Gibson answered \"I'd never so much as touched a PC when I wrote \"Neuromancer\"\"; he was familiar, he said, with the science-fiction community, which overlapped with the BBS community. Gibson similarly did not play computer games despite appearing in his stories. He wrote \"Neuromancer\" on a 1927 olive-green Hermes portable typewriter, which Gibson described as \"the kind of thing Hemingway would have used in the field\". By 1988 he used an Apple IIc and AppleWorks to write, with a modem (\"I don't really use it for anything\"), but until 1996 Gibson did not have an email address, a lack he explained at the time to have been motivated by a desire to avoid correspondence that would distract him from writing. His first exposure to a website came while writing \"Idoru\" when a web developer built one for Gibson. In 2007 he said, \"I have a 2005 PowerBook G4, a gig of memory, wireless router. That's it. I'm anything but an early adopter, generally. In fact, I've never really been very interested in computers themselves. I don't watch them; I watch how people behave around them. That's becoming more difficult to do because everything is 'around them'.\"\n\n. \"The New York Times Magazine\" and Gibson himself report his age at the time of his father's death to be six years old, while Gibson scholar Tatiani Rapatzikou claims in \"The Literary Encyclopedia\" that he was eight years old.\n. Several track names on Hamm's \"Kings of Sleep\" album (\"Black Ice\", \"Count Zero\", \"Kings of Sleep\") reference Gibson's work.\n. Idol released an album in 1993 titled \"Cyberpunk\", which featured a track named \"Neuromancer\". Robert Christgau excoriated Idol's treatment of cyberpunk, and Gibson later stated that Idol had \"turned it into something very silly.\"\n. Zevon's 1989 album \"Transverse City\" was inspired by Gibson's fiction.\n. Gibson later successfully resisted attempts by Autodesk to copyright the word for their abortive foray into virtual reality.\n. Both the Internet with its dramatic social effects and the cyberpunk genre itself were also anticipated in John Brunner's 1975 novel \"The Shockwave Rider\".\n. The idea of a globally interconnected set of computers through which everyone could quickly access data and programs from any site was first described in 1962 in a series of memos on the \"Galactic Computer Network\" by J.C.R. Licklider of DARPA.\n. Gibson wrote the following in the \"Author's Afterword\" of \"Mona Lisa Overdrive\", dated July 16, 1992.\n\n\"Neuromancer\" was written on a \"clockwork typewriter,\" the very one you may recall glimpsing in Julie Deane's office in Chiba City. This machine, a Hermes 2000 manual portable, dates from somewhere in the 1930's. It's a very tough and elegant piece of work, from the factory of E. PAILLARD & Cie S.A. YVERDON (SUISSE). Cased, it weighs slightly less than the Macintosh SE/30 I now write on, and is finished in a curious green- and-black \"crackle\" paint-job, perhaps meant to suggest the covers of an accountant's ledger. Its keys are green as well, of celluloid, and the letters and symbols on them are canary yellow. (I once happened to brush the shift-key with the tip of a lit cigarette, dramatically confirming the extreme flammability of this early plastic.) In its day, the Hermes 2000 was one of the best portable writing-machines in the world, and one of the most expensive. This one belonged to my wife's step-grandfather, who had been a journalist of sorts and had used it to compose laudatory essays on the poetry of Robert Burns. I used it first to write undergraduate Eng. lit. papers, then my early attempts at short stories, then Neuromancer, all without so much as ever having touched an actual computer.\n\n"}
{"id": "207021", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=207021", "title": "William Stanley Jevons", "text": "William Stanley Jevons\n\nWilliam Stanley Jevons FRS (; 1 September 1835 – 13 August 1882) was an English economist and logician.\n\nIrving Fisher described Jevons's book \"A General Mathematical Theory of Political Economy\" (1862) as the start of the mathematical method in economics. It made the case that economics as a science concerned with quantities is necessarily mathematical. In so doing, it expounded upon the \"final\" (marginal) utility theory of value. Jevons's work, along with similar discoveries made by Carl Menger in Vienna (1871) and by Léon Walras in Switzerland (1874), marked the opening of a new period in the history of economic thought. Jevons's contribution to the marginal revolution in economics in the late 19th century established his reputation as a leading political economist and logician of the time.\n\nJevons broke off his studies of the natural sciences in London in 1854 to work as an assayer in Sydney, where he acquired an interest in political economy. Returning to the UK in 1859, he published \"General Mathematical Theory of Political Economy\" in 1862, outlining the marginal utility theory of value, and \"A Serious Fall in the Value of Gold\" in 1863. For Jevons, the utility or value to a consumer of an additional unit of a product is inversely related to the number of units of that product he already owns, at least beyond some critical quantity.\n\nJevons received public recognition for his work on \"The Coal Question\" (1865), in which he called attention to the gradual exhaustion of Britain's coal supplies and also put forth the view that increases in energy production efficiency leads to more, not less, consumption. This view is known today as the Jevons paradox, named after him. Due to this particular work, Jevons is regarded today as the first economist of some standing to develop an 'ecological' perspective on the economy. \n\nThe most important of his works on logic and scientific methods is his \"Principles of Science\" (1874), as well as \"The Theory of Political Economy\" (1871) and \"The State in Relation to Labour\" (1882). Among his inventions was the logic piano, a mechanical computer.\n\nJevons was born in Liverpool, Lancashire, England. His father, Thomas Jevons, was an iron merchant who wrote about legal and economic subjects as well. His mother Mary Anne Jevons was the daughter of William Roscoe. At the age of fifteen he was sent to London to attend the University College School. Around this time, he seemed to have formed the belief that he was capable of important achievements as a thinker. Towards the end of 1853, after having spent two years at University College, where his favourite subjects were chemistry and botany, he received an offer as metallurgical assayer for the new mint in Australia. The idea of leaving the UK was distasteful, but pecuniary considerations had, in consequence of the failure of his father's firm in 1847, become of vital importance, and he accepted the post.\n\nJevons left the UK for Sydney in June 1854 to take up a role as an Assayer at the Mint. Jevons lived with his colleague and his wife first at Church Hill, then in Annangrove at Petersham and at Double Bay before returning to England. In letters to his family he described his life, took photographs and produced a social map of Sydney. Jevons returned to England via America five years later.\n\nHe resigned his appointment, and in the autumn of 1859 re-entered the University College London as a student. He was granted B.A. and M.A. degrees from the University of London. He now gave his principal attention to the moral sciences, but his interest in natural science was by no means exhausted: throughout his life he continued to write occasional papers on scientific subjects, and his knowledge of the physical sciences greatly contributed to the success of his chief logical work, \"The Principles of Science\". Not long after taking his M.A. degree, Jevons obtained a post as tutor at Owens College, Manchester.\n\nIn 1866, he was elected professor of logic and mental and moral philosophy and Cobden professor of political economy at Owens College. \n\nJevons arrived quite early in his career at the doctrines that constituted his most characteristic and original contributions to economics and logic. The theory of utility, which became the keynote of his general theory of political economy, was practically formulated in a letter written in 1860; and the germ of his logical principles of the substitution of similars may be found in the view which he propounded in another letter written in 1861, that \"philosophy would be found to consist solely in pointing out the likeness of things.\" The theory of utility above referred to, namely, that the degree of utility of a commodity is some continuous mathematical function of the quantity of the commodity available, together with the implied doctrine that economics is essentially a mathematical science, took more definite form in a paper on \"A General Mathematical Theory of Political Economy\", written for the British Association in 1862. This paper does not appear to have attracted much attention either in 1862 or on its publication four years later in the \"Journal of the Statistical Society\"; and it was not till 1871, when the \"Theory of Political Economy\" appeared, that Jevons set forth his doctrines in a fully developed form.\n\nIt was not until after the publication of this work that Jevons became acquainted with the applications of mathematics to political economy made by earlier writers, notably Antoine Augustin Cournot and H.H. Gossen. The theory of utility was at about 1870 being independently developed on somewhat similar lines by Carl Menger in Austria and Léon Walras in Switzerland. As regards the discovery of the connection between value in exchange and final (or marginal) utility, the priority belongs to Gossen, but this in no way detracts from the great importance of the service which Jevons rendered to British economics by his fresh discovery of the principle, and by the way in which he ultimately forced it into notice. In his reaction from the prevailing view he sometimes expressed himself without due qualification: the declaration, for instance, made at the commencement of the \"Theory of Political Economy\", that value depends entirely upon utility, lent itself to misinterpretation. But a certain exaggeration of emphasis may be pardoned in a writer seeking to attract the attention of an indifferent public. The Neoclassical Revolution, which would reshape economics, had been started.\n\nJevons did not explicitly distinguish between the concepts of ordinal and cardinal utility. Cardinal utility allows the relative magnitude of utilities to be discussed, while ordinal utility only implies that goods can be compared and ranked according to which good provided the most utility. Although Jevons predated the debate about ordinality or cardinality of utility, his mathematics required the use of cardinal utility functions. For example, in \"The Theory of Political Economy\", Chapter II, the subsection on \"Theory of Dimensions of Economic Quantities\", Jevons makes the statement that \"In the first place, pleasure and pain must be regarded as measured upon the same scale, and as having, therefore, the same dimensions, being quantities of the same kind, which can be added and subtracted...\" Speaking of measurement, addition and subtraction requires cardinality, as does Jevons's heavy use of integral calculus. Note that cardinality does not imply direct measurability, in which Jevons did not believe.\n\nIt was not, however, as a theorist dealing with the fundamental data of economic science, but as a writer on practical economic questions, that Jevons first received general recognition. \"A Serious Fall in the Value of Gold\" (1863) and \"The Coal Question\" (1865) placed him in the front rank as a writer on applied economics and statistics; and he would be remembered as one of the leading economists of the 19th century even had his \"Theory of Political Economy\" never been written. His economic works include \"Money and the Mechanism of Exchange\" (1875) written in a popular style, and descriptive rather than theoretical; a \"Primer on Political Economy\" (1878); \"The State in Relation to Labour\" (1882), and two works published after his death, \"Methods of Social Reform\" and \"Investigations in Currency and Finance\", containing papers that had appeared separately during his lifetime. The last-named volume contains Jevons's speculations on the connection between commercial crises and sunspots. He was engaged at the time of his death upon the preparation of a large treatise on economics and had drawn up a table of contents and completed some chapters and parts of chapters. This fragment was published in 1905 under the title of \"The Principles of Economics: a fragment of a treatise on the industrial mechanism of society, and other papers\".\n\nIn \"The Coal Question\", Jevons covered a breadth of concepts on energy depletion that have recently been revisited by writers covering the subject of peak oil. For example, Jevons explained that improving energy efficiency typically reduced energy costs and thereby increased rather than decreased energy use, an effect now known as the Jevons paradox. \"The Coal Question\" remains a paradigmatic study of resource depletion theory. Jevons's son, H. Stanley Jevons, published an 800-page follow-up study in 1915 in which the difficulties of estimating recoverable reserves of a theoretically finite resource are discussed in detail.\n\nIn a relatively minor work, \"Commercial Crises and Sun-Spots\", Jevons analyzed business cycles, proposing that crises in the economy might not be random events, but might be based on discernible prior causes. To clarify the concept, he presented a statistical study relating business cycles with sunspots. His reasoning was that sunspots affected the weather, which, in turn, affected crops. Crop changes could then be expected to cause economic changes. Subsequent studies have found that sunny weather has a small but significant positive impact on stock returns, probably due to its impact on traders' moods.\n\nIn 1864 Jevons published a \"Pure Logic; or, the Logic of Quality apart from Quantity\", which was based on Boole's system of logic, but freed from what he considered the false mathematical dress of that system. In the years immediately following he devoted considerable attention to the construction of a logical machine, exhibited before the Royal Society in 1870, by means of which could be mechanically obtained. In 1866 what he regarded as the great and universal principle of all reasoning dawned upon him; and in 1869 he published a sketch of this fundamental doctrine under the title of \"The Substitution of Similars\". He expressed the principle in its simplest form as follows: \"Whatever is true of a thing is true of its like\", and he worked out in detail its various applications including the \"logical abacus\" (a cross between logical abacus and a piano – \"Logic Piano\"), a mechanical computer he designed and had built in 1866.\nIn the following year appeared the \"Elementary Lessons on Logic\", which soon became the most widely read elementary textbook on logic in the English language. In the meantime he was engaged upon a much more important logical treatise, which appeared in 1874 under the title of \"The Principles of Science\". In this work Jevons embodied the substance of his earlier works on pure logic and the substitution of similars; he also enunciated and developed the view that induction is simply an inverse employment of deduction; he treated in a luminous manner the general theory of probability, and the relation between probability and induction; and his knowledge of the various natural sciences enabled him throughout to relieve the abstract character of logical doctrine by concrete scientific illustrations, often worked out in great detail. An example is his discussion of the use of one-way functions in cryptography, including remarks on the integer factorization problem that foreshadowed its use in public key cryptography. Jevons's general theory of induction was a revival of the theory laid down by Whewell and criticised by John Stuart Mill; but it was put in a new form, and was free from some of the non-essential adjuncts which rendered Whewell's exposition open to attack. The work as a whole was one of the most notable contributions to logical doctrine that appeared in the UK in the 19th century. \"Though less attractively written than Mill's \"System of Logic\", \"Principles of Science\" is a book that keeps much closer to the facts of scientific practice.\" His \"Studies in Deductive Logic\", consisting mainly of exercises and problems for the use of students, was published in 1880. In 1877 and the following years Jevons contributed to the \"Contemporary Review\" some articles on Mill, which he had intended to supplement by further articles, and eventually publish in a volume as a criticism of Mill's philosophy. These articles and one other were republished after Jevons's death, together with his earlier logical treatises, in a volume, entitled \"Pure Logic, and other Minor Works\". The criticisms on Mill contain much that is ingenious and much that is forcible, but on the whole they cannot be regarded as taking rank with Jevons's other work. His strength lay in his power as an original thinker rather than as a critic; and he will be remembered by his constructive work as logician, economist and statistician.\n\nOn Jevons as logician, see Grattan-Guinness (2000).\n\nJevons wrote in his \"Principles of Science\": \"Can the reader say what two numbers multiplied together will produce the number 8616460799? I think it unlikely that anyone but myself will ever know.\" This became known as Jevons's number and was factored by Derrick Norman Lehmer in 1903 and later on a pocket calculator by Solomon W. Golomb. It factors as 89681x96079.\n\nOne of Jevons's contemporaries, Hermann von Helmholtz, who was interested in non-Euclidean geometry, discussed two groups of two-dimensional creatures with one group living in the plane while the other living in the surface of a sphere. He asserted that since these creatures were embedded in two dimensions, they would develop a planar version of Euclidean geometry, but that since the nature of these surfaces were different, they would arrive at very different versions of this geometry. He then extended this argument into three dimensions, noting that this raises fundamental questions of the relationship of spatial perception to mathematical truth.\n\nJevons made an almost immediate response to this article. While Helmholtz focused on how humans perceived space, Jevons focused on the question of truth in geometry. Jevons agreed that while Helmholtz's argument was compelling in constructing a situation where the Euclidean axioms of geometry would not apply, he believed that they had no effect on the truth of these axioms. Jevons hence makes the distinction between truth and applicability or perception, suggesting that these concepts were independent in the domain of geometry.\n\nJevons did not claim that geometry was developed without any consideration for spatial reality. Instead, he suggested that his geometric systems were representations of reality but in a more fundamental way that transcends what one can perceive about reality. Jevons claimed that there was a flaw in Helmholtz's argument relating to the concept of infinitesimally small. This concept involves how these creatures reason about geometry and space at a very small scale, which is not necessarily the same as the reasoning that Helmholtz assumed on a more global scale. Jevons claimed that the Euclidean relations could be reduced locally in the different scenarios that Helmholtz created and hence the creatures should have been able to experience the Euclidean properties, just in a different representation. For example, Jevons claimed that the two-dimensional creatures living on the surface of a sphere should be able to construct the plane and even construct systems of higher dimensions and that although they may not be able to perceive such situations in reality, it would reveal fundamental mathematical truths in their theoretical existence.\n\nIn 1872, Helmholtz gave a response to Jevons, who claimed that Helmholtz failed to show why geometric truth should be separate from the reality of spatial perception. Helmholtz criticized Jevons's definition of truth and in particular, experiential truth. Helmholtz asserts that there should be a difference between experiential truth and mathematical truth and that these versions of truth are not necessarily consistent. This conversation between Helmholtz and Jevons was a microcosm of an ongoing debate between truth and perception in the wake of the introduction of non-Euclidean geometry in the late 19th century.\n\nIn 1867, Jevons married Harriet Ann Taylor, whose father, John Edward Taylor, had been the founder and proprietor of the \"Manchester Guardian\". Jevons suffered from ill health and sleeplessness, and found the delivery of lectures covering so wide a range of subjects very burdensome. In 1876, he was glad to exchange the Owens professorship for the professorship of political economy in University College, London. Travelling and music were the principal recreations of his life; but his health continued to be bad, and he suffered from depression. He found his professorial duties increasingly irksome, and feeling that the pressure of literary work left him no spare energy, he decided in 1880 to resign the post. On 13 August 1882 he drowned whilst bathing near Hastings.\n\nJevons was brought up a Christian Unitarian. Excerpts from his journals indicate he remained committed to his Christian beliefs until death. He is buried in the Hampstead Cemetery.\n\nJevons was a prolific writer, and at the time of his death was a leader in the UK both as a logician and as an economist. Alfred Marshall said of his work in economics that it \"will probably be found to have more constructive force than any, save that of Ricardo, that has been done during the last hundred years.\"\n\nJevons's theory of induction has continued to be influential: \"Jevons's general view of induction has received a powerful and original formulation in the work of a modern-day philosopher, Professor K. R. Popper.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5201365", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5201365", "title": "Zoophilia and the law", "text": "Zoophilia and the law\n\nZoophilia and the law looks at the laws governing humans performing sex acts with non-human animals. Laws against humans performing sex acts on animals, where they exist, are concerned with the actual act, which it commonly refers to as \"bestiality\", rather than the sexual attraction to animals. For this reason, prohibitions of zoophilic pornography are more varied; they may be unlawful if an actual sex act with an animal is involved, but the status is not clear-cut if there is a mere representation, such as a painting or cartoon. In that case, normal obscenity laws will normally apply. All zoophilic imagery is widely regarded as pornography.\n\nAccording to a 2014 poll carried out by Gallup, 76% of Denmark supports banning bestiality.\n\nAn April 2017 Yougov poll found 75% of the United Kingdom think bestiality should be illegal, 11% didn't think bestiality should be illegal, and 14% don't know.\n\nOn 21 April 2015, the Liberal Alliance was the only party in the Folketing to oppose and vote against banning bestiality, while the Red-Green Alliance abstained. Liberal Alliance MP Joachim Olsen said about the bill: \"Best case, this is a superficial law. Worst case, it is political populism and moralism\".\n\nDenmark's Animal Ethics Council opposed banning bestiality in Denmark in 2006 and 2015, saying existing laws which allow bestiality except in cases where the animal can be proved to have suffered were enough.\n\nLaws on bestiality tend to be shaped by animal welfare concerns, moral views, and cultural beliefs. In many cultures, humans are seen as fundamentally different from other animals and having sex with animals is seen as defilement.\n\nOne of the primary critiques of bestiality is that it is harmful to animals and necessarily abusive, because animals are unable to give or withhold consent.\n\nSome jurisdictions list laws very clearly, such as England and Wales, which specifically prohibits penetration of a human being by the penis of an animal, and penetration of an animal by a human's penis.\n\nBy contrast, many countries and US states are less precise about the scope of law in that they outlaw sex with animals, without defining what constitutes \"sex\".\n\nEven if bestiality is not explicitly prohibited, there are often many other laws which can be used to effectively prosecute cases. For example, most countries have animal cruelty laws, and a prosecutor will argue that all zoophilia activity is animal abuse. In some U.S. states, a person who engages in bestiality can be charged with animal cruelty.\n\nSome countries have a range of laws on their books. Sometimes sodomy laws or \"crime against nature\" laws are used to prosecute people who have sex with animals.\n\nIn the case of Kenneth Pinyan, who died from injuries sustained from receiving anal sex from a horse, local law enforcement found that there were no laws that allowed them to prosecute his friend, who had filmed the event and also allowed himself to be sodomized by the horse. The friend was prosecuted for trespassing. That case prompted the Washington State legislature to draw up legislation outlawing sex with animals.\n\nIn a 2005 Florida case, a man who had sex with his dog was charged with disorderly conduct, since the state had no anti-bestiality laws on the books at the time. On October 1, 2011, the state of Florida State Law 828.126, F.S went into effect, banning sex with animals.\n\nAggrawal has discussed extensively on laws against bestiality. It is permitted in a few countries although ordinary animal treatment laws apply.\n\nThere are also commonly laws against forcing another person to engage in sexual activity with other animals, especially minors (usually considered equivalent to rape), and laws related to exposing others (either non-consensually or minors) to the sight of a sexual act. In some jurisdictions, laws against zoophilia conduct also include provisions for seizure of animals where convicted.\n\nSexual handling of an animal for the purposes of veterinary practice, or animal husbandry (breeding), is normally exempted where such laws exist. In public discussion for the recently passed Oregon law, however, one animal shelter's spokesperson wanted the husbandry exemption kept out, as he was concerned that someone might use these \"accepted farming practices\" as a legal loophole to then have (legal) sexual contact with an animal only for personal enjoyment. One of the legislators responded by asking if they were trying to outlaw an act (of sexual contact), or a state of mind. The veterinary and husbandry exemption was left out of Oregon's law in the final, enacted version. Because some alterations of animal genitalia (such as artificial insemination) are permitted but others (sex with animals) are not, concerns have been raised that this may violate due process and equality before the law.\n\nThe legality of pornography has three components: legality of production, legality of sale and transportation, and legality of ownership. In general, animal pornography is legal to produce where both zoophilic activity and the creation of pornography in general are legal. Laws concerning sale, transmission and ownership vary more widely.\n\nErotic art, such as animal pornography in cartoons and the like, which does not require the recording of an actual sexual act, are not usually considered sex with animals by the law, and so their status depends upon more general laws such as legal limits upon obscenity or pornography alone, and the thin line between erotic art and pornography.\n\n\n"}
