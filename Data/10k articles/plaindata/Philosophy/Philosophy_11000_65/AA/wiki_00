This book largely seeks to refute the claims made by Berkeley's contemporary John Locke about the nature of human perception. Whilst, like all the Empiricist philosophers, both Locke and Berkeley agreed that we are having experiences, regardless of whether material objects exist, Berkeley sought to prove that the outside world (the world which causes the ideas one has within one's mind) is also composed \"solely\" of ideas. Berkeley did this by suggesting that \"Ideas can only resemble Ideas\" - the mental ideas that we possess can only resemble other ideas (not material objects) and thus the external world consists not of physical form, but rather of ideas. This world is (or, at least, was) given logic and regularity by some other force, which Berkeley concludes is God.\n\nBerkeley declared that his intention was to make an inquiry into the First Principles of Human Knowledge in order to discover the principles that have led to doubt, uncertainty, absurdity, and contradiction in philosophy. In order to prepare the reader, he discussed two topics that lead to errors. First, he claimed that the mind cannot conceive abstract ideas. We can't have an idea of some abstract thing that is common to many particular ideas and therefore has, at the same time, many different predicates and no predicates. Second, Berkeley declared that words, such as names, do not signify abstract ideas. With regard to ideas, he asserted that we can only think of particular things that have been perceived. Names, he wrote, signify general ideas, not abstract ideas. General ideas represent any one of several particular ideas. Berkeley criticized Locke for saying that words signify general, but abstract, ideas. At the end of his Introduction, he advised the reader to let his words engender clear, particular ideas instead of trying to associate them with non–existent abstractions.\n\nBerkeley began his treatise by asserting that existence is the state of being perceived by a perceiver. Human minds know ideas, not objects. The three kinds of ideas are those of sensation, thought, and imagination. When several ideas are associated together, they are thought to be ideas of one distinct thing, which is then signified by one name.\n\nIdeas are known and perceived by a knowing perceiver. This active perceiver is designated by the names mind, spirit, soul, or self. Ideas exist by virtue of a perceiver. The existence of an idea consists in being perceived.\n\nWhat is meant by the term \"exist\" when it is applied to a thing that is known through the senses? To say that something exists is to say that it is perceived by a perceiver. This is the main principle of human knowledge.\n\nExternal objects are things that are perceived through our senses. We perceive only our own sensations or ideas. Ideas and sensations cannot exist unperceived.\n\nTo say that an object exists without being perceived is to attempt to abstract that which cannot be abstracted. We cannot separate or abstract objects and their qualities from our perception of them.\n\nIf an object exists or is perceived, it must be perceived by me or some other perceiver. It is impossible to separate the being of a sensible thing from its existence as a perception of a perceiver.\n\nThere can be no unthinking substance or substratum of ideas. Therefore, the perceiving mind or spirit is the only substance of ideas. Ideas inhere in or belong to a perceiver.\n\nAre there things that exist in an unthinking substance outside of the perceiver's mind? Can they be the originals that the ideas copy or resemble? An idea can only be like an idea, not something undetectable. It is impossible for us to conceive of a copy or resemblance unless it is between two ideas.\n\nAccording to Locke, a thing's primary qualities, such as its extension, shape, motion, solidity, and number, exist unperceived, apart from any perceiver's mind, in an inert, senseless substance called matter. Berkeley opposed Locke's assertion. Qualities that are called primary are, according to Berkeley, ideas that exist in a perceiver's mind. These ideas can only be like other ideas. They cannot exist in an unperceiving, corporeal substance or matter.\n\nThe primary qualities of figure, motion, etc., cannot be conceived as being separate from the secondary qualities, which are related to sensations. Therefore, primary qualities, like secondary qualities, exist only in the mind. The properties of primary qualities are relative and change according to the observer's perspective. The greatness and smallness of figure, the swiftness and slowness of motion, exist in the mind and depend on point of view or position.\n\nNumber exists only in the mind. The same thing is described by different numbers according to the mind's viewpoint. An object can have an extension of one, three, and thirty six, according to its measurement in yards, feet, and inches. Number is relative and does not exist separately from a mind.\n\nUnity is merely an abstract idea. Primary qualities, such as figure, extension, and motion, are relative, as are secondary qualities such as red, bitter, and soft. They all depend on the observer's frame of reference, position, or point of view. Berkeley's \"…method of arguing does not so much prove that there is no extension or colour in an outward object, as that \"we\" do not know by \"sense\" which is the \"true\" extension or colour of the object.\" Idealism, here, is epistemological, not ontological. Berkeley declared that it is \"…impossible that any colour or extension at all, or other sensible quality whatsoever, should exist in an unthinking subject without the mind, or in truth, that there should be any such thing as an outward object.\" Any quality that depends on sensation for its existence requires that a sense organ and a mind is conscious of it. By \"unthinking subject,\" he means \"mindless matter\" or \"substance, substratum, or support that is not a thinking mind.\" By \"without the mind,\" he means \"not in the mind.\"\n\nMatter is material substance. What does this mean? \"Material substance\" has two meanings: \"being in general\" and \"support of accidents.\" (The word accident is used here to mean an unessential quality.) \"Being in general\" is incomprehensible because it is extremely abstract. To speak of supporting accidents such as extension, figure, and motion is to speak of being a substance, substratum, or support in an unusual, figurative, senseless manner. Sensible qualities, such as extension, figure, or motion, do not have an existence outside of a mind.\n\nComparing Ontology with Epistemology, Berkeley asked, \"But, though it were possible that solid, figured, moveable \"substances\" may exist without the mind, corresponding to the ideas we have of bodies, yet how is it possible for us to know this?\" Knowledge through our senses only gives us knowledge of our senses, not of any unperceived things. Knowledge through reason does not guarantee that there are, necessarily, unperceived objects. In dreams and frenzies, we have ideas that do not correspond to external objects. \"…[T]he supposition of external bodies is not necessary for the producing our ideas….\" Materialists do not know how bodies affect spirit. We can't suppose that there is matter because we don't know how ideas occur in our minds. \"In short, if there were external bodies, it is impossible we should ever come to know it….\" Suppose that there were an intelligence that was not affected by external bodies. If that intelligence had orderly and vivid sensations and ideas, what reason would it have to believe that bodies external to the mind were exciting those sensations and ideas? None.\n\nThrough reflection or introspection it is possible to attempt to know if a sound, shape, movement, or color can exist unperceived by a mind. Berkeley declared that he will surrender and admit the unperceived existence of material objects, even though this doctrine is unprovable and useless, if \"…you can conceive it possible for one extended moveable substance or, in general, for any one idea, or anything like an idea, to exist otherwise than in a mind perceiving it….\" In answer to Berkeley's summons, it might be said that it is easy to imagine objects that are not perceived by anyone. But, he asked, \"…what is all this, I beseech you, more than framing in \"your\" mind certain ideas which you call books and trees, and at the same time omitting to frame the idea of any one that may perceive them? But do not you yourself perceive or think of them all the while?\" The mind had merely forgotten to include itself as the imaginer of those imagined objects.\n\nIt is impossible to understand what is meant by the words \"absolute existence of sensible objects in themselves\". To speak of perceived objects that are not perceived is to use words that have no meaning or to utter a contradiction.\n\nIdeas exist only in a mind and have no power to cause any effects. Ideas of extension, figure, and motion cannot cause sensations. \"To say, therefore, that these [sensations] are the effects of powers resulting from the configuration, number, motion, and size of corpuscles must certainly be false.\" Some non–idea must produce the succession of ideas in our minds. Since the cause can't be another idea, it must be a substance. If there are no material substances, then it must be an immaterial substance. Such an incorporeal, active substance is called a Spirit. A Spirit is that which acts. A Spirit is one simple, undivided, active being. It cannot be perceived. Only its effects can be perceived. The two principal powers of Spirit are Understanding and Will. Understanding is a Spirit that perceives ideas. Will is a Spirit that operates with or produces ideas. The words \"will\", \"soul\", or \"spirit\" designate something that is active but cannot be represented by an idea. Berkeley claimed that a person's active mind can imaginatively generate ideas at will. Ideas that are sensually perceived, however, are not dependent on the observer's will. The ideas that are imprinted on the mind when observing the external world are not the result of willing. \"There is therefore some \"other\" Will or Spirit that produces them.\n\nIdeas that are perceived through our senses are lively and distinct, unlike imagined ideas. Their orderly connection and coherence reflects the wisdom and benevolence of the mind that made them. The ideas of sense occur according to rules. We call these connections and associations \"laws of nature\". Necessary connections are not discovered by us. We only observe settled laws of nature and use them to manage our affairs. Erroneously, we attribute power and agency to ideas of sense, which are mere secondary causes. Ideas, we think, can cause other ideas. The primary cause, the \"Governing spirit whose Will constitutes the laws of nature\" is ignored.\n\nThere are strong ideas and there are faint ideas. We call strong ideas \"real things\". They are regular, vivid, constant, distinct, orderly, and coherent. These strong ideas of sense are less dependent on the perceiver. Ideas of imagination, however, are less vivid and distinct. They are copies or images of strong ideas and are more the creation of a perceiver. Nevertheless, both strong and faint ideas are ideas and therefore exist only in a perceiver's mind.\n\nObjection: \"[A]ll that is real and substantial in nature is banished out of the world, and instead thereof a chimerical scheme of ideas takes place.\" Answer: Real things and chimeras are both ideas and therefore exist in the mind. Real things are more strongly affecting, steady, orderly, distinct, and independent of the perceiver than imaginary chimeras, but both are ideas. If, by \"substance\" is meant \"that which supports accidents or qualities outside of the mind\", then substance has no existence. \"The only thing whose existence we deny is that which \"Philosophers\" call Matter or corporeal substance.\" All of our experiences are of things (ideas) which we perceive immediately by our senses. These things, or ideas, exist only in the mind that perceives them. \"That what I see, hear, and feel doth exist, that is to say, is perceived by me, I no more doubt than I do of my own being.\"\n\nObjection: \"[T]here is a great difference betwixt real fire for instance, and the idea of fire, …if you suspect it to be only the idea of fire which you see, do but put your hand into it….\" Answer: Real fire and the real pain that it causes are both ideas. They are known only by some mind that perceives them.\n\nObjection: \"[W]e \"see\" things… at a distance from us, and which consequently do not exist in the mind….\" Answer: Distant things in a dream are actually in the mind. Also, we do not directly perceive distance while we are awake. We infer distance from a combination of sensations, such as sight and touch. Distant ideas are ideas that we could perceive through touch if we were to move our bodies.\n\nObjection: It would follow from Berkeley's principles that \"…things are every moment annihilated and created anew… .\" When no one perceives them, objects become nothing. When a perceiver opens his eyes, the objects are created again. Answer: Berkeley requests that the reader…consider whether he \"means\" anything by the actual existence of an idea distinct from its being perceived.\" \"[I]t is the mind that frames all that variety of bodies which compose the visible world, any one whereof does not exist longer than it is perceived.\" If one perceiver closes his eyes, though, the objects that he had been perceiving could still exist in the mind of another perceiver.\n\nObjection: \"[I]f extension and figure exist only in the mind, it follows that the mind is extended and figured….\" Extension would be an attribute that is predicated of the subject, the mind, in which it exists. Answer: Extension and figure are in the mind because they are ideas that are perceived by the mind. They are not in the mind as attributes that are predicated of the mind, which is the subject. The color red may be an idea in the mind, but that doesn't mean that the mind is red.\n\nObjection: \"[A] great many things have been explained by matter and motion….\" Natural science has made much progress by assuming the existence of matter and mechanical motion. Answer: Scientists do not need to assume that matter and motion exist and that they have effects on an observer's mind. All scientists need to do is to explain why we are affected by certain \"ideas\" on certain occasions.\n\nObjection: It is absurd to ascribe everything to Spirits instead of natural causes. Answer: Using common language, we can speak of natural causes. We do this in order to communicate. However, in actuality we must know that we are speaking only of ideas in a perceiver's mind. We should \"think with the learned and speak with the vulgar.\"\n\nObjection: Humans universally agree that there are external things and that matter exists. Is everyone wrong? Answer: Universal assent doesn't guarantee the truth of a statement. Many false notions are believed by many people. Also, humans may act as if matter is the cause of their sensations. They can't, however, really understand any meaning in the words \"matter exists.\"\n\nObjection: Then why does everyone think that matter and an external world exist? Answer: People notice that some ideas appear in their minds independently of their wishes or desires. They then conclude that those ideas or perceived objects exist outside of the mind. This judgment, however, is a contradiction. Some philosophers, who know that ideas exist only in the mind, assume that there are external objects that resemble the ideas. They think that external objects cause internal, mental ideas.\n\nObjection: Berkeley's principles are not consistent with science and mathematics. The motion of the earth is considered to be true. But, according to Berkeley, motion is only an idea and does not exist if it is not perceived. Answer: To ask if the earth moves is really to ask if we could view the Earth's movement if we were in a position to perceive the relation between the earth and the sun. In accordance with our knowledge of the way that ideas have appeared in our minds in the past, we can make reasonable predictions about how ideas will appear to us in the future.\n\nObjection: Ideas appear in a causal sequence. If ideas are mere superficial appearances without internal parts, what is the purpose of the complicated causal sequence in which they appear? It would be less effort for objects to appear as ideas with simple exterior surfaces, without so many internal connections. Answer: Scientists should not explain things as though they are effects of causes. The connection of ideas is a relationship between signs and the things that are signified. We should study our ideas as though they are informative signs in a language of nature. If we understand the language in which these idea–signs are used, then we understand how we can produce connections of ideas.\n\nObjection: Matter may possibly exist as an inert, thoughtless substance, or occasion, of ideas. Answer: If matter is an unknown support for qualities such as figure, motion and color, then it doesn't concern us. Such qualities are sensations or ideas in a perceiving mind.\n\nObjection: Holy Scripture speaks of real things such as mountains, cities, and human bodies. Holy Writ also describes miracles, such as the marriage feast at Cana, in which things are changed into other things. Are these nothing but appearances or ideas? Answer: Real things are strong, distinct, vivid ideas. Imaginary things are weak, indistinct, faint ideas. Things that people are able to see, smell, and taste are real things.\n\nAs a result of these principles, the following consequences follow:\n\nBecause the following inquiries depend on the assumption of the existence of matter, these questions can no longer be asked:\n\nHuman knowledge may naturally be reduced to two heads — that of IDEAS and that of SPIRITS.\n\nIt is an error to think that objects of sense, or real things, exist in two ways: in the mind and not in the mind (apart from the mind). Scepticism results because we can't know if the perceived objects are like the unperceived objects.\n\nSensed ideas are real, existing things. They cannot exist without a perceiving mind. They cannot resemble anything that exists apart from a mind. This is because the existence of a sensation or idea consists in being perceived, and an idea cannot be like anything that is not an idea. If things originate or persist when I do not perceive them, it is because another mind perceives them.\n\nSceptics, fatalists, idolators, and atheists believe that matter exists unperceived.\n\nAnother source of errors is the attempt to think about abstract ideas. Particular ideas are known as being real. Abstractions, made by subtracting all particularity from ideas, lead to errors and difficulties.\n\nSceptics say that we can never know the true, real nature of things. There is no way, they say, that we can compare the ideas in our mind to what is in the external, material world. We are ignorant of the real essence (internal qualities and constitution) of any object. They say that the cause of an object's properties is its unknown essence, occult qualities, or mechanical causes. But, motion, color, sound, figure, magnitude, etc., are ideas and one idea or quality cannot cause another. The skeptics are wrong because only a spirit can cause an idea.\n\nThe mechanical principle of attraction is used to explain the tendency of bodies to move toward each other. But attraction is merely a general name that describes an effect. It does not signify the cause of the observed motion. All efficient causes are produced by the will of a mind or spirit (mind or spirit being that which thinks, wills, and perceives). Gravitation (mutual attraction) is said to be universal. We, however, don't know if gravitation is necessary or essential everywhere in the universe. Gravitation depends only on the will of the mind or spirit that governs the universe.\n\nFour conclusions result from these premisses: (1) Mind or spirit is the efficient cause in nature; (2) We should investigate the final causes or purposes of things; (3) We should study the history of nature and make observations and experiments in order to draw useful general conclusions; (4) We should observe the phenomena that we see in order to discover general laws of nature in order to deduce other phenomena from them. These four conclusions are based on the wisdom, goodness, and kindness of God.\n\nNewton asserted that time, space, and motion can be distinguished into absolute/relative, true/apparent, mathematical/vulgar. In so doing, he assumed that time, space, and motion are usually thought of as being related to sensible things. But they also, he assumed, have an inner nature that exists apart from a spectator's mind and has no relation to sensible things. He described an absolute time, space, and motion that are distinguished from relative or apparent time, space, and motion. Berkeley disagreed. To him, all motion is relative because the idea that Berkeley had of motion necessarily included relation. \nBy pure space, I mean that I conceive that I can move my arms and legs without anything resisting them. Space is less pure when there is more resistance by other bodies. Space, therefore, is an idea that is relative to body and motion.\n\nErrors made by mathematicians occur because of (1) their reliance on general abstract ideas and (2) their belief that an object exists as such without being an idea in a spectator's mind. In arithmetic, those things which pass for abstract truths and theorems concerning numbers are, in reality, concerned with particular things that can be counted. In geometry, a source of confusion is the assumption that a finite extension is infinitely divisible or contains an infinite number of parts. Every particular finite line, surface, or solid which may possibly be the object of our thought is an \"idea\" existing only in the mind, and consequently each part of it must be perceived. Any line, surface, or solid that I perceive is an idea in my mind. I can't divide my idea into an infinite number of other ideas. We can't conceive of an inch–long line being divided into a thousand parts, much less infinities of infinities. There is no such thing as an infinite number of parts contained in a finite quantity. In order to use mathematics, it is not necessary to assume that there are infinite parts of finite lines or any quantities smaller than the smallest that can be sensed.\n\nA spirit or mind is that which thinks, wills, or perceives. It is thought that we are ignorant of the nature of mind or spirit because we have no idea of it. But it was demonstrated in § 27 that ideas exist in spirits or minds. It is absurd to expect that the spirit or mind that supports an idea should itself also be an idea. In § 27, it was shown that the soul is indivisible. Therefore, it is naturally immortal. I know that spirits or minds other than myself exist because I perceive the ideas that they cause. When I perceive the order and harmony of nature, I know that God, as infinitely wise spirit or mind, is the cause. We can't see God because He is a spirit or mind, not an idea. We see Him in the same way that we see a man, when actually we are seeing only the ideas, such as color, size, and motion that the man causes. Imperfections in nature, such as floods, blights, monstrous births, etc., are absolutely necessary. They are not the result of God's direct influence. They are the result of the working of the system of simple, general, consistent rules that God has established in nature in order that living things can survive. Such natural defects are useful in that they act as an agreeable variety and accentuate the beauty of the rest of nature by their contrast. The pain that exists in the world is indispensably necessary to our well–being. When seen from a higher, broader perspective, particular evils are known to be good when they are comprehended as parts of a beautiful, orderly whole system.\n\nBerkeley claimed that the main design of his efforts in writing this book was to promote the consideration of God and our duty. If we are clearly convinced of God's existence, then we will fill our hearts with awful circumspection and holy fear. Berkeley claimed that the world exists as it does, when no one is looking at it, because it consists of ideas that are perceived by the mind of God. If we think that the eyes of the Lord are everywhere, beholding the evil and the good, knowing our innermost thoughts, then we will realize our total dependence on Him. In this way, we will have an incentive to be virtuous and to avoid vice.\n\n\n\n"}

The African News Agency is the first news and content syndication service on the African continent, and was launched in Cape Town in February 2015.\n\nThe launch of ANA followed the liquidation of the South African Press Association (SAPA). The SAPA was once a major supplier of foreign and domestic news in South Africa, and consisted of a feed distributed to newsrooms in the country. When the two African investors acquired SAPA, to establish the African News Agency, they wanted to create one of Africa’s first news syndication services with stories written by Africans, for Africans, and for the rest of the world. They realized that the narrative of Africa had been written by Western news organisations, and did not subscribe to the view that Africa is a continent that is subject to famine, crime and disease. The African News Agency would tell far more positive stories of Africa and African people showcasing Africa as a continent full of hope and a wealth of opportunity.\n\nCurrently the multimedia news service provides news and relevant content to broadcasters, newspapers, digital customers, and business and civil society organisations covering a range of news, from economics and business to sports, lifestyle, politics, and entertainment. Recently, international investors bought a 10% stake in the news syndication service. Launched in South Africa six months ago, ANA is now worth a billion USD.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "48966861", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48966861", "title": "Ajñana", "text": "Ajñana\n\nAjñana was one of the \"nāstika\" or \"heterodox\" schools of ancient Indian philosophy, and the ancient school of radical Indian skepticism. It was a Śramaṇa movement and a major rival of early Buddhism and Jainism. They have been recorded in Buddhist and Jain texts. They held that it was impossible to obtain knowledge of metaphysical nature or ascertain the truth value of philosophical propositions; and even if knowledge was possible, it was useless and disadvantageous for final salvation. They were specialized in refutation without propagating any positive doctrine of their own.\n\nAll of our knowledge of the Ajñana come from the Buddhists and Jain sources. The Ajñana view points are recorded in Theravada Buddhism's Pāli Canon in the \"Brahmajala Sutta\" and \"Samaññaphala Sutta\" and in the \"Sūyagaḍaṃga\" of Jainism. Along with these texts, the sayings and opinions of the Sceptics (\"ajñanikah\", \"ajñaninah\") has been preserved by Jain writer Silanka, from the ninth century, commenting on the Sutrakritanga. Silanka considers sceptics \"those who claim that scepticism is best\" or as \"those in whom no knowledge, i.e. scepticism, is evident\". Apart from the specific technical meaning, Silanka also uses the word \"ajñanikah\" in a more general sense to mean anyone who is ignorant.\n\nThe traces of scepticism can be found in Vedic sources such as in the Nasadiya hymn and hymn to \"sraddha\" (faith) in Rigveda. In Brahmanas and Early Upanishads doubt regarding a person's existence after death is cast, while the Yajñavalkya argued for the impossibility of knowing the ultimate reality or the atman. However the flourishing of sceptical thoughts seems to have occurred in a period with diverse, conflicting, and irreconcilable theories, regarding morality, metaphysics, and religious beliefs. It is natural, in the absence of a commonly accepted criterion of truth, for some people to wonder if any theory could be true at all. The Sceptics specifically pointed to the conflicting theories of atman and the requirement of omniscience, and hence the criticism of omniscience, to obtain true knowledge. A proliferation of view points existed during the period immediately preceding the rise of Buddhism, as attested in the Buddhist and Jain texts. The Buddhist Brahmajal Sutta lists four types (or schools) of Sceptics along with fifty-eight other schools of thought, while the Jain Sutrakrtanga lists sixty-seven \"schools\" of Sceptics among three hundred and sixty-three different schools of thought. While the list is artificially constructed according to Jain categories, the four main schools of thought, Kriyavada, Akriyavada, Ajnanikavada, and Vainayikavada, and their subgroups must have existed. Thus, philosophical Scepticism is thought to have appeared around this historic time frame.\n\nThe Ajñana claimed that the possibility of knowledge is doubtful since the claims to knowledge were mutually contradictory. Silanka quotes, \"They posit the theory that since those who claim knowledge make mutually contradictory assertions, they cannot be stating the truth.\" Regarding Sceptic's point of view, Silanka in his commentary writes, as translated by Jayatilleke:\n\nThe conflicting theories of atman can be traced to Early Upanisads. The idea of atman \"made of everything\" (\"sarvamayah\", \"idammayah adomayah\") would be omnipresent (\"sarvagatam\") (Brhadaranyaka 4.4.5) while the transcendent atman defined negatively (Brhadaranyaka 3.9.26) would not be so. Again at Katha 2.3.17 the atman is of \"the size of a digit\", while at Chandogya 3.14.3, the atman is \"smaller than a kernel of a grain of millet\". Again at Brhadaranyaka 2.3.1, Brahman which is identical with the atman is said \"both to have form and also be formless.\" Likewise at Katha 2.3.17 the atman \"resides in the heart\" while at Aitareya Aranyaka 2.1.4.6 it is located in the head.\n\nIn the same passage, Silanka continues:\nThis criticism of omniscience seems to be directed at those teachers who claimed omniscience, or to their followers who later claimed them to be omniscient, specifically the Jain leaders and Purana Kassapa, and maybe later to Makkhali Gosala and the Buddha, on the basis of which they claimed to speak with authority. The dictum, that with a limited knowledge no one can know that any person is omniscient, may possibly be an old saying of the Sceptics; and they may have extended the idea to say that since human intellect was limited, no one could claim to know everything with such limited intellect. The passage may also be seen as a critic on epistemology.\n\nIn the same passage, Silanka further continues:\nTo the Sceptics, none of the contending theories, proposed by limited intellect, can be known to be true, since they are mutually contradictory. Also, any new theory is bound to contradict existing theories, and hence cannot be true. Hence nothing can be known to be true. Thus the Sceptics conclude that the contradictions of metaphysics and the impossibility of omniscience leads them to accept Scepticism.\n\nIn a similar vein, the Sceptics held that\n\nThis may also be the reason why the Sceptics held to another dictum that\n\nLikewise, Silanka comments, \"owing to the difficulty of knowing another's mind, they do not grasp what is intended by the words of their teacher and thus repeat the other's words like a barbarian without understanding the real meaning.\"\n\nRegarding this passage and the maxims on knowledge, Jayatilleke compares the Sceptic's views with that of the Greek sophist Gorgias, as given in his book \"Nature or the Non-existent,\" and proposes that the Sceptics may have arrived at their position using similar lines of reasoning. According to Jayatilleke's interpretation of the passage given by Silanka, perception is divided into near, middle, and outer, and we perceive only the near; so each person's view of what they see of an object will be different according their perspective. Since our knowledge depends on our individual perspective, the knowledge would be subjective since different person will have differing perspectives. In the absence of objectivity, there is no knowledge and all private experiences of impressions of different individuals would be incommunicable.\n\nAccording to Silanka,\n\nThis quotation suggests that the Sceptics preferred scepticism not just on intellectual basis, but also for pragmatic or moral reasons. What these disadvantages are, Silanka does not elaborate, but can be found in the Buddhist sources. Regarding the futility of knowledge, Silanka puts these questions of the Sceptics:\n\nThe Sutrakrtanga affirms that the Sceptics \"teach final beatitude and final deliverance.\" Thus, the Sceptics may have contended that knowledge is not necessary for salvation but \"tapas\", which seem similar to \"karmapatha\".\n\nSilanka in his commentary mentions sixty-seven types of Sceptics. However, these sixty-seven types are obtained combinatorially by taking nine categories (\"navapadartha\") of Jainism, each with seven forms of predication (\"saptabhangakah\"), to give sixty-three (9 × 7) forms of sceptical questions, which were considered to represent sixty-three \"types\" of Sceptics asking these questions. The last four \"types\" were added to complete the list of sixty-seven types. However, according to Jayatilleke, these last four \"types\" may represent the kind of questions the Sceptics themselves might have asked. The last four questions are:\n\nSuch psychological speculations seem to be rife during this era, as evinced in Pali Nikayas, especially the Potthapada Sutta.\n\nIn the Pali texts, the Sceptics are nicknamed \"Amarāvikkhepika\"s, which translates as \"eel-wrigglers,\" probably in reference to their \"verbal jugglery.\" They are collectively spoken of as \"some recluse and brahmins who wriggle like eels. For when a question is put to them on this or that matter, they resort to verbal jugglery and eel-wriggling on four grounds.\" Brahmajala Sutta describes four schools of Scepticism, the first three of whom advocated Scepticism on the basis of fear of falsehood (\"musavadabhaya\"), fear of involvement (\"upadanabhaya\"), and fear of interrogation in debate (\"anuyogabhaya\"), respectively, which all of them considered undesirable since it led to remorse or worry, and which led to a moral danger. While these three schools seem to have valued mental equanimity, it appears that the fourth school of Sceptics, associated with the philosopher Sanjaya Belatthiputta, did not share this value. A notable commonality among all these schools is the arrangement of propositions according to five-fold logic, alongside the usual two-fold mode and the four-fold mode (catuṣkoṭi) common in Pali Nikayas. The fifth mode is given as the denial of denials, that is, the rejection of the dialectician's view.\n\nThe first school is described in the \"Brahmajala Sutta\":\nIn the absence of adequate information, the Sceptics prudently recommend suspension of judgement. The Sceptics felt that it was not just intellectual dishonest, but also morally dangerous not to do so. \nHowever, according to Jayatilleke, this was probably not a temporary suspension of judgement, until new information could come by to make a better evaluation; but rather it was meant to be a permanent state of affair by outright denying the very possibility of knowledge, and hence of questions regarding morality. Thus, their Scepticism is motivated by both intellectual as well as moral reasoning (i.e. fear of asserting falsehood due to ones prejudices). They seem to have contended that knowledge was not necessary for salvation but for \"karma-patha\". \n\nThe second school of Sceptics is describe in Brahmajala Sutta in similar terms as the first, except that for them to be led to believe in a proposition by one's likes, desires, aversions, and resentments would be entanglement (\"upadanam\"), and such entanglement would be a source of worry (\"vighato\") and as such a moral danger (\"antarayo\"). \n\nAccording to Jayatilleke, this group adopted Scepticism mainly due to morality, since to do so otherwise would lead to lead to worry and mental disquietude (\"vighata\"), and not necessarily due to the considerations of rebirth, as understood according to the Buddhist connotation of the word \"entanglement\".\n\nIn Brahmajala Sutta, the third school of Scepticism is shown to put forward such arguments in support for their view point:\n\nAccording to Jayatilleke, it is not clear from this passage if they wished to avoid debate because they were Sceptics or whether they adopted Scepticism because they wanted to avoid debate. According to him, it is probable that \"they would have seen no point in debate since one was nowhere nearer the truth at the end of it and at the same time feared debate because it could result in loss of their mental equanimity with they valued.\"\n\nThe fourth school of Scepticism described in Brahmajala Sutta is associated with Sanjaya Belatthiputta, whose views are also recorded in the \"Samaññaphala Sutta\", since identical language is used to describe them. Sanjaya is described as a contemporary of the Buddha, as a well-known and celebrated teacher, and as a leader of a sect who was held in high esteem by the common folk. He is said to have taught Sariputta and Moggallana, before their conversion to Buddhism. \n\nIn Brahmajala Sutta, this fourth school of Sceptics is described as thus:\nA similar account is given in the \"Samaññaphala Sutta\". In both the accounts, the stupidity of this school is emphasised, highlighting the antipathy that the Buddhists felt about this school. In the \"Brahmajala Sutta\", out of sixty-two philosophical schools mentioned, this school is singled out as being \"a product of sheer stupidity;\" whereas in the \"Samaññaphala Sutta\", Ajatasattu singles out Sanjaya as \"the most foolish and stupid.\"\n\nNotable in this account of the fourth school of Scepticism is the lack of concern for good life and peace of mind, which the previous three schools regarded as desirable, and hence their advocacy of scepticism. Jayatilleke states that Sanjaya may have been a more thorough-going sceptic, to the point of being sceptical about a sceptic's way of life, and as such might have been a more vocal critic of his opponents and their regard for mental tranquillity, valued by the Buddhists as well. Judging by the propositions listed, Sanjaya's scepticism seems to have encompassed both metaphysics and morality. Sanjaya seems to grant the possibility of their truth, while denying the possibility of knowing this.\n\nThe Jains criticised the Sceptics by pointing out that their scepticism should lead them to the conclusion that they know nothing whatsoever, yet they assert the knowledge of their scepticism and claim to know such propositions as \"ignorance is best\". Silanka criticises the Sceptic's belief, that one cannot know what is on another's mind, saying \"the inner mind of another can be apprehended by his external features, gestures, movements, gait, speech and the changes in his eyes and face.\"\n\nAlthough criticised by the Buddhists as eel-wrigglers, in the Pali canon, the Buddha is depicted negating various the four-fold logical alternatives or \"catuṣkoṭi\" when posed with metaphysical questions, which is similar to the logic employed by the Ajñanins. However, all four schools of Ajñanins arrange their logic as five-fold formula, which seems to be based on the acceptance of the four-fold formula. This may mean that such logical schema was a common feature of the pre-Buddhist era. Alternatively, since there is no known school of Indian thinkers apart from the Buddhist who adopted a four-fold logical schema, and since all Sceptical schools are depicted to have the five-fold formula of denial, which seems to be based on the acceptance of a four-fold form of predication, this may suggest the four-fold schema to be the Buddhist invention. Indeed, two of the foremost disciples of Buddha, Sariputta and Moggallāna, were initially the students of Sanjaya; and a strong element of skepticism is found in early Buddhism, most particularly in the Aṭṭhakavagga sutra. The catuṣkoṭi was later used as a tool by Nagarjuna to formulate his influential brand of Madhyamaka philosophy. Since skepticism is a philosophical attitude and a style of philosophising rather than a position, the Ajñanins may have influenced other skeptical thinkers of India like Nagarjuna, Jayarāśi Bhaṭṭa, and Shriharsha .\n\nAccording to Diogenes Laërtius, the Greek philosopher Pyrrho developed his skeptical philosophy in India when Pyrrho was there during the conquest of Alexander the Great. Based on the so-called \"Aristocles passage,\" Jayatilleke draws many similarities between his philosophy and the Indian philosophies current at the time. In particular, he lists the following:\n\nScholars including Barua, Jayatilleke, and Flintoff, contend that Pyrrho was influenced by, or at the very least agreed with, Indian scepticism rather than Buddhism or Jainism, based on the fact that he valued ataraxia, which can be translated as \"freedom from worry\". Jayatilleke in particular contends that Pyrrho may have been influenced by the first three school of Ajñana, since they too valued freedom from worry. If this is true, then the methods of the Ajñanins may be preserved in the extent work by Sextus Empiricus.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "27913535", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27913535", "title": "All Religions are One", "text": "All Religions are One\n\nAll Religions are One is a series of philosophical aphorisms by William Blake, written in 1788. Following on from his initial experiments with relief etching in the non-textual \"The Approach of Doom\" (1787), \"All Religions are One\" and \"There is No Natural Religion\" represent Blake's first successful attempt to combine image and text via relief etching, and are thus the earliest of his illuminated manuscripts. As such, they serve as a significant milestone in Blake's career; as Peter Ackroyd points out, \"his newly invented form now changed the nature of his expression. It had enlarged his range; with relief etching, the words inscribed like those of God upon the tables of law, Blake could acquire a new role.\"\n\nIn 1822, Blake completed a short two-page dramatic piece which would prove to be the last of his illuminated manuscripts, entitled \"The Ghost of Abel A Revelation In the Visions of Jehovah Seen by William Blake\". Inscribed in the colophon of this text is \"W Blakes Original Stereotype was 1788\". It is almost universally agreed amongst Blakean scholars, that the \"Original Stereotype\" to which he here refers was \"All Religions are One\" and/or \"There is No Natural Religion\".\n\nDuring the 1770s, Blake had come to feel that one of the major problems with reproducing artwork in print was the division of labour by which it was achieved; one person would create a design (the artist), another would engrave it (the engraver), another print it (the printer) and another publish it (the publisher). It was unusual for artists to engrave their own designs, due primarily to the social status attached to each job; engraving was not seen as an especially exalted profession, and was instead regarded as nothing more than mechanical reproduction. Artists like James Barry and John Hamilton Mortimer were the exceptions to the norm insofar as they tended to engrave their own material. A further division in the process was that text and images were handled by different artisans; text was printed by means of a movable letterpress, whereas images were engraved, two very different jobs.\n\nDuring Blake's training as a professional copy engraver with James Basire during the 1770s, the most common method of engraving was stippling, which was thought to give a more accurate impression of the original picture than the previously dominant method, line engraving. Etching was also commonly used for layering in such aspects as landscape and background. All traditional methods of engraving and etching were intaglio, which meant that the design's outline was traced with a needle through an acid-resistant 'ground' which had been poured over the copperplate. The plate was then covered with acid, and the engraver went over the incised lines with a burin to allow the acid to bite into the furrows and eat into the copper itself. The acid would then be poured off, leaving the design incised on the plate. The engraver would then engrave the plate's entire surface with a web of crosshatched lines, before pouring the ink onto the plate and transferring it to the printing press.\n\nFrustrated with this method, Blake seems to have begun thinking about a new method of publishing at least as early as 1784, as in that year a rough description of what would become relief etching appears in his unpublished satire, \"An Island in the Moon\". Around the same time, George Cumberland had been experimenting with a method to allow him to reproduce handwriting via an etched plate, and Blake incorporated Cumberland's method into his own relief etching; treating the text as handwritten script rather than mechanical letterpress, and thus allowing him to make it a component of the image.\n\nBlake's great innovation in relief etching was to print from the relief, or raised, parts of the plate rather than the intaglio, or incised, parts. Whereas intaglio methods worked by creating furrows into which the acid was poured to create 'holes' in the plate and the ink then poured over the entire surface, Blake wrote and drew directly onto the plate with an acid-resistant material known as a stop-out. He would then embed the plate’s edges in strips of wax to create a self-contained tray and pour the acid about a quarter of an inch deep, thus causing the exposed parts of the plate to melt away, and the design and/or text to remain slightly above the rest of the plate, i.e. in relief, like a modern rubber stamp. The acid was then poured off, the wax was removed, and the raised part of the plate covered with ink before finally being pressed onto the paper in the printing press. This method allowed expressive effects which were impossible to achieve via intaglio. The major disadvantage was that text had to be written backwards as whatever was on the plate would print in reverse when pressed onto the paper. The dominant theory as to how Blake solved this problem is simply that he wrote in reverse. Another theory, suggested by David Bindman, is that Blake wrote his (acid resistant) text on a sheet of paper the correct way around, and then pressed the paper onto the plate, thus reversing the text and producing the same result as if had he written it backwards in the first place.\n\nBlake could also colour the plates themselves in coloured inks before pressing them or tint them with watercolours after printing. Because of this aspect, a major component of relief etching was that every page of every book was a unique piece of art; no two copies of any page in Blake's entire \"oeuvre\" are identical. Variations in the actual print, different colouring choices, repainted plates, accidents during the acid bath etc., all led to multiple examples of the same plate.\n\nBlake himself referred to relief etching as \"printing in the infernal method, by means of corrosives [...] melting apparent surfaces away, and displaying the infinite which was hid.\" A contemporary description of the method was provided by Blake's friend, J.T. Smith; \"writing his poetry, and drawing his marginal subjects of embellishments in outline upon the copper-plate with an impervious liquid, and then eating the plain parts or lights away with aquafortis considerably below them so that the outlines were left as Stereotype.\"\n\nRelief etching was the same basic method used for woodcutting, and copper relief etching had been practised in the early eighteenth century by Elisha Kirkall, but Blake was the first to use such a method to create both words and designs mixed together on the same plate. Apart from the unique aesthetic effects possible, a major advantage of relief etching was that Blake could print the material himself. Because the text was in relief, the pressure needed for printing was constant, unlike in intaglio printing, where different pressures were needed to force the paper into the furrows, depending on size. Additionally, intaglio etchings and engravings were printed with great pressure, but in relief etching, because the printed material was a raised surface rather than incised lines, considerably less pressure was required. As such, relief etching tackled the problem of the division of labour of publishing. Blake's new method was autographic; \"it permitted – indeed promoted – a seamless relationship between conception and execution rather than the usual divisions between invention and production embedded in eighteenth-century print technology, and its economic and social distinctions among authors, printers, artists and engravers. Like drawings and manuscripts, Blake's relief etchings were created by the direct and positive action of the author/artist's hand without intervening processes.\" Blake served as artist, engraver, printer \"and\" publisher.\n\nAlthough \"All Religions are One\" was etched in 1788, the only surviving copy (known as Copy A) was not printed until 1795; a large paper copy printed as part of a deluxe edition of Blake's collected illuminated manuscripts. Whether he had printed \"All Religions\" prior to 1795 is unknown. However, the fact that it is not mentioned in his 'To the Public' address of October 1793, where he listed all of his extant manuscripts up to that time except \"All Religions\" and \"No Natural Religion\", would suggest he had not.\n\nCopy A is located in The Huntington Library, except Plate 2 (title page), which exists in two impressions. The copy of the title page which goes with Copy A is located in the Geoffrey Keynes Collection in the Fitzwilliam Museum. The title page from another copy (colour printed in brown ink), the additional plates of which are unrecorded, is in the Victoria and Albert Museum.\n\n\"All Religions are One\" comprises ten plates, each of which is roughly 5.4 X 4 cm., with each paragraph on a separate plate, except Plate 10, which contains both Principal 7 and a short paragraph which functions as a conclusion to the series. In numerous cases, it seems as if the acid has eaten away too much of the relief, and Blake has had to go over sections with ink and wash, often touching the text and design outlines with pen. Several of the plates also bear evidence of rudimentary colour printing, a method with which Blake was experimenting in the 1790s, and these plates may represent his first attempts at this technique (whereby he used coloured inks to print rather than black). Several of the plates also feature examples of white line engraving, a technique where Blake would literally cut into the stop-out to create tiny furrows, which would be eaten away by the acid, creating a streak effect in the final print.\n\nThe black ink framing lines drawn around each design are thought to have been added at a later date, possibly in 1818, just prior to Blake giving the plates to John Linnell. The ink and wash work in the designs themselves may also have been executed at that time, although this cannot be ascertained for certain. It has been suggested that the framing lines may have been added due to the discrepancy between the size of the plates and the size of the paper (each sheet is 37.8 x 27 cm.).\nPlates 1 and 3–10 of the Huntington copy were acquired by John Linnell some time after 1818, with the missing title page replaced by an impression of the title page from \"There is No Natural Religion\". The plates were sold from the Linnell estate on 15 March 1918 to Henry E. Huntington. Plate 2 was acquired by George A. Smith in 1853. It may have subsequently been owned by William Muir, but was ultimately sold at Sotheby's by Sir Hickman Bacon on 21 July 1953, to Geoffrey Keynes, who donated it to the Fitzwilliam Museum in 1982.\n\nAfter the original 1795 printing, the text of \"All Religions\" was not published again until 1893, in \"The Works of William Blake, Poetic, Symbolic and Critical\", edited by W.B. Yeats and E.J. Ellis.\n\nUntil 1971, most editors tended to consider \"All Religions are One\" as later than \"There is No Natural Religion\". For example, in his 1905 book \"The poetical works of William Blake; a new and verbatim text from the manuscript engraved and letterpress originals\", John Sampson places \"No Natural Religion\" prior to \"All Religions\" in his 'Appendix to the Prophetic Books'. However, in 1971, Geoffrey Keynes argued that \"All Religions are One\" was the earlier of the two, based on what he saw as its \"greater technical imperfection.\" In his 1978 book, \"The Complete Graphic Works of William Blake\", David Bindman initially disagreed with Keynes, arguing that the imperfections in \"All Religions\" are not because of an earlier date of composition, but because of the increased complexity of the plates, with such complexity demonstrating Blake growing in confidence from the more rudimentary plates for \"No Natural Religion\". Most scholars however support Keynes, and \"All Religions are One\" precedes \"There is No Natural Religion\" in almost all modern anthologies of Blake's work; for example, Alicia Ostriker's \"William Blake: The Complete Poems\" (1977), David V. Erdman's 2nd edition of \"The Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake\" (1982), Morris Eaves', Robert N. Essick's and Joseph Viscomi's \"Blake's Illuminated Books, Volume 3: The Early Illuminated Books\" (1993), even Bindman's own \"The Complete Illuminated Books of William Blake\" (2003), and W.H. Stevenson's 3rd edition of \"Blake: The Complete Poems\" (2007).\n\nFurther evidence for Keynes hypothesis is discussed by Eaves, Essick and Viscomi, who, in counterpoint to Bindman, see the style of \"No Natural Religion\" as more confident than that of \"All Religions\". They especially cite the use of upright roman lettering in \"All Religions\" contrasted with the italic, cursive writing on several plates of \"No Natural Religion\"; \"this style was easier to execute since it required fewer independent strokes. And since the resulting dense matrix of lines provided better support for the inking dabber, italic permitted a shallower etch.\" Blake introduced italic script on plate a3 of \"No Natural Religion\", a script which he would use throughout the 1790s. Other evidence for an earlier dating of \"All Religions\" is that many of the individual letters themselves lean to the left, unlike in \"No Natural Religion\". This was a common problem in mirror writing, and its presence in \"All Religions\" but not \"No Natural Religion\" suggests Blake was only learning how to overcome it as he worked.\n\nWhen analysing \"All Religions are One\" it is important to remember that the images are not necessarily literal depictions of the text; \"the philosophical propositions [...] offer little visual imagery or even named objects. These qualities may have determined the relative independence of many of the designs from the accompanying text. The links are thematic and metaphoric, not direct and literal.\"\nThe central concern in \"All Religions are One\" is the notion of the \"Poetic Genius\", which is roughly analogous to the imagination. Blake argues that the Poetic Genius is greater than all else and \"is the true man.\" The Poetic Genius thus replaces traditional concepts of divinity insofar as \"The body or outward form of Man is derived from the Poetic Genius [...] the forms of all things are derived from their Genius. which by the Ancients was call'd an Angel & Spirit & Demon.\" Thus, the Poetic Genius supplants theological belief. This Poetic Genius is universal, common to all Mankind; \"as all men are alike in outward form [...] all men are alike in the Poetic Genius.\" Similarly, all philosophies are derived from the Poetic Genius; \"all sects of Philosophies are from the Poetic Genius adapted to the weaknesses of every individual\", and so too are all religions, which are merely expressions of the Poetic Genius; \"the Religions of all Nations are derived from each Nations different reception of the Poetic Genius which is everywhere call'd the Spirit of Prophecy,\" again emphasising the theological character of the Poetic Genius. Even the Bible originates with the Poetic Genius; \"The Jewish & Christian Testaments are An original derivation from the Poetic Genius.\" Thus, as all Men are alike in their Poetic Genius, and as all religions originate with the Poetic Genius, so too must all religions be alike, thus all religions are one.\n\nDavid Bindman classifies \"All Religions are One\" as \"a rather abstract dialogue with conventional theology,\" and in this sense, it is often interpreted as Blake's earliest engagement with deism and dualism. Similarly, Northrop Frye argues that Blake's theory that all religions are one is a \"visionary tolerance\" at odds with the \"rational tolerance\" of deism \"which holds that all religions are equally an attempt to solve an insoluble mystery.\" Working along the same lines, Florence Sandler argues that in these texts Blake \"set himself to the task of separating true religion from its perversions in his own age and in the Bible itself.\" Also concentrating on the refutation of deism, Alicia Ostriker refers to the series as a \"mockery of rationalism and an insistence on Man's potential infinitude.\" S. Foster Damon suggests that what Blake has done in \"All Religions are One\" is \"dethroned reason from its ancient place as the supreme faculty of man, replacing it with the Imagination.\" Damon also argues that \"Blake had completed his revolutionary theory of the nature of Man and proclaimed the unity of all true religions.\" Harold Bloom reaches much the same conclusion, suggesting that Blake is arguing for the \"primacy of the poetic imagination over all metaphysical and moral systems.\" A similar conclusion is reached by Denise Vultee, who argues that \"the two tractates are part of Blake's lifelong quarrel with the philosophy of Bacon, Newton, and Locke. Rejecting the rational empiricism of eighteenth-century deism or \"natural religion\", which looked to the material world for evidence of God's existence, Blake offers as an alternative the imaginative faculty or \"Poetic Genius\".\"\n\nIn terms of influences on Blake, in 1787 Henry Fuseli was working on a translation of J.C. Lavater's \"Aphorisms on Man\" for the publisher Joseph Johnson, when he hired Blake to engrave the frontispiece. Blake became so enamoured of Lavater's work that on the inside cover of his own copy of the book, he inscribed both his name and Lavater's, and drew a heart encompassing them. Blake also extensively annotated his own copy of \"Aphorisms\", and a number of critics have noted parallels between the Lavater annotations and Blake's own aphorisms in both \"All Religions\" and \"No Natural Religion\". S. Foster Damon specifically points to Lavater's first two aphorisms as having a strong influence on Blake;\n\n\nTo these points Blake has annotated \"This is true Christian philosophy far above all abstraction.\"\n\nAnother work which may also have influenced him is Emanuel Swedenborg's \"Heaven and Hell\" (1758). In his annotations to Swedenborg, Blake twice connects the word \"Lord\" with \"Poetic Genius\". During Swedenborg's discussion of the connection between the spiritual world and the natural world, Blake writes \"He who Loves feels love descend into him & if he has wisdom may perceive it is from the Poetic Genius which is the Lord.\" Shortly thereafter, to Swedenborg's \"the negation of God constitutes Hell\", Blake annotates \"the negation of the Poetic Genius.\"\n\nWhile the Lavater and Swedenborg influences are somewhat speculative, the importance of Bacon, Newton and Locke is not, as it is known that Blake despised empiricism from an early age. In 1808, as he annotated \"The Works of Sir Joshua Reynolds\", Blake wrote\n\nHarold Bloom also cites the work of Anthony Collins, Matthew Tindal and John Toland as having an influence on Blake's thoughts. In a more general sense, \"Blake sees the school of Bacon and Locke as the foundation of natural religion, the deistic attempt to prove the existence of God on the basis of sensate experience and its rational investigation.\" To that end, Blake \"manipulates the syncretic mythology of Jacob Bryant, Paul Henri Mallet, and perhaps other founders of what has become the comparative study of religion, to argue for the existence of a universal and supra-rational 'Poetic Genius' that expresses itself through the shared (though ever various) forms of all religions.\"\n\nIn relation to his later work, Northrop Frye sees \"All Religions are One\" and \"There is No Natural Religion\" as forming a fundamental statement of intent for Blake, a kind of pre-emptive outline of his future work, \"a summarised statement of the doctrines of the engraved canon.\" Similarly, Eaves, Essick and Viscomi state that they \"contain some of Blake's most fundamental principles and reveal the foundation for later development in his thought and art.\" W.H. Stevenson calls them \"a very early statement of fundamental opinions [Blake] held all his life.\" As an example of how Blake returned to the specific themes of \"All Religions\", in \"The Marriage of Heaven and Hell\" (1790), he writes \"the Poetic Genius was the first principle and all the others merely derivative\" (12:22–24).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "178870", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=178870", "title": "Atavism", "text": "Atavism\n\nIn biology, an atavism is a modification of a biological structure whereby an ancestral trait reappears after having been lost through evolutionary change in previous generations. Atavisms can occur in several ways; one of which is when genes for previously existing phenotypic features are preserved in DNA, and these become expressed through a mutation that either knocks out the overriding genes for the new traits or makes the old traits override the new one. A number of traits can vary as a result of shortening of the fetal development of a trait (neoteny) or by prolongation of the same. In such a case, a shift in the time a trait is allowed to develop before it is fixed can bring forth an ancestral phenotype. Atavisms are often seen as evidence of evolution.\n\nIn social sciences, atavism is the tendency of reversion. For example, people in the modern era reverting to the ways of thinking and acting of a former time. The word \"atavism\" is derived from the Latin \"atavus\"—a great-great-great-grandfather or, more generally, an ancestor.\n\nEvolutionarily traits that have disappeared phenotypically do not necessarily disappear from an organism's DNA. The gene sequence often remains, but is inactive. Such an unused gene may remain in the genome for many generations. As long as the gene remains intact, a fault in the genetic control suppressing the gene can lead to it being expressed again. Sometimes, the expression of dormant genes can be induced by artificial stimulation.\n\nAtavisms have been observed in humans, such as with infants born with vestigial tails (called a \"coccygeal process\", \"coccygeal projection\", or \"caudal appendage\"). Atavism can also be seen in humans who possess large teeth, like those of other primates. In addition, a case of \"snake heart\", the presence of \"coronary circulation and myocardial architecture [which resemble] those of the reptilian heart\", has also been reported in medical literature.\n\nOther examples of observed atavisms include:\n\nAtavism is a term in Joseph Schumpeter's explanation of World War I in twentieth-century liberal Europe. He defends the liberal international relations theory that an international society built on commerce will avoid war because of war's destructiveness and comparative cost. His reason for World War I is termed \"atavism\", in which he asserts that senescent governments in Europe (those of the German Empire, Russian Empire, Ottoman Empire, and Austro-Hungarian Empire) pulled the liberal Europe into war, and that the liberal regimes of the other continental powers did not cause it. He used this idea to say that liberalism and commerce would continue to have a soothing effect in international relations, and that war would not arise between nations which are connected by commercial ties. University of London professor Guy Standing has identified three distinct sub-groups of the precariat, one of which he refers to as \"atavists\", who long for what they see as a lost past.\n\nDuring the interval between the acceptance of evolution in the mid-1800s and the rise of the modern understanding of genetics in the early 1900s, atavism was used to account for the reappearance in an individual of a trait after several generations of absence—often called a \"throw-back\". The idea that atavisms could be made to accumulate by selective breeding, or breeding back, led to breeds such as the Heck cattle. This had been bred from ancient landraces with selected primitive traits, in an attempt of \"reviving\" the aurochs, an extinct species of wild cattle. The same notions of atavisms were used by social Darwinists, who claimed that inferior races displayed atavistic traits, and represented more primitive traits than their own race. Both atavisms and Ernst Haeckel's recapitulation theory are related evolutionary progress, as development towards greater complexity and superior ability.\n\nIn addition, the concept of atavism as part of an individualistic explanation of the causes of criminal deviance was popularised by the Italian criminologist Cesare Lombroso in the 1870s. He attempted to identify physical characteristics common to criminals and labeled those he found as atavistic, 'throw-back' traits that determined 'primitive' criminal behavior. His statistical evidence and the closely related idea of eugenics have long since been abandoned by the scientific community, but the concept that physical traits may affect the likelihood of criminal or unethical behavior in a person still has some scientific support.\n\n\n"}

According to Jacob Joshua Ross, \"while the non-Jewish students of Delmedigo may have classified him as an “Averroist”, he clearly saw himself as a follower of Maimonides\". But, according to other scholars, Delmedigo was clearly a strong follower of Averroes' doctrines, even the more radical ones: unity of intellect, eternity of the world, autonomy of reason from the boundaries of revealed religion.\n\nBorn in Candia, on the island of Crete, (at that time was under the control of the Venetian Republic), whither his family had emigrated from Germany, he spent ten years in Rome and in Padua in northern Italy, returning to Candia at the end of his life.\n\nHe is remembered for a number of translations, commentaries on Averroes (Ibn Rushd in Arabic) (notably a commentary on Averroes' \"Substantia Orbis\" in 1485), for his influence on many Italian Platonists of the early Renaissance (especially Giovanni Pico della Mirandola), and for his treatise on Jewish philosophy, \"Sefer Beḥinat ha-Dat\" (\"The Examination of Religion\"), published many years after his death, in 1629.\n\nDel Medigo had a traditional religious upbringing in Candia, demonstrating considerable breadth. In addition to rabbinic learning, he studied philosophy, and had a good knowledge of Italian, Greek, as well as Latin and Hebrew. It is likely that he also studied medicine, and it may have been with that intention that he originally went to Padua, where the University was the most important center for traditional Aristotelian philosophy in Italy. By 1480, he was in Venice, where he wrote \"Quaestio utrum mundus sit effectus\", and supported himself by giving classes in Aristotelian philosophy attended by the sons of wealthy and important families.\n\nHe moved to Perugia and taught classes in \"radical Aristotelianism,\" that is, heavily interpreted with the ideas of Averroes and other Islamic commentators. Del Medigo became quite well known as a major Averroist in Italy. While in Perugia, he met Pico, and wrote two pamphlets for him.\n\nAnother important student of del Medigo's at that time was Domenico Grimani, a Venetian, who eventually became the Cardinal of San Marco. Grimani proved to be a consistent patron, and with his encouragement, del Medigo wrote several manuscripts which received wide distribution among Italian philosophers.\n\nHe stayed in close contact with Pico, traveling to Florence, the site of Marsilio Ficino's Platonic Academy, to give classes and to translate manuscripts from Hebrew to Latin for Pico.\n\nIn the end, however, Del Medigo was no Kabbalist, and he became disenchanted with the syncretic direction Pico and his colleagues were moving in, a tendency to combine concepts of magic, Hermeticism and Kabbalah with Plato and Neoplatonism.\n\nIn addition to his increasing disappointment with Pico, he was somewhat discredited himself by the backlash from Pico's imprisonment and the interdiction by the Vatican of his 900 Theses. Furthermore, tension arose between del Medigo and the Italian Jewish community over his secular intellectual interests and his associations with gentile scholars. As a consequence of the financial difficulties he experienced in the wake of Pico's disfavor, del Medigo decided to leave Italy for good. He went back to Crete, where he spent the last years of his life. During this period, del Medigo returned to Jewish thought, writing the \"Sefer Bechinat Ha-dath\" for his students, in which he clarified his disagreement with the magical and Kabbalistic theories that inspired Pico's \"Oration on the Dignity of Man\", and expounded his belief that a human being cannot aspire to become a god, and that Judaism requires that a man must \"fight for rationality, sobriety and the realization of [his] human limitations.\"\n\nDelmedigo argued against the antiquity of the Kabbalah, noting that it was not known to the sages of the Talmud, or to the geonim, or to Rashi. He also denies that Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai was the author of the Zohar, since that work mentions people who lived after the death of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai. In addition, he attacks the esoteric allegorists among Jewish philosophers. In another section of his work Delmedigo discusses the intellectual reasoning underlying the commandments of Torah (ta'amei ha-mitzvot).\n\nHis descendant Joseph Delmedigo was a famous rabbi, philosopher and a staunch defender of the Kabbalah.\n\nElia del Medigo is likely the inspiration for the fictional character Judah del Medigo, in \"The Secret Book of Grazia dei Rossi\" by Jacqueline Park.\n\n\n\n"}

He was a disciple of Philolaus, and Diogenes Laërtius mentions him among the teachers of Plato, though this statement is very doubtful. It is uncertain whether Eurytus was the author of any work, unless we suppose that the fragment in Stobaeus, which is there ascribed to one Eurytus, belongs to this Eurytus. \n\nThrough a dubious commentary to Aristotle's \"Metaphysics\" a caricatural image of Eurytus has gained wide currency. A mediaeval writer confused with Alexander of Aphrodisias presented Eurytos as a kind of mosaic-setter who delineated various shapes with some definite number of pebbles.\nReviel Netz forcefully commented that \"pseudo-Alexander’s picture of Eurytus the mosaicist is a non-starter for it is evidently idiotic\"and he noted that \"while Theophrastus and Aristotle both consider Eurytus’ results patently false, nothing suggests they consider his procedure silly\".

{"id": "310316", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=310316", "title": "Franz Joseph Gall", "text": "Franz Joseph Gall\n\nFranz Josef Gall (; 9 March 175822 August 1828) was a neuroanatomist, physiologist, and pioneer in the study of the localization of mental functions in the brain.\n\nClaimed as the founder of phrenology, Gall was an early and important researcher in his fields. His contributions to the field of neuropsychology were controversial at the time and now widely referred to as pseudoscience. However, Gall's study of phrenology helped establish psychology as a science, contributed to the emergence of the naturalistic approach to the study of man, and played an important part in the development of evolutionist theories, anthropology, and sociology.\n\nGall was born in the village of Tiefenbronn to a wealthy Roman Catholic wool merchant. The Galls, originally a noble family from Lombardy, had been the leading family in the area for over a century. His father was the mayor of Tiefenbronn and he was one of 12 children, only 7 of whom lived to adulthood.\n\nGall's scientific inquiry began in his youth. As a boy, he was fascinated by the differences between himself, his siblings, and his classmates. He developed an early interest in the brain after making a connection between one classmate's odd shaped skull and advanced language abilities. He enjoyed collecting and categorizing plants and animals. He also realized the importance of observation as a scientific technique at a young age.\n\nAs the second eldest son, he was intended for the priesthood but chose instead to study medicine at the University of Strasbourg. In his advanced studies, he again made observations about his classmates. He noticed that many of the particularly bright students had prominent eyeballs and concluded that this could not be purely coincidental. \n\nHe later completed his degree in Vienna, Austria. While in medical school, he studied under Johann Hermann and Maximilian Stoll who impressed upon him the importance of natural observation. He took his first job at Lunatic Asylum making observations about the insane. He then opened up his own successful private practice and became so popular he even gave well attended lectures to the public. He was offered the position as head Austrian Court physician but decided to remain in private practice and research.\n\nBased on his early observations about the skull sizes and facial features of his classmates, Gall developed the theory of Organology and the method of Cranioscopy that would later be known as Phrenology. Gall's version of Organology states that the mind is a collection of independent entities housed within the brain. Cranioscopy is a method to determine the personality and development of mental and moral faculties on the basis of the external shape of the skull. During his lifetime, Gall collected and observed over 120 skulls in order to test his hypotheses.\n\nGall believed that the bumps and uneven geography of the human skull were caused by pressure exerted from the brain underneath. He divided the brain into sections that corresponded to certain behaviors and traits that he called fundamental faculties. This is referred to as localization of function. Gall believed there were 27 fundamental faculties, among them were: recollection of people, mechanical ability, talent for poetry, love of property, and even a murder instinct. Based on the surface of a person's skull, Gall could make assumptions about that person's fundamental faculties and therefore their character.\n\nGall disagreed with Philippe Pinel and Peter Camper that the larger brain the larger one's intellectual power. However, after numerous dissections and observations he was able to assert that a mature skull under 14 inches in circumference was not able to function normally.\n\nIn 1800, Johann Spurzheim attended one of Gall's public lectures and was hired as an assistant to help with public medical demonstrations. In 1804, he became Gall's full-time research partner. They worked together for years to develop theories about brain localization and function. In 1813, Spurzheim separated from Gall in order to make a name for himself in Britain. Gall would later accuse Spurzheim of plagiarism and perverting his work. It was Spurzheim who would give the name Phrenology to Gall's theories.\n\nOther than his contributions to Phrenology, Gall is lesser known for his other achievements. While developing his theories on localization of function, Gall significantly advanced the science of dissection. Instead of slicing randomly, as had been the practice in previous years, Gall's method involved slow exploration of the entire brain structure and the separation of individual fibers. This shift in methodology was extremely influential in future discoveries of the brain.\n\nGall also researched and theorized about language, communication, and the brain. He argued that pantomime, or the science of gesture, was a universal language for all animals and humans. He believed every living thing was born with the ability to understand gestures on some level.\n\nIn 1823, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.\n\nHe published a book titled \"On the Functions of the Brain and of Each of Its parts: With Observations on the Possibility of Determining the Instincts, Propensities, and Talents, Or the Moral and Intellectual Dispositions of Men and Animals, by the Configuration of the Brain and Head\" detailing his vast research on brain function and localization. It was translated to English in 1835 by Lewis Winslow.\n\nGall's concepts on brain localization were revolutionary, and caused religious leaders and some scientists to take exception. The Roman Catholic Church considered his theory as contrary to religion. Established science also condemned these ideas for lack of scientific proof of his theory. Still others attempted to discredit Gall because they believed he had not given rightful credit to the theories and scientists who influenced him. Étienne-Jean Georget accused Gall of stealing Charles Bonnet's basic idea of brain localization that he had written about over 60 years earlier.\n\nHis ideas were also not acceptable to the court of the emperor Joseph II (the brother of Marie Antoinette). The Austrian government accused Gall of being a materialist and banned his ideas because of their threat to public morality. Due to this opposition, Gall left his lecturer position in Austria. He sought a teaching position in Germany and eventually settled in Paris. Revolutionary France was most likely the most hospitable place for Gall's theories. However, Napoleon Bonaparte, the ruling emperor, and the scientific establishment led by the Institute of France, pronounced his science as invalid. Despite all this, Gall was able to secure a comfortable existence on the basis of his speciality. He became a celebrity of sorts as he was accepted into Parisian intellectual salons.\n\nGall's phrenological theories and practices were best accepted in England, where the ruling class used it to justify the \"inferiority\" of its colonial subjects. It also became very popular in the USA from 1820 to 1850. One interesting influence was on psychiatry, where the South Italian psychiatrist Biagio Gioacchino Miraglia proposed a new classification of mental illness based on brain functions as they were conceived in Gall’s phrenology.\n\nIn spite of many problems associated with his work, Gall made significant contributions to neurological science. He died in Paris, on 22 August 1828. Although married, he remained childless. Some direct descendants of his brothers lived in Germany until 1949. A collection of his skulls can be seen at the Rollett Museum in Baden bei Wien, Austria, where several of his relatives now live.\n\nToday, phrenology is thought of as a huge mis-step by the scientific community. The idea that a person's personality could be determined by the shape of their skull has been repeatedly disproven. But at the time, Gall's arguments were persuasive and intriguing. Even though phrenology is now known to be incorrect, Gall did set the groundwork for modern neuroscience by spreading the idea of functional localization within the brain.\n\nThe misuse of Gall's ideas and work to justify discrimination were deliberately furthered by his associates, including Johann Spurzheim. Later, others tried to improve on his theories with systems such as characterology.\n\nGall's theories had an influence both on the Italian criminologist Cesare Lombroso and on his French rival, Alexandre Lacassagne. He also influenced the French anatomist, Paul Broca.\n\n"}
{"id": "305084", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=305084", "title": "Freedom Evolves", "text": "Freedom Evolves\n\nFreedom Evolves is a 2003 popular science and philosophy book by Daniel C. Dennett. Dennett describes the book as an installment of a lifelong philosophical project, earlier parts of which were \"The Intentional Stance\", \"Consciousness Explained\" and \"Elbow Room\". It attempts to give an account of free will and moral responsibility which is complementary to Dennett's other views on consciousness and personhood.\n\nAs in \"Consciousness Explained\", Dennett advertises the controversial nature of his views extensively in advance. He expects hostility from those who fear that a skeptical analysis of freedom will undermine people's belief in the reality of moral considerations; he likens himself to an interfering crow who insists on telling Dumbo he doesn't really need the feather he believes is allowing him to fly.\n\nDennett's stance on free will is compatibilism with an evolutionary twist – the view that, although in the strict physical sense our actions might be pre-determined, we can still be free in all the ways that matter, because of the abilities we evolved. Free will, seen this way, is about freedom to make decisions without duress (and so is a version of Kantian positive practical free will, i.e., Kantian autonomy), as opposed to an impossible and unnecessary freedom from causality itself. To clarify this distinction, he uses the term 'evitability' (the opposite of 'inevitability'), defining it as the ability of an agent to anticipate likely consequences and act to avoid undesirable ones. \"Evitability\" is entirely compatible with, and actually requires, human action being deterministic.\nDennett moves on to altruism, denying that it requires acting to the benefit of others without gaining any benefit yourself. He argues that it should be understood in terms of helping yourself by helping others, expanding the self to be more inclusive as opposed to being selfless. To show this blend, he calls such actions 'benselfish', and finds the roots of our capacity for this in the evolutionary pressures that produced kin selection. \nIn his treatment of both free will and altruism, he starts by showing why we should not accept the traditional definitions of either term.\n\nDennett also suggests that adherence to high ethical standards might pay off for the individual, because if others know your behaviour is restricted in these ways, the scope for certain beneficial mutual arrangements is enhanced. This is related to game theoretical considerations: in the famous Prisoner's Dilemma, 'moral' agents who cooperate will be more successful than 'non-moral' agents who do not cooperate. Cooperation wouldn't seem to naturally arise since agents are tempted to 'defect' and restore a Nash equilibrium, which is often not the best possible solution for all involved. Dennett concludes by contemplating the possibility that people might be able to opt in or out of moral responsibility: surely, he suggests, given the benefits, they would choose to opt in, especially given that opting out includes such things as being imprisoned or institutionalized.\n\nDaniel Dennett also argues that no clear conclusion about volition can be derived from Benjamin Libet's experiments supposedly demonstrating the non-existence of conscious volition. According to Dennett, ambiguities in the timings of the different events are involved. Libet tells when the readiness potential occurs objectively, using electrodes, but relies on the subject reporting the position of the hand of a clock to determine when the conscious decision was made. As Dennett points out, this is only a report of where it \"seems\" to the subject that various things come together, not of the objective time at which they actually occur.\nSuppose Libet knows that your readiness potential peaked at millisecond 6,810 of the experimental trial, and the clock dot was straight down (which is what you reported you saw) at millisecond 7,005. How many milliseconds should he have to add to this number to get the time you were conscious of it? The light gets from your clock face to your eyeball almost instantaneously, but the path of the signals from retina through lateral geniculate nucleus to striate cortex takes 5 to 10 milliseconds—a paltry fraction of the 300 milliseconds offset, but how much longer does it take them to get to \"you\". (Or are you located in the striate cortex?) The visual signals have to be processed before they arrive at wherever they need to arrive for you to make a conscious decision of simultaneity. Libet's method presupposes, in short, that we can locate the \"intersection\" of two trajectories:\nso that these events occur side-by-side as it were in place where their simultaneity can be noted.\n\nDennett spends a chapter criticising Robert Kane's theory of libertarian free will. Kane believes freedom is based on certain rare and exceptional events, which he calls self-forming actions or SFA's. Dennett notes that there is no guarantee such an event will occur in an individual's life. If it does not, the individual does not in fact have free will at all, according to Kane. Yet they will seem the same as anyone else. Dennett finds an essentially \"indetectable\" notion of free will to be incredible.\n\n"}
{"id": "1333889", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1333889", "title": "Fuke-shū", "text": "Fuke-shū\n\nFuke monks or priests (komusō) were noted for playing the shakuhachi bamboo flute as a form of meditation known as suizen (\"blowing meditation\"), an innovation from the earlier zazen (\"sitting meditation\") of other Zen sects. Fuke Zen was characterized in the public imagination of Japan by its monks' playing of the shakuhachi flute while wearing a large woven basket hat that covered their entire head as they went on pilgrimage.\n\nThe theoretical basis of Fuke-shū was to emphasise the concept of the incommunicable aspect of enlightenment, an ideal traced to various Buddhist sects and relayed in paradoxical Zen writings such as the \"Lankavatara Sutra\", the \"Diamond Sutra\" and Bodhidharma's \"Bloodstream sermon\". Thus Fuke monks rarely chanted sutras or other Buddhist texts, but rather relied upon scores of sacred shakuhachi music called \"honkyoku\" to express and transmit awakening.\n\nThe sect technically continues to exist (albeit in a less organized form) through the lineage of the contemporary \"Kyochiku Zenji Hosan Kai\" (KZHK) group in Kyoto—which organizes annual meetings for hundreds of shakuhachi players, Rinzai clerics, and Fuke Zen enthusiasts—and the related Myōan Society, as well as other small groups throughout Japan. KZHK and the Myōan Society operate from their base temples of Tōfuku-ji and Myōan-ji, the latter being the former headquarters of the Fuke sect. Many Rinzai monks still practice as komusō during certain celebrations in former Fuke-shū temples that have, since the 19th century, reverted to traditional Rinzai Zen. Notable temples include Kokutai-ji and Ichigatsu-ji.\n\nAt least several particular individuals in modern times have been known to pursue temporary itinerant lifestyles as komusō, for spiritual or learning purposes. Hõzan Murata, a famous shakuhachi player, maker, and \"dai-shihan\" (grandmaster), lived as a komusō for 8 months in 1974. Perhaps the most well known contemporary komusō are Kokū Nishimura—who famously carried on the tradition of dubbing shakuhachi \"kyotaku\" (\"empty bell\"), in reference to the legend of Puhua (Fuke)—and Watazumi Doso, known for his innovations with and revitalization of the shakuhachi repertoire, and the popularization of the hotchiku.\n\nFuke-shū, according to some accounts, is derived from the teachings of the Chinese Zen teacher Linji Yixuan (c. 800–866), known in Japan as Rinzai Gigen. However, the Fuke school counted as its founder one of Linji's contemporaries Pǔhuà (普化), whose name is read as Fuke in Japanese. Puhua was reputedly a multi-talented monk, known for being inventive and at the same time quite strict. The notion of Puhua as founder is also supported by several references in the \"Record of Linji\", as well as the \"Kyotaku Denki\". (Although the latter was later confirmed as a fabrication used to further the komusōs' benefits under the Tokugawa shogunate.)\n\nOne story of Puhua particularly demonstrates his unique style of nonverbal Chán:\nWhen Panshan Baoji was near death, he said to the monks, \"Is there anyone among you who can draw my likeness?\"\n\nMany of the monks made drawings for Panshan, but none were to his liking.\n\nThe monk Puhua stepped forward and said, \"I can draw it.\"\n\nPanshan said, \"Why don't you show it to me?\"\n\nPuhua then turned a somersault and went out.\n\nPanshan said, \"Someday, that fellow will teach others in a crazy manner!\"\n\nHaving said these words, Panshan passed away.\nMany stories about Puhua that appear in the Record of Linji add to his reputation of having a rough and uncompromising manner of expressing the dharma. For example:\n44.a. One day the master (Linji Yixuan) and Puhua went to a vegetarian banquet given them by a believer. During it, the master asked Puhua: \"'A hair swallows the vast ocean, a mustard seed contains Mt. Sumeru' – does this happen by means of supernatural powers, or is the whole body (substance, essence) like this?\" Puhua kicked over the table. The master said: \"Rough fellow.\" Puhua retorted: \"What place is this here to speak of rough and refined ?\"\n\nb. The next day, they went again to a vegetarian banquet. During it, the master asked: \"Today's fare, how does it compare with yesterday's?\" Puhua (as before) kicked over the table. The master said: \"Understand it you do – but still, you are a rough fellow.\" Puhua replied: \"Blind fellow, does one preach of any roughness or finesse in the Buddha-Dharma?\" The master stuck out his tongue.\nThere is some controversy as to the degree and nature of his musical talents, but his followers would often reflect on a certain story for inspiration: the story describes Puhua going through his hometown, ringing a bell to summon others to enlightenment. The same, for many Fuke practitioners, applied to the shakuhachi, and its mastery was seen as a path to enlightenment.\n\nThe death of Puhua is recounted in the Record of Linji. In addition to giving a special importance to Puhua's ringing bell, it is particularly striking as a story of Buddhist resurrection that equals the famous resurrection story of Bodhidharma, the Indian master who brought the Ekayana school from India to China, which became the Chan sect of Buddhism. The story:\n65. One day at the street market Fuke was begging all and sundry to give him a robe. Everybody offered him one, but he did not want any of them. The master Linji made the superior buy a coffin, and when Fuke returned, said to him: \"There, I had this robe made for you.\" Fuke shouldered the coffin, and went back to the street market, calling loudly: \"Rinzai had this robe made for me! I am off to the East Gate to enter transformation\" (to die). The people of the market crowded after him, eager to look. Fuke said: \"No, not today. Tomorrow, I shall go to the South Gate to enter transformation.\" And so for three days. Nobody believed it any longer. On the fourth day, and now without any spectators, Fuke went alone outside the city walls, and laid himself into the coffin. He asked a traveler who chanced by to nail down the lid.\n\nThe news spread at once, and the people of the market rushed there. On opening the coffin, they found that the body had vanished, but from high up in the sky they heard the ring of his hand bell.\nFuke Zen was brought to Japan by Shinchi Kakushin (心地覺心)(1207–1298), also known as Muhon Kakushin (無本覺心) and posthumously as Hotto Kokushi (法燈國師). Kakushin had travelled to China for six years and studied with the famous Chinese Chan master Wumen (無門) of the Linji lineage. Kakushin became a disciple of Chôsan, a 17th generation teacher of the Fuke sect of China.\n\nAlthough it no longer exists as a religious organization, during the feudal period, Fuke Zen's following was quite extensive. Its members could be easily recognized by their practice of playing the shakuhachi flute, which was considered a form of meditation, termed suizen (吹禪). These musician-monks were known at first as \"komosō\" (薦僧; literally \"straw-mat monks\") and, by the mid-17th century, as \"komusō\" (虚無僧; literally \"emptiness monk\").\n\nFuke Zen in general stressed pilgrimage, and its adherents were mostly lay-practitioners rather than clergymen. During the Edo period (1603–1867), many rōnin became incorporated into the sect, and due to the temperaments of these former samurai, the sect gained the reputation of harbouring troublemakers. Members of the Fuke sect were also given permission by the Bakufu government of the time to travel freely throughout the country, a significant dispensation considering the severe travel restrictions of the time. In reality, some of the Fuke monks were spies for the Bakufu government, a practice which helped seal the sect's demise when the government itself fell.\n\nFuke, which had initially been a loose affiliation of monks and lay pilgrims, solidified as a sect around 1700. However, the sect died out in 1871 following the Meiji Restoration. The new government promulgated a grand council proclamation banning the practice of Fuke Zen and playing the shakuhachi for religious reasons. This is because, as described above, in practice many of the Fuke were spies and informers for the government. Practice of the shakuhachi was banned entirely for four years by the Meiji government, after which it was decreed that secular playing was permitted. From that time onward the playing of original Fuke pieces, honkyoku, made a very slow recovery. The recovery is continuing to this day.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Galileo has been called the \"father of observational astronomy\", the \"father of modern physics\", the \"father of the scientific method\", and the \"father of modern science\".\n\nGalileo studied speed and velocity, gravity and free fall, the principle of relativity, inertia, projectile motion and also worked in applied science and technology, describing the properties of pendulums and \"hydrostatic balances\", inventing the thermoscope and various military compasses, and using the telescope for scientific observations of celestial objects. His contributions to observational astronomy include the telescopic confirmation of the phases of Venus, the observation of the four largest satellites of Jupiter, the observation of Saturn and the analysis of sunspots.\n\nGalileo's championing of heliocentrism and Copernicanism was controversial during his lifetime, when most subscribed to either geocentrism or the Tychonic system. He met with opposition from astronomers, who doubted heliocentrism because of the absence of an observed stellar parallax. The matter was investigated by the Roman Inquisition in 1615, which concluded that heliocentrism was \"foolish and absurd in philosophy, and formally heretical since it explicitly contradicts in many places the sense of Holy Scripture.\" Galileo later defended his views in \"Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems\" (1632), which appeared to attack Pope Urban VIII and thus alienated him and the Jesuits, who had both supported Galileo up until this point. He was tried by the Inquisition, found \"vehemently suspect of heresy\", and forced to recant. He spent the rest of his life under house arrest. While under house arrest, he wrote \"Two New Sciences\", in which he summarized work he had done some forty years earlier on the two sciences now called kinematics and strength of materials.\n\nGalileo was born in Pisa (then part of the Duchy of Florence), Italy, on 15 February 1564, the first of six children of Vincenzo Galilei, a famous lutenist, composer, and music theorist, and Giulia (née Ammannati), who had married in 1562. Galileo became an accomplished lutenist himself and would have learned early from his father a scepticism for established authority, the value of well-measured or quantified experimentation, an appreciation for a periodic or musical measure of time or rhythm, as well as the results expected from a combination of mathematics and experiment.\n\nThree of Galileo's five siblings survived infancy. The youngest, Michelangelo (or Michelagnolo), also became a noted lutenist and composer although he contributed to financial burdens during Galileo's young adulthood. Michelangelo was unable to contribute his fair share of their father's promised dowries to their brothers-in-law, who would later attempt to seek legal remedies for payments due. Michelangelo would also occasionally have to borrow funds from Galileo to support his musical endeavours and excursions. These financial burdens may have contributed to Galileo's early desire to develop inventions that would bring him additional income.\n\nWhen Galileo Galilei was eight, his family moved to Florence, but he was left with Jacopo Borghini for two years. He was educated from 1575 to 1578 in the Vallombrosa Abbey, about 30 km southeast of Florence.\n\nThe surname Galilei derives from the given name of an ancestor, Galileo Bonaiuti, a physician, university teacher and politician who lived in Florence from 1370 to 1450; his descendants had changed their family name from Bonaiuti (or Buonaiuti) to Galilei in his honor in the late 14th century. Galileo Bonaiuti was buried in the same church, the Basilica of Santa Croce in Florence, where about 200 years later his more famous descendant Galileo Galilei was also buried.\n\nIt was common for mid-sixteenth-century Tuscan families to name the eldest son after the parents' surname. Hence, Galileo Galilei was not necessarily named after his ancestor Galileo Bonaiuti. The Italian male given name \"Galileo\" (and thence the surname \"Galilei\") derives from the Latin \"Galilaeus\", meaning \"of Galilee\", a biblically significant region in Northern Israel. Because of that region, the adjective \"galilaios\" (Greek \"γαλιλαίος\", Latin \"Galilaeus\", Italian \"galileo\"), which means \"Galilean\", has been used in antiquity (particularly by emperor Julian) to refer to Christ and his followers; after this, the adjective has been adopted as a name with a meaning similar to \"Jesus\" or \"Christian\".\n\nThe biblical roots of Galileo's name and surname were to become the subject of a famous pun. In 1614, during the Galileo affair, one of Galileo's opponents, the Dominican priest Tommaso Caccini, delivered against Galileo a controversial and influential sermon. In it he made a point of quoting Acts , \"Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven?\".\n\nDespite being a genuinely pious Roman Catholic, Galileo fathered three children out of wedlock with Marina Gamba. They had two daughters, Virginia (born in 1600) and Livia (born in 1601), and a son, Vincenzo (born in 1606).\n\nBecause of their illegitimate birth, their father considered the girls unmarriageable, if not posing problems of prohibitively expensive support or dowries, which would have been similar to Galileo's previous extensive financial problems with two of his sisters. Their only worthy alternative was the religious life. Both girls were accepted by the in Arcetri and remained there for the rest of their lives. Virginia took the name Maria Celeste upon entering the convent. She died on 2 April 1634, and is buried with Galileo at the Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence. Livia took the name Sister Arcangela and was ill for most of her life. Vincenzo was later legitimised as the legal heir of Galileo and married Sestilia Bocchineri.\n\nAlthough Galileo seriously considered the priesthood as a young man, at his father's urging he instead enrolled in 1580 at the University of Pisa for a medical degree. In 1581, when he was studying medicine, he noticed a swinging chandelier, which air currents shifted about to swing in larger and smaller arcs. To him, it seemed, by comparison with his heartbeat, that the chandelier took the same amount of time to swing back and forth, no matter how far it was swinging. When he returned home, he set up two pendulums of equal length and swung one with a large sweep and the other with a small sweep and found that they kept time together. It was not until the work of Christiaan Huygens, almost one hundred years later, that the tautochrone nature of a swinging pendulum was used to create an accurate timepiece. Up to this point, Galileo had deliberately been kept away from mathematics, since a physician earned a higher income than a mathematician. However, after accidentally attending a lecture on geometry, he talked his reluctant father into letting him study mathematics and natural philosophy instead of medicine. He created a thermoscope, a forerunner of the thermometer, and, in 1586, published a small book on the design of a hydrostatic balance he had invented (which first brought him to the attention of the scholarly world). Galileo also studied \"disegno\", a term encompassing fine art, and, in 1588, obtained the position of instructor in the Accademia delle Arti del Disegno in Florence, teaching perspective and chiaroscuro. Being inspired by the artistic tradition of the city and the works of the Renaissance artists, Galileo acquired an aesthetic mentality. While a young teacher at the Accademia, he began a lifelong friendship with the Florentine painter Cigoli, who included Galileo's lunar observations in one of his paintings.\n\nIn 1589, he was appointed to the chair of mathematics in Pisa. In 1591, his father died, and he was entrusted with the care of his younger brother Michelagnolo. In 1592, he moved to the University of Padua where he taught geometry, mechanics, and astronomy until 1610. During this period, Galileo made significant discoveries in both pure fundamental science (for example, kinematics of motion and astronomy) as well as practical applied science (for example, strength of materials and pioneering the telescope). His multiple interests included the study of astrology, which at the time was a discipline tied to the studies of mathematics and astronomy.\n\nCardinal Bellarmine had written in 1615 that the Copernican system could not be defended without \"a true physical demonstration that the sun does not circle the earth but the earth circles the sun\". Galileo considered his theory of the tides to provide the required physical proof of the motion of the earth. This theory was so important to him that he originally intended to entitle his \"Dialogue on the Two Chief World Systems\" the \"Dialogue on the Ebb and Flow of the Sea\". The reference to tides was removed from the title by order of the Inquisition.\n\nFor Galileo, the tides were caused by the sloshing back and forth of water in the seas as a point on the Earth's surface sped up and slowed down because of the Earth's rotation on its axis and revolution around the Sun. He circulated his first account of the tides in 1616, addressed to Cardinal Orsini. His theory gave the first insight into the importance of the shapes of ocean basins in the size and timing of tides; he correctly accounted, for instance, for the negligible tides halfway along the Adriatic Sea compared to those at the ends. As a general account of the cause of tides, however, his theory was a failure.\n\nIf this theory were correct, there would be only one high tide per day. Galileo and his contemporaries were aware of this inadequacy because there are two daily high tides at Venice instead of one, about twelve hours apart. Galileo dismissed this anomaly as the result of several secondary causes including the shape of the sea, its depth, and other factors. Against the assertion that Galileo was deceptive in making these arguments, Albert Einstein expressed the opinion that Galileo developed his \"fascinating arguments\" and accepted them uncritically out of a desire for physical proof of the motion of the Earth. Galileo dismissed the idea, held by his contemporary Johannes Kepler, that the moon caused the tides. (Galileo also took no interest in Kepler's elliptical orbits of the planets.)\n\nIn 1619, Galileo became embroiled in a controversy with Father Orazio Grassi, professor of mathematics at the Jesuit Collegio Romano. It began as a dispute over the nature of comets, but by the time Galileo had published \"The Assayer\" (\"Il Saggiatore\") in 1623, his last salvo in the dispute, it had become a much wider controversy over the very nature of science itself. The title page of the book describes Galileo as philosopher and \"Matematico Primario\" of the Grand Duke of Tuscany.\n\nBecause \"The Assayer\" contains such a wealth of Galileo's ideas on how science should be practised, it has been referred to as his scientific manifesto. Early in 1619, Father Grassi had anonymously published a pamphlet, \"An Astronomical Disputation on the Three Comets of the Year 1618\", which discussed the nature of a comet that had appeared late in November of the previous year. Grassi concluded that the comet was a fiery body which had moved along a segment of a great circle at a constant distance from the earth, and since it moved in the sky more slowly than the moon, it must be farther away than the moon.\n\nGrassi's arguments and conclusions were criticised in a subsequent article, \"Discourse on Comets\", published under the name of one of Galileo's disciples, a Florentine lawyer named Mario Guiducci, although it had been largely written by Galileo himself. Galileo and Guiducci offered no definitive theory of their own on the nature of comets although they did present some tentative conjectures that are now known to be mistaken. In its opening passage, Galileo and Guiducci's \"Discourse\" gratuitously insulted the Jesuit Christopher Scheiner, and various uncomplimentary remarks about the professors of the Collegio Romano were scattered throughout the work. The Jesuits were offended, and Grassi soon replied with a polemical tract of his own, \"The Astronomical and Philosophical Balance\", under the pseudonym Lothario Sarsio Sigensano, purporting to be one of his own pupils.\n\n\"The Assayer\" was Galileo's devastating reply to the \"Astronomical Balance\". It has been widely recognized as a masterpiece of polemical literature, in which \"Sarsi's\" arguments are subjected to withering scorn. It was greeted with wide acclaim, and particularly pleased the new pope, Urban VIII, to whom it had been dedicated. In Rome, in the previous decade, Barberini, the future Urban VIII, had come down on the side of Galileo and the Lincean Academy.\n\nGalileo's dispute with Grassi permanently alienated many of the Jesuits who had previously been sympathetic to his ideas, and Galileo and his friends were convinced that these Jesuits were responsible for bringing about his later condemnation. The evidence for this is at best equivocal, however.\n\nIn the whole world prior to Galileo's conflict with the Church, the majority of educated people subscribed either to the Aristotelian geocentric view that the earth was the center of the universe and that all heavenly bodies revolved around the Earth, or the Tychonic system that blended geocentrism with heliocentrism. Nevertheless, following the death of Copernicus and before Galileo, heliocentrism was relatively uncontroversial; Copernicus's work was used by Pope Gregory XIII to reform the calendar in 1582.\n\nOpposition to heliocentrism and Galileo's writings combined religious and scientific objections. Scientific opposition came from Tycho Brahe and others and arose from the fact that, if heliocentrism were true, an annual stellar parallax should be observed, though none was. Copernicus and Aristarchus had correctly postulated that parallax was negligible because the stars were so distant. However, Brahe had countered that, since stars appeared to have measurable size, if the stars were that distant, they would be gigantic, and in fact far larger than the Sun or any other celestial body. In Brahe's system, by contrast, the stars were a little more distant than Saturn, and the Sun and stars were comparable in size.\n\nReligious opposition to heliocentrism arose from Biblical references such as Psalm , , and 1 Chronicles which include text stating that \"the world is firmly established, it cannot be moved.\" In the same manner, says, \"the Lord set the earth on its foundations; it can never be moved.\" Further, Ecclesiastes states that \"And the sun rises and sets and returns to its place.\"\n\nGalileo defended heliocentrism based on his astronomical observations of 1609 (\"Sidereus Nuncius\" 1610). In December 1613, the Grand Duchess Christina of Florence confronted one of Galileo's friends and followers, Benedetto Castelli, with biblical objections to the motion of the earth. According to Maurice Finocchiaro, this was done in a friendly and gracious manner, out of curiosity. Prompted by this incident, Galileo wrote a letter to Castelli in which he argued that heliocentrism was actually not contrary to biblical texts, and that the bible was an authority on faith and morals, not on science. This letter was not published, but circulated widely.\n\nBy 1615, Galileo's writings on heliocentrism had been submitted to the Roman Inquisition by Father Niccolò Lorini, who claimed that Galileo and his followers were attempting to reinterpret the Bible, which was seen as a violation of the Council of Trent and looked dangerously like Protestantism. Lorini specifically cited Galileo's letter to Castelli. Galileo went to Rome to defend himself and his Copernican and biblical ideas. At the start of 1616, Monsignor Francesco Ingoli initiated a debate with Galileo, sending him an essay disputing the Copernican system. Galileo later stated that he believed this essay to have been instrumental in the action against Copernicanism that followed. According to Maurice Finocchiaro, Ingoli had probably been commissioned by the Inquisition to write an expert opinion on the controversy, and the essay provided the \"chief direct basis\" for the Inquisition's actions. The essay focused on eighteen physical and mathematical arguments against heliocentrism. It borrowed primarily from the arguments of Tycho Brahe, and it notedly mentioned Brahe's argument that heliocentrism required the stars to be much larger than the Sun. Ingoli wrote that the great distance to the stars in the heliocentric theory \"clearly proves ... the fixed stars to be of such size, as they may surpass or equal the size of the orbit circle of the Earth itself.\" The essay also included four theological arguments, but Ingoli suggested Galileo focus on the physical and mathematical arguments, and he did not mention Galileo's biblical ideas. In February 1616, an Inquisitorial commission declared heliocentrism to be \"foolish and absurd in philosophy, and formally heretical since it explicitly contradicts in many places the sense of Holy Scripture.\" The Inquisition found that the idea of the Earth's movement \"receives the same judgement in philosophy and... in regard to theological truth it is at least erroneous in faith\". (The original document from the Inquisitorial commission was made widely available in 2014.)\n\nPope Paul V instructed Cardinal Bellarmine to deliver this finding to Galileo, and to order him to abandon the opinion that heliocentrism was physically true. On 26 February, Galileo was called to Bellarmine's residence and ordered:\n\nThe decree of the Congregation of the Index banned Copernicus's \"De Revolutionibus\" and other heliocentric works until correction. Bellarmine's instructions did not prohibit Galileo from discussing heliocentrism as a mathematical and philosophic idea, so long as he did not advocate for its physical truth.\n\nFor the next decade, Galileo stayed well away from the controversy. He revived his project of writing a book on the subject, encouraged by the election of Cardinal Maffeo Barberini as Pope Urban VIII in 1623. Barberini was a friend and admirer of Galileo, and had opposed the condemnation of Galileo in 1616. Galileo's resulting book, \"Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems\", was published in 1632, with formal authorization from the Inquisition and papal permission.\n\nEarlier, Pope Urban VIII had personally asked Galileo to give arguments for and against heliocentrism in the book, and to be careful not to advocate heliocentrism. He made another request, that his own views on the matter be included in Galileo's book. Only the latter of those requests was fulfilled by Galileo.\n\nWhether unknowingly or deliberately, Simplicio, the defender of the Aristotelian geocentric view in \"Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems\", was often caught in his own errors and sometimes came across as a fool. Indeed, although Galileo states in the preface of his book that the character is named after a famous Aristotelian philosopher (Simplicius in Latin, \"Simplicio\" in Italian), the name \"Simplicio\" in Italian also has the connotation of \"simpleton\". This portrayal of Simplicio made \"Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems\" appear as an advocacy book: an attack on Aristotelian geocentrism and defence of the Copernican theory. Unfortunately for his relationship with the Pope, Galileo put the words of Urban VIII into the mouth of Simplicio.\n\nMost historians agree Galileo did not act out of malice and felt blindsided by the reaction to his book. However, the Pope did not take the suspected public ridicule lightly, nor the Copernican advocacy.\n\nGalileo had alienated one of his biggest and most powerful supporters, the Pope, and was called to Rome to defend his writings in September 1632. He finally arrived in February 1633 and was brought before inquisitor Vincenzo Maculani to be charged. Throughout his trial, Galileo steadfastly maintained that since 1616 he had faithfully kept his promise not to hold any of the condemned opinions, and initially he denied even defending them. However, he was eventually persuaded to admit that, contrary to his true intention, a reader of his \"Dialogue\" could well have obtained the impression that it was intended to be a defence of Copernicanism. In view of Galileo's rather implausible denial that he had ever held Copernican ideas after 1616 or ever intended to defend them in the \"Dialogue\", his final interrogation, in July 1633, concluded with his being threatened with torture if he did not tell the truth, but he maintained his denial despite the threat.\n\nThe sentence of the Inquisition was delivered on 22 June. It was in three essential parts:\n\nAccording to popular legend, after recanting his theory that the Earth moved around the Sun, Galileo allegedly muttered the rebellious phrase \"And yet it moves\". A 1640s painting by the Spanish painter Bartolomé Esteban Murillo or an artist of his school, in which the words were hidden until restoration work in 1911, depicts an imprisoned Galileo apparently gazing at the words \"E pur si muove\" written on the wall of his dungeon. The earliest known written account of the legend dates to a century after his death, but Stillman Drake writes \"there is no doubt now that the famous words were already attributed to Galileo before his death\".\n\nAfter a period with the friendly Ascanio Piccolomini (the Archbishop of Siena), Galileo was allowed to return to his villa at Arcetri near Florence in 1634, where he spent part of his life under house arrest. Galileo was ordered to read the seven penitential psalms once a week for the next three years. However, his daughter Maria Celeste relieved him of the burden after securing ecclesiastical permission to take it upon herself.\n\nIt was while Galileo was under house arrest that he dedicated his time to one of his finest works, \"Two New Sciences\". Here he summarised work he had done some forty years earlier, on the two sciences now called kinematics and strength of materials, published in Holland to avoid the censor. This book has received high praise from Albert Einstein. As a result of this work, Galileo is often called the \"father of modern physics\". He went completely blind in 1638 and was suffering from a painful hernia and insomnia, so he was permitted to travel to Florence for medical advice.\n\nDava Sobel argues that prior to Galileo's 1633 trial and judgement for heresy, Pope Urban VIII had become preoccupied with court intrigue and problems of state, and began to fear persecution or threats to his own life. In this context, Sobel argues that the problem of Galileo was presented to the pope by court insiders and enemies of Galileo. Having been accused of weakness in defending the church, Urban reacted against Galileo out of anger and fear.\n\nGalileo continued to receive visitors until 1642, when, after suffering fever and heart palpitations, he died on 8 January 1642, aged 77. The Grand Duke of Tuscany, Ferdinando II, wished to bury him in the main body of the Basilica of Santa Croce, next to the tombs of his father and other ancestors, and to erect a marble mausoleum in his honour.\n\nThese plans were dropped, however, after Pope Urban VIII and his nephew, Cardinal Francesco Barberini, protested, because Galileo had been condemned by the Catholic Church for \"vehement suspicion of heresy\". He was instead buried in a small room next to the novices' chapel at the end of a corridor from the southern transept of the basilica to the sacristy. He was reburied in the main body of the basilica in 1737 after a monument had been erected there in his honour; during this move, three fingers and a tooth were removed from his remains. One of these fingers, the middle finger from Galileo's right hand, is currently on exhibition at the Museo Galileo in Florence, Italy.\n\nGalileo made original contributions to the science of motion through an innovative combination of experiment and mathematics. More typical of science at the time were the qualitative studies of William Gilbert, on magnetism and electricity. Galileo's father, Vincenzo Galilei, a lutenist and music theorist, had performed experiments establishing perhaps the oldest known non-linear relation in physics: for a stretched string, the pitch varies as the square root of the tension. These observations lay within the framework of the Pythagorean tradition of music, well-known to instrument makers, which included the fact that subdividing a string by a whole number produces a harmonious scale. Thus, a limited amount of mathematics had long related music and physical science, and young Galileo could see his own father's observations expand on that tradition.\n\nGalileo was one of the first modern thinkers to clearly state that the laws of nature are mathematical. In \"The Assayer\", he wrote \"Philosophy is written in this grand book, the universe ... It is written in the language of mathematics, and its characters are triangles, circles, and other geometric figures;...\" His mathematical analyses are a further development of a tradition employed by late scholastic natural philosophers, which Galileo learned when he studied philosophy. His work marked another step towards the eventual separation of science from both philosophy and religion; a major development in human thought. He was often willing to change his views in accordance with observation. In order to perform his experiments, Galileo had to set up standards of length and time, so that measurements made on different days and in different laboratories could be compared in a reproducible fashion. This provided a reliable foundation on which to confirm mathematical laws using inductive reasoning.\n\nGalileo showed a modern appreciation for the proper relationship between mathematics, theoretical physics, and experimental physics. He understood the parabola, both in terms of conic sections and in terms of the ordinate (y) varying as the square of the abscissa (x). Galilei further asserted that the parabola was the theoretically ideal trajectory of a uniformly accelerated projectile in the absence of air resistance or other disturbances. He conceded that there are limits to the validity of this theory, noting on theoretical grounds that a projectile trajectory of a size comparable to that of the Earth could not possibly be a parabola, but he nevertheless maintained that for distances up to the range of the artillery of his day, the deviation of a projectile's trajectory from a parabola would be only very slight.\n\nBased only on uncertain descriptions of the first practical telescope which Hans Lippershey tried to patent in the Netherlands in 1608, Galileo, in the following year, made a telescope with about 3x magnification. He later made improved versions with up to about 30x magnification. With a Galilean telescope, the observer could see magnified, upright images on the earth—it was what is commonly known as a terrestrial telescope or a spyglass. He could also use it to observe the sky; for a time he was one of those who could construct telescopes good enough for that purpose. On 25 August 1609, he demonstrated one of his early telescopes, with a magnification of about 8 or 9, to Venetian lawmakers. His telescopes were also a profitable sideline for Galileo, who sold them to merchants who found them useful both at sea and as items of trade. He published his initial telescopic astronomical observations in March 1610 in a brief treatise entitled \"Sidereus Nuncius\" (\"Starry Messenger\").\n\nTycho and others had observed the supernova of 1572. Ottavio Brenzoni's letter of 15 January 1605 to Galileo brought the 1572 supernova and the less bright nova of 1601 to Galileo's notice. Galileo observed and discussed Kepler's supernova in 1604. Since these new stars displayed no detectable diurnal parallax, Galileo concluded that they were distant stars, and, therefore, disproved the Aristotelian belief in the immutability of the heavens.\n\nOn 7 January 1610, Galileo observed with his telescope what he described at the time as \"three fixed stars, totally invisible by their smallness\", all close to Jupiter, and lying on a straight line through it. Observations on subsequent nights showed that the positions of these \"stars\" relative to Jupiter were changing in a way that would have been inexplicable if they had really been fixed stars. On 10 January, Galileo noted that one of them had disappeared, an observation which he attributed to its being hidden behind Jupiter. Within a few days, he concluded that they were orbiting Jupiter: he had discovered three of Jupiter's four largest moons. He discovered the fourth on 13 January. Galileo named the group of four the \"Medicean stars\", in honour of his future patron, Cosimo II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, and Cosimo's three brothers. Later astronomers, however, renamed them \"Galilean satellites\" in honour of their discoverer. These satellites were independently discovered by Simon Marius on 8 January 1610 and are now called Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto the names given by Marius in his \"Mundus Iovialis\" published in 1614.\n\nHis observations of the satellites of Jupiter caused a revolution in astronomy: a planet with smaller planets orbiting it did not conform to the principles of Aristotelian cosmology, which held that all heavenly bodies should circle the Earth, and many astronomers and philosophers initially refused to believe that Galileo could have discovered such a thing. His observations were confirmed by the observatory of Christopher Clavius and he received a hero's welcome when he visited Rome in 1611. Galileo continued to observe the satellites over the next eighteen months, and by mid-1611, he had obtained remarkably accurate estimates for their periods—a feat which Kepler had believed impossible.\n\nFrom September 1610, Galileo observed that Venus exhibited a full set of phases similar to that of the Moon. The heliocentric model of the solar system developed by Nicolaus Copernicus predicted that all phases would be visible since the orbit of Venus around the Sun would cause its illuminated hemisphere to face the Earth when it was on the opposite side of the Sun and to face away from the Earth when it was on the Earth-side of the Sun. On the other hand, in Ptolemy's geocentric model it was impossible for any of the planets' orbits to intersect the spherical shell carrying the Sun. Traditionally, the orbit of Venus was placed entirely on the near side of the Sun, where it could exhibit only crescent and new phases. It was, however, also possible to place it entirely on the far side of the Sun, where it could exhibit only gibbous and full phases. After Galileo's telescopic observations of the crescent, gibbous and full phases of Venus, the Ptolemaic model became untenable. Thus in the early 17th century, as a result of his discovery, the great majority of astronomers converted to one of the various geo-heliocentric planetary models, such as the Tychonic, Capellan and Extended Capellan models, each either with or without a daily rotating Earth. These all had the virtue of explaining the phases of Venus without the vice of the 'refutation' of full heliocentrism's prediction of stellar parallax. Galileo's discovery of the phases of Venus was thus arguably his most empirically practically influential contribution to the two-stage transition from full geocentrism to full heliocentrism via geo-heliocentrism.\n\nGalileo observed the planet Saturn, and at first mistook its rings for planets, thinking it was a three-bodied system. When he observed the planet later, Saturn's rings were directly oriented at Earth, causing him to think that two of the bodies had disappeared. The rings reappeared when he observed the planet in 1616, further confusing him.\n\nGalileo also observed the planet Neptune in 1612. It appears in his notebooks as one of many unremarkable dim stars. He did not realise that it was a planet, but he did note its motion relative to the stars before losing track of it.\n\nGalileo made naked-eye and telescopic studies of sunspots. Their existence raised another difficulty with the unchanging perfection of the heavens as posited in orthodox Aristotelian celestial physics. An apparent annual variation in their trajectories, observed by Francesco Sizzi and others in 1612–1613, also provided a powerful argument against both the Ptolemaic system and the geoheliocentric system of Tycho Brahe. A dispute over claimed priority in the discovery of sunspots, and in their interpretation, led Galileo to a long and bitter feud with the Jesuit Christoph Scheiner. In the middle was Mark Welser, to whom Scheiner had announced his discovery, and who asked Galileo for his opinion. In fact, there is little doubt that both of them were beaten by David Fabricius and his son Johannes.\n\nPrior to Galileo's construction of his version of a telescope, Thomas Harriot, an English mathematician and explorer, had already used what he dubbed a \"perspective tube\" to observe the moon. Reporting his observations, Harriot noted only \"strange spottednesse\" in the waning of the crescent, but was ignorant to the cause. Galileo, due in part to his artistic training and the knowledge of chiaroscuro, had understood the patterns of light and shadow were, in fact, topographical markers. While not being the only one to observe the moon through a telescope, Galileo was the first to deduce the cause of the uneven waning as light occlusion from lunar mountains and craters. In his study, he also made topographical charts, estimating the heights of the mountains. The moon was not what was long thought to have been a translucent and perfect sphere, as Aristotle claimed, and hardly the first \"planet\", an \"eternal pearl to magnificently ascend into the heavenly empyrian\", as put forth by Dante. Galileo is sometimes credited with the discovery of the lunar libration in latitude in 1632, although Thomas Harriot or William Gilbert might have done it before.\n\nGalileo observed the Milky Way, previously believed to be nebulous, and found it to be a multitude of stars packed so densely that they appeared from Earth to be clouds. He located many other stars too distant to be visible with the naked eye. He observed the double star Mizar in Ursa Major in 1617.\n\nIn the \"Starry Messenger\", Galileo reported that stars appeared as mere blazes of light, essentially unaltered in appearance by the telescope, and contrasted them to planets, which the telescope revealed to be discs. But shortly thereafter, in his \"Letters on Sunspots\", he reported that the telescope revealed the shapes of both stars and planets to be \"quite round\". From that point forward, he continued to report that telescopes showed the roundness of stars, and that stars seen through the telescope measured a few seconds of arc in diameter. He also devised a method for measuring the apparent size of a star without a telescope. As described in his \"Dialogue Concerning the two Chief World Systems\", his method was to hang a thin rope in his line of sight to the star and measure the maximum distance from which it would wholly obscure the star. From his measurements of this distance and of the width of the rope, he could calculate the angle subtended by the star at his viewing point. In his \"Dialogue\", he reported that he had found the apparent diameter of a star of first magnitude to be no more than 5 arcseconds, and that of one of sixth magnitude to be about / arcseconds. Like most astronomers of his day, Galileo did not recognise that the apparent sizes of stars that he measured were spurious, caused by diffraction and atmospheric distortion (see seeing disk or Airy disk), and did not represent the true sizes of stars. However, Galileo's values were much smaller than previous estimates of the apparent sizes of the brightest stars, such as those made by Tycho Brahe (see Magnitude) and enabled Galileo to counter anti-Copernican arguments such as those made by Tycho that these stars would have to be absurdly large for their annual parallaxes to be undetectable. Other astronomers such as Simon Marius, Giovanni Battista Riccioli, and Martinus Hortensius made similar measurements of stars, and Marius and Riccioli concluded the smaller sizes were not small enough to answer Tycho's argument.\n\nGalileo made a number of contributions to what is now known as engineering, as distinct from pure physics. Between 1595 and 1598, Galileo devised and improved a geometric and military compass suitable for use by gunners and surveyors. This expanded on earlier instruments designed by Niccolò Tartaglia and Guidobaldo del Monte. For gunners, it offered, in addition to a new and safer way of elevating cannons accurately, a way of quickly computing the charge of gunpowder for cannonballs of different sizes and materials. As a geometric instrument, it enabled the construction of any regular polygon, computation of the area of any polygon or circular sector, and a variety of other calculations. Under Galileo's direction, instrument maker Marc'Antonio Mazzoleni produced more than 100 of these compasses, which Galileo sold (along with an instruction manual he wrote) for 50 lire and offered a course of instruction in the use of the compasses for 120 lire.\n\nIn about 1593, Galileo constructed a thermometer, using the expansion and contraction of air in a bulb to move water in an attached tube.\n\nIn 1609, Galileo was, along with Englishman Thomas Harriot and others, among the first to use a refracting telescope as an instrument to observe stars, planets or moons. The name \"telescope\" was coined for Galileo's instrument by a Greek mathematician, Giovanni Demisiani, at a banquet held in 1611 by Prince Federico Cesi to make Galileo a member of his Accademia dei Lincei. The name was derived from the Greek \"tele\" = 'far' and \"skopein\" = 'to look or see'. In 1610, he used a telescope at close range to magnify the parts of insects. By 1624, Galileo had used a compound microscope. He gave one of these instruments to Cardinal Zollern in May of that year for presentation to the Duke of Bavaria, and in September, he sent another to Prince Cesi. The Linceans played a role again in naming the \"microscope\" a year later when fellow academy member Giovanni Faber coined the word for Galileo's invention from the Greek words \"μικρόν\" (\"micron\") meaning \"small\", and \"σκοπεῖν\" (\"skopein\") meaning \"to look at\". The word was meant to be analogous with \"telescope\". Illustrations of insects made using one of Galileo's microscopes and published in 1625, appear to have been the first clear documentation of the use of a compound microscope.\n\nIn 1612, having determined the orbital periods of Jupiter's satellites, Galileo proposed that with sufficiently accurate knowledge of their orbits, one could use their positions as a universal clock, and this would make possible the determination of longitude. He worked on this problem from time to time during the remainder of his life, but the practical problems were severe. The method was first successfully applied by Giovanni Domenico Cassini in 1681 and was later used extensively for large land surveys; this method, for example, was used to survey France, and later by Zebulon Pike of the midwestern United States in 1806. For sea navigation, where delicate telescopic observations were more difficult, the longitude problem eventually required development of a practical portable marine chronometer, such as that of John Harrison. Late in his life, when totally blind, Galileo designed an escapement mechanism for a pendulum clock (called Galileo's escapement), although no clock using this was built until after the first fully operational pendulum clock was made by Christiaan Huygens in the 1650s.\n\nGalileo was invited on several occasions to advise on engineering schemes to alleviate river flooding. In 1630 Mario Guiducci was probably instrumental in ensuring that he was consulted on a scheme by Bartolotti to cut a new channel for the Bisenzio River near Florence.\n\nGalileo's theoretical and experimental work on the motions of bodies, along with the largely independent work of Kepler and René Descartes, was a precursor of the classical mechanics developed by Sir Isaac Newton. Galileo conducted several experiments with pendulums. It is popularly believed (thanks to the biography by Vincenzo Viviani) that these began by watching the swings of the bronze chandelier in the cathedral of Pisa, using his pulse as a timer. Later experiments are described in his \"Two New Sciences\". Galileo claimed that a simple pendulum is isochronous, i.e. that its swings always take the same amount of time, independently of the amplitude. In fact, this is only approximately true, as was discovered by Christiaan Huygens. Galileo also found that the square of the period varies directly with the length of the pendulum. Galileo's son, Vincenzo, sketched a clock based on his father's theories in 1642. The clock was never built and, because of the large swings required by its verge escapement, would have been a poor timekeeper. (See Engineering above.)\n\nGalileo is lesser known for, yet still credited with, being one of the first to understand sound frequency. By scraping a chisel at different speeds, he linked the pitch of the sound produced to the spacing of the chisel's skips, a measure of frequency. In 1638, Galileo described an experimental method to measure the speed of light by arranging that two observers, each having lanterns equipped with shutters, observe each other's lanterns at some distance. The first observer opens the shutter of his lamp, and, the second, upon seeing the light, immediately opens the shutter of his own lantern. The time between the first observer's opening his shutter and seeing the light from the second observer's lamp indicates the time it takes light to travel back and forth between the two observers. Galileo reported that when he tried this at a distance of less than a mile, he was unable to determine whether or not the light appeared instantaneously. Sometime between Galileo's death and 1667, the members of the Florentine \"Accademia del Cimento\" repeated the experiment over a distance of about a mile and obtained a similarly inconclusive result. We now know that the speed of light is far too fast to be measured by such methods (with human shutter-openers on Earth).\n\nGalileo put forward the basic principle of relativity, that the laws of physics are the same in any system that is moving at a constant speed in a straight line, regardless of its particular speed or direction. Hence, there is no absolute motion or absolute rest. This principle provided the basic framework for Newton's laws of motion and is central to Einstein's special theory of relativity.\n\nA biography by Galileo's pupil Vincenzo Viviani stated that Galileo had dropped balls of the same material, but different masses, from the Leaning Tower of Pisa to demonstrate that their time of descent was independent of their mass. This was contrary to what Aristotle had taught: that heavy objects fall faster than lighter ones, in direct proportion to weight. While this story has been retold in popular accounts, there is no account by Galileo himself of such an experiment, and it is generally accepted by historians that it was at most a thought experiment which did not actually take place. An exception is Drake, who argues that the experiment did take place, more or less as Viviani described it. The experiment described was actually performed by Simon Stevin (commonly known as Stevinus) and Jan Cornets de Groot, although the building used was actually the church tower in Delft in 1586. However, most of his experiments with falling bodies were carried out using inclined planes where both the issues of timing and air resistance were much reduced.\n\nIn his 1638 \"Discorsi\", Galileo's character Salviati, widely regarded as Galileo's spokesman, held that all unequal weights would fall with the same finite speed in a vacuum. But this had previously been proposed by Lucretius and Simon Stevin. Cristiano Banti's Salviati also held it could be experimentally demonstrated by the comparison of pendulum motions in air with bobs of lead and of cork which had different weight but which were otherwise similar.\n\nGalileo proposed that a falling body would fall with a uniform acceleration, as long as the resistance of the medium through which it was falling remained negligible, or in the limiting case of its falling through a vacuum. He also derived the correct kinematical law for the distance travelled during a uniform acceleration starting from rest—namely, that it is proportional to the square of the elapsed time ( \"d\" ∝ \"t\" ). Prior to Galileo, Nicole Oresme, in the 14th century, had derived the times-squared law for uniformly accelerated change, and Domingo de Soto had suggested in the 16th century that bodies falling through a homogeneous medium would be uniformly accelerated. Galileo expressed the time-squared law using geometrical constructions and mathematically precise words, adhering to the standards of the day. (It remained for others to re-express the law in algebraic terms).\n\nHe also concluded that objects \"retain their velocity\" in the absence of any impediments to their motion, thereby contradicting the generally accepted Aristotelian hypothesis that a body could only remain in so-called \"violent\", \"unnatural\", or \"forced\" motion so long as an agent of change (the \"mover\") continued to act on it. Philosophical ideas relating to inertia had been proposed by John Philoponus and Jean Buridan. Galileo stated: \"Imagine any particle projected along a horizontal plane without friction; then we know, from what has been more fully explained in the preceding pages, that this particle will move along this same plane with a motion which is uniform and perpetual, provided the plane has no limits\" This was incorporated into Newton's laws of motion (first law).\n\nWhile Galileo's application of mathematics to experimental physics was innovative, his mathematical methods were the standard ones of the day, including dozens of examples of an inverse proportion square root method passed down from Fibonacci and Archimedes. The analysis and proofs relied heavily on the Eudoxian theory of proportion, as set forth in the fifth book of Euclid's Elements. This theory had become available only a century before, thanks to accurate translations by Tartaglia and others; but by the end of Galileo's life, it was being superseded by the algebraic methods of Descartes.\n\nThe concept now named Galileo's paradox was not original with him. His proposed solution, that infinite numbers cannot be compared, is no longer considered useful.\n\n\nThe Galileo affair was largely forgotten after Galileo's death, and the controversy subsided. The Inquisition's ban on reprinting Galileo's works was lifted in 1718 when permission was granted to publish an edition of his works (excluding the condemned \"Dialogue\") in Florence. In 1741, Pope Benedict XIV authorised the publication of an edition of Galileo's complete scientific works which included a mildly censored version of the \"Dialogue\". In 1758, the general prohibition against works advocating heliocentrism was removed from the Index of prohibited books, although the specific ban on uncensored versions of the \"Dialogue\" and Copernicus's \"De Revolutionibus\" remained. All traces of official opposition to heliocentrism by the church disappeared in 1835 when these works were finally dropped from the Index.\n\nInterest in the Galileo affair was revived in the early 19th century, when Protestant polemicists used it (and other events such as the Spanish Inquisition and the myth of the flat Earth) to attack Roman Catholicism. Interest in it has waxed and waned ever since. In 1939, Pope Pius XII, in his first speech to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, within a few months of his election to the papacy, described Galileo as being among the \"most audacious heroes of research... not afraid of the stumbling blocks and the risks on the way, nor fearful of the funereal monuments\". His close advisor of 40 years, Professor Robert Leiber, wrote: \"Pius XII was very careful not to close any doors (to science) prematurely. He was energetic on this point and regretted that in the case of Galileo.\"\n\nOn 15 February 1990, in a speech delivered at the Sapienza University of Rome, Cardinal Ratzinger (later Pope Benedict XVI) cited some current views on the Galileo affair as forming what he called \"a symptomatic case that permits us to see how deep the self-doubt of the modern age, of science and technology goes today\". Some of the views he cited were those of the philosopher Paul Feyerabend, whom he quoted as saying \"The Church at the time of Galileo kept much more closely to reason than did Galileo himself, and she took into consideration the ethical and social consequences of Galileo's teaching too. Her verdict against Galileo was rational and just and the revision of this verdict can be justified only on the grounds of what is politically opportune.\" The Cardinal did not clearly indicate whether he agreed or disagreed with Feyerabend's assertions. He did, however, say \"It would be foolish to construct an impulsive apologetic on the basis of such views.\"\n\nOn 31 October 1992, Pope John Paul II expressed regret for how the Galileo affair was handled, and issued a declaration acknowledging the errors committed by the Catholic Church tribunal that judged the scientific positions of Galileo Galilei, as the result of a study conducted by the Pontifical Council for Culture. In March 2008, the head of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, Nicola Cabibbo, announced a plan to honour Galileo by erecting a statue of him inside the Vatican walls. In December of the same year, during events to mark the 400th anniversary of Galileo's earliest telescopic observations, Pope Benedict XVI praised his contributions to astronomy. A month later, however, the head of the Pontifical Council for Culture, Gianfranco Ravasi, revealed that the plan to erect a statue of Galileo in the grounds of the Vatican had been suspended.\n\nAccording to Stephen Hawking, Galileo probably bears more of the responsibility for the birth of modern science than anybody else, and Albert Einstein called him the father of modern science.\n\nGalileo's astronomical discoveries and investigations into the Copernican theory have led to a lasting legacy which includes the categorisation of the four large moons of Jupiter discovered by Galileo (Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto) as the Galilean moons. Other scientific endeavours and principles are named after Galileo including the Galileo spacecraft, the first spacecraft to enter orbit around Jupiter, the proposed Galileo global satellite navigation system, the transformation between inertial systems in classical mechanics denoted Galilean transformation and the Gal (unit), sometimes known as the \"Galileo,\" which is a non-SI unit of acceleration.\n\nPartly because 2009 was the fourth centenary of Galileo's first recorded astronomical observations with the telescope, the United Nations scheduled it to be the International Year of Astronomy. A global scheme was laid out by the International Astronomical Union (IAU), also endorsed by UNESCO—the UN body responsible for educational, scientific and cultural matters. The International Year of Astronomy 2009 was intended to be a global celebration of astronomy and its contributions to society and culture, stimulating worldwide interest not only in astronomy but science in general, with a particular slant towards young people.\n\nAsteroid 697 Galilea is named in his honour.\n\nGalileo is mentioned several times in the \"opera\" section of the Queen song, \"Bohemian Rhapsody\". He features prominently in the song \"Galileo\" performed by the Indigo Girls and Amy Grant's \"Galileo\" on her \"Heart in Motion\" album.\n\nTwentieth-century plays have been written on Galileo's life, including \"Life of Galileo\" (1943) by the German playwright Bertolt Brecht, with a film adaptation (1975) of it, and \"Lamp At Midnight\" (1947) by Barrie Stavis, as well as the 2008 play \"Galileo Galilei\".\n\nKim Stanley Robinson wrote a science fiction novel entitled \"Galileo's Dream\" (2009), in which Galileo is brought into the future to help resolve a crisis of scientific philosophy; the story moves back and forth between Galileo's own time and a hypothetical distant future and contains a great deal of biographical information.\n\nGalileo Galilei was recently selected as a main motif for a high value collectors' coin: the €25 International Year of Astronomy commemorative coin, minted in 2009. This coin also commemorates the 400th anniversary of the invention of Galileo's telescope. The obverse shows a portion of his portrait and his telescope. The background shows one of his first drawings of the surface of the moon. In the silver ring, other telescopes are depicted: the Isaac Newton Telescope, the observatory in Kremsmünster Abbey, a modern telescope, a radio telescope and a space telescope. In 2009, the Galileoscope was also released. This is a mass-produced, low-cost educational telescope with relatively high quality.\n\nGalileo's early works describing scientific instruments include the 1586 tract entitled \"The Little Balance\" (\"La Billancetta\") describing an accurate balance to weigh objects in air or water and the 1606 printed manual \"Le Operazioni del Compasso Geometrico et Militare\" on the operation of a geometrical and military compass.\n\nHis early works in dynamics, the science of motion and mechanics were his \"circa\" 1590 Pisan \"De Motu\" (On Motion) and his \"circa\" 1600 Paduan \"Le Meccaniche\" (Mechanics). The former was based on Aristotelian–Archimedean fluid dynamics and held that the speed of gravitational fall in a fluid medium was proportional to the excess of a body's specific weight over that of the medium, whereby in a vacuum, bodies would fall with speeds in proportion to their specific weights. It also subscribed to the Philoponan impetus dynamics in which impetus is self-dissipating and free-fall in a vacuum would have an essential terminal speed according to specific weight after an initial period of acceleration.\n\nGalileo's 1610 \"The Starry Messenger\" (\"Sidereus Nuncius\") was the first scientific treatise to be published based on observations made through a telescope. It reported his discoveries of:\n\n\nGalileo published a description of sunspots in 1613 entitled \"Letters on Sunspots\" suggesting the Sun and heavens are corruptible. The \"Letters on Sunspots\" also reported his 1610 telescopic observations of the full set of phases of Venus, and his discovery of the puzzling \"appendages\" of Saturn and their even more puzzling subsequent disappearance. In 1615, Galileo prepared a manuscript known as the \"Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina\" which was not published in printed form until 1636. This letter was a revised version of the \"Letter to Castelli\", which was denounced by the Inquisition as an incursion upon theology by advocating Copernicanism both as physically true and as consistent with Scripture. In 1616, after the order by the inquisition for Galileo not to hold or defend the Copernican position, Galileo wrote the \"Discourse on the Tides\" (\"Discorso sul flusso e il reflusso del mare\") based on the Copernican earth, in the form of a private letter to Cardinal Orsini. In 1619, Mario Guiducci, a pupil of Galileo's, published a lecture written largely by Galileo under the title \"Discourse on the Comets\" (\"Discorso Delle Comete\"), arguing against the Jesuit interpretation of comets.\n\nIn 1623, Galileo published \"The Assayer—Il Saggiatore\", which attacked theories based on Aristotle's authority and promoted experimentation and the mathematical formulation of scientific ideas. The book was highly successful and even found support among the higher echelons of the Christian church. Following the success of \"The Assayer\", Galileo published the \"Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems\" (Dialogo sopra i due massimi sistemi del mondo) in 1632. Despite taking care to adhere to the Inquisition's 1616 instructions, the claims in the book favouring Copernican theory and a non Geocentric model of the solar system led to Galileo being tried and banned on publication. Despite the publication ban, Galileo published his \"Discourses and Mathematical Demonstrations Relating to Two New Sciences\" (\"Discorsi e Dimostrazioni Matematiche, intorno a due nuove scienze\") in 1638 in Holland, outside the jurisdiction of the Inquisition.\n\nGalileo's main written works are as follows:\n\n\nFootnotes\nCitations\n\n\n\nBiography\n\nGalileo and the Church\n"}
{"id": "213978", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=213978", "title": "George Henry Lewes", "text": "George Henry Lewes\n\nGeorge Henry Lewes (; 18 April 1817 – 30 November 1878) was an English philosopher and critic of literature and theatre. He was also an amateur physiologist. American feminist Margaret Fuller is known to have called Lewes a \"witty, French, flippant sort of man\". He became part of the mid-Victorian ferment of ideas which encouraged discussion of Darwinism, positivism, and religious skepticism. However, he is perhaps best known today for having openly lived with Mary Ann Evans, who wrote under the pen name George Eliot, as soulmates whose lives and writings were enriched by their relationship, though they never married each other.\n\nLewes, born in London, was the illegitimate son of the minor poet John Lee Lewes and Elizabeth Ashweek, and the grandson of comic actor Charles Lee Lewes. His mother married a retired sea captain when he was six. Frequent changes of home meant he was educated in London, Jersey, Brittany, and finally at Dr Charles Burney's school in Greenwich. Having abandoned successively a commercial and a medical career, he seriously thought of becoming an actor and appeared several times on stage between 1841 and 1850. Finally he devoted himself to literature, science and philosophy.\n\nAs early as 1836, he belonged to a club formed for the study of philosophy, and had sketched out a physiological treatment of the philosophy of the Scottish school. Two years later he went to Germany, probably with the intention of studying philosophy.\n\nLewes undertook studies on nutrition and physiology; he explored the question whether sugar was injurious to teeth. He conducted experiments on the reflexes and the nervous system of living animals, especially frogs, using ether and chloroform out of consideration for their pain .\n\nHe became friends with James Henry Leigh Hunt, and through him he entered London literary society and met John Stuart Mill, Thomas Carlyle and Charles Dickens.\n\nIn 1841, he married Agnes Jervis, daughter of Swynfen Stevens Jervis.\n\nLewes met writer Mary Ann Evans, later to be famous as George Eliot, in 1851, and by 1854 they had decided to live together. Lewes and Agnes Jervis had agreed to have an open marriage, and in addition to the three children they had together, Agnes also had four children by Thornton Hunt, the son of Leigh Hunt. Since Lewes was named on the birth certificate as the father of one of these children despite knowing this to be false, he was considered complicit in adultery and was not able to divorce Agnes. In July 1854, Lewes and Evans travelled to Weimar and Berlin together for research related to Lewes's study of Goethe. The trip to Germany also served as a honeymoon as Evans and Lewes now considered themselves married, with Evans calling herself Marian Evans Lewes, and referring to Lewes as her husband.\n\nOf his three sons only one, Charles Lewes, survived him; he became a London County Councillor.\n\nDuring the next ten years Lewes supported himself by contributing to quarterly and other reviews, articles discussing a wide range of subjects, often imperfect but revealing acute critical judgment enlightened by philosophic study. The most valuable are those on drama, afterwards republished under the title \"Actors and Acting\" (1875), and \"The Spanish Drama\" (1846). As a youngster, he witnessed a performance by Edmund Kean which stayed with him as an unforgettable experience. He also witnessed and wrote of his impressions of performances by William Charles Macready and other famous stars of the 19th century London stage. He is considered to be the first practitioner of modern theatre criticism and the realistic approach to acting.\n\nIn 1845–46, Lewes published \"The Biographical History of Philosophy\", an attempt to depict the life of philosophers as an ever-renewed fruitless labour to attain the unattainable. In 1847–48, he published two novels – \"Ranthorpe\", and \"Rose, Blanche and Violet\" – which, though displaying considerable skill in plot, construction, and characterisation, have taken no permanent place in literature. The same is to be said of an ingenious attempt to rehabilitate \"Robespierre\" (1849). In 1850 he collaborated with Thornton Leigh Hunt in the foundation of the \"Leader\", of which he was the literary editor. In 1853 he republished under the title of \"Comte's Philosophy of the Sciences\" a series of papers which had appeared in that journal.\n\nThe culmination of Lewes's work in prose literature is the \"Life of Goethe\" (1855), probably the best known of his writings. Lewes's versatility, and his combination of scientific with literary tastes, eminently fitted him to appreciate the wide-ranging activity of the German poet. The work became well known in Germany itself, despite the boldness of its criticism and the unpopularity of some of its views (e.g. on the relation of the second to the first part of \"Faust\").\n\nFrom about 1853 Lewes's writings show that he was occupying himself with scientific and more particularly biological work. He always showed a distinctly scientific bent in his writings, though he had not had technical training. More than popular expositions of accepted scientific truths, they contain able criticisms of conventionally accepted ideas and embody the results of individual research and individual reflection. He made several suggestions, some of which have since been accepted by physiologists, of which the most valuable is that now known as the doctrine of the functional indifference of the nerves – that what were known as the specific energies of the optic, auditory and other nerves are simply differences in their mode of action due to the differences of the peripheral structures or sense-organs with which they are connected. This idea was subsequently proposed independently by Wundt.\n\nIn 1865, when \"Fortnightly Review\" began publication, Lewes became its editor, but he retained the post for less than two years, when he was succeeded by John Morley.\n\nThis marks the transition from more strictly scientific to philosophic work. Lewes had been interested in philosophy from early youth; one of his earliest essays was an appreciative account of Hegel's \"Aesthetics\". Under the influence of the positivism of Auguste Comte and John Stuart Mill's \"A System of Logic\", he abandoned all faith in the possibility of metaphysics, and recorded this abandonment in his \"History of Philosophy\". Yet he did not at any time give unqualified assent to Comte's teachings, and with wider reading and reflection his mind moved further away from the positivist stance. In the preface to the third edition of his \"History of Philosophy\" he avowed a change in this direction, and this movement is even more plainly discernible in subsequent editions of the work.\n\nThe final outcome of his intellectual progress is \"The Problems of Life and Mind\". His sudden death cut short the work, yet it is complete enough to allow a judgment on the author's matured conceptions on biological, psychological and metaphysical problems.\n\nThe first two volumes on \"The Foundations of a Creed\" laid down Lewes' foundation – a \"rapprochement\" between metaphysics and science. He was still positivist enough to pronounce all inquiry into the ultimate nature of things fruitless: what matter, form, and spirit are in themselves is a futile question that belongs to the sterile region of \"metempirics\". But philosophical questions may be susceptible to a precise solution through scientific method. Thus, since the relation of subject to object falls within our experience, it is a proper matter for philosophic investigation.\n\nHis treatment of the question of the relation of subject to object confused the scientific truth that mind and body coexist in the living organism and the philosophic truth that all knowledge of objects implies a knowing subject. In Shadworth Hodgson's phrase, he mixed up the genesis of mental forms with their nature (see \"Philosophy of Reflexion\", ii. 40–58). Thus he reached a monistic doctrine that mind and matter are two aspects of the same existence by attending simply to the parallelism between psychical and physical processes as a given fact (or probable fact) of our experience, leaving out of account their relation as subject and object in the cognitive act.\n\nHis identification of the two as phases of one existence is open to criticism not only from the point of view of philosophy but from that of science. In his treatment of such ideas as \"sensibility\", \"sentience\" and the like, he does not always make it clear whether he is speaking of physical or of psychical phenomena. Among other philosophic questions discussed in these two volumes the nature of casual relation is perhaps the one which is handled with most freshness and suggestiveness.\n\nThe third volume, \"The Physical Basis of Mind\", further develops the writer's views on organic activities as a whole. He insists on the radical distinction between organic and inorganic processes and the impossibility of explaining the former by purely mechanical principles. All parts of the nervous system have the same elementary property; sensibility. Thus sensibility belongs as much to the lower centres of the spinal cord as to the brain, the former, more elementary, form contributing to the subconscious region of mental life, while the higher functions of the nervous system, which make up our conscious mental life, are more complex modifications of this fundamental property of nerve substance.\n\nThe nervous organism acts as a whole, particular mental operations cannot be referred to definite regions of the brain, and the hypothesis of nervous activity by an isolated pathway from one nerve cell to another is altogether illusory. By insisting on the complete coincidence between the regions of nerve action and sentience, that these are but different aspects of one thing, he was able to attack the doctrine of animal and human automatism which affirms that feeling or consciousness is merely an incidental concomitant of nerve action in no way essential to the chain of physical events.\n\nLewes's views on psychology, partly explained in the earlier volumes of the \"Problems\", are more fully worked out in the last two (3rd series). He discussed the method of psychology with much insight. Against Comte and his followers he claimed a place for introspection in psychological research. As well as this subjective method there must be an objective one, a reference to nervous conditions and socio-historical data. Biology would help explain mental functions such as feeling and thinking, it would not help us to understand differences of mental faculty in different races and stages of human development. The organic conditions of these differences will probably for ever escape detection, hence they can be explained only as the products of the social environment. The relationship of mental phenomena to social and historical conditions is probably Lewes's most important contribution to psychology.\n\nHe also emphasised the complexity of mental phenomena. Every mental state is regarded as compounded of three factors in different proportions – sensible affection, logical grouping and motor impulse. But Lewes's work in psychology consists less in discoveries than in method. His biological experience prepared him to view mind as a complex unity of which the highest processes are identical with and evolved out of the lower. Thus the operation of thought, or \"the logic of signs\", is a more complicated form of the elementary operations of sensation and instinct or \"the logic of feeling\".\n\nThe last volume of the \"Problems\" illustrates this position. It is a valuable repository of psychological facts, many of them drawn from obscure regions of mental life and from abnormal experience. To suggest and to stimulate the mind, rather than to supply it with any complete system of knowledge, may be said to be Lewes's service to philosophy. The exceptional rapidity and versatility of his intelligence seems to account at once for the freshness in his way of envisaging the subject matter of philosophy and psychology, and for the want of satisfactory elaboration and of systematic co-ordination.\n\n\n\n"}

Among others he influenced the theories of Norberto Bobbio. He is famous for his book \"Justice\".\n\nSon of Julius Saviour, Giorgio Del Vecchio was professor of philosophy of law at the University of Ferrara (1904), Sassari (1906), Messina (1909), Bologna (1911) and Rome from 1920 to 1953. He became Rector of the University of Rome from 1925 to 1927. He initially adhered to Fascism like many philosophers of law in Italy (though he removed himself from fascist ideology early on). He lost his professorship twice and for opposite reasons: in 1938 at the hands of fascists because he was a Jew and in 1944 at the hands of anti-fascists because he was accused of sympathizing with fascism early on in his career.\n\nReinstated in teaching during the Second World War, he worked with the \"Century of Italy\" and the magazine \"Free Pages\" (publication directed by Vito Panucci). Along with Nino Tripodi, Gioacchino Volpe, Alberto Asquini, Roberto Cantalupo, Ernesto De Marzio and Emilio Betti, he was part of the organizing committee of INSPE, an Institute of research which in the fifties and sixties was opposed to Marxist culture, promoting international conferences and publications. He was founder and director of the \"International Journal of Philosophy of Law\".\n\nHe is considered among the major interpreters of Italian Neo-Kantism. Giorgio Del Vecchio, as did his German colleagues, criticized philosophical positivism, stating that the concept of law can not be derived from the observation of legal phenomena.\n\nIn this regard, his beliefs concurred with a dispute that was taking place in Germany between Philosophy, Sociology and Legal General theory which looked to redefine the \"philosophy of law\" to which Del Vecchio attributed these three tasks:\n\n\nDel Vecchio's books are used as reference and text books in many colleges and universities.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8810712", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8810712", "title": "Guqin aesthetics", "text": "Guqin aesthetics\n\nWhen the guqin is played, the modern name for a plucked seven-string Chinese musical instrument of the zither family, a number of aesthetic elements are involved. \n\nThe first aesthetic is musicality. In the second section of \"Pingsha Luoyan\", for example, the initial few bars contain a \"nao\" vibrato followed by a phase of sliding up and down the string, even when the sound has already become inaudible . The average person trained in music may question whether this is really \"music\". Normally, some players would pluck the string very lightly to create a very quiet sound. For some players, this plucking isn't necessary. Instead of trying to force a sound out of the string one should allow the natural sounds emit from the strings. Some players say that the sliding on the string even when the sound has disappeared is a distinctive feature in qin music. It creates a \"space\" or \"void\" in a piece, playing without playing, sound without sound. In fact, when the viewer looks at the player sliding on the string without sounds, the viewer automatically \"fills in the notes\" with their minds. This creates a connection between player, instrument and listener. This, of course, cannot happen when listening to a recording, as one cannot see the performer. It can also be seen as impractical in recording, as the player would want to convey sound as much as possible towards a third audience. But in fact, there is sound, the sound coming from the fingers sliding on the string. With a really good qin, silk strings, and a perfectly quiet environment, all the tones can be sounded. And since the music is more player oriented than listener oriented, and the player knows the music, he/she can hear it even if the sound is not there. And with silk strings the sliding sound might be called the qi or \"life force\" of the music. The really empty sounds are the pauses between notes. However, if one cannot create a sound that can be heard when sliding on a string, it is generally acceptable to lightly pluck the string to create a very quiet sound.\n\nIn the music of the qin, we often come across (especially in harmonics) the use of the same note to two different strings. A good example of this would be in the main harmonic sections of \"Meihua Sannong\", where at the last three notes of the first two phrases all play sol (first sol on the sixth string at 7th hui, second on third string at 9th hui, then again on the sixth string at 7th hui) . The question would be why does one need to play the sol on the third string when one can play sol thrice on the sixth string. One reason is timbre; although both these two positions sound the same note, they sound different or have a different quality to them. Another reason is to add flavor during performance. We have other examples, like the first two phrases of \"Shenren Chang\", where the playing of the harmonics is on the left of the qin on the first phrase, then the same notes are played on the right of the qin. This adds symmetry to the play, and we often see this in many qin melodies where the same notes are mimicked in a different way. \n\nQin music tends to linger on certain notes, with an emphasis on silence and timbre, giving it a meditative quality. Being an instrument historically associated with literati, its aim is Confucian (in trying to cultivate one's mind) as well as Daoist (in seeking harmony between man and nature). 「琴棋書畫」 (qin qi shu hua) refers to the Four Arts of the Chinese Scholar, wherein 『琴』 qin/music refers specifically to guqin. [This phrase is a rather late invention of the Song period (according to the \"Wuzhizhai Qinpu\"), so it is not clear how essential it was to the pedagogy of earlier scholar classes]. It is rarely used to play popular and fast tunes which are deemed to be vulgar to the instrument of the scholars. \n\nBecause of this, the qin is not so popular amongst the uninitiated, and because of the decline of its popularity in the periods of political disturbances (when the qin was seen as an elitist and feudal instrument. These days, the qin is referred to as a \"folk instrument\" to move away from these connotations), very few people are familiar with it, even in China. However, there has been a revival of interest in recent years, especially among Westerners, as the qin embodies a philosophy which appeals to those who wish to escape the stress and confusion of the modern world. Some may argue that the spiritual side is one of the most appealing aspects of qin music, since much other music concerned with entertainment, social bonding or academic issues, the music of the qin offers a breath of fresh air, concerning with the individual and his/her connection with nature and surroundings. Of course, there is no reason why one cannot submit to a realist and/or idealistic view of the purpose of the qin music. It all depends on the player's preference of what s/he wants out of qin music. \n\nThere is much comment in qin texts decrying \"vulgar\" music, but this really only means that there was much of it around. And it is interesting to hear people decry \"popular and fast tunes\" and then find out their favorite qin melody is \"Flowing Water\". By focusing only on what the scholars have idealized, people can miss a lot of the reality and beauty of pure music. \n\nSome people (particularly the younger generation) find qin music difficult to appreciate upon first listening. The reason for this may be because they rate it against music that they only heard in their life, namely modern or popular music. Because qin music is very simple and plain (minimalist, some might say), they may find it boring when compared to the fast beat and sound saturated songs of the modern era. This can lead to a misunderstanding of the true nature of qin music and its aesthetic purposes. Perhaps some people's perceptions of qin music can be summed up in a quote:\n\nOn the other hand, musicians and music lovers can easily appreciate qin music because they can hear music objectively and have a better understanding of music in an ethnomusicological context. \n\nThere has also been a move to a more Western approach to qin music. A handful of professional players prefer to look at the qin from a purely realist and scientific approach, treating the qin as a purely musical instrument, rather than a cultural phenomenon. This is due to some traditionalists treating the instrument as an 'other-worldly' object than a 'this-worldly' one. \nThis move to a much more technical approach signifies a progression in qin study and appreciation; holding on to too much old values tends to impede the transmission of qin. An example would be composition. Although around 60-odd new compositions have been composed for the qin since the 1960s, all in all, no one plays them. The reason is that many believe these new compositions do not compare with ancient scores. But technically, these ancient scores were new at the time when they were composed. Some fear that in 100 years' time, people then might say that we have contributed nothing new to qin. That is not to say that the qin cannot be viewed in a traditional way, but to say that the qin is also capable of a progression into new territory. There is no reason why players cannot embrace both traditional and scientific study of the qin.\n\nIn the past, written in a lot of literature, there is discussion and analysis of what is called \"shengjiang\" 〔聲像〕 or \"manifestations of sound\" of the qin. These are basically single words used to describe the mood or theme of the piece. The number of these 'manifestations' are disputed. Some say only 4, some say 13-16, and some say over 24. Listed in some \"qinpu\" they have very lengthy descriptions of each manifestation, going into every detail. \n\nThe most basic words used to describe qin music are, for example, Yushan school's \"qing\" 『清』, \"wei\" 『微』, \"dan\" 『淡』 and \"yuan\" 『遠』, or \"pure\", \"profound\", \"light\" and \"distant\". Another important essay on qin manifestations is \"Xishan Qinkuang\" 【谿山琴况】 which lists 24 qin manifestations in great detail. This essay has several layers; some words describe the playing method, some describe ornamentation and some describe the body of the music. They also explain the union between musician and instrument and how to achieve unity with the music.\n\n"}

{"id": "46815289", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46815289", "title": "Ikka myōju", "text": "Ikka myōju\n\nIkka myōju (), known in English as One Bright Jewel or One Bright Pearl, is a book of the Shōbōgenzō by the 13th century Sōtō Zen monk Eihei Dōgen. It was written in the summer of 1238 at Dōgen's monastery Kōshōhōrin-ji in Kyoto. The essay marked the beginning of a period of high output of Shōbōgenzō books that lasted until 1246. The book appears as the seventh book in both the 75 and 60 fascicle versions of the \"Shōbōgenzō\", and it is ordered fourth in the later chronological 95 fascicle \"Honzan\" editions. The essay is an extended commentary on the famous saying of the Tang Dynasty monk Xuansha Shibei that \"the ten-direction world is one bright jewel\", which in turn references the Mani Jewel metaphors of earlier Buddhist scriptures. Dōgen also discusses the \"one bright jewel\" and related concepts from the Shōbōgenzō essay in two of his formal Dharma Hall Discourses, namely numbers 107 and 445, as well as his Kōan commentaries 23 and 41, all of which are recorded in the Eihei Kōroku.\n\nThe title of the essay is often translated into English as \"One Bright Pearl\" instead of \"One Bright Jewel\". Shohaku Okumura, a modern Zen priest and Dōgen scholar, points out that while the character in question (珠) can be used to refer to a pearl, gem, or any kind of jewel, the text clearly uses the term in reference to the \"Mani Jewel\" (摩尼珠), a mythical transparent object mentioned in a wide variety of Buddhist texts. Because pearls are not transparent, and because the transparency is essential for the meaning of the essay, \"pearl\" is therefore incongruous with the context of the writing. Okumura further argues that a knowledge of the Mani Jewel as it appears in prior texts is essential for understanding the meaning of Dōgen's essay.\n\nThe Mani Jewel makes its first appearance in the Pali Nikāyas where it is mentioned as one of the seven treasures owned by a \"wheel-turning king\". The Mahasudhassana Sutta in the Digha Nikaya describes the Mani Jewel as follows:\n\n“It was a beryl, pure, excellent, well-cut \ninto eight facets, clear, bright, unflawed, \nperfect in every respect. The luster of this \nJewel-Treasure radiated for an entire yojana \nround about.\nThe Mani Jewel in this text serves as the source of virtue and good governance for the king. Without it he would lose his throne.\n\nLater texts describe the Mani Jewel differently. One version is the Cintamani or wish-fulfilling jewel. It was said to be originally owned by the God Indra, but it fell to the earth during a war with the Asuras, allowing whoever possess it to have their wishes granted. Depictions of the Bodhisattvas Ksitigarbha and Avalokiteshvara sometimes show them holding this Cintamani, indicating their ability to fulfill the wishes of sentient beings.\n\nThe Mani Jewel also appears as a water purifying jewel (清水摩尼) where it could be placed in muddy water by traveling monks, causing any cloudiness to settle out leaving the water clear and pure. This version of the jewel is mentioned in the Abhidharma-kosa where it is used as a metaphor for faith as an agent capable of dispelling uncertainty.\n\nYet another depiction of the jewel is in the metaphor of Indra's net which appears in the Avatamsaka Sutra. It describes a net of infinite size with infinite knots, with each knot containing a Mani Jewel with infinite facets. Each individual Mani Jewel reflects every other Mani Jewel in the same way that any individual being or phenomenon is indistinguishable from the whole or noumenon due to their fundamental interconnectedness.\n\nThe Lankavatara Sutra, the Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment, and the Surangama Sutra all used the Mani Jewel as metaphors for Buddha-nature. It was this metaphor in particular that Xuansha Shibei had in mind for his expression \"the ten-direction world is one bright jewel\", and is thus the primary focus of Dōgen's essay. In these sutras, a transparent Mani Jewel within us changes colors depending on the conditions around us, representing the five skandhas. The Mani Jewel itself represents each being's Buddha-nature, but because of the three poisons of ignorance, attachment, and aversion, a being sees only the various colors emitted by the jewel. These are mistakenly perceived as the defilements rather than the purity of the jewel itself, which is merely reflecting conditions around it. Thus Buddha-nature is not perceived and only the five skandhas are seen, which are then conflated with a sense of self in opposition to the Buddhist idea of anātman or no-self.\n\nLater, the Mani Jewel began to appear in texts produced by Zen Buddhists. An early example is found in Guifeng Zongmi's work \"Chart of the Master-Disciple Succession of the Chan Gate That Transmits the Mind Ground in China\" in which he compares the four contemporary Zen schools: the Northern School, the Ox Head School, the Hongzhou school and the Heze school. He accomplishes this by comparing how each school would interpret the Mani Jewel metaphor used in the Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment discussed above. The text also contains the first use of the specific phrase, \"one bright jewel\" (一顆明珠). According to Guifeng, the Northern School would believe in a fundamentally pure Mani Jewel that must be cleaned to reveal its purity; the Ox Head school would perceive both the color reflections and the Mani Jewel itself as empty; the Hongzhou school would say that the blackness covering the Mani Jewel is the Jewel itself, and that its purity can never be seen; the Heze School (to which Guifeng belonged) would interpret the black color covering the jewel as an illusion that is in fact just a manifestation of its brightness such that the surface defilements and the purity of the Jewel interpenetrate one another.\n"}

{"id": "44673100", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44673100", "title": "Kenneth M. Sayre", "text": "Kenneth M. Sayre\n\nKenneth M. Sayre is an American philosopher who spent most of his career at the University of Notre Dame (ND). His early career was devoted mainly to philosophic applications of artificial intelligence, cybernetics, and information theory. Later on his main interests shifted to Plato, philosophy of mind, and environmental philosophy. His retirement in 2014 was marked by publication of a history of ND's Philosophy Department, \"Adventures in Philosophy at Notre Dame\".\n\nSayre was born on August 13, 1928, in Scottsbluff, Nebraska. After graduating from high school in 1946, he spent two years in the US Navy as an electronics technician. He received an AB in 1952 from Grinnell College, Iowa, with a joint major in philosophy and mathematics. Harvard University granted him an MA in 1954 and a PhD in 1958, both in philosophy. From 1953 to 1956 he served as Assistant Dean of Harvard's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. While completing his thesis, he spent two years as a systems analyst in MIT's Lincoln Laboratory. He taught at ND from 1958 to 2014, with interim appointments at Princeton University (1966–67), Bowling Green State University (1981), Oxford University (1985), and Cambridge University (1996).\n\nUnder the influence of Marvin Minsky and Oliver Selfridge at Lincoln Laboratory, Sayre became the first trained philosopher on record to become actively involved in the new field of artificial intelligence (AI). In \"Recognition: A Study in the Philosophy of Artificial Intelligence\", his first book on the topic, he set forward the working maxim that our “understanding of a type of human behavior and our ability to simulate it go hand in hand.” A corollary is that a promising way to study natural intelligence is to attempt to reproduce it artificially.\n\nThis corollary was behind his establishment of ND's Philosophical Institute for Artificial Intelligence (PIAI) in 1965. The initial goal of this institute was to build an automated system for recognizing cursive handwriting. By 1973, the PIAI had produced a handwriting recognition system more successful than any other currently available. A by-product of this effort was the discovery of a fundamental problem of automated handwriting recognition that came to be known as Sayre's paradox. Simply stated, the paradox is that a cursively written word cannot be recognized without being segmented and cannot be segmented without being recognized. The more promising approaches to automated handwriting recognition today have resulted from attempts to circumvent Sayre's Paradox.\n\nOther studies in AI published by Sayre are \"Consciousness: A Philosophic study of Minds and Machines\" and \"The Modeling of Mind\". He also contributed the article “Artificial Intelligence” to the \"Encyclopedia of Religion\", edited by Mircea Eliade.\n\nThe descriptive title of Norbert Wiener’s seminal book, \"Cybernetics: or, Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine\", indicates that cybernetics is concerned both with the control of functioning systems and the communication processes involved in that control. Also evident from the title is that cybernetics is concerned with functional parallels between biological and mechanical control systems. Given this overlap of interest between AI and cybernetics, it was natural that Sayre’s early interest in AI led to a parallel interest in cybernetics.\n\nKey concepts in control theory are negative and positive feedback. The concepts of positive and negative feedback are featured in Sayre’s 1976 \"Cybernetics and the Philosophy of Mind\". Other publications on cybernetics include his co-edited \"Philosophy and Cybernetics\", an encyclopedia article “Cybernetics,” and a chapter by that title in the \"Routledge History of Philosophy\".\n\nThe study of communication in cybernetics centers on communication theory, in the technical sense established by Claude Shannon’s “A Mathematical Theory of Communication.” This mathematical discipline is more commonly known today as information theory. Sayre learned information theory from ND's James Massey, winner of the 1988 Claude E. Shannon Award and an early collaborator in the PIAI handwriting recognition project.\n\nAfter the handwriting project, information theory continued to figure in Sayre's research. His monograph-length “Intentionality and Information Processing: An Alternative Model for Cognitive Science” appeared in 1986. In 1998 he contributed the entry on information theory to the \"Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy\".\n\nEarly publications by Sayre in this area include “Pattern Recognition Mechanisms and St. Thomas’ Theory of Abstraction,” coauthored with Joseph Bobik in 1963, and “The Cybernetic Approach to the Philosophy of Mind: A Dialogue” with James Heffernan in 1980. The most comprehensive presentation of his views in this are in the previously mentioned \"Cybernetics and the Philosophy of Mind\" (1976, reprinted 2014).\n\nOne widely discussed view in this book is Sayre's version of neutral monism. As he defines it, neutral monism is the thesis that mind and matter are both reducible to an ontologically more basic “neutral” principle. The more basic principle in his account is information, in the technical sense of information theory. Sayre's version has been recognized by several recent authors as one of the more credible forms of neutral monism available to date.\n\nSayre taught numerous seminar and lecture courses in environmental philosophy during the decade prior to his retirement. One of these courses was videotaped in 2007 and made available under ND's OpenCourseWare program. His 2010 book \"Unearthed: The Economic Roots of our Environmental Crisis\" develops the theme that economic production since the Industrial Revolution has degraded the biosphere to a point where it soon will be incapable of supporting human society as we know it, and that radical reductions in consumption are necessary to forestall this result.\n\nIn a period spanning almost 50 years, Sayre has written five books and approximately two dozen shorter works on Plato. In 1987 and 1993 he presented lectures to the Boston Area Colloquium in Ancient Philosophy. He contributed four entries to \"The Continuum Companion to Plato\".\n\nThe first book, \"Plato’s Analytic Method\" (1969), shows that the method of hypothesis employed in the \"Theaetetus\" overlaps with the \"Sophist\"’s method of collection and division inasmuch as both are procedures for determining necessary and sufficient conditions for a thing's being what it is.\n\nStandard scholarship holds that the views attributed to Plato by Aristotle in Book A of the \"Metaphysics\" cannot be found in the Platonic dialogues, and that the reason is either that Aristotle simply did not understand the views in question or that they are part of an unwritten Platonic corpus. Sayre's second book, \"Plato’s Late Ontology: A Riddle Resolved\" (1983), argues that these views in fact are present in the \"Philebus\" but are expressed in terminology not frequently used by Aristotle.\n\nThe unifying theme of \"Plato’s Literary Garden\" (1995) is that Plato wrote his dialogues to engage his readers in philosophic conversations similar to those he shared with Socrates. The book develops this theme with discussions of various early and middle dialogues, including the \"Meno\", the \"Phaedo\", the \"Phaedrus\", the \"Symposium\", and the \"Republic\".\n\n\"Parmenides Lesson: Translation and Explication of Plato’s Parmenides\" (1996) contains a line-by-line commentary on Plato's most difficult dialogue. The latter three-quarters of the dialogue consists of consequences drawn from eight hypotheses about Unity, which commentators traditionally have paired in ways that make them appear contradictory. This book shows that when the hypothesis are paired in a different but no less plausible way, the consequences not only are compatible but moreover add up to a defense of Plato's later Pythagorean ontology against the Eleatic Ontology of the middle dialogues.\n\nIn \"Metaphysics and Method in Plato’s Statesman\" (2006), the part on metaphysics brings passages from Aristotle's Neoplatonic commentators to bear in showing that the ontology of the \"Philebus\" is present in the \"Statesman\" as well. The part dealing with method argues that the procedure of collection in the Sophist is superseded by the use of paradigms in the \"Statesman\", and that bipartite division in the \"Sophist\" is replaced by multipartite division in service of a method similar to the method of negation employed in the \"Parmenides\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "59052395", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=59052395", "title": "Light on Yoga", "text": "Light on Yoga\n\nLight on Yoga: Yoga Dipika (Sanskrit: योग दीपिका \"Yoga Dipika\") is a 1966 book on the Iyengar Yoga style of hatha yoga by B. K. S. Iyengar. It describes more than 200 yoga postures or asanas, and is illustrated with some 600 monochrome photographs of Iyengar demonstrating these.\n\nThe book has been described as the bible of modern yoga. It has been translated into at least 17 languages and has sold over three million copies.\n\nB. K. S. Iyengar (1918-2014) was born in a poor family of Brahmins in Karnataka, India. In childhood he suffered from diseases including typhoid, malaria and tuberculosis, and became extremely stiff. At the age of 18 he decided to spend his life doing yoga, and by 1938 he was already performing the asanas fluently. The violinist Yehudi Menuhin became his pupil in 1952 and then invited Iyengar to teach in Europe, which he did from the 1960s. Iyengar made yoga popular, first in India and then around the world.\n\n\"Light on Yoga\" was first published by George Allen and Unwin in 1966, with a foreword by his pupil, the violinist Yehudi Menuhin. Revised editions were brought out in 1968 and 1976. A paperback edition was published by The Aquarian Press in 1991 under the Thorsons imprint. The book became an international best-seller; it has been translated into at least 23 languages including Chinese, Czech, and Russian, and has sold over three million copies.\n\nThe book has three parts, a technical introduction to yoga, in which hatha yoga is explained to be one component; a detailed illustrated description of the asanas (some 200 postures, illustrated by some 600 monochrome photographs of Iyengar); and an account of pranayama, yoga breathing. An appendix defines a set of asana courses, i.e. which postures to do each week, building up in difficulty, in courses structured to last up to 300 weeks. A second appendix defines the asanas supposed to be \"curative\" for a range of diseases and conditions from \"Acidity\" to \"Varicose Veins\". The book has a glossary of all the Sanskrit terms employed.\n\nEach asana is named in Sanskrit with its etymology, graded, and described separately with two or more pages of text and monochrome photographs of Iyengar. For example, Utthita Trikonasana, the extended triangle pose, is stated to be at grade 3 out of a possible 60 in terms of difficulty. The technique for going into the triangle pose, performing it, and returning from it, is described in eight steps. The technique is written as a set of instructions, such as \"Inhale deeply and with a jump spread apart the legs sideways 3 to 3½ feet\". Its claimed effects on the muscles and body are described in a concluding paragraph. The three photographs show Iyengar in a preparatory pose and then in the triangle pose itself from front and rear.\n\n\"Light on Yoga\" has become known as the \"bible\" of yoga; \"Publisher's Weekly\" wrote that it \"set the standard\" for books about yoga, with instructions and illustrations of the poses. \n\nYehudi Menuhin, in his foreword to the book, wrote that \"Whoever has had the privilege of receiving Mr Iyengar's attention, or of witnessing the precision, refinement and beauty of his art, is introduced to that vision of perfection and innocence which is man as first created — unarmed, unashamed, son of God, lord of creation — in the Garden of Eden\".\n\nMichelle Goldberg, in \"The New Yorker\", states that the book \"remains unparallelled as a guide to asana practice\", and quotes \"Yoga Journal\" as saying \"when 'teachers refer to the correct way to do a posture, they're usually alluding to the alignment Mr. Iyengar instructs and expertly models in his book.'\" She notes that while Iyengar attributes the asanas to Patanjali's \"Yoga Sutras\", he was being \"too modest. It was he, not any ancient sage, who figured out how to show people the world over the safest way to stand on their heads.\" For example, she explains, the triangle pose and the sun salutation \"don't appear in any ancient yogic text\" but were put together into a method by Iyengar's brother-in-law and first teacher, Krishnamacharya.\n\nDerek Beres, writing in \"Big Think\", called the book \"wildly popular\" and \"essentially the bible for yoga practitioners.\" He describes some of the science that Iyengar claims for yoga as suspect: \"Iyengar had a habit of calling things proven even though no actual scientific research had been conducted.\" Beres tried Iyengar yoga alongside the \"more aerobic Vinyasa\" style, and \"always appreciated <nowiki>[</nowiki>Iyengar yoga's<nowiki>]</nowiki> anatomical focus and the emphasis on breath before anything else.\"\n\nThe yoga teacher Bernie Gourley notes the book's strengths, the asanas \"with his perfect alignment\", but also that the book does not \"systematically address contraindications\" to each asana, nor does it provide evidence for the claimed benefits.\n\nThe \"Light on Yoga\" project by the yoga teacher Jack Cuneo and the photographer Rick Cummings has attempted to photograph all the yoga poses in the book, to be followed by restating all the instructions in Cuneo's own words.\n"}

He is best known for developing \"Ontetic Philosophy\".\n\nMahmoud Khatami grew up in Tehran. Showing an early interest in humanities, he attended the Seminary of Islamic Studies, which gained him the traditional degree of \"Ijtihad\", the highest level in Islamic religious and theological learning. Concurrently, he attended the University of Tehran to pursue his secular education for BA, MA and MS, and finally a PhD in philosophy. Afterwards, he continued his further education in England, where he was awarded his second PhD and post- doc in the field of Philosophical Psychology.\n\nReturning to Iran, he was appointed to the Department of Philosophy at University of Tehran in 1997 where he is now a Professor of Contemporary Philosophy. In 2002, he was appointed as Fellow of Iran's Academy of the Arts. In the meantime, Khatami has been invited, and visiting professor at Iranian as well as Western universities , and has been rewarded and awarded for his academic excellence both inside and outside Iran.\n\nIn November 2014, some reports were published that charged Mahmoud Khatami with extensive plagiarism. Some philosophy researchers followed up on this claim and compared his papers with the others' ones and published the results, which confirmed the claim, on their blogs. The Organon F, international journal of analytic philosophy, has officially announced that \"The paper entitled 'The Epistemological Quest: From the Possibility of Experience to the Possibility of Communication' (Organon F, 10, 2003, No. 4, 357–379) published under the name of Mahmoud Khatami was withdrawn from our web page. It turned out that the paper was almost a verbatim copy of another work which appeared as a book chapter written by someone else\". On December 1, 2014, the University of Tehran has issued a statement on the plagiarism allegations against Mahmoud Khatami declaring that \"should charges be proved, the university would punish the wrongdoer severely, and refer the case to the proper authorities. However, if the allegations are proved wrong, the University, as always, has the obligation to defend its faculty members\".\n\nTrained in phenomenology as well as classical Islamic philosophy, and profoundly affected by the philosophies of Suhrawardi and Mulla Sadra, and encouraged by philosophy of Martin Heidegger, Khatami developed a distinctive approach that rejects subjectivism and relativism, abjures any simple notion of interpretive method, and focuses on the study of the nature of being.\n\nHis work is concentrated in the development of what Khatami terms \"ontetic philosophy\", encompassing cognitive and conative aspects of being. Khatami's main concern is humanity and human being. His works provide a specific interpretation of humanity, the self and consciousness, and an understanding of the idea of subjectivity. Khatami argues for the efficiency of action as primordial constituent of human being.His philosophy provides an account of the proper ground for human subjectivity while rejecting modern subjectivism. This is not a rejection of modern concerns, but an insistence on the limit of modern understanding.He has also worked intensively on morality and religion as well as the theory and application of art. Khatami's thinking began and remained connected with the Persian thought. The \"Persian\" character of Khatami's approach is evident, not merely in the central theoretical role he gives to the concept of philosophy in his thinking, but also in his own personal commitment to intellectual engagement and exchange. Indeed, he is one of the few philosophers for whom the \"Persian\" has become a significant category to \"supply\" a positive output of modern philosophy. His early engagement with this tradition determined much of the character and direction of his thinking.\n\nCoined by Khatami himself, the term \"ontetic\" does not merely mean \"ontological\" or \"existential\" in the western sense; in addition to these, this term also means \"fuzzy\" and \"hierarchic\". It indicates the order of Being and its purity. Consequently, the ontetic philosophy is the intellectual articulation of human approach toward a complete grasp of the order of Being. \"ontetic\" in his terminology refers to the old understanding Persian conception of light which simultaneously indicates being, consciousness, life and action. this conception constituted on a graded logic which is called in hiss terminology the logic of \"Tashkik\". All the way, this conception and logic is fundamental for human being and his relations. Being contemplated by philosophy is expressed by man himself, and therefore man's relations with the world, as also with Him, become central for the sphere of philosophy. Man is an acting subject, a free agent, capable of choosing between various ends compatible with the circumstances of his life, and insofar he is responsible for those relations; and, on the other hand, he has an end appointed him by nature which is obligatory upon him as his moral end. A philosophical knowledge of the world, then, must entail a philosophical knowledge or thorough explanation of the reasons of man's duties flowing from his relation to things and to Him.\n\nFurthermore, man has the power of reflecting on his own knowledge; as is seen from the fact that the understanding of what knowledge is, is distinct from knowledge, that the study of the logical structure of science is distinct from the knowledge he acquires of real things. Hence do we arrive at the more comprehensive definition, that philosophy is the full understanding of the order of Being, and in its shadow, of man's situation in it, and of his moral duties and responsibilities resulting from it, and of his knowledge of reality.\n\nKhatami's concept of philosophy requires man to be central for the philosophical discussion, and he is faithful to this requirement. However, he enters to the philosophy scene from the \"modernity door.\" Influenced by Heidegger, Khatami radically understands modernity as a subjectivistic process in which a very specific concept of man has developed. He writes: \"Heidegger who questioned the subjectivistic foundation of modern concept of man and the world called for an original thinking to determine what and how man is.\" Khatami tries to respond to his quest. Not dealing with Heidegger's answer, but not disregarding it, Khatami suggests an otherwise notion of Man and Subjectivity by stepping back toward Persian illuminative thought within which he tries to glimpse a hint of a human subject which is the source of the world, and even created and in this respect he is nothing without God, yet he is eternal, absolute, prior to the world, master of the world, and all the things are manifested from his light.\n\nKhatami's reference to this perspective provides \"an interesting frame, and a spur to look for patterns that other accounts of the material treated in modern time were likely to miss\". In this matter, Khatami offers a hermeneutic reading of the conception of Man in the Persian illuminative philosophy. Khatami innovatively inquires about the potential philosophical possibilities by virtue of which this philosophy would assist the current debates that attempt to overcome the influences of modern subjectivism on the conception of Man, of his self and of his subjectivity. To reach this goal, Khatami has reconstructed a method tacitly employed by Mulla Sadra in his doctrine of the illuminative existentialism.\n\nThis reconstruction happens to Khatami in the light of Persian Illuminative Philosophy and his hermeneutic assessment of phenomenology. Khatami's chief aim of this reconstruction was to present a transcendent notion of fuzzy reduction that is crucial for his discussion of his ontetic model. Herein, his hermeneutic reading of Sadra's philosophy is set within a broader consideration of the course of development of theories of subjectivity as manifested in the works of Descartes, Hume, Kant, and Husserl. In this context, he reaches the conclusion that the modern conception of subjectivity, that has no corresponding field of experience, or of empirically based qualities, does not amount to being more than a vacuous concept.\n\nAgainst this, Khatami shows how he is able to overcome this conception in the name of an ontetic subjectivity gained by stepping back to the Persian traditional philosophy. There are two crucial elements to Khatami's appropriation of Persian philosophy: first, the focus on cognition, and the connection of cognition with Being; second, the focus on Being itself as the event of prior and partial disclosure in which we are already involved and that can never be made completely transparent. Both of these elements are connected with Khatami's response to the subjectivist element in modern thought. By turning back to the direct experience, and to the concept of Being as prior and partial disclosure, Khatami was able to develop an alternative to subjectivism that also connected with the ideas taken from Suhravardi, and Mulla Sadra, and of the hermeneutical ontology of Heidegger.\n\nJust as the human being is taken as central and determining in the experience of Being, so is cognition similarly determined by the matter to be recognized; as the experience of Being reveals, not in spite of, but precisely because of the way it also conceals, so cognition is possible, not in spite of, but precisely because of its prior involvement. In Khatami's theory, the concept of \"presence\" has an important role here. Khatami takes presence as the basic clue to Being, emphasizing the way in which presence something that has its own order and structure to which man is given over. Presence has obvious affinities with all of the other concepts at issue in his ontetic philosophy. Indeed, one can take it as providing slightly different elaboration of what is essentially the same basic conception of mind that takes our finitude, that is, our prior involvement and partiality, not as a barrier to human \"being\", but rather as its enabling condition. It is this conception that is worked out in detail in Sadraean Meditations.\n\nOne might react to Khatami's emphasis on our \"ontetic presence\" involvement, that such involvement cannot but remain subjectivistic simply on the grounds that it is always determined to experience things in certain ways rather than others. Such an objection can be seen as a simple reiteration of the basic tendency towards subjectivism that Khatami rejects, but Khatami also takes issue directly with this view, and the negative connotations often associated with the notion, arguing that, rather than closing us off, our presence is what open us up to what is to be recognized.\n\nIn \"Sadraean Meditations\" and in \"From a Sadraean Point of View\", Khatami redeploys the notion of our presence as it is worked out in more particular fashion than in Sadra's \"Asfar\". Khatami's positive conception of presence can be seen as connected with a number of different ideas in his philosophy. The way in which our presence opens us up to matter at issue in such a way that our presence capable of being revised exhibits the character of this concept, and its role in human life. The ontetic priority Khatami assigns to presence is also tied to Khatami's emphasis on the priority of the question in the structure of human being. Moreover, the indispensable role of presence in human being connects directly with Khatami's rethinking of the practical life. All human being are necessarily oriented to present concerns and interests, and it is those present concerns and interests that allow us to enter into the communication with the world. The presence character of man means that, he is involved in a connection that encompasses both his own self-realization and his cognition of the environment. Our self-realization and cognition always occurs against the background of this prior presence.\n\nOn this basis, Khatami thus advances a view of subjectivity that rejects the idea of subjectivity as achieved through modern philosophy that indicates gaining access to some inner realm of subjective meaning. For him, subjectivity is an ongoing process, rather than something that is ever completed, so he also rejects the idea that there is any final determinacy to human subjectivity.\n\nBriefly, Khatami is seeking for a model of subjectivity capable of meeting modern requirements, and convening the privileges of modern subjectivism, but has more to say about man and its spiritual nature. Regarding this goal, one may organize his endeavour in three steps; first he tries to reevaluate modern subjectivism and ventures to amend it by interpreting the legionnaires of modernity; second, he tries to construe the classic Persian conception of man as an ontetic absolute subject who can be reformulated in modern terms; third, he tries to show a rhezomatic turn in the depth of modern subjectivism toward a neutral spirituality and divinity.\n\nSupporting Heidegger, Khatami says that modernity is philosophically characterized by subjectivism whose history began with Descartes. Historically speaking, the modern sense of man formulated later by Kant's Copernican Revolution, according to which man become an autonomous agent of knowledge and action. Kant's pluralistic approach to the problem of subject and object relation led him to presuppose a transcendental characteristic for human subjectivity. Khatami considers Kant's \"subjectivistic turn\" to analyze this characteristic in order to go beyond its formal sense and revise either aspects of subjectivity. While he regards Hegel's early critique of Kant's transcendental reflection as a significant step in surpassing the formal approach to the transcendental subjectivity, he nevertheless continues to deformalize the transcendental and consider it as \"latent\". The latent, in Khatami's view, is what I am because I am essentially memory, full of my past; this plenitude is not, however, specified into images, but determines the meaning of my being in the present. Khatami argues that, by attributing the transcendental as latent to memory, we seem to make it empirical. Nevertheless, Khatami retains an ontological meaning for memory—meaning for which memory is not only the recollection of my own history or the résumé of my own experience, but also the very possibility of experience: the transcendental as latent. Consequently, he infers, when the transcendental is considered in its activity with respect to the object, we must say that it is implicitly known, and in its relation with the subject, it is this implicit knowledge, the latent, itself. This knowledge, according to the formal reality, is the structure of subject. This structure has an activity: it guarantees for the subject a profound being both universal and singular, and it promotes intersubjectivity – understood as the communication of the similar subjects.\n\nFollowing the first step, Khatami tries to reformulate the human subject as absolute. He reconsiders here the illuminative tradition of Persian thought a notion of man who is both more than the world and less than the world. As for the former, man, descending from God, is a comprehensive totality as macrocosm within which and through which the world is created; while as for the latter, he, ascending to God, is a singular individual as microcosm shattered and fallen down to the earth, but still has the same colour of the divine essence within him. Khatami highlights the former aspect of this notion which is the source of the latter, and, at the same time, sheds light on the \"concealed\" essence of human being which is \"forgotten\" in modern subjectivism. This notion of man constitutes his essence as the integration of the divine inward as well as outward names. Thus, the illuminative man is homocosm of the divine and the worldly realities. He was created as God's vicegerent while the entire world is a particularization of what exists in him. The world was thus created through man and for man, even though in the visible world man appeared the last. The illuminative man, in this capacity, can like Him create by uttering the command \"be\", is keen on exhibiting his ability to control nature, and above all an absolute subject who comprehends all creation and, by means of that comprehension, comes to dominate over the world and name that which it comprehends. He is Absolute in the sense of God's vicegerent: The only Created Creator.\n\nThe ontetic model of subjectivity offered by Khatami led him to a very crucial point in the modern world: technology. Khatami tries to support this idea that an ontetic subject is still alive behind the technological veil of the modern world.\n\nIn sum, Khatami's ontetic model suggests that we can discern not only a shadow of the ontetic subject in today's technological world but also a figure of the technological subject already in more traditional metaphysics.\n\n14. \"Philosophy of Mind\", Tehran: Elm Publisher 2008 (p)\n\n15. \"Background of Modernity\", Tehran: Elm 2009 (p)\n\n16. \"Metaphysics of Man: Outline of a Philosophy\", Published by Dr.Muller House, 2010(E)\n\n17. \"Psychosomatology: Cognition and Conatiomn\", Published by Dr.Muller House, 2010(E)\n\n18. \"From Consciousness to Conscience: An Introduction to the Transcendence of the Self\", Published by Dr.Muller House, 2010(E)\n\n19. \"The Ontetic Self\", Published by Dr.Muller House, 2010(E)\n\n20. \"Transcendental Subjectivity:A Reflection\", Published by Dr.Muller House, 2010 (E)\n\n21. \"Beauty: An Aesthetic Approach\", Published by Dr.Muller House, 2010(E)\n\n22. \"Morality\", Published by Dr.Muller House, 2010(E)\n\n23. \"The Ethical, The Aesthetical: Essays\", Published by Dr.Muller House, 2010(E)\n\n24. \"Basic Problems of Epistemology\", Published by Dr.Muller House, 2010(E)\n\n25.\" Axiology of Art: A Prolegomenon\", Published by Dr.Muller House, 2010(E)\n\n26. \"From a Sadraean Point of View: Towards an Elimination of the Subjectivistic self\", London Academy of Iranian Studies, London 2004 (E)\n\n27. \"Sadraean Meditations: Toward a Transcendent Philosophy of Mind\", Lekton 2003(E)\n\n28. \"Affections: Preliminaries For A theory\", LAP Lambert Academic Publishing ( 2013)(E)\n\n28. \"Prolegomena for a Philosophy of Persian Art\", Iranian Academy of Arts Publication, Tehran, Iran (2011) (P)\n\n\n\n"}

Several consequences follow from a right having the nature of property, as opposed to being a personal right, like a contract or obligation to pay compensation. Historically, the law has given privileged remedies to the holders of property rights over personal claims. These have included priority in payment from an insolvent debtor, a greater likelihood of being awarded specific performance, and security in remaining in possession of land or some other asset against termination of the right to possess. It holds especial importance in land law and corporate law.\n\nThe numerus clausus principle has its roots in Roman law.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, and particularly in the jurisprudence of the English courts, it is well established that individuals cannot freely create new categories of property right themselves: it has to be recognised by courts. This was held to be true in the 19th century in \"Keppell v Bailey\" and \"Hill v Tupper\" as a matter of public policy. In the 20th century, in \"National Provincial Bank Ltd v Ainsworth\" with a more open approach, Lord Wilberforce stated that\n\nA widely held view is that a \"numerus clausus\", or a property right limit, serves to protect wealth in the scope where it already exists, and does not need extension. This tends to be contested on the basis acknowledgement of property rights simply masks a privilege for people who have enough bargaining power to exercise the freedom of contract for the various privileges that property rights confer, such as priority in insolvency, security of tenure, a right to trace or follow an asset, and a greater likelihood of specific performance as a remedy.\n\nUnder English law today, there are fourteen property rights in the \"numerus clausus\", as follows.\n\n\nBefore the Law of Property Act 1925, the life estate and the entail would have also counted as property rights, but they were abolished except as beneficial interests under a trust.\n\nIn German law, the \"numerus clausus\" principle has a constitutional foundation and limits property rights in their number (Typenzwang) and content (Typenfixierung).\n\nOther European states show equal doctrines.\n\nThere are competing views about the desirability of having a limited \"numerus clausus\" of property rights, as well as what counts as having a proprietary quality.\n\n\n"}

His analysis of earliest known star map in Egypt - the ‘Senmut star-map’ lead to von Spaeth publishing an exact dating of its time and period in Egyptian history and of the reign of Queen Hatshepsut.\n\nBy using astronomical approach on the Senmut map, von Spaeth computed and verified the presence of distinctive planetary conjunctions represented as a factual occurrence in the sky. This allowed the calculation of an exact dating of its time and thus the period in Egyptian history.\n\nThe book is an experiment in visual effects of images from cities around the world. Von Spaeth tries to enhanced the emotional experience of urban environments by using long exposures and typographic compositions containing multiple levels of printed text\n\nVon Spaeth's typographic experimental book tried to capture a slice of contemporary history as it was unfolding in Denmark. The book’s psychedelic subject is formulated through the author’s artistic layout and visual arrangement.\n\nThe series of five books on the biblical figure Moses, is a semi fictional work based on ancient textual sources such as the Rabbinical Writings’, archaeological evidence, and astronomical data. Von Spaeth attempts to develop a historical alternative view of Moses Egyptian background.\n\nIn the first book of a series, von Spaeth suggests that Moses was an Egyptian prince and heir to the throne who found himself disinherited and forced into exile as a result of complex plots and intrigues at the royal court of Pharaohs Hatshepsut and Thutmosis III (approx. 1500 BC).\n\nThe book had a good reception though it failed to get scientific recognition from the Danish Carsten Niebuhr Institute.\n\nThe second book suggests that Moses was born to Queen Hatshepsut 3500 years ago, rose to power as a high-ranking leader among the Egyptian elite, was ousted in a coup, along with his mother, and records of his existence were systematically erased. Von Speath devots a significant portion of the book to draw parallels between Moses and Queen Hatshepsut’s chief consul Senmut.\n\nThe reception of the second book was very positive one critic calling it \"especially impressive\". Though others found it scientific lacking, but excellent as crime fiction.\n\nIn the third book Moses is an exiled prince who repeatedly tries to regain his claim to the throne of the pharaohs by coordinating a series of strategic uprisings in the margins of the Egyptian empire and a rebellion of Hebrew migrant workers. As the rebellion foils the workers start seeking their own land and sovereignty.\n\nThe fourth book in von Spaeth’s Moses-series deals with relations between ancient Egyptian mystery cults and early Hebrew spiritual traditions. The book suggest that of the cults were politically active and intervening in specific historical events of the ancient world leading to cultural consequences for the western world.\n\nThe final book in the series suggests that Moses skills derived from his legacy as a prince helped him unify the Israelite people by providing them with philosophy, political science, mathematics, and the development of a written system of language with its own alphabet enabling a formation of the biblical texts.\n"}

This definition may be distinguished from the legal notion of testimony in that the speaker does not have to make a declaration of the truth of the facts.\n\nThe role of testimony in acquiring belief and knowledge has been a relatively neglected philosophical issue. CAJ (Tony) Coady believes that this is because traditional epistemology has had a distinctly individualist flavour.\n\nHowever, it seems that many of the beliefs that we hold have been gained through accepting testimony. For example, one may only know that Kent is a county of England or that David Beckham earns $30 million per year because one has learned these things from other people. A more striking example is the belief about one's own birthdate. If you know your birthdate, the evidence for your belief was almost certainly received through testimony.\n\nOne of the problems with acquiring knowledge through testimony is that it does not seem to live up to the standards of knowledge (see knowledge in philosophy ). As Owens notes, it does not seem to live up to the Enlightenment ideal of rationality captured in the motto of the Royal Society – ‘Nullius in verba (no man's word)’. Crudely put, the question is: 'How can testimony give us knowledge when we have no reasons of our own?'\n\nCoady suggests that there are two approaches to this problem:\nand\n\nHume is one of the few early philosophers to offer anything like a sustained account of testimony, this can be found in his \"‘An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding’\" in the section on miracles. The basic idea is that our justification for believing what people tell us comes from our experience of the ‘...constant and regular conjunction’ between the state of affairs as people describe it and the actual state of affairs (i.e. our observation that they match). On Coady's schema he is a reductivist.\n\nCoady offers an anti-reductivist account of testimony. He claims that testimony is like perception, we don't have to have reasons for believing it, only an absence of reasons not to believe it. On Coady's account we are justified in being credulous. Proponents of anti-reductivism in the history of philosophy include Augustine of Hippo and Thomas Reid.\n\nPerhaps also significant is that Bertrand Russell argued that knowledge by acquaintance played an important part in epistemology.\n\n1.

In his philosophy, described in the \"Enneads\", there are three principles: the One, the Intellect, and the Soul. His teacher was Ammonius Saccas and he is of the Platonic tradition. Historians of the 19th century invented the term Neoplatonism and applied it to him and his philosophy which was influential in Late Antiquity. Much of the biographical information about Plotinus comes from Porphyry's preface to his edition of Plotinus' \"Enneads\". His metaphysical writings have inspired centuries of Pagan, Islamic, Jewish, Christian, and Gnostic metaphysicians and mystics.\n\nPorphyry reported that Plotinus was 66 years old when he died in 270, the second year of the reign of the emperor Claudius II, thus giving us the year of his teacher's birth as around 205. Eunapius reported that Plotinus was born in the Deltaic Lycopolis in Egypt, which has led to speculations that he may have been a native Egyptian of Roman, Greek, or Hellenized Egyptian descent.\n\nPlotinus had an inherent distrust of materiality (an attitude common to Platonism), holding to the view that phenomena were a poor image or mimicry (mimesis) of something \"higher and intelligible\" (VI.I) which was the \"truer part of genuine Being\". This distrust extended to the body, including his own; it is reported by Porphyry that at one point he refused to have his portrait painted, presumably for much the same reasons of dislike. Likewise Plotinus never discussed his ancestry, childhood, or his place or date of birth. From all accounts his personal and social life exhibited the highest moral and spiritual standards.\n\nPlotinus took up the study of philosophy at the age of twenty-seven, around the year 232, and travelled to Alexandria to study. There he was dissatisfied with every teacher he encountered until an acquaintance suggested he listen to the ideas of Ammonius Saccas. Upon hearing Ammonius lecture, he declared to his friend, \"this was the man I was looking for,\" and began to study intently under his new instructor. Besides Ammonius, Plotinus was also influenced by the works of Alexander of Aphrodisias, Numenius, and various Stoics.\n\nAfter spending the next eleven years in Alexandria, he then decided, at the age of around 38, to investigate the philosophical teachings of the Persian philosophers and the Indian philosophers. In the pursuit of this endeavor he left Alexandria and joined the army of Gordian III as it marched on Persia. However, the campaign was a failure, and on Gordian's eventual death Plotinus found himself abandoned in a hostile land, and only with difficulty found his way back to safety in Antioch.\n\nAt the age of forty, during the reign of Philip the Arab, he came to Rome, where he stayed for most of the remainder of his life. There he attracted a number of students. His innermost circle included Porphyry, Amelius Gentilianus of Tuscany, the Senator Castricius Firmus, and Eustochius of Alexandria, a doctor who devoted himself to learning from Plotinus and attending to him until his death. Other students included: Zethos, an Arab by ancestry who died before Plotinus, leaving him a legacy and some land; Zoticus, a critic and poet; Paulinus, a doctor of Scythopolis; and Serapion from Alexandria. He had students amongst the Roman Senate beside Castricius, such as Marcellus Orontius, Sabinillus, and Rogantianus. Women were also numbered amongst his students, including Gemina, in whose house he lived during his residence in Rome, and her daughter, also Gemina; and Amphiclea, the wife of Ariston the son of Iamblichus. Finally, Plotinus was a correspondent of the philosopher Cassius Longinus.\n\nWhile in Rome Plotinus also gained the respect of the Emperor Gallienus and his wife Salonina. At one point Plotinus attempted to interest Gallienus in rebuilding an abandoned settlement in Campania, known as the 'City of Philosophers', where the inhabitants would live under the constitution set out in Plato's \"Laws\". An Imperial subsidy was never granted, for reasons unknown to Porphyry, who reports the incident.\n\nPorphyry subsequently went to live in Sicily, where word reached him that his former teacher had died. The philosopher spent his final days in seclusion on an estate in Campania which his friend Zethos had bequeathed him. According to the account of Eustochius, who attended him at the end, Plotinus' final words were: \"Try to raise the divine in yourselves to the divine in the all.\" Eustochius records that a snake crept under the bed where Plotinus lay, and slipped away through a hole in the wall; at the same moment the philosopher died.\n\nPlotinus wrote the essays that became the \"Enneads\" over a period of several years from \"ca.\" 253 until a few months before his death seventeen years later. Porphyry makes note that the \"Enneads\", before being compiled and arranged by himself, were merely the enormous collection of notes and essays which Plotinus used in his lectures and debates, rather than a formal book. Plotinus was unable to revise his own work due to his poor eyesight, yet his writings required extensive editing, according to Porphyry: his master's handwriting was atrocious, he did not properly separate his words, and he cared little for niceties of spelling. Plotinus intensely disliked the editorial process, and turned the task to Porphyry, who not only polished them but put them into the arrangement we now have.\n\nPlotinus taught that there is a supreme, totally transcendent \"One\", containing no division, multiplicity, or distinction; beyond all categories of being and non-being. His \"One\" \"cannot be any existing thing\", nor is it merely the sum of all things (compare the Stoic doctrine of disbelief in non-material existence), but \"is prior to all existents\". Plotinus identified his \"One\" with the concept of 'Good' and the principle of 'Beauty'. (I.6.9)\n\nHis \"One\" concept encompassed thinker and object. Even the self-contemplating intelligence (the noesis of the nous) must contain duality. \"Once you have uttered 'The Good,' add no further thought: by any addition, and in proportion to that addition, you introduce a deficiency.\" (III.8.11) Plotinus denies sentience, self-awareness or any other action (\"ergon\") to the One (τὸ Ἕν, \"to En\"; V.6.6). Rather, if we insist on describing it further, we must call the One a sheer potentiality (\"dynamis\") or without which nothing could exist. (III.8.10) As Plotinus explains in both places and elsewhere (e.g. V.6.3), it is impossible for the One to be Being or a self-aware Creator God. At (V.6.4), Plotinus compared the One to \"light\", the Divine Intellect/Nous (Νοῦς, \"Nous\"; first will towards Good) to the \"Sun\", and lastly the Soul (Ψυχή, \"Psyche\") to the \"Moon\" whose light is merely a \"derivative conglomeration of light from the 'Sun'\". The first light could exist without any celestial body.\n\nThe One, being beyond all attributes including being and non-being, is the source of the world—but not through any act of creation, willful or otherwise, since activity cannot be ascribed to the unchangeable, immutable One. Plotinus argues instead that the multiple cannot exist without the simple. The \"less perfect\" must, of necessity, \"emanate\", or issue forth, from the \"perfect\" or \"more perfect\". Thus, all of \"creation\" emanates from the One in succeeding stages of lesser and lesser perfection. These stages are not temporally isolated, but occur throughout time as a constant process.\n\nThe One is not just an intellectual concept but something that can be experienced, an experience where one goes beyond all multiplicity. Plotinus writes, \"We ought not even to say that he will \"see\", but he will \"be\" that which he sees, if indeed it is possible any longer to distinguish between seer and seen, and not boldly to affirm that the two are one.\"\n\nSuperficially considered, Plotinus seems to offer an alternative to the orthodox Christian notion of creation \"ex nihilo\" (out of nothing), although Plotinus never mentions Christianity in any of his works. The metaphysics of emanation (ἀπορροή \"aporrhoe\" (ΙΙ.3.2) or ἀπόρροια \"aporrhoia\" (II.3.11)), however, just like the metaphysics of Creation, confirms the absolute transcendence of the One or of the Divine, as the source of the Being of all things that yet remains transcendent of them in its own nature; the One is in no way affected or diminished by these emanations, just as the Christian God in no way is affected by some sort of exterior \"nothingness\". Plotinus, using a venerable analogy that would become crucial for the (largely Neoplatonic) metaphysics of developed Christian thought, likens the One to the Sun which emanates light indiscriminately without thereby diminishing itself, or reflection in a mirror which in no way diminishes or otherwise alters the object being reflected.\n\nThe first emanation is \"Nous\" (Divine Mind, \"Logos\", Order, Thought, Reason), identified metaphorically with the Demiurge in Plato's \"Timaeus\". It is the first Will toward Good. From \"Nous\" proceeds the World Soul, which Plotinus subdivides into upper and lower, identifying the lower aspect of Soul with nature. From the world soul proceeds individual human souls, and finally, matter, at the lowest level of being and thus the least perfected level of the cosmos. Despite this relatively pedestrian assessment of the material world, Plotinus asserted the ultimately divine nature of material creation since it ultimately derives from the One, through the mediums of \"Nous\" and the world soul. It is by the Good or through beauty that we recognize the One, in material things and then in the Forms. (I.6.6 and I.6.9)\n\nThe essentially devotional nature of Plotinus' philosophy may be further illustrated by his concept of attaining ecstatic union with the One (\"henosis\"). Porphyry relates that Plotinus attained such a union four times during the years he knew him. This may be related to enlightenment, liberation, and other concepts of mystical union common to many Eastern and Western traditions.\n\nAuthentic human happiness for Plotinus consists of the true human identifying with that which is the best in the universe. Because happiness is beyond anything physical, Plotinus stresses the point that worldly fortune does not control true human happiness, and thus “… there exists no single human being that does not either potentially or effectively possess this thing we hold to constitute happiness.” (Enneads I.4.4) The issue of happiness is one of Plotinus’ greatest imprints on Western thought, as he is one of the first to introduce the idea that eudaimonia (happiness) is attainable only within consciousness.\n\nThe true human is an incorporeal contemplative capacity of the soul, and superior to all things corporeal. It then follows that real human happiness is independent of the physical world. Real happiness is, instead, dependent on the metaphysical and authentic human being found in this highest capacity of Reason. “For man, and especially the Proficient, is not the Couplement of Soul and body: the proof is that man can be disengaged from the body and disdain its nominal goods.” (Enneads I.4.14) The human who has achieved happiness will not be bothered by sickness, discomfort, etc., as his focus is on the greatest things. Authentic human happiness is the utilization of the most authentically human capacity of contemplation. Even in daily, physical action, the flourishing human’s “…Act is determined by the higher phase of the Soul.” (Enneads III.4.6) Even in the most dramatic arguments Plotinus considers (if the Proficient is subject to extreme physical torture, for example), he concludes this only strengthens his claim of true happiness being metaphysical, as the truly happy human being would understand that which is being tortured is merely a body, not the conscious self, and happiness could persist.\n\nPlotinus offers a comprehensive description of his conception of a person who has achieved eudaimonia. “The perfect life” involves a man who commands reason and contemplation. (Enneads I.4.4) A happy person will not sway between happy and sad, as many of Plotinus' contemporaries believed. Stoics, for example, question the ability of someone to be happy (presupposing happiness is contemplation) if they are mentally incapacitated or even asleep. Plotinus disregards this claim, as the soul and true human do not sleep or even exist in time, nor will a living human who has achieved eudaimonia suddenly stop using its greatest, most authentic capacity just because of the body’s discomfort in the physical realm. “…The Proficient’s will is set always and only inward.” (Enneads I.4.11)\n\nOverall, happiness for Plotinus is \"...a flight from this world's ways and things.\" (Theaet. 176) and a focus on the highest, i.e. Forms and the One.\n\nHenosis is the word for mystical \"oneness\", \"union\", or \"unity\" in classical Greek. In Platonism, and especially Neoplatonism, the goal of henosis is union with what is fundamental in reality: the One (Τὸ Ἕν), the Source, or Monad.\n\nAs is specified in the writings of Plotinus on henology, one can reach a state of tabula rasa, a blank state where the individual may grasp or merge with The One. This absolute simplicity means that the nous or the person is then dissolved, completely absorbed back into the Monad. Here within the \"Enneads\" of Plotinus the Monad can be referred to as the Good above the demiurge. The Monad or dunamis (force) is of one singular expression (the will or the one is the good) all is contained in the Monad and the Monad is all (pantheism). All division is reconciled in the one, the final stage before reaching singularity, called duality (dyad), is completely reconciled in the Monad, Source or One (see monism). As the one, source or substance of all things the Monad is all encompassing. As infinite and indeterminate all is reconciled in the dunamis or one. It is the demiurge or second emanation that is the nous in Plotinus. It is the demiurge (creator, action, energy) or nous that \"perceives\" and therefore causes the force (potential or One) to manifest as energy, or the dyad called the material world. Nous as being, being and perception (intellect) manifest what is called soul (World Soul).\n\nHenosis for Plotinus was defined in his works as a reversing of the ontological process of consciousness via meditation (in the Western mind to uncontemplate) toward no thought (Nous or demiurge) and no division (dyad) within the individual (being). Plotinus words his teachings to reconcile not only Plato with Aristotle but also various World religions that he had personal contact with during his various travels. Plotinus' works have an ascetic character in that they reject matter as an illusion (non-existent). Matter was strictly treated as immanent, with matter as essential to its being, having no true or transcendential character or essence, substance or ousia. This approach is called philosophical Idealism.\n\nFor several centuries after the Protestant Reformation, Neo-Platonism was condemned as a decadent and 'oriental' distortion of Platonism. In a famous 1929 essay, E. R. Dodds showed that key conceptions of Neo-Platonism could be traced from their origin in Plato's dialogues, through his immediate followers (e.g., Speusippus) and the Neo-Pythagoreans, to Plotinus and the Neo-Platonists. Thus Plotinus' philosophy was, he argued, 'not the starting-point of Neo-Platonism but its intellectual culmination.' Further research reinforced this view and by 1954 Merlan could say 'The present tendency is toward bridging rather than widening the gap separating Platonism from Neo-Platonism.'\n\nSince the 1950s, the Tübingen School of Plato interpretation has argued that the so-called 'unwritten doctrines' of Plato debated by Aristotle and the Early Academy strongly resemble Plotinus's metaphysics. In this case, the Neo-Platonic reading of Plato would be, at least in this central area, historically justified. This implies that Neo-Platonism is less of an innovation than it appears without the recognition of Plato's unwritten doctrines. Advocates of the Tübingen School emphasize this advantage of their interpretation. They see Plotinus as advancing a tradition of thought begun by Plato himself. Plotinus's metaphysics, at least in broad outline, was therefore already familiar to the first generation of Plato's students. This confirms Plotinus' own view, for he considered himself not the inventor of a system but the faithful interpreter of Plato's doctrines.\n\nAt least two modern conferences within Hellenic philosophy fields of study have been held in order to address what Plotinus stated in his tract \"Against the Gnostics\" and to whom he was addressing it, in order to separate and clarify the events and persons involved in the origin of the term \"Gnostic\". From the dialogue, it appears that the word had an origin in the Platonic and Hellenistic tradition long before the group calling themselves \"Gnostics\"—or the group covered under the modern term \"Gnosticism\"—ever appeared. It would seem that this shift from Platonic to Gnostic usage has led many people to confusion. The strategy of sectarians taking Greek terms from philosophical contexts and re-applying them to religious contexts was popular in Christianity, the Cult of Isis and other ancient religious contexts including Hermetic ones (see Alexander of Abonutichus for an example).\n\nPlotinus and the Neoplatonists viewed Gnosticism as a form of heresy or sectarianism to the Pythagorean and Platonic philosophy of the Mediterranean and Middle East. He accused them of using senseless jargon and being overly dramatic and insolent in their distortion of Plato's ontology.\"\nPlotinus attacks his opponents as untraditional, irrational and immoral and arrogant. He also attacks them as elitist and blasphemous to Plato for the Gnostics despising the material world and its maker.\n\nThe Neoplatonic movement (though Plotinus would have simply referred to himself as a philosopher of Plato) seems to be motivated by the desire of Plotinus to revive the pagan philosophical tradition. Plotinus was not claiming to innovate with the \"Enneads\", but to clarify aspects of the works of Plato that he considered misrepresented or misunderstood. Plotinus does not claim to be an innovator, but rather a communicator of a tradition. Plotinus referred to tradition as a way to interpret Plato's intentions. Because the teachings of Plato were for members of the academy rather than the general public, it was easy for outsiders to misunderstand Plato's meaning. However, Plotinus attempted to clarify how the philosophers of the academy had not arrived at the same conclusions (such as misotheism or dystheism of the creator God as an answer to the problem of evil) as the targets of his criticism.\n\nPlotinus seems to be one of the first to argue against the still popular notion of causal astrology. In the late tractate 2.3, \"Are the stars causes?\", Plotinus makes the argument that specific stars influencing one's fortune (a common Hellenistic theme) attributes irrationality to a perfect universe, and invites moral depravity. He does, however, claim the stars and planets are ensouled, as witnessed by their movement.\n\nThe emperor Julian the Apostate was deeply influenced by Neoplatonism, as was Hypatia of Alexandria. Neoplatonism influenced many Christians as well, including Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite. St. Augustine, though often referred to as a \"Platonist,\" acquired his Platonist philosophy through the mediation of the Neoplatonist teachings of Plotinus.\n\nPlotinus' philosophy had an influence on the development of Christian theology. In \"A History of Western Philosophy\", philosopher Bertrand Russell wrote that:\nThe Eastern Orthodox position on \"energy,\" for example, is often contrasted with the position of the Roman Catholic Church, and in part this is attributed to varying interpretations of Aristotle and Plotinus, either through Thomas Aquinas for the Roman Catholics or Gregory of Nyssa for the Orthodox Christians.\n\nNeoplatonism and the ideas of Plotinus influenced medieval Islam as well, since the Sunni Abbasids fused Greek concepts into sponsored state texts, and found great influence amongst the Ismaili Shia. Persian philosophers as well, such as Muhammad al-Nasafi and Abu Yaqub Sijistani. By the 11th century, Neoplatonism was adopted by the Fatimid state of Egypt, and taught by their da'i. Neoplatonism was brought to the Fatimid court by Hamid al-Din al-Kirmani, although his teachings differed from Nasafi and Sijistani, who were more aligned with original teachings of Plotinus. The teachings of Kirmani in turn influenced philosophers such as Nasir Khusraw of Persia.\n\nAs with Islam and Christianity, Neoplatonism in general and Plotinus in particular influenced speculative thought. Notable thinkers expressing Neoplatonic themese are Solomon ibn Gabirol (Latin: Avicebron) and Moses ben Maimon (Latin: Maimonides). As with Islam and Christianity, apophatic theology and the privative nature of evil are two prominent themes that such thinkers picked up from either Plotinus or his successors.\n\nIn the Renaissance the philosopher Marsilio Ficino set up an Academy under the patronage of Cosimo de Medici in Florence, mirroring that of Plato. His work was of great importance in reconciling the philosophy of Plato directly with Christianity. One of his most distinguished pupils was Pico della Mirandola, author of \"An Oration On the Dignity of Man\".\n\nIn England, Plotinus was the cardinal influence on the 17th-century school of the Cambridge Platonists, and on numerous writers from Samuel Taylor Coleridge to W. B. Yeats and Kathleen Raine.\n\nSarvepalli Radhakrishnan and Ananda Coomaraswamy used the writing of Plotinus in their own texts as a superlative elaboration upon Indian monism, specifically Upanishadic and Advaita Vedantic thought. Coomaraswamy has compared Plotinus' teachings to the Hindu school of Advaita Vedanta (\"advaita\" meaning \"not two\" or \"non-dual\").\n\nAdvaita Vedanta and Neoplatonism have been compared by J. F. Staal, Frederick Copleston, Aldo Magris and Mario Piantelli, Radhakrishnan, Gwen Griffith-Dickson, and John Y. Fenton.\n\nThe joint influence of Advaitin and Neoplatonic ideas on Ralph Waldo Emerson was considered by Dale Riepe in 1967.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "42598658", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42598658", "title": "Problem of time", "text": "Problem of time\n\nIn theoretical physics, the problem of time is a conceptual conflict between general relativity and quantum mechanics in that quantum mechanics regards the flow of time as universal and absolute, whereas general relativity regards the flow of time as malleable and relative. This problem raises the question of what time really is in a physical sense and whether it is truly a real, distinct phenomenon. It also involves the related question of why time seems to flow in a single direction, despite the fact that no known physical laws seem to require a single direction.\n\nIn classical mechanics, a special status is assigned to time in the sense that it is treated as a classical background parameter, external to the system itself. This special role is seen in the standard formulation of quantum mechanics. It is regarded as part of an a priori given classical background with a well defined value. In fact, the classical treatment of time is deeply intertwined with the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, and, thus, with the conceptual foundations of quantum theory: all measurements of observables are made at certain instants of time and probabilities are only assigned to such measurements.\n\nSpecial relativity has modified the notion of time. But from a fixed Lorentz observer's viewpoint time remains a distinguished, absolute, external, global parameter. The Newtonian notion of time essentially carries over to special relativistic systems, hidden in the spacetime structure.\n\nThough classically spacetime appears to be an absolute background, general relativity reveals that spacetime is actually dynamical; gravity is a manifestation of spacetime geometry. Matter reacts with spacetime: \n\nAlso, spacetime can interact with itself (e.g. gravitational waves). The dynamical nature of spacetime has a vast array of consequences.\nThe dynamical nature of spacetime, via the hole argument, implies that the theory is diffeomorphism invariant. The constraints are the imprint in the canonical theory of the diffeomorphism invariance of the four-dimensional theory. They also contain the dynamics of the theory, since the Hamiltonian identically vanishes. The quantum theory has no explicit dynamics; wavefunctions are annihilated by the constraints and Dirac observables commute with the constraints and hence are constants of motion. Kuchar introduces the idea of \"perennials\" and Rovelli the idea of \"partial observables\". The expectation is that in physical situations some of the variables of the theory will play the role of a \"time\" with respect to which other variables would evolve and define dynamics in a relational way. This runs into difficulties and is a version of the \"problem of time\" in the canonical quantization.\n\nThe quantum concept of time was invented by physicist Bryce DeWitt in 1960's:\n\n\"Different times are special cases of different universes\"\n\nIn other words, time is an entanglement phenomenon, which places all equal clock readings (of correctly prepared clocks - or of any objects usable as clocks) into the same history. This was first understood by physicist Don Page and William Wootters in 1983. They made a proposal to address the problem of time in systems like general relativity called conditional probabilities interpretation. It consists in promoting all variables to quantum operators, one of them as a clock, and asking conditional probability questions with respect to other variables. They made a solution based on the quantum phenomenon of entanglement. Page and Wootters showed how quantum entanglement can be used to measure time.\n\nIn 2013, at the Istituto Nazionale di Ricerca Metrologica (INRIM) in Turin, Italy, Ekaterina Moreva, together with Giorgio Brida, Marco Gramegna, Vittorio Giovannetti, Lorenzo Maccone, and Marco Genovese performed the first experimental test of Page and Wootters' ideas. They confirmed that time is an emergent phenomenon for internal observers but absent for external observers of the universe just as the Wheeler-DeWitt equation predicts.\n\nConsistent discretizations approach developed by Jorge Pullin and Rodolfo Gambini have no constraints. These are lattice approximation techniques for quantum gravity. In the canonical approach if one discretizes the constraints and equations of motion, the resulting discrete equations are inconsistent: they cannot be solved simultaneously. To address this problem one uses a technique based on discretizing the action of the theory and working with the discrete equations of motion. These are automatically guaranteed to be consistent. Most of the hard conceptual questions of quantum gravity are related to the presence of constraints in the theory. Consistent discretized theories are free of these conceptual problems and can be straightforwardly quantized, providing a solution to the problem of time. It is a bit more subtle than this. Although without constraints and having \"general evolution\", the latter is only in terms of a discrete parameter that isn't physically accessible. The way out is addressed in a way similar to the Page–Wooters approach. The idea is to pick one of the physical variables to be a clock and asks relational questions. These ideas where the clock is also quantum mechanical have actually led to a new interpretation of quantum mechanics — the Montevideo interpretation of quantum mechanics. This new interpretation solves the problems of the use of environmental decoherence as a solution to the problem of measurement in quantum mechanics by invoking fundamental limitations, due to the quantum mechanical nature of clocks, in the process of measurement in quantum mechanics. These limitations are very natural in the context of generally covariant theories as quantum gravity where the clock must be taken as one of the degrees of freedom of the system itself. They have also put forward this fundamental decoherence as a way to resolve the black hole information paradox. In certain circumstances, a matter field is used to de-parametrize the theory and introduce a physical Hamiltonian. This generates physical time evolution, not a constraint.\n\nReduced phase space quantization constraints are solved first then quantized. This approach was considered for some time to be impossible as it seems to require first finding the general solution to Einstein's equations. However, with use of ideas involved in Dittrich's approximation scheme (built on ideas of Rovelli) a way to explicitly implement, at least in principle, a reduced phase space quantization was made viable.\n\nGenerally covariant theories do not have a notion of a distinguished physical time with respect to which everything evolves. However, it is not needed for the full formulation and interpretation of the theory. The dynamical laws are determined by correlations which are sufficient to make predictions. But then a mechanism is needed which explains how the familiar notion of time eventually emerges from the timeless structure to become such an important ingredient of the macroscopic world we live in as well as of our conscious experience.\n\nA possible solution to this problem has been put forward by Carlo Rovelli and Alain Connes, both in the classical and quantum theory, and goes by the name of the thermal time hypothesis. It postulates that physical time flow is not an a priori given fundamental property of the theory, but is a macroscopic feature of thermodynamical origin.\n\n"}
{"id": "145880", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=145880", "title": "Psychoanalytic theory", "text": "Psychoanalytic theory\n\nPsychoanalytic theory is the theory of personality organization and the dynamics of personality development that guides psychoanalysis, a clinical method for treating psychopathology. First laid out by Sigmund Freud in the late 19th century, psychoanalytic theory has undergone many refinements since his work. Psychoanalytic theory came to full prominence in the last third of the twentieth century as part of the flow of critical discourse regarding psychological treatments after the 1960s, long after Freud's death in 1939, and its validity is now widely disputed or rejected. Freud had ceased his analysis of the brain and his physiological studies and shifted his focus to the study of the mind and the related psychological attributes making up the mind, and on treatment using free association and the phenomena of transference. His study emphasized the recognition of childhood events that could influence the mental functioning of adults. His examination of the genetic and then the developmental aspects gave the psychoanalytic theory its characteristics. Starting with his publication of \"The Interpretation of Dreams\" in 1899, his theories began to gain prominence.\n\nPsychoanalytic and psychoanalytical are used in English. The latter is the older term, and at first simply meant 'relating to the analysis of the human psyche'. But with the emergence of psychoanalysis as a distinct clinical practice, both terms came to describe that. Although both are still used, today, the normal adjective is psychoanalytic.\n\nPsychoanalysis is defined in the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" as\nA therapeutic method, originated by Sigmund Freud, for treating mental disorders by investigating the interaction of conscious and unconscious elements in the patient's mind and bringing repressed fears and conflicts into the conscious mind, using techniques such as dream interpretation and free association. Also: a system of psychological theory associated with this method.\nThrough the scope of a psychoanalytic lens, humans are described as having sexual and aggressive drives. Psychoanalytic theorists believe that human behavior is deterministic. It is governed by irrational forces, and the unconscious, as well as instinctual and biological drives. Due to this deterministic nature, psychoanalytic theorists do not believe in free will.\n\nFreud first began his studies on psychoanalysis in collaboration with Dr. Josef Breuer, especially when it came to the study on Anna O. The relationship between Freud and Breuer was a mix of admiration and competition, based on the fact that they were working together on the Anna O. case and had to balance two different ideas as to her diagnosis and treatment. Today, Breuer can be considered the grandfather of psychoanalysis. Anna O. was subject to both physical and psychological disturbances, such as not being able to drink out of fear. Breuer and Freud both found that hypnosis was a great help in discovering more about Anna O. and her treatment. The research and ideas behind the study on Anna O. were highly referenced in Freud's lectures on the origin and development of psychoanalysis.\n\nThese observations led Freud to theorize that the problems faced by hysterical patients could be associated with painful childhood experiences that could not be recalled. The influence of these lost memories shaped the feelings, thoughts and behaviours of patients. These studies contributed to the development of the psychoanalytic theory.\n\nSigmund Freud determined that the personality consists of three different elements, the id, the ego and the superego. The id is the aspect of personality that is driven by internal and basic drives and needs. These are typically instinctual, such as hunger, thirst, and the drive for sex, or libido. The id acts in accordance with the pleasure principle, in that it avoids pain and seeks pleasure. Due to the instinctual quality of the id, it is impulsive and often unaware of implications of actions. The ego is driven by the reality principle. The ego works to balance the id and superego, by trying to achieve the id's drive in the most realistic ways. It seeks to rationalize the id's instinct and please the drives that benefit the individual in the long term. It helps separate what is real, and realistic of our drives as well as being realistic about the standards that the superego sets for the individual. The superego is driven by the morality principle. It acts in connection with the morality of higher thought and action. Instead of instinctively acting like the id, the superego works to act in socially acceptable ways. It employs morality, judging our sense of wrong and right and using guilt to encourage socially acceptable behavior.\n\nThe unconscious is the portion of the mind of which a person is not aware. Freud said that it is the unconscious that exposes the true feelings, emotions, and thoughts of the individual. There are variety of psychoanalytic techniques used to access and understand the unconscious, ranging from methods like hypnosis, free association, and dream analysis. Dreams allow us to explore the unconscious; according to Freud, they are \"the 'royal road' to the unconscious\". Dreams are composed of latent and manifest content. Whereas latent content is the underlying meaning of a dream that may not be remembered when a person wakes up, manifest content is the content from the dream that a person remembers upon waking and can be analyzed by a psychoanalytic psychologist. Exploring and understanding the manifest content of dreams can inform the individual of complexes or disorders that may be under the surface of their personality. Dreams can provide access to the unconscious that is not easily accessible.\n\nFreudian slips (also known as parapraxes) occur when the ego and superego do not work properly, exposing the id and internal drives or wants. They are considered mistakes revealing the unconscious. Examples range from calling someone by the wrong name, misinterpreting a spoken or written word, or simply saying the wrong thing.\n\nThe ego balances the id, superego, and reality to maintain a healthy state of consciousness. It thus reacts to protect the individual from any stressors and anxiety by distorting reality. This prevents threatening unconscious thoughts and material from entering the consciousness. The different types of defense mechanisms are: Repression, reaction formation, denial, projection, displacement, sublimation, regression, and rationalization.\n\nFreud's take on the development of the personality (psyche). It is a stage theory that believes progress occurs through stages as the libido is directed to different body parts. The different stages, listed in order of progression, are: Oral, Anal, Phallic (Oedipus complex), Latency, Genital. The Genital stage is achieved if people meet all their needs throughout the other stages with enough available sexual energy. Individuals who don't have their needs met in a given stage become fixated, or \"stuck\" in that stage.\n\nFreud's theory and work with psychosexual development lead to Neo-Analytic/ Neo-Freudians who also believed in the importance of the unconscious, dream interpretations, defense mechanisms and the integral influence of childhood experiences but had objections to the theory as well. They do not support the idea that development of the personality stops at age 6, instead they believed development spreads across the lifespan. They extended Freud's work and encompassed more influence from the environment and the importance of conscious thought along with the unconscious. The most important theorists are Erik Erikson (Psychosocial Development), Anna Freud, Carl Jung, Alfred Adler and Karen Horney, and including the school of object relations.\n\nThe psychoanalytic approach has a variety of advantages and limitations that have spurred further research and expansion into the realm of personality development.\n\n\n\nPsychoanalytic theory is a major influence in Continental philosophy and in aesthetics in particular. Freud is considered a philosopher in some areas, and other philosophers, such as Jacques Lacan, Michel Foucault, and Jacques Derrida have written extensively on how psychoanalysis informs philosophical analysis.\n\nWhen analysing literary texts, the psychoanalytic theory could be utilized to decipher or interpret the concealed meaning within a text, or to better understand the author's intentions. Through the analysis of motives, Freud's theory can be used to help clarify the meaning of the writing as well as the actions of the characters within the text.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Confucius was asked what he would do if he was a governor. He said he would \"rectify the names\" to make words correspond to reality. The phrase has now become known as a doctrine of feudal Confucian designations and relationships, behaving accordingly to ensure social harmony. Without such accordance society would essentially crumble and \"undertakings would not be completed.\" Mencius extended the doctrine to include questions of political legitimacy.\n\nBecause the rectification of names in the Analects of Confucius appears to have been written later, it arguably originates in Mozi (470–391 BC). The scholarship of Herrlee G. Creel argued for its further development through \"Legalist\" Shen Buhai (400–337 BC) before the Confucian usage for the same reasons. However, professor Zhenbhin Sun considers Mozi's rectification consonant with the Confucian usage; Mozi considered it an important factor in the resolution of sociopolitical issues, and not simply legal affairs.\n\nThe Mohist and \"Legalistic\" version of the rectification of names is Fa. Mozi advocated language standards appropriate for use by ordinary people. With minimal training, anyone can use Fa to perform a task or check results. Seemingly originating in Guan Zhong, for Guan Zhong and the Mohists, Fa recommended objective, reliable, easily used, publicly accessible standards, or models, opposing what Sinologist Chad Hansen terms the \"cultivated intuition of self-admiration societies\", expert at chanting old texts. However, it could complement any traditional scheme, and Guan Zhong uses Fa alongside the Confucian Li. What Fa made possible was the accurate following of instructions. For the most part Confucianism does not elaborate on Fa, though the idea of norms themselves are older and Han Confucians embraced Fa as an essential element in administration.\n\nRejecting the Confucian idea of parents as a moral model as particular and unreliable, the driving idea of the Mohists was the use of Hermeneutics to find objective models (Fa) for ethics and politics, as was done in any practical field, to order or govern society. These were primarily practical rather than principles or rules, as in the square and plumb-line. The Mohists used Fa as \"objective, particularly operational or measurement-like standards for fixing the referents of names\", hoping that the natural standards (Fa) of language (names) would yield some objective way (dao) of moral reform.\n\nMeasuring to obtain a clear standard, Fa compares something against itself, and then judges whether the two are similar, just as with the use of the compass or the L-square. This constituted the basic conception of Mohists practical reasoning and knowledge. What matches the standard is the particular object, and thus correct; what doesn't is not. Knowledge is a matter of \"being able to do something correctly in practice\" — and in particular, being able to distinguish various kinds of things from one another. Evaluating correctness is thus determining whether distinctions have been drawn properly. Its aim is not an intellectual grasp of a definition or principle, but the practical ability to perform a task (dao) successfully. Fixing the content given moral model, they proposed emulation for the establishment of order.\n\nEvolving out of the Mohists and school of logicians, reformer Shen Buhai insisted that the ruler must be fully informed on the state of his realm, using Fa as administrative method to sort out informational categories or define functions (\"names\"). Shen Buhai and later Han Fei (280–233 BC) used this variation on the rectification of names for appointment, matching the words of the official, or his name/title/legal contract, with his performance. Han Fei bases his propositions for lingual uniformity upon the development of this system, proposing that functions could be strictly defined to prevent conflict and corruption, and objective rules (Fa) impervious to divergent interpretation could be established, judged solely by their effectiveness.\n\nBy contrast, the \"Zhuangzi\" says that \"great words are overflowing; small words haggling\"(2.2), the true self lacks form(2.3), the mind can spontaneously select (2.4), asks whether language is different from the chirping of birds(2.5), and rejects assertion and denial(2.7), saying \"to wear out one's spirit like powers contriving some view... without understanding that it is all the same is called 'three in the morning.\n\nThe \"Analects\" states that social disorder often stems from failure to call things by their proper names, that is, to perceive, understand, and deal with reality. His solution to this was the \"rectification of names\". He gave an explanation to one of his disciples:\nThe teaching of Confucius consist of five basic relationships in life:\n\nIn the above relationships, Confucius teaches that righteous, considerate, kind, benevolent, and gentle treatment should be applied by the former to the latter. And that with the application of such practices in day-to-day life, societal problems would be solved and righteous government would be achieved. The carrying out of these relational duties would equate the proper channeling of li and the correct use of zhèngmíng congruent to Confucius' teachings leading to the envisioned path of his doctrine; a moral and efficient society and individuals who have achieved the ascension to superior human beings through the principles of li and jen. The proper operation of oneself ultimately depends on the role of zhèngmíng; essentially a circle of dependency in terms of the practice and application of principles and ways.\n\nIn Confucianism, the Rectification of Names means that \"things in actual fact should be made to accord with the implications attached to them by names, the prerequisites for correct living and even efficient government being that all classes of society should accord to what they ought to be\". Without the rectification of names, different words would have different actions. This essentially means for every action, there is a word that describes that action. The belief is that by following the Rectification of Names, one would be following the correct/right path. The rectification of names also calls for a standard language in which ancient rulers could impose laws that everyone could understand to avoid confusion.\n\nEach person has a social standing and a social name. With their social names comes responsibilities and duties. Ruler, minister, father and son all have social names therefore need to fulfill their required social duties of respect (The rectification of names). For example, in the study of Chinese culture a child only speaks when a parent permits them to speak.\nFollowing orders from a person of authority means that you are showing respect, therefore that you are following the Rectification of Names without explicitly acknowledging it. Confucius' belief in the Rectification of Names is still practiced in today's society, for example when a teacher asks a student to address a visitor, that student will follow the instructions.\n\nA broader example, the only way to be a true/real ruler even in name is by following \"the way of the ruler\"(The rectification of names).\n\nXun Zi wrote a chapter on \"The Rectification of Names\" developing a theme that had been introduced by Confucius saying: \"Let the ruler be ruler, the subject subject; let the father be father, and the son son.\" Chapter 22, \"on the Rectification of Names\", claims the ancient sage kings chose names (Chinese:名, Pinyin:míng) that directly corresponded with actualities (Chinese: 實, Pinyin: shí), but later generations confused terminology, coined new nomenclature, and thus could no longer distinguish right from wrong.\n\nXun Zi not only wrote that chapter on the topic of the rectification of names but went as far as to develop/expand the rectification into a system of logic. Xun Zi, who believed that man's inborn tendencies need to be curbed through education and ritual, countered to Mencius's view that man is innately good. He believed that ethical norms had been invented to rectify mankind. Other philosophers and logicians such as Guanzi, Mozi, and Gongsun Long developed their own theories regarding the rectification. Li in itself can be seen as the root of all this propriety and social etiquette discussed in the rectification of names as the cure to society's problems and the solution to a moral and efficient government and society.\n\nThe concept of rectification of names is one of the most basic mottoes of Chinese philosophy to date. It has been applied to a broad range of issues and mainly resides in the field of politics. This basic yet powerful precept has served as a means for the toppling and reforming of dynasties. In today's society, the rectification of names is being used popularly with government decisions.\n\nUntil 2008 Taiwan put effort into reviewing their historical records and weeding out any affiliation with China to insure their isolated identity. The Democratic Progressive Party administration had been editing grade school history textbooks to refer to Chinese history as \"Chinese history\" instead of \"this country's history\" and removing the honorific title \"Father of the country\" from references to Sun Yat-sen, leaving only his name. (Berman Feb 7, 2007) For those who still practice the traditional Confucian approach to ethics and social morality, the rectification of names has an impact in the way society is structured. According to Xuezhi Guo, \"Rectification of names also implies the promotion and development of an elaborately differentiated system of status based on social obligations\".\n\n\"A Short History of Chinese Philosophy\", Fung Yu-lan, 1948.

It is what Deleuze calls an \"image of thought,\" based on the botanical rhizome, that apprehends multiplicities.\n\nDeleuze and Guattari use the terms \"rhizome\" and \"rhizomatic\" to describe theory and research that allows for multiple, non-hierarchical entry and exit points in data representation and interpretation. In \"A Thousand Plateaus\", they oppose it to an arborescent (hierarchic, tree-like) conception of knowledge, which works with dualist categories and binary choices. A rhizome works with planar and trans-species connections, while an arborescent model works with vertical and linear connections. Their use of the \"orchid and the wasp\" is taken from the biological concept of mutualism, in which two different species interact together to form a multiplicity (i.e. a unity that is multiple in itself). Hybridization or horizontal gene transfer would also be good illustrations.\n\n\"As a model for culture, the rhizome resists the organizational structure of the root-tree system which charts causality along chronological lines and looks for the original source of 'things' and looks towards the pinnacle or conclusion of those 'things.' A rhizome, on the other hand, is characterized by 'ceaselessly established connections between semiotic chains, organizations of power, and circumstances relative to the arts, sciences, and social struggles.' Rather than narrativize history and culture, the rhizome presents history and culture as a map or wide array of attractions and influences with no specific origin or genesis, for a 'rhizome has no beginning or end; it is always in the middle, between things, interbeing, intermezzo.' The planar movement of the rhizome resists chronology and organization, instead favoring a nomadic system of growth and propagation.\n\n\"In this model, culture spreads like the surface of a body of water, spreading towards available spaces or trickling downwards towards new spaces through fissures and gaps, eroding what is in its way. The surface can be interrupted and moved, but these disturbances leave no trace, as the water is charged with pressure and potential to always seek its equilibrium, and thereby establish smooth space.\"\n\nDeleuze and Guattari introduce \"A Thousand Plateaus\" by outlining the concept of the rhizome (quoted from \"A Thousand Plateaus\"):\n\n\n\n"}

A sanky-panky solicits on beaches and has clients of both sexes or only women. When with men, the sanky-panky assumes an active (a.k.a. top) role, but when with women, assumes the role of an ideal lover. \n\nWhile strictly speaking they are not prostitutes, since they do not directly negotiate money for sex, they are more likely to create a pseudo-relationship which can be continued when the guest returns home. They then attempt to ask for money to be sent to them primarily by wire transfer, often using elaborate stories of need, involving (for example) sick relatives. A sanky's ultimate goal is to obtain a marriage visa to the tourist's native country, marry the tourist, then abandon her.\n\nIn Peru they are known as bricheros (which are male and usually target female tourists) and bricheras (who are females instead and target male tourists). They hang out in popular tourist destinations and may even involve themselves in business involving tourism in order to reach their prey.\n\nIn certain tourist cities of Venezuela, and specially in the city of Mérida, females following a similar pattern of conduct are known as \"Puta-Tour\", a pejorative term that relates the person with travel based prostitution. Nevertheless, there are cases where the sexual intercourse is never reached, and long term friendships are the result. They usually target White American and European tourists, primarily in the interest of learning and/or practicing a foreign language (other than Spanish), serving also as a nice host and tourist guide, but expecting to get invited to travel to the tourist's native country. These relationships can range from friendship to marriage, and are based on the cultural interchanging and traveling, supported by the foreign tourist.\n\nThe persona of the \"sanky panky\" has been brought to the cinema in 2007 by Spanish director Jose E. Pintor. In his comedic film entitled \"Sanky Panky\", audiences follow the life of a young Dominican man named Genaro (played by Dominican comedian Fausto Mata) who travels to Bávaro to work at a resort in hopes of finding a \"gringa\" or a white American woman who will give him a visa. In the process, he meets a young heartbroken woman and her two older and oversexed aunts. The story that follows presents the beauties of Dominican resorts but portrays the realities of poverty in the Dominican Republic while simultaneously immortalizing the \"sanky panky\" via major motion picture.\n\nA film that explores this topic in a Francophone context is \"Heading South\".\n\n"}

In this book Dalai Lama engages in several scientific areas. He explores the topics of quantum physics, cosmology, consciousness and genetics in relation to Buddhism.\n\nTenzin Gyatso, at the age of 6, was chosen as the 14th Dalai Lama. He is believed to be the reincarnation of his predecessors. At an early age, Gyatso showed interest in science and the scientific method. In this book, \"The Universe in a Single Atom\", Tenzin Gyatso explores the commonality and difference between Buddhism and scientific argumentation.\n\nIn this book, \"The Universe in a Single Atom,\" The Dalai Lama exhibits humble beginnings in science, including finding a brass telescope from the thirteenth Dalai Lama. With the telescope, he was able to find \"the rabbit on the moon,\" a Tibetan saying for a land form on the moon. Utilizing other apparatuses such as cars and watches, the Dalai Lama took interest in the mechanical operations of the objects.\n\nIn the book, The Dalai Lama creates exigency for the peaceful relationship between Buddhism and science. The goal is to mitigate human suffering from both Buddhist philosophy and science. Scientists and Buddhists acknowledge that Buddhists use sensory perceptions and introspective thinking requiring cooperation of the body. In the 1980s, The Dalai Lama sought scientific advice from Francisco Varela. A product of the meeting was Varela's realization that the act of medtiation through introspective thinking could complement science.\n\nIt should be noted that Buddhist teachings prove everything is changing and transitory. Essentially, thoughts come into our minds, then move on. Buddhists believe this is what causes suffering. The Dalai Lama believes in justifying the concept of micro-matter through the definition of inconsistent flow. The nature of a paradoxical reality mirrors the Buddhist philosophy of emptiness. Quantum physics debates the sustainability of having the notion of reality, as defined by Buddhist philosophy.\n\nOne way Buddhists and scientists agree is their understanding of the Buddha's lack of explanation for the formation of the universe. However, Buddhist cosmologists have created the notion of a universe that has a form, expands and then is destructive. Both sides, science and Buddhist cosmologists, do not immediately resort to create a Godly being as the origin of all matter. Moreover, in Buddhism the universe is depicted as infinite and beginning less. The Dalai Lama wishes, in the book, to venture beyond the big bang and process thoughts about the possible structures and activity before the big bang.\n\nAccording to Dr. Hugh Murdoch of The Theosophical Society Australia, the concept of consciousness has been insignificantly proven through scientific study. The Dalai Lama asks the question for scientists, what about the direct observation of consciousness itself? The concept of consciousness was discussed by the Buddha who said the mind is paramount above all things. Buddhists believe in the concept of matter, mind, and mental states. The Dalai Lama wishes for scientists to quit questioning if consciousness is favored in dualism, or materialism and actually study through the first person perspective.\n\nBuddhists believe the primary purpose of life is to eliminate suffering. The Dalai Lama has no objection to cloning, only if it is based in altruistic motivation. The Dalai Lama supports the human genome project because it shows the difference between different ethics is minimal at best.\n\nAfter closely analyzing \"The Universe in a Single Atom\", Michael Shermer, publisher of \"Skeptic Magazine\", concludes, \" So I would caution both Christians and Buddhists alike: be careful what you wish for in this endeavor to unify science and religion-you may not like what you find.\"\nArthur Zajonc, president of the Mind and Life Institute states, \"\"The Universe in a Single Atom\" is an open-minded engagement between intellectual traditions, an engagement that enriches our shrinking planet.\" Critic Lisa Liquori states,\"Though the Dalai Lama aims to reach a wide audience and offers a fair, nicely written, and thoughtful treatise, the subject matter will primarily appeal to spiritual types and to altruistic, ethical physicists and biologists.\n"}

Spiritual Gifts and Ministries\" of the official 28 Fundamental Beliefs of Adventists affirms that spiritual gifts do continue into the present. While the gift of tongues or \"glossolalia\" is not specifically mentioned, Adventists more often limit it to the ability to speak unlearned human languages, or \"xenoglossy\"; and have generally rejected the form of tongues practised by many charismatic and Pentecostal Christians, described as ecstatic speech or a \"personal prayer language\". \n\nSupporting this position is Gerhard Hasel, who believed the practice refers to unknown human languages only, and not angelic languages nor ecstatic speech. His document has been frequently cited by Adventists. The \"Handbook of Seventh-day Adventist Theology\" takes the position that speaking in tongues refers to \"previously unlearned human languages\" (xenoglossy), using the experience on the day of Pentecost in as the \"criterion\" for later interpretation. David Asscherick also believes tongues are xenoglossy only.\n\nEllen G. White wrote concerning this issue. She states...\n\nShe also stated...\n\"They give themselves up to wild, excitable feelings and make unintelligible sounds which they call the gift of tongues, and a certain class seem to be charmed with these strange manifestations. A strange spirit rules with this class, which would bear down and run over anyone who would reprove them. God's Spirit is not in the work and does not attend such workmen. They have another spirit.\"\n\nSee also other Adventist commentators.\n\nThe first counterfeit instance in regards to a doctrine issue occurred in 1848. James White recorded the incident writing \"There has been some division as to the time of beginning the Sabbath. Some commenced at sundown. Most, however, at 6 P.M. A week ago Sabbath we made this a subject of prayer. The Holy Ghost came down, Brother Chamberlain was filled with the power. In this state he cried out in an unknown tongue. The interpretation followed which was this: 'Give me the chalk, Give me the chalk.' Well, thought I, if there is none in the house then I shall doubt this, but in a moment a brother took down a good piece of chalk. Brother Chamberlain took it and in the power he drew a figure on the floor.\"\n\nBrother Chamberlain then gave his own interpretation to his unknown tongue and the drawing...\n\nThis experience carried weight with the believers and they continued to observe the beginning of the Sabbath at six o'clock.\nLater on, through a study of the Bible, this incident was later discovered as a counterfeit manifestation of the gift of tongues. In the summer of 1855, James White urged J.N. Andrews to investigate the Sabbath commencement issue. After several weeks of a \"careful investigation of the Scriptures, (he) demonstrated from nine texts in the Old Testament and two texts in the New that the Sabbath began at sundown. Andrews' conclusions were read at the conference in Battle Creek, November, 1855, and, from the scriptural evidence set forth, those present accepted the responsibility of shifting from six o'clock to sundown as the time to begin the Sabbath.\" \n\nThere are four documented cases of people claiming to speak in tongues in the early history of the Adventist church, according to Arthur White:\n\n\nArthur White states \"There is no record of Ellen White's giving explicit support to, or placing her endorsement upon, these ecstatic experiences with unknown tongues, although she was an eyewitness to three of the four.\" \n\nThere have also been other counterfeit claims. In June 1853 on her trip to Vergennes, Michigan, Ellen White rebuked a certain \"Mrs. A.\" who \"professes to talk with tongues, but she is deceived. She does not talk the language she claims to speak. In fact, she does not talk any language. If all the nations of the earth were together, and should hear her talk, no one of them would know what she says; for she merely goes over a lot of meaningless gibberish.\" The woman claimed to speak the local Native American language.\n\n\"At a meeting she held the next day, this woman spoke on the subject of holiness, and during her talk broke out again in the unknown tongue. An Indian who had been invited to come in to hear her speak his language jumped to his feet, declaring: \"Very bad Indian that! Very bad Indian that!\" When asked what the woman said, he declared: \"Nothing; she talk no Indian.\"\n\nA few days later in the presence of an Indian interpreter who knew 17 of the languages, she spoke and prayed in her gibberish, and he declared that she had not uttered a single Indian word. Her influence was short lived, not only because of this experience, but because of the disclosure (from one of Ellen White's visions) that the man with whom she traveled and lived was not her husband. This in time was confessed.\"\n\nRalph Mackin and his wife claimed to experience gifts of the Holy Spirit such as prophecy, speaking in tongues, and even casting out demons. At an Adventist camp meeting in Mansfield, Ohio; they also claimed the gift of tongues, with Ralph speaking Chinese and his wife Yiddish as the result of a vision. Ellen White was cautious if not skeptical, and ultimately rebuked their testimony stating...\n\n\"I was shown that it was not the Spirit of the Lord that was inspiring Brother and Sister Mackin, but the same spirit of fanaticism that is ever seeking entrance into the remnant church. Their application of Scripture of their peculiar exercises is Scripture misapplied. The work of declaring persons possessed of the devil, and then praying with them and pretending to cast out the evil spirits, is fanaticism which will bring into disrepute any church which sanctions such work.\" \n\nShe continues to state...\n\nPentecostal-turned-Adventist E. C. Card says he gave up speaking in tongues. Howard Blum shared his perspective.\n\nOne website article, part 2 - \"A False Concept Of the Son\" claims Demos Shakarian (1913–1993) and the FGBMFI held a meeting to distribute their \"Voice\" magazine to Adventist workers. It mentions Adventists Bill Loveless and Dr. Lowe. This was viewed with concern by Adventists, as one editor stated, \"Already we have lost members to the delusions of this phenomenon. Some have been young people.\"\n\nIn 2007, Australian administrator Gilbert Cangy reported receiving the gift of unlearned human languages (xenoglossy), when in the Vanuatuan island Ambrym, local Bislama speakers understood his English presentations. \n\nThe \"1991 National Church Life Survey\" in Australia found that approximately 5% of Australian Adventists approve of and/or speak in tongues, whereas 11% have no opinion and approximately 85% disapprove. This was the highest disapproval rating amongst all denominations surveyed.\n\n\n\n"}

With millions of species of concern, the identification of selected \"keystone species\", \"flagship species\" or \"umbrella species\" makes conservation decisions easier. Umbrella species can be used to help select the locations of potential reserves, find the minimum size of these conservation areas or reserves, and to determine the composition, structure and processes of ecosystems.\n\nTwo commonly used definitions are:\n\n\nOther descriptions include:\n\nThe use of umbrella species as a conservation tool is highly debated. The term was first used by Wilcox (1984) who defined an umbrella species as one whose minimum area requirements are at least as comprehensive of the rest of the community for which protection is sought though the establishment and management of a protected area.\n\nSome scientists have found that the umbrella effect provides a simpler way to manage ecological communities. Others feel that a combination of other tools establish better land management reserves to help protect more species than just using umbrella species alone. Individual invertebrate species can be good umbrella species because they can protect older, unique ecosystems. There have been cases where umbrella species have protected a large amount of area which has been beneficial to surrounding species. Dunk, Zielinski and Welsh (2006) reported that the reserves in Northern California (the Klamat h-Siskiyou forests), set aside for the northern spotted owl, also protect mollusks and salamanders within that habitat. They found that the reserves set aside for the northern spotted owl \"serve as a reasonable coarse-filter umbrella species for the taxa evaluated\", which were mollusks and salamanders.\n\nThe bay checkerspot butterfly has been on the Endangered Species List since 1987. Launer and Murphy (1994) tried to determine whether this butterfly could be considered an umbrella species in protecting the native grassland it inhabits. They discovered that the Endangered Species Act has a loophole excluding federally protected plants on private property. However, the California Environmental Quality Act reinforces state conservation regulations. Using the Endangered Species Act to protect termed umbrella species and their habitats can be controversial because they are not as well enforced in some states as others (such as California) to protect overall biodiversity.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "32361", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32361", "title": "Value theory", "text": "Value theory\n\nValue theory is a range of approaches to understanding how, why, and to what degree persons value things; whether the object or subject of valuing is a person, idea, object, or anything else.\n\nThis investigation began in ancient philosophy, where it is called axiology or ethics. Early philosophical investigations sought to understand good and evil and the concept of \"the good\". Today, much of value theory aspires to the scientifically empirical, recording what people do value and attempting to understand why they value it in the context of psychology, sociology, and economics.\n\nAt the general level, there is a difference between moral and natural goods. Moral goods are those that have to do with the conduct of persons, usually leading to praise or blame. Natural goods, on the other hand, have to do with objects, not persons. For example, the statement \"Mary is a good person\" uses 'good' very differently than in the statement \"That is good food\".\n\nEthics is mainly focused on moral goods rather than natural goods, while economics has a concern in what is economically good for the society but not an individual person and is also interested in natural goods. However, both moral and natural goods are equally relevant to goodness and value theory, which is more general in scope.\n\nIn sociology, value theory is concerned with personal values which are popularly held by a community, and how those values might change under particular conditions. Different groups of people may hold or prioritize different kinds of values influencing social behavior.\n\nMajor Western theorists who stress the importance of values as an analytical independent variable include Max Weber, Émile Durkheim, Talcott Parsons, and Jürgen Habermas. Classical examples of sociological traditions which deny or downplay the question of values are institutionalism, historical materialism (including Marxism), behaviorism, pragmatic-oriented theories, postmodern philosophy and various objectivist-oriented theories.\n\nMethods of study range from questionnaire surveys to participant observation.\n\nEconomic analysis emphasizes goods sought in a market and tends to use the consumer's choices as evidence (revealed preference) that various products are of economic value. In this view, religious or political struggle over what \"goods\" are available in the marketplace is inevitable, and consensus on some core questions about body and society and ecosystems affected by the transaction, are outside the market's goods so long as they are unowned.\n\nHowever, some natural goods seem to also be moral goods. For example, those things that are owned by a person may be said to be natural goods, but over which a particular individual(s) may have moral claims. So it is necessary to make another distinction: between \"moral\" and \"non-moral goods\". A non-moral good is something that is desirable for someone or other; despite the name to the contrary, it may include moral goods. A moral good is anything which an actor is considered to be morally obligated to strive toward.\n\nWhen discussing non-moral goods, one may make a useful distinction between inherently serviced and material \"goods in\" the marketplace (or its exchange value), versus perceived intrinsic and experiential \"goods to\" the buyer. A strict service economy model takes pains to distinguish between the goods and service guarantees \"to the market\", and that of the service and experience \"to the consumer\".\n\nSometimes, moral and natural goods can conflict. The value of natural \"goods\" is challenged by such issues as addiction. The issue of addiction also brings up the distinction between economic and moral goods, where an economic good is whatever stimulates economic growth. For instance, some claim that cigarettes are a \"good\" in the economic sense, as their production can employ tobacco growers and doctors who treat lung cancer. Many people would agree that cigarette smoking is not \"morally\" \"good\", nor \"naturally\" \"good,\" but still recognize that it is economically good, which means, it has exchange value, even though it may have a negative public good or even be bad for a person's body (not the same as \"bad for the person\" necessarily – consider the issue of suicide.) \n\nIn ecological economics value theory is separated into two types: donor-type value and receiver-type value. Ecological economists tend to believe that 'real wealth' needs a donor-determined value as a measure of what things were needed to make an item or generate a service (H. T. Odum, \"Environmental Accounting: Emergy and environmental decision-making\", 1996). An example of receiver-type value is 'market value', or 'willingness to pay', the principal method of accounting used in neo-classical economics. In contrast, both Marx's labour theory of value and the emergy concept are conceived as donor-type value. Emergy theorists believe that this conception of value has relevance to all of philosophy, economics, sociology and psychology as well as Environmental Science.\n\nSilvio Gesell denied value theory in economics. He thought that value theory is useless and prevents economics from becoming science and that a currency administration guided by value theory is doomed to sterility and inactivity.\n\nIntuitively, theories of value must be important to ethics. A number of useful distinctions have been made by philosophers in the treatment of value.\n\nMany people find it useful to distinguish \"instrumental value\" and \"intrinsic values\", first discussed by Plato in the \"Republic\". An instrumental value is worth having as a means towards getting something else that is good (e.g., a radio is instrumentally good in order to hear music). An intrinsically valuable thing is worth having for itself, not as a means to something else. It is giving value intrinsic and extrinsic properties.\n\nIntrinsic and instrumental goods are not mutually exclusive categories. Some things are both good in themselves, and also good for getting other things that are good. \"Understanding science\" may be such a good, being both worthwhile in and of itself, and as a means of achieving other goods.\n\nA prominent argument in environmental ethics, made by writers like Aldo Leopold and Holmes Rolston III, is that wild nature and healthy ecosystems have intrinsic value, prior to and apart from their instrumental value as resources for humans, and should therefore be preserved. This line of argument has been articulated further in recent years by Canadian philosopher John McMurtry within the \"Encyclopedia of Life Support Systems\" (http://www.eolss.net) published by UNESCO.\n\nJohn Dewey (1859-1952), in his book \"Theory of Valuation\", sees goodness as the outcome of ethic valuation, a continuous balancing of \"ends in view\". An end in view is said to be an objective potentially adopted, which may be refined or rejected based on its consistency with other objectives or as a means to objectives already held.\n\nDewey's empiricist approach evinces absolute intrinsic value denial; i.e. not accepting intrinsic value as an inherent or enduring property of things. Instead, Dewey sees the appearance of intrinsic value as an illusory product of our continuous valuative activity as purposive beings. In addition to denying categorically that there is anything like intrinsic value, Dewey held the same position with regard to moral values - for Dewey, moral values are also based on a learning process, and are never intrinsic or absolute.\n\nAnother contribution of pragmatism to value theory is the idea of contributory goods with a contributory conditionality. These have the same qualities as the good thing, but need some emergent property of a whole state-of-affairs in order to be good. For example, salt is food on its own, but is far better as part of a prepared meal. In other words, such goods are only \"good\" when certain conditions are met. This is in contrast to other goods, which may be considered \"good\" in a wider variety of situations.\n\nThe thinking of Immanuel Kant greatly influenced moral philosophy. He thought of moral value as a unique and universally identifiable property, as an absolute value rather than a relative value. He showed that many practical goods are good only in states-of-affairs described by a sentence containing an \"if\" clause, e.g., in the sentence, \"Sunshine is only good if you do not live in the desert.\" Further, the \"if\" clause often described the category in which the judgment was made (art, science, etc.). Kant described these as \"hypothetical goods\", and tried to find a \"categorical\" good that would operate across all categories of judgment without depending on an \"if-then\" clause.\n\nAn influential result of Kant's search was the idea of a \"good will\" being the only intrinsic good. Moreover, Kant saw a good will as acting in accordance with a moral command, the \"Categorical Imperative\": \"Act according to those maxims that you could will to be universal law.\" but should not be confused with the Ethic of Reciprocity or Golden Rule, e.g. Mt. 7:12. Whereas the golden rule states that \"One should treat others as one would like others to treat oneself,\" Kant asks us to analyze whether an act can be performed simultaneously by everyone without exception. For example, murder cannot be performed simultaneously by everyone, one set of people would have to live and the other die. That disparity is an exception. The act cannot be performed without exception, therefore it fails the categorical imperative. Contrast this with the golden rule which is subjective to the individual. Following the logic of the golden rule, if I wanted someone to kill me, then it would be acceptable for me to kill others, because I would be doing to others what I would want done to me. This is very important to keep in mind, because Kant's categorical imperative avoids this flaw. From this, and a few other axioms, Kant developed a moral system that would apply to any \"praiseworthy person\".\n\nKantian philosophers believe that any general definition of goodness must define goods that are categorical in the sense that Kant intended.\n\n"}
{"id": "38218", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38218", "title": "Émile Durkheim", "text": "Émile Durkheim\n\nDavid Émile Durkheim ( ; 15 April 1858 – 15 November 1917) was a French sociologist. He formally established the academic discipline and—with W. E. B. Du Bois, Karl Marx and Max Weber—is commonly cited as the principal architect of modern social science.\n\nMuch of Durkheim's work was concerned with how societies could maintain their integrity and coherence in modernity, an era in which traditional social and religious ties are no longer assumed, and in which new social institutions have come into being. His first major sociological work was \"The Division of Labour in Society\" (1893). In 1895, he published \"The Rules of Sociological Method\" and set up the first European department of sociology, becoming France's first professor of sociology. In 1898, he established the journal \"L'Année Sociologique\". Durkheim's seminal monograph, \"Suicide\" (1897), a study of suicide rates in Catholic and Protestant populations, pioneered modern social research and served to distinguish social science from psychology and political philosophy. \"The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life\" (1912) presented a theory of religion, comparing the social and cultural lives of aboriginal and modern societies.\n\nDurkheim was also deeply preoccupied with the acceptance of sociology as a legitimate science. He refined the positivism originally set forth by Auguste Comte, promoting what could be considered as a form of epistemological realism, as well as the use of the hypothetico-deductive model in social science. For him, sociology was the science of institutions, if this term is understood in its broader meaning as \"beliefs and modes of behaviour instituted by the collectivity\" and its aim being to discover structural social facts. Durkheim was a major proponent of structural functionalism, a foundational perspective in both sociology and anthropology. In his view, social science should be purely holistic; that is, sociology should study phenomena attributed to society at large, rather than being limited to the specific actions of individuals.\n\nHe remained a dominant force in French intellectual life until his death in 1917, presenting numerous lectures and published works on a variety of topics, including the sociology of knowledge, morality, social stratification, religion, law, education, and deviance. Durkheimian terms such as \"collective consciousness\" have since entered the popular lexicon.\n\nEmile Durkheim was born in Épinal in Lorraine, the son of Mélanie (Isidor) and Moïse Durkheim. He came from a long line of devout French Jews; his father, grandfather, and great-grandfather had been rabbis. He began his education in a rabbinical school, but at an early age, he decided not to follow in his family's footsteps and switched schools. Durkheim led a completely secular life. Much of his work was dedicated to demonstrating that religious phenomena stemmed from social rather than divine factors. While Durkheim chose not to follow in the family tradition, he did not sever ties with his family or with the Jewish community. Many of his most prominent collaborators and students were Jewish, and some were blood relations. Marcel Mauss, a notable social anthropologist of the pre-war era, was his nephew. One of his nieces was Claudette (née Raphael) Bloch, a marine biologist and mother of Maurice Bloch, who became a noted anthropologist.\n\nA precocious student, Durkheim entered the \"École Normale Supérieure\" (ENS) in 1879, at his third attempt. The entering class that year was one of the most brilliant of the nineteenth century and many of his classmates, such as Jean Jaurès and Henri Bergson, would go on to become major figures in France's intellectual history. At the ENS, Durkheim studied under the direction of Numa Denis Fustel de Coulanges, a classicist with a social scientific outlook, and wrote his Latin dissertation on Montesquieu. At the same time, he read Auguste Comte and Herbert Spencer. Thus Durkheim became interested in a scientific approach to society very early on in his career. This meant the first of many conflicts with the French academic system, which had no social science curriculum at the time. Durkheim found humanistic studies uninteresting, turning his attention from psychology and philosophy to ethics and eventually, sociology. He obtained his \"agrégation\" in philosophy in 1882, though finishing next to last in his graduating class owing to serious illness the year before.\n\nThe opportunity for Durkheim to receive a major academic appointment in Paris was inhibited by his approach to society. From 1882 to 1887 he taught philosophy at several provincial schools. In 1885 he decided to leave for Germany, where for two years he studied sociology at the universities of Marburg, Berlin and Leipzig. As Durkheim indicated in several essays, it was in Leipzig that he learned to appreciate the value of empiricism and its language of concrete, complex things, in sharp contrast to the more abstract, clear and simple ideas of the Cartesian method. By 1886, as part of his doctoral dissertation, he had completed the draft of his \"The Division of Labour in Society\", and was working towards establishing the new science of sociology.\n\nDurkheim's period in Germany resulted in the publication of numerous articles on German social science and philosophy; Durkheim was particularly impressed by the work of Wilhelm Wundt. Durkheim's articles gained recognition in France, and he received a teaching appointment in the University of Bordeaux in 1887, where he was to teach the university's first social science course. His official title was \"Chargé d'un Cours de Science Sociale et de Pédagogie\" and thus he taught both pedagogy and sociology (the latter had never been taught in France before). The appointment of the social scientist to the mostly humanistic faculty was an important sign of the change of times, and also the growing importance and recognition of the social sciences. From this position Durkheim helped reform the French school system and introduced the study of social science in its curriculum. However, his controversial beliefs that religion and morality could be explained in terms purely of social interaction earned him many critics.\n\nAlso in 1887, Durkheim married Louise Dreyfus. They would have two children, Marie and André.\n\nThe 1890s were a period of remarkable creative output for Durkheim. In 1893, he published \"The Division of Labour in Society\", his doctoral dissertation and fundamental statement of the nature of human society and its development. Durkheim's interest in social phenomena was spurred on by politics. France's defeat in the Franco-Prussian War led to the fall of the regime of Napoleon III, which was then replaced by the Third Republic. This in turn resulted in a backlash against the new secular and republican rule, as many people considered a vigorously nationalistic approach necessary to rejuvenate France's fading power. Durkheim, a Jew and a staunch supporter of the Third Republic with a sympathy towards socialism, was thus in the political minority, a situation that galvanized him politically. The Dreyfus affair of 1894 only strengthened his activist stance.\n\nIn 1895, he published \"The Rules of Sociological Method\", a manifesto stating what sociology is and how it ought to be done, and founded the first European department of sociology at the University of Bordeaux. In 1898, he founded \"L'Année Sociologique\", the first French social science journal. Its aim was to publish and publicize the work of what was, by then, a growing number of students and collaborators (this is also the name used to refer to the group of students who developed his sociological program). In 1897, he published \"Suicide\", a case study that provided an example of what the sociological monograph might look like. Durkheim was one of the pioneers of the use of quantitative methods in criminology during his suicide case study.\n\nBy 1902, Durkheim had finally achieved his goal of attaining a prominent position in Paris when he became the chair of education at the Sorbonne. Durkheim aimed for the Parisian position earlier, but the Parisian faculty took longer to accept what some called \"sociological imperialism\" and admit social science to their curriculum. He became a full professor (Professor of the Science of Education) there in 1906, and in 1913 he was named Chair in \"Education and Sociology\". Because French universities are technically institutions for training secondary school teachers, this position gave Durkheim considerable influence—his lectures were the only ones that were mandatory for the entire student body. Durkheim had much influence over the new generation of teachers; around that time he also served as an advisor to the Ministry of Education. In 1912, he published his last major work, \"The Elementary Forms of The Religious Life\".\n\nThe outbreak of World War I was to have a tragic effect on Durkheim's life. His leftism was always patriotic rather than internationalist—he sought a secular, rational form of French life. But the coming of the war and the inevitable nationalist propaganda that followed made it difficult to sustain this already nuanced position. While Durkheim actively worked to support his country in the war, his reluctance to give in to simplistic nationalist fervor (combined with his Jewish background) made him a natural target of the now-ascendant French Right. Even more seriously, the generations of students that Durkheim had trained were now being drafted to serve in the army, and many of them perished in the trenches. Finally, Durkheim's own son, André, died on the war front in December 1915—a loss from which Durkheim never recovered. Emotionally devastated, Durkheim collapsed of a stroke in Paris on November 15, 1917. He was buried at the Montparnasse Cemetery in Paris.\n\nThroughout his career, Durkheim was concerned primarily with three goals. First, to establish sociology as a new academic discipline. Second, to analyse how societies could maintain their integrity and coherence in the modern era, when things such as shared religious and ethnic background could no longer be assumed; to that end he wrote much about the effect of laws, religion, education and similar forces on society and social integration. Lastly, Durkheim was concerned with the practical implications of scientific knowledge. The importance of social integration is expressed throughout Durkheim's work:\n\nDuring his university studies at the École, Durkheim was influenced by two neo-Kantian scholars, Charles Bernard Renouvier and Émile Boutroux. The principles Durkheim absorbed from them included rationalism, scientific study of morality, anti-utilitarianism and secular education. His methodology was influenced by Numa Denis Fustel de Coulanges, a supporter of the scientific method.\n\nA fundamental influence on Durkheim's thought was the sociological positivism of Auguste Comte, who effectively sought to extend and apply the scientific method found in the natural sciences to the social sciences. According to Comte, a true social science should stress for empirical facts, as well as induce general scientific laws from the relationship among these facts. There were many points on which Durkheim agreed with the positivist thesis. First, he accepted that the study of society was to be founded on an examination of facts. Second, like Comte, he acknowledged that the only valid guide to objective knowledge was the scientific method. Third, he agreed with Comte that the social sciences could become scientific only when they were stripped of their metaphysical abstractions and philosophical speculation. At the same time, Durkheim believed that Comte was still too philosophical in his outlook.\n\nA second influence on Durkheim's view of society beyond Comte's positivism was the epistemological outlook called social realism. Although he never explicitly exposed it, Durkheim adopted a realist perspective in order to demonstrate the existence of social realities outside the individual and to show that these realities existed in the form of the objective relations of society. As an epistemology of science, realism can be defined as a perspective that takes as its central point of departure the view that external social realities exist in the outer world and that these realities are independent of the individual's perception of them. This view opposes other predominant philosophical perspectives such as empiricism and positivism. Empiricists such as David Hume had argued that all realities in the outside world are products of human sense perception. According to empiricists, all realities are thus merely perceived: they do not exist independently of our perceptions, and have no causal power in themselves. Comte's positivism went a step further by claiming that scientific laws could be deduced from empirical observations. Going beyond this, Durkheim claimed that sociology would not only discover \"apparent\" laws, but would be able to discover the \"inherent nature\" of society.\n\nScholars also debate the exact influence of Jewish thought on Durkheim's work. The answer remains uncertain; some scholars have argued that Durkheim's thought is a form of secularized Jewish thought, while others argue that proving the existence of a direct influence of Jewish thought on Durkheim's achievements is difficult or impossible.\n\nDurkheim authored some of the most programmatic statements on what sociology is and how it should be practiced. His concern was to establish sociology as a science. Arguing for a place for sociology among other sciences he wrote:\nTo give sociology a place in the academic world and to ensure that it is a legitimate science, it must have an object that is clear and distinct from philosophy or psychology, and its own methodology. He argued, \"There is in every society a certain group of phenomena which may be differentiated from ...those studied by the other natural sciences.\"\n\nA fundamental aim of sociology is to discover structural \"social facts\".\n\nEstablishment of sociology as an independent, recognized academic discipline is amongst Durkheim's largest and most lasting legacies. Within sociology, his work has significantly influenced structuralism or structural functionalism. Scholars inspired by Durkheim include Marcel Mauss, Maurice Halbwachs, Célestin Bouglé, Alfred Radcliffe-Brown, Talcott Parsons, Robert K. Merton, Jean Piaget, Claude Lévi-Strauss, Ferdinand de Saussure, Michel Foucault, Clifford Geertz, Peter Berger, Robert N. Bellah, social reformer Patrick Hunout and others.\n\nIn \"The Rules of Sociological Method\" (1895), Durkheim expressed his will to establish a method that would guarantee sociology's truly scientific character. One of the questions raised by the author concerns the objectivity of the sociologist: how may one study an object that, from the very beginning, conditions and relates to the observer? According to Durkheim, observation must be as impartial and impersonal as possible, even though a \"perfectly objective observation\" in this sense may never be attained. A social fact must always be studied according to its relation with other social facts, never according to the individual who studies it. Sociology should therefore privilege comparison rather than the study of singular independent facts.\n\nDurkheim sought to create one of the first rigorous scientific approaches to social phenomena. Along with Herbert Spencer, he was one of the first people to explain the existence and quality of different parts of a society by reference to what function they served in maintaining the quotidian (i.e. by how they make society \"work\"). He also agreed with Spencer's organic analogy, comparing society to a living organism. Thus his work is sometimes seen as a precursor to functionalism. Durkheim also insisted that society was more than the sum of its parts.\n\nUnlike his contemporaries Ferdinand Tönnies and Max Weber, he did not focus on what motivates the actions of individuals (an approach associated with methodological individualism), but rather on the study of \"social facts\".\n\nDurkheim's work revolved around the study of social facts, a term he coined to describe phenomena that have an existence in and of themselves, are not bound to the actions of individuals, but have a coercive influence upon them. Durkheim argued that social facts have, \"sui generis\", an independent existence greater and more objective than the actions of the individuals that compose society. Only such social facts can explain the observed social phenomena. Being exterior to the individual person, social facts may thus also exercise coercive power on the various people composing society, as it can sometimes be observed in the case of formal laws and regulations, but also in situations implying the presence of informal rules, such as religious rituals or family norms. Unlike the facts studied in natural sciences, a \"social\" fact thus refers to a specific category of phenomena:\n\nSuch social facts are endowed with a power of coercion, by reason of which they may control individual behaviors. According to Durkheim, these phenomena cannot be reduced to biological or psychological grounds. Social facts can be material (physical objects) or immaterial (meanings, sentiments, etc.). The latter cannot be seen or touched, but they are external and coercive, and as such, they become real, gain \"facticity\". Physical objects can represent both material and immaterial social facts; for example a flag is a physical social fact that often has various immaterial social facts (the meaning and importance of the flag) attached to it.\n\nMany social facts, however, have no material form. Even the most \"individualistic\" or \"subjective\" phenomena, such as love, freedom or suicide, would be regarded by Durkheim as objective social facts. Individuals composing society do not directly cause suicide: suicide, as a social fact, exists independently in society, and is caused by other social facts (such as rules governing behavior and group attachment), whether an individual likes it or not. Whether a person \"leaves\" a society does not alter the \"fact\" that this society will \"still contain\" suicides. Suicide, like other immaterial social facts, exists independently of the will of an individual, cannot be eliminated, and is as influential – coercive – as physical laws such as gravity. Sociology's task thus consists of discovering the qualities and characteristics of such social facts, which can be discovered through a quantitative or experimental approach (Durkheim extensively relied on statistics).\n\nRegarding the society itself, like social institutions in general, Durkheim saw it as a set of social facts. Even more than \"what society is\", Durkheim was interested in answering \"how is a society created\" and \"what holds a society together\". In \"The Division of Labour in Society\", Durkheim attempted to answer the question of what holds the society together. He assumes that humans are inherently egoistic, but norms, beliefs and values (collective consciousness) form the moral basis of the society, resulting in social integration. Collective consciousness is of key importance to the society, its requisite function without which the society cannot survive. Collective consciousness produces the society and holds it together, and at the same time individuals produce collective consciousness through their interactions. Through collective consciousness human beings become aware of one another as social beings, not just animals.\n\nIn particular, the emotional part of the collective consciousness overrides our egoism: as we are emotionally bound to culture, we act socially because we recognize it is the responsible, moral way to act. A key to forming society is social interaction, and Durkheim believes that human beings, when in a group, will inevitably act in such a way that a society is formed.\n\nThe importance of another key social fact: the culture. Groups, when interacting, create their own culture and attach powerful emotions to it. He was one of the first scholars to consider the question of culture so intensely. Durkheim was interested in cultural diversity, and how the existence of diversity nonetheless fails to destroy a society. To that, Durkheim answered that any apparent cultural diversity is overridden by a larger, common, and more generalized cultural system, and the law.\n\nIn a socioevolutionary approach, Durkheim described the evolution of societies from mechanical solidarity to organic solidarity (one rising from mutual need). As the societies become more complex, evolving from mechanical to organic solidarity, the division of labour is counteracting and replacing collective consciousness. In the simpler societies, people are connected to others due to personal ties and traditions; in the larger, modern society they are connected due to increased reliance on others with regard to them performing their specialized tasks needed for the modern, highly complex society to survive. In mechanical solidarity, people are self-sufficient, there is little integration and thus there is the need for use of force and repression to keep society together. Also, in such societies, people have much fewer options in life. In organic solidarity, people are much more integrated and interdependent and specialisation and cooperation is extensive. Progress from mechanical to organic solidarity is based first on population growth and increasing population density, second on increasing \"morality density\" (development of more complex social interactions) and thirdly, on the increasing specialisation in workplace. One of the ways mechanical and organic societies differ is the function of law: in mechanical society the law is focused on its punitive aspect, and aims to reinforce the cohesion of the community, often by making the punishment public and extreme; whereas in the organic society the law focuses on repairing the damage done and is more focused on individuals than the community.\n\nOne of the main features of the modern, organic society is the importance, sacredness even, given to the concept – social fact – of the individual. The individual, rather than the collective, becomes the focus of rights and responsibilities, the center of public and private rituals holding the society together – a function once performed by the religion. To stress the importance of this concept, Durkheim talked of the \"cult of the individual\":\n\nDurkheim saw the population density and growth as key factors in the evolution of the societies and advent of modernity. As the number of people in a given area increase, so does the number of interactions, and the society becomes more complex. Growing competition between the more numerous people also leads to further division of labour. In time, the importance of the state, the law and the individual increases, while that of the religion and moral solidarity decreases.\n\nIn another example of evolution of culture, Durkheim pointed to fashion, although in this case he noted a more cyclical phenomenon. According to Durkheim, fashion serves to differentiate between lower classes and upper classes, but because lower classes want to look like the upper classes, they will eventually adapt the upper class fashion, depreciating it, and forcing the upper class to adopt a new fashion.\n\nAs the society, Durkheim noted there are several possible pathologies that could lead to a breakdown of social integration and disintegration of the society: the two most important ones are anomie and forced division of labour; lesser ones include the lack of coordination and suicide. By anomie Durkheim means a state when too rapid population growth reduces the amount of interaction between various groups, which in turn leads to a breakdown of understanding (norms, values, and so on). By forced division of labour Durkheim means a situation where power holders, driven by their desire for profit (greed), results in people doing the work they are unsuited for. Such people are unhappy, and their desire to change the system can destabilize the society.\n\nDurkheim's views on crime were a departure from conventional notions. He believed that crime is \"bound up with the fundamental conditions of all social life\" and serves a social function. He stated that crime implies \"not only that the way remains open to necessary changes but that in certain cases it directly prepares these changes\". Examining the trial of Socrates, he argues that \"his crime, namely, the independence of his thought, rendered a service not only to humanity but to his country\" as \"it served to prepare a new morality and faith that the Athenians needed\". As such, his crime \"was a useful prelude to reforms\". In this sense, he saw crime as being able to release certain social tensions and so have a cleansing or purging effect in society. He further stated that \"the authority which the moral conscience enjoys must not be excessive; otherwise, no-one would dare to criticize it, and it would too easily congeal into an immutable form. To make progress, individual originality must be able to express itself...[even] the originality of the criminal... shall also be possible\".\n\nIn \"Suicide\" (1897), Durkheim explores the differing suicide rates among Protestants and Catholics, arguing that stronger social control among Catholics results in lower suicide rates. According to Durkheim, Catholic society has normal levels of integration while Protestant society has low levels. Overall, Durkheim treated suicide as a social fact, explaining variations in its rate on a macro level, considering society-scale phenomena such as lack of connections between people (group attachment) and lack of regulations of behavior, rather than individuals' feelings and motivations.\n\nDurkheim believed there was more to suicide than extremely personal individual life circumstances: for example, a loss of a job, divorce, or bankruptcy. Instead, he took suicide and explained it as a social fact instead of a result of one’s circumstances. Durkheim believed that suicide was an instance of social deviance. Social deviance being any transgression of socially established norms. He created a normative theory of suicide focusing on the conditions of group life. The four different types of suicide that he proposed are egoistic, altruistic, anomic, and fatalistic. He began by plotting social regulation on the x-axis of his chart, and social integration on the y-axis. Egoistic suicide corresponds to a low level of social integration. When one is not well integrated into a social group it can lead to a feeling that he or she has not made a difference in anyone’s lives. On the other hand, too much social integration would be altruistic suicide. This occurs when a group dominates the life of an individual to a degree where they feel meaningless to society. Anomic suicide occurs when one has an insufficient amount of social regulation. This stems from the sociological term anomie meaning a sense of aimlessness or despair that arises from the inability to reasonably expect life to be predictable. Lastly, there is fatalistic suicide, which results from too much social regulation. An example of this would be when one follows the same routine day after day. This leads to he or she believing there is nothing good to look forward to. Durkheim suggested this was the most popular form of suicide for prisoners.\n\nThis study has been extensively discussed by later scholars and several major criticisms have emerged. First, Durkheim took most of his data from earlier researchers, notably Adolph Wagner and Henry Morselli, who were much more careful in generalizing from their own data. Second, later researchers found that the Protestant–Catholic differences in suicide seemed to be limited to German-speaking Europe and thus may have always been the spurious reflection of other factors. Durkheim's study of suicide has been criticized as an example of the logical error termed the ecological fallacy. However, diverging views have contested whether Durkheim's work really contained an ecological fallacy. More recent authors such as Berk (2006) have also questioned the micro–macro relations underlying Durkheim's work. Some, such as Inkeles (1959), Johnson (1965) and Gibbs (1968), have claimed that Durkheim's only intent was to explain suicide \"sociologically\" within a holistic perspective, emphasizing that \"he intended his theory to explain variation among social environments in the incidence of suicide, not the suicides of particular individuals\".\n\nDespite its limitations, Durkheim's work on suicide has influenced proponents of control theory, and is often mentioned as a classic sociological study. The book pioneered modern social research and served to distinguish social science from psychology and political philosophy.\n\nIn \"The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life\", Durkheim's first purpose was to identify the social origin and function of religion as he felt that religion was a source of camaraderie and solidarity. His second purpose was to identify links between certain religions in different cultures, finding a common denominator. He wanted to understand the empirical, social aspect of religion that is common to all religions and goes beyond the concepts of spirituality and God.\n\nDurkheim defined religion as\n\nIn this definition, Durkheim avoids references to supernatural or God. Durkheim argued that the concept of supernatural is relatively new, tied to the development of science and separation of supernatural—that which cannot be rationally explained—from natural, that which can. Thus, according to Durkheim, for early humans, everything was supernatural. Similarly, he points out that religions that give little importance to the concept of god exist, such as Buddhism, where the Four Noble Truths are much more important than any individual deity. With that, Durkheim argues, we are left with the following three concepts: the sacred (the ideas that cannot be properly explained, inspire awe and are considered worthy of spiritual respect or devotion), the beliefs and practices (which create highly emotional state—collective effervescence—and invest symbols with sacred importance), and the moral community (a group of people sharing a common moral philosophy). Out of those three concepts, Durkheim focused on the sacred, noting that it is at the very core of a religion. He defined sacred things as:\n\nDurkheim saw religion as the most fundamental social institution of humankind, and one that gave rise to other social forms. It was the religion that gave humanity the strongest sense of collective consciousness. Durkheim saw the religion as a force that emerged in the early hunter and gatherer societies, as the emotions collective effervescence run high in the growing groups, forcing them to act in a new ways, and giving them a sense of some hidden force driving them. Over time, as emotions became symbolized and interactions ritualized, religion became more organized, giving a rise to the division between the sacred and the profane. However, Durkheim also believed that religion was becoming less important, as it was being gradually superseded by science and the cult of an individual.\n\nHowever, even if the religion was losing its importance for Durkheim, it still laid the foundation of modern society and the interactions that governed it. And despite the advent of alternative forces, Durkheim argued that no replacement for the force of religion had yet been created. He expressed his doubt about modernity, seeing the modern times as \"a period of transition and moral mediocrity\".\n\nDurkheim also argued that our primary categories for understanding the world have their origins in religion. It is religion, Durkheim writes, that gave rise to most if not all other social constructs, including the larger society. Durkheim argued that categories are produced by the society, and thus are collective creations. Thus as people create societies, they also create categories, but at the same time, they do so unconsciously, and the categories are prior to any individual's experience. In this way Durkheim attempted to bridge the divide between seeing categories as constructed out of human experience and as logically prior to that experience. Our understanding of the world is shaped by social facts; for example the notion of time is defined by being measured through a calendar, which in turn was created to allow us to keep track of our social gatherings and rituals; those in turn on their most basic level originated from religion. In the end, even the most logical and rational pursuit of science can trace its origins to religion. Durkheim states that, \"Religion gave birth to all that is essential in the society.\n\nIn his work, Durkheim focused on totemism, the religion of the aboriginal Australians and Native Americans. Durkheim saw totemism as the most ancient religion, and focused on it as he believed its simplicity would ease the discussion of the essential elements of religion.\n\nDurkheim's work on religion was criticized on both empirical and theoretical grounds by specialists in the field. The most important critique came from Durkheim's contemporary, Arnold van Gennep, an expert on religion and ritual, and also on Australian belief systems. Van Gennep argued that Durkheim's views of primitive peoples and simple societies were \"entirely erroneous\". Van Gennep further argued that Durkheim demonstrated a lack of critical stance towards his sources, collected by traders and priests, naively accepting their veracity, and that Durkheim interpreted freely from dubious data. At the conceptual level, van Gennep pointed out Durkheim's tendency to press ethnography into a prefabricated theoretical scheme.\n\nDespite such critiques, Durkheim's work on religion has been widely praised for its theoretical insight and whose arguments and propositions, according to Robert Alun Jones, \"have stimulated the interest and excitement of several generations of sociologists irrespective of theoretical 'school' or field of specialization\".\n\nWhile Durkheim's work deals with a number of subjects, including suicide, the family, social structures, and social institutions, a large part of his work deals with the sociology of knowledge.\n\nWhile publishing short articles on the subject earlier in his career (for example the essay \"De quelques formes primitives de classification\" written in 1902 with Marcel Mauss), Durkheim's definitive statement concerning the sociology of knowledge comes in his 1912 \"magnum opus\" \"The Elementary Forms of Religious Life\". This book has as its goal not only the elucidation of the social origins and function of religion, but also the social origins and impact of society on language and logical thought. Durkheim worked largely out of a Kantian framework and sought to understand how the concepts and categories of logical thought could arise out of social life. He argued, for example, that the categories of space and time were not a priori. Rather, the category of space depends on a society's social grouping and geographical use of space, and a group's social rhythm that determines our understanding of time. In this Durkheim sought to combine elements of rationalism and empiricism, arguing that certain aspects of logical thought common to all humans did exist, but that they were products of collective life (thus contradicting the tabla rasa empiricist understanding whereby categories are acquired by individual experience alone), and that they were not universal a priori's (as Kant argued) since the content of the categories differed from society to society.\n\nAnother key elements to Durkheim's theory of knowledge is his concept of \"représentations collectives\" (collective representations), which is outlined in \"The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life\". \"Représentations collectives\" are the symbols and images that come to represent the ideas, beliefs, and values elaborated by a collectivity and are not reducible to individual constituents. They can include words, slogans, ideas, or any number of material items that can serve as a symbol, such as a cross, a rock, a temple, a feather etc. As Durkheim elaborates, \"représentations collectives\" are created through intense social interaction and are products of collective activity. As such these representations have the particular, and somewhat contradictory, aspect that they exist externally to the individual (since they are created and controlled not by the individual but by society as a whole), and yet simultaneously within each individual of the society (by virtue of that individual's participation within society).\n\nArguably the most important \"représentation collective\" is language, which according to Durkheim is a product of collective action. And because language is a collective action, language contains within it a history of accumulated knowledge and experience that no individual would be capable of creating on their own. As Durkheim says, 'représentations collectives', and language in particular:\nadd to that which we can learn by our own personal experience all that wisdom and science which the group has accumulated in the course of centuries. Thinking by concepts, is not merely seeing reality on its most general side, but it is projecting a light upon the sensation which illuminates it, penetrates it and transforms it.\n\nAs such, language, as a social product, literally structures and shapes our experience of reality. This discursive approach to language and society would be developed by later French philosophers, such as Michel Foucault.\n\nDurkheim defines morality as \"a system of rules for conduct\". His analysis of morality is strongly marked by Immanuel Kant and his notion of duty. While Durkheim was influenced by Kant, he was highly critical of aspects of the latter's moral theory and developed his own positions.\n\nDurkheim agrees with Kant that within morality, there is an element of obligation, \"a moral authority which, by manifesting itself in certain precepts particularly important to it, confers upon [moral rules] an obligatory character\". Morality tells us how to act from a position of superiority. There exists a certain, pre-established moral norm to which we must conform. It is through this view that Durkheim makes a first critique of Kant in saying that moral duties originate in society, and are not to be found in some universal moral concept such as the categorical imperative. Durkheim also argues that morality is characterized not just by this obligation, but is also something that is desired by the individual. The individual believes that by adhering to morality, they are serving the common Good, and for this reason, the individual submits voluntarily to the moral commandment.\n\nHowever, in order to accomplish its aims, morality must be legitimate in the eyes of those to whom it speaks. As Durkheim argues, this moral authority is primarily to be located in religion, which is why in any religion one finds a code of morality. For Durkheim, it is only society that has the resources, the respect, and the power to cultivate within an individual both the obligatory and the desirous aspects of morality.\n\nDurkheim thought that deviance was an essential component of a functional society. He believed that deviance had three possible effects on society. First, Durkheim thought that deviance could challenge the perspective and thoughts of the general population, leading to social change by pointing out a flaw in society. Secondly, deviant acts could also support existing social norms and beliefs by evoking the population to discipline the actors. Finally, Durkheim believed that reactions to deviant activity could increase camaraderie and social support among the population affected by the activity. Durkheim's thoughts on deviance contributed to Robert Merton's Strain Theory \n\nDurkheim had an important impact on the development of Anthropology and Sociology, influencing thinkers from his school of sociology, such as Marcel Mauss, but also later thinkers, such as Maurice Halbwachs, Talcott Parsons, Alfred Radcliffe-Brown, and Claude Lévi-Strauss. More recently, Durkheim has influenced sociologists such as Steven Lukes, Robert N. Bellah, and Pierre Bourdieu. His description of collective consciousness also deeply influenced the Turkish nationalism of Ziya Gökalp, the founding father of Turkish sociology. Randall Collins has developed a theory of what he calls interaction ritual chains, which is a synthesis of Durkheim's work on religion with Erving Goffman's micro-sociology. Goffman himself was also deeply influenced by Durkheim in his development of the interaction order.\n\nOutside of sociology, he influenced philosophers Henri Bergson and Emmanuel Levinas, and his ideas can be found latently in the work of certain structuralist thinkers of the 60s, such as Alain Badiou, Louis Althusser, and Michel Foucault.\n\nMuch of Durkheim's work, however, remains unacknowledged in philosophy, despite its direct relevance. As proof one can look to John Searle, who wrote a book \"The Construction of Social Reality\", in which he elaborates a theory of social facts and collective representations that he believed to be a landmark work that would bridge the gap between analytic and continental philosophy. Neil Gross however, demonstrates how Searle's views on society are more or less a reconstitution of Durkheim's theories of social facts, social institutions, collective representations and the like. Searle's ideas are thus open to the same criticisms as Durkheim's. Searle responded by saying that Durkheim's work was worse than he had originally believed, and, admitting that he had not read much of Durkheim's work, said that, \"Because Durkheim’s account seemed so impoverished I did not read any further in his work.\" Stephen Lukes, however, responded to Searle's response to Gross and refutes point by point the allegations that Searle makes against Durkheim, essentially upholding the argument of Gross, that Searle's work bears great resemblance to that of Durkheim's. Lukes attributes Searle's miscomprehension of Durkheim's work to the fact that Searle, quite simply, never read Durkheim.\n\n\nPublished posthumously:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2026886", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2026886", "title": "Āstika and nāstika", "text": "Āstika and nāstika\n\nĀstika (Sanskrit आस्तिक IAST: āstika) derives from the Sanskrit \"asti\", \"there is, there exists\", and means “one who believes in the existence (of God, of another world, etc.)” and nāstika means \"an atheist or unbeliever\" . These have been concepts used to classify Indian philosophies by modern scholars, and some Hindu, Buddhist and Jaina texts. \"Āstika\" has been defined in one of three ways; as those who accept the epistemic authority of the Vedas, as those who accept the existence of ātman, or as those who accept the existence of \"Ishvara\". In contrast, \"nāstika\" are those who deny the respective definitions of \"āstika\".\n\nThe various definitions for \"āstika\" and \"nāstika\" philosophies has been disputed since ancient times, and there is no consensus. Buddhism is considered to be \"nāstika\", but the Gautama Buddha is considered an avatar of Vishnu in some Hindu traditions.\nThe most studied Āstika schools of Indian philosophies, sometimes referred to as orthodox schools, are six: Nyāyá, Vaiśeṣika, Sāṃkhya, Yoga, Mīmāṃsā, and Vedānta. The most studied Nāstika schools of Indian philosophies, sometimes referred to as heterodox schools, are four: Buddhism, Jainism, Cārvāka, and Ājīvika. This orthodox-heterodox terminology is a construct of Western languages, and lacks scholarly roots in Sanskrit. Recent scholarly studies state that there have been various heresiological translations of Āstika and Nāstika in 20th century literature on Indian philosophies, but quite many are unsophisticated and flawed.\n\nAstika and Nāstika do not mean \"theism\" and \"atheism\" respectively in ancient or medieval era Sanskrit literature. In current Indian languages like Hindi, \"āstika\" and its derivatives usually mean \"theist\", while \"nāstika\" and its derivatives denote an \"atheist.” However, the terms are used differently in Hindu philosophy. For example, \"Sāṃkhya\" is both an atheist and \"āstika\" (Vedic) philosophy.\n\n\"Āstika\" is a Sanskrit adjective (and noun) that is derived from \"asti\" (\"there is or exists\"). meaning \"knowing that which exists\" or \"pious\"; \"Nāstika\" (\"na\" (not) + \"\") is its negative.\n\nOne of the traditional etymologies of the term \"āstika\"–based on Pāṇini's \"Aṣṭādhyāyī\",\n4.4.60 (\"astināstidiṣṭam matiḥ\") says ‘he whose opinion is that Īśvara exists’ (\"asti īśvara iti matir yasya\"). Other definitions include \"opposite of \"nāstika\"\" (\"nāstika bhinna\"); \"he whose idea is that Īśvara exists\" (\"īśvara asti iti vādī\"); \"he who considers the Vedas as authorities\" (\"vedaprāmāṇyavādī\"). According to Sanskrit grammarian Hemachandra, \"āstika\" is a synonym for ‘he who believes’.\n\nAs used in Hindu philosophy, the differentiation between \"āstika\" and \"nāstika\" does not refer to theism or atheism. The terms often, but not always, relate to accepting Vedic literature as an authority, particularly on their teachings on Self (Soul). The Veda and Hinduism do not subscribe to or include the concept of an almighty that is separate from oneself i.e. there is no concept of God in the Christian or Islamic sense. N. N. Bhattacharya writes:\nĀstika is also a name, such as that of a Vedic scholar born to the goddess Mānasā (\"Mind\") and the sage Jaratkaru.\n\nThe terms Āstika and Nāstika have been used to classify various Indian intellectual traditions.\n\nA list of six systems or \"ṣaḍdarśana\"s (also spelled \"Sad Darshan\") consider Vedas as a reliable source of knowledge and an authoritative source. These are the Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Samkhya, Yoga, Mīmāṃsā and Vedanta schools of Hinduism, and they are classified as the \"āstika\" schools:\n\n\nThese are often coupled into three groups for both historical and conceptual reasons: Nyāyá-Vaiśeṣika, Sāṃkhya-Yoga, and Mimāṃsā-Vedanta.\n\nThe main schools of Indian philosophy that reject the Vedas were regarded as heterodox in the Brahmanical tradition:\n\n\nThe use of the term \"nāstika\" to describe Buddhism and Jainism in India is explained by Gavin Flood as follows:\n\nTantric traditions in Hinduism have both \"āstika\" and \"nāstika\" lines; as Banerji writes in \"Tantra in Bengal\":\n\nManusmriti, in verse 2.11, defines Nāstika as those who revile \"Vedic literature based on two roots of science of reasoning (Śruti and Smriti)\". The 9th century Indian scholar Medhatithi analyzed this definition and stated that Nāstika does not mean someone who says \"Vedic literature are untrue\", but rather one who says \"Vedic literature are immoral\". Medhatithi further noted verse 8.309 of Manusmriti, to provide another aspect of the definition of Nāstika as one who believes, \"there is no other world, there is no purpose in giving charity, there is no purpose in rituals and the teachings in the Vedic literature.\"\n\nManusmriti does not define, or imply a definition for Astika. It is also silent or contradictory on specific rituals such as animal sacrifices, asserting Ahimsa (non-violence, non-injury) is dharma in its verses such as verse 10.63 based on Upanishadic layer of Vedic literature, even though the older layer of Vedic literature mention such sacrifices unlike the later layer of Vedic literature. Indian scholars, such as those from Samkhya, Yoga, Nyaya and Vedanta schools, accepted Astika to be those that include \"Śabda\" (शब्द, \"Aptavacana\", testimony of Vedic literature and reliable experts) as a reliable means of epistemology, but they accepted the later ancient layer of the Vedic literature to be superseding the earlier ancient layer.\n\nIn contrast to Manusmiriti, the 6th century CE Jain scholar and doxographer Haribhadra, provided a different perspective in his writings on Astika and Nāstika. Haribhadra did not consider \"reverence for Vedas\" as a marker for an Astika. He and other 1st millennium CE Jaina scholars defined Astika as one who \"affirms there exists another world, transmigration exists, virtue (\"punya\") exists, vice (\"paap\") exists\".\n\nThe 7th century scholars Jayaditya and Vamana, in \"Kasikavrtti\" of Pāṇini tradition, were silent on the role of or authority of Vedic literature in defining Astika and Nāstika. They state, \"Astika is the one who believes there exists another world. The opposite of him is the Nāstika.\"\n\nSimilarly the widely studied 2nd-3rd century CE Buddhist philosopher Nagarjuna, in Chapter 1 verses 60-61 of Ratnāvalī, wrote Vaiśeṣika and Sāṃkhya schools of Hinduism were Nāstika, along with Jainism, his own school of Buddhism and Pudgalavadins (Vātsīputrīya) school of Buddhism.\n\nAstika, in some texts, is defined as those who believe in the existence of \"Atman\" (Soul, Self, Spirit), while Nastika being those who deny there is any \"soul, self\" in human beings and other living beings. All six schools of Hinduism classified as Astika philosophies hold the premise, \"Atman exists\". Buddhism, in contrast, holds the premise, \"Atman does not exist\". Asanga Tilakaratna translates Astika as \"positivism\" and Nastika as \"negativism\", with Astika illustrated by Brahmanic traditions who accepted \"soul and God exists\", while Nastika as those traditions, such as Buddhism, who denied \"soul and God exists\".\n\nAccording to G. S. Ghurye, the Jain texts define \"na+astika\" as one \"denying what exists\" or any school of philosophy that denies the existence of the soul. The Vedanta sub-traditions of Hinduism are \"astika\" because they accept the existence of soul, while Buddhist traditions denying this are referred to as \"nastika\".\n\nOne of the earliest mentions of \"astika\" concept in Jain texts is by Manibhadra, who states that an \"astika\" is one who \"accepts there exist another world (\"paraloka\"), transmigration of soul, virtue and vice that affect how a soul journeys through time\".\n\nThe 5th–6th century Jainism scholar Haribhadra, states Andrew Nicholson, does not mention anything about accepting or rejecting the Vedas or god as a criterion for being an \"astika\" or \"nastika\". Instead, Haribhadra explains \"nastika\" in the manner of the more ancient Jain scholar Manibhadra, by stating a nastika to be one \"who says there is no other worlds, there is no purpose in charity, there is no purpose in offerings\". An \"astika\", to Haribhadra, is one who believes that there is a purpose and merit in an ethical life such as \"ahimsa\" (non-violence) and ritual actions. This exposition of the word \"astika\" and \"nastika\" by Haribhadra is similar to one by the Sanskrit grammarian and Hindu scholar Pāṇini in section 4.4.60 of the \"Astadhyayi\".\n\nThe 12th century Jaina scholar Hemachandra similarly states, in his text \"Abhidhana Cintamani\", that a \"nastika\" is any philosophy that presumes or argues there is \"no virtue and vice\".\n\nNagarjuna, according to Chandradhar Sharma, equates \"Nastikya\" to \"nihilism\".\n\nThe 4th century Buddhist scholar Asanga, in \"Bodhisattva Bhumi\", calls \"nastika Buddhists\" as \"sarvavai nasika\", describing them as who are complete deniers. To Asanga, \"nastika\" are those who say \"nothing whatsoever exists\", and the worst kind of \"nastika\" are those who deny all designation and reality. Astika are those who accept merit in and practice a religious life. According to Andrew Nicholson, later Buddhists understood Asanga to be targeting Madhyamaka Buddhism as \"nastika\", while considering his own Yogacara Buddhist tradition to be \"astika\". Initial interpretations of the Buddhist texts with the term \"astika\" and \"nastika\", such as those composed by Nagarjuna and Asvaghosa, were interpreted as being directed at the Hindu traditions. But, states John Kelly, most later scholarship considers this as incorrect, and that the \"astika\" and \"nastika\" terms were directed towards the competing Buddhist traditions and the intended audience of the texts were Buddhist monks debating an array of ideas across various Buddhist traditions.\n\nThe charges of being a \"nastika\" were serious threat to the social standing of a Buddhist, and could lead to expulsion from Buddhist monastic community. Thus, states Nicholson, the colonial era Indologist definition of astika and nastika schools of Indian philosophy, was based on a narrow study of literature such as a version of \"Manusmriti\", while in truth these terms are more complex and contextually apply within the diverse schools of Indian philosophies.\n\nThe most common meaning of astika and nastika, in Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism was the acceptance and adherence to ethical premises, and not textual validity or doctrinal premises, states Nicholson. It is likely that astika was translated as orthodox, and nastika as heterodox, because the early European Indologists carried the baggage of Christian theological traditions and extrapolated their own concepts to Asia, thereby distorting the complexity of Indian traditions and thought.\n\n"}
