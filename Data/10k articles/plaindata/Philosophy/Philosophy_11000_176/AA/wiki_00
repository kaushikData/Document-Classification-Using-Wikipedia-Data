{"id": "38372234", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38372234", "title": "After Capitalism: Economic Democracy in Action", "text": "After Capitalism: Economic Democracy in Action\n\nAfter Capitalism: Economic Democracy in Action is a 2012 book by United States author Dada Maheshvarananda, an activist, yoga monk and writer. The book argues that global capitalism is terminally ill because it suffers from four fatal flaws: growing inequity and concentration of wealth, addiction to speculation instead of production, rising unsustainable debt and its tendency to exploit the natural environment. The author proposes a grassroots movement for economic democracy with cooperatives and local economies based on the Progressive Utilization Theory or Prout, a post-capitalist model conceptualized by Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar of India. The book includes a conversation with Noam Chomsky and essays by Frei Betto, Johan Galtung, Leonardo Boff, Sohail Inayatullah, Marcos Arruda, Ravi Batra and others.\n\nThe author's first book, \"After Capitalism: Prout’s Vision for a New World\", with a preface by Noam Chomsky, was published in 2003 and, subsequently, translated into nine other languages. However, when the author started to update it, he discovered that both the world and the development of Prout had changed so much that more than 80 percent of the text was actually new material. Beyond this, economic democracy, a fundamental demand of Prout, was also starting to resonate with the Indignados Movement of Spain and the global Occupy Movement. Hence this book has a new title.\n\nChapter 1: The Failure of Global Capitalism and Economic Depressions: A brief review of colonialism, the economics of the Cold War, common practices by multinational corporations, the Global Financial Crisis of the 2000s, economic depressions and global capitalism’s four fatal flaws. \"How to Live Through Economic Turmoil\" by Mark A. Friedman.\n\nChapter 2: A New Social Paradigm Based on Spiritual Values: An ecological and spiritual perspective, Prout’s philosophical base, universal spirituality, the concept of Cosmic Inheritance, the problems with materialism, and Neohumanism. Definition of social progress, definition of the dynamic web of life or “Pramá”, how it is lost and how it can be restored. The benefits of meditation for activists. \"The Importance of Prout and its Concept of Pramá\" by Dr. Leonardo Boff.\n\nChapter 3: The Right to Live!: The minimum necessities of life guaranteed to all, pharmaceutical corporations vs. generic medicines, comparing Prout to Marxism, Communism and Participatory Economics. The Five Fundamental Principles of Prout and how they can be used to evaluate social policies, factors that motivate people to work and economic indicators for setting the minimum and maximum wages. \"Striving to Achieve Affordable Health Care for All in Kenya\" by Didi Ananda Rucira.\n\nChapter 4: Economic Democracy: Industry, commerce and service in three levels, how to provide housing for all, economic decentralization and socio-economic regions, comparing the welfare economics of Amartya Sen to Prout. Barter trade, Prout’s monetary system, taxation, \"A Proutist Response to Land Value Capture\" by Dr. John Gross.\n\nChapter 5: Cooperatives for a Better World: Human nature competitive or cooperative? Successful cooperatives around the world, the Mondragón cooperatives, how worker cooperatives function, what makes cooperatives successful? Examples of small-scale cooperatives in Maleny, Australia and the Venezuelan cooperative experience.\n\nChapter 6: An Agrarian Revolution and Environmental Protection: The deepening crisis in agriculture, food sovereignty, Prout’s agrarian revolution, agricultural cooperatives, ideal farming and the benefits of growing your own food. Agro- and Agrico-Industries, the benefits of a balanced economy. Prout Master Units, community supported agriculture (CSA), the Food, Farms and Jobs program of Illinois. Endangered rainforests, forest preservation strategies, tribal knowledge of medicinal plants, the Future Vision Ecological Park in Brazil and a block-level planning exercise.\n\nChapter 7: A New Perspective on Class, Class Struggle and Revolution: History and the Social Cycle, bloodless revolution and armed struggle, a new vision of history. The Sarkar Game. The exploitation of women throughout history and today, and the awakening of women. \"Comparing the Class Analysis of Marx and Sarkar\" by Dr. Ravi Batra and \"Prout’s Social Cycle\" by Dr. Johan Galtung.\n\nChapter 8: Spiritual Revolutionaries: Sarkar’s vision of Sadvipras, spiritual activism, facing our shadows. Goodness, evil and how to train heroes. Emotionally intelligent leaders and how to inspire others and yourself. \"Becoming Sadvipras\" by Satya Tanner and \"Prout Lessons from Development Work in West Africa\" by Dada Daneshananda.\n\nChapter 9: A New Concept of Ethics And Justice: Increase in violent crime, ethics for personal and social transformation, cardinal human values as the basis for legal justice, restorative justice and re-education centers for personal transformation, transforming prisoners through yoga and meditation, drug abuse as a health issue.\n\nChapter 10: “Our Culture is Our Strength!” Cultural Identity and Education: Psychic exploitation, culture, civilization and pseudo-culture, an educational revolution, Neohumanist schools, local and global languages, mass movements and guerrilla street theater. \"Future Tasmania\" by Liila Hass and \"Using Prout to Evaluate and Support a Community Samaja Movement: The Maya of Panimatzalam, Guatemala\" by Dr. Matt Oppenheim\n\nChapter 11: Prout’s Governance: Different views on governance, democratic reforms, constitutional proposals based on Prout, a universal bill of rights, world government. \"Transformative Strategies and the Futures of the Prout Movement\" by Dr. Sohail Inayatullah.\n\nChapter 12: A Call to Action: Strategies for Implementing Prout: “Another World is Possible!”\nOrganizing marginalized farmers, how to be an ideal activist. The Prout Research Institute of Venezuela and the Prout Institute (Eugene, Oregon, USA).

Hope for the future.\n\nChapter 13: A Conversation with Noam Chomsky: About The Occupy Movement, economic democracy and cooperatives, limiting the accumulation of wealth, consciousness raising, and Latin America.\n\nAfterword: \"The Possibility of Creating Another World is in Our Hands\" by Frei Betto.\n\nAppendices: Discussion questions about the book, designing Prout Study Action Circles, Prout slogans.\n\nBill Ayers in Left Eye on Books wrote, “In just a few pages I felt the brotherly embrace of a comrade-in-arms, a soul-mate, and a companion; further along his fierce intelligence and original insights challenged me to make new connections; by the end I was inspired to re-imagine next steps in my own efforts at movement-making.” Gar Alperovitz, author of America Beyond Capitalism, wrote, \"An ambitious and stimulating attempt to connect spiritual principles with the pragmatic work of building a better world.\" Gregory Wilpert, author of \"Changing Venezuela by Taking Power\", wrote, \"After Capitalism is a crucial contribution towards figuring out where we want to go, not only after capitalism, but now, as we try to build the new world within the old.\" Ecologist Bill McKibben wrote, \"There are plenty of interesting leads in these pages that will get you thinking!\" George Katsiaficas, activist and author of \"Asia's Unknown Uprisings\", wrote: \"With grace and intelligence, Dada Maheshvarananda illuminates paths of personal enlightenment and global transformation.\" Charles Eisenstein, author of \"Sacred Economics\", wrote, \"A broad ecological, social, political and spiritual awareness informs this vision of a new economic future.\" David Schweickart, author of another book entitled \"After Capitalism\", wrote, \"This is an amazing book, breathtaking in its range and ambition.\" Peter Bohmer, activist and faculty at the Evergreen State College, wrote, “I enthusiastically recommend this book for a college classroom and for those who are organizing for economic and social justice.”\n\nJeff Fleischer in ForeWord Reviews wrote, \"Most of the book is simply an explanation of Prout, and has the same strengths and weaknesses of the theory itself. While many of the goals advocated by Maheshvarananda and Prout supporters—such as diminishing income inequality and promoting citizen cooperatives—are certainly admirable, the theory is often vague about how they would be achieved or what a transition to a Prout economy would look like on a large scale... Too often, After Capitalism will seem naively unrealistic to opponents of Prout's vision while simultaneously obscure and lacking in specifics for those who would like to see its principles applied... Maheshvarananda is more effective in his critique of how current economic systems have created global wealth inequality, and at citing statistics for how poverty has spread even in wealthier nations. The most interesting parts of the book, however, are the guest contributions, which serve as case studies of using Prout principles in specific, smaller-scale projects around the world. While these contributions are quite short, they offer some of the detail lacking in the overall treatise.\"\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1989006", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1989006", "title": "Agostino Steuco", "text": "Agostino Steuco\n\nAgostino Steuco (in Latin Agostinus Steuchus or Eugubinus) (1497/1498–1548), Italian humanist, Old Testament scholar, Counter Reformation polemicist and antiquarian, was born at Gubbio in Umbria.\n\nIn 1513 he entered the congregation of the Order of the Augustinian Canons of San Salvatore of Bologna, taking up residence in the monastery of San Secundo, one of the order's houses in Gubbio. In 1524 he went to the mother cloister in Bologna, from where he briefly attended courses in Hebrew and rhetoric at the University of Bologna. In 1525 he was sent by his congregation to the Monastery of Sant' Antonio di Castello in Venice, where, due to his expertise in biblical languages and humanist textual criticism, he was placed in charge of the monastery's library, donated to the canons by Cardinal Domenico Grimani. Many of the collection's biblical, Hebrew, and philosophical works had once been owned by Pico della Mirandola.\n\nOver the next several years (1529–33) Steuco wrote a series of polemical works against Luther and Erasmus, the latter of whom he accused of helping to foment the Protestant Revolt against the Church. These works show Steuco's staunch support of the traditions and practices of the Church, including a strident defense of papal authority. Part of his output during this period included a major set of annotations on the Pentateuch, titled \"\", in which he used Hebrew and Greek manuscripts from the Grimani Library to correct Jerome's Vulgate translation of the Old Testament text. When explaining the text, he never strayed from the literal and historical meaning. An interesting juxtaposition to this work of humanist biblical exegesis was a syncretic philosophical work that he wrote in this period, to which he gave the title \"Cosmopoeia\".\n\nHis polemical and exegetical works attracted the notice of Pope Paul III, and in 1538 the pope made Steuco bishop of Chisamo on the island of Crete, and librarian of the papal collection of manuscripts and printed works in the Vatican. While he never visited his bishopric in Crete, Steuco did actively fulfill his role as Vatican Librarian until his death in 1548. While in Rome he authored Old Testament annotations on the Psalms and Job, again relying heavily upon Hebrew sources to help annotate and correct the texts.\n\nIn 1540 he published a major work entitled \"\", which attempted to show that many of the ideas expounded by the sages, poets, and philosophers from classical antiquity were in essential harmony with Christianity. Since Marsilio Ficino and Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, this was a common thread in Renaissance thought which spread from Italy to France and Germany, but this was the first book devoted to the subject. Steuco believed that Roman Catholicism, centred on the Gospels, is the true hidden core of pagan beliefs; Theobald Freudenberger commented that \"If a [ancient] passage really refuses to fit into his system, he earnestly addresses the author and admonishes him in a fatherly way to come to his senses.\" This work has a slight polemical edge to it, as Steuco crafted a number of his arguments to lend support to several theological positions that had recently come under question in Italy by reformers and critics of the traditional Catholic faith. His perspective has been described by Maria Muccillo: \n\nAs a Roman humanist, he also took a deep interest in the classical ruins of Rome, and in the urban renewal efforts of Paul III throughout the city. Of particular note in this vein are a series of short orations that he wrote and possibly delivered at the papal court, urging Paul III to refurbish the aqueduct known as the Aqua Virgo, in order to supply Rome with adequate fresh water, and as a major key to the revitalization of the city itself.\n\nIn 1547 Steuco was sent by Paul III to attend the Council of Trent, where he could be counted upon to uphold papal prerogatives and authority. He died in 1548 while in Venice on break from the Council. He is now buried in Gubbio.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "17313159", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17313159", "title": "Argument from reason", "text": "Argument from reason\n\nThe argument from reason is an argument against naturalism and for the existence of God (or at least a supernatural being that is the source of human reason). The best-known defender of the argument is C. S. Lewis. Lewis first defended the argument at length in his 1947 book, \"Miracles: A Preliminary Study\". In the second edition of \"Miracles\" (1960), Lewis substantially revised and expanded the argument.\n\nContemporary defenders of the argument from reason include Alvin Plantinga, Victor Reppert and William Harker.\n\nMethodological naturalism is the view that nature as studied by the natural sciences is all that exists. Naturalists deny the existence of a supernatural God, souls, an afterlife, or anything supernatural. Nothing exists outside or beyond the physical universe.\n\nThe argument from reason seeks to show that naturalism is self-refuting, or otherwise false and indefensible.\n\nAccording to Lewis,\n\nMore precisely, Lewis's argument from reason can be stated as follows:\n\n1. No belief is rationally inferred if it can be fully explained in terms of nonrational causes. \n\nSupport: Reasoning requires insight into logical relations. A process of reasoning (P therefore Q) is rational only if the reasoner sees that Q follows from, or is supported by, P, and accepts Q on that basis. Thus, reasoning is trustworthy (or \"valid\", as Lewis sometimes says) only if it involves a special kind of causality, namely, rational insight into logical implication or evidential support. If a bit of reasoning can be fully explained by nonrational causes, such as fibers firing in the brain or a bump on the head, then the reasoning is not reliable, and cannot yield knowledge. Consider this example: Person A refuses to go near the neighbor’s dog because he had a bad childhood experience with dogs. Person B refuses to go near the neighbor’s dog because one month ago he saw it attack someone. Both have given a reason for staying away from the dog, but person A’s reason is the result of nonrational causes, while person B has given an explanation for his behavior following from rational inference (animals exhibit patterns of behavior; these patterns are likely to be repeated; this dog has exhibited aggression towards someone who approached it; there is a good chance that the dog may exhibit the same behavior towards me if I approach it). Consider a second example: person A says that he is afraid to climb to the 8th story of a bank building because he and humans in general have a natural fear of heights resulting from the processes of evolution and natural selection. He has given an explanation of his fear, but since his fear results from nonrational causes (natural selection), his argument does not follow from logical inference.\n2. If naturalism is true, then all beliefs can be fully explained in terms of nonrational causes. \nSupport: Naturalism holds that nature is all that exists, and that all events in nature can in principle be explained without invoking supernatural or other nonnatural causes. Standardly, naturalists claim that all events must have physical causes, and that human thoughts can ultimately be explained in terms of material causes or physical events (such as neurochemical events in the brain) that are nonrational.\n3. Therefore, if naturalism is true, then no belief is rationally inferred (from 1 and 2). \n4. We have good reason to accept naturalism only if it can be rationally inferred from good evidence. \n\n5. Therefore, there is not, and cannot be, good reason to accept naturalism.\nIn short, naturalism undercuts itself. If naturalism is true, then we cannot sensibly believe it or virtually anything else.\n\nIn some versions of the argument from reason, Lewis extends the argument to defend a further conclusion: that human reason depends on an eternal, self-existent rational Being (God). This extension of the argument from reason states:\n\n1. Since everything in nature can be wholly explained in terms of nonrational causes, human reason (more precisely, the power of drawing conclusions based solely on the rational cause of logical insight) must have a source outside of nature.\n\n2. If human reason came from non-reason it would lose all rational credentials and would cease to be reason.\n\n3. So, human reason cannot come from non-reason (from 2).\n\n4. So human reason must come from a source outside nature that is itself rational (from 1 and 3).\n\n5. This supernatural source of reason may itself be dependent on some further source of reason, but a chain of such dependent sources cannot go on forever. Eventually, we must reason back to the existence of eternal, non-dependent source of human reason.\n\n6. Therefore, there exists an eternal, self-existent, rational Being who is the ultimate source of human reason. This Being we call God (from 4-5). (Lewis, \"Miracles\", chap. 4)\n\nOn 2 February 1948, Oxford philosopher Elizabeth Anscombe read a paper to the Oxford Socratic Club criticizing the version of the argument from reason contained in the third chapter of Lewis's \"Miracles\".\n\nHer first criticism was against the use of the word \"irrational\" by Lewis (Anscombe 1981: 225-26). Her point was that there is an important difference between irrational causes of belief, such as wishful thinking, and nonrational causes, such as neurons firing in the brain, that do not obviously lead to faulty reasoning. Lewis accepted the criticism and amended the argument, basing it on the concept of nonrational causes of belief (as in the version provided in this article).\n\nAnscombe's second criticism questioned the intelligibility of Lewis's intended contrast between \"valid\" and \"invalid\" reasoning. She wrote: \"What \"can\" you mean by 'valid' beyond what would be indicated by the explanation you would give for distinguishing between valid and invalid, and what in the naturalistic hypothesis prevents that explanation from being given and from meaning what it does?\" (Anscombe 1981: 226) Her point is that it makes no sense to contrast \"valid\" and \"invalid\" reasoning unless it is possible for some forms of reasoning to be valid. Lewis later conceded (Anscombe 1981: 231) that \"valid\" was a bad word for what he had in mind. Lewis didn't mean to suggest that if naturalism is true, no arguments can be given in which the conclusions follow logically from the premises. What he meant is that a process of reasoning is \"veridical\", that is, reliable as a method of pursuing knowledge and truth, only if it cannot be entirely explained by nonrational causes.\n\nAnscombe's third objection was that Lewis failed to distinguish between different senses of the terms \"why\", \"because\", and \"explanation\", and that what counts as a \"full\" explanation varies by context (Anscombe 1981: 227-31). In the context of ordinary life, \"because he wants a cup of tea\" may count as a perfectly satisfactory explanation of why Peter is boiling water. Yet such a purposive explanation would not count as a full explanation (or an explanation at all) in the context of physics or biochemistry. Lewis accepted this criticism, and created a revised version of the argument in which the distinction between \"because\" in the sense of physical causality, and \"because\" in the sense of evidential support, became the central point of the argument. (This is the version described in this article.)\n\nMore recent critics have argued that Lewis's argument at best refutes only strict forms of naturalism that seek to explain everything in terms ultimately reducible to physics or purely mechanistic causes. So-called \"broad\" naturalists that see consciousness as an \"emergent\" non-physical property of complex brains would agree with Lewis that different levels or types of causation exist in nature, and that rational inferences are not fully explainable by nonrational causes.\n\nOther critics have objected that Lewis's argument from reason fails because the causal origins of beliefs are often irrelevant to whether those beliefs are rational, justified, warranted, etc. Anscombe, for example, argues that \"if a man has reasons, and they are good reasons, and they are genuinely his reasons, for thinking something—then his thought is rational, whatever causal statements we make about him\" (Anscombe 1981: 229). On many widely accepted theories of knowledge and justification, questions of how beliefs were ultimately caused (e.g., at the level of brain neurochemistry) are viewed as irrelevant to whether those beliefs are rational or justified. Some defenders of Lewis claim that this objection misses the mark, because his argument is directed at what he calls the \"veridicalness\" of acts of reasoning (i.e., whether reasoning connects us with objective reality or truth), rather than with whether any inferred beliefs can be rational or justified in a materialistic world.\n\nPhilosophers such as Victor Reppert, William Hasker and Alvin Plantinga have expanded on the argument from reason, and credit C.S. Lewis as an important influence on their thinking.\n\nLewis never claimed that he invented the argument from reason; in fact, he refers to it as a \"venerable philosophical chestnut.\" Early versions of the argument occur in the works of Arthur Balfour (see, e.g., \"The Foundations of Belief\", 1879, chap. 13) and G.K. Chesterton. In Chesterton's 1908 book \"Orthodoxy\", in a chapter titled \"The Suicide of Thought\", he writes of the \"great and possible peril . . . that the human intellect is free to destroy itself...It is idle to talk always of the alternative of reason and faith. It is an act of faith to assert that our thoughts have any relation to reality at all. If you are merely a sceptic, you must sooner or later ask yourself the question, \"Why should anything go right; even observation and deduction? Why should not good logic be as misleading as bad logic? They are both movements in the brain of a bewildered ape?\"\n\nSimilarly, Chesterton asserts that the argument is a fundamental, if unstated, tenet of Thomism in his 1933 book \"St. Thomas Aquinas: \"The Dumb Ox\"\":\nThus, even those who appreciate the metaphysical depth of Thomism in other matters have expressed surprise that he does not deal at all with what many now think the main metaphysical question; whether we can prove that the primary act of recognition of any reality is real. The answer is that St. Thomas recognised instantly, what so many modern sceptics have begun to suspect rather laboriously; that a man must either answer that question in the affirmative, or else never answer any question, never ask any question, never even exist intellectually, to answer or to ask. I suppose it is true in a sense that a man can be a fundamental sceptic, but he cannot be anything else: certainly not even a defender of fundamental scepticism. If a man feels that all the movements of his own mind are meaningless, then his mind is meaningless, and he is meaningless; and it does not mean anything to attempt to discover his meaning. Most fundamental sceptics appear to survive, because they are not consistently sceptical and not at all fundamental. They will first deny everything and then admit something, if for the sake of argument--or often rather of attack without argument. I saw an almost startling example of this essential frivolity in a professor of final scepticism, in a paper the other day. A man wrote to say that he accepted nothing but Solipsism, and added that he had often wondered it was not a more common philosophy. Now Solipsism simply means that a man believes in his own existence, but not in anybody or anything else. And it never struck this simple sophist, that if his philosophy was true, there obviously were no other philosophers to profess it.\n\nIn \"Miracles\", Lewis himself quotes J. B. S. Haldane, who appeals to a similar line of reasoning in his 1927 book, \"Possible Worlds\": \"If my mental processes are determined wholly by the motions of atoms in my brain, I have no reason to suppose that my beliefs are true ... and hence I have no reason for supposing my brain to be composed of atoms.\"\n\nOther versions of the argument from reason occur in C.E.M. Joad's \"Guide to Modern Philosophy\" (London: Faber, 1933, pp. 58–59), Richard Taylor's \"Metaphysics\" (Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall, 3rd ed., 1983, pp. 104–05), and J. P. Moreland's \"Scaling the Secular City: A Defense of Christianity\" (Grand Rapids, MI: Baker, 1987, chap. 3).\n\n"}

The organisation was founded in 1979 by the German Waldorf teacher Ute Craemer together with the residents of the Favela Monte Azul. In the 1980s the work spread to the Favela Peinha nearby and to Horizonte Azul on the southern edge of the city. The project is a successful example in sustainable Development cooperation between equal partners.\n\nThe organisation's main areas of work are slum renovation, Education and further education for children and young people, culture, health care and environmental conservation. The Associação Comunitária Monte Azul today has more than 260 employees and receives around 70 overseas volunteers per year, 20 of these from other countries, in particular Germany.\n\nThe Favela Monte Azul, which has around 3000 residents, was established in the 1970s during the period of rapid urbanisation due to the rural depopulation from North-eastern Brazil and the provinces Minas Gerais and Paraná. Through the project, by means of which Ute Craemer wished to awaken some social awareness amongst her students at the Waldorf school, she came into contact with the children of the Favela. It began with afternoon care in Ms Craemer's own home. Out of this impulse to build a bridge between the different classes of Society, a project began that is still growing and continually incorporates new aspects. At present there are an estimated 32,000 people benefitting from the work of Monte Azul.\n\nMonte Azul has become an example for Development Aid and a model for many similar social projects that have come about in Brazil, such as the street theatre group \"Paidéia\", the cultural and social centre Aramitán in São Paulo oder the NGO Associação Comunitária de Barra de Lama. Northern Brazil.\n\nThere are some 1350 children and young people between the ages of four months and 21 years being cared for by the créches, nursery schools, training workshops and a local Waldorf school, the work being based on the principles of Waldorf education and Anthroposophy. A further 80 people with Special Needs are cared for in another training workshop. One of the principles of the \"Associação Comunitária Monte Azul\" is to not just communicate knowledge but rather to facilitate a comprehensive education for their children and young people that enables them to take their lives into their own hands, encouraging them to change the harsh realities that surround them.\n\nThrough re-enlivening and cultivating local cultural traditions the feeling of self-worth and confidence of the people is strengthened. Through meeting with foreign cultures their horizon is broadened, their consciousness stimulated and they nurture a culture based on peace. In all of its three centres, Monte Azul has theatre and conference rooms as well as libraries so as to give people access to cultural content. A variety of courses, further education, theatrical and musical events take place there, with around 600 people a month participating.\n\nBesides this, they run a music school where children and young people from the Favela are able to learn string instruments, to play in an orchestra and to sing in the choir.\n\nFrom the start it was essential to further educate and train the co-workers, for they themselves had grown up in the Favela. In this way a culture of study and further education developed that has become a hallmark of Monte Azul.\n\nThere is a three-year in-service training programme in Waldorf education that they call by the Indian name for the hummingbird: “Mainumby”. In this way the co-workers of public organisations can train as Waldorf teachers for the accreditation of which they are currently in negotiation with the Brazilian government. In this way the \"Associação Comunitaria Monte Azul\" has become a gathering point for socially engaged people and educators. Basic training, internships, research and publication of didactic material and books, couselling in organisational, financial and professional issues for social workers, mentoring of university theses and other areas are increasingly a part of their professional involvement. A project in environmental education was implemented in collaboration with UNESCO as well as a pilot project in establishing women’s co-operatives. Besides this, each co-worker, also those with a university degree, does an apprenticeship in social work with the principle of lifelong learning in mind.\n\nIn Monte Azul’s \"Ambulatório\" or clinic, the residents of the Favela as well as those of the neighbouring communities receive treatment free of charge. General practitioners, pediatricians, orthopaedic surgeons, dentists, psychologists and psychiatrists are available for consultation. Treatment takes place on a holistic basis extended through anthroposophical medicine.\n\nIn the \"Casa Angela\", a maternity home and centre for mother-and-child health care, women and their families receive medical care and guidance through pregnancy, birth and pre and ante-natal issues throughout the first year of the child. The Casa Angela is the first officially licensed birthing centre in Brazil. It aims to improve the poor level of obstetrics care for low-income families and resist the extremely high rate of caesarians in Brazil.\n\nThe \"Casa da Trilha\" treats people with addiction and psychiatric problems. Besides this, Monte Azul is a partner of the city of São Paulo in the programme \"Estratégia Saúde da Família\", being responsible for the municipality of São Luís in which live some 320,000 people. The aim of the programme is to try to improve the general medical care of the population.\n\nFrom the beginning, environmental awareness played a central role. Fruit and vegetables are grown in Horizonte Azul without the use of pesticides and are delivered to the kitchens at Monte Azul, ensuring a balanced and healthy diet for the children.\n\nBy organising community projects the residents of Monte Azul cleared the area of garbage, introduced re-cycling and built a sewerage system. In spite of there being no municipal re-cycling the Favela independently runs a centre where garbage collectors (\"Catadores\") can deliver their waste. They have entered into a collaboration on waste research with the Technical University of Berlin.\n\nIn all three areas of activity of the Associação there are stage and dance performances, musical and other artistic presentations. In the \"Centro Cultural Monte Azul\" the residents of the Favela and neighbouring suburbs direct their own productions. They can attend concerts, plays and shows of well-known Brazilian and international artists, usually about eight to ten per month.\n\nBesides the productions, courses in dance and sport are offered. Associação hires drama teachers and actors who stage professional productions in theatre workshops with the Favela residents that they normally perform twice a year.\n\nOnce a month all 260 co-workers meet (without the co-workers of the primary health care centres) in one of the three Favelas, mostly in the Cultural Centre of Monte Azul for enrichment and art courses and for cultural exchange. Mostly something from the work of Waldorf education is presented and performed. New co-workers and new international volunteers are welcomed or wished goodbye if their period of service has come to an end.\n\nThrough these regular meetings a feeling of community and the vision of its activities is cultivated and through creative activities new solutions are found for existing problems. Every second week the co-workers of each Favela meet internally for an afternoon of similar activities.\n\nTo a large extent the organisation has been structured without a hierarchy and is led by a process of consensus. This means that all co-workers can be a party to decisions and take responsibility for the whole. Within this structure aspects of Joseph Beuys’s “Social Sculpture\" and the ideas on Social threefolding of Rudolf Steiner are realised. In this sense each co-worker is free within his or her own sphere of work and can shape it in the manner he or she feels comfortable with. In addition, further work on Waldorf education is studied.\n\n\n\n"}

Despite his love of philosophy, d'Espagnat focused on science and mathematics, believing that advances in philosophy would require the knowledge and practice of contemporary science.\n\nIn 1939, as d'Espagnat made plans to enter the Ecole Polytechnique, World War II put his education on hold.\n\nD'Espagnat obtained his Ph.D. from the Sorbonne at the Institut Henri Poincaré under the guidance of Louis de Broglie.

He then pursued his scientific career as the first theoretical physicist, at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Geneva, 1954-59.\n\nFrom 1959 until his retirement in 1987, D'Espagnat was a senior lecturer at the Faculty of Sciences at the Sorbonne University. He was director of the Laboratory of Theoretical Physics and Elementary Particles at the University of Paris XI (Orsay), 1980-87. He was a visiting professor at the University of Texas at Austin in 1977, and at the University of California - Santa Barbara in 1984.\n\nHe has been a member of the Brussels International Academy of the Philosophy of Science since 1975, and of the French Academy of Moral and Political Sciences since 1996. His experiments with Bell's inequalities to further his concept of veiled reality won the attention of the John Templeton Foundation. D'Espagnat became the 2009 Templeton Prize winner in March for his \"work which acknowledges that science cannot fully explain 'the nature of being.'\"\n\nD'Espagnat remained troubled by the scant attention most physicists paid to the interpretational questions raised by quantum mechanics. His first book, \"Conceptions of Contemporary Physics\" (1965), asked these questions and sketched possible resolutions, underscoring his insistence that scientists face the issues raised by their own pursuits.\n\nSubsequently, d'Espagnat was an early interpreter of the deep philosophical significance of experimental research agendas in quantum physics. In his 1979 Scientific American article, \"The Quantum Theory and Reality,\" and best-selling 1979 book, \"À la recherche du réel, le regard d'un physicien\" (\"In Search of Reality, the Outlook of a Physicist\"), he encouraged physicists and philosophers to think afresh about questions long considered marginal but which today serve as the foundation for new fields of research into the nature of reality.\n\nIn \"Le réel voilé, analyse des concepts quantiques\" (\"Veiled Reality, An Analysis of Present-Day Quantum Mechanical Concepts\"), d'Espagnat coined the term \"veiled reality\" and explained why significant experiments over the past decade had not restored conventional realism. \"On Physics and Philosophy\" (published in France in 2002 as \"Traité de physique et de philosophie\") was hailed as \"surely the most complete book to have been written on this subject and one likely to last a long time…\" by Roland Omnès. His most recent book is \"Candide et le physicien\" (\"Candide and the Physicist\"), written with Claude Saliceti and published in 2008, a layperson's guide that answers 50 questions which pinpoint and correct preconceived ideas of contemporary physics and examine the many conceptual and philosophical changes those ideas reveal.\n\n"}

He has held academic positions at Amherst College, Georgetown University, Princeton University, and Columbia University. In addition, he served as the principal consultant to PBS and the BBC for their award-winning series \"The Brain\" and \"The Mind\", and he lectured for The Great Courses' series on Philosophy. He is on the Board of Consulting Scholars of Princeton University's James Madison Program in American Ideals and Institutions and is a Senior Fellow of BYU's Wheatley Institution. In 2011 he received the Gittler Award from the American Psychological Association for significant contributions to the philosophical foundations of Psychology. \"\n\nRobinson’s interests range over the brain sciences, philosophy, law and intellectual history. Several of his works are illustrative of these interests. Regarded as a classic in its field, his \"An Intellectual History of Psychology\" was praised by Ernest Hilgard for its “…development of ideas as they provide alternative perspectives on the nature of mind…The reader is carried along on a genuine intellectual adventure.\"\nRobinson’s enduring interest in Aristotle’s thought is summarized in \"Aristotle’s Psychology\", which Deborah Modrak described as “Easy to read and informative” predicting that it would “no doubt prompt readers to reflect on the relevance of Aristotle’s work to modern psychology…” (International Studies in Philosophy, Volume 23, Issue 3, 1991; pp. 142–143). In this connection, Robinson was among the small group assembled by Martin Seligman in 1999 to develop the framework for Positive Psychology.\n\nIn \"Wild Beasts and Idle Humours\", Robinson offers a treatise on the relationship between science and jurisprudence as this developed from ancient to contemporary times. Michael Perlin describes the book as “truly unique. It synthesizes material that I do not believe has ever been considered in this context, and links up the historical past with contemporaneous values and politics. Robinson effortlessly weaves religious history, literary history, medical history, and political history, and demonstrates how the insanity defense cannot be fully understood without consideration of all these sources.” Robert Kinscherff states that it “…reads like the inner workings of a fascinating and disciplined narrative mind.”\n\nRobinson’s major work in moral philosophy is \"Praise and Blame: Moral Realism and Its Application\". Reviewing the book in Review of Metaphysics, Jude P. Dougherty writes, “The richness of this work cannot be comprehended in one reading. Whether the reader agrees or not with the author, one has much to learn from the profundity of Robinson's insight into the framing of moral judgment”. (Rev. Metaphys., 2003, vol. 56, 899-900.)\n\nCentral to Robinson’s concerns are the conceptual and philosophical foundations of psychology and related subjects. Of Robinson’s \"Philosophy of Psychology\", William Dray wrote that “this highly readable book squarely addresses fundamental metaphysical, epistemological and methodological problems…His clear and informed treatment…offers salutary challenge to much conventional wisdom on the nature and prospects of psychological science.”\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "41468418", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41468418", "title": "Evolution of photosynthesis", "text": "Evolution of photosynthesis\n\nThe evolution of photosynthesis refers to the origin and subsequent evolution of photosynthesis, the process by which light energy synthesizes sugars from carbon dioxide, releasing oxygen as a waste product. The process of photosynthesis was discovered by Jan Ingenhousz, a Dutch-born British physician and scientist, first publishing about it in 1779.\n\nThe first photosynthetic organisms probably evolved early in the evolutionary history of life and most likely used reducing agents such as hydrogen or electrons, rather than water. There are three major metabolic pathways by which photosynthesis is carried out: C photosynthesis, C photosynthesis, and CAM photosynthesis. C photosynthesis is the oldest and most common form. C3 is a plant that uses the calvin cycle for the initial steps that incorporate CO2 into organic material. C4 is a plant that prefaces the calvin cycle with reactions that incorporate CO2 into four-carbon compounds. CAM is a plant that uses crassulacean acid metabolism, an adaptation for photosynthesis in arid conditions. C4 and CAM Plants have special adaptations that save water.\n\nThe biochemical capacity to use water as the source for electrons in photosynthesis evolved in a common ancestor of extant cyanobacteria. The geological record indicates that this transforming event took place early in Earth's history, at least 2450–2320 million years ago (Ma), and, it is speculated, much earlier. Available evidence from geobiological studies of Archean (>2500 Ma) sedimentary rocks indicates that life existed 3500 Ma, but the question of when oxygenic photosynthesis evolved is still unanswered. A clear paleontological window on cyanobacterial evolution opened about 2000 Ma, revealing an already-diverse biota of blue-greens. Cyanobacteria remained principal primary producers throughout the Proterozoic Eon (2500–543 Ma), in part because the redox structure of the oceans favored photoautotrophs capable of nitrogen fixation. Green algae joined blue-greens as major primary producers on continental shelves near the end of the Proterozoic, but only with the Mesozoic (251–65 Ma) radiations of dinoflagellates, coccolithophorids, and diatoms did primary production in marine shelf waters take modern form. Cyanobacteria remain critical to marine ecosystems as primary producers in oceanic gyres, as agents of biological nitrogen fixation, and, in modified form, as the plastids of marine algae.\n\nEarly photosynthetic systems, such as those from green and purple sulfur and green and purple nonsulfur bacteria, are thought to have been anoxygenic, using various molecules as electron donors. Green and purple sulfur bacteria are thought to have used hydrogen and sulfur as an electron donor. Green nonsulfur bacteria used various amino and other organic acids. Purple nonsulfur bacteria used a variety of nonspecific organic molecules.\n\nFossils of what are thought to be filamentous photosynthetic organisms have been dated at 3.4 billion years old. More recent studies, reported in March 2018, also suggest that photosynthesis may have begun about 3.4 billion years ago.\n\nThe main source of oxygen in the atmosphere is oxygenic photosynthesis, and its first appearance is sometimes referred to as the oxygen catastrophe. Geological evidence suggests that oxygenic photosynthesis, such as that in cyanobacteria, became important during the Paleoproterozoic era around 2 billion years ago. Modern photosynthesis in plants and most photosynthetic prokaryotes is oxygenic. Oxygenic photosynthesis uses water as an electron donor, which is oxidized to molecular oxygen () in the photosynthetic reaction center.\n\nTimeline of Photosynthesis on Earth \nSeveral groups of animals have formed symbiotic relationships with photosynthetic algae. These are most common in corals, sponges and sea anemones. It is presumed that this is due to the particularly simple body plans and large surface areas of these animals compared to their volumes. In addition, a few marine mollusks \"Elysia viridis\" and \"Elysia chlorotica\" also maintain a symbiotic relationship with chloroplasts they capture from the algae in their diet and then store in their bodies. This allows the mollusks to survive solely by photosynthesis for several months at a time. Some of the genes from the plant cell nucleus have even been transferred to the slugs, so that the chloroplasts can be supplied with proteins that they need to survive.\n\nAn even closer form of symbiosis may explain the origin of chloroplasts. Chloroplasts have many similarities with photosynthetic bacteria, including a circular chromosome, prokaryotic-type ribosomes, and similar proteins in the photosynthetic reaction center. The endosymbiotic theory suggests that photosynthetic bacteria were acquired (by endocytosis) by early eukaryotic cells to form the first plant cells. Therefore, chloroplasts may be photosynthetic bacteria that adapted to life inside plant cells. Like mitochondria, chloroplasts still possess their own DNA, separate from the nuclear DNA of their plant host cells and the genes in this chloroplast DNA resemble those in cyanobacteria. DNA in chloroplasts codes for redox proteins such as photosynthetic reaction centers. The CoRR Hypothesis proposes that this Co-location is required for Redox Regulation.\n\nA 2010 study by researchers at Tel Aviv University discovered that the Oriental hornet (\"Vespa orientalis\") converts sunlight into electric power using a pigment called xanthopterin. This is the first scientific evidence of a member of the animal kingdom engaging in photosynthesis.\n\nPhotosynthesis is not quite as simple as adding water to to produce sugars and oxygen. A complex chemical pathway is involved, facilitated along the way by a range of enzymes and co-enzymes. The enzyme RuBisCO is responsible for \"fixing\"  – that is, it attaches it to a carbon-based molecule to form a sugar, which can be used by the plant, releasing an oxygen molecule along the way. However, the enzyme is notoriously inefficient, and just as effectively will also fix oxygen instead of in a process called photorespiration. This is energetically costly as the plant has to use energy to turn the products of photorespiration back into a form that can react with .\n\nThe C metabolic pathway is a valuable recent evolutionary innovation in plants, involving a complex set of adaptive changes to physiology and gene expression patterns. About 7600 species of plants use carbon fixation, which represents about 3% of all terrestrial species of plants. All these 7600 species are angiosperms.\n\nC plants evolved carbon concentrating mechanisms. These work by increasing the concentration of around RuBisCO, thereby facilitating photosynthesis and decreasing photorespiration. The process of concentrating around RuBisCO requires more energy than allowing gases to diffuse, but under certain conditions – i.e. warm temperatures (>25 °C), low concentrations, or high oxygen concentrations – pays off in terms of the decreased loss of sugars through photorespiration.\n\nOne type of C metabolism employs a so-called Kranz anatomy. This transports through an outer mesophyll layer, via a range of organic molecules, to the central bundle sheath cells, where the is released. In this way, is concentrated near the site of RuBisCO operation. Because RuBisCO is operating in an environment with much more than it otherwise would be, it performs more efficiently.\n\nA second mechanism, CAM photosynthesis, is a carbon fixation pathway that evolved in some plants as an adaptation to arid conditions. The most important benefit of CAM to the plant is the ability to leave most leaf stomata closed during the day. This reduces water loss due to evapotranspiration. The stomata open at night to collect , which is stored as the four-carbon acid malate, and then used during photosynthesis during the day. The pre-collected is concentrated around the enzyme RuBisCO, increasing photosynthetic efficiency. More is then harvested from the atmosphere when stomata open, during the cool, moist nights, reducing water loss.\n\nCAM has evolved convergently many times. It occurs in 16,000 species (about 7% of plants), belonging to over 300 genera and around 40 families, but this is thought to be a considerable underestimate. It is found in quillworts (relatives of club mosses), in ferns, and in gymnosperms, but the great majority of plants using CAM are angiosperms (flowering plants).\n\nThese two pathways, with the same effect on RuBisCO, evolved a number of times independently – indeed, C alone arose 62 times in 18 different plant families. A number of 'pre-adaptations' seem to have paved the way for C4, leading to its clustering in certain clades: it has most frequently been innovated in plants that already had features such as extensive vascular bundle sheath tissue. Many potential evolutionary pathways resulting in the phenotype are possible and have been characterised using Bayesian inference, confirming that non-photosynthetic adaptations often provide evolutionary stepping stones for the further evolution of .\n\nThe C construction is most famously used by a subset of grasses, while CAM is employed by many succulents and cacti. The trait appears to have emerged during the Oligocene, around ; however, they did not become ecologically significant until the Miocene, . Remarkably, some charcoalified fossils preserve tissue organised into the Kranz anatomy, with intact bundle sheath cells, allowing the presence C metabolism to be identified without doubt at this time. Isotopic markers are used to deduce their distribution and significance.\n\nC plants preferentially use the lighter of two isotopes of carbon in the atmosphere, C, which is more readily involved in the chemical pathways involved in its fixation. Because C metabolism involves a further chemical step, this effect is accentuated. Plant material can be analysed to deduce the ratio of the heavier C to C. This ratio is denoted . C plants are on average around 14‰ (parts per thousand) lighter than the atmospheric ratio, while C plants are about 28‰ lighter. The of CAM plants depends on the percentage of carbon fixed at night relative to what is fixed in the day, being closer to C plants if they fix most carbon in the day and closer to C plants if they fix all their carbon at night.\n\nIt is troublesome procuring original fossil material in sufficient quantity to analyse the grass itself, but fortunately there is a good proxy: horses. Horses were globally widespread in the period of interest, and browsed almost exclusively on grasses. There's an old phrase in isotope palæontology, \"you are what you eat (plus a little bit)\" – this refers to the fact that organisms reflect the isotopic composition of whatever they eat, plus a small adjustment factor. There is a good record of horse teeth throughout the globe, and their has been measured. The record shows a sharp negative inflection around , during the Messinian, and this is interpreted as the rise of C plants on a global scale.\n\nWhile C enhances the efficiency of RuBisCO, the concentration of carbon is highly energy intensive. This means that C plants only have an advantage over C organisms in certain conditions: namely, high temperatures and low rainfall. C plants also need high levels of sunlight to thrive. Models suggest that, without wildfires removing shade-casting trees and shrubs, there would be no space for C plants. But, wildfires have occurred for 400 million years – why did C take so long to arise, and then appear independently so many times? The Carboniferous period (~) had notoriously high oxygen levels – almost enough to allow spontaneous combustion – and very low , but there is no C isotopic signature to be found. And there doesn't seem to be a sudden trigger for the Miocene rise.\n\nDuring the Miocene, the atmosphere and climate were relatively stable. If anything, increased gradually from before settling down to concentrations similar to the Holocene. This suggests that it did not have a key role in invoking C evolution. Grasses themselves (the group which would give rise to the most occurrences of C) had probably been around for 60 million years or more, so had had plenty of time to evolve C, which, in any case, is present in a diverse range of groups and thus evolved independently. There is a strong signal of climate change in South Asia; increasing aridity – hence increasing fire frequency and intensity – may have led to an increase in the importance of grasslands. However, this is difficult to reconcile with the North American record. It is possible that the signal is entirely biological, forced by the fire- and grazer- driven acceleration of grass evolution – which, both by increasing weathering and incorporating more carbon into sediments, reduced atmospheric levels. Finally, there is evidence that the onset of C from is a biased signal, which only holds true for North America, from where most samples originate; emerging evidence suggests that grasslands evolved to a dominant state at least 15Ma earlier in South America.\n\n"}

He and his sister befriend the Wookiee Lowbacca (nicknamed Lowie by his friends) and the warrior princess Tenel Ka.\n\nIn \"Heirs of the Force\" and \"Shadow Academy\", Jacen and Jaina discover a crashed TIE fighter from the Battle of Yavin. Jaina installs a hyperdrive in the downed starfighter and begins fixing it to fly again. Jacen, Lowbacca, and Tenel Ka help her to practice their Force skills until all are held captive by the TIE's original pilot, Qorl, who had been living in the jungle for two decades. They eventually escape, but so does Qorl, leaving the jungle moon behind and searching for any remnants of the Galactic Empire. Qorl discovers the Shadow Academy, a training ground for Dark Jedi commanded by one of Luke Skywalker's fallen students, Brakiss, along with the remains of the Dathomiri Nightsisters. These elements of the so-called Second Imperium kidnap Jacen, Jaina and Lowbacca, but they resist the dark side and are rescued by Luke Skywalker and Tenel Ka.\n\nThe friends return to Coruscant for a short vacation, and are reunited with the twins' childhood friend Zekk. They are forced to fight Jacen and Jaina several times, and the twins and their friends finally progress far enough to be tasked with building their first lightsabers. Jacen uses a corusca gem he had gained earlier for his focusing crystal.\n\nJacen's hard-learned lesson hits home once again in \"Lightsabers\", when Tenel Ka rushes to complete her lightsaber to keep up with her friends. She uses an imperfect crystal and her blade shorts out in a sparring match with Jacen. His lightsaber passes through thin air where her weapon had been seconds before and severs the young woman's arm. Though she bears him no ill will for the accident, Jacen is wracked with guilt.\n\nIn \"Darkest Knight\", the twins and Tenel Ka go to Kashyyyk with Lowbacca to witness his sister's adulthood rites. In \"Jedi Under Siege\", the Jedi trainees and the Shadow Academy have their final confrontation on Yavin 4. The twins, with help from Luke and Zekk, bring down the Shadow Academy and the Second Imperium forever.\n\nThroughout the series, Jacen and Jaina continue their training at Yavin 4, meeting new friends like Raynar Thul. They cannot convince Zekk to stay at the Academy with them, but Jacen and Jaina remain friends with him. With his and Raynar's help, they discover a threat to the New Republic: the Diversity Alliance, an alien, anti-human group. The Alliance is building up massive support among peoples that had been oppressed by the Empire. They are led by a Twi'lek Nolaa Tarkona, the sister of Oola, who was murdered by Jabba the Hutt in \"Return of the Jedi\".\n\nIn \"Jedi Bounty\", Jacen, Jaina, and their friends are briefly held captive on Ryloth and have to escape to its harsh surface. They have gone there in an attempt to rescue Lowbacca, who had misguidedly joined the anti-human Diversity Alliance. In the following book, \"The Emperor's Plague\", they get to the bottom of a plot they had suspected all along, and catch up with Raynar's father, Bornan Thul, to race the Diversity Alliance fleet to an Imperial storehouse hidden in the deep core. There is hidden a supply of deadly diseases created by General Evir Derricote almost two decades before. Tarkona wishes to unleash a plague against humans and wipe them all out, but the Jedi and Alliance dissidents defeat her. She succumbs to one of the diseases herself on a faraway planet. Bornan Thul dies from one of the plagues right before his son's eyes.\n\nIn \"Return to Ord Mantell\", they go on a trip with their father to the titular planet to watch a race. There, they run into Czethros, a bounty hunter who once hunted Han. They are ambushed by Black Sun agents, but are helped by Anja Gallandro, a young woman who wields a lightsaber, though she is not a Jedi. Although attracted to Tenel Ka, Jacen becomes infatuated with the older woman. Anja had blamed Han Solo for killing her father, but Solo reveals that her father died in a trap while finding treasure.\n\nIn \"Trouble on Cloud City\", they discover Czethros is a minor leader of Black Sun, and is trying to gather enough power to overcome the New Republic. Jacen, Tenel Ka, and Lowbacca are ambushed by several Black Sun mercenaries, and Jacen is almost killed.\n\nIn \"Crisis at Crystal Reef\", Jaina attempts to help Kessel and capture Czetheros while Jacen rushes to help Anja with her spice addiction and help her with Black Sun. With help, Anja beats her addiction and accepts her father's death. Jacen thinks Anja has Jedi potential, but it turns out she didn't. He gets over his infatuation with Anja when she goes to work for Lando.\n\nIn the \"New Jedi Order\" series, Luke takes Jacen as his Jedi apprentice. Jacen learns much from Luke, though they disagree on many philosophical issues. Jacen believes in the Force not only as a tool, but as part of something greater. He tells his brother Anakin that the Force is a guide to find one's place in destiny.\n\nWhen the Yuuzhan Vong attack the New Republic in \"\", Jacen comes to believe that many Jedi are handling the threat too aggressively. He abandons his powers temporarily to contemplate the Force and butts heads with his father over the morality of 'pirate' attacks on Peace Brigade vessels. Only his love for his mother brings Jacen back into the front lines of the battle. Eventually, Han and Jacen make their peace, the former declaring that while he doesn't always understand his son, he is proud of him.\n\nIn \"Star by Star\" Jacen joins a daring mission to Myrkr. A Jedi strike force, led by Anakin, is to infiltrate a Yuuzhan Vong cloning facility where the invaders craft deadly Jedi-hunting beasts called Voxyn. The mission is a disaster, ending with Anakin's death, in which Jaina reacts by touching the dark side of the Force. Forced into the leadership position, Jacen uses the Force Meld to bind the team together into a cohesive fighting unit. After destroying the voxyn queen, Jacen is captured by the Yuuzhan Vong army under the command of Vergere and Nom Anor. Jacen disappears, along with his presence in the Force.\n\nIn \"Traitor\", Jacen awakes to find himself in the Embrace of Pain, a rack-like torture device favored by the Yuuzhan Vong. The torture nearly breaks Jacen's spirit, until he learns to use the pain he suffers to sustain himself. He remains under the care and tutelage of the avian Vergere, who he learns had once been a Jedi of the Old Republic, and who had even met his grandfather, Anakin Skywalker.\nHe is put to work on Yuuzhan Vong ship, where he uses a number of herbs to heal slaves and get his captors to trust him. Using the implanted slave seed beneath his flesh as a conduit, Jacen communicates with the living instruments of Yuuzhan Vong technology. He uses this connection to stage a daring escape from captivity, commanding Yuuzhan Vong amphistaffs to surround him like living armor.\n\nJacen and Vergere flee to Coruscant. The planet's entire surface is undergoing a radical transformation. Yuuzhan Vong organic growths cover the once gleaming metropolis, remaking the planet into a Yuuzhan Vong paradise. The world is to be their new capital, a recreation of the planet that had spawned them, Yuuzhan'tar.\n\nVergere removes the slave seed from Jacen, but he can still sense the Yuuzhan Vong. Jacen is later surrounded by Yuuzhan Vong warriors whom Vergere had led to him. Wanting revenge, Jacen channels his hatred for Vergere into Force lightning; he is frightened by this connection to the dark side, however, and runs away. Vergere finds him in his destroyed home and gives him back full use of the Force. He is once again surrounded by Yuuzhan Vong captors; left with no choice, he surrenders and agrees to join their cause. He becomes the \"khattazz al'Yun,\" or Avatar of God. Nom Anor intends to use Jacen to sacrifice Jaina, thus fulfilling an ancient Yuuzhan Vong prophecy.\n\nJacen's true allegiance is his own, however. During a test of Jacen's faith, the Yuuzhan Vong orders him to sacrifice captured Jedi Ganner Rhysode. Instead, the two Jedi turn against their captors. As Ganner holds off the Yuuzhan Vong, Jacen confronts the World Brain. The malevolent entity remembers the bond that Jacen had forged earlier, and Jacen suggests to it to work against the Yuuzhan Vong.\n\nGanner dies that day, though Jacen escapes with Vergere. He returns to the dwindling New Republic territories a different man: haggard, thin and hardened. He goes on a much needed vacation, but returns to frontline combat aboard the cruiser \"Ralroost\". His ability to start the Jedi Meld is a large asset to Admiral Kre'fey, and Jacen joined the Alliance Fleet with elements of Garm Bel Iblis's forces in a large-scale deception at Ebaq 9. The battle ends in a victory, but results in Vergere's death. Her spectral form appears to him soon after.\n\nAs the newly formed Galactic Alliance emerged, Jacen accompanied his uncle Luke Skywalker into the Unknown Regions to seek a solution to the Yuuzhan Vong menace. Jacen would be instrumental in the search for Zonama Sekot and in the efforts to convince the living planet to join the fight against the Yuuzhan Vong. Jacen kills Supreme Overlord Onimi, who had been using Supreme Overlord Shimrra as a puppet, in a spectacular confrontation where the Force uses Jacen as a conduit to defeat Onimi, considering that Jacen was almost killed with just one hit by Shimrra himself, and in that moment Jacen started believing that he is beyond good and evil, marking the beginning of his fall. After the grueling final confrontation and the war's end, Jacen tells Luke that he had decided to travel the galaxy to learn more about the Force.\nWhile on his five-year journey Jacen enters a realm of the Force known as beyond shadows, thanks to his training with a sect called the Mind Walkers. \nIn this realm Jacen gazes into the Pool of Knowledge that holds the Throne of Balance, (where in all future events are shown)\nJacen sees a dark man ruling the Galaxy and becomes determined to prevent this evil future. \nFollowing this experience, Jacen begins his descent to the dark side of the Force.\n\nIn \"Dark Nest\", Jacen feels an urge through the Force and follows his sister to the Unknown Regions to help the insectoid Killik against an invading Chiss force. He returns to Republic space after his parents, resulting in his uncle and aunt to come for him, Jaina, and the other Jedi. He then travels to the Hapes Cluster to ask Tenel Ka to assist with the Chiss/Killik conflict, believing that the fleet could act as a buffer between the two armies. She obliges and sends a fleet of Hapan Battle Dragons to protect the Killiks.\n\nIn \"The Unseen Queen\", Tenel Ka gives birth to his daughter, Allana, who is then attacked by the Gorog. Jacen successfully repels the attack and keeps his daughter safe. Possessed with a strong fear of his daughter or Tenel Ka being harmed, Jacen uses the Force to send Tenel Ka's grandmother (the person behind the attack) into a coma. Immediately afterward, he sees a vision of a neverending war that will destroy the galaxy, with the Killiks at the heart of it. Determined to save his daughter and the galaxy from his vision, he sets out to provoke the Chiss into destroying the Killiks. Jacen later reveals that he never knew who started the war in his vision.\n\nIn \"The Swarm War\", Luke Skywalker takes his nephew's advice so many times that he even listens when Jacen tells him that he is not ready to face Lomi Plo, the Dark Queen of the Gorog. Jacen, Mara and Luke know that doubt and fear would make Lomi Plo invisible to her enemy. Jacen, along with R2-D2, helps Luke conquer some of his fears about Mara's involvement with the death of his mother, and then accompanies him to face Plo.\n\nDuring the fight with Plo, Luke falters for a moment when Mara is injured, and doubt enters his mind. Plo then holds him in place, unable to move. In that instant, Jacen is critically wounded by Plo while saving Mara Skywalker's life. A well-placed shot from Mara injures Plo, after which Mara tends to Jacen's wounds. While he and Mara recover, Jacen beseeches Luke to embrace his darker emotions. Luke refuses and goes back to the true Jedi way, defeating the Dark Queen and Raynar Thul without using the dark side.\n\nIn the latter novel, Jacen joins his uncle in watching holovideos of his grandparents, Anakin Skywalker and Padmé Amidala; in particular, he sees Anakin fall to the dark side and Padmé die in childbirth partly as a result of Anakin's treachery. (These scenes are first portrayed in \"\"). Jacen actually sympathizes with Anakin's desire to protect his wife, and reminds Luke that Anakin was a fallible human being.\n\nIn \"Betrayal\", Jacen starts training his young cousin Ben in the ways of the Force. After a successful mission to Adumar that ends in a life-threatening attack, they return for a dinner party at his parents' new home. There, Han voices his concern over Corellia trying to gain independence. Luke orders Jacen and Ben to disable the Centerpoint Station, an ancient artifact that Corellian leader (and Han's cousin) Thrackan Sal-Solo is trying to use to his advantage. Ben disables the station while Jacen keeps Thrackan busy, ensuring the Galactic Alliance's partial victory as another fleet built in secret spoils the main attack.\n\nWhile travelling to a subterranean base, Ben and Nelani, a Jedi Knight, are forced out of a mining car. Their guide, Brisha Syo creates a dark side phantom of Luke Skywalker, who attacks and very nearly kills Jacen. Eventually, Brisha stops the projections and takes Jacen to an office, where Darth Vectivus, the supposed Sith Lord they are hunting, lives. After fighting Force projections with Ben, Nelani catches up with them. Brisha is revealed to be Lumiya, the Dark Lady of the Sith. She reveals that Vergere is a Sith apprentice, and that Jacen has already received Sith training. Lumiya says that Jacen is going to become the next Sith Lord. Unsure of his next move, Jacen uses the Force to create visions of the future. In each vision in which Lumiya is arrested, the galaxy is consumed in an endless war that eventually places Jacen against Luke. In the vision, Jacen kills his uncle.\n\nHorrified, Jacen spares Lumiya. Nelani then tries to arrest the Sith, but Jacen intervenes. Jacen realizes that Nelani will, if allowed to survive, possibly fulfill the dark vision he had seen. He then fights and kills her, asking her forgiveness before striking the fatal blow. He agrees to consider what Lumiya had said and leaves the asteroid with an unconscious Ben. Jacen then erases Ben's memories of Lumiya and tells him that both she and Nelani had been killed by dark side phantoms. They return to Coruscant; however, after Jacen departs, Lumiya says that she had won.\n\nFully pledged to Lumiya, Jacen becomes head of the GFFA's newly formed secret police, the Galactic Alliance Guard. With Ben at his side, he begins rounding up Corellians for internment and deportation. During an interrogation of a suspected assassin (who turns out to be Ailyn Vel, Boba Fett's daughter), Jacen tries to use the Force to extract information from her and kills her accidentally in the process.\n\nJacen also takes command of Rogue Squadron while it participates in the blockade of Corellia. He shoots down a civilian freighter that was attempting to run the blockade, and had fired on him, then relieves his sister from duty because she had refused to do it. He also uses the \"Anakin Solo\" to fire upon the \"Millennium Falcon\", while both his sister and his parents are on board. He believes his parents to have been involved in a failed attempt to assassinate Tenel Ka; the Solos had in fact been set up by Dur Gejjen, Prime Minister of Corellia.\n\nIn \"Sacrifice\", Lumiya says she is pleased by his progress, but instructs him that to truly become a Sith he would have to undergo the Trial of Sacrifice: to kill that which he loves most. Doing this, he believes, would allow him to use the powers of the Sith without becoming evil and would \"immortalize his love\" for his sacrifice. Jacen decides there is only one way to fulfill this last obstacle: he would have to kill Tenel Ka and their daughter Allana. Nevertheless, after Ben tells Mara that he overheard Jacen communicating with Lumiya, Mara tracks Jacen down in the Hapes Consortium. After a long and heated battle, Jacen kills Mara Jade; the sacrifice necessary to becoming a Sith Lord is not Jacen's love, but Ben's. Ben suspects Jacen almost immediately, upon meeting Jacen at his mother's body. Eventually, Jacen chooses the Sith name Darth Caedus.\n\nBy \"Fury\", Darth Caedus is the principal antagonist of the series, and the declared enemy of nearly every other major character: His parents and sister have disowned him, Luke is sworn to redeem him, and Ben is driven to seek justice for his mother. In the novel, Caedus kidnaps Allana so Tenel Ka and the Hapans won't decide to leave the government, but Han, Leia, Luke, Jaina, Ben, and their allies save Allana. After saving Allana, Leia tells Caedus to become a Jedi again, but he refuses. Han and Leia later find out Allana is Caedus and Tenel Ka's child. At the end, Jaina plans to have training from Boba Fett to help her face off againast Caedus, despite her parents once being foes with Fett.\n\nIn \"Revelation\", Caedus takes on a new apprentice, Tahiri Veila to replace Ben and turns to the task of ending the war. He entices the Imperial Remnant to join him in an attack on the planet Fondor. Although Admiral Niathal wants to offer the planet the chance to surrender, Caedus is determined to make an example of Fondor by crippling the shipyards and its planetary government. After previously sharing military secrets, which leads to hundreds of deaths and compromises the battle plan at Fondor, Niathal arranges a cease-fire without consulting Caedus. Enraged at this treason, Caedus orders the fleet to ignore Niathal's orders and bombard the major cities. Niathal orders all ships loyal to her to attack the \"Anakin Solo\". Two-thirds of the fleet side with Caedus, while the rest ally themselves with Niathal. When the Imperial Remnant refuses to assist Caedus, his new apprentice assassinates Imperial Head of State Gilad Pellaeon and turns control over to the Moffs who then come to aid Jacen. A mysterious fleet led by Admiral Daala, loyal to Pellaeon, appears, accompanied by one hundred Mandalorian mercenaries. and together, owing to Daala's experimental weapons, they send the Galactic Alliance Fleet into retreat.\n\nCaedus then takes control of Coruscant and claims sole control of the Galactic Alliance.\n\nIn \"Invincible\", Jaina takes it upon herself to defeat her brother. Caedus's meditations are disrupted by Luke Skywalker, in an attempt to hide Jaina's attack. Jaina, accompanied by several Mandalorian commandos, confronts Caedus, who quickly dispatches the Mandalorians, while Jaina acts as a sniper. When she finally runs out of ammunition, she seizes a Mandalorian saber and severs Caedus' arm. Jaina withdraws, however, due to her own injuries. After escaping an attack led by Luke Skywalker on the bridge of the \"Anakin Solo\", Caedus sees a vision of his daughter Allana on a white throne in a time of peace. This vision convinces Caedus that he has won — he would bring peace to the galaxy, and prevent his visions of war and suffering from coming true.\n\nAt the book's climax, Caedus and Jaina face off in a final lightsaber duel aboard Caedus' flagship, the \"Anakin Solo\". In the midst of the duel, Caedus comes back to the light and attempts to persuade Jaina of his intentions to protect Tenel Ka and Allana. Jaina refuses to listen, however, and attacks him after he deactivates and holsters his lightsaber. She later slams the door shut in his face when he tries to leave the fight. After a grueling battle in which both are seriously injured, Jacen is defeated when Jaina severs his Achilles tendon and stabs him in the heart. As he dies, Jacen reaches out to both his former lover and his child through the Force, warning them to flee from an approaching bio-warfare attack designed by the Imperial Remnant to kill them. In this act of selflessness, Jaina sees the remnants of the good man her brother had once been. Following Caedus's death and the war's end, the Galactic Alliance emerges victorious over the Confederation and peace is restored to the galaxy, just as Jacen had foreseen through a vision in the Force.\n\nThough Jacen makes few true appearances in the \"Fate of the Jedi\", which follows the \"Legacy of the Force\" series, his legacy is felt throughout the series, as Luke Skywalker is arrested for negligence of duty and is sentenced to a ten-year exile, in which alongside his son Ben, he tries to ascertain the circumstances of how and why Jacen turned to the dark side.\n\nJacen's spirit makes its first appearance in \"Abyss\", wherein he warns Luke and Ben about Abeloth, the main antagonist of the series.\n\nThen, in the final novel \"Apocalypse\", Jacen's spirit (along with Mara's) provides aid to Luke as he partners with Darth Krayt in the final battle against Abeloth. Following Abeloth's destruction, Jacen reveals that Krayt was the dark figure he saw in his vision of the future and the source of his downfall; he saw his daughter Allana standing next to Krayt. In response, Krayt insists that while Caedus's actions simply delayed the Sith, and they are eventually going to succeed in their planned takeover of the galaxy.\n\nIn aiding the Jedi against Abeloth, Jacen posthumously redeems himself; however, he still refers to his fate as damnation. While Luke does not forgive his nephew for his complicity in Mara's death, he does receive an understanding of what led Jacen to that point.\n\nIGN listed Jacen as #17 on their list of the top 100 \"Star Wars\" heroes, saying that he had a more \"profound effect\" than any of the other Solo children on the \"Star Wars\" setting. Jesse Schedeen, writing for IGN, also listed Darth Caedus as #5 in a reader-inspired list of top \"Star Wars\" villains, and called his \"defining moment of villainy\" his murder of Mara Jade. UGO.com listed Jacen as their top \"Star Wars\" expanded universe character, calling him \"one of the most fearsome - and most tragic - villains in the \"Star Wars\" universe\".\n\n"}

Seidman's 2012 work is \"On Constitutional Disobedience\", where Seidman challenges the viability of political policy arguments made in reference to constitutional obligation.\n\nSeidman received an A.B. from University of Chicago and a J.D. from Harvard Law School in 1971. After graduation, he clerked for D.C. Circuit Judge Skelly Wright and later clerked for Justice Thurgood Marshall. Following his clerkship, Seidman joined the Public Defender Service for the District of Columbia.\n\nSeidman is known for his contributions to constitutional legal theory, principally his theory of unsettlement put forward in his book \"Our Unsettled Constitution: A New Defense of Constitutionalism and Judicial Review\" (Yale 2001). Drawing from the critical legal studies indeterminacy thesis, Seidman argues that because constitutional law cannot settle fundamental political disputes, constitutional legal discourse and judicial review instead act to \"unsettle\" them. Rather than resolving conflicts definitively, the temporary resolution of any controversy in constitutional law through judicial review leaves open the possibility that the losing side may make an equally plausible alternative constitutional argument. In this way, both the prevailing and losing sides in a dispute recognize their positions as unstable and subject to revision within the recognized standards of legal argument. As a result, both winners and losers have reasons to continue their debate within the framework of constitutional law, thereby keeping all parties at the table and consolidating the legal system.\n\nSeidman's defense of judicial review provided a counterpoint within the critical legal studies school to his colleague and sometime collaborator Mark Tushnet's attack on judicial review as undemocratic.\n\nIn addition to Seidman's theory of judicial review, he is also known for his constitutional law casebook, co-authored with Pamela Karlan, Mark Tushnet, Geoffrey Stone and Cass Sunstein. Seidman is also noted for his work in criminal law and his book \"Silence and Freedom\". During the Sonia Sotomayor confirmation hearings, Seidman also attracted attention as an outspoken liberal detractor, writing a scathing response to Sotomayor's claims that she simply applies the law to the facts (arguing that this is impossible to do).\n\nIn 2009 Seidman was interviewed in the health care reform debate, defending the constitutionality of the single payer mandate against libertarian criticism on fora tv.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "21135972", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21135972", "title": "Love coupon", "text": "Love coupon\n\nA love coupon is a romantic way of expressing one's feelings for a partner in a relationship. It is a form of voluntary IOU or promissory note between people in love that contains a promise from one of the partners in a relationship to engage in romantic activities at a time in the future.\n\nThe love coupon contains a relevant artistic image or drawing, a romantic promise and sometimes redeeming conditions like date of expiration. At the core a love coupon is a love note that uses the coupon metaphor but it can also be seen as a very specialized form of greeting card.\n\nThe promise made through the love coupon can range from romantic fantasies to taking care of domestic chores. Samples of romantic promises may include an evening of dancing, night of kisses and cuddles, evening of romance, romantic weekend getaway, boat ride for two, BBQ party, stroll on the beach or a romantic day trip, just to name a few.\n\nLove coupons are seen as a romantic way to pamper one's lover or to reinforce and heat up a relationship. They are usually given as gifts on Valentine's Day, birthdays or anniversary days. They are meant to signify that one is deeply caring about his partner's wishes. A love coupon can be also seen as a sign of trust between partners. The receiver of the love coupon may choose to redeem it at a time of his choice providing no restrictions apply. Sometimes it is more effective to make a promise using a love coupon than to discuss and talk about it with your partner.\n\nLove coupons can be found in many forms: as printed cards, printed books of love coupons and in digital format. Many web sites dedicated to subjects as Valentine's Day, love and romance offer various forms of love coupons for download or as attachments for romantic email messages. They can also be handmade from coloured paper, cut into heart-shape.\n\nAnother popular variant uses the scratchcard metaphor. Created as scratch-off lottery tickets they are sold and marketed as romantic gifts for lovers. Usually all tickets are winners, but like lottery cards one has to find the winning item or combination. The winnings range from romance, love and sex and the gift giver has to fulfill them. Aside from love coupon, there are several other types of coupon that serve diverse purposes.\n\nLove coupons can be delivered individually or as books of coupons. They can be sent by traditional mail, in digital format as email attachments, handed in person at the right moment or placed as surprises in places where the receiver will stumble upon them.\n\nLove coupons can be bought in form of printed coupon books or can be downloaded and printed from various web sites. Some of these sites offer free customizable love coupons for download and print.\n\nA variant of the love coupon concept can be used by parents as an educational and relationship building tool. Parents can use this kind of coupon to get over communication barriers with their children and to assure the children of their love. Such a coupon can promise time for activities together, uninterrupted time for discussions or it can send a message hard to communicate in person.\n\nVarious companies started to use love coupons as promotional materials for their products and brands. For example, Jones Soda Co. introduced in 2006 a Valentines Pack containing among others a book of \"Love Coupons\".\n\n"}
{"id": "18895", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18895", "title": "Metaphysics", "text": "Metaphysics\n\nMetaphysics is the branch of philosophy that examines the fundamental nature of reality, including the relationship between mind and matter, between substance and attribute, and between possibility and actuality. The word \"metaphysics\" comes from two Greek words that, together, literally mean \"after or behind or among the [study of] the natural\". It has been suggested that the term might have been coined by a first century CE editor who assembled various small selections of Aristotle’s works into the treatise we now know by the name \"Metaphysics\" (\"ta meta ta phusika\", 'after the \"Physics\" ', another of Aristotle's works).\n\nMetaphysics studies questions related to what it is for something to exist and what types of existence there are. Metaphysics seeks to answer, in an abstract and fully general manner, the questions:\n\nTopics of metaphysical investigation include existence, objects and their properties, space and time, cause and effect, and possibility.\n\nLike mathematics, metaphysics is a non-empirical study which is conducted using deduction from that which is known \"a priori\". Like foundational mathematics (which is sometimes considered a special case of metaphysics applied to the existence of number), it tries to give a coherent account of the structure of the world, capable of explaining our everyday and scientific perception of the world, and being free from contradictions. In mathematics, there are many different ways to define numbers; similarly in metaphysics there are many different ways to define objects, properties, concepts, and other entities which are claimed to make up the world. While metaphysics may, as a special case, study the entities postulated by fundamental science such as atoms and superstrings, its core topic is the set of categories such as object, property and causality which those scientific theories assume. For example: claiming that \"electrons have charge\" is a scientific theory; while exploring what it means for electrons to be (or at least, to be perceived as) \"objects\", charge to be a \"property\", and for both to exist in a topological entity called \"space\" is the task of metaphysics.\n\nThere are two broad stances about what is \"the world\" studied by metaphysics. The strong, classical view assumes that the objects studied by metaphysics exist independently of any observer, so that the subject is the most fundamental of all sciences. The weak, modern view assumes that the objects studied by metaphysics exist inside the mind of an observer, so the subject becomes a form of introspection and conceptual analysis. Some philosophers, notably Kant, discuss both of these \"worlds\" and what can be inferred about each one. Some philosophers, such as the logical positivists, and many scientists, reject the strong view of metaphysics as meaningless and unverifiable. Others reply that this criticism also applies to any type of knowledge, including hard science, which claims to describe anything other than the contents of human perception, and thus that the world of perception \"is\" the objective world in some sense. Metaphysics itself usually assumes that some stance has been taken on these questions and that it may proceed independently of the choice—the question of which stance to take belongs instead to another branch of philosophy, epistemology.\n\nOntology is the philosophical study of the nature of being, becoming, existence or reality, as well as the basic categories of being and their relations. Traditionally listed as the core of metaphysics, ontology often deals with questions concerning what entities exist or may be said to exist and how such entities may be grouped, related within a hierarchy, and subdivided according to similarities and differences.\n\nIdentity is a fundamental metaphysical issue. Metaphysicians investigating identity are tasked with the question of what, exactly, it means for something to be identical to itself, or — more controversially — to something else. Issues of identity arise in the context of time: what does it mean for something to be itself across two moments in time? How do we account for this? Another question of identity arises when we ask what our criteria ought to be for determining identity? And how does the reality of identity interface with linguistic expressions?\n\nThe metaphysical positions one takes on identity have far-reaching implications on issues such as the mind-body problem, personal identity, ethics, and law.\n\nThe ancient Greeks took extreme positions on the nature of change. Parmenides denied change altogether, while Heraclitus argued that change was ubiquitous: \"[Y]ou cannot step into the same river twice.\"\n\nIdentity, sometimes called Numerical Identity, is the relation that a \"thing\" bears to itself, and which no \"thing\" bears to anything other than itself (cf. sameness).\n\nA modern philosopher who made a lasting impact on the philosophy of identity was Leibniz, whose \"Law of the Indiscernibility of Identicals\" is still in wide use today. It states that if some object x is identical to some object y, then any property that x has, y will have as well.\n\nPut formally, it states\n\nHowever, it seems, too, that objects can change over time. If one were to look at a tree one day, and the tree later lost a leaf, it would seem that one could still be looking at that same tree. Two rival theories to account for the relationship between change and identity are perdurantism, which treats the tree as a series of tree-stages, and endurantism, which maintains that the organism—the same tree—is present at every stage in its history.\n\nObjects appear to us in space and time, while abstract entities such as classes, properties, and relations do not. What then is meant by space and time such that it can serve this function as a ground for objects? Are space and time entities themselves, of some form, or must they exist prior to other entities? How exactly can they be defined? For example, if time is defined as a \"rate of change\" then must there always be something changing in order for time to exist?\n\nClassical philosophy recognized a number of causes, including teleological future causes. In special relativity and quantum field theory the notions of space, time and causality become tangled together, with temporal orders of causations becoming dependent on who is observing them. The laws of physics are symmetrical in time, so could equally well be used to describe time as running backwards. Why then do we perceive it as flowing in one direction, the arrow of time, and as containing causation flowing in the same direction?\n\nCausality is linked by most philosophers to the concept of counterfactuals. To say that A caused B means that if A had not happened then B would not have happened.\n\nCausality is usually required as a foundation for philosophy of science, if science aims to understand causes and effects and make predictions about them.\n\nMetaphysicians investigate questions about the ways the world could have been. David Lewis, in \"On the Plurality of Worlds\", endorsed a view called Concrete Modal realism, according to which facts about how things could have been are made true by other concrete worlds, just as in ours, in which things are different. Other philosophers, such as Gottfried Leibniz, have dealt with the idea of possible worlds as well. The idea of necessity is that any necessary fact is true across all possible worlds. A possible fact is true in some possible world, even if not in the actual world. For example, it is possible that cats could have had two tails, or that any particular apple could have not existed. By contrast, certain propositions seem necessarily true, such as analytic propositions, e.g., \"All bachelors are unmarried.\" The particular example of analytic truth being necessary is not universally held among philosophers. A less controversial view might be that self-identity is necessary, as it seems fundamentally incoherent to claim that for any x, it is not identical to itself; this is known as the \"law of identity\", a putative \"first principle\". Aristotle describes the \"principle of non-contradiction\", \"It is impossible that the same quality should both belong and not belong to the same thing ... This is the most certain of all principles ... Wherefore they who demonstrate refer to this as an ultimate opinion. For it is by nature the source of all the other axioms.\"\n\nWhat is \"central\" and \"peripheral\" to metaphysics has varied over time and schools; however contemporary analytic philosophy as taught in USA and UK universities generally regards the above as \"central\" and the following as \"applications\" or \"peripheral\" topics; or in some cases as distinct subjects which have grown out of and depend upon metaphysics:\n\nMetaphysical cosmology is the branch of metaphysics that deals with the world as the totality of all phenomena in space and time. Historically, it formed a major part of the subject alongside Ontology, though its role is more peripheral in contemporary philosophy. It has had a broad scope, and in many cases was founded in religion. The ancient Greeks drew no distinction between this use and their model for the cosmos. However, in modern times it addresses questions about the Universe which are beyond the scope of the physical sciences. It is distinguished from religious cosmology in that it approaches these questions using philosophical methods (e.g. dialectics).\n\nCosmogony deals specifically with the origin of the universe. Modern metaphysical cosmology and cosmogony try to address questions such as:\n\nAccounting for the existence of mind in a world otherwise composed of matter is a metaphysical problem which is so large and important as to have become a specialized subject of study in its own right, philosophy of mind.\n\nSubstance dualism is a classical theory in which mind and body are essentially different, with the mind having some of the attributes traditionally assigned to the soul, and which creates an immediate conceptual puzzle about how the two interact. Idealism postulates that material objects do not exist unless perceived and only as perceptions. Panpsychism and panexperientialism, are property dualist theories in which everything \"has\" or \"is\" a mind rather than everything exists \"in\" a mind. Neutral monism postulates that existence consists of a single substance that in itself is neither mental nor physical, but is capable of mental and physical aspects or attributesthus it implies a dual-aspect theory. For the last century, the dominant theories have been science-inspired including materialistic monism, Type identity theory, token identity theory, functionalism, reductive physicalism, nonreductive physicalism, eliminative materialism, anomalous monism, property dualism, epiphenomenalism and emergence.\n\nDeterminism is the philosophical proposition that every event, including human cognition, decision and action, is causally determined by an unbroken chain of prior occurrences. It holds that nothing happens that has not already been determined. The principal consequence of the deterministic claim is that it poses a challenge to the existence of free will.\n\nThe problem of free will is the problem of whether rational agents exercise control over their own actions and decisions. Addressing this problem requires understanding the relation between freedom and causation, and determining whether the laws of nature are causally deterministic. Some philosophers, known as Incompatibilists, view determinism and free will as mutually exclusive. If they believe in determinism, they will therefore believe free will to be an illusion, a position known as \"Hard Determinism\". Proponents range from Baruch Spinoza to Ted Honderich.\n\nOthers, labeled Compatibilists (or \"Soft Determinists\"), believe that the two ideas can be reconciled coherently. Adherents of this view include Thomas Hobbes and many modern philosophers such as John Martin Fischer.\n\nIncompatibilists who accept free will but reject determinism are called Libertarians, a term not to be confused with the political sense. Robert Kane and Alvin Plantinga are modern defenders of this theory.\n\nThe earliest type of classification of social construction traces back to Plato in his dialogue Phaedrus where he claims that the biological classification system seems to \"carve nature at the joints\". In contrast, later philosophers such as Michel Foucault and Jorge Luis Borges have challenged the capacity of natural and social classification. In his essay The Analytical Language of John Wilkins, Borges makes us imagine a certain encyclopedia where the animals are divided into (a) those that belong to the emperor; (b) embalmed ones; (c) those that are trained;... and so forth, in order to bring forward the ambiguity of natural and social kinds. According to metaphysics author Alyssa Ney: \"the reason all this is interesting is that there seems to be a metaphysical difference between the Borgesian system and Platos\". The difference is not obvious but one classification attempts to carve entities up according to objective distinction while the other does not. According to Quine this notion is closely related to the notion of similarity.\n\nThere are different ways to set up the notion of number in metaphysics theories. Platonist theories postulate number as a fundamental category itself. Others consider it to be a property of an entity called a \"group\" comprising other entities; or to be a relation held between several groups of entities, such as \"the number four is the set of all sets of four things\". Many of the debates around universals are applied to the study of number, and are of particular importance due to its status as a foundation for the philosophy of mathematics and for mathematics itself.\n\nAlthough metaphysics as a philosophical enterprise is highly hypothetical, it also has practical application in most other branches of philosophy, science, and now also information technology. Such areas generally assume some basic ontology (such as a system of objects, properties, classes, and spacetime) as well as other metaphysical stances on topics such as causality and agency, then build their own particular theories upon these.\n\nIn science, for example, some theories are based on the ontological assumption of objects with properties (such as electrons having charge) while others may reject objects completely (such as quantum field theories, where spread-out \"electronness\" becomes a property of spacetime rather than an object).\n\n\"Social\" branches of philosophy such as philosophy of morality, aesthetics and philosophy of religion (which in turn give rise to practical subjects such as ethics, politics, law, and art) all require metaphysical foundations, which may be considered as branches or applications of metaphysics. For example, they may postulate the existence of basic entities such as value, beauty, and God. Then they use these postulates to make their own arguments about consequences resulting from them. When philosophers in these subjects make their foundations they are doing applied metaphysics, and may draw upon its core topics and methods to guide them, including ontology and other core and peripheral topics. As in science, the foundations chosen will in turn depend on the underlying ontology used, so philosophers in these subjects may have to dig right down to the ontological layer of metaphysics to find what is possible for their theories. For example, a contradiction obtained in a theory of God or Beauty might be due to an assumption that it is an object rather than some other kind of ontological entity.\n\nPrior to the modern history of science, scientific questions were addressed as a part of natural philosophy. Originally, the term \"science\" (Latin \"scientia\") simply meant \"knowledge\". The scientific method, however, transformed natural philosophy into an empirical activity deriving from experiment, unlike the rest of philosophy. By the end of the 18th century, it had begun to be called \"science\" to distinguish it from philosophy. Thereafter, metaphysics denoted philosophical enquiry of a non-empirical character into the nature of existence.\n\nMetaphysics continues asking \"why\" where science leaves off. For example, any theory of fundamental physics is based on some set of axioms, which may postulate the existence of entities such as atoms, particles, forces, charges, mass, or fields. Stating such postulates is considered to be the \"end\" of a science theory. Metaphysics takes these postulates and explores what they mean as human concepts. For example, do all theories of physics require the existence of space and time, objects, and properties? Or can they be expressed using only objects, or only properties? Do the objects have to retain their identity over time or do they change? If they change, then are they still the same object? Can theories be reformulated by converting properties or predicates (such as \"red\") into entities (such as redness or redness fields) or processes ('there is some redding happening over there' appears in some human languages in place of the use of properties). Is the distinction between objects and properties fundamental to the physical world or to our perception of it?\n\nMuch recent work has been devoted to analyzing the role of metaphysics in scientific theorizing. Alexandre Koyré led this movement, declaring in his book \"Metaphysics and Measurement\", \"It is not by following experiment, but by outstripping experiment, that the scientific mind makes progress.\" That metaphysical propositions can influence scientific theorizing is John Watkins' most lasting contribution to philosophy. Since 1957 \"he showed the ways in which some untestable and hence, according to Popperian ideas, non-empirical propositions can nevertheless be influential in the development of properly testable and hence scientific theories. These profound results in applied elementary logic...represented an important corrective to positivist teachings about the meaninglessness of metaphysics and of normative claims\". Imre Lakatos maintained that all scientific theories have a metaphysical \"hard core\" essential for the generation of hypotheses and theoretical assumptions. Thus, according to Lakatos, \"scientific changes are connected with vast cataclysmic metaphysical revolutions.\"\n\nAn example from biology of Lakatos' thesis: David Hull has argued that changes in the ontological status of the species concept have been central in the development of biological thought from Aristotle through Cuvier, Lamarck, and Darwin. Darwin's ignorance of metaphysics made it more difficult for him to respond to his critics because he could not readily grasp the ways in which their underlying metaphysical views differed from his own.\n\nIn physics, new metaphysical ideas have arisen in connection with quantum mechanics, where subatomic particles arguably do not have the same sort of individuality as the particulars with which philosophy has traditionally been concerned. Also, adherence to a deterministic metaphysics in the face of the challenge posed by the quantum-mechanical uncertainty principle led physicists such as Albert Einstein to propose alternative theories that retained determinism. A. N. Whitehead is famous for creating a process philosophy metaphysics inspired by electromagnetism and special relativity.\n\nIn chemistry, Gilbert Newton Lewis addressed the nature of motion, arguing that an electron should not be said to move when it has none of the properties of motion.\n\nKatherine Hawley notes that the metaphysics even of a widely accepted scientific theory may be challenged if it can be argued that the metaphysical presuppositions of the theory make no contribution to its predictive success.\n\nA number of individuals have suggested that much or all of metaphysics should be rejected. In the 16th century, Francis Bacon rejected scholastic metaphysics, and argued strongly for what is now called empiricism, being seen later as the father of modern empirical science. In the eighteenth century, David Hume took a strong position, arguing that all genuine knowledge involves either mathematics or matters of fact and that metaphysics, which goes beyond these, is worthless. He concludes his \"Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding\" with the statement:\n\nIf we take in our hand any volume; of divinity or school metaphysics, for instance; let us ask, \"Does it contain any abstract reasoning concerning quantity or number?\" No. \"Does it contain any experimental reasoning concerning matter of fact and existence?\" No. Commit it then to the flames: for it can contain nothing but sophistry and illusion.\n\nThirty-three years after Hume's \"Enquiry\" appeared, Immanuel Kant published his \"Critique of Pure Reason\". Although he followed Hume in rejecting much of previous metaphysics, he argued that there was still room for some \"synthetic a priori\" knowledge, concerned with matters of fact yet obtainable independent of experience. These included fundamental structures of space, time, and causality. He also argued for the freedom of the will and the existence of \"things in themselves\", the ultimate (but unknowable) objects of experience.\n\nWittgenstein introduced the concept that metaphysics could be influenced by theories of aesthetics, via logic, vis. a world composed of \"atomical facts\".\n\nIn the 1930s, A. J. Ayer and Rudolf Carnap endorsed Hume's position; Carnap quoted the passage above. They argued that metaphysical statements are neither true nor false but meaningless since, according to their verifiability theory of meaning, a statement is meaningful only if there can be empirical evidence for or against it. Thus, while Ayer rejected the monism of Spinoza, he avoided a commitment to pluralism, the contrary position, by holding both views to be without meaning. Carnap took a similar line with the controversy over the reality of the external world. While the logical positivism movement is now considered dead, (with a major proponent AJ Ayer admitting in a TV interview that \"it was a lot of fun ... but it was false\") it has continued to influence philosophy development.\n\nArguing against such rejections, the Scholastic philosopher Edward Feser has observed that Hume's critique of metaphysics, and specifically Hume's fork, is \"notoriously self-refuting\". Feser argues that Hume's fork itself is not a conceptual truth and is not empirically testable.\n\nSome living philosophers, such as Amie Thomasson, have argued that many metaphysical questions can be dissolved just by looking at the way we use words; others, such as Ted Sider, have argued that metaphysical questions are substantive, and that we can make progress toward answering them by comparing theories according to a range of theoretical virtues inspired by the sciences, such as simplicity and explanatory power.\n\nThe word \"metaphysics\" derives from the Greek words μετά (\"metá\",\"after\") and φυσικά (\"physiká\", \"physics\"). It was first used as the title for several of Aristotle's works, because they were usually anthologized after the works on physics in complete editions. The prefix \"meta-\" (\"after\") indicates that these works come \"after\" the chapters on physics. However, Aristotle himself did not call the subject of these books metaphysics: he referred to it as \"first philosophy.\" The editor of Aristotle's works, Andronicus of Rhodes, is thought to have placed the books on first philosophy right after another work, \"Physics\", and called them (\"tà metà tà physikà biblía\") or \"the books [that come] after the [books on] physics\". \n\nHowever, once the name was given, the commentators sought to find other reasons for its appropriateness. For instance, Thomas Aquinas understood it to refer to the chronological or pedagogical order among our philosophical studies, so that the \"metaphysical sciences\" would mean \"those that we study after having mastered the sciences that deal with the physical world\". \n\nThe term was misread by other medieval commentators, who thought it meant \"the science of what is beyond the physical\". Following this tradition, the prefix \"meta-\" has more recently been prefixed to the names of sciences to designate higher sciences dealing with ulterior and more fundamental problems: hence metamathematics, , etc.\n\nA person who creates or develops metaphysical theories is called a \"metaphysician\".\n\nCommon parlance also uses the word \"metaphysics\" for a different referent from that of the present article, namely for beliefs in arbitrary non-physical or magical entities. For example, \"Metaphysical healing\" to refer to healing by means of remedies that are magical rather than scientific. This usage stemmed from the various historical schools of speculative metaphysics which operated by postulating all manner of physical, mental and spiritual entities as bases for particular metaphysical systems. Metaphysics as a subject does not preclude beliefs in such magical entities but neither does it promote them. Rather, it is the subject which provides the vocabulary and logic with which such beliefs might be analyzed and studied, for example to search for inconsistencies both within themselves and with other accepted systems such as Science.\n\nCognitive archeology such as analysis of cave paintings and other pre-historic art and customs suggests that a form of perennial philosophy or Shamanism metaphysics may stretch back to the birth of behavioral modernity, all around the world. Similar beliefs are found in present-day \"stone age\" cultures such as Australian aboriginals. Perennial philosophy postulates the existence of a spirit or concept world alongside the day-to-day world, and interactions between these worlds during dreaming and ritual, or on special days or at special places. It has been argued that perennial philosophy formed the basis for Platonism, with Plato articulating, rather than creating, much older widespread beliefs.\n\nBronze Age cultures such as ancient Mesopotamia and ancient Egypt (along with similarly structured but chronologically later cultures such as Mayans and Aztecs) developed belief systems based on mythology, anthropomorphic gods, mind-body dualism, and a spirit world, to explain causes and cosmology. These cultures appear to have been interested in astronomy and may have associated or identified the stars with some of these entities. In ancient Egypt, the ontological distinction between order (maat) and chaos (Isfet) seems to have been important.\n\nThe first named Greek philosopher, according to Aristotle, is Thales of Miletus, early 6th century BCE. He made use of purely physical explanations to explain the phenomena of the world rather than the mythological and divine explanations of tradition. He is thought to have posited water as the single underlying principle (or \"Arche in later Aristotelian terminology) of the material world\". His fellow, but younger Miletians, Anaximander and Anaximenes, also posited monistic underlying principles, namely apeiron (the indefinite or boundless) and air respectively.\n\nAnother school was the Eleatics, in southern Italy. The group was founded in the early fifth century BCE by Parmenides, and included Zeno of Elea and Melissus of Samos. Methodologically, the Eleatics were broadly rationalist, and took logical standards of clarity and necessity to be the criteria of truth. Parmenides' chief doctrine was that reality is a single unchanging and universal Being. Zeno used \"reductio ad absurdum\", to demonstrate the illusory nature of change and time in his paradoxes.\n\nHeraclitus of Ephesus, in contrast, made change central, teaching that \"all things flow\". His philosophy, expressed in brief aphorisms, is quite cryptic. For instance, he also taught the unity of opposites.\n\nDemocritus and his teacher Leucippus, are known for formulating an atomic theory for the cosmos. They are considered forerunners of the scientific method.\n\nMetaphysics in Chinese philosophy can be traced back to the earliest Chinese philosophical concepts from the Zhou Dynasty such as Tian (Heaven) and Yin and Yang. The fourth century BCE saw a turn towards cosmogony with the rise of Taoism (in the Daodejing and Zhuangzi) and sees the natural world as dynamic and constantly changing processes which spontaneously arise from a single immanent metaphysical source or principle (Tao). Another philosophical school which arose around this time was the School of Naturalists which saw the ultimate metaphysical principle as the Taiji, the \"supreme polarity\" composed of the forces of Ying and Yang which were always in a state of change seeking balance. Another concern of Chinese metaphysics, especially Taoism, is the relationship and nature of Being and non-Being (you 有 and wu 無). The Taoists held that the ultimate, the Tao, was also non-being or no-presence. Other important concepts were those of spontaneous generation or natural vitality (Ziran) and \"correlative resonance\" (Ganying).\n\nAfter the fall of the Han Dynasty (220 CE), China saw the rise of the Neo-Taoist Xuanxue school. This school was very influential in developing the concepts of later Chinese metaphysics. Buddhist philosophy entered China (c 1st century) and was influenced by the native Chinese metaphysical concepts to develop new theories. The native Tiantai and Huayen schools of philosophy maintained and reinterpreted the Indian theories of shunyata (emptiness, kong 空) and Buddha-nature (Fo xing 佛性) into the theory of interpenetration of phenomena. Neo-Confucians like Zhang Zai under the influence of other schools developed the concepts of \"principle\" (li) and vital energy (qi).\n\nSocrates is known for his dialectic or questioning approach to philosophy rather than a positive metaphysical doctrine.\n\nHis pupil, Plato is famous for his theory of forms (which he places in the mouth of Socrates in his dialogues). Platonic realism (also considered a form of idealism) is considered to be a solution to the problem of universals; i.e., what particular objects have in common is that they share a specific Form which is universal to all others of their respective kind.\n\nThe theory has a number of other aspects:\n\nPlatonism developed into Neoplatonism, a philosophy with a monotheistic and mystical flavour that survived well into the early Christian era.\n\nPlato's pupil Aristotle wrote widely on almost every subject, including metaphysics. His solution to the problem of universals contrasts with Plato's. Whereas Platonic Forms are existentially apparent in the visible world, Aristotelian essences dwell in particulars.\n\nPotentiality and Actuality are principles of a dichotomy which Aristotle used throughout his philosophical works to analyze motion, causality and other issues.\n\nThe Aristotelian theory of change and causality stretches to four causes: the material, formal, efficient and final. The efficient cause corresponds to what is now known as a cause \"simpliciter\". Final causes are explicitly teleological, a concept now regarded as controversial in science. The Matter/Form dichotomy was to become highly influential in later philosophy as the substance/essence distinction.\n\nThe opening arguments in Aristotle's \"Metaphysics\", Book I, revolve around the senses, knowledge, experience, theory, and wisdom. The first main focus in the Metaphysics is attempting to determine how intellect \"advances from sensation through memory, experience, and art, to theoretical knowledge\". Aristotle claims that eyesight provides us with the capability to recognize and remember experiences, while sound allows us to learn.\n\n\"More on Indian philosophy: Hindu philosophy\"\n\n\"Sāṃkhya\" is an ancient system of Indian philosophy based on a dualism involving the ultimate principles of consciousness and matter. It is described as the rationalist school of Indian philosophy. It is most related to the Yoga school of Hinduism, and its method was most influential on the development of Early Buddhism.\n\nThe Sāmkhya is an enumerationist philosophy whose epistemology accepts three of six pramanas (proofs) as the only reliable means of gaining knowledge. These include \"pratyakṣa\" (perception), \"anumāṇa\" (inference) and \"śabda\" (\"āptavacana\", word/testimony of reliable sources).\n\nSamkhya is strongly dualist. Sāmkhya philosophy regards the universe as consisting of two realities; puruṣa (consciousness) and prakṛti (matter). Jiva (a living being) is that state in which puruṣa is bonded to prakṛti in some form. This fusion, state the Samkhya scholars, led to the emergence of \"buddhi\" (\"spiritual awareness\") and \"ahaṅkāra\" (ego consciousness). The universe is described by this school as one created by purusa-prakṛti entities infused with various permutations and combinations of variously enumerated elements, senses, feelings, activity and mind. During the state of imbalance, one of more constituents overwhelm the others, creating a form of bondage, particularly of the mind. The end of this imbalance, bondage is called liberation, or moksha, by the Samkhya school.\n\nThe existence of God or supreme being is not directly asserted, nor considered relevant by the Samkhya philosophers. Sāṃkhya denies the final cause of Ishvara (God). While the Samkhya school considers the Vedas as a reliable source of knowledge, it is an atheistic philosophy according to Paul Deussen and other scholars. A key difference between Samkhya and Yoga schools, state scholars, is that Yoga school accepts a \"personal, yet essentially inactive, deity\" or \"personal god\".\n\nSamkhya is known for its theory of guṇas (qualities, innate tendencies). Guṇa, it states, are of three types: \"sattva\" being good, compassionate, illuminating, positive, and constructive; \"rajas\" is one of activity, chaotic, passion, impulsive, potentially good or bad; and \"tamas\" being the quality of darkness, ignorance, destructive, lethargic, negative. Everything, all life forms and human beings, state Samkhya scholars, have these three guṇas, but in different proportions. The interplay of these guṇas defines the character of someone or something, of nature and determines the progress of life. The Samkhya theory of guṇas was widely discussed, developed and refined by various schools of Indian philosophies, including Buddhism. Samkhya's philosophical treatises also influenced the development of various theories of Hindu ethics.\n\nRealization of the nature of Self-identity is the principal object of the Vedanta system of Indian metaphysics. In the Upanishads, self-consciousness is not the first-person indexical self-awareness or the self-awareness which is self-reference without identification, and also not the self-consciousness which as a kind of desire is satisfied by another self-consciousness. It is Self-realisation; the realisation of the Self consisting of consciousness that leads all else.\n\nThe word \"Self-consciousness\" in the Upanishads means the knowledge about the existence and nature of Brahman. It means the consciousness of our own real being, the primary reality. Self-consciousness means Self-knowledge, the knowledge of Prajna i.e. of Prana which is Brahman. According to the Upanishads the Atman or Paramatman is phenomenally unknowable; it is the object of realisation. The Atman is unknowable in its essential nature; it is unknowable in its essential nature because it is the eternal subject who knows about everything including itself. The Atman is the knower and also the known.\n\nMetaphysicians regard the Self either to be distinct from the Absolute or entirely identical with the Absolute. They have given form to three schools of thought – a) the \"Dualistic school\", b) the \"Quasi-dualistic school\" and c) the \"Monistic school\", as the result of their varying mystical experiences. Prakrti and Atman, when treated as two separate and distinct aspects form the basis of the Dualism of the Shvetashvatara Upanishad. Quasi-dualism is reflected in the Vaishnavite-monotheism of Ramanuja and the absolute Monism, in the teachings of Adi Shankara.\n\nSelf-consciousness is the Fourth state of consciousness or \"Turiya\", the first three being \"Vaisvanara\", \"Taijasa\" and \"Prajna\". These are the four states of individual consciousness.\n\nThere are three distinct stages leading to Self-realisation. The First stage is in mystically apprehending the glory of the Self within us as though we were distinct from it. The Second stage is in identifying the \"I-within\" with the Self, that we are in essential nature entirely identical with the pure Self. The Third stage is in realising that the Atman is Brahman, that there is no difference between the Self and the Absolute. The Fourth stage is in realising \"I am the Absolute\" - \"Aham Brahman Asmi\". The Fifth stage is in realising that Brahman is the \"All\" that exists, as also that which does not exist.\n\nIn Buddhist philosophy there are various metaphysical traditions that have proposed different questions about the nature of reality based on the teachings of the Buddha in the early Buddhist texts. The Buddha of the early texts does not focus on metaphysical questions but on ethical and spiritual training and in some cases, he dismisses certain metaphysical questions as unhelpful and indeterminate Avyakta, which he recommends should be set aside. The development of systematic metaphysics arose after the Buddha's death with the rise of the Abhidharma traditions. The Buddhist Abhidharma schools developed their analysis of reality based on the concept of \"dharmas\" which are the ultimate physical and mental events that make up experience and their relations to each other. Noa Ronkin has called their approach \"phenomenological\".\n\nLater philosophical traditions include the Madhyamika school of Nagarjuna, which further developed the theory of the emptiness (shunyata) of all phenomena or dharmas which rejects any kind of substance. This has been interpreted as a form of anti-foundationalism and anti-realism which sees reality has having no ultimate essence or ground. The Yogacara school meanwhile promoted a theory called \"awareness only\" (vijnapti-matra) which has been interpreted as a form of Idealism or Phenomenology and denies the split between awareness itself and the objects of awareness.\n\nIslamic metaphysics was highly active during Europe's 'Dark Ages', beginning with the arrival and translation of Aristotle into Arabic.\n\nBetween about 1100 and 1500, philosophy as a discipline took place as part of the Catholic church's teaching system, known as scholasticism. Scholastic philosophy took place within an established\nframework blending Christian theology with Aristotelian teachings. Although fundamental orthodoxies were not commonly challenged, there were nonetheless deep metaphysical disagreements, particularly over the problem of universals, which engaged Duns Scotus and Pierre Abelard. William of Ockham is remembered for his principle of ontological parsimony.\n\nIn the early modern period (17th and 18th centuries), the system-building \"scope\" of philosophy is often linked to the rationalist \"method\" of philosophy, that is the technique of deducing the nature of the world by pure reason. The scholastic concepts of substance and accident were employed.\n\nBritish empiricism marked something of a reaction to rationalist and system-building metaphysics, or \"speculative\" metaphysics as it was pejoratively termed. The sceptic David Hume famously declared that most metaphysics should be consigned to the flames (see below). Hume was notorious among his contemporaries as one of the first philosophers to openly doubt religion, but is better known now for his critique of causality. John Stuart Mill, Thomas Reid and John Locke were less sceptical, embracing a more cautious style of metaphysics based on realism, common sense and science. Other philosophers, notably George Berkeley were led from empiricism to idealistic metaphysics.\n\nChristian Wolff had theoretical philosophy divided into an ontology or \"philosophia prima\" as a general metaphysics, which arises as a preliminary to the distinction of the three \"special metaphysics\" on the soul, world and God: rational psychology, rational cosmology and rational theology. The three disciplines are called empirical and rational because they are independent of revelation. This scheme, which is the counterpart of religious tripartition in creature, creation, and Creator, is best known to philosophical students by Kant's treatment of it in the \"Critique of Pure Reason\". In the \"Preface\" of the 2nd edition of Kant's book, Wolff is defined \"the greatest of all dogmatic philosophers.\"\n\nImmanuel Kant attempted a grand synthesis and revision of the trends already mentioned: scholastic philosophy, systematic metaphysics, and skeptical empiricism, not to forget the burgeoning science of his day. As did the systems builders, he had an overarching framework in which all questions were to be addressed. Like Hume, who famously woke him from his 'dogmatic slumbers', he was suspicious of metaphysical speculation, and also places much emphasis on the limitations of the human mind.\nKant described his shift in metaphysics away from making claims about an objective noumenal world, towards exploring the subjective phenomenal world, as a Copernican Revolution, by analogy to (though opposite in direction to) Copernicus' shift from man (the subject) to the sun (an object) at the center of the universe.\n\nKant saw rationalist philosophers as aiming for a kind of metaphysical knowledge he defined as the \"synthetic apriori\"—that is knowledge that does not come from the senses (it is a priori) but is nonetheless about reality (synthetic). Inasmuch as it is about reality, it differs from abstract mathematical propositions (which he terms analytical apriori), and being apriori it is distinct from empirical, scientific knowledge (which he terms synthetic aposteriori). The only synthetic apriori knowledge we can have is of how our minds organise the data of the senses; that organising framework is space and time, which for Kant have no mind-independent existence, but nonetheless operate uniformly in all humans. Apriori knowledge of space and time is all that remains of metaphysics as traditionally conceived. There \"is\" a reality beyond sensory data or phenomena, which he calls the realm of noumena; however, we cannot know it as it is in itself, but only as it appears to us. He allows himself to speculate that the origins of phenomenal God, morality, and free will \"might\" exist in the noumenal realm, but these possibilities have to be set against its basic unknowability for humans. Although he saw himself as having disposed of metaphysics, in a sense, he has generally been regarded in retrospect as having a metaphysics of his own, and as beginning the modern analytical conception of the subject.\n\nNineteenth century philosophy was overwhelmingly influenced by Kant and his successors. Schopenhauer, Schelling, Fichte and Hegel all purveyed their own panoramic versions of German Idealism, Kant's own caution about metaphysical speculation, and refutation of idealism, having fallen by the wayside. The idealistic impulse continued into the early twentieth century with British idealists such as F. H. Bradley and J. M. E. McTaggart. Followers of Karl Marx took Hegel's dialectic view of history and re-fashioned it as materialism.\n\nDuring the period when idealism was dominant in philosophy, science had been making great advances. The arrival of a new generation of scientifically minded philosophers led to a sharp decline in the popularity of idealism during the 1920s.\n\nAnalytical philosophy was spearheaded by Bertrand Russell and G. E. Moore. Russell and William James tried to compromise between idealism and materialism with the theory of neutral monism.\n\nThe early to mid twentieth century philosophy saw a trend to reject metaphysical questions as meaningless. The driving force behind this tendency was the philosophy of logical positivism as espoused by the Vienna Circle, which argued that the meaning of a statement was its prediction of observable results of an experiment, and thus that there is no need to postulate the existence of any objects other than these perceptual observations.\n\nAt around the same time, the American pragmatists were steering a middle course between materialism and idealism.\nSystem-building metaphysics, with a fresh inspiration from science, was revived by A. N. Whitehead and Charles Hartshorne.\n\nThe forces that shaped analytical philosophy—the break with idealism, and the influence of science—were much less significant outside the English speaking world, although there was a shared turn toward language. Continental philosophy continued in a trajectory from post Kantianism.\n\nThe phenomenology of Husserl and others was intended as a collaborative project for the investigation of the features and structure of consciousness common to all humans, in line with Kant's basing his synthetic apriori on the uniform operation of consciousness. It was officially neutral with regards to ontology, but was nonetheless to spawn a number of metaphysical systems. Brentano's concept of intentionality would become widely influential, including on analytical philosophy.\n\nHeidegger, author of \"Being and Time\", saw himself as re-focusing on Being-qua-being, introducing the novel concept of \"Dasein\" in the process. Classing himself an existentialist, Sartre wrote an extensive study of \"Being and Nothingness\".\n\nThe speculative realism movement marks a return to full blooded realism.\n\nThere are two fundamental aspects of everyday experience: change and persistence. Until recently, the Western philosophical tradition has arguably championed substance and persistence, with some notable exceptions, however. According to process thinkers, novelty, flux and accident do matter, and sometimes they constitute the ultimate reality.\n\nIn a broad sense, process metaphysics is as old as Western philosophy, with figures such as Heraclitus, Plotinus, Duns Scotus, Leibniz, David Hume, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling, Gustav Theodor Fechner, Friedrich Adolf Trendelenburg, Charles Renouvier, Karl Marx, Ernst Mach, Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche, Émile Boutroux, Henri Bergson, Samuel Alexander and Nicolas Berdyaev. It seemingly remains an open question whether major \"Continental\" figures such as the late Martin Heidegger, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Gilles Deleuze, Michel Foucault, or Jacques Derrida should be included.\n\nIn a strict sense, process metaphysics may be limited to the works of a few founding fathers: G. W. F. Hegel, Charles Sanders Peirce, William James, Henri Bergson, A. N. Whitehead, and John Dewey. From a European perspective, there was a very significant and early Whiteheadian influence on the works of outstanding scholars such as Émile Meyerson (1859–1933), Louis Couturat (1868–1914), Jean Wahl (1888–1974), Robin George Collingwood (1889–1943), Philippe Devaux (1902–1979), Hans Jonas (1903–1993), Dorothy M. Emmett (1904–2000), Maurice Merleau Ponty (1908–1961), Enzo Paci (1911–1976), Charlie Dunbar Broad (1887–1971), Wolfe Mays (1912–), Ilya Prigogine (1917–2003), Jules Vuillemin (1920–2001), Jean Ladrière (1921–), Gilles Deleuze (1925–1995), Wolfhart Pannenberg (1928–), and Reiner Wiehl (1929–2010).\n\nWhile early analytic philosophy tended to reject metaphysical theorizing, under the influence of logical positivism, it was revived in the second half of the twentieth century. Philosophers such as David K. Lewis and David Armstrong developed elaborate theories on a range of topics such as universals, causation, possibility and necessity and abstract objects. However, the focus of analytical philosophy generally is away from the construction of all-encompassing systems and toward close analysis of individual ideas.\n\nAmong the developments that led to the revival of metaphysical theorizing were Quine's attack on the analytic–synthetic distinction, which was generally taken to undermine Carnap's distinction between existence questions internal to a framework and those external to it.\n\nThe philosophy of fiction, the problem of empty names, and the debate over existence's status as a property have all come of relative obscurity into the limelight, while perennial issues such as free will, possible worlds, and the philosophy of time have had new life breathed into them.\n\nThe analytic view is of metaphysics as studying phenomenal human concepts rather than making claims about the noumenal world, so its style often blurs into philosophy of language and introspective psychology. Compared to system-building, it can seem very dry, stylistically similar to computer programming, mathematics or even accountancy (as a common stated goal is to \"account for\" entities in the world). Despite, or perhaps because of, this scientific dryness, it is generally regarded as having made \"progress\" where other schools have not. For example, concepts from analytical metaphysics are now routinely employed and cited as useful guides in computational ontologies for databases and to frame computer natural language processing and knowledge representation software.\n\n\n\n\n"}

One of the problems in a study of consciousness is the hidden way in which conscious states are dependent on brain states. Flanagan has proposed that there is a \"natural method\" to go about understanding consciousness that involves creating a science of mind. Three key elements of this developing science are: paying attention to subjective reports on conscious experiences, incorporating the results from psychology and cognitive science, and including the results from neuroscience that will reveal how neuronal systems produce consciousness.\n\nFlanagan is also responsible for bringing attention to the relevance of empirical psychology on the way we think of moral psychology.

In 1947, Rafael attended classes at the recently created Institute of Philosophy at the National University of Colombia. Many of his early essays from this time appeared in the literary section of the conservative daily \"El Siglo\", and he participated in the formation of a short-lived rightist political movement called \"Revolución Nacional\".\n\nIn 1950, disturbed by La Violencia and frustrated by what he felt was the poor quality of education in Colombia, Rafael left to study philosophy in Europe. His student work attracted the attention of Martin Heidegger, who personally invited him to come to Germany in 1953. He enrolled at the University of Freiburg, where he took his doctorate and met his wife, Marliese.\n\nIn 1956, through his friend Eduardo Cote Lamus, who was the Consul in Frankfurt, Rafael obtained a position as translator for the Colombian embassy in Bonn. He was later promoted to Cultural Attaché. In 1959, Rafael and Francisco Pérez González founded the publishing house \"Taurus\", which presented many German authors in Spanish translation for the first time.\n\nRafael's literary work did not distract him from issues involving education. In 1965, in response to a UNESCO proposal for reforming Latin-American universities, he published an essay, \"Ten Theses on a Theme: The Private University and Underdevelopment\", where he accused the private universities of destroying \"the people\", fomenting classism, creating social violence, promoting studies to serve the interests of imperialism, lowering the quality of scientific research and corrupting academic ethics.\n\nThe following year, Rafael was dismissed from his position at the embassy and transferred to the Ministry of External Affairs in Bogotá. While there, he taught at several universities. His continuing disillusionment with the university system in Colombia led him to return to Germany in 1969, where he became involved in social research at the University of Münster. Finally, in 1970, he became a full professor at the University of Bonn, where he helped create their Hispanic Studies department. He held that position until his retirement in 1993. Shortly thereafter, he was named Professor Emeritus. Despite his self-imposed exile, throughout these years he continued to contribute articles to several Latin-American newspapers and magazines.

Carroll was best known for his contributions in the field of skepticism; he achieved notability by publishing \"The Skeptic's Dictionary\" online in 1994. He was elected a fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry in 2010. He described himself as a naturalist, an atheist, a materialist, a metaphysical libertarian, and a positivist.\n\nHis published books include \"Becoming a Critical Thinker;\" \"The Skeptic's Dictionary;\" \"The\" \"Skeptic's Dictionary for Kids;\" \"The Critical Thinker's Dictionary;\" \"Unnatural Acts: Critical Thinking, Skepticism, and Science Exposed!\"; \"The Commonsense Philosophy of Religion of Edward Stillingfleet\"; \"Student Success Guide: Writing Skills\" and \"Student Success Guide: Reading Skills\".\n\nHe was a professor of philosophy at Sacramento City College from 1977 until his retirement in 2007.\n\nCarroll was born in Joliet, Illinois on May 18, 1945. His father worked in a coal processing plant. The family moved to San Diego in 1954 where Carroll grew up. He described his early years in Ocean Beach as an ideal childhood. He was raised Catholic.\n\nCarroll went to the University of San Diego High School, the same school that Phil Mickelson and Scott Peterson attended. After that, he received a Catholic education in the University of Notre Dame. He went into seminary in Notre Dame, he eventually left after a short time in 1965 and went back to San Diego. Carroll earned his Ph.D. in philosophy in 1974 at the University of California, San Diego, writing his doctoral thesis under the direction of Richard H. Popkin on the religious philosophy of Edward Stillingfleet who defended the Anglican church passionately against Catholic, deist and atheist offenders before becoming Bishop of Worcester. It was published in 1975. By then Carroll was married with two daughters. The new family moved to Susanville, California where he started teaching philosophy at Lassen Community College. After that he moved to the Sacramento area, he has been living in Davis since 1977.\n\nCarroll said that he never went through a religion deconversion moment; instead he had a long journey that led him to disbelief. He first started having strong doubts about Catholicism when he went into Seminary in Notre Dame. He became intrigued by eastern religions after leaving the Seminary. Inspired by Alan Watts, he started looking at eastern religions' holy books. Carroll became interested in Paramahansa Yogananda and attended his Self-Realization Fellowship group to do yoga and chanting, he identified as agnostic at the time. After leaving the fellowship, he spent many years thinking in depth about his religion. He said \"The more I thought about religious ideas, the more false and absurd they seem to me.\" Carroll became enchanted by the ideas of Kierkegaard, namely the idea that religious beliefs require a leap of faith because they cannot be rationally proven. Instead, Carroll decided to take a leap in the other direction: he said that he \"found many reasons for disbelief and absolutely no reasons for belief\", and that his former religious beliefs lost their attractiveness.\n\nCarroll's teaching career started with a part-time position teaching philosophy at Lassen Community College. He taught philosophy of religion at American River College for two years before going full-time in Sacramento City College where he taught introductory philosophy classes, logic and critical reasoning, law justice and punishment and critical thinking about the paranormal for three decades (1977–2007) as well as serving several years as chairman.\n\nCarroll authored \"Becoming a Critical Thinker\", a textbook for introductory logic and critical thinking courses. It covers subjects such as language and critical thinking, the mass media and other sources of information, fallacies of reasoning, and inductive and deductive arguments. The book is subtitled \"A Guide for the New Millennium\". Pearson Educational published the first edition in 2000 and the second edition was published in 2005. \"Becoming a Critical Thinker\" was born out of Carroll's classwork during his time in Sacramento City College.\n\n\"The Skeptic's Dictionary\" is the print version of the website skepdic.com and is available in Dutch, English, Japanese, Korean, and Russian. It provides definitions, arguments, and essays on supernatural, occult, paranormal, and pseudo-scientific subjects. The book features many examples of pseudoscientific beliefs over its eight chapters. In the last chapter, Carroll provided ways to improve critical thinking and skepticism. Similar to the website, it takes a skeptical stance, typically assuming that something is false until proven otherwise. The book came about when Ted Weinstein, a literary agent, contacted Carroll about creating the book. The book was eventually published by John Wiley & Son in August 2003 as an inexpensive paperback. The book is intended to be biased towards the skeptical side; it is not targeted towards true believers.\n\nCarroll also wrote a children's version of the Skeptic's dictionary which was released online on July 22, 2011. In 2013, it was published as a children's book under the title \"Mysteries and Science: Exploring Aliens, Ghosts, Monsters, the End of the World and Other Weird Things\". He also wrote \"Unnatural Acts: Critical Thinking, Skepticism, and Science Exposed!\" which was initially published by the James Randi Educational Foundation as an e-book in 2011. A paperback version is available from Lulu. \"The Critical Thinker's Dictionary\" was published in 2013. It features short articles about cognitive biases and logical fallacies.\n\nA long-time advocate of scientific skepticism and critical thinking, Carroll said that he had been investigating controversial beliefs since he was seven years old when he had doubts about Santa Claus. Carroll described the importance of critical thinking and open-mindedness in the following quotation:\nCarroll's background in philosophy meant that he was well versed in philosophical skepticism. His area of specialization was 17th century British philosophy, namely epistemology and philosophy of religion. Carroll's skeptical career started with his teaching career. However, he did not start writing skeptical content until 1992 when both Carroll's best friend and his father-in-law died within the same week. These circumstances profoundly affected Carroll and made him realize his own mortality, providing the catalyst that started his skeptical writing. In an interview with Beyond a Doubt's Blair Anthony Robertson, Carroll described the influence of this incident: \"It was like the deaths of these two people had forced me to start looking at everything and not take anything for granted. All these times I had said that someday I am going to do this or go there, I decided to just do it.\"\n\nIn 1994, Carroll and his wife attended free training organized by Davis Community Network in which they learned about the Internet and e-mail as well as HTML code. Shortly after, Carroll started the Skeptic's Dictionary website with just ten articles that he had written for his students about logic and pseudoscience. The website is considered among the first to use hypertext. The potential for including links to external materials was part of the appeal of publishing on the internet for Carroll. , the website has more than 5,500 files and 85,000+ hyperlinks. The website had been a one-man project since its inception. Although it never had a staff behind it, several translators volunteered to translate it into more than a dozen languages and several volunteer editors have provided assistance. In Carroll's mind, The Skeptic's Dictionary wasn't an encyclopedia. He saw it as a source of skeptical arguments intended for skeptics to counterbalance the arguments on the other side rather than being targeted towards true believers. , the site had grown to 784 articles that included definitions, arguments, and essays on subjects supernatural, occult, paranormal, and pseudoscientific. , it attracted more than four hundred thousand visitors per month. The Skeptics’ Dictionary was inspired by \"Pierre Bayle's Historical and Critical Dictionary\" in both its name and its biased stance. Carroll was most intrigued by the Baruch Spinoza entry in Bayle's dictionary; he described its influence in an interview with Point of Inquiry's Karen Stollznow:\nCarroll created skeptical blogs such as Mass Media Bunk and Mass Media Funk (they were replaced by Skeptimedia in 2007). He also maintained Skeptimedia and Suburban Myths blogs in addition to skepdic.com.\n\nOn March 27, 2012, Carroll began a regular segment on the podcast \"Skepticality\" entitled \"Unnatural Virtue\" in which he commented on topics in critical thinking and skepticism. The segment ran until April 29, 2014 for thirty-one episodes.\n\nCarroll spoke at several skeptic conferences. In 2003, he was invited to give a talk at the first Amaz!ng Meeting. In the same year he gave a speech at the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal conference on frauds and hoaxes. In 2004, he gave a speech to the Irish Skeptics in Dublin on scientific proof for the paranormal. In 2007, he conducted a critical thinking workshop at the 5th Amazing Meeting. On May 29, 2011, Carroll led a discussion concerning the \"Five Myths About Skeptics\" at the 2nd annual SkeptiCalCon event held in Berkeley, CA.\n\nCarroll's views attracted numerous interviews for him from mainstream media and local newspapers, such as the \"Davis Enterprise\" and he was quoted in the \"New York Times\". In addition, he was interviewed by representatives of groups promoting scientific skepticism, such as the New England Skeptical Society and Media Man Australia. In January 2010 Carroll was elected as a Fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry.\n\nIn an interview with Point of Inquiry's Karen Stollznow, Carroll hinted that he did not earn a substantial amount of money from his skeptical work: \"If we talk about the money we make from skepticism we might set a record for the shortest interview ever.\" However, he insisted that everybody should be a skeptic because, he said, it is a healthy way of approaching life. He said that skeptics' meetups and conferences, as well as the positive feedback he received on his work were his main motivations.\n\nIn May 2016, Carroll announced that he would no longer be able to write the Skeptic's Dictionary monthly newsletter on account of his illness.\n\nAfter Carroll wrote a Skepdic.com entry about Jon Barron criticizing his \"Barron Effect\", Barron replied with a piece on his website titled \"Rebutting a Skeptic\" in which he replied to Carroll's Skepdic.com entries concerning alternative medicine such as \"Cellular energy's relation to cancer\"; \"Mercury, thimerosal, vaccines, and chelation\"; \"The need for supplements\" and \"Fecal matter in the colon\". In the piece he accused Carroll of deliberately misinterpreting evidence, as well as taking issue with a distorted personal picture that Carroll had posted on skepdic.com.\n\nAfter Carroll published a piece online labelling Richard Milton's writings on alternative science as \"Internet Bunk\", Milton responded by accusing Carroll of being a \"pseudo-skeptic\", and claimed to show that Carroll had fabricated quotations and misrepresented his arguments. Carroll countered these accusations in an addendum to his piece.\n\nCarroll wrote two Skeptic's Dictionary entries that criticize Rupert Sheldrake's ideas. The first criticized Sheldrake's N'kisi Project, which is a set of experiments that claim to have proven the existence of a telepathic link between N'kisi (a grey parrot) and its owner Aimee Morgana. Carroll criticized Sheldrake for omitting 60% of the data he collected when calculating the statistical significance of the parrot's responses. Carroll also wrote an entry in his Mass Media Bunk blog criticizing Jane Goodall for her involvement in the N'kisi Project. The second entry challenged Sheldrake's morphic resonance idea, in which Sheldrake proposed that each species has a \"morphogenetic field\" that evolves similarly to how the species' genes might evolve. He then proposed that these fields organize the nervous system's activity and can act as a collective memory for the whole species, and that these fields get passed down into the species by a kind of resonance called morphic resonance.\n\nSheldrake replied to Carroll's criticism by writing an article on his website defending his own arguments and accusing Carroll of committing several logical fallacies, misusing his scientific knowledge, misinterpreting and manipulating data, as well as being prejudiced. He also criticized The Skeptic's Dictionary, claiming that it would not survive had it been subject to independent peer reviews.\n\nCarroll did not believe in an omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent god. However, in his essay \"Why I am not an atheist\", Carroll described his dislike of the term \"atheist\" because he felt that the term was being exploited by theists and used as a straw man argument. He felt that the term implied a dogmatic set of beliefs and carried its own share of negative baggage. So, Carroll suggested that atheists might as well adopt the term \"Brights\" with all its negative connotations.\n\nThe only religion that Carroll found attractive after abandoning Catholicism, despite never following it, was Buddhism as taught by the Dalai Lama.\n\nCarroll always maintained the opinion that people have to be more skeptical of religion than they are now. He said in multiple interviews that religion is an area that skeptics don't target enough, and that pure faith is winning the race against critical thinking.\n\nCarroll tended to have a moderate outlook on religion. He believed that religion has a role to play in people's lives and he didn't condemn religion for terrorism. When asked about the relationship between violence and religion he said that he can't recall anything negative about his religious upbringing, and that maybe Catholicism can provide more good than harm. He didn't believe religion causes wars, he rather believed that it serves as an excuse for people who will go to war regardless of religion's existence. Carroll believed that some people rely on religion as their only source of morality and as a source of comfort.

She was the wife of the Belgian Minister of Justice Albert Lilar and mother of the writer Françoise Mallet-Joris and the art historian Marie Fredericq-Lilar.\n\nShe was a member of the Royal Academy of French Language and Literature from 1952 to 1992.\n\nLilar's mother was a middle school teacher, her father a railway station master. After having lived her youth in Ghent, and following a brief first marriage, she moved to Antwerp where she became the first woman lawyer, and where in 1929 she married the lawyer Albert Lilar who would later become a Minister of Justice and Minister of State (Liberal Party). She was the mother of the writer Françoise Mallet-Joris (b. 1930) and the 18th century art historian Marie Fredericq-Lilar (b. 1934). After the death of her husband in 1976, she left Antwerp and relocated to Brussels in 1977.\n\nIn 1919 Lilar attended the State University of Ghent where she studied philosophy and was the first woman to receive a Law degree in 1925. During her studies she attended a seminar on Hadewych. Her interest in the 13th century poet and mystic would play an important role in her later essays, plays and novels. Lilar's historico-cultural insight, her analysis of consciousness and emotion, her search for beauty and love are at the same time current and timeless.\n\nApplying a strong intellect to her work through precise language, she was a thoroughly modern writer and feminist who nonetheless remained highly versed in many areas of traditional western thought (Encyclopædia Britannica). In 1956 Lilar succeeds Gustave Van Zype as member of the Royal Academy of French Language and Literature. Her oeuvre has been translated in numerous languages.\n\nLilar began her literary career as a journalist, reporting on Republican Spain for the newspaper \"L'Indépendance belge\" in 1931. She later became a playwright with \"Le Burlador\" (1946), an original reinterpretation of the myth of Don Juan from the female perspective that revealed a profound capacity for psychological analysis. She wrote two more plays, \"Tous les chemins mènent au ciel\" (1947), a theological drama set in a 14th-century convent, and \"Le Roi lépreux\" (1951), a neo-Pirandellian play about the Crusades.\n\nHer earliest essays are on the subject of the theatre. \"Soixante ans de théâtre belge\" (1952), originally published in New York City in 1950 as \"The Belgian Theater since 1890\", emphasizes the importance of a Flemish tradition. She followed this with \"Journal de l'analogiste\" (1954), in which the origin of the experience of beauty and poetry was guided by a path of analogies. A short essay \"Théâtre et mythomanie\" was published in 1958. Transcendence and metamorphosis are central to her seminal work \"Le Couple\" (1963), translated in 1965 by Jonathan Griffin as \"Aspects of Love in Western Society.\" In writings on Rubens, the Androgyne or homosexuality in Ancient Greece, Lilar meditates on the role of the woman in conjugal love throughout the ages. Translated into Dutch in 1976, it includes an afterword by Marnix Gijsen. In the same vein she later wrote critical essays on Jean-Paul Sartre (\"À propos de Sartre et de l'amour\", 1967) and Simone de Beauvoir (\"Le Malentendu du Deuxième Sexe\", 1969).\n\nLilar wrote two autobiographical books, \"Une Enfance gantoise\" (1976) and \"À la recherche d'une enfance\" (1979), and two novels, both of which date from 1960, \"Le Divertissement portugais\" and \"La Confession anonyme\", a neoplatonic idealization of love filtered through personal experience. The Belgian director André Delvaux recreated this novel on film as \"Benvenuta\" in 1983, transposed as an intense examination of a tortured but exalted relationship between a young Belgian woman and her Italian lover. \"Les Moments merveilleux\" and \"Journal en partie double, I & II\" were published as part of \"Cahiers Suzanne Lilar\" (1986).\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Even that his father Peer Meher Ali Shah said, “Who will make the disciple on his hand, then I am responsible for him.” \n\nFollowing the example of his father, Ghulam Mohiyuddin was a firm adherent to the concept of Ibn Arabi's ideology of \"Wahdat-ul-Wajood\" (Ultimate Unity of Being). According to him, the Divine Will is at work behind all that is happening in the universe. The Divine Will which is absolute and everlasting manifests itself in the diverse aspects of this universe.\n\nSyed Ghulam Mohiyyuddin played an important part in the Pakistan Movement.

He extended a helping hand to even those families wishing to cross the border and live in India. He would take piles of clothing and dry rations to supply to those who were arriving in a state of deplorable misery. As reported by a large number of non-Muslims refugees here and across the border, they were deported to their places with great security and he paid special attention to their protection.\n\nWhen the 1965 India-Pakistan war started, Babuji addressed the people of Pakistan via Radio Pakistan.

This organization believed that their teachings had been given to humanity by the Ascended Masters. These were believed to be individuals who had lived in physical bodies, acquired the wisdom and mastery needed to become immortal and free of the cycles of \"re-embodiment\" and karma, attaining in this way their \"Ascension\". They considered the \"ascension\" to be the complete, permanent union of the purified outer self with the \"I AM\" Presence—meaning that true identity that is the unique individualization of God for each person.\n\nThe members of The Bridge to Freedom claim that a Dispensation and Sponsorship was given by the Ascended Masters for this \"Ascended Master Activity\" to be an outer organization representing the \"Great Brotherhood of Light\", and a continuation of previous efforts by the Ascended Masters to bring Illumination to mankind through Theosophy, Agni Yoga, and the \"I AM\" Activity.\n\nThe members of The Bridge to Freedom believe that Ascended Master El Morya contacted Geraldine Innocente in 1944 and asked her to make a certain application on a daily basis. The story is told that Morya returned one year later asking if she would consent to receive a series of Discourses from the Maha Chohan. Geraldine is said to have agreed, and she then underwent years of training in preparation for her role in the 1950s as a Messenger for the Ascended Masters, the Archangels, Cosmic Beings, the Elohim, and Others of the Spiritual Hierarchy. She served officially in the capacity of Messenger beginning with the inaugural Vesta Dictation on July 17, 1951, until her transition on June 21, 1961.\n\nThe Bridge to Freedom claims that in 1952 the Ascended Master Saint Germain stated that:\n\n\" . . . It was never intended to start a 'new' Activity, but to broaden the field of service of the present Activity, by engaging the competent and willing service of lifestreams not presently allowed full expression of their talents in 'widening the borders of the Father's Kingdom.' Many hundreds of thousands of souls have not been privileged to receive the Instruction brought forth in My Name, due to barriers of language, limitation in the production and distribution of illuminating literature and the unhappy 'excommunications' which resulted from misunderstanding of a human nature. . . . A way and means by which We might reach the consciousness of the people had to be devised. 'The Bridge' was the solution to this problem. Mrs. Ballard was informed prior to any other individual of the purpose for which The Bridge came forth and was courteously invited to allow Us the opportunity of supporting her work and performing through other well qualified individuals the task of reaching other lifestreams than those presently blessed by the knowledge of The \"I AM\" Activity. . . . The Sun cannot limit its shining to one beam, nor the Love of God to one human consciousness, no matter how well attuned it may have been to the Vibrations of the Masters. The souls of men are our concern, all men, of all colors, all countries, because from the Flame in their hearts will come the Illumination which will make this Dark Star a Flaming Sun of Freedom. . . . \" \n\nIt is believed that in September 1952, the Master Morya explained (through Geraldine Innocente) the purpose of the founding of The Bridge to Freedom:\n\n\" . . . The beloved Maha Chohan gave Me a limited Grant, saying that the response of the few whom I had chosen would determine whether I could continue such an association. With well justified trepidation, I endeavored to correspond with the most likely and promising of those who professed to love Us and Our Way. Their response made it possible for Me to continue this Endeavor. Now many good and fine lifestreams, like a golden chain, girdling the Earth, make it possible for Us to transmit the current Action of the Brothers around the planet and bless all life and stimulate all souls by this universal service. This is the purpose of The Bridge, The Bulletin, and this expanded service which is but a part of the one Plan, even as the foundation is laid and a beautiful Spiritual Edifice built thereon. Without the Hierarchy, the Earth would long ago have passed into oblivion, the electrons which compose it returned to the universe, and the souls depending upon it for existence snuffed out like candles before the wind. . . . \" \n\n\n"}
{"id": "13766053", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13766053", "title": "Truth by consensus", "text": "Truth by consensus\n\nIn philosophy, truth by consensus is the process of taking statements to be true simply because people generally agree upon them. Imre Lakatos characterizes it as a \"watered down\" form of provable truth propounded by some sociologists of knowledge, particularly Thomas Kuhn and Michael Polanyi.\n\nPhilosopher Nigel Warburton argues that the truth by consensus process is not a reliable way of discovering truth. That there is general agreement upon something does not make it actually true.<br>\nThere are two main reasons for this:\n\n\nAnother unreliable method of determining truth is by determining the majority opinion of a popular vote. This is unreliable because on many questions the majority of people are ill-informed. Warburton gives astrology as an example of this. He states that while it may be the case that the majority of the people of the world believe that people's destinies are wholly determined by astrological mechanisms, given that most of that majority have only sketchy and superficial knowledge of the stars in the first place, their views cannot be held to be a significant factor in determining the truth of astrology. The fact that something \"is generally agreed\" or that \"most people believe\" something should be viewed critically, asking the question why that factor is considered to matter at all in an argument over truth. He states that the simple fact that a majority believes something to be true is unsatisfactory justification for believing it to be true.\n\nWarburton makes a distinction between the fallacy of truth by consensus and the process of democracy in decision-making. Democracy is preferable to other processes not because it results in truth, but because it provides for equal participation by multiple special-interest groups, and the avoidance of tyranny.\n\nWeinberger characterizes Jürgen Habermas as a proponent of a consensus theory of truth, and criticizes that theory as unacceptable on the following grounds: First, even if everyone's opinion is in agreement, those opinions may all nonetheless be erroneous. Second, truth by consensus is conceived as a limit that is approached via an idealized process of discourse; however, it has not been proven that discourse even tends towards such a limit, or that discourse even tends towards \"one single\" limit, and thus it is not proven that truth is the limit that is approached by ideal discourse and consensus.\n"}

The contest rules define a task, and a malicious component. Entries must perform the task in a malicious manner as defined by the contest, and hide the malice. Contestants are allowed to use C-like compiled languages to make their programs.\n\nThe contest was organized by Dr. Scott Craver of the Department of Electrical Engineering at Binghamton University (New York State). The contest was initially inspired by Daniel Horn’s Obfuscated V contest in the fall of 2004. For the 2005 to 2008 contests, the prize was a $100 gift certificate to ThinkGeek. The 2009 contest had its prize increased to $200 due to the very late announcement of winners, and the prize for the 2013 contest is also a $200 gift certificate.\n\nThe domain for the website has expired as of 2018-10-17.\n\nThe 2005 contest had the task of basic image processing, such as resampling or smoothing, but covertly inserting unique and useful \"fingerprinting\" data into the image. Winning entries from 2005 used uninitialized data structures, reuse of pointers, and an embedding of machine code in constants.\n\nThe 2006 contest required entries to count word occurrences, but have vastly different runtimes on different platforms. To accomplish the task, entries used fork implementation errors, optimization problems, endian differences and various API implementation differences. The winner called strlen() in a loop, leading to quadratic complexity which was optimised out by a Linux compiler but not by Windows.\n\nThe 2007 contest required entries to encrypt and decrypt files with a strong, readily available encryption algorithm such that a low percentage (1% - 0.01%) of the encrypted files may be cracked in a reasonably short time. The contest commenced on April 16 and ended on July 4. Entries used misimplementations of RC4, misused API calls, and incorrect function prototypes.\n\nThe 2008 contest required entries to redact a rectangular portion of a PPM image in a way that the portion may be reconstructed. Any method of \"blocking out\" the rectangle was allowed, as long as the original pixels were removed, and the pixel reconstruction didn't have to be perfect (although the reconstruction's fidelity to the original file would be a factor in judging). The contest began on June 12, and ended on September 30. Entries tended to either xor the region with a retrievable pseudo-random mask or append the masked data to the end of the file format. The two placing programs both used improperly defined macros while the winner, choosing to work with an uncommon text based format, zeroed out pixel values while keeping the number of digits intact.\n\nThe 2009 contest required participants to write a program that sifts through routing directives but redirects a piece of luggage based on some innocuous-looking comment in the space-delimited input data file. The contest began December 29, 2009, and was due to end on March 1, 2010. However, no activity occurred for three years. The winners were only announced on April 1, 2013, with one overall winner and six runners-up.\n\nThe 2013 contest was announced on April 1, 2013, and was due July 4, 2013; results were announced on September 29, 2014. It was about a fictional social website called \"ObsessBook\". The challenge was to write a function to compute the DERPCON (Degrees of Edge-Reachable Personal CONnection) between two users that \"accidentally\" computes a too low distance for a special user.\n\nThe 2014 contest was announced on November 2, 2014, and was due January 1, 2015. The results were announced on June 1, 2015. The object was to write surveillance code for a Twitter-like social networking service, to comply with a secret government surveillance request; but for non-obvious reasons, the code must subtly leak the act of surveillance to a user.\n\nThe 2015 contest was announced on August 15, 2015, and was due November 15, 2015. The results were announced on January 15, 2016. The scenario was a nuclear disarmament process between the Peoples Glorious Democratic Republic of Alice and the Glorious Democratic Peoples Republic of Bob, and the mission was to write a test function for comparing potentially fissile material against a reference sample, which under certain circumstances would label a warhead as containing fissile material when it doesn't.\n\n"}

Apart from moral virtue, examples of personal values include friendship, knowledge, beauty etc. and examples of political values, justice, equality and liberty. This article will outline some current ideas relating to the first group - personal values. It will begin by looking at the kinds of thing that have value and finish with a look at some of the theories that attempt to describe what value is. Reference will be made solely to Western sources although it is recognised that many, if not all, of the values discussed may be universal.\n\nIt is only in the last hundred years or so that the subject of value has become a subject of study in its own right. A new field of enquiry called “axiology” (from the Greek \"axios\" meaning “worth”), defined as “the philosophical study of goodness or value”, began to emerge at around the beginning of the twentieth century, and its significance lay in extending the scope of the term “value” into fields other than traditional ethics. R.H.Lotze, F.Brentano and G.E.Moore have been cited as early proponents of the subject, and to Moore is attributed the important distinction made between intrinsic and instrumental value, that is, between things that have value in themselves and things that might lead to something of value. \n\nExamples of recent articles which introduce the subject include Mark Schroeder’s \"Value Theory\", Elinor Mason’s \"Value Pluralism\" and Michael Zimmerman’s \"Intrinsic and Extrinsic Value\". Schroeder defines axiology as being “primarily concerned with classifying what things are good”, and, in accepting that there might be a number of things that can be valued or called good, he asks is there, underlying these, just one or is there more than one fundamental intrinsic value. Mason outlines two ways in which values have been considered in relation to one another: the first is called “monist”, which maintains that there is just one intrinsic value to which all other values are auxiliary; and the second is called “pluralist”, which maintains that there are many kinds of value and that the most important of these are irreducible to one another. Typical of the first school were the Utilitarians, such as Jeremy Bentham, who thought that all the values that a person might hold could be reduced to a desire for happiness or pleasure. Immanuel Kant, too, has been described as a monist in saying that the only good in itself lies in possessing a good will. Regarding those holding pluralist views, Zimmerman in his book \"The Nature of Intrinsic Value\" (2012) gives some examples of more recent philosophers with lists of the kinds of thing that they thought had value: \n\nBrentano (1889): Pleasure, Happiness, Love, Knowledge, Beauty, Proportion, Intention, Exercise, Virtue \n\nMoore (1908) - Aesthetics, Affection, Knowledge, Consciousness, Pleasure, Virtue\n\nRoss (1936) - Virtue, Pleasure, Knowledge, Artistic activity\n\nIn particular, Zimmerman singles out the work of William Frankena who, in his book \"Ethics\" (1963), gave a comprehensive list of values and who, besides suggesting the use of headings, began to group similar values together. It will be useful to discuss these in the following groups:\n\n1. Beauty, harmony, proportion, aesthetic experience\n\n2. Moral disposition, virtue, pleasure, happiness, contentment\n\n3. Truth, knowledge, understanding, wisdom, honour, esteem\n\n4. Life, health, strength, peace, security\n\n5. Love, affection, friendship, cooperation\n\n6. Power, achievement, freedom, adventure, novelty\n\nFrankena, in formulating his list, builds on what he called the “classical triad” of beauty, goodness and truth and headings similar to these terms can be used to introduce a primary set of values as follows.\n\nFrankena in his list of values groups beauty with harmony, proportion and aesthetic experience. There are many different kinds of value that can be included in this category and Frankena himself distinguishes between “harmony and proportion in objects contemplated” and “harmony and proportion in one’s own life”. He refers to Plato who, firstly, in the \"Philebus\" suggests that aesthetic pleasure lies in the “beauty of colour and form”, and secondly in the \"Republic\" that formal features like harmony and proportion are important not only to art and music but also to the “good life” which itself should contain “form”, “variety” and “balance”. \n\nAnother distinction results from the question of whether aesthetic value resides in the object contemplated or in the contemplative experience itself. James Shelley in his article \"The Concept of the Aesthetic\" notes that the term \"aesthetic\" in deriving from the Greek \"aesthesis\", which means perception or awareness, tends towards the latter interpretation; George Dickie in his book \"Art and the Aesthetic\" charts the development of awareness and consciousness in their growing importance to aesthetic theory; and Zimmerman refers to G.E.Moore who wrote in relation to art and beauty that “by far the most valuable thing we know or can imagine are certain states of consciousness”. Both Frankena and Nicolai Hartmann, who Frankena mentions, begin their lists of values with groups including consciousness, life and existence, and Hartmann makes reference to Nietzsche who considered that the value of beauty in art or nature lay in an increased awareness of life as an “affirmation of existence”.\n\nShelley describes another concept apart from “immediacy” or “focussing one’s attention on the subject” and this is the concept of “disinterestedness\", a Kantian term which consists in looking at things objectively and impartially. He refers to Schopenhauer who realised that if perception were to be the only criterion of aesthetic value then, with a mind stripped of practical interest and cultural preconceptions, anything at all might be seen as beautiful: “One thing is only taken as more beautiful than another because it makes this pure contemplation easier”, wrote Schopenhauer, a view criticised by Sartwell for making the term beauty, ultimately meaningless. Shelley, however, manages to elucidate various criteria of aesthetic value from such a standpoint: firstly, that there is value in simple formal relations, in harmony, grace and balance, and in fact in any other objective aspect that a good critic might care to point to; secondly, that there is value in recognising that people have natural tastes and preferences, whether, for example, they prefer “drama or comicality”, or whether the work is striking in some way; and thirdly, that there is value in recognising the presence of “non-exhibited properties”, realising that the work, or perception, is located within an “art-historical context” where only knowledge of, in Danto’s terminology, an “artworld” can facilitate our feeling “the proper sentiments”.\n\nIn addition to the views that aesthetic value lies either in the object or in the subjective experience there is a third view which suggests that value lies in some kind of engagement between the two. G.E.Moore wrote that it is neither in the “beautiful object” nor in the “conscious perception” where value is found but in the relationship between the two. Shelley too concludes with the idea that there is some reciprocal relationship between subject and object, his example being that of a Bartok quartet, where “a value originally belonging to the quartet has been transferred to the experience, before being reflected back, once again, onto the quartet.”\n\nThe second group of values listed by Frankena includes happiness, virtue, pleasure, satisfaction and contentment - values traditionally associated with the field of ethics. Zimmerman introduces Plato whose recurring concern was with the nature of the good, how we should live our lives, and whether it is pleasure or virtue that will lead to happiness. Regarding pleasure, he considers food, drink and shelter to be simple goods – people value them, they value the work that goes into providing them and the pleasure that comes from enjoying them. Zimmerman after asking why eating should be considered a value refers to Aristotle who said that value resides in “the proper activity or functioning of things according to their nature” and that it is the “active exercising of man’s faculties that give rise to pleasure”. \n\nRegarding virtue, Elinor Mason refers to J.S.Mill who made the distinction between lower values and higher values. The distinction is that between efficient cause and final cause: whereas efficient cause includes hunger, thirst and the need for shelter, final cause arises from our having an overview of the relation of cause and effect whereby we can determine the end we want to achieve and then decide the means to achieve it. If the end is well-being or happiness then such values as friendship, knowledge and beauty, as well as material sustenance, might be instrumental in achieving this. Mason refers to G.E.Moore who, whilst recognising the virtues of “industry and temperance”, recognised that there exists a “plurality of bearers of value”. Love, beauty and friendship are intrinsic values (i.e. good in themselves) rather than instrumental values, and they do not lead in all cases necessarily either to pleasure or happiness. \n\nAnother significant writer on value, mentioned by both Frankena and Zimmerman, is John Dewey who questioned whether intrinsic values exist at all. All values for Dewey were instrumental. He compared life to an “ongoing stream” of cause and effect, which he called the “continuum of means and ends”, where for example a lack of food leads to human activity leading to a further expenditure of energy, the need for more food and so on. He maintained, like Aristotle, that value lay in economy and in the efficient functioning of a human being in terms of a whole range of needs and wants. These needs arise from a constant “interaction between a human being and his environment” and Dewey introduced the notion of having a “framework” of values to deal effectively with the various categories of being which contribute to our environment.\n\nThe third of the classical values - truth – is listed by Frankena alongside knowledge, understanding and wisdom. Given that “truth may never be fully known” he shifted the emphasis onto knowledge, and most lists of values now tend to include knowledge rather than truth as one of the primary values. Jesse Prinz in \"Culture and Cognitive Science\" took this further discussing the relativity of the terms knowledge and truth and the role that culture has in shaping knowledge. This relativity is more pronounced in a second group listed by Frankena, a group which included the values of honour, esteem and good reputation. The link between the two groups was noted by Hartmann who realised that the terms “truth” and “truthfulness” involved two different, although related, kinds of value. Whilst truth is associated with the values of knowledge and understanding, truthfulness is associated with the values of honesty, uprightness and integrity.\n\nIn his article, Prinz defines culture as a complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morality and custom where the value associated with these things is acquired by people as members of society. This acquisition takes place through observing role models, imitating one’s parents or learning through association with others. The telling of stories is mentioned and we may think of the value of books, whether fiction or non-fiction, and the worth of films or news programmes in disseminating knowledge and furthering understanding generally. Memory too has its place, and the importance of history in this respect is highlighted by Zimmerman who notes that some things may have value, not because they are beautiful or useful, but because they have meaning through either personal or cultural associations, for example a rare stamp or the pen with which Lincoln signed his letters. \n\nKnowledge of both culture and subculture is important in understanding people’s values. Jacobson in an article on fitting attitudes tells us that what people find funny or shameful, honourable or dishonourable are culturally related, and he refers back to Brentano who introduced the related value of what is appropriate, suitable or fitting. Such values, however, can be considered not only from the point of view of a particular culture but from “the point of view of the universe” where integrating one’s set of values with the principles of some higher truth (“selective copying” is the example he gives) may result in instances of non-conformity and other kinds of differentiation within society. The concept of “fittingness” introduces the value of integrity which Cox, La Caze and Levine discuss in their article \"Integrity\" [2001]. The concept is defined in terms of the relation between the different aspects of one’s life – aesthetic, social, intellectual etc. – and in maintaining some sort of balance between them to give a sense of unity or wholeness. Views on integrity range from the practical requirements of honesty and truthfulness on the one hand, where Aristotle could write “with a true view all the data harmonise and with a false view the facts soon clash”, to more general approaches regarding meaning and identity, or “wisdom and self-knowledge”. \n\nThe end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries saw an expansion in the number of values over and above the “classical” or primary values of beauty, goodness and truth. Some, like love, friendship and affection, clearly come from the Christian tradition and were discussed by philosophers like Moore and Brentano. A more complex group revolving around concepts such as power, spirit and the will were introduced as values by Brentano and Hartmann and owe as much to the thoughts of Kant and Schopenhauer as they do to Christianity. The emergence of a third group of values can be seen as a result of the expansion of the field away from traditional ethics, and in this group there begin to appear more material values – what Plato called the “goods of the body” – such as life, health and strength in the lists of Hartmann and Frankena. \n\nSome early attempts were made at compiling a longer set of values and three of these can be mentioned here. R.B.Perry, referred to by Frankena, and whose work \"The General Theory of Value\" [1926] was called “the magnum opus of the new approach” by the Encyclopaedia Britannica, increased the total number of categories by adding to the fields of aesthetics, ethics and knowledge the three further fields of religion, economics and politics; An earlier work, \"Lebensformen\" [1914], by the psychologist, Eduard Spranger, set out a similar list describing six types of personality, namely the Aesthetic, Economic, Theoretic, Religious, Social and Political; and Gordon Allport, who studied under Spranger, and who was mentioned in Peterson and Seligman’s \"Character Strengths and Virtues\" [2004] , together with Vernon and Lindzey, set out in their \"Study of Values\" [1950] six types of personality each of which was orientated towards a different set of values: \n\nPersonality\n\nValues\nThese early links between philosophy and psychology have been discussed recently by C.B.Miller in his article entitled \"Empirical Approaches to Moral Character\" and this concluded with a look at the work of Peterson and Seligman. Their classification of values, \"Values in Action\" or VIA, arose from an empirical survey of virtues taken from around the world, which led to a six-fold classification, similar to the above, and comprising: Transcendence, Temperance, Wisdom, Justice, Humanity and Courage. Miller suggested, however, that no valid reason has been discovered as to why there should be six categories.\n\nRegarding the content of these additional categories it is clear that their representative values differ according to who is compiling the list. One theory suggests that if the first three categories represent the cognitive or classical tradition, then the additional categories represent the non-cognitive - the “sentimental” or “emotivist” tradition - where neither the cognitive nor the non-cognitive necessarily takes primacy. Zimmerman suggested that values taken from the latter viewpoint could be seen as just expressions of feeling or emotion about what is important. A.M.Taylor in her paper, \"Investigation into Facts and Values\" [1983], suggested that there was a fundamental difference between values based on analytical understanding and values based on synthetic or “wholistic” understanding. The older values taken from the “aesthetic, moral and scientific spheres” were not enough and new categories would be required to include such concepts as “creativity, feeling and innovation”. Jacobson also introduced a distinction between cognitive and non-cognitive values, and among the values derived from feeling or sentiment he included those of being “pride-worthy, shameful, funny and fearsome”. He mentioned David Hume in this respect who had used the three headings of “Pride and Humility”, “Love and Hatred” and “Will and the Direct Passions” in the second volume of his \"Treatise of Human Nature\" and it will be useful to look at the second group of values in this order.\n\nFrankena’s list of values begins with a group that contains life, health and strength and in this he closely follows Hartmann. “Material goods” were discussed by Hartmann in the introductory section of his book,\"The Realm of Ethical Values\" [1926] in relation to wealth and economics. Frankena mentions Plato who had referred to wealth, health and strength as “goods of the body”. Regarding wealth, Frankena, in a discussion of “money, cars and other material possessions”, suggested that its value might be either instrumental or contributory, the latter term being defined in terms of “things that are good because they contribute to a good life or are parts of it”. Money for a miser becomes part of his happiness, just as clothes, house or land may be a part of happiness for somebody else. Jacobson introduced the value of being “pride-worthy” and he mentioned David Hume who had noted that people take pride in, such “external advantages as… country, family, children, gardens, houses, dogs and clothes”. Elinor Mason mentioned the practical wisdom of Aristotle who saw wealth as a matter of prudence, and who advised people to value and “not to neglect” what belongs to them. \n\nHealth on the other hand, in relation to the body and the mind, is usually thought of as an intrinsic value. Frankena, for example, wrote that we desire health “for its own sake”, and Zimmerman wrote that “Being healthy is just a good way to be”. The value that we ascribe to life itself and the value of “just being” have been mentioned previously, but it was Hartmann who reintroduced the notion from earlier German philosophy that Being has a complementary category, namely that of Becoming. Everything is subject to change over time, and without human intervention, is subject to deterioration and decay. In relation to this, Mason referred to Immanuel Kant one of whose principal values lay in duty, particularly, in this respect, duty to self, and looking after the “basic stuff” through physical exercise and maintenance. Plato had also thought that the right way of living lay in “medicine, bathing and exercise” but Kant added to this idea by saying that value also lay in self-improvement through the cultivation of any “natural talents and gifts of fortune” that a person might possess. James Griffin in his book on \"Well-Being\" [1986] similarly introduced the value of “accomplishment” and how, in Aristotle’s terminology, we might grow and “flourish” in other ways. \n\nTo the classical triad of beauty, goodness and truth various philosophers in the twentieth century began to add values from another large family: that of, in Frankena's words, “love, friendship, mutual affection and cooperation”; G.E.Moore added “love” to the values of beauty, moral quality and knowledge; and Jacobson added “friendship” to the values of beauty, pleasure and knowledge. Moore, in reflecting Christianity’s emphasis on the importance of love, suggested that “… the love of love is by far the most valuable good we know… more complicated than beauty… more complicated than knowledge”. Both Frankena and Zimmerman mentioned Plato, who had outlined various kinds of love in the \"Symposium\", and who had described \"sympatheia\" or coaffection , as “filling men with affection… kindness… friendship… forgiveness”. For Plato, the soul was the seat of love and the affections, and its value lay in recognising the “community of feeling among mankind”. Jacobson referred to David Hume who similarly linked love with sympathy, the latter feeling arising from “the great resemblance among human creatures”. \n\nOn a more practical level, Bernard Gert in his work on \"The Definition of Morality\" [2002] introduced the notion of “loyalty” as a factor in establishing a sense of community among family and kinship groups. Regarding wider society, Gert mentioned Kant who distinguished between the values of not harming other people on the one hand and performing positive, charitable acts on the other. Zimmerman also mentioned Kant and his view that the only thing that is good without qualification is goodwill or benevolence. Kant had defined friendship as “the coming together of two persons through mutual love, each particating and sharing their lives in a sympathetic manner”. He also introduced the concept of “respect” by which he meant keeping an appropriate distance from others within the community, and he talked of community itself in terms of “being able to communicate… to perfect social intercourse… and to cultivate a disposition of… reciprocity… agreeableness… courtesy… hospitality”. \n\nCommunication was introduced as a separate value by Perry; and Hartmann, after working through the primary values, introduced a “second group” which included not only “brotherly love” but also “social intercourse”. Frankena introduced Aquinas who had stressed the value of communication in human relationships saying that “there are close parallels between the communication of words and that between lover and beloved”. Gert too realised that there was value in “interpersonal interaction” but queried how such a value could apply in the absence of other people, for example, on a desert island. Frankena answered the question by widening the scope of love to include love of, or communion with, God, animals, nature and the environment.\n\nTowards the end of his list, Frankena included the values of power and achievement, freedom, adventure and novelty. Regarding freedom, he introduced Schopenhauer who saw life as a continuous engagement with the realm of strife, a struggle against desire and the “primal will”, where the only moments of freedom that a person may have lay in art, music and spiritual contemplation. Strength and freedom of the will were values for Hartmann too, and also for Kant who, as Zimmerman noted, saw such freedom lying in the absence of coercion either from external agencies of from internal “sensuous impulses”. These latter included emotions such as desire, fear, hope and anger, whose value, or power, lay, according to Aristotle, in moving a person either towards or away from some perceived object. Griffin distinguished between desire itself and “informed desire”, where the value of the latter lay in stirring the mind, not involuntarily through emotion and natural inclination, but through the voluntary power of the will. Attitudes can be controlled through strength of mind, courage and self-discipline, and “corrected”, according to Brentano, through an informed choice about what is right, fitting or appropriate. \n\nFrankena recorded that his list included “all the things that Hartmann mentions”, but it is notable that Hartmann completed his list with what he called “spiritual goods” such as “love of the remote” and, in a Nietzschian phrase, “radiant virtue”. Love of the remote referred to either love of the wilderness or love of God, but Michael Stocker in \"Plural and Conflicting Values\" [1990] suggested that value lay more, as Plato had said, not in love but in the “contemplation” of God or of what is good: “He who proceeds aright”, said Plato, “should begin in youth to visit beautiful places… to contemplate the vast sea… until on that shore he grows and waxes strong”. In the Jewish tradition it was not so much the sea that bestowed strength, but the hills, and Griffin referred to those who value mountains for the excitement or the sublimity that they might afford. Frankena referred to the values of adventure and novelty that A.N.Whitehead had introduced, but it was Ralph Waldo Emerson in the previous century who had written about the inspirational value of new things and of travel, not only for the sake of art or study, but for the value of the experience itself. Hartmann suggested that it might be a great work of art such as a cathedral or a piece of music that might be inspiring, and he mentioned Nietzsche who wrote regarding art: “What does all art do? Does it not select? Does it not highlight? By doing these art strengthens certain values… It is the great stimulus of life”. Alternatively it might be humour that lifts the spirits and Jacobson discusses the value that different kinds of humour, such as being funny or being amusing might merit.\n\nVarious theories have been put forward in the West to try and define what a value “is” – as opposed to saying what kinds of value a thing may “have”. There are generally held to be three kinds of theory at present that attempt to answer the question of what a value is and these have been borrowed from the field of ethics. Each group of theories tends to concentrate on different aspects of the subject so that if ethics can be defined as, say, the principles governing the conduct of a person then the first group of theories (ontology and deontology) looks at the principles themselves, the second group of theories (teleology and consequentialism) looks at the aims and outcomes of conduct, and the third group of theories (virtue ethics and fitting-attitude theory) looks at the concept of the person, their character and attitudes.\n\nOntology (from the Greek \"Ontos\" meaning “being” or “that which is”) is that branch of metaphysics which deals with being, and, particularly in relation to value theory, with the “ontological categories” or plain categories of being. Zimmerman mentions G.E.Moore who pointed out that before discussing what we ought to value we should consider the possibility that anything that exists might be of value to somebody: “If we recognise that anything whatever may be good… we start with a much more open mind”. Zimmerman introduced the concept of “supervenience” through which it is held that any structuring of our values will reflect the structuring of the underlying categories of being themselves. Kant is mentioned by Zimmerman in this respect, and also Christine Korsgaard who, drawing on Kant’s distinction between things-in-themselves and the relation between things, draws a similar distinction between intrinsic values (values in virtue of “non-relational properties”) and extrinsic values (values in virtue of “relational properties”). Regarding the former an impasse is reached when all that can be said of intrinsic values is, in Moore’s words, that goodness “just is”, or in Zimmerman’s words that pleasure “just is”. This has led to some, like Monroe Beardsley, to say that only extrinsic values, in the final analysis, exist. Different kinds of extrinsic value in this model derive from the different underlying categories of relation, the example given being those of beauty, utility and meaning, each of which is supervenient on one of Kant’s three categories of relation, namely disjunction, causality and inherence respectively. \n\nDeontology, on the other hand, (from the Greek \"Deon\" meaning “duty”) is the branch of ethics that bases value on moral principles which in turn form a guide to knowing what \"ought\" to be done in various situations. The problem in philosophy of moving from an “is” to an “ought” (the “Is-ought problem\") is said to have been introduced into philosophy by David Hume. Richmond Campbell, in discussing this, asks how one might move from a knowledge of what exists, i.e. from a whole range of possible values, to a knowledge of which, among these, one ought to value. Given that “a small number of core moral values are espoused universally” the answer would appear to lie in giving priority to those which do not “conflict”. Frankena suggested that these moral principles are derived from three main sources: the prevailing moral rules of a culture; divine revelation as found in the holy texts; and logical or metaphysical deduction. Kant’s categorical imperative is given as an example of the latter, although Frankena pointed out that a distinction would need to be made between arguments of logical necessity, i.e. those which contain no contradictions, and arguments of logical sufficiency which would be needed to account for the various kinds of value, whether “aesthetic, prudential or logical”.\n\nMark Schroeder in his article on \"Value Theory\" considers consequentialism to be “under the umbrella” of teleology, where the latter can be defined as that branch of metaphysics which deals with the final end or purpose of things (the Greek \"Telos\" meaning “the end or purpose of an action”). According to this group of theories things are instrumentally valuable which help to achieve either specific or general ends, and underlying this, Schroeder tells us, is the relation of cause and effect. Frankena defined instrumental value as that which is good or useful for some purpose and he referred to Aristotle who, besides defining different kinds of cause, defined the good as “that at which all things aim”. If for example the aim is to live a good life those things will be good or valuable which constitute the means for achieving such an end. However, what is good for a specific person and what is good for the world as a whole are two different things and are reflected, according to Schroeder, in the ideas of egoism and consequentialism respectively. Regarding the latter, Zimmerman writes that a value is good because of a perceived final end in which “all the consequences taken as a whole are good”. \n\nRegarding the end at which people aim, Bentham, according to Elinor Mason, thought that the sole end was that of “pleasure”, and that all other values such as beauty, friendship, knowledge etc could be measured in accordance with the quantity of pleasure which each might afford. John Stuart Mill suggested that there were lower and higher pleasures and that these were fundamentally incommensurable. He went on to question, like Plato, whether the values of pleasure or satisfaction were in fact the ends at which intelligent people should aim. Mason also refers to James Griffin who was of the opinion that “well-being” was a better name for such an end, and which he saw in terms of “flourishing” or a “maximisation of life” in all its aspects. A “balancing of elements” is required whereby those activities which we value for well-being, such as work, rest, love, solitude, health, accomplishment etc. should be considered “in various combinations” in order to afford a “framework” or a “plan of life” for ourselves. This way of thinking was called by Elizabeth Anderson, in her article on John Dewey, “objective list theory” as opposed to theories like Bentham’s based on pleasure or those of Dewey based on “informed desire”. Dewey rejected the notion of a final end arguing instead that the “value of means and ends are reciprocally determined”. According to Zimmerman, he challenged traditional metaphysical ideas with a more “pragmatic” approach saying that only through “calm, informed reflection” on the ways in which people “interact with the environment” and deal with the ensuing consequences can value be ascertained.\n\nMason in her article on \"Value Pluralism\" introduces virtue ethics as a third way of thinking about the subject of value and describes it as being based on how a person should “be” rather than what a person should “do”. Frankena had similarly introduced an “ethics of virtue” as a third approach (following deontology and consequentialism), suggesting that there were two kinds of things that we can value: either the things around us like knowledge or physical objects; or the things inside us like our disposition, attitudes and emotions. Among the latter were the virtues and these he defined as dispositions to act in certain ways. Regarding the virtues, we can either value them in their own right or we can ask whether they tell us something about the nature of value itself. Hursthouse and Pettigrew deal with the first of these options in their article on \"Virtue Ethics\", asking questions like “how many virtues are there” and “how do they relate to each other”. C.B.Miller, on the other hand, in his article on moral character points to recent work which suggests that the categories used to structure the virtues are the same as those that can be used to structure values. The six “core virtues” listed by Peterson and Seligman have been found to be useful, for example, in the structuring of values in their “Values in Action” or VAI. \n\nOne of the similarities between virtue theory and fitting-attitude theory is that they both approach the subject of value through an emphasis on the agent. They are “agent-centred” rather than “act-centred” theories, but whereas virtues are defined purely as a disposition to act, fitting-attitude theory embraces the act as well within its field of consideration. Roderick Chisholm in his book, \"Brentano and Intrinsic Value\" [1986] suggested that value lies, for example, not just in virtue but in “individuals acting virtuously” or not just in pleasure but in “individuals experiencing pleasure”. However, just as there is conceived to be a necessary interaction between the agent and the environment so there is, in other circumstances, a necessary engagement between the agent and an object. Jacobson in his article on \"Fitting-Attitude Theory\" suggests that there is a reciprocity between “facts about human nature” and “facts about the object”, and that “to be valuable” requires either that one’s “feelings are adequate to the object”, or that “the object is “fitting” in respect of some particular attitude. The concept of fittingness, or what might fit together, is extended to the relation between different values and, in particular, the possible conflicts between them, the examples given being between that of humour and good taste, or between what is considered funny and what is considered fair or just. Both Mason and Zimmerman discuss the problem of conflicting values, as did Philippa Foot who, in the field of virtue ethics, suggested that the answer to possible conflict lay in bringing the virtues, or values, into relation with one another saying “that even such concepts as love and justice can become dangerously distorted\" if not tempered with a consideration of other fundamental values.\n"}

He knew at least six languages, including Turkic, and is considered one of the early Turkologists. During his lifetime he compiled and documented the oral history of the region that was later published in Russian and became part of modern folklore.\n\nHis father was a Danish physician named Johan Christian von Dahl (1764 – October 21, 1821). He was a linguist versed in German, English, French, Russian, Yiddish, Latin, Greek and Hebrew languages. His mother, Maria Freitag, was of German and French descent (Huguenot). She spoke at least five languages and came from a family of scholars.\n\nThe prospective lexicographer was born in the town of Lugansky Zavod, in Novorossiya under the jurisdiction of Yekaterinoslav Governorate, part of Russian Empire, which is now Luhansk, Ukraine.\n\nDal served in the Russian Navy from 1814 to 1826, graduating from the St Petersburg Naval Cadet School in 1819. In 1826, he began studying medicine at Dorpat University and took part as a military doctor in the Russo-Turkish War (1828–1829) and the campaign against Poland in 1831–1832. Following disagreement with his superiors, he resigned from the Military Hospital in St. Petersburg and took an administrative position with the Ministry of the Interior in Orenburg Governorate, serving in similar positions in St. Petersburg and Nizhny Novgorod before his retirement in 1859.\n\nDal was interested in language and folklore from his early years. He started traveling by foot through the countryside, collecting sayings and fairy tales in various Slavic languages from the region. He published his first collection of fairy-tales in 1832 in Russian language. Some others, yet unpublished, were put in verse by his friend Alexander Pushkin and have become some of the most familiar texts in the Russian language. After Pushkin's fatal duel, Dal was summoned to his deathbed and looked after the great poet during the last hours of his life. In 1838, Dal was elected to the St Petersburg Academy of Sciences.\n\nIn the following decade, Dal adopted the pen name Kazak Lugansky (\"Cossack from Luhansk\") and published several realistic essays in the manner of Nikolai Gogol. He continued his lexicographic studies and extensive travels throughout the 1850s and 1860s. Having no time to edit his collection of fairy tales, he asked Alexander Afanasyev to prepare them for publication, which followed in the late 1850s. Joachim T. Baer wrote:\nWhile Dal was a skilled observer, he lacked talent in developing a story and creating psychological depth for his characters. He was interested in the wealth of the Russian language, and he began collecting words while still a student in the Naval Cadet School. Later he collected and recorded fairy tales, folk songs, birch bark woodcuts, and accounts of superstitions, beliefs, and prejudices of the Russian people. His industry in the sphere of collecting was prodigious.\nHis magnum opus, \"Explanatory Dictionary of the Live Great Russian language\", was published in four huge volumes in 1863–1866. \"The Sayings and Bywords of the Russian people\", featuring more than 30,000 entries, followed several years later. Both books have been reprinted innumerable number of times. Baer says: \"While an excellent collector, Dal had some difficulty ordering his material, and his so-called alphabet-nest system was not completely satisfactory until Baudouin de Courtenay revised it thoroughly in the third (1903–1910) and fourth (1912–1914) editions of the \"Dictionary\".\"\n\nDal was a strong proponent of the native rather than adopted vocabulary. His dictionary began to have a strong influence on literature at the beginning of the 20th century; in his 1911 article \"Poety russkogo sklada\" (\"Poets of the Russian Mold\"), Maximilian Voloshin wrote: \nJust about the first of the contemporary poets who began to read Dal was Vyacheslav Ivanov. In any case, contemporary poets of the younger generation, under his influence, subscribed to the new edition of Dal. The discovery of the verbal riches of the Russian language was for the reading public like studying a completely new foreign language. Both old and popular Russian words seemed gems for which there was absolutely no place in the usual ideological practice of the intelligentsia, in that habitual verbal comfort in simplified speech, composed of international elements.\nWhile studying at Cambridge, Vladimir Nabokov bought a copy of Dal's dictionary and read at least ten pages every evening, \"jotting down such words and expressions as might especially please me\"; Alexander Solzhenitsyn took a volume of Dal with him as his only book when he was sent to the prison camp at Ekibastuz. The encompassing nature of Dal's dictionary gives it critical linguistic importance even today, especially because a large proportion of the dialectal vocabulary he collected has since passed out of use. The dictionary served as a base for Vasmer's \"Etymological dictionary of the Russian language\", the most comprehensive Slavic etymological lexicon.\n\nFor his great dictionary Dal was honoured by the Lomonosov Medal, the Constantine Medal (1863) and an honorary fellowship in the Russian Academy of Sciences.\n\nHe is interred at the Vagankovskoye Cemetery in Moscow. To mark the 200th anniversary of Vladimir Dal's birthday, UNESCO declared the year 2000 The International Year of Vladimir Dal.\n\n\nDal served in the Ministry of Domestic Affairs. His responsibilities included overseeing investigations of murders of children in the western part of Russia.\n\nIn 1840, the Damascus Affair had revived the medieval blood libel canard in Europe (the anti-Semitic accusation that Jews use the blood of Christian children for ritual purposes), and Czar Nicholas I instructed his officials, especially Vladimir Dal, to thoroughly investigate the legend. In 1844, just 10 copies of a 100-page report, intended only for the czar and senior officials, were submitted. The paper was entitled \"Investigation on the Murder of Christian Children by the Jews and the Use of Their Blood.\" It was claimed there that although the vast majority of Jews had not even heard of ritual murder, it and the use of blood for magical purposes were committed by sects of fanatical Hasidic Jews. While the paper is often attributed to Dal, the question of the authorship (or multiple authorships) remains controversial.\n\nIn 1914, 42 years after Dal's death, during the blood libel trial of Menahem Mendel Beilis in Kiev, the then 70-year-old report was published in St. Petersburg under the title \"Notes on Ritual Murders\". The name of the author was not stated on this new edition, intended for the general public.\n\n\n"}
