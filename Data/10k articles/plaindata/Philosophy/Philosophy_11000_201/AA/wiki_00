This quality seems to have haunted Ten Rhyne at the Cape in 1673 and it struck the imagination of an early observer of strongly African-influenced dancing in Louisiana in the early nineteenth century, who noted \"thumping ecstasy\" and \"intense solemnity of mien.\" The mask of the cool, or facial serenity, has been noted at many points in Afro-American history: \nIt is interesting that what remains a spiritual principle in some parts of Africa and the rare African-influenced portions of the modern U.S.A., such as tidewater Georgia, becomes in the mainline Afro-American urban culture an element of contemporary street behavior:\nNegro boys…have a 'cool' way of walking in which the upper trunk and pelvis rock fore and aft while the head remains stable with the eyes looking straight ahead. The…walk is quite slow, and the Negroes take it as a way of 'strutting' or 'showing off'...\nThe cool style of male walking in the United States is called \"bopping\" ... Mystical coolness in Africa has changed in urban African-American assertions of independent power. But the functions, to heal and gather strength, partially remain.

{"id": "3408532", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3408532", "title": "Ajativada", "text": "Ajativada\n\nAjātivāda is the fundamental philosophical doctrine of the Advaita Vedanta philosopher Gaudapada. According to Gaudapada, the Absolute is not subject to birth, change and death. The Absolute is \"aja\", the unborn eternal. The empirical world of appearances is considered unreal, and not absolutely existent.\n\nGaudapada's perspective is based on the \"Mandukya Upanishad\", applying the philosophical concept of \"ajāta\" to the inquiry of Brahman, showing that Brahman wholly transcends the conventional understanding of being and becoming. The concept is also found in Madhyamaka Buddhism, as the theory of nonorigination.\n\nAjātivāda:\n\nTaken together \"ajātivāda\" means \"the Doctrine of no-origination\" or non-creation.\n\nThe concept of \"ajāta\" was borrowed by Gaudapada from Madhyamika Buddhism, which uses the term \"anutpāda\":\n\nTaken together \"anutpāda\" means \"having no origin\", \"not coming into existence\", \"not taking effect\", \"non-production\".\n\n\"Ajātivāda\" is the fundamental philosophical doctrine of Gaudapada. According to Gaudapada, the Absolute is not subject to birth, change and death. The Absolute is \"aja\", the unborn eternal. The empirical world of appearances is considered Maya (unreal as it is transitory), and not absolutely existent.\n\nGaudapada borrowed the concept of \"ajāta\" from Nagajurna's Madhyamaka philosophy. The Buddhist tradition usually uses the term \"anutpāda\" for the absence of an origin or śūnyatā.\n\nBut Gaudapada's perspective is quite different from Nagarjuna. Gaudapada's perspective is based on the \"Mandukya Upanishad\". In the \"Mandukya Karika\", Gaudapada's commentary on the \"Mandukya Upanishad\", Gaudapada sets forth his perspective. According to Gaudapada, Brahman cannot undergo alteration, so the phenomenal world cannot arise independently from Brahman. If the world cannot arise, yet is an empirical fact, than the world has to be an unreal (transitory) appearance of Brahman. And if the phenomenal world is a transitory appearance, then there is no real origination or destruction, only apparent origination or destruction. From the level of ultimate truth (\"paramārthatā\") the phenomenal world is \"māyā\", \"illusion\", apparently existing but ultimately not real.\n\nIn \"Gaudapada-Karika\", chapter III, verses 46-48, he states that Brahman never arises, is never born, is never unborn, it rests in itself:\nThe Ajativada of Gaudapada, states Karmarkar, has nothing in common with the Sunyavada concept in Buddhism. While the language of Gaudapada is undeniably similar to those found in Mahayana Buddhism, Coman states that their perspective is different because unlike Buddhism, Gaudapada is relying on the premise of \"Brahman, Atman or Turiya\" exist and are the nature of absolute reality.\n\nRamana Maharshi gave a translation in Tamil of Gaudapada’s \"Mandukya Upanishad Karika\", chapter two, verse thirty-two:\nAccording to David Godman, the ajata doctrine implies that since the world was never created, there are also no jivas within it who are striving for or attaining liberation. Ramana Maharshi regarded this as \"the ultimate truth.\"\n\nAdvaita took over from the Madhyamika the idea of levels of reality. Usually two levels are being mentioned, namely \"saṃvṛti-satya\", \"the empirical truth\", and \"paramārtha-satya\", \"ultimate truth\". According to Plott, \nThe distinction between the two truths (\"satyadvayavibhāga\") was fully expressed by the Madhyamaka-school. In Nāgārjuna's \"Mūlamadhyamakakārikā\" it is used to defend the identification of dependent origination (\"pratītyasamutpāda\") with emptiness (\"śūnyatā\"):\nShankara uses sublation as the criterion to postulate an ontological hierarchy of three levels:\n\nIt is at the level of the highest truth (\"paramārtha\") that there is no origination. Gaudapada states that, from the absolute standpoint, not even \"non-dual\" exists.\n\nMany scholars, states Richard King, designate Madhyamaka Buddhism as \"Ajativada\". The concept \"Ajati\", he adds, exists in both Vedanta and Buddhism, but they are different in the following way:\nAjativada in Madhyamaka refers to its doctrine that things neither originate nor is there cessation. This is also called the theory of non-origination of Madhyamaka.\n\n\n"}

The term has been popularized by Barney Stinson, a character from the television show \"How I Met Your Mother\". Katherine Connor Martin, head of content creation at Oxford Dictionaries, recognized Stinson as \"the quintessence of a certain iteration of the contemporary bro\".\n\nThe notion of an unwritten set of rules that govern the relationship between male friends is present in popular culture at least since 1991. In the \"Seinfeld\" episode \"The Stranded\", which aired on November 27 that year, Jerry Seinfeld says the following monologue, in one of his stand-up bits:\n\n\"Bros before hoes\" (that is, \"friends before women\") is a well-known, vulgar slang expression about how men should not abandon their male friends in order to pursue or embark on relationships with women.\n\nThe \"bros before hoes\" expression is often regarded as the \"golden rule\" of male friendship, and it has been common slang at least since 2001. It was used by \"The Office\" character Michael Scott in \"A Benihana Christmas\", and was later popularized by Barney Stinson.\n\nInspired by the notion of Bro Code that they developed in their sitcom, \"How I Met Your Mother\" creators Carter Bays and Craig Thomas, and one of the show's writers, Matt Kuhn, wrote a book called \"The Bro Code\".

The book was penned by Barney Stinson and also credited with Kuhn, who also wrote the entries of Barney's blog, mentioned in the series. The book was first shown in the episode \"The Goat\".

{"id": "65734", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65734", "title": "Bushido", "text": "Bushido\n\nThe \"way\" originates from the \"samurai\" moral values, most commonly stressing some combination of sincerity, frugality, loyalty, martial arts mastery, and honour until death. Born from Neo-Confucianism during times of peace in the Edo period (1600–1878) and following Confucian texts, while also being influenced by Shinto and Zen Buddhism, allowing the violent existence of the \"samurai\" to be tempered by wisdom, patience and serenity. \"Bushidō\" developed between the 16th and 20th centuries, debated by pundits who believed they were building on a legacy dating back to the 10th century, although some scholars have noted that the term \"bushidō\" itself is \"rarely attested in pre-modern literature\".\n\nUnder the Tokugawa shogunate, some aspects of warrior values became formalized into Japanese feudal law.\n\nThe word \"bushidō\" was first used in Japan during the 17th century in Kōyō Gunkan, but did not come into common usage until after the 1899 publication of Nitobe Inazō's \"\". In \"Bushido\" (1899), Nitobe wrote:\n\nBushidō, then, is the code of moral principles which the samurai were required or instructed to observe ... More frequently it is a code unuttered and unwritten ... It was an organic growth of decades and centuries of military career. In order to become a samurai this code has to be mastered.\n\nNitobe was the first to document Japanese chivalry in this way. In \"Feudal and Modern Japan\" (1896), historian Arthur May Knapp wrote:\n\nThe samurai of thirty years ago had behind him a thousand years of training in the law of honor, obedience, duty, and self-sacrifice ... It was not needed to create or establish them. As a child he had but to be instructed, as indeed he was from his earliest years, in the etiquette of self-immolation.\n\nMany early literary works of Japan talk of warriors, but the term \"bushidō\" does not appear in text until the Edo period.\n\nFrom the literature of the 13th to 16th centuries, there exists an abundance of references to military ideals, although none of these should be viewed as early versions of \"bushidō\" per se. Carl Steenstrup noted that 13th- and 14th-century writings (\"gunki monogatari\") \"portrayed the \"bushi\" in their natural element, war, eulogizing such virtues as reckless bravery, fierce family pride, and selfless, at times senseless devotion of master and man\".\n\nCompiled over the course of three centuries, beginning in the 1180s, the \"Heike Monogatari\" depicts a highly fictionalized and idealized story of a struggle between two warrior clans, the Minamoto and the Taira, at the end of the 12th century—a conflict known as the Genpei War. Clearly depicted throughout the epic is the ideal of the cultivated warrior. The warriors in the \"Heike Monogatari\" served as role models for the educated warriors of later generations, although the ideals depicted by them were assumed to be beyond reach. Nevertheless, during the early modern era, these ideals were vigorously pursued in the upper echelons of warrior society and recommended as the proper form of the Japanese man of arms. The influence of Shinto, Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism in the Bushido's early development instilled among those who live by the code a religious respect for it. Yamaga-Soko, the Japanese philosopher given credit for establishing Bushido, said that \"the first and surest means to enter into communion with the Divine is by sincerity.\" \n\nThe sayings of Sengoku-period retainers and warlords such as Katō Kiyomasa and Nabeshima Naoshige were generally recorded or passed down to posterity around the turn of the 16th century when Japan had entered a period of relative peace. In a handbook addressed to \"all \"samurai\", regardless of rank\", Katō states:\n\nKatō was a ferocious warrior who banned even recitation of poetry, stating:\n\nNaoshige says similarly, that it is shameful for any man to die without having risked his life in battle, regardless of rank, and that \"\"bushidō\" is in being crazy to die. Fifty or more could not kill one such a man\". However, Naoshige also suggests that \"everyone should personally know exertion as it is known in the lower classes\".\n\nJapan enjoyed a period of relative peace from 1600 to the mid-19th century. During this period, the \"samurai\" class played a central role in the policing and administration of the country. The \"bushidō\" literature of this time contains much thought relevant to a warrior class seeking more general application of martial principles and experience in peacetime, as well as reflection on the land's long history of war. The literature of this time includes:\n\n\nThe \"Hagakure\" contains many sayings attributed to Sengoku-period retainer Nabeshima Naoshige (1537–1619) regarding \"bushidō\" related philosophy early in the 18th century by Yamamoto Tsunetomo (1659–1719), a former retainer to Naoshige's grandson, Nabeshima Mitsushige. The Hagakure was compiled in the early 18th century, but was kept as a kind of \"secret teaching\" of the Nabeshima clan until the end of the Tokugawa \"bakufu\" (1867). His saying, \"I have found the way of the warrior is death\", was a summation of the focus on honour and reputation over all else that \"bushidō\" codified.\n\nTokugawa-era rōnin, scholar and strategist Yamaga Sokō (1622–1685) wrote extensively on matters relating to \"bushidō\", \"bukyō\" (a \"warrior's creed\"), and a more general \"shidō\", a \"way of gentlemen\" intended for application to all stations of society. Sokō attempts to codify a kind of \"universal \"bushidō\"\" with a special emphasis on \"pure\" Confucian values, (rejecting the mystical influences of Tao and Buddhism in Neo-Confucian orthodoxy), while at the same time calling for recognition of the singular and divine nature of Japan and Japanese culture. These radical concepts—including ultimate devotion to the Emperor, regardless of rank or clan—put him at odds with the reigning shogunate. He was exiled to the Akō domain, (the future setting of the 47 Rōnin incident), and his works were not widely read until the rise of nationalism in the early 20th century.\n\nThe aging Yamamoto Tsunetomo's interpretation of \"bushidō\" is perhaps more illustrative of the philosophy refined by his unique station and experience, at once dutiful and defiant, ultimately incompatible with the laws of an emerging civil society. Of the 47 \"rōnin\"—to this day, generally regarded as exemplars of \"bushidō\"—Tsunetomo felt they were remiss in hatching such a wily, delayed plot for revenge, and had been over-concerned with the success of their undertaking. Instead, Tsunetomo felt true \"samurai\" should act without hesitation to fulfill their duties, without regard for success or failure.\n\nThis romantic sentiment is of course expressed by warriors throughout history, though it may run counter to the art of war itself. This ambivalence is found in the heart of \"bushidō\", and perhaps all such \"warrior codes\". Some combination of traditional \"bushidō\"'s organic contradictions and more \"universal\" or \"progressive\" formulations (like those of Yamaga Sokō) would inform Japan's disastrous military ambitions in the 20th century.\n\nRecent scholarship in both Japan and abroad has focused on differences between the \"samurai\" caste and the \"bushidō\" theories that developed in modern Japan. \"Bushidō\" in the prewar period was often emperor-centered and placed much greater value on the virtues of loyalty and self-sacrifice than did many Tokugawa-era interpretations. \"Bushidō\" was used as a propaganda tool by the government and military, who doctored it to suit their needs. Scholars of Japanese history agree that the \"bushidō\" that spread throughout modern Japan was not simply a continuation of earlier traditions.\n\nMore recently, it has been argued that modern \"bushidō\" discourse originated in the 1880s as a response to foreign stimuli, such as the English concept of \"gentlemanship\", by Japanese with considerable exposure to Western culture. Nitobe Inazo's \"bushidō\" interpretations followed a similar trajectory, although he was following earlier trends. This relatively pacifistic \"bushidō\" was then hijacked and adapted by militarists and the government from the early 1900s onward as nationalism increased around the time of the Russo-Japanese War.\n\nThe \"junshi\" suicide of General Nogi Maresuke and his wife on the death of Emperor Meiji occasioned both praise, as an example to the decaying morals of Japan, and criticism, explicitly declaring that the spirit of \"bushidō\" thus exemplified should not be revived.\n\nDuring pre-World War II and World War II Shōwa Japan, \"bushido\" was pressed into use for militarism, to present war as purifying, and death a duty. This was presented as revitalizing traditional values and \"transcending the modern\". \"Bushidō\" would provide a spiritual shield to let soldiers fight to the end. As the war turned, the spirit of \"bushidō\" was invoked to urge that all depended on the firm and united soul of the nation. When the Battle of Attu was lost, attempts were made to make the more than two thousand Japanese deaths an inspirational epic for the fighting spirit of the nation. Arguments that the plans for the Battle of Leyte Gulf, involving all Japanese ships, would expose Japan to serious danger if they failed, were countered with the plea that the Navy be permitted to \"bloom as flowers of death\". The first proposals of organized suicide attacks met resistance because although \"bushidō\" called for a warrior to be always aware of death, they were not to view it as the sole end. Nonetheless, the desperate straits brought about acceptance and such attacks were acclaimed as the true spirit of \"bushidō\".\n\nPrisoners of war denied being mistreated and declared that they were being well-treated by virtue of \"bushidō\" generosity. Broadcast interviews with prisoners were also described as being not propaganda but out of sympathy with the enemy, such sympathy as only \"bushidō\" could inspire.\n\n\"Bushidō\" expanded and formalized the earlier code of the \"samurai\", and stressed sincerity, frugality, loyalty, mastery of martial arts, and honour to the death. Under the \"bushidō\" ideal, if a \"samurai\" failed to uphold his honor he could only regain it by performing \"seppuku\" (ritual suicide).\n\nIn an excerpt from his book \"Samurai: The World of the Warrior\", historian Stephen Turnbull describes the role of seppuku in feudal Japan:\n\nIn the world of the warrior, seppuku was a deed of bravery that was admirable in a samurai who knew he was defeated, disgraced, or mortally wounded. It meant that he could end his days with his transgressions wiped away and with his reputation not merely intact but actually enhanced. The cutting of the abdomen released the samurai’s spirit in the most dramatic fashion, but it was an extremely painful and unpleasant way to die, and sometimes the samurai who was performing the act asked a loyal comrade to cut off his head at the moment of agony.\n\n\"Bushidō\" varied dramatically over time, and across the geographic and socio-economic backgrounds of the \"samurai\", who represented somewhere between 5% and 10% of the Japanese population. The first Meiji-era census at the end of the 19th century counted 1,282,000 members of the \"high \"samurai\"\", allowed to ride a horse, and 492,000 members of the \"low samurai\", allowed to wear two swords but not to ride a horse, in a country of about 25 million.\n\nSome versions of \"bushidō\" include compassion for those of lower station, and for the preservation of one's name. Early \"bushidō\" literature further enforces the requirement to conduct oneself with calmness, fairness, justice, and propriety. The relationship between learning and the way of the warrior is clearly articulated, one being a natural partner to the other.\n\nOther pundits pontificating on the warrior philosophy covered methods of raising children, appearance, and grooming, but all of this may be seen as part of one's constant preparation for death—to die a good death with one's honor intact, the ultimate aim in a life lived according to \"bushidō\". Indeed, a \"good death\" is its own reward, and by no means assurance of \"future rewards\" in the afterlife. Some \"samurai\", though certainly not all (e.g., Amakusa Shirō), have throughout history held such aims or beliefs in disdain, or expressed the awareness that their station—as it involves killing—precludes such reward, especially in Buddhism. Japanese beliefs surrounding the \"samurai\" and the afterlife are complex and often contradictory, while the soul of a noble warrior suffering in hell or as a lingering spirit occasionally appears in Japanese art and literature, so does the idea of a warrior being reborn upon a lotus throne in paradise\n\nThe \"bushidō\" code is typified by eight virtues:\nBe acutely honest throughout your dealings with all people. Believe in justice, not from other people, but from yourself. To the true warrior, all points of view are deeply considered regarding honesty, justice and integrity. Warriors make a full commitment to their decisions.\nHiding like a turtle in a shell is not living at all. A true warrior must have heroic courage. It is absolutely risky. It is living life completely, fully and wonderfully. Heroic courage is not blind. It is intelligent and strong.\nThrough intense training and hard work the true warrior becomes quick and strong. They are not as most people. They develop a power that must be used for good. They have compassion. They help their fellow men at every opportunity. If an opportunity does not arise, they go out of their way to find one.\nTrue warriors have no reason to be cruel. They do not need to prove their strength. Warriors are not only respected for their strength in battle, but also by their dealings with others. The true strength of a warrior becomes apparent during difficult times.\nWhen warriors say that they will perform an action, it is as good as done. Nothing will stop them from completing what they say they will do. They do not have to 'give their word'. They do not have to 'promise'. Speaking and doing are the same action.\nWarriors have only one judge of honor and character, and this is themselves. Decisions they make and how these decisions are carried out are a reflection of who they truly are. You cannot hide from yourself.\nWarriors are responsible for everything that they have done and everything that they have said and all of the consequences that follow. They are immensely loyal to all of those in their care. To everyone that they are responsible for, they remain fiercely true.\n\n\nModern Western translation of documents related to \"bushidō\" began in the 1970s with Carl Steenstrup, who performed research into the ethical codes of famous \"samurai\" including Hōjō Sōun and Imagawa Sadayo.\n\nPrimary research into \"bushidō\" was later conducted by William Scott Wilson in his 1982 text \"Ideals of the Samurai: Writings of Japanese Warriors\". The writings span hundreds of years, family lineage, geography, social class and writing style—yet share a common set of values. Wilson's work also examined older Japanese writings unrelated to the warrior class: the Kojiki, Shoku Nihongi, the Kokin Wakashū and the Konjaku Monogatari, as well as the Chinese Classics (the Analects, the Great Learning, the Doctrine of the Mean, and the Mencius).\n\nIn May 2008, Thomas Cleary translated a collection of 22 writings on \"bushidō\" by warriors, scholars, political advisers, and educators, spanning 500 years from the 14th to the 19th centuries. Titled \"Training the Samurai Mind: A Bushido Sourcebook,\" it gave an insider's view of the samurai world: \"the moral and psychological development of the warrior, the ethical standards they were meant to uphold, their training in both martial arts and strategy, and the enormous role that the traditions of Shintoism, Buddhism, Confucianism, and Taoism had in influencing samurai ideals\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2157753", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2157753", "title": "Catharine Trotter Cockburn", "text": "Catharine Trotter Cockburn\n\nCatharine Trotter Cockburn (16 August 1679 – 11 May 1749) was a novelist, dramatist, and philosopher. She wrote on moral philosophy, theological tracts, and had a voluminous correspondence.\n\nTrotter's work addresses a range of issues including necessity, the infinitude of space, and the substance, but she focuses on moral issues. She thought that moral principles are not innate, but discoverable by each individual through the use of the faculty of reason endowed by God. In 1702, she published her first major philosophical work, \"A Defence of Mr. Lock's [sic.] An Essay Concerning Human Understanding\". John Locke was so pleased with this defence that he made gifts of money and books to his young apologist acting through Elizabeth Burnet who had first made Locke aware of Trotter's \"Defence\". \n\nHer work attracted the attention of William Warburton, who prefaced her last philosophical work. She also had a request from the biographer Thomas Birch to aid him in compiling a collection of her works. She agreed to the project but died before the work could be printed. Birch posthumously published a two-volume collection entitled \"The Works of Mrs. Catharine Cockburn, Theological, Moral, Dramatic, and Poetical\" in 1751. It is largely through this text that readers and history have come to know her.\n\nCatharine Trotter was born in London, on 16 August, 1674 or 1679. Both her parents were Scotch. Her father, Captain David Trotter, was a commodore in the Royal Navy, personally known to King Charles II, and the Duke of York, who admired his high qualities and appreciated his distinguished services. Captain Trotter assisted in the demolition of Tangier in 1683, and being subsequently sent to convoy the fleet of merchant ships belonging to the Turkey Company, died of the plague at Alexandretta (Iscanderoon), early in the year 1684. His property having fallen into dishonest hands, the two-fold affliction of bereavement and poverty fell at once upon his widow and children. Her mother was Sarah Bellenden, a near relation of Lord Bellenden, and of the Duke of Lauderdale, and the Earl of Perth.\n\nTrotter was raised Protestant but converted to Roman Catholicism at an early age.\n\nDuring the short remainder of King Charles II.’s reign, Mrs. Trotter had a pension from the Admiralty, and Queen Anne made her an allowance of 20 £ a-year. It is to be supposed that the widow also received assistance from her husband’s brother, and from her own high-born and wealthy cousins, in bringing up her two fatherless children. Both were daughters. The elder married Dr. Inglis, a medical officer, who attended the Duke of Marlborough in his campaigns, and became physician-general to the army.\n\nCatharine, the youngest, was early remarkable for her sagacious intellect, for her facility in acquiring knowledge, her cleverness in teaching herself the art of penmanship, and her delight in making extemporary verse. Nothing is recorded of her education, but from her own allusion to it in her \"Poem on the Busts\", it may be inferred to have been slight and ordinary. Nothing, however, could repress her eager desire for information; and obstacles, as usual, proved incentives to effort. She read with avidity, and wrote with emulative zeal; works of imagination occupying, as in such cases they are wont, her childish attention; and these, as her reasoning powers matured, and her judgment became formed, giving place to tractates and treatises on moral philosophy and religion. She taught herself the French language, and, with the assistance of a friend, acquired the Latin. Her \"Verses written at the age of fourteen, and sent to Mr. Beville Higgons, on his sickness and recovery from the small-pox\", though rather a bold avowal of sympathy with the “lovely youth,” and of admiration for his matchless charms,” were evidently well-meant admonitions to resignation, and to the conscientious application of the high qualities and fine “parts” ascribed to him.\nHer muse was always didactic, and although her \"Songs\", after the fashion of her time, were full of amatory context, they inculcated self-government and morality. The professional connections of her father, the aristocratic relationships of her mother, and the celebrity early won by her own extraordinary talents, gained her a large circle of acquaintance; and although straitened in the means of subsistence, and probably possessing little of her own but the earnings of her pen, Trotter moved in the best society, and was a frequent and welcome guest in the houses of the rich and great. Her beauty, and the unaffected sweetness of her manners, bore the charm of unasserted mental superiority.\nTrotter was a precocious and largely self-educated young woman, who had her first novel (\"The Adventures of a Young Lady\", later retitled \"Olinda's Adventures\") published anonymously in 1693, when she was but 14 years old. Her first published play, \"Agnes de Castro\", was staged two years later, in the year 1695, at the Theatre Royal, and printed in the following year, with a dedication to the Earl of Dorset and Middlesex, from which it appears that his Lordship was one of her personal friends and advisers. This tragedy was not based upon historic fact, but upon Aphra Behn’s English translation of a French novel.\n\nIn 1696, she was famously satirised alongside Delarivier Manley and Mary Pix in the anonymous play, \"The Female Wits\". In it, Trotter was lampooned in the figure of \"Calista, a lady who pretends to the learned languages and assumes to herself the name of critic.\" The following year, Trotter addressed to William Congreve a set of complimentary verses on his \"The Mourning Bride\", and thus either created or strengthened the interest which that poet took in her literary proceedings. His published letter to her shows that they had been previously acquainted. \n\nIn 1698, her second tragedy and arguably best-liked play, \"Fatal Friendship\", was performed at the then-new theatre in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields. It was afterwards printed with a dedication to the Princess of Wales, and not only established Trotter's reputation as a dramatic writer, and brought a shower of complimentary verses, but increased the number of her powerful, fashionable, and eminent friends. It may reasonably be supposed, produced great pecuniary profit. \n\nPrefixed to her \"Fatal Friendship\" are many sets of eulogistic verses addressed to the authoress; one by P. Harman, who also wrote the prologue; one by an anonymous writer, probably Lady Sarah Piers; and yet another, written by the playwright, John Hughes, who hailed her as “the first of stage reformers.” The language is plain and unaffected, but occasionally deformed, after the colloquial fashion introduced at the Restoration, by the abbreviated words “ ’em” for them. The plot is commonplace, but well complicated, and it produces some good dramatic situations. The moral drawn at the conclusion is:— “None know their strength, let the most resolute Learn from this story to distrust themselves, Nor think by fear the victory less sure; Our greatest danger is when we’re most secure.\" This tragedy, having been deemed by contemporary critics of the time as the best of Trotter's dramatic compositions, left the reader little cause to join in Dr. Birch's regret that want of space enforced the omission of the four other plays from his edition of her works.\n\nIn 1700, she was one of the presumptuous Englishwomen who, under the several names of the Nine Muses, bewailed in verse the death of John Dryden. She was consequently praised and addressed as a Muse by a troop of admiring rhymers.\n\nEarly in the year 1701, her comedy of \"Love at a Loss, or Most Votes carry it\", was performed at the Theatre Royal, and published in the month of May of the same year, with a dedication to Lady Piers. “She had,” remarks Dr. Birch, “contracted a very early esteem for, and most intimate and unreserved friendship,” with Trotter. Later in the same year, her third tragedy, \"The Unhappy Penitent\", was performed at Drury Lane, and published in August, with a dedication to Lord Halifax, and a set of verses, by Lady Piers, prefixed, inscribed “To the excellent Mrs. Catherine Trotter”. Also in 1701, she wrote her \"Defence of Mr. Locke’s Essay of Human Understanding\", and it was published in May, 1702. This gained for her the personal friendship of Locke and of Lady Masham, and was, through them, the means of introducing her to many eminent persons, among them being Mr. Peter King, then a barrister and member of parliament, who was the maternal nephew of Locke.\n\nConsidering the position and connections of her parents, it is probable that Trotter had not been trained at an early age to piety, and consequently when a crisis of the soul occurred, she probably met with a Roman Catholic teacher, and, as a natural result, she zealously adopted his creed. In this she continued for many years, resting quiescently upon its first impressions. Meanwhile, her strict observance of the fast-days proved so injurious to her health, that in October, 1703, her friend and physician, Dr. Denton Nicholas, wrote her a letter of serious remonstrance upon the subject, and desired her “to abate of those rigours of abstinence, as insupportable to a constitution naturally infirm,” requesting that his opinion might be communicated to her friends and to her confessor.\n\nHer health, even at its best, was too delicate to allow her to walk more than a mile to church and back, on a summer's day, without fatigue which amounted to illness; and a weakness of sight always rendered it painful to her to write by candlelight. Yet this fragile woman possessed self-relying energy which enabled her not only to sustain the mental and manual labour of careful literary composition through continuous months and years, but also to transact with methodical exactness all the complicated business attendant upon the performance, printing, and publication of her works.\n\nFrom 1701, until her marriage in 1708, Catherine Trotter kept up a regular correspondence with her friend George Burnet, Esq., of Kemnay. During the greater part of the period he traveled in foreign lands, and more especially at the courts of Berlin and Hanover, where be spread the fame of “la nouvelle Sappho-Ecossoise,” and excited the curiosity of Leibnitz to become acquainted with her philosophical works. It may be inferred from many passages in his letters that he would gladly have raised for himself an amorous interest with this young friend; and from hers, that, with unaffected candour and cordial esteem, she repelled every approach towards a declaration of love. She had many admirers, but never was led by the persuasions of her friends, or the temptations of wealth and rank, to encourage the addresses of men for whom she felt no preference.\n\nIn 1704, Trotter composed a poem on the Duke of Marlborough's gaining the battle of Blenheim, which, being highly approved of by the hero and his family, was put into print. About that period she had some hopes of obtaining, through the powerful interest of the Marlborough family, a pension from the crown, to which her father's long services and losses in the cause of his King and country gave a plausible claim. This, however, she failed to obtain, and received only a gratuity. After the battle of Ramilies, in 1706, she produced another poem in praise of the Duke of Marlborough, and on both occasions her verses were ranked among the best which recorded his fame. In the same year, her tragedy, called \"The Revolution of Sweden\", founded on Vertot's account of Gustavus Ericson, was performed at the Queen's Theatre in the Haymarket; and subsequently printed, with a dedication to Lady Harriet Godolphin, eldest daughter of the great Duke, and after his decease Duchess of Marlborough in her own right.\n\nHer sister, Mrs. Inglis, residing at Salisbury, and her mother spending much of her time there, Catherine was induced to make long visits to that city, extending sometimes to the period of fifteen months. But her favourite abode was at “Mr. Finney’s, in Beaufort Buildings on the Strand,” where, in private lodgings, she could, without domestic restraint or the disturbance of young children, give herself up to literary occupations. Among the happy results of her sojournings at Salisbury was her acquaintance with Bishop Gilbert Burnet, and with his third wife, Elizabeth, eldest daughter of Sir Richard Blake, and widow of Robert Berkeley, Esq, of Spetchley. Mrs. Burnet, who had a large, independent income, took an affectionate interest in Trotter until Mrs. Burnet died in 1709.\n\nIn Trotter's mind a sense of duty towards God, and a desire to reform and benefit the world, were ever predominant; but at different periods of her life she sought to effect this object by different means. In the year 1707, after a course of severe study, deep reflection, and earnest prayer, she abjured the Roman Catholic faith, and wrote and published her \"Two Letters concerning a Guide in Controversies\", to which a preface by Bishop Burnet was prefixed. The first letter was addressed to Mr. Bennet, a priest, and the second to Mr. Harman, as a rejoinder to an answer which she had received. She made strong, clear and reasoned arguments for her change of faith. No scruple ever again affected her staunch adherence to the orthodox faith of the Church of England.\n\nIn the summer of 1707, while staying with Madame de Vere, an invalid who resided at Ockham Mills, near Ripley, Surrey, she met with a young clergyman named Fenn, of whose preaching, conversation, and character, she thoroughly approved. Mr. Fenn fell deeply in love with her, made her an offer of marriage, and obtained for his suit the sanction and intercession of Lady Piers. Catherine Trotter accepted his friendship, and, but for the preference she already felt for another person, would have judged it right to marry him. The favoured rival was Rev. Patrick Cockburn, a scholar and a gentleman, distantly related to the Burnet family and to her own, with whom she had for some months held a friendly correspondence, in which they discussed those subjects of philosophical and practical religion which were of principal interest to both. The addresses of Mr. Fenn brought mutual conviction, and matters came to a climax.\n\nRev. Cockburn confessed his love, proposed, and was accepted. He took holy orders in the Church of England in 1708, married Trotter, received the “Donative” of Nayland, near Colchester, and, leaving his bride in London to arrange her affairs and to purchase furniture, he took possession of his pastoral charge in June, and welcomed her to their new home in the autumn of the same year.\n\nHow long they resided there, neither Dr. Birch nor Trotters's writings suggest; but, in the course of time, Rev. Cockburn accepted the curacy of St. Dunstan's Church, Fleet-street, and returned with his family to London, where they resided until the year 1714, when the death of Queen Anne took place. The oath of abjuration required on the accession of King George I. aroused scruples in the mind of Rev. Cockburn, and he refused to take it, although he conscientiously offered up the public prayers for the reigning sovereign and the royal family. He was consequently deprived of his employment in the church, and reduced to poverty. During the next twelve years, he maintained his family by teaching Latin to the students of the Academy in Chancery Lane, while his wife, ever anxious for self-improvement, took up household duties, industriously applied herself to needlework, and all sorts of manual occupations, and cheerfully devoted her faculties to the solace of her husband, and to the education of her children.\n\nFrom the year of her marriage, 1708, until 1724, Trotter had published nothing. In the latter year, she wrote her \"Letter to Dr. Holdsworth\", and having sent it to him, and received an elaborate controversial answer, she published her \"Letter\" in January, 1727. To this, Dr. Winch Holdsworth publicly replied, and Trotter wrote an able rejoinder; but the booksellers not being willing to undertake its responsibility, the \"Vindication of Mr. Locke’s Christian Principles from the injurious imputations of Dr. Holdsworth\", remained in manuscript until it was published among her collected works.\n\nThe best of her productions in verse was \"A Poem, occasioned by the Busts set up in the Queen’s Hermitage, designed to be presented with a book in vindication of Mr. Locke, which was to have been inscribed to Her Majesty\". With considerable skill and persuasive sweetness she drew an argument from the honour done by Queen Caroline to the busts of Clarke, Locke, and Newton, and the patronage which Her Majesty had extended even to the rural bard, Nicholas Duck. Although much has been said and written about Locke by the ablest metaphysicians of his age, and of each succeeding generation, it may be questioned whether his own meaning in his own words has ever been more truly construed than by Trotter. What she wrote concerning his opinions during his life was approved by Locke himself; what she wrote of them after his decease was acknowledged to be correct by his most intimate associates, to whom he had frequently and familiarly expounded them.\n\nIn 1726, Rev. Cockburn convinced himself of the propriety of taking the Oath of Abjuration upon the ascension of George I, to which he had so long objected. He was appointed to St. Paul's Chapel in Aberdeen in the following year. Thither he was accompanied by his family; and his wife bade, in that year, an everlasting farewell to London, the scene of her many triumphs and many trials.\n\nSoon after their removal, her friend, the Lord High Chancellor King, presented her husband to the living of Long Horseley, near Morpeth, in the county of Northumberland; but they continued at Aberdeen until the year 1737, when the Bishop of Durham ordered him to take up his residence in his parish. The clerical residence stood so far from the church of Long Horseley, that when rough weather and feeble health disabled Trotter from riding on horseback to attend the Sunday services, she was constrained to stay at home, unless a still more distant neighbor, Mrs. Ogle, chanced to be in the country, and to give her a seat in her chaise and four, or her coach and six.\n\nIn 1732, while living at Aberdeen, she wrote the \"Verses occasioned by the Busts in the Queen’s Hermitage\", which were printed in the \"Gentleman’s Magazine\" for May 1737. In August, 1743, her \"Remarks upon some Writers in the Controversy concerning the Foundation of Moral Duty and Obligation\" were published in a serial called \"The History of the Works of the Learned\". These ‘\"Remarks\" were well received, and excited great admiration, and Trotter's friend, Dr. Sharp, archdeacon of Northumberland, having read them in manuscript, engaged her in an epistolary discussion on the subject of which they treat. The correspondence began August 8, 1743, and was concluded October 2, 1747.\n\nDr. Rutherford's \"Essay on the Nature and Obligations of Virtue\" having appeared in 1744, her active mind was again aroused for public controversy, and in April 1747, her \"Remarks upon the Principles and Reasonings of Dr. Rutherford’s Essay on the Nature and Obligations of Virtue, in Vindication of the contrary Principles and Beasonings enforced in the Writings of the late Dr. Samuel Clarke\", were published with a preface by Bishop Warburton. The extraordinary reputation acquired by this able work, suggested to some friends, who submitted the scheme to Lady Isabella Finch, the thought of raising a subscription for the republication of all Trotter's works, which the author herself undertook to edit. This plan was zealously supported by Trotter's fashionable and eminent friends, but uncontrollable circumstances prevented its full execution.\n\nIn some verses entitled \"Calliope’s Directions how to Deserve and Distinguish the Muse’s Inspirations\", the strong, clear sense of Trotter is conspicuously shown by her definition of the uses of tragic, comic, and satiric poetry. Of course, as Calliope, she presided only over heroic strains and general eloquence, and it would have been inappropriate to treat of any other kind of verse. The quotation of a few lines demonstrates the style:—\n\nTrotter's long suspension from writing -sixteen to eighteen years- was noted by the public, as was her resumption of writing. The commentators upon her works over-restrained her own words on the first part of this subject, and drawn from them an unwarranted inference. It should be understood that during those years, Trotter read few new books, yet she had undoubtedly possessed her Bible, the works of Shakespeare and Milton, of Lord Bacon, Cudworth, and Bishop Cumberland. She had lived so long in the propulsive centre of British activity that, when sunk into obscurity, the gathering in of her reflections enriched her more than continued opportunities of observation would have done; and her fine faculties were kept bright and keenly edged by constant use. Extracts of her controversial writings show her style.\n\nIn the preface to her \"Letter to Dr. Holdsworth\", Trotter said the following, with the person here alluded to probably being Lord King:—\n\nIn a letter to her niece, dated “Long Horseley, September 29, 1748,” Trotter said:—\n\nIt is interesting to know Trotter's opinion of the most illustrious of all her contemporaries, Bishop Butler. In letters to Mrs. Arbuthnot, written at Aberdeen, in 1738, she thus mentions him:—\n\nIn letters of subsequent date, Mrs. Cockburn repeatedly mentioned Bishop Butler with a still deeper sense of the value of his writings. Dating from “Long Horseley, October 2, 1747,” and again addressing Mrs. Arbuthnot, she said the following, which was an all-sufficient exposition of Trotter's theological opinions:— \n\nMr. and Mrs. Cockburn had three daughters, Mary, Catherine, and Grissel, and one son, John. A letter of advice to the former, written by his mother for his guidance in early manhood, is full of wisdom and piety. Religion, employment, and women, are the subjects of her discourse. Under the second she says :—“ Divinity is the profession you have been designed for from your birth; but let no views determine your choice to that sacred calling but a sincere desire of promoting the glory of God, and the salvation of men.”\n\nIn subsequent letters to her niece, Mrs. Arbuthnot, Trotter often alludes to her “good son” with all the satisfaction of a happy mother. In 1743, a daughter died; and in January, 1749, her husband did as well. Under this severe shock, her feeble health gave way. Trotter died at Longhorsley near Morpeth on 11 May 1749. She was buried beside her husband and her youngest daughter, at Longhorsley, and on their tomb was inscribed one sentence, altered from Proverbs xxxi. 31, “Let their own works praise them in the gates.”\n\nDespite her one-time renown, Trotter's reputation has steadily waned over the last three centuries and has only been rescued from near obscurity by the efforts of feminist critics, such as Anne Kelley, in the last two decades. Arguably, the predicament of her reputation is attributable to her having written a large amount of work very early in her life and less in her mature years. In other words, her career was extremely front-loaded, and the literati of her period (especially the men) tended to focus on her youth and beauty at the expense of her work. Some literary historians attribute her relative obscurity to a persistent emphasis being placed upon her philosophical work at the expense of her creative writing (especially by her biographer Thomas Birch, who included only one play in his two volume collection of her work and did not mention \"Olinda's Adventures\" at all). Though skillful, her philosophical writings were sometimes dismissed as derivative, especially her defence of Locke's Essay—a judgment that could hardly help her reputation.\n\nMuch of the scholarly interest in Trotter's dramatic writing now centres on gender studies. Indeed, Trotter herself was cognisant of the limitations her gender placed upon her and often voiced her protest in writing. In the dedication to \"Fatal Friendship\" (1698), for example, she remarks that \"when a Woman appears in the World under any distinguishing Character, she must expect to be the mark of ill Nature,\" especially if she enters into \"what the other Sex think their peculiar Prerogative.\" Both Trotter's literary works, in which women dominate the action, and her personal life provide rich subject matter for feminist criticism.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He studied in Frankfurt an der Oder and Halle (Saale). In 1766 he gained his master's degree in philosophy. From 1770 until 1772 he was extraordinary professor of mathematics and logic in Leipzig. From 1772 he was in Breslau, where he was active as a bookseller. The greatest part of his life was however spent staying with his mother in Breslau. In this city he also became a member of the Masonic Lodge \"Friedrich zum goldenen Zepter\" (\"Frederick of the Golden Scepter\").\n\nGarve became well-known particularly for his intensive activity as a translator (producing versions of, e.g., Cicero's \"De Officiis\" (1783) and Adam Smith's \"Wealth of Nations\"). His translation of Cicero's work was done at the request of Frederick II, who bestowed upon him a pension of 200 thalers. Garve eulogized Frederick in the \"Fragmente zur Schilderung des Geistes, Charakters and der Regierung Friedrichs II.\" (1798).\n\nHe composed psychological, moral and economic texts and reviews for the \"Neue Bibliothek der schönen Wissenschaften und der freyen Künste\" (\"New Library of the Beautiful Sciences and Free Arts\"). He was strongly marked by the influence of the English and Scottish Enlightenment as well as Stoic ethics. He never formulated his essentially empirical philosophy in terms of a system, publishing his thought in the form of remarks and essays. As a result, he was reproached for being merely a shallow \"Popularphilosoph\" (popular philosopher), a reputation he has retained, and his writings did much toward the popularization of philosophy in Germany.\n\nOf interest is his engagement with Immanuel Kant, which was initiated by a review of Kant's \"Critique of Pure Reason\" in the \"Göttinger Gelehrten Anzeigen\" (\"Göttingen Learned Advertiser\") which had been shortened by the Göttingen philosopher Johann Georg Heinrich Feder. Kant felt himself to have been misunderstood, and complained bitterly about the review in the Appendix to his Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics that Will Henceforth Come Forward as a Science. When the original, longer review was published by Garve in the \"Allgemeine Deutsche Bibliothek\" (\"General German Library\"), it still attracted Kant's censure. Kant consequently wrote his own \"Anti-Garve\". This program in time expanded into Kant's \"Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals\". The intellectual engagement between Kant and Garve extended up to Garve's death of cancer in 1798.\n\n\n\n"}

He traveled as a Unitarian minister, preaching in Providence, Andover, Richmond, Bangor, Portland, Boston, Washington, and St. Louis. Later, he pursued various occupations: a magazine editor, caricaturist, children's fantasy writer (the \"Huggermugger\" books), poet (\"The Bird and the Bell with Other Poems\" in 1875), translator, and landscape painter. He lived much of his life in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nThough not one of its founding members, Cranch became associated with the Transcendental Club; he read Ralph Waldo Emerson's \"Nature\" by December 1836 and beginning in June 1837 served as a substitute editor of the \"Western Messenger\" in the absence of James Freeman Clarke. For that journal, Cranch reviewed Emerson's Phi Beta Kappa address at Harvard in August 1837 known as \"The American Scholar\". He referred to the speech as \"so full of beauties, full of original thought and illustration\" and its author as \"the man of genius, the bold deep thinker, and the concise original writer\".\nCranch's connection with the Transcendentalists ultimately diminished his demand as a minister.\n\nHis poetry was published in \"The Harbinger\" and \"The Dial\" among other publications. He sent \"Enosis\", which Hazen Carpenter noted as perhaps Cranch's most well-known poem, to Emerson for \"The Dial\" on March 2, 1840.\nAs an artist, Cranch painted landscapes similar to the work of Thomas Cole, the Hudson River school, and the Barbizon school in France. In one foray into historical painting, Cranch depicted the burning of P. T. Barnum's American Museum in New York City. Later in life, Cranch painted scenes from Venice and Italy. Cranch's caricatures of Emerson were later bound as \"Illustrations of the New Philosophy: Guide\".

Parasites have traditionally been seen as targets of eradication efforts, and they have often been overlooked in conservation efforts. In the case of parasites living in the wild – and thus harmless to humans and domesticated animals – this view is changing.\n\nA note published in 1990 pointed out that the captive breeding and reintroduction program to save the black-footed ferret would cause the loss of its specific parasites and demanded \"equal rights for parasites!\". A paper in 1992 warned that not only the loss of certain host species from the wild, but host population bottlenecks or the fragmentation of host populations would predictably lead to the extinction of host-specific parasites. The paper also noted that parasites exert selective pressures upon their host populations that increase host genetic diversity. At first, this view met with open scepticism. However, it became clear that the co-extinction of hosts and their specific parasites is likely to increase the current estimates of extinction rates significantly. A decade later, a study focusing on highly host-specific groups such as fig wasps, parasites, butterflies, and myrmecophil butterflies estimated the number of parasites put at risk by the endangered status of the host at about 6300. Other authors argued that host-specific parasite faunae have an unexpected advantage for conservation scientists. Their genealogies and population genetic patterns may help to illuminate their hosts' evolutionary and demographic history. Recently, scientists suggested that rich parasite faunae are inevitably needed for healthy ecosystem functioning and also that parasites and mutualists are the most endangered species on Earth. Even vets have started to argue about the conservational values of parasite species.\n\nA recent study on parasites of coral reef fish suggested that extinction of a coral reef fish species would eventually result in the coextinction of at least ten species of parasites. Although this number might seem high, the study included only large parasites such as parasitic worms and crustaceans, but not microparasites such as Myxosporea and Microsporidia.\n\nThe list below follows that of Mey (2005)\n\n\nAdditionally, \"Columbicola extinctus\" is a parasite of the extinct passenger pigeon (\"Ectopistes migratorius\"). However, recent taxonomic studies show that it is conspecific with the lice living on band-tailed pigeon (\"Columba fasciata\"), thus it is not extinct.\n\nNaturally, medical and veterinary sciences have attempted to exterminate parasites and pathogens living in humans and in domesticated animals. In the case of a few highly host-specific pathogens, this means the extinction of the entire pathogen species. Throughout human history, however, only one species, the smallpox virus, has been wholly eradicated. The last reported cases of smallpox occurred 1978. However, secure samples are known to still exist in the United States and Russia, purportedly for defensive purposes such as developing new vaccines, antiviral drugs, as well as for diagnostic tests. It is not known, but is speculated that these countries may have shared their samples with some of their allies during the Cold War.\n\nA second, potential candidate for deliberate extermination is \"Dracunculus medinensis\", the guinea worm. Once widespread across some 20 nations of Africa and Asia, the parasite today survives only in four of the countries of Sub-Saharan Africa, with only a few hundred known cases of infection in 2011. Prevalent civil wars in the region, such as the War in Darfur, by preventing safe access to medical aid, have resulted in the survival of this species up to the present.\n\n"}

The term \"mountain\" in this context means \"temple\" or \"monastery\", and was adopted because many monasteries were built on isolated mountains. The system originated in India and was later adopted also in Japan during the late Kamakura period (1185–1333). \n\nIn Japan, the ten existing \"Five Mountain\" temples (five in Kyoto and five in Kamakura, Kanagawa) were both protected and controlled by the shogunate. In time, they became a sort of governmental bureaucracy that helped the Ashikaga shogunate stabilize the country during the turbulent Nanboku-chō period. Below the ten \"Gozan\" temples there were ten so-called temples, followed by another network called . The terms \"Gozan\" and Five Mountain System are used both for the ten temples at the top and for the Five Mountain System network in general, including the \"Jissetsu\" and the \"Shozan\".\n\nThere used to be in Kamakura a parallel \"Five Mountain System\" of nunneries called , of which the famous Tōkei-ji is the only survivor.\n\nAt the time of the Song dynasty, Chan (Japanese \"Zen\") was the dominant form of monasticism and had considerable imperial support.

Around the 12th century, this tendency to monastic wealth and imperial patronage became even more pronounced with the creation by direct imperial order in South China of the Five Mountain and Ten Monasteries System during the late Southern Song (1127–1279). It was a system of state-sponsored temples and monasteries built to pray to the gods for the dynasty and the state, which was threatened by enemies from Northern China. The system had at its top five famous temples and ten lesser ones immediately below. Officials chose both the five temples of the top tier, and the chief priest that ruled over them. \n\nThe system was devised specifically to bureaucratize and control the power of the Chan temples, a power which had been growing with the years and worried the central government. The consequent submission of the Chan network to imperial power and its goals is evident in later codes, particularly in the \"Baizhang qinggui\" compiled in 1336. Because the conquering Mongols financially supported Chan, the code emphasizes prayers for the emperor and the monastic ancestors The emperor is even described as a nirmanakaya, or incarnate Buddha. The complex monastic bureaucracy described by the code clearly reflects the imperial administration with its eastern and western ranks. The code has been in continuous use ever since, and not only within Chan Buddhism.\n\nIntroduced to Japan by the Hōjō regency, after an initial hostility from older and established Buddhist sects, it prospered thanks to the support of the country's military rulers in Kamakura first and Kyoto later. In the final version of the system, Kamakura's Five Mountains were, from the first-ranked to the last, Kenchō-ji, Engaku-ji, Jufuku-ji, Jōchi-ji and Jōmyō-ji. Kyoto's Five Mountains, created later by the Ashikaga shogunate after the collapse of the Kamakura regime, were Tenryū-ji, Shōkoku-ji, Kennin-ji, Tōfuku-ji and Manju-ji. Above them all was the huge Nanzen-ji temple. Below the top tier there was a nationwide capillary network of smaller temples that allowed its influence to be felt everywhere.\n\nThe system was adopted to promote Zen in Japan however, in Japan as it had already happened in China, it was controlled and used by the country's ruling class for its own administrative and political ends. The \"Gozan\" system allowed the temples at the top to function as \"de facto\" ministries, using their nationwide network of temples for the distribution of government laws and norms, and for the monitoring of local conditions for their military superiors. The Hōjō first, and the Ashikaga later were therefore able to disguise their power under a religious mask, while monks and priests worked for the government as translators, diplomats and advisers. To the Rinzai sect, the collaboration with the shogunate brought wealth, influence and political clout.\n\nThe system had come to Japan at a time when Kamakura's five great Zen temples were already known as the Five Mountains, and it unified in one organization all the great temples of the dominant Zen schools of the time. It thus institutionalized a large and very important part of the Rinzai school, bringing to it the protection, but also the control of the state. The whole network of temples was supervised by a state bureaucracy created specifically for the task.\n\nThe system in its final form had three tiers, with at the top Kyoto's Five Mountains (the , known in English also as Kyoto's \"Five Zen Temples\") and Kamakura's Five Mountains (the , in a subordinate position). Below them were the so-called Ten Temples, or \"Jissetsu\", with at the bottom other temples collectively known as \"Shozan\".\n\nThe \"Gozan\" temples were dominated mainly by the Rinzai Zen schools. The branch of the Sōtō Zen school however belonged to the \"Gozan\" system too. \n\nUnder their masters' patronage, the Five Mountain temples gradually became centers of learning and developed a characteristic literature called the Japanese Literature of the Five Mountains. During the Japanese Middle Ages, its scholars exerted a far-reaching influence on the internal political affairs of the country. The system put great value in a strong orientation towards Chinese Zen, Chinese philosophy and Chinese literature. The organization's scholars had a close relationship with the Ming imperial dynasty, had a pervasive influence in many cultural fields and played an important role in importing Neo-Confucianism (particularly as far as the \"shushigaku\" (朱子学) is concerned) from China to Japan.\n\nAt the end of the Kamakura period (1333) the four temples of Kennin-ji, Kenchō-ji, Engaku-ji and Jufuku-ji, were already known as the \"Gozan\", but not much is otherwise known about the system, its structure and the hierarchical order. \n\nThe first official recognition of the system came from Emperor Go-Daigo during the brief Kenmu Restoration (1333–1336). Go-Daigo added the \"Kyoto Gozan\" to the existing temples in Kamakura with Daitoku-ji and Nanzen-ji together at the top as number 1, followed by Kennin-ji and Tōfuku-ji. At this point in time, in spite of their name, the \"Gozan\" were not five but four in both cities. At the beginning of Muromachi period, they became five in Kyoto later, when Ashikaga Takauji built Tenryū-ji in memory of Go-Daigo.\n\nThe first explicit formulation of a clear \"Gozan\" ranking system dates to the year 1341. \n\nThe system was modified again many times according to the preferences of the government and of the Imperial Household.\n\nFrom their base cities of Kamakura and Kyoto, the twin Five Mountains Systems had great influence over the entire country. Following the advice of Musō Soseki, shōgun Ashikaga Takauji and his brother Ashikaga Tadayoshi decided to strengthen the system through the building in every province of an and a .\n\nThese were dedicated to the memory of the dead of the Genkō War of 1331-3, war in which Emperor Go-Daigo broke the power of the Hōjō clan. Emperor Kōgon promulgated in 1345 an edict for the deployment of the new system, and from 1362 to 1367 the temples and the pagodas were built in 66 provinces.\n\nThe \"Ankoku-ji\" network was tightly controlled by Ashikaga shugo (Governors) and was associated with the \"Gozan\" system. The \"Rishō-tō\" were direct property of the \"Gozan\", with the exception of those associated with the Ashikaga, which were connected to powerful temples of non-Rinzai schools, mainly of the Shingon, Tendai and Risshū sects.\n\nBoth brothers died early (Tadayoshi in 1352, according to the Taiheiki of poisoning, and Takauji in 1358 of cancer), so they couldn't couldn't oversee the system's creation until its end.\n\nThe system was completed under Ashikaga Yoshimitsu when he was 10 years old. During his father Ashikaga Yoshiakira's regency, who was until his death busy with the war with the Southern Court, the Ashikaga governors had become however strong and independent warlords. Even though as a consequence the provinces didn't accept any more the oversight of the \"Gozan\" and of the shogunate, the \"Gozan/Ankoku-ji\" system remained a valuable instrument to control the various Zen sects.\n\nAfter the completion of Shōkoku-ji by Yoshimitsu in 1386 a new ranking system was created with Nanzen-ji at the top and in a class of its own. Nanzen-ji had the title of \"First Temple of The Land\" and played a supervising role. \n\nThis structure then remained more or less unchanged for the rest of the system's history.\n\nThe \"Jissetsu\", second tier of the Five Mountain system, was created to be hierarchically under the \"Gozan\", but developed slowly towards an independent system. The temples of this rank were in general powerful institutions of great prestige and had to help the military government financially and in other ways. \n\nDuring the Kenmu restoration temples like Jōmyō-ji in Sagami Province and in Bungo Province were already part of the system, which is therefore assumed to have been born during the late Kamakura period. Nothing else is known however about the character and structure of the system at the time. In 1341 the system included Jōmyō-ji, , Tōshō-ji and Manju-ji in Sagami province, Manju-ji, , and in Yamashiro Province, in Kōzuke Province, in Chikuzen Province and Manju-ji in Bungo. \n\nAfter many changes, in 1386 the system was divided in half between the \"Kantō Jissetsu\", that is the temples under the \"Kamakura Gozan\", and the \"Kyoto Jissetsu\", that is the temples under the \"Kyoto Gozan\". \n\nThe Kyoto \"Jissetsu\" were then , , , , , , , , and .\nThe \"Kantō Jissetsu\" were , , , , , , and in Sagami, plus in Mutsu Province, in Musashi Province and in Kōzuke.\n\nLater, the term \"Jissetsu\" lost its original meaning and became just a rank. Consequently, at the end of the Middle Ages it included over 60 temples.\n\nThe third and lowest tier was that of the so-called \"Shozan\", sometimes also called as the corresponding tier of the Chinese state-sponsored temple system. These last terms are however normally used only in writing for elegance. The term in China meant \"first in rank\" in a certain province, but in Japan this meaning was lost. \n\nWe know that in 1321 Sagami province's and in 1230 Higo Province's were part of the system, which therefore must be older. More temples from all parts of the country were added later during the Kemmu restoration. Unlike the \"Gozan\" and the \"Jissetsu\", the \"Shozan\" were not ordered hierarchically and there were no limits to their number, which consequently grew until more than 230 temples belonged to the system. A Zen chief priest (a ) in his career would usually rise from the \"Shozan\" to the \"Jissetsu\" and finally to the \"Gozan\".\n\nApart from the \"Gozan\" temples, there were also many others in the provinces called , among them Sōtō's Eihei-ji founded by Dōgen, and Rinzai's Daitoku-ji, Myōshin-ji and Kōgen-ji, which were not under the direct control of the state. During Japan's Middle Ages, the \"Rinka\" monasteries were Zen's other main branch. Unlike the Five Mountain temples, they placed little emphasis on Chinese culture, were run by less well-educated monks who preferred \"zazen\" and \"kōan\" to poetry. Rinka Zen prospered among the lower layers of the warrior, merchant and peasant castes, who saw religion as a means to achieve simple worldly goals such as profits and exorcisms.\n\nThe very lack of political connection which had hampered them at the beginning of their history was however the reason why they prospered later. During the slow decline of Ashikaga authority, and particularly after the catastrophic Ōnin war, in the latter half of the Muromachi period, because the \"Rinka\" had a close relationship with local warlords, they became progressively more important and influential than the \"Gozan\", which followed their Ashikaga masters in their decline. A measure of the success of the \"Rinka\" is given by the fact that today's \"Sōtō\" and \"Rinzai\" sects emerged from \"Rinka\" Zen.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3947034", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3947034", "title": "General knowledge", "text": "General knowledge\n\nGeneral knowledge has been defined in differential psychology as \"culturally valued knowledge communicated by a range of non-specialist media\" and encompassing a wide subject range. This definition excludes highly specialized learning that can only be obtained with extensive training and information confined to a single medium. General knowledge is an important component of crystallized intelligence and is strongly associated with general intelligence, and with openness to experience.\n\nStudies have found that people who are highly knowledgeable in a particular domain tend to be knowledgeable in many. General knowledge is thought to be supported by long-term semantic memory ability.\nDifferential psychology researchers define general knowledge as \"culturally valued knowledge communicated by a range of non-specialist media.\" The scope of this definition includes all areas of knowledge available to laypersons without requiring extensive training. The definition excludes \"ephemera\", or information confined to a single medium, such as television sitcoms. Researchers have identified 20 domains of knowledge that meet the above criteria:\n\n\nResearchers have acknowledged that other domains of general knowledge may exist. Factor analysis suggested that the 20 domains could be categorised into six factors: current affairs, fashion, family, physical health and recreation, arts, and science. All six of these factors were highly intercorrelated (i.e. people who scored high in a particular domain tended to score highly in most other domains) and were all related to a single higher-order general knowledge factor. The existence of a single general factor suggests that individual differences across a range of knowledge domains may have both common causes and specific influences; interest in a particular area and educational course content appear to be important contributors.\n\nHigh scorers on tests of general knowledge tend to also score highly on intelligence tests. IQ has been found to robustly predict general knowledge scores even after accounting for differences in age, sex, and five factor model personality traits. In the Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory of intelligence, general knowledge is considered a component of crystallized intelligence. Standardized IQ tests may therefore include measures of general knowledge, such as in the information subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale.\n\nGeneral knowledge is also moderately associated with verbal ability, though only weakly or not at all with numerical and spatial ability. As with crystallized intelligence, general knowledge has been found to increase with age.\n\nResearch has found positive relationships between different domains of knowledge, suggesting that individuals who are highly knowledgeable in a particular domain usually have a good long-term memory for factual information in general. Due to the positive intercorrelations between knowledge domains, individual differences in general knowledge may reflect differences in ability to retrieve information from long-term semantic memory. A general factor of long-term semantic memory could be explained by the existence of an underlying neurophysiological process responsible for retaining information in long-term memory. Individual differences in the efficiency of such processes might explain why all domains of semantic memory appear to be intercorrelated.\n\nPeople high in general knowledge tend to be highly open to new experiences and in typical intellectual engagement. The relationship between openness to experience and general knowledge remains robust even when IQ is taken into account. People high in openness may be more motivated to engage in intellectual pursuits that increase their knowledge. Relationships between general knowledge and other five factor model traits tend to be weak and inconsistent. Though one study found that extraversion and neuroticism were negatively correlated with general knowledge, others found that they were unrelated. Inconsistent results have also been found for conscientiousness.\n\nResearch has found that on average males tend to score higher than females on tests of overall general knowledge and in most domains of knowledge tested. Males also score higher than females on the information subtest of the WAIS and the WISC, with small to medium effect sizes. In a comparison between male and female university students in 19 domains of academic knowledge, males had greater knowledge in 14 domains, especially in physical science and technology, but also in humanities and civics. A general knowledge composite across all 19 tests showed a male advantage of medium effect size. A study of university students in Northern Ireland found that males scored higher in general knowledge than females, as well as in 12 of 19 specific knowledge domains. Females scored moderately higher than males in medicine and cookery. The authors of this study suggested that this male advantage most likely reflects differences in interests rather than differences in verbal or memory ability. Similar results were found in a study of German high school students.\nMale advantages in general knowledge are not attributable to differences between males and females in reasoning ability (i.e. fluid intelligence), socio-economic status, or exposure to school course content. Although males appear to have greater general knowledge, there is some evidence that females tend to have an advantage in \"autobiographical\" knowledge, or memory of personal experiences. While general knowledge is supported by semantic memory, autobiographical knowledge is supported by episodic memory, which is not tested in intelligence tests and tends to be difficult to measure because of the uniquely personal nature of such memories.\n\nA number of studies have assessed whether performance on a general knowledge test can predict achievement in particular areas, namely in academics, proofreading, and creativity.\n\nGeneral knowledge has been found to predict exam results in a study of British schoolchildren. The study examined cognitive ability and personality predictors of exam performance and found that general knowledge was positively correlated with GCSE English, mathematics, and overall exam results. General knowledge test scores predicted exam results, even after controlling for IQ, five factor model personality traits, and learning styles.\n\nGeneral knowledge has been found to robustly predict proofreading skills in university students. A study found that proofreading had a larger correlation with general knowledge than with general intelligence, verbal reasoning, or openness to experience. In a multiple regression analysis using general knowledge, general intelligence, verbal reasoning, five factor personality traits, and learning styles as predictors, only general knowledge was a significant predictor.\n\nGeneral knowledge has been found to have weak associations with measures of creativity. In a study examining contributions of personality and intelligence to creativity, general knowledge was positively correlated with tests of divergent thinking, but was unrelated to a biographical measure of creative achievement, self-rated creativity, or a composite measure of creativity. The relationship between general knowledge and divergent thinking became non-significant when controlling for fluid intelligence.\n\nMany game shows use general knowledge questions. Game shows such as \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\" and \"Fifteen to One\" centre their questions on general knowledge, while others shows focus questions more on specific subjects. Some shows ask questions both on specific subjects and on general knowledge, including \"Eggheads\" and \"\"Mastermind\"\". In \"Mastermind\", contestants choose their own \"specialist subject\" before answering general knowledge questions, whereas in \"Eggheads\" the subjects are chosen at random.\n"}

What allows a person to go beyond the \"animal\" nature is the most common religion that imposes specific normative system and is a way to regulate behaviour.\n\nLeft unchecked the individualism leads to a lifetime of seeking to slake selfish desires which leads to unhappiness and despair. On the other hand collective conscience serves as a check on the will. This is created by socialisation. Highly anomic societies are characterized by weak primary group ties—family, church, community, and other such groups.\n\n\nFar from being simple, our inner life has something like a double centre of gravity. On the one hand is our individuality ... On the other is everything in us that expresses something other than ourselves. Not only are these two groups of states of consciousness different in their origins and their properties, but there is a true antagonism between them.\n\nBut the young educated adults of the 90s got to watch all this brave new individualism and self-expression and sexual freedom deteriorate into the joyless and anomic self-indulgence of the Me Generation.

{"id": "15125", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15125", "title": "Irrealism (the arts)", "text": "Irrealism (the arts)\n\nIrrealism is a term that has been used by various writers in the fields of philosophy, literature, and art to denote specific modes of unreality and/or the problems in concretely defining reality. While in philosophy the term specifically refers to a position put forward by the American philosopher Nelson Goodman, in literature and art it refers to a variety of writers and movements. If the term has nonetheless retained a certain consistency in its use across these fields and would-be movements, it perhaps reflects the word’s position in general English usage: though the standard dictionary definition of \"irreal\" gives it the same meaning as \"unreal\", \"irreal\" is very rarely used in comparison with \"unreal\". Thus, it has generally been used to describe something which, while unreal, is so in a very specific or unusual fashion, usually one emphasizing not just the \"not real,\" but some form of estrangement from our generally accepted sense of reality.\n\nIn literature, the term irrealism was first used extensively in the United States in the 1970s to describe the post-realist \"new fiction\" of writers such as Donald Barthelme or John Barth. More generally, it described the notion that all forms of writing could only \"offer particular versions of reality rather than actual descriptions of it,\" and that a story need not offer a clear resolution at its end. John Gardner, in \"The Art of Fiction\", cites in this context the work of Barthelme and its \"seemingly limitless ability to manipulate [literary] techniques as modes of apprehension [which] apprehend nothing.\" Though Barth, in a 1974 interview, stated, \"irrealism—not antirealism or unrealism, but irrealism—is all that I would confidently predict is likely to characterize the prose fiction of the 1970s,\" this did not prove to be the case. Instead writing in the United States quickly returned to its realist orthodoxy and the term irrealism fell into disuse.\n\nIn recent years, however, the term has been revived in an attempt to describe and categorize, in literary and philosophical terms, how it is that the work of an irrealist writer differs from the work of writers in other, non-realistic genres (e.g., the fantasy of J.R.R. Tolkien, the magical realism of Gabriel García Márquez) and what the significance of this difference is. This can be seen in Dean Swinford's essay \"Defining irrealism: scientific development and allegorical possibility\". Approaching the issue from a structuralist and narratological point of view, he has defined irrealism as a \"peculiar mode of postmodern allegory\" that has resulted from modernity’s fragmentation and dismantling of the well-ordered and coherent medieval system of symbol and allegory. Thus a lion, when presented in a given context in medieval literature, could only be interpreted in a single, approved way. Contemporary literary theory, however, denies the attribution of such fixed meanings. According to Swinford, this change can be attributed in part to the fact that \"science and technical culture have changed perceptions of the natural world, have significantly changed the natural world itself, thereby altering the vocabulary of symbols applicable to epistemological and allegorical attempts to understand it.\" Thus irreal works such as Italo Calvino's \"Cosmicomics\" and Jorge Luis Borges' \"Ficciones\" can be seen as an attempt to find a new allegorical language to explain our changed perceptions of the world that have been brought about by our scientific and technical culture, especially concepts such as quantum physics or the theory of relativity. \"The Irrealist work, then, operates within a given system,\" writes Swinford, \"and attests to its plausibility, despite the fact that this system, and the world it represents, is often a mutation, an aberration.\"\n\nThe online journal \"The Cafe Irreal\" , on the other hand, has defined irrealism as being a type of existentialist literature in which the means are continually and absurdly rebelling against the ends that we have determined for them. An example of this would be Franz Kafka's story \"The Metamorphosis\", in which the salesman Gregor Samsa's plans for supporting his family and rising up in rank by hard work and determination are suddenly thrown topsy-turvy by his sudden and inexplicable transformation into a man-sized insect. Such fiction is said to emphasize the fact that human consciousness, being finite in nature, can never make complete sense of, or successfully order, a universe that is infinite in its aspects and possibilities. Which is to say: as much as we might try to order our world with a certain set of norms and goals (which we consider our real world), the paradox of a finite consciousness in an infinite universe creates a zone of irreality (\"that which is beyond the real\") that offsets, opposes, or threatens the real world of the human subject. Irrealist writing often highlights this irreality, and our strange fascination with it, by combining the unease we feel because the real world doesn't conform to our desires with the narrative quality of the dream state (where reality is constantly and inexplicably being undermined); it is thus said to communicate directly, \"by feeling rather than articulation, the uncertainties inherent in human existence or, to put it another way... the irreconcilability between human aspiration and human reality.\" If the irreal story can be considered an allegory, then, it would be an allegory that is \"so many pointers to an unknown meaning,\" in which the meaning is felt more than it is articulated or systematically analyzed.\n\nVarious writers have addressed the question of Irrealism in Art. Many salient observations on Irrealism in Art are found in Nelson Goodman's \"Languages of Art\". Goodman himself produced some multimedia shows, one of which inspired by hockey and is entitled \"Hockey Seen: A Nightmare in Three Periods and Sudden Death\".\n\nGarret Rowlan, writing in \"The Cafe Irreal\", writes that the malaise present in the work of the Italian artist Giorgio de Chirico, \"which recalls Kafka, has to do with the sense of another world lurking, hovering like the long shadows that dominate de Chirico's paintings, which frequently depict a landscape at twilight's uncertain hour. Malaise and mystery are all by-products of the interaction of the real and the unreal, the rub and contact of two worlds caught on irrealism's shimmering surface.\" \n\nThe writer Dean Swinford, whose concept of irrealism was described at length in the section \"Irrealism in Literature\", wrote that the artist Remedios Varos, in her painting \"The Juggler\", \"creates a personal allegorical system which relies on the predetermined symbols of Christian and classical iconography. But these are quickly refigured into a personal system informed by the scientific and organized like a machine...in the Irreal work, allegory operates according to an altered, but constant and orderly iconographic system.\"\n\nArtist Tristan Tondino has made a number of claims about Irrealism. Most of his claims are found in his paintings, many of which are Lettrist Abstractions. \"There is no specific style to Irrealist Art. It is the result of awareness that every human act is the result of the limitations of the world of the actor.\" \n\nIn Australia, the art journal \"the art life\" has recently detected the presence of a \"New Irrealism\" among the painters of that country, which is described as being an \"approach to painting that is decidedly low key, deploying its effects without histrionic showmanship, while creating an eerie other world of ghostly images and abstract washes.\" What exactly constituted the \"old\" irrealism, they do not say.\n\nIrrealist Art Edition is a publishing company created in the 90s by contemporary plastic artist Frédéric Iriarte. Together with the Estonian poet, writer and art critic Ilmar Laaban, they developed their concept of Irrealism through several essays, exhibitions, projects, manifest and a book, \"Irréalisation\". Irrealist Art Edition \n\nSome hardcore bands in Italy have claimed to be irrealist.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "171133", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=171133", "title": "John Amos Comenius", "text": "John Amos Comenius\n\nJohn Amos Comenius (; ; Latinized: \"Ioannes Amos Comenius\"; 28 March 1592 – 15 November 1670) was a Czech philosopher, pedagogue and theologian from the Margraviate of Moravia and is considered the father of modern education. He served as the last bishop of Unity of the Brethren and became a religious refugee and one of the earliest champions of universal education, a concept eventually set forth in his book \"Didactica Magna\". As an educator and theologian, he led schools and advised governments across Protestant Europe through the middle of the seventeenth century. \n\nComenius was the innovator who first introduced pictorial textbooks, written in native language instead of Latin, applied effective teaching based on the natural gradual growth from simple to more comprehensive concepts, supported lifelong learning and development of logical thinking by moving from dull memorization, presented and supported the idea of equal opportunity for impoverished children, opened doors to education for women, and made instruction universal and practical. Besides his native Bohemian Crown, he lived and worked in other regions of the Holy Roman Empire, and other countries: Sweden, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Transylvania, England, the Netherlands and Hungary.\n\nJohn Amos Comenius originated from Margraviate of Moravia in the Bohemian Crown in Uherský Brod (as on his gravestone in Naarden) or Nivnice, or Komňa, all of which are located in Uherské Hradiště District of today's Czech Republic. John Comenius was the youngest child and only son of Martin Komenský (died 1602–4) and his wife Anna Chmelová. His grandfather, whose name was Jan Szeges, was of Hungarian origin. He started to use the surname Komenský after leaving Komňa to live in Uherský Brod. The name Komenský translates to \"the man from Komňa\". Martin and Anna Komenský belonged to the Moravian Brethren, a pre-Reformation Protestant denomination, and Comenius later became one of its leaders. His parents and two of his four sisters died in 1604 and young John went to live with his aunt in Strážnice.\nOwing to his impoverished circumstances he was unable to begin his formal education until later in life. He was 16 when he entered the Latin school in Přerov (he later returned to this school as a teacher 1614–1618). He continued his studies in the Herborn Academy (1611–1613) and the University of Heidelberg (1613–1614). In 1612 he read Fama Fraternitatis. Comenius was greatly influenced by the Irish Jesuit William Bathe as well as his teachers Johann Piscator, , and particularly Heinrich Alsted. The Herborn school held the principle that every theory has to be functional in practical use, therefore it has to be didactic (i.e. morally instructive). In the course of his study he also became acquainted with the educational reforms of Ratichius and with the report of these reforms issued by the universities of Jena and Giessen. Comenius' book Janua linguarum reserata (\"The Gate of Languages Unlocked\", 1631) brought him widespread prominence and fame. However, he and the Unity became special targets of the Counter Reformation movement and were forced into exile even as his fame grew across Europe.\n\nComenius became rector of a school in Přerov. In 1616 he was ordained into the ministry of the Moravian Brethren and four years later became pastor and rector at Fulnek, one of its most flourishing churches. Throughout his life this pastoral activity was his most immediate concern. In consequence of the religious wars, he lost all his property and his writings in 1621; six years later he led the Brethren into exile when the Habsburg Counter-Reformation persecuted the Protestants in Bohemia.\n\nComenius took refuge in Leszno in Poland, where he led the gymnasium and, furthermore, was given charge of the Bohemian and Moravian churches. In 1628 he corresponded with Johann Valentin Andreae. In 1638 Comenius responded to a request by the government of Sweden and traveled there to draw up a scheme for the management of the schools of that country, and in 1641, he responded to a request by the English parliament and joined a commission there charged with the reform of the system of public education. The English Civil War interfered with the latter project, and so in 1642 he returned to Sweden to work with Queen Christina (reigned 1632–1654) and the chancellor Axel Oxenstierna (in office 1612–1654) on the task of reorganizing the Swedish schools. The same year he moved to Elbląg (Elbing) in Poland and in 1648 went to England with the aid of Samuel Hartlib, who came originally from Elbląg. In 1650 Zsuzsanna Lorántffy, widow of George I Rákóczi prince of Transylvania invited him to Sárospatak. Comenius remained there until 1654 as a professor at the first Hungarian Protestant College; he wrote some of his most important works there.\nComenius returned to Leszno. During the Deluge in 1655, he declared his support for the Protestant Swedish side, for which Polish Catholic partisans burned his house, his manuscripts, and the school's printing press in 1656. From Leszno he took refuge in Amsterdam in the Netherlands, where he died in 1670. For unclear reasons he was buried in Naarden, where visitors can see his grave in the mausoleum devoted to him.\n\nAfter his religious duties, Comenius's second great interest was in furthering the Baconian attempt at the organization of all human knowledge. He became one of the leaders in the encyclopædic or pansophic movement of the seventeenth century, and, in fact, was inclined to sacrifice his more practical educational interests and opportunities for these more imposing but somewhat visionary projects. In 1639, Comenius published his \"Pansophiæ Prodromus\", and in the following year his English friend Hartlib published, without his consent, the plan of the pansophic work as outlined by Comenius. The manuscript of \"Pansophia\" was destroyed in the burning of his home in Leszno in 1657. The pansophic ideas find partial expression in the series of textbooks he produced from time to time. In these, he attempts to organize the entire field of human knowledge so as to bring it, in outline, within the grasp of every child.\n\nAccording to Cotton Mather, Comenius was asked by Winthrop to be the President of Harvard University, this being more plausibly John Winthrop the Younger than his father since the junior Winthrop was in England; but Comenius moved to Sweden instead. Comenius also attempted to design a language in which false statements were inexpressible.\n\nComenius produced a new edition of the 1618 Bohemian Brethren hymnal, \"Kancionál, to jest kniha žalmů a písní duchovních\" (Amsterdam, 1659), containing 606 texts and 406 tunes. In addition to revising the psalms and hymns, his revision greatly expanded the number of hymns and added a new introduction. This edition was reissued several times, into the nineteenth century. His texts in Czech were notable poetic compositions, but he used tunes from other sources. He also edited the German hymnal \"Kirchen-, Haus- und Hertzens-Musica\" (Amsterdam, 1661), which had been published under the title \"Kirchengesänge\" since 1566. In other writings, Comenius addresses both instrumental and vocal music in many places, although he dedicated no treatise to the topic. Sometimes he follows the medieval mathematical conception of music, but in other places he links music with grammar, rhetoric, and politics. Musical practice, both instrumental and vocal, played an important role in his system of education.\n\nThe most permanent influence exerted by Comenius was in practical educational work. Few men since his days have had a greater influence though, for the greater part of the eighteenth century and the early part of the nineteenth, there was little recognition of his relationship to the current advance in educational thought and practice. The practical educational influence of Comenius was threefold. He was first a teacher and an organizer of schools, not only among his own people, but later in Sweden, and to a slight extent in Holland. In his \"Didactica Magna\" (Great Didactic), he outlined a system of schools that is the exact counterpart of the existing American system of kindergarten, elementary school, secondary school, college, and university.\n\nIn the second place, the influence of Comenius was in formulating the general theory of education. In this respect, he is the forerunner of Rousseau, Pestalozzi, Fröbel, etc., and is the first to formulate that idea of \"education according to nature\" so influential during the latter part of the eighteenth and early part of the nineteenth century. The influence of Comenius on educational thought is comparable with that of his contemporaries, Bacon and Descartes, on science and philosophy. In fact, he was largely influenced by the thought of these two; and his importance is largely due to the fact that he first applied or attempted to apply in a systematic manner the principles of thought and of investigation, newly formulated by those philosophers, to the organization of education in all its aspects. The summary of this attempt is given in the \"Didactica Magna\", completed about 1631, though not published until several years later.\n\nThe third aspect of his educational influence was that on the subject matter and method of education, exerted through a series of textbooks of an entirely new nature. The first-published of these was the \"Janua Linguarum Reserata\" (The Gate of Tongues Unlocked), issued in 1631. This was followed later by a more elementary text, the \"Vestibulum\", and a more advanced one, the \"Atrium\", and other texts. In 1658 the \"Orbis Pictus\" was published, probably the most renowned and most widely circulated of school textbooks. It was also the first successful application of illustrations to the work of teaching, though not, as often stated, the first illustrated book for children.\nThese texts were all based on the same fundamental ideas: (1) learning foreign languages through the vernacular; (2) obtaining ideas through objects rather than words; (3) starting with objects most familiar to the child to introduce him to both the new language and the more remote world of objects; (4) giving the child a comprehensive knowledge of his environment, physical and social, as well as instruction in religious, moral, and classical subjects; (5) making this acquisition of a compendium of knowledge a pleasure rather than a task; and (6) making instruction universal. The importance of the Comenian influence in education has been recognized since the middle of the nineteenth century. The educational writings of Comenius comprise more than forty titles. In 1892 the three-hundredth anniversary of Comenius was very generally celebrated by educators, and at that time the Comenian Society for the study and publication of his works was formed.\n\nJohn Amos Comenius was a bishop of the Unity of the Brethren church that had its roots in the teaching of Czech reformer Jan Hus. One of his most famous theological work is the Labyrinth of the World and Paradise of the Heart. The book represents his thinking about the world being full of various useless things and complex labyrinths. The true peace of mind and soul can be found only in the one's heart where Christ the saver should dwell and rule. This teaching is also repeated in one of his last works Unum Necessarium (Only One is Needed) where he shows various labyrinths and problems in the world and provide simple solutions to various situation. In this book he also admits that his former believing in prophecies and revelations of those days was his personal labyrinth where he got lost manytimes. He was greatly influenced by Boehme. In his \"Synopsis physicae ad lumen divinum reformatae\", Comenius gives a physical theory of his own, said to be taken from the book of Genesis. He was also famous for his prophecies and the support he gave to visionaries. In his \"Lux in tenebris\" he published the visions of Christopher Kotterus, Mikuláš Drabík (lat. \"Nicolaus Drabicius\") and Christina Poniatowska. Attempting to interpret the book of Revelation, he promised the millennium in 1672, and guaranteed miraculous assistance to those who would undertake the destruction of the Pope and the house of Austria, even venturing to prophesy that Oliver Cromwell, Gustavus Adolphus, and George I Rákóczi, prince of Transylvania, would perform the task. He also wrote to Louis XIV of France, informing him that the empire of the world should be his reward if he would overthrow the enemies of God.\n\nOne of his daughters, Elisabeth, married Peter Figulus from Jablonné nad Orlicí. Their son, Daniel Ernst Jablonski (1660–1741), Comenius's grandson, later went to Berlin in 1693; there he became the highest official pastor at the court of King Frederick I of Prussia (reigned 1701–1713). There he became acquainted with Count Nicolaus Ludwig Zinzendorf (1700–1760). Zinzendorf was among the foremost successors to Comenius as a bishop (1737–1760) in the renewed Moravian Brethren's Church.\n\nThe Comenius Medal, a UNESCO award honouring outstanding achievements in the fields of education research and innovation, commemorates Comenius. Peter Drucker hailed Comenius as the inventor of textbooks and primers.\n\nDuring the 19th century Czech National Revival, Czechs idealised Comenius as a symbol of the Czech nation. This image persists to the present day. \n\nThe Czech Republic celebrates 28 March, the birthday of Comenius, as Teachers' Day. The University of Jan Amos Komensky was founded in Prague in 2001, offering bachelor's, master's and graduate degree programmes. Gate to Languages, a project of lifelong education, taking place in the Czech Republic from October 2005 to June 2007 and aimed at language education of teachers, was named after his book \"Janua linguarum reserata\" (Gate to Languages Unlocked). Comenius is pictured on the 200 Czech koruna banknote.\n\nAsteroid 1861 Komenský. discovered by Luboš Kohoutek, is named in his honor.\n\nIn Sárospatak, Hungary, a teacher's college is named after him, which belongs to the University of Miskolc. Comenius' name has been given to primary schools in several German cities, including Bonn, Grafing, and Deggendorf. In Skopje, Republic of Macedonia the Czechoslovak government built a school after a catastrophic 1963 earthquake and named it after Comenius (Jan Amos Komenski in Macedonian). In Poland, the Comenius Foundation is a non-governmental organisation dedicated to the provision of equal opportunities to children under 10 years of age. In 1919 Comenius University was founded by an act of parliament in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia, now in Slovakia. It was the first university with courses in the Slovak language. \n\nThe Italian film director Roberto Rossellini took Comenius, and especially his theory of \"direct vision\", as his model in the development of his didactic theories, which Rossellini hoped would usher the world into a utopian future.\n\nComenius is a European Union school partnership program. In the United Kingdom, the University of Sheffield's Western Bank Library holds the largest collection of Comenius manuscripts outside of the Czech Republic.\n\nIn 1892 Comenius Hall, the principal classroom and faculty office building on Moravian College's campus in Pennsylvania, was built. In 1892 educators in many places celebrated the three-hundredth anniversary of Comenius, and at that time the Comenian Society for the study and publication of his works was formed. The education department at Salem College in North Carolina has an annual \"Comenius Symposium\" dedicated in his honor; the subjects usually deal with modern issues in education. The Comenius Foundation in the US, a non-profit 501(c)(3) charity, uses film and documentary production to further faith, learning, and love.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In the 1st century AD, Juvenal (55-130) stated “All wish to know but none wish to pay the price\". In 1775, Samuel Johnson wrote: “All knowledge is of itself of some value.”\n\nIn the 19th century, Coleridge (1825) stated that : “The worth and value of knowledge is in proportion to the worth and value of its object.” Auerbach (1865) asked: “What is all our knowledge worth?\" although he proposed no answer. Largely the same ideas are already expressed in the term \"intellectual capital\" or the more ancient \"knowledge is power\" - given that power is a value in its own right.\n\nOnly towards of the end of the 20th century, however, was the value of knowledge in a business context generally recognized. The idea has since become something of a management fad, although many authors indicate that the underlying principles will become standard business practice. It is now understood that knowledge about how to produce products and provide services as well as their embedded knowledge is often more valuable than the products and services themselves or the materials they contain. Although measuring the value of knowledge remains elusive, describing its flow through value chains is a step in the right direction.\n\nFirestone was the first to relate knowledge to business when he noted that “Thought, not money is the real business capital.” Alvin Toffler (1990) proposed that knowledge is a wealth and force multiplier, in that it augments what is available or reduces the amount needed to achieve a given purpose.\n\nIn comparing knowledge and product value, Amidon (1997) observes that knowledge about how to produce products may be more valuable than the products themselves. Leonard similarly points out that products are physical manifestations of knowledge and that their worth depends largely on the value of the embedded knowledge.\n\nDavis (1999) further notes that the computer chips in a high-end automobile are worth more than the steel, plastics, glass, or rubber. However, Davis and Botin (1994) indicate that awareness of the value of knowledge exceeds the ability of many businesses to extract it from the goods and services in which it is embedded.\n\nMeasuring the value of knowledge has not progressed much beyond an awareness that traditional accounting practices are misleading and can lead to wrong business decisions (Martin, 1996). Amidon (1997) points out that the shift from tangible to intangible assets will revolutionize the way that enterprises are measured and that there is an entirely new way to value economic wealth.\n\nSimard et al. (2007) developed a content value chain describing the flow of content through a sequence of stages in which its form is changed and its value or utility to users are notably increased at each stage: objects, data, information, knowledge, and wisdom. They also developed a knowledge services value chain, which describes the flow of knowledge services through a sequence of stages, in which value is embedded, advanced, or extracted.\n\nThe stages are: generate, transform, manage, use internally, transfer, add value, use professionally, use personally, and evaluate.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1019093", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1019093", "title": "Luciferianism", "text": "Luciferianism\n\nLuciferianism is a belief system that venerates the essential characteristics that are affixed to Lucifer. The tradition, influenced by Gnosticism, usually reveres Lucifer not as the devil, but as a liberator, a guardian or guiding spirit, or even the true god as opposed to Jehovah.\n\nLucifer is the King James Version rendering of the Hebrew word in Isaiah . This word, transliterated \"hêlêl\" or \"heylel\", occurs once in the Hebrew Bible and according to the KJV-based Strong's Concordance means \"shining one, light-bearer\". The Septuagint renders הֵילֵל in Greek as ἑωσφόρος (\"heōsphoros\"), a name, literally \"bringer of dawn\", for the morning star. The word \"Lucifer\" is taken from the Latin Vulgate, which translates הֵילֵל as \"lucifer\", meaning \"the morning star, the planet Venus\", or, as an adjective, \"light-bringing\".\n\nLater Christian tradition came to use the Latin word for \"morning star\", \"lucifer\", as a proper name (\"Lucifer\") for the Devil; as he was before his fall. As a result, \"'Lucifer' has become a by-word for Satan or the Devil in the church and in popular literature\", as in Dante Alighieri's \"Inferno\", Joost van den Vondel's \"Lucifer\" and John Milton's \"Paradise Lost\". However, the Latin word never came to be used almost exclusively, as in English, in this way, and was applied to others also, including Jesus. The image of a morning star fallen from the sky is generally believed among scholars to have a parallel in Canaanite mythology.\n\nHowever, according to both Christian and Jewish exegesis, in Chapter 14 of the Book of Isaiah, the King of Babylon (Nebuchadnezzar II), conqueror of Jerusalem, is condemned in a prophetic vision by the prophet Isaiah and is called the \"Morning Star\" (planet Venus). In this chapter the Hebrew text says . \"Helel ben Shahar\" may refer to the Morning Star, but the text in Isaiah 14 gives no indication that Helel was a star or planet.\n\nSometimes mistakenly associated with Satanism due to the Christian interpretation of the fallen angel, Luciferianism is a wholly different belief system and does not revere the devil figure or most characteristics typically affixed to Satan. Rather, Lucifer in this context is seen as one of many morning stars, a symbol of enlightenment, independence, and human progression, and is often used interchangeably with similar figures from a range of ancient beliefs, such as the Greek titan Prometheus or the Jewish Talmudic figure Lilith.\n\nLuciferians generally support the protection of the natural world. Both the arts and sciences are crucial to human development and thus both are cherished. Luciferians think that humans should be focused on this life and how to make the most of it every single day. The ability to recognize both good and evil, to accept that all actions have both positive and negative consequences, and to actively influence one's environment is a key factor.\n\nThe Luciferian philosophy in recent years has been defined in a collective foundation, known as the \"11 Luciferian Points of Power\", authored by Michael W. Ford. The basis of Luciferian philosophy cultivates and encourages individuality, self-determined choices based on strategic application and continually seeking to enhance the Will via overcoming challenges. Luciferianism is philosophically practiced with the continual cycle and process known as Liberation, Illumination and Apotheosis.\n\nFor Luciferians, enlightenment is the ultimate goal. The basic Luciferian principles highlight truth and freedom of will, worshipping the inner self and one's ultimate potential. Traditional dogma is shunned as a basis for morality on the grounds that humans should not need deities or fear of eternal punishment to distinguish right from wrong and to do good. All ideas should be tested before being accepted, and even then one should remain skeptical because knowledge and understanding are fluid. Regardless of whether Lucifer is conceived of as a deity or as a mere archetype, he is a representation of ultimate knowledge and exploration, as well as humanity's savior and a champion for continuing personal growth.\n\nSome Luciferians believe in Lucifer as an actual deity, not to be worshipped as the Judeo-Christian God but to be revered and followed as a teacher and friend, as a rescuer or guiding spirit, or even the one true god as opposed to the traditional creator deity in Judaism. Theistic Luciferians are followers of the Left-Hand Path and may adhere to different dogmata put forth by organizations such as the Neo-Luciferian Church or other congregations which are heavily focused on ceremonial magic, the occult, and literal interpretations of spiritual stories and figures.\n\n\"Lucifer the Lightbearer\" was an individualist anarchist journal published in the United States by Moses Harman in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It has been reported that \"[t]he title was selected, stated Harman, because it expressed the paper's mission. Lucifer, the name given to the morning star by the people of the ancient world, served as the symbol of the publication and represented the ushering in of a new day. He declared that freethinkers had sought to redeem and glorify the name Lucifer while theologians cursed him as the prince of the fallen angels. Harman suggested that Lucifer would take on the role of an educator. 'The god of the Bible doomed mankind to perpetual ignorance,' wrote Harman, 'and [people] would never have known Good from Evil if Lucifer had not told them how to become as wise as the gods themselves.\n\n\"Lucifer\" was a publication edited by the influential occultist Helena Blavatsky. The journal was first published by Blavatsky. From 1889 until Blavatsky's death in May 1891, Annie Besant was a co-editor. Rudolf Steiner's writings, which formed the basis for anthroposophy, characterised Lucifer as a spiritual opposite to Ahriman, with Christ between the two forces, mediating a balanced path for humanity. Lucifer represents an intellectual, imaginative, delusional, otherworldly force which might be associated with visions, subjectivity, psychosis and fantasy. He associated Lucifer with the religious and philosophical cultures of Egypt, Rome, and Greece. Steiner believed that Lucifer, as a supersensible Being, had incarnated in China about 3000 years before the birth of Christ.\n\nLéo Taxil (1854–1907) claimed that Freemasonry is associated with worshipping Lucifer. In what is known as the Taxil hoax, he alleged that leading Freemason Albert Pike had addressed \"[t]he 23 Supreme Confederated Councils of the world\" (an invention of Taxil), instructing them that Lucifer was God, and was in opposition to the evil god Adonai. Supporters of Freemasonry contend that, when Albert Pike and other Masonic scholars spoke about the \"Luciferian path\" or the \"energies of Lucifer\", they were referring to the Morning Star, the light bearer, the search for light; the very antithesis of dark, Satanic evil. Taxil promoted a book by Diana Vaughan (actually written by himself, as he later confessed publicly) that purported to reveal a highly secret ruling body called the Palladium, which controlled the organization and had a Satanic agenda. As described by \"Freemasonry Disclosed\" in 1897:\nTaxil's work and Pike's address continue to be quoted by anti-Masonic groups.\n\nIn \"Devil-Worship in France\", Arthur Edward Waite compared Taxil's work to what today we would call a tabloid story, replete with logical and factual inconsistencies.\n\nMadeline Montalban was an English astrologer and witch. She co-founded the esoteric organisation known as the Order of the Morning Star (OMS), through which she propagated her own form of Luciferianism. In 1952, she met Nicholas Heron, with whom she entered into a relationship. An engraver, photographer, and former journalist for the \"Brighton Argus\", he shared her interest in the occult and together they developed a magical system based upon Luciferianism, the veneration of the deity Lucifer, or Lumiel, whom they considered to be a benevolent angelic deity. In 1956, they founded the Order of the Morning Star, or \"Ordo Stella Matutina\" (OSM), propagating it through a correspondence course. The couple sent out lessons to those who paid the necessary fees over a series of weeks, eventually leading to the twelfth lesson, which contained \"The Book of Lumiel\", a short work written by Montalban that documented her understanding of Lumiel, or Lucifer, and his involvement with humankind. The couple initially lived together in Torrington Place, London, from where they ran the course; but in 1961 moved to the coastal town of Southsea in Hampshire, where there was greater room for Heron's engraving equipment.\n\nIn \"Rules for Radicals\" (his final work, published in 1971 one year before his death), the prominent American community organizer and writer Saul Alinsky wrote at the end of his personal acknowledgements:\n\nIn Anton LaVey's \"The Satanic Bible\", Lucifer is one of the four crown princes of hell, particularly that of the East, the \"lord of the air\", and is described as the bringer of light, the morning star, intellectualism, and enlightenment. The title \"lord of the air\" is based upon Ephesians 2:2, which uses the phrase \"prince of the power of the air'\" to refer to the Ancient Greek god Zeus, but that phrase later became conflated with Satan.\n\nAuthor Michael W. Ford has written on Lucifer as a \"mask\" of the adversary, a motivator and illuminating force of the mind and subconscious.\n\nIn 2014, Luciferians founded a worldwide organization for Luciferians from Houston, Texas, known as the Greater Church of Lucifer (GCoL) under the leadership of church founder Jacob Mckelvy, co-presidents Michael W. Ford and Jeremy Crow, founder of the Luciferian Research Society. In January 2015, the founders of GCoL filed paperwork in the Austin County Courthouse in order to do business under the GCoL name. The GCoL focuses more on teachings based on the practical world. Family and personal progression are among its key tenets.\n\nIn 2015, the GCoL opened a parish in Old Town Spring, Texas, with several dozen members. Over a hundred local residents, mainly Catholic, protested the opening of the church.\n\nThe Neo-Luciferian Church (NLC) is a Gnostic and Luciferian organisation with roots in Western esotericism, Voodoo, Luciferianism, Thelema, and magic.\n\nStephen Flowers, in his book on the German magical order Fraternitas Saturni, (FS) says that \"the FS is (or was) the most unabashedly Luciferian organization in the modern Western occult revival\". It is also reported that the Fraternitas Saturni holds the view that:\nAlso the A Logos was necessary in order for the light to dawn; and this Logos was Lucifer, the Light-Bringer. Lucifer is the demiurge, who created our visible world by breaking the static cosmic order. The result was War in Heaven, by which death entered the world. Lucifer is regarded as the \"higher octave\" of Saturn (Satan representing its \"lower octave\"), the outermost planet and polar opposite of the Sun in ancient cosmology. Because of this ongoing opposition Lucifer is still fighting the Solar Logos. The principal battlefield is our earth, which contains a negative-astral and a positive-mental sphere apart from its physical form. Saturn is seen as the great judge with scales and sword, entrusted with weight, measure and number. He is the Guardian of the Threshold, or the gateway to transcendence. Because he betrayed divine mysteries to mankind, he has been punished. His heavy, dark, leaden qualities must be transformed into gold by the magician, in an alchemical process involving the \"repolarisation of lights\".\n\n\nSources:\n"}
{"id": "2032208", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2032208", "title": "Maafa", "text": "Maafa\n\nMaafa (or African Holocaust, Holocaust of Enslavement, or Black Holocaust) are political neologisms (popularized from 1998 onwards) used to describe the history and ongoing effects of atrocities inflicted on African people, particularly when committed by non-Africans (Europeans and Arabs to be exact) specifically in the context of the history of slavery, including the Arab Slave Trade and Atlantic Slave Trade, and argued as \"continued to the present day\" through imperialism, colonialism, and other forms of oppression. For example, Maulana Karenga (2001) puts slavery in the broader context of the \"Maafa\", suggesting that its effects exceed mere physical persecution and legal disenfranchisement: the \"destruction of human possibility involved redefining African humanity to the world, poisoning past, present and future relations with others who only know us through this stereotyping and thus damaging the truly human relations among peoples.\"\n\nUsage of the Swahili term \"Maafa\" (\"Great Disaster\") in English was introduced by Marimba Ani's 1998 book \"Let the Circle Be Unbroken: The Implications of African Spirituality in the Diaspora\". It is derived from a Swahili term for \"disaster, terrible occurrence or great tragedy\". The term was popularized in the 1990s.\n\nThe term \"African Holocaust\" is preferred by some academics, such as Maulana Karenga, because it implies intention. One problem noted by Karenga is that the word \"Maafa\" can also translate to \"accident\", and in the view of some scholars the holocaust of enslavement was not accidental. Ali Mazrui notes that the word \"holocaust\" is a \"dual plagiarism\" since the term is derived from Ancient Greek and thus, despite being associated with the genocide of the Jews, no one can have a monopoly over the term. Mazrui states: \"This borrowing from borrowers without attribution is what I call 'the dual plagiarism.' But this plagiarism is defensible because the vocabulary of horrors like genocide and enslavement should not be subject to copyright-restrictions.\"\n\nSome Afrocentric scholars prefer the term \"Maafa\" to \"African Holocaust\", because they believe that indigenous African terminology more truly conveys the events. The term \"Maafa\" may serve \"much the same cultural psychological purpose for Africans as the idea of the \"Holocaust\" serves to name the culturally distinct Jewish experience of genocide under German Nazism.\" Other arguments in favor of \"Maafa\" rather than \"African Holocaust\" emphasize that the denial of the validity of the African people's humanity is an unparalleled centuries-long phenomenon: \"The Maafa is a continual, constant, complete, and total system of human negation and nullification.\"\n\nThe terms \"Transatlantic Slave Trade\", \"Atlantic Slave Trade\" and \"Slave Trade\" have also been said by some to be deeply problematic, because they serve as euphemisms for intense violence and mass murder. Referred to as a \"trade\", this prolonged period of persecution and suffering is rendered as a commercial dilemma, rather than as a moral atrocity. With trade as the primary focus, the broader tragedy becomes consigned to a secondary point, as mere \"collateral damage\" of a commercial venture. Others, however, feel that avoidance of the term \"trade\" is an apologetic act on behalf of capitalism, absolving capitalist structures of involvement in human catastrophe.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "48820171", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48820171", "title": "Naturalistic theories of mental representation", "text": "Naturalistic theories of mental representation\n\nTheories of mental representation are those that rest the cognitive abilities of the mind on the processing of content-laden vehicles, called representations. Naturalizing these theories involves an account of how a representation, initially posited as a theoretical construct, can be realized in a physical system. A central aspect of any account of representation is how they derive and designate semantic content. The possession of meaningful content is the most characteristic property of representations and arguably integral to their functionality. The project of the naturalistic philosopher is to provide an account of the representation relationship between a representation \"A\" and its object of intentional content \"a\", such that having content \"A\" is entailed by standing in a particular relation with \"a\".\n\nOne naturalistic account of the representation relationship is the teleofunctionalist semantics of Fred Dretske. In his book \"Explaining Behavior\", Dretske outlines a theory for how a component of a physical system can come to possess semantic content. This theory characterizes a relationship as representational when: one entity is a natural sign of another, and the natural sign is integrated into the function of a larger system as a consequence of being an indicator.\n\nNatural signs are those entities whose existence is dependent on preceding conditions. Therefore, the existence of a natural sign is an indication that its preceding conditions are or were actually instantiated. For example, footprints in the snow are dependent on the animal that creates them, thus footprints are natural signs. Exactly what the footprints in the snow indicate, or are natural signs of, is potentially limitless. A man’s footprint could indicate his size, approximate weight, fashion preferences, even infirmities if there are characteristics of a limp. Conversely, a representation’s content is not as broad, nor as unspecified. As a result, an indication relationship could be necessary for a representation relationship, but not sufficient. Furthermore, natural signs are dependent on the actual existence of their instantiating conditions while representations bear no such dependency relationships. This is the critical feature that allows representations to misrepresent something as the case when it is indeed not.\n\nFor a natural sign to become a representation requires additional constraining criteria that designate specific content from among many conditions indicated and free the indicator from absolute dependency on the existence of its instantiating conditions. The teleological characteristics of Dretske’s theory are intended to accomplish the necessary constraints. Specifically, to be a representation, a natural sign must be employed in the function of a larger system as a result of its holding in an indication relationship. Since a natural sign may hold in many indication relationships, that relationship for which it is employed by the larger system is taken to be its content-specifying relationship.\n\nBy being integrated into the function of a larger system, natural signs also become free of an absolute dependency on the existence of their instantiating conditions. By contributing its properties of indication to a larger system, a natural sign gains the function of determining what the system takes to be the case. Once this role has been given, changes in what the natural sign indicate are not necessarily reflected in what the system takes the case to be. Thus, when appropriately integrated, natural signs become representations by identifying specific content and gaining freedom from absolute dependency on their instantiating conditions.\n\nA major criticism of applying naturalistic theories of semantics to mental representation is that they fail to account for all the characteristics of mental states. Mental states have characteristic phenomenal properties and these properties are not necessitated by naturalistic theories of semantics. That is to say, these theories identify representations, with equal weight, in both conscious and unconscious systems. If an explanation is consistent with the absence of phenomenal properties, then it cannot be a full account of mental states. While this objection does nothing to undermine the progress of naturalistic theories of semantics, it demands that there are further constraining criteria before representation in mental states can be accounted for.\n"}

{"id": "10728972", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10728972", "title": "Philanthropreneur", "text": "Philanthropreneur\n\nA philanthropreneur is an entrepreneurial philanthropist. The term is claimed to be coined by Internet entrepreneur Mark Desvaux in 2004; however, \"The Wall Street Journal\" used the term in a 1999 article, and a publication entitled \"The Philanthropreneur Newsletter\" existed as far back as 1997. Philanthropreneurship is often considered the start of a new era in philanthropy, characterized by the development of the philanthropist’s role and the integration of business practices.\n\nThe core objective of philanthropreneurship is to increase the philanthropic impact of non-profit organizations. Traditionally non-profit organization solely depended on donations, grants, or other forms of charitable-giving. However, this new generation of entrepreneurs prefers to invest rather than donate. Philanthropreneurs are active donors whose role surpasses that of check writers. They leverage their resources to achieve social change that is both scalable and sustainable. As a result, their contribution is meant to go beyond providing temporary \"band-aid\" solutions. Instead of directing efforts toward the purchase of medicine for the sick and the supply of food for the hungry, philanthropreneurs seek to eradicate the problem.\n\nPhilanthropreneurs are people who bring a creative or entrepreneurial approach to philanthropy. They are interested in effecting positive changes in the world and alleviating suffering, and do so in new and creative ways. Philanthropreneurs are often \"driven to do good and have their profit, too\", as Stephanie Strom wrote in a \"New York Times\" article.\n\nAs an emerging field there is no defined operating model or strategic approach. Still, philanthropreneurship marks the transitions from a grant-distributing model to a business-based model with predefined objectives and constant focus on quantifiable results. This form of “commercial giving” demands measurable return, which is why opportunities are assessed and evaluated according to different criteria. Factors such as profitability and quantifiable performance are fixed requirements for granting support. The shift in professional management has also resulted in a greater focus on long-term goals.\n\nThe application of entrepreneurial practices in philanthropy drives the impact of connected non-profit organizations through strategic funding. Traditional philanthropy encouraged the promotion of social welfare exclusively through charitable giving. However, many well-intentioned projects fell through because of their disregard to set up revenue-generating strategies. In philanthropreneurship, prosperous ventures require the establishment of recurring income as a means of avoiding depletion of funds and ultimately preventing the social mission's dissolution.\n\nPhilanthropic buying has a limited reach, which is why philanthropreneurs do not simply dispose of surplus funds, but strategically tailor investments by actively leveraging their resources (i.e. wealth, time, business expertise, networks, reputation, and prestige). For example, Pierre Omidyar, chairman of eBay, started Omidyar Network because of his dissatisfaction with the level of impact his donations had through conventional charities. Omidyar is an exemplar of how today’s philanthropists have taken on a greater role than their charitable predecessors. Apart from bringing their checkbook, affluent philanthropists are also expected to bring in their entrepreneurial know-how.\n\nPhilanthropreneurship has been described as the emerging practice of driving social change in new and creative ways. The term has been in use since 2014. Practitioners — also known as philanthropreneurs or micro-preneurs — are entrepreneurial philanthropists. Philanthropreneurship is measured in impact, sustainability and scalability.\n\nSome practitioners — like Amr Al-Dabbagh in the \"Fortune\" article \"How to Run Your Non-Profit Like a Startup\" — are deploying entrepreneurial business practices to help drive maximum impact, sustainability and scale. Additional examples of practitioners — featured in \"The Guardian\" article by Rajesh Chandy (\"Welcome to the New Age of Philanthropy: PHILANTHROPRENEURSHIP\")—include Bill and Melinda Gates, Steve Case, Pierre Omidyar and Bill Clinton. Stephanie Strom featured these practitioners and more in her \"New York Times\" article \"What's Wrong With Profit?\" Philanthropreneurship is now supported by emerging new business models and legislation including low-profit limited liability companies (L3Cs), pioneered by tax attorney and entrepreneurial finance expert Marc J. Lane.\n\nNon-profit organizations have historically found it challenging to trust and accept the concept of \"philanthro-capitalism\". Critics note that many metrics of the commercial sectors, such as return on investment and other ratios, lack applicability to non-profit organizations. Moreover, the inclusion of commercial and enterprise strategies has generated concerns in maintaining the institution's culture and ideology. A particular concern is the risk that the organization's focus will shift away from the social mission.\n\nNonetheless, its success has piqued the interest of an increasing number of non-profit organizations, but the performance assessment of philanthropreneurial ventures remains an area of concern for many, as there is no precise measurement for social impact. For example, in \"impact investing\", a core practice of philanthropreneurship, project selection for funding is based on estimated social impact and financial return. From an ethical context, many critics argue that the incorporation of a business model commercializes the nonprofit sector and further increases the risk of distorting the organization's mission and principles.\n\nConversely, many supporters point out that traditional philanthropy alone cannot sustain social initiatives because of the shortage in sources of funding. In philanthropreneurship, a dependency in traditional fundraising is a strong predictor of failure, which is why historically the implementation of business practices enables philanthropreneurship to outperform age-old practices of philanthropy.\n\nPlaypumps International is a nongovernmental organization (NGO) founded by Trevor Field. Today the Playpump-initiative is made up of two for-profit entities and one nonprofit. Playpump International is a nonprofit in the U.S. that is partnered with Roundabout Water Solutions, a manufacturing company in South Africa.\n\nThe organization's mission is to promote public health in South Africa by providing easy access to clean, potable water in rural communities. Field designed a self-sustainable system that enabled water to be pumped into a storage tower. This model resulted in a mechanical water extraction process designed after a playground merry-go-round, which is attached to a water pump. Rotational energy generated by children playing is then used to fill the water storage tower. The system enhances living conditions and offers playing equipment for the young population. Since its invention, hundreds of water pump systems have been installed, particularly through the aid of monetary donations and governmental approvals.\n\nBefore Playpumps attained global recognition, the organization had to be self-financed in order to ensure its continuity. Because of the infrequent number of charitable donations received and lack of fundraising sources, Field sought to generate an alternative flow of income. Income was generated by marketing contracts. Four-paneled billboards concealed the Playpump water storage towers and were used to display printed ads. The purpose of generating revenue was to recapitalize on the cost of the equipment (i.e. manufacturing and installation costs). With time, monetary donations increased significantly, and thus allowed for half of each tower's panels to be dedicated to promoting social messages, specifically HIV and AIDS awareness.\n\n\n\n"}

Its mission is to bring together philosophy enthusiasts; to inspire, strengthen and promote philosophical activity in the Maltese Islands; and to contribute towards society through Philosophy. The foundation does not adhere to, or profess, any single creed or ideology. Its official languages are Maltese and English. \n\nThe original idea to create a society in order to provide meeting opportunities, and perhaps study prospects, for members of the general public who were interested in philosophy came from Peter Serracino Inglott. Though he intended to give the initiative a go, he was impeded by his untimely death in March 2012. Subsequently, however, just a few weeks after his death a group of academics, intellectuals and other members of the community came together to bring the idea to fruition. The foundation was established on 21 May, 2012, by public act. It started its public operations on the following 22 June.\n\nPSF is registered with the Commission for Voluntary Organisation (VO-0679) and, for the purposes of Maltese law, it is to be considered as a Legal Person (LPF-85).\n\nThe objectives of PSF are:\n\n\nThe activities of PSF include:\n\n\nThe long-term objectives of PSF include:\n\n\nPSF grants membership to who, graduate in philosophy or not, agrees with the mission and objectives of the foundation. Members pay a nominal annual fee.\n\nThe foundation is governed by a number of members forming a steering committee, two of which are philosophy graduates. The chairperson of the committee is elected by the members of the foundation from among themselves every two years. The committee meets on a monthly basis. \n\nThe foundation convenes a general assembly each year. The assembly appoints members of the steering committee for the next year of activity, reviews the work done during the preceding year of activity, discusses and adopts amendments to PSF’s Foundation Deed, and approves the audited accounts of the foundation and cause them to be published.\n\nPSF's main organ — called SHARE — is published on a triennial basis. The mission of SHARE is to serve as the official platform of the Philosophy Sharing Foundation, and to disseminate articles and information which contribute to philosophical discussion and debate. The magazine includes articles of a philosophical nature, reviews of books published by Maltese philosophers, snippets from the history of philosophy in Malta, the foundation's news and activities, other Philosophy news from the Maltese Islands, and some philosophical fun items. The magazine's present Editor is Meinrad Calleja.\n\nBy its establishment, PSF introduced a new experience in Malta. Formerly, philosophical activities were restricted to academics somehow connected to the University of Malta. The foundation gave philosophy a wider audience. It involves the general public in philosophical discussions, and also offers evening courses to adult students. The foundation is a member of the International Federation of Philosophy Societies (FISP), and also of the Malta-EU Steering & Action Committee.\n\n"}

She taught young Raphael the piano at the age of 6, and greatly influenced him in his habits and studies. As an ethnic German, he was uncomfortable at school, which he therefore attended only irregularly. At the age of 19, he entered a music school in Moscow over the opposition of his father, where he was befriended by Tchaikovsky and Rubinstein. He graduated at age 24, but decided not to pursue a career as a musician due to his shyness, and instead went to Jena in Germany, where he studied natural history, and later philosophy at the University of Jena with Rudolf Christoph Eucken. After receiving his doctorate at the age of 30, he held teaching posts in University of Berlin, University of Heidelberg and University of Munich, mostly teaching music history and music aesthetics.\n\nKoeber came to teach in Japan in June 1893, based on the recommendations of his friend Karl Robert Eduard von Hartmann, who overcame his worries about the long sea voyage, earthquakes and having enough English language ability to lecture. He was 45 years old. He studied and worked for 21 years at the Tokyo Imperial University from 1893 to 1914 teaching philosophy, in particular, Greek philosophy, Medieval philosophy and Aesthetics.\n\nKoeber was known to be somewhat eccentric, and had fixed habits of reading, lecturing and playing the piano per a strict schedule. He rarely visited anywhere in Japan outside of Tokyo; he traveled to nearby Kamakura and once to Enoshima. He was indifferent about money and clothes, and wore the same winter clothes for 17 years.\n\nHe had many students, among them were the famous writer Natsume Sōseki and the philosophers Nishida Kitaro and Watsuji Tetsuro. Koeber also taught piano at the Tokyo National Music School, which has now become a part of Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music. In 1901, he wrote the music for the opening of Japan Women's University. In 1903, Raphael also provided piano accompaniment for the first opera performed in Japan.\n\nWhen the Russo-Japanese War broke out in 1904, Koeber refused to return to his country and the Japanese government did not make a political issue about his desire to remain in Japan. In 1912, Koeber's domestic servant from Munich committed suicide and Koeber was shocked by the incident. In the summer of that year, Natsume Sōseki called on Koeber, and later wrote about Koeber \"a professor of noblest character\" in his book \"Teacher Koeber\" (In Japanese: \"Koeber Sensei\"). He retired from his teaching position in 1914 and decided to return to Munich. However, immediately before getting aboard the ship at Yokohama, World War I began. Unable to travel and with no place to stay, he lived out of a room at the Russian Consulate in Yokohama for nine years until his death in 1923. His grave is at the Zōshigaya cemetery in Tokyo.\n\nHis collection of books, numbering 1,999 volumes and mainly consisting of Greek and Latin classics, and works on philosophy and literature is now at the Tohoku University Library.\n\n"}

The more disturbed an area has been, the less characteristic it becomes of remnant habitat. Remnant areas are also described as \"biologically intact\" or \"ecologically intact.\"\n\nRemnant natural areas are often used as reference ecosystems in ecological restoration projects.\n\nA remnant natural area can be described in terms of its natural quality or biological integrity, which is the extent to which it has the internal biodiversity and abiotic elements to replicate itself over time. Another definition of biological integrity is \"the capability of supporting and maintaining a balanced, integrated, adaptive community of organisms having a species composition, diversity, and functional organization comparable to that of the natural habitat of the region.\" Abiotic elements determining the quality of a natural area may include factors such as hydrologic connectivity or fire. In areas that have been dredged, drained, or dammed, the altered hydrology can destroy a remnant natural area.

{"id": "364338", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=364338", "title": "Respect", "text": "Respect\n\nRespect is a positive feeling or action shown towards someone or something considered important, or held in high esteem or regard; it conveys a sense of admiration for good or valuable qualities; and it is also the process of honoring someone by exhibiting care, concern, or consideration for their needs or feelings.\n\nSome people may earn the respect of individuals by assisting others or by playing important social roles. In many cultures, individuals are considered to be worthy of respect until they prove otherwise. Courtesies that show respect include simple words and phrases like \"thank you\" in the West, simple physical gestures like a slight bow in the East, a smile, or direct eye contact, or a simple handshake.\n\nRespect is shown in many different languages by following certain grammatical conventions, especially in referring to individuals.\n\nAn honorific is a word or expression (often a pronoun) that shows respect when used in addressing or referring to a person or animal.\n\nTypically honorifics are used for second and third persons; use for first person is less common. Some languages have anti-honorific first person forms (like \"your most humble servant\" or \"this unworthy person\") whose effect is to enhance the relative honor accorded a second or third person.\n\nFor instance, it is disrespectful to not use polite language and honorifics when speaking in Japanese with someone having a higher social status. The Japanese honorific \"san\" can be used when speaking English.\n\nIn China it is rude to call someone by their first name unless you have known them for a long period of time. In work-related situations, people address each other by their title. At home people often refer to each other by nicknames or terms of kinship.\nIn the Chinese culture, individuals often address their friends as juniors and seniors even if they are just a few months younger or older. When a Chinese person asks someone their age they often do this so they know how to address the person.\n\nIn Islamic cultures around the world, there are many ways to show respect to people. For example, it is recommended to kiss the hands of parents, grandparents and teachers. Also, it is narrated in the sayings of Muhammad that if a person looks at the faces of parents and teachers with a smile, he will definitely be rewarded by Allah with success and happiness.\n\nIn India, it is customary that, out of respect, when a person's foot accidentally touches a book or any written material (considered to be a manifestations of Saraswati, the goddess of knowledge) or another person's leg, it will be followed by an apology in the form of a single hand gesture (Pranāma) with the right hand, where the offending person first touches the object with the finger tips and then the forehead and/or chest. This also counts for money, which is considered to be a manifestation of the goddess of wealth Lakshmi. Pranāma, or the touching of feet in Indian culture is a sign of respect. For instance, when a child is greeting his or her grandparent, they typically will touch their hands to their grandparents' feet. In Indian culture, it is believed that the feet are a source of power and love.\n\nIn many African/West Indian descent communities and some non-African//West Indian descent communities, respect can be signified by the touching of fists.\n\nMany gestures or physical acts that are common in the West can be considered disrespectful in Japan. For instance, one should not point directly at someone. When greeting someone or thanking them, it may be insulting if the person of lower status does not bow lower than the person with higher status. The duration and level of the bow depends on many factors such as age and status. Some signs of physical respect apply to women only. If a woman does not wear cosmetics or a brassiere, it is possible that she will be considered unprofessional or others may think she does not care about the situation.\n\nUnlike Japanese culture, it is not necessary in Chinese culture to bow to one another as a greeting or parting gesture. Bowing is generally reserved as a sign of respect for elders and ancestors. When bowing, they place the fist of the right hand in the palm of their left at stomach level. The deeper the bow, the more respect they are showing.\n\nIn Chinese culture, there is not much participation in physical contact, especially when doing business because this can be seen as too casual, thus disrespectful. It is considered rude to slap, pat, or put one's arm around the shoulders of another. However, affection in same-sex friendships in East Asia is much more pronounced than in the West. Same-sex friends will often be seen with their arms around one another, holding hands, and other signs of physical affection.\n\nIt is uncommon to see very many hand gestures being used in Chinese culture because this is often considered to be excessive.\n\nTraditionally, there was not much hand-shaking in Chinese culture. However, this gesture is now widely practiced among men, especially when greeting Westerners or other foreigners. Many Westerners may find Chinese handshakes to be too long or too weak, but this is because a weaker handshake is a gesture of humility and respect.\n\nKowtowing, or kneeling and bowing so deeply that one's forehead is touching the floor, is practiced during worship at temples. Kowtowing is a powerful gesture reserved mainly for honoring the dead or offering deep respect at a temple.\n\nMany codes of behavior revolve around young people showing respect to older people. Like in many cultures, younger Chinese individuals are expected to defer to older people, let them speak first, sit down after them and not contradict them. Sometimes when an older person enters a room, everyone stands. People are often introduced from oldest to youngest. Often time, younger people will go out of their way to open doors for their elders and not cross their legs in front of them. The older you are the more respect you are expected to be treated with.\n\nIn many indigenous American societies the perspective on respect differs slightly because it serves as an important concept valued in their culture's context. Aside from meaning positive feelings of esteem or deference is also viewed as a moral value that teaches indigenous individuals about their culture. In addition, this moral value is treated as a process that influences certain participation in the community and also helps the individual develop and become integrated into their culture's community. During childhood is when this value of respect is taught because indigenous children participating in and learning about their community is an important aspect of the culture.\n\nRespect as a form of behavior and participation is especially important in childhood as it serves as a basis of how the child must conduct themselves in their community. Children engage in mature activities such as cooking for the family, cleaning and sweeping the house, caring for infant peers, and crop work. Indigenous children learn to view their participation in these activities are a representation of respect.

It is widely considered to be one of the most beautiful of all of the 95 books of the Shōbōgenzō according to Stanford University professor Carl Bielefeldt. The text was written in the fall of 1240 at Dōgen's monastery Kōshōhōrin-ji in Kyoto, and the manuscript from that time in Dōgen's own hand survives. This year saw a marked increase in the output of his essays for the Shōbōgenzō, including the closely related work Keisei sanshoku written a few months before and covering essentially the same theme, namely the mountains and rivers as equivalent to the body and speech of the Buddha. The book appears as the 29th in the 75 fascicle versions of the Shōbōgenzō, and it is ordered 14th in the later chronological 95 fascicle \"Honzan\" edition. It was also included as the 14th book of the 28 fascicle \"Eiheiji manuscript\" Shōbōgenzō. Gudō Nishijima, a modern Zen priest, sums up the essay as follows: \"Buddhism is basically a religion of belief in the universe, and nature is the universe showing its real form. So to look at nature is to look at the Buddhist truth itself. For this reason, Master Dōgen believed that nature is just Buddhist sutras.\"\n"}
{"id": "11643537", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11643537", "title": "Self-compassion", "text": "Self-compassion\n\nSelf-compassion is extending compassion to one's self in instances of perceived inadequacy, failure, or general suffering. Kristin Neff has defined self-compassion as being composed of three main components – self-kindness, common humanity, and mindfulness.\n\n\nSelf-compassion has been considered to resemble Carl Rogers' notion of \"unconditional positive regard\" applied both towards clients and oneself; Albert Ellis' \"unconditional self-acceptance\"; Maryhelen Snyder's notion of an \"internal empathizer\" that explored one's own experience with \"curiosity and compassion\"; Ann Weiser Cornell's notion of a gentle, allowing relationship with all parts of one's being; and Judith Jordan's concept of \"self-empathy\", which implies acceptance, care and empathy towards the self.\n\nSelf-compassion is different from self-pity, a state of mind or emotional response of a person believing to be a victim and lacking the confidence and competence to cope with an adverse situation.\n\nResearch indicates that self-compassionate individuals experience greater psychological health than those who lack self-compassion. For example, self-compassion is positively associated with life satisfaction, wisdom, happiness, optimism, curiosity, learning goals, social connectedness, personal responsibility, and emotional resilience. At the same time, it is associated with a lower tendency for self-criticism, depression, anxiety, rumination, thought suppression, perfectionism, and disordered eating attitudes.\n\nSelf-compassion has different effects than self-esteem, a subjective emotional evaluation of the self. Although psychologists extolled the benefits of self-esteem for many years, recent research has exposed costs associated with the pursuit of high self-esteem, including narcissism, distorted self-perceptions, contingent and/or unstable self-worth, as well as anger and violence toward those who threaten the ego. It appears that self-compassion offers the same mental health benefits as self-esteem, but with fewer of its drawbacks such as narcissism, ego-defensive anger, inaccurate self-perceptions, self-worth contingency, or social comparison.\n\nMuch of the research conducted on self-compassion so far has used the Self-Compassion Scale, created by Kristin Neff, which measures the degree to which individuals display self-kindness against self-judgment, common humanity versus isolation, and mindfulness versus over-identification.\n\nThe Self-Compassion Scale has been translated into different languages. Some of these include a Czech, Dutch, Japanese, Chinese, Turkish and Greek version.\n\nThe original sample for which the scale was developed consisted of 68 undergraduate students from a large university in the United States. In this experiment, the participants narrowed down the potential scale items to 71.\n\nThe next stage of development involved testing the reliability and validity of the scale among a larger group of participants. During this research study, 391 undergraduate students were selected at random to complete the 71 previously narrowed down scale items. Based on their results, the number of items was reduced to 26. The self-compassion scales have good reliability and validity.\n\nA second study was conducted to look more closely at the difference between self-esteem and self-compassion. This study consisted of 232 randomly selected, undergraduate students. Participants were asked to complete a number of different scales in questionnaire form. They were as follows: The 26-item Self-compassion Scale, the 10-item Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale, the 10-item Self-determination Scale, the 21-item Basic Psychological Needs Scale, and the 40-item Narcissistic Personality Inventory. Based on the findings, Neff reports \"that self-compassion and self-esteem were measuring two different psychological phenomena.\"\n\nA third study was conducted to examine the construct validity. By comparing two different groups of people, researchers would be able to see the different levels of self-compassion. Forty-three Buddhist practitioners completed the Self-compassion Scale as well as a self-esteem scale. The sample of 232 undergraduate students from the second study was used as the comparison group. As expected by Neff, the Buddhist practitioners had significantly higher self-compassion scores than the students.\n\nThe long version of the Self-compassion scale (SCS) consists of 26 items. This includes 6 subscales – self-kindness, self-judgement, common humanity, isolation, mindfulness, and over-identification. Neff recommends this scale for ages 14 and up with a minimum 8th grade reading level.\n\nPresented on a Likert scale, ranging from 1 (almost no self-compassion) to 5 (constant self-compassion), those completing the SCS are able to gain insight on how they respond to themselves during a struggle or challenging time.\n\nA shorter, Dutch version of the SCS scale has been developed that uses 24 items.\n\nThe short version of the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS-SF) consists of 12 items and is available in Dutch and English. Research reveals that the short form scale can be used competently as a substitute for the long form scale. A study conducted at the University of Leuven, Belgium concluded that when examining total scores, this shorter version provides an almost perfect correlation with the longer version.\n\nNeff's scale proposes three interacting components of self-compassion, which are each composed of two opposite facets. The first dimension is self-kindness versus self-judgment. Self-kindness refers to one's ability to be kind and understanding of oneself, whereas self-judgement refers to being critical and harsh towards oneself. The second dimension is common humanity versus isolation. Common humanity refers to one's ability to recognize that they are part of a related group of others and that suffering is part of the human condition. The third dimension is mindfulness versus over-identification. Mindfulness refers to one's awareness and acceptance of painful experiences in a balanced and non-judgmental way. Neff describes these three dimensions interacting to enhance and engender one another.\n\nCurrently, Kristin Neff's Self-Compassion Scale is the only self-report instrument used to measure self-compassion. Although it is widely accepted as being a reliable and valid tool to measure self-compassion, recent research has posed questions regarding the scale's generalizability and its use of a six-factor model.\n\nThe generalizability of Neff's Self-Compassion Scale can be questioned; although the scale is used to measure self-compassion in the general population and has been translated into many languages, the scale itself has mostly been tested on college students.\n\nA recent study performed by Angélica López et al. examined the factor structure, reliability, and construct validity of Neff's Self-compassion Scale using a large representative sample from the general population. The study consisted of 1,736 participants and used both a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to determine if Neff's six-factor structure could be replicated.\n\nLopez's study could not replicate the six-factor structure of Neff's Self-compassion Scale, but rather suggested a two-factor model of the scale, created by grouping the positive and negative items separately. Lopez's study also suggests it is important to view self-compassion and self-criticism as being distinct from one another, traits that Neff's Self-compassion Scale assumes are opposites. Lopez's study makes it clear that there is room for further research into the validity of the six-factor structure used by Neff's Self-compassion Scale.\n\nSelf-compassion exercises generally consist of either a writing exercise, role-playing, or introspective contemplation, and are designed to foster self-kindness, mindfulness, and feelings of common humanity. Self-compassion exercises have been shown to be effective in increasing self-compassion, along with increases in self-efficacy, optimism, and mindfulness. These exercises have also been shown to decrease rumination. In individuals who were vulnerable to depression, one week of daily self-compassion exercises lead to reduced depression up to three months following the exercise, and increased happiness up to six months following the exercise, regardless of the pre-exercise levels of happiness.\n\nThis exercise asks the user to imagine that they are comforting a close friend who is going through a tough situation. The user is then asked to compare and contrast how they react internally to their own struggles, and to endeavour applying the same loving kindness to themselves that they would apply to a friend.\n\nThis exercise is to be used during times of acute distress. The user is asked to focus on a stressful event or situation. Then, the user is asked to repeat several prompts to themselves, each of which emphasizes one of the three main tenets of self-compassion: mindfulness, common humanity, and self-kindness.\n\nIn this exercise, the user is asked to focus on a facet of themself that they believe to be an imperfection, and that makes them feel inadequate. Once they have brought this issue to mind, they are asked to write a letter to themself from the perspective of an unconditionally loving imaginary friend. The user is then asked to focus on the soothing and comforting feelings of compassion that they have generated for themself.\n\nThis exercise asks the user to occupy several \"chairs\" during the course of the practice. Initially, they are asked to occupy the chair of the self-critic, and to express their feelings of self-criticism. They are asked to analyze this criticism and make note of its defining characteristics. Then, the user is asked to take the chair of their criticized self, and to imagine verbally responding to their inner critic. Subsequently, the user is prompted to conduct a dialogue between these two aspects of the self, the criticizer and the criticized. Following this, the user is asked to imagine themself as a compassionate observer of this dialogue, and finally the user is asked to reflect upon the experience.\n\nThis exercise is meant to be conducted over several weeks, in the form of recurring reflection on the nature of their self-criticism. Users are asked to aim to notice when they are being self-critical, to react to their self-criticism with compassion, and to reframe the language of their inner critic.\n\nThis exercise entails keeping a daily journal for at least one week, and is used to reflect on difficult experiences, self-criticisms, and other stressors. The user is asked to analyze each of these events through the lenses of self-kindness (using gentle, comforting language to respond to the event), mindfulness (awareness of the negative emotions elicited by the situation), and common humanity (how the experience is part of the human condition).\n\nIn this exercise, the user is asked to think about the ways that they use self-criticism as a way to motivate themself. Then, the user is asked to try to come up with a kinder and gentler and more caring way of motivating themself to make the desired change, and to try and be aware of how they use self-criticism as a motivational tool in the future.\n\nThis exercise prompts the user to engage in meaningful self-care on a regular basis, and to practice these techniques while they are actively caring for others.\n\nSelf-forgiveness is an element of self-compassion that involves releasing self-directed negative feelings. Research has found that self-forgiveness promotes greater overall well-being, specifically higher self-esteem and lower neuroticism.\n\nWhen self-directed negative feelings are a result of negative past action, self-forgiveness does not mean ignoring or excusing offenses, but rather practicing self-compassion while taking full responsibility for past action. In this way, self-forgiveness may increase people's willingness to repent for wrongdoing. Despite this research, there is not yet a clear link between self-forgiveness and pro-social behavior. It would seem that accepting responsibility for negative actions leads to pro-social behavior, and coupling acceptance with self-forgiveness increases this effect.\n\nSelf-acceptance is an element of self-compassion that involves accepting oneself for who and what they are. Self-acceptance differs from self-esteem in that self-esteem involves globally evaluating one's worth. Self-acceptance means accepting the self despite flaws, weaknesses, and negative evaluations from others.\n\nThe concept of mindfulness and self-compassion has been around for over 2500 years, and is rooted in Eastern traditional Buddhist philosophy and Buddhist meditation. In Buddhist philosophy, mindfulness and compassion is considered to be two wings of one bird, with each concept overlapping one another but producing benefits for wellbeing. The word Mindfulness is the English translation of the word Vipassan, which a combination of two words Vi, meaning in a special way and Passana, to observe, hence implying to observe in a special way. Compassion (karunaa) can be defined as an emotion that elicits the wanting to be free from suffering. Mindfulness in the context of self-compassion comprises acknowledging one's painful experiences in a balanced way that neither ignores, or ruminates on the disliked characteristics of oneself or life. According to Neff (2012) it is essential to be mindful of one's own personal suffering in order to extend compassion towards one's self. However it is essential to pay attention to self suffering in a grounded way in order to avoid \"over-identification\". Mindfulness tends to focus on the internal experience such as sensation, emotion and thoughts rather than focusing on the experiencer. Self-compassion focuses on soothing and comforting the self when faced with distressing experiences. Self-compassion is composed of three components; self kindness verses self-judgement, a sense of common humanity versus isolation and mindfulness versus over-identification when confronting painful thoughts and emotions.\n\nMindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), developed by Jon Kabat-Zinn is a structured group program that uses mindfulness meditation to relieve suffering associated with physical, psychosomatic and psychiatric disorders. Mindfulness-based stress reduction therapy seeks to increase the capacity for mindfulness, by reducing the need for self-focused thoughts and emotions that can lead to poor mental health. The exercise of mindfulness-based stress reduction therapy brings together the elements of meditation and yoga, greater awareness of the unity of mind and body, as well as the ways that the unconscious thoughts, feelings, and behaviors can undermine emotional, physical, and spiritual health. Clinical research from the past 25 years has found that MBSR is efficacious in reducing distress and enhancing individual well-being. Self-Compassion can play a critical role in mindfulness-based cognitive therapy interventions. In the study Shapiro et al. (2005) found that health care professionals who underwent a MBSR program reported significantly increased self-compassion and reduced stress levels compared to the waitlist control group. It was also reported that the increase of self-compassion appeared to reduce stress associated with the program.\n\nMindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is an intervention therapy that combines meditation practices, psycho-education and cognitive behavioral strategies to prevent the relapse or recurrence of major depression. MBCT teaches individuals how to observe their thoughts and feelings by focusing their attention on natural objects, such as breathing and bodily sensations. Individuals are taught how to achieve awareness while holding an attitude of non-judgemental acceptance. Within MBCT, mindfulness skills are taught in order to recognize distressing thoughts and feelings, to be aware of these experiences, and utilize acceptance and self-compassion to break up associative networks that may causes a relapse. Self-compassion in response to negative thoughts and feelings is an adaptive process, which validates it as a key learning skill in MBCT. Self-compassion has been found to be a key mechanism in the effectiveness of mindfulness-based interventions such as mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT). Kuyken et al. (2010) compared the effect of MBCT with maintenance antidepressants on relapse in depressive symptoms. They found that mindfulness and self-compassion were increased after MBCT was introduced. They also found that MBCT reduced the connection of cognitive reactivity and depressive relapse, and that the increased self-compassion helped mediate this association.\n\nMindful self-compassion (MSC) therapy is a hybrid therapy consisting of self-compassion and mindfulness practices. The term mindful is referred to in the MSC program as the basic mindfulness skills which is turning toward painful thoughts and emotions and seeing them as they are without suppression or avoidance which is crucial to the development of self-compassion. The MSC program however focuses more on self-compassion and sees mindfulness as a secondary emphasis. MSC teaches both formal (meditation) and informal (daily life) self-compassion practices. In addition there are homework MSC assignments that teaches participants to be kinder to themselves. The goal of MSC therapy is to provide participants with a variety of tools to increase self-compassion which they can then in turn integrate into their lives. A study conducted by Neff and Germer (2012) found that compared with the control group, MSC intervention participants reported significantly larger increases in self-compassion, mindfulness, wellbeing and a decrease in depression, stress and anxiety which were maintained for 6 months after the initial intervention.\n\nPaul Gilbert (2009) developed compassion focused therapy (CFT) that teaches clients that, due to how our brains have evolved, anxiety, anger and depression are natural experiences that are occur through no fault of our own. Patients are trained to change maladaptive thought patterns such as \"I'm unlovable\" and provide alternative self-statements, such as \"know for sure that some people love me\". The goal of CFT is to help patients develop a sense of warmth and emotional responsiveness to oneself. This is achieved through a variety of exercises including visualization, cultivating self-kindest through language by engaging in self-compassionate behaviors and habits. In CFT self-compassion is utilized through thoughts, images, and attention which is needed to stimulate and develop the contentment, sooth and safeness system.\n\nDialectical behavior therapy (DBT), is a derivative of cognitive behavior therapy that incorporates Eastern meditative practice. DBT is based on a dialectical world view that incorporates the balance and integration of opposing beliefs, particularly in acceptance and change. We accept ourselves as good enough, and we recognize the need for all of us to change and grow. Unlike MBCT and MBSR therapies, dialectical behavior therapy does not use meditation but less formal exercises, such as individual therapy sessions and group skill sessions. In general last for approximately a year where participants will engage in weekly individual skill therapy sessions and group skill sessions. The skills therapy sessions include four segments; core mindfulness, interpersonal effectiveness, emotion regulation, and distress tolerance skills. Dialectical behaviour therapist recommend developing self-compassion. The basic premise of using self-compassion therapies in DBT is to cultivate a compassionate mind state, defined by feelings of warmth, safety, presence and interconnectedness that can in turn relieve emotional dysregulation.\n\nAcceptance and commitment therapy utilizes behavior change process, mindfulness and acceptance process. ACT, involves non-judgmental awareness and openness to cognitive sensation an emotional experiences. It also promotes exposure to previously avoided situations that have caused anxiety in order to promote acceptance. The avoidant behavior is treated by having clients observing their thoughts and accepting that their thoughts are not necessarily harmful. In general ACT strategies are customized to fit each participant so they obtain psycho-education, problem solving skills and psychological flexibility. Mindfulness and acceptance exercises skills facilitates the behavioral changes necessary for its user to pursue a life that they feel is vital and meaningful. Various sources have indicated that acceptance and commitment therapy overlaps with Neff's conceptualization of self compassion particularly the ACT's relational frame theory. The basic theories and concepts underlining ACT, may be relevant and have shown to be parallels and hold similarities found in self-compassion The first is ACT perspective and Neff's concept of self-kindness are both linked to self-acceptance. Acceptance of one's painful experiences and hurt is related to kindness to one's self. Second Neff's conceptualization of self-compassion and ACT both emphasize mindfulness, which is practiced ACT through the concepts of defusion, acceptance, contact with the present moment and the self as a context. Defusion is also used in self-compassion as a means of allowing self-criticisms to pass through the mind with believing, proving them wrong or engaging stance to make these thoughts workable. In a study conducted by Yadavaia, Hayes & Vilardaga, 2014 test the efficacy of an ACT approach to self-compassion as compared to a waitlist control, the study showed that ACT interventions led to a large increase in self-compassion and psychopathology compared to the waitlist control at post-treatment and two months post intervention.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5509824", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5509824", "title": "Simonians", "text": "Simonians\n\nThe Simonians were a Gnostic sect of the 2nd century which regarded Simon Magus as its founder and traced its doctrines, known as Simonianism, back to him. The sect flourished in Syria, in various districts of Asia Minor and at Rome. In the 3rd century remnants of it still existed, which survived until the 4th century.\n\nJustin Martyr wrote in his \"Apology\" (152 AD) that the sect of the Simonians appeared to have been formidable, as he speaks four times of their founder, Simon.\n\nThe Simonians are mentioned by Hegesippus; their doctrines are quoted and opposed in connection with Simon Magus by Irenaeus, by the \"Philosophumena\", and later by Epiphanius of Salamis. Origen also mentions that some of the sect were called Heleniani.\n\nAccording to John D. Turner, the Simonians originated as a local Jewish cult in the first century CE, which centered on a Samaritan holy man. This early cult was syncretistic, but not Gnostic. In the second century, under influence of Christianity, Simon was transformed into a Gnostic saviour. The influence of Greek philosophy resulted in a Gnostic \"monistic theogony.\"\n\nAccording to Aldo Magris, Samaritan Baptist sects were an offshoot of John the Baptist. One offshoot was in turn headed by Dositheus, Simon Magus, and Menander. It was in this milieu that the idea emerged that the world was created by ignorant angels. Their baptismal ritual removed the consequences of sin, and lead to a regeneration by which natural death, which was caused by these angels, was overcome. The Samaritan leaders were viewed as \"the embodiment of God's power, spirit, or wisdom, and as the redeemer and revealer of 'true knowledge'.\"\n\nDositheus, a Samaritan who died from starvation, is said to have originally been the \"Standing One,\" or leader, of John the Baptist's sect, but stepped aside in favor of Simon Magus. Origen, who was ordained priest in AD 231, speaks of Dositheus, and also mentions Simon Magus. As late as the beginning of the 7th century, Eulogius of Alexandria opposed Dositheans, who regarded Dositheus as the great prophet foretold by Moses. \n\nLike Simon, Menander, who was a pupil and, after Simon's death, his most important successor, also proclaimed himself to be the one sent of God, the Messias. In the same way he taught the creation of the world by angels who were sent by the \"Ennoia\". He asserted that men received immortality and the resurrection by his baptism and practiced magical arts. The sect named after him, the Menandrians, continued to exist for a considerable length of time. \n\nSimonian influences continued through Menander's own followers who included Saturninus of Antioch and Basilides, the latter identified by Ireneus with the further development of his predecessors ideas. Carpocrates practised in the tradition of Basildes, and his own follower, Marcellina, became one of the few female leaders of early Christianity in 2nd century Rome.\n\nIn the \"Philosophumena\" of Hippolytus, Simon's doctrine is recorded according to his reputed work, \"The Great Declaration\", as it existed in the 2nd century. As Hippolytus himself in more than one place points out, it is an earlier form of the Valentinian doctrine, but there are things reminiscent of Aristotelian and Stoic physics.\n\nThe whole book is a mixture of Hellenism and Hebraism, in which the same method of allegory is applied to Homer and Hesiod as to Moses. Starting from the assertion of Moses that God is \"a devouring fire\" (Deuteronomy 4:24), Simon combined therewith the philosophy of Heraclitus which made fire the first principle of all things. This first principle he denominated a \"Boundless Power,\" and he declared it to dwell in the sons of men, beings born of flesh and blood. But fire was not the simple thing that the many imagined, and Simon distinguished between its hidden and its manifest qualities, maintaining that the former were the cause of the latter. Like the Stoics he conceived of it as an intelligent being. From this ungenerated being sprang the generated world of which we know, whereof there were six roots, having each its inner and its outer side, and arranged as follows:\n\nThese six roots, \"Mind, Voice, Reason, Reflection, Name\", and \"Thought\", are also called six powers. Commingled with them all was the great power, the \"Boundless Power.\" This was that which \"has stood, stands, and will stand,\" the seventh power (root) corresponding to the seventh day after the six days of creation. This seventh power existed before the world, it is the Spirit of God that moved upon the face of the waters (Genesis 1:2). It existed potentially in every child of man, and might be developed in each to its own immensity. The small might become great, the point be enlarged to infinity. This indivisible point which existed in the body, and of which none but the spiritual knew, was the Kingdom of Heaven, and the grain of mustard-seed. But it rested with us to develop it, and it is this responsibility which is referred to in the words—\"that we may not be condemned with the world\" (1 Corinthians 11:32). For if the image of the Standing One were not actualized in us, it would not survive the death of the body. \"The axe,\" he said, \"is nigh to the roots of the tree: Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire\" (\"cf.\" Matthew 3:10).\n\nThere is a remarkable physiological interpretation of the Garden of Eden that evinces a certain amount of anatomical knowledge on the part of Simon or his followers. Here, Paradise is the womb, and the river going out of Eden is envisioned as the umbilical cord.\n\nThe five books of Moses are made to represent the five senses:\n\nAs the female side of the original being appears the \"thought\" or \"conception\" (\"ennoia\"), which is the mother of the Aeons. There is a mystical passage on the unity of all things, suggestive of the \"Emerald Tablet.\" Its language seems to throw light on the story about Helen.\n\nThe Simonians were variously accused of using magic and theurgy, incantations and love-potions; declaring idolatry a matter of indifference that was neither good nor bad, proclaiming all sex to be perfect love, and altogether leading very disorderly, immoral lives. Eusebius of Caesarea, in his 4th century Historia Ecclesiastica, writes that 'every vile corruption that could either be done or devised, is practised by this most abominable heresy'. In general, they were said to regard nothing in itself as good or bad by nature: it was not good works that made men blessed, in the next world, but the grace bestowed by Simon and Helena on those who followed them.\n\nTo this end, the Simonians were said to venerate Simon under the image of Zeus, and Helena under that of Athena. However, Hippolytus adds that \"if any one, on seeing the images either of Simon or Helen, shall call them by those names, he is cast out, as showing ignorance of the mysteries.\" From this it is evident that the Simonians did not allow that they actually worshipped their founders. In the Clementine \"Recognitions\" Helena is called Luna, which may mean that the images were allegorical representations of the sun and moon.\n\nThe writer of the pseudo-Cyprian \"De Rebaptismate\" says that on the strength of the words of John, that \"we were to be baptized with the Holy Ghost and with fire,\" the Simonians maintained that the orthodox baptism was a mere form, and that they had the real baptism, for, as soon as their neophytes went down into the water, a fire appeared on it. The writer does not dispute the fact, but is at a loss what to make of it. Was it a bit of jugglery, or a natural phenomenon, or a piece of self-deception, or an effect of magic? In advocacy of this baptism, we are told, there was composed by the same heretics a book which was inscribed the \"Preaching of Paul.\"\n\nOutside of these patristic sources, the Simonians are briefly mentioned in the \"Testimony of Truth\" (58,1-60,3) from the Nag Hammadi Library, wherein the Gnostic author seems to include them among a long list of \"heretics\":\n\nTranslator Birger A. Pearson notes that these passages probably deal with the practices of libertine Gnostic sects, but from the fragmentary state of the text, it is impossible to know to what groups are being referred. The staunchly ascetic author may have had no more issue with the Simonians than their marrying and having children. However, Epiphanius also accuses the Simonians of having \"enjoined mysteries of obscenity and—to set it forth more seriously—of the sheddings of bodies, \"emissionum virorum, feminarum menstruorum\", and that they should be gathered up for mysteries in a most filthy collection; that these were the mysteries of life, and of the most perfect \"gnosis\".\"\n\n\n"}

It contains a collection of 13 critical studies of the Qur'an written over the past two centuries by historians and scholars of the Middle East: Ibn Warraq, Theodor Nöldeke, Leone Caetani, Alphonse Mingana, Arthur Jeffery, David Samuel Margoliouth, Abraham Geiger, William St. Clair Tisdall, Charles Cutler Torrey and Andrew Rippin.\n\nThe book examines widely held beliefs about the historical origins and sources of the Islamic holy book. It challenges the notion that the Qur'an is error free, a view held by Muslims. Divided into four parts, the book presents an examination of the Qur'an. After an introduction in Part One, Part Two focuses on the difficulty of establishing a reliable Qur'anic text, while Part Three claims to detail the Jewish, Christian, and Zoroastrian sources of the Qur'an. Part Four attempts to disprove the historical reliability of the earliest Islamic sources.\n\nHerbert Berg in his review from the \"Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies\" summarized the essays lauding the inclusion of the essay by Theodor Nöldeke while panning the inclusion of William St. Clair Tisdall's as \"not a particularly scholarly essay\". He concluded \"[i]t seems that Ibn Warraq has included some of the essays not on the basis of their scholarly value or their status as 'classics', but rather on the basis of their hostility to Islam. This does not necessarily diminish the value of the collection, but the reader should be aware that this collection does not fully represent classic scholarship on the Quran.\" \n\nFrançois de Blois criticized Ibn Warraq's work for including the essay by St. Clair Tisdall describing it as a \"shoddy piece of missionary propaganda\" and the \"worst\" among the essays of the book. De Blois also indicated that there are \"quite a few mistakes in the spelling of both of Arabic and of European languages\" and added that \"the fact that the piece of Qur'anic calligraphy reproduced on the front cover has been printed up-side down is not, presumably, an intentional insult to the editor's former co-religionists\".\n\nChristopher Melchert, a professor at the University of Oxford, said that the collection offered \"a fair impression of European Qur’an studies in the first half of the twentieth century\" but also believes that the sources that Warraq cites are better to be read first-hand.\n\nTodd Lawson said regarding the book that \"arrogance and amateurish assumptions abound; and all is sounded in the key of gormless hysteria...It must be said that it undoubtedly demonstrates the editor's diligence and industry in finding churlish things to say about the Qur'an in English. It is difficult to recommend this production, except perhaps for antiquarian interests and the archaeology of the study of Islam.\"\n\n\n"}

Starring in the sketch are Archimedes (John Cleese), Socrates (Eric Idle), Hegel (Graham Chapman), Nietzsche (Michael Palin), Marx (Terry Jones), and Kant (Terry Gilliam). Palin also provides the match television commentary.\n\nThe footage opens with the banner headline \"International Philosophy\", and Palin providing the narrative. Confucius is the referee and keeps times with an hourglass. St. Thomas Aquinas and St. Augustine (sporting haloes) serve as linesmen. The German manager is Martin Luther. As play begins, the philosophers break from their proper football positions only to walk around on the pitch as if deeply pondering, and in some cases declaiming their theories. Franz Beckenbauer, the sole genuine footballer on the pitch and a \"surprise inclusion\" in the German team, is left more than a little confused.\n\nThe sketch was performed in the Grünwalder Stadion. It originally featured in the second \"Monty Python's Fliegender Zirkus\" episode broadcast on 18 December 1972 and was later included in \"Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl (1982).\"\n\nThe Greek players, mostly with long gray beards and hair, play in togas, while the Germans sport a variety of period dress including Victorian frock coats and breeches. \"Nobby\" Hegel carries a grey top hat, while Beckenbauer wears the red and white of the 1972 Bayern Munich football strip.\n\nNietzsche receives a yellow card after claiming that Confucius has no free will. Confucius replies, \"Name go in book\".\n\nIn the second half, with nothing being accomplished on the field other than contemplation, Karl Marx is noticed warming up vigorously on the German sidelines. Marx soon races onto the field to substitute Ludwig Wittgenstein, his energy appearing as an obvious game-changer. Upon the referee's restart, Marx simply pulls up and starts meandering in deep thought like the rest.\n\nWith just over a minute of the match remaining Archimedes cries out \"Eureka!\", takes the first kick of the ball and rushes towards the German goal. After several passes through a perplexed German defence, Socrates scores the only goal of the match in a diving header off a cross from Archimedes.\n\nAs the sketch closes, the Germans dispute the call, as the match commentator says: \"Hegel is arguing that the reality is merely an \"a priori\" adjunct of non-naturalistic ethics, Kant via the categorical imperative is holding that ontologically it exists only in the imagination, and Marx is claiming it was offside.\" The replay proves that, according to the offside rule, Socrates was indeed offside, but the sketch, nevertheless, states that the Greeks have won.\n\nThe names of the Greek philosophers in the line-up are displayed in German in the sketch. Despite the sketch, Wittgenstein was in fact Austrian and not German. Supporting the main referee Confucius as linesmen were St Augustine and St Thomas Aquinas who were Roman African and Italian respectively.\n\n<onlyinclude></onlyinclude>\n\nInspired by the famous Monty Python sketch, and with the full backing of the surviving Pythons, a tribute/replay of The Philosophers' Football Match was held in North London, at Wingate & Finchley’s Harry Abrahams Stadium, Finchley on 9 May 2010.\n\nThis tongue-in-cheek re-staging—on a real London pitch—of the original sketch, was the idea of The Philosophy Shop, a specialist provider of education and training for primary school children. The group works to enable Philosophy graduates at University level to conduct practical philosophy sessions for children aged 5 to 11 as part of a drive to boost their reasoning skills from their first days in the school environment.\n\nPhilosophers A. C. Grayling and former England Manager Graham Taylor had been appointed as managers for the event, and players included comedians Mark Steel, Tony Hawks, Arthur Smith, and Ariane Sherine, as well as philosophers Julian Baggini, Nigel Warburton, Simon Glendinning, Stephen Law, Angie Hobbs, and Mark Vernon, plus other academics from Universities nationwide. Match supporters included sociologist and BBC Radio 4's \"Thinking Allowed\" presenter Laurie Taylor, the BBC’s John Humphrys, and educationalist and author Anthony Seldon.\n\n"}

{"id": "12448716", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12448716", "title": "Translation (relic)", "text": "Translation (relic)\n\nIn Christianity, the translation of relics is the removal of holy objects from one locality to another (usually a higher status location); usually only the movement of the remains of the saint's body would be treated so formally, with secondary relics such as items of clothing treated with less ceremony. Translations could be accompanied by many acts, including all-night vigils and processions, often involving entire communities.\n\nThe solemn translation (in Latin, \"translatio\") of relics is not treated as the outward recognition of sanctity. Rather, miracles confirmed a saint's sanctity, as evinced by the fact that when, in the twelfth century, the Papacy attempted to make sanctification an 'official' process; many collections of miracles were written in the hope of providing proof of the saint-in-question's status. In the early Middle Ages, however, solemn translation marked the moment at which, the saint's miracles having been recognized, the relic was moved by a bishop or abbot to a prominent position within the church. Local veneration was then permitted. This process is known as \"local canonization\".\n\nThe date of a translation of a saint's relics was celebrated as a feast day in its own right. For example, on January 27 is celebrated the translation of the relics of St. John Chrysostom from the Armenian village of Comana (where he died in exile in 407) to Constantinople. The most commonly celebrated feast days, however, are the 'dies natales' (the day on which the saint died, not the modern idea of birthday).\n\nRelics sometimes travelled very far. The relics of Saint Thyrsus at Sozopolis, Pisidia, in Asia Minor, were brought to Constantinople and then to Spain. His cult became popular in the Iberian Peninsula, where he is known as San Tirso or Santo Tirso. Some of his relics were brought to France: Thyrsus is thus the titular saint of the cathedral of Sisteron in the Basses Alpes, the Cathédrale Notre Dame et Saint Thyrse. Thyrsus is thus the patron saint of Sisteron. Liborius of Le Mans became patron saint of Paderborn, in Germany, after his relics were transferred there in 836.\n\nIn the early church, the disturbance, let alone the division, of the remains of martyrs and other saints, was not of concern or interest, much less practised. It was assumed that they would remain permanently in their often unidentified resting places in cemeteries and the catacombs of Rome (but always outside the walls of the city, continuing a pagan taboo). Then, martyriums began to be built over the site of the burial of saints. It came to be considered beneficial to the soul to be buried close to saintly remains, and as such, several large \"funerary halls\" were built over the sites of martyr's graves, the primary example being the Old Saint Peter's Basilica. \n\nThe earliest recorded removal of saintly remains was that of Saint Babylas at Antioch in 354. However, partly perhaps because Constantinople lacked the many saintly graves of Rome, translations soon became common in the Eastern Empire, even though it was still prohibited in the West. The Eastern capital was able to acquire the remains of Saints Timothy, Andrew and Luke. The division of bodies also began; the 5th century theologian Theodoretus declaring that \"Grace remains entire with every part\". An altar slab dated 357, found in North Africa but now in the Louvre, records the deposit beneath it of relics from several prominent saints. \n\nNon-anatomical relics, above all that of the True Cross, were divided and widely distributed from the 4th century. In the West a decree of Theodosius I only allowed the moving of a whole sarcophagus with its contents, but the upheavals of the barbarian invasions relaxed the rules, as remains needed to be relocated to safer places.\n\nIn the 4th century, Basil the Great requested of the ruler of Scythia Minor, Junius Soranus (Saran), that he should send him the relics of saints of that region. Saran sent the relics of Sabbas the Goth to him in Caesarea, Cappadocia, in 373 or 374 accompanied by a letter, the 'Epistle of the Church of God in Gothia to the Church of God located in Cappadocia and to all the Local Churches of the Holy Universal Church'. The sending of Sabbas' relics and the writing of the actual letter has been attributed to Bretannio. This letter is the oldest known writing to be composed on Romanian soil and was written in Greek.\n\nThe spread of relics all over Europe from the 8th century onward is explained by the fact that after 787, all new Christian churches had to possess a relic before they could be properly consecrated. New churches, situated in areas newly converted to Christianity, needed relics and this encouraged the translation of relics to far-off places. Relics became collectible items, and owning them became a symbol of prestige for cities, kingdoms, and monarchs, Relics were also desirable as they generated income from pilgrims traveling to venerate them. According to one legend concerning Saint Paternian, the inhabitants of Fano competed with those of Cervia for possession of his relics. Cervia would be left with a finger, while Fano would possess the rest of the saint's relics.\n\nThe translation of relics was a solemn and important event. In 1261, the relics of Lucian of Beauvais and his two companions were placed in a new reliquary by William of Grès (Guillaume de Grès), the bishop of Beauvais. The translation took place in the presence of St. Louis IX, the king of France, and Theobald II, the king of Navarre, as well as much of the French nobility. The memory of this translation was formerly celebrated in the abbey of Beauvais as the \"fête des Corps Saints\".\n\nOn February 14, 1277, while work was being done at the church of St. John the Baptist (Johanniterkirche) in Cologne, the body of Saint Cordula, one of the companions of Saint Ursula, was discovered. Her relics were found to be fragrant and on the forehead of the saint herself were written the words, “Cordula, Queen and Virgin.” When Albert the Great, who had been residing in Cologne in his old age, had listened to the account of the finding of the relics, ... he wept, praised God from the depth of his soul, and requested the bystanders to sing the \"Te Deum\". Then vesting himself in his episcopal robes, he removed the relics from under the earth, and solemnly translated them into the church of the monks of St. John. After singing Mass, he deposited the holy body in a suitable place, which God has since made illustrious by many miracles.\nSome relics were translated from place to place, buffeted by the tides of wars and conflicts. The relics of Saint Leocadia were moved from Toledo to Oviedo during the reign of Abd ar-Rahman II, and from Oviedo they were brought to Saint-Ghislain (in present-day Belgium). Her relics were venerated there by Philip the Handsome and Joanna of Castile, who recovered for Toledo a tibia of the saint. Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba attempted unsuccessfully to rescue the rest of her relics. Finally, a Spanish Jesuit, after many travels, brought the rest of the saint’s relics to Rome in 1586. From Rome they were brought to Valencia by sea, and then finally brought to Toledo from Cuenca. Philip II of Spain presided over a solemn ceremony commemorating the final translation of her relics to Toledo, in April 1587.\n\nIdesbald’s relics were moved from their resting-place at the abbey of Ten Duinen after the Geuzen (“Sea Beggars”) plundered the abbey in 1577; his relics were translated again to Bruges in 1796 to avoid having them destroyed by Revolutionary troops.\n\nThe translation of the relics continued into modern times. On December 4, 1796, as a result of the French Revolution, the relics of Saint Lutgardis were carried to Ittre from Awirs. Her relics remain in Ittre.\n\nAmong the most famous translations is that of St Benedict of Nursia, author of the \"Regula S. Benedicti\", from Cassino to Fleury, which Adrevald memorialized. In England, the lengthy travels of St Cuthbert's remains to escape the Vikings, and then his less respectful treatment after the English Reformation, have been much studied, as his coffin, gospel book and other items buried with him are now very rare representatives of Anglo-Saxon art.\n\nSome well-known translations of relics include the removal of the body of Saint Nicholas from Myra in Asia Minor to Bari, Italy in 1087. Tradesmen of Bari visited the relics of Saint Nicholas in 1087 after finding out their resting-place from the monks who guarded them. According to one account, the monks showed the resting-place but then became immediately suspicious: \"Why you men, do you make such a request? You haven't planned to carry off the remains of the holy saint from here? You don't intend to remove it to your own region? If that is your purpose, then let it be clearly known to you that you parley with unyielding men, even if it mean our death.\" The tradesmen tried different tactics, including force, and manage to take hold of the relics. An anonymous chronicler writes about what happened when the inhabitants of Myra found out:\n\nProfessor Nevzat Cevik, the Director of Archaeological Excavations in Demre (Myra), has recently recommended that the Turkish government should request the repatriation of St Nicholas' relics, alleging that it had always been the saint's intention to be buried in Myra. The Venetians, who also claimed to have some parts of St Nicholas, had another story: The Venetians brought the remains back to Venice, but on the way they left an arm of St Nicholas at Bari (The Morosini Codex 49A).\n\nIn 828, Venetian merchants acquired the supposed relics of Saint Mark the Evangelist from Alexandria, Egypt. These are housed in St Mark's Basilica; in 1968, a small fragment of bone was donated to the Coptic Church in Alexandria.\n\nA famous and recent example is the return of the relics of St. John Chrysostom and St. Gregory of Nazianzus to the See of Constantinople (Greek Orthodox Church) by Pope John Paul II in 2007. Another modern example is the exhumation, display, and reburial of the relics of St. Padre Pio in 2008-2009.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3909460", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3909460", "title": "Walter Burley", "text": "Walter Burley\n\nWalter Burley (or Burleigh) (c. 1275–1344/5) was a medieval English scholastic philosopher and logician with at least 50 works attributed to him. He studied under Thomas Wilton and received his Master of Arts degree in 1301, and was a fellow of Merton College, Oxford until about 1310. He then spent sixteen years in Paris, becoming a fellow of the Sorbonne by 1324, before spending 17 years as a clerical courtier in England and Avignon. Burley disagreed with William of Ockham on a number of points concerning logic and natural philosophy.\n\nBurley was born in 1274 or 1275, possibly in Burley-in-Wharfedale, Yorkshire, or in Burley near Leeds. Little is known of his early life. He was made rector of Welbury in Yorkshire in 1309, probably through the influence of Sir John de Lisle, a friend of William Greenfield. As throughout his career, he did not act as rector, employing a substitute and using the income from the living to finance his study in Paris, where he completed his lectures on Peter Lombard's \"Sentences\", and probably encountered the work of his contemporary William of Ockham. Burley's commentary on the \"Sentences\" has not survived.\n\nBurley became a courtier during the political events that followed the deposition of Edward II of England in 1327. His first assignment was to try and obtain the canonisation of Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster, who had been one of the leaders of the baronial opposition to Edward II; Thomas had become venerated as a martyr within a few months of his death. Burley was sent to the papal court at Avignon to appeal directly to Pope John XXII. By coincidence, William of Ockham was also staying at Avignon, having been summoned there in 1324 to answer charges of possibly heretical statements (by 1326 there was a list of 51 charges against him).\n\nBurley's associates were all closely involved in these attempts at canonisation (none of which was successful). One was Richard de Bury, a bibliophile and patron of the arts and sciences, who became Burley's patron and at whose request Bury translated some works of Aristotle into English.\n\nBurley had become a master of theology by 1324. In May 1327 he became canon of Chichester by the provision of the pope, but exchanged the position in 1332 to become canon at Wells, where de Bury was dean. Bury had been involved in the coup d'état of 1330 that resulted in the execution of Mortimer, and the de facto accession of Edward III to the throne. In 1333 de Bury was consecrated Bishop of Durham by the king, over-ruling the choice of the monks, who had elected and actually installed their sub-prior, Robert de Graynes. In February 1334 de Bury was made Lord Treasurer, an appointment he exchanged later in the year for that of Lord Chancellor. He gathered together a group of intellectuals including Thomas Fitzralph, Richard de Kilvington, Robert Holcott, Thomas Bradwardine and Burley himself.\n\nWalter may have been a relative of his younger contemporary Adam Burley.\n\nBurley was one of the first logicians to recognise the priority of the propositional calculus over the predicate calculus, despite the fact that the latter had been the main focus of logicians until then. Burley also seems to have been the only 14th-century logician to have taken the position that, in line with modern views on the material conditional, the principle that \"from the impossible anything follows\" (\"ex impossibili sequitur quidlibet\") is both a necessary and sufficient condition for explaining the logical relationship between antecedent and consequent.\nHe was also known for his commentaries on Aristotle's \"Physics\", which include the quodlibet \"De Primo et ultimo instanti\" (around 1320) and the longer work \"Expositio in libros octo de physico auditu\".\nBurley wrote 39 Commentaries on Aristotle and 32 Treatises and Questions (many unedited) \n\nThis is Burley's main work, in which he covers such topics as the truth conditions for complex sentences, both truth-functional and modal, as well as providing rules of inferences for different types of inferences. This book is known to have been written after Ockham's \"Summa Logicae\" (c. 1323), possibly partly in response to it.\nOther works include:\n\n\n\n"}
