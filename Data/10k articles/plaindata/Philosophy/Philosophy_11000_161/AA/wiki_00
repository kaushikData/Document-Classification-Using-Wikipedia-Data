The political essay is Shelley's longest prose work.\n\nShelley composed \"A Philosophical View of Reform\" between November, 1819 and 20 May 1820, meant to address political developments in England at that time. He advocated non-violence and a moderate response to the repressive measures imposed by the British government. One of the events he addressed was the Peterloo Massacre, which occurred on 16 August 1819, in St. Peter's Field near Manchester, where a peaceful demonstration seeking parliamentary reform was attacked by militia.\n\nThe bookseller Richard Carlile had been found guilty of blasphemy by a jury in November, 1819 for printing an edition of \"The Age of Reason\" (1794-6) by Thomas Paine. The “Six Acts” had been promulgated in December which placed restrictions on public gatherings and freedom of the press.\n\nIt was during this unstable political period in England in late 1819 when Shelley started writing \"A Philosophical View of Reform\". Shelley told John and Maria Gisborne on 6 November: \"I have deserted the odorous gardens of literature to journey across the great sandy desert of Politics.\"\n\nShelley proposed five reforms:\n\n\nShelley opposed revolution, advocating instead gradual change through non-violence. He argued that individual and institutional reform went hand in hand. He maintained that poets, writers, and philosophers would stimulate reforms of the social institutions that would benefit everyone in society.\n\nShelley informed his publisher Charles Ollier on 19 December 1819 that he sought \"A Philosophical View of Reform\" \"to be an instructive and readable book, appealing from the passions to the reason of men\", informing him that he would not finish it \"this season\".\n\nOn 26 May 1820 he asked Leigh Hunt if he could find a publisher for the work: \"Do you know any bookseller who wd publish for me an octavo volume entitled 'A philosophical View of Reform'. It is boldly but temperately written – & I think readable – It is intended for a kind of standard book for the philosophical reformers.\"\n\nMary Shelley had a transcript made of the manuscript with plans to publish the work. The political essay remained unpublished, however, until 1920 when it appeared for the first time in print in an edition published by Humphrey Milford, Oxford University Press, with an introduction and appendix by Thomas William Rolleston.\n\n\n"}

According to traditional sources, he is the first figure in the wider Muslim world to be associated with philosophy after the advent of Islam.\n\nHe was born in Nishapur (modern Khorasan in Iran), the city also known as Iranshahr, hence his title Iranshahri. According to Nasir Khusraw, Iranshahri taught Rhazes and Biruni ancient Iranian philosophy.\n\nAccording to Al-Biruni his rare impartiality is rooted in his lack of dependence on a particular religion. he created a religion and invited others to that.\n\nHe authored several books and treatises in Arabic and in Persian. All the books written, some of which are mentioned in passing by Biruni and Nasir Khusraw, have been lost.\n\nHe wrote three books; \"Jalil\", \"Athir\", and \"Masael u'ttabi'a\", about philosophy and wisdom. Abulma'ali states that Iranshahri brought a new religion with a Persian book and named his miracle \"Hasti\" (existence). According to Biruni, he was knowledgeable about Christianity, Zoroastrianism, Manichaeism, Hinduism, and Shamanism.\n\nAccording to Abu'l Ma'ali, the author of bayan al-Adyan, Iranshahri considered himself a Prophet and wrote a book in Persian which he claimed have received a divine revelation by the angel called Hasti (Existence). He believed in the unity of all religions and considered existing differences among them the results of special interests (ḡarażµ) of their followers. According to Biruni, Iranshahri had said that God took covenant from light and darkness on the days of Nowruz and Mehragan, which may reflect Zurvanite influence. According to Nasir Khusraw, Iranshahri had expressed philosophical concepts in religious terms in such books as Ketab-e jalil and Ketab-e athir, and had led people to the true religion and the understanding of monotheism.\n\nHe maintained that God was always a creator, and there was not a time when he was non-creative (u-rā ṣonʿ nabud) before He turned into being creative. According to him, it is requisite that He always be creator, then it is necessary for that in which His creation appeared to be eternal (qadim). His creation makes its appearance (padid-āyanda ast) in Matter (hayulā), and therefore, Matter, a sign of the apparent power of God, is eternal; and since Matter, which is eternal, requires the existence of Space (makān), it follows that Space should be eternal too. His ideas on time were that time, world, and duration (zamān dahr wa moddat) are names whose meanings are derived from the same substance (jawhar). He also philosophized that Time, a substance in motion and restless (jawhar-e ravanda wa biqarār), is the sign of God's knowledge, in the same way that Space is the sign of His power; motion is the sign of His action, and the being (jesm) is the sign of His ability, and every one of these signs is infinite and eternal.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7790479", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7790479", "title": "Al-Shahrastani", "text": "Al-Shahrastani\n\nTāj al-Dīn Abū al-Fath Muhammad ibn `Abd al-Karīm ash-Shahrastānī (1086–1153 CE), also known as Muhammad al-Shahrastānī, was an influential Persian historian of religions, a historiographer, Islamic scholar, philosopher and theologian. His book, \"Kitab al–Milal wa al-Nihal\" (lit. \"The Book of Sects and Creeds\") was one of the pioneers in developing an objective and philosophical approach to the study of religions.\n\nVery few things are known about al-Shahrastānī's life. He was born in 1086 CE A.H., in the town of Shahristān, (Khorasan, province of Persia) where he acquired his early traditional education. Later, he was sent to Nīshāpūr where he studied under different masters who were all disciples of the Ash`ari theologian al-Juwaynī (d. 1085). At the age of thirty, al-Shahrastānī went to Baghdad to pursue theological studies and taught for three years at the prestigious Ash`ari school, al-Nizāmiyya. Afterwards, he returned to Persia where he worked as \"Nā’ib\" (Deputy) of the chancellery for Sanjar, the Saljūq ruler of Khurāsān. At the end of his life, al-Shahrastānī went back to live in his native town, where he died in the year 1153.\n\nAl-Shahrastani distinguished himself by his desire to describe in the most objective way the universal religious history of humanity.\n\nThis is reflected in his \"Kitab al-Milal wa al-Nihal\" (The Book of Sects and Creeds), a monumental work, which presents the doctrinal points of view of all the religions and philosophies which existed up to his time. The book was one of the earliest systematic studies of religion, and is noted for its non-polemical style and scientific approach. A French translation of the book by Gimaret, Monnot and Jolivet was sponsored by UNESCO (\"Livre des religions et des sectes.\" Peeters: 1986, 1993).\n\nAl-Shahrastani's philosophical and theological thoughts manifested in his other major works, which include:\n\n\nAl-Shahrastani's own beliefs are difficult to categorize because he juggled many different philosophical and theological vocabularies. He was a clever thinker, demonstrated by the intricacies of many traditions and the Shi`ite notion of the 'Guide' (\"Imam\") found in his thoughts. Al-Shahrastani had many reasons to speak somewhat allegorically. He was a very subtle author who often spoke indirectly by means of symbols. He preferred his own personal vocabulary to the traditional one. For this reason, his position is hard to determine. It may well be that ideological considerations led him to speak indirectly; he perhaps assumed those familiar with the symbols would be able to unravel his elusive ideas. For all these reasons, many scholars who have studied al-Shahrastani were misled concerning his religious identity.\n\nThough al-Shahrastani is generally regarded as an Sunni-Ash'ari theologian, he had been accused by his contemporaries, al-Khwarazmi and al-Sam'ani, of being drawn to the \"people of the mountain fortresses\", i.e. the Nizari Isma'ilis of Alamut \"(See: Hassan-i Sabbah and the Hashshashin)\". This view is supported by modern scholars, such as Muhammad Ridā Jalālī Nā’īnī, Muhammad Taqī Dānish-Pazhūh, Wilferd Madelung, Jean Jolivet, Guy Monnot, and Diana Steigerwald who characterize his works as belonging to the Isma'ili tradition, while attributing his public Ash'arism and Shafi'ism to the practice of \"taqiyya\" (religious dissimulation), since Ismā`īlis were persecuted during that time.\n\nAs opposed to Ash'arites, al-Shahrastani presents a gradation in the creation (\"khalq\"). He gives a definition of the Prophetic Impeccability (\"`Isma\") opposed to the Ash`arite tradition, maintaining that it subsists in the Prophet as part of his real nature. As did al-Ghazzali, al-Shahrastani harshly criticizes Avicenna's Necessary Being who knows the universal but not the particular. Al-Shahrastani, particularly in the \"Musara`a al-Falasifa\", has an Isma'ili conception of the Originator (\"Mubdi`\") beyond Being and non-Being. He argues convincingly for the existence of Divine Attributes, but he does not ascribe them directly to God. True worship means \"Tawhid\" - declaring the Unicity of God. This includes the negation of all attributes which humans give to God, the Ultimate One who is totally transcendent. God is Unknowable, Indefinable, Unattainable, and above human comprehension.\n\nAs for the theory of creation, in the \"Nihaya\", al-Shahrastani insists that God is the only Creator and the only Agent. He also develops a different interpretation of ex-nihilo creation which does not mean creation out of nothing, but creation made only by God. In the \"Majlis\" and the \"Mafatih al-Asrar\", the angels play a dominant role in the physical creation. His theory of the Divine Word (\"Kalima\") has a convincing Isma'ili imprint; for example, his hierarchy of angels and Divine Words (\"Kalimat\" ) are conceived as being the causes of spiritual beings. Al-Shahrastani in the \"Nihaya\" writes:\n\n\"... his [Divine] Command (\"Amr\") is pre-existent and his multiple \"Kalimat\" are eternal. By his Command, \"Kalimat\" become the manifestation of it. Spiritual beings are the manifestation of \"Kalimat\" and bodies are the manifestation of spiritual beings. The \"Ibda`\" (Origination beyond time and space) and \"khalq\" (physical creation) become manifested [respectively in] spiritual beings and bodies. As for \"Kalimat\" and letters (\"huruf\"), they are eternal and pre-existent. Since his Command is not similar to our command, his \"Kalimat\" and his letters are not similar to our \"Kalimat\". Since letters are elements of \"Kalimat\" which are the causes of spiritual beings who govern corporeal beings; all existence subsists in the \"Kalimat\" Allah preserved in his Command.\"\n\nIn the \"Majlis\", al-Shahrastani divides the creation into two worlds – the spiritual world (i.e. the world of the Origination of spirits (\"Ibda'-i arwah\")) in an achieved (\"mafrugh\") state and the world of physical creation (\"khalq\") in becoming (\"musta'naf\"). He shares an Isma`ili cosmology in which God has built his religion in the image of creation.\n\nThe conception of Prophecy developed in the \"Nihaya\" is closer to that of Isma`ilis and Falasifa (Islamic philosophers) than to Ash`arites, because al-Shahrastani establishes a logical link between miracles and Prophetic Impeccability (\"`Isma\"). For al-Shahrastani, the proof of veracity (\"sidq\") of the Prophet is intrinsic to his nature and is related to his Impeccability. He develops the concept of cyclical time explicitly in the \"Milal\", the \"Majlis\", and the \"Mafatih\" and implicitly in the \"Nihaya\". In the \"Majlis\", his understanding of the dynamic evolution of humanity is similar to Isma`ilism, in which each Prophet opens a new cycle. Al-Shahrastani recovers the mythical Qur'anic story of Moses and the Servant of God inspired by \"Al-Risala al-Mudhhiba\" of al-Qadi al-Nu'man (d. 974).\n\nAl-Shahrastani was an able and learned man of great personal charm. The real nature of his thought is best referred to by the term theosophy, in the older sense of \"divine wisdom\". However, al-Shahrastani was certainly not totally against theology or philosophy, even if he was very harsh against the theologians and the philosophers. As he explained in the \"Majlis\", in order to remain on the right path, one must preserve a perfect equilibrium between intellect (\"`aql\") and audition (\"sam`\"). A philosopher or a theologian must use his intellect until he reaches the rational limit. Beyond this limit, he must listen to the teaching of Prophets and Imams.\n\nHis works reflect a complex interweaving of intellectual strands, and his thought is a synthesis of this fruitful historical period. In his conception of God, Creation, Prophecy, and \"Imama\", al Shahrastani adopted many doctrinal elements that are reconcilable with Nizari Isma'ilism. The necessity of a Guide, belonging both to the spiritual and the physical world, is primordial in his scheme since the \"Imam\" is manifested in this physical world.\n\nIn \"Kitab al-Milal wa al-Nihal\", al-Shahrastani records a portrayal of Christianity very close to the orthodox tenets while continuing the Islamic narrative:\n\n“The Christians. (They are) the community (\"umma\") of the Christ, Jesus, son of Mary (peace upon him). He it is who was truly sent (as prophet; \"mab'uth\") after Moses (peace upon him), and who was announced in the Torah. To him were (granted) manifest signs and notable evidences, such as the reviving of the dead and the curing of the blind and the leper. His very nature and innate disposition (\"fitra\") are a perfect sign of his truthfulness; that is, his coming without previous seed and his speaking without prior teaching. For all the (other) prophets the arrival of their revelation was at (the age of) forty years, but revelation came to him when he was made to speak in the cradle, and revelation came to him when he conveyed (the divine message) at (the age of) thirty. The duration of his (prophetic) mission (\"da'wa\") was three years and three months and three days.”\n\nAl-Shahrastani also explains the differences between Christians in \"Kitab al-Milal wa al-Nihal\" regarding the incarnation (\"tajassud\"):\n\n“They affirmed that God has three hypostases (\"aqanim\"). They said that the Creator (may he be exalted) is one substance (\"jawhar\"), meaning by this what is self-subsistent (\"al-qa'im bi-n-nafs\"), not (what is characterized by) spatial location and physical magnitude; and he is one in substantiality, three in hypostaticity (\"uqnumiyya\"). By the hypostases they mean the attributes (\"sifat\"), such as existence, life and knowledge, and the father, the son and the holy spirit (\"ruh al-qudus\"). The (hypostasis of) knowledge clothes itself and was incarnated, but not the other hypostases.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "40021348", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40021348", "title": "Andrew David Irvine", "text": "Andrew David Irvine\n\nAndrew David Irvine (born July 14, 1958) is a Canadian academic who teaches at the University of British Columbia. He holds a PhD in philosophy from Sydney University and is a professor of philosophy and mathematics at UBC Okanagan. He is a past vice-chair of the \nUBC Board of Governors, a past head of the Department of Economics, Philosophy and Political Science, a past president of the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association, and a member of the board of directors of the Society for Academic Freedom and Scholarship. An advocate of traditional democratic civil liberties, Irvine has written about the importance of the rule of law for both modern and ancient democracies. He has held visiting positions at several Canadian and American universities and has been recognized as one of British Columbia's most influential public intellectuals.\n\nOften cited for his work on the twentieth-century philosopher Bertrand Russell, Irvine has argued in favour of physicalism and against several commonly held views in the history of modern philosophy, including the claim that Gottlob Frege succeeded in developing a workable theory of mathematical platonism and the claim that Bertrand Russell was an advocate of epistemic logicism, a claim that one commentator has concluded is now \"thoroughly debunked.\"\n\nHe has defended a two-box solution to Newcomb's problem in which he abandons \"the (false) assumption that past observed frequency is an infallible guide to probability\" and a non-cognitivist solution to the liar paradox, noting that \"formal criteria alone will inevitably prove insufficient\" for determining whether individual sentence tokens have meaning.\n\nIn modal logic (which studies theories of possibility and necessity), he has argued in favour of the non-normal system S7, rather than more traditional systems such as S4 or S5. Unlike other systems, S7 allows logicians to choose between competing logics, each of which, if true, would be necessarily true, but none of which are necessarily the correct system of necessary truths. As Irvine puts it, \"just as being \"physically possible\" means nothing more than being consistent with the laws of physics, being \"logically possible\" means nothing more than being consistent with the laws of logic. However, this leaves open the question of which logic and which consistency relation are to be adopted. S7 gives us the language to discuss the possible denial of necessary truths. S7 gives us the language to assert not only that some propositions really are necessary; it gives us the language also to note that their denials, although impossible, remain possibly possible.\" In other words, there is a mechanism in which even sets of necessary truths can be compared to their alternatives.\n\nAn advocate of traditional democratic civil liberties, Irvine has argued in favour of free speech rights, both for political reasons and in the context of defending academic freedom.\n\nTogether with Stephen Wexler, he has argued that modern constitutional protections of the rule of law can trace their roots as far back as Socrates' demand that even lawmakers must be bound by the law. It was this demand that led to Aristotle's distinction between \"psephismata\" (votes of the assembly) and \"nomos\" (statute law), and to the resulting debate over how best to decide questions of legal supremacy within a democracy. Together with Jason Gratl, he has argued that, in its modern form, the rule of law helps resolve tensions between national security and public accountability and, together with John Whyte, he has argued that care needs to be taken with regard to electoral reform, especially when it comes to implementing proposals focusing on proportional representation. He is often cited in the media on issues ranging from free speech and academic freedom to parliamentary procedure and judicial activism.\n\nIn 2007 Irvine premiered \"Socrates on Trial\", a play depicting the life and death of the ancient Greek philosopher Socrates. The play tells the story of how Socrates was put on trial for corrupting the youth of Athens and for failing to honour the city's gods. The play contains adaptations of several classic Greek works including the slapstick comedy \"Clouds\", written by Aristophanes and first performed in 423 BCE, and the dramatic monologue \"Apology\", written by Plato to record the defence speech Socrates gave at his trial in 399 BCE. The premiere was directed by Joan Bryans of Vital Spark Theatre Company at the Chan Centre for the Performing Arts in Vancouver.\n\nIn the words of one reviewer, \"The play is refreshingly illuminating on the relationship between Socrates' execution and the lasting influence of Aristophanes' negative depiction of him on the evolution of the Athenian psyche.\" According to another, the play not only gives an entertaining portrayal of Plato's famous mentor, but also a fascinating introduction to the \"pompous, arrogant and often petulant\" individual presented by Aristophanes, giving modern audiences a greater understanding of why Socrates eventually ended up being sentenced to death.\n\nIn 1999, Irvine produced scholarly bibliographies of both the primary and secondary literature surrounding the Nobel Laureate Bertrand Russell. Together with Dawn Ogden, he also produced the first bibliographical index for Russell's influential book, \"A History of Western Philosophy.\" The index is based on the second British edition (of 1979). A conversion table gives page references for both the first American edition (of 1945) and the first British edition (of 1946).\n\nTogether with Edmond Rivère, Irvine is the author of the first comprehensive, scholarly bibliography of Canada's premier literary prize, the Governor General's Literary Awards. The bibliography covers the history of the awards from their inception in 1936 through to the end of 2013 and appeared in \"Papers of the Bibliographical Society of Canada\" in 2014.\n\nIn 1994, Irvine served as inspiration for the character Hardy Orbs in the dystopian novel, \"Fair New World\". The novel was written by Lou Marinoff under the pseudonym Lou Tafler. A twentieth-anniversary re-issue in 2014 contained a foreword purportedly written by Orbs.\n\n\n"}

It occurs in all industrialised egg production whether free range, organic, or battery cage—including that of the UK and US. Because male chickens do not lay eggs and only those on breeding programmes are required to fertilise eggs, they are considered redundant to the egg-laying industries and are usually killed shortly after being sexed, which occurs after they hatch. Many methods of culling do not involve anaesthetics and include cervical dislocation, asphyxiation by carbon dioxide and maceration using a high speed grinder. Asphyxiation is the primary method in the United Kingdom, while maceration is the primary method in the United States. By 2020, US producers expect to sex the eggs before they hatch, so male eggs can be culled.\n\nDue to modern selective breeding, laying hen strains differ from meat production strains (broilers). In the United States, males are culled in egg production, since males \"don’t lay eggs or grow large enough to become broilers\".\n\nChicks are also culled in the production of foie gras. However, because males put on more weight than females in this production system, the females are culled.\n\nPrior to the development of modern broiler meat breeds, most male chickens (cockerels) were slaughtered for meat, whereas females (pullets) would be kept for egg production. However, once the industry bred separate meat and egg-producing hybrids, there was no reason to keep males of the egg-producing hybrid. As a consequence, the males of egg-laying chickens are killed as soon as possible after hatching and sexing to reduce losses incurred by the breeder. Special techniques have been developed to accurately determine the sex of chicks at as young an age as possible.\n\nAs of 2018, worldwide around 7 billion day-old male chicks were culled per year in the egg industry.\n\nChicks are also culled in the production of foie gras. After hatching, the ducklings are sexed. Males put on more weight than females, so the females are killed, sometimes in an industrial macerator. Up to 40 million female ducks per year may be killed in this way. The remains of female ducklings are later used in cat food, fertilisers and in the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nSeveral methods are used to cull chicks:\n\nThe American Veterinary Medical Association recommends cervical dislocation, maceration, and asphyxiation by carbon dioxide as the better options. The 2005-2006 American Veterinary Medical Association Executive Board proposed a policy change, which was recommended by the Animal Welfare Committee on disposal of unwanted chicks, poults, and pipped eggs. The policy states \"Unwanted chicks, poults, and pipped eggs should be killed by an acceptable humane method, such as use of a commercially designed macerator that results in instantaneous death. Smothering unwanted chicks or poults in bags or containers is not acceptable. Pips, unwanted chicks, or poults should be killed prior to disposal. A pipped egg, or pip, is one where the chick or poult has not been successful in escaping the egg shell during the hatching process.\"\n\nAnimal welfare advocates maintain that many of the current practices surrounding chicken slaughtering are unethical. Animal rights advocates maintain that it is unethical to unnecessarily exploit and kill other sentient beings for food production, including chicks. \n\nA Unilever spokesperson has been quoted as saying \"We have also committed to providing funding and expertise for research and introduction of alternative methods such as in-ovo gender identification (sexing) of eggs. This new technology offers the potential to eliminate the hatching and culling of male chicks.\"\n\n\n"}

The events that cause these species to originally separate from each other over distant areas may still allow both of the species to have equal chances of surviving, reproducing, and even evolving to better suit their environments while still being two distinct species due to subsequent natural selection, mutations and genetic drift.\n\nCladogenesis is in contrast to anagenesis, in which an ancestral species gradually accumulates change, and eventually, when enough is accumulated, the species is sufficiently distinct and different enough from its original starting form that it can be labeled as a new form - a new species. Note that with anagenesis the lineage in a phylogenetic tree does not split.\n\nTo determine whether a speciation event is cladogenesis or anagenesis, researchers may use simulation, evidence from fossils, molecular evidence from the DNA of different living species, or modelling. It has however been debated whether the distinction between cladogenesis and anagenesis is necessary at all in evolutionary theory.\n\n"}

The bank has offices in Oslo and has total assets of NOK 657 million (2014).\n\nCultura's roots date back to an initiative from 1982 from a group of Norwegian anthroposophists including Sophus Clausen and economics professor Leif Holbæk-Hanssen, that sought to establish an ethical bank. In 1986, \"Cultura Lånesamvirke\" was established, and in 1997, Cultura was granted a full banking license as a savings bank. Cultura is inspired by GLS bank, the leading anthroposophical ethical bank in Germany.\n\nCultura Bank's mission is to promote projects with a social and ethical quality.

Another large area is education where the bank finances primary and secondary schools as well as university level institutions. Medicine and healthcare is a third large area in the loan portfolio.

The bank is also active in the public debate, offering information about alternatives to mainstream economic thought.\n\nIn 2003 the bank co-funded the foundation MicroInvest to provide microcredits. Since 2005 the bank has acted as the operational arm of MicroInvest, and cooperation has further deepened since 2006 when the bank and MicroInvest jointly became eligible for the guarantee facility of the European Investment Fund. From 2009 the activities of MicroInvest is merged into and continued by Cultura Bank’s own Guarantee Fund (CGF) acting in its capacity as an independent trust.\n\nCultura Bank is looking to expand further and meet the growing demand for ethical banking products. The bank will take on larger projects, not least where the financing of real estate for schools and agriculture is concerned. Cultura Bank has also, since the start up of the bank, been active in the area of small business loans in general. The idea is to assist in the process of establishing local business initiatives, especially to promote the sustainability of local communities. Cultura Bank is looking to further expand its microfinance activities, both with NCN-members and the bank’s own clients.\n\nThe bank can trace its roots back to 1986 when Cultura Lånesamvirke was established to promote ethical banking. Through the 1980s and 1990s the bank has merged with a number of domestic lending foundations and funds and was in 1997 made a savings bank.\n\nThe bank has issued grunnfondsbevis, but is one of two savings banks in Norway who haven't listed them on Oslo Stock Exchange.\n\n"}

{"id": "2074357", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2074357", "title": "Discontinuity (Postmodernism)", "text": "Discontinuity (Postmodernism)\n\nFor Michel Foucault (1926–84), discontinuity and continuity reflect the flow of history and the fact that some \"things are no longer perceived, described, expressed, characterised, classified, and known in the same way\" from one era to the next. (1994).\n\nIn developing the theory of \"archaeology of knowledge\", Foucault was trying to analyse the fundamental codes which a culture uses to construct the \"episteme\" or configuration of knowledge that determines the empirical orders and social practices of each particular historical era. He adopted discontinuity as a positive working tool. Some of the discourse would be regular and continuous over time as knowledge steadily accumulates and society gradually establishes what will constitute truth or reason for the time being. But, in a transition from one era to the next, there will be overlaps, breaks and discontinuities as society reconfigures the discourse to match the new environment. \n\nThe tool is given an expanded role in \"genealogy\", the next phase of discourse analysis, where the intention is to grasp the total complexity of the use of power and the effects it produces. Foucault sees power as the means for constituting individuals’ identities and determining the limits of their autonomy. This reflects the symbiotic relationship between \"power\" (\"pouvoir\") and \"knowledge\" (\"savoir\"). In his study of prisons and hospitals, he observed how the modern individual becomes both an object and subject of knowledge. Science emerges as a means of directing and shaping lives. Hence, the modern conception of sexuality emerges from Christian codes of morality, the science of psychology, the laws and enforcement strategies adopted by the police and judiciary, the way in which issues of sexuality are discussed in the public media, the education system, etc. These are covert forms of domination (if not oppression), and their influence is to be found not only in what is said, but more importantly, in what is not said: in all the silences and lacunae, in all the discontinuities. If one idea is discussed, then it is not discussed, whose interest is served by this change?\n\n"}

In everyday life, inklings induce detection either via human enactments (through habitual behavior) or through spontaneous devotion (conscious expression in the arts).\n\nThe term episteme is related to the Greek word επιστήμη, which translates literally as \"standing near or by that which causes\" but is often simplified as \"knowledge\" or \"science\". By ignoring ego interests the core impetus or the essence of a deed, real or imagined, is recovered.\n\nEpisteme psychology began with the 1940s written works of Gaston Bachelard, whose many books focused on poetics and (day-) dreaming. Episteme psychology was established as a separate discipline in the late 1980s through the work of v.d. Stok v. Altenæ.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2020264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2020264", "title": "Frustration of purpose", "text": "Frustration of purpose\n\nFrustration of purpose, in law, is a defense to enforcement of a contract. Frustration of purpose occurs when an unforeseen event undermines a party's principal purpose for entering into a contract such that the performance of the contract is radically different from performance of the contract that was originally contemplated by both parties, and both parties knew of the principal purpose at the time the contract was made. Despite frequently arising as a result of government action, any third party or even nature can frustrate a contracting party's primary purpose for entering into the contract. The concept is also called commercial frustration.\n\nFor example, if Joe gets a mortgage for a new home, suppose after three years, the home is destroyed, through no fault of Joe's. Without a hell or high water clause, Joe might be exempt from the remainder of the mortgage, as the principal purpose of the contract, to have a home to live in, has been compromised. However, he might still have a foreclosure on his credit rating.\n\nFrustration of purpose is often confused with the closely related doctrine of impossibility. The distinction is that impossibility concerns the duties specified in the contract, but frustration of purpose concerns the reason a party entered into the contract. An example is if entrepreneur Emily leases space from landlord Larry so that she can open a restaurant that serves only Tibetan Speckled Lizard meat. If the city rezones the property to forbid commercial uses or if the property is destroyed by a tornado, both Larry and Emily are excused from performing the contract by impossibility.\n\nHowever, if the Tibetan Speckled Lizard suddenly goes extinct, Emily may be excused from performing the contract because Larry knew her primary purpose for entering into the lease was to serve Tibetan Speckled Lizard, and the purpose has been frustrated. In the second scenario, the parties could still carry out their obligations under the lease, but one of them no longer has a reason to.\n\nThe \"Restatement (Second) of Contracts\", Section 265, defines frustration of purpose:\nA circumstance is not deemed to be a \"basic assumption on which the contract is made\" unless the change in circumstances could not have been reasonably foreseen at the time the contract was made. As a result, it is rarely invoked successfully. Successful invocations usually come in waves during times of substantial tumult, such as after the passage of Prohibition, when bars and taverns no longer had a reason for their leases, or during major wars, when demand for many consumer goods and services drops far below what is normal.\n\nIf the defense is successfully invoked, the contract is terminated, and the parties are left as they are at the time of the litigation.\n\nThe English case of \"Taylor v Caldwell\" established the doctrine of frustration, alleviating the potential harshness of \"sanctity of contract\". Here, two parties contracted on the hire of a music hall, for the performance of concerts. Subsequent to contracting, but prior to the dates of hire, the music hall burned down. Since the contract was impossible to perform, Judge Blackburn held that the absolute liability set forth in \"Paradine v Jane\" would not apply here, as there was an implied term that the music hall would be in existence at the date of the planned concerts. \n\nThe requirement of \"impossibility\" in \"Taylor v Caldwell\" was modified in the 1903 case of \"Krell v Henry\", which concerned a party who had rented a room for the purpose of watching the coronation procession of Edward VII. The king fell ill and the coronation was indefinitely postponed. The hirer refused to pay for the room, so the owner sued for breach of contract; and the hirer then countersued for the return of his £25 deposit. The court determined that the cancellation of the coronation was unforeseeable by the parties, and discharged the contract, leaving the parties as they were: the hirer lost his one-third deposit, and the owner lost the rest of the rent. The court reasoned that the doctrine of \"impossibility\" could not be applied in this case because it was technically been possible for the hirer to take possession of the flat and sit on the balcony. However, the owner knew the only reason the hirer would want to rent the flat was to watch the procession; had the hirer actually gone to the flat and sat on the balcony, he would have seen nothing of interest. Thus the purpose of the contract had been frustrated by an outside event (the King's illness and consequent cancellation of the parade), justifying termination (but not rescission) of the contract.\n"}

He studied the Seven Liberal Arts and theology at the University of Saragossa, where he acquired a master's degree. Also during this period of time, all along with another friend, Lax fatally wounded another student by hitting his head.. He later moved to Paris, and there he taught in 1507–1508 at the Collège de Calvi and then at the Collège de Montaigu, where he was a student of John Mair (or Major) and simultaneously was a teacher himself. In Paris he was known as the \"Prince of Sophists,\" and his works and lessons were very praised. He taught in Paris until 1516, and then returned to Spain. Some researchers think there was an attempt by some of king Charles V's servants to appoint him University of Zaragoza's High Master, just as they had tried to appoint Erasmus as High Chancellor of the same University during the same months. In the end this was not possible, and he was appointed as a teacher in the University of Huesca, that same year. There he taught until 1520, when he became University of Saragosa's High Master (similar to a dean), vice-chancellor and rector, and also was simultaneously one of the four Masters of Arts, a position very similar to Arts faculty's professor in other Universities. There he had his brilliant nephew Michael Servetus as a student in the same University, who also became in 1525 one of the four Masters of Arts. During this period of time Lax, who had erasmian friends, permitted that Erasmus's works would be read and taught in the University. In 1527 apparently Lax attacked his nephew and colleague Michael Servetus in a violent brawl of which no other details are known, but that got Servetus expelled. The most probable causes of this clash is that Servetus would have started talking of his \"heretic\" theological ideas, or that Lax had silenced Servetus's probable collaboration in his work \"Quaestiones phyisicales\", which just 11 days before had started to get in print.. Lax kept being University of Saragossa's High master, teaching Arts, until his death in 1560, blind and with gout in his hands. \n\n\n"}

He was a Roman Catholic priest, social and political activist, political thinker, historian, philosopher, and polymath.\n\nHugo Kołłątaj was born 1 April 1750 in Dederkały Wielkie (now in Western Ukraine) in Volhynia into a family of minor Polish nobility. Soon after, his family moved to Nieciesławice, near Sandomierz, where he spent his childhood. He attended school in Pińczów. He began his studies at the Kraków Academy, subsequently, Jagiellonian University, where he studied law and gained a doctorate. Afterwards, around 1775 he took holy orders. He studied in Vienna and Italy (Naples and Rome), where he would have encountered Enlightenment philosophy. He is thought to have gained two further doctorates abroad in philosophy and theology.\n\nReturning to Poland, he became a canon of Kraków, and parish priest of Krzyżanowice Dolne and Tuczępy. He was active in the Commission of National Education and the Society for Elementary Books, where he took a prominent role in the development of the national network of schools. He spent two years in Warsaw, but returned to Kraków where he reformed the Kraków Academy, on whose board he sat from 1777, and whose rector he was between 1783-1786. The reform of the Academy was very substantial. It established innovative standards. Notably, he substituted Polish for Latin which till then was used for lectures. The removal of Latin in favour of a national language in higher education was then still uncommon in Europe. The reform proved so controversial that his political enemies plotted successfully to have him temporarily removed from Kraków in 1781, on grounds of corruption and immorality. Although in 1782 the decision was rescinded.\n\nKołłątaj was also active politically. In 1786 he assumed the office of the Referendary of Lithuania, and moved to Warsaw. He became prominent in the reform movement, heading an informal group that was on the radical wing of the Patriotic Party, and labelled by their political enemies as \"Kołłątaj's Forge\". As leader of the Patriotic Party during the Great Sejm, he set out its programme in his \"Several Anonymous Letters to Stanisław Małachowski\" (1788–1789) and in his essay, \"The Political Law of the Polish Nation\" (1790). In his works he advocated a republican-tinged constitutional reform and the need for other social reforms. Among the goals he pursued were the strengthening of the king's constitutional position, a larger national army, abolition of the liberum veto, the introduction of universal taxation, and the emancipation of both townspeople and the peasantry. An organizer of the townspeople's movement, he edited a text that demanded reform and which was delivered to the king during the Black Procession of 1789.\n\nKołłątaj co-authored the Constitution of 3 May 1791. He also founded the Friends of the Constitution to assist in the document's implementation. In 1786 he received the Order of Saint Stanislaus and in 1791, the Order of the White Eagle. In 1791-92 he served as Crown Vice Chancellor (Podkanclerzy Koronny).\n\nDuring the Polish-Russian war that broke out over the 3 May Constitution, Kołłątaj, along with other royal advisers, persuaded King Stanisław August, himself a co-author of the Constitution, to seek a compromise with their opponents and to join the Targowica Confederation that had been formed to bring down the Constitution. However, in 1792, when the Confederates' won, Kołłątaj emigrated to Leipzig and Dresden, where in 1793 he wrote, with Ignacy Potocki, an essay entitled, \"On the Adoption and Fall of the Polish May 3 Constitution\".\n\nIn exile, his political views became more radical and he became involved with the preparation for an insurrection. In 1794 he took part in the Kościuszko Uprising, contributing to its \"Uprising Act\" on 24 March 1794 and to the Połaniec Manifesto on 7 May 1794. He headed the Supreme National Council's Treasury Department, and backing the Uprising's wing of Polish Jacobins. After the suppression of the Uprising in the same year, Kołłątaj was imprisoned by the Austrians until 1802. In 1805, with Tadeusz Czacki, he organized the Krzemieniec Lyceum in Volhynia. In 1807, after the creation of the Duchy of Warsaw, he was initially involved in its government, but was soon excluded from it through the intrigues of political opponents, and soon afterwards, was interned and imprisoned by the Russian authorities until 1808. On his release he found himself barred from public office. Despite that he sought to present a programme for rebuilding and developing Poland in his \"Remarks on the Present Position of That Part of the Polish Lands that, since the Treaty of Tilsit, have come to be called the Duchy of Warsaw\", (1809). In 1809 he became a member of the Warsaw Society of Friends of Learning. In the years 1809-1810 he was once again involved with the Kraków Academy, bringing it back from its temporarily Germanized form.\nIn his \"The Physico-Moral Order\" (1811), Kołłątaj sought to create a socio-ethical system emphasizing the equality of all people, based on the physiocratic idea of a \"physico-moral order\". Steeped in the natural sciences, geology and mineralogy in particular, he went on to write \"A Critical Analysis of Historical Principles regarding the Origins of Humankind\", published posthumously in 1842. In this work he put forward the first Polish presentation of ideas of social evolution based on geological concepts. This work is also seen as an important contribution to cultural anthropology. In \"The State of Education in Poland in the Final Years of the Reign of Augustus III\", published posthumously in 1841, he argued against the Jesuit domination of education and presented a study of the history of education.\n\nHe died on 28 February 1812,\"forgotten and abandoned\" by his contemporaries. He was buried in the Powązki Cemetery.\n\nDespite his lonely death, Kołłątaj became an influence on many subsequent reformers and is now recognised as one of the key figures of the Enlightenment in Poland, and \"one of the greatest minds of his epoch\". He is one of the figures immortalized in Jan Matejko's 1891 painting, \"Constitution of May 3, 1791.\"\n\nSeveral learned institutions in Poland are named in Hugo Kołłątaj's honour, including the Agricultural University of Cracow of which he was co-founder and patron.\n\n\n"}

His father, Ludvik was a retired officer of the Austro-Hungarian Army. Milan spent his childhood in Ljubljana and Škofja Loka, and in 1939 he enrolled in the University of Ljubljana where he studied law. He specialized in Canonical law and continued his studies at the University of Turin, where he graduated in 1942. He first developed an interest in philosophy in Ljubljana, under the supervision of the Slovenian Neo-thomist thinker Aleš Ušeničnik and the Russian émigré Eugeni Vasilievitch Spektorsky (1875-1951), who thought philosophy of law at the University of Ljubljana. He further developed his philosophical knowledge in Turin under the influence of Giuseppe Gemellaro and Carlo Mazzantini. In those years, he also discovered the thought of French personalists such as Jacques Maritain and Emmanuel Mounier. He was also influenced by the political writings of Luigi Sturzo which were then circulating in the Catholic anti-Fascist underground.\n\nAlready as a student in Ljubljana, he became involved in a Catholic integralist youth group, organized within the Slovenian Catholic Action. This group, called \"Borci\" (\"Fighters\", after their internal journal, \"Mi mladi borci\", that is \"We, young fighters\") had an anti-Communist ideology. To them, Communism was the greatest danger to humanity; nevertheless, they insisted to fight it on a cultural, intellectual and artistic field, rejecting both direct political engagement and armed struggle.\n\nAfter the Capitulation of Italy in September 1943, Komar returned to Slovenia, which was then occupied by Nazi Germany. In the Slovenian Littoral, he joined the Slovenian National Defense Corps (\"Slovenski narodno varstveni zbor\" – SNVZ), a small collaborationist militia, closely affiliated to the Slovene Home Guard, which fought against the partisan resistance in the Julian March. Until 1945, he worked in the section for propaganda and culture, and helped to establish several cultural institutions (journals, publishing houses, schools) throughout the Goriška region. In May 1945, he withdrew to the Allied-occupied Northern Italy in order to escape Communist persecution. From there he emigrated to Argentina in 1948.\n\nHe settled in Buenos Aires, where he spent most of his later life. Initially, he worked as a manual worker in a glass factory, studying for the habilitation exam in philosophy and pedagogy. In the late 1940s, he started teaching philosophy and classical languages in different high schools, and later philosophy and pedagogy at the University of Buenos Aires. In 1959, started teaching history of modern philosophy at the Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina. From 1981 to 1982, he was dean of the Faculty for Philosophy at the same university. He retired from his teaching position in 1998.\n\nDuring his time in emigration, he started to publish essays in the local Slovenian, as well as Spanish-language press. Nevertheless, he became famous especially as a teacher and a pedagogue and the so-called \"Komar School\" developed around him. In 1992, pope John Paul II gave him the insignia of the Order of St. Gregory the Great. He spent the last decades of his life in the town of Boulogne sur Mer in the Buenos Aires Province. He died at the age of 84 in the Argentine town of San Isidro and was buried in the Žale Cemetery in his native Ljubljana.\n\nKomar was a polyglot: he was fluent in Slovenian, Spanish, Italian, German, Serbo-Croatian, French, Latin and Greek; he read also in Polish, Catalan and Portuguese.\n\nHe started as an expert on the Rationalist philosophy of Christian Wolff and later turned to Kant and Hegel. He was an attentive critic of modern immanentist philosophy, which drew him closer to certain aspect of phenomenology, especially the current represented by Edith Stein. He was also strongly influenced by the thought of the Spanish philosopher José Ortega y Gasset and, to a lesser extent, Miguel de Unamuno. He later developed an interest in psychology, particularly Sigmund Freud, to whom he kept a respectful disaccord, and Erik Erikson.\n\nHe was also influenced by non-conformist Catholic thinkers such as G. K. Chesterton and Georges Bernanos, but he always remained connected to the Neo-Scholastic tradition, best exemplified by the thought of Étienne Gilson and Josef Pieper. In the mid 1960s, he developed a strong intellectual and personal friendship with the Italian philosopher and political scientist Augusto Del Noce, whom he regarded as his \"spiritual brother\". Together with him and with the Polish philosopher Stefan Swieżawski, he started to work on his uncompleted life project, namely the reperiodization of modern philosophy.\n\nDuring the Communist regime, all his writings were prohibited in Slovenia; they were first published in the early 1990s, but his influence is still stronger in Latin America, in Spain and in Italy than in his native country.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4602393", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4602393", "title": "Models of scientific inquiry", "text": "Models of scientific inquiry\n\nIn the philosophy of science, models of scientific inquiry have two functions: first, to provide a descriptive account of \"how\" scientific inquiry is carried out in practice, and second, to provide an explanatory account of \"why\" scientific inquiry succeeds as well as it appears to do in arriving at genuine knowledge.\n\nThe search for scientific knowledge ends far back into antiquity. At some point in the past, at least by the time of Aristotle, philosophers recognized that a fundamental distinction should be drawn between two kinds of scientific knowledge—roughly, knowledge \"that\" and knowledge \"why\". It is one thing to know \"that\" each planet periodically reverses the direction of its motion with respect to the background of fixed stars; it is quite a different matter to know \"why\". Knowledge of the former type is descriptive; knowledge of the latter type is explanatory. It is explanatory knowledge that provides scientific understanding of the world. (Salmon, 2006, pg. 3)\n\n\"Scientific inquiry refers to the diverse ways in which scientists study the natural world and propose explanations based on the evidence derived from their work.\"\n\nThe classical model of scientific inquiry derives from Aristotle, who distinguished the forms of approximate and exact reasoning, set out the threefold scheme of abductive, deductive, and inductive inference, and also treated the compound forms such as reasoning by analogy.\n\nWesley Salmon (1989) began his historical survey of scientific explanation with what he called the \"received view\", as it was received from Hempel and Oppenheim in the years beginning with their \"Studies in the Logic of Explanation\" (1948) and culminating in Hempel's \"Aspects of Scientific Explanation\" (1965). Salmon summed up his analysis of these developments by means of the following Table.\n\nIn this classification, a deductive-nomological (D-N) explanation of an occurrence is a valid deduction whose conclusion states that the outcome to be explained did in fact occur. The deductive argument is called an \"explanation\", its premisses are called the \"explanans\" (L: \"explaining\") and the conclusion is called the \"explanandum\" (L: \"to be explained\"). Depending on a number of additional qualifications, an explanation may be ranked on a scale from \"potential\" to \"true\".\n\nNot all explanations in science are of the D-N type, however. An \"inductive-statistical\" (I-S) explanation accounts for an occurrence by subsuming it under statistical laws, rather than categorical or universal laws, and the mode of subsumption is itself inductive instead of deductive. The D-N type can be seen as a limiting case of the more general I-S type, the measure of certainty involved being complete, or probability 1, in the former case, whereas it is less than complete, probability < 1, in the latter case.\n\nIn this view, the D-N mode of reasoning, in addition to being used to explain particular occurrences, can also be used to explain general regularities, simply by deducing them from still more general laws.\n\nFinally, the \"deductive-statistical\" (D-S) type of explanation, properly regarded as a subclass of the D-N type, explains statistical regularities by deduction from more comprehensive statistical laws. (Salmon 1989, pp. 8–9).\n\nSuch was the \"received view\" of scientific explanation from the point of view of logical empiricism, that Salmon says \"held sway\" during the third quarter of the last century (Salmon, p. 10).\n\nDuring the course of history, one theory has succeeded another, and some have suggested further work while others have seemed content just to explain the phenomena. The reasons why one theory has replaced another are not always obvious or simple. The philosophy of science includes the question: \"What criteria are satisfied by a 'good' theory\". This question has a long history, and many scientists, as well as philosophers, have considered it. The objective is to be able to choose one theory as preferable to another without introducing cognitive bias. Several often proposed criteria were summarized by Colyvan. A good theory:\n\nStephen Hawking supports items 1–4, but does not mention fruitfulness. On the other hand, Kuhn emphasizes the importance of seminality.\n\nThe goal here is to make the choice between theories less arbitrary. Nonetheless, these criteria contain subjective elements, and are heuristics rather than part of scientific method. Also, criteria such as these do not necessarily decide between alternative theories. Quoting Bird:\nIt also is debatable whether existing scientific theories satisfy all these criteria, which may represent goals not yet achieved. For example, explanatory power over all existing observations (criterion 3) is satisfied by no one theory at the moment.\nThe desiderata of a \"good\" theory have been debated for centuries, going back perhaps even earlier than Occam's razor, which often is taken as an attribute of a good theory. Occam's razor might fall under the heading of \"elegance\", the first item on the list, but too zealous an application was cautioned by Albert Einstein: \"Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler.\" It is arguable that \"parsimony\" and \"elegance\" \"typically pull in different directions\". The falsifiability item on the list is related to the criterion proposed by Popper as demarcating a scientific theory from a theory like astrology: both \"explain\" observations, but the scientific theory takes the risk of making predictions that decide whether it is right or wrong:\n\nThomas Kuhn argued that changes in scientists' views of reality not only contain subjective elements, but result from group dynamics, \"revolutions\" in scientific practice which result in paradigm shifts. As an example, Kuhn suggested that the heliocentric \"Copernican Revolution\" replaced the geocentric views of Ptolemy not because of empirical failures, but because of a new \"paradigm\" that exerted control over what scientists felt to be the more fruitful way to pursue their goals.\n\nDeductive logic and inductive logic are quite different in their approaches.\n\nDeductive logic is the reasoning of proof, or logical implication. It is the logic used in mathematics and other axiomatic systems such as formal logic. In a deductive system, there will be axioms (postulates) which are not proven. Indeed, they cannot be proven without circularity. There will also be primitive terms which are not defined, as they cannot be defined without circularity. For example, one can define a line as a set of points, but to then define a point as the intersection of two lines would be circular. Because of these interesting characteristics of formal systems, Bertrand Russell humorously referred to mathematics as \"the field where we don't know what we are talking about, nor whether or not what we say is true\". All theorems and corollaries are proven by exploring the implications of the axiomata and other theorems that have previously been developed. New terms are defined using the primitive terms and other derived definitions based on those primitive terms.\n\nIn a deductive system, one can correctly use the term \"proof\", as applying to a theorem. To say that a theorem is proven means that it is impossible for the axioms to be true and the theorem to be false. For example, we could do a simple syllogism such as the following:\n\n\nNotice that it is not possible (assuming all of the trivial qualifying criteria are supplied) to be in Arches and not be in Utah. However, one can be in Utah while not in Arches National Park. The implication only works in one direction. Statements (1) and (2) taken together imply statement (3). Statement (3) does not imply anything about statements (1) or (2). Notice that we have not proven statement (3), but we have shown that statements (1) and (2) together imply statement (3). In mathematics, what is proven is not the truth of a particular theorem, but that the axioms of the system imply the theorem. In other words, it is impossible for the axioms to be true and the theorem to be false. The strength of deductive systems is that they are sure of their results. The weakness is that they are abstract constructs which are, unfortunately, one step removed from the physical world. They are very useful, however, as mathematics has provided great insights into natural science by providing useful models of natural phenomena. One result is the development of products and processes that benefit mankind.\n\nLearning about the physical world requires the use of inductive logic. This is the logic of theory building. It is useful in such widely divergent enterprises as science and crime scene detective work. One makes a set of observations, and seeks to explain what one sees. The observer forms a hypothesis in an attempt to explain what he/she has observed. The hypothesis will have implications, which will point to certain other observations that would naturally result from either a repeat of the experiment or making more observations from a slightly different set of circumstances. If the predicted observations hold true, one feels excitement that they may be on the right track. However, the hypothesis has not been proven. The hypothesis implies that certain observations should follow, but positive observations do not imply the hypothesis. They only make it more believable. It is quite possible that some other hypothesis could also account for the known observations, and may do better with future experiments. The implication flows in only one direction, as in the syllogism used in the discussion on deduction. Therefore, it is never correct to say that a scientific principle or hypothesis/theory has been proven. (At least, not in the rigorous sense of proof used in deductive systems.)\n\nA classic example of this is the study of gravitation. Newton formed a law for gravitation stating that the force of gravitation is directly proportional to the product of the two masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. For over 170 years, all observations seemed to validate his equation. However, telescopes eventually became powerful enough to see a slight discrepancy in the orbit of Mercury. Scientists tried everything imaginable to explain the discrepancy, but they could not do so using the objects that would bear on the orbit of Mercury. Eventually, Einstein developed his theory of general relativity and it explained the orbit of Mercury and all other known observations dealing with gravitation. During the long period of time when scientists were making observations that seemed to validate Newton's theory, they did not, in fact, prove his theory to be true. However, it must have seemed at the time that they did. It only took one counterexample (Mercury's orbit) to prove that there was something wrong with his theory.\n\nThis is typical of inductive logic. All of the observations that seem to validate the theory, do not prove its truth. But one counter-example can prove it false. That means that deductive logic is used in the evaluation of a theory. In other words, if A implies B, then not B implies not A. Einstein's theory of General Relativity has been supported by many observations using the best scientific instruments and experiments. However, his theory now has the same status as Newton's theory of gravitation prior to seeing the problems in the orbit of Mercury. It is highly credible and validated with all we know, but it is not proven. It is only the best we have at this point in time.\n\nAnother example of correct scientific reasoning is shown in the current search for the Higgs boson. Scientists on the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment at the Large Hadron Collider have conducted experiments yielding data suggesting the existence of the Higgs boson. However, realizing that the results could possibly be explained as a background fluctuation and not the Higgs boson, they are cautious and waiting for further data from future experiments. Said Guido Tonelli:\n\nA brief overview of the scientific method would then contain these steps as a minimum:\n\n\nWhen a hypothesis has survived a sufficient number of tests, it may be promoted to a scientific theory. A theory is a hypothesis that has survived many tests and seems to be consistent with other established scientific theories. Since a theory is a promoted hypothesis, it is of the same 'logical' species and shares the same logical limitations. Just as a hypothesis cannot be proven but can be disproved, that same is true for a theory. It is a difference of degree, not kind.\n\nArguments from analogy are another type of inductive reasoning. In arguing from analogy, one infers that since two things are alike in several respects, they are likely to be alike in another respect. This is, of course, an assumption. It is natural to attempt to find similarities between two phenomena and wonder what one can learn from those similarities. However, to notice that two things share attributes in several respects does not imply any similarities in other respects. It is possible that the observer has already noticed all of the attributes that are shared and any other attributes will be distinct. Argument from analogy is an unreliable method of reasoning that can lead to erroneous conclusions, and thus cannot be used to establish scientific facts.\n\n\n\nFor interesting explanations regarding the orbit of Mercury and General Relativity, the following links are useful:\n"}

The group maintained that, when one is conscious of, or knows, an object, it is an error to say that the object in itself and our knowledge of the object are two distinct facts. If we know a particular cow is black, is the blackness on that cow or in the observer's mind? Holt wrote: \"That color out there is the thing in consciousness selected for such inclusion by the nervous system's specific response.\" Consciousness is not physically identical with the nervous system: it is \"out there\" with the cow, all throughout the field of sight (and smell, and hearing) and identical with the set of facts it knows at any moment. The nervous system is merely a system of selection.\n\nThis position, which belongs to a broader category of views sometimes called neutral monism or, following William James, radical empiricism, has not worn well over the subsequent century, partly because of the problem of the nature of abstract ideas such as blackness. It seems very natural to locate blackness as an abstract idea in the mind that's useful in dealing with the world. The new realists did not want to acknowledge representationalism at all but later embraced something akin to Aristotle's form of realism: blackness is a general quality that many objects have in common, and the nervous system selects not just the object but the commonality as a fact. But Arthur Lovejoy showed in his book \"The Revolt Against Dualism\" that the perception of black varies so much, depending on context in the visual field, the perceiver's personal history and cultural usage, that it cannot be reduced to commonalities within objects. Better, Lovejoy thought, to bring representational ideas back into the account after all.\n\nIn the framework of continental hermeneutics, as a reaction against its constructivist or nihilistic outcomes, Maurizio Ferraris has proposed the so-called new realism (\"Manifesto del nuovo realismo\", 2012), a philosophical orientation shared by both analytic philosophers (such as Mario De Caro, see Bentornata Realtà, ed. by De Caro and Ferraris, 2012), and continental philosophers, such as Mauricio Beuchot (\"Manifesto del realismo analogico\", 2013), and Markus Gabriel (\"Fields of Sense: A New Realist Ontology\", 2014). In South America (\"Cenários da Filosofia contemporânea: fim da pós-modernidade e new realism?\", São Paulo, 2015; \"Cosa resta della Filosofia Contemporanea?\", Salerno-Roma, 2013) propose a political philosophy based on the Italian New Realism. (New realism intersects with other realistic continental movements that arose independently but responding to similar needs, such as the \"speculative realism\" defended by the French philosopher Quentin Meillassoux and the American philosopher Graham Harman.)\n\nFor new realism, the assumption that science is not systematically the ultimate measure of truth and reality does not mean that we should abandon the notions of reality, truth or objectivity, as was posited by much of twentieth century philosophy. Rather, it means that philosophy, as well as jurisprudence, linguistics or history, has something important and true to say about the world. In this context, new realism presents itself primarily as a negative realism: the resistance that the outside world poses to our conceptual schemes should not be seen as a failure, but as a resource – a proof of the existence of an independent world. If this is the case, however, this negative realism turns into a positive realism: in resisting us reality does not merely set a limit we cannot trespass, but it also offers opportunities and resources. This explains how, in the natural world, different life-forms can interact in the same environment without sharing any conceptual scheme and how, in the social world, human intentions and behaviors are made possible by a reality that is first given, and that only at a later time may be interpreted and, if necessary, transformed.\n\n"}

His father, Petre Bădescu, was a Romanian Orthodox priest and his mother, Ana Țuțea, was of peasant stock. After the First World War, Țuțea left his village to finish high school in Cluj and went on to study law at the University of Cluj. After graduating, he obtained a PhD in Administrative Law, also at the University of Cluj.\n\nPetre Țuțea moved to Bucharest and in 1932 he founded, together with Petre Pandrea, a leftist newspaper, \"Stânga\" (\"The Left\"), that was quickly and forcefully closed by the government. According to an anecdote told by Emil Cioran, Țuțea once went to a newspapers stand and bought the Soviet newspaper \"Pravda\" despite not being able to read Russian, then kissed it, showing his appreciation for Marxist ideology. Nevertheless, later in life, he would change his political views, departing from the Marxism and later became a devout Orthodox Christian.\n\nIn 1935 Țuțea and four other writers published a nationalist program of economic and social development, \"Manifestul revoluției naționale\" (\"Manifesto for a National Revolution\"). Around the same time he met the influential philosopher Nae Ionescu and wrote for his famous newspaper \"Cuvântul\" along with Mircea Eliade, Emil Cioran, Radu Gyr, Mircea Vulcănescu, Mihail Sebastian and other known writers.\n\nȚuțea was a member of the Criterion literary society and, like many other fellow members, became a sympathizer of the Iron Guard, a right-wing, ultra-nationalist organization. According to various published interviews, at that time Țuțea reckoned that democracy would have not guaranteed the sovereignty of the Romanian people. He also noted that many Romanian intellectuals had supported the Legionnaires, because \"their radical position against the harmful influence of Russian Bolshevism\", which he considered to be \"controlled by Jews\" (see \"Judeo-Bolshevism\"). Speaking of the Iron Guard, he notes the main difference between this organization and Fascism or National Socialism was its avowed Christian character.\n\nBetween 1936 and 1939, he was a director in the Ministry of Trade and Industry, in charge of the \"Office of Economics Publications and Propaganda\", then, he was a director of the research office in the Ministry of Foreign Trade. As the National Legionary State was proclaimed in 1940, he was a member of the Romanian delegation to Moscow for economic negotiations. He returned after the National Legionary State was abolished (after January 1941).\n\nAs the war against the Soviet Union began, he asked to be sent to the front, but his request was refused. He worked as a director in the Ministry of War Economy and after 23 August 1944, a director of studies in the Ministry of National Economy.\n\nȚuțea was arrested by the Communist regime in 1949, and was sent, without a trial, to \"re-education\" (euphemism for forced labor) at Ocnele Mari state prison. He was released in 1953 and, unable to find work, he lived with friends and relatives. Arrested again in 1956, he was tried for \"Conspiracy against the State\" (common charge against political rivals at the time). He was found guilty and sentenced to 18 years of hard labor, of which he served 8 years in various prisons, ending up in the infamous Aiud prison.\nAfter the release of all political prisoners in 1964, Petre Țuțea became famous as a Socratic type of philosopher. He also started to write books and essays, created an original dramatic form, \"Theater as Seminar\" and produced a philosophical manifesto, \"The Philosophy of Nuances\" (1969). Due to censorship very little of his work could be published and virtually nothing appeared after 1972. Under permanent observation, Țuțea had many of his manuscripts confiscated by the Romanian secret police, the Securitate. In the late 1980s he started working on a massive unfinished project in five volumes, \"Man, a Christian Treatise of Anthropology\".\n\nAfter the Romanian Revolution, Țuțea was embraced by Romanian intellectuals, receiving frequent requests from journalists and TV crews for interviews while living for one year with a student in theology, Radu Preda. Țuțea spent the last year of his life in a Christian hospice, \"Christiana\". He died in Bucharest at age 89 before seeing any of his books published.\n\nA very popular book (sold in more than 70,000 copies) is \"322 de vorbe memorabile\", a collection of aphorisms taken from various interviews, ordered alphabetically. In these interviews Țuțea adopted a hyperbolic, rhetorical style and the editor's choices included several controversial topics, such as atheism, Communism and Anti-Semitism. He generally adopts a hardline Orthodox Christian point-of-view, being critical of various groups, including atheists (whom he names \"weasels\"), communists (naming communism a \"social cancer\") and Jews (whom he finds responsible for the existence of Anti-Semitism).\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "35114916", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35114916", "title": "Role of chance in scientific discoveries", "text": "Role of chance in scientific discoveries\n\nThe role of chance, or \"luck\", in science comprises all ways in which unexpected discoveries are made.\n\nMany domains, especially psychology, are concerned with the way science interacts with chance — particularly \"serendipity\" (accidents that, through sagacity, are transformed into opportunity). Psychologist Kevin Dunbar and colleagues estimate that between 30% and 50% of all scientific discoveries are accidental in some sense (see examples below).\n\nPsychologist Alan A. Baumeister says a scientist must be \"sagacious\" (attentive and clever) to benefit from an accident. Dunbar quotes Louis Pasteur's saying that \"Chance favors only the prepared mind\". The prepared mind, Dunbar suggests, is one trained for observational rigor. Dunbar adds that there is a great deal of writing about the role that serendipity (\"happy accidents\") plays in the scientific method.\n\nResearch suggests that scientists are taught various heuristics and practices that allow their investigations to benefit, and not suffer, from accidents. First, careful control conditions allow scientists to properly identify something as \"unexpected\". Once a finding is recognized as legitimately unexpected and in need of explaining, researchers can attempt to explain it: They work across various disciplines, with various colleagues, trying various analogies in order to understand the first curious finding.\n\nAccidental discoveries have been a topic of discussion especially from the 20th century onwards. Kevin Dunbar and Jonathan Fugelsang say that somewhere between 33% and 50% of all scientific discoveries are unexpected. This helps explain why scientists often call their discoveries \"lucky\", and yet scientists themselves may not be able to detail exactly what role luck played (see also introspection illusion). Dunbar and Fugelsang believe scientific discoveries are the result of carefully prepared experiments, but also \"prepared minds\".\n\nThe author Nassim Nicholas Taleb calls science \"anti-fragile\". That is, science can actually use — and benefit from — the chaos of the real world. While some methods of investigation are fragile in the face of human error and randomness, the scientific method relies on randomness in many ways. Taleb believes that the more anti-fragile the system, the more it will flourish in the real world. According to M. K. Stoskopf, it is in this way that serendipity is often the \"foundation for important intellectual leaps of understanding\" in science.\n\nThe word \"Serendipity\" is frequently understood as simply \"a happy accident\", but Horace Walpole used the word 'serendipity' to refer to a certain kind of happy accident: the kind that can only be exploited by a \"sagacious\" or clever person. Thus Dunbar and Fugelsang talk about, not just luck or chance in science, but specifically \"serendipity\" in science.\n\nDunbar and Fugelsang suggest that the process of discovery often starts when a researcher finds bugs in their experiment. These unexpected results lead a researcher to self-doubt, and to try and fix what they \"think\" is an error in their own methodology. The first recourse is to explain the error using local hypotheses (e.g. analogies typical of the discipline). This process is also local in the sense that the scientist is relatively independent or else working with one partner. Eventually, the researcher decides that the error is too persistent and systematic to be a coincidence. Self-doubt is complete, and so the methods shift to become more broad: The researcher begin to think of theoretical explanations for the error, sometimes seeking the help of colleagues across different domains of expertise. The highly controlled, cautious, curious and even social aspects of the scientific method are what make it well suited for identifying persistent systematic errors (anomalies).\n\nAlbert Hofmann, the Swiss chemist who discovered LSD's psychedelic properties when he tried ingesting it at his lab, wrote\n\nFugelsang and Dunbar observe scientists while they work together in labs or analyze data, but they also use experimental settings and even neuroimaging. fMRI investigation found that unexpected findings were associated with particular brain activity. Unexpected findings were found to activate the prefrontal cortex as well as the left hemisphere in general. This suggests that unexpected findings provoke more attention, and the brain applies more linguistic, conscious systems to help explain those findings. This supports the idea that scientists are using particular abilities that exist to some extent in all humans.\nOn the other hand, Dunbar and Fugelsang say that an ingenious experimental design (and control conditions) may not be enough for the researcher to properly appreciate when a finding is \"unexpected\". Serendipitous discoveries often requires certain mental conditions in the investigator beyond rigor. For example, a scientist must know all about what is expected before they can be surprised, and this requires experience in the field. Researchers also require the sagacity to know to invest in the most curious findings.\n\nRoyston Roberts says that various discoveries required a degree of genius, but also some lucky element for that genius to act on. Richard Gaughan writes that accidental discoveries result from the convergence of preparation, opportunity, and desire.\n\nAn example of luck in science is when drugs under investigation become known for different, unexpected uses. This was the case for minoxidil (an antihypertensive vasodilator that was subsequently found to also slow hair loss and promote hair regrowth in some people) and for sildenafil (a medicine for pulmonary arterial hypertension, now familiar as \"Viagra\", used to treat erectile dysfunction). \n\nThe hallucinogenic effects of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) were discovered by Albert Hofmann, who was originally working with the substance to try and treat migraines and bleeding after childbirth. Hofmann experienced mental distortions and suspected it may have been the effects of LSD. He decided to test this hypothesis on himself by taking what he thought was \"an extremely small quantity\": 250 micrograms. Hofmann's description of what he experienced as a result of taking so much LSD is regarded by Royston Roberts as \"one of the most frightening accounts in recorded medical history\".\n"}

In this model, organisms occupy two patches of habitat. One patch, the source, is a high quality habitat that on average allows the population to increase. The second patch, the sink, is very low quality habitat that, on its own, would not be able to support a population. However, if the excess of individuals produced in the source frequently moves to the sink, the sink population can persist indefinitely. Organisms are generally assumed to be able to distinguish between high and low quality habitat, and to prefer high quality habitat. However, ecological trap theory describes the reasons why organisms may actually prefer sink patches over source patches. Finally, the source-sink model implies that some habitat patches may be more important to the long-term survival of the population, and considering the presence of source-sink dynamics will help inform conservation decisions.\n\nAlthough the seeds of a source-sink model had been planted earlier, Pulliam is often recognized as the first to present a fully developed source-sink model. He defined source and sink patches in terms of their demographic parameters, or BIDE rates (birth, immigration, death, and emigration rates). In the source patch, birth rates were greater than death rates, causing the population to grow. The excess individuals were expected to leave the patch, so that emigration rates were greater than immigration rates. In other words, sources were a net exporter of individuals. In contrast, in a sink patch, death rates were greater than birth rates, resulting in a population decline toward extinction unless enough individuals emigrated from the source patch. Immigration rates were expected to be greater than emigration rates, so that sinks were a net importer of individuals. As a result, there would be a net flow of individuals from the source to the sink (see Table 1).\n\nPulliam's work was followed by many others who developed and tested the source-sink model. Watkinson and Sutherland presented a phenomenon in which high immigration rates could cause a patch to appear to be a sink by raising the patch's population above its carrying capacity (the number of individuals it can support). However, in the absence of immigration, the patches are able to support a smaller population. Since true sinks cannot support any population, the authors called these patches \"pseudo-sinks\". Definitively distinguishing between true sinks and pseudo-sinks requires cutting off immigration to the patch in question and determining whether the patch is still able to maintain a population. Thomas et al. were able to do just that, taking advantage of an unseasonable frost that killed off the host plants for a source population of Edith's checkerspot butterfly (\"Euphydryas editha\"). Without the host plants, the supply of immigrants to other nearby patches was cut off. Although these patches had appeared to be sinks, they did not become extinct without the constant supply of immigrants. They were capable of sustaining a smaller population, suggesting that they were in fact pseudo-sinks.\n\nWatkinson and Sutherland's caution about identifying pseudo-sinks was followed by Dias, who argued that differentiating between sources and sinks themselves may be difficult. She asserted that a long-term study of the demographic parameters of the populations in each patch is necessary. Otherwise, temporary variations in those parameters, perhaps due to climate fluctuations or natural disasters, may result in a misclassification of the patches. For example, Johnson described periodic flooding of a river in Costa Rica which completely inundated patches of the host plant for a rolled-leaf beetle (\"Cephaloleia fenestrata\"). During the floods, these patches became sinks, but at other times they were no different from other patches. If researchers had not considered what happened during the floods, they would not have understood the full complexity of the system.\n\nDias also argued that an inversion between source and sink habitat is possible so that the sinks may actually become the sources. Because reproduction in source patches is much higher than in sink patches, natural selection is generally expected to favor adaptations to the source habitat. However, if the proportion of source to sink habitat changes so that sink habitat becomes much more available, organisms may begin to adapt to it instead. Once adapted, the sink may become a source habitat. This is believed to have occurred for the blue tit (\"Parus caeruleus\") 7500 years ago as forest composition on Corsica changed, but few modern examples are known. Boughton described a source—pseudo-sink inversion in butterfly populations of \"E. editha\". Following the frost, the butterflies had difficulty recolonizing the former source patches. Boughton found that the host plants in the former sources senesced much earlier than in the former pseudo-sink patches. As a result, immigrants regularly arrived too late to successfully reproduce. He found that the former pseudo-sinks had become sources, and the former sources had become true sinks.\n\nOne of the most recent additions to the source-sink literature is by Tittler et al., who examined wood thrush (\"Hylocichla mustelina\") survey data for evidence of source and sink populations on a large scale. The authors reasoned that emigrants from sources would likely be the juveniles produced in one year dispersing to reproduce in sinks in the next year, producing a one-year time lag between population changes in the source and in the sink. Using data from the Breeding Bird Survey, an annual survey of North American birds, they looked for relationships between survey sites showing such a one-year time lag. They found several pairs of sites showing significant relationships 60–80 km apart. Several appeared to be sources to more than one sink, and several sinks appeared to receive individuals from more than one source. In addition, some sites appeared to be a sink to one site and a source to another (see Figure 1). The authors concluded that source-sink dynamics may occur on continental scales.\n\nOne of the more confusing issues involves identifying sources and sinks in the field. Runge et al. point out that in general researchers need to estimate per capita reproduction, probability of survival, and probability of emigration to differentiate source and sink habitats. If emigration is ignored, then individuals that emigrate may be treated as mortalities, thus causing sources to be classified as sinks. This issue is important if the source-sink concept is viewed in terms of habitat quality (as it is in Table 1) because classifying high-quality habitat as low-quality may lead to mistakes in ecological management. Runge et al. showed how to integrate the theory of source-sink dynamics with population projection matrices and ecological statistics in order to differentiate sources and sinks.\n\nWhy would individuals ever leave high quality source habitat for a low quality sink habitat? This question is central to source-sink theory. Ultimately, it depends on the organisms and the way they move and distribute themselves between habitat patches. For example, plants disperse passively, relying on other agents such as wind or water currents to move seeds to another patch. Passive dispersal can result in source-sink dynamics whenever the seeds land in a patch that cannot support the plant's growth or reproduction. Winds may continually deposit seeds there, maintaining a population even though the plants themselves do not successfully reproduce. Another good example for this case are soil protists. Soil protists also disperse passively, relying mainly on wind to colonize other sites. As a result, source-sink dynamics can arise simply because external agents dispersed protist propagules (e.g., cysts, spores), forcing individuals to grow in a poor habitat.\n\nIn contrast, many organisms that disperse actively should have no reason to remain in a sink patch, provided the organisms are able to recognize it as a poor quality patch (see discussion of ecological traps). The reasoning behind this argument is that organisms are often expected to behave according to the \"ideal free distribution\", which describes a population in which individuals distribute themselves evenly among habitat patches according to how many individuals the patch can support. When there are patches of varying quality available, the ideal free distribution predicts a pattern of \"balanced dispersal\". In this model, when the preferred habitat patch becomes crowded enough that the average fitness (survival rate or reproductive success) of the individuals in the patch drops below the average fitness in a second, lower quality patch, individuals are expected to move to the second patch. However, as soon as the second patch becomes sufficiently crowded, individuals are expected to move back to the first patch. Eventually, the patches should become balanced so that the average fitness of the individuals in each patch and the rates of dispersal between the two patches are even. In this balanced dispersal model, the probability of leaving a patch is inversely proportional to the carrying capacity of the patch. In this case, individuals should not remain in sink habitat for very long, where the carrying capacity is zero and the probability of leaving is therefore very high.\n\nAn alternative to the ideal free distribution and balanced dispersal models is when fitness can vary among potential breeding sites within habitat patches and individuals must select the best available site. This alternative has been called the \"ideal preemptive distribution\", because a breeding site can be preempted if it has already been occupied. For example, the dominant, older individuals in a population may occupy all of the best territories in the source so that the next best territory available may be in the sink. As the subordinate, younger individuals age, they may be able to take over territories in the source, but new subordinate juveniles from the source will have to move to the sink. Pulliam argued that such a pattern of dispersal can maintain a large sink population indefinitely. Furthermore, if good breeding sites in the source are rare and poor breeding sites in the sink are common, it is even possible that the majority of the population resides in the sink.\n\nThe source-sink model of population dynamics has made contributions to many areas in ecology. For example, a species' niche was originally described as the environmental factors required by a species to carry out its life history, and a species was expected to be found only in areas that met these niche requirements. This concept of a niche was later termed the \"fundamental niche\", and described as all of the places a species could successfully occupy. In contrast, the \"realized niche\", was described as all of the places a species actually did occupy, and was expected to be less than the extent of the fundamental niche as a result of competition with other species. However, the source-sink model demonstrated that the majority of a population could occupy a sink which, by definition, did not meet the niche requirements of the species, and was therefore outside the fundamental niche (see Figure 2). In this case, the realized niche was actually larger than the fundamental niche, and ideas about how to define a species' niche had to change.\n\nSource–sink dynamics has also been incorporated into studies of metapopulations, a group of populations residing in patches of habitat. Though some patches may go extinct, the regional persistence of the metapopulation depends on the ability of patches to be re-colonized. As long as there are source patches present for successful reproduction, sink patches may allow the total number of individuals in the metapopulation to grow beyond what the source could support, providing a reserve of individuals available for re-colonization. Source–sink dynamics also has implications for studies of the coexistence of species within habitat patches. Because a patch that is a source for one species may be a sink for another, coexistence may actually depend on immigration from a second patch rather than the interactions between the two species. Similarly, source-sink dynamics may influence the regional coexistence and demographics of species within a metacommunity, a group of communities connected by the dispersal of potentially interacting species. Finally, the source-sink model has greatly influenced ecological trap theory, a model in which organisms prefer sink habitat over source habitat.\n\nLand managers and conservationists have become increasingly interested in preserving and restoring high quality habitat, particularly where rare, threatened, or endangered species are concerned. As a result, it is important to understand how to identify or create high quality habitat, and how populations respond to habitat loss or change. Because a large proportion of a species' population could exist in sink habitat, conservation efforts may misinterpret the species' habitat requirements. Similarly, without considering the presence of a trap, conservationists might mistakenly preserve trap habitat under the assumption that an organism's preferred habitat was also good quality habitat. Simultaneously, source habitat may be ignored or even destroyed if only a small proportion of the population resides there. Degradation or destruction of the source habitat will, in turn, impact the sink or trap populations, potentially over large distances. Finally, efforts to restore degraded habitat may unintentionally create an ecological trap by giving a site the appearance of quality habitat, but which has not yet developed all of the functional elements necessary for an organism's survival and reproduction. For an already threatened species, such mistakes might result in a rapid population decline toward extinction.\n\nIn considering where to place reserves, protecting source habitat is often assumed to be the goal, although if the cause of a sink is human activity, simply designating an area as a reserve has the potential to convert current sink patches to source patches (e.g. no-take zones). Either way, determining which areas are sources or sinks for any one species may be very difficult, and an area that is a source for one species may be unimportant to others. Finally, areas that are sources or sinks currently may not be in the future as habitats are continually altered by human activity or climate change. Few areas can be expected to be universal sources, or universal sinks. While the presence of source, sink, or trap patches must be considered for short-term population survival, especially for very small populations, long-term survival may depend on the creation of networks of reserves that incorporate a variety of habitats and allow populations to interact.\n\n\n"}

The camp serves children from the ages of 8–18, and each year attracts approximately 120 campers and 50 staff members, with the capacity of up to 140 campers per week. Formerly known by the name Boston Diocese Camp, the program's name was changed with the diocese's elevation to a metropolis in late 2002.\n\nBesides being the home of the Metropolis's summer and winter camps, the Faith and Heritage Center also allows Orthodox parishes to hold weekend retreats for youth and families and each September, the Metropolis sponsors an open house which coincides with the celebration of the Feast of the Cross when the blessing of the waters service takes place. During this service Metropolitan Methodios throws the cross into the lake and campers dive to retrieve it. Also holding programs at the camp are Hellenic College-Holy Cross, the Orthodox Church in America, the Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese and the Armenian Apostolic Church, while the Roman Catholic Church, the United Church of Christ, and the New Hampshire Council of Churches have used the facility for retreats and gatherings in addition to many community organizations and schools.\n\nThe property that is now St. Methodios was a community known as \"Cloughville\" in the 19th century. In 1919, the patriarchs of the Clough family, Joseph and Sylvia Clough, died, and the property was sold to Mr. Price and Mr. Pick of New York, who established Camp Merrimac, a summer camp for Jewish boys, on the site. The first campers arrived in 1921. The camp was in a scenic location at the end of a dirt road on a lake officially known as Clement Pond, but known to generations of Merrimac campers as Lake Josylvia. Several of the old Cloughville buildings survived the transition—the local post office became the camp office. The ice house was the head counselor's shack. The village hall housed the mature staff, and a 19th-century barn lasted until it fell down one winter about 1960.\n\nMr. Price and Mr. Pick ran Camp Merrimac until the late 1940s when it was purchased by Abe Beleson, a teacher at the Bronx High School of Science. In 1953, Maury Bleifeld became a part owner, and in 1954 Harry Levine bought a share of the camp. In 1957, Werner Rothschild, Robert \"Bob\" Bomze, and Fred Egre purchased the property.\n\nIn 1958, Egre was bought out while Rothchild and Bomze continued operating the camp. Keeping the name Camp Merrimac, they continued to run a general summer camp program. One innovation they introduced in the 1960s was to have counselors from England, Sweden, and other European countries. In addition, being physical education teachers, they began the New England Hockey Camp and New England Figure Skating Camp. Youth would travel by bus to Concord, New Hampshire, to the Everett Arena for ice time.\n\nBoth boys and girls attended the camp from after World War II until 1998. The majority of campers came from the New York metropolitan area at first. From the late 1980s until the end campers came from all over the United States, plus Canada, Mexico and Europe.\n\nNearing retirement, and perhaps a bit exhausted after 40+ summers at camp, Mr. Rothschild and Mr. Martin (as Bomze was then known) were ready to sell. They wanted the property to remain a youth facility. They were searching for a buyer who would continue youth programs. In 1998, the camp was sold to the Greek Orthodox Metropolis of Boston.\n\nAfter years of using other area camp grounds around New England to support the growing community, the Metropolis decided to buy its own campground. The former Camp Merrimac property was purchased with the help of a $500,000 donation by former pharmaceutical company owner George D. Behrakis in the summer of 1998.\n\nRegular camp sessions began at the site in 1999, along with an ambitious program to winterize, improve, and expand the campground. As part of this modernization program, new water and waste water systems were designed and installed, the cafeteria was renovated, adding a new kitchen, and the rec hall was remodeled. The former barn was extended and a bell tower added to create a 200-seat chapel and all of the cabins on the eastern side of the camp were rebuilt over a ten-year period.\n\nIn 2006, Metropolitan Methodios and the Camp and Retreat Center Committee drafted plans for a new lodge on the shore of Clement Pond which would consist of 30 rooms with private accommodations for families, couples, individuals, clergy and laity. The plan was met with criticism from area property owners who felt that the new building would bring \"noise, traffic and lighting [that] will destroy the place they go to get away\", but it was ultimately approved by the Hopkinton Zoning Board of Adjustment in 2007. After the New Hampshire Supreme Court upheld the decision of the Hopkinton Zoning Board, construction began in the summer of 2008.\n\n"}

She wrote on practical philosophy as well as on philosophy of mind, bringing these disciplines closer together. Her work draws on sources from the social sciences as well as the neurosciences, and can be broadly characterised as both naturalistic and interdisciplinary.\n\nHurley was born in New York City and brought up in Santa Barbara, California. Her mother, a first-generation Armenian immigrant, was a secretary, and her father was an aviation industry executive. After a philosophy degree at Princeton University (1976), she studied law at Harvard, resulting in a degree in 1988, and pursued graduate work in philosophy (a BPhil, 1979, and a doctorate, 1983) at Oxford, supervised primarily by John McDowell. She married the British neuroscientist, Professor Nick Rawlins, in 1986.\n\nIn \"Consciousness in Action\", as well as in many of her articles, Hurley defends vehicle externalism, the view that mental processes do not necessarily have to be explained in terms of internal processes. There is no good reason to assume, Hurley argues, that subpersonal processes on which the mind depends always need to respect the boney boundary of the skull. Hurley's externalism is connected to her critiques of what she has called 'the classical sandwich model of the mind'. Traditionally, philosophers and empirical scientists of the mind have regarded perception as input from world to mind, action as output from mind to world, and cognition as sandwiched between. According to Hurley there is no reason to suppose the mind is necessarily organised in this vertically modular way and, moreover, there is good reason to believe it is actually organised differently. An alternative would be a horizontally modular architecture, which is for example used in Rodney Brooks's robots. In one of her last texts, Hurley proposes a horizontally modular architecture that could enable social cognitive skills.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1080388", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1080388", "title": "The Concept of Mind", "text": "The Concept of Mind\n\nThe Concept of Mind is a 1949 book by philosopher Gilbert Ryle, in which the author argues that \"mind\" is \"a philosophical illusion hailing chiefly from René Descartes and sustained by logical errors and 'category mistakes' which have become habitual.\" The work has been cited as having \"put the final nail in the coffin of Cartesian dualism\" and has been seen as a founding document in the philosophy of mind, which received professional recognition as a distinct and important branch of philosophy only after 1950.\n\nIn the chapter \"Descartes' Myth,\" Ryle introduces the term \"the dogma of the Ghost in the machine\" to describe the philosophical concept of the mind as an entity separate from the body. He argues, \"I hope to prove that it is entirely false, and false not in detail but in principle. It is not merely an assemblage of particular mistakes. It is one big mistake and a mistake of a special kind. It is, namely, a category mistake.\"\n\nRyle rejects Descartes' theory of the relation between mind and body, on the grounds that it approaches the investigation of mental processes as if they could be isolated from physical processes. In order to demonstrate how this theory may be misleading, he explains that knowing how to perform an act skillfully may not only be a matter of being able to reason practically but may also be a matter of being able to put practical reasoning into action. Practical actions may not necessarily be produced by highly theoretical reasoning or by complex sequences of intellectual operations. The meaning of actions may not be explained by making inferences about hidden mental processes, but it may be explained by examining the rules that govern those actions.\n\nAccording to Ryle, mental processes are merely intelligent acts. There are no mental processes that are distinct from intelligent acts. The operations of the mind are not merely represented by intelligent acts, they are the same as those intelligent acts. Thus, acts of learning, remembering, imagining, knowing, or willing are not merely clues to hidden mental processes or to complex sequences of intellectual operations, they are the way in which those mental processes or intellectual operations are defined. Logical propositions are not merely clues to modes of reasoning, they are those modes of reasoning.\n\nThe rationalist theory that there is a \"transformation into\" physical acts of some purely mental faculty of \"Will\" or \"Volition\" is therefore a misconception because it mistakenly assumes that a mental act could be and is distinct from a physical act, or even that a mental \"world\" could be and is distinct from the physical world. This theory of the separability of mind and body is described by Ryle as \"the dogma of the ghost in the machine\". He explains that the workings of the mind as it governs the body are neither an independent nor a distinct mechanism, that there is no entity called \"Mind\" inside a mechanical apparatus called \"the body\", but that the workings of the mind may be better conceptualized as the actions of the body.\n\nCartesian theory holds that mental acts determine physical acts and that volitional acts of the body must be caused by volitional acts of the mind. This theory, according to Ryle, is \"the myth of the ghost in the machine\".\n\nThere \"is\" no contradiction between saying that an action is governed by physical laws and saying that the same action is governed by principles of reasoning. The motives of observable actions are \"propensities\" and \"dispositions\"; these explain why behaviors occur, and not some purely mental process. For example, the disposition to want or not to want something is not explained by an intellectual motive for that thing. The disposition to want something is explained by \"the behaviors that are involved\" in wanting that thing. Thus, the mind does consist of abilities and dispositions that do explain behaviors, for example the learning, remembering, knowing, feeling, or willing behaviors. However, personal abilities and dispositions are not the same as mental processes or events. To refer to abilities or dispositions as if they were purely mental occurrences is to make a basic kind of category-mistake.\n\nThe nature of a person's motives may be defined by the actions and reactions of that person in various circumstances or situations. The nature of a person's motives in a particular situation may not necessarily be determined by any hidden mental processes or intellectual acts within that person. Motives may be revealed or explained by a person's behavior in a situation.\n\nRyle criticizes the theory that the mind is a place where mental images are apprehended, perceived, or remembered. Sensations, thoughts, and feelings do not belong to a mental world which is distinct from the physical world. Knowledge, memory, imagination, and other abilities or dispositions do not reside \"within\" the mind as if the mind were a space in which these dispositions could be placed or located. Furthermore, dispositions are not the same as behavioral actions, but actions may be explained by dispositions.\n\nDispositions are neither visible nor hidden, because they are not in the same logical category as behavioral actions. Dispositions are not mental processes or intellectual acts, they are propensities which explain various modes of behavior. Perceptions, thoughts, emotions, and feelings may be understood as observable behaviors which have various modes of production.\n\nRyle admits that his approach to the theory of mind is behavioristic in being opposed to the theory that there are hidden mental processes that are distinct from observable behaviors. His approach is based on the view that actions such as thinking, remembering, feeling, and willing are revealed by modes of behavior or by dispositions to modes of behavior. At the same time, however, he criticizes both Cartesian theory and behaviorist theory for being overly mechanistic. While Cartesian theory may insist that hidden mental events produce the behavioral responses of the conscious individual, behaviorism may insist that stimulus-response mechanisms produce the behavioral responses of the conscious individual. Ryle concludes that both Cartesian theory and behaviorist theory may be too rigid and mechanistic to provide us with an adequate understanding of the concept of mind.\n\nAs a linguistic philosopher, a significant portion of Ryle's argument is devoted to analyzing what he perceives as philosophical errors based in conceptual use of language. His critique of Cartesian dualism refers to it as a \"category mistake.\" Category mistakes, such as the ones Ryle points out, are made by people who do not know how to properly wield the concepts with which they are working. Their puzzles arise from the inability to use certain items in human language. A much-cited example is of a foreign visitor being shown round Oxford (which has no campus) and after having been shown colleges, libraries, laboratories and playing fields asks in puzzlement \"But where is the university?\" The answer is, of course, all of these.\n\nThe theoretically interesting category mistakes are those made by people who are perfectly competent to apply concepts, at least in the situations with which they are familiar, but are still liable in their abstract thinking to relocate those concepts to logical types to which they do not belong.\nThe dualist doctrine establishes a polar opposition between mind and body. At the language level, the mental properties are logical negations (in the Aristotelian sense) of the physical properties. So they belong, in accordance with the concept of category, to the same logical types, given that the expressions that are used for the descriptions of mental events are always mere negatives of the expressions used for the descriptions of material events. Ryle then says that such use implies a 'categorical mistake' for the descriptions of mental events that do not properly belong to the categories used for describing the corporeal events. Hence, 'mind' and 'matter' cannot be the polar opposites that Dualism suggests. Ryle writes that this would be comparable to claiming that \"She came home in floods of tears\" and \"She came home in a sedan chair\" (from the sentence \"Miss Bolo came home in a flood of tears and a sedan chair\", a zeugmatic sentence from Dickens) to be polar opposites. Such mistakes are, from the Rylean standpoint, the dogma of the mental ghost in the corporeal machine. Then, dualist doctrines are mythic in an analytical sense.\n\nRyle builds on the work of the philosophers Ludwig Wittgenstein and Arthur Schopenhauer, among others. According to Bryan Magee, the central thesis of \"The Concept of Mind\" and the essentials of its subsidiary theses were derived from Schopenhauer, whose works Ryle had read as a student, then largely forgotten. Ryle, who believed that he had expounded an original theory, did not realize what he had done until someone pointed it out to him after the book was published.\n\n\"The Concept of Mind\" has been compared to Jean-Paul Sartre's \"Being and Nothingness\" (1943) by Iris Murdoch, who writes that English analytic philosophy shares the same general orientation as continental philosophy. Ryle has been interpreted by David Stannard as maintaining that the psychoanalytic idea of the unconscious is rooted in the Cartesian conception of a body-mind dichotomy and as such is one version of the \"Ghost in the Machine\" fallacy. According to Stannard, Ryle views the dogma as a logical error based on a category mistake.\n\nAuthor Richard Webster, in \"Why Freud Was Wrong\" (1995), praises Ryle's clarity and strength of argument, but suggests that while his arguments effectively dissolve the mind-body problem, they have failed to bring about a revolution in human knowledge. Webster attributes this to the fact that Ryle's case that subjective aspects of experience such as sensation, memory, consciousness and sense of self are not the essence of \"mind\" has not been universally accepted by contemporary philosophers, neuroscientists, and psychologists. Webster believes that Ryle's willingness to accept the characterization of \"The Concept of Mind\" as behaviorist misrepresents its more nuanced position, writing that Ryle's acceptance of that description is not harmless, as Ryle himself suggested. Webster stresses that Ryle does not deny the reality of what are often called internal sensations and thoughts, but simply rejects the idea that they belong to a realm logically distinct from and independent of the external realm of ordinary human behaviour.\n\nRyle has been characterized as an \"ordinary language\" philosopher. The book's style of writing has attracted comment. Stuart Hampshire remarked in a review in \"Mind\" that, \"There is only one property which I can discover to be common to Professor Ryle and Immanuel Kant; in both cases the style is the philosopher - as Kant thought and wrote in dichotomies, Professor Ryle writes in epigrams. There are many passages in which the argument simply consists of a succession of epigrams, which do indeed effectively explode on impact, shattering conventional trains of thought, but which, like most epigrams, leave behind among the debris in the reader's mind a trail of timid doubts and qualifications.\"\n\nIts style of writing was commented on more negatively by Herbert Marcuse, who observes that the way in which Ryle follows his presentation of \"Descartes' Myth\" as the \"official doctrine\" about the relation between body and mind with a preliminary demonstration of its \"absurdity\" which evokes \"John Doe, Richard Roe, and what they think about the 'Average Taxpayer'\" shows a style that moves \"between the two poles of pontificating authority and easy-going chumminess\", something Marcuse finds to be characteristic of philosophical behaviorism. John Searle, who believes that no great work of philosophy contains many footnotes and that philosophical quality varies inversely with the number of bibliographical references, considers the absence of footnotes in \"The Concept of Mind\" a sign of its quality.\n\n\n"}

Mills in which he attempts to show that, although it is conventional to represent the social contract moral and political theories of Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, and Kant as neutral with respect to race and ethnicity, in actuality the philosophers understood them to regulate only relations between whites; in relation to non-whites, these philosophers helped to create a \"racial contract,\" which in both formal and informal ways permitted whites to oppress and exploit non-whites and violate their own moral ideals in dealing with non-whites. Because in contemporary political philosophy white philosophers take their own white privilege for granted, they do not recognize that white supremacy is a political system, and so in their developments of ideal moral and political theory never consider actual practice. Mills proposes to develop a non-ideal theory \"to explain and expose the inequities of the actual nonideal policy and to help us see through the theories and moral justifications offered in defense of them.\" Using it as a central concept, \"the notion of a Racial Contract might be more revealing of the real character of the world we are living in, and the corresponding historical deficiencies of its normative theories and practices, than the raceless notions currently dominant in political theory.\" \n\nMills argues that racism is at the core of the “social contract,\" rather than racism being an unintended result attributed to the failings of imperfect men. Specifically, the Racial Contract is a tacit (and at times explicit) agreement among members of the tribes of Europe to assert, promote, and maintain the ideal of white supremacy as against all other tribes of the world. This intention is deliberate and an integral characteristic of the social contract, a characteristic which persists to the present day. In Mills’ words, “…what has usually been taken...as the racist ‘exception’ has really been the rule; what has been taken as the ‘rule’…[racial equality]…has really been the exception.”\n\nMills argues however, that these ideals of the Social Contract are at worst pure fiction or at best were intended only to apply to a specific group of people, namely members of the tribes of Europe and their genetic descendants. “…\"’when white people say ‘Justice,’ they mean ‘Just Us’.\"”\n\n"}

In 1942, he was murdered by the Nazis during the Occupation of France.\n\nBorn in Saint Petersburg, he left the USSR in 1922 at the end of the Civil War. He settled in Paris and studied at the Lycée Henri IV and the Sorbonne University. A pupil of French philosopher Victor Basch, he worked on aesthetics and wrote an essay, \"L'Esthétique française contemporaine\" (\"French contemporan aesthetic\"), Félix Alcan, 1936.\n\nInvolved in public activities as a teacher of philosophy, he supported as an antifascist the Front populaire and the Spanish Republic during the Spanish Civil War. He joined the French Communist Party in 1937. Among his friends were Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, Gaston Bachelard and Georges Politzer. In September 1939, he volunteered for the French Army despite suffering from a heart condition. Mobilized as a soldier in Rethel, he began to write his \"Journal de guerre\" in January 1940 in the middle of the Phoney War. He survived several air attacks and bombardments during the Fall of France (May–June 1940).\n\nUnder the German Occupation he was a teacher in Dieppe but suffered from the first French Statute on Jews (October 1940). He was finally excluded from teaching in July 1941. By that time, he was already active in the French Resistance. From 1940, he was liaison officer between Dieppe, Rouen and Paris. After a year, he wrote the texts against the collaborationist Vichy regime and the Germans in the clandestine newspaper \"L'Avenir normand\" in Dieppe, and wrote several texts for the clandestine Parisian review \"La Pensée libre\", supervised by Georges Politzer, Jacques Decour and Jacques Solomon. Becoming part of the underground, he joined a group of communist Resistance in Rouen, where he participated in actions against the German occupiers.\n\nArrested in February 1942 after the sabotage of a factory, he was imprisoned and tortured. Judged in Paris, he was condemned to death by a German military tribunal. He refused to sign his appeal for a reprieve. Feldman was executed by a firing squad on July 27, 1942. Addressing the German soldiers just before the salvo, he called out to them: \"Imbeciles, it is for you that I die! \"\n\nHis last words inspired numerous French writers : Jean-Paul Sartre and Louis Aragon were among them. French-Swiss film-maker Jean-Luc Godard dedicated a short film to him, \"The Last Word\" (1988).\n\nEssays :\n\nTranslations (from Russian to French) :\n"}

Lighthall, was a Canadian lawyer, historian, novelist, poet and philosopher.\n\nBorn in Hamilton, Canada West, to Margaret Wright McIntryre and William Francis Lighthall, W.D. Lighthall grew up in Montreal and attended the High School of Montreal and McGill University, where he graduated B.A. in 1879, Bachelor of Civil Laws in 1881, and M.A. in 1885. Admitted to the Quebec Bar in 1881, he practiced law in Montreal for the next 63 years, from 1881 to 1944.\n\nIn 1890 he married Cybel Charlotte Wilkes, and they had three children: Alice Margaret Schuyler Lighthall (born 1891), Cybel Katharine Schuyler Lighthall, (born 1893), and William Wilkes Schuyler Lighthall, born 1896.\n\nIn 1893 W.D. Lighthall did the legal work \"pro bono\" to incorporate the Montreal Women's Club.\n\nHe served as mayor of Westmount from 1900 to 1903. During that time he originated, and in 1901 co-founded, the Union of Canadian Municipalities (now the Federation of Canadian Municipalities). He also served as vice president of the National Municipal League of America.\n\nIn 1915 he founded Canada's first veterans' group, the Canadian Association of Returned Soldiers.\n\nLighthall was a member of the International Congress of Philosophy. He published in the \"Philosophical Review\" three times in the late 1920s.\n\nHe took a long-time interest in Canadian history, originating the Château Ramezay Historical Museum, and serving on the Royal Historical Monuments Commission and as chairman of the McCord Historical Museum. He wrote historical books, such as \"Montreal After 250 Years\", and monographs, like \"The Manor House of Lacolle\".\n\nLighthall also wrote historical romances, initially under the pen name of Wilfrid Châteauclair, beginning with \"The Young Seigneur, or Nation Making\" in 1888. He wrote poetry as well, publishing his first book, \"Thoughts, Moods and Ideals\", in 1887. He was an early supporter of the Canadian Authors Association, becoming its president in 1930.\n\nIn literary circles, though, Lighthall \"is remembered mainly for his anthology, \"Songs of the Great Dominion\" ... which included a large number of poets whose names are still familiar, for example, Wilfred Campbell, Carman, Crawford, Johnson, Lampman, and Charles G.D. Roberts.\"\n\nW.D. Lighthall was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 1902, and served as its president in 1918 and 1919.\n\nIn 1921 he was made an honorary Doctor of Laws by McGill.\n\nLighthall was among a number of the post-Darwinian thinkers of the nineteenth century who struggled with the concept of a Supreme Cause. Some of them not only struggled to redefine \"God\"; they also struggled to rename this entity. For his part Lighthall defined the cause as a \"force of will\" and called that force \"The Outer Consciousness\", \"The Outer Knowledge\", \"The Directive Power\", and \"The Person of Evolution\". However unlike the philosopher Schopenhauer or the novelist Hardy, Lighthall, who considered himself to be both a philosopher and a novelist was optimistic in his view of the nature of \"the will\". That optimism was based on Lighthall's unbending faith in the positive nature of evolutionary progress. His views are present in his Novels particularly in \"The Master of Life\" as well as in his hope for Canada as a nation.\n\nA reader of Lighthall's philosophical works may encounter some difficulty with the style. The main problem lies in the fact that Lighthall seldom completely reworked the lecture notes, pamphlets, and texts that he used to create the works as he published them. Furthermore, he preferred to number his paragraphs, as he considered these paragraphs to be \"capsular\" ideas. Perhaps due to his training in law he preferred to protect the integrity of these modules rather than sacrifice any of their meaning for the integrated flow of ideas in a particular chapter as a whole. Because of this practice the author's style appears jarringly disjointed at times. Ironically, the logical progression of deductive reasoning, so important to Lighthall's system, is often under stress because of this style.\nThe Lighthall system was an attempt to remarry science and religion in a single philosophical understanding of reality. Within the structure of that system Lighthall claimed to have avoided what he called the \"metaphysical\" problem. He insisted that all that was proposed in the hypothesis was derived from his observation of scientific fact. \nTo be precise Lighthall considered the principles of his theory to be \"proven\" scientific facts and the proof to be founded upon deductive reasoning.\n\nThe system equated Instinct with Will. Further it viewed Will as the manifest cause of both the conscious and unconscious act. Lighthall stated: 'All living action is willing, and all is by nature purposive.'\n\nLighthall informed his readers that it was the phenomenon of the altruistic act that had been the initial \"middle\" ground that had led him to the formulation of the theory:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is a PEN Honorary Member. He has served 17 years in prison on propaganda (trumped up) charges stemming from his writings about the Kurdish population in Turkey.\nBeşikçi studied at the Faculty of Political Sciences of Ankara University, and graduated in 1962. After his military duty he became an assistant professor at Atatürk University in Erzurum. He prepared his first anthropological study, an investigation of one of the last nomadic Kurdish tribes, the Alikan, here, which he submitted in 1967 to the Ankara Faculty of Political Sciences. \n\nHis second encounter with the Kurds was during his military service when he served in Bitlis and Hakkâri where he first saw the nomadic Alikan tribe pass through Bitlis on their migrations from winter to summer meadows and back.\nHis book \"The order of East Anatolia\", first published in 1969, in which he sought to adapt and apply Marxist concepts to the analysis of Kurdish society and to the processes of socio-economic and political change taking place, made him a public enemy. While the book did not cause much debate either in academic or left intellectual circles, the university took disciplinary measures against him which would lead to a trial after the 1971 coup. He was detained and put on trial for communist and anti-national propaganda where he was sentenced to 13 years imprisonment for violating the indivisibility of the Turkish nation.\n\nBeşikçi did not have to serve his full 13 years and benefited amnesty in late 1974. He unsuccessfully applied for a position at the Faculty of Political Sciences in Ankara, which in 1970 had appeared willing to employ him. He never found academic employment again and was henceforth to do his research as an independent scholar, in economically precarious circumstances. \n\nFor many years, Ismail Beşikçi was the only non-Kurdish person in Turkey to speak out loud and clearly in defense of the rights of the Kurds. Continuing to write and speak in spite of all attempts to silence him, Beşikçi has become a powerful and important symbol for the Kurds and for the human rights movement of Turkey.He was charged for over 100 years but released from jail in 1999. In 1987 he was a candidate for the Nobel Peace Prize. 32 of the 36 books that he has published have been banned in Turkey.\n\nHe has been described as \"modern Turkey's pioneer of Kurdish studies\".\nIn 2010 he was again prosecuted, this time by the attorney general of Istanbul for “PKK propaganda” on account of an article on \"The rights of the nations to self-determination and the Kurds\" that he wrote for the \"Association of Contemporary Lawyers\".\n\nIsmail Besikci has authored several important works on Kurdish social organization and the continuing plight of Kurds today. His most famous work is International Colony Kurdistan. Besikci argues that the Turkish state has been practicing a policy of genocide against Kurds over the past 80 years. International Colony Kurdistan is probably Besikci's most open critique of the present division of Kurdistan, an ethnically contagious area (mainly) between Turkey, Iran and Iraq - with a Kurdish population of several million people. Besikci argues that, for all their political differences, there is a longstanding understanding between these regional states to deny Kurds the right of self-determination and nationhood. Ismail Besikci's International Colony Kurdistan was originally published in 1991 and led to the imprisonment of the author in Turkey. The book remains a roadmap for our understanding of Kurdistan today.\n\n"}
