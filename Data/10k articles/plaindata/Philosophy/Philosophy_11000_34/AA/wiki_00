His Arabic name (Nisba) indicates that he lived in Kalabadh (a district of Bukhara) and was probably of Persian ancestry. Depending on the source, he died in 990, 994 or 995. His grave in Bukhara still receives many visitors.\n\nKalabadhi studied Sufism under Abu al-Husayn al-Farisi and Fiqh under Muhammad ibn Fadl.\n\nOf his six or seven works, two in Arabic survive:\n\nAl-Kalabadhi's fame rests on the \"Kitab at-ta'arruf\". The work itself consists of 75 relatively short chapters, but several long commentaries have been appended. The work was written primarily for two purposes: to advocate the Sahu (\"sober\") school of Sufi thought and to assure adherents of orthodox Islam that Sufism does not contradict their beliefs. The second point was of special importance, as Sufism was in danger of being declared a heresy.\n\nNot long before, in 922, the famous Sufi al-Hallaj had been publicly executed on allegations of heresy. This must have had a significant effect on al-Kalabadhi. He quotes al-Hallaj frequently in his works, but never by name. He is simply referred to as \"one of the great Sufis\".\n\nThe book is still understandable for modern readers and preserves many important quotes from the first three hundred years of Islam.\n\n"}
{"id": "1560959", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1560959", "title": "Aggadah", "text": "Aggadah\n\nAggadah (Jewish Babylonian Aramaic אַגָּדְתָא‎ \"tales, lore\"; pl. \"aggadot\", Ashkenazi pronunciation \"aggados\") refers to non-legalistic exegetical texts in the classical rabbinic literature of Judaism, particularly as recorded in the Talmud and Midrash. In general, Aggadah is a compendium of rabbinic texts that incorporates folklore, historical anecdotes, moral exhortations, and practical advice in various spheres, from business to medicine.\n\nIn terms of etymology, the cognate means \"telling\", while the Aramaic root אגד (as well as נגד, from which אגדה may arise) has the dual implication of “expanding” / “drawing out” and “binding” / “drawing in”. Correspondingly, the Aggadah may be seen as those teachings which communicate Rabbinic traditions to the reader, simultaneously expanding their understanding of the text, while strengthening their religious experience and spiritual connection. The root also has the meaning \"flow\", and here relates to the transmission of ideas.\n\nThe Aggadah is part of Judaism's Oral law ()—the traditions providing the authoritative interpretation of the Written Law. In this context, the widely held view in rabbinic literature is that the aggadah is in fact a medium for the transmission of fundamental teachings (Homiletic Sayings—) or for explanations of verses in the Tanakh (Exegetic Sayings—). In Rabbinic thought, therefore, much of the Aggadah is understood as containing a hidden, allegorical dimension, in addition to its overt, literal sense. In general, where a literal interpretation contradicts rationality, the Rabbis seek an allegorical explanation: \"We are told to use our common sense to decide whether an aggada is to be taken literally or not\" (Carmell, 2005).\n\nRabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzatto, the \"Ramchal\", discusses this two-tiered, literal-allegorical mode of transmission of the Aggadah in his well-known \"Discourse on the Haggadot\". He explains that the Oral Law, in fact, comprises two components: the legal component (), discussing the mitzvot and halakha; and \"the secret\" component (), discussing the deeper teachings. The aggadah, along with the Kabbalah, falls under the latter. The rabbis of the Mishnahic era believed that it would be dangerous to record the deeper teachings in explicit, mishnah-like, medium. Rather, they would be conveyed in a \"concealed mode\" and via \"paradoxes\". (Due to their value, these teachings should not become accessible to those \"of bad character\" and due to their depth they should not be made available to those \"not schooled in the ways of analysis\".) This mode of the transmission was nevertheless based on consistent rules and principles such that those \"equipped with the keys\" would be able to unlock their meaning; to others they would appear as non-rational or fantastic.\n\nIn line with the above, Samuel ibn Naghrillah, in his \"Introduction to the Talmud\", states that \"Aggadah comprises any comment occurring in the Talmud on any topic which is not a commandment (i.e. which is not halachic) and one should derive from it only that which is reasonable.\" As regards this, Maimonides, in his preface to the eleventh chapter of Tractate Sanhedrin (\"Perek Chelek\"), describes three possible approaches to the interpretation of the Aggadah.\n\n\nNote that Maimonides' approach is also widely held amongst the non-rationalistic, mystical streams of Judaism—thus, for example, Rabbi Isaiah Horowitz, the \"Shlah HaKodosh\" holds that \"none of these sometimes mind-boggling 'stories' are devoid of profound meaning; if anyone is devoid of understanding, it is the reader\" (\"Shnei Luchos HaBris\", introduction).\n\nThe aggadah is today recorded in the Midrash and the Talmud.\n\nIn the Midrash, the aggadic and halakhic material are compiled as two distinct collections: 1) The Aggadic Midrashim, generally, are explanatory aggada, deriving the \"sermonic implications\" from the biblical text; and 2) the Halakhic Midrashim derive the laws from the text. Many of the Torah commentaries, and the Targumim, interpret the Torah text in the light of Aggadic statements, particularly those in the Midrash, and hence contain much material on Aggadah interpretation.\n\nThroughout the Talmud, aggadic and halakhic material are interwoven—legal material comprises around 90%. (Tractate Avoth, which has no gemara, deals exclusively with non-halakhic material, though it is not regarded as aggadic in that it is focused, largely, on character development.) The Talmudic aggada, generally, convey the \"deeper teachings\"—though in concealed mode, as discussed. The aggadic material in the Babylonian Talmud is also presented separately in \"Ein Yaakov\", a compilation of the Aggadah together with commentaries.\n\nWell-known works interpreting the Aggadot in the Talmud include:\n\n\nThe Aggadah has been preserved in a series of different works, which, like all works of traditional literature, have come to their present form through previous collections and revisions. Their original forms existed long before they were reduced to writing.\n\nThe first traces of the midrashic exegesis are found in the Bible itself; while in the time of the Soferim the development of the Midrash Aggadah received a mighty impetus, and the foundations were laid for public services which were soon to offer the chief medium for the cultivation of Bible exegesis.\n\nMuch Aggadah, often mixed with foreign elements, is found in the Apocrypha, the Pseudepigrapha, the works of Josephus and Philo, and the remaining Judæo-Hellenistic literature; but aggadic exegesis reached its highest development in the great epoch of the Mishnaic-Talmudic period, between 100 and 550 CE.\n\nThe Aggadah of the Amoraim (sages of the Talmud) is the continuation of that of the Tannaim (sages of the Mishna). The final edition of the Mishnah, which was of such signal importance for the Halakah, is of less significance for the Aggadah, which, in form as well as in content, shows the same characteristics in both periods.\n\nIt is important to emphasize the fundamental difference in plan between the midrashim forming a running commentary (מאמרים ביאוריים) to the Scripture text, and the homiletic midrashim (מאמרים לימודיים). When the scholars undertook to edit, revise, and collect into individual midrashim the immense array of haggadot, they followed the method employed in the collections and revisions of the halakhot and the halakhic discussions. The form which suggested itself was to arrange in textual sequence the exegetical interpretations of the Biblical text as taught in the schools, or the occasional interpretations introduced into public discourses, etc., and which were in any way connected with Scripture. Since the work of the editor was often merely that of compilation, the existing midrashim show in many passages the character of the sources from which they were taken. This was the genesis of the midrashim which are in the nature of running haggadic commentaries to single books of the Bible, as Bereshit Rabbah, Eikah Rabbati, the midrashim to the other Megillot, etc. See Midrash for more details.\n\nThe \"Ein Yaakov\" is a compilation of the aggadic material in the Babylonian Talmud together with commentary. It was compiled by Jacob ibn Habib and (after his death) by his son Rabbi Levi ibn Habib, and was first published in Saloniki (Greece) in 1515. It was intended as a text of aggadah, that could be studied with \"the same degree of seriousness as the Talmud itself\". Popularized anthologies did not appear until more recently—these often incorporate \"aggadot\" from outside of classical Rabbinic literature. The major works include:\n\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\nDiscussion\n\nSource Material\n\nTextual resources\n"}

It is specifically opposed to yellow shamanism, which incorporates rituals and traditions from Buddhism.\n\nBuddhism entered Mongolia in the sixteenth century after the conversion of Altan Khan. In 1691, after Outer Mongolia had been annexed by the Qing Dynasty, Buddhism became the dominant religion of the entire area and shamanism began incorporating Buddhist elements. Violent resistance in the eighteenth century by the hunting tribes of Northern Mongolia against the (Buddhist) ruling group, the Khalka Mongols, led to the foundation of black shamanism.\n\nKlaus Hesse described the complex spiritual hierarchy in clan-based Mongolian society based on sources that go back to the 13th century. The highest group in the pantheon consisted of 99 \"tngri\" (55 of them benevolent or \"white\" and 44 terrifying or \"black\"), 77 \"natigai\" or \"earth-mothers\", besides others. The \"tngri\" were called upon only by leaders and great shamans and were common to all the clans. After these, three groups of ancestral spirits dominated. The \"Lord-Spirits\" were the souls of clan leaders to whom any member of a clan could appeal for physical or spiritual help. The \"Protector-Spirits\" included the souls of great shamans (\"ĵigari\") and shamanesses (\"abĵiya\"). The \"Guardian-Spirits\" were made up of the souls of smaller shamans (\"böge\") and shamanesses (\"idugan\") and were associated with a specific locality (including mountains, rivers, etc.) in the clan's territory.\n\nThe difference between great, white and small, black (in shamans, \"tngri\", etc.) was also formative in a class division of three further groups of spirits, made up of \"spirits who were not introduced by shamanist rites into the communion of ancestral spirits\" but who could nonetheless be called upon for help—they were called \"'the three accepting the supplications' (\"jalbaril-un gurban\")\". The whites were of the nobles of the clan, the blacks of the commoners, and a third category consisted of \"the evil spirits of the slaves and non-human goblins\". White shamans could only venerate white spirits (and if they called upon black spirits they \"lost their right in venerating and calling the white spirits\"), black shamans only black spirits (and would be too terrified to call upon white spirits since the black spirits would punish them). Black or white was assigned to spirits according to social status, and to shamans \"according to the capacity and assignment of their ancestral spirit or spirit of the shaman's descent line.\"\n\nAccording to Otgony Purev, the practice goes back to Genghis Khan and was practiced by the Darkhad people in defiance of the Buddhism introduced to the area by the Khalka. During the Soviet domination of the Mongolian People's Republic, all varieties of shamanism were repressed; after 1991, when the era of Soviet influence was over, religion (including Buddhism and shamanism) made a comeback.\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n"}

They are also known as the four immeasurables (Sanskrit: \"apramāṇa\", Pāli: \"appamaññā\"). The \"Brahma-viharas\" are: \n\nAccording to the \"Metta Sutta\", cultivation of the four immeasurables has the power to cause the practitioner to be reborn into a \"Brahmā realm\" (Pāli: \"Brahmaloka\"). \n\nThe \"Brahma-viharas\", along with meditative tradition associated with \"Brahma-vihara\", are also found in pre-Buddha and post-Buddha Vedic and Sramanic literature.\n\n\n\"Brahmavihāra\" may be parsed as \"Brahmā\" and \"vihāra\"; which is often rendered into English as \"sublime\" or \"divine abodes\".\n\n\"Apramāṇa\", usually translated as \"the immeasurables,\" means \"boundlessness, infinitude, a state that is illimitable\". When developed to a high degree in meditation, these attitudes are said to make the mind \"immeasurable\" and like the mind of the loving \"Brahmā\" (gods).\n\nOther translations: \n\nThe four \"Brahma-vihara\" are: \n\nThe \"Brahma-vihara\" are a pre-Buddhist concept, to which the Buddhist tradition gave its own interpretation. The \"Digha Nikaya\" asserts the Buddha to be calling the Brahmavihara as \"that practice\", and he then contrasts it with \"my practice\" as follows:\nAccording to Gombrich, the Buddhist usage of the \"brahma-vihāra\" originally referred to an awakened state of mind, and a concrete attitude toward other beings which was equal to \"living with Brahman\" here and now. The later tradition took those descriptions too literally, linking them to cosmology and understanding them as \"living with Brahman\" by rebirth in the Brahma-world. According to Gombrich, \"the Buddha taught that kindness - what Christians tend to call love - was a way to salvation.\n\nIn the \"Tevijja Sutta\", The Threefold Knowledge of the \"Digha Nikaya\" set of scriptures, Buddha Shākyamuni is asked the way to fellowship/companionship/communion with Brahma. He replies that he personally knows the world of Brahma and the way to it, and explains the meditative method for reaching it by using an analogy of the resonance of the conch shell of the \"aṣṭamaṅgala\":\nThe Buddha then says that the monk must follow this up with an equal suffusion of the entire world with mental projections of compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity (regarding all beings with an eye of equality).\n\nIn the two \"Metta Suttas\" of the \"Aṅguttara Nikāya,\" the Buddha states that those who practice radiating the four immeasurables in this life and die \"without losing it\" are destined for rebirth in a heavenly realm in their next life. In addition, if such a person is a Buddhist disciple (Pāli: \"sāvaka\") and thus realizes the three characteristics of the five aggregates, then after his heavenly life, this disciple will reach \"nibbāna\". Even if one is not a disciple, one will still attain the heavenly life, after which, however depending on what his past deeds may have been, one may be reborn in a hell realm, or as an animal or hungry ghost.\n\nIn another sutta in the Aṅguttara Nikāya, the laywoman Sāmāvatī is mentioned as an example of someone who excels at loving-kindness. In the Buddhist tradition she is often referred to as such, often citing an account that an arrow shot at her was warded off through her spiritual power.\n\nThe four immeasurables are explained in \"The Path of Purification\" (\"Visuddhimagga\"), written in the fifth century CE by the scholar and commentator Buddhaghoṣa. They are often practiced by taking each of the immeasurables in turn and applying it to oneself (a practice taught by many contemporary teachers and monastics that was established after the Pali Suttas were completed), and then to others nearby, and so on to everybody in the world, and to everybody in all universes.\n\n\"A Cavern of Treasures\" () is a Bonpo \"terma\" uncovered by Shenchen Luga () in the early eleventh century. A segment of it enshrines a Bonpo evocation of the four immeasurables. Martin (n.d.: p. 21) identifies the importance of this scripture for studies of the Zhang-Zhung language.\n\nPrior to the advent of the Buddha, according to Martin Wiltshire, the pre-Buddhist traditions of \"Brahma-loka\", meditation and these four virtues are evidenced in both early Buddhist and non-Buddhist literature. The early Buddhist texts assert that pre-Buddha ancient Indian sages who taught these virtues were earlier incarnations of the Buddha. Post-Buddha, these same virtues are found in the Hindu texts such as verse 1.33 of the \"Yoga Sutras of Patañjali\".\n\nThree of the four immeasurables, namely Maitri, Karuna and Upeksha, are found in the early Upanishads of Hinduism, while all four are found with slight variations – such as \"pramoda\" instead of \"mudita\" – in Jainism literature, states Wiltshire. The ancient Indian \"Paccekabuddhas\" mentioned in the early Buddhist Suttas, those who lived before the Buddha, mention all \"four immeasurables\" and Brahmavihara, and they are claimed in the Suttas to be previous incarnations of the Buddha.\n\nAccording to Peter Harvey, the Buddhist scriptures acknowledge that the four \"Brahmavihara\" meditation practices \"did not originate within the Buddhist tradition\". The Buddha never claimed that the \"four immeasurables\" were his unique ideas, in a manner similar to \"cessation, quieting, nirvana\".\n\nThe pre-Buddha Chandogya Upanishad, states Jayatilleke, in section 8.15 teaches metta and ahimsa to all creatures claiming that this practice leads to \"Brahmaloka\". The shift in Vedic ideas, from rituals to virtues, is particularly discernible in the early Upanishadic thought, and it is unclear as to what extent and how early Upanishadic traditions of Hinduism and Sramanic traditions such as Buddhism and Jainism influenced each other, on ideas such as \"four immeasurables\", meditation and Brahmavihara.\n\nIn an authoritative Jain scripture, the Tattvartha Sutra (Chapter 7, sutra 11), there is a mention of four right sentiments: Maitri, pramoda, karunya, madhyastha:\n\n\n\n"}

Between 1968 and 1990 he worked as a researcher at the Research Centre on Youth in Bucharest, Romania.

He has republished 30 titles of Romanian works - a lot of them for the first time since first edition\n\nHe has contribution in modernisation and development sociology, in age and generations sociology, in the study of Romanian thinkers, and especially Constantin Rădulescu-Motru. For instance, he has examined the outlook of Rădulescu-Motru about philosophy of Kant.\n\nSchifirneţ is one of the first Romanian researchers who have scientifically researched the topic of mass media and brought a valuable contribution to the development of this subject in the Romanian research literature before 1989. Since 1968, he has conducted several academic studies on the impact of mass communication on public opinion formation. Schifirneţ has coordinated in 1969, empirical research 'Opinions of students', first sociological research in Romania on a national sample. A summary of the findings of this research was published in the volume 'Student and Society' (coordinators F. Mahler, A. Mihu, C. Schifirnet), 1973. In 1971, together with Ovidiu Bădina, he coordinated the volume Youth and Mass Media.\n\nIn his book, “Generaţie şi cultură” (Generation and Culture, 1985), Schifirneţ defined culture through a series of antagonist categories such as: classic culture - modern culture, traditional culture - mass media culture, and generation culture - global culture. He identified the interferences between different levels of culture and also the multiple relationships between the cultural behavior of a social group and various types of culture. His approach on the term of generation allowed him to develop the sociology of age and generations that was lacking from the Romanian sociological literature of that time. In his works, he demonstrated the existence of a conflict between generations in the socialist society.\nHis scientific studies on subculture and counterculture (1981, 1985) were the first in the Romanian sociology to approach these two notions. During those years, these concepts were rejected by the Romanian sociologists because of their bourgeois belongings and were considered to be irrelevant in the analysis of the communist society.\nThrough the analysis of the works of major Romanian thinkers, he succeeds in updating relevant concepts related to the term of nation such as: ethnic identity and agents of modernization in the Romanian society. He elaborated a monograph of the “forms without substance” theory in his book Formele fără fond, un brand românesc (The Forms without Substance, a Romanian Brand), 2007.\n\nSchifirneţ has studied historical particularities the modern evolution of Romanians. The modernisation has begun with political institutional construction and not with the building of capitalist economy. The Romanian modernization was against boyars and social traditional structures. But a lot of traditional elements had outlived the new capitalist political-juridical organism from Romanian society. Romania is still a country which faced a late modernization; in the same time it has got many elements of modernity which fail to coagulate stable modern structures in all departments of society. Schifirneţ launched and developed the concept of tendential modernity. This concept explains the role of modernity for building political and legal institutional framework necessary to develop modern nation in a society with underdeveloped economy. Throughout its history, the Romanian state gave priority to the national construction and the problems related to the economic and social development were postponed or subordinated to the national issue. Tendential modernity describes the evolution of modernization processes within the societies that are only partially functional. Schifirneţ thinks that it is useful to analyze the Romanian modernization processes under the notion of tendential modernity. This means the development in the opposite direction: from the affirmation of national spirit and political construction towards economical development. In Romanian society modernity is a trend, which coexists with obsolete institutional forms and ancient substance. Tendential modernity penetrates slowly and hard through the complicated network of socio-institutional structures of the traditional and patriarchal Romanian society. Since it has no clear dominant form, it is a mosaic modernity. Modernity is the framework and the element which supports the Romanian nation, but not by means of economical way, as a basis of a national state. Modernity is a tendency, an ideal in the construction of a nation.\n\n2007: The Romanian Academy Prize for his work \"C. Rãdulescu-Motru. His Life and Activities\".\n\n\n1.

{"id": "8620", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8620", "title": "Dianic Wicca", "text": "Dianic Wicca\n\nDianic Wicca, also known as Dianic Witchcraft, is a neopagan religion of female-centered goddess ritual and tradition. While some adherents identify as Wiccan, it differs from most traditions of Wicca in that only goddesses are honored (whereas most Wiccan traditions honor both female and male deities).\n\nWhile there is more than one tradition that calls itself Dianic, the best known is the female-only variety, founded by Zsuzsanna Budapest in the United States in the 1970s. It is notable for its worship of a single Goddess and focus on egalitarian, matriarchal feminism. It is named after the Roman goddess Diana, but Dianics worship goddesses from many cultures, seeing them as \"aspects\" of a monotheistic goddess. Dianic Wicca is an eclectic combination of elements from British Traditional Wicca, Italian folk-magic as recorded by Charles Leland in \"Aradia\", feminist values, folk magic and healing practices from a variety of different cultures.\n\nDianic Wiccans of the Budapest lineage worship the Goddess, who they see as containing all goddesses, from all cultures; she is seen as the source of all living things and containing all that is within her. Dianic covens practice magic in the form of mediation and visualization in addition to spell work. They focus especially on healing themselves from the wounds of the patriarchy while affirming their own womanhood.\n\nRituals can include reenacting religious and spiritual lore from a feminist standpoint, celebrating the female body, and mourning society's abuses of women. The practice of magic is rooted in the belief that energy or 'life force' can be directed to enact change. However it is important to note that rituals are often improvised to suit individual or group needs and vary from coven to coven. Some Dianic Wiccans eschew manipulative spellwork and hexing because it goes against the Wiccan Rede. However, many other Dianic witches (notably Budapest) do not consider hexing or binding of those who attack women to be wrong, and actively encourage the binding of rapists.\n\nLike other Wiccans, Dianics may form covens, attend festivals, celebrate the eight major Wiccan holidays, and gather on Esbats. They use many of the same altar tools, rituals, and vocabulary as other Wiccans. Dianics may also gather in less formal Circles. The most noticeable difference between the two are that Dianic covens of Budapest lineage are composed entirely of women.\n\nWhen asked why \"men and gods\" are excluded from her rituals, Budapest stated:\n\nThere is therapeutic value inherent in Dianic ritual—many women use it to overcome personal trauma and raise awareness about violence towards women, earning comparisons to feminist consciousness-raising groups in the 1960s and 70s. In fact, some groups develop rituals specifically to confront gendered personal trauma, such as battery, rape, incest, and partner abuse. In one ethnographic study of such a ritual, women shifted their understanding of power from the hands of their abusers to themselves. It was found that this ritual had improved self-perception in participants in the short-term, and that the results could be sustained with ongoing practice. \nDianics pride themselves on the inclusion of lesbian and bisexual members. It is a goal within many covens to explore female sexuality and sensuality outside of male control, and many rituals function to affirm lesbian sexuality, making it a popular tradition for women who have come out. Some covens exclusively consist of same-sex oriented women and advocate lesbian separatism.\n\nDianic Wicca developed from the Women's Liberation Movement and covens traditionally align themselves with radical feminism. These covens reject trans people who were born male. Some groups also directly challenge gender identity.\n\nAradia, or The Gospel of the Witches claims that ancient Diana, Aphrodite, Aradia, and Herodius cults linked to the Sacred Mysteries are the origin of the all-female coven and many witch myths as we know them.\nDianic Wicca began on the Winter Solstice of 1971, when Budapest led a ceremony in Hollywood, California. Self-identifying as a \"hereditary witch,\" and claiming to have learned folk magic from her mother, Budapest is frequently considered the mother of modern Dianic Wiccan tradition. Dianic Wicca itself is named after the Roman goddess of the same name.\n\n\nMcFarland Dianic is a Neopagan tradition of goddess worship founded by Morgan McFarland and Mark Roberts which, despite the shared name, has a different theology and in some cases accepts male participants. McFarland largely bases their tradition on the work of Robert Graves and his book \"The White Goddess\". While some McFarland covens will initiate men, the leadership is limited to female priestesses. Like other Dianic traditions, \"McFarland Dianic covens espouse feminism as an all-important concept.\" They consider the decision whether to include or exclude males as \"solely the choice of [a member coven's] individual High Priestess.\"\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1170055", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1170055", "title": "Dictionnaire philosophique", "text": "Dictionnaire philosophique\n\nThe Dictionnaire philosophique (Philosophical Dictionary) is an encyclopedic dictionary published by Voltaire in 1764. The alphabetically arranged articles often criticize the Roman Catholic Church, Judaism, Islam, and other institutions. The first edition, released in June 1764, went by the name of \"Dictionnaire philosophique portatif\". It was 344 pages and consisted of 73 articles. Later versions were expanded into two volumes consisting of 120 articles. The first editions were published anonymously in Geneva by Gabriel Grasset. Due to the volatile content of the \"Dictionnaire\", Voltaire chose Grasset over his usual publisher to ensure his own anonymity. There were many editions and reprints of the \"Dictionnaire\" during Voltaire's lifetime, but only four of them contained additions and modifications. Furthermore, another work published in 1770, \"Questions sur l'Encyclopédie\", which contained reshaped and modified articles from the Encyclopédie always in alphabetical order, led many following editors to join this and the \"Dictionnaire\" (plus other minor works) in a unique opus.\nThe \"Dictionnaire\" was a lifelong project for Voltaire. It represents the culmination of his views on Christianity, God, morality and other subjects.\n\nThe Enlightenment saw the creation of a new way of structuring information in books. The first work to employ this method was the \"Dictionnaire Historique et Critique\" (1697) by Pierre Bayle, in which the information is ordered alphabetically. Other important works using a similar structure followed, such as the \"Encyclopédie\" by Diderot and Jean d'Alembert. Having witnessed first-hand the popularity and many advantages of this form, Voltaire used this information while preparing the \"Philosophical Dictionary\" in 1752, although it was not completed until 1764.\n\nHaving had the opportunity to write his \"Dictionary\" at a later point in time, Voltaire saw that there were certain problems with previous dictionaries, chiefly that they were all lengthy, and thus very expensive and unaccessible for much of the population. Voltaire sought to create a text which would fit in one's pocket and be affordable because \"revolutionary material must be small enough for people to carry with them\". What he created is a text which educated and amused at the same time.\n\nVoltaire's motivations for writing the \"Philosophical Dictionary\" can be seen as serendipitous. The idea was spawned at a dinner party in the court of Prince Frederick II of Prussia in 1752, during which he and other guests each agreed to write an article and share them the next morning. Voltaire consequently was the only guest to take the game seriously and the idea cascaded to form the \"Philosophical Dictionary\".\n\nThe \"Philosophical Dictionary\" is structured in the tradition of Bayle, Diderot and d'Alembert — that is to say, alphabetically ordered. Although this order helps readers more easily find articles, this was not meant to be a dictionary or encyclopaedia in the same totalizing way of d'Alembert's project. Voltaire's writing is neither objective nor varied in opinion; the same arguments are made throughout the \"Philosophical Dictionary\" emphasizing the point of his discontent.\n\nMany of the themes addressed by Voltaire in this book are addressed or touched upon in his work \"L'Infame\". In this and other works, Voltaire is very concerned about the injustices of the Catholic Church, which he sees as intolerant and fanatical. At the same time, his work espouses deism, tolerance and freedom of the press.\n\nBecause this work was written late in the author's life, coupled with the fact that it is compiled of articles written over an extended period of time, the work had many influences, which noticeably change, depending on the theme which the article addresses.\nThe first major influence on the \"Philosophical Dictionary\" is Voltaire's visit to England, which gave him the opportunity to compare the problems in France with a place that had free press and to become better acquainted with important and influential thinkers such as Locke and Newton. Newtonian theory is influential in many of the articles that deal with tolerance stating that if we \"do not know the essence of things we will not persecute others\", for those things.\n\nThe Calas affair was an event that shaped Voltaire during the creation of the \"Philosophical Dictionary\". Jean Calas was a Calvinist who was wrongfully convicted of killing his son. This occurred because there had been a rumour that the murder was fueled by Calas' son conversion to Catholicism. David de Beaudrige, who was in charge of the case, upon hearing this rumour, had the Calas family arrested without inquiry. Voltaire used this theme in the \"Philosophical Dictionary\" to fight against the Catholic Church.\n\nThe reception of the \"Philosophical Dictionary\" at the time was mixed. On one hand, the book saw a very strong reception on the part of the general public. The first edition was quickly sold out; many more editions were needed to keep up with the demand. Enlightened rulers such as Frederick II of Prussia and Catherine II of Russia both have been recorded as supporters of the book.\n\nOn the other hand, the \"Philosophical Dictionary\" was despised by religious authorities, who had a very important influence over what works were to be censored. The \"Philosophical Dictionary\" was censored in many countries, including Switzerland (Geneva) and France. In these countries, all available copies of the book were collected and burned in the town square. Voltaire, who remained an anonymous author, was repeatedly asked if he minded that the \"Portatif\" was being burned, but he calmly replied that he had no reason to be upset.\n\nOf the many editions just four of them present additions:\n"}

The earliest time that life forms first appeared on Earth is unknown. They may have lived earlier than 3.77 billion years ago, possibly as early as 4.28 billion years ago, or nearly 4.5 billion years ago according to some; in any regards, not long after the oceans formed 4.41 billion years ago, and not long after the formation of the Earth 4.54 billion years ago. The earliest \"direct\" evidence of life on Earth are microfossils of microorganisms permineralized in 3.465-billion-year-old Australian Apex chert rocks.\n\nA life form, or lifeform, is an entity or being that is living.\n\nCurrently, Earth remains the only place in the universe known to harbor life forms.\n\nMore than 99% of all species of life forms, amounting to over five billion species, that ever lived on Earth are estimated to be extinct.\n\nSome estimates on the number of Earth's current species of life forms range from 10 million to 14 million, of which about 1.2 million have been documented and over 86 percent have not yet been described. However, a May 2016 scientific report estimates that 1 trillion species are currently on Earth, with only one-thousandth of one percent described. The total number of DNA base pairs on Earth is estimated at 5.0 x 10 with a weight of 50 billion tonnes. In comparison, the total mass of the biosphere has been estimated to be as much as 4 trillion tons of carbon. In July 2016, scientists reported identifying a set of 355 genes from the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA) of all organisms living on Earth.\n\nThe Earth's biosphere includes soil, hydrothermal vents, and rock up to or deeper underground, the deepest parts of the ocean, and at least high into the atmosphere. Under certain test conditions, life forms have been observed to thrive in the near-weightlessness of space and to survive in the vacuum of outer space. Life forms appear to thrive in the Mariana Trench, the deepest spot in the Earth's oceans, reaching a depth of . Other researchers reported related studies that life forms thrive inside rocks up to below the sea floor under of ocean, off the coast of the northwestern United States, as well as beneath the seabed off Japan. In August 2014, scientists confirmed the existence of life forms living below the ice of Antarctica.\n\nAccording to one researcher, \"You can find microbes everywhere — [they are] extremely adaptable to conditions, and survive wherever they are.\"\n\nFossil evidence informs most studies of the origin of life. The age of the Earth is about 4.54 billion years; the earliest undisputed evidence of life on Earth dates from at least 3.5 billion years ago. There is evidence that life began much earlier.\n\nIn 2017, fossilized microorganisms, or microfossils, were announced to have been discovered in hydrothermal vent precipitates in the Nuvvuagittuq Belt of Quebec, Canada that may be as old as 4.28 billion years old, the oldest record of life on Earth, suggesting \"an almost instantaneous emergence of life\" (in a geological time-scale sense), after ocean formation 4.41 billion years ago, and not long after the formation of the Earth 4.54 billion years ago. Nonetheless, life may have started even earlier, at nearly 4.5 billion years ago, as claimed by some researchers.\n\n\"Remains of life\" have been found in 4.1 billion-year-old rocks in Western Australia.\n\nEvidence of biogenic graphite, and possibly stromatolites, were discovered in 3.7 billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks in southwestern Greenland.\n\nIn May 2017, evidence of life on land may have been found in 3.48 billion-year-old geyserite which is often found around hot springs and geysers, and other related mineral deposits, uncovered in the Pilbara Craton of Western Australia. This complements the November 2013 publication that microbial mat fossils had been found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone in Western Australia.\n\nIn November 2017, a study by the University of Edinburgh suggested that life on Earth may have originated from biological particles carried by streams of space dust.\n\nA December 2017 report stated that 3.465-billion-year-old Australian Apex chert rocks once contained microorganisms, the earliest \"direct\" evidence of life on Earth.\n\nIn January 2018, a study found that 4.5 billion-year-old meteorites found on Earth contained liquid water along with prebiotic complex organic substances that may be ingredients for life.\n\nAccording to biologist Stephen Blair Hedges, \"If life arose relatively quickly on Earth … then it could be common in the universe.\"\n\n"}

The Gaia hypothesis holds that the entire earth may be considered a single organism (Gaia). As a self-maintaining organism, Earth would have an immune system of some sort in order to maintain its health.\n\nSome proponents of this speculative concept, for example, hold that humankind can be considered an \"infection\" of Gaia, and that AIDS is an attempt by this immune system to reject the infection. \n\"Cancer\" might be a more accurate term, as humans evolved within Gaia, and are not external invaders.\nAn opposite view is that humankind is Gaia's immune system itself, perhaps evolved to avert future catastrophes such as the Permian and Cretaceous mass extinctions of species.\n\nJames Lovelock's book \"The Revenge of Gaia\" suggests that Gaia has many mechanisms for eliminating civilizations that do harm through greenhouse gas emissions and global warming, but suggests that with increasing heat being received from the sun, Gaia's ability to \"bounce back\" as it did after the Permian and Cretaceous extinction events, may be increasingly compromised.\n\nPaul Hawken suggests in \"Blessed Unrest\" that when Earth is considered a living system then Earth's immune system is made up of the million or so organizations all around the globe that are working for social justice, the environment, and indigenous people's rights. Many of these groups are linked through the Internet and other means so there is a vast network of interconnected people and groups working to protect the planet, its people, and all beings. For example, one organization that serves to link groups working on sustainable energy is Inforse in Denmark.\n\n\n\n"}

While Konrad Zuse's book, \"Calculating Space\" (1969), mentioned the importance of reversible computation, the Fredkin gate represented the essential breakthrough. In recent work, he uses the term Digital philosophy (DP).\n\nDuring his career, Fredkin served on the faculties of Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Computer Science, was a Fairchild Distinguished Scholar at Caltech, and was Research Professor of Physics at Boston University, Massachusetts.\n\nAt age 19, Fredkin left California Institute of Technology (Caltech) college after a year to join the United States Air Force (USAF) to become a fighter pilot.\n\nFredkin has worked with a number of companies in the computer field and has held academic positions at a number of universities. He is a computer programmer, a pilot, an advisor to businesses and governments, and a physicist. His main interests concern digital computer-like models of basic processes in physics.\n\nFredkin's field was physics; however, he became involved with computers in 1956 when he was sent by the Air Force, where he had trained as a jet pilot, to the MIT Lincoln Laboratory. On completing his service, in 1958, Fredkin was hired by J. C. R. Licklider to work at the research firm, Bolt Beranek & Newman (BBN). After seeing the PDP-1 prototype at the Eastern Joint Computer Conference in Boston, Massachusetts, in December 1959, Fredkin recommended that BBN purchase the very first PDP-1 to support research projects at BBN. The PDP-1 came with no software whatsoever.\n\nFredkin wrote a PDP-1 assembler called FRAP (Free of Rules Assembly Program); also sometimes called Fredkin's Assembly Program, and the first operating system (OS). He organized and founded a user group called DECUS, and he participated in early projects using the PDP-1. Working with Ben Gurley, the designer of the PDP-1, Fredkin designed significant modifications to the PDP-1. He invented and designed the first modern interrupt system, which Digital called the \"Sequence Break\". He went on to become a contributor in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI).\n\nIn 1968, Fredkin returned to academia, starting at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) as a full professor. From 1971 to 1974, Fredkin was the Director of Project MAC at MIT. He spent a year at Caltech as a Fairchild Distinguished Scholar, working with Richard Feynman, and was a Professor of Physics at Boston University, Massachusetts, for 6 years.\n\nMore recently, Fredkin has been a Distinguished Career Professor of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). and also a Visiting Scientist at MIT Media Laboratory. He is currently associated with CMU.\n\nFredkin founded Information International Inc. in 1961, and has served as the founder or CEO of a diverse set of companies, including Information International, Three Rivers Computer Corporation, and New England Television Corporation (owner of Boston's then CBS affiliate, WNEV, channel 7), The Reliable Water Company (manufacturer of advanced Sea Water Desalination Plants).\n\nFredkin has been broadly interested in computation: hardware and software. He is the inventor of the trie data structure, radio transponders for vehicle identification, the concept of computer navigation for automobiles, the Fredkin gate and the Billiard-Ball Computer Model for reversible computing. He has also been involved in computer vision, chess, and other areas of Artificial Intelligence research. Fredkin also works at the intersection of theoretical issues in the physics of computation and computational models of physics. He invented the SALT Cellular Automata family. Dan Miller designed and programmed the Busy Boxes implementation of Salt, with assistance from Suresh Kumar Devanathan. The early SALT models are 2+1 dimensional quasi-physical, reversible, universal cellular automata, that are 2nd order in time and that follow rules that model CPT reversibility..\n\nWhile at MIT, Fredkin served as the Director of the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science (LCS), which later merged with the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory to become CSAIL. Fredkin has also had an association with Carnegie Mellon for a number of years. His current academic interests are in the area Digital Mechanics, which is the study of discrete models of fundamental process in Physics.\n\nA profile of Fredkin, along with a readable explanation of some of his theories, can be found in the first part of \"Three Scientists and Their Gods\" by Robert Wright (1988). The section of the book covering Fredkin was excerpted in \"The Atlantic Monthly\" in April 1988.\n\nOn May 19, 2004, only seven months after the start of the PDP-1 Restoration Project, chaired by Edward Fredkin, a team of Computer History Museum volunteers flipped the 'on' switch on a 1963 Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) PDP-1 computer. Nearly 45 years after it was made, the machine jumped to life!\n\nDigital philosophy (DP) is one type of digital physics/pancomputationalism. The school of philosophy called pancomputationalism claims that all the physical processes of nature are forms of computation or information processing at the most fundamental level of reality. Pancomputationalism is related to several larger schools of philosophy: atomism, determinism, mechanism, monism, naturalism, philosophical realism, reductionism, and scientific empiricism.\n\nPancomputationalists believe that biology reduces to chemistry reduces to physics reduces to the computation of information. Fredkin's career and achievements have much of their motivation in digital philosophy, a particular type of pancomputationalism described in Fredkin's papers: \"Introduction to Digital Philosophy\", \"On the Soul\", \"Finite Nature\", \"A New Cosmogony\", and \"Digital Mechanics\".\n\nFredkin's Digital philosophy contains several fundamental ideas: Everything in physics and physical reality must have a digital informational representation. All changes in physical nature are consequences of digital informational processes. Nature is finite and digital. The traditional Judaeo-Christian concept of the soul has a counterpart in a static/dynamic soul defined in terms of digital philosophy.\n\nAccording to biographer Robert Wright, the character Stephen Falken in the film, \"WarGames\", was modeled after Fredkin.\n\nIn 1984, Edward was awarded the 'Dickson Prize in Science', which is awarded annually to the person who has been judged by Carnegie Mellon University to have made the most progress in the scientific field in the United States during that year.\n\nIn Fredkin's honor, Carnegie Mellon University has established the Fredkin professorship.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "178362", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=178362", "title": "Ethical code", "text": "Ethical code\n\nEthical codes are adopted by organizations to assist members in understanding the difference between 'right' and 'wrong' and in applying that understanding to their decisions. An ethical code generally implies documents at three levels: codes of business ethics, codes of conduct for employees, and codes of professional practice.\n\nMany companies use the phrases \"ethical code\" and \"code of conduct\" interchangeably but it may be useful to make a distinction. A code of ethics will start by setting out the values that underpin the code and will describe a company's obligation to its stakeholders. The code is publicly available and addressed to anyone with an interest in the company's activities and the way it does business. It will include details of how the company plans to implement its values and vision, as well as guidance to staff on ethical standards and how to achieve them. However, a code of conduct is generally addressed to and intended for employees alone. It usually sets out restrictions on behavior, and will be far more compliance or rules focused than value or principle focused.\n\nA code of practice is adopted by a profession or by a governmental or non-governmental organization to regulate that profession. A code of practice may be styled as a code of professional responsibility, which will discuss difficult issues, difficult decisions that will often need to be made, and provide a clear account of what behavior is considered \"ethical\" or \"correct\" or \"right\" in the circumstances. In a membership context, failure to comply with a code of practice can result in expulsion from the professional organization. In its 2007 International Good Practice Guidance, \"Defining and Developing an Effective Code of Conduct for Organizations\", the International Federation of Accountants provided the following working definition:\n\"Principles, values, standards, or rules of behavior that guide the decisions, procedures and systems of an organization in a way that (a) contributes to the welfare of its key stakeholders, and (b) respects the rights of all constituents affected by its operations.\"\n\nListed below are a few example statements from the professional codes of the Public Relations Society of America (PRSA) and the Society of Professional Journalists (SPJ):\n\nEthical codes are often adopted by management, not to promote a particular moral theory, but rather because they are seen as pragmatic necessities for running an organization in a complex society in which moral concepts play an important part.\n\nThey are distinct from moral codes that may apply to the culture, education, and religion of a whole society. It is debated whether the politicians should apply a code of ethics, or whether it is a profession entirely discretionary, just subject to compliance with the law: however, recently codes of practice have been approved in this field.\n\nOften, acts that violate ethical codes may also violate a law or regulation and can be punishable at law or by government agency remedies.\n\nEven organizations and communities that may be considered criminal in nature may have ethical codes of conduct, official or unofficial. Examples could include hacker communities, bands of thieves, and street gangs.\n\nThe Jewish Written Torah and Oral Torah comprise the earliest and best preserved ethical code. Adapted to every field of actual day-to-day life for thousands of years, Jewish Halakha is the oldest collective body of religious laws, laws and jurisdictions still in use.\n\nCodes seek to define and delineate the difference between conduct and behavior that is malum in se, malum prohibitum, and good practice. Sometimes ethical codes include sections that are meant to give firm rules, but some offer general guidance, and sometimes the words are merely aspirational.\n\nIn sum, a code of ethics is an attempt to codify \"good and bad behavior\".\n\n\n\n"}

Primarily a performance art, it is also used in education, especially in Waldorf schools, and – as part of anthroposophic medicine – for claimed therapeutic purposes.\n\nThe word \"eurythmy\" stems from Greek roots meaning \"beautiful\" or \"harmonious rhythm\".\n\nThe gestures in the eurythmist's movement repertoire relate to the sounds and rhythms of speech, to the tones and rhythms of music and to \"soul experiences\", such as joy and sorrow. Once these fundamental repertoire elements are learned, they can be composed into free artistic expressions. The eurythmist also cultivates a feeling for the qualities of straight lines and curves, the directions of movement in space (forward, backward, up, down, left, right), contraction and expansion, and color. The element of color is also emphasized both through the costuming, usually given characteristic colors for a piece or part and formed of long, loose fabrics that accentuate the movements rather than the bodily form, and through the lighting, which saturates the space and changes with the moods of the piece.\n\nEurythmy's aim is to bring the artists' expressive movement and both the performers' and audience's feeling experience into harmony with a piece's content; eurythmy is thus sometimes called \"visible music\" or \"visible speech\", expressions that originate with its founder, Rudolf Steiner, who described eurythmy as an \"art of the soul\".\n\nMost eurythmy today is performed to classical (concert) music or texts such as poetry or stories. Silent pieces are also sometimes performed.\n\nWhen performing eurythmy with music (also called \"tone eurythmy\"), the three major elements of music, melody, harmony and rhythm, are all expressed. The melody is primarily conveyed through expressing its rise and fall; the specific pitches; and the intervallic qualities present. Harmony is expressed through movement between tension and release, as expressions of dissonance and consonance, and between the more inwardly directed minor mood and the outwardly directed major mood. Rhythm is chiefly conveyed through livelier and more contoured movements for quick notes, slower, dreamier movements for longer notes; in addition, longer tones move into the more passive (listening) back space, quicker tones into the more active front space.\n\nBreaths or pauses are expressed through a larger or smaller movement in space, giving new impulse to what follows. Beat is conveyed through greater emphasis of downbeats, or those beats upon which stress is normally placed. Beat is generally treated as a subsidiary element. Eurythmy has only occasionally been done to popular music, in which beat plays a large role.\n\nThe timbre of individual instruments is brought into the quality both of the tonal gestures and of the whole movement of the eurythmist. Usually there will be a different eurythmist or group of eurythmists expressing each instrument, for example in chamber or symphonic music.\n\nA piece's choreography usually expresses elements such as the major or minor key, the shape of the melody line, the interplay between voices or instruments and the relative dominance of one or another voice or instrument. Thus, musicians can often follow even the finest details of their part in the movements of the eurythmists on stage. Particular musical forms (e.g. the sonata) can have special characteristic choreographic expressions.\n\nEurythmy is often performed with spoken texts such as poetry, stories or plays. \"Speech eurythmy\" includes such elements as the sounds of speech, rhythms, poetic meters, grammar and mood. In speech eurythmy, all the sounds of language have characteristic gestural qualities: the sound of an 'A' is open due to the position of the articulators during the vowel. A 'k' sounds sharper due to the manner of articulation of the consonant, that it is a plosive. Note that it is the audible sounds themselves, not the letters of the written language, that are expressed.\n\nEurythmy was conceived in 1911 when a widow brought her young daughter, Lory Smits, who was interested in movement and dance, to the Austrian philosopher Rudolf Steiner. Due to the recent loss of her father, it was necessary for the girl to find a career. Steiner's advice was sought; he suggested that the girl begin working on a new art of movement. As preparation for this, she began to study human anatomy, to explore the human step, to contemplate the movement implicit in Greek sculpture and dance, and to find movements that would express spoken sentences using the sounds of speech. Soon a number of other young people became interested in this form of expressive movement.\n\nDuring these years, Steiner was writing a new drama each year for performance at the Anthroposophical Society's summer gatherings; beginning in 1912, he began to incorporate the new art of movement into these dramas. When the Society decided to build an artistic center in Dornach, Switzerland (this later became known as the Goetheanum) a small stage group began work and offered weekly performances of the developing art. Marie Steiner-von Sivers, Steiner's wife, who was a trained actress and speech artist, was given responsibility for training and directing this ensemble. This first eurythmy ensemble went on tour in 1919, performing across Switzerland, the Netherlands and Germany.\n\nSteiner saw eurythmy as a unique expression of the anthroposophical impulse:\nAccording to Steiner: \"In eurythmy we present in the form and movement of the human organism a direct external proof of a man's share in the life of the supersensible world. When people do eurythmy they are linked directly with the supersensible world. Whenever art is formed from a truly artistic conviction it bears witness to the connection of the human being with the supersensible world.\" (Dornach, 12 September 1920) \n\nIn 1924, Steiner gave two intensive workshops on different aspects of eurythmy; transcripts of his talks during these workshops are published as \"Eurythmy as Visible Speech\" and \"Eurythmy as Visible Singing\".\n\nEurythmy ensembles in Stuttgart, Germany and at the Goetheanum soon became established parts of the cultural life of Europe. The Goetheanum ensemble was recognized with a gold medal at the Paris Expo of 1937/8. The Stuttgart training and ensemble, led by Else Klink, had to close in the Nazi period but reopened shortly after the close of World War II. There are now training centers and artistic ensembles in many countries.\n\nThe word \"eurythmy\" stems from Greek roots meaning \"beautiful\" or \"harmonious rhythm\". The term was used by Ancient Greek and Roman architects to refer to the harmonious proportions of a design or building; The English word \"eurythmy\" was used from the 17th to 19th century to refer not only to harmonious architectural proportions, but also to \"rhythmical order or movement\" and \"a graceful proportion and carriage of the body\".\n\nThere are notable eurythmy ensembles in Dornach, Switzerland; Stuttgart, Germany; The Hague, Netherlands; London, England; Järna, Sweden, and Chestnut Ridge, New York (near New York City). All of these groups both perform locally and tour internationally. Many smaller performing groups also exist (see list). High schools that have their own performing ensembles include the San Francisco Waldorf High School ensemble.\n\nWhen the first Waldorf School was founded in 1919, eurythmy was included in the curriculum. It was quickly recognized as a successful complement to gymnastics in the school's movement program and is now taught in most Waldorf schools, as well as in many non-Waldorf pre-school centers, kindergartens and schools. It is taught to all ages from pre-schools through high school and into college. Its purpose is to awaken and strengthen the expressive capacities of children through movement, stimulating the child to bring imagination, ideation and conceptualization to the point where they can manifest these as \"vital, moving forms\" in physical space. It is also thought to improve balance, coordination, concentration, rhythm, and form an awareness of patterns.\n\nEurythmy pedagogical exercises begin with the straight line and curve and proceed through successively more complicated geometric figures and choreographed forms, developing a child's coordination and concentration. An extensive set of special exercises has also been developed for pedagogical purposes. These include metamorphosing geometric patterns and dynamic movement sequences.\n\nRods or balls are sometimes used in exercises to develop precision in movement, to expand the experience of space, develop precise balance, and to objectify the movement experience. The rods are usually approximately the length of an arm; the balls are of a size to fit comfortably in one hand. Both are generally made of copper, a material receptive to warmth.\n\nThough there are some independent post-graduate trainings for pedagogical eurythmy, this aspect is frequently included in courses focusing on artistic work.\n\nEurythmy is a component of anthroposophic medicine, a system of alternative medicine which has been criticised as unscientific, pseudoscientific and as \"pure quackery\".\n\nAccording to the precepts of anthroposophic medicine, a human has four aspects which need to be treated: spirit, soul, life and matter. Eurythmy is one of the practices said to act on the \"life\" aspect, and is claimed to effect an \"improvement of health related life functions\". A person receiving eurthymy therapy moves under the guidance of a eurythmy therapist, who will have been trained two years beyond the four-year fundamental course in eurythmy. The movements may be adapted to the condition of the person being treated; for example, they may be done while either sitting or even lying down. Therapeutic eurythmy is claimed to bring about a \"re-integration of body, soul, and spirit.\"\n\nA 2008 review in \"BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine\" said that eurythmy was a \"potentially relevant add-on\" to a therapeutic program, but though the studies reviewed reported improvement in symptoms, limitations in the underlying data and in the review methods means these conclusions \"warrant cautious interpretation\".\n\n\n\n"}

His father died shortly after Heydar's birth. After their eldest son Yusif was killed in an ethnic conflict in 1918, the family moved first to Batumi, then to Stavropol, until they finally settled in Baku where he received secondary education, graduated from the Azerbaijan State Pedagocical Institute with a degree in linguistics in 1931 and a Candidate of Sciences degree in philosophy. He was fluent in Persian. Beginning in 1932, Huseynov taught philosophy at various postsecondary institutions and published his works \"Dialectical Materialism\" (1935) and \"Dialects and metaphysics\" (1939) in Azeri. From 1936 on, he was involved in the publishing of the Azerbaijani Soviet Encyclopædia and in 1940 he became head of the project. He was the editor of the four-volume Russian-Azeri Dictionary, for which he was awarded Stalin Prize, the highest ranking award in the Soviet Union at the time. In 1944, he was appointed Chairman of the Presidium of the National Academy of Sciences of Azerbaijan. Almost simultaneously Huseynov wrote his fundamental 733-page work entitled \"On the history of Azerbaijani phisolophical and sociopolitical thought in the nineteenth century\" (it was published in 1948). His work was recognised with him being granted a doctoral degree along with being promoted to Professor of Marxism-Leninism. In addition, he was awarded with his second Stalin Prize in March 1950. Overall Huseynov wrote around 100 scientific works, mostly having to do with Azerbaijani literary thought.\n\nDespite immediate positive recognition of his prize-winning work, Huseynov's work was met with criticism by the Communist Party organs in May 1950. Huseynov was accused of presenting muridism, a philosophical Sufi movement in the Caucasus in the mid-19th century, and specifically its propagator Imam Shamil, in the preface to his book as a \"progressive democratic national liberation phenomenon (...) contrary to Marxist ideas and (...) the movement's reactionist and nationalist nature that served the interests of the English capitalism and the Turkish sultan.\" Upon reviewing the monograph, the Committee for Stalin Prize in the field of literature and arts forwarded its observations to the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union and as a result, Huseynov was stripped off his award. Huseynov was excluded from the Communist Party and laid off from the Academy of Sciences. Unable to deal with criticism from the state organs and his own colleagues and foreseeing his arrest, Huseynov committed suicide by slicing his veins on 15 August, 1950.\n"}

(c. 1200 – 19 March 1263) was a French Dominican friar who became a cardinal and noted biblical commentator.\n\nHugh was born at Saint-Cher, a suburb of Vienne, Dauphiné, around the beginning of the 13th century. After completing his early \nstudies at a local monastery near his home, at about the age of fourteen, he went to the University of Paris to study philosophy, theology, and jurisprudence, which latter subject he later taught in the same city.\n\nIn 1225, he entered the Dominican priory there and took the religious habit of the recently founded Order. Soon after his admission, he was appointed as Prior Provincial of the Order for France. In 1230 he became Master of Theology and was elected prior of the Paris monastery. During those years, he contributed largely to the Order's success, and won the confidence of Pope Gregory IX, who sent him as a papal legate to Constantinople in 1233.\n\nPope Innocent IV made Hugh a Cardinal Priest in 1244, with his titular church being Santa Sabina, the mother church of the Dominican Order. He then played an important part in the First Council of Lyons, which took place the following year. He contributed to the institution of the Feast of Corpus Christi on the General Roman Calendar. In 1247, upon instructions of Pope Innocent, Hugh revised the Carmelite Rule of St. Albert, which the Saint Albert Avogadro, Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, had given the first Carmelite friars on Mount Carmel. The Holy See felt it necessary to mitigate some of the Rule's more demanding elements to make it more compatible with conditions in Europe. The same pope approved these changes, and this revision remains the Rule for the Carmelite Order. After the death in 1250 of the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II, Pope Innocent sent Hugh to Germany as his legate for the election of a successor.\n\nUnder the authority of Pope Alexander IV, in 1255 Hugh supervised the commission that condemned the \"Introductorius in Evangelium aeternum\" of Gherardino da Borgo San Donnino, which promoted the teachings of Abbot Joachim of Fiore. These teachings worried the bishops as they had become widespread among the \"Spiritual\" wing of the Franciscan friars, to which Gherardino belonged.\n\nHe also supervised the condemnation of William of St Amour's \"De periculis novissimorum temporum\". This work was an expression of the attack on the mendicant Orders, who were becoming so successful in the lives of the universities, by the secular clergy who had previously had unchallenged authority there. Hugh served as Major Penitentiary of the Catholic Church from 1256 to 1262. He was named Cardinal Bishop of Ostia in December 1261, but resigned a few months later and returned to his title of Santa Sabina.\n\nHugh was in residence in Orvieto, Italy, with Pope Urban IV, who had established a long-term residence there, when he died on 19 March 1263.\n\nHugh of St-Cher (or, possibly, a team of scholars under his direction) was the first to compile a so-called \"correctorium\", a collection of variant readings of the Bible. His work, entitled \"Correctio Biblie\", survives in more than a dozen manuscripts.\n\nIn the preface to the \"Correctio Biblie\", Hugh writes that he has collated various Latin versions, biblical commentaries and as well as the Hebrew manuscripts. For his approach to the text of the Bible, he was criciticsed by William de la Mare, author of another \"correctorium\".\n\nWith the aid of many of his Order, he edited a concordance of the Bible (\"Concordantiae Sacrorum Bibliorum\" or \"Concordantiae S. Jacobi\") more thorough than the one attempted by Anthony of Padua. The assertion that we owe the present division of the chapters of the Vulgate to him is false.\n\nHis commentary on Peter Lombard's \"Book of Sentences\" exercised significant influence over subsequent generations of theologians. He also wrote the \"Postillae in sacram scripturam juxta quadruplicem sensum, litteralem, allegoricum, anagogicum et moralem,\" published frequently in the 15th and 16th centuries. His \"Sermones de tempore et sanctis\" are apparently only extracts. His exegetical works were published at Venice in 1754 in eight volumes.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "231943", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=231943", "title": "Humility", "text": "Humility\n\nHumility is the quality of being humble. Dictionary definitions accentuate humility as a low self-regard and sense of unworthiness. In a religious context humility can mean a recognition of self in relation to a deity (i.e. God) or deities, and self-debasement with subsequent submission to said deity as a member of that religion. Outside of a religious context, humility is defined as being \"unselved\", a liberation from consciousness of self, a form of temperance that is neither having pride (or haughtiness) nor indulging in self-deprecation. \n\nHumility is an outward expression of an appropriate inner, or self regard, and is contrasted with humiliation which is an imposition, often external, of shame upon a person. Humility may be misappropriated as ability to suffer humiliation through self-denouncements which in itself remains focus on self rather than low self-focus.\n\nHumility, in various interpretations, is widely seen as a virtue which centers on low self-preoccupation, or unwillingness to put oneself forward, so it is in many religious and philosophical traditions, it contrasts with narcissism, hubris and other forms of pride and is an idealistic and rare intrinsic construct that has an extrinsic side.\n\nThe term \"humility\" comes from the Latin word \"humilitas\", a noun related to the adjective ', which may be translated as \"humble\", but also as \"grounded\", or \"from the earth\", since it derives from ' (earth). See the English \"humus\".\n\nThe word \"humble\" may be related to feudal England where the lowest cuts of meat, or 'umbles' ,' that is to say whatever was left over when the upper classes had taken their parts, were provided to the lowest class of citizen. The term 'humble pie,' meaning to exist in a lowly station, may derive from this definition.\n\nAidos, in Greek mythology, was the \"daimona\" (goddess) of shyness, shame, and humility. She was the quality that restrained human beings from wrong.\n\nRabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks states that in Judaism humility is an appreciation of oneself, one's talents, skills, and virtues. It is not meekness or self-deprecating thought, but the effacing of oneself to something higher. Humility is not to think lowly of oneself, but to appreciate the self one has received. In recognition of the mysteries and complexities of life, one becomes humbled to the awesomeness of what one is and what one can achieve. Rabbi Pini Dunner discusses that humility is to place others first; it is to appreciate others' worth as important. In recognizing our worth as people, Rabbi Dunner shows that looking into the zillions of stars in the sky, and in the length and history of time, you and I are insignificant, like dust. Rabbi Dunner states that Moses wrote in the Torah, \"And Moses was exceedingly humble, more than any man on the face of the earth.\" How is it possible to be humble and write you are the most humble? The conclusion is that Moses knew he was humble. It is not in denial of your talents and gifts but to recognize them and live up to your worth and something greater. It is in the service to others that is the greatest form of humility.\n\nAs illustrated in the person of Moses, who leads the nation of Hebrews out of slavery in Egypt and to the “Promised Land”, humility is a sign of Godly strength and purpose, not weakness. Of this great leader, the Bible states, “For Moses was a man exceeding meek above all men that dwelt upon earth\" (). Moses is venerated by Jewish, Christian and Muslim adherents alike.\n\nAmongst the benefits of humility described in the Old Testament, that is shared by many faiths, are honor, wisdom, prosperity, the protection of the Lord and peace. In addition, \"God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble\" ()\n\nNew Testament exhortations to humility are found in many places, for example \"Blessed are the meek\" (), \"He who exalts himself will be humbled and he who humbles himself will be exalted\" (), as well as () and throughout the Book of James. Also in Jesus Christ's behavior in general and submission to unjust torture and execution in particular, are held up as examples of righteous humility: \"Who, when he was reviled, did not revile: when he suffered, he threatened not: but delivered himself to him that judged him justly.\",\n\nC.S. Lewis writes, in \"Mere Christianity\", that pride is the \"anti-God\" state, the position in which the ego and the self are directly opposed to God: \"Unchastity, anger, greed, drunkenness, and all that, are mere fleabites in comparison: it was through Pride that the devil became the devil: Pride leads to every other vice: it is the complete anti-God state of mind.\" In contrast, Lewis contends that, in Christian moral teaching, the opposite of pride is humility. This is popularly illustrated by a phrase wrongly attributed to Lewis, \"Humility is not thinking less of yourself, but thinking of yourself less.\" This is an apparent paraphrase, by Rick Warren in \"The Purpose Driven Life\", of a passage found in \"Mere Christianity:\" Lewis writes, regarding the truly humble man, \n\nSt. Augustine stresses the importance of humility in the study of the Bible, with the exemplars of a barbarian Christian slave, the apostle Paul, and the Ethiopian eunuch in Acts 8 (\"De Doctrina Christiana\", prooem. 4–7 [hereafter \"DDC\"]). Both learner and teacher need to be humble, because they learn and teach what ultimately belongs to God (\"DDC\", prooem. 7–8; 1 Cor. 4:7). Humility is a basic disposition of the interpreter of the Bible. The confidence of the exegete and preacher arises from the conviction that his or her mind depends on God absolutely (\"DDC\", 1.1.1). Augustine argues that the interpreter of the Bible should proceed with humility, because only a humble person can grasp the truth of Scripture (\"DDC\", 2.41.62).\n\nHumility is said to be a fit recipient of grace; according to the words of St. James, \"God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble\" (, .)\n\n\"True humility\" is distinctly different from \"false humility\" which consists of deprecating one's own sanctity, gifts, talents, and accomplishments for the sake of receiving praise or adulation from others, as personified by the fictional character Uriah Heep created by Charles Dickens. In this context legitimate humility comprises the following behaviors and attitudes:\n\nThe vices opposed to humility are: \n\nCatholic texts view humility as annexed to the cardinal virtue of temperance. It is viewed as a potential part of temperance because temperance includes all those virtues that restrain or express the inordinate movements of our desires or appetites.\n\nSt. Bernard defines it as, \"A virtue by which a man knowing himself as he truly is, abases himself. Jesus Christ is the ultimate definition of Humility.\"\n\nHumility was a virtue extolled by Saint Francis of Assisi, and this form of Franciscan piety led to the artistic development of the \"Madonna of humility\" first used by them for contemplation. The Virgin of humility sits on the ground, or upon a low cushion, unlike the \"Enthroned Madonna\" representations. This style of painting spread quickly through Italy and by 1375 examples began to appear in Spain, France and Germany and it became the most popular among the styles of the early Trecento artistic period.\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas, a 13th-century philosopher and theologian in the Scholastic tradition, defines humility similarly as \"the virtue of humility\" that \"consists in keeping oneself within one's own bounds, not reaching out to things above one, but submitting to one's superior\" (Summa Contra Gent., bk. IV, ch. lv, tr. Joseph Rickaby).\n\nIn the Qur'an, various Arabic words conveying the meaning of \"humility\" are used. The very term \"Islam\" can be interpreted as \"surrender (to God), humility”, from the triconsonantal root S-L-M; other words used are \"tawadu\" and \"khoshou\": \n\nBuddhism is a religion of self-examination. The natural aim of the Buddhist life is the state of enlightenment, gradually cultivated through meditation and other spiritual practices. Humility, in this context, is a characteristic that is both an essential part of the spiritual practice, and a result of it. As a quality to be developed, it is deeply connected with the practice of Four Abodes (Brahmavihara): love-kindness, compassion, empathetic joy and equanimity. As a result of the practice, this cultivated humility is expanded by the wisdom acquired by the experience of ultimate emptiness (Shunyata) and non-self (Anatta). Humility, compassion, and wisdom are intrinsic parts of the state of enlightenment. On the other hand, not being humble is an obstacle on the path of enlightenment which needs to be overcome. In the Tipitaka (the Buddhist scriptures), criticizing others and praising oneself is considered a vice; but criticizing oneself and praising others is considered a virtue. Attachment to the self, apart from being a vice in itself, also leads to other evil states, that create suffering.\n\nIn the Tipitaka, in the widely known \"Mangala Sutta\", humility (\"\", literally: 'without air') is mentioned as one of the thirty-eight blessings in life. In the Pali tradition, examples of humility that are often raised are the monk Sariputta Thera, a leading disciple of the Buddha, and Hatthaka, a leading lay disciple. In later Pali texts and Commentaries, Sariputta Thera is depicted as a forgiving person, who is quick to apologize and accepting of criticism. In the \"suttas\" (discourses of the Buddha) Hatthaka is praised by the Buddha when he was unwilling to let other people know his good qualities.\n\nIn Buddhist practice, humility is practiced in a variety of ways. For example, Japanese Soto Zen monks bow and chant in honor of their robes before they don them. This serves to remind them of the connection of the monk's robes with enlightenment. Buddhist monks in all traditions are dependent on the generosity of laypeople, through whom they receive their necessities. This in itself is a practice of humility.\n\nIn Sanskrit literature, the virtue of humility is explained with many terms, some of which use the root word, \"neti\" (sometimes spelled \"nati\", \"nti\", Sanskrit: नति). \"नति\" comes from \"न ति\" or 'No \"Me\" / I am not'. Related words include \"viniti\" (विनति), \"samniti\" (संनति, humility towards), and the concept \"amanitvam\", listed as the first virtue in the Bhagwad Gita. \"Amanitvam\" is a fusion word for \"pridelessness\" and the virtue of \"humility\". Other related concepts are \"namrata\" (नम्रता), which means \"modest and humble behavior\".\n\nDifferent scholars have varying interpretations for the concept of \"amanitvam\", humility, as virtue in the Bhagwad Gita. For example, Prabhupada explains humility to mean one should not be anxious to have the satisfaction of being honored by others. The material conception of life makes us very eager to receive honor from others, but from the point of view of a man in perfect knowledge—who knows that he is not this body—anything, honor or dishonor, pertaining to this body is useless. Jopson explains \"amanitvam\", humility, as lack of arrogance and pride, and one of twenty-six virtues in a human being that if perfected, leads one to a divine state of living and the ultimate truth. Eknath Easwaran writes that the Gita's subject is \"the war within, the struggle for self-mastery that every human being must wage if he or she is to emerge from life victorious\", and \"The language of battle is often found in the scriptures, for it conveys the strenuous, long, drawn-out campaign we must wage to free ourselves from the tyranny of the ego, the cause of all our suffering and sorrow\". To get in touch with your true self, whether you call that God, Brahman, etc., one has to let go of the ego. The Sanskrit word Ahamkara literally translates into The-sound-of-I, or quite simply the sense of the self or ego.\n\nMahatma Gandhi interprets the concept of \"humility\" in Hindu Dharma much more broadly, where humility is an essential virtue that must exist in a person for other virtues to emerge. To Mahatma Gandhi, Truth can be cultivated, as well as Love, but Humility cannot be cultivated. Humility has to be one of the starting points. He states, \"Humility cannot be an observance by itself. For it does not lend itself to being practiced. It is however an indispensable test of ahimsa (non-violence).\" Humility must not be confused with mere manners; a man may prostrate himself before another, but if his heart is full of bitterness for the other, it is not humility. Sincere humility is how one feels inside, it's a state of mind. A humble person is not himself conscious of his humility, states Mahatma Gandhi.\n\nSwami Vivekananda, one of the scholars of Hindu Dharma in the 19th century, argues that the concept of humility does not mean \"crawling on all fours and calling oneself a sinner.\" In Vivekananda's Hindu Dharma, each human being being the Universal, recognizing and feeling oneness with everyone and everything else in the universe, without inferiority or superiority or any other bias, is the mark of humility. To Dr. S Radhakrishnan, humility in Hindu Dharma is the non-judgmental state of mind when we are best able to learn, contemplate and understand everyone and everything else.\n\nGuru Nanak, the first Sikh guru was the prophet of humility.\n\nBaba Nand Singh Ji Maharaj said about Guru Nanak that Garibi, Nimrata, Humility is the Divine Flavour, the most wonderful fragrance of the Lotus Feet of Lord Guru Nanak. There is no place for Ego (referred to in Sikhism as Haumain) in the sphere of Divine Love, in the sphere of true Prema Bhagti. That is why in the House of Guru Nanak one finds Garibi, Nimrata, Humility reigning supreme. Guru Nanak was an Incarnation of Divine Love and a Prophet of True Humility.\n\nAccording to Sikhism all people, equally, have to bow before God so there ought to be no hierarchies among or between people. According to Nanak the supreme purpose of human life is to reconnect with Akal (The Timeless One), however, egotism is the biggest barrier in doing this. Using the guru's teaching remembrance of \"nām\" (the divine Word) leads to the end of egotism. The immediate fruit of humility is intuitive peace and pleasure. With humility they continue to meditate on the Lord, the treasure of excellence. The God-conscious being is steeped in humility. One whose heart is mercifully blessed with abiding humility. Sikhism treats humility as a begging bowl before the god.\n\nSikhs extend this belief in equality, and thus humility, towards all faith: \"all religious traditions are equally valid and capable of enlightening their followers\". In addition to sharing with others Guru Nanak inspired people to earn an honest living without exploitation and also the need for remembrance of the divine name (God). Guru Nanak described living an \"active, creative, and practical life\" of \"truthfulness, fidelity, self-control and purity\" as being higher than a purely contemplative life.\n\nBaba Nand Singh Sahib is renowned as the most humble Sikh Saint in the history of Sikhism. Once the disciples of Baba Harnam Singh Ji, the spiritual preceptor of Baba Nand Singh Ji Maharaj asked him how much power He had transmitted to Baba Nand Singh Ji Maharaj to which He replied\n\nBaba Nand Singh Ji Maharaj was humbler than the humblest in spirit and He outshines everyone at the pinnacle of all spiritual glory.\n\nSri Guru Arjan Sahib says in Sukhmani Sahib:\n\nThe spiritual teacher Meher Baba held that humility is one of the foundations of devotional life: \"Upon the altar of humility we must offer our prayers to God.\" Baba also described the power of humility to overcome hostility: \"True humility is strength, not weakness. It disarms antagonism and ultimately conquers it.\" Finally, Baba emphasized the importance of being humble when serving others: \"\"One of the most difficult things to learn is to render service without bossing, without making a fuss about it and without any consciousness of high and low. In the world of spirituality, humility counts at least as much as utility\".\"\n\nHumility, in Taoism, is defined as a refusal to assert authority or a refusal to be first in anything and that the act of daring, in itself, is a refusal of wisdom and a rush to enjoin circumstances before you are ready. Along with compassion and frugality, humility is one the three treasures (virtues) in the possession of those who follow the Tao.\n\nThe treasure of humility, in Chinese is a six-character phrase instead of a single word: \"Bugan wei tianxia xian\" 不敢為天下先 \"not dare to be first/ahead in the world\". \nEllen Chen notes that\nThe third treasure, daring not be at the world's front, is the Taoist way to avoid premature death. To be at the world's front is to expose oneself, to render oneself vulnerable to the world's destructive forces, while to remain behind and to be humble is to allow oneself time to fully ripen and bear fruit. This is a treasure whose secret spring is the fear of losing one's life before one's time. This fear of death, out of a love for life, is indeed the key to Taoist wisdom. (1989:209) \n\nFurthermore, also according to the Tao Te Ching (77.4) a wise person acts without claiming the results as his; he achieves his merit and does not rest (arrogantly) in it: – he does not wish to display his superiority.\n\nIn the numerous traditions of initiatory Wicca, called in the U.S.A. British Traditional Wicca, four paired & balanced qualities are recommended in liturgical texts as having come from the Wiccan Goddess:\n\nIn the matter of humility, this deific instruction appropriately pairs being honorable with being humble. Characteristically, this Wiccan \"virtue\" is balanced by its partner virtue.\n\nKant's view of humility has been defined as \"that meta-attitude that constitutes the moral agent's proper perspective on himself as a dependent and corrupt but capable and dignified rational agent\". Kant's notion of humility relies on the centrality of truth and rational thought leading to proper perspective and can therefore be seen as emergent.\n\nMahatma Gandhi is attributed as suggesting that attempting to sustain truth without humility is doomed to become an \"arrogant caricature\" of truth.\n\nWhile many religions and philosophers view humility as a virtue, some have been critical of it, seeing it as opposed to individualism.\n\nNietzsche views humility as a strategy used by the weak to avoid being destroyed by the strong. In \"Twilight of the Idols\" he writes: \"When stepped on, a worm doubles up. That is clever. In that way he lessens the probability of being stepped on again. In the language of morality: humility.\" He believed that his idealized Übermensch would be more apt to roam around unfettered by pretensions of humility, proud of his stature and power, but not reveling idly in it, and certainly not displaying hubris. But, if so, this would mean the pretension aspect of this kind of humility is more akin to obsequiousness and to other kinds of pretentious humility.\n\nRecent research suggests that humility is a quality of certain types of leaders. For example, Jim Collins and his colleagues found that a certain type of leader, whom they term \"level 5\", possesses humility and fierce resolve. Humility is being studied as a trait that can enhance leadership effectiveness. The research suggests that humility is multi-dimensional and includes self-understanding and awareness, openness, and perspective taking.\n\n\n\nIslam's quotes regarding humility IslamicArtDB.com\n"}

Landed estates in the Middle Ages, for example, had to remain intact and even if sold, they could be reclaimed by blood kin. As a legal classification, inalienable possessions date back to Roman times. According to Barbara Mills, \"Inalienable possessions are objects made to be kept (not exchanged), have symbolic and economic power that cannot be transferred, and are often used to authenticate the ritual authority of corporate groups\". \n\nMarcel Mauss first described inalienable possessions in \"The Gift\", discussing potlatches, a kind of gift-giving feast held in communities of many indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest:\nIt is even incorrect to speak in these cases of transfer. They are loans rather than sales or true abandonment of possessions. Among the Kwakiutl a certain number of objects, although they appear at the potlatch, cannot be disposed of. In reality these pieces of \"property\" are sacra that a family divests itself of only with great reluctance and sometimes never.\nAnnette Weiner broadened the application of the category of property outside the European context with her book \"Inalienable Possessions: The Paradox of Keeping-While-Giving\", focussing on a range of Oceanic societies from Polynesia to Papua New Guinea and testing existing theories of reciprocity and marriage exchange. She also applies the concept to explain examples such as the Kula ring in the Trobriand Islands, which was made famous by Bronisław Malinowski. She explores how such possessions enable hierarchy by establishing a source of lasting social difference. She also describes practices of loaning inalienable possessions as a way of either \"temporarily making kin of non-kin\" or garnering status.\n\n\"Inalienable Possessions: The Paradox of Keeping-While-Giving\" is a book by anthropologist Annette Weiner. Weiner was a Professor of Anthropology and Dean of the Graduate School of Arts at New York University, and served as president of the American Anthropological Association. She died in 1997.\n\nThe book focuses on a range of Oceanic societies from Polynesia to Papua New Guinea to test existing theories of reciprocity (gift-giving) and marriage exchange. The book is also important for introducing a consideration of gender in the gift-giving debate by placing women at the heart of the political process. She finds inalienable possessions at the root of many Polynesian kingdoms, such as Hawaii and Samoa. She also credits the original idea of \"inalienable possessions\" to Mauss, who classified two categories of goods in Samoa, \"Oloa\" and \"le'Tonga\"─immovable and movable goods exchanged through marriage.\n\nBarbara Mills praised her investigation of how \"inalienable possessions are simultaneously used to construct and defeat hierarchy\", saying it \"opens a boxful of new theoretical and methodological tools for understanding social inequality in past and present societies.\" \n\nWeiner states that certain objects become inalienable only when they have acquired \"cosmological authentication\"; that is,\n\nWhat makes a possession inalienable is its exclusive and cumulative identity with a particular series of owners through time. Its history is authenticated by fictive or true genealogies, origin myths, sacred ancestors, and gods. In this way, inalienable possessions are transcendent treasures to be guarded against all the exigencies that might force their loss.\nShe gives the example of a Māori Sacred Cloak and says that when a woman wears it \"she is more than herself – that she is her ancestors.\" Cloaks act as conduits for a person's hau or life giving spirit. The hau can bring strength or even knowledge potentially but a person may also have the risk of losing their hau. \"An inalienable possession acts as a stabilizing force against change because its presence authenticates cosmological origins, kinship, and political histories.\" In this way, the Cloak actually stands for the person. \"These possessions then are the most potent force in the effort to subvert change, while at the same time they stand as the corpus of change\".\n\nPaul Sillitoe queries the supposed identification of these objects with persons. He states that these objects are \"durable wealth [that] is collective property that is continually in circulation among persons who have temporary possession of it. In this view, transactable objects belong to society as a whole and are not inalienable possessions associated with certain persons. An analogy in Western culture is sporting trophies, such as championship boxing belts owned by all the clubs comprising the association that controls the competition in which constituent club members compete, and which pass for agreed periods of time into the possession of particular champions, changing hands as new champions emerge.\"\n\nTheuws argues that \"Over time, objects acquire new meanings and what was once a humble pot may become a sacred vessel.\" This transformation in the object is the result of ritualization or a change in cosmology. In fact, \"Ritual Knowledge is often a source of political power.\"\n\nHowever, these possessions may also become destabilizing, as elites reconstruct those sacred histories to identify themselves with the past; for example, Gandhi invoked the traditional hand spinning traditional cloth, khadi, to contest British rule, which Nehru referred to as Gandhi's \"livery of freedom\".\n\nInalienable possessions are nonetheless frequently drawn into exchange networks. The subtitle of Weiner's book is \"The paradox of keeping-while-giving\"; they are given as gifts (not sold) yet still retain a tie to their owners. These gifts are not like those given in regular gift giving in the West on birthdays for example. Rather, these gifts can't be re-sold for money by the receiver because the value and the significance of the gift cannot be alienated or disengaged from its relationship to those whose inalienable possession it is.\n\nThese inalienable possessions are a form of property that is inalienable, yet they can be exchanged. Property can be thought of as a bundle of rights – the right to use something, the right to collect rent from someone, the right to extract something (as in oil drilling), the right to hunt within a particular territory. That ownership may be a bundle of rights held in common by groups of individuals or lineages. The property thus becomes impossible to separate from the group owning it. \"To give in this instant means to transfer without alienating, or to use the language of the West, to give means to cede the right of use without ceding actual ownership\". In other words, Weiner is contending that an economy built around the moral code of gift giving provides the giver rights over what he/she has given and in turn \"subsequently benefits from a series of advantages.\" Thus, when one accepts a gift one also accepts that the giver now has rights over the receiver.\n\nWeiner begins by re-examining Mauss' explanation for the return gift, the \"spirit of the gift.\" The \"spirit of the gift\" was a translation of a Maori word, \"hau\". Weiner demonstrates that not \"all\" gifts must be returned. Only gifts that are \"immoveable property\" can become inalienable gifts. She further argues that inalienable possessions gain the \"mana\" (spirit) of their possessors, and so become associated with them. These goods are frequently produced by women, like the feather cloak above. The more prominent the woman, the more mana the object is thought to inherit. The longer the kin group can maintain the object in their possession, the more valuable it becomes; but it must also be periodically displayed to assert the group's status, and thus becomes an object of desire for outsiders.\n\nWeiner argues that the role of women in the exchange of inalienable possessions has been seriously underestimated. Kinship theory as developed by Claude Lévi-Strauss, used the \"sibling incest taboo\" to argue that women themselves are objects of exchange between lineage groups. Men had to find women outside their kin groups to marry hence they \"lost\" their sisters in order to gain wives. Weiner shows that the focus on women as wives ignores the importance of women as sisters (who are not \"lost\" as a result of becoming wives). Women produce inalienable possessions which they may take with them when they marry out; the inalienable possession, however, must be reclaimed by her brother after her death in order to maintain the status of the kin group. In comparing Hawaii, Samoa and the Trobriands, she argues that the more stratified a society is by ranked differences, the more important inalienable possessions produced by sisters become. The more stratified a society becomes (as in Hawaii), the closer the sibling bond (\"sibling intimacy\"). In these cases, women are critical to the \"cosmological authentication\" of inalienable possessions.\n\nA critical part of Weiner's argument is that the ability to keep inalienable possessions outside of exchange is a source of difference, and hence brings high status. The development of Polynesian kingdoms is an example. She points to the inalienable possessions of the Australian aborigines, however, to demonstrate how the creation of hierarchy can be defeated. Australian inalienable possessions are given cosmological authentication through their religious beliefs in the Dreaming.\n\nWeiner points out that the same gender relations of \"sibling intimacy\" affect the exchange of these inalienable objects. Women as sisters and women as wives provide the conduit for the gifting and return gifting of these goods, allowing the givers to build prestige. However, insofar as these inalienable possessions lose their cosmological authentication, these social hierarchies lose intergenerational longevity. Because the Dreaming itself is an inalienable possession kept secret by clan elders, it can be lost and hierarchy defeated.\n\nWeiner has used the term to categorize the many Kula valuables of the Trobriand islanders who view those objects as culturally imbued with a spiritual sense of the gift giver. Thus, when they are transferred from one individual or group to another the objects reserve meaningful bonds associated with that of the giver and their lineage. The shell bracelets and necklaces given in exchange each have their own histories, and are thus ranked on the basis of who they have been exchanged to. There were, as well, less well known shells called \"kitomu\" which were individually owned (rather than being part of lineage history), which would be given to temporarily please a disappointed trade partner expecting a more valuable shell.\n\nThe Kula trade was organized differently in the more hierarchical parts of the Trobriand islands. There, only chiefs were allowed to engage in Kula exchange. In hierarchical areas, individuals can earn their own kitomu shells, whereas in less hierarchical areas, they are always subject to the claims of matrilineal kin. And lastly, in the hierarchical areas, Kula necklaces and bracelets are saved for external exchange only; stone axe blades are used internally. In less hierarchical areas, exchange partners may lose their valuables to internal claims. As a result, most seek to exchange their kula valuables with chiefs, who thus become the most successful players. The chiefs have saved their Kula valuables for external trade, and external traders seek to trade with them before they lose their valuables to internal claims.\n\nKula exchange is the only way for an individual to achieve local prestige without local political action. But this prestige is fleeting and does not transform into permanent differences in rank because women's participation is minor and Kula shells lack cosmological authentication. It is not Kula shells but women's cloth wealth that is connected with matrilineal ancestors. It is for this reason that women retain high prestige and authority despite the fame of male Kula exchange players.\n\nMaurice Godelier has further elaborated on Annette Weiner's ideas on inalienable possessions in \"The Enigma of the Gift\". He derived two theses from Weiner, to which he adds a third.\n\nFirst Thesis: As discussed above, even in a society that is dominated by a gift-giving economic and moral code, the interplay of gift and counter-gift doesn't completely dominate the social sphere, as there must be some objects which are kept and not given. These things, such as valuables, talismans, knowledge, and rites, confirm identities and their continuity over time. Moreover, they acknowledge differences of identity of individuals or groups linked by various kinds of exchanges.\n\nSecond Thesis: Women or the feminine element also exercise power by providing legitimation and redistributing of political and religious power among groups in a society. Godelier contends that Weiner refocuses attention on the role of women in constructing and legitimizing power. While women, as wives, are frequently lowered in status, as sisters, they frequently retain equal status to their brothers. For example, in Polynesia, the woman as a sister appears to control those goods associated with the sacred, the ancestors, and the gods.\n\nTo this, Godelier adds a third thesis.\n\nThird thesis: The social is not just the sum of alienable and inalienable goods, but is brought into existence by the difference and inter-dependence of these two spheres of exchange. Maintaining society thus requires not \"keeping-while-giving\", but \"\"keeping-for-giving and giving-for-keeping\".\"\n\n\nEconomists have often shunned the idea of pondering exactly why people want goods. Goods serve many purposes beyond what classical economists might theorize. Goods can serve as systems of social communication according to Mary Douglas, a prominent anthropologist. In fact, anthropology in general is important to economics because it talks about the socio-cultural relationships in economy and economy itself as a cultural system that is not just market-based. Moreover, entire industries are often based on gift giving such as the pharmaceutical industry. In addition, gift-giving plays an important role in the cultural development of how social and business relations evolve in major economies such as in the case of the Chinese.\n\n"}

{"id": "23742928", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23742928", "title": "John Anderson (philosopher)", "text": "John Anderson (philosopher)\n\nJohn Anderson (1 November 1893 – 6 July 1962) was a Scottish philosopher who occupied the post of Challis Professor of Philosophy at Sydney University from 1927 to 1958. He founded the empirical brand of philosophy known as Australian realism (see Scottish realism).\n\nAnderson's promotion of 'free thought' in all subjects, including politics and morality, was controversial and brought him into constant conflict with the august senate of the university. However, he is credited with educating a generation of influential 'Andersonian' thinkers and activists—some of whom helped to place Sydney in the forefront of the 'sexual revolution' of the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nTo Anderson, an acceptable philosophy must have significant 'sweep' and be capable of challenging and moulding ideas in every aspect of intellect and society.\n\nAnderson was born in Stonehouse, Lanarkshire, Scotland and educated at the former Hamilton Academy from which school he won a bursary to attend the University of Glasgow in the university's Bursary Competition of 1911. Anderson was listed among notable former pupils of Hamilton Academy in a 1950 magazine article on the school. His elder brother was William Anderson, Professor of Philosophy at Auckland University College, 1921 to his death in 1955, and described as \"the most dominant figure in New Zealand philosophy.\"\n\nAnderson graduated MA from Glasgow University in 1917, with first-class honours in Philosophy (Logic and Moral Philosophy), and first-class honours in Mathematics and Natural Philosophy. After graduation, he was awarded the Ferguson Scholarship in Philosophy and the Shaw Philosophical Fellowship, the examinations for which were open to graduates of any of the four Scottish universities.\n\nHe served as Assistant in Philosophy at the University College, Cardiff (Cardiff) (1917–19), in Moral Philosophy and Logic in the University of Glasgow (1919–20) and lectured in Logic and Metaphysics at the University of Edinburgh (1920–26).\n\nAfter arriving in Sydney in 1927 he associated with the Communist Party of Australia and contributed to their journals, sometimes under a nom de plume but, by about 1932 he began to believe that communism under Joseph Stalin in the Soviet Union was a dictatorship with no room for workers' control or participation. He then became aligned with the Trotskyist movement for a period of time. But \"[h]e could not put up any longer with dialectical materialism or with the servile state which he saw was being imposed by the doctrine of the dictatorship of the proletariat\".\n\nAnderson later abandoned authoritarian forms of socialism and became what would today be called a libertarian and pluralist—an opponent of all forms of authoritarianism. Sometimes he described himself as an anarchist but, after the 1930s, he gave up his earlier political utopianism.\n\nAs Sydney University's Challis Professor of Philosophy, Anderson was a formidable champion of the principle of academic freedom from authoritarian intervention. For example, he fought a successful battle to end the role of the British Medical Association in setting course standards and student quotas in the medical school. He also railed against the presence on campus of a military unit—the Sydney University Regiment—and lived to see the day in 1960 when the regiment's campus HQ was destroyed by fire. (The regiment was subsequently rehoused at a new facility on university-owned land at Darlington.)\n\nAnderson was censured by the Sydney University Senate in 1931 after criticising the role of war memorials in sanctifying war. In 1943 he was censured by the Parliament of New South Wales after arguing that religion has no place in schools. He founded the Sydney University Free Thought Society which ran from 1931 to 1951. He was president of the society throughout that period.\n\nIt is legendary that the university's Senate, accepting that it could not realise its desire to sack the controversial Challis Professor, sought to reduce Anderson's stature and influence by creating a new chair of \"Moral and Political Philosophy\" to which Alan Stout was appointed. This purpose was not achieved, as Anderson continued to lecture on ethics and politics. Stout (who had been urged by Anderson to apply for the position) was a steady admirer and supporter of the Challis Professor and declined to undercut his prestige in any way. The result was that Sydney gained a second prestigious and personable philosopher who \"brought a quick intelligence, intellectual grasp, a flair for putting things simply and clearly, together with a genuine respect for the views of others and readiness to appreciate their point of view\". On Anderson's retirement, the two departments were merged under Stout as 'the Professor of Philosophy'.\n\nAs a committed empiricist, Anderson argued that there is only one realm of \"being\" and it can be best understood through science and naturalistic philosophy. He asserted that there is no supernatural god and that there are no non-natural realms along the lines of Platonic ideals. He rejected all notions that knowledge could be obtained by means other than descriptions of facts and any belief that revelation or mysticism could be sources for obtaining truth. He was arguing that traditional Christian concepts of good and evil were only meant for slaves and that, in actuality, the idea of morality was empty. For Anderson, the term \"good\" was valid when applied objectively to human activities which were free, critical and creative but the more common subjective applications were to be avoided or exposed as deceptive. Not surprisingly, Anderson's influence was both extensive and controversial as he constantly examined and fearlessly criticised hallowed beliefs and institutions.\nHe is, arguably, the most important philosopher who has worked in Australia. Certainly he was the most important in both the breadth and depth of influence. Among the philosophers who got their original intellectual formation from Anderson are John Passmore, John Mackie, A.J. ('Jim') Baker, David Stove and myself. There are lots more. But for every student who became a philosopher there were far, far, more in the law, in medicine, in journalism, in other academic disciplines, that were profoundly influenced by him. I am inclined to think that, especially in the thirties and forties of the last century, Anderson was the person who set the agenda, and set the tone, for intellectual discussion in Sydney. – David Armstrong (2005)\n\nAnderson's influence has spread through his personal impact on several generations of students, the \"Andersonians\", who include the philosophers named above, together with Hedley Bull and Eugene Kamenka; the World War II organiser Alf Conlon, many members of the Sydney Push, Tonga's 'I. Futa Helu, and jurist John Kerr, later to be Australia's best-remembered governor-general.\n\nAnderson's insistence on unceasing inquiry and criticism became central to the intellectual principles of the university's Libertarian Society which supplanted the Free Thought Society in the early 1950s and provided a philosophic platform for the much broader subculture known as \"the Push\" throughout the 1960s. He was a defender of free speech and was critical of the Australian government's bans on certain political publications (1928). He advocated religious and sexual freedoms and free discussion of issues in an era when mention of taboo subjects commonly resulted in angry public condemnation by prominent moralists.\n\nAfter the Second World War, however, Anderson began exhibiting more conservative views. Jim Baker interprets this latter stage not so much as \"a definite change in his overall thinking than ... an alteration of emphasis and interest\". In other words, according to Baker, while Anderson's political positions changed over time his philosophy remained constant. To many, however, it seemed that Anderson was departing from his pluralism. During the 1949 coal miners' strike, for instance, he supported the government's action in using troops as strikebreakers. At a Free Thought Society meeting in August 1950 he refused to oppose conscription for the war in Korea. In 1951 he refused to allow students to use the Free Thought Society to canvass the 'No' case for Menzies' attempt to ban the Communist Party in the referendum of that year. This was the last straw for many Freethinkers; Anderson's apparent authoritarianism caused most to abandon the Free Thought Society and to establish the Libertarian Society. (It must be pointed out that Anderson did not support the banning of the Communist Party—in fact he attacked the proposal.) The Free Thought Society held its last meeting in 1951. The Libertarian Society functioned from 1952 to 1969.\n\nAnderson broke off contact with the former disciples who formed the Libertarian Society and never associated with \"Push\" people who routinely sang his praises along with the bawdy songs he had imported to his new country. However, even after retirement in 1958 and to the brink of his death in 1962, he was seen daily in his study, continuing his work and reviewing earlier work. Among his last publications were \"Classicism\" (1960), \"Empiricism and Logic\" (1962) and \"Relational Arguments\" (1962).\n\n\n"}

He wrote a treatise entitled \"On the non-existence of God\" and was later executed on charges of atheism. His trial has been criticized and is seen as a case of legalized religious murder in Poland.\n\nKazimierz Łyszczyński was a nobleman, landowner, philosopher, and soldier in the service of the Sapieha family. For eight years he studied philosophy as a Jesuit and then became a supply judge (podsędek) in legal cases against the Jesuits concerning estates. He was born in Łyszczyce, in what is now Brest District, Brest Region, Belarus.\n\nŁyszczyński had read a book by Henry Aldsted entitled \"Theologia Naturalis\", which attempted to prove the existence of divinity. But its arguments were so confused that Łyszczyński was able to infer many contradictions. Ridiculing Aldsted, Łyszczyński wrote in the book's margins the words \"ergo non est Deus\" (\"therefore God does not exist\").\n\nThis was discovered by one of Łyszczyński's debtors, Jan Kazimierz Brzoska, who was the nuncio of Brest in Poland or a Stolnik of Bracławice or Łowczy of Brześć. Brzoska, reluctant to return a great sum of money to him lent by Łyszczyński, accused the latter of being an atheist and gave the aforementioned work as evidence to Witwicki, bishop of Poznań. Brzoska also stole and delivered to the court a handwritten copy of \"De non existentia Dei\", which was the first Polish philosophical treatise presenting reality from an atheistic perspective, and which Łyszczyński had been working on since 1674. Witwicki along with Załuski, bishop of Kiev, took up this case with zeal. The King attempted to help Łyszczyński by ordering that he should be judged at Wilno, but this could not save Łyszczyński from the clergy. Łyszczyński's first privilege as a Polish noble, that he could not be imprisoned before his condemnation, was violated. The Łyszczyński case was brought before the diet of 1689 where he was accused of having denied the existence of God and having blasphemed against the Virgin Mary and the saints. He was condemned to death for atheism. The sentence was carried out before noon in the Old Town Market in Warsaw, where his tongue was pulled out followed by a beheading. After that, his corpse was transported beyond the city borders and cremated.\n\nBishop Załuski gave the following account of the execution:\n\nŁyszczyński wrote a treatise, \"De non existentia Dei\" (\"On the non-existence of God\"), stating that God does not exist and that religions are inventions of man.\n\nOn the basis of a public denunciation, a trial was conducted before a Sejm commission. There is an actual transcript of the proceedings at the Kórnik library, including a speech by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania \"Instigator Regni\" Szymon Kurowicz Zabistowski, citing fragments of \"De non existentia Dei\". The treatise itself was destroyed by the Sejm, but the surviving cited fragments are as follows:\n\nDuring his trial, Łyszczyński claimed that the work was to be about a Catholic and an atheist having a debate, in which the Catholic would eventually win (he told the diet that the work would have had a different title from \"De non existentia Dei\"). The atheist was to speak first followed by the Catholic. He claimed that he only wrote the first half of the work (that is only the atheist's argument) and then stopped writing at the advice of a priest.\n\nRegardless of whether Łyszczyński was genuinely an atheist, in communist Poland he came to be celebrated as a martyr to the atheist cause. In a series of papers, the philosopher Andrzej Nowicki presented a romanticized view of Łyszczyński, stating that \"in terms of breadth of intellectual horizons, thoroughness of philosophical erudition, and boldness of thought, he was beyond doubt the most eminent Polish mind of the age.\"\n\nIn March 2014, his persona and ideas were the key theme in a public performance during the 2014 Procession of Atheists in Poland.\n\n\n\n"}

His books include:\n\nCrime and Culture: refining the traditions\n\nA book examines the underlying structures of political economy that produce current crime ideologies. An overview and critique of classical perspectives on crime is followed by a discussion on the interrelationship of concepts that are basic to a critical cultural alternative--ideology, hegemony, political economy and the state. The criminal practices of institutions are highlighted, emphasizing how they interact to effectively discipline, dominate and devalue certain elements of the population.\n\nWhat do they know?\": Youth, crime and culture\n\nIn this book Visano takes an unconventional approach to understanding the phenomenon of youth crime. His analysis focuses on the impact of the dominant culture on youth in terms of the often- overlooked issue of youth reflexivity—an interpretive processes through which youths organize their thoughts, feelings, and motives. In particular, he looks at the roles played by ideologies (such as modernity and liberalism) and institutions (such as the media) in shaping youth identity. He also contends that youth crime actually serves the interests of capitalism.\n\n•Nominated and Elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts (FRSA), Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures & Commerce ,UK (2006- )\n\n•Diploma Solenne, Accademia Internazionale di Pontzen di Lettere, Scienze ed Arti, Napoli, Italia 1998\n\n•Lord Ruthven Assembly Award.

In 1925 he went up to University College, London, graduating in 1929, and then went on to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was the only student on a specialised course in logic, taught by Moore, Braithwaite, and Wittgenstein. In 1931, after graduating, Cornforth was awarded a three-year research scholarship at Trinity. In the summer of the same year he joined the Communist Party, setting up the party's first organisation at Cambridge; and in the autumn married a fellow Cambridge student, Kitty Klugmann, sister of James. From 1933 Cornforth worked full-time for the Communist Party in East Anglia. \n\nRejected for military service on medical grounds, during the Second World War Cornforth worked as a farm labourer. He published his first work, \"Science Versus Idealism\", in 1946. In 1950 he was appointed as managing director of Lawrence & Wishart, a post he held until 1975, during which period he was responsible for the publishing of Marx's and Engels's \"Collected Works\". \n\nCornforth died aged 71 in Islington, London, in 1980, leaving a widow, Kathleen Elliott, his second wife.\n\nWhen Cornforth began his career in philosophy in the early 1930s, he was a follower of Ludwig Wittgenstein, writing in the then current style of analytic philosophy. Cornforth later became a leading ideologist of the Communist Party of Great Britain. He vigorously opposed the aesthetic theories of fellow Marxist Christopher Caudwell.\n\n\"In Defense of Philosophy\" attacks empiricist philosophies of many kinds, such as those of Rudolf Carnap (linguistic analysis) and William James (pragmatism), on the \"materialist\" grounds that they divorce science and scientific investigation from the search for truer understanding of the really existing universe. In this book there is a combination of Marxism with deep insights into the interrelations of the various sciences and the philosophical conundrums produced by the empiricist attempt to reduce science to the collection and correlation of data. Both the insights are based on the theory of the primacy of physical work and tools (thus, \"materialism\") in the development of specifically human traits such as language, abstract thought, and social organisation, and the essential role of the external world in the increasingly complex development of forms of life. \n\nCornforth's multi-volume book \"Dialectical Materialism\" was originally published in 1953 by the International Publishers, Co., Inc. The first US edition of this work was printed in 1971. The text originated from lectures that Cornforth received funding for from the London District Committee of the Communist Party of Great Britain in 1950. \n\nThe first volume, \"Materialism and the Dialectical Method\", provides a good introduction to several important sociological principles: idealism, metaphysics, materialism, mechanical materialism, and dialectical materialism, in addition to Marxist philosophy. Volume 2 of this text is entitled \"Historical Materialism\", and Volume 3 is \"Theory of Knowledge\".\n\n\n"}

The two men struck up a close relationship, and Einstein was to say to Solovine a few days after meeting him: \"It is not necessary to give you lessons in physics. The discussion about the problems which we face in physics today is much more interesting; simply come to me when you wish. I am pleased to be able to talk to you.\"\n\nSolovine one day suggested reading and debating the works of great authors. Einstein agreed enthusiastically and soon mathematician Conrad Habicht (1876–1958) became involved in what was to be known as the \"Akademie Olympia\" (Olympia Academy). Often their meetings, held in Einstein's flat, would last until the early morning hours.\n\nOn one occasion Solovine missed a scheduled meeting in his flat, preferring to listen to a concert in the city. He had prepared a meal for his friends with a note: \"Amicis carissimis ova dura et salutem.\" (To the beloved friends, hard-boiled eggs and greetings). However Einstein and Habicht turned his flat upside down after they had eaten the meal. Every piece of furniture was moved and plates, cups, forks, knives and books were scattered all over the flat. The rooms were also covered in smoke from Einstein’s pipe and Habicht’s cigar. They left a \"worthy warning\" on the wall. There you could read: \"Amico carissimo fumum spissum et salutem.\" (To the dearest friend, thick smoke and greetings). Einstein is reputed to have greeted Solovine the next evening with the following words: \"You lousy guy, how, you were cheeky enough to stay away from a meeting of the Akademie to listen to the violin? Barbarian, idiot, stupid one, if you ever let us down this way again you’ll be expelled from the Akademie with shame.\" This meeting lasted until the morning to make up for lost time.\n\nSolovine remained in contact with Einstein into the fifties.\n\n"}

He also worked with Pierre Alechinsky who helped him to publish one of his last texts, \"L'Épreuve\".\n\nHis philosophy takes root in phenomenology, from which he tries to rehabilitate the body. He starts from a genetic approach in which he tries to rethink the origin of the phenomenon as the genesis of the apparition. In \"Cri\" (Shout), he inaugurates a radical style from which he describes the effect of rupture, tearing and the void that emerges from the shout. This uncovering of the experience of language invites us to redefine the emergence of the apparition and show how the view resumes its bearings and reconstitutes a world. Starting from a critique of the Platonic vision, which fundamentally denies the body, since it is idealized as a vision of ideas, this path leads Loreau to rethink a new beginning of the body, vision and language.\n\nMax Loreau also published various poems under the titles \"Cerceaux s'orcellent\", \"Chants de la perpétuelle venue\" and \"Florence portée aux nues\".\n\nPosthumous :\n\n\n"}

{"id": "23575", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23575", "title": "Parmenides", "text": "Parmenides\n\nParmenides of Elea (; ; ) was a pre-Socratic Greek philosopher from Elea in Magna Graecia (Greater Greece, which included Southern Italy). He was the founder of the Eleatic school of philosophy. \n\nThe single known work by Parmenides is a poem, \"On Nature\", only fragments of which survive. In it, Parmenides prescribes two views of reality. In \"the way of truth\" (a part of the poem), he explains how reality (coined as \"what is-is\") is one, change is impossible, and existence is timeless, uniform, necessary, and unchanging. This is generally considered one of the first digressions into the philosophical concept of being, and has been contrasted with Heraclitus's statement that \"No man ever steps into the same river twice\" as one of the first digressions into the philosophical concept of becoming. \n\nParmenides and Heraclitus are therefore generally considered two of the founders of ontology. Scholars have generally believed that either Parmenides was responding to Heraclitus, or Heraclitus to Parmenides, though opinion on who was responding to whom changed over the course of the 20th century. In \"the way of opinion\", Parmenides explains the world of appearances, in which one's sensory faculties lead to conceptions which are false and deceitful. He has been considered the founder of metaphysics or ontology.\n\nParmenides was born in the Greek colony of Elea (now Ascea), which, according to Herodotus, had been founded shortly before 535 BC. He was descended from a wealthy and illustrious family.\n\nHis dates are uncertain; according to Diogenes Laërtius, he flourished just before 500 BC, which would put his year of birth near 540 BC, but Plato has him visiting Athens at the age of 65, when Socrates was a young man, c. 450 BC, which, if true, suggests a year of birth of c. 515 BC. He was said to have been a pupil of Xenophanes, and regardless of whether they actually knew each other, Xenophanes' philosophy is the most obvious influence on Parmenides. Diogenes Laërtius also describes Parmenides as a disciple of \"Ameinias, son of Diochaites, the Pythagorean\"; but there are no obvious Pythagorean elements in his thought.\n\nHowever, according to Sir William Smith, in \"Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology\" (1870):Others content themselves with reckoning Parmenides as well as Zeno as belonging to the Pythagorean school, or with speaking of a \"Parmenidean life\", in the same way as a \"Pythagorean life\" is spoken of; and even the censorious Timon allows Parmenides to have been a high-minded man; while Plato speaks of him with veneration, and Aristotle and others give him an unqualified preference over the rest of the Eleatics.\n\nThe first hero cult of a philosopher we know of was Parmenides' dedication of a heroon to his teacher Ameinias in Elea. Parmenides was the founder of the School of Elea, which also included Zeno of Elea and Melissus of Samos. Of his life in Elea, it was said that he had written the laws of the city. His most important pupil was Zeno, who according to Plato was 25 years his junior, and was regarded as his \"eromenos\". Parmenides had a large influence on Plato, who not only named a dialogue, \"Parmenides\", after him, but always wrote about him with veneration.\n\nWilliam Smith also wrote in \"Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology\":On the former reason is our guide; on the latter the eye that does not catch the object and re-echoing hearing. On the former path we convince ourselves that the existent neither has come into being, nor is perishable, and is entirely of one sort, without change and limit, neither past nor future, entirely included in the present. For it is as impossible that it can become and grow out of the existent, as that it could do so out of the non-existent; since the latter, non-existence, is absolutely inconceivable, and the former cannot precede itself; and every coming into existence presupposes a non-existence. By similar arguments divisibility, motion or change, as also infinity, are shut out from the absolutely existent, and the latter is represented as shut up in itself, so that it may be compared to a well-rounded ball; while thought is appropriated to it as its only positive definition. Thought and that which is thought of (Object) coinciding; the corresponding passages of Plato, Aristotle, Theophrastus, and others, which authenticate this view of his theory.\n\nCosmology originally comprised the greater part of his poem, him explaining the world’s origins and operations. John Palmer notes \"Parmenides’ distinction among the principal modes of being and his derivation of the attributes that must belong to what must be, simply as such, qualify him to be seen as the founder of metaphysics or ontology as a domain of inquiry distinct from theology.\" Some idea of the sphericity of the Earth seems to have been known to both Parmenides and Empedocles.\n\nParmenides also outlined the phases of the moon, highlighted in a rhymed translation by Karl Popper:\nSmith stated:Of the cosmogony of Parmenides, which was carried out very much in detail, we possess only a few fragments and notices, which are difficult to understand, according to which, with an approach to the doctrines of the \"Pythagoreans\", he conceived the spherical mundane system, surrounded by a circle of the pure light (Olympus, Uranus); in the centre of this mundane system the solid earth, and between the two the circle of the milkyway, of the morning or evening star, of the sun, the planets, and the moon; which circle he regarded as a mixture of the two primordial elements.\n\nThe fragments read:\nParmenides is one of the most significant of the pre-Socratic philosophers. His single known work, a poem conventionally titled \"On Nature\", has survived only in fragments. Approximately 160 verses remain today from an original total that was probably near 800. The poem was originally divided into three parts:\n\nThe proem is a narrative sequence in which the narrator travels \"beyond the beaten paths of mortal men\" to receive a revelation from an unnamed goddess (generally thought to be Persephone or Dikē) on the nature of reality. \"Aletheia\", an estimated 90% of which has survived, and \"doxa\", most of which no longer exists, are then presented as the spoken revelation of the goddess without any accompanying narrative.\n\nParmenides attempted to distinguish between the unity of nature and its variety, insisting in the \"Way of Truth\" upon the reality of its unity, which is therefore the object of knowledge, and upon the unreality of its variety, which is therefore the object, not of knowledge, but of opinion. In the \"Way of Opinion\" he propounded a theory of the world of seeming and its development, pointing out, however, that, in accordance with the principles already laid down, these cosmological speculations do not pretend to anything more than mere appearance.\n\nIn the proem, Parmenides describes the journey of the poet, escorted by maidens (\"the daughters of the Sun made haste to escort me, having left the halls of Night for the light\"), from the ordinary daytime world to a strange destination, outside our human paths. Carried in a whirling chariot, and attended by the daughters of Helios the Sun, the man reaches a temple sacred to an unnamed goddess (variously identified by the commentators as Nature, Wisdom, Necessity or Themis), by whom the rest of the poem is spoken. The goddess resides in a well-known mythological space: where Night and Day have their meeting place. Its essential character is that here all opposites are undivided, or one. He must learn all things, she tells him – both truth, which is certain, and human opinions, which are uncertain – for though one cannot rely on human opinions, they represent an aspect of the whole truth.\n\nThe section known as \"the way of truth\" discusses that which is real and contrasts with the argument in the section called \"the way of opinion,\" which discusses that which is illusory. Under the \"way of truth,\" Parmenides stated that there are two ways of inquiry: that it \"is\", on the one side, and that it \"is not\". on the other side. He said that the latter argument is never feasible because there is no thing that can \"not be\": \"For never shall this prevail, that things that are not are.\" (B 7.1)\n\nThere are extremely delicate issues here. In the original Greek the two ways are simply named \"that Is\" (ὅπως ἐστίν) and \"that Not-Is\" (ὡς οὐκ ἐστίν) (B 2.3 and 2.5) without the \"it\" inserted in our English translation. In ancient Greek, which, like many languages in the world, does not always require the presence of a subject for a verb, \"is\" functions as a grammatically complete sentence. Much debate has been focused on where and what the subject is. The simplest explanation as to why there is no subject here is that Parmenides wishes to express the simple, bare fact of existence in his mystical experience without the ordinary distinctions, just as the Latin \"pluit\" and the Greek \"huei\" (ὕει \"rains\") mean \"it rains\"; there is no subject for these impersonal verbs because they express the simple fact of raining without specifying what is doing the raining. This is, for instance, Hermann Fränkel's thesis. Many scholars still reject this explanation and have produced more complex metaphysical explanations. Since existence is an immediately intuited fact, non-existence is the wrong path because a thing cannot disappear, just as something cannot originate from nothing. In such mystical experience (\"unio mystica\"), however, the distinction between subject and object disappears along with the distinctions between objects, in addition to the fact that if nothing cannot be, it cannot be the object of thought either:Thinking and the thought that it is are the same; for you will not find thinking apart from what is, in relation to which it is uttered. (B 8.34–36)For to be aware and to be are the same. (B 3)It is necessary to speak and to think what is; for being is, but nothing is not. (B 6.1–2)Helplessness guides the wandering thought in their breasts; they are carried along deaf and blind alike, dazed, beasts without judgment, convinced that to be and not to be are the same and not the same, and that the road of all things is a backward-turning one. (B 6.5–9)Thus, he concluded that \"Is\" could not have \"come into being\" because \"nothing comes from nothing\". Existence is necessarily eternal. That which truly is [x], has always been [x], and was never becoming [x]; that which is becoming [x] was never nothing (Not-[x]), but will never actually be. Parmenides was not struggling to formulate the laws of conservation of mass and conservation of energy; he was struggling with the metaphysics of change, which is still a relevant philosophical topic today.\n\nMoreover, he argued that movement was impossible because it requires moving into \"the void\", and Parmenides identified \"the void\" with nothing, and therefore (by definition) it does not exist. That which does exist is \"The Parmenidean One\", which is timeless, uniform, and unchanging:How could what is perish? How could it have come to be? For if it came into being, it is not; nor is it if ever it is going to be. Thus coming into being is extinguished, and destruction unknown. (B 8.20–22)Nor was [it] once, nor will [it] be, since [it] is, now, all together, / One, continuous; for what coming-to-be of it will you seek? / In what way, whence, did [it] grow? Neither from what-is-not shall I allow / You to say or think; for it is not to be said or thought / That [it] is not. And what need could have impelled it to grow / Later or sooner, if it began from nothing? Thus [it] must either be completely or not at all. (B 8.5–11)[What exists] is now, all at once, one and continuous... Nor is it divisible, since it is all alike; nor is there any more or less of it in one place which might prevent it from holding together, but all is full of what is. (B 8.5–6, 8.22–24)And it is all one to me / Where I am to begin; for I shall return there again. (B 5)\n\nParmenides claimed that there is no truth in the opinions of the mortals. Genesis-and-destruction, as Parmenides emphasizes, is a false opinion, because to be means to be completely, once and for all. What exists can in no way not exist. For this view, that That Which Is Not exists, can never predominate. You must debar your thought from this way of search, nor let ordinary experience in its variety force you along this way, (namely, that of allowing) the eye, sightless as it is, and the ear, full of sound, and the tongue, to rule; but (you must) judge by means of the Reason (Logos) the much-contested proof which is expounded by me. (B 7.1–8.2)\n\nAfter the exposition of the \"arche\" (ἀρχή), i.e. the origin, the necessary part of reality that is understood through reason or logos (\"that [it] Is\"), in the next section, \"the Way of Appearance/Opinion/Seeming\", Parmenides proceeds to explain the structure of the becoming cosmos (which is an illusion, of course) that comes from this origin.\nThe structure of the cosmos is a fundamental binary principle that governs the manifestations of all the particulars: \"the aether fire of flame\" (B 8.56), which is gentle, mild, soft, thin and clear, and self-identical, and the other is \"ignorant night\", body thick and heavy.The mortals lay down and decided well to name two forms (i.e. the flaming light and obscure darkness of night), out of which it is necessary not to make one, and in this they are led astray. (B 8.53–4)The structure of the cosmos then generated is recollected by Aetius (II, 7, 1):\nFor Parmenides says that there are circular bands wound round one upon the other, one made of the rare, the other of the dense; and others between these mixed of light and darkness. What surrounds them all is solid like a wall. Beneath it is a fiery band, and what is in the very middle of them all is solid, around which again is a fiery band. The most central of the mixed bands is for them all the origin and cause of motion and becoming, which he also calls steering goddess and keyholder and Justice and Necessity. The air has been separated off from the earth, vapourized by its more violent condensation, and the sun and the circle of the Milky Way are exhalations of fire. The moon is a mixture of both earth and fire. The \"aether\" lies around above all else, and beneath it is ranged that fiery part which we call heaven, beneath which are the regions around the earth.\n\nThe traditional interpretation of Parmenides' work is that he argued that the every-day perception of reality of the physical world (as described in \"doxa\") is mistaken, and that the reality of the world is 'One Being' (as described in \"aletheia\"): an unchanging, ungenerated, indestructible whole. Under the \"Way of Opinion\", Parmenides set out a contrasting but more conventional view of the world, thereby becoming an early exponent of the duality of appearance and reality. For him and his pupils, the phenomena of movement and change are simply appearances of a changeless, eternal reality. This interpretation could settle because of various wrong translations of the fragments. For example, it is not at all clear that Parmenides refuted that which we call perception. The verb \"noein\", used frequently by Parmenides, could better be translated as 'to be aware of' than as 'to think'. Furthermore, it is hard to believe that 'being' is only within our heads, according to Parmenides.\n\nParmenides' philosophy is presented in the form of poetry. The philosophy he argued was, he says, given to him by a goddess, though the \"mythological\" details in Parmenides' poem do not bear any close correspondence to anything known from traditional Greek mythology:Welcome, youth, who come attended by immortal charioteers and mares which bear you on your journey to our dwelling. For it is no evil fate that has set you to travel on this road, far from the beaten paths of men, but right and justice. It is meet that you learn all things — both the unshakable heart of well-rounded truth and the opinions of mortals in which there is not true belief. (B 1.24–30)It is with respect to this religious/mystical context that recent generations of scholars such as Alexander P. Mourelatos, Charles H. Kahn, and the controversial Peter Kingsley have begun to call parts of the traditional, rational logical/philosophical interpretation of Parmenides into question (Kingsley in particular stating that Parmenides practiced iatromancy). It has been claimed that previous scholars placed too little emphasis on the apocalyptic context in which Parmenides frames his revelation. As a result, traditional interpretations have put Parmenidean philosophy into a more modern, metaphysical context to which it is not necessarily well suited, which has led to misunderstanding of the true meaning and intention of Parmenides' message. The obscurity and fragmentary state of the text, however, renders almost every claim that can be made about Parmenides extremely contentious, and the traditional interpretation has by no means been abandoned.\n\nParmenides' considerable influence on the thinking of Plato is undeniable, and in this respect Parmenides has influenced the whole history of Western philosophy, and is often seen as its grandfather. Even Plato himself, in the \"Sophist\", refers to the work of \"our Father Parmenides\" as something to be taken very seriously and treated with respect. In the \"Parmenides\", the Eleatic philosopher, which may well be Parmenides himself, and Socrates argue about dialectic. In the \"Theaetetus\", Socrates says that Parmenides alone among the wise (Protagoras, Heraclitus, Empedocles, Epicharmus, and Homer) denied that everything is change and motion.\n\nParmenides is credited with a great deal of influence as the author of an \"Eleatic challenge\" that determined the course of subsequent philosophers' enquiries. For example, the ideas of Empedocles, Anaxagoras, Leucippus, and Democritus have been seen as in response to Parmenides' arguments and conclusions.\n\nParmenides' influence on philosophy reaches up till present times. The Italian philosopher Emanuele Severino has founded his extended philosophical investigations on the words of Parmenides. His philosophy is sometimes called Neo Parmenideism, and can be understood as an attempt to build a bridge between the poem on truth and the poem on opinion.\n\nParmenides made the ontological argument against nothingness, \"essentially denying the possible existence of a void\". According to Aristotle, this led Democritus and Leucippus, and many other physicists, to propose the atomic theory, which supposes that everything in the universe is either atoms or voids, specifically to contradict Parmenides' argument. Aristotle himself reasoned, in opposition to atomism, that in a complete vacuum, motion would encounter no resistance, and \"no one could say why a thing once set in motion should stop anywhere; for why should it stop here rather than here? So that a thing will either be at rest or must be moved ad infinitum, unless something more powerful get in its way.\" See also \"horror vacui.\"\n\nErwin Schrödinger identified Parmenides' monad of the \"Way of Truth\" as being the conscious self in \"Nature and the Greeks\". The scientific implications of this view have been discussed by scientist Anthony Hyman.\n\nA shadow of Parmenides' ideas can be seen in the physical concept of Block time, which considers existence to consist of past, present, and future, and the flow of time to be illusory. In his critique of this idea, Karl Popper called Einstein \"Parmenides\". However, Popper did write:\nSo what was really new in Parmenides was his axiomatic-deductive method, which Leucippus and Democritus turned into a hypothetical-deductive method, and thus made part of scientific methodology.\n\n\n"}

Henrici joined the Society of Jesus and made his first profession (first vows) in 1947. After studies in philology at the University of Zürich, he pursued further studies in philosophy and theology at different universities in Rome, Munich and Lyon. He was ordained as a priest in 1958, and in 1965 he made his final religious profession as a Jesuit.\n\nFrom 1960 to 1993 Henrici taught History of Modern Western Philosophy at the Pontifical Gregorian University, Rome, where he also served as Dean of the Faculty of Philosophy up to his appointment as Auxiliary Bishop of Chur. He was one of the much sought after professors at the Gregorian. His occasional lecture courses were often given to classes that were packed to overflowing. In the 1990–91 'A Philosophical Discourse for Theology' in the Faculty of Theology, for example, he gave a thrilling overview of the contributions of philosophy to Christian theology beginning from the doctrine of analogy in Plato and coming down to Heidegger. Again, in the 1990 graduate seminar on 'Methods of Interpreting a Philosophical Text,' with a chapter from Blondel's L'Action (1893), he gave hands-on training in the methods of Internal and External Structure, Lexicology, Metaphorology, Internal and External Sources, Redaktionsgeschichte, Wirkungsgeschichte, and Deutungsgeschichte (self- and other-interpretation).\n\nSince 1993, he served as Visiting Professor at the Theologische Hochschule, Chur, and honorary professor at the University of Zürich.

Commonly chosen outdoor spaces include parks, beaches, art galleries, public squares, outdoor events, and farms. Indoor spaces may include wine shops, grocery stores, or art studios. An integral part of the philosophy of pop-up yoga is its focus on cultivating a harmonious relationship with one's environment.\n\nBecause pop-up yoga is a means of teaching as opposed to a teaching in itself, it is not affiliated with one style of yoga or approach to practice. This allows the teacher of pop-up yoga a freer teaching approach, which results in yoga sessions being more accessible and inclusive. Moreover, in the same spirit of inclusiveness, sessions are offered freely, on a suggested donation basis.\n\nPop-up yoga embraces an atypical teacher-student dynamic. Students are free to contribute to teaching, and are frequently invited to introduce an approach to yoga or meditation. Since pop-up yoga sessions tend to use a location only once, it is useful practice for attendees to suggest future locations.\n\nPop-up yoga has maintained popularity around Europe, especially in large urban areas, the largest being in Amsterdam. In the United States, the first business to actively promote the \"pop up yoga\" concept in name and form was Pop Up Yoga in Charlottesville, VA, with the tagline \"Sprouting Locally\".

{"id": "8233130", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8233130", "title": "Private defense agency", "text": "Private defense agency\n\nA private defense agency (PDA) is an enterprise which would provide personal protection and military defense services to individuals who would voluntarily contract for its services. PDAs are advocated in anarcho-capitalism and market-based forms of social anarchism, such as mutualism.\n\nA PDA is distinguished from a private contractor of the state which is subsidized financially through taxation or legally through monopoly and immunity, and relies on conscription and other involuntary support. Instead, such agencies would be voluntarily financed primarily by competing insurance and security companies, which are penalized for losses and damages, and have a financial incentive to minimize waste and maximize quality of service.\n\nAs proponents of free-market anarchism,\nBenjamin Tucker and Gustave de Molinari first explicitly proposed for-profit private defense agencies.\nThe concept later was advanced and expanded upon by anarcho-capitalists who consider the state to be illegitimate, and therefore believe defense is something that should be provided or determined privately by individuals and firms competing in a free market. The Mises Institute published a book of essays entitled \"\". Murray N. Rothbard in \"\" and David D. Friedman in \"The Machinery of Freedom\" expand substantially on the idea. Both hold that a PDA would be part of a privatized system of law, police, courts, insurance companies and arbitration agencies who are responsible for preventing and dealing with aggression. In this environment, victimless crimes and \"crimes against the state\" would be rendered moot, and the legal realm would be limited to contractual disputes and tort damages, as from assault, burglary, pollution, and all other forms of aggression. This concept is similar to Polycentric law. Within economics, discussion of the concept largely has been confined to the Austrian School, as in Hans Hoppe's article \"The Private Production of Defense\" published by the Mises Institute.\n\nThese authors emphasize that PDAs have different motives from existing statist defense agencies. Their survival depends on quality of service leading to a wide customer base, rather than the ability to extract funds via the force of law, as is true of states. Customers and markets would thus dictate that PDAs minimize offensive tendencies and militarization in favor of a pure defense. Anarcho-capitalists believe such privatization and decentralization of defense would eliminate the credibility of, and popular support for, the state.\n\nAs a private firm offering individually determined defense, the PDA provides a model for how an entirely private defense would work in a free market. John Frederic Kosanke argues that the need for large-scale defense is minimized in direct inverse proportion to the extent of domestic control by the state. Since the greater number of proprietors makes surrender more costly to an aggressor than a relatively authoritarian region, vulnerability to attack is less likely. Furthermore, since individuals minding their own business pose little threat to neighboring regions, official or ideological justification by those neighbors for attacking them is also proportionately diminished.\n\nHoppe points out that there is a contradiction in the beliefs of most philosophers and economists in reference to national defense. They generally hold that any monopoly is \"bad\" for consumers because, shielded from potential new entrants into his area of production, the price of his product X will be higher and its quality lower than otherwise. Yet they simultaneously hold that security must be undertaken by the government, which is a territorial monopoly of law and order (the ultimate decision maker and enforcer). Hoppe holds that the two propositions are clearly incompatible. In his essay \"The Production of Security\", Molinari concluded:\n\nTyler Cowen, however, argues that allowing private defense agencies would not necessarily prevent a monopoly on defense services, by positing that a cooperating network of such firms could use aggressive force to enforce the cartel's market domination. Noting that advocates of PDAs typically argue that abuses would be prevented by the presence of rival agencies acting under the authority of rulings made by arbitrators empowered by inter-agency arbitration agreements, Cowen opines, \"The adjudication network is stable only if it can use force to put down outlaw agencies that do not accept its higher-order arbitration decisions. Such a network could also use force to put down firms that do not adhere to the collusive agreement.\"\n\nAnarcho-capitalists argue that competing defense providers would concentrate on comparatively lower-cost defense and security technology rather than relatively costly offensive weaponry, in order to maintain lower premiums and service charges. A company's offensive capabilities would also be readily exposed by such an aggressor's competitors. State-subsidized militaries, in contrast, are granted a distinct offensive advantage, resulting in a proportionately greater tendency toward monopolization.\n\nRandall G. Holcombe argues that \"Firms might prey on their competitors' customers, as competing mafia groups do, to show those customers that their current protective firm is not doing the job and thus to induce them to switch protection firms. This action seems to be a profit-maximizing strategy; hence, protection firms that do not prey on noncustomers may not survive.\" Holcombe states that mafias offers protection for a fee, but it also uses its resources for predation; and thus profit-maximizing firms could be expected to employ them in the dual roles of protection and predation. Peter Leeson and Edward Stringham rebut this argument by claiming that unless the firm were overwhelmingly more powerful than its prey, it could incur substantial costs and risks in attempting to extract wealth by force. They argue that the potential for even a small state to inflict losses on a larger state explains why violent confrontations between states are less common than between individuals in New York City's Central Park; in other words, it is not the size of the group in question that matters, since in either case being the aggressor is likely to bring about undesirable risks and diminution of resources.\n\nIn \"The Market for Liberty\", Linda and Morris Tannehill note that a private defense agency would be unlikely to engage in aggression, as it would not only become a target of retaliatory force, but would become the subject of severe business ostracism. Honest and productive individuals would dissociate themselves from it, fearing that it might use its aggressive force against them in the event of a dispute; or that they might become accidental casualties when retaliatory force is used by one of its other victims; or that their own reputation would suffer due to their ties to it. Moreover, the private defense agency's reputation would suffer and it would be regarded as a poor credit and insurance risk, the latter due to the high risk of claims resulting from its involvement in aggression. The employees and leaders of such an agency as well could face personal civil liability for their involvement, and the agency would not be shielded by sovereign immunity. High-quality employees would presumably be less willing to be involved with such an organization.\n\nThey also argue that a defense company would be less likely to abuse its power and impose tyranny, noting that it \"couldn't extract taxes from them, as a government does...A market relationship is a free relationship, and if a customer doesn't like a company's service or mistrusts its goals, he is free to take his business elsewhere, or to start his own competitive company, or to do without the service and just provide from himself...The objection that a tyrant might take over is actually a devastating argument against government.\"\n\nRothbard makes a similar point, noting, \"Of course, some of the private defense agencies will become criminal, just as some people become criminal now. But the point is that in a stateless society there would be no regular, \"legalized\" channel for crime and aggression, no government apparatus the control of which provides a secure monopoly for invasion of person and property...To create such an instrument \"de novo\" is very difficult, and, indeed, almost impossible; historically, it took State rulers centuries to create a functioning State apparatus.\"\n\nIt has been argued, \"If Defense Agency A instead of invading a business decides to invade a more worthwhile target such as a gold warehouse they are left with a much more complicated problem. The gold warehouse is owned by an entrepreneur who has his own defense agency and the gold in the warehouse also have owners that have hired their own respective defense agencies. In essence, Defense Agency A will have to deal with the wrath of the warehouse owner, the warehouse owner's defense agency and the defense agencies of all the owners of the gold in that warehouse.\"\n\nRobert P. Murphy opines that given the privatization of other services in an anarcho-capitalist society, \"We must consider that in such an environment, the law-abiding majority would have all sorts of mechanisms at their disposal, beyond physical confrontation. Once private judges had ruled against a particular rogue agency, the private banks could freeze its assets (up to the amount of fines levied by the arbitrators). In addition, the private utility companies could shut down electricity and water to the agency’s headquarters, in accordance with standard provisions in their contracts.\"\n\nThe argument that customers will be able to hire a competing firm to protect them against a rogue defense agency has been critiqued by Jonathan Bond's essay, \"The Price of Private Law\", which argues, \"If two defense firms are engaged in a truly ‘local’ dispute, and the remaining firms are not convinced that either their own interests will be affected or that systemic destabilization will result if the conflict continues, then the costs of intervening and ending the inter-agency war could presumably bar such third parties from stepping into the crossfire.\" Bond also argues that some firms may not be concerned with the risk of alienating other clients, because their clientele may consist of a small number of, or even only one, enormous multinational corporations. Bond further argues that some PDAs may reduce their risk of retaliation by carrying out anonymous sabotage or terrorist attacks.\n\nVillacampa notes that consumers with large amounts of wealth would likely pay more for private defense, stating \"There is no reason for someone void of valuable assets to hire a defense agency that is meant to protect assets other than oneself; but, in an involuntary government payment is demanded for the services regardless of whether they are use or not.\" He argues an alliance of aggressor private defense agencies would likely be unprofitable: \"Chances are high that a mobilization of a mass army of defense agencies will cost more to each individual than his gain from gold, land, and such divided equally amongst themselves. If the region being attacked has large stashes of valuable goods, they will most likely have very effective defense agencies (stronger defense agencies for more valuable assets are logical) and thus the fight against the invading defense agencies will inflict more cost upon the invaders.\"\n\nDefense is often viewed as an archetypical public goodi.e., a product that can only be provided by government because of its non-excludability and non-rivalrous consumption. Specifically, the free rider problem, in which people refuse to pay for defense but instead rely on their neighbors to pay for defending the community, is said to make it inevitable that it be financed by taxes if an equitable allocation of costs is to be achieved. According to anarcho-capitalist theorists, there are many ways by which this problem can be overcome or rendered irrelevant. Rothbard's solution was to simply say \"Who cares?\" when it comes to the issue of free riders. He points out that free riders are commonplace in other aspects of our economy, asking hypothetically, \"Are we to be critical because more than one person benefits from someone's actions?...In short, am I to be taxed for enjoying the view of my neighbor's well-kept garden?\" He notes that we are all free riders on the past, as we would be living in a primitive society if it were not for the efforts of our ancestors; and we are free riders on the present, because we benefit from the continuing investment of our fellow men and from their specialized skills on the market. Joseph R. Stromberg notes that the American Revolution occurred despite the fact that some individuals might have been free riders who benefited from it without funding it; he opines that successful defense of freedom often relies not on precise allocations of cost, but on \"nationalism, religion, the desire for freedom, hatred of the enemy, social pressure to do the right thing, and so on,\" some of which might represent \"enlightened self interest.\"\n\nLinda and Morris Tannehill believe that big businesses will tend to pay the bulk of the defense costs (since they stand to lose the most in the event of an attack); they would then pass on the costs to their customers, and so the costs of defense would be spread out among the whole population. A landowner seeking to establish a community may sell or lease the land with provisions written into the deed or lease agreement, requiring the new owner or tenant to pay for defense on a permanent basis; this same technique has already been in some neighborhoods to ensure that residents pay for private streets shared in common by all of them. As is true for homeowners today, everyone would be responsible for buying or otherwise being covered by aggression insurance in order to protect themselves against catastrophic loss from foreign attack; in the event of an invasion, a claim would be filed with right of subrogation, and the insurer would hire a private defense company to collect from the aggressor. An argument against this method of funding is that other aggression insurers who didn't pay for defense would still benefit from the reduced risk of attack on their customers in the same area, in effect becoming free riders who could drive the \"altruistic\" insurer out of business. However, the private defense agency's activity need not be limited to defensive and retaliatory measures funded by the insurer; It could also go after the aggressor in an effort to obtain restitution (including reasonable collection costs), perhaps through ransom or capture of enemy assets, as privateers did in the 18th and 19th centuries under letters of marque and reprisal. Prisoners of war also used to have shadow prices (ransoms) which were a source of income for victorious forces; this represents another potential alternative to taxation.\n\nSometimes arguments are made for voluntary funding of defense by way of attacking taxation. Anarcho-capitalists often argue, for instance, that the argument that taxation is needed to fund protection of liberty and property from aggression is a contradiction, because taxation itself requires aggression in order to be enforced. Another argument comes from the fact that, unlike voluntary transactions, no demonstrated preference has been made by the taxpayer; so there is no objective way of showing that he is receiving a service he wants and needs, at a price that is fair.\n\nAncient city-states in Greece and Rome depended on liturgycontributions made by rich citizens for specific purposesfor defense. A liturgy might be used, for instance, to fund the manning of a warship. Although a certain amount was assessed by magistrates, some citizens paid more than required in order to obtain popularity, influence, and sympathy among jurors in the event they were taken to court. During the Second Punic War, Quintus Maximus Fabius Verrucosus used his personal resources to pay for the release of some Roman prisoners. When the son of Scipio Africanus, who at the time was acting as de facto commander-in chief, was captured during the war against Antiochus III the Great in 190 BC, he came up with ransom himself. As Rome grew wealthier, greater use was made of private money and/or private armed forces, consisting of relatives and clients, to accomplish public objectives. Between 73 and 71 BC, Marcus Licinius Crassus and Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus used their own resources to suppress the armies of Spartacus in the Third Servile War. Julius Caesar made his fortune by vanquishing pirates in the Mediterranean and then by conquering Gaul. The emergence of the modern state caused the members of the upper classes to be disarmed.\n\nAccording to David Friedman, \"Medieval Icelandic institutions have several peculiar and interesting characteristics; they might almost have been invented by a mad economist to test the lengths to which market systems could supplant government in its most fundamental functions.\" While not directly labeling it anarcho-capitalist, he argues that the Icelandic Commonwealth between 930 and 1262 had \"some features\" of an anarcho-capitalist society – while there was a single legal system, enforcement of law was entirely private and highly capitalist; and so provides some evidence of how such a society would function. \"Even where the Icelandic legal system recognized an essentially \"public\" offense, it dealt with it by giving some individual (in some cases chosen by lot from those affected) the right to pursue the case and collect the resulting fine, thus fitting it into an essentially private system.\"\n\nAccording to the research of Terry L. Anderson and P. J. Hill, the Old West in the United States in the period of 1830 to 1900 was similar to anarcho-capitalism in that \"private agencies provided the necessary basis for an orderly society in which property was protected and conflicts were resolved,\" and that the common popular perception that the Old West was chaotic with little respect for property rights is incorrect. Since squatters had no claim to western lands under federal law, extra-legal organizations formed to fill the void. Benson explains:\n\nAccording to Anderson, \"Defining anarcho-capitalist to mean minimal government with property rights developed from the bottom up, the western frontier was anarcho-capitalistic. People on the frontier invented institutions that fit the resource constraints they faced.\"\n\nThe Mafia began in the 19th century. Modern scholars believe that the seeds were planted in the upheaval of Sicily's transition out of feudalism beginning in 1812 and its later annexation by mainland Italy in 1860. Under feudalism, the nobility owned most of the land and enforced law and order through their private armies. After 1812, the feudal barons steadily sold off or rented their lands to private citizens. Primogeniture was abolished, land could no longer be seized to settle debts, and one fifth of the land became private property of the peasants. After Italy annexed Sicily in 1860, it redistributed a large share of public and church land to private citizens. The result was a huge boom in landowners — from 2,000 in 1812 to 20,000 by 1861. With this increase in property owners and commerce came more disputes that needed settling, contracts that needed enforcing, transactions that needed oversight, and properties that needed protecting. The barons were releasing their private armies to let the state take over the job of enforcing the law, but the new authorities were not up to the task, largely due to their inexperience with capitalism. Lack of manpower was also a problem; there were often fewer than 350 active policemen for the entire island. Some towns did not have any permanent police force, only visited every few months by some troops to collect malcontents, leaving criminals to operate with impunity in the interim. Compounding these problems was banditry; rising food prices, the loss of public and church lands, and the loss of feudal commons pushed many desperate peasants to steal. In the face of rising crime, booming commerce, and inefficient authorities, property owners turned to extralegal arbitrators and protectors. These extralegal protectors eventually organized themselves into the first Mafia clans.\n\n\n"}

He held the position of Gordon-McKay Professor of Aerodynamics and Applied Mathematics at Harvard University. He described his work in his own words shortly before his death as being on\n\nAlthough best known for his mathematical work, Mises also contributed to the philosophy of science as a neo-positivist, following the line of Ernst Mach. Historians of the Vienna Circle of logical empiricism recognize a \"first phase\" from 1907 through 1914 with Philipp Frank, Hans Hahn, and Otto Neurath. His older brother, Ludwig von Mises, held an opposite point of view with respect to positivism and epistemology.\n\nDuring his time in Istanbul, Mises maintained close contact with Philipp Frank, a logical positivist and Professor of Physics in Prague until 1938. His literary interests included the Austrian novelist Robert Musil and the poet Rainer Maria Rilke, on whom he became a recognized expert.\n\nEighteen months after his brother, Ludwig von Mises (who later became a prominent economist of the Austrian School), Richard von Mises was born in Lemberg, part of Austria-Hungary (nowadays Lviv, Ukraine) into a Jewish family. His parents were Arthur Edler von Mises, a doctor of technical sciences who worked as an expert for the Austrian State Railways, and Adele Landau. Richard and Ludwig also had a younger brother, who died as an infant. Richard attended the Akademisches Gymnasium in Vienna, from which he graduated with honors in Latin and mathematics in autumn 1901. After graduating in mathematics, physics and engineering from the Vienna University of Technology, he was appointed as Georg Hamel's assistant in Brünn (now Brno). In 1905, still a student, he published an article on the geometry of curves called \"Zur konstruktiven Infinitesimalgeometrie der ebenen Kurven,\" in the prestigious \"Zeitschrift für Mathematik und Physik\".\nIn 1908 Mises was awarded a doctorate from Vienna (his dissertation was on \"the determination of flywheel masses in crank drives\") and he received his habilitation from Brünn (now Brno) (on \"Theory of the Waterwheels\") to lecture on engineering. In 1909, at 26, he was appointed professor of applied mathematics in Straßburg, then part of the German Empire (now Strasbourg, Alsace, France) and received Prussian citizenship. His application for a teaching position at the Brno University of Technology was interrupted by the First World War.\n\nBefore the war he had already become a pilot and lectured on the design of aircraft, and in 1913 at Strasbourg he gave the first university course on powered flight. On the outbreak of war it was natural for him to join the Austro-Hungarian army as a test pilot and a flying instructor. In 1915, he supervised the construction of a 600-horsepower (450 kW) aircraft – the \"Mises-Flugzeug\" (Mises aircraft) for the Austrian army. It was completed in 1916 but never saw active war service.\n\nAfter the war, Mises held the new chair of hydrodynamics and aerodynamics at the Dresden \"Technische Hochschule\". In 1919 he was appointed director (and full professor) at the new Institute of Applied Mathematics created at the behest of Erhard Schmidt at the University of Berlin. In 1921 he founded the journal \"Zeitschrift für Angewandte Mathematik und Mechanik\" and became its editor.\n\nWith the rise of the National Socialist Party to power in 1933, Mises felt his position threatened, despite his First World War military service. He moved to Turkey, where he held the newly created chair of Pure and Applied Mathematics at the University of Istanbul. In 1939 he accepted a position in the United States, where in 1944 he was appointed as Gordon-McKay Professor of Aerodynamics and Applied Mathematics at Harvard University. He married Hilda Geiringer in 1943; she had been his assistant at the Institute and followed him to Turkey and then to the U.S. after losing her position in December 1933.\n\nIn 1950 Mises declined an offer of honorary membership from the Communist-dominated East German Academy of Science.\n\nIn aerodynamics, von Mises made notable advances in boundary-layer-flow theory and airfoil design. He developed the \"distortion energy theory\" of stress, which is one of the most important concepts used by engineers in material strength calculations.\n\nHis ideas were not unanimously well received, although Alexander Ostrowski had said of him:\n\nand also wrote:\n\nYet Andrey Kolmogorov, whose rival axiomatisation was better received, was less severe:\n\nIn solid mechanics, von Mises made an important contribution to the theory of plasticity by formulating what has become known as the von Mises yield criterion, independently of Tytus Maksymilian Huber.\n\nHe is also often credited for the Principle of Maximum Plastic Dissipation.\n\nThe Gesellschaft für Angewandte Mathematik und Mechanik (International Association of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics) has awarded a Richard von Mises-Preis (Prize) since 1989.\n\nIn probability theory, he was the person who originally proposed the now famous \"birthday problem\". He also defined the impossibility of a gambling system.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was developed during the 1960s and 1970s by the Argentine physicist and metallurgist Jorge Alberto Sábato, of the National Atomic Energy Commission (CNEA, the Argentine government agency overseeing development of nuclear power in the country).\n\nThe idea of the triangle was proposed by John Kenneth Galbraith and developed by Sábato as a model of policy-making in science and technology. The model is based on the concept that in order for a scientific-technological system to exist in practice it is necessary for three sectors to be strongly linked together over the long term: the State (which formulates and implements policy); the scientific and technological infrastructure (which provides technology); and the productive sector (which uses technology). These \"interrelationships\" are portrayed in the form of a triangle.\n\nFurther, each \"vertex\" needs to have strong \"internal relations\", that is to say, relations between the different institutions contained within itself. For example, within the State there needs to be coherence between \"implicit\" policy and \"explicit\" policy, between different ministries and autonomous organizations, and so on. The other factor considered is the \"external relations\" between the \"vertices\" and outside entities.\n\nThe triangle has been used to shed light on technological dependency. The model predicts that the stronger the external relations, the weaker or non-existent will be the interrelationships and the internal relations, and this will delay the country in reducing its dependency.\n\nThe Sábato Triangle won acceptance in several countries of Latin America, having an effect upon science and technology policy there and disseminating the belief that the State had an important role in promoting technology transfer. However, a separation of the three components of the \"triangle\" has still been observed in more recent times.\n\n\n"}

Thus, for example, the \"matter\" for Baptism is water; the \"matter\" for the Eucharist is bread and wine. The \"form\" of a sacrament consists of the words by which the Sacrament is affected. Thus Saint Thomas held that the form of the sacrament of Penance was \"I absolve thee.\"\n\nThe Catechism of the Council of Trent states it this way: \"Every Sacrament consists of two things, matter, which is called the element, and form, which is commonly called the word.\"\n\nThe term \"matter\" should be taken broadly to mean that which underlies the sacrament in a manner similar that the way in which matter underlies substance. Thus the three acts of the penitent are taken to be the matter of Penance: repenting of one's sins, confessing them in words, and doing the penance assigned.\n\nSecondly the form of a sacrament may take significantly different forms in different churches. Thus, for example, though Saint Thomas held the form of Confirmation to be \"I sign thee with the sign of the cross...\", the Byzantine Rite uses the form \"The sign of the seal of the Holy Spirit.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "595872", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=595872", "title": "Sufi whirling", "text": "Sufi whirling\n\nSufi whirling (or Sufi turning) () is a form of physically active meditation which originated among Sufis, and which is still practiced by the Sufi Dervishes of the Mevlevi order and other orders such as the Rifa'i-Marufi. It is a customary meditation practice performed within the Sema, or worship ceremony, through which dervishes (also called \"semazens\", from Persian ) aim to reach the source of all perfection, or kemal. This is sought through abandoning one's nafs, egos or personal desires, by listening to the music, focusing on God, and spinning one's body in repetitive circles, which has been seen as a symbolic imitation of planets in the Solar System orbiting the sun.\n\nThe Mevlevi practice gave rise to an Egyptian form, \"tanoura\", distinguished by the use of a multicolored skirt. This has also developed into a performance dance by non-Sufis, including dancers outside the Islamic world.\n\n\"In the 12th century, Sufi fraternities ( \"ṭarāʾiq\") were first organized as an established leadership in which a member followed a prescribed discipline in service to a sheikh or master in order to establish rapport with him.\" A member of such a fraternity is referred to as a Persian \"darwish.\" These turuk (plural of tariqa) were responsible for organizing an Islamic expression of religious life, often founded by independent saints or resulted from the division of existing orders. Each Sufi tariqa stems from a unique \"silsila\", or \"chain of order\" in which a member must learn, as the \"silsila\" binds each member to Allah through one's chain of order. One's \"silsila\" extends through the member's individual teacher, to their teacher and so on, through time until one is connected to the Prophet and thus Allah. The Prophet himself is revered as the originator of Sufism, which has in turn been traced down through a series of saints.\n\nA dervish practices multiple rituals, the primary of which is the \"dhikr\", a remembering of Allah. The \"dhikr\" involves recitation of devotional Islamic prayer. This \"dhikr\" is coupled with physical exertions of movement, specifically dancing and whirling, in order to reach a state assumed by outsiders to be one of \"ecstatic trances\". As explained by Sufis:\n\nIn the symbolism of the Sema ritual, the semazen's camel's hair hat (sikke) represents the tombstone of the ego; his wide, white skirt (\"tennure\") represents the ego's shroud. By removing his black cloak (\"hırka\"), he is spiritually reborn to the truth. At the beginning of the Sema, by holding his arms crosswise, the semazen appears to represent the number one, thus testifying to God's unity. While whirling, his arms are open: his right arm is directed to the sky, ready to receive God's beneficence; his left hand, upon which his eyes are fastened, is turned toward the earth. The semazen conveys God's spiritual gift to those who are witnessing the Sema. Revolving from right to left around the heart, the semazen embraces all humanity with love. The human being has been created with love in order to love. Mevlâna Jalâluddîn Rumi says, \"All loves are a bridge to Divine love. Yet, those who have not had a taste of it do not know!\"\n\nAmong the Mevlevi order, the practice of \"dhikr\" is performed in a traditional dress: a \"tennure\", a sleeveless white frock, the \"destegul\", a long sleeved jacket, a belt, and a black overcoat or \"khirqa\" to be removed before the whirling begins. As the ritual dance begins, the dervish dons a felt cap, a \"sikke\", in addition to a turban wrapped around the head, a trademark of the Mevlevi order. The sheikh leads the ritual with strict regulations. To begin,\nThe sheikh stands in the most honored corner of the dancing place, and the dervishes pass by him three times, each time exchanging greetings, until the circling movement starts. The rotation itself is on the left foot, the center of the rotation being the ball of the left foot and the whole surface of the foot staying in contact with the floor. The impetus for the rotation is provided by the right foot, in a full 360-degree step. If a dervish should become too enraptured, another Sufi, who is in charge of the orderly performance, will gently touch his frock in order to curb his movement, The dance of the dervishes is one of the most impressive features of the mystical life in Islam, and the music accompanying it is of exquisite beauty, beginning with the great hymn in honor of the Prophet (na't-i sharif, written by Jalaluddin himself) and ending with short, enthusiastic songs, some things sung in Turkish.\n\nThe Western world, having witnessed Sufi whirling through tourism, have described the various forms of \"dhikr\" as \"barking, howling, dancing, etc.\" The practice of each \"tariqa\" is unique to its individual order, specific traditions and customs may differ across countries. The same \"tariqa\" in one country will not mirror that of another country as each order's ritual stresses \"emotional religious life\" in various forms. The Mevleviyah order, like many others, practice the \"dhikr\" by performing a whirling meditation. Accompanying the \"dhikr\" practices of whirling and prayer, the custom of \"sama\" serves to further one's \"nourishment of the soul\" through devotional \"hearing\" of the \"'subtle' sounds of the hidden world or of the cosmos.\" In contrast to the use of \"sama\", whirling and devotional prayer in the practice of \"dhikr\", the \"tariqa\" orders perform Sufi whirling in addition to playing musical instruments, consuming glowing embers, live scorpions and glass, puncturing body parts with needles and spikes, or practicing clairvoyance and levitation. The dervish practice can be performed by community residents or lay members, members have typically been those of lower classes. Within Islamic faith, unlike Middle Eastern law, women have equal status to men, allowing women to participate in \"dhikr\" as dervishes themselves. Women were received into a \"tariqa\" order by a male sheikh, but traditionally were instructed to practice the \"dhikr\" alone or with an established branch of females within a specific order. Sufi whirling, a worship of \"dhikr\", became a gender and class neutral practice throughout the Central Islamic region.\n\nThe custom of \"sama\" among Sufi orders has a history of controversy within the Islamic faith. In one argument, the use of the term \"sama\" is considered to suggest physically \"listening\" in a spiritual context. A differing opinion argues that \"sama\" is in fact \"hearing\", as \"to hear\" can pertain to any sound in addition to any \"subtle\" sounds of the spiritual realm. Those in support of \"sama\" further claim that the term is actually synonymous with \"understanding\" and therefore recognition and application of the Revelation as well as the act of \"attaining higher knowledge.\" The spread of \"sama\" among Sufi orders began some time around the mid 3rd/9th century C.E. in Baghdad, eventually finding acceptance and favor in Persian, Turkish and Indian Islam. The custom of \"sama\" evolved in practice over time as it complimented Sufi \"dhkir\", whirling and among some orders dancing and a meal. Rules of propriety and conditions were adopted upon the widespread concern surrounding the necessity of \"sama\" with the \"dhikr\"; in order to distinguish between entertainment and valuable spiritual practice, the \"sama\" was distinguished as heard from the ego, heart or spirit. Despite the application of rules, some sheikhs continued to limit or disapprove the practice of \"sama\". While controversy continuously questioned the place of \"sama\" in Sufi orders, the music itself was not affected. More recently, the custom of \"sama\" is most commonly performed within a \"dhikr\" ceremony. Those in support of \"sama\" continue to argue that \"according to that which it is not \"sama\" and dance which induce ecstasy, but ecstasy which arouses dance, or furthermore, that \"sama\" is only a revealing instrument and that it only supplies that which is brought to it by the hearer.\"\n\nIn 2005, UNESCO proclaimed the \"Mevlevi Sema Ceremony\" of Turkey as one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.\n\nDervish communities, in the Middle Ages, served a central role in social, religious and political life throughout \"central Islamic lands.\" Dervish orders were at one time much larger in size than they are today, as the government has taken control over most Dervish monasteries throughout this area. In 1925, Turkey ordered the dissolution of all Sufi fraternities by decree, the Mevlevi managed to survive among small villages throughout the Middle East. In 1954, the Turkish government granted the Mevlevi order a special permission to perform ritual whirling practices for tourists during two weeks each year. Outside of tourist entertainment, Orthodox theologians have now vocally discounted the Dervish practice resulting in \"faqirs\", or wandering, mendicant dervishes throughout central Islamic regions. Despite strict government control over Dervish practices, the Mevleviyah order continued its existence in Turkey to this day.\n\nWhile only men have historically been permitted to take part in the ceremony, some communities now allow women to participate.\n\nIn Egypt, the practice of whirling has been adapted as tanoura ( \"\"). The word \"tanoura\" or \"tannoura\" refers to the colorful skirt worn by the whirler, with a color representing each Sufi order. The word may also refer to the dancer, traditionally a Sufi man. Tanoura is associated with Sufism and is performed at Sufi festivals, but it is also performed by non-Sufis as a folk dance or concert dance.\n\nAlthough it is mainly used for visual effects, the dancers also augment their balance with the tanoura, through a dynamic centrifugal effect.\n\nIn Sufi shrines in Pakistan, such as the Lal shrine in Sehwan, Sindh, the practice of Sufi whirling is called \"Dhamaal\" and is performed to honor Sufi saints, or qalandars. Unlike the Turkish practice, Dhamaal may be practiced by any devotee – priests as well as pilgrims. Dhamaal is usually preceded by the beating of a drum (naghara) and ringing of bells, as pilgrims raise their hands, start to skip steps standing at one place and gradually work into a trance as the beats get faster. As the beats get faster, rhythms change and the drum beats are accompanies by the playing of shehnai.\n\nPractitioners associate the dance with Lal Shahbaz Qalandar and with protests following the Battle of Karbala. They regard the rhythm of the drum to evoke the rhythm of the creation of the universe, as illustrated in the concept of \"Kun Fyakun\".\n\nThe tanoura tradition has attracted some interest from Westerners in the belly dancing community. These performers include both men and women, solo and in groups. Such performances may be augmented with pyrotechnics or props, such as veils, wings and ribbons.\nThe techniques used in Egyptian Tanoura can also be adopted by belly dancers to help with their balance and control dizziness.\n\nSufi whirling has also been promoted by actor and memoirist Annabelle Gurwitch as a form of stress relief.\n\nA defining feature of whirling is continuous rotation (clockwise or counterclockwise) around a central radical axis while avoiding vertigo. In untrained dancers, this sustained rotation causes dizziness or motion-induced vertigo. Training for whirling , which is responsible for balance functions in humans. To counteract this effect, whirling dance performers practice various balancing and psychological techniques .\n\nGuinness World Records for \"most Sufi whirls in one hour\" were awarded in London in 2012, to Shafik Ibrahim Abd El Hamed in the male category with 2,905 rotations, and Tara Lee Oakley in the female category with 2,191. These records were surpassed in Zurich in 2015 by Nicole McLaren, with 3,552 rotations.\n\nThe longest continuous whirling performance has been recorded at more than four hours. The most people simultaneously whirling is 755, set in Taiwan in 2011.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2052891", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2052891", "title": "Verisimilitude", "text": "Verisimilitude\n\nVerisimilitude (or truthlikeness) is a philosophical concept that distinguishes between the relative and apparent (or seemingly so) truth and falsity of assertions and hypotheses. The problem of verisimilitude is the problem of articulating what it takes for one false theory to be closer to the truth than another false theory.\n\nThis problem was central to the philosophy of Karl Popper, largely because Popper was among the first to affirm that truth is the aim of scientific inquiry while acknowledging that most of the greatest scientific theories in the history of science are, strictly speaking, false. If this long string of purportedly false theories is to constitute progress with respect to the goal of truth, then it must be at least possible for one false theory to be closer to the truth than others.\n\nPopper assumed that scientists are interested in highly informative theories, in part for methodological reasons—the more informative a theory, the easier it is to test, and the greater its predictive power. But clearly informative power by itself is rather easy to come by, and we do not want to gain content by sacrificing truths. So Popper proposed that closeness to the truth is a function of two factors—truth and content. The more truths that a theory entails (other things being equal) the closer it is to the truth. \n\nIntuitively at least, it seems that Newton's theory of motion entails a good many more truths than does, say, Aristotle's theory—despite the fact that both are known to have flaws. Even two true theories can have differing degrees of verisimilitude, depending on how much true information they deliver. For example, the claim \"it will be raining on Thursday next week,\" if true, is closer to the truth than the true yet logically weaker claim \"it will either be raining next Thursday or it will be sunny\".\n\nPopper's formal definition of verisimilitude was challenged since 1974 by Pavel Tichý, John Henry Harris, and David Miller, who argued that Popper's definition has an unintended consequence: that no false theory can be closer to the truth than another. Popper himself stated: \"I accepted the criticism of my definition within minutes of its presentation, wondering why I had not seen the mistake before.\" This result gave rise to a search for an account of verisimilitude that did not deem progress towards the truth an impossibility.\n\nSome of the new theories (e.g. those proposed by David Miller and by Theo Kuipers) build on Popper's approach, guided by the notion that truthlikeness is a function of a truth factor and a content factor. Others (e.g. those advanced by in collaboration with , by Mortensen, and by Ken Gemes) are also inspired by Popper's approach but locate what they believe to be the error of Popper's proposal in his overly generous notion of content, or consequence, proposing instead that the consequences that contribute to closeness to truth must be, in a technical sense, \"relevant\". A different approach (already proposed by Tichý and and developed especially by Ilkka Niiniluoto and Graham Oddie) takes the \"likeness\" in truthlikeness literally, holding that a proposition's likeness to the truth is a function of the overall likeness to the actual world of the possible worlds in which the proposition would be true. An attempt to use the notion of point-free metric space is proposed by Giangiacomo Gerla. There is currently a debate about whether or to what extent these different approaches to the concept are compatible.\n\nAnother problem in Popper's theory of verisimilitude is the connection between truthlikeness as the goal of scientific progress, on the one hand, and methodology, on the other hand, as the ways in which we can to some extent ensure that scientific research actually approaches this goal. Popper conceived of his definition as a justification of his own preferred methodology: falsificationism, in the following sense: suppose theory A is closer to the truth than theory B according to Popper's qualitative definition of verisimilitude; in this case, we will (or should, if that definition had been logically sound) have that all true consequences of B (ie: all predicted consequences of theory B's mathematical and physical predictions subject to a particular set of initial conditions) are consequences of [theory] A (['s] similarly predicted consequences – i.e., informally, B ≤ A), and that all false consequences of A are consequences of B (in that those set of events deemed impossible by theory A are a subset of those events deemed impossible B, subject to the same initial data conditions for both – i.e., informally, ¬B ≥ ¬A, so that ¬A ≤ ¬B); this means that, if A and B are so related, then it should be the case that all \"known\" false empirical consequences of A also follow from B, and all \"known\" true empirical consequences of B do follow from A. So, if A were closer to the truth than B, then A should be better corroborated than B by any possible amount of empirical evidence. Lastly, this easy theorem allows interpretation of the fact that A is actually better corroborated than B as a \"corroboration of the hypothesis\" (or 'meta-hypothesis') that A is more verisimilar than B.\n\n"}

He is an important figure in the history of philosophy in Poland. On the Moon there is a crater, \"Vitello\", named after him.\n\nWitelo's mother was from a Polish knightly house, while his father was a German settler from Thuringia. He called himself, in Latin, \"Thuringorum et Polonorum filius\" — \"a son of Thuringians and Poles.\" He studied at Padua University about 1260, then went on to Viterbo. He became friends with William of Moerbeke, the translator of Aristotle. Witelo's major surviving work on optics, \"Perspectiva\", completed in about 1270–78, was dedicated to William. In 1284 he described reflection and refraction of light.\n\nWitelo's \"Perspectiva\" was largely based on the work of the polymath Alhazen (Ibn al-Haytham; d. ca. 1041) and in turn powerfully influenced later scientists, in particular Johannes Kepler. Witelo's treatise in optics was closely linked to the Latin version of Ibn al-Haytham's Arabic opus: \"Kitab al-manazir\" (\"The Book of Optics\"; \"De aspectibus\" or \"Perspectivae\"), and both were printed in the Friedrich Risner edition \"Opticae Thesaurus\" (Basel, 1572).\n\nWitelo's \"Perspectiva\", which rested on Ibn al-Haytham's research in optics, influenced also the Renaissance theories of perspective. Lorenzo Ghiberti's \"Commentario terzo\" (\"Third Commentary\") was based on an Italian translation of Witelo's Latin tract: \"Perspectiva\".\n\nWitelo's treatise also contains much material in psychology, outlining views that are close to modern notions on the association of ideas and on the subconscious.\n\n\"Perspectiva\" also includes Platonic metaphysical discussions. Witelo argues that there are intellectual and corporeal bodies, connected by causality (corresponding to the Idealist doctrine of the universal and the actual), emanating from God in the form of Divine Light. Light itself is, for Witelo, the first of all sensible entities, and his views on light are similar to those held by Roger Bacon, though he is closer in this to Alhazen's legacy.\n\nIn \"Perspectiva\", Witelo refers to other works that he had written. Most of these do not survive, but \"De Natura Daemonum\" and \"De Primaria Causa Paenitentiae\" have been recovered.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was married to Dr Yehudit Elkana and had four children.\n\nBorn as László Fröhlich to Hungarian-speaking Jewish parents in Yugoslavia, Elkana moved with his family to Szeged in 1944. That same year, Elkana and his parents were dispatched to Auschwitz. His family escaped the gas chambers when the Nazis transferred them to Austria as corvée labourers for the reconstruction of war-torn cities. In 1948, at the age of 14, he immigrated to Israel. He took up residence in Kibbutz HaZore'a, but health problems impeded Elkana from performing physical tasks. The kibbutz helped him acquire a scholarship to The Herzliya Hebrew Gymnasium in Tel Aviv. Soon after beginning his studies, Elkana decided he wished to be a philosopher and a historian of science. In 1955 he took up the study of mathematics and physics at the Hebrew University. He taught at Gymnasia Rehavia while undertaking his Master's degree, which meant that it took him 11 years to complete it. He then obtained a doctorate from Brandeis University with a thesis on \"On the Emergence of the Energy Concept\" in 1968, which formed the basis for his book, \"The discovery of the conservation of energy\" (1974). After receiving his Ph.D. he taught at Harvard University for a year. When he returned to the Hebrew University in Jerusalem he was named chairman of the department of the history and philosophy of science, becoming in the meantime Director of the Van Leer Jerusalem Institute in 1968, a post he held until 1993.\n\nHe has taught at Harvard University, and has been a Fellow of the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University (1973–1974), a Visiting Fellow at All Souls College, Oxford (1977–1978), a visiting researcher at the Einstein Papers Project at Caltech and was Director of the Cohn Institute for the History and Philosophy of Science and Ideas at Tel Aviv University from 1981 to 1991. From 1995 to 1999 he was professor of Theory of Science at ETH Zurich. He was a permanent fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study, Berlin (\"Wissenschaftskolleg Berlin\").\n\nElkana was a corresponding member of the International Academy for the History of Science as well as, since 1997, member of the Science Board of Advisors of the \"Collegium Helveticum\" in Zürich. He was a co-founder and editor of the scientific journal \"Science in Context\".\n\nDuring his tenure at the Wissenschaftskolleg in 2009/10 he began to work on a global initiative to reform undergraduate university curricula, in order to tackle the problems he outlined in earlier public appearances. This resulted in the foundation of the Curriculum Reform Forum. Until shortly before his death he worked with his co-author Hannes Klöpper on his last major work entitled: \"Die Universität im 21. Jahrhundert: Für eine neue Einheit von Lehre, Forschung und Gesellschaft\", which was published in October 2012. An English version is in the works.\n\nIn 1999, Elkana began his tenure as President and Rector of the Central European University, succeeding Josef Jarab. The third rector of the university in nine years, Elkana held the post until being replaced in August 2009 by John Shattuck. Early in his tenure, Elkana came under fire for his handling of the dismissal of the head of the Program for Gender and Culture and the firing of a part-time professor in that program. Describing himself as a \"lifelong feminist\", Elkana said that while he understood the furor over the incident as he felt that women are often treated unfairly, his decision was sound. He oversaw the reorganization of the department of environmental sciences, halving the ratio of students to professors by both decreasing the number of students within the program and hiring additional professors. By the end of Elkana's term the Department of Environmental Sciences and Policy had become one of the most successful Departments at CEU in terms of the number of applicants and external research funding.\n\nDuring Elkana's term five new Departments: Philosophy, Mathematics, Sociology and Social Anthropology, and Public Policy as well as 15 research centers including the Center for Cognitive Science (from 2010 the Department of Cognitive Science), the Center for Ethics and Law in Biomedicine (CELAB) and the Center for Policy Studies (CPS) were established at CEU. CEU received its institutional accreditation from the Middle States Commission on Higher Education ) and was legally recognized as a Hungarian University, which allowed it to participate in various European Union research and education programs. In particular, three prestigious Erasmus Mundus programs in Environmental Sciences, Policy and Management (2005), Public Policy (2006) and Gender Studies (2007) were launched at CEU.\n\nFollowing his retirement in 2009, Elkana was granted the title of President and Rector Emeritus.\n\nIn 1988, in an article published in Haaretz, Elkana challenged what the role of memories of the Holocaust, which he called 'the central axis of our national experience,' in Israeli identity. He criticized the custom of repeatedly taking schoolchildren to Yad Vashem. For Elkana, Holocausts can happen to any people, and the message is universal. When \"anomalous incidents\" are reported, referring to things done to Palestinians, the initial reactions of his acquaintances, he claimed, were to deny such things happened, or to dismiss them as symptomatic of a reciprocal hatred between Israelis and Palestinians. Elkana's own view is that: \n\nthere is no \"anomalous incident\" that I have not seen with my own eyes. I mean this literally: I was an eye-witness to incident after incident; I saw a bulldozer bury people alive, I saw a rioting mob tear away the life-support system from old people in the hospital, I saw soldiers breaking the arms of a civilian population, including children. For me all this is not new. At the same time I do not generalize: I do not think that they all hate us; I do not think that all Jews hate the Arabs; I do not hate those responsible for the \"anomalies\" - but that does not mean that I condone their acts or that I do not expect them to be punished with the full severity of the law.\n\nHe confessed that his personal conviction was that:\n\nthe deepest political and social factor that motivates much of Israeli society in its relations with the Palestinians is not personal frustration, but rather a profound existential \"Angst\" fed by a particular interpretation of the lessons of the Holocaust and the readiness to believe that the whole world is against us, and that we are the eternal victim,\n\nand in this sense had come to the conclusion that this was 'the tragic and paradoxical victory of Hitler.' For Elkana,'any philosophy of life nurtured solely or mostly by the Holocaust leads to disastrous consequences,' and Thomas Jefferson was correct in his view that democracy and worship of the past were incompatible. While it may be the duty of the world to remember the Holocaust, he argued, 'we' must learn to forget, for the penetration of such memories deep within Israeli national consciousness, in his view, was the greatest threat to the state of Israel.\n\nDelivering the opening address, 'Einstein's Legacy', for Germany's Einstein Year (2005) celebrating the centenary of Einstein's annus mirabilis, Yehuda remarked:\n\nI love Israel and feel a deep loyalty towards it, and hope for its continued existence, and at the same time I warn against strong nationalist tendencies which may endanger the democratic character of the state (I never accepted that there can be such a thing as a genuinely democratic Jewish state, nor can any other religion-based state be fully democratic) ... when I publicly called for 'The need to forget', against the political manipulation of the Holocaust in Israel (by right-wing and left-wing governments equally), and at the same time I oppose tendencies by some in Germany who wish to 'close the chapter' of the Holocaust, I do not think that I am being inconsistent ... Israel should leave to the individual the memory he or she wishes to keep up or even to cultivate, while Germany must continuously, publicly, remember that this chapter can and should not be closed.\n\n\n"}
