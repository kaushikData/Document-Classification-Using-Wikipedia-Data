It is the main statement of Bradley's metaphysics and is considered his most important book. The work was an early influence on Bertrand Russell, who, however, later rejected Bradley's views.\n\nBradley's works were influenced by Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel.\n\n\"Appearance and Reality\" is considered Bradley's most important book. According to Ronald W. Clark, its publication helped to \"wrest the philosophical initiative from the Continent.\" In 1894, the work was reviewed by J. M. E. McTaggart in \"Revue de métaphysique et de morale\", and Josiah Royce in \"The Philosophical Review\". \"Appearance and Reality\" was an early influence on Bertrand Russell, encouraging him to question contemporary dogmas and beliefs. Russell recalled that \"Appearance and Reality\" had a profound appeal not only to him but to most of his contemporaries, and that G. F. Stout had stated that Bradley \"had done as much as is humanly possible in ontology.\" While Russell later rejected Bradley's views, he continued to regard \"Appearance and Reality\" with \"the greatest respect\".\n\nRichard Wollheim comments that the second edition of \"Appearance and Reality\" contains considerable new material, and should be consulted in preference to the original edition. According to the British philosopher Timothy Sprigge, some of Bradley's arguments are famous. Sprigge suggests that Bradley's absolute idealism in some respects received a better presentation in Bradley's subsequent work \"Essays on Truth and Reality\" (1914) than in \"Appearance and Reality\". Thomas Mautner comments that Bradley's \"bold metaphysics\" is presented with \"pugnacious verve\".\n\n"}

It borrows from the broader fields of research ethics and medical ethics.\n\nMost directly a local institutional review board oversees the clinical research ethics of any given clinical trial. The institutional review board understands and acts according to local and national law. Each countries national law is guided by international principles, such as the Belmont Report's directive that all study participants have a right to \"respect for persons\", \"beneficence\", and \"justice\" when participating in clinical research.\n\nParticipants in clinical research have rights which they should expect, including the following:\n\nThere is a range of autonomy which study participants may have in deciding their participation in clinical research. One of the measures for safeguarding this right is the use of informed consent for clinical researches. Researchers refer to populations which have low autonomy as \"vulnerable populations\"; these are groups which may not be able to fairly decide for themselves whether to participate in clinical trials. Examples of groups which are vulnerable populations include incarcerated persons, children, prisoners, soldiers, people under detention, migrants, persons exhibiting insanity or any other condition which precludes their autonomy, and to a lesser extent, any population for which there is reason to believe that the research study could seem particularly or unfairly persuasive or misleading. There are particular ethical problems using children in clinical trials.\n\n"}
{"id": "2158184", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2158184", "title": "Credential", "text": "Credential\n\nA credential is an attestation of qualification, competence, or authority issued to an individual by a third party with a relevant\" or \"de facto\" authority or assumed competence to do so.\n\nExamples of credentials include academic diplomas, academic degrees, certifications, security clearances, identification documents, badges, passwords, user names, keys, powers of attorney, and so on. Sometimes publications, such as scientific papers or books, may be viewed as similar to credentials by some people, especially if the publication was peer reviewed or made in a well-known journal or reputable publisher.\n\nA person holding a credential is usually given documentation or secret knowledge (\"e.g.,\" a password or key) as proof of the credential. Sometimes this proof (or a copy of it) is held by a third, trusted party. While in some cases a credential may be as simple as a paper membership card, in other cases, such as diplomacy, it may involve presentation of letters directly from the issuer of the credential detailing its faith in the person representing them in a negotiation or meeting.\n\nCounterfeiting of credentials is a constant and serious problem, irrespective of the type of credential. A great deal of effort goes into finding methods to reduce or prevent counterfeiting. In general, the greater the perceived value of the credential, the greater the problem with counterfeiting and the greater the lengths to which the issuer of the credential must go to prevent fraud.\n\nIn diplomacy, credentials, also known as a letter of credence, are documents that ambassadors, diplomatic ministers, plenipotentiary, and chargés d'affaires provide to the government to which they are accredited, for the purpose, chiefly, of communicating to the latter the envoy's diplomatic rank. It also contains a request that full credence be accorded to his official statements. Until his credentials have been presented and found in proper order, an envoy receives no official recognition. \n\nThe credentials of an ambassador or minister plenipotentiary are signed by the head of state, those of a chargé d'affaires by the foreign minister. Diplomatic credentials are granted and withdrawn at the pleasure of the issuing authority, based on widely varying criteria. A receiving government may reject a diplomat’s credentials by declining to receive them, but in practice this rarely happens.\n\nIn medicine, the process of credentialing is a detailed review of all permissions granted a medical doctor, physician assistant or nurse practitioner at every institution at which he or she has worked in the past, to determine a risk profile for them at a new institution. It vets the practitioner for both receiving practice insurance and the ability to bill to insurance for patient care. As well, it certifies legal and administrative body requirements, such as the Joint Commission. \n\nMedical practitioners must also have credentials in the form of licenses issued by the government of the jurisdictions in which they practice, which they obtain after suitable education, training, and/or practical experience. Most medical credentials are granted for a practice specific group. They may also be withdrawn in the event of fraud or malpractice by their holders. Typically they require continuing education validation and renewal to continue practice.\n\nInformation systems commonly use credentials to control access to information or other resources. The classic combination of a user's account number or name and a secret password is a widely used example of IT credentials. An increasing number of information systems use other forms of documentation of credentials, such as biometrics (fingerprints, voice recognition, retinal scans), X.509, public key certificates, and so on.\n\nOperators of vehicles such as automobiles, boats, and aircraft must have credentials in the form of government-issued licenses in many jurisdictions. Often the documentation of the license consists of a simple card or certificate that the operator keeps on his person while operating the vehicle, backed up by an archival record of the license at some central location. Licenses are granted to operators after a period of successful training and/or examination.\n\nThis type of credential often requires certification of good health and may also require psychological evaluations and screening for substance abuse.\n\nOperator licenses often expire periodically and must be renewed at intervals. Renewal may simply be a formality, or it may require a new round of examinations and training.\n\nCredentials in cryptography establish the identity of a party to communication. Usually they take the form of machine-readable cryptographic keys and/or passwords. Cryptographic credentials may be self-issued, or issued by a trusted third party; in many cases the only criterion for issuance is unambiguous association of the credential with a specific, real individual or other entity. Cryptographic credentials are often designed to expire after a certain period, although this is not mandatory. An x.509 certificate is an example of a cryptographic credential.\n\nIn military and government organizations, and some private organizations, a system of compartmenting information exists to prevent the uncontrolled dissemination of information considered to be sensitive or confidential. Persons with a legitimate need to have access to such information are issued \"security clearances,\" which can be tracked and verified to ensure that no unauthorized persons gain access to protected information.\n\nSecurity clearances are among the most carefully guarded credentials. Often they are granted to individuals only after a lengthy investigation and only after their need to have access to protected information has been adequately justified to the issuing authority. The most elaborate security-clearance systems are found in the world's military organizations. Some credentials of this type are considered so sensitive that their holders are not even permitted to acknowledge that they have them (except to authorized parties). Documentation of security clearances usually consists of records keep at a secure facility and verifiable on demand from authorized parties.\n\nBreaches of security involving security clearances are often punished by specific statutory law, particularly if they occur in the context of deliberate espionage, whereas most other counterfeiting and misuse of credentials is punished by law only when used with deliberate intent to defraud in specific contexts. Security clearances are regularly withdrawn when they are no longer justified, or when the person holding them is determined to be too great a security risk.\n\nIn many democratic nations, press credential are not required at the national or federal level for any publication of any kind. However, individual corporations, and certain government or military entities require press credentials, such as a press pass, as a formal invitation to members of the press which grants them rights to photographs or videos, press conferences, or interviews. Press credentials indicate that a person has been verified as working for a known publication, and holding a press pass typically allows that person special treatment or access rights.\n\nSome governments impose restrictions on who may work as a journalist, requiring anyone working for the press to carry government-issued credentials. Restricting press credentials can be problematic because of its limitations on freedom of the press, particularly if government leaders selectively grant, withhold, or withdraw press credentials to disallow critique of government policy. Any press coverage published under governments that restrict journalism in this way is often treated with skepticism by others, and may not be considered any more truthful or informative than propaganda.\n\nSome trades and professions in some jurisdictions require special credentials of anyone practicing the trade or profession. These credentials may or may not be associated with specific competencies or skills. In some cases, they exist mainly to control the number of people who are allowed to exercise a trade or profession, in order to control salaries and wages.\n\nPersons acting as merchants, freelancers, etc., may require special credentials in some jurisdictions as well. Here again, the purpose is mainly to control the number of people working in this way, and sometimes also to track them for tax-reporting or other purposes like people evaluation.\n\nThe academic and professional world makes very extensive use of credentials, such as diplomas, degrees, certificates, and certifications, in order to attest to the completion of specific training or education programs by students, to attest to their successful completion of tests and exams, and to provide independent validation of an individual's possession of the knowledge, skills, and ability necessary to practice a particular occupation competently.\n\nDocumentation of academic and professional credentials usually consists of a printed, formal document. The issuing institution often maintains a record of the credential as well. Academic credentials are normally valid for the lifetime of the person to whom they are issued. Professional certifications are normally valid for a limited number of years, based on the pace of change in the certified profession, and require periodic recertification through reexamination (to demonstrate continuing competency as occupational standards of practice evolve) or continuing professional development (to demonstrate continually enhanced competency). \n\nAcquisition of these credentials often leads to increased economic mobility and work opportunity, especially for low-income people.\n\nTitles are credentials that identify a person as belonging to a specific group, such as nobility or aristocracy, or a specific command grade in the military, or in other largely symbolic ways. They may or may not be associated with specific authority, and they do not usually attest to any specific competence or skill (although they may be associated with other credentials that do).

{"id": "1041580", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1041580", "title": "Edward Stachura", "text": "Edward Stachura\n\nEdward Stachura (18 August 1937 – 24 July 1979) was a Polish poet and writer. He rose to prominence in the 1960s, receiving prizes for both poetry and prose. His literary output includes four volumes of poetry, three collections of short stories, two novels, a book of essays, and the final work, \"Fabula rasa\", which is difficult to classify. In addition to writing, Stachura translated literature from Spanish and French, most notably works of Jorge Luis Borges, Gaston Miron and Michel Deguy. He also wrote songs, and occasionally performed them. He committed suicide at the age of forty-one.<br> \n\nEdward Stachura was born on 18 August 1937 to a family of Polish emigrants in Charvieu-Chavagneux, department of Isère, in eastern France. He was the second of four children of Stanisław and Jadwiga Stachura (née Stępkowska) who met in France after having emigrated in the early 1920s in search of work.\n\nStachura spent the first eleven years of his life in France. The family lived in a large tenement house shared by a multilingual mix of emigrants; Stachura would later describe it in his first novel as \"this great Tenement of Babel, where apart from the Poles, who called the tune, there was a mass of Greeks, Albanians, Armenians, Italians, Arabs, and other representatives of nations.\" Stachura attended a French school and, once a week, the Polish school, a teacher having been provided by the consulate. His brother Ryszard, eight years his senior, says that young Edward was courteous, caring, and likeable, but unusually stubborn: in school he had a habit of correcting his teachers if their ideas were at odds with those he got from other sources.\nIn 1948 the family moved to Poland and settled down in a one-room thatched house in the village of Łazieniec near Aleksandrów Kujawski, the mother's inheritance. Stachura finished grade school in Aleksandrów Kujawski in 1952, completing the program in just three years, even though, according to his mother, his skills in Polish were at first inadequate. He began high school in Ciechocinek. Originally Stachura planned a career in electrical engineering, and he also liked biology and geography, but his interests gradually shifted toward the visual arts and literature. Following conflicts with the school and with his father, Stachura moved to join his brother in Gdynia where he finished high school, graduating in 1956. During that time he published his first poems. After an unsuccessful attempt at enrolling in an arts college, he returned home, working menial jobs, writing poetry, and corresponding with other young writers. He then moved to Toruń, where he audited lectures in the art department at Nicolaus Copernicus University, and participated in the literary movement of the city.\n\nStachura enrolled at the Catholic University of Lublin in 1957, majoring in French Philology. Struggling with difficult financial conditions, he continued writing and actively seeking opportunities to publish his works. He interrupted his studies at CUL twice, and after travelling around the country in 1959 and 1960 he finally transferred to the University of Warsaw, his move to the capital motivated primarily by a desire to facilitate the publication of his work. He continued writing, publishing poetry in periodicals, and he engaged actively in the life of the literary milieu. The year 1962 marked two important events in Stachura's life: the first book publication—a collection of short stories titled \"Jeden dzień\" (\"One Day\"); and his marriage to Zyta Anna Bartkowska—the future author of novels and short stories published under the pseudonym of Zyta Oryszyn. The following year Stachura published his first book of poetry, \"Dużo ognia\" (\"Lots of Fire\"). Despite continuing financial difficulties, he graduated in 1965 with a master's degree in Romance Philology; his thesis discussed the work of Henri Michaux.\n\nThe years following the graduation saw a flowering of Stachura's work. The second collection of short stories, \"Falując na wietrze\" (\"Waving in the Wind\"), was published in 1966. The book received the annual Prize of the Polish Publishers' Association. Around that time, Stachura also began a type of journal in which he collected various notes, many of which he would later incorporate into his works. Two books of poetry followed in 1968: \"Przystępuję do ciebie\" (\"I Come Close to You\") and \"Po ogrodzie niech hula szarańcza\" (\"Let the Locust Hold Sway in the Garden\"); the latter received the prestigious Stanisław Piętak Prize. In 1969 Stachura published his first novel, \"Cała jaskrawość\" (\"All the Brightness\"), work on the novel having begun three years earlier in the form of notes in Stachura's journal. The second novel, \"Siekierezada albo zima leśnych ludzi\" (\"Axing, or the Winter of the Forest Folk\"), followed in 1971, and it earned the author Stanisław Piętak Prize for the second time. Like the first novel, the book began with notes in the journal starting in 1967, and it was written partly in Mexico where Stachura studied in 1969 and 1970 on a twelve-month scholarship funded by the Mexican government.\nThe period during the writing and directly after the completion of the second novel was particularly difficult for Stachura. His marriage disintegrated, throwing him into fits of depression during which he contemplated suicide. After his return from Mexico, Stachura traveled much around Poland, often drinking heavily. In 1971, he visited the Middle East: Damascus and Beirut, and he returned to Poland via Rome and Prague. In January 1972, Stachura lost his \"adopted father,\" Rafał Urban: a writer and a storyteller; a fascinating, colorful character, twice his age, who died of cancer. In September, Stachura’s marriage was legally dissolved, and two months later his natural father died, also of cancer. Stanisław Stachura was a formidable character who over the years inspired in his son a wide range of emotions: admiration, fear, hostility, and—eventually—pity. Right after his father’s funeral, Stachura found himself in a hospital, a victim of an abnormally strong allergic reaction; while there, he wrote letters to all three siblings informing them of his intent to break off all contact with them—the symptom of a tendency that would soon become more pronounced.\n\nIn 1973 Stachura travelled to Norway, then to Geneva to receive The Kościelski Prize, and from there to France, to visit his birthplace in Charvieu. Next year he spent a few months in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. In 1975 Stachura published \"Wszystko jest poezja\" (\"Everything is Poetry\")—a collection of essays blending impressionistic commentary about everyday events in the author's life with philosophical reflections on the nature of the creative process and the relationship between life and literature. The book was followed by the publication of a long poem, \"Kropka nad ypsylonem\" (\"A Dot over Ypsilon\") in the literary monthly \"Twórczość\".\n\nIn the next few years Stachura showed a gradual deepening of distancing himself from events and people, and of his perception of aversion and hostility in the actions of friends and relatives. This transformation ultimately led to what is described by some as the mystical period in his life and writing, and by others as evidence of progressive mental illness. In 1977 he published \"Się\"—a collection of short stories employing a peculiar narrative technique (the title is a reflexive pronoun central to that technique), and suggesting, in the last selection, the elimination of corporeality. The book met with mixed reception. In 1978 Stachura published his last volume of poetry, \"Missa pagana\". The next book, \"Fabula rasa\", was to be his last. Published in 1979, the work continued the direction suggested two years earlier by \"Się\"—Stachura even insisted (unsuccessfully) on his name on the cover being replaced with the phrase \"No-man.\" The book led to extremely polarized critical reactions: they ranged from calling it a manifestation of the author’s mental breakdown (Ziemowit Fedecki) to praising it as one of the greatest works in the world literature (Andrzej Falkiewicz).\nRegardless of the assessment of Stachura’s final work, there is no doubt that he was afflicted during that time with mental disturbances. In April 1979 he suffered a mysterious train accident: he refused to step away from the railroad track along which he was walking, despite the fact that he saw an approaching train. He suffered concussion and lost most of his right hand. After a period of hospitalization in a psychiatric ward (which he requested), Stachura returned to his mother in Aleksandrów Kujawski. He taught himself to write with his left hand and described his experiences before, during, and after the accident in a deeply moving journal, later published under the title \"Pogodzić się ze światem\" (\"To Come to Terms with the World\"). He continued writing in the journal until just four days before his death. Stachura took his own life in his Warsaw apartment on 24 July 1979, leaving behind his final poem: \"List do pozostałych\" (\"A Letter to the Remaining\")\n\nThe poetry and life of Edward Stachura are central to the story of a Quebec man translating Stachura's poetry into French, in the 2012 Canadian feature film \"Tout ce que tu possèdes\" (\"All that you possess\"), by Bernard Émond. https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2458596/.

{"id": "235875", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=235875", "title": "Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals", "text": "Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals\n\nGroundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals (; 1785; also known as the \"Foundations of the Metaphysics of Morals\", \"Grounding of the Metaphysics of Morals\" and the \"Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals\") is the first of Immanuel Kant's mature works on moral philosophy and remains one of the most influential in the field. Kant conceives his investigation as a work of foundational ethics—one that clears the ground for future research by explaining the core concepts and principles of moral theory and showing that they are normative for rational agents. Kant aspires to nothing less than this: to lay bare the fundamental principle of morality and show that it applies to us. In the text, Kant provides a groundbreaking argument that the rightness of an action is determined by the character of the principle that a person chooses to act upon. Kant thus stands in stark contrast to the moral sense theories and teleological moral theories that dominated moral philosophy at the time he was writing. Central to the work is the role of what Kant refers to as the categorical imperative, the concept that one must act only according to that precept which he or she would will to become a universal law.\n\nThe \"Groundwork\" is broken into a preface, followed by three sections. Kant's argument works from common reason up to the supreme unconditional law, in order to identify its existence. He then works backwards from there to prove the relevance and weight of the moral law. The book is famously obscure, and it is partly because of this that Kant later, in 1788, decided to publish the \"Critique of Practical Reason\".\n\nIn the preface to the \"Groundwork\" Kant motivates the need for pure moral philosophy and makes some preliminary remarks to situate his project and explain his method of investigation. Kant opens the preface with an affirmation of the ancient Greek idea of a threefold division of philosophy into logic, physics, and ethics.\n\nLogic is purely formal—it deals only with the form of thought itself, not with any particular objects. Physics and ethics, on the other hand, deal with particular objects: physics is concerned with the laws of nature, ethics with the laws of freedom. Additionally, logic is an \"a priori\" discipline, \"i.e\"., logical truths do not depend on any particular experience for their justification. By contrast, physics and ethics are mixed disciplines, containing empirical and non-empirical parts. The empirical part of physics deals with contingently true phenomena, like what kind of physical entities there are and the relations in which they stand; the non-empirical part deals with fundamental concepts like space, time, and matter. Similarly, ethics contains an empirical part, which deals with the question of what—given the contingencies of human nature—tends to promote human welfare, and a non-empirical part, which is concerned with an \"a priori\" investigation into the nature and substance of morality. Because it is \"a priori\" Kant calls this latter, non-empirical part of ethics “metaphysics of morals.” It corresponds to the non-empirical part of physics, which Kant calls “metaphysics of nature.”\n\nKant proceeds to motivate the need for the special sort of inquiry he calls a metaphysics of morals: “That there must be such a philosophy is evident from the common idea of duty and of moral laws.” The moral law must “carry with it absolute necessity.” (4:389) The content and the bindingness of the moral law, in other words, do not vary according to the particularities of agents or their circumstances. Given that the moral law, if it exists, is universal and necessary, the only appropriate means to investigate it is through \"a priori\" rational reflection. Thus, a correct theoretical understanding of morality requires a metaphysics of morals. Kant thinks that until we have completed this sort of investigation, “morals themselves are liable to all kinds of corruption” because the “guide and supreme norm for correctly estimating them are missing.” A fully specified account of the moral law will guard against the errors and rationalization to which human moral reasoning is prone. (4:390) The search for the supreme principle of morality—the antidote to confusion in the moral sphere—will occupy Kant for the first two chapters of the \"Groundwork\".\n\nIn essence, Kant’s remarks in the preface prepare the reader for the thrust of the ideas he goes on to develop in the \"Groundwork. \"The purpose of the \"Groundwork\" is to prepare a foundation for moral theory. Because Kant believes that any fact which is grounded in empirical knowledge must be contingent, he can only derive the necessity that the moral law requires from \"a priori \"reasoning. It is with this significance of necessity in mind that the \"Groundwork\" attempts to establish a pure (\"a priori\") ethics. Such an ethics explains the possibility of a moral law and locates what Kant calls the “supreme principle of morality.” The aim of the following sections of the \"Groundwork\" is to explain what the moral law would have to be like if it existed and to show that, in fact, it exists and is authoritative for us.\n\nIn section one, Kant argues from common sense morality to the supreme principle of morality, which he calls the categorical imperative. Kant thinks that uncontroversial premises from our shared common sense morality, and analysis of common sense concepts such as ‘the good’, ‘duty’, and ‘moral worth’, will yield the supreme principle of morality, namely, the categorical imperative. Kant’s discussion in section one can be roughly divided into four parts: (1) The good will (2) The teleological argument. (3) The three propositions regarding duty and (4) The categorical imperative.\n\nKant thinks that, with the exception of the good will, all goods are qualified. By qualified, Kant means that those goods are good insofar as they presuppose or derive their goodness from something else. Take wealth as an example. Wealth can be extremely good if it is used for human welfare, but it can be disastrous if a corrupt mind is behind it. In a similar vein, we often desire intelligence and take it to be good, but we certainly would not take the intelligence of an evil genius to be good. The good will, by contrast, is good in itself. Kant writes, “A good will is not good because of what it effects or accomplishes, because of its fitness to attain some proposed end, but only because its volition, that is, it is good initself . . . .” (4:394) The precise nature of the good will is subject to scholarly debate.\n\nKant believes that a teleological argument may be given to demonstrate that the “true vocation of reason must be to produce a will that is good.” (4:396) As with other teleological arguments, such as the case with teleological arguments for the existence of God, Kant’s teleological argument is motivated by an appeal to a belief or sense that the whole universe or parts of it serve some greater telos, end or purpose. If nature’s creatures are so purposed, Kant thinks their capacity to reason would certainly not serve a purpose of self-preservation or achievement of happiness, which are better served by their natural inclinations. What guides the will in those matters is inclination. By the method of elimination, Kant argues that the capacity to reason must serve another purpose, namely, to produce good will, or, in Kant’s own words, to “produce a will that is . . . good in itself . . . .” Kant’s argument from teleology is widely taken to be problematic. The argument is based on the assumption that our faculties have distinct natural purposes for which they are most suitable, and it is questionable whether Kant can avail himself of this sort of argument.\n\nThe teleological argument, if flawed, still offers that critical distinction between a will guided by inclination and a will guided by reason. That will which is guided by reason, Kant will argue, is the will that acts from duty. Kant’s argument proceeds by way of three propositions, the last of which is derived from the first two.\n\nAlthough Kant never explicitly states what the first proposition is, it is clear that its content is suggested by the following common-sense observation. Common sense distinguishes among: (a) the case in which a person clearly acts contrary to duty; (b) the case in which a person’s actions coincide with duty, but are not motivated by duty; and (c) the case in which a person's actions coincide with duty because she is motivated by duty. Kant illustrates the distinction between (b) and (c) with the example of a shopkeeper (4:397) who chooses not to overcharge an inexperienced customer in order to preserve his business’s reputation. Because it is not motivated by duty, the shopkeeper's action has no moral worth. Kant contrasts the shopkeeper with the case of a person who, faced with “adversity and hopeless grief” (4:398) obeys his duty to preserve his life. Because this person acts from duty, his actions have moral worth. Kant thinks our actions only have moral worth and deserve esteem when they are motivated by duty.\n\nScholars disagree about the precise formulation of the first proposition. One interpretation asserts that the missing proposition is that an act has moral worth only when its agent is motivated by respect for the law, as in the case of the man who preserves his life only from duty. Another interpretation asserts that the proposition is that an act has moral worth only if the principle acted upon generates moral action non-contingently. If the shopkeeper in the above example had made his choice contingent upon what would serve the interests of his business, then his act has no moral worth.\n\nKant’s second proposition states that “an action from duty has its moral worth not in the purpose to be attained by it but in the maxim in accordance with which it is decided upon, and therefore does not depend upon the realization of the object of the action but merely upon the principle of volition in accordance with which the action is done without regard for any object of the faculty of desire” (4:400). A maxim of an action is its principle of volition. By this, Kant means that the moral worth of an act depends not on its consequences, intended or real, but on the principle acted upon.\n\nKant combines these two propositions into a third proposition, a complete statement of our common sense notions of duty. This proposition is that ‘duty is necessity of action from respect for law.’ (4:400) This final proposition serves as the basis of Kant’s argument for the supreme principle of morality, the categorical imperative.\n\nKant thinks that all of our actions, whether motivated by inclination or morality, must follow some law. For example, if a person wants to qualify for nationals in ultimate frisbee, he will have to follow a law that tells him to practice his backhand pass, among other things. Notice, however, that this law is only binding on the person who wants to qualify for nationals in ultimate frisbee. In this way, it is contingent upon the ends that he sets and the circumstances that he is in. We know from the third proposition, however, that the moral law must bind universally and necessarily, that is, regardless of ends and circumstances. At this point, Kant asks, ‘what kind of law can that be, the representation of which must determine the will, even without regard for the effect expected from it...?’ (4:402) He concludes that the only remaining alternative is a law that reflects only the form of law itself, namely that of universality. Thus, Kant arrives at his well-known categorical imperative, the moral law referenced in the above discussion of duty. Kant defines the categorical imperative as the following: “I ought never to act except in such a way that I could also will that my maxim should become a universal law.” (4:402)\n\nIn Section II, Kant starts from scratch and attempts to move from popular moral philosophy to a metaphysics of morals. Kant begins Section II of the \"Groundwork\" by criticizing attempts to begin moral evaluation with empirical observation. He states that even when we take ourselves to be behaving morally, we cannot be at all certain that we are purely motivated by duty and not by inclinations. Kant observes that humans are quite good at deceiving themselves when it comes to evaluating their motivations for acting, and therefore even in circumstances where individuals believe themselves to be acting from duty, it is possible they are acting merely in accordance with duty and are motivated by some contingent desire. However, the fact that we see ourselves as often falling short of what morality demands of us indicates we have some functional concept of the moral law.\n\nKant begins his new argument in Section II with some observations about rational willing. All things in nature must act according to laws, but only rational beings act in accordance with the representation of a law. In other words, only rational beings have the capacity to recognize and consult laws and principles in order to guide their actions. Thus, only rational creatures have practical reason. The laws and principles that rational agents consult yield imperatives, or rules that necessitate the will. For example, if a person wants to qualify for nationals in ultimate frisbee, he will recognize and consult the rules that tell him how to achieve this goal. These rules will provide him with imperatives that he must follow as long as he wants to qualify for nationals.\n\nImperatives are either hypothetical or categorical. Hypothetical imperatives provide the rules an agent must follow when she adopts a contingent end (an end based on desire or inclination). So, for example, if I want ice cream, I should go to the ice cream shop or make myself some ice cream. But notice that this imperative only applies if I want ice cream. If I have no interest in ice cream, the imperative does not apply to me. Kant thinks that there are two types of hypothetical imperative—rules of skill and counsels of prudence. Rules of skill are determined by the particular ends we set and tell us what is necessary to achieve those particular ends. However, Kant observes that there is one end that we all share, namely our own happiness. Unfortunately, it is difficult, if not impossible, to know what will make us happy or how to achieve the things that will make us happy. Therefore, Kant argues, we can at best have counsels of prudence, as opposed to outright rules.\n\nRecall that the moral law, if it exists, must apply universally and necessarily. Therefore, a moral law could never rest on hypothetical imperatives, which only apply if one adopts some particular end. Rather, the imperative associated with the moral law must be a categorical imperative. The categorical imperative holds for all rational agents, regardless of whatever varying ends a person may have. If we could find it, the categorical imperative would provide us with the moral law. What would the categorical imperative look like? We know that it could never be based on the particular ends that people adopt to give themselves rules of action. Kant thinks that this leaves us with one remaining alternative, namely that the categorical imperative must be based on the notion of a law itself. Laws (or \"commands\"), by definition, apply universally. From this observation, Kant derives the categorical imperative, which requires that moral agents act only in a way that the principle of their will could become a universal law. (4:421) The categorical imperative is a test of proposed maxims; it does not generate a list of duties on its own. The categorical imperative is Kant’s general statement of the supreme principle of morality, but Kant goes on to provide three different formulations of this general statement.\n\nThe first formulation states that an action is only morally permissible if every agent could adopt the same principle of action without generating one of two kinds of contradiction. This formula is called the Formula for the Universal Law of Nature. It states that one should, “act as if the maxim of your action were to become by your will a universal law of nature.” (4:421)\n\nA proposed maxim can fail to meet the above requirement in one of two ways. First, one might encounter a scenario in which one’s proposed maxim would become impossible in a world in which it is universalized. For example, suppose a person in need of money makes it her maxim to attain a loan by making a false promise to pay it back. If everyone followed this principle, nobody would trust another person when she made a promise, and the institution of promise-making would be destroyed. But, the maxim of making a false promise in order to attain a loan relies on the very institution of promise-making that universalizing this maxim destroys. Kant calls this type of contradiction a ‘contradiction in conception’ because it is impossible to conceive of the maxim being universalized. (4:424)\n\nSecond, a maxim might fail by generating what Kant calls a ‘contradiction in willing’. (4:424) This sort of contradiction comes about when the universalized maxim contradicts something that rational agents necessarily will. For example, a person might have a maxim never to help others when they are in need. However, Kant thinks that all agents necessarily wish for the help of others from time to time. Therefore, it is impossible for the agent to will that her maxim be universally adopted. If an attempt to universalize a maxim results in a contradiction in conception, it violates what Kant calls a perfect duty. If it results in a contradiction in willing, it violates what Kant calls an imperfect duty. Perfect duties are negative duties, that is duties not to commit or engage in certain actions or activities (for example theft). Imperfect duties are positive duties, duties to commit or engage in certain actions or activities (for example, giving to charity). In the \"Groundwork\", Kant says that perfect duties never admit of exception for the sake of inclination (4:421n), which is sometimes taken to imply that imperfect duties \"do\" admit of exception for the sake of inclination. However, in a later work (\"The Metaphysics of Morals)\", Kant suggests that imperfect duties only allow for flexibility in how one chooses to fulfill them. Kant thinks that we have perfect and imperfect duties both to ourselves and to others.\n\nThe second formulation of the categorical imperative is the Formula of Humanity, which Kant arrives at by considering the motivating ground of the categorical imperative. Because the moral law is necessary and universal, its motivating ground must have absolute worth (4:428). Were we to find something with such absolute worth, an end in itself, that would be the only possible ground of a categorical imperative. Kant asserts that, “a human being and generally every rational being exists as an end in itself.” (4:428) The corresponding imperative, the Formula of Humanity, commands that “you use humanity, whether in your own persona or in the person of any other, always at the same time as an end, never merely as a means.” (4:429) When we treat others merely as means to our discretionary ends, we violate a perfect duty. However, Kant thinks that we also have an imperfect duty to advance the end of humanity. For example, making a false promise to another person in order to achieve the end of getting some money treats their rational nature as a mere means to one’s selfish end. This is, therefore, a violation of a perfect duty. By contrast, it is possible to fail to donate to charity without treating some other person as a mere means to an end, but in doing so we fail to advance the end of humanity, thereby violating an imperfect duty.\nThe Formula of Autonomy takes something important from both the Formula for the Universal Law of Nature and the Formula of Humanity. The Formula for the Universal Law of Nature involves thinking about your maxim as if it were an objective law, while the Formula of Humanity is more subjective and is concerned with how you are treating the person with whom you are interacting. The Formula of Autonomy combines the objectivity of the former with the subjectivity of the latter and suggests that the agent ask what she would accept as a universal law. To do this, she would test her maxims against the moral law that she has legislated. The Principle of Autonomy is, “the principle of every human will as a will universally legislating through all its maxims.” (4:432) Kant thinks that the Formula of Autonomy yields another “fruitful concept,” the kingdom of ends. The kingdom of ends is the “systematic union” of all ends in themselves (rational agents) and the ends that they set. All ends that rational agents set have a price and can be exchanged for one another. Ends in themselves, however, have dignity and have no equivalent. In addition to being the basis for the Formula of Autonomy and the kingdom of ends, autonomy itself plays an important role in Kant’s moral philosophy. Autonomy is the capacity to be the legislator of the moral law, in other words, to give the moral law to oneself. Autonomy is opposed to heteronomy, which consists of having one’s will determined by forces alien to it. Because alien forces could only determine our actions contingently, Kant believes that autonomy is the only basis for a non-contingent moral law. It is in failing to see this distinction that Kant believes his predecessors have failed: their theories have all been heteronomous. At this point Kant has given us a picture of what a universal and necessary law would look like should it exist. However, he has yet to prove that it does exist, or, in other words, that it applies to us. That is the task of Section III.\n\nIn section three, Kant argues that we have a free will and are thus morally self-legislating. The fact of freedom means that we are bound by the moral law. In the course of his discussion, Kant establishes two viewpoints from which we can consider ourselves. We can view ourselves as members of the world of appearances – which operates according to the laws of nature – or we can view ourselves as members of the intellectual world, which is how we view ourselves when we think of ourselves as having free wills and when we think about how to act. These two different viewpoints allow Kant to make sense of how we can have free wills, despite the fact that the world of appearances follows laws of nature deterministically. Finally, Kant remarks that whilst he would like to be able to explain how morality ends up motivating us, his theory is unable to do so. This is because the intellectual world - in which morality is grounded - is something that we cannot make positive claims about.\n\nKant opens section III by defining the will as the cause of our actions. According to Kant, having a will is the same thing as being rational, and having a free will means having a will that is not influenced by external forces. This is a negative definition of freedom – it tells us that freedom is freedom from determination by alien forces. But Kant also provides a positive definition of freedom: a free will, Kant argues, gives itself a law- it sets its own ends, and has a special causal power to bring them about. A free will is one that has the power to bring about its own actions in a way that is distinct from the way that normal laws of nature cause things to happen. According to Kant, we need laws to be able to act. An action not based on some sort of law would be arbitrary and not the sort of thing that we could call the result of willing. Because a free will is not merely pushed around by external forces, external forces do not provide laws for a free will. The only source of law for a free will is that will itself. This is Kant's notion of autonomy. Thus, Kant's notion of freedom of the will requires that we are morally self legislating, that we impose the moral law on ourselves. Kant thinks that the positive understanding of freedom amounts to the same thing as the categorical imperative, and that “a free will and a will under moral laws are one and the same”. This is the key notion that later scholars call the reciprocity thesis. The reciprocity thesis states that a will is bound by the moral law if and only if it is free. That means that if you know that someone is free, then you know that the moral law applies to them, and vice versa.\n\nKant then asks why we have to follow the principle of morality. Although we all may feel the force of our consciences, Kant, examining phenomena with a philosophical eye, is forced to “admit that no interest impels me to do so”. He says that we clearly do “regard ourselves as free in acting and so to hold ourselves yet subject to certain laws” but wonders how this is possible. He then explains just how it is possible, by appealing to the two perspectives that we can consider ourselves under. According to Kant, human beings cannot know the ultimate structure of reality. Whilst humans experience the world as having three spatial dimensions and as being extended in time, we cannot say anything about how reality ultimately is, from a god's-eye perspective. From this god's-eye perspective the world may be nothing like the way it appears to human beings. We cannot get out of our heads and leave our human perspective on the world to know what it is like independently of our own viewpoint; we can only know about how the world appears to us, not about how the world is in itself. Kant calls the world as it appears to us from our point of view the world of sense or of appearances. The world from a god's-eye perspective is the world of things in themselves or the “world of understanding”. It is the distinction between these two perspectives that Kant appeals to in explaining how freedom is possible. Insofar as we take ourselves to be exercising our free will, Kant argues, we have to consider ourselves from the perspective of the world of understanding. It is only in the world of understanding that it makes sense to talk of free wills. In the world of appearances, everything is determined by physical laws, and there is no room for a free will to change the course of events. If you consider yourself as part of the world of appearances, then you cannot think of yourself as having a will that brings things about.\n\nAccording to Kant, the categorical imperative is possible because whilst we can be thought of as members of both of these worlds (understanding and appearance), it is the world of understanding that “contains the ground of the world of sense [appearance] and so too of its laws.” What this means is that the world of understanding is more fundamental than or ‘grounds’ the world of sense. Because of this, the moral law, which clearly applies to the world of understanding, also applies to the world of sense as well, because the world of understanding has priority. To put the point slightly differently: Because the world of understanding is more fundamental and primary, its laws hold for the world of sense too. So the moral law binds us even in the world of appearances.\n\nAccording to Kant, we think of ourselves as having free will. This lets us make judgments such as “you ought to have done that thing that you did not do.” Kant argues that this notion of freedom cannot be derived from our experience. We can be sure that this concept of freedom doesn't come from experience because experience itself contradicts it. Our experience is of everything in the sensible world and in the sensible world, everything that happens does so in accord with the laws of nature and there is no room for a free will to influence events.\n\nSo, Kant argues, we are committed to two incompatible positions. From the perspective of practical reason, which is involved when we consider how to act, we have to take ourselves as free. But from the perspective of speculative reason, which is concerned with investigating the nature of the world of appearance, freedom is impossible. So we are committed to freedom on the one hand, and yet on the other hand we are also committed to a world of appearances that is run by laws of nature and has no room for freedom. We cannot give up on either. We cannot avoid taking ourselves as free when we act, and we cannot give up our picture of the world as determined by laws of nature. As Kant puts it, there is a contradiction between freedom and natural necessity. He calls this a dialectic of reason.\n\nThe way Kant suggests that we should deal with this dialectic is through an appeal to the two perspectives we can take on ourselves. This is the same sort of move he made earlier in this section. On one perspective, the perspective of the world of understanding, we are free, whereas from the other, the perspective of the world of the senses or appearances, natural laws determine everything that happens. There is no contradiction because the claim to freedom applies to one world, and the claim of the laws of nature determining everything applies to the other. The claims do not conflict because they have different targets.\n\nKant cautions that we cannot feel or intuit this world of the understanding. He also stresses that we are unable to make interesting positive claims about it because we are not able to experience the world of the understanding. Kant argues that we cannot use the notion of the world of the understanding to explain how freedom is possible or how pure reason could have anything to say about practical matters because we simply do not and cannot have a clear enough grasp of the world of the understanding. The notion of an intelligible world does point us towards the idea of a kingdom of ends, which is a useful and important idea. We just have to be careful not to get carried away and make claims that we are not entitled to.\n\nIn his book \"On the Basis of Morality\" (1840), Arthur Schopenhauer presents a careful analysis of the \"Groundwork\". His criticism is an attempt to prove, among other things, that actions are not moral when they are performed solely from duty. Schopenhauer called Kant's ethical philosophy the weakest point in Kant's philosophical system and specifically targeted the Categorical Imperative, labeling it cold and egoistic. While he publicly called himself a Kantian, and made clear and bold criticisms of Hegelian philosophy, he was quick and unrelenting in his analysis of the inconsistencies throughout Kant's long body of work. Schopenhauer's biggest admirer Friedrich Nietzsche also criticizes the Categorical Imperative.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "41094433", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41094433", "title": "Inner Relationship Focusing", "text": "Inner Relationship Focusing\n\nInner Relationship Focusing is a psychotherapeutic system and process developed by Ann Weiser Cornell and Barbara McGavin, as a refinement and expansion of the Focusing process discovered and developed by Eugene Gendlin in the late 1960s. Inner Relationship Focusing is a process for emotional healing, and for accessing positive energy and insights for forward movement in one's life. \n\nCornell, while a graduate student in Linguistics at the University of Chicago, met Gendlin in 1972 and learned his technique. In 1980 she began collaborating with him in teaching his Focusing workshops. Using her capacity for linguistics, Cornell helped develop the concept of Focusing guiding, and in the early 1980s she offered the first seminars on Focusing guiding. Her continuation of this process led to her development, with Barbara McGavin, of Inner Relationship Focusing.\n\nInner Relationship Focusing took shape when Ann Weiser Cornell moved from Chicago to California in 1983 and began teaching Focusing to people who knew nothing about it. She discovered that many people who were not automatically adept at it needed new techniques and new language to draw out their ability to learn the process. Eventually her discoveries of what worked best for the majority of people, combined with the input, inspiration, and insights of her British collaborator Barbara McGavin, evolved into Inner Relationship Focusing in the 1990s. Cornell incorporated her new techniques and insights into her first books, \"The Focusing Student's Manual\" (1993) and \"The Focusing Guide's Manual\" (1994) – both later revised with Barbara McGavin and published in 2002 as \"The Focusing Student's and Companion's Manual\" – and in all of her subsequent books, which have become classic textbooks on Focusing.\n\nInner Relationship Focusing is a refined and expanded form of Eugene Gendlin's original six-step process of Focusing, which he had detailed in his 1978 book of the same title. Inner Relationship Focusing emphasizes being in gentle, allowing relationship with all parts of one's being, including parts that are in conflict, parts often denied or pushed away as unacceptable or demeaning, parts that are overwhelming, and parts that are so buried or subtle they need to be drawn out with patience and gentleness. In allowing all aspects of the personality to be held in acceptance and awareness, new insights and shifts can emerge and healing can occur. Inner Relationship Focusing therefore emphasizes the relationship of the Self with the various inner aspects, however painful, and it relies specifically on a quality of Presence, or the ability of the Self to be present with these aspects in a quality of friendliness, gentle curiosity, and nonjudgment. A major feature of IRF is gently finding out how a specific aspect or felt experience feels \"from its point of view\". Another feature is giving awareness to parts of oneself that are opposing – either afraid of or objecting to – a difficult or troublesome part. Inner Relationship Focusing radically allows and accepts all parts or inner experiences. It also avoids the extremes of denial/\"exile\" and merging/identification/overwhelm, through using the quality of Presence to gently experience and navigate one's inner world in a calm, detached, but gently curious and inviting way.\n\nEugene Gendlin's original Focusing process, described in his 1978 book, is a process that he generalizes as having six steps: clearing a space, allowing a \"felt sense\" to form, finding a handle, resonating, asking, and receiving. Inner Relationship Focusing, developed in the late 1980s through the late 1990s, is a more fluid process, and eschews or modifies certain aspects of Gendlin's. For instance, rather than clearing a space, IRF uses a mental scan of the body for what feels open and alive, and what needs acknowledging – without moving any issue \"out\" – in order to more fully accept or find what may be wanting attention.\n\nRather than \"asking\", the Focuser uses the quality of Presence to \"allow\" what wants to be expressed – hidden feelings, thoughts, and incipient information – to come forth. The guide, if used, gives gentle suggestions rather than asking questions in order not to intrude on the process or deflect attention away from the inner experience. This stage, which includes the stage called \"resonating\" in Gendlin's format, is an important and lengthy one in IRF, and includes settling down with \"it\" (the felt experience or the partial self), keeping it company, and sensing its point of view, including what it wants and what it does not want.\n\nAn important principle in Inner Relationship Focusing is not denying or exiling any thoughts, feelings, or partial selves – not even the inner critic – but rather empathizing with all parts and aspects and sensing what they want to communicate and why. Cornell calls this \"the radical acceptance of everything\". Another central principle is the aspect of Presence, or \"Self-in-Presence\": gentle listening, with equanimity, to everything that comes up in the Focusing process. In addition, specific language and language/thought patterns are encouraged, which Cornell calls \"Presence language\", in order to facilitate this process. And as indicated by its name, Inner Relationship Focusing gives high priority to the relationship of the Focuser to his inwardly felt experience or aspects of his inner life. The role of the guide, if one is used, is to support this relationship.\n\nSince the early 1990s Cornell has taught Inner Relationship Focusing throughout the U.S. at venues including Esalen, the National Institute for the Clinical Application of Behavioral Medicine, and the American Psychological Association, and also around the world. Inner Relationship Focusing is now used and taught all over the world, including in Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n\nPsychologist and self-help author Helene Brenner calls Inner Relationship Focusing \"one of the most powerful techniques I know for emotional healing\". CC Leigh, whose Inseeing Process of self-healing and spiritual growth is largely based on IRF, calls Inner Relationship Focusing a \"highly refined technology for getting in touch with the inner dynamics that typically lie beneath the threshold of awareness, and befriending them from a state of Presence so they can open up and organically evolve\". Inner Relationship Focusing has been recommended in several 21st-century psychology textbooks, stress-reduction manuals, and other self-improvement texts, and it is the commonest adaptation of the Focusing form used today.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "52409583", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52409583", "title": "Jaina seven-valued logic", "text": "Jaina seven-valued logic\n\nJaina seven-valued logic is system of argumentation developed by Jaina philosophers and thinkers to support and substantiate their theory of pluralism. This argumentation system has seven distinct semantic predicates which may be thought of as seven different truth values. Traditionally, in the Jaina and other Indian literature dealing with topics in Jain philosophy, this system of argumentation is referred to as \"Saptabhangivada\" or \"Syadvada\". The earliest reference to \"Syadvada\" occurs is the writings of Bhadrabahu (c. 433–357 BCE). There is mention of \"Syadvada\" in the \"Nyayavatara\" of Siddhasens Divakara (about 480–550 CE). Samantabhadra (about 600 CE) gave a full exposition of the seven parts of \"Syadvada\" or \"Saptabhanginyaya\" in his \"Aptamimamsa\". The \"Syadvadamanjari\" of Mallisena (1292 CE) is a separate treatise on the same theory. There are, of course, still later works and a large number of modern commentaries. The interpretation of Saptabhangivada as a seven-valued logic was attempted by Harvard University philosophy professor George Bosworth Burch (1902–1973) in a paper published in International Philosophical Quarterly in the year 1964. P. C. Mahalanobis, an Indian applied statistician, has given a probabilistic interpretation of the \"Saptabhangivada\".\n\nThe \"Saptabhangivada\", the seven predicate theory may be summarized as follows:\n\nThe seven predicate theory consists in the use of seven claims about sentences, each preceded by \"arguably\" or \"conditionally\" (syat), concerning a single object and its particular properties, composed of assertions and denials, either simultaneously or successively, and without contradiction. These seven claims are the following.\n\n\nThere are three basic truth values, namely, true (t), false (f) and unassertible (u). These are combined to produce four more truth values, namely, tf, tu, fu, and tfu. Though, superficially, it appears that there are only three distinct truth values a deeper analysis of the Jaina system reveals that the seven truth values are indeed distinct. This is a consequence of the conditionalising operator \"arguably\" denoted in Sanskrit by the word \"syat\". This Sanskrit word has the literal meaning of \"perhaps it is\", and it is used to mean \"from a certain standpoint\" or \"within a particular philosophical perspective\".\n\nIn this discussion the term \"standpoint\" has been used in a technical sense. Consider a situation in which a globally inconsistent set of propositions, the totality of philosophical discourse, is divided into sub-sets, each of which is internally consistent. Any proposition might be supported by others from within the same sub-set. At the same time, the negation of that proposition might occur in a distinct, though possibly overlapping subset, and be supported by other propositions within it. Each such consistent sub-set of a globally inconsistent discourse, is what the Jainas call a \"standpoint\" (naya). A standpoint corresponds to a particular philosophical perspective.\n\nIn this terminology, it can be seen that the seven predicates get translated to the following seven possibilities. Each proposition \"p\" has the following seven states:\n\n\n"}

Crow\n\nJames Franklin Crow (January 18, 1916 – January 4, 2012) was Professor Emeritus of Genetics at the University of Wisconsin–Madison and a prominent population geneticist whose career spanned from the modern synthesis to the genomic era.\n\nSome of his most significant peer-reviewed contributions were coauthored with Motoo Kimura, including those leading to the neutral theory of molecular evolution. He also wrote an influential introductory textbook on genetics and a more advanced one with Kimura. His graduate and undergraduate students and postdocs includes Alexey Kondrashov, James Bull, Joe Felsenstein, Russell Lande, Dan Hartl, and Wen-Hsiung Li.\n\nHe was a president of both the Genetics Society of America and the American Society of Human Genetics. He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences, The American Philosophical Society, the World Academy of Art and Science, the National Academy of Medicine, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS).\n\nCrow was born in 1916 in Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, where his father was a teacher at Ursinus College. The family moved to Wichita, Kansas, two and a half years later, in 1918, where Crow was part of the 1918 flu pandemic. He went to school in Wichita, then to Friends University, at the time a Quaker school, also in Wichita, graduating in 1937.\n\nAt school, he enjoyed physics and chemistry, but pursued chemistry more strongly at university. He picked up biology as well, and double majored in chemistry and biology. A genetics course in his junior year was his first exposure to that field, even though the syllabus omitted the modern synthesis.\n\nDelaying the decision of whether to become a biologist or chemist, Crow applied for graduate fellowships in both biology and biochemistry. He took up the first positive reply, a position with H. J. Muller at the University of Texas at Austin, in spite of knowing that Muller was in Russia at the time. It turned out that Muller had no intention of returning to his position in Texas, and so J. T. Patterson became Crow's supervisor there. Under the influence of Muller, Patterson was starting to switch to \"Drosophila\" genetics, having previously worked on the embryology of the armadillo, and so it was that Crow came to study the genetic isolating mechanisms in the \"Drosophila mulleri\" group. This included a combination of doing mating crosses between species and looking for chromosome rearrangements using polytene chromosomes. (Polytene chromosomes are large aggregations of actual chromosomes which, once appropriately stained, facilitate the discovery of chromosome rearrangements through an ordinary light microscope. Polytene chromosomes are mostly found in the salivary glands of some species.) In his studies of pre-mating isolation, Crow was one of the first to study genetic reinforcement, and also observed that species occurring together were sexually isolated, while those living apart were not.\n\nA great influence on Crow at the time was W.S. Stone, who encouraged him to learn more mathematics, while he himself knew none. Later on, Crow admitted to struggling with some of the advanced maths and physics courses he took as a result, but also said they had been rewarding.\n\nCrow graduated with his PhD in 1941 and moved to Dartmouth College just prior to the American entry into World War II, where he remained until 1948. The original plan had been to get a postdoctoral fellowship to work with Sewall Wright at the University of Chicago, but this proved difficult just at the start of the war.\n\nHis appointment in Dartmouth was to teach genetics and general zoology, but as faculty were drafted off into military endeavors, Crow took on an increasing number of courses. Crow particularly delighted in being able to teach embryology and comparative anatomy. When it seemed likely that he himself would be drafted, Crow took a course in navigation, at which, owing to his mathematical training, he proved so adept that he was asked to teach it. As parasitology became relevant to the war (as it did on the opposing front, where Willi Hennig was active in this area), he was asked to also teach parasitology and haematology. Not long after, he was also teaching statistics. It may be that, having to teach many hours each day, Crow discovered his love for teaching at this point. He later recounted that there were several students all of whose courses were taught by him.\n\nHe, like many of his colleagues of the era, had college-time involvement with pacifist groups that had communist leanings. During WWII, he tried to enlist, but was deferred until the end due to his teaching commitments.\n\nCrow wrote \"Genetic Theories and Influences: Comments on the Value of Diversity,\" an article in the \"Harvard Educational Review\" reprinted in the review's reprint series responding to Arthur Jensen's 1969 article, \"How Much Can We Boost IQ and Academic Achievement?\"\n\nCrow also did research and writing in how DNA in sperm degrades as men age, through repeated copying, and can then be passed along to children in permanently degraded form, which they likely then pass on as well. As a result, he said in 1997 that the \"greatest mutational health hazard to the human genome is fertile older males\". He described mutations that have a direct visible effect on the child's health and also mutations that can be latent or have minor visible effects on the child's health; many such mutations allow the child to reproduce, but cause more serious problems for grandchildren, great-grandchildren and later generations However, evidence to support Crow's \"greatest mutational health hazard\" claim appears to be weak; a 2009 review concludes that the absolute risk from paternal age for genetic anomalies in offspring is low, and states that \"there is no clear association between adverse health outcome and paternal age but longitudinal studies are needed.\"\n\nMuch of Crow’s research was in the area of theoretical population genetics, but he has often ventured into the laboratory. Over a career that spanned more than 50 years, Crow and his collaborators studied a variety of traits in Drosophila, dissected the genetics of DDT resistance, measured the effects of minor mutations on the overall fitness of populations, described the behavior of mutations that do not play the selection game by Darwin’s rules, and investigated many other subjects. His theoretical work has touched virtually every important subject in population genetics. Crow developed the concept of genetic load, has contributed to the theory of random drift in small populations, has studied the effects of non-random mating and age-structured populations, and has considered the question, “What good is sex?” He also developed ways to estimate inbreeding in human populations by making use of the way in which surnames are “inherited,” and was a world expert on the genetic effects of low level ionizing radiation. In addition to his many research publications, Crow published many reviews and appreciations of the work of his colleagues. His textbook/monograph on population genetics, written with Motoo Kimura, has had a notable impact on its field.\n\nCrow chaired the Department of Medical Genetics for five years and the Laboratory of Genetics (Genetics plus Medical Genetics) for a total of eight years. He also served as Acting Dean of the UW Medical School for 2 years. He was President of the Genetics Society of America and the American Society of Human Genetics. He was the co-editor-in-chief of the journal \"GENETICS\" and edited its perspectives section from 1987 until 2008. Crow served at the national level as a member of the General Advisory Committee to the Director of NIH and of the executive council of the National Committee on Radiation Protection, chaired the NIH Genetics Study Section and the NIH Mammalian Genetics Study Section, and chaired several committees for the National Academy of Sciences including a committee to study forensic uses of DNA fingerprinting.\n\nIn addition, Crow for many years played viola for the Madison Symphony Orchestra and served as President of the Madison Civic Music Society and of the Madison Symphony Orchestra. He led a fund-raising drive to establish an endowment for the Pro Arte String Quartet.\n\nCrow was a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Medicine, The American Philosophical Society, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the World Academy of Art and Science. He was an honorary Fellow of the Japan Academy and a Fellow of the Wisconsin Academy of Sciences, Arts, and Letters. He died of congestive heart failure in 2012.\n\nCrow was married to Ann Crockett. They are survived by a son, the computer scientist Franklin C. Crow; two daughters, Laura and Catherine; six grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. He was an atheist and an opponent of the intelligent design movement.\n\nJames F. Crow died on January 4, 2012 at age 95 from congestive heart failure at his home in Madison, Wisconsin.\n\n"}

{"id": "791733", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=791733", "title": "Johannine Comma", "text": "Johannine Comma\n\nThe Johannine Comma () is an interpolated phrase in the First Epistle of John . It became a touchpoint for Protestant and Roman Catholic debates over the doctrine of the Trinity in the early modern period.\n\nThe passage first appeared as an addition to the Vulgate, the Latin translation of the Bible, and entered the Greek manuscript tradition in the 15th century. It does not appear in the oldest Latin manuscripts, and appears to have originated as a gloss around the end of the 4th century. Some scribes gradually incorporated this annotation into the main text over the course of the Middle Ages.\n\nThe first Greek manuscript of the New Testament that contains the comma dates from the 15th century. The comma is absent from the Ethiopic, Aramaic, Syriac, Slavic, Armenian, Georgian, and Arabic translations of the Greek New Testament. It appears in some English translations of the Bible via its inclusion in the first printed edition of the New Testament, Erasmus's \"Nouum instrumentum omne\", who added it to his text in 1522.\n\nErasmus first added the Greek version of the text to his \"Nouum instrumentum omne\" in 1522; the first two editions lack the phrase. Many subsequent early printed editions of the Bible include it, including the Coverdale Bible (1535) and the King James Bible revised from it (1611); the Geneva Bible (1560); and the Douay–Rheims Bible (1610). It was not always included in the first printed Latin editions of the Bible, but the editors of the Sixto-Clementine Vulgate (1592) chose to print it along with a number of other spurious passages.\n\nThe text (\"in italics\") reads:\n\nThere are several variant versions of the Latin and Greek texts, reflecting their later addition.\n\nAfter the extent of the comma's absence from biblical manuscripts became known, translations made after the eighteenth century omitted the phrase. English translations based on a modern critical text have omitted it since the English Revised Version (1881), including the New International Version (NIV), New American Standard Bible (NASB), English Standard Version (ESV), and New Revised Standard Version. In the Roman Catholic tradition, the official \"Nova Vulgata\" (1979) omits the comma, as does the New American Bible (1970).\n\nSeveral early sources which one might expect to include the Comma Johanneum in fact omit it. For example, although Clement of Alexandria (c. 200) places a strong emphasis on the Trinity, his quotation of does not include the Comma. Tertullian, in his \"Against Praxeas\" (c. 210), supports a Trinitarian view by quoting . Jerome's writings of the fourth century give no evidence that he was aware of the Comma's existence. (The Codex Fuldensis, a copy of the Vulgate made around 546, contains a copy of Jerome's \"Prologue to the Canonical Gospels\" which seems to reference the Comma, but the Codex's version of 1 John omits it, which has led many to believe that the \"Prologue\"<nowiki>'s</nowiki> reference is spurious.)\n\nThe earliest reference to what might be the Comma appears by the 3rd-century Church father Cyprian (died 258), who in Treatise I section 6 quoted John 10:30 against heretics who denied the Trinity and added: \"Again it is written of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, 'And these three are one.'\" Daniel B. Wallace notes that although Cyprian uses 1 John to argue for the Trinity, he appeals to this as an allusion via the three witnesses—\"written of\"—rather than by quoting a proof-text—\"written that\". In noting this, Wallace is following the current standard critical editions of the New Testament (NA27 and UBS4) which consider Cyprian a witness \"against\" the Comma. They would not do this were they to think him to have quoted it. So even though some still think that Cyprian referred to the passage, the fact that other theologians such as Athanasius of Alexandria and Sabellius and Origen never quoted or referred to that passage is one reason why even many Trinitarians later on also considered the text spurious, and not to have been part of the original text.\n\nThe first work to quote the Comma Johanneum as an actual part of the Epistle's text appears to be the 4th century Latin homily \"Liber Apologeticus,\" probably written by Priscillian of Ávila (died 385), or his close follower Bishop Instantius.\n\nThis part of the homily apparently then became worked into copies of the Latin Vulgate roughly around the year 800. It was subsequently back-translated into the Greek, but only eight of the thousands of Greek New Testament manuscripts currently extant contain it. The oldest known occurrence appears to be a later addition to a 10th century manuscript now in the Bodleian Library, the exact date of the addition not known; in this manuscript, the Comma is a variant reading offered as an alternative to the main text. The other seven sources date to the sixteenth century or later, and four of the seven are hand-written in the manuscript margins. In one manuscript, back-translated into Greek from the Vulgate, the phrase \"and these three are one\" is not present.\n\nNo Syriac manuscripts include the Comma, and its presence in some printed Syriac Bibles is due to back-translation from the Latin Vulgate. Coptic manuscripts and those from Ethiopian churches also do not include it. Of the surviving \"Itala\" or \"Old Latin\" translations, only two support the Textus Receptus reading, namely the Codex Monacensis (6th or 7th century) and the Speculum, an 8th- or 9th-century collection of New Testament quotations.\n\nIn the 6th century, Fulgentius of Ruspe is quoted as a witness in favour of the Comma. Like Cyprian a father of the North African Church, he referred to Cyprian's remark in his \"Responsio contra Arianos\" (\"Reply against the Arians\"), as do many other African fathers (the Arian heresy, which denied the Trinity, was particularly strong in North Africa); but the most notable and prolific writer of the African Church, Augustine of Hippo, is completely silent on the matter. \n\nThe comma is not in the two oldest Vulgate manuscripts, Codex Fuldensis and the Codex Amiatinus, although it is referenced in the Prologue of Fuldensis. Overall, it is estimated that over 95% of the thousands of Vulgate manuscripts contain the verse. The Vulgate text of the Epistles of John was developed from Vetus Latina manuscripts, revised by an unknown scholar to conform better with the Greek.\n\nThe earliest extant Latin manuscripts supporting the comma are dated from the 5th to 7th century. The Freisinger fragment and the Codex Legionensis (7th century), besides the younger Codex Speculum, New Testament quotations extant in an 8th- or 9th-century manuscript.\n\nThe comma does not appear in the older Greek manuscripts. Nestle-Aland is aware of eight Greek manuscripts that contain the comma. The date of the addition is late, probably dating to the time of Erasmus. In one manuscript, back-translated into Greek from the Vulgate, the phrase \"and these three are one\" is not present.\n\nBoth \"Novum Testamentum Graece\" (NA27) and the United Bible Societies (UBS4) provide three variants. The numbers here follow UBS4, which rates its preference for the first variant as { A }, meaning \"virtually certain\" to reflect the original text. The second variant is a longer Greek version found in only four manuscripts, the margins of three others and in some minority variant readings of lectionaries. All of the hundreds of other Greek manuscripts that contain 1 John support the first variant. The third variant is found only in Latin, in one class of Vulgate manuscripts and three patristic works. The other two Vulgate traditions omit the phrase, as do more than a dozen major Church Fathers who quote the verses. The Latin variant is considered a trinitarian gloss, explaining or paralleled by the second Greek variant.\n\n\nThe gradual appearance of the comma in the manuscript evidence is represented in the following tables:\n\nThe comma is absent from an extant fragment of Clement of Alexandria (c. 200), through Cassiodorus (6th century), with homily style verse references from 1 John, including verse and without verse 7, the heavenly witnesses.\n\nAnother reference that is studied is from Clement's \"Prophetic Extracts\":\nThis is seen by some as allusion evidence that Clement was familiar with the verse.\n\nTertullian, in \"Against Praxeas\" (c. 210), supports a Trinitarian view by quoting :\n\nTertullian's use of \"tres unum sunt\" has been seen by many commentators as supporting authenticity, a textual connection to 1 John 5:7. \"It appears to me very clear that Tertullian is quoting I. John v. 7. in the passage now under consideration.\" While many other commentators have argued \"against\" any comma evidence here, most emphatically John Kaye's, \"far from containing an allusion to 1 Jo. v. 7, it furnishes most decisive proof that he knew nothing of the verse\". Proponents of authenticity emphasize the corroborative nature of examining the evidences of the time as one unit, including the Cyprian quotes and the Old Latin mss. \"… the testimony of these early fathers must stand and fall together; as St. Cyprian obviously follows his master Tertullian.\" Daniel McCarthy, also referencing the views of Wetstein and Nicholas Wiseman, offers an exegesis that the three heavenly witnesses are implied by context. comments cautiously \"An initial echo of the \"Comma Johanneum\" occurs as early as Tertullian Adv. Pax. 25.1 (CChr 2.1195; written ca. 215). In his commentary on John 16:14 he writes that the Father, Son, and Paraclete are one (\"unum\"), but not one person (\"unus\"). However, this passage cannot be regarded as a certain attestation of the \"Comma Johanneum.\"\"\n\nReferences from Tertullian in \"De Pudicitia\" 21:16 (On Modesty):\n\nand \"De Baptismo\":\n\nhave also been presented as verse allusions.\n\nThe Treatise on Rebaptism, placed as a 3rd-century writing and transmitted with Cyprian's works, has two sections that directly refer to the earthly witnesses, and thus has been used against authenticity by Nathaniel Lardner, Alfred Plummer and others. However, because of the context being water baptism and the precise wording being \"et isti tres unum sunt\", the Matthew Henry Commentary uses this as evidence for Cyprian speaking of the heavenly witnesses in Unity of the Church. And Arthur Cleveland Coxe and Nathaniel Cornwall consider the evidence as suggestively positive. Westcott and Hort also are positive. After approaching the Tertullian and Cyprian references negatively, \"morally certain that they would have quoted these words had they known them\" Westcott writes about the Rebaptism Treatise:\n\nThe Catholic Encyclopedia of 1910 asserts that Jerome \"does not seem to know the text\".\n\nComing down to us with the writings of Jerome we have the statement of faith attributed to Marcus Celedensis, friend and correspondent to Jerome, presented to Cyril:\n\nSimilarly, Jerome wrote of Phoebadius of Agen in his \"Lives of Illustrious Men\". \"Phoebadius, bishop of Agen, in Gaul, published a book Against the Arians. There are said to be other works by him, which I have not yet read. He is still living, infirm with age.\" William Hales looks at Phoebadius:\n\nGriesbach argued that Phoebadius was only making an allusion to Tertullian, and his unusual explanation was commented on by Reithmayer.\n\nAugustine of Hippo has been said to be completely silent on the matter, which has been taken as evidence that the comma did not exist as part of the epistle's text in his time. This \"argumentum ex silentio\" has been contested by other scholars, including Fickermann and Metzger. In addition, some Augustine references have been seen as verse allusions.\n\nThe City of God section, from Book V, Chapter 11:\n\nhas often been referenced as based upon the scripture verse of the heavenly witnesses. George Strecker acknowledges the City of God reference: \"Except for a brief remark in \"De civitate Dei\" (5.11; CChr 47.141), where he says of Father, Word, and Spirit that the three are one. Augustine († 430) does not cite the \"Comma Johanneum\". But it is certain on the basis of the work \"Contra Maximum\" 2.22.3 (PL 42.794-95) that he interpreted 1 John 5:7–8 in trinitarian terms.\" \nSimilarly, Homily 10 on the first Epistle of John has been asserted as an allusion to the verse:\n\nContra Maximinum has received attention especially for these two sections, especially the allegorical interpretation.\n\nJohn Scott Porter writes:\n\nThomas Joseph Lamy offers a different view based on the context and Augustine's purpose. Similarly Thomas Burgess. And Norbert Fickermann's reference and scholarship supports the idea that Augustine may have deliberately bypassed a direct quote of the heavenly witnesses.\n\nIn the \"Tome of Leo\", written to Archbishop Flavian of Constantinople, read at the Council of Chalcedon on 10 October 451 AD, and published in Greek, Leo the Great's usage of 1 John 5 has him moving in discourse from verse 6 to verse 8:\n\nThis epistle from Leo was considered by Richard Porson to be the \"strongest proof\" of verse inauthenticity (\"the strongest proof that this verse is spurious may be drawn from the Epistle of Leo the Great to Flavianus upon the Incarnation\") and went along with Porson's assertion that the verse was slow to enter into the Latin lines. Porson asserted that the verse \"remained a rude, unformed mass, and was not completely licked into shape till the end of the tenth century\". In response, Thomas Burgess points out that the context of Leo's argument would not call for the 7th verse. And that the verse was referenced in a fully formed manner centuries earlier than Porson's claim, at the time of Fulgentius and the Council of Carthage. Burgess pointed out that there were multiple confirmations that the verse was in the Latin Bibles of Leo's day. Burgess argued, ironically, that the fact that Leo could move from verse 6 to 8 for argument context is, in the bigger picture, favourable to authenticity. \"Leo's omission of the Verse is not only counterbalanced by its actual existence in contemporary copies, but the passage of his Letter is, in some material respects, favourable to the authenticity of the Verse, by its contradiction to some assertions confidently urged against the Verse by its opponents, and essential to their theory against it.\" Today, with the discovery of additional Old Latin evidences in the 19th century, the discourse of Leo is rarely referenced as a significant evidence against verse authenticity.\n\nThe 3rd-century Church father Cyprian (c. 200–58), in writing on the \"Unity of the Church\", Treatise I section 6 quoted John 10:30 and another scriptural spot:\nThe \"Catholic Encyclopedia\" concludes \"Cyprian… seems undoubtedly to have had it in mind\". Against this view, Daniel B. Wallace writes that since Cyprian does not quote \"the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit\" \"this in the least does not afford proof that he knew of such wording\". And the fact that Cyprian did not quote the \"exact wording… indicates that a Trinitarian interpretation was superimposed on the text by Cyprian\". In his position against Cyprian knowing of the Comma, Wallace is in agreement with the earlier critical edition of the New Testament (NA26 and UBS3) which considered Cyprian a witness \"against\" the Comma.\n\nThe Cyprian citation, dating to more than a century before any extant Epistle of John manuscripts and before the Arian controversies that are often considered pivotal in verse addition/omission debate, remains a central focus of comma research and textual apologetics. The Scrivener view is often discussed. Westcott and Hort assert: \"Tert and Cyp use language which renders it morally certain that they would have quoted these words had they known them; Cyp going so far as to assume a reference to the Trinity in the conclusion of v. 8\"\n\nIn the 20th century, Lutheran scholar Francis Pieper wrote in \"Christian Dogmatics\" emphasizing the antiquity and significance of the reference. Frequently commentators have seen Cyprian as having the verse in his Latin Bible, even if not directly supporting and commenting on verse authenticity. And some writers have seen the denial of the verse in the Bible of Cyprian as worthy of special note and humor.\n\nThe second, lesser reference from Cyprian that has been involved in the verse debate is from \"Ad Jubaianum\" 23.12. Cyprian, while discussing baptism, writes:\n\nKnittel emphasizes that Cyprian would be familiar with the Bible in Greek as well as Latin. \"Cyprian understood Greek. He read Homer, Plato, Hermes Trismegiatus and Hippocrates… he translated into Latin the Greek epistle written to him by Firmilianus\".\nUBS-4 has its entry for text inclusion as (Cyprian).\n\nThe Hundredfold Reward for Martyrs and Ascetics: \"De centesima, sexagesimal tricesima\" speaks of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit as \"three witnesses\" and was passed down with the Cyprian corpus. This was only first published in 1914 and thus does not show up in the historical debate. UBS-4 includes this in the apparatus as (Ps-Cyprian).\n\nThose who see Cyprian as negative evidence assert that other church writers, such as Athanasius of Alexandria and Origen, never quoted or referred to the passage, which they would have done if the verse was in the Bibles of that era. The contrasting position is that there are in fact such references, and that \"evidences from silence\" arguments, looking at the extant early church writer material, should not be given much weight as reflecting absence in the manuscripts—with the exception of verse-by-verse homilies, which were uncommon in the Ante-Nicene era.\n\nIn the scholium on Psalm 123 attributed to Origen is the commentary:\nThis has been considered by many commentators, including the translation source Nathaniel Ellsworth Cornwall, as an allusion to verse 7. Ellsworth especially noted the Richard Porson comment in response to the evidence of the Psalm commentary: \"The critical chemistry which could extract the doctrine of the Trinity from this place must have been exquisitely refining\". Fabricius wrote about the Origen wording \"ad locum 1 Joh v. 7 alludi ab origene non est dubitandum\".\n\nTraditionally, Athanasius was considered to lend support to the authenticity of the verse, one reason being the \"Disputation with Arius at the Council of Nicea\" which circulated with the works of Athanasius, where is found:\n\nToday, many scholars consider this a later work \"Pseudo-Athanasius\", perhaps by Maximus the Confessor. Charles Forster in \"New Plea\" argues for the writing as stylistically Athanasius. While the author and date are debated, this is a Greek reference directly related to the doctrinal Trinitarian-Arian controversies, and one that purports to be an account of Nicaea when those doctrinal battles were raging. The reference was given in UBS-3 as supporting verse inclusion, yet was removed from UBS-4 for reasons unknown.\n\nThe \"Synopsis of Scripture\", often ascribed to Athanasius, has also been referenced as indicating awareness of the Comma.\n\nThe earliest quotation which some scholars consider a direct reference to the heavenly witnesses from the First Epistle of John is from the Spaniard Priscillian c. 380. As the Latin is presented by a secondary source, it reads:\n\nThe secondary source for the Latin includes only 1 comma of punctuation (apparently unspecified as in the original or inserted by the modern editor). And this Latin has no indication as to where the quotation of 1 John ends in Priscillian nor where Priscillian starts making comments on it (if he does).\n\nAs given rendered in English, the statement reads:\n\nTheodor Zahn calls this \"the earliest quotation of the passage which is certain and which can be definitely dated (circa 380)\", a view expressed by Westcott, Brooke, Metzger and others.\n\nAnd Georg Strecker adds context: \"The oldest undoubted instance is in Priscillian \"Liber apologeticus\" I.4 (CSEL 18.6). Priscillian was probably a Sabellianist or Modalist, whose principal interest would have in the closing statement about the heavenly witnesses (\"and these three, the Father, the Word, the Holy Spirit, are one\"). Here he found his theological opinions confirmed: that the three persons of the Trinity are only modes or manners of appearance of the one God. This observation caused some interpreters to suppose that Priscillian himself created the \"Comma Johanneum\". However, there are signs of the \"Comma Johanneum\", although no certain attestations, even before Priscillian…\". In the early 1900s the Karl Künstle theory of Priscillian origination and interpolation was popular: \"The verse is an interpolation, first quoted and perhaps introduced by Priscillian (a.d. 380) as a pious fraud to convince doubters of the doctrine of the Trinity.\"\n\nAnother complementary early reference is an exposition of faith published in 1883 by Carl Paul Caspari from the Ambrosian manuscript, which also contains the Muratorian (canon) fragment.\n\nEdgar Simmons Buchanan, points out that the reading \"in Christo Iesu\" is textually valuable, referencing 1 John 5:7.\n\nThe authorship is uncertain, however it is often placed around the same period as Priscillian. Karl Künstle saw the writing as anti-Priscillianist, which would have competing doctrinal positions utilizing the verse. Alan England Brooke notes the similarities of the Expositio with the Priscillian form, and the Priscillian form with the Leon Palimpsest. Theodor Zahn refers to the Expositio as \"possibly contemporaneous\" to Priscilian, \"apparently taken from the proselyte Isaac (alias Ambrosiaster)\".\n\nJohn Chapman looked closely at these materials and the section in \"Liber Apologeticus\" around the Priscillian faith statement \"Pater Deus, Filius, Deus, et Spiritus sanctus Deus ; haec unum sunt in Christo Iesu\". Chapman saw an indication that Priscillian found himself bound to defend the comma by citing from the \"Unity of the Church\" Cyprian section.\n\n\"The Comma … was invoked at Carthage in 484 when the Catholic (anti-Arian) bishops of North Africa confessed their faith before Huneric the Vandal (Victor de Vita, \"Historia persecutionis Africanae Prov\" 2.82 [3.11]; CSEL, 7, 60).\" The Confession of faith representing the hundreds of orthodox Bishops included the following section, emphasizing the heavenly witnesses to teach \"luce clarius\" (clearer than the light):\n\nThere are additional heavenly witnesses references that are considered to be from the same period as the Council of Carthage, including references that have been attributed to Vigilius Tapsensis who attended the Council. Raymond Brown gives one summary:\n…in the century following Priscillian, the chief appearance of the Comma is in tractates defending the Trinity. In PL 62 227–334 there is a work \"De Trinitate\" consisting of twelve books… In Books 1 and 10 (PL 62, 243D, 246B, 297B) the Comma is cited three times. Another work on the Trinity consisting of three books \"Contra Varimadum\" … North African origin ca. 450 seems probable. The Comma is cited in 1.5 (CC 90, 20–21).\n\nOne of the references in \"De Trinitate\", from Book V.\nThe Contra Varimadum reference:\n\nThis is in the UBS apparatus as Varimadum.\n\nEbrard, in referencing this quote, comments, \"We see that he had before him the passage in his New Testament in its corrupt form (aqua, sanguis et caro, et tres in nobis sunt); but also, that the gloss was already in the text, \"and not merely in a single copy\", but that it was so widely diffused and acknowledged in the West as to be appealed to by him bona fide in his contest with his Arian opponents.\"\n\nIn the 6th century, Fulgentius of Ruspe, like Cyprian a father of the North African Church, skilled in Greek as well as his native Latin, used the verse in the doctrinal battles of the day.\n\nFrom \"Responsio contra Arianos\" \"Reply against the Arians\" Migne (Ad 10; CC 91A, 797).\n\nThen Fulgentius discusses the earlier reference by Cyprian, and the interweaving of the two Johannine verses, John 10:30 and 1 John 5:7.\n\nAnother heavenly witnesses reference from Fulgentius is in \"Contra Fabianum Fragmenta\" Migne (Frag. 21.4: CC 01A,797)\nAlso from Fulgentius in \"De Trinitate ad Felicem\":\n\nToday these references are generally accepted as probative to the verse being in the Bible of Fulgentius.\n\nA reference in \"De Fide Catholica adversus Pintam episcopum Arianum\" that is a \"Testimonia de Trinitate\":\n\nThe Codex Fuldensis includes a prologue to the Catholic Epistles referring to the comma (beginning with the words 'Non ita ordo est apud Graecos'). It presents itself as a letter of Jerome to Eustochium, but is the work of an unknown imitator, likely from the late 5th century. Its inauthenticity is stressed by the omission of the passage from the manuscript's own text of 1 John, but it demonstrates that some theologians of the fifth century felt it should be included.\n\nCassiodorus wrote Bible commentaries, and was familiar with Old Latin and Vulgate manuscripts, seeking out sacred manuscripts. Cassiodorus was also skilled in Greek. In \"Complexiones in Epistolis Apostolorum\", first published in 1721 by Scipio Maffei, in the commentary section on 1 John, from the Cassiodorus corpus, is written:\n\nThomas Joseph Lamy describes the Cassiodorus section and references that Tischendorf saw this as Cassiodorus having the text in his Bible. However, earlier \"Porson endeavoured to show that Cassiodorus had, in his copy, no more than the 8th verse, to which he added the gloss of Eucherius, with whose writings he was acquainted.\"\n\nIn the early 7th century, the \"Testimonia Divinae Scripturae et Patrum\" is often attributed to Isidore of Seville:\n\nArthur-Marie Le Hir asserts that evidences like Isidore and the Ambrose Ansbert Commentary on Revelation show early circulation of the Vulgate with the verse and thus also should be considered in the issues of Jerome's original Vulgate text and the authenticity of the Vulgate Prologue. Cassiodorus has also been indicated as reflecting the Vulgate text, rather than simply the Vetus Latina.\n\nAmbrose Ansbert refers to the scripture verse in his Revelation commentary:\n\"Ambrose Ansbert, in the middle of the eighth century, wrote a comment upon the Apocalypse, in which this verse is applied, in explaining the 5th verse of the first chapter of the Revelation\".\n\nIn the Middle Ages a Trinitarian doctrinal debate arose around the position of Joachim of Florence (1135–1202) which was different from the more traditional view of Peter Lombard (c. 1100–1160). When the Fourth Council of the Lateran was held in 1215 at Rome, with hundreds of Bishops attending, the understanding of the heavenly witnesses was a primary point in siding with Lombard, against the writing of Joachim.\n\nThe Council thus printed the verse in both Latin and Greek, and this may have contributed to later scholarship references in Greek to the verse. The reference to \"some manuscripts\" showed an acknowledgment of textual issues, yet this likely related to \"and the three are one\" in verse eight, not the heavenly witnesses in verse seven. The manuscript issue for the final phrase in verse eight and the commentary by Thomas Aquinas were an influence upon the text and note of the Complutensian Polyglot.\n\nIn this period, the greater portion of Bible commentary was written in Latin. The references in this era are extensive and wide-ranging. Some of the better-known writers who utilized the comma as scripture, in addition to Peter Lombard and Joachim of Fiore, include Gerbert of Aurillac (Pope Sylvester), Peter Abelard, Bernard of Clairvaux, Duns Scotus, Roger of Wendover (historian, including the Lateran Council), Thomas Aquinas (many verse uses, including one which has Origen relating to \"the three that give witness in heaven\"), William of Ockham (of razor fame), Nicholas of Lyra and the commentary of the Glossa Ordinaria.\n\nEmanual Calecas in the 14th and Joseph Bryennius (c. 1350–1430) in the 15th century reference the comma in their Greek writings.\n\nThe Orthodox accepted the comma as Johannine scripture notwithstanding its absence in the Greek manuscripts line. The Orthodox Confession of Faith, published in Greek in 1643 by the multilingual scholar Peter Mogila specifically references the comma. \"Accordingly the Evangelist teacheth (1 John v. 7.) There are three that bear Record in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost and these three are one …\"\n\nThe Epistle of Gregory, the Bishop of Sis, to Haitho c. 1270 utilized 1 John 5:7 in the context of the use of water in the mass. The Synod of Sis of 1307 expressly cited the verse, and deepened the relationship with Rome.\n\nCommentators generally see the Armenian text from the 13th century on as having been modified by the interaction with the Latin church and Bible, including the addition of the comma in some manuscripts.\n\nThere are a number of special manuscript notations and entries relating to 1 John 5:7. Vulgate scholar Samuel Berger reports on MS 13174 in the Bibliothèque nationale in Paris that shows the scribe listing four distinct textual variations of the heavenly witnesses. Three are understood by the scribe to have textual lineages of Athanasius, Augustine and Fulgentius. The Franciscan Correctorium gives a note about there being manuscripts with the verses transposed. The Regensburg ms. referenced by Fickermann discusses the positions of Jerome and Augustine. The Glossa Ordinaria discusses the Vulgate Prologue in the Preface, in addition to its commentary section on the verse. John J. Contrini in \"Haimo of Auxerre, Abbot of Sasceium (Cessy-les-Bois), and a New Sermon on I John v. 4–10\" discusses a 9th-century manuscript and the Leiden sermon.\n\nThe central figure in the 16th-century history of the Johannine Comma is the humanist Erasmus, and his efforts leading to the publication of the Greek New Testament. The comma was omitted in the first edition in 1516, the \"Nouum instrumentum omne: diligenter ab Erasmo Roterodamo recognitum et emendatum\" and the second edition of 1519. The verse is placed in the third edition, published in 1522, and those of 1527 and 1535.\n\nErasmus included the comma, with commentary, in his paraphrase edition, first published in 1520. And in \"Ratio seu methodus compendio perueniendi ad ueram theologiam\", first published in 1518, Erasmus included the comma in the interpretation of John 12 and 13. Erasmian scholar John Jack Bateman, discussing the \"Paraphrase\" and the \"Ratio uerae theologiae\", says of these uses of the comma that \"Erasmus attributes some authority to it despite any doubts he had about its transmission in the Greek text.\"\nThe New Testament of Erasmus provoked critical responses that focused on a number of verses, including his text and translation decisions on Romans 9:5, John 1:1, 1 Timothy 1:17, Titus 2:13 and Philippians 2:6. The absence of the comma from the first two editions received a sharp response from churchmen and scholars, and was discussed and defended by Erasmus in the correspondence with Edward Lee and Diego López de Zúñiga (Stunica), and Erasmus is also known to have referenced the verse in correspondence with Antoine Brugnard in 1518. The first two Erasmus editions only had a small note about the verse. The major Erasmus writing regarding comma issues was in the \"Annotationes\" to the third edition of 1522, expanded in the fourth edition of 1527 and then given a small addition in the fifth edition of 1535.\n\nErasmus is said to have replied to his critics that the comma did not occur in any of the Greek manuscripts he could find, but that he would add it to future editions if it appeared in a single Greek manuscript. Such a manuscript was subsequently produced, some say concocted, by a Franciscan, and Erasmus, true to his word, added the comma to his 1522 edition, but with a lengthy footnote setting out his suspicion that the manuscript had been prepared expressly to confute him. This change was accepted into editions based on the Textus Receptus, the chief source for the King James Version, thereby fixing the comma firmly in the English-language scriptures for centuries. There is no explicit evidence, however, that such a promise was ever made.\n\nIn 1807 Charles Butler described the dispute to that point as consisting of three distinct phases.\n\nThe 1st phase began with the disputes and correspondence involving Erasmus with Edward Lee followed by Jacobus Stunica. And about the 16th-century controversies, Thomas Burgess summarized \"In the sixteenth century its chief opponents were Socinus, Blandrata, and the Fratres Poloni; its defenders, Ley, Beza, Bellarmine, and Sixtus Senensis.\" In the 17th century John Selden in Latin and Francis Cheynell and Henry Hammond were English writers with studies on the verse, Johann Gerhard and Abraham Calovius from the German Lutherans, writing in Latin.\n\nThe 2nd dispute stage begins with Sandius, the Arian around 1670. Francis Turretin published \"De Tribus Testibus Coelestibus\" in 1674 and the verse was a central focus of the writings of Symon Patrick. In 1689 the attack on authenticity by Richard Simon was published in English, in his \"Critical History of the Text of the New Testament\". Many responded directly to the views of Simon, including Thomas Smith, , James Benigne Bossuet, , Thomas Ittigius, Abraham Taylor and the published sermons of Edmund Calamy. There was the famous verse defences by John Mill and later by Johann Bengel. Also in this era was the David Martin and Thomas Emlyn debate. There were attacks on authenticity by Richard Bentley and Samuel Clarke and William Whiston and defence of authenticity by John Guyse in the Practical Expositor. There were writings by numerous additional scholars, including publication in London of Isaac Newton's \"Two Letters\" in 1754, which he had written to John Locke in 1690. The mariner's compass poem of Bengel was given in a slightly modified form by John Wesley.\n\nThe \"third stage of the controversy\" begins with the quote from Edward Gibbon in 1776:\nEven the Scriptures themselves were profaned by their rash and sacrilegious hands. The memorable text, which asserts the unity of the three who bear witness in heaven, is condemned by the universal silence of the orthodox fathers, ancient versions, and authentic manuscripts. It was first alleged by the Catholic bishops whom Hunneric summoned to the conference of Carthage. An allegorical interpretation, in the form, perhaps, of a marginal note, invaded the text of the Latin Bibles, which were renewed and corrected in a dark period of ten centuries.\nIt is followed by the response of George Travis that led to the Porson–Travis debate. In the 1794 3rd edition of \"Letters to Edward Gibbon\", Travis included a 42-part appendix with source references. Another event coincided with the inauguration of this stage of the debate: \"a great stirring in sacred science was certainly going on. Griesbach's first edition of the New Testament (1775–7) marks the commencement of a new era.\" The Griesbach GNT provided an alternative to the Received Text editions to assist as scholarship textual legitimacy for opponents of the verse.\n\nSome highlights from this era are the Nicholas Wiseman Old Latin and Speculum scholarship, the defence of the verse by the Germans Sander, and Mayer, the Charles Forster \"New Plea\" book which revisited Richard Porson's arguments, and the earlier work by his friend Arthur-Marie Le Hir, Discoveries included the Priscillian reference and Exposito Fidei. Also Old Latin manuscripts including La Cava, and the moving up of the date of the Vulgate Prologue due to its being found in Codex Fuldensis. Ezra Abbot wrote on 1 John V.7 and Luther's German Bible and Scrivener's analysis came forth in Six Lectures and Plain Introduction. In the 1881 Revision came the full removal of the verse. Daniel McCarthy noted the change in position among the textual scholars, and in French there was the sharp Roman Catholic debate in the 1880s involving Pierre Rambouillet, Auguste-François Maunoury, Jean Michel Alfred Vacant, Elie Philippe and Paulin Martin. In Germany Wilhelm Kölling defended authenticity, and in Ireland Charles Vincent Dolman wrote about the Revision and the comma in the \"Dublin Review\", noting that \"the heavenly witnesses have departed\".\n\nThe 20th century saw the scholarship of Alan England Brooke and Joseph Pohle, the RCC controversy following the 1897 Papal declaration as to whether the verse could be challenged by Catholic scholars, the Karl Künstle Priscillian-origin theory, the detailed scholarship of Augustus Bludau in many papers, the Eduard Riggenbach book, and the Franz Pieper and Edward Hills defences. There were specialty papers by Anton Baumstark (Syriac reference), Norbert Fickermann (Augustine), Claude Jenkins (Bede), Mateo del Alamo, Teófilo Ayuso Marazuela, Franz Posset (Luther) and Rykle Borger (Peshitta). Verse dismissals, such as that given by Bruce Metzger, became popular. There was the fine technical scholarship of Raymond Brown. And the continuing publication and studies of the Erasmus correspondence, writings and Annotations, some with English translation. From Germany came Walter Thiele's Old Latin studies and sympathy for the comma being in the Bible of Cyprian, and the research by Henk de Jonge on Erasmus and the Received Text and the comma.\n\nThe last 20 years have seen a popular revival of interest in the historic verse controversies and the textual debate. Factors include the growth of interest in the Received Text and the Authorized Version (including the King James Version Only movement) and the questioning of Critical Text theories, the 1995 book by Michael Maynard documenting the historical debate on 1 John 5:7, and the internet ability to spur research and discussion with participatory interaction. In this period, King James Bible defenders and opponents wrote a number of papers on the Johannine Comma, usually published in evangelical literature and on the internet. In textual criticism scholarship circles, the book by Klaus Wachtel \"Der byzantinische Text der katholischen Briefe: Eine Untersuchung zur Entstehung der Koine des Neuen Testaments\", 1995 contains a section with detailed studies on the Comma. Similarly, \"Der einzig wahre Bibeltext?\", published in 2006 by K. Martin Heide. Special interest has been given to the studies of the Codex Vaticanus umlauts by Philip Barton Payne and Paul Canart, senior paleographer at the Vatican Library. The Erasmus studies have continued, including research on the Valladolid inquiry by Peter G. Bietenholz and Lu Ann Homza. Jan Krans has written on conjectural emendation and other textual topics, looking closely at the Received Text work of Erasmus and Beza. And some elements of the recent scholarship commentary have been especially dismissive and negative.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church at the Council of Trent in 1546 defined the Biblical canon as \"the entire books with all their parts, as these have been wont to be read in the Catholic Church and are contained in the old Latin Vulgate\". \"On the Catholic side, the Comma appeared in both the Sixtine (1590) and the Clementine (1592) editions of the Vulgate, the latter of which became the official Bible of the Roman Catholic Church.\" Although the revised Vulgate contained the Comma, the earliest known copies did not, leaving the status of the Comma Johanneum unclear. On 13 January 1897, during a period of reaction in the Church, the Holy Office decreed that Catholic theologians could not \"with safety\" deny or call into doubt the Comma's authenticity. Pope Leo XIII approved this decision two days later, though his approval was not \"in forma specifica\"—that is, Leo XIII did not invest his full papal authority in the matter, leaving the decree with the ordinary authority possessed by the Holy Office. Three decades later, on 2 June 1927, Pope Pius XI decreed that the Comma Johanneum was open to dispute.\n\nIn more recent years, the Comma has become relevant to the King James Only Movement, a largely Protestant development most prevalent within the fundamentalist and Independent Baptist branch of the Baptist churches. Many proponents view the Comma as an important Trinitarian text. The defence of the verse by Edward Freer Hills in 1956 as part of his defence of the Textus Receptus \"The King James Version Defended\" The Johannine Comma (1 John 5:7) was unusual due to Hills' textual criticism scholarship credentials.\n\nIn 1 John 5:7–8 in the Received Text, the following words appear (the words in bold print are the words of the Johannine Comma).\n\nIn 1 John 5:7–8 in the Critical Text and Majority Text, the following words appear.\n\nAccording to Johann Bengel, Eugenius Bulgaris, John Oxlee and Daniel Wallace, each article-participle phrase (οἱ μαρτυροῦντες) in 1 John 5:7–8 functions as a substantive and agrees with the natural gender (masculine) of the idea being expressed (persons), to which three subsequent appositional (added for clarification) articular (preceded by an article) nouns (ὁ πατὴρ ὁ λόγος καὶ τὸ ἅγιον πνεῦμα / τὸ πνεῦμα καὶ τὸ ὕδωρ καὶ τὸ αἷμα) are added.\n\nAccording to Frederick Nolan, Robert Dabney and Edward Hills, each article-participle phrase (οἱ μαρτυροῦντες) in 1 John 5:7–8 functions as an adjective that modifies the three subsequent articular nouns (ὁ πατὴρ ὁ λόγος καὶ τὸ ἅγιον πνεῦμα / τὸ πνεῦμα καὶ τὸ ὕδωρ καὶ τὸ αἷμα) and therefore must agree with the grammatical gender (masculine / neuter) of the first subsequent articular noun (ὁ πατὴρ / τὸ πνεῦμα).\n\nTitus 2:13 is an example of how an article-adjective (or article-participle) phrase looks when it functions as an adjective that modifies multiple subsequent nouns.\n\nMatthew 23:23 is an example of how an article-adjective (or article-participle) phrase looks when it functions as a substantive to which multiple subsequent appositional articular nouns are added.\n\nAccording to Bengel, Bulgaris, Oxlee and Wallace, 1 John 5:7–8 is like Matthew 23:23, not like Titus 2:13.\n\nAccording to Nolan, Dabney and Hills, 1 John 5:7–8 is like Titus 2:13, not like Matthew 23:23.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2346810", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2346810", "title": "Lectio Divina", "text": "Lectio Divina\n\nIn Christianity, Lectio Divina (Latin for \"Divine Reading\") is a traditional Benedictine practice of scriptural reading, meditation and prayer intended to promote communion with God and to increase the knowledge of God's word. It does not treat scripture as texts to be studied, but as the living word.\n\nTraditionally, \"Lectio Divina\" has four separate steps: read; meditate; pray; contemplate. First a passage of scripture is read, then its meaning is reflected upon. This is followed by prayer and contemplation on the Word of God.\n\nThe focus of \"Lectio Divina\" is not a theological analysis of biblical passages but viewing them with Christ as the key to their meaning. For example, given Jesus' statement in : \"Peace I leave with you; my peace I give unto you\", an analytical approach would focus on the reason for the statement during the Last Supper, the biblical context, etc. In \"Lectio Divina\", however, the practitioner \"enters\" and shares the peace of Christ rather than \"dissecting\" it. In some Christian teachings, this form of meditative prayer leads to an increased knowledge of Christ.\n\nThe roots of scriptural reflection and interpretation go back to Origen in the 3rd century, after whom Ambrose taught them to Augustine of Hippo. The monastic practice of \"Lectio Divina\" was first established in the 6th century by Benedict of Nursia and was then formalized as a four-step process by the Carthusian monk Guigo II during the 12th century. In the 20th century, the constitution \"Dei verbum\" of the Second Vatican Council recommended \"Lectio Divina\" to the general public and its importance was affirmed by Pope Benedict XVI at the start of the 21st century.\n\nBefore the emergence of the Western monastic communities, a key contribution to the foundation of \"Lectio Divina\" came from Origen in the 3rd century, with his view of \"Scripture as a sacrament\". In a letter to Gregory of Neocaesarea Origen wrote: \"[W]hen you devote yourself to the divine reading ... seek the meaning of divine words which is hidden from most people\".\n\nOrigen believed that The Word (i.e. \"Logos\") was incarnate in Scripture and could therefore touch and teach readers and hearers. Origen taught that the reading of Scripture could help move beyond elementary thoughts and discover the higher wisdom hidden in the \"Word of God\".\n\nIn Origen's approach the major interpretive element of Scripture is Christ. In his view all Scriptural texts are secondary to Christ and are only revelations in as much as they refer to Christ as The Word of God. In this view, using Christ as the \"interpretive key\" unlocks the message in Scriptural texts.\n\nThe \"primordial role\" of Origen in interpreting Scripture was acknowledged by Pope Benedict XVI. Origen's methods were then learned by Ambrose of Milan, who towards the end of the 4th century taught them to Saint Augustine, thereby introducing them into the monastic traditions of the Western Church thereafter.\n\nIn the 4th century, as the Desert Fathers began to seek God in the deserts of Palestine and Egypt, they produced early models of Christian monastic life that persisted in the Eastern Church. These early communities gave rise to the tradition of a Christian life of \"constant prayer\" in a monastic setting.\n\nAlthough the desert monks gathered to hear scripture recited in public, and would then recite those words privately in their cells, this was not the same practice as what later became \"Lectio Divina\" since it involved no meditative step.\n\nAfter Origen, Church Fathers such as St. Ambrose, St. Augustine, and St. Hilary of Poitiers used the terms \"Lectio Divina\" and \"Lectio Sacra\" to refer to the reading of Scripture.\n\nAccording to Jean Leclercq, OSB, the founders of the medieval tradition of \"Lectio Divina\" were Saint Benedict and Pope Gregory I. However, the methods that they employed had precedents in the biblical period both in Hebrew and Greek. A text that combines these traditions is where Apostle Paul refers to the presence of God's word in the believer's \"mouth or heart\". It was the recitation of the biblical text that provided the rationale for \"Lectio Divina\".\n\nWith the motto \"Ora et labora\" (\"Pray and work\"), daily life in a Benedictine monastery consisted of three elements: liturgical prayer, manual labor and \"Lectio Divina\", a quiet prayerful reading of the Bible. This slow and thoughtful reading of Scripture, and the ensuing pondering of its meaning, was their meditation. This spiritual practice is called \"divine reading\" or \"spiritual reading\"i.e. \"lectio divina\".\n\nBenedict wrote:\n\nThe Rule of Saint Benedict (chapter #48) stipulated specific times and manners for \"Lectio Divina\". The entire community in a monastery was to take part in the readings during Sunday, except those who had other tasks to perform.\n\nEarly in the 12th century, Saint Bernard of Clairvaux was instrumental in re-emphasizing the importance of \"Lectio Divina\" within the Cistercian order. Bernard considered \"Lectio Divina\" and contemplation guided by the Holy Spirit the keys to nourishing Christian spirituality.\n\nThe progression from Bible reading, to meditation, to prayer, to loving regard for God, was first formally described by Guigo II, a Carthusian monk and prior of Grande Chartreuse who died late in the 12th century. The Carthusian order follows its own Rule, called the Statutes, rather than the Rule of St Benedict.\n\nGuigo II's book \"The Ladder of Monks\" is subtitled \"a letter on the contemplative life\" and is considered the first description of methodical prayer in the western mystical tradition. In Guigo's four stages one first reads, which leads to think about (i.e. meditate on) the significance of the text; that process in turn leads the person to respond in prayer as the third stage. The fourth stage is when the prayer, in turn, points to the gift of quiet stillness in the presence of God, called contemplation.\n\nGuigo named the four steps of this \"ladder\" of prayer with the Latin terms \"lectio\", \"meditatio\", \"oratio\", and \"contemplatio\". In the 13th century the Carmelite Rule of St. Albert prescribed to Carmelites the daily prayerful pondering on the Word of God, namely to ruminate day and night the Divine Law. \"Lectio Divina\" alongside the daily celebration of liturgy is to this day the pillar of prayer in Carmel.\n\n\"Lectio Divina\" was practiced by St. Dominic de Guzman, founder of the Dominican Order.\n\nIn the 14th century, Gerard of Zutphen built on \"Guigo's Ladder\" to write his major work \"On Spiritual Ascents\". Zutphen warned against considered meditation without reading of scripture, and taught that the reading prepares the mind, so meditation will not fall into error. Similarly, he taught that meditation prepares the mind for contemplation.\n\nBy the beginning of the 16th century, the methods of \"methodical prayer\" had reached Spain and St. John of the Cross taught the four stages of Guigo II to his monks. During the century, Protestant Reformers such as John Calvin continued to advocate the \"Lectio Divina\". A Reformed version of the \"Lectio Divina\" was also popular among the Puritans: Richard Baxter, a Puritan theologian, championed the practice.\n\nBy the middle of 19th century, the historical critical approach to biblical analysis which had started over a century earlier, and focused on determining the historicity of gospel episodes, had taken away some of the emphasis on spreading \"Lectio Divina\" outside monastic communities. However, the early part of the 20th century witnessed a revival in the practice, and books and articles on \"Lectio Divina\" aimed at the general public began to appear by the middle of the century.\n\nIn 1965, one of the principal documents of the Second Vatican Council, the dogmatic constitution \"Dei verbum\" (\"Word of God\") emphasized the use of \"Lectio Divina\". On the 40th anniversary of \"Dei verbum\" in 2005, Pope Benedict XVI reaffirmed its importance and stated:\nIn his November 6, 2005 Angelus address, Benedict XVI emphasized the role of the Holy Spirit in \"Lectio Divina\": In his annual Lenten addresses to the priests of the Diocese of Rome, Pope Benedict – mainly after the 2008 Synod of Bishops on the Bible – emphasized \"Lectio Divina\" importance, as in 2012, when he used Ephesians 4: 1–16 on a speech about certain problems facing the Church. Beforehand, he and Pope John Paul II had used a question-and-answer format.\n\nSince the latter part of the 20th century, the popularity of \"Lectio Divina\" has increased outside monastic circles and many lay Catholics, as well as some Protestants, practice it, at times keeping a \"Lectio journal\" in which they record their thoughts and contemplations after each session. The importance of \"Lectio Divina\" is stressed in the Anglican Communion as well.\n\nHistorically, \"Lectio Divina\" has been a \"community practice\" performed by monks in monasteries. Although it can be taken up individually, its community element should not be forgotten.\n\n\"Lectio Divina\" has been likened to \"feasting on the Word\": first, the taking of a bite (\"lectio\"); then chewing on it (\"meditatio\"); savoring its essence (\"oratio\") and, finally, \"digesting\" it and making it a part of the body (\"contemplatio\"). In Christian teachings, this form of meditative prayer leads to an increased knowledge of Christ.\n\nUnlike meditative practices in Eastern Christianity – for instance, hesychasm, where the Jesus Prayer is repeated many times – \"Lectio Divina\" uses different Scripture passages at different times. Although a passage may be repeated a few times, \"Lectio Divina\" is not essentially repetitive in nature.\n\nThe first step is the reading of Scripture. In order to achieve a calm and tranquil state of mind, preparation before \"Lectio Divina\" is recommended. The biblical reference for preparation via stillness is : \"Be still, and know that I am God.\" An example would be sitting quietly and in silence and reciting a prayer inviting the Holy Spirit to guide the reading of the Scripture that is to follow.\n\nThe biblical basis for the preparation goes back to which emphasizes the role of the Holy Spirit in revealing the Word of God. As in the statement by John the Baptist in that \"Christ stands in the midst of those who seek him\", the preparatory step should open the mind to finding Christ in the passage being read.\n\nFollowing the preparation the first movement of \"Lectio Divina\" is slow and gradual reading of the scriptural passage, perhaps several times. The biblical basis for the reading goes back to and the presence of God's word in the believer's \"mouth or heart\".\n\nThe attentive reading begins the process through which a higher level of understanding can be achieved. In the traditional Benedictine approach the passage is slowly read four times, each time with a slightly different focus.\nAlthough \"Lectio Divina\" involves reading, it is less a practice of reading than one of listening to the inner message of the Scripture delivered through the Holy Spirit. \"Lectio Divina\" does not seek information or motivation, but communion with God. It does not treat Scripture as text to be studied, but as the \"Living Word\".\n\nThe second movement in \"Lectio Divina\" thus involves meditating upon and pondering on the scriptural passage. When the passage is read, it is generally advised not to try to assign a meaning to it at first, but to wait for the action of the Holy Spirit to illuminate the mind, as the passage is pondered upon.\n\nThe English word ponder comes from the Latin \"pondus\" which relates to the mental activity of weighing or considering. To ponder on the passage that has been read, it is held lightly and gently considered from various angles. Again, the emphasis is not on analysis of the passage but to keep the mind open and allow the Holy Spirit to inspire a meaning for it.\n\nAn example passage may be the statement by Jesus during the Last Supper in : \"Peace I leave with you; my peace I give unto you\".\n\nAn analytical approach would focus on why Jesus said that, the fact that it was said at the Last Supper, and the context within the biblical episode. Other theological analysis may follow, e.g. the cost at which Jesus the Lamb of God provided peace through his obedience to the will of Father, etc.\n\nHowever, these theological analyses are generally avoided in \"Lectio Divina\", where the focus is on Christ as the key that interprets the passage and relates it to the meditator. So rather than \"dissecting peace\" in an analytical manner, the practitioner of \"Lectio Divina\" \"enters peace\" and shares the peace of Christ. The focus will thus be on achieving peace via a closer communion with God rather than a biblical analysis of the passage. Similar other passages may be \"Abide in my love\", \"I am the Good Shepherd\", etc.\n\nIn the Christian tradition, prayer is understood as dialogue with God, that is, as loving conversation with God who has invited us into an embrace. The constitution \"Dei verbum\" which endorsed \"Lectio Divina\" for the general public, as well as in monastic settings, quoted Saint Ambrose on the importance of prayer in conjunction with Scripture reading and stated:\n\nPope Benedict XVI emphasized the importance of using \"Lectio Divina\" and prayers on Scripture as a guiding light and a source of direction and stated:\n\nContemplation takes place in terms of silent prayer that expresses love for God. The Catechism of the Catholic Church defines contemplative prayer as \"the hearing the Word of God\" in an attentive mode. It states:\n\nThe role of the Holy Spirit in contemplative prayer has been emphasized by Christian spiritual writers for centuries. In the 12th century, Saint Bernard of Clairvaux compared the Holy Spirit to a kiss by the Eternal Father which allows the practitioner of contemplative prayer to experience union with God. In the 14th century, Richard Rolle viewed contemplation as the path that leads the soul to union with God in love, and considered the Holy Spirit as the center of contemplation.\n\nFrom a theological perspective, God's grace is considered a principle, or cause, of contemplation, with its benefits delivered through the gifts of the Holy Spirit.\n\nWhile the \"Lectio Divina\" has been the key method of meditation and contemplation within the Benedictine, Cistercian and Carthusian orders, other Catholic religious orders have used other methods.\n\nAn example is another four-step approach, that by Saint Clare of Assisi shown in the table opposite, which is used by the Franciscan order. Saint Clare's method is more visual than Guigo II's which seems more intellectual in comparison.\n\nSaint Teresa of Avila's method of \"recollection\" which uses book passages to keep focus during meditation has similarities to the way \"Lectio Divina\" uses a specific Scriptural passage as the centerpiece of a session of meditation and contemplation. It is likely that Teresa did not initially know of Guigo II's methods, although she may have been indirectly influenced by those teachings via the works of Francisco de Osuna which she studied in detail.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "27686737", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27686737", "title": "Martin Foss", "text": "Martin Foss\n\nMartin Foss (1889–1968) was a German-born American philosopher, professor, and scholar.\n\nMartin Foss was born in Berlin, Germany, in 1889 and studied philosophy and law at German and French universities. He married Hilde Schindler, and they had two children, Oliver Foss, a painter, and the composer Lukas Foss. The Jewish family left Germany in 1933 when Adolf Hitler came into power, and for the next four years Martin Fuchs commuted secretly between Paris and Berlin. With the help of the Quaker community in the United States, the family was able to immigrate to the U.S. in 1937. The Quakers provided initial shelter for the family and advised Martin to change the family name from Fuchs to Foss. (It is unknown why the name was not changed to Fox, which is what \"Fuchs\" means.) Martin subsequently became an American citizen. He taught philosophy at Haverford College, where he retired as professor emeritus, as well as at Temple University. He died of a heart attack at the age of 79, while he was running to catch a plane at Heathrow Airport.\n\nMartin Foss taught and wrote during a time when phenomenology dominated and influenced many thinkers, such as Martin Heidegger, Ortega y Gasset, and Jean-Paul Sartre. Existentialism was also popular, but his view of existence was based more on the views of Medieval thinkers such as Cusanus. Foss was considered to be an Aristotelian philosopher. He was a student of Max Scheler, whose works had a significant influence on his ideas about ethics, value and love.\n\nMartin Foss's book, \"Symbol and Metaphor in Human Experience\", was listed as one of the “Most Neglected Books of the Past 25 Years” by \"The American Scholar\" in 1956. Other writers have cited his work as being \"far-reaching,\" \"seminal,\" and \"ahead of its time.\" In the academic treatise, \"The Faces of Reason: An Essay on Philosophy and Culture in English Canada, 1850-1950\", authors Leslie Armour and Elizabeth Trott state that Martin Foss may be considered a greater philosopher than Martin Heidegger. Although Martin Heidegger has clearly had far greater recognition and impact, Martin Foss's work deserves renewed attention.\n\nProfessor Foss was highly regarded by his Haverford College students as written in their class of 1948 yearbook dedication:\n\n\"Soon after his arrival on the Haverford campus, Dr. Martin Foss impressed his unique personality on the students who were lucky enough or foresighted enough to take one of his courses. In his own inimitable manner, Dr. Foss graphically developed the neophytes into thinking students. By driving home his points with emotional style so characteristic of him and him alone. Dr. Foss instilled a love of his subject into all of us who studied under him. No other professor in recent memory has so often been imitated in campus skits with such friendly satire. Dr. Foss' own brand of \"Phil-Foss-ophy\" has, of necessity, been responsible for such well-known phrases as \"Yes, my dear, but you see...\" and \"the stream of life, the flux\". Standing fast to his views on any particular subject Dr. Foss will fall back on his two favorite philosophers, Kant and Aristotle, to back him up. A man with such deep scholarly convictions and great love for his chosen profession could not help but make a profound impression on the students of Haverford, and it is with the deepest gratitude and respect that we dedicate the 1948 RECORD to Martin Foss, teacher, scholar, and friend.\"\n\nMartin Foss’s work deals with the “large” issues of life—love, death, and creative rebirth. His writings on art and creative process are particularly noteworthy, offering a missing perspective in that genre. His texts reach far beyond philosophy, and have been used in academic depth psychology, theology, and art programs, as well as philosophy programs.\n\nFoss's perspective on Greek tragedy is important and unprecedented. His views on tragedy as religious drama give new meaning to the word \"religion.\"\n\nIn his seminal book \"Symbol and Metaphor In Human Experience,\" for which he is primarily known, Foss explains the difference between the Self as a maker of things and the creative process of personality. The germ of this distinction is developed as well in another of his books, \"Death, Sacrifice, and Tragedy\", which explores in more detail the meanings of Greek and Shakespearean tragedies. In Foss’s view, the significance of Greek tragedy involves the discovery of the \"creative and dynamic personality and man's sacrificial and intercessional nature.\"\n\nHe writes: \"life in its core is a perpetual conversion from a lower sphere to a higher one, destroying the lower for the sake of realizing the higher, and this creative destruction, the sacrificial action, conveys to life its essential character, which is sacramental.\"\n\nThe theme of death, sacrifice, and tragedy is the basis for his view of ethics which supplants the modern humanist perspective that is limited to pragmatic man using his environment solely for fulfilling the needs and desires of the body. This use of the environment for practical expediency is a sphere which man and the animal have in common. It is the world of order and the making of things for their various uses. But beyond the physical world, Foss argues that man is a citizen of another world as well, a world that is hidden but disclosed. This world is the sphere of value \"where no things, no accomplishments, no possessions as such count, but where works and achievements manifest a loving communion and nothing else.\" In Foss’s view, the purpose of human life is to serve this spiritual, transcendent world which rises before man as the meaning and destiny of his life. Through sacrifice and the creative process of personality, man is lifted into this world of intensive reality which shapes his destiny.\n\nFoss contrasts this concept of creation with the commonly accepted ethic of utilitarianism that is prevalent in modern societies. He writes that an ethics of utilitarianism enables a \"rational organization of a collective ritual of law,\" and he defines rituals of law as symbolic reductions that are finite and relative (i.e., not the source of absolute ethical values). Stuck in this deficient sphere, man desires a more meaningful life, which involves seeking the higher realm of creation. Foss refers to this choice as \"man under destiny.\" It is not an easy way of living, since one must accept the sacramental nature of life and the communion of Love as the source of one's direction in life.\n\nWhile other great thinkers in the early 20th century such as Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud concentrated their research on defining the human unconscious, Martin Foss took on its natural counterpoint, consciousness. The main premise of consciousness was that it wasn’t a static object of humanity comprehendible only by philosophers and theologians. Consciousness is a process whose partner is life. Foss wrote “we are here in a realm where consciousness has not an object, not a content detached from itself, but is aware merely of its own drive and destiny”. Consciousness contains all the potential of human existence. “Consciousness is real, is being; it may be potential being, but even as potential it is in a process of realization in which no distinction can be made between that which is but could also not be (matter or mere possibility) and that which essentially and necessarily is (form)”. By attaching the conditionality of potential to his definition of consciousness, Foss essentially said that human beings have no limitations on what they can be, perceive, and create. An idea existing only in the mind is as real as what is perceived via the physical senses.\n\nFoss's work diverges in important ways from that of Carl Jung. Both scholars were writing in parallel (during the same period of time) about similar concepts, although Foss highlights the creative process as the central element of life in a way that Jung does not. Jung's definition of the symbol is very different from Foss's. In Jung's view, a symbol has great meaning, deriving from the collective unconscious. Contrary to Jung, Foss uses the term \"symbol\" to refer to that which is man-made and static (Jung uses the term \"sign\" to denote something static). Foss uses the term \"metaphor\" to denote the universal creative process that underlies human life and consciousness. In Foss's view, the metaphoric process of life is a continuous, ongoing creative force that is always working to \"move beyond\" (and destroy) the static state of the symbol. The metaphoric wants to create anew. One might compare Jung's concept of the \"collective unconscious\" to Foss's concept of the metaphoric, but again, Jung makes no real acknowledgement of life as an ongoing creative process in the way that Foss does. Foss provides a fascinating and important theory for how change happens in life—a theory that has been unmatched by no other philosopher. Perhaps one reason that their work was not referenced by the other, is because Jung was writing in the field of psychology, while Foss was a philosopher.\n\nHis writings can also be compared with the writings of Martin Heidegger and Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, both of whom are well known for their views on process philosophy which describes the universe as a process, rather than a fixed state.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "25076961", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25076961", "title": "Neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development", "text": "Neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development\n\nNeo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development criticize and build upon Jean Piaget's theory of cognitive development.\n\nThe neo-Piagetian theories aim to correct one or more of the following weaknesses in Piaget's theory:\n\nTo correct these weaknesses of Piaget's theory, various researchers, who are known as neo-Piagetian theorists, produced models of cognitive development that integrate concepts from Piaget's theory with newer concepts from cognitive psychology and differential psychology.\n\nInitially, neo-Piagetian theorists explained cognitive growth along Piagetian stages by invoking information processing capacity as the cause of both development from the one stage to the next and individual differences in developmental rate. Juan Pascual-Leone was the first to advance this approach.\n\nPascual-Leone argued that human thought is organized in two levels.\n\nPascual-Leone proposed that the increase of the number of mental units that one can represent simultaneously makes the persons able to handle more complex concepts. For instance, one needs to be able to hold two mental units in mind to be able to decide if one number is bigger than another number. To be able to add them, the person needs to be able to hold three units, that is, the two numbers plus the arithmetic operation to be applied, such as addition or subtraction. To be able to understand proportionality, one must be able to keep in mind five units, that is the two pairs of numbers to be compared and their relation.\n\nAccording to Pascual-Leone, mental power is equal to 1 scheme or unit of information at the age of 2–3 years and it increases by one unit every second year until it reaches its maximum of 7 units at the age 15 years. He claimed that the classical Piaget's stages of pre-operational, intuitive, early concrete, late concrete, transitional from concrete to formal, early formal, and late formal thought require a mental power of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 mental units, respectively. Having a lesser degree of mental power than required by a task makes the solution of this task impossible, because the necessary relations cannot be represented and computed. Thus, each increase in mental power with age opens the way for the construction of concepts and skills up to the new level of capacity. Falling short or exceeding the mental power that is typical of a given age results in slower or faster rates of development, respectively.\n\nBased on Pascual-Leone, several other researchers advanced alternative models of capacity development. Robbie Case rejected the idea that changes in processing capacity can be described as a progression along Pascual-Leone's single line of development. Instead, he maintained that processing capacity development recycles over a succession of four main stages and that each of them is characterized by a different kind of mental structures. These stages correspond to Piaget's main stages of sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational and formal operational thought. Each of these four stages involves its own \"executive control structures\" that are defined by the medium of representation and the type of relations that are possible at the stage.\n\nExecutive control structures enable the person to:\n\nCase maintained that there are four types of executive control structures:\n\nCase also argued that development within each of these four main stages evolves along the same sequence of the following four levels of complexity (thus, structures of increasing complexity can be handled at each of the four levels):\n\nAccording to Case, this expansion of the capacity of short-term storage space is caused by increasing operational efficiency. That is, the command of the operations that define each kind of executive control structures improves, thereby freeing space for the representation of goals and objectives. For example, counting becomes faster with age enabling children to keep more numbers in mind.\n\nSuccessive stages are not unrelated, however. That is, the final level of a given stage is at the same time the first level of the following stage. For instance, when the concept of number is well established at the final level of elaborated coordination of the relational stage it enables children to view numbers as related to each other and this is equivalent to the first level of operational consolidation of the following dimensional stage. Thus, when the structures of a given stage reach a given level of complexity (which corresponds to the level of elaborated coordination) a new mental structure is created and the cycle starts up from the beginning.\n\nCase recognized that variations may occur in the organization and development of different domains, due to differences in how meaning is organized in each of the domains. Specifically, Case recognized that there are central conceptual structures. These are \"networks of semantic notes and relations that have an extremely broad (but not system-wide) domain of application and that are central to children's functioning in that domain.\"\n\nCase and his colleagues identified central conceptual structures for quantities, space, social behavior, narrative, music, and motor behavior. Each of these structures is supposed to involve a set of core processes and principles which serve to organize a broad array of situations; for example, the concept of more and less for quantities, adjacency and inclusion relationships for space, and actions and intentions for social behavior. Thus, these are very broad structures in which many executive control structures may be constructed, relative to an individual's experiences and needs.\n\nFor example, in the central conceptual structure that organizes quantities, executive control structures to solve arithmetic problems, to operate balance beams, to represent home locations according to their street address etc., may be constructed. In short, central conceptual structures function as frames and they provide the basic guiding principles and raw conceptual material for the construction of more locally focused concepts and action plans, when the need for them arises.\n\nLearning the core elements of a central conceptual structure opens the way for fast acquisition of a wide array of executive control structures, although this does not generalize to other conceptual structures. It remains limited within the one affected, indicating that there may be variations both within and across individuals in the executive control structures that can be constructed within each central conceptual structure. These variations depend on the environmental support provided to each structure and on the individual's particular preferences and involvement.\n\nGraeme S. Halford raised a number of objections regarding Case's definition of working memory capacity and its role in cognitive growth. The main objection is that different persons may represent the same problem differently and thus they may analyze the goals and objectives of the problem differently. Therefore, mental capacity cannot be specified in reference to executive functions. Halford proposed an alternative way to analyze the processing demands of problems that is supposed to explain the most crucial component of understanding and problem solving. This is the grasp of the network of relations that minimally and fully define a particular concept or problem.\n\nAccording to Halford, this grasp is built through structure mapping. Structure mapping is analogical reasoning that people use to give meaning to problems by translating the givens of a problem into a representation or mental model that they already have and which allows them to understand the problem. The structure mappings that can be constructed depend upon the relational complexity of the structures they involve. The relational complexity of structures depends on the number of entities or the number of dimensions that are involved in the structure. The processing load of a task corresponds to the number of dimensions, which must be simultaneously represented, if their relations are to be understood.\n\nFor example, to understand any comparison between two entities (e.g., \"larger than\", \"better than\", etc.) one must be able to represent two entities and one relation between them. To understand a transitive relation one must be able to represent at least three entities (e.g., objects A, B, and C) and two relations (e.g., A is taller than B; C is shorter than B); otherwise it would not be possible to mentally arrange the entities in the right order that would reveal the relations between all entities involved.\n\nHalford identified four levels of dimensionality.\n\nThe four levels of structure mappings are thought to be attainable at the age of 1, 3, 5, and 10 years, respectively, and they correspond, in the theory of cognitive development of Piaget, to the sensorimotor, the preoperational, the concrete operational, and the formal operational, or Case's sensorimotor, interrelational, dimensional, and vectorial stage, respectively.\n\nKurt W. Fischer advanced a theory that integrates Piaget's notion of stages in cognitive development with notions from learning theory and skill construction as explained by the cognitive psychology of the 1960s.\n\nFischer's conception of the stages of cognitive development is very similar to that of Case. That is, he describes four major stages or tiers which coincide by and large with Case's major stages. Thinking at each of the tiers operates with a different type of representation.\n\nLike Case, Fischer argues that development within each major stage recycles over the same sequence of four structurally identical levels.\n\nHowever, Fischer's theory differs from the other neo-Piagetian theories in a number of respects. One of them is in the way it explains cognitive change. Although Fischer does not deny the operation of information processing constrains on development, he emphasizes the environmental and social rather than individual factors as causes of development. To explain developmental change he borrowed two classic notions from Lev Vygotsky: internalization and the zone of proximal development.\n\n\"Internalization\" refers to the processes that enable children to reconstruct and absorb the products of their observations and interactions in a way that makes them their own. That is, it is a process which transforms external, alien skills and concepts into internal, integral ones.\n\nThe \"zone of proximal development\" is Vygotsky's idea that at any age the child's potential for understanding and problem solving is not identical to his actual understanding and problem solving ability. Potential ability is always greater than actual ability: the zone of proximal development refers to the range of possibilities that exist between the actual and the potential. Structured interaction (scaffolding) and internalization are the processes that gradually allow potential (for understanding and problem solving) to become actual (concepts and skills).\n\nFischer argued that variations in the development and functioning of different mental skills and functions from the one domain to the other may be the rule rather than the exception. In his opinion these variations are to be attributed to differences in the experience that individuals have with different domains and also to differences in the support that they receive when interacting with the various domains. In addition, he posited that an individual's true level, which functions as a kind of ceiling for all domains, is the level of his potential, which can only be determined under conditions of maximum familiarity and scaffolding.\n\nMichael Commons simplified and enhanced Piaget's developmental theory and offers a standard method of examining the universal pattern of development, named the model of hierarchical complexity (MHC). The model assesses a single measure of difficulty of inferred tasks across domains.\n\nThe MHC is a non-mentalistic model of developmental stages at which an individual is performing while completing a task. It specifies 16 orders of hierarchical complexity and their corresponding stages. Instead of attributing behavioral changes across a person's age to the development of mental structures or schema, this model posits that task sequences of task behaviors form hierarchies that become increasingly complex. The MHC separates the task from the performance. The participant's performance on a task of a given order of hierarchical complexity represents the developmental stage. Because less hierarchically complex tasks must be completed and practiced before more complex tasks can be acquired, this accounts for the developmental changes seen, for example, in individual persons' performance of more hierarchically complex tasks.\n\nWithin an order of hierarchical complexity, a person must count before they add (subtask 1). Note that this only requires one previous task action be acquired. They must add (subtask 2) before they multiply (subtask 3). The concrete order of hierarchical complexity requires the two primary order addition and primary order multiplication to be coordinated as with long multiplication or distributivity. Furthermore, previous theories of stage have confounded the stimulus and response in assessing stage by simply scoring responses and ignoring the task or stimulus.\n\nIn the MHC, there are three axioms for an order to meet in order for the higher order task to coordinate the next lower order task. Axioms are rules that are followed to determine how the MHC orders actions to form a hierarchy. These axioms are:\nThese axioms make it possible for the model's application to meet real world requirements, including the empirical and analytic. Arbitrary organization of lower order of complexity actions, possible in the Piagetian theory, despite the hierarchical definition structure, leaves the functional correlates of the interrelationships of tasks of differential complexity formulations ill-defined. Moreover, the model is consistent with the other neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development. According to these theories, progression to higher stages or levels of cognitive development is caused by increases in processing efficiency and working memory capacity. That is, higher-order stages place increasingly higher demands on these functions of information processing, so that their order of appearance reflects the information processing possibilities at successive ages.\n\nThere are some commonalities between the Piagetian and Commons' notions of stage and many more things that are different. In both, one finds:\n\nWhat Commons et al. (Commons, Trudeau, Stein, Richards, & Krause 1998; Commons & Pekker, 2008; Commons, McCalla, et al., in press) have added includes:\n\nThe five highest stages in the MHC are not represented in Piaget's model. They are systematic, metasystematic, paradigmatic, crossparadigmatic and metacrossparadigmatic. Only about 20% of the people perform at the systematic stage 11 without support. Even fewer (1.5%) of individuals perform at stages above the systematic stage. In the stages beyond formal, more complex behaviors characterize multiple system models.\n\nSome adults are said to develop alternatives to, and perspectives on, formal stage actions. They use formal actions within a \"higher\" system of actions and transcend the limitations of formal stage actions. In any case, these are all ways in which these theories argue for and present converging evidence that some adults are using forms of reasoning that are more complex than formal with which Piaget's model ended. However, these new innovations cannot exactly be labelled as postformal thought.\n\nThe models above do not systematically elaborate on the differences between domains, the role of self-awareness in development, and the role of other aspects of processing efficiency, such as speed of processing and cognitive control. In the theory proposed by Andreas Demetriou, with his colleagues, all of these factors are systematically studied.\n\nAccording to Demetriou's theory, the human mind is organized in three functional levels. The first is the level of \"processing potentials\" which involves \"information processing mechanisms\" underlying the ability to attend to, select, represent, and operate on information. The other two of levels involve knowing processes, one oriented to the environment and another oriented to the self. This model is graphically depicted in Figure 1.\nMental functioning at any moment occurs under the constraints of the processing potentials that are available at a given age. Processing potentials are specified in terms of three dimensions: speed of processing, control of processing, and representational capacity.\n\n\"Speed of processing\" refers to the maximum speed at which a given mental act may be efficiently executed. It is measured in reference to the reaction time to very simple tasks, such as the time needed to recognize an object.\n\n\"Control of processing\" involves executive functions that enable the person to keep the mind focused on a goal, protect attention of being captured by irrelevant stimuli, timely shift focus to other relevant information if required, and inhibit irrelevant or premature responses, so that a strategic plan of action can be made and sustained. Reaction time to situations where one must choose between two or more alternatives is one measure of control of processing. Stroop effect tasks are good measures of control of processing.\n\n\"Representational capacity\" refers to the various aspects of mental power or working memory mentioned above.\n\nThe level oriented to the environment includes representational and understanding processes and functions that specialize in the representation and processing of information coming from different domains of the environment. Six such environment-oriented systems are described:\n\n\nThe domain specificity of these systems implies that the mental processes differ from the one system to the other. Compare, for instance, arithmetic operations in the quantitative system with mental rotation in the spatial system. The first require the thinker to relate quantities; the other require the transformation of the orientation of an object in space. Moreover, the different systems require different kinds of symbols to represent and operate on their objects. These differences make it difficult to equate the concepts and operations across the various systems in the mental load they impose on representational capacity, as the models above assume. Case also recognized that concepts and executive control structures differ across domains in the semantic networks that they involve. Case and Demetriou worked together to unify their analysis of domains. They suggested that Demetriou's domains may be specified in terms of Case's central conceptual structures.\n\nThe third level includes functions and processes oriented to monitoring, representing, and regulating the environment-oriented systems. The input to this level is information arising from the functioning of processing potentials and the environment-oriented systems, for example, sensations, feelings, and conceptions caused by mental activity. The term \"hypercognition\" was used to refer to this level and denote the effects that it exerts on the other two levels of the mind. Hypercognition involves two central functions, namely \"working hypercognition\" and \"long-term hypercognition\".\n\nWorking hypercognition is a strong directive-executive function that is responsible for setting and pursuing mental and behavioral goals until they are attained. This function involves processes enabling the person to: (1) set mental and behavioral goals; (2) plan their attainment; (3) evaluate each step's processing demands vis-à-vis the available potentials, knowledge, skills and strategies; (4) monitor planned activities vis-à-vis the goals; and (5) evaluate the outcome attained. These processes operate recursively in such a way that goals and subgoals may be renewed according to the online evaluation of the system's distance from its ultimate objective. These regulatory functions operate under the current structural constraints of the mind that define the current processing potentials. Recent research suggests that these processes participate in general intelligence together with processing potentials and the general inferential processes used by the specialized thought domains described above.\n\nConsciousness is an integral part of the hypercognitive system. The very process of setting mental goals, planning their attainment, monitoring action vis-à-vis both the goals and the plans, and regulating real or mental action requires a system that can remember and review and therefore know itself. Therefore, conscious awareness and all ensuing functions, such as a self-concept (i.e., awareness of one's own mental characteristics, functions, and mental states) and a theory of mind (i.e., awareness of others' mental functions and states) are part of the very construction of the system.\n\nIn fact, long-term hypercognition gradually builds maps or models of mental functions which are continuously updated. These maps are generally accurate representations of the actual organization of cognitive processes in the domains mentioned above. When needed, they can be used to guide problem solving and understanding in the future. Optimum performance at any time depends on the interaction between actual problem solving processes specific to a domain and our representations of them. The interaction between the two levels of mind ensures flexibility of behavior, because the self-oriented level provides the possibility for representing alternative environment-oriented representations and actions and thus it provides the possibility for planning.\n\nAll of the processes mentioned above develop systematically with age.\n\n\"Speed of processing\" increases systematically from early childhood to middle age and it then starts to decrease again. For instance, to recognize a very simple object takes about 750 milliseconds at the age of 6 years and only about 450 milliseconds in early adulthood.\n\n\"Control of processing\" and executive control also become more efficient and capable of allowing the person to focus on more complex information, hold attention for longer periods of time, and alternate between increasingly larger stacks of stimuli and responses while filtering out irrelevant information. For instance, to recognize a particular stimulus among conflicting information may take about 2000 milliseconds at the age of 6 years and only about 750 milliseconds in early adulthood.\n\nAll components of working memory (e.g., executive functions, numerical, phonological and visuospatial storage) increase with age. However, the exact capacity of working memory varies greatly depending upon the nature of information. For example, in the spatial domain, they may vary from 3 units at the age of six to 5 units at the age of 12 years. In the domain of mathematical thought, they may vary from about 2 to about 4 units in the same age period. If executive operations are required, the capacity is extensively limited, varying from about 1 unit at 6 to about 3 units at 12 years of age. Demetriou proposed the functional shift model to account for these data.\n\nDemetriou's model presumes that when the mental units of a given level reach a maximum degree of complexity, the mind tends to reorganize these units at a higher level of representation or integration so as to make them more manageable. Having created a new mental unit, the mind prefers to work with this rather than the previous units due to its functional advantages. An example in the verbal domain would be the shift from words to sentences and in the quantitative domain from natural numbers to algebraic representations of numerical relations. The functional shift models explains how new units are created leading to stage change in the fashion described by Case and Halford.\n\nThe specialized domains develop through the life span both in terms of general trends and in terms of the typical characteristics of each domain. In the age span from birth to middle adolescence, the changes are faster in all of the domains. With development, thought in each of the domains becomes able to deal with increasingly more representations. Representations become increasingly interconnected with each other and they acquire their meaning from their interrelations rather than simply their relations with concrete objects. As a result, concepts in each of the domains become increasingly defined in reference to rules and general principles bridging more local concepts and creating new, broader, and more abstract concepts. Understanding and problem solving in each of the domains evolve from global and less integrated to differentiated, but better integrated, mental operations. As a result, planning and operation from alternatives becomes increasingly part of the person's functioning, as well as the increasing ability to efficiently monitor the problem solving process. This offers flexibility in cognitive functioning and problem solving across the whole spectrum of specialized domains.\n\nIn the hypercognitive system, self-awareness and self-regulation, that is, the ability to regulate one's own cognitive activity, develop systematically with age. Self-awareness of cognitive processes becomes more accurate and shifts from the external and superficial characteristics of problems (e.g., this is about numbers and this is about pictures) to the cognitive processes involved (e.g., the one requires addition and the other requires mental rotation). Moreover, developing self-representations:\n\nThe knowledge available at each phase defines the kind of self-regulation that can be achieved. Thus, self-regulation becomes increasingly focused, refined, efficient, and strategic. Practically this implies that our information processing capabilities come under increasing a priori control of our long-term hypercognitive maps and our self-definitions. As we move into middle age, intellectual development gradually shifts from the dominance of systems that are oriented to the processing of the environment (such as spatial and propositional reasoning) to systems that require social support and self-understanding and management (social understanding). Thus, the transition to mature adulthood makes persons intellectually stronger and more self-aware of their strengths.\n\nThere are strong developmental relations between the various processes, such that changes at any level of organization of the mind open the way for changes in other levels. Specifically, changes in speed of processing open the way for changes in the various forms of control of processing. These, in turn, open the way for the enhancement of working memory capacity, which subsequently opens the way for development in inferential processes, and the development of the various specialized domains through the reorganization of domain-specific skills, strategies, and knowledge and the acquisition of new ones.\n\nThere are top-down effects as well. That is, general inference patterns, such as implication (\"if ... then\" inferences), or disjunction (\"either ... or\" inferences), are constructed by mapping domain-specific inference patterns onto each other through the hypercognitive process of metarepresentation. Metarepresentation is the primary top-down mechanism of cognitive change which looks for, codifies, and typifies similarities between mental experiences (past or present) to enhance understanding and problem-solving efficiency. In logical terms, metarepresentation is analogical reasoning applied to mental experiences or operations, rather than to representations of environmental stimuli. For example, \"if ... then\" sentences are heard over many different occasions in everyday language: \"if\" you are a good child \"then\" I will give you a toy; \"if\" it rains and you stay out \"then\" you become wet; \"if\" the glass falls on the floor \"then\" it breaks in pieces; etc. When a child realizes that the sequencing of the \"if ... then\" connectives in language is associated with situations in which the event or thing specified by \"if\" always comes first and it leads to the event or thing specified by \"then\", this child is actually formulating the inference schema of implication. With development, the schema becomes a reasoning frame for predictions and interpretations of actual events or conversations about them.\n\nRecently, it has been suggested that the development of all systems is concerted in four reconceptualization cycles. These are the cycles of episodic representations (birth to 2 years), representations (2–6 years), rule-based concepts (6–11 years), and principle-based concepts (11–16 years). Each cycle evolves in two phases: The phase of production of new mental units in the first half and their alignment in the second half. This sequence relates with changes in processing speed and working memory in overlapping cycles such that relations with speed are high in the production phases and relations with WM are high in the alignment phases over all cycles. Reconceptualization is self-propelled because abstraction, alignment, and self-awareness about the cycle's mental representations and mental processes continuously generate new mental content expressed in representations of increasing inclusiveness and resolution. Each cycle culminates into insight about the cycle's representations and underlying inferential processes that is expressed into executive programs of increasing flexibility. Learning addressed to this insight accelerates the course of reconceptualization. Individual differences in intellectual growth are related to both the ability to gain insight about mental processes and interaction with different specialized domains (e.g., categorical, quantitative, spatial cognition, etc.).\n\nBrain research shows that some general aspects of the brain, such as myelination, plasticity, and connectivity of neurons, are related to some dimensions of general intelligence, such as speed of processing and learning efficiency. Moreover, there are brain regions, located mainly in the frontal and parietal cortex that subserve functions that are central to all cognitive processing, such as executive control, and working memory. Also, there are many neural networks that specialize in the representation of different types of information such as verbal (temporal lobe of the brain), spatial (occipital lobe of the brain) or quantitative information (parietal lobe of the brain).\n\nSeveral aspects of neural development are related to cognitive development. For example, increases in the myelination of neuronal axons, which protect the transmission of electrical signalling along the axons from leakage, are related to changes in general processing efficiency. This, in turn, enhances the capacity of working memory, thereby facilitating transition across the stages of cognitive development.\n\nChanges within stages of cognitive development are associated with improvements in neuronal connectivity within brain regions whereas transitions across stages are associated with improvements in connectivity between brain regions. Electroencephalographic coherency patterns throughout childhood and adolescence develop in growth spurts that are nearly identical to the time frame of the developmental cycles described above.\n\nChanges in the efficiency of the brain to represent information and allocate mental functions to brain networks (such as metabolic activity and cortical specialization and pruning) may occur mainly at the early phase of each cycle that are associated with an increase in the speed-intelligence relations (2–3, 6–7, and 11–13 years). Changes in connectivity that may relate to mapping concepts onto each other and meta-represent them into new concepts occur at second phase of each cycle associated with an increase in the working memory–intelligence relations.\n\nIn recent years, there has been an increasing interest in theories and methods that show promise for capturing and modeling the regularities underlying multiple interacting and changing processes. Dynamic systems theory is one of them. Many theorists, including Case, Demetriou, and Fischer, used dynamic systems modeling to investigate and explore the dynamic relations between cognitive processes during development.\n\nWhen multiple processes interact in complex ways, they very often appear to behave unsystematically and unpredictably. In fact, however, they are interconnected in systematic ways, such that the condition of one process at a given point of time \"t\" (for example, speed of processing) is responsible for the condition of another process (for example working memory), at a next point of time \"t\" + 1, and together they determine the condition of a third process (for example thought), at a time \"t\" + 2, which then influences the conditions of the other two processes at a time \"t\" + 3, etc. Dynamic systems theory can reveal and model the dynamic relationships among different processes and specify the forms of development that result from different types of interaction among processes. The aim is to explain the order and systematicity that exist beneath a surface of apparent disorder or \"chaos\".\n\nPaul van Geert was the first to show the promise that dynamic systems theory holds for the understanding of cognitive development. Van Geert assumed that the basic growth model is the so-called \"logistic growth model\", which suggests that the development of mental processes follows an S-like pattern of change. That is, at the beginning, change is very slow and hardly noticeable; after a given point in time, however, it occurs very rapidly so that the process or ability spurts to a much higher level in a relatively short period of time; finally, as this process approaches its end state, change decelerates until it stabilizes.\n\nAccording to van Geert, logistic growth is a function of three parameters: the present level, the rate of change, and a limit on the level that can be reached that depends on the available resources for the functioning of the process under consideration.\n\nPascual-Leone, Case, and Halford attempt to explain development along the sequence of Piagetian stages and substages. Pascual-Leone aligned this sequence with a single line of development of mental power that goes from one to seven mental units. Case suggested that each of four main stages involves different kinds of mental structures and he specified the mental load of the successive levels or substages of complexity within each of the main stages. He said that there may be different central conceptual structures within each level of executive control structures that differ between each other in reference to the concepts and semantic relations involved. Halford attempted to specify the cognitive load of the mental structure that is typical of each of the main stages. Fischer stressed the importance of skill construction processes in building stage-like constructs and he emphasized the role of the environment and social support in skill construction. Commons offered a description of the successive levels of cognitive development while allowing for the explicit reference to the particularities of concepts and operations specific to each of the domains. Demetriou integrated into his theory the constructs of speed of processing and control of processing, and he formulated the functional shift model, which unifies Pascual-Leone's notion of underlying common dimension of capacity development with the notion of qualitative changes in mental structure as development progresses along this dimension. Dynamic systems theory can model how different processes interact dynamically when developmental hierarachies are built.\n\nMany scholars argue that fluid intelligence, that is the general mechanisms underlying learning, problem solving, and the handling of novelty, depends on these developmental processes. Changes in these very mechanisms seem able to explain, to a considerable extent, the changes in the quality of understanding and problem solving at successive age levels.\n\nAn overarching definition of intelligence can be as follows: The more mentally efficient (that is, the faster and more focused on goal), capable (that is, the more information one can hold in mind at a given moment), foresighted (that is, the more clearly one can specify his goals and plan how to achieve them), and flexible (that is, the more one can introduce variations in the concepts and mental operations one already possesses) a person is, the more intelligent (both in regard to other individuals and in regard to a general developmental hierarchy) this person is.\n\nDifferences between persons in IQ or in the rate of development result, additively, from differences in all of the processes modeled in the neo-Piagetian theories. Thus, the neo-Piagetian theories differ from Arthur Jensen's theory of general intelligence in that they recognize the importance of specialized domains in the human mind, which are underestimated in Jensen's theory. On the other hand, by recognizing the role of general processes and showing how specialized competences are constrained by them, the neo-Piagetian theories differ from Howard Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences, which underestimates the operation of common processes.\n\nEducation and the psychology of cognitive development converge on a number of crucial assumptions. First, the psychology of cognitive development defines human cognitive competence at successive phases of development. That is, it specifies what aspects of the world can be understood at different ages, what kinds of concepts can be constructed, and what types of problems can be solved. Education aims to help students acquire knowledge and develop skills which are compatible with their understanding and problem-solving capabilities at different ages. Thus, knowing the students' level on a developmental sequence provides information on the kind and level of knowledge they can assimilate, which, in turn, can be used as a frame for organizing the subject matter to be taught at different school grades. This is the reason why Piaget's theory of cognitive development was so influential for education, especially mathematics and science education.\n\nIn the 60s and the 70s, school curricula were designed to implement Piaget's ideas in the classroom. For example, in mathematics, teaching must build on the stage sequence of mathematical understanding. Thus, in preschool and early primary (elementary) school, teaching must focus on building the concept of numbers, because concepts are still unstable and uncoordinated. In the late primary school years operations on numbers must be mastered because concrete operational thought provides the mental background for this. In adolescence the relations between numbers and algebra can be taught, because formal operational thought allows for conception and manipulation of abstract and multidimensional concepts. In science teaching, early primary education should familiarize the children with properties of the natural world, late primary education should lead the children to practice exploration and master basic concepts such as space, area, time, weight, volume, etc., and, in adolescence, hypothesis testing, controlled experimentation, and abstract concepts, such as energy, inertia, etc., can be taught.\n\nThe neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development suggest that in addition to the concerns above, sequencing of concepts and skills in teaching must take account of the processing and working memory capacities that characterize successive age levels. In other words, the overall structure of the curriculum across time, in any field, must reflect the developmental processing and representational possibilities of the students as specified by all of the theories summarized above. This is necessary because when understanding of the concepts to be taught at a given age requires more than the available capacity, the necessary relations cannot be worked out by the student. In fact, Demetriou has shown that speed of processing and working memory are excellent predictors of school performance.\n\nEffective teaching methods have to enable the student to move from a lower to a higher level of understanding or abandon less efficient skills for more efficient ones. Therefore, knowledge of change mechanisms can be used as a basis for designing instructional interventions that will be both subject- and age-appropriate. Comparison of past to present knowledge, reflection on actual or mental actions vis-à-vis alternative solutions to problems, tagging new concepts or solutions to symbols that help one recall and mentally manipulate them, are just a few examples of how mechanisms of cognitive development may be used to facilitate learning. For example, to support metarepresentation and facilitate the emergence of general reasoning patterns from domain specific processing, teaching must continually raise awareness in students of what may be abstracted from any particular domain-specific learning. The student must be led to become aware of the underlying relations that surpass content differences and of the very mental processes used while handling them (for instance, elaborate on how particular inference schemas, such as implication, operate in different domains).\n\nThe psychology of cognitive development is concerned with individual differences in the organization of cognitive processes and abilities, in their rate of change, and in their mechanisms of change. The principles underlying intra- and inter-individual differences could be educationally useful, because it highlights why the same student is not an equally good learner in different domains, and why different students in the same classroom react to the same instructional materials in different ways.\n\nIdentifying individual differences with regard to the various aspects of cognitive development could be the basis for the development of programs of individualized instruction which may focus on the gifted student or which may be of a remedial nature.\n\n"}

His father's home town was Và village, Yên Đổ commune, Bình Lục district, Hà Nam Province. His father Nguyễn Tông Khởi (1796–1853) was a teacher. His mother was Trần Thị Thoan (1799–1874) and her father was Trần Công Trạc.\n\nNguyễn Thắng studied to become a mandarin (the governing class of Vietnam). His first teacher was Phạm Văn Nghị. Although he was intelligent and knowledgeable, he did not initially fare well in his examinations. In 1864, he passed the Cử nhân degree (or: Hương Cống, Chinese: 鄉貢, the lowest degree of Vietnamese feudal educational system) at first-rate (Masters level) in Hà Nội. One year later, unfortunately, he failed his doctoral examination Hội examination so he went to Hanoi to study at Quốc Tử Giám (National University). \n\nTo instil himself with iron discipline and motivate himself, he changed his given name from Nguyễn Thắng to Nguyễn Khuyến. In the Vietnamese language, Thắng only means success or victory but Khuyến has a stronger meaning implying inspiration or stimulation; Thắng is the result but Khuyến is the way toward the result (Vietnamese people have a tradition named \"Khuyến Học\"- Study Encouragement). After six years of preparation, he passed the Hội Nguyên degree and the Đình Nguyên degree—his doctorate—continuously in only one year in 1871. This was an extraordinary accomplishment rarely seen throughout history, so people gave him an honourable name: \"Tam Nguyên Yên Đổ\" (Yên Đổ's first-rate graduate in three times).\n\nNguyễn Khuyến was a mandarin in the age of the French invasions. History unfolded like the text he wrote in his Đình Nguyên examination twelve years before: \"As a carriage does not come toward because the horses do not want to pull, the political situation does not improve when the people do not want it to. Are there no talents in life? It is completely untrue.\" When patriotic movements such as \"Cần Vương\" (\"Seeking the King\") were extinguished and his dream of \"Trị quốc, bình thiên hạ\" (leading the country, pacifying the world) was not realized, he landed in an impasse. He recognized his powerlessness to change conditions in the country and was deeply aware of the decline of Vietnamese feudalism. He was one of the first Vietnamese people to criticize Vietnamese feudalism as conservative and unrealistic. In 1884, he withdrew from public life and moved back to his home town Yên Đổ to support the Vietnamese resistance against the French enemy. There he found peace in his soul through a simple and tranquil life in the countryside.\n\nThe more adversity he met in his life, the more talented he became in his writing. He was the nexus between classical and modern Vietnamese literature. He was both a prominent lyric poet and an outstanding satirical poet. He reached the peak of Nôm letter's literature. He was the first Vietnamese poet who put opinions about current matters in classical poems. Among his best poems are: \"Group of three poems about Autumn: Fishing in Autumn, Drinking in Autumn, Versing on Autumn\" which express sadness and loneliness and \"Paper Doctor\" which ridicules incapable scholars. In addition, he was one of the few upper-class poets who wrote favourably about poor farmers. Throughout his life he taught his children to show deep gratitude toward farmers: \"Even if you are a scholar, do not forget rice, beans and eggplants.\"\n\nHe died on 5 February 1909 in his hometown Yên Đổ.\n\n"}

Espinas (1844–1922), the French philosopher and sociologist; he was the forerunner of the Polish school of the science of efficient action. The Austro-American school of economics was based on a philosophical science of the same kind.\n\nWith a different spelling, the word was used by the English psychologist Charles Arthur Mercier (in 1911), and proposed by Knight Dunlap to John B. Watson as a better name for his behaviorism. Watson rejected it. But the Chinese physiologist of behavior, Zing-Yang Kuo (b. 1898) adopted the term in 1935. It was also used by William McDougall (in 1928 and later).\n\nPreviously the word \"praxiology\", with the meaning Espinas gave to it, was used by Tadeusz Kotarbiński (in 1923). Several economists, such as the Ukrainian, Eugene Slutsky (1926) used it in his attempt to base economics on a theory of action. It was also used by Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises (1933), Russian Marxist Nikolai Bukharin (1888–1938) during the Second International Congress of History of Science and Technology in London (in 1931), and Polish scholar Oscar Lange (1904–1965) in 1959, and later.\n\nThe Italian philosopher, Carmelo Ottaviano, was using the Italianised version, \"prassiologia\", in his treatises starting from 1935, but in his own way, as a theory of politics. After the Second World War the use of the term \"praxeology\" spread widely. After the emigration of Mises to America his pupil Murray Rothbard defended the praxeological approach. A revival of Espinas's approach in France was revealed in the works of Pierre Massé (1946), the eminent cybernetician, Georges Théodule Guilbaud (1953), the Belgian logician, Leo Apostel (1957), the cybernetician, Anatol Rapoport (1962), Henry Pierron, psychologist and lexicographer (1957), François Perroux, economist (1957), the social psychologist, Robert Daval (1963), the well-known sociologist, Raymond Aron (1963) and the methodologists, Abraham Antoine Moles and Roland Caude (1965).\n\nUnder the influence of Tadeusz Kotarbiński, praxeology flourished in Poland. A special \"Centre of Praxeology\" (\"Zaklad Prakseologiczny\") was created under the organizational guidance of the Polish Academy of Sciences, with its own periodical (from 1962), called at first \"Materiały Prakseologiczne\" (\"Praxeological Papers\"), and then abbreviated to \"Prakseologia\". It published hundreds of papers by different authors, and the materials for a special vocabulary edited by Professor Tadeusz Pszczolowski, the leading praxeologist of the younger generation. A sweeping survey of the praxeological approach is to be found in the paper by the French statistician Micheline Petruszewycz, \"A propos de la praxéologie\".\n\nLudwig von Mises was influenced by several theories in forming his work on praxeology, including Immanuel Kant's works, Max Weber's work on methodological individualism, and Carl Menger's development of the subjective theory of value.\n\nAustrian economics relies heavily on praxeology in the development of its economic theories. Ludwig von Mises considered economics to be a sub-discipline of praxeology. Austrian School economists continue to use praxeology and deduction, rather than empirical studies, to determine economic principles. According to its theorists, with the action axiom as the starting point, it is possible to draw conclusions about human behavior that are both objective and universal. For example, the notion that humans engage in acts of choice implies that they have preferences, and this must be true for anyone who exhibits intentional behavior.\n\nAdvocates of praxeology also say that it provides insights for the field of ethics.\n\nIn 1951, Murray Rothbard divided the subfields of praxeology as follows:\nAt the time, topics C, D, and E remained open research problems.\n\nThomas Mayer has argued that, because praxeology rejects positivism and empiricism in the development of theories, it constitutes nothing less than a rejection of the scientific method. For Mayer, this invalidates the methodologies of the Austrian school of economics. Austrians argue that that empirical data itself is insufficient to describe economics; that consequently empirical data cannot falsify economic theory; that logical positivism cannot predict or explain human action; and that the methodological requirements of logical positivism are impossible to obtain for economic questions. Ludwig von Mises in particular argued against empiricist approaches to the social sciences in general, because human events are unique and \"unrepeatable,\" whereas scientific experiments are necessarily reducible.\n\nHowever, economist Antony Davies argues that because statistical tests are predicated on the independent development of theory, some form of praxeology is essential for model selection; conversely, the praxeology can illustrate surprising philosophical consequences of economic models.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2338263", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2338263", "title": "Redundancy theory of truth", "text": "Redundancy theory of truth\n\nAccording to the redundancy theory of truth (or the disquotational theory of truth), asserting that a statement is true is completely equivalent to asserting the statement itself. For example, asserting the sentence \" 'Snow is white' is true\" is equivalent to asserting the sentence \"Snow is white\". Redundancy theorists infer from this premise that truth is a redundant concept, in other words, that \"truth\" is a mere word that is conventional to use in certain contexts of discourse but not a word that points to anything in reality. The theory is commonly attributed to Frank P. Ramsey, who argued that the use of words like \"fact\" and \"truth\" was nothing but a roundabout way of asserting a proposition, and that treating these words as separate problems in isolation from judgment was merely a \"linguistic muddle\", though there remains some debate as to the correct interpretation of his position (Le Morvan 2004).\n\nRedundancy theorists begin by inquiring into the function of the predicate \"__is true\" in sentences like \" 'Snow is white' is true\". They reason that asserting the longer sentence is equivalent to asserting the shorter sentence \"Snow is white\". From this they infer that nothing is added to the \"assertion\" of the sentence \"Snow is white\" by quoting it, appending the predicate \"__is true\", and then asserting the result.\n\nMost predicates attribute properties to their subjects, but the redundancy theory denies that the predicate \"is true\" does so. Instead, it treats the predicate \"is true\" as empty, adding nothing to an assertion except to convert its use to its mention. That is, the predicate \"___is true\" merely asserts the proposition contained in the sentential clause to which it is applied but does not ascribe any additional property to that proposition or sentence, and in Ramsey's British lexicon, \"is true\" is redundant.\n\nThe redundancy theory of truth is a deflationary theory of truth.\n\nGottlob Frege was probably the first philosophical logician to express something very close to the idea that the predicate \"is true\" does not express anything above and beyond the statement to which it is attributed. \n\nIt is worthy of notice that the sentence \"I smell the scent of violets\" has the same content as the sentence \"it is true that I smell the scent of violets\". So it seems, then, that nothing is added to the thought by my ascribing to it the property of truth. (Frege, G., 1918. \"Thoughts\", in his \"Logical Investigations\", Oxford: Blackwell, 1977)\nRamsey's paper \"Facts and Propositions\" (1927) is frequently cited as the precipitating contribution in the current of thought that came to be called the redundancy theory of truth.\nBut before we proceed further with the analysis of judgment, it is necessary to say something about truth and falsehood, in order to show that there is really no separate problem of truth but merely a linguistic muddle. (p. 38).\n\nStarting in a context of discussion that is concerned with analyzing judgment, in effect, the matter of asserting or denying propositions, Ramsey turns to the question of truth and falsehood, and suggests that these words add nothing of substance to the analysis of judgment already in progress.\n\nTruth and falsity are ascribed primarily to propositions. The proposition to which they are ascribed may be either explicitly given or described.\n\nSuppose first that it is explicitly given; then it is evident that 'It is true that Caesar was murdered' means no more than that Caesar was murdered, and 'It is false that Caesar was murdered' means that Caesar was not murdered.\nIn the course of his argument, Ramsey observes that there are many different ways of asserting what is really the same proposition, at least, so far as the abstract logical meanings of sentences are concerned. In his first examples, he uses the verbal forms (1) 'It is true that ___' and (2) 'It is false that ___', for the sake of concreteness filling in the blanks with the sentential clause 'Caesar was murdered'. He says that assertions mediated by these forms are not distinct in meaning from the corresponding direct assertions.\nThey are phrases we sometimes use for emphasis or for stylistic reasons, or to indicate the position occupied by the statement in our argument.\n\nSo also we can say 'It is a fact that he was murdered' or 'That he was murdered is contrary to fact'.\nIn the same context and by the same token, Ramsey cites the verbal forms (3) 'It is a fact that ___' and (4) '___ is contrary to fact' as further examples of dispensable, otiose, redundant, or purely stylistic verbiage.\nIn the second case in which the proposition is described and not given explicitly we have perhaps more of a problem, for we get statements from which we cannot in ordinary language eliminate the words 'true' and 'false'.\nThe strategy of Ramsey's argument is to demonstrate that certain figures of speech — those in which truth and falsehood seem to figure as real properties of propositions, or as logical values that constitute real objects, however abstract, of discussion and thought — can always be eliminated in favor of paraphrases that do not reify \"truth\" and \"falsehood\" as nouns, nor even use \"true\" and \"false\" as adjectives. The plausibility of this tactic going through is fairly evident in the case of verbal forms that introduce direct or indirect quotations. But the feasibility of the conversion is less clear in the case of propositions whose contents are not given in full, but only by indirect or partial description.\n\nThus if I say 'He is always right', I mean that the propositions he asserts are always true, and there does not seem to be any way of expressing this without using the word 'true'.\n\nBut suppose we put it thus 'For all \"p\", if he asserts \"p\", \"p\" is true', then we see that the propositional function \"p\" is true is simply the same as \"p\", as e.g. its value 'Caesar was murdered is true' is the same as 'Caesar was murdered'.\nThe type of \"propositional function\" that Ramsey is referring to here is a function that takes a proposition as input and gives a proposition as output. In this case, the propositional function of interest is one that takes any proposition \"p\" and returns a proposition of the form \"'p\" is true'.\nWe have in English to add 'is true' to give the sentence a verb, forgetting that ' \"p\" ' already contains a (variable) verb.\n\nThis may be made clearer by supposing for a moment that only one form of proposition is in question, say the relational form \"aRb\"; then 'He is always right' could be expressed by 'For all \"a\", \"R\", \"b\", if he asserts \"aRb\", then \"aRb\" ', to which 'is true' would be an obviously superfluous addition.\n\nWhen all forms of proposition are included the analysis is more complicated but not essentially different; and it is clear that the problem is not as to the nature of truth and falsehood, but as to the nature of judgment or assertion, for what is difficult to analyse in the above formulation is 'He asserts \"aRb\" '.\n\nIt is, perhaps, also immediately obvious that if we have analysed judgment we have solved the problem of truth; for taking the mental factor in a judgment (which is often itself called a judgment), the truth or falsity of this depends only on what proposition it is that is judged, and what we have to explain is the meaning of saying that the judgment is a judgment that \"a\" has \"R\" to \"b\", i.e. is true if \"aRb\", false if not. We can, if we like, say that it is true if there exists a corresponding fact that \"a\" has \"R\" to \"b\", but this is essentially not an analysis but a periphrasis, for 'The fact that \"a\" has \"R\" to \"b\" exists' is no different from ' \"a\" has \"R\" to \"b\" '.\nA variant of redundancy theory is the disquotational theory, which uses a modified form of Tarski's T-schema: To say that \"'P' is true\" is to say that P. Yet another version of deflationism is the prosentential theory of truth, first developed by Dorothy Grover, Joseph Camp, and Nuel Belnap as an elaboration of Ramsey's claims. They argue that sentences like \"That's true\", when said in response to \"It's raining\", are prosentences (see pro-form), expressions that merely repeat the content of other expressions. In the same way that \"it\" means the same as \"my dog\" in the sentence \"My dog was hungry, so I fed it\", \"That's true\" is supposed to mean the same as \"It's raining\" — if you say the latter and I then say the former. These variations do not necessarily follow Ramsey in asserting that truth is \"not\" a property, but rather can be understood to say that, for instance, the assertion \"P\" may well involve a substantial truth, and the theorists in this case are minimalizing only the redundancy or prosentence involved in the statement such as \"that's true.\"\n\nProponents of pragmatic, constructivist and consensus theories would differ with all of these conclusions, however, and instead assert that the second person making the statement \"that's true\" is actually participating in further verifying, constructing and/or achieving consensus on the proposed truth of the matter — e.g., the proposition that \"it's raining\".\n\nRedundancy theory does not apply to representations that are not analogous to sentences and they do not apply to many other things that are commonly judged to be true or otherwise. Consider the analogy between the sentence \"Snow is white\" and the person Snow White, both of which can be true in a sense. To say \"Snow is white\" is true is to say \"Snow is white\", but to say Snow White is true is not to say Snow White.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "37844424", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37844424", "title": "Reformed scholasticism", "text": "Reformed scholasticism\n\nReformed scholasticism was academic theology practiced by Reformed theologians using the scholastic method during the period of Protestant orthodoxy in the 16th to 18th centuries. While the Reformed often used \"scholastic\" as a term of derision for their Roman Catholic opponents and the content of their theology, most Reformed theologians during this period can properly be called scholastics with respect to the method of theology, though they also used other methods. J. V. Fesko describes scholasticism in this sense as \"a method of doing theology that sets out to achieve theological precision through the exegesis of Scripture, an examination of how doctrine has been historically defined throughout church history, and how doctrine is expounded in contemporary debate.\"\n\nIn the past, scholars described the theology of Protestant scholastics following John Calvin as more rationalistic and philosophical than the more exegetical biblical theology of John Calvin and other early Reformers. This is commonly described as the \"Calvin against the Calvinists\" paradigm. Beginning in the 1980s, Richard Muller and other scholars in the field provided extensive evidence showing both that the early Reformers were deeply influenced by scholasticism and that later Reformed scholasticism was deeply exegetical, using the scholastic method to organize and explicate exegetical theology.\n\nMedieval schools of theology used methods of instruction known as \"lectio-meditatio-quaestio\" and \"disputationes\". In the first method, teachers would first read an authoritative text with some commentary (\"lectio\"), allow students to consider the text silently (\"meditatio\"), and finally the students would ask questions of the teacher to get at the meaning (\"quaestio\").\n\nScholasticism was used by Protestant theologians primarily from 1560 to 1790, which is known as the period of orthodoxy because of the importance of adherence to and defense of the newly written Reformed confessions of faith for these theologians.\n\nJohn Calvin, unlike other early reformers like Martin Luther, was not formally trained in theology but in law. Like many early reformers, however, he was influenced by Renaissance humanism, which led to an interest in the original meaning of biblical and patristic texts and criticism of medieval scholastics for straying from this meaning in favor of philosophical distinctions. Analysis of his work, however, shows that he found himself using some of the same distinctions employed by the scholastics, and some of the criticisms he made of scholastic theology may have actually been based on his own misunderstanding. It is clear, however, that Calvin's use of scholastic theology is different in that, while medieval scholastic theology was solely employed by professional theologians in the schools, rather than by ordinary clergy in preaching, Calvin saw theological teaching as one of the primary objectives of the church and intended his theological works to be used by both preachers and common people. Many of his criticisms of purely speculative scholastic theology may be seen as a consequence of his desire to make theology accessible and useful for the church rather than solely for professional theologians in the schools.\n\nThough scholasticism can already be seen in early Reformed theologians, especially Vermigli and to some degree Calvin, it became much more prevalent during the third and fourth generations of Reformed theologians as a tool to institutionalize the faith by codifying it in confessions and works of systematic theology, as well as to combat the growing sophistication of counter-Reformation polemicists. Reformed confessions of faith such as the Heidelberg Catechism of 1563 (commissioned by Elector Frederick III of the Palatinate), the Belgic Confession of 1561, and the French Gallican Confession of 1559 served as boundary markers for the new faith and as starting places for theological development. The formation of the Genevan Academy in 1559 also enabled Reformed theologians to receive extensive academic training and participate in the wider academic theological discourse. It also served as a model for other Reformed institutions of higher learning throughout Europe. Counter-Reformation attacks from Roman Catholic writers such as Jesuit Cardinal Robert Bellarmine were written in the tradition of scholasticism and needed to be answered in kind. Reformed theologians such as Heidelberg professors Zacharias Ursinus and Girolamo Zanchi adopted the tools of scholastic theology such as the \"quaestio\" method to rigorously exposit the Reformed confessions.\n\nThe early 17th-century Arminian controversy, in which a group known as the Remonstrants argued that predestination to salvation is based on God foreseeing a person's faith, brought about the Synod of Dort, which defined the Reformed doctrine on this matter in greater detail. The 1594 treatise by Huguenot theologian Franciscus Junius \"On True Theology\" was the first Protestant work to distinguish archetypal theology (God's knowledge of himself) and ectypal theology (our knowledge of God based on his condescending revelation to us). This distinction, which has its roots in the medieval Scotist distinction between theology in itself (\"theologia in se\") and our theology (\"theologia nostra\"), limits the degree to which God can be known by sinful man and became very important in later Reformed and Lutheran theology.\n\nThrough the influence of refugees from continental Europe such as Martin Bucer and Peter Martyr Vermigli, late 16th-century English theology was predominately Reformed in nature, though Arminianism gained dominance after 1700. Puritans William Perkins and William Ames were important figures in Reformed English theology during this period. Reformed theologians at the University of St. Andrews assured Calvinism's hold on Scotland.\n\nFollowing the Synod of Dort, which ended in 1619, the Reformed began to give greater definition and detail to their theological system by writing comprehensive systematic theologies. The period was also characterized by intense polemical writing against several groups. The Remonstrants, having been repudiated in the synod of Dort, became an independent movement with their own seminary and dogmatic textbooks, and the Reformed wrote against them with even greater intensity. Reformed polemics were also directed against the increasingly influential Socinians, who denied the Trinity and other traditional Christian doctrines. Early Socinians had already had some influence on the development of Remonstrantism during the early orthodox period. In addition, the rise of Cartesianism provided another target for Reformed scholastics such as Dutch theologian Gisbertus Voetius, who argued that Descartes's philosophical skepticism placed reason above revelation instead of subjecting reason to biblical revelation.\n\nIn the Netherlands, three strands within Reformed orthodoxy may be distinguished, though all of these stayed within the boundaries provided by the Canons of Dort. The \"theologia traditiva\" was most notably represented by Samuel Maresius and Friedrich Spanheim the Elder and Younger. This strain was in many ways aligned with a second strain, the school of Voetius. Unlike the Voetians, however, the followers of the \"theologia traditiva\" were infralapsarian, arguing that God's decree to create men and allow the Fall logically precedes the decree to elect some men to salvation. They also, contrary to the Voetians, approved of some degree of governmental involvement in church affairs, were more lax with respect to Sabbath observance, and were in general more moderate polemicists. Differences between these groups decreased throughout the 17th century, as they positioned themselves against a third strain, the Cocceians. The school of Johannes Cocceius differed from the Voetians and the rest of Reformed scholastic theology in teaching on the relationship of the Old and New Testament. The Cocceians taught that the Sabbath commandment was abrogated in the New Covenant and had other disagreements regarding the relationship between the covenant of works and the covenant of grace. Though Cocceius himself rejected Cartesianism, some of his followers were influenced by it and this led to even more suspicion of the Coccieans on behalf of the rest of the Reformed.\n\nIn France, Moses Amyraut at the Academy of Saumur taught a doctrine known as Amyraldism which is considered a compromise between the doctrine of predestination presented at the Synod of Dort and that of Arminianism. Amyraut taught that God elects to salvation in two ways. First, the entire human race is elected to salvation on condition of their faith in him. Then, based on his foreknowledge that no one would have faith, God elects some to salvation in a second, particular election. Most Reformed scholastics rejected Amyraut's views, arguing that it was a return to Arminianism because the first decree of election was conditional on faith. The Swiss \"Formula consensus Helvetica\" was written primarily by Johann Heinrich Heidegger with help from Francis Turretin to repudiate Amyraldism.\n\nIn England, many of the Reformed, along with some other Protestants refused to remain within the Anglican church and were thus known as Nonconformists. They were divided between Presbyterians (who maintained a hierarchical church government), Independents or Congregationalists (who advocated the autonomy of local churches), and Baptists (who through the influence of Dutch Anabaptists practiced only believer's baptism). The 1647 Westminster Confession of Faith established a consensus among them.\n\nDuring the eighteenth century the scholastic method of theology began to stagnate in favor of exegetical and historical theology. The Age of Enlightenment brought about greater reliance on reason and less dependence on the authority of authoritative texts such as the Bible, leading to the rise of biblical criticism and natural theology.\n\nIn the Netherlands the \"Green Cocceians\" (named after Henricus Groenewegen, Groen = Green in Dutch) surpassed the Voetians who had been dominant in the 17th century. They attempted to find a mediating position between Enlightenment thought and Reformed theology, which resulted in intense controversy with other Reformed scholastics. Enlightenment thought was even more influential in Germany and England, leading to the rise of deism, biblical criticism, and rationalism at the expense of scholastic modes of thinking. John Gill defended the English particular Baptists, who taught the Reformed doctrine of limited atonement, from the influence of Arminianism and Socianism and is considered one of the most important Reformed scholastics of the 18th century. Reformed scholastic theology was more dominant in Scotland. The Marrow Controversy, which began in 1718, was caused by disagreements between so-called the neonomians and antinomians over the relationship of the covenant of works and covenant of grace. The opposing sides often used scholastic distinctions and methods. The controversy ended with the split of the Church of Scotland and the establishment of the Associate Presbytery. In Switzerland the Enlightenment had a significant impact on the shape of Reformed theology. Jean Alphonse Turretin, son of high orthodox scholastic Francis Turretin, along with Jean-Frédéric Osterwald and Samuel Werenfels rejected the doctrine of predestination, the Synod of Dort, and the Helvetic Consensus.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Another of Fermi's students, Marvin L. Goldberger, claims that Fermi said that \"Garwin was the only true genius he had ever met\".\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Chicago, Garwin joined the physics faculty there and spent summers as a consultant to Los Alamos National Laboratory working on nuclear weapons. Garwin was the author of the actual design used in the first hydrogen bomb (code-named Mike) in 1952. He was assigned the job by Edward Teller, with the instructions that he was to make it as conservative a design as possible in order to prove the concept was feasible. He also worked on the development of the first spy satellites, for which he was named one of the ten founders of national reconnaissance. While at IBM, his work on spin-echo magnetic resonance laid the foundations for MRI; he was the catalyst for the discovery and publication of the Cooley–Tukey FFT algorithm, today a staple of digital signal processing; he worked on gravitational waves; and played a crucial role in the development of laser printers and touch-screen monitors. He has been granted 47 patents and has published over 500 papers.\n\nIn December 1952, he joined IBM's Watson laboratory, where he worked continuously until his retirement in 1993. He is currently IBM Fellow Emeritus at the Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, New York. During his career Garwin divided his time between applied research, basic science, and consulting to the U.S. Government on national-security matters. Parallel to his appointment at IBM, at different periods he held an adjunct professorship in physics at Columbia University; an appointment as the Andrew D. White Professor-at-Large at Cornell University; and a professorship in public policy, and in physics, at Harvard University. He has also been the Philip D. Reed Senior Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, NY.\n\nGarwin served on the U.S. President's Science Advisory Committee from 1962–65 and 1969–72, under Presidents Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon. He has been a member of the JASON Defense Advisory Group since 1966. As a member of the Institute for Defense Analyses' Jason Division of U.S. university scientists. on Sat. Feb. 3, 1968, Garwin “traveled to Vietnam” with Henry Kendall and several other scientists “to check on the operation of the electronic barrier” he and other Jason scientists developed for the Pentagon to utilize in Indochina, according to The Jasons by Ann Finkbeiner. And, in the 1960s, \"Jason scientist Richard Garwin, a nuclear physicist who, years before, helped design the Castle Bravo hydrogen bomb, held a seminar on the SADEYE cluster bomb and other munitions that would be most effective when accompanying the sensors\" of the electronic barrier in Vietnam, according to page 205 of Annie Jacobsen's book, \"The Pentagon's Brain: An Uncensored History of DARPA, America's Top Secret Military Research Agency,\" that Little Brown & Company, NY published in 2015. From 1993 to August 2001, he chaired the Arms Control and Nonproliferation Advisory Board of the U.S. Department of State. From 1966 to 1969 he served on the Defense Science Board. He also served on the Commission to Assess the Ballistic Missile Threat to the United States in 1998. He is currently a member of the National Academies' Committee on International Security and Arms Control and has served on 27 other National Academies committees.\n\nIn 2017, science journalist Joel N.

McGrath (born 1966) is a Canadian philosopher and Professor of Philosophy at Memorial University of Newfoundland. He is known for his works on Friedrich Schelling and Heidegger's philosophy.\nMcGrath is the editor of \"Analecta Hermeneutica\" and a member of the College of New Scholars, Artists and Scientists of the Royal Society of Canada.\n\nMcGrath’s publications and presentations since graduating from the University of Toronto in 2002 fall broadly into the area known as continental philosophy, but with an interdisciplinary focus that encompasses religion, ecology, and depth psychology. Three areas are predominant in his output: (1) the philosophy of religion and Christian theology; (2) the philosophy of nature; and (3) the philosophy of psychology.\nA major theme of his work concerns the legacy of religion in secular society. Where many theories of secularization speak of the progressive separation of culture from religion, McGrath understands the phenomenon to be far more complex. With thinkers such as Max Weber, Karl Löwith, and Marcel Gauchet, McGrath maintains that secular society is itself a product of the Christian religion, and continues to depend upon it.\n\nMcGrath explored the problem of secularization in his book, \"\" (2006, reprinted 2013). Struck by the analogies between the thought of the early Heidegger and late medieval and early Protestant Christianity, McGrath discovered that the similarities were far from accidental. Through careful archival work in Germany, McGrath argued (with Max Scheler and Jacques Derrida), that Heidegger, an ex-seminarian and formerly devout Catholic, had secularized Christian concepts in \"Being and Time\". Heidegger’s book went on to become a foundational text in 20th century atheist thought, and yet none of its major themes would be possible, according to McGrath, without Christianity. Theodore Kisiel described \"Phenomenology for the Godforsaken\" as “a systematic and detailed dismantling of Heidegger’s deconstruction of medieval scholasticism … Substantial and novel, this work offers a significant and timely contribution to the Heidegger literature” (back cover). On the strength of this work, the Centre for Theology and Philosophy at the University of Nottingham, the theological think-tank headed by the Anglican theologian John Milbank, commissioned McGrath to write a short critique of Heidegger for theologians.\n\nMcGrath’s second book, \"\", extended the theological analysis of Heidegger into political terrain. McGrath argued for a clear connection between Heidegger’s Nazi sympathies and his relationship to Christianity.\nJohn Hughes described the book as “one of the clearest and most elegantly written [accounts of Heidegger] I have come across”.\nThe work of unraveling the complicated relationship of secular forms of thought to theology led McGrath to his next major project: psychoanalysis. McGrath’s examined how the psychoanalytical concept of the unconscious originates in German Idealism, especially the work of the German philosopher, Friedrich Schelling. With the support of a Humboldt fellowship, and after four years of research in Germany and Switzerland, McGrath published his third book, \"\". \"The Dark Ground\" received many favorable reviews: “Among the most imaginative, original, at times exhilarating, studies of Schelling to appear in recent years,” wrote Jason Wirth of Seattle University. “Rarely has Schelling been written about with such clarity and passion,” wrote Paul C. Bishop of the University of Glasgow. “McGrath’s careful research clinches the argument that the theosophical tradition of Boehme as received by Schellingian philosophy constitutes the root of the unconscious.”\nWith Jason Wirth, McGrath founded the North American Schelling Society in 2011. McGrath is currently working on a study of the late Schelling’s philosophy of religion. It will be published in 2019 under the title \"Schelling and the End of Christianity\".\n\nMcGrath is active in environmental philosophy and interdisciplinary ecology. He has examined the theological origins of the ecological crisis in several articles. His recent publications have stressed the religious roots of consumerism, underscoring the need for an ethical transformation of the social imaginary if we are to meet the challenge of climate change. In his fourth book, \"Thinking Nature: An Essay in Negative Ecology\" (Edinburgh University Press, 2019), McGrath argues against a major trend in environmental theory that thinks “nature is dead.” The concept of nature, however vague, remains vital, in McGrath’s view, to both metaphysics and to public ecological discourse, and has the potential to produce new meanings which could mobilize communities to creatively respond to climate change. The symbol of nature has a vague religious aura in contemporary culture, according to McGrath, precisely because ecology is a site—perhaps the last site—for the resurgence of the sacred in a secular setting. The forgetting of nature leads directly to the ascendency of consumerism, which preys on the Western imaginary in dangerous ways. Only by remembering nature, McGrath argues, and what we owe to it, will we find the will to disengage from consumption.\n\nIn 2015, with Kyla Bruff (doctoral candidate in Philosophy at Memorial) and Barry Stephenson (Religious Studies, Memorial) McGrath founded \"For a New Earth\", a registered NPO in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador. FANE has as its mission “ecological conversion for everyone.”\n\n\n"}

Derrida also develops key discussions of the terms deconstruction and différance. Derrida commented that \"Speech and Phenomena\" is the \"essay I value the most\". Derrida's best known work on Husserl's phenomenology, it is widely considered one of his most important philosophical works.\n\n\"Speech and Phenomena\" is the culmination of a long period of study on the phenomenology of Edmund Husserl that Derrida began with his 1953/54 masters thesis \"The Problem of Genesis in Husserl's Phenomenology\". This early thesis then formed the basis for his 1959 paper \"'Genesis and Structure' and Phenomenology.\" Derrida also translated Husserl's \"Origin of Geometry\" from German into French and published his translation of this article with a book length introduction in 1962.\n\n\"Speech and Phenomena\" consists of an introduction and seven chapters: (1) Sign and Signs, (2) The Reduction of Indication, (3) Meaning as Soliloquy, (4) Meaning and Representation, (5) Signs and the Blink of an Eye, (6) The Voice that Keeps Silence, (7) The Supplement of Origin.\n\nDerrida identifies his theme in the first chapter as the twofold sense of the word sign for Husserl. Derrida notes that Husserl makes a conceptual distinction in the use of the word sign between expression and indication. For Husserl, Derrida argues, the expression and the indication are both signs but the latter is a sign without meaning or sense. Expression intends towards an ideal meaning and is \"tied to the possibility of spoken language.\"\n\nOriginally translated into English by David B. Allison and published as \"Speech and Phenomena: And Other Essays on Husserl's Theory of Signs\" in 1973, a new translation by Leonard Lawlor under the title \"Voice and Phenomenon: Introduction to the Problem of the Sign in Husserl's Phenomenology\" was published in 2010.\n\nFor commentary on \"Speech and Phenomena\" see Leonard Lawlor's book \"Derrida and Husserl\" (2002) and Joshua Kates's book \"Essential History\" (2005).\n\n"}

{"id": "1515577", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1515577", "title": "Three Treasures (Taoism)", "text": "Three Treasures (Taoism)\n\nThe Three Treasures or Three Jewels () are basic virtues in Taoism. Although the \"Tao Te Ching\" originally used \"sanbao\" to mean \"compassion\", \"frugality\", and \"humility\", the term was later used to translate the Three Jewels (Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha) in Chinese Buddhism, and to mean the Three Treasures (jing, qi, and shen) in Traditional Chinese Medicine.\n\n\"Sanbao\" \"three treasures\" first occurs in \"Tao Te Ching\" chapter 67, which Lin Yutang (1948:292) says contains Laozi's \"most beautiful teachings\":\n天下皆謂我道大，似不肖。夫唯大，故似不肖。若肖久矣。其細也夫！我有三寶，持而保之。一曰慈，二曰儉，三曰不敢為天下先。慈故能勇；儉故能廣；不敢為天下先，故能成器長。今舍慈且勇；舍儉且廣；舍後且先；死矣！夫慈以戰則勝，以守則固。天將救之，以慈衛之。\nEvery one under heaven says that our Way is greatly like folly. But it is just because it is great, that it seems like folly. As for things that do not seem like folly — well, there can be no question about \"their\" smallness!<br>\nHere are my three treasures. Guard and keep them! The first is pity; the second, frugality; the third, refusal to be 'foremost of all things under heaven'. <br>\nFor only he that pities is truly able to be brave; <br>\nOnly he that is frugal is able to be profuse. <br>\nOnly he that refuses to be foremost of all things <br>\nIs truly able to become chief of all Ministers. <br>\nAt present your bravery is not based on pity, nor your profusion on frugality, nor your vanguard on your rear; and this is death. But pity cannot fight without conquering or guard without saving. Heaven arms with pity those whom it would not see destroyed. (tr. Waley 1958:225)\n\nArthur Waley describes these Three Treasures as, \"The three rules that formed the practical, political side of the author's teaching (1) abstention from aggressive war and capital punishment, (2) absolute simplicity of living, (3) refusal to assert active authority.\"\n\nThe first of the Three Treasures is \"ci\" (), which is also a Classical Chinese term for \"mother\" (with \"tender love, nurturing \" semantic associations). \"Tao Te Ching\" chapters 18 and 19 parallel \"ci\" (\"parental love\") with \"xiao\" (孝 \"filial love; filial piety\"). Wing-tsit Chan (1963:219) believes \"the first is the most important\" of the Three Treasures, and compares \"ci\" with Confucianist \"ren\" (仁 \"humaneness; benevolence\"), which the \"Tao Te Ching\" (e.g., chapters 5 and 38) mocks.\n\nThe second is \"jian\" (), a practice that the \"Tao Te Ching\" (e.g., chapter 59) praises. Ellen M. Chen (1989:209) believes \"jian\" is \"organically connected\" with the Taoist metaphor \"pu\" (樸 \"uncarved wood; simplicity\"), and \"stands for the economy of nature that does not waste anything. When applied to the moral life it stands for the simplicity of desire.\"\n\nThe third treasure is a six-character phrase instead of a single word: \"Bugan wei tianxia xian\" 不敢為天下先 \"not dare to be first/ahead in the world\". \nChen notes that\nThe third treasure, daring not be at the world's front, is the Taoist way to avoid premature death. To be at the world's front is to expose oneself, to render oneself vulnerable to the world's destructive forces, while to remain behind and to be humble is to allow oneself time to fully ripen and bear fruit. This is a treasure whose secret spring is the fear of losing one's life before one's time. This fear of death, out of a love for life, is indeed the key to Taoist wisdom. (1989:209) \n\nIn the Mawangdui Silk Texts version of the \"Tao Te Ching\", this traditional \"Three Treasures\" chapter 67 is chapter 32, following the traditional last chapter (81, 31). Based upon this early silk manuscript, Robert G. Henricks (1989:160) concludes that \"Chapters 67, 68, and 69 should be read together as a unit.\" Besides some graphic variants and phonetic loan characters, like \"ci\" (兹 \"mat, this\") for \"ci\" (慈 \"compassion, love\", clarified with the \"heart radical\" 心), the most significant difference with the received text is the addition of \"heng\" (恆, \"constantly, always\") with \"I constantly have three …\" (我恆有三) instead of \"I have three …\" (我有三).\n\nThe language of the \"Tao Te Ching\" is notoriously difficult to translate, as illustrated by the diverse English renditions of \"Three Treasures\" below.\n\nA consensus translation of the Three Treasures could be: compassion or love, frugality or simplicity, and humility or modesty.\n\nIn addition to these Taoist \"Three Treasures\", Chinese \"sanbao\" can also refer to the Three Treasures in Traditional Chinese Medicine or the Three Jewels in Buddhism. Victor H. Mair (1990:110) notes that Chinese Buddhists chose the Taoist term \"sanbao\" to translate Sanskrit \"triratna\" or \"ratnatraya\" (\"three jewels\"), and \"It is not at all strange that the Taoists would take over this widespread ancient Indian expression and use it for their own purposes.\"\n\nErik Zürcher, who studied influences of Buddhist doctrinal terms in Daoism, noted (1980:115) two later meanings of \"sanbao\": \"Dao\" 道 \"the Way\", \"jing\" 經 \"the Scriptures\", and \"shi\" 師 \"the Master\" seems to be patterned after Buddhist usage; \"Tianbao jun\" 天寶君 \"Lord of Celestial Treasure\", \"Lingbao jun\" 靈寶君 \"Lord of Numinous Treasure\", and \"Shenbao jun\" 神寶君 \"Lord of Divine Treasure\" are the \"Sanyuan\" 三元 \"Three Primes\" of the Lingbao School.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "476248", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=476248", "title": "Tian", "text": "Tian\n\nTiān () is one of the oldest Chinese terms for heaven and a key concept in Chinese mythology, philosophy, and religion. During the Shang Dynasty (17–11th centuries BCE), the Chinese referred to their supreme god as \"Shàngdì\" (, \"Lord on High\") or \"Dì\" (,\"Lord\"). During the following Zhou Dynasty, \"Tiān\" became synonymous with this figure. Heaven worship was, before the 20th century, an orthodox state religion of China.\n\nIn Taoism and Confucianism, \"Tiān\" (the celestial aspect of the cosmos, often translated as \"Heaven\") is mentioned in relationship to its complementary aspect of \"Dì\" (地, often translated as \"Earth\"). These two aspects of Daoist cosmology are representative of the dualistic nature of Taoism. They are thought to maintain the two poles of the Three Realms () of reality, with the middle realm occupied by Humanity (, \"Rén\"), and the lower world occupied by demons (, \"Mó\") and ghosts (, \"Guǐ\"). \n\nThe modern Chinese character and early seal script both combine \"dà\" \"great; large\" and \"yī\" \"one\", but some of the original characters in Shāng oracle bone script and Zhōu bronzeware script anthropomorphically portray a large head on a great person. The ancient oracle and bronze ideograms for \"dà\" 大 depict a stick figure person with arms stretched out denoting \"great; large\". The oracle and bronze characters for \"tiān\" 天 emphasize the cranium of this \"great (person)\", either with a square or round head, or head marked with one or two lines. Schuessler (2007:495) notes the bronze graphs for \"tiān\", showing a person with a round head, resemble those for \"dīng\" \"4th Celestial stem\", and suggests \"The anthropomorphic graph may or may not indicate that the original meaning was 'deity', rather than 'sky'.\"\n\nTwo variant Chinese characters for \"tiān\" 天 \"heaven\" are (written with \"er\" \"two\" and \"ren\" \"human\") and the Daoist coinage (with \"qīng\" \"blue\" and \"qì\", i.e., \"blue sky\").\n\nThe Modern Standard Chinese pronunciation of 天 \"sky, heaven; heavenly deity, god\" is \"tiān\" in level first tone. The character is read as Cantonese \"tin1\"; Taiwanese \"thiN1\" or \"thian1\"; Vietnamese \"yêu\" or \"thiên\"; Korean \"cheon\" or \"ch'ŏn\" (천); and Japanese \"ten\" in \"On'yomi\" (borrowed Chinese reading) and \"ame\" or \"sora\" in \"Kun'yomi\" (native Japanese reading).\n\n\"Tiān\" 天 reconstructions in Middle Chinese (ca. 6th–10th centuries CE) include \"t'ien\" (Bernhard Karlgren), \"t'iɛn\" (Zhou Fagao), \"tʰɛn\" > \"tʰian\" (Edwin G. Pulleyblank), and \"then\" (William H. Baxter, Baxter & Sagart). Reconstructions in Old Chinese (ca. 6th–3rd centuries BCE) include *\"t'ien\" (Karlgren), *\"t'en\" (Zhou), *\"hlin\" (Baxter), *\"thîn\" (Schuessler), and *\"l̥ˤin\" (Baxter & Sagart).\n\nFor the etymology of \"tiān\", Schuessler (2007:495) links it with the Mongolian word \"tengri\" \"sky, heaven, heavenly deity\" or the Tibeto-Burman words \"taleŋ\" (Adi) and \"tǎ-lyaŋ\" (Lepcha), both meaning \"sky\". Schuessler (2007:211) also suggests a likely connection between Chinese \"tiān\" 天, \"diān\" 巔 \"summit, mountaintop\", and \"diān\" 顛 \"summit, top of the head, forehead\", which have cognates such as Naga \"tiŋ\" \"sky\".\n\n\"Tiān\" is one of the components in hundreds of Chinese compounds. Some significant ones include:\n\nThe concept of Heaven (Tian, 天) is pervasive in Confucianism. Confucius had a deep trust in Heaven and believed that Heaven overruled human efforts. He also believed that he was carrying out the will of Heaven, and that Heaven would not allow its servant, Confucius, to be killed until his work was done. Many attributes of Heaven were delineated in his \"Analects\".\n\nConfucius honored Heaven as the supreme source of goodness:\nThe Master said, \"Great indeed was Yao as a sovereign! How majestic was he! It is only Heaven that is grand, and only Yao corresponded to it. How vast was his virtue! The people could find no name for it. How majestic was he in the works which he accomplished! How glorious in the elegant regulations which he instituted!\" (VIII, xix, tr. Legge 1893:214)\nConfucius felt himself personally dependent upon Heaven (VI, xxviii, tr. Legge 1893:193): \"Wherein I have done improperly, may Heaven reject me! may Heaven reject me!\"\n\nConfucius believed that Heaven cannot be deceived:\n\nConfucius believed that Heaven gives people tasks to perform to teach them of virtues and morality:\nThe Master said, \"At fifteen, I had my mind bent on learning. At thirty, I stood firm. At forty, I had no doubts. At fifty, I knew the decrees of Heaven. At sixty, my ear was an obedient organ for the reception of truth. At seventy, I could follow what my heart desired, without transgressing what was right.\" (II, iv, tr. Legge 1893:146) \n\nHe believed that Heaven knew what he was doing and approved of him, even though none of the rulers on earth might want him as a guide:\nThe Master said, \"Alas! there is no one that knows me.\" Zi Gong said, \"What do you mean by thus saying - that no one knows you?\" The Master replied, \"I do not murmur against Heaven. I do not grumble against men. My studies lie low, and my penetration rises high. But there is Heaven - that knows me!\" (XIV, xxxv, tr. Legge 1893:288-9)\n\nPerhaps the most remarkable saying, recorded twice, is one in which Confucius expresses complete trust in the overruling providence of Heaven:\nThe Master was put in fear in Kuang. He said, \"After the death of King Wen, was not the cause of truth lodged here in me? If Heaven had wished to let this cause of truth perish, then I, a future mortal, should not have got such a relation to that cause. While Heaven does not let the cause of truth perish, what can the people of Kuang do to me?\" (IX, v and VII, xxii, tr. Legge 1893:217-8) \n\nFor Mozi, Heaven is the divine ruler, just as the Son of Heaven is the earthly ruler. Mozi believed that spirits and minor demons and spirits exist or at least rituals should be performed as if they did for social reasons, but their function is to carry out the will of Heaven, watching for evil-doers and punishing them. Mozi taught that Heaven loves all people equally and that each person should similarly love all human beings without distinguishing between his own relatives and those of others (Dubs, 1959-1960:163-172). Mozi criticized the Confucians of his own time for not following the teachings of Confucius. In Mozi's \"Will of Heaven\" (天志), he writes:\nMoreover, I know Heaven loves men dearly not without reason. Heaven ordered the sun, the moon, and the stars to enlighten and guide them. Heaven ordained the four seasons, Spring, Autumn, Winter, and Summer, to regulate them. Heaven sent down snow, frost, rain, and dew to grow the five grains and flax and silk that so the people could use and enjoy them. Heaven established the hills and rivers, ravines and valleys, and arranged many things to minister to man's good or bring him evil. He appointed the dukes and lords to reward the virtuous and punish the wicked, and to gather metal and wood, birds and beasts, and to engage in cultivating the five grains and flax and silk to provide for the people's food and clothing. This has been so from antiquity to the present.\" (tr. Mei 1929:145)\n\nThere are three major schools on cosmology. Most other hypothesis were developed from them.\n\n\"Gaitian shuo\" (蓋天說) \"Canopy-Heavens hypothesis\" originated from the text Zhoubi Suanjing. The earth is covered by a material tian.\n\n\"Huntian shuo\" (渾天說) \"Egg-like hypothesis\". The earth surrounded by a tian sphere rotating over it. The celestial bodies are attached to the tian sphere. (See , Chinese creation myth.)\n\n\"Xuanye shuo\" (宣夜說) \"Firmament hypothesis\". The tian is an infinite space. The celestial bodies were light matters floating on it moved by \"Qi\". A summary by Ji Meng (郗萌) is in the astronomical chapters of the Book of Jin.\n\nSometimes the sky is divided into \"Jiutian\" (九天) \"the nine sky divisions\", the middle sky and the eight directions.\n\nThe Tian are the heaven worlds and pure lands in Buddhist cosmology. Some devas are also called Tian.\n\nThe number of vertical heaven layers in Taoism is different, the most common saying is the 36 Tian developed from Durenjing (度人經).\n\nIn I-Kuan Tao, Tian are divided into 3 vertical worlds. \"Li Tian\" (理天) \"heaven of truth\", \"Qi Tian\" (氣天) \"heaven of spirit\" and \"Xiang Tian\" (象天) \"heaven of matter\".\n\nThe semantics of \"tian\" developed diachronically. The \"Hanyu dazidian\", an historical dictionary of Chinese characters, lists 17 meanings of \"tian\" 天, translated below.\n\n\nThe Chinese philosopher Feng Youlan differentiates five different meanings of \"tian\" in early Chinese writings: \n(1) A material or physical \"T'ien\" or sky, that is, the \"T'ien\" often spoken of in apposition to earth, as in the common phrase which refers to the physical universe as 'Heaven and Earth' (\"T'ien Ti\" 天地). <br>\n(2) A ruling or presiding \"T'ien\", that is, one such as is meant in the phrase, 'Imperial Heaven Supreme Emperor' (\"Huang T'ien Shang Ti\"), in which anthropomorphic \"T'ien\" and \"Ti\" are signified. <br>\n(3) A fatalistic \"T'ien\", equivalent to the concept of Fate (\"ming\" 命), a term applied to all those events in human life over which man himself has no control. This is the \"T'ien\" Mencius refers to when he says: \"As to the accomplishment of a great deed, that is with \"T'ien\"\" ([\"Mencius\"], Ib, 14). <br>\n(4) A naturalistic \"T'ien\", that is, one equivalent to the English word Nature. This is the sort of \"T'ien\" described in the 'Discussion on \"T'ien\"' in the [\"Hsün Tzǔ\"] (ch. 17). <br>\n(5) An ethical \"T'ien\", that is, one having a moral principle and which is the highest primordial principle of the universe. This is the sort of \"T'ien\" which the [\"Chung Yung\"] (Doctrine of the Mean) refers to in its opening sentence when it says: \"What \"T'ien\" confers (on man) is called his nature.\" (1952:31) \n\nThe \"Oxford English Dictionary\" enters the English loanword \"t'ien\" (also \"tayn\", \"tyen\", \"tien\", and \"tiān\") \"Chinese thought: Heaven; the Deity.\" The earliest recorded usages for these spelling variants are: 1613 \"Tayn\", 1710 \"Tien\", 1747 \"Tyen\", and 1878 \"T'ien\".\n\nThe sinologist Herrlee Creel, who wrote a comprehensive study on \"The Origin of the Deity T'ien\" (1970:493–506), gives this overview.\n\nCreel refers to the historical shift in ancient Chinese names for \"god\"; from Shang oracles that frequently used \"di\" and \"shangdi\" and rarely used \"tian\" to Zhou bronzes and texts that used \"tian\" more frequently than its synonym \"shangdi\".\n\nFirst, Creel analyzes all the \"tian\" and \"di\" occurrences meaning \"god; gods\" in Western Zhou era Chinese classic texts and bronze inscriptions. The \"Yi Jing\" \"Classic of Changes\" has 2 \"tian\" and 1 \"di\"; the \"Shi Jing\" \"Classic of Poetry\" has 140 \"tian\" and 43 \"di\" or \"shangdi\"; and the authentic portions of the \"Shu Jing\" \"Classic of Documents\" have 116 \"tian\" and 25 \"di\" or \"shangdi\". His corpus of authenticated Western Zhou bronzes (1970:464–75) mention \"tian\" 91 times and \"di\" or \"shangdi\" only 4 times. Second, Creel contrasts the disparity between 175 occurrences of \"di\" or \"shangdi\" on Shang era oracle inscriptions with \"at least\" 26 occurrences of \"tian\". Upon examining these 26 oracle scripts that scholars (like Guo Moruo) have identified as \"tian\" 天 \"heaven; god\" (1970:494–5), he rules out 8 cases in fragments where the contextual meaning is unclear. Of the remaining 18, Creel interprets 11 cases as graphic variants for \"da\" \"great; large; big\" (e.g., \"tian i shang\" 天邑商 for \"da i shang\" 大邑商 \"great settlement Shang\"), 3 as a place name, and 4 cases of oracles recording sacrifices \"yu tian\" 于天 \"to/at Tian\" (which could mean \"to Heaven/God\" or \"at a place called Tian\".)\n\nThe \"Shu Jing\" chapter \"Tang Shi\" (湯誓 \"Tang's Speech\") illustrates how early Zhou texts used \"tian\" \"heaven; god\" in contexts with \"shangdi\" \"god\". According to tradition, Tang of Shang assembled his subjects to overthrow King Jie of Xia, the infamous last ruler of the Xia Dynasty, but they were reluctant to attack.\n\nHaving established that \"Tian\" was not a deity of the Shang people, Creel (1970:501–6) proposes a hypothesis for how it originated. Both the Shang and Zhou peoples pictographically represented \"da\" 大 as \"a large or great man\". The Zhou subsequently added a head on him to denote \"tian\" 天 meaning \"king, kings\" (cf. \"wang\" \"king; ruler\", which had oracle graphs picturing a line under a \"great person\" and bronze graphs that added the top line). From \"kings\", \"tian\" was semantically extended to mean \"dead kings; ancestral kings\", who controlled \"fate; providence\", and ultimately a single omnipotent deity \"Tian\" \"Heaven\". In addition, \"tian\" named both \"the heavens\" (where ancestral kings and gods supposedly lived) and the visible \"sky\".\n\nAnother possibility is that \"Tian\" may be related to \"Tengri\" and possibly was a loan word from a prehistoric Central Asian language (Müller 1870).\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "32680", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32680", "title": "Vilfredo Pareto", "text": "Vilfredo Pareto\n\nVilfredo Federico Damaso Pareto (; ; born Wilfried Fritz Pareto, 15 July 1848 – 19 August 1923) was an Italian engineer, sociologist, economist, political scientist, and philosopher. He made several important contributions to economics, particularly in the study of income distribution and in the analysis of individuals' choices. He was also responsible for popularising the use of the term \"elite\" in social analysis.\n\nHe introduced the concept of Pareto efficiency and helped develop the field of microeconomics. He was also the first to discover that income follows a Pareto distribution, which is a power law probability distribution. The Pareto principle was named after him, and it was built on observations of his such as that 80% of the land in Italy was owned by about 20% of the population. He also contributed to the fields of sociology and mathematics, according to the mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot and Richard L. Hudson:\n\nPareto was born of an exiled noble Genoese family in 1848 in Paris, the centre of the popular revolutions of that year. His father, Raffaele Pareto (1812–1882), was an Italian civil engineer and Ligurian marquis who had left Italy much like Giuseppe Mazzini and other Italian nationalists. His mother, Marie Metenier, was a French woman. Enthusiastic about the 1848 German revolution, his parents named him Fritz Wilfried, which became Vilfredo Federico upon his family's move back to Italy in 1858. In his childhood, Pareto lived in a middle-class environment, receiving a high standard of education, attending the new created \"Istituto Tecnico Leardi\" where Fernando Pio Rosellini was his mathematics professor. In 1869, he earned a doctor's degree in engineering from what is now the Polytechnic University of Turin (then the Technical School for Engineers). His dissertation was entitled \"The Fundamental Principles of Equilibrium in Solid Bodies\". His later interest in equilibrium analysis in economics and sociology can be traced back to this paper.\n\nFor some years after graduation, he worked as a civil engineer, first for the state-owned Italian Railway Company and later in private industry. He was manager of the Iron Works of San Giovanni Valdarno and later general manager of Italian Iron Works.\n\nHe did not begin serious work in economics until his mid-forties. He started his career a fiery advocate of classical liberalism, besting the most ardent British liberals with his attacks on any form of government intervention in the free market. In 1886, he became a lecturer on economics and management at the University of Florence. His stay in Florence was marked by political activity, much of it fueled by his own frustrations with government regulators. In 1889, after the death of his parents, Pareto changed his lifestyle, quitting his job and marrying a Russian, Alessandrina Bakunina. She left him in 1902 for a young servant.\n\nIn 1893, he succeeded Léon Walras to the chair of Political Economy at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland where he remained for the rest of his life. In 1906, he made the famous observation that twenty percent of the population owned eighty percent of the property in Italy, later generalised by Joseph M. Juran into the Pareto principle (also termed the 80–20 rule). In one of his books published in 1909 he showed the Pareto distribution of how wealth is distributed, he believed \"through any human society, in any age, or country\". He maintained cordial personal relationships with individual socialists, but always thought their economic ideas were severely flawed. He later became suspicious of their humanitarian motives and denounced socialist leaders as an 'aristocracy of brigands' who threatened to despoil the country and criticized the government of Giovanni Giolitti for not taking a tougher stance against worker strikes. Growing unrest among labor in Italy led him to the anti-socialist and anti-democratic camp. His attitude toward fascism in his last years is a matter of controversy.\n\nPareto's relationship with scientific sociology in the age of the foundation is grafted in a paradigmatic way in the moment in which he, starting from the political economy, criticizes positivism as a totalizing and metaphysical system devoid of a rigorous logical-experimental method. In this sense we can read the fate of the\nParetian production within a history of the social sciences that continues to show its peculiarity and interest for its contributions in the 21st century (Giovanni Busino, \"Sugli studi paretiani all'alba del XXI secolo\" in \"Omaggio a Vilfredo Pareto\", \"Numero monografico in memoria di Giorgio Sola\" a cura di Stefano Monti Bragadin, \"Storia Politica Società\", Quaderni di Scienze Umane, anno IX, n. 15, giugno-dicembre 2009, p. 1 e sg.)) . The story of Pareto is also part of the multidisciplinary research of a scientific model that privileges sociology as a critique of cumulative models of knowledge as well as a discipline tending to the affirmation of relational models of science (Guglielmo Rinzivillo, \"Vilfredo Pareto e i modelli interdisciplinari nella scienza,\" \"Sociologia\", A. XXIX, n. 1, New Series, 1995, pp. 2017–222 see also in Guglielmo Rinzivillo, \"Una epistemologia senza storia\", Rome, New Culture, 2013, pp. 13–29, ).\n\nIn 1923 Pareto remarried with Jeanne Regis, just before he died in Geneva, Switzerland, 19 August 1923, \"among a menagerie of cats that he and his French lover kept\" in their villa; \"the local divorce laws prevented him from divorcing his wife and remarrying until just a few months prior to his death\".\n\nPareto's later years were spent in collecting the material for his best-known work, \"Trattato di sociologia generale\" (1916) (\"The Mind and Society\", published in 1935). His final work was \"Compendio di sociologia generale\" (1920).\n\nIn his \"Trattato di Sociologia Generale\" (1916, rev. French trans. 1917), published in English by Harcourt, Brace in a four-volume edition edited by Arthur Livingston under the title \"The Mind and Society\" (1935), Pareto developed the notion of the circulation of elites, the first social cycle theory in sociology. He is famous for saying \"history is a graveyard of aristocracies\".\n\nPareto seems to have turned to sociology for an understanding of why his abstract mathematical economic theories did not work out in practice, in the belief that unforeseen or uncontrollable social factors intervened. His sociology holds that much social action is nonlogical and that much personal action is designed to give spurious logicality to non-rational actions. We are driven, he taught, by certain \"residues\" and by \"derivations\" from these residues. The more important of these have to do with conservatism and risk-taking, and human history is the story of the alternate dominance of these sentiments in the ruling elite, which comes into power strong in conservatism but gradually changes over to the philosophy of the \"foxes\" or speculators. A catastrophe results, with a return to conservatism; the \"lion\" mentality follows. This cycle might be broken by the use of force, says Pareto, but the elite becomes weak and humanitarian and shrinks from violence.\n\nPareto's sociology was introduced to the United States by George Homans and Lawrence J. Henderson at Harvard, and had considerable influence, especially on Harvard sociologist Talcott Parsons, who developed a systems approach to society and economics that argues the status quo is usually functional.\n\nPareto was a lifelong opponent of Marxism.\n\nBenoît Mandelbrot wrote:\n\nPareto had argued that democracy was an illusion and that a ruling class always emerged and enriched itself. For him, the key question was how actively the rulers ruled. For this reason he called for a drastic reduction of the state and welcomed Benito Mussolini's rule as a transition to this minimal state so as to liberate the \"pure\" economic forces.\n\nMandelbrot summarized Pareto's notions as follows:\n\nThe future leader of Italian fascism Benito Mussolini, in 1904, when he was a young student, attended some of Pareto's lectures at the University of Lausanne. It has been argued that Mussolini's move away from socialism towards a form of \"elitism\" may be attributed to Pareto's ideas.\n\nTo quote Franz Borkenau, a biographer:\nKarl Popper dubbed Pareto the \"theoretician of totalitarianism\", but, according to Cirillo, there is no evidence in Popper's published work that he read Pareto in any detail before repeating what was then a common but dubious judgment in anti-fascist circles.\n\nSome fascist writers, such as Luigi Amoroso, wrote approvingly of Pareto's ideas:\nAuthor Renato Cirillo argued, on the contrary, that:\n\nPareto Theory Of Maximum Economics\n\nPareto turned his interest to economic matters and he became an advocate of free trade, finding himself in difficulty with the Italian government. His writings reflected the ideas of Léon Walras that economics is essentially a mathematical science. Pareto was a leader of the \"Lausanne School\" and represents the second generation of the Neoclassical Revolution. His \"tastes-and-obstacles\" approach to general equilibrium theory was resurrected during the great \"Paretian Revival\" of the 1930s and has influenced theoretical economics since.\n\nIn his \"Manual of Political Economy\" (1906) the focus is on equilibrium in terms of solutions to individual problems of \"objectives and constraints\". He used the indifference curve of Edgeworth (1881) extensively, for the theory of the consumer and, another great novelty, in his theory of the producer. He gave the first presentation of the trade-off box now known as the \"Edgeworth-Bowley\" box.\n\nPareto was the first to realize that cardinal utility could be dispensed with and economic equilibrium thought of in terms of ordinal utility – that is, it was not necessary to know how much a person valued this or that, only that he preferred X of this to Y of that. Utility was a preference-ordering. With this, Pareto not only inaugurated modern microeconomics, but he also demolished the alliance of economics and utilitarian philosophy (which calls for the greatest good for the greatest number; Pareto said \"good\" cannot be measured). He replaced it with the notion of \"Pareto-optimality\", the idea that a system is enjoying maximum economic satisfaction when no one can be made better off without making someone else worse off. Pareto optimality is widely used in welfare economics and game theory. A standard theorem is that a perfectly competitive market creates distributions of wealth that are Pareto optimal.\n\nSome economic concepts in current use are based on his work:\nHe argued that in all countries and times, the distribution of income and wealth is highly skewed, with a few holding most of the wealth. He argued that all observed societies follow a regular logarithmic pattern:\n\nwhere N is the number of people with wealth higher than x, and A and m are constants. Over the years, Pareto's Law has proved remarkably close to observed data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1040799", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1040799", "title": "Virtue epistemology", "text": "Virtue epistemology\n\nVirtue epistemology is a contemporary philosophical approach to epistemology that stresses the importance of intellectual, and specifically epistemic virtues. A distinguishing factor of virtue theories is that they use for the evaluation of knowledge the properties of the persons who hold beliefs in addition to or instead of the properties of propositions and beliefs. Some advocates of virtue epistemology claim to more closely follow theories of virtue ethics, while others see only a looser analogy between virtue in ethics and virtue in epistemology.\n\nIntellectual virtue has been a subject of philosophy since the work of Aristotle, but virtue epistemology is a development in the contemporary analytic tradition. It is characterized by efforts to solve problems of special concern to modern epistemology, such as justification and reliabilism, by directing attention on the knower as agent in a manner similar to the way virtue ethics focuses on moral agents rather than moral acts.\n\nThe development of virtue epistemology was partly inspired by a recent renewal of interest in virtue concepts among moral philosophers, and partly as a response to the intractability of competing analyses of knowledge in response to Edmund Gettier. Ernest Sosa introduced the notion of an intellectual virtue into contemporary epistemological discussion in a 1980 paper called \"The Raft and the Pyramid\". Sosa argued that an appeal to intellectual virtue could resolve the conflict between foundationalists and coherentists over the structure of epistemic justification. Sosa sought to bridge the gap and create a unity between these two different epistemological theories.\n\nFoundationalism holds that beliefs are founded or based on other beliefs in a hierarchy, similar to the bricks in the structure of a pyramid. Coherentism, on the other hand, uses the metaphor of a raft in which all beliefs are not tied down by foundations but instead are interconnected due to the logical relationships between each belief. Sosa found a flaw in each of these schools of epistemology, in both cases having to do with the relationship between belief and perception.\n\nCoherentism only allows for justification based on logical relations between all the beliefs within a system of beliefs. However, because perceptual beliefs may not have many logical ties with other beliefs in the system, the coherentist account of knowledge can be said to be inadequate to accommodate the importance normally attributed to perceptual information. On the other hand, Sosa also found problems in the foundationalist approach to epistemology. Foundationalism arguably encounters a problem when attempting to describe how foundational beliefs relate to the sensory experiences that support them.\n\nCoherentism and foundationalism developed as a response to the problems with the \"traditional\" account of knowledge (as justified true belief) developed by Edmund Gettier in 1963. As a result of Gettier's counterexamples, competing theories had been developed by a variety of philosophers, but the dispute between coherentists and foundationalists proved to be intractable. Sosa's paper suggested that virtue may help avoid the disputes between coherentist and foundationalist accounts.\n\nVirtue epistemology replaces formulaic expressions for apprehending knowledge, such as \"S knows that p\", by amending these formulas with virtue theory applied to intellect, where virtue then becomes the fulcrum for assessing potential candidates of \"knowledge\". This substitution raises problems of its own, however. If the same uncertainty about accuracy in creating a formula for testing knowledge equally applies to the authenticity of virtue, then one cannot know if the target virtue is credible. Some virtue epistemologists use reliabilism as a basis for belief justification, stressing reliable functioning of the intellect.\n\nThe ideas put forth in the area of virtue epistemology are consistent with some of the ideas present in contextualism. Several areas of contextual epistemology attack the problem of knowledge from a very objective standpoint. Virtue epistemology attempts to simplify the analysis of knowledge by replacing certain abstractions involved in the pursuit of the highest level of knowledge with flexible and contextual instances. Specifically, it leaves room for cognitive relativism. This degree of reliability is not constant; it can change depending on the context. Under this view, a well-functioning intellectual faculty is a necessary condition for the formation of knowledge. This is quite different from other areas of epistemology because it takes the state of an individual's intellect into account. As a result of this, social context also has the ability to alter knowledge. Social contexts change over time, making it necessary for the beliefs and knowledge to change with it.\n\nIn addition, virtue epistemology, similar to virtue ethics, is based on the intellectual qualities in relation to the individual as opposed to the quality of the belief; virtue epistemology is person-based, rather than belief-based. Consequently, virtue epistemology can also stress \"epistemic responsibility\", that is, an individual is held responsible for the virtue of their knowledge-gathering faculties.\n\nFor example, Massimo Pigliucci applies virtue epistemology to critical thinking and suggests the virtuous individual will consider the following:\n\n\nVirtue epistemologists differ in the role they believe virtue to play: eliminative virtue epistemology uses the concepts of intellectual virtue and intellectual vice to do away with epistemic concepts like knowledge and justification, while non-eliminative virtue epistemology gives a role for such traditional concepts and uses virtue to provide substantive explanation of those concepts.\n\nVirtue epistemologists differ in what they believe epistemic virtues to be. Some accounts are Aristotelian, drawing a relationship between intellectual virtue and character in a similar way to the way moral virtue is related to character, while \"weak\" virtue epistemology have an account that doesn't require any particular commitment or cultivation of intellectual virtue. Abrol Fairweather argues that these \"weak\" virtue epistemologists \"merely [use] virtue theory as a novel lexicon for expressing an independent epistemic theory\".\n\nAnother way of describing the differences in virtue epistemology is to say that there are two concurrent modes of thought in contemporary virtue epistemology, with one side favoring the \"virtue reliabilist\" account of virtues as reliably functioning cognitive faculties, and one favoring a \"virtue responsibilist\" account in which the responsible epistemic conduct of the agent plays a key role.\n\nThe virtue reliabilist takes the approach that the process whereby truth is garnered must be reliable. However, the stress of the reliability is not placed upon the mechanism of justification. Instead, the degree of reality-tracking ability determines how virtuous the individual's intellect is, and therefore how good one's knowledge is.\n\nFor Sosa, the more virtuous faculties are related to direct sensory perception and memory, and less virtuous capacities are ones related to beliefs derived from the primary memory or sense experience. Sosa has two criteria for having a belief to be warranted, or in his words, \"fully apt\". A belief must satisfy the first condition of being \"meta-justified\" in which the agent must have hit the truth as such. Furthermore, a belief must have been 'apt' in which the agent must have been displaying his virtuous capacities in claiming such a belief or hitting the truth as such. To argue by analogy, a hunter must not only be able to hit his target, say a moose, with precision and accuracy, but the shot must have been one that the hunter \"should have taken.\"\n\nFor another figure in reliabilist virtue epistemology, John Greco, knowledge and justified belief \"are grounded in stable and reliable cognitive character. Such character may include both a person's natural cognitive faculties as well as her acquired habits of thought... So long as such habits are both stable and successful, they make up the kind of character that gives rise to knowledge.\" This characterization of virtue reliabilism can be construed as more inclusive than Sosa's, eschewing the focus on memorial or sensory experience and instead locating virtue in an agent's stable and reliable dispositions to generate successful cognition. In doing so, Greco can be seen as making room for the inclusion of the intellectual virtues as typically construed by the responsibilist camp of virtue epistemology, since many of these virtues can be thought of as stable, reliable dispositions of character.\n\nIn virtue responsibilism, the emphasis is not on faculties such as perception and memory. Instead, certain intellectual character traits are valued as more virtuous than others. These can be creativity, inquisitiveness, rational rigor, honesty, or a number of other possibilities. Generally, these theories are normative in nature. A few different approaches are taken.\n\nSome, such as Lorraine Code, think that intellectual virtues involve having the correct cognitive character and epistemic relation to the world rooted in a social context. She sees the acquisition of correct knowledge about the world as the primary \"good\", and the end towards which our intellectual efforts should be oriented, with the desire for truth as the primary motivating factor for our epistemological virtues.\n\nJames Montmarquet's theory of intellectual virtue is similar to Code's, but specifically defines additional intellectual virtues in order to defuse the potential dogmatism or fanaticism that is compatible with Code's desire for truth. The primary virtue is conscientiousness, which focuses on the correct end of intellectual living. In order to obtain conscientiousness, it is important to maintain impartiality, sobriety, and courage.\n\nLinda Trinkaus Zagzebski has proposed a neo-Aristotelian model of virtue epistemology, emphasizing the role of \"phronesis\" (practical wisdom) as an architectonic virtue unifying moral and intellectual virtues even more radically than Aristotle proposed. As delineated in her model, the virtues are \"a deep and enduring acquired excellence of a person, involving a characteristic motivation to produce a certain desired end and reliable success in bringing about that end.\" As she sees it, the \"characteristic motivation\" of an intellectual virtue is the desire for truth, understanding, and other species of cognitive contact with reality. The notion of \"reliable success\" is invoked in order to avoid issues of well-intentioned but unsuccessful agents who desire truth but use poorly suited methods to pursue it.\n\nAlvin Plantinga offers another theory of knowledge closely related to virtue epistemology. According to him, knowledge is warranted if one's intellectual faculties are operating as they are designed to. That is, knowledge is valid if it is obtained through the correct operation of the faculties of the intellect which are designed to have an inherent ability, because they are designed that way, to capture and produce true beliefs.\n\nIn Jonathan Kvanvig's essay, \"Why Inquiring Minds Want to Know?: Meno Problems and Epistemological Axiology\" he asserts that epistemology has no place in philosophical study. The value of knowledge originates from the Socratic dialogue written by Plato called Meno. In Meno, Socrates' distinction between \"true belief\" and \"knowledge\" forms the basis of the philosophical definition of knowledge as \"justified true belief\". Socrates explains the similarities and differences between \"true belief\" and \"knowledge\", arguing that justified true belief fails to \"stay in their place\" and must be \"tethered\". According to Kvanvig, true belief is what is necessary to maximize truth and to avoid error, thus dropping justification from the equation of knowledge. He argues that once we recognize what the manipulated boundary notion of non-Gettierized account of knowledge is, then it becomes clear that there is nothing valuable about the anti-Gettier condition on knowledge. Kvanvig acknowledges that true belief falls short of knowledge, however to him, true belief is no less valuable than knowledge. Kvanvig believes that epistemology should be focused on understanding, an epistemic standing that Kvanvig maintains is of more value than knowledge and justified true belief.\n\nSome varieties of virtue epistemology that contain normative elements, such as virtue responsibilism, can provide a unified framework of normativity and value. Others, such as Sosa's account, can circumvent Cartesian skepticism with the necessity of externalism interacting with internalism. In this same vein, and because of the inherent flexibility and social nature of some of types of virtue epistemology, social conditioning and influence can be understood within an epistemological framework and explored. This flexibility and connection between internal and external makes virtue epistemology more accessible.\n\nRecent criticism of virtue epistemology has focused upon its characterization of human cognition as grounded in stable character dispositions (e.g. the disposition to use reliable faculties, or one's excellent character traits construed as dispositions). As discussed by a parallel criticism leveled at virtue ethics, virtue theories, whether moral or epistemic, typically consider character traits as stable across time, and efficacious as explanatory reasons for persons behaving and thinking as they do. However, this supposition has been challenged by the \"situationist critique\" in psychology, which argues that human epistemic character changes depending on context, even when that change is epistemically irrelevant. Thus, irrelevant differences in a situation can prompt a drastic change in cognitive behavior.\n\nReliabilists might characterize this as effecting a drop in reliable functioning, whereas responsibilists would see these variations as negating one's excellent cognitive character. It is therefore argued that virtue theorists should either amend their conception of human psychology to accommodate this or explain how the results of situationist psychological research do not contradict their theory.\n\n"}
