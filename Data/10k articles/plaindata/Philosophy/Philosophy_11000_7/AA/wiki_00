{"id": "895169", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=895169", "title": "Andrea Cesalpino", "text": "Andrea Cesalpino\n\nAndrea Cesalpino (Latinized as Andreas Cæsalpinus) (6 June 1519 – 23 February 1603) was an Italian physician, philosopher and botanist.\n\nIn his works he classified plants according to their fruits and seeds, rather than alphabetically or by medicinal properties. In 1555, he succeeded Luca Ghini as director of the botanical garden in Pisa. The botanist Pietro Castelli was one of his students. Cesalpino also did limited work in the field of physiology. He theorized a circulation of the blood. However, he envisioned a \"chemical circulation\" consisting of repeated evaporation and condensation of blood, rather than the concept of \"physical circulation\" popularized by the writings of William Harvey (1578–1657).\n\nCesalpino was born in Arezzo, Tuscany.\n\nFor his studies at the University of Pisa his instructor in medicine was R. Colombo (d. 1559), and in botany the celebrated Luca Ghini. After completing his course he taught philosophy, medicine, and botany for many years at the same university, besides making botanical explorations in various parts of Italy. At this time the first botanical gardens in Europe were laid out; the earliest at Padua, in 1546; the next at Pisa in 1547 by Ghini, who was its first director. Ghini was succeeded by Cesalpino, who had charge of the Pisan garden 1554–1558. When far advanced in years Cesalpino accepted a call to Rome as professor of medicine at University of Rome La Sapienza and physician to Pope Clement VIII. It is not positively certain whether he also became the chief superintendent of the Roman botanical garden which had been laid out about 1566 by one of his most celebrated pupils, Michele Mercati.\n\nAll of Cesalpino's writings show the man of genius and the profound thinker. His style, it is true, is often heavy, yet in spite of the scholastic form in which his works are cast, passages of great beauty often occur. Modern botanists and physiologists who are not acquainted with the writings of Aristotle find Cesalpino's books obscure; their failure to comprehend them has frequently misled them in their judgment of his achievement.\n\nNo comprehensive summing up of the results of Cesalpino's investigations, founded on a critical study of all his works has appeared, neither has there been a complete edition of his writings. Seven of these are positively known, and most of the seven have been printed several times, although none have appeared since the 17th century. In the following list the date of publication given is that of the first edition.\n\nHis most important philosophical work is \"Quaestionum peripateticarum libri V\" (1569). Cesalpino proves himself in this to be one of the most eminent and original students of Aristotle in the 16th century. His writings, however, show traces of the influence of Averroes, hence he is an Averroistic Aristotelean; apparently he was also inclined to pantheism, consequently he was included, later, in the Spinozists before Spinoza. A Protestant opponent of Aristotelean views, Nicolaus Taurellus wrote several times against Cesalpino. The work of Taurellus entitled \"Alpes cæsae,\" etc. (1597), is entirely devoted to combating the opinions of Cesalpino, as the play on the name Cæsalpinus shows. Nearly one hundred years later Cesalpino's views were again attacked by Samuel Parker, in a work entitled \"Disputationes de Deo et providentia divina\" (1678).\n\nCesalpino repeatedly asserted the steadfastness of his Catholic principles and his readiness to acknowledge the falsity of any philosophical opinions expounded by him as Aristotelean doctrine, which should be contrary to revelation. In Italy he was in high favour both with the secular and spiritual rulers.\n\nCesalpino's physiological investigations concerning the circulation of the blood are well known, but even up to the present time they have been as often overestimated as undervalued. An examination of the various passages in his writings which bear upon the question shows that although it must be said that Cesalpino had penetrated further into the secret of circulation of the blood than any other physiologist before William Harvey, still he had not attained a thorough knowledge, founded on anatomical research, of the entire course of the blood. Besides the work \"Quæstionum peripateticarum\" already mentioned, reference should be made to \"Quaestionum medicarum libri duo\" (1593).\n\nHis most important publication was \"De plantis libri XVI\" (1583). The date of its publication, 1583, is one of the most important in the history of botany before Carl Linnaeus. The work is dedicated to the Grand Duke Francesco I de' Medici. Unlike the \"herbals\" of that period, it contains no illustrations. The first section, including thirty pages of the work, is the part of most importance for botany in general. From the beginning of the 17th century up to the present day botanists have agreed in the opinion that Cesalpino in this work, in which he took Aristotle for his guide, laid the foundation of the morphology and physiology of plants and produced the first scientific classification of flowering plants. Three things, above all, give the book the stamp of individuality: the large number of original, acute observations, especially on flowers, fruits, and seeds, made, moreover, before the invention of the microscope, the selection of the organs of fructification for the foundation of his botanical system; finally, the ingenious and at the same time strictly philosophical handling of the rich material gathered by observation. Cesalpino issued a publication supplementary to this work, entitled \"Appendix ad libros de plantis et quaestiones peripateticas\" (1603).\n\nCesalpino is also famous in the history of botany as one of the first botanists to make an herbarium; one of the oldest herbaria still in existence is that which he arranged about 1550–60 for Bishop Alfonso Tornabono. After many changes of fortune the herbarium is now in the Museo di Storia Naturale di Firenze at Florence. It consists of 260 folio pages arranged in three volumes bound in red leather, and contains 768 species of plants. A work of some value for chemistry, mineralogy, and geology was issued by him under the title \"De metallicis libri tres\" (Rome, 1596). Some of its matter recalls the discoveries made at the end of the eighteenth century, as those of Antoine Lavoisier and René Just Haüy, it also shows a correct understanding of fossils.\n\nThe Franciscan monk Charles Plumier gave the name of \"Cæsalpinia\" to a plant genus and Linnaeus retained it in his system. At the present day this genus includes approximately 150 species and belongs family Fabaceae, subfamily Cæsalpinioideae, which contains a large number of useful plants. Linnaeus in his writings often quotes his great predecessor in the science of botany and praises Cesalpino in the following lines:\n\n\"Quisquis hic exstiterit primos concedat honores\"\n<br>\"Casalpine Tibi primaque certa dabit\".\n\nAs mentioned above, De metallicis libri tres (Rome, 1596) was of value for mineralogy and geology, displaying a correct understanding of fossils. Charles Lyell's \"Principles of Geology\" states that in 1596,\nCesalpino, a celebrated botanist, conceived that fossil shells had been left on the land by the sea, and had concreted into stone during the consolidation the soil.\"\n\n"}

In 1821 he entered one of the most prestigious Grande École, the École Normale Supérieure, and, according to Sandmo:\nin 1823 he took a license degree in mathematics at Sorbonne University. He then became the private secretary of a field marshal who required assistance in writing his memoirs. This position does not leave Cournot with considerable time for his own pursuits, for in the course of his ten years in the field marshal's employment he took two doctoral degrees, one in mechanics and one in astronomy. In addition, he published a number of articles and even acquired a degree in law.\n\nSubsequently, Cournot held positions as professor of mathematics, chief examiner for undergraduate students, and rector of Dijon Academy.\n\nBy the time Cournot died in 1877, he was nearly blind.\n\nCournot was mainly a mathematician, but did have some influence over economics. His theories on monopolies and duopolies are still famous. In 1838 the book \"Researches on the Mathematical Principles of the Theory of Wealth\" was published, in which he used the application of the formulas and symbols of mathematics in economic analysis. This book was highly criticized and not very successful during Cournot's lifetime. He did attempted to rewrite it twice. However, it still has influence in economics today. Today many economists believe this book to be the point of departure for modern economic analysis. Cournot introduced the ideas of functions and probability into economic analysis. He derived the first formula for the rule of supply and demand as a function of price and in fact was the first to draw supply and demand curves on a graph, anticipating the work of Alfred Marshall by roughly thirty years. The Cournot duopoly model developed in his book also introduced the concept of a (pure strategy) Nash equilibrium, the Reaction function and best-response dynamics.\n\nCournot believed that economists must utilize the tools of mathematics only to establish probable limits and to express less stable facts in more absolute terms. He further held that the practical uses of mathematics in economics do not necessarily involve strict numerical precision.\n\nToday, Cournot's work is recognized in econometrics. He was also a teacher of political economy and mathematics to Auguste Walras, who was the father of Léon Walras. Cournot and Auguste Walras persuaded Léon Walras to try political economics. Cournot is also credited to be one of the sources of inspiration for Léon Walras and his equilibrium theory.\n\nIn the field of economics he is best known for his work in the field of oligopoly theory—Cournot competition which is named after him.\n\n\n"}

Committees were established in each workplace. They were inspired by the Committees for the Defense of the Revolution in Cuba, and functioned as \"organs of political and social control.\"\n\nTwo decades after decolonization from France, the Republic of Upper Volta had suffered numerous military regimes and uprisings (primarily led by the strong trade unionist movement). In 1982 Major Dr. Jean-Baptiste Ouédraogo overthrew the government of Colonel Saye Zerbo, instituting the rule of the Council of Popular Salvation (CSP). Factional infighting developed between moderates in the CSP and the radicals, led by Captain Thomas Sankara, a war veteran who was appointed Prime Minister in January 1983.\n\nSankara was arrested soon afterwards, which triggered a coup on 4 August 1983 organized by among others Captain Blaise Compaoré. Sankara was released, and made President. The National Council for the Revolution (CNR) was formed to rule the country. Within short he began implementing a radical programme of social, cultural, economic and political reform, which he dubbed the \"Democratic and Popular Revolution\" (, or RDP).\n\nThe policies enacted by Sankara included the abolition of tribal chiefs' privileges, heavy advances in women's rights, anti-HIV/AIDS efforts, anti-corruption campaigns, a foreign policy based on anti-imperialism, land redistribution from feudal landlords to the peasantry, mass vaccinations of children, a nationwide literacy campaign, the promotion of reforestation, and so on. Upper Volta was renamed Burkina Faso, to promote a new national identity. In order to achieve this radical transformation of society, he increasingly exerted government control over the nation, eventually banning trade unions and the independent press. Corrupt officials, \"lazy workers\" and supposed counter-revolutionaries were tried publicly in the Popular Revolutionary Tribunals.\n\nOne primary tool of implementing the \"Democratic and Popular Revolution\" was the Committees for the Defense of the Revolution. They were formed in 1983, having been mentioned in Sankara's first speech following the coup – he called on \"the Voltaic people to form Committees for the Defense of the Revolution everywhere in order to fully participate in the CNR's great patriotic struggle and to prevent our enemies here and abroad from harming our people.\" Sankara, heavily inspired by Che Guevara and the Cuban Revolution, modelled them after the \"Comités de Defensa de la Revolución\" of Cuba, a network of neighbourhood committees across the island. Formed by Fidel Castro in 1960, they were dubbed by Castro a \"collective system of revolutionary vigilance\".\n\nThe Burkinabé CDRs, however, took a wider approach – Sankara intended them to serve as a new foundation of society, a platform for popular mobilization which would revolutionize life in Burkina Faso and restructure its social space on a local level. This goal of restructuring the basic functions of society was carried out by the Committees for the Defense of the Revolution through attempting to mobilize the masses, and to carry out political education. Involving the people in governance was also portrayed as \"the best way to avoid the army seizing power for itself\", and as such the CDRs were endowed with administrative, economic and judicial responsibilities.\n\nSome have viewed the Committees for the Defense of the Revolution far less benevolently, enacting thuggery rather than social revolution. It has been alleged that the CDRs were formed to intimidate and weaken the trade unions as well as other established interest groups. The Ugandan Catholic priest Emmanuel Katongole has written that the CDRs operated as \"administrative tentacles and vigilante groups rather than incubators or exemplars of what a genuinely transformed new society might look like.\" Others have described the CDRs as slowly falling into such activities rather than being formed for them, deteriorating from popular mass organizations into gangs of armed thugs which clashed with trade unionists.\n\nIn Ghana, ruled by the military junta of Jerry Rawlings and the Provisional National Defence Council, groups likewise dubbed the Committees for the Defense of the Revolution were instituted on 31 December 1984, possibly inspired by the Burkinabé variant of the name. These were intended to \"act as watchdogs against corruption\", and replaced the previous People's and Workers' Defence Committees. Rawlings, a close friend of Thomas Sankara, would eventually adopt conservative and right-wing policies rather than radical left-wing such.\n\nOn 15 October 1987 Sankara was killed by a group of military officers, in a \"coup d'état\" organised by his former colleague and friend, Blaise Compaoré. Despite knowledge of the revolutionary's death spreading, some Committees for the Defense of the Revolution mounted an armed resistance to the army for several days. Compaoré, who would go on to rule Burkina Faso for almost three decades before being ousted from power by the 2014 Burkinabé uprising (at least partially inspired by Thomas Sankara), immediately set out to reverse most of the reforms made in the name of the \"Democratic and Popular Revolution\". Among other changes, the Committees for the Defense of the Revolution were quickly abolished.\n\n"}

A slowdown is an industrial action in which employees perform their duties but seek to reduce productivity or efficiency in their performance of these duties. A slowdown may be used as either a prelude or an alternative to a strike, as it is seen as less disruptive as well as less risky and costly for workers and their union.\n\nDe-policing represents a de facto police strike, in which the police withdraw an aspect of their crime prevention services. It is a practical police protest at perceived political interference in their day-to-day task of policing.\n\nAuthor Heather Mac Donald has offered yet another interpretation for the term \"de-policing\". In her book, \"The War on Cops\", she uses the term as the antithesis for pro-active policing in general. In the light of the Eric Garner case in Staten Island, NY and criticism of \"Broken Windows\" policing, MacDonald has used this term to describe the NYPD's policy of backing away from actively pursuing Stop and Frisk procedures as a primary method of crime prevention. Recent court decisions like \"Ligon\" and \"Floyd\" have also contributed to the atmosphere of de-policing in many cities of the country, but particularly New York City. Cities like Ferguson, MO and Baltimore, MD have been similarly affected due to what is perceived as unfair and aggressive policing in minority communities.\n\n\n"}

His work raised the credibility of artificial intelligence in other areas of computer science and computer engineering, influencing fields ranging from human-computer interaction to operating systems. His research helped establish the link between artificial intelligence and decision science. As an example, he coined the concept of bounded optimality, a decision-theoretic approach to bounded rationality.\n\nHe studied the use of probability and utility to guide automated reasoning for decision making. The methods include consideration of the solving of streams of problems in environments over time. In related work, he applied probability and machine learning to identify hard problems and to guide theorem proving.\n\nHe has issued long-term challenge problems for AI—and has espoused a vision of open-world AI, where machine intelligences have the ability to understand and perform well in the larger world where they encounter situations they have not seen before.\n\nHe has explored synergies between human and machine intelligence, with methods that learn about the complementarities between people and AI.

The study considered the nature and timing of AI successes and reviewed concerns about directions with AI developments, including the potential loss of control over computer-based intelligences, and also efforts that could reduce concerns and enhance long-term societal outcomes. The study was the first meeting of AI scientists to address concerns about superintelligence and loss of control of AI and attracted interest by the public.\n\nIn coverage of the Asilomar study, he said that scientists must study and respond to notions of superintelligent machines and concerns about artificial intelligence systems escaping from human control. In a later NPR interview, he said that investments in scientific studies of superintelligences would be valuable to guide proactive efforts even if people believed that the probability of losing of control of AI was low because of the cost of such outcomes.\n\nIn 2014, Horvitz defined and funded with his wife the One Hundred Year Study of Artificial Intelligence at Stanford University. According to Horvitz, the gift, which may increase in the future, is sufficient to fund the study for a century. A Stanford press release stated that sets of committees over a century will \"study and anticipate how the effects of artificial intelligence will ripple through every aspect of how people work, live and play.\" A framing memo for the study calls out 18 topics, including monitoring and addressing possibilities of superintelligences and loss of control of AI.\n\nIn 2014, the committee to choose the panelists to write reports was led by Horvitz, and included:\n\nHorvitz's white paper outlining the project suggested 18 areas for consideration, including law, ethics, the economy, war, and crime.\n\nAs of 2016, the panel consists of 17 tech leaders, including executives from Google, Facebook, Microsoft and IBM, and is chaired by Peter Stone of the University of Texas.

The panel advocated for increased public and private spending on the industry, recommended increased AI expertise at all levels of government, and recommended against blanket government regulation. Panel chair Peter Stone argues that AI won’t automatically replace human workers, but rather, will supplement the workforce and create new jobs in tech maintenance. Panelists stated that military A.I. applications were outside their current scope and expertise; in \"Foreign Policy\", Mark Hagerott asked the panelists to give more consideration to security in the future, complaining that \"AI and cyber crime get (only) \"passing reference in the context of credit card crime\" in this report\".\n\nWhile mainly focusing on the next fifteen years, the report was dismissive that superintelligent AI would ever be a threat to humanity, and made the controversial claim that superhuman robots are probably not \"even possible\". Stone stated that \"it was a conscious decision not to give credence to this in the report.\"\n\nHe served as founding co-chair of an effort to establish the Partnership on AI, an organization that brought Amazon, Facebook, DeepMind, Google, IBM, and Microsoft together to found and fund a non-profit, multi-stakeholder organization.

He is best known for his posthumous work \"The Varieties of Reference\" (1982), edited by John McDowell. The book considers different kinds of reference to objects, and argues for a number of conditions that must obtain for reference to occur.\n\nGareth Evans was born in London on 12 May 1946. He was educated at Dulwich College and University College, Oxford (1964–67) where he read Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE). His philosophy tutor was Peter Strawson, one of the most eminent Oxford philosophers of the time. Evans became close friends with philosopher Derek Parfit and other prominent members of his academic field such as Christopher Peacocke and Crispin Wright. He was a senior scholar at Christ Church, Oxford (1967–68) and a Kennedy Scholar at Harvard University and University of California, Berkeley (1968–69). He died in Oxford in 1980 of lung cancer at the age of 34. His collected papers (1985) and a book, \"The Varieties of Reference\" (1982), edited by John McDowell, were published posthumously.\n\nThe \"Oxford Companion to Philosophy\" writes \"Evans's untimely death was a great loss for British philosophy\". In the acknowledgements of his \"Reasons and Persons\" (Oxford University Press, 1984), Derek Parfit writes 'I owe much to the intensity of his love of truth, and his extraordinary vitality.'\n\nIn his brief career Evans made substantial contributions to logic, metaphysics, philosophy of language, and philosophy of mind. Aside from Strawson, Michael Dummett and John McDowell were important influences on his work.\n\nEvans was one of many in the UK who took up the project of developing formal semantics for natural languages, instigated by Donald Davidson in the 1960s and 1970s. He co-edited \"Truth and Meaning\" (1976) with John McDowell on this subject. He also wrote a paper, \"The Causal Theory of Names\" (1973), which heavily criticised certain lines of the theory of reference that derived from Saul Kripke's \"Naming and Necessity\" (1972/1980) and work by Keith Donnellan.\n\nA one-page paper in \"Analysis\", \"Can There Be Vague Objects?\" (1978), drew dozens of papers in response and is now considered a key work in metaphysics.\n\nEvans's book \"The Varieties of Reference\" (1982) was unfinished at the time of his death. It was edited for publication, and supplemented with appendices drawn from his notes, by McDowell, and has subsequently been influential in both philosophy of mind and philosophy of language.\n\nThe theory of reference prior to the 1970s was dominated by the view that the meaning of an ordinary name is a description of its object: so, for example, \"Aristotle\" means \"the author of \"De Caelo\".\" This was Russell's view, and was and is taken by many to be equivalent to Frege's view (where the \"description\" is what Frege calls a term's \"sense\"). Following Kripke's \"Naming and Necessity\" (1972/1980) lectures, the view came to prevail that names had no descriptive content, or sense: that the referent of a name was not what \"fit\" its meaning, but whichever object had been the initial cause of the name's being used.\n\nEvans concedes that names do not in general have descriptive meanings (although he contends that they could, in some cases), but argues that the proponents of the new theory had much too simplistic a view. He argues for what he calls \"Russell's Principle\": that a person cannot be thinking about an object unless he knows, in some non-trivial way, which object he is thinking about. In particular, Evans argues that a person must have a \"discriminating conception\" of the object (1982, p. 65).\n\nFrom Russell's work, Evans also draws the point that some of the thoughts one has (thoughts about objects one is perceiving, for example) are such that if their object did not exist it would not be possible to think that thought at all. These he calls \"Russellian thoughts\".\n\nHe then claims that a certain version of the new theory, which he calls the \"Photograph Model\" of mental representation (1982, p. 78), violates Russell's Principle. According to the Photograph Model, \"the causal antecedents of the information involved in a mental state... are claimed to be sufficient to determine which object the state concerns\" (1982, p. 78). (The view is so named because it is similar to the view many people take on how a photograph comes to be about something.) Thus, on the Photograph Model, contrary to Russell's Principle, one may have a thought about some object without discriminating knowledge of that object, just so long as the mental state is caused in the appropriate way (for example, perhaps by some sort of causal chain that originates with the object).\n\nEvans argues that any causal theory, like that of the Photograph Model, must be restricted in certain ways: it is necessary to consider, one by one, the various kinds of Russellian thoughts people can have about objects, and to specify in each case what conditions must be met for them to meet Russell's Principle—only under those conditions can one have a thought about a specific object or objects (a \"singular thought\").\n\nIn particular, Evans discusses at length what he calls the \"Generality Constraint\". Evans states it thus:\n\n...if a subject can be credited with the thought that \"a\" is \"F\", then he must have the conceptual resources for entertaining the thought that \"a\" is \"G\", for every property of being \"G\" of which he has a conception (1982, p. 104).\n\nThe Generality Constraint, according to Evans, is intended to capture the structure that there is in thought. As Evans puts it, \"The thought that John is happy has something in common with the thought that Harry is happy, and the thought that John is happy has something in common with the thought that John is sad\" (1982, p. 100). The Generality Constraint requires that if one is to have a thought (that John is happy, for example) about an object (John), then one must be able to conceive of the object (John) as having different properties (such as being sad).\n\nHe also defends a reading of Frege, derived in part from Michael Dummett's work, according to which Frege's notion of sense is not equivalent to a description, and indeed remains essential to a theory of reference that abandoned descriptivism (1982, §1.3).\n\nThe bulk of the text considers three kinds of reference to objects, and argues for a number of conditions that must obtain for reference to occur.\n\nHe considers first demonstrative reference, where one speaks or thinks about an object visible in one's vicinity. He argues that these presuppose, among other things: having a correct conception of the kind of object that it is; the ability to conceive of it and oneself as located in an objective space, and to orient oneself within that space; that one must move smoothly through time and space and be able to track the object's movements continuously in perception.\n\nHe next considers reference to oneself and then reference by way of a capacity for recognition: one's ability to (re-)identify an object when presented with it, even if it is not available at present. Evans famously considers the phenomenon of \"Immunity to Error Through Misidentification\"—a phenomenon of certain types of judgment in which one cannot be wrong about which object the judgment is about by misidentifying it (see his 1982, especially §6.6 & §7.2). This phenomenon may be exemplified by the incoherence of the following judgment (upon feeling pain): \"Someone seems to be feeling pain, but is it \"I\" who is feeling the pain?\". While this phenomenon has been noticed by philosophers before, Evans argues that they have tended to think that it only applies to judgments concerning oneself and one's conscious experiences, and so they have failed to recognise that it is a more general phenomenon that can occur in any sort of demonstrative judgment. Furthermore, he would charge philosophers such as Ludwig Wittgenstein (in his \"Blue and Brown Books\" [1958]) and Elizabeth Anscombe (in her \"The First Person\" [1975]) for having wrongly concluded that such cases show that the first-person pronoun \"I\" does not refer to anything.\n\nIn the last third of the book Evans turns to problems with reference to objects that actively depend on the use of language. Here he treats the use of proper names, which do not seem to presuppose as much knowledge on the part of the speaker as demonstrative or recognition-based identification. One can refer to an object one has never encountered using a name if the name was received in the right sort of linguistic (social) practice—even, apparently, if one has no true beliefs about the object. He also considers problems of reference to objects in fictions and hallucinations, and to the meaning of saying that something exists which doesn't. (Here he draws explicitly on Kripke's John Locke lectures, \"Reference and Existence\").\n\n\n\n"}

As an extraordinary charism, gifts of healing are supernatural enablements given to a believer to minister various kinds of healing and restoration to individuals through the power of the Holy Spirit. In the Greek of the New Testament, both the words \"gift\" and \"healing\" are plural. \n\nIn the Gospel of Mark's account of the Great Commission, Jesus stated that one of the signs to follow believers in him would be healing after the laying on of hands. In the fifth chapter of the Epistle of James, anointing with oil is involved with the laying on of hands and prayer over the sick. These symbolize that believers were channels of divine power and that the healing was the work of the Holy Spirit. Healing is also connected with the forgiveness of sins.\n\nPentecostal and charismatic Christians believe \"that God has made provision that physical healing would be a ministry of His church and that gifts of healings would operate along with faith\". However, they also believe that no minister of healing will heal all that come to them. Faith on the part of the one who prays is essential for healing, but many times faith on the part of one being prayed for is important as well. All Pentecostals and charismatics are encouraged to pray for the healing of the sick even if they do not claim possession of the supernatural gift.\n\n\n"}

Subsequently, the word \"Guañameñe\" was extended to denominate the highest priestly rank of the Guanche society.\n\nThe story about the fortune-teller Guañameñe is mainly due to the friar Alonso de Espinosa, who in his work \"Historia de Nuestra Señora de Candelaria\" mentions that the Guanches had been warned by the fortuneteller that some white people were to come inside large birds by the sea. According to the Dominican, Guañameñe would have prophesied these facts a century before the arrival of the Castilians in 1494, and was the reason that the mencey of Taoro ordered the rest of Guanche kings to notify him if any foreigner arrived on the shores of the Island, something that the one of Güímar did when appearing on its beaches the image of the Virgin of Candelaria.\n\nFor his part, Antonio de Viana turns the fortune-teller Guañameñe into a character in his epic \"Conquista de Tenerife\" published in 1604. In this work narrates that the fortune-teller asks the mencey Bencomo of Taoro, who is in the audience, and predicts that foreigners would arrive from the sea and that they would rule the island. This upsets the mencey, who responds by ordering Guañameñe to be hanged from a tree.\n\nGuañameñe also refers to the highest rank of priest or shaman Guanche (high priest) who advised the aboriginal monarchs, called menceyes, on the island of Tenerife before the Castilian conquest.\n\nThe Guañameñes enjoyed a high social consideration and had a great knowledge of oral tradition and interpreted natural and celestial phenomena. Possibly they had a great influence in the political control. They presided over the assemblies or Tagoror.\n\nAccording to Bethencourt Alfonso, the Guañameñes wore black and wore an amulet or idol called Guatimac.\n\nCurrently the term \"Guañameñe\" is used as a reference to the highest priestly caste of the Neopagan organization called Church of the Guanche People.\n"}

{"id": "5804554", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5804554", "title": "Hippias Major", "text": "Hippias Major\n\nHippias Major (or What is Beauty? or Greater Hippias (, \"Hippías meízōn\"), to distinguish it from the \"Hippias Minor\", which has the same chief character) is one of the dialogues of Plato. It belongs to the early dialogues, written while the author was still young. Its precise date is uncertain, although a date of c. 390 BC has been suggested; its authenticity has been doubted.\n\nIn the \"Hippias Major\", Socrates and Hippias set out to find a definition for \"beauty\", but are destined to fail due to their inability to formulate an answer which encompasses the entire concept. The actual Greek term that is used in the dialogue is καλόν, which as an adjective often means fine or noble as well as beautiful. For this reason, translators such as Paul Woodruff typically translate the term (τὸ καλόν—the abstract noun of the adjective) as \"the Fine\" (things) instead of \"Beauty.\"\n\nAs in \"Charmides\", \"Lysis\" and \"Euthyphro\", \"Hippias Major\" has an \"anatreptic\" purpose, that is, the result of the dialogue is to defeat commonly held opinions, without necessarily offering a resolution. The concept of something good in and of itself (if only obliquely) makes its first appearance in this work. The dialogue can be read as much as a serious philosophical work as a light satirical comedy with two actors. The astuteness of Socrates in taking refuge under the authority of a supposed third protagonist in order to direct biting criticism at Hippias, endows the dialogue with humour.\n\n\nHippias, whose business had kept him away from Athens for a long time, arrives in the city to give a lecture at Pheidostratus's school in the next few days. He meets Socrates, and the latter asks him why such a precious and wise man as Hippias has deprived the Athenians of his presence for so long. It is, explains the great Sophist, because his native Elis was so in need of his services, and entrusted him with several important diplomatic missions to different cities; notably in Sparta. He made use of his travels throughout the Greek world to educate a large number of youth and earn large sums of money. One such example was the small town of Inycus, in Sicily, where the modest inhabitants sacrificed a good part of their savings to see their children educated.\n\nSocrates ironically assures him that this is all admirable. And if Hippias has spent such a large part of his time in Sparta, he asks, this must be where he earned the most? But Hippias demurs: he did not touch an obolus there. It was not because the Spartans did not wish the best possible education for their children, and not because they did not comprehend the true value of Hippias. The only reason was that \"it is not the inherited usage of the Lacedaemonians to change their laws or to educate their children differently from what is customary.\"\n\nHowever, Socrates emphasized, the law is precisely made for use and happiness of the citizens, two things to which Hippias would have been greatly able to contribute. By being too attached to the law and refusing the services of Hippias, the Spartans contradict the aim of their own laws and thus therefore could be considered as being unlawful. Hippias agrees. Socrates then asks him then how he nevertheless had so much success in this severe city of Laconia. It is not, Hippias answers, for his knowledge of arithmetic or astronomy, but rather \"They are very fond of hearing about the genealogies of heroes and men, Socrates, and the foundations of cities in ancient times and, in short, about antiquity in general...[these being] beautiful pursuits\".\n\nSocrates is happy that Hippias came to reminisce on beautiful things, because this is a subject that interests Socrates greatly and with good reason. Recently, according to the latter, while criticising the beauty or ugliness of part of speeches, he claims to have been harassed by an acquaintance, who reproached him for not really knowing the definition of beauty. Thus embarrassed by this exposure, Socrates claims to be delighted that finally one as competent as Hippias will be able to provide his opinion on the nature of beauty. The great Sophist, flattered, does not object; and is goaded on by Socrates, who offers to reprise the discussion, playing the part of the harasser. This role-play on the part of Socrates adds to the comic nature of dialogue.\n\nHippias first response is: \"For be assured, Socrates, if I must speak the truth, a beautiful maiden is beautiful \". Socrates estimates this to be, with his usual irony, a brilliant answer. But cannot they say that a lyre, a horse or even a pot is beautiful? The most beautiful of pots of course would not stand up to comparison with a beautiful girl, but then in turn what is the beauty of a girl in comparison to that of a goddess? In short, there is an infinite number of beautiful things besides beautiful girls. In any case, this is not really the question; it is not a question of knowing what is beautiful and what is not, but rather to define beauty and to say what makes beautiful things \"beautiful\".\n\nThe second response offered by Hippias is: \"This that you ask about, the beautiful, is nothing else but gold... For we all know, I fancy, that wherever this is added, even what before appears ugly will appear beautiful when adorned with gold.\"No doubt, replies Socrates, but what to make then of the great statue of Athena at the Parthenon? This masterpiece of Phidias is mostly made of ivory and precious stones, and not of gold. Yet the statue is magnificent. Besides, gold or any other precious metal only gives rise to beauty if it is properly used. In the case of the pot, for instance, who is to say whether a wooden spoon or a golden spoon would be better to stir with, or which would be more beautiful?\n\nThis time Hippias thinks that he understands: Socrates wants to know what no man will ever find ugly: \"I say, then, that for every man and everywhere it is most beautiful to be rich and healthy, and honoured by the Greeks, to reach old age, and, after providing a beautiful funeral for his deceased parents, to be beautifully and splendidly buried by his own offspring.\" A scene follows, where Socrates shows his fear of the beating with a stick he would receive from his harasser if he had given that answer. What then of Achilles or Heracles? Was it beautiful for these two heroes, sons of the immortals, to be buried before their parents, before the gods? Was there no beauty in their lives because they were not buried by their offspring? Beauty in this sense then applies to ordinary men, but it would be ugliness for heroes. The definition is thus incorrect.\n\nTiring of the errors of Hippias, Socrates offers a definition in his turn, which he holds came from his famous harasser: the beautiful is simply that which is appropriate. This response pleases Hippias. But further examination is needed: first of all, is it the appropriateness which makes things beautiful, or does it simply make them appear to be beautiful? The second hypothesis is tempting: even a ridiculous man, dressed in nice clothing, will appear more beautiful. But inside he would still be ridiculous; thus appropriate and beautiful are not the same.\n\nHippias suggests that appropriateness provides at the same time the reality and the appearance of beauty. But then, nothing could be less sure; if everything was that simple, citizens and politicians would no longer have to quarrel to decide which action was the nicer.\n\nSocrates proposes a second solution: if it is beautiful, is it useful? But here again problems surface: it is through power that men make things useful. Nevertheless, as is well known, power can as much serve evil as it serves good. And there is difficulty in qualifying actions as bad or good. Which in turn requires that the definition be refocused; beauty is only usefulness applied to good ends, or those that are \"favourable\".\n\nIdentifying the beautiful and the favourable leads to a paradox: the favourable procreates the beautiful, as a father procreates a son. Since the favourable and the beautiful are thus considered to be one and the same, they arrive at the finding that beauty is the reason of goodness. In logic, a cause and an effect are two different things, as a father is different from the son. And thus they must conclude that Beauty is not good, and good is not beauty; an assertion which pleases neither Socrates nor Hippias.\n\nTo conclude, Socrates brings out a final definition; at first glance quite amazing: \"[what] if we were to say that that is beautiful which makes us feel joy ; I do not mean all pleasures, but that which makes us feel joy through hearing and sight?\" This hypothesis, while appealing, contains according to Socrates himself a fundamental flaw; that it ignores the beauty of the more noble pleasures, drawn from the studious occupations or the study of laws.\n\nOn the other hand, it seems striking that only the senses of sight and hearing are taken into account. Is this a way to submit to common opinion, which is that touch, taste and smell are somehow more shameful and base than the other senses? Finally, it is not simply because pleasure comes from seeing or hearing that it is beautiful. Socrates throws himself into a series of considerations: taking into account pairs of objects, in the Majority of cases the term which they apply to both objects (A and B are beautiful, A and B are just) can apply also to an object taken separately (A is beautiful and B is beautiful). But in some rare cases it can happen that it this is not the case, notably when the sum of A and B forms an even number and A and B, taken in isolation, are two odd numbers.\n\nIn the case of beauty, it is the first category that is appropriate, because if a pair of two objects is beautiful, it stands to reason that each of them is. But a new paradox appears, since the beautiful, in discreet definition, must belong to both pleasures of sight and hearing, taken jointly, and cannot belong to only one of them. The definition as a result proves to be flawed. Exhausted by the many questions they have considered, Hippias berates Socrates and urges him instead of \"\"with mere talk and nonsense\" to seek beauty in \"the ability to produce a discourse well and beautifully in a court of law or a council-house or before any other public body before which the discourse may be delivered.\"\nSocrates, taking his leave, pretends to feel bad about the situation, cornered between the attacks of Hippias and those of his mysterious opponent. His only certainty, he concludes with a sense of humour, is that from now on he better understands the Greek proverb \"beautiful things are difficult\"\"\n\nThe authorship of \"Hippias Major\" has been in dispute. Although some works previously attributed to Plato have been determined to be inauthentic, this is one where authorship has still not been firmly established, though academic consensus tends toward its authenticity. The argument is summarized in (Sider 1977): \"Dorothy Tarrant is the foremost advocate for the cause of spuriousness: cf. her edition of \"The Hippias Major Attributed to Plato\" (Cambridge, 1928). Opposing her in a series of articles is G.M.A. Grube, who wrote in 1926 and 1927. W. K. C. Guthrie, in \"A History of Greek Philosophy\" (Cambridge 1975) also argues for its genuineness.\" Sider, writing in 1992 states that G. R. Ledger, in \"Re-counting Plato\" (Oxford 1989) carried out a computer text analysis and though not conclusive \"\"On balance the evidence for genuineness is fairly convincing\". He goes on to state that amongst other recent works, P. Woodruff, \"Plato: Hippias Major\" (Oxford 1982) also argues for authenticity and dates the document to \"around 390\"\" BC.\n\nC. H. Kahn, \"The Beautiful and the Genuine,\" \"OSAP\" 3 (1985:261–87) is the lone modern figure maintaining spuriousness. The Internet Encyclopaedia of Philosophy states \"Of those [of Plato's works] we listed as authentic, above (in the early group), only the \"Hippias Major\" continues occasionally to be listed as inauthentic. The strongest evidence against the authenticity of the \"Hippias Major\" is the fact that it is never mentioned in any of the ancient sources. In summary then, although early 20th century scholarship argued that it was spurious, latest research indicates that on the balance it is more likely authentic than not.\n\n\n\n"}

Existing concepts are contradictory in many details, beginning with the central point—whether compatibility is caused by matching psychological parameters or by their complementarity. At the same time, the idea of interpersonal compatibility is analyzed in non-scientific fields (see, e.g., Astrological compatibility).\n\nAmong existing psychological tools for studying and/or measuring interpersonal compatibility, the following are noteworthy:\n\nSocionics has proposed a theory of intertype relationships between psychological types based on a modified version of C.G. Jung's theory of psychological types. Communication between types is described using the concept of information metabolism proposed by Antoni Kępiński. Socionic data are much more representative than, e.g., those of Ackoff and Emery. Socionics allocates 16 types of the relations — from most attractive and comfortable up to disputed. The understanding of a nature of these relations helps to solve a number of problems of the interpersonal relations, including aspects of psychological and sexual compatibility. The researches of married couples by Aleksandr Bukalov et al., have shown that the family relations submit to the laws, which are opened by socionics. The study of socionic type allocation in casually selected married couples confirmed the main rules of the theory of intertype relations in socionics. So, the dual relations (full addition) make 45% and the intraquadral relations make 64% of investigated couples.\n\nAlternative hypotheses of intertype relationships were later proposed by adherents of MBTI (D. Keirsey's hypothesis of compatibility between Keirsey temperaments). Neither of these hypotheses are commonly accepted in the Myers–Briggs type indicator theory. MBTI in Russia is often confused with socionics, although the 16 types in these theories are described differently and do not correlate exactly.\n\nThe following problems may be reasons for the absence of a theory of psychological compatibility:\n\nIt has been suggested that MHC plays a role in the selection of potential mates, via olfaction. MHC genes make molecules that enable the immune system to recognize invaders; generally, the more diverse the MHC genes of the parents, the stronger the immune system of the offspring. It would therefore be beneficial to have evolved systems of recognizing individuals with different MHC genes and preferentially selecting them to breed with.\n\nYamazaki et al. (1976) showed this to be the case for male mice, which show a preference for females of different MHC. Similar results have been obtained with fish.\n\nIn 1995, Swiss biologist Claus Wedekind determined MHC influences both body odors and body odor preferences in humans, and that the women's preferences depend on their hormonal status. In an experiment, a group of female college students smelled T-shirts that had been worn by male students for two nights, without deodorant, cologne or scented soaps. Overwhelmingly, the women preferred the odors of men with dissimilar MHCs to their own. However, their preference was reversed if they were taking oral contraceptives. The hypothesis is that MHCs affect mate choice and that oral contraceptives can interfere with the preference for variation. A study in 2005 on 58 test subjects confirmed that taking oral contraceptives made women prefer men with MHCs similar to their own. Several follow up studies have confirmed the belief that paternally inherited HLA-associated odors influence odor preference and may serve as social cues. In 2008, Peter Donnelly and colleagues proposed that MHC is related to mating choice in some human populations.\n\nComplementarity in social psychology is defined on the basis of the interpersonal circle (Carson, 1969), according to which interpersonal behaviors fall on a circle with two dimensions, namely dominance (i.e. dominant–submissive) and warmth (i.e. hostile–friendly). It states that each interpersonal behavior invites certain responses of another interactant. The behavior and the response it invites are said to be complementary (Horowitz, Dryer, & Krasnoperova, 1997) when friendly behavior begets hostile behavior, and dominant behavior begets submissive behavior. When people fail to give the invited response, it is said to be a non-complementary interaction. If the first person's behavior invites a reaction from the second person that matches the second person's goals, then the second person is satisfied; otherwise, the second person is frustrated (Dryer & Horowitz, 1997).\n\n\n\n\n"}

Jing zuo can also be described as a form of spiritual self-cultivation that helps a person achieve a more fulfilling life (\"6-Great Traditions\").\n\nLiterally speaking, the term Jing zuo simply means 'sitting quietly', but the collocation soon acquired more specific meanings, referring to methods of quiet sitting that were practiced for medical or spiritual purposes. In early sources, such as the philosophical work Hanfeizi in the 3rd century BCE, Jing zuo seems to have been mainly understood as being of benefit to health, but some centuries later spiritual practices were also referred to using this term. At the outset, it was not limited to Confucianism, but could equally well be used about Buddhist and Daoist practices. The term became widely used in the Song dynasty and became the preferred term for seated meditation among Neo-Confucians, who tended to avoid more narrowly Buddhist or Daoist terms. In modern Western parlance, it often refers specifically to Neo-Confucian forms of meditation, but it is also used for other religious and non-religious practices.\n\nThe concept of meditation was not a major aspect of the Confucian life until the Neo-Confucian era. At this time Buddhism and Daoism had begun to expand into China and started to influence some aspects of Chinese culture. Even though there are some similarities, there are also some fundamental differences. Confucian meditation, unlike Daoist and Buddhist meditation, does not require the stopping of rational thought, but instead relies upon disciplined attention to one's current situation and mental phenomena. Its purpose is to develop as an individual in order to find full realization. (Johnston 2006) As Zhu Xi notes in [Reflections on Things at Hand]: \"Whenever you have to attend to your daily affairs, or undertake any matter, always spend some time in meditation and everything will be all right\" (Zhu Xi, 4:25).\n\nA central aspect of Confucian meditation is Jing zuo or quiet sitting. Again, there is a fundamental difference between Neo-Confucians and Buddhist or Daoist meditation, in respect to Jing zuo (quiet sitting). \"Neo-Confucians argued that quiet sitting was oriented to this world and aimed at perfecting one's self, whereas Buddhist and Daoist meditation focused on forgetting the world and abandoning one's self.\" (Yao 2000, p. 222). Furthermore, \"Neo-Confucian scholars take quiet sitting (Jing zuo) to be only a way to help understand one's gain in self-cultivation and they do not see it as a means to isolate oneself from human affairs. They believe that it is only within this world and among worldly affairs that one can progress in the path of spiritual cultivation.\" (Yao 2000, p. 223).\n\nThere are two central concepts and schools of thought when it comes to Jing zuo. The two schools of thought were started by Zhu Xi (Chu Hsi) and Wang Yang-Ming. Each individual took a different approach; most would say an opposing approach. Here, each approach is examined separately.\n\nZhu Xi was very influential in the Rational School of thought. Zhu Xi's concept of li was that it is the constitution of all things, the way by which the world runs its course. This way of thinking and looking at li, when applied to Jing zuo, was that a person needed to combine both thinking and action in order to achieve enlightenment. Investigation of things and the world around you were very important aspects and teachings of Zhu Xi. \"He also believed that knowledge and action always required each other.\"(Yao, p 220). According to Zhu Xi, in order to achieve enlightenment, an individual must be actively seeking knowledge, investigating ideas/events, meditate upon them, and then investigate some more. \"According to this understanding, spiritual meditation is like a circular journey of tranquility and activity, or of preserving the mind and investigating the principle, or of knowledge and action.\" (Yao, p 220). For Zhu Xi, Jing zuo \"does not mean to 'sit still like a blockhead, with the ear hearing nothing, the eye seeing nothing, and the mind thinking of nothing.\"(Yao p 220). It meant actively searching out, investigating, and exploring the world that a person lives in.\n\nWang Yang- Ming was very influential in the Idealistic School of thought. Wang Yang-Ming disagreed with the approach that Zhu Xi had towards quiet sitting. His concept of li was that it was inside every person, and reflection on li, which was manifested in you, is the only way to enlightenment. Wang Yang-Ming believed that \"it was right to search for sagehood within and there was no need to seek it in things and affairs outside. Self-examination and inward exploration are enough for one to gain true knowledge and to be a sage.\" (Yao, p 221). Even though Wang Yang-Ming thought quiet sitting would be useful for his students he did not want it to be the only thing that they tried to accomplish. Quiet sitting was only good if it would help them to grow in virtue and learn/ reflect on how they, as a moral person, should grow.\n\nIt is said that those who practice Jing zuo can \"perceive the pristine ethical basis of human nature\" and also be able to \"grasp the essential emptiness of everything.\" (Johnston 2000). The neo-Confucians were also using Jing zuo as a method of \"practical retreat\" in order to grow and develop as individuals. This included spiritual growth as well as the personal improvement and full realization of the practitioner (Johnston 2000). It allows Confucians to practice veneration for the basic human nature and it allows them to \"nourish the seeds of moral virtue\" (Berthrong 1998). Meditation embodies the state of serenity and calmness, where the practitioner is able to free themselves from and/or becomes unaffected by their surroundings. They are able to clear and settle the heart-mind completely and are then able to assess their knowledge in an open-minded and unbiased manner (Wilson 1991): \"The Master said, 'Hui is capable of occupying his whole mind for three months on end with no thought but that of Goodness. The others can do so, some for a day, some even for a month, but that is all.`` (Analects 6.5) Jing zuo is said to be the \"complement to prayer\" (Wilson 1991) because \"While prayer directs the heart to Ultimate Reality as a transcendent object, meditation cleanses the heart of all finite objects which obscure Reality so that its ultimate point may be found within.\" (Wilson 1991). Both prayer and Jing zuo are practiced and are essential parts of spirituality in Confucianism.\n\nJing zuo is understood to complement Zhu Xi's dictum to \"investigate things\" (in order to penetrate the principle (li) of the cosmos):\nFor some, the reflection and meditation of Jing zuo must be balanced with studying of the Confucian texts. It is beneficial when Jing zuo is used alongside Confucian scholarship, as it causes the Confucian to \"center the self in service to others.\" (Berthrong 1998). Confucius himself advised against spending too much time sitting quiet and reflecting, he stressed the fact that Confucians should find a balance in their lives where they would study and reflect upon what one studies equally (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, n.d.) : \"'He who learns but does not think is lost. He who thinks but does not learn is in great danger.' (Lunyu 2.15)\" (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, n.d.).\n\n\"The Confucian transformation model starts with individual meditation and goes through personal enhancement, self-discipline, personality integrity, family integration, state governance, and reaches the excellence of universal commonwealth\" (\"Confucianism.\"). In order to achieve personal meditation, \"one must learn to rest the energy (chu chu) in order to be stabilized (ting), be still and calm (ching), reach peace (an) and be mindful (li)\" (\"Confucianism.\"). To have mindful energy, one must be \"ready to learn the truth and reveal the virtue (te)\" (\"Confucianism.\").\n\nOne form of meditation is personal meditation Qigong. Qigong is when 'one sits still and frees their own character in order to get in touch with their true or real self.' (\"Confucianism.\"). Qigong \"is a process of training the mind, body, and spirit with the aim of guiding ones thoughts so that they can prepare for further development. It aims to internalize and calm the energy (qi) and to calm the mind, body and spirit\" (\"Confucianism.\"). Another component is to desire and \"reach a peaceful state so that one can become a thoughtful person to themselves and others\" (\"Confucianism.\") around them through practicing qigong.\n\nAnother form of Confucian meditation is called Chou Won. \"Chou means to sit and Won means to forget one's self \" (\"Confucianism.\"). The person simply sits, \"lets go and allows God to work\". (Wilson 1991). Chou Wong's main focus is to \"detach the character from one's self and reach mental freedom\" (\"Confucianism.\"). This form of Confucian meditation is \"important because it teaches the practitioner many things to do with one's self: self-awareness, self-enhancement, self-discipline and self-actualization as well as learning how to find the truth and create social change\" (\"Confucianism.\").\n\nThe \"mental processes aim to rejuvenate internal virtue that leads to the insight of real self-awareness and universal energy interconnection\" (\"Confucianism.\"). A main focus of these meditations \"aim to incorporate mind, body and spirit for healing with the three main goals; disease prevention, healing, and human capacity development\" (\"Confucianism.\"). Confucian meditation is used as \"an empowerment tool for the Confucians and their family members by teaching them stress management, personal enhancement, family integration and career development\" (\"Confucianism.\").\n\nBoth schools of thought, Zhu Xi (Chu Hsi) and Wang Yang-Ming, influenced Confucian society. Both schools edited and rewrote different aspects of Confucian volumes and texts, tried to clarify concepts and ideas of Confucianism, and helped to develop the spiritual dimension of Confucians. Furthermore, both saw that it was very important to try to be a moral person; developing wisdom, loyalty, filial piety, compassion for humanity, and propriety; they lead to a better moral in society in general.\nConfucian Meditation from the Great Learning\n\n\"The Way of learning to be great consists in manifesting the clear character, loving the people, and abiding in the highest good. Only after knowing what to abide in can one be calm. Only after having been calm can one be tranquil. Only after having achieved tranquility can one have peaceful repose. Only after having peaceful repose can one begin to deliberate. Only after deliberation can the end be attained. Things have their roots and their branches. Affairs have their beginnings and their ends. To know what is first and what is last will lead one near the Way.\" (Wilson 1991)\n\n\n"}

Kokugaku scholars worked to refocus Japanese scholarship away from the then-dominant study of Chinese, Confucian, and Buddhist texts in favor of research into the early Japanese classics.\n\nWhat later became known as the \"kokugaku\" tradition began in the 17th and 18th centuries as \"kogaku\" (\"ancient studies\"), \"wagaku\" (\"Japanese studies\") or \"inishie manabi\", a term favored by Motoori Norinaga and his school. Drawing heavily from Shinto and Japan's ancient literature, the school looked back to a golden age of culture and society. They drew upon ancient Japanese poetry, predating the rise of medieval Japan's feudal orders in the mid-twelfth century, and other cultural achievements to show the emotion of Japan. One famous emotion appealed to by the \"kokugakusha\" is 'mono no aware'.\n\nThe word \"kokugaku\", coined to distinguish this school from \"kangaku\" (\"Chinese studies\"), was popularized by Hirata Atsutane in the 19th century. It has been translated as 'Native Studies' and represented a response to Sinocentric Neo-Confucian theories. Kokugaku scholars criticized the repressive moralizing of Confucian thinkers, and tried to re-establish Japanese culture before the influx of foreign modes of thought and behaviour.\n\nEventually, the thinking of kokugaku scholars influenced the sonnō jōi philosophy and movement. It was this philosophy, amongst other things, that led to the eventual collapse of the Tokugawa shogunate in 1868 and the subsequent Meiji Restoration.\n\nThe Kokugaku school held that the Japanese national character was naturally pure, and would reveal its splendour once the foreign (Chinese) influences were removed. The \"Chinese heart\" was different from the \"true heart\" or \"Japanese Heart\". This true Japanese spirit needed to be revealed by removing a thousand years of Chinese learning. It thus took an interest in philologically identifying the ancient, indigenous meanings of ancient Japanese texts; in turn, these ideas were synthesized with early Shinto and European astronomy.\n\nThe term \"kokugaku\" was used liberally by early modern Japanese to refer to the \"national learning\" of each of the world's nations. This usage was adopted into Chinese, where it is still in use today (C: \"guoxue\"). The Chinese also adopted the kokugaku term \"national essence\" (J: \"kokusui\", C: \"guocui\").\n\nAccording to scholar of religion Jason Ānanda Josephson, \"Kokugaku\" played a role in the consolidation of State Shinto in the Meiji era. It promoted a unified, scientifically grounded and politically powerful vision of Shinto against Buddhism, Christianity, and Japanese folk religions, many of which were named \"superstitions.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2792169", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2792169", "title": "Lifeworld", "text": "Lifeworld\n\nLifeworld () may be conceived as a universe of what is self-evident or given, a world that subjects may experience together. For Edmund Husserl, the lifeworld is the fundamental for all epistemological enquiries. The concept has its origin in biology and cultural Protestantism.\n\nThe lifeworld concept is used in philosophy and in some social sciences, particularly sociology and anthropology. The concept emphasizes a state of affairs in which the world is experienced, the world is lived (German \"erlebt\"). The lifeworld is a pre-epistemological stepping stone for phenomenological analysis in the Husserlian tradition.\n\nEdmund Husserl introduced the concept of the lifeworld in his \"The Crisis of European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology\" (1936):\n\nThis collective inter-subjective pool of perceiving, Husserl explains, is both universally present and, for humanity's purposes, capable of arriving at 'objective truth,' or at least as close to objectivity as possible. The 'lifeworld' is a grand theatre of objects variously arranged in space and time relative to perceiving subjects, is already-always there, and is the \"ground\" for all shared human experience. Husserl's formulation of the lifeworld was also influenced by Wilhelm Dilthey's \"life-nexus\" (German \"Lebenszusammenhang\") and Martin Heidegger's Being-in-the-world (German \"In-der-Welt-Sein\"). The concept was further developed by students of Husserl such as Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Jan Patočka, and Alfred Schütz. The lifeworld can be thought of as the horizon of all our experiences, in the sense that it is that background on which all things appear as themselves and meaningful. The lifeworld cannot, however, be understood in a purely static manner; it isn't an unchangeable background, but rather a dynamic horizon in which we \"live\", and which \"lives with us\" in the sense that nothing can appear in our lifeworld except as \"lived\".\n\nThe concept represented a turning point in Husserl's phenomenology from the tradition of Descartes and Kant. Up until then, Husserl had been focused on finding, elucidating, and explaining an absolute foundation of philosophy in consciousness, without any presuppositions except what can be found through the reflective analysis of consciousness and what is immediately present to it. Originally, all judgments of the real were to be \"bracketed\" or suspended, and then analyzed to bring to light the role of consciousness in constituting or constructing them. With the concept of the lifeworld, however, Husserl embarked on a different path, which recognizes that, even at its deepest level, consciousness is already embedded in and operating in a world of meanings and pre-judgements that are socially, culturally, and historically constituted. Phenomenology thereby became the study not just of the pure consciousness and meanings of a transcendental ego, as in Husserl's earlier work, but of consciousness and meaning in context. The lifeworld is one of the more complicated concepts in phenomenology, mainly because of its status as both personal and intersubjective.\n\nEven if a person's historicity is intimately tied up with his lifeworld, and each person thus has a lifeworld, this doesn't necessarily mean that the lifeworld is a purely individual phenomenon. In keeping with the phenomenological notion of intersubjectivity, the lifeworld can be intersubjective even though each individual \"necessarily\" carries his own \"personal\" lifeworld (\"homeworld\"); meaning is intersubjectively accessible, and can be communicated (shared by one's \"homecomrades\"). However, a homeworld is also always limited by an alienworld. The internal \"meanings\" of this alienworld \"can\" be communicated, but can never be apprehended \"as alien\"; the alien can only be appropriated or assimilated into the lifeworld, and only understood on the background of the lifeworld.\n\nThe Husserlian elucidation of lifeworld provided a starting point for the phenomenological sociology of Alfred Schütz, who tried to synthesize Husserl's phenomenology of consciousness, meaning, and the life-world with Max Weber's sociology and its focus on subjectively meaningful action. Jürgen Habermas has further developed the concept of the lifeworld in his social theory. For Habermas, the lifeworld is more or less the \"background\" environment of competences, practices, and attitudes representable in terms of one's cognitive horizon. Compared to Husserl with his focus on consciousness, however, Habermas, whose social theory is grounded in communication, focuses on the lifeworld as consisting of socially and culturally sedimented linguistic meanings. It is the lived realm of informal, culturally-grounded understandings and mutual accommodations. Rationalization and colonization of the lifeworld by the instrumental rationality of bureaucracies and market-forces is a primary concern of Habermas's two-volume \"Theory of Communicative Action\".\n\nFor Habermas, communicative action is governed by practical rationality—ideas of social importance are mediated through the process of linguistic communication according to the rules of practical rationality. By contrast, technical rationality governs \"systems\" of instrumentality, like industries, or on a larger scale, the capitalist economy or the democratic political government. Ideas of instrumental importance to a system are mediated according to the rules of that system (the most obvious example is the capitalist economy's use of currency). Self-deception, and thus systematically distorted communication, is possible only when the lifeworld has been 'colonized' by instrumental rationality, so some social norm comes into existence and enjoys legitimate power even though it is not justifiable. This occurs when means of mediating instrumental ideas gains communicative power—as when someone pays a group of people to stay quiet during a public debate, or if financial or administrative resources are used to advertise some social viewpoint. When people take the resulting consensus as normatively relevant, the lifeworld has been colonized and communication has been systematically distorted. The 'colonization' metaphor is used because the use of steering media to arrive at social consensus is not native to the lifeworld—the decision-making processes of the systems world must encroach on the lifeworld in a way that is in a sense imperialistic:\n\nThe fragmentation of consciousness associated with the two Marxist concepts of alienation and false consciousness illustrate why, in Habermas' perspective, they are merely special cases of the more general phenomenon of lifeworld colonization.\n\nSocial coordination and systemic regulation occur by means of shared practices, beliefs, values, and structures of communicative interaction, which may be institutionally based. We are inevitably lifeworldly, such that individuals and interactions draw from custom and cultural traditions to construct identities, define situations, coordinate action, and create social solidarity. Ideally this occurs by communicatively coming to understanding (German \"Verstehen\"), but it also occurs through pragmatic negotiations (compare: Seidman, 1997:197).\n\nThe lifeworld is related to further concepts such as Pierre Bourdieu's notion of \"habitus\" and to the sociological notion of everyday life.\n\nIn the course of recent constructivist discourses a discussion about the lifeworld term took place as well. Björn Kraus' relational-constructivist version of the lifeworld term considers its phenomenological roots (Husserl and Schütz), but expands it within the range of epistemological constructivist theory building. In consequence, a new approach is created, which is not only focusing on the individual perspective upon the lifeworld term, but is also taking account of social and material environmental conditions and their relevance as emphasized for example by Habermas. Essential therefore is Kraus' basic assumption that cognitive development depends on two determining factors. On the one hand a person's own reality is her subjective construct. On the other hand this construct—in spite of all subjectivity—is not random: Since a person is still linked to her environment, her own reality is influenced by the conditions of this environment (German \"Grundsätzliche Doppelbindung menschlicher Strukturentwicklung\").\n\nBuilding up on this point of view, a separation of individual perception and the social and material environmental conditions is made possible. Kraus accordingly picks up the lifeworld term, adds the term \"life conditions\" (German \"Lebenslage\") and opposes the two terms to each other.\n\nBy this means, lifeworld describes a person's subjectively experienced world, whereas life conditions describe the person's actual circumstances in life. Accordingly, it could be said that a person's lifeworld is built depending on their particular life conditions. More precisely, the life conditions include the material and immaterial living circumstances as for example employment situation, availability of material resources, housing conditions, social environment (friends, foes, acquaintances, relatives, etc.) as well as the persons physical condition (fat/thin, tall/small, female/male, healthy/sick, etc.). The lifeworld, in contrast, describes the subjective perception of these conditions. \n\nKraus uses the epistemological distinction between subjective reality and objective reality. Thus, a person's lifeworld correlates with the person's life conditions in the same way than subjective reality correlates with objective reality. The one is the insurmountable, subjective construct built depending on the other one's conditions. \n\nKraus defined lifeworld and life conditions as follows:\n\n\"Life conditions mean a person's material and immaterial circumstances of life.\"\n\n\"Lifeworld means a person's subjective construction of reality, which he or she forms under the condition of his or her life circumstances.\"\n\nThis contrasting comparison provides a conceptual specification, enabling in the first step the distinction between a subjectively experienced world and its material and social conditions and allowing in the second step to focus on these conditions' relevance for the subjective construction of reality.\n\nWith this in mind, Manfred Ferdinand, who is reviewing the lifeworld terms used by Alfred Schütz, Edmund Husserl, Björn Kraus and Ludwig Wittgenstein, concludes: Kraus' \"thoughts on a constructivist comprehension of lifeworlds contours the integration of micro-, meso- and macroscopic approaches, as it is demanded by Invernizzi and Butterwege: This integration is not only necessary in order to relate the subjective perspectives and the objective frame conditions to each other but also because the objective frame conditions obtain their relevance for the subjective lifeworlds not before they are perceived and assessed.\"\n\n\n"}

According to literary theorist Kenneth Burke, logology works through the forms of religious language and its functions in the political sphere when rhetoric acts as a symbolic action. If it is true that language is symbolic, then speech is the result of man acting as a symbol-using animal, making it necessary to understand that logology can also be defined as the study of \"words about words.\" \n\nIn rhetoric, logology focuses not in finding the truth or falseness of a statement or phrase, but rather why that particular word or string of words was chosen and how those choices influenced the way those words were interpreted and understood by the receiver. There is a belief that there is an analogy between the words chosen and the word that those words express.\n\nFor example, if theology is discourse concerning God, then there is a difference between \"God\" and the word \"God.\" In relating the definition of logology to the term \"theology,\" it then becomes clear that the correct meaning of theology is not \"words about God\" but instead \"words about the word God.\"\n"}

In her 1987 book titled, \"Families in Peril: An Agenda for Social Change\", Edelman stated, \"As adults, we are responsible for meeting the needs of children. It is our moral obligation. We brought about their births and their lives, and they cannot fend for themselves.\" Edelman serves on the board of the New York City based Robin Hood Foundation, a charitable organization dedicated to the elimination of poverty.\n\nDuring a tour by Robert Kennedy and Joseph Clark of Mississippi's poverty-ridden Delta slums in 1967, she met Peter Edelman, an assistant to Kennedy. They married on July 14, 1968. Edelman and her husband, now a Georgetown law professor, have three children: Joshua, Jonah, and Ezra. Joshua is an educational administrator; Jonah works in education advocacy and founded Stand for Children; Ezra is a television producer and director who won an Academy Award for his documentary \"\".\n\n\n\n"}

Unlike the Ten Commandments, however, the rules of the Code were not concrete rules of conduct; they were stated as the rules of attitude. For example, \"You shall not commit adultery\" of Moses loosely corresponds to \"Mutual respect in a family, concern about the upbringing of children\" of the Code.\n\nAnother notable distinction is that the Moral Code speaks in terms of the relation of a person to the society, rather than in terms of personal virtues. For example, the \"Do not steal\" may be loosely matched to \"Concern of everyone about the preservation and multiplication of the common wealth\".\n\nRussian legislator and Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov compared the moral code of the builder of communism to the Sermon on the Mount.\n\nHere are the commandments which were written as a part of the Third Party Programme:\n\n"}

Such reasons can involve things which are directly internal to the relationship, or external factors, which may or may not be within their direct control. \n\nThe couple may not be able to live or associate with each other for physical reasons (e.g. they live in different places), or for emotional reasons (e.g., they cannot relate to each other outside of a sexual relationship, perhaps sharing little in common).\n\nAdditionally, the relationship may be confused by opposing outside influences. These may be things such as current relationships with others outside of the couple concerned relationship or the disapproval of other people. They can also involve cultural reasons, such as legality in some countries of non-marital or adulterous, extra-marital, relationships, especially those outside of typical monogamous relationships such as marriage.\n\nSometimes when couples break up, one member of the relationship may regress to their former partner for comfort after a period of time.

{"id": "76176", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=76176", "title": "Pride", "text": "Pride\n\nPride is an inwardly directed emotion that carries two antithetical meanings. With a negative connotation \"pride\" refers to a foolishly and irrationally corrupt sense of one's personal value, status or accomplishments, used synonymously with hubris. With a positive connotation, \"pride\" refers to a humble and content sense of attachment toward one's own or another's choices and actions, or toward a whole group of people, and is a product of praise, independent self-reflection, and a fulfilled feeling of belonging.\n\nIn Judaism, pride is called the root of all evil.\n\nPhilosophers and social psychologists have noted that pride is a complex secondary emotion which requires the development of a sense of self and the mastery of relevant conceptual distinctions (e.g. that pride is distinct from happiness and joy) through language-based interaction with others. Some social psychologists identify the nonverbal expression of pride as a means of sending a functional, automatically perceived signal of high social status. In contrast, pride could also be defined as a lowly disagreement with the truth. One definition of pride in the former sense comes from St. Augustine: \"the love of one's own excellence\". A similar definition comes from Meher Baba: \"Pride is the specific feeling through which egoism manifests.\"\n\nPride is sometimes viewed as corrupt or as a vice, sometimes as proper or as a virtue. While some philosophers such as Aristotle (and George Bernard Shaw) consider pride (but not hubris) a profound virtue, some world religions consider pride's fraudulent form a sin, such as is expressed in Proverbs 11:2 of the Hebrew Bible. When viewed as a virtue, pride in one's abilities is known as virtuous pride, greatness of soul or magnanimity, but when viewed as a vice it is often known to be self-idolatry, sadistic contempt, vanity or vainglory. Pride can also manifest itself as a high opinion of one's nation (national pride) and ethnicity (ethnic pride).\n\n\"Proud\" comes from late Old English \"prut\", probably from Old French \"prud\" \"brave, valiant\" (11th century) (which became \"preux\" in French), from Late Latin term \"prodis\" \"useful\", which is compared with the Latin \"prodesse\" \"be of use\". The sense of \"having a high opinion of oneself\", not in French, may reflect the Anglo-Saxons' opinion of the Norman knights who called themselves \"proud\".\n\nAristotle identified pride (\"megalopsuchia\", variously translated as proper pride, greatness of soul and magnanimity) as the crown of the virtues, distinguishing it from vanity, temperance, and humility, thus:\nHe concludes then that\nBy contrast, Aristotle defined the vice of hubris as follows:\nThus, although pride and hubris are often deemed the same thing, for Aristotle and many philosophers hubris is altogether an entirely different thing from pride.\n\nIn psychological terms, positive pride is \"a pleasant, sometimes exhilarating, emotion that results from a positive self-evaluation\". It was added by Tracy et al. to the University of California, Davis, Set of Emotion Expressions (UCDSEE) in 2009, as one of three \"self-conscious\" emotions known to have recognizable expressions (along with embarrassment and shame).\n\nThe term \"fiero\" was coined by Italian psychologist Isabella Poggi to describe the pride experienced and expressed in the moments following a personal triumph over adversity. Facial expressions and gestures that demonstrate pride can involve a lifting of the chin, smiles, or arms on hips to demonstrate victory. Individuals may implicitly grant status to others based solely on their expressions of pride, even in cases in which they wish to avoid doing so. Indeed, some studies show that the nonverbal expression of pride conveys a message that is automatically perceived by others about a person's high social status in a group.\n\nBehaviorally, pride can also be expressed by adopting an expanded posture in which the head is tilted back and the arms extended out from the body. This postural display is innate as it is shown in congenitally blind individuals who have lacked the opportunity to see it in others.\n\nA common understanding of pride is that it results from self-directed satisfaction with meeting the personal goals; for example, Weiner et al. have posited that positive performance outcomes elicit pride in an individual when the event is appraised as having been caused by him alone. Moreover, Oveis et al. conceptualize pride as a display of the strong self that promotes feelings of similarity to strong others, as well as differentiation from weak others. Seen in this light, pride can be conceptualized as a hierarchy-enhancing emotion, as its experience and display helps rid negotiations of conflict.\nPride involves exhilarated pleasure and a feeling of accomplishment. It is related to \"more positive behaviors and outcomes in the area where the individual is proud\" (Weiner, 1985). Pride is generally associated with positive social behaviors such as helping others and outward promotion. Along with hope, it is also often described as an emotion that facilitates performance attainment, as it can help trigger and sustain focused and appetitive effort to prepare for upcoming evaluative events. It may also help enhance the quality and flexibility of the effort expended (Fredrickson, 2001). According to Bagozzi et al., pride can have the positive benefits of enhancing creativity, productivity, and altruism. For instance, it has been found that in terms of school achievement, pride is associated with a higher GPA in low neighborhood socioeconomic environments, whereas in more advantaged neighborhoods, pride is associated with a lower GPA.\n\nIn the field of economic psychology, pride is conceptualized in a spectrum ranging from \"proper pride\", associated with genuine achievements, and \"false pride\", which can be maladaptive or even pathological. Lea et al. have examined the role of pride in various economic situations and claim that in all cases pride is involved because economic decisions are not taken in isolation from one another, but are linked together by the selfhood of the people who take them. Understood in this way, pride is an emotional state that works to ensure that people take financial decisions that are in their long-term interests, even when in the short term they would appear irrational.\n\nExaggerated self-esteem is called \"pride\". Classical Christian theology views pride as being the result of high self-esteem, and thus high self-esteem was viewed as the primary human problem, but beginning in the 20th century, \"humanistic psychology\" diagnosed the primary human problem as low self-esteem stemming from a lack of belief in one's \"true worth\". Carl Rogers observed that most people \"regard themselves as worthless and unlovable.\" Thus, they lack self-esteem.\n\nTerry Cooper conceptualized in 2003 excessive pride (along with low self-esteem) as an important paradigm in describing the human condition. He examines and compares the Augustinian-Niebuhrian conviction that pride is primary, the feminist concept of pride as being absent in the experience of women, the humanistic psychology position that pride does not adequately account for anyone's experience, and the humanistic psychology idea that if pride emerges, it is always a false front designed to protect an undervalued self.\n\nHe considers that the work of certain neo-Freudian psychoanalysts, namely Karen Horney, offers promise in dealing with what he calls a \"deadlock between the overvalued and undervalued self\" (Cooper, 112–3).\nCooper refers to their work in describing the connection between religious and psychological pride as well as sin to describe how a neurotic pride system underlies an appearance of self-contempt and low self-esteem:\n\nThe \"idealized self,\" the \"tyranny of the should,\" the \"pride system\" and the nature of self-hate all point toward the intertwined relationship between neurotic pride and self-contempt. Understanding how a neurotic pride system underlies an appearance of self-contempt and low self-esteem. (Cooper, 112–3).\nThus, hubris, which is an exaggerated form of self-esteem, is sometimes actually a lie used to cover the lack of self-esteem the committer of pride feels deeply down.\n\nIn the King James Bible, those people exhibiting excess pride are labeled with the somewhat archaic term, \"Haughty\".\n\nHubris itself is associated with more intra-individual negative outcomes and is commonly related to expressions of aggression and hostility (Tangney, 1999). As one might expect, Hubris is not necessarily associated with high self-esteem but with highly fluctuating or variable self-esteem. Excessive feelings of hubris have a tendency to create conflict and sometimes terminating close relationships, which has led it to be understood as one of the few emotions with no clear positive or adaptive functions (Rhodwalt, et al.).\n\nSeveral studies by UC Davis psychologist Cynthia Picket about group pride, have shown that groups that boast, gloat or denigrate others tend to become a group with low social status or to be vulnerable to threats from other groups. Suggesting that \"hubristic, pompous displays of group pride might actually be a sign of group insecurity as opposed to a sign of strength,\" she states that those that express pride by being filled with humility whilst focusing on members' efforts and hard work tend to achieve high social standing in both the adult public and personal eyes.\n\nIn Germany, \"national pride\" (\"Nationalstolz\") is often associated with the former Nazi regime. Strong displays of national pride are therefore considered poor taste by many Germans. There is an ongoing public debate about the issue of German patriotism. The World Cup in 2006, held in Germany, saw a wave of patriotism sweep the country in a manner not seen for many years. Although many were hesitant to show such blatant support as the hanging of the national flag from windows, as the team progressed through the tournament, so too did the level of support across the nation. By the time the semi-final against Italy came around, the level of national pride and unity was at its highest throughout the tournament, and the hosting of the World Cup is seen to have been a great success for Germany as a nation. After the World Cup, however, the subject of patriotism became again as difficult as it had been before.\n\nAsian pride in modern slang refers mostly to those of East Asian descent, though it can include anyone of Asian descent. Asian pride was originally fragmented, as Asian nations have had long conflicts with each other, examples are the old Japanese and Chinese religious beliefs of their individual superiority. Asian pride emerged prominently during European colonialism. At one time, Europeans controlled 85% of the world's land through colonialism, resulting in anti-Western feelings among Asian nations. Today, some Asians still look upon European involvement in their affairs with suspicion. In contrast, Asian empires are prominent and are proudly remembered by adherents to Asian Pride.\n\nThere is an emerging discourse of Chinese pride which unfolds complex histories and maps of privileges and empowerments. In a deeper sense, it is a strategic positioning, aligned with approaches such as \"Asia as method\", to invite more diverse resistances in language, culture, and practices, in challenging colonial, imperial dominations, and being critical of Eurocentric epistemologies. In more specific cases, it examines the Sinophone circulations of power relations connecting the transnational to the local, for example, a particular set of Chinese-Canadian relations between China's increasing industrial materiality and output in which pride becomes an expansionist reach and mobilization of capital, Canada's active interests in tapping into Asian and Chinese labours, markets, and industrial productions, and the intersected cultural politics of 'Chinese-ness' in an East Pacific British Columbia city where 'Chinese' has been tagged as a majority-minority.\n\nBlack pride is a slogan used primarily in the United States to raise awareness for a black racial identity. The slogan has been used by African Americans of sub-Saharan African origin to denote a feeling of self-confidence, self-respect, celebrating one's heritage, and being proud of one's personal worth.\n\n\"White pride\" is a slogan used primarily in the United States for a white race identity.\n\nMad pride refers to a worldwide movement and philosophy that individuals with mental illnesses should be proud of their 'mad' identity. Mad Pride advocates mutual support and rallies in support of rights for people with mental illness. The Mad Pride movement aims to reclaim the word mad as a self-descriptor.\n\n\"Gay pride\" refers to a worldwide movement and philosophy asserting that lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals should be proud of their sexual orientation and gender identity. LGBT pride advocates work for equal \"rights and benefits\" for LGBT people. The movement has three main premises: that people should be proud of their sexual orientation and gender identity, that sexual diversity is a gift, and that sexual orientation and gender identity are inherent and cannot be intentionally altered.\n\nThe word \"pride\" is used in this case an antonym for \"shame\". \"Pride\" in this sense is an affirmation of one's self and the community as a whole. The modern \"gay pride\" movement began after the Stonewall riots of the late 1960s. In June 1970, the first pride parade in the United States commemorated the one-year anniversary of the Stonewall riots—the nearly week-long uprising between New York City youth and police officers following a raid of Stonewall Inn.\n\nIn conventional parlance, vanity sometimes is used in a positive sense to refer to a rational concern for one's personal appearance, attractiveness and dress and is thus not the same as pride. However, it also refers to an excessive or irrational belief in one's own abilities or attractiveness \"in the eyes of others\" and may in so far be compared to pride. The term Vanity originates from the Latin word \"vanitas\" meaning \"emptiness\", \"untruthfulness\", \"futility\", \"foolishness\" and \"empty pride\". Here \"empty pride\" means a fake pride, in the sense of vainglory, unjustified by one's own achievements and actions, but sought by pretense and appeals to superficial characteristics.\n\nIn many religions, vanity is considered a form of self-idolatry, in which one rejects God for the sake of one's own image, and thereby becomes divorced from the graces of God. The stories of Lucifer and Narcissus (who gave us the term narcissism), and others, attend to a pernicious aspect of vanity. In Western art, vanity was often symbolized by a peacock, and in Biblical terms, by the Whore of Babylon. During the Renaissance, vanity was invariably represented as a naked woman, sometimes seated or reclining on a couch. She attends to her hair with comb and mirror. The mirror is sometimes held by a demon or a putto. Other symbols of vanity include jewels, gold coins, a purse, and often by the figure of death himself.\nOften we find an inscription on a scroll that reads \"Omnia Vanitas\" (\"All is Vanity\"), a quote from the Latin translation of the Book of Ecclesiastes. Although that phrase, itself depicted in a type of still life, vanitas, originally referred not to obsession with one's appearance, but to the ultimate fruitlessness of man's efforts in this world, the phrase summarizes the complete preoccupation of the subject of the picture.\n\n\"The artist invites us to pay lip-service to condemning her\", writes Edwin Mullins, \"while offering us full permission to drool over her. She admires herself in the glass, while we treat the picture that purports to incriminate her as another kind of glass—a window—through which we peer and secretly desire her.\" The theme of the recumbent woman often merged artistically with the non-allegorical one of a reclining Venus.\n\nIn his table of the seven deadly sins, Hieronymus Bosch depicts a bourgeois woman admiring herself in a mirror held up by a devil. Behind her is an open jewelry box. A painting attributed to Nicolas Tournier, which hangs in the Ashmolean Museum, is \"An Allegory of Justice and Vanity\". A young woman holds a balance, symbolizing justice; she does not look at the mirror or the skull on the table before her. Vermeer's famous painting \"Girl with a Pearl Earring\" is sometimes believed to depict the sin of vanity, as the young girl has adorned herself before a glass without further positive allegorical attributes. \"All is Vanity\", by Charles Allan Gilbert (1873–1929), carries on this theme. An optical illusion, the painting depicts what appears to be a large grinning skull. Upon closer examination, it reveals itself to be a young woman gazing at her reflection in the mirror.\nSuch artistic works served to warn viewers of the ephemeral nature of youthful beauty, as well as the brevity of human life and the inevitability of death.\n\n\n"}

Written in Arabic, it is the ninth book by Kadhim, who works as a Professor of Cultural Studies at the University of Bahrain. Written in two stages, before and during the Arab Spring, the book discusses this wave of protests from two sides; the past and the future. The past is divided into three waves, each of them corresponding to an era of hope and aspiration. First is the enlightenment wave, followed by the revolutionary wave and finally the democratic wave. The author then tackles the Arab Spring and argues that it is not the time for celebration, but an important station in the long way towards democracy.\n\nThe book was positively received by reviewers in several Bahraini media outlets such as \"Al-Wasat\", \"Al Ayam\" and al-Bilad. In addition, the pan-Arab \"Al-Hayat\" and Kuwaiti \"Al Rai\" newspapers gave it favorable reviews. There were mild criticisms for the book, mainly concerned with its scope. Every critic thought it should have expanded more on a certain aspect.\n\nThe Arab Spring was a wave of protests, uprisings and revolutions that erupted at the end of 2010 and beginning of 2011. Starting from the Tunisian city of Sidi Bouzid and spreading throughout the country, the Tunisian Revolution began in mid-December 2010 and was soon faced with government repression. On 14 January 2011, President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali fled to Saudi Arabia. Inspired by the events, the Egyptians organized similar protests on 25 January, which also swelled and spread all over the country. After several failed attempts to stop the movement, President Hosni Mubarak announced his resignation and transferred power to the army on 11 February. These events \"jolted the rest of the region\" and several other Arab countries were quick to follow suit.\n\nIn Yemen, small-scale protests started shortly after the Tunisian Revolution. Protesters were emboldened by the fall of Mubarak and their numbers grew. The president, Ali Abdullah Saleh was able to remain in power for months before signing an agreement in November by which he handed over power, but remained a political player. In Bahrain, protests erupted on 14 February and were met by repression. A month later, the government called in troops from neighboring Persian Gulf countries to put down protests and announced a state of emergency. In Libya, protests started on 17 February in the eastern city of Benghazi. They developed into a civil war that has claimed the lives of tens of thousands. In September, six months after the UN Security Council–sanctioned NATO military intervention, the \"de facto\" ruler Muammar Gaddafi was toppled and killed.\n\nIn Syria, protests erupted in mid-March and were met by government repression. The brutal repression radicalized the opposition and the country slid into full scale civil war that has left more than 100,000 killed by July 2013. Less significant protests also occurred in Algeria, Jordan, Morocco, Oman and Saudi Arabia. The initial hopes of democratic change have faced several setbacks in Syria, Yemen, Libya, Bahrain, Egypt and Tunisia. A report by Freedom House in 2012 suggested that while Tunisia was showing significant improvements, Egypt's improvements were limited and there were declines in some areas. Bahrain on the other hand was scoring record declines and was ranked lowest. The situation in Yemen was not much better than Bahrain.\n\nKadhim began writing the book in December 2010, a time he described as gloomy with no hope of change in the Arab World. Then, when the Arab Spring began, he was deeply shaken by the rapid developments and the early victories achieved in Tunisia and Egypt, and described them as \"a rain that fell suddenly on a barren desert\". Therefore, he decided to stop writing and rethink the book's thesis, which until then had been influenced by the previous gloomy atmosphere. The stop was only expected to last for few months or a year at most until the events unfolded. But Kadhim only resumed writing in September 2012, a time when some countries were still in upheaval, while others were in transition. He was determined and motivated to re-examine the original thesis, to defend the Arab Spring, and most importantly to defend \"the hope that this Spring had revived\".\n\nThe book discusses the Arab Spring from two sides: the past and the future. The author argues that the Arab Spring was a result of a past which extends to the nineteenth century, which he names the \"memory of hope\". He then divides this long period into three eras: enlightenment wave of hope, revolutionary wave of hope and democratic wave of hope. Each of these waves is then discussed in detail.\n\nThis wave started at the beginning of the nineteenth century. It was characterized by the hope that al-Nahda (Arab Renaissance) and enlightenment would allow the region catch up with more developed nations. Although they differed in ideology and worldview, the common theme among the enlightenment intellectuals was their belief in gradual progress without sudden leaps even if it takes decades. They did not support violence or revolution, but preferred peaceful methods such as education and science to bring about change. Most of them saw the Western world as a model to follow and imitate; some even called for full Europeanization. Another shared theme was their attempt to explain the backwardness of the Arab world and the progress of the Western world by one grand cause, each of them claiming to have found this cause. Despite the long time-frame and successive generations of this wave, the author concludes that it failed to achieve its goals.\n\nThis wave started in the middle of the twentieth century and was characterized by the hope to achieve al-Nahda via rapid radical changes. Its theorists criticized the previous gradual approach as futile. They thought that the Arab world was held back from progress by two major forces: foreign colonialism and local tyranny. Thus, they supported national liberation movements and revolutions. To them, revolution was the only way to overcome the backwardness of the Arab world. The Western world was no more a model to follow, instead Third World counties that resisted imperialism such as Vietnam and Cuba became the models.\n\nFollowing the defeat of Arab armies in the 1948 Palestine war, the Arab world went into an era of political assassinations and military coups that culminated in the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, which brought Gamal Abdel Nasser into the leadership of Egypt. Nasser's ascend to power was a turning point in the history of the region and the revolutionary wave had spread to Algeria, Bahrain, Iraq, Yemen and Libya. This wave however faced a historic defeat in the 1967 Arab–Israeli War. The author states that this defeat was worse than that of 1948 and had signaled the end of the Nasserite revolutionary wave, which was replaced by the Islamist wave. This wave reached its climax in early 1980s after the Islamic Revolution in Iran and Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, which turned Afghanistan into a hub for Mujahideen. The Arab revolutions that succeeded did not bring al-Nadha nor freedom, instead they had turned into authoritarian regimes. These developments and the 8-year Iran–Iraq War have struck a fatal blow to the Arab revolutionary wave of hope.\n\nThis wave began at the end of the 1980s after the Revolutions of 1989. Its main theme was the hope that civil society, not enlightenment or revolution would pave the way for democracy in the Arab world. Civil society was seen as essential for emergence of democracy and that once a strong civil society developed, democracy was sure to follow. It was hoped that democracy would be achieved by the end of 1990s or early twenty-first century at most. The Saddam Hussein-ordered Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990 and the subsequent Gulf War have formed a strong reaction against tyranny, which was seen as the main cause of the crisis. It also weakened authoritarian regimes and gave civil society more space to maneuver. The number of non-governmental organizations in the Arab world jumped from less than 20,000 in the mid-1960s to over 70,000 in the late 1980s to 300,000 in 2008. Despite all of these developments, there was no significant democratic change in any Arab state throughout this period.\n\nIn this chapter, the author argues that the grand narrative of democratic change was being weakened and replaced by small narratives of quality of life and personal consumption of commodities and services. Arab states used these narratives to polish their tarnished legitimacy. However, these small narratives were not sustainable. Dissatisfaction and despair were very high. This situation was ready to explode at any moment and was ignited by Mohamed Bouazizi's self-immolation. Although the Arab Spring began with great hopes for change, these hopes were replaced by fear and then by frustration. Setbacks such as the struggle between Islamists and seculars, 2012 Benghazi attack and Reactions to \"Innocence of Muslims\" have diminished much of the initial hope.\n\nThe author concludes by arguing that change is hard and that one should not rush to think that the Arab Spring is the \"time of festival\". Instead the author blames this rush and exaggerated expectations for the diminishing of hope. He adds that although the way forward is long and hard (the events of early 2011 being an important station in it), we should hold on to the hope rescued by the Arab Spring and believe that a better future can be built by our own hands.\n\nFor each wave, the author cites a number of characters as its thinkers and intellectuals.\n\nThe enlightenment wave of hope:\n\nThe revolutionary wave of hope:\n\nThe democratic wave of hope:\n\n\"Saving Hope\" was published by Masaa Publishing & Distribution in Bahrain and Kuwait in 2013, with the subtitle, \"The Long Way to the Arab Spring\". Unlike Kadhim's three previous books, which were published gradually as articles in the media, no parts of \"Saving Hope\" were published before the official release. The cover of the 314 pages book showed a Tunisian woman waving the V sign. The book has received favorable reviews in various media outlets.\n\nWriting for \"Al-Wasat\", Mohammed Jalal praised the book's title and subtitle saying they reflected positiveness and reality. He also stated that \"Saving Hope\" was Kadhim's most important book so far. Writing for the same newspaper, Habib Haidar expressed his admire to the large amount of sources Kadhim used and was able to plot in a homogeneous way that is easy to read. He also noted that two thirds of the book were dedicated to the \"memory of hope\" and only 100 pages discussed the Arab Spring.\n\nHassan Madan reviewed the book in 5 articles published in \"Al Ayam\". He considered it the first Bahraini attempt to analyze the roots of the Arab Spring. He noted that throughout the book, the author had argued against Lyotard's proposal by stating that local narratives had reached an impasse. While praising his division of the \"memory of hope\", Madan thought that Kadhim should have expanded more about the divisions between the first and the second wave and should have explored more about Marxist parties in the Arab world. Writing for the same newspaper, Mahir Abdulqadir praised the thesis of the book, stating that unlike many of the superficial analysis of the Arab Spring, Kadhim succeeded in tackling and examining the Arabic subconscious while keeping the reader in suspense until the last pages. He however criticized the book for not covering the \"West aggressive attitude to the [Arab] Renaissance\".\n\nOne attendant of a cultural seminar about the book criticized it for lacking Islamic theorizing, while another described it as too optimistic. Overall comments were however positive. Writing for \"Al-Bilad\" newspaper, Mohammed al-Mahfodh stated that the book was well worth reading and stopping by. A review by \"Al-Hayat\" warned against judging the book from its optimistic cover image or title. It praised the book and described it as a \"thoughtful and interesting study\". Fahad al-Hindal praised the author's critical reading of the three waves of hope in a review published in \"Al Rai\" newspaper.\n\n"}

He has served as the John Cogan University Professor of the Humanities at Harvard University since 2000. Greenblatt is the general editor of \"The Norton Shakespeare\" (2015) and the general editor and a contributor to \"The Norton Anthology of English Literature\".\n\nGreenblatt is one of the founders of New Historicism, a set of critical practices that he often refers to as \"cultural poetics\"; his works have been influential since the early 1980s when he introduced the term. Greenblatt has written and edited numerous books and articles relevant to New Historicism, the study of culture, Renaissance studies and Shakespeare studies and is considered to be an expert in these fields. He is also co-founder of the literary-cultural journal \"Representations\", which often publishes articles by new historicists. His most popular work is \"Will in the World\", a biography of Shakespeare that was on the \"New York Times\" Best Seller List for nine weeks. He won the Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction in 2012 and the National Book Award for Nonfiction in 2011 for \"\".\n\nGreenblatt was born in Boston and raised in Newton, Massachusetts. After graduating from Newton North High School, he was educated at Yale University (BA 1964, PhD 1969) and Pembroke College, Cambridge (MA (Cantab) 1966). Greenblatt has since taught at the University of California, Berkeley, and Harvard University. He was Class of 1972 Professor at Berkeley (becoming a full professor in 1980) and taught there for 28 years before taking a position at Harvard University. He was named John Cogan University Professor of the Humanities in 2000. Greenblatt is considered \"a key figure in the shift from literary to cultural poetics and from textual to contextual interpretation in U.S. English departments in the 1980s and 1990s.\"\n\nGreenblatt was a long-term fellow of the Wissenschaftskolleg in Berlin. As a visiting professor and lecturer, Greenblatt has taught at institutions including the École des Hautes Études, the University of Florence, Kyoto University, the University of Oxford and Peking University. He was a resident fellow at the American Academy in Rome, and is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1987), the American Philosophical Society (2007), and the American Academy of Arts and Letters (2008); he has been president of the Modern Language Association.\n\nGreenblatt self-identifies as an Eastern European Jew, an Ashkenazi, and a Litvak. His observant Jewish grandparents were born in Lithuania; his paternal grandparents were from Kovno and his maternal grandparents were from Vilna. Greenblatt's grandparents immigrated to the United States during the early 1890s in order to escape a Czarist Russification plan to conscript young Jewish men into the Russian army.\n\nIn 1998, he married fellow academic Ramie Targoff, also a Renaissance expert and a professor at Brandeis University, whom he has described as his soulmate.\n\nGreenblatt has written extensively on Shakespeare, the Renaissance, culture and New Historicism (which he often refers to as \"cultural poetics\"). Much of his work has been \"part of a collective project\", such as his work as co-editor of the Berkeley-based literary-cultural journal \"Representations\" (which he co-founded in 1983), as editor of publications such as the \"Norton Anthology of English Literature\", and as co-author of books such as \"Practicing New Historicism\" (2000), which he wrote with Catherine Gallagher. Greenblatt has also written on such subjects as travelling in Laos and China, story-telling, and miracles.\n\nGreenblatt's collaboration with Charles L. Mee, \"Cardenio\", premiered on May 8, 2008, at the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Massachusetts. While the critical response to \"Cardenio\" was mixed, audiences responded quite positively. The American Repertory Theater has posted audience responses on the organization's blog. \"Cardenio\" has been adapted for performance in ten countries, with additional international productions planned.\n\nHe wrote his 2018 book \"Tyrant: Shakespeare on Politics\" out of anxiety over the result of the 2016 US presidential election.\n\nGreenblatt first used the term \"New Historicism\" in his 1982 introduction to \"The Power of Forms in the English Renaissance\" wherein he uses Queen Elizabeth I's \"bitter reaction to the revival of Shakespeare's \"Richard II\" on the eve of the Essex rebellion\" to illustrate the \"mutual permeability of the literary and the historical\". New Historicism is regarded by many to have influenced \"every traditional period of English literary history\". Some critics have charged that it is \"antithetical to literary and aesthetic value, that it reduces the historical to the literary or the literary to the historical, that it denies human agency and creativity, that it is somehow out to subvert the politics of cultural and critical theory [and] that it is anti-theoretical\". Scholars have observed that New Historicism is, in fact, \"neither new nor historical.\" Others praise New Historicism as \"a collection of practices\" employed by critics to gain a more comprehensive understanding of literature by considering it in historical context while treating history itself as \"historically contingent on the present in which [it is] constructed\".\n\nAs stated by Shakespeare scholar Jonathan Bate, the approach of New Historicism has been \"the most influential strand of criticism over the last 25 years, with its view that literary creations are cultural formations shaped by 'the circulation of social energy'.\" When told that several American job advertisements were requesting responses from experts in New Historicism, he remembered thinking: \"'You've got to be kidding. You know it was just something we made up!' I began to see there were institutional consequences to what seemed like a not particularly deeply thought-out term.\"\n\nHe has also said that \"My deep, ongoing interest is in the relation between literature and history, the process through which certain remarkable works of art are at once embedded in a highly specific life-world and seem to pull free of that life-world. I am constantly struck by the strangeness of reading works that seem addressed, personally and intimately, to me, and yet were written by people who crumbled to dust long ago\".\n\nGreenblatt's works on New Historicism and \"cultural poetics\" include \"Practicing New Historicism\" (2000) (with Catherine Gallagher), in which Greenblatt discusses how \"they anecdote ... appears as the 'touch of the real'\" and \"Towards a Poetics of Culture\" (1987), in which Greenblatt asserts that the question of \"how art and society are interrelated,\" as posed by Jean-François Lyotard and Fredric Jameson, \"cannot be answered by appealing to a single theoretical stance\". \"Renaissance Self-Fashioning\" and the introduction to the \"Norton Shakespeare\" are regarded as good examples of Greenblatt's application of new historicist practices.\n\nNew Historicism acknowledges that any criticism of a work is colored by the critic’s beliefs, social status, and other factors. Many New Historicists begin a critical reading of a novel by explaining themselves, their backgrounds, and their prejudices. Both the work and the reader are affected by everything that has influenced them. New Historicism thus represents a significant change from previous critical theories like New Criticism, because its main focus is to look at many elements outside of the work, instead of reading the text in isolation.\n\n\"I believe that nothing comes of nothing, even in Shakespeare. I wanted to know where he got the matter he was working with and what he did with that matter\".\n\nGreenblatt states in \"\"King Lear\" and Harsnett's 'Double-Fiction'\" that \"Shakespeare's self-consciousness is in significant ways bound up with the institutions and the symbology of power it anatomizes\". His work on Shakespeare has addressed such topics as ghosts, purgatory, anxiety, exorcists and revenge. He is also a general editor of the \"Norton Shakespeare\".\n\nGreenblatt's New Historicism opposes the ways in which New Criticism consigns texts \"to an autonomous aesthetic realm that [dissociates] Renaissance writing from other forms of cultural production\" and the historicist notion that Renaissance texts mirror \"a coherent world-view that was held by a whole population,\" asserting instead \"that critics who [wish] to understand sixteenth- and seventeenth-century writing must delineate the ways the texts they [study] were linked to the network of institutions, practices, and beliefs that constituted Renaissance culture in its entirety\". Greenblatt's work in Renaissance studies includes \"Renaissance Self-Fashioning\" (1980), which \"had a transformative impact on Renaissance studies\".\n\nGreenblatt joined M. H. Abrams as general editor of \"The Norton Anthology of English Literature\" published by W. W. Norton during the 1990s. He is also the co-editor of the anthology's section on Renaissance literature and the general editor of the \"Norton Shakespeare\", \"currently his most influential piece of public pedagogy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Olesen is a graduate from Université de Paris I-Sorbonne, and defended his doctorate degree with \"Wissen und Phänomen\" (1997) from Université de Nice. Olesen has notably advanced the notion of transcendental history.\n\nIn his book \"Transcendental History\" (2013) Olesen addresses the two-fold question of what makes history possible and how history conditions human existence and knowledge. The concept of history in this sense encompass something else and something more that what we are used to from everyday speech, and it also differs in this way from what one encounters as 'history' in the scientific discipline of history. In his book, Olesen gives an exposition of and a defense for the view, that historicality is the pivotal condition for human knowledge and existence. Something is historical by virtue of its mode of appearance, which has human existence as a transcendental condition. But on the other hand, what makes history possible is human existence. In this way history of philosophy and philosophy of history become inseparable. History first became a problem for philosophy, when philosophy became aware of itself as historically situated and contingent. Even the concept of identity, whose timelessness and unchanging nature was assumed in premodern philosophy, becomes temporal and thereby also historical and thus has history as a transcendental condition. The thesis central to \"Transcendental History\" is: It is not the subject or consciousness which is the transcendental condition of knowledge, but rather history. And history is furthermore the transcendental condition for the subject and consciousness. Transcendental history as a philosophical enterprise thus becomes both metaphilosophy, metaphysics, epistemology and philosophy of consciousness.\n\nWhile most of Olesen's work has been in Danish, and are therefore exclusive to a Danish audience, international publishers have also published works written in French, German, Italian and English.\n\n"}
{"id": "49163556", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49163556", "title": "Tengiz Iremadze", "text": "Tengiz Iremadze\n\nTengiz Iremadze (Georgian: თენგიზ ირემაძე, German: Tengis Iremadse; born March 9, 1973, Sokhumi, Georgia) – Georgian Philosopher. The major fields of his study are: philosophy of mind (theory of intellect), philosophy of war and peace, sociology of terror, sociology of media and a new branch of philosophy - philosophical urbanism. He pays special attention to medieval, early modern and \ncontemporary Georgian and European philosophy. Currently, Tengiz Iremadze is working on the historical and systematic analysis of Caucasian philosophy. His works are published in various languages. \nTengiz Iremadze became famous by his works dedicated to ancient philosophy (Pythagoras, Plato, Aristotle) and to the late antiquity (Proclus), also to medieval Georgian and Latin Christian thought (Ioane Petritsi, Dietrich of Freiberg, Berthold of Moosburg). His works on Friedrich Nietzsche (2006) and Walter Benjamin (2008) published in Georgian language are considered to be an exemplary academic studies in Georgian philosophy. Tengiz Iremadze had dedicated number of papers to Friedrich Nietzsche`s philosophy, which are published in several languages. In addition, he translated the works of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Walter Benjamin, Hans Blumenberg, André Glucksmann and Ernst Meister into the Georgian language. He is the editor of the Georgian translations of the works of Friedrich Nietzsche, Alexis de Tocqueville, Thomas Paine, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, James Wilson, Benjamin Rush, John Dewey, Henri Bergson, Carl Schmitt, Leo Strauss, Hannah Arendt and Niklas Luhmann.\n\nIn 1993-1998 Tengiz Iremadze studied philosophy and sociology at Ivane Javakhishvili Tbilisi State University. From his academic teachers especially noteworthy is famous Georgian philosopher Guram Tevzadze. In his diploma thesis Tengiz Iremadze gave a new interpretation of Nietzsche`s \"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\", and therefore made an important contribution to Nietzsche`s studies in Georgia. In 2003 he earned his PhD degree in philosophy at Ruhr University Bochum under the supervision of outstanding German philosopher Burkhard Mojsisch (1944-2015). His PhD thesis was following: \"Conceptions of Thought in Neo-Platonism. The Reception of Proclus` Philosophy in Medieval German and Georgian Thought. Dietrich of Freiberg - Berthold of Moosburg - Ioane Petritsi.\" The major merit of his work is considered to be the original philosophical research of theoretical concepts of antique and medieval Neo-Platonism expressed in the development of new intercultural model of typological-systematic interpretation of this heritage. This intercultural model of the historical study of philosophy gained special attention of many outstanding representatives of the field. Since 2007 Tengiz Iremadze is professor of philosophy and social sciences at Grigol Robakidze University(Tbilisi, Georgia) and the director of the Institute of Philosophy and Social Sciences of the same university. In 2015 he became professor of philosophy at New Georgian University (Poti, Georgia), and is the director of the Archive of Caucasian Philosophy and Theology of the same university. Tengiz Iremadze is chief editor and publisher of number of philosophical series in Georgia and Europe. Since 2014 together with German philosophers Udo Reinhold Jeck and Helmut Schneider he publishes scientific series \"Philosophy and Social Theory\" (Berlin, Publishing House \"Logos\").\n\nAlready in his PhD thesis (2003) Tengiz Iremadze paid special attention to the concept of intercultural philosophy. In this work he analyzed the history of the reception of one of the central concepts (theory of thought) of outstanding thinker of late antiquity Proclus in medieval Latin West. At the same time in his study he incorporated old Georgian texts referring to the \"Elements of Theology\" (Ioane Petritsi`s translation and commentary of this important work of Proclus). Here, the possibility of intercultural comparison provided especially interesting perspective, as far as both lines of development (Western European and Georgian) existed independently and did not have any reference to each other. They had only one thing in common; both of them were based on a late antique author (Proclus). Tengiz Iremadze perfectly understood that especially here, in totally different language cultures, the study of differences and similarities given in this interesting episode of the reception of Proclus` philosophy became possible. Therefore, his dissertation includes not only the history of reception of Proclus` philosophy. Tengiz Iremadze complexly discussed different approaches of interpretations of Proclus` philosophy and therefore laid foundations for this field of intercultural study. For this reason his work surpasses other analyses dedicated to Ioane Petritsi, Dietrich of Freiberg and Berthold of Moosburg.\n\nTengiz Iremadze fruitfully developed this direction of research in his work \"Philosophy at the Crossroads of Epochs and Cultures\" (2013). Here, based on the concept of \"crossroad\" he introduced new philosophical concept. In this work Tengiz Iremadze combined historical studies and systematic analysis and developed methodological preconditions and bases of \"Caucasian Philosophy\". He was the first to discuss Caucasian thought in united framework and first and foremost paid special attention to those thinkers who fostered the development of philosophical relationship between Caucasian countries. This work can be divided into three parts: in the introductory reflections Tengiz Iremadze develops methodological grounds and discusses the key concept of the \"crossroad\" from different perspectives. In the first part of the work is given the phenomenology of the \"crossroad\" from the important perspective of intercultural thought:\n\n\"[Crossroad] is a topos which can be understood as a place where different cultures, beliefs and worldviews meet and depart. [...] This is the starting point where the same and the other really meet each other. The crossroad can also become a concept designating intercultural dialogue. If the process of genuine communication and mutual understanding between individuals of different cultures and traditions is possible, then it will definitely happen at the crossroads. [...] The term \"crossroad\" is suitable for the characterization of Georgian philosophical and theological thought. I think that this metaphor most adequately expresses the character of Georgian thought. The latter can be understood as a topos which is a gathering of European and non-European, western and eastern cultures. The original, distinctive and unique character of Georgian thought should be sought in the process of philosophizing at the epistemological and conceptual edge, at the crossroads of various cultures, religions, and traditions.\"\n\nIn the second part of the work he discusses basic philosophical concepts [Being/Beings, Truth/Interpretation, Reception/Transformation, Individualism/Intersubjectivity, Knowledge/Wisdom], which have been not only important throughout the history of philosophy, but will also have a great value in the future. In the third part Tengiz Iremadze discusses new concepts of intercultural thought. The concept of \"crossroad\" also plays important role here, because it underpins new intercultural philosophical theory.\n\nTengiz Iremadze`s above-mentioned work provides fruitful grounds for the study of intercultural phenomena. On the one hand, here certain cultural space (\"Caucasian philosophy\") is outlined and clearly is indicated its connections to other philosophical cultures. On the other hand, in this work is given a theory which is in close relation with hermeneutical practices as well as with the systematic problems of philosophy.\n\nTengiz Iremadze`s works gained international attention in many respects. His article on Ioane Petritsi is published in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.Despite the fact, that his doctoral thesis unequivocally belongs to the history of philosophy, he later paid special attention to systematic philosophical studies. In his works he pays equal attention to problems of classical as well as of the contemporary philosophy. His thesis according to which Caucasian philosophy has not been treated properly in the history of philosophy gained international reception and changed existing paradigms in this regard. His students and colleagues (especially noteworthy in this regard are Giorgi Tavadze and Giorgi Khuroshvili) fruitfully work on these issues at the Archive of Caucasian Philosophy and Theology of New Georgian University.\n\n\n\n"}

It was written in 1946 and 1947 in Viareggio, Italy, where Valtorta was bedridden for several decades. The text is based on a series of \"dictations\" which Valtorta attributed to her guardian angel, Azariah. \n\nIn the book Valtorta does not provide a specific biblical reference to Azariah himself, but simply refers to him as her guardian angel. The name Azariah, from Hebrew, means the Lord's help.\n\nThe book consists of a set of \"lessons\", provided by Azariah on Sundays, whose starting points are the 58 Masses of the Roman Missal of the Catholic Church prior to the reforms of the Second Vatican Council in 1965. Maria Valtorta had originally called the book \"Angelical Masses\", with the subtitle \"Directions\". But the first Italian edition in 1972 used the name of her guardian angel, \"Azariah\". As in other works by Maria Valtorta, the themes of continuous prayer and identification with the Person of Christ and his sacrifice are emphasized throughout the work.\nFor instance, on May 26, 1946, the fifth Sunday after Easter, the Mass Gospel was\nJohn 16, 23-30 and Azariah's comments, in part, are quoted as follows:\nGenerosity ought to be responded to with generosity. We, spirits who see men from the height of the Heavens and follow them with divine light as our guide, view the wonderful prodigies provoked by this competition in generosity between the soul giving itself to Him who has given Himself to it and God, who gives Himself even more to reward the generous one giving himself to Him. And we can truly say, in response to the questions of many about the humanly inexplicable ascents and descents of souls, that the rise or fall is linked to and follows from the degree of generosity with which a soul adheres to the Lord.\nThe first lesson in the Book of Azariah was written on February 24, 1946, and the last on March 16, 1947. The book was thus written in parallel to Valtorta's best known work \"The Poem of the Man God\", where the first episode was written on December 18, 1943, and major writing ended on April 28, 1947, although a few sections near the end were written later, concluding on December 8, 1951. However, unlike the Poem of the Man God, where she wrote a good number of the last episodes first, the order of the lessons in the Book of Azariah is sequential with respect to the date on which they were written.\n\n"}

Lilly published by the Julian Press.\n\nThe book explores the question of consciousness and the inner world of the mind, refracted through the experience of Lilly himself in the 1960s using the drug LSD and, particularly, flotation tanks and isolation. It also examines Lilly's notion of self-metaprogramming as a means to shape and direct certain experiences and gain autonomy and mastery over the direction that they take.\n\nThe book also recounted Lilly's interactions with other explorers of consciousness such as Oscar Ichazo in Chile whose work was based in part on that of Gurdijeff. Lilly adapted Ichazo's concepts of a range of different levels of experience, using pre-existing concepts such as satori or samadhi, to create a composite framework of consciousness ranging on the one hand from the death of the ego and fusion with the Universal Mind to a state of the 'quintessence of evil' and 'deepest hell imaginable' on the other hand.\n\nOne of the key insights put forward by Lilly is the view that \"in the province of the mind, what is believed to be true is true or becomes true, within certain limits to be found experientially and experimentally. These limits are further beliefs to be transcended. In the province of the mind, there are no limits.\" In this context, Lilly draws a distinction between the limitless province of the mind and the realm of the body, in which there are limits that cannot be transcended.\n"}
{"id": "1124857", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1124857", "title": "The Death of the Author", "text": "The Death of the Author\n\n\"The Death of the Author\" (French: \"La mort de l'auteur\") is a 1967 essay by the French literary critic and theorist Roland Barthes (1915–80). Barthes' essay argues against traditional literary criticism's practice of incorporating the intentions and biographical context of an author in an interpretation of a text, and instead argues that writing and creator are unrelated. The title is a reference to \"Le Morte d'Arthur\", a 15th-century compilation of smaller Arthurian legend stories, written by Sir Thomas Malory.\n\nThe essay's first English-language publication was in the American journal \"Aspen\", no. 5–6 in 1967; the French debut was in the magazine \"Manteia\", no. 5 (1968). The essay later appeared in an anthology of Barthes's essays, \"Image-Music-Text\" (1977), a book that also included his \"From Work To Text\".\n\nIn his essay, Barthes argues against the method of reading and criticism that relies on aspects of the author's identity—their political views, historical context, religion, ethnicity, psychology, or other biographical or personal attributes—to distill meaning from the author's work. In this type of criticism, the experiences and biases of the author serve as a definitive \"explanation\" of the text. For Barthes, this method of reading may be apparently tidy and convenient but is actually sloppy and flawed: \"To give a text an author\" and assign a single, corresponding interpretation to it \"is to impose a limit on that text\".\n\nReaders must thus separate a literary work from its creator in order to liberate the text from interpretive tyranny (a notion similar to Erich Auerbach's discussion of narrative tyranny in Biblical parables). Each piece of writing contains multiple layers and meanings. In a well-known quotation, Barthes draws an analogy between text and textiles, declaring that a \"text is a tissue [or fabric] of quotations\", drawn from \"innumerable centers of culture\", rather than from one, individual experience. The essential meaning of a work depends on the impressions of the reader, rather than the \"passions\" or \"tastes\" of the writer; \"a text's unity lies not in its origins\", or its creator, \"but in its destination\", or its audience.\n\nNo longer the focus of creative influence, the author is merely a \"scriptor\" (a word Barthes uses expressively to disrupt the traditional continuity of power between the terms \"author\" and \"authority\"). The scriptor exists to produce but not to explain the work and \"is born simultaneously with the text, is in no way equipped with a being preceding or exceeding the writing, [and] is not the subject with the book as predicate\". Every work is \"eternally written here and now\", with each re-reading, because the \"origin\" of meaning lies exclusively in \"language itself\" and its impressions on the reader.\n\nBarthes notes that the traditional critical approach to literature raises a thorny problem: how can we detect precisely what the writer intended? His answer is that we cannot. He introduces this notion of intention in the epigraph to the essay, taken from Honoré de Balzac's story \"Sarrasine\" in which a male protagonist mistakes a castrato for a woman and falls in love with him. When, in the passage, the character dotes over his perceived womanliness, Barthes challenges his own readers to determine who is speaking, and about what. \"Is it Balzac the author professing 'literary' ideas on femininity? Is it universal wisdom? Romantic psychology? … We can never know.\" Writing, \"the destruction of every voice,\" defies adherence to a single interpretation or perspective. (Barthes returned to \"Sarrasine\" in his book \"S/Z\", where he gave the story a rigorous close reading.)\n\nAcknowledging the presence of this idea (or variations of it) in the works of previous writers, Barthes cited in his essay the poet Stéphane Mallarmé, who said that \"it is language which speaks\". He also recognized Marcel Proust as being \"concerned with the task of inexorably blurring…the relation between the writer and his characters\"; the Surrealist movement for employing the practice of \"automatic writing\" to express \"what the head itself is unaware of\"; and the field of linguistics as a discipline for \"showing that the whole of enunciation is an empty process\". Barthes' articulation of the death of the author is a radical and drastic recognition of this severing of authority and authorship. Instead of discovering a \"single 'theological' meaning (the 'message' of the Author-God)\", readers of a text discover that writing, in reality, constitutes \"a multi-dimensional space\", which cannot be \"deciphered\", only \"disentangled\". \"Refusing to assign a 'secret,' ultimate meaning\" to text \"liberates what may be called an anti-theological activity, an activity that is truly revolutionary since to refuse meaning is, in the end, to refuse God and his hypostases—reason, science, law.\"\n\nIdeas presented in \"The Death of the Author\" were anticipated to some extent by the New Criticism, a school of literary criticism important in the United States from the 1940s to the 1970s. New Criticism differs from Barthes' theory of critical reading because it attempts to arrive at more authoritative interpretations of texts. Nevertheless, the crucial New Critical precept of the \"intentional fallacy\" declares that a poem does not belong to its author; rather, \"it is detached from the author at birth and goes about the world beyond his power to intend about it or control it. The poem belongs to the public.\" Barthes himself stated that the difference between his theory and New Criticism comes in the practice of \"disentangling.\"\n\nBarthes' work has much in common with the ideas of the \"Yale school\" of deconstructionist critics, which numbered among its proponents Paul de Man and Barbara Johnson in the 1970s, although they are not inclined to see meaning as the production of the reader. Barthes, like the deconstructionists, insists upon the disjointed nature of texts, their fissures of meaning and their incongruities, interruptions, and breaks.\n\nPost-structuralist skepticism about the notion of the singular identity of the self has also been important for some academics working in feminist theory and queer theory. These writers find in Barthes' work an anti-patriarchal, anti-traditional strain sympathetic to their own critical work. They read \"The Death of the Author\" as a work that obliterates not only stable critical interpretation but also stable personal identity.\n\nMichel Foucault also addressed the question of the author in critical interpretation. In his 1969 essay \"What is an Author?\", he developed the idea of \"author function\" to explain the author as a classifying principle within a particular discursive formation. Foucault did not mention Barthes in his essay but its analysis has been seen as a challenge to Barthes' depiction of a historical progression that will liberate the reader from domination by the author.\n\nJacques Derrida paid ironic homage to Barthes's \"The Death of the Author\" in his essay \"The Deaths of Roland Barthes\".\n\nSome scholars have rejected Barthes's argument \"in toto\". Camille Paglia, for example, wrote: \"Most pernicious of French imports [into American academia] is the notion that there is no person behind a text. Is there anything \"more\" affected, aggressive, and relentlessly concrete than a Parisian intellectual behind his/her turgid text? The Parisian is a provincial when he pretends to speak for the universe.\"\n\nLiterary theorist Seán Burke dedicated an entire book to opposing \"The Death of the Author\", pointedly called \"The Death and Return of the Author\".\n\n\n\n"}

He is known for his commentaries on Pseudo-Dionysius and his ideas on affective theology. His elaborate mystical schemata influenced Bonaventure and \"The Cloud of Unknowing\".\n\nBorn in France sometime in the late twelfth century, Thomas Gallus departed in 1219 from Paris, where he lectured in the university, and went to Vercelli in the north of Italy, along with two companions, to establish a new monastery there. This monastery was set up under the initiative of Cardinal Guala Bicchieri, once a papal legate to England and France. Moreover, Bicchieri was a native of Vercelli and wished to establish a monastery and hospital in his home town.\n\nBy the end of 1225 or the start of 1226, Thomas was appointed abbot of the new monastery. As abbot, he devoted himself not just to the daily administrative tasks of the monastery, but also to composing various commentaries and expositions of the Bible and the writings of the Pseudo-Dionysius. He enjoyed a close relationship with the nascent Franciscan order; indeed, the Franciscans transferred their \"studium generale\" from Padua to Vercelli around 1228. He was personally acquainted with St Anthony of Padua. Gallus also knew Robert Grosseteste whom he may have met in 1238 when visiting England to secure a benefice associated with the church of St. Andrew's in Chesterton. Gallus and Grosseteste seem to have exchanged some writings through the agency of Grosseteste's associate, the Franciscan Adam Marsh. When war broke out between the Guelphs of Vercelli and the Ghibellines of the neighbouring town of Ivrea, Gallus was compelled to flee Vercelli in 1243 and take refuge in Ivrea after many grave accusations were made against him by the papal supporters. Some records however suggest that he did manage to return to Vercelli before his death in 1246.\n\nA funerary monument to Gallus can be seen today in the Church of Sant’Andrea in Vercelli.\n\nGallus wrote extensively between about 1218 and his death.\n\nThomas Gallus's interpretation of pseudo-Dionysius has in recent years been presented as one of two traditions of interpretation of Dionysius that emerged in the thirteenth century, with a 'speculative Dionysianism' developed by the Dominican Albert the Great, and an 'affective Dionysianism' first given systematic formulation in Gallus's interpretation of pseudo-Dionysius, but with great influence on later vernacular mystical writing. Specifically, this refers to the fact that in the contemporary debate on the relation between love and knowledge in mystical consciousness, Gallus held that affectivity tends to \"exclude\" (rather than simply \"subsume\") human knowledge in the highest stages of the mystical itinerary.\n\n\nGallus's commentaries on Scripture include:\n\n\n\n"}

Co-authored by Professor Arun Tiwari and published by HarperCollins India, the book describes Kalam's spiritual experiences with and reflections on Pramukh Swami Maharaj, the guru and spiritual leader of the BAPS Hindu organization. Kalam recounted the spiritual transformation he experienced during his fourteen-year association with Pramukh Swami, described the inspiration he obtained from Pramukh Swami's leadership of BAPS, and expressed his vision for a society in which science and spirituality are fused. Kalam stated that he saw in Pramukh Swami “a true embodiment of transcendence,” and titled the book to reflect his belief that Pramukh Swami is gunatit, a term signifying transcendence of ephemeral qualities and the modes of nature.\n\nAfter training as an aeronautical engineer, Dr A.P.J. Abdul Kalam worked at India's Defense Research and Development Organization and the Indian Space Research Organization as a rocket scientist who was responsible for India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle and India's ballistic missile systems. He was later appointed the principal scientific adviser to the government of India, with the rank of cabinet minister. In 1997, he received India's highest civilian award, the Bharat Ratna, and in 2002 he became the eleventh President of India. He is widely acknowledged as the most popular President in Indian history.\n\nKalam had often expressed that he was proud of being an Indian Muslim. During his childhood, his father, A P Jainulabdeen, an imam in a mosque in the South Indian town of Rameshwaram, would have tea every evening with the heads of the town's main Hindu temple and Christian church and discuss local issues. Kalam wrote how this secular mindset broadened his thinking, inspiring him to seek out truth without being hindered by mundane boundaries. This helped lead him to choose Pramukh Swami, the Hindu head of the BAPS Swaminarayan Sampradaya as his guru, with whom he enjoyed a close relationship for the last fourteen years of his life. Just a month after this book was released, Kalam died of cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015 at the age of 83.\n\nThe co-author of the book, Arun Tiwari, had been working under Kalam since 1982, first as a missile scientist at the Defense Research and Development Laboratory and then as the program director of a defense technology spin-off. In 1999, Tiwari co-wrote Kalam's autobiography, Wings of Fire, which has become a modern classic, selling more than a million copies in eighteen languages. Since then, Tiwari has written twelve books, with this, his latest book, having taken him about a year to write together with Kalam. Tiwari is also an adjunct professor in the School of Management Sciences, University of Hyderabad.\n\nThe first of eight meetings between Kalam and Pramukh Swami took place on 30 June 2001 at Gujarat Vihar in New Delhi. Kalam and Pramukh Swami struck an instant bond of friendship and spiritual rapport. Kalam commented that he was drawn to Pramukh Swami's simplicity and spiritual purity. After meeting with Pramukh Swami, Kalam reflected on Saint Thiruvalluvar's teaching that when one is burdened by an issue, sitting in the presence of great divinity will free one from these worries. He revealed that he had experienced such a feeling in the presence of Pramukh Swami. Kalam was inspired by Pramukh Swami throughout their numerous interactions. He cites one specific incident, which galvanized him to write the book. The incident occurred on the day following the terrorist attack on the Akshardham, Gandhinagar complex in September 2002. Kalam was moved by Pramukh Swami's equanimity in the aftermath of the attack. Pramukh Swami prayed for and sprinkled holy water upon the sites of all of the deceased, including the terrorists, thus displaying to the world that all human life is sacred. Kalam's resolve to write the book was further strengthened in 2005 during the inauguration of the Swaminarayan Akshardham in New Delhi.\n\nKalam expressed that he wrote the book in order to record his experiences and reflections on Pramukh Swami and his work, and the transformation he experienced whilst in Pramukh Swami's fellowship. The book discusses the correlation between science and spirituality. Kalam stated that he observed Pramukh Swami's life for fourteen years and worked for two years on writing the book along with co-author Professor Arun Tiwari. Tiwari described the book's central message as being centered on purity and integrity.\n\nKalam and Tiwari discussed that they titled the book ‘Transcendence’ to reflect their belief that Pramukh Swami transcends the ephemeral and the modes of nature. Tiwari, recalls, “Whatever name we thought, we were trying to match it with Pramukh Swamiji. So, we arrived at ‘Transcendence’, which is gunatit. After all, one translation of transcendence is gunatit. Somebody who is beyond guna – that is Pramukh Swamiji. So, that gunatit we translated to transcendence.”\n\nThe book comprises thirty-two chapters, equally divided into four major sections, and an epilogue.  The first section describes Kalam’s spiritual experiences with Pramukh Swami Maharaj.  The second section highlights notable works of BAPS.  The third section advocates for a fusion between science and spirituality, and highlights the examples of leading scientists in history who also held spiritual beliefs. The fourth section reflects on the ideals of creative leadership.\n\nThe first section, entitled “Experiencing the Presence,” describes Kalam's spiritual experiences during his interactions with Pramukh Swami between 2001 and 2014.\n\nDuring these years, Kalam often spoke with Pramukh Swami on the phone and personally met with him on seven occasions. Kalam recalled that upon his first meeting with Pramukh Swami on 30 June 2001, he “felt a strange connection with something that exists in the realm of spirit—the part that is closest to the Divine” and felt he “had acquired a sixth sense.” Kalam chronicled how, since that day, many of the problems or conundrums he faced while in office were resolved with the blessings of Pramukh Swami.  For example, Kalam discussed his “Vision 2020” plan for India with Pramukh Swami, who suggested, “Along with your five ideas to transform India add a sixth one - faith in God.”\n\nThis section includes eight chapters, titled: (1) Lead India; (2) You Are Not Who You Think You Are; (3) Peace Grows When It Is Shared; (4) Children Are Everyone's Future; (5) The Confidence That We Can Do It; (6) Self-Discipline Is the True Path to Dharma; (7) Nothing Less Than God's Best in Our Lives; and (8) Change Alone is Eternal, Perpetual, Immortal.\n\nThe second section, entitled “Spirituality in Action,” includes Kalam's observations regarding the activities and accomplishments of BAPS, the global religious and civic organization within the Swaminarayan branch of Hinduism, under Pramukh Swami's stewardship. Pramukh Swami is the guru and spiritual leader of BAPS.\n\nKalam studied the history of BAPS, and narrated how the organization has grown to become “a spiritual force connecting millions of people [in India] and abroad.” Kalam describes BAPS \"mandirs\", or traditional places of worship, and the two Akshardham complexes in Delhi and Gandhinagar, India as the “sanctuaries of pious and virtuous living.” Kalam noted that a key lesson taught by BAPS is to “remove I and me. Ego will vanish. If ego vanishes hatred will vanish. If hatred vanishes, peace will come.”\n\nThe book's co-author, Professor Arun Tiwari, also notes that BAPS’ achievements include reconciling communities in conflict, engaging in anti-addiction public campaigns, and promoting intra-household spiritual meetings, called \"ghar sabhas\". According to Professor Tiwari, BAPS’ activities are “very revolutionary and, in sociological terms, I do not see any parallel.”\n\nThis section includes eight chapters, titled: (9) Portal to the Unseen; (10) Warriors of the Light; (11) The Doctor of the Soul; (12) A Status Without Parallel; (13) From Within I Rise; (14) Walking Over the Waves; (15) Living in the Witness of God; and (16) To Give and Forgive Is Divine.\n\nThe third section, entitled “Fusion of Science and Spirituality,” describes the relationship between science and spirituality as expressed by preeminent thinkers and scientists, including Pythagoras, Galileo Galilei, Albert Einstein, Gregor Mendel, Baruch Spinoza, Srinivas Ramanujan, Jagdish Chandra Bose, Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, and Francis Collins. As Kalam expressed, the vision of a fusion between science and spirituality “shows the way ahead for humanity.”  In Kalam's view, science has advanced and provided much to humanity, but spirituality is also an essential component of human life. The book's co-author, Professor Arun Tiwari, has similarly stated, “Looking at science and spirituality as two separate processes is a big mistake. I think both are the same. Both are two faces of the same coin.”\n\nThis section includes eight chapters, titled: (17) In Contemplation of the Beauty of Creation; (18) Religions Are the Signposts of God; (19) Mind is the Matrix of All Matter; (20) Growing into Highly Evolved Physical and Spiritual Beings; (21) The Highest Virtue Is the Intellectual Love of God; (22) A Dimension As Vast As Space and As Timeless As Infinity; (23) The Unique Throb of Life in All Creation; and (24) God Is the Source of the Universe.\n\nIn the fourth section, entitled “Evolution of Creative Leadership,” Kalam shares the lessons on leadership he learned from Pramukh Swami. As co-author Professor Tiwari has described, “If you look at the leadership of Pramukh Swamiji... his management, his leadership I have not seen anywhere.” In this section, Kalam enumerates “eight facets of creative leadership, namely – fearlessness, courage, ethical living, non-violence, forgiveness, compassion, vision and cooperation” through the stories of Nachiketa, Abdul Qadir, Abraham Lincoln, Thiruvalluvar, Mahatma Gandhi, Nelson Mandela, the Dalai Lama, Vikram Sarabhai and Verghese Kurien.”\n\nThis section includes eight chapters, titled: (25) A Fearless Look Into the Face of All Facts; (26) What Prevented You from Prostrating When I Commanded You?; (27) Purity is the Feminine, Truth the Masculine Terms of Divinity; (28) There Is No Such Thing As Defeat in Nonviolence; (29) Forgiveness Forces Us to Grow Beyond What We Are; (30) The Best Name for God Is Compassion; (31) Vision with Action Can Change the World; and (32) The Most Powerful Force on This Planet is Human Cooperation.\n\nOn 26 June 2015, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi received a copy of the book from the co-author, publishers and senior Sadhus of BAPS. Modi, having known and met Pramukh Swami Maharaj over many decades , acknowledged the significance of the work and lauded both its historical and spiritual value. P.K. Lehri Former Chief Secretary, Gujarat, reflecting upon the Ahmedabad book launch, was thrilled by the message of love and peace and wrote, “The book spreads the message of peace and love. It really was a great function and I can say that all of us who attended had never seen or thought that such an atmosphere of goodwill, peace and love for mankind can be created.” P.C. Thakur, director general of Police in Gujarat thought the book was a great way of bringing science and spirituality together in the service of humanity as he states, “This a confluence of two great saints – a saint of science, Dr. Kalam, and a saint of spiritual bliss, Pramukh Swamiji. This work inspires love, respect, friendship, compassion and the righteous path of humanity in one’s mind”.\n\nThe book has been published in hardback by Harper Element, which is an imprint of HarperCollins Publishers India. At the book's Gujarat launch in the Ahmedabad Convention Center, chief copy editor of HarperCollins India, Shantanu Chaudhuri, explained that this was a “historic book” for HarperCollins, since it was the first time “an ex-President of a nation [was] writing his experiences about a brilliant spiritual leader.” Moreover, he marveled that instead of the eight to ten months it normally takes to publish a book, this book went from manuscript to bound copies in just two months.\n\nHe further explained that the hardback original edition of a book in India never goes beyond 5,000 to 10,000 copies in the first print. However, due to the historic nature of this book, the publishers anticipated heavy demand and printed approximately 100,000 copies in its opening print run, which was a record for HarperCollins India.\n\nBefore the end of 2015, the publishers have stated that the book will be out in Hindi, Gujarati, Malayalam, Telugu, Marathi, Kannada and Tamil, and that it would likely be published internationally under HarperCollins's US and UK imprint Harper360, making it available in the US and Europe.\n\n"}

{"id": "46029", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46029", "title": "Wisdom", "text": "Wisdom\n\nWisdom, sapience, or sagacity, is the ability to think and act using knowledge, experience, understanding, common sense and insight. Wisdom is associated with attributes such as compassion, experiential self-knowledge, non-attachment and virtues such as ethics and benevolence.\n\nWisdom has been defined in many different ways, a variety of measurement scales have been developed, and several subtypes of wisdom have been proposed. Out of these, \"phronesis\" and \"sophia\" are two key subtypes of wisdom.\nIn the classical Greek tradition, there is a distinction between \"sophia\" \"wisdom\" and \"phronesis\" \"prudence, practical intelligence\".\n\nThe \"Oxford English Dictionary\" defines wisdom as \"Capacity of judging rightly in matters relating to life and conduct; soundness of judgement in the choice of means and ends; sometimes, less strictly, sound sense, esp. in practical affairs: opp. to folly;\" also \"Knowledge (esp. of a high or abstruse kind); enlightenment, learning, erudition.\" Charles Haddon Spurgeon defined wisdom as \"the right use of knowledge\". Robert I. Sutton and Andrew Hargadon defined the \"attitude of wisdom\" as \"acting with knowledge while doubting what one knows\". In the psychological literature however the construct of wisdom does not have a commonly accepted definition.\n\nThe ancient Greeks considered wisdom to be an important virtue, personified as the goddesses Metis and Athena. Athena is said to have sprung from the head of Zeus. She was portrayed as strong, fair, merciful, and chaste. To Socrates and Plato, philosophy was literally the love of Wisdom (philo-sophia). This permeates Plato's dialogues, especially \"The Republic\", in which the leaders of his proposed utopia are to be philosopher kings, rulers who understand the Form of the Good and possess the courage to act accordingly. Aristotle, in his \"Metaphysics\", defined wisdom as the understanding of causes, i.e. knowing why things are a certain way, which is deeper than merely knowing that things are a certain way. In fact, it was Aristotle who first made a distinction between \"phronesis\" and \"sophia\" aspects of wisdom.\n\nThe ancient Romans also valued wisdom. It was personified in Minerva, or Pallas. She also represents skillful knowledge and the virtues, especially chastity. Her symbol was the owl which is still a popular representation of wisdom, because it can see in darkness. She was said to be born from Jupiter's forehead.\n\nWisdom is also important within Christianity. Jesus emphasized it. Paul the Apostle, in his first epistle to the Corinthians, argued that there is both secular and divine wisdom, urging Christians to pursue the latter. Prudence, which is intimately related to wisdom, became one of the four cardinal virtues of Catholicism. The Christian philosopher Thomas Aquinas considered wisdom to be the \"father\" (i.e. the cause, measure, and form) of all virtues.\n\nIn Buddhist traditions, developing wisdom plays a central role where comprehensive guidance on how to develop wisdom is provided. In the Inuit tradition, developing wisdom was one of the aims of teaching. An Inuit Elder said that a person became wise when they could see what needed to be done and do it successfully without being told what to do. In many cultures, the name for third molars, which are the last teeth to grow, is etymologically linked with wisdom, e.g., as in the English \"wisdom tooth\".\n\nPublic schools in the US have an approach to character education. Eighteenth century philosophers such as Benjamin Franklin, referred to this as training wisdom and virtue. Traditionally, schools share the responsibility to build character and wisdom along with parents and the community.\n\nNicholas Maxwell, a contemporary philosopher in the United Kingdom, advocates that academia ought to alter its focus from the acquisition of knowledge to seeking and promoting wisdom, which he defines as the capacity to realize what is of value in life, for oneself and others. He teaches that new knowledge and technological know-how increase our power to act which, without wisdom, may cause human suffering and death as well as human benefit. Wisdom is the application of knowledge to attain a positive goal by receiving instruction in governing oneself.\n\nPsychologists have gathered data on commonly held beliefs or folk theories about wisdom. These analyses indicate that although \"there is an overlap of the implicit theory of wisdom with intelligence, perceptiveness, spirituality and shrewdness, it is evident that wisdom is an expertise in dealing with difficult questions of life and adaptation to the complex requirements.\" Baltes et al. in 2002 through \"Wisdom: its structure and function in regulating lifespan successful development\" defined \"Wisdom is the ability to deal with the contradictions of a specific situation and to assess the consequences of an action for themselves and for others. It is achieved when in a concrete situation, a balance between intrapersonal, inter- personal and institutional interests can be prepared\".\n\nResearchers in the field of positive psychology have defined wisdom as the coordination of \"knowledge and experience\" and \"its deliberate use to improve well being.\" With this definition, wisdom is further defined as a multidimensional construct with the following facets:\n\n\nWisdom leads a person to overcome feelings of helplessness, powerlessness, anger or aggression by non-understanding of external elements and internal acknowledgement. It leads to a change from the experience of meaninglessness to meaningful goals, prospects for coping with critical life events and to engage constructively with complex life problems. John Vervaeke has argued through \"cognitive science of wisdom\" that, when basic relevance realization processes that underlie cognition is fed back onto themselves and made self-referential/differentiated reflection with the problems facing and its dimensions, leads to enhanced insight abilities associated with wisdom. Robert Sternberg has segregated the capacity for judgement from the general qualifiers for intelligence, which is closer to cognizant aptitude than to wisdom. Displaying sound judgement in a complex, dynamic environment is a hallmark of wisdom.\nDr. B. Legesse et al., a neuropsychiatrist at McLean Hospital/Harvard Medical School, offers \"a theoretical definition that takes into account many cultural, religious, and philosophical themes is that wisdom represents a demonstrated superior ability to understand the nature and behavior of things, people, or events.\" He states \"this results in an increased ability to predict behavior or events which then may be used to benefit self or others.\" He furthermore adds \"there is more often a desire to share the accrued benefits with a larger group for the purpose of promoting survival, cohesion, or well-being of that group. The benefits do not result from malicious or antisocial intents or inequitable behavior. Environmental factors, such as family, education, socioeconomic status, culture, and religion, are involved in generating the milieu in which the personal value system develops. Many of these same factors also influence how a given community decides whether wisdom is present or not. This model of wisdom relies on the individual's ability to generate a mental representation of the self (cognitive, emotional, and physical), the external world, and the dynamic relationship of the self with the external world.\" Dr. Legesse proposes that \"the neural (brain) systems critical to enable these functions are distributed but heavily dependent on those that support memory, learning, understanding other people's mental states (Theory of Mind), and assigning relative value to information.\" The neuroanatomy of wisdom he says depends on \"the three frontosubcortical neural networks, the limbic system, and the mirror neuron system\" which \"are of particular importance for supporting these activities.\" However, the need to distinguish two very different “levels of analyses” has been proposed as being important especially when one attempts to describe wisdom using neural anatomy.\n\nMany, but not all, studies find that adults' self-ratings of perspective/wisdom do not depend on age. This stands in contrast to the popular notion that wisdom increases with age, supported by a recent study showing that regardless of their education, IQ or gender, older adults possess better reasoning about societal and interpersonal conflicts.\n\nSapience is closely related to the term \"sophia\" often defined as \"transcendent wisdom\", \"ultimate reality\", or the ultimate truth of things. Sapiential perspective of wisdom is said to lie in the heart of every religion, where it is often acquired through intuitive knowing. This type of wisdom is described as going beyond mere practical wisdom and includes self-knowledge, interconnectedness, conditioned origination of mind-states and other deeper understandings of subjective experience. This type of wisdom can also lead to the ability of an individual to act with appropriate judgement, a broad understanding of situations and greater appreciation/compassion towards other living beings.\n\nThe word \"sapience\" is derived from the Latin \"sapientia\", meaning \"wisdom\". \nThe corresponding verb \"sapere\" has the original meaning of \"to taste\", hence \"to perceive, to discern\" and \"to know\"; its present participle \"sapiens\" was chosen by Carl Linnaeus for the Latin binomial for the human species, \"Homo sapiens\".\n\nIn Mesopotamian religion and mythology, Enki, also known as Ea, was the God of wisdom and intelligence. Wisdom was achieved by restoring balance.\n\nSia represents the personification or god of wisdom in the traditional mythology adhered to in Ancient Egypt.\n\nThe word wisdom (חכם) is mentioned 222 times in the Hebrew Bible. It was regarded as one of the highest virtues among the Israelites along with kindness (חסד) and justice (צדק). Both the books of Proverbs and Psalms urge readers to obtain and to increase in wisdom.\n\nIn the Hebrew Bible, wisdom is represented by Solomon, who asks God for wisdom in . Much of the Book of Proverbs, a book of wise sayings, is attributed to Solomon. In , the fear of YHWH is called the beginning of wisdom. In , there is also reference to wisdom personified in female form, \"Wisdom calls aloud in the streets, she raises her voice in the marketplaces.\" In , this personified wisdom is described as being present with God before creation began and even taking part in creation itself.\n\nThe Talmud teaches that a wise person is a person who can foresee the future. \"Nolad\" is the Hebrew word for \"future,\" but also the Hebrew word for \"birth\", so one rabbinic interpretation of the teaching is that a wise person is one who can foresee the consequences of his/her choices (i.e. can \"see the future\" that he/she \"gives birth\" to).\n\nIn Christian theology, \"wisdom\" (From Hebrew: \"חכמה\" transliteration: chokmâh pronounced: khok-maw', Greek: \"Sophia\", Latin: \"Sapientia\") describes an aspect of God, or the theological concept regarding the wisdom of God.\n\nThere is an oppositional element in Christian thought between secular wisdom and Godly wisdom. Paul the Apostle states that worldly wisdom thinks the claims of Christ to be foolishness. However, to those who are \"on the path to salvation\" Christ represents the wisdom of God. () Also, Wisdom is one of the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit according to Anglican, Catholic, and Lutheran belief. gives an alternate list of nine virtues, among which wisdom is one.\n\nThe book of Proverbs in the Old Testament of the Bible primarily focuses on wisdom, and was primarily written by one of the wisest kings according to Jewish history, King Solomon. Proverbs is found in the Old Testament section of the Bible and is written in a sort of poetic way, giving direction on how to handle various aspects of life; one's relationship with God, marriage, dealing with finances, work, friendships and persevering in difficult situations faced in life. Also the nature of Wisdom as being female.\n\nApart from Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and James, other main books of wisdom in the Bible are Job, Psalms, and 1 and 2 Corinthians, which give lessons on gaining and using wisdom through difficult situations.\n\nDeveloping wisdom is of central importance in Buddhist traditions, where the ultimate aim is often presented as “seeing things as they are” or as gaining a “penetrative understanding of all phenomena,” which in turn is described as ultimately leading to the “complete freedom from suffering.” In Buddhism, developing wisdom is accomplished through an understanding of what are known as the Four Noble Truths and by following the Noble Eightfold Path. This path lists mindfulness as one of eight required components for cultivating wisdom.\n\nBuddhist scriptures teach that a wise person is usually endowed with good and maybe bodily conduct, and sometimes good verbal conduct, and good mental conduct.(\"AN 3:2\") A wise person does actions that are unpleasant to do but give good results, and doesn’t do actions that are pleasant to do but give bad results (\"AN 4:115\"). Wisdom is the antidote to the self-chosen poison of ignorance. The Buddha has much to say on the subject of wisdom including:\nTo recover the original supreme wisdom of self-nature covered by the self-imposed three dusty poisons (greed, anger, ignorance) Buddha taught to his students the threefold training by turning greed into generosity and discipline, anger into kindness and meditation, ignorance into wisdom. As the Sixth Patriarch of Chán Buddhism, Huineng, said in his Platform Sutra,\"Mind without dispute is self-nature discipline, mind without disturbance is self-nature meditation, mind without ignorance is self-nature wisdom.\"\n\nIn Hinduism, wisdom is considered a state of mind and soul where a person achieves liberation.\n\nThe god of wisdom is Ganesha and the goddess of knowledge is Saraswati.\n\nThe Sanskrit verse to attain knowledge is:<br>\n\nWisdom in Hinduism is knowing oneself as the truth, basis for the entire Creation, i.e., of \"Shristi\". In other words, wisdom simply means a person with Self-awareness as the one who witnesses the entire creation in all its facets and forms. Further it means realization that an individual through right conduct and right living over an unspecified period comes to realize their true relationship with the creation and the \"Paramatma\" who rules it.\n\nThe Arabic term corresponding to Hebrew \"Chokmah\" is \"ḥikma\".\nThe term occurs a number of times in the Quran, notably in Sura 2:269:\n\"He gives wisdom to whom He wills, and whoever has been given wisdom has certainly been given much good. And none will remember except those of understanding.\" ().\nand Sura 22:46: \"Have they not travelled in the land, and have they hearts wherewith to feel and ears wherewith to hear? For indeed it is not the eyes that grow blind, but it is the hearts, which are within the bosoms, that grow blind.\"\nSura 6: 151: \"Say: \"Come, I will rehearse what Allah (God) hath (really) prohibited you from\": Join not anything as equal with Him; be good to your parents; kill not your children on a plea of want;― We provide sustenance for you and for them;― come not nigh to shameful deeds, whether open or secret; take not life, which Allah hath made sacred, except by way of justice and law: thus doth He command you, that ye may learn wisdom\" ().\n\nThe Buddhist term \"Prajñā\" was translated into Chinese as\n\nAccording to the \"Doctrine of the Mean\", Confucius said:\n\n\"Love of learning is akin to wisdom. To practice with vigor is akin to humanity. To know to be shameful is akin to courage (zhi, ren, yong.. three of Mengzi's sprouts of virtue).\"\n\nCompare this with the Confucian classic \"Great Learning\", which begins with: \"The Way of learning to be great consists in manifesting the clear character, loving the people, and abiding in the highest good.\" One can clearly see the correlation with the Roman virtue prudence, especially if one interprets \"clear character\" as \"clear conscience\". (From Chan's Sources of Chinese Philosophy).\n\nIn Taoism, wisdom is construed as adherence to the Three Treasures (Taoism): charity, simplicity, and humility.\n\"He who knows other men is discerning [智]; he who knows himself is intelligent [明].\" (Tao Te Ching 33)\n\nIn Norse mythology, the god Odin is especially known for his wisdom, often acquired through various hardships and ordeals involving pain and self-sacrifice. In one instance he plucked out an eye and offered it to Mímir, guardian of the well of knowledge and wisdom, in return for a drink from the well.\nIn another famous account, Odin hanged himself for nine nights from Yggdrasil, the World Tree that unites all the realms of existence, suffering from hunger and thirst and finally wounding himself with a spear until he gained the knowledge of runes for use in casting powerful magic. He was also able to acquire the mead of poetry from the giants, a drink of which could grant the power of a scholar or poet, for the benefit of gods and mortals alike.\n\nIn Bahá'í scripture, \n\"The essence of wisdom is the fear of God, the dread of His scourge and punishment, and the apprehension of His justice and decree.\" Wisdom is seen as a light, that casts away darkness, and \"its dictates must be observed under all circumstances\". One may obtain knowledge and wisdom through God, his Word, and his Divine Manifestation and the source of all learning is the knowledge of God.\n\n"}
{"id": "15204855", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15204855", "title": "Wuzhen pian", "text": "Wuzhen pian\n\nThe Wuzhen pian () is a 1075 Daoist classic on Neidan-style internal alchemy. Its author Zhang Boduan (張伯端; 987?–1082) was a Song dynasty scholar of the Three teachings (Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism).\n\nZhang Boduan, or Zhang Ziyang 張紫陽, was a native of Tiantai 天臺 in present-day Zhejiang. After passing the Imperial examination, he began a career as a civil servant, but was banished to the frontier in Lingnan, where he served as a military commissioner. Zhang was later transferred to Guilin and Chengdu, where in 1069 he allegedly experienced sudden realization from a Daoist Master who instructed him in \"Neidan\" internal alchemy. Zhang wrote the \"Wuzhen pian\", its appendices, and a few other texts, including the \"Jindan sibai zi\" 金丹四百字 \"Four hundred words on the Golden Elixir\" (tr. Davis and Chao 1940). He was additionally an authority on Chan Buddhism.\n\nBiographical sources agree that Zhang Boduan died in 1082 CE during the reign of Emperor Shenzong of Song, but disagree whether he was born in 983, 984, or 987. Zhang was honorifically called Ziyang Zhenren 紫陽真人, ranking him as a Daoist \"zhenren\" 真人 \"real/true/authentic person; perfected/authentic person\" (the \"zhen\" in the \"Wuzhen pian\"), one rank higher than a \"xian\" 仙 \"transcendent; immortal\" in the celestial hierarchy.\n\nThe Quanzhen School of Daoism originated in the 12th century with the Five Northern Patriarchs (Wang Chongyang and his successors). In the 13th century, Zhang Boduan posthumously became the second of the Five Southern Patriarchs in the so-called \"Nanzong\" 南宗 \"Southern Lineage\", which Boltz (1987:173) refers to as \"ex post facto\".\n\nIn Shaanxi, Hong Kong, and Singapore, there are Zhenren Gong 真人宮 \"Real/Perfected Person Temples\" dedicated to Zhang Boduan.\n\nThe received \"Wuzhen pian\" text contains a preface dated 1075 and a postface dated 1078, both under the name Zhang Boduan. The Daozang \"Daoist Canon\" includes several textual editions of varying lengths.\n\nThe core of the \"Wuzhen pian\" comprises 81 poems: 16 heptasyllabic \"lüshi\" 律詩 \"regulated poems\", 64 heptasyllabic \"jueju\" 絕句 \"stopped-short line\" quatrains, and one pentasyllabic verse on the \"Taiyi\" 太一 \"Great Unity\". Both 16 (= 2 x 8) and 64 (= 8 x 8) have numerological significance, the former denotes two equal \"8 ounce\" measures of Yin and Yang (alchemical allusions for mercury and lead) totaling \"16 ounces\" (one \"jin\" 斤 \"catty\"), and the latter correlates with the 64 Yijing hexagrams.\n\nZhang later appended the \"Wuzhen pian\" text with 12 alchemical \"ci\" 詞 \"lyrics\" that numerologically correspond to the 12 months, and 5 verses related with the \"Wu Xing\" 五行 \"Five Phases\".\n\nBaldrian-Hussein describes the text.\nThe verses of the \"Wuzhen pian\" are a work of literary craftsmanship and were probably intended to be sung or chanted. They teem with paradoxes, metaphors, and aphorisms, and their recondite style allows multiple interpretations. The verses are widely accepted as an elaboration of the \"Zhouyi cantong qi\", but their philosophical basis is in the \"Daode jing\" and the \"Yinfu jing\". Life, says Zhang Boduan, is like a bubble on floating water or a spark from a flint, and the search for wealth and fame only results in bodily degeneration; thus human beings should search for the Golden Elixir (\"jindan\" 金丹) to become celestial immortals (\"tianxian\" 天仙). (2007:1082) \n\nThe \"Wuzhen pian\" is one of the major scriptures of Daoist \"Neidan\" \"Inner Alchemy \" and metaphorically uses the vocabulary of \"Waidan\" \"External Alchemy\", which involved compounding elixirs from minerals and medicinal herbs. The text proposes that External Alchemy is unnecessary because the human body contains the essential components. These Three Treasures are \"jing\" \"essence; refined, perfected; extract; sperm, seed\", \"qi\" \"vitality, energy, force; vapor; breath\", and \"shen\" \"spirit; soul, mind; god, deity\". Through alchemical refinement of bodily \"jing\" and \"qi\", one can supposedly achieve integration with one's spiritual \"shen\" nature.\n\nThe intentionally abstruse and highly symbolic language of the \"Wuzhen pian\" is open to diverse interpretations. Many commentators, both Daoist and otherwise, have explicated the text.\n\nThe Daoist Canon includes a dozen commentaries (\"zhu\" 主) and sub-commentaries (\"shu\" 疏) to the \"Wuzhen pian\" (see Baldrian-Hussein 2007:1082-3). Major commentaries are by Ye Shibiao 葉士表 (dated 1161), Yuan Gongfu 遠公輔 (dated 1202), and several (dated 1335 and 1337) by Weng Baoquang 翁葆光 and Dai Qizong 戴起宗.\n\nIn addition, there are numerous later commentaries to the text. Two notable examples are by Qiu Zhao'ao 仇兆鰲 (dated 1713), who quotes from 25 commentaries, and by Liu Yiming 劉一明 (dated 1794), who was 11th patriarch of the Quanzhen Longmen 龍門 \"Dragon Gate\" Lineage.\n\n\"Wuzhen pian\" combines three Chinese words.\nThe Chinese character \"wu\" 悟 \"awaken; realize\", which is written with the \"heart/mind radical\" 忄and a phonetic of \"wu\" \"I; my; we; our\", has a literary variant Chinese character \"wu\" \"awake; wake up\" with the \"roof radical\" 宀, \"qiang\" 爿 \"bed\", and this \"wu\" 吾 phonetic. Compare the given name of Sun Wukong 孙悟空, the central character in Journey to the West, which literally means \"Awaken to Emptiness\".\n\nThe ambiguity of the \"Wuzhen pian\" title, and by extension the text itself, is illustrated by these English renderings:\n\nThe \"Wuzhen pian\" has full and partial translations into English. Tenney L. Davis and Chao Yün-ts’ung, who collaborated on several groundbreaking studies of Daoist alchemy, published the first English version (1939). Paul Crowe (1997) wrote a detailed study of the \"Wuzhen pian\" text and a full annotated translation. Thomas Cleary (1997) fully translated the text and Liu Yiming's commentary. Partial translations are given by Livia Kohn (1993:314-319) and Eva Wong (1997:87-94). Fabrizio Pregadio (2009) translates the first 16 poems, with annotations on individual verses and selections from Liu Yiming's commentary.\n\nLouis Komjathy (2004:7-9) uses Cleary's version to illustrate the importance of \"linguistic competency\" in translating Daoist texts. Komjathy describes the \"Wuzhen pian\"'s content as \"so highly symbolic that it is all but impenetrable without commentaries or oral instructions.\" For instance, the Chinese original of the third stanza is written in four paired heptasyllabic verses:\n學仙須是學天仙、<br>\n惟有金丹最的端。<br>\n二物會時情性合、<br>\n五行全處龍虎蟠。<br>\n本因戊己為媒娉、<br>\n遂使夫妻鎮合歡。<br>\n只候功成朝北闕、<br>\n九霞光裏駕祥鸞。\n\nThe first translation is by Davis and Chao.\nIf you are learning to be a \"hsien\" (immortal), you should learn to be a heavenly \"hsien\". The most accurate means (for this purpose) is \"chin tan\" (gold medicine). The two things, when put into contact with each other, will indicate harmonious properties. The Tiger and the Dragon locate at the places where the \"wu hsing\" 五行 (five elements) are perfected. I desire to send \"wu ssu\" 戊巳 as a matchmaker to make them husband and wife and to bring them into a union from which real happiness will arise. Wait for the success of the compounding, and you will return to see the north gate of the Imperial palace. You will be able to ride on a phoenix's back, to fly high into the cloud and the light of the sky. (1939:103-104) \n\nCleary idiosyncratically translates in capital letters to distinguish the text from his translation (1987:29-32) of Liu's commentary:\nIF YOU ARE GOING TO STUDY IMMORTALITY, YOU SHOULD STUDY CELESTIAL IMMORTALITY; ONLY THE GOLD ELIXIR IS WORTHWHILE. WHEN THE TWO THINGS JOIN, SENSE AND ESSENCE MERGE; WHEN THE FIVE ELEMENTS ARE COMPLETE, THE TIGER AND DRAGON INTERTWINE. STARTING WITH HEAVEN-EARTH AND EARTH-EARTH AS GO-BETWEENS, FINALLY HUSBAND AND WIFE CONJOIN HAPPILY. JUST WAIT FOR THE ACHIEVEMENT TO BE COMPLETED TO PAY COURT TO THE NORTH PALACE GATE; IN THE LIGHT OF NINEFOLD MIST YOU RIDE A FLYING PHOENIX. (1987:28) \nKomjathy criticizes both the style and language of Cleary’s translation, noting, \"Except for punctuation, Cleary’s format gives the reader little indication that he or she is reading poetry.\" He also says, \"Cleary’s translation choices for various technical terms deviate from more standard renderings, and thus without knowledge of Chinese and the Chinese text one cannot easily identify the relevant correlates.\" One example concerns two Celestial stems.\nCleary translates the most technical section of this stanza, line five, as “Starting with Heaven-Earth and Earth-Earth as go-betweens.” With no annotation, the reader wonders what Chinese phrases Cleary is translating. An educated reader’s initial guess might be \"Yijing\" hexagrams. As it turns out, the Chinese text has the characters \"wu\" 戊 and \"ji\" 己, the fifth and sixth of the ten Celestial Stems (\"tiangan\" 天干), respectively. Cleary does not provide an explanation for or introduction to such choices, although \"Understanding Reality\", unlike his later publications, contains a glossary of terms. (2004:8)\nHe suggests a \"more accurate and technical translation\":\n[If you wish to] study immortality, you should study celestial immortality (\"tianxian\"); <br>\nThis alone is the most superior doctrine of the Golden Elixir (\"jindan\"). <br>\nWhen the two things meet [?], the emotions (\"qing\") and innate nature (\"xing\") are joined; <br>\nThe Five Phases (wuxing) completely settle, Tiger and Dragon entwine. <br>\nFrom the beginning, \"wu\" and \"ji\" are taken as the matchmaker, <br>\nThus causing husband and wife to be protected in commingled bliss. <br>\nSimply wait until the practice (\"gong\") is completed, [then] face towards the Northern Tower (\"beique\"); <br>\nAmidst the illumination of nine vapors, you mount an auspicious phoenix. (2004:8)\n\nKomjathy (2004:8-9) concludes, \"Although Cleary’s translation has certain deficiencies, he seems intent on staying close to the text and rendering it in a way that generally respects the work’s complexity.\"\n\nCompare how Paul Crowe translates this same stanza:\n[If you are going to] study immortality then it must be celestial immortality, <br>\n[which] alone is the most superior doctrine of the golden elixir. <br>\nWhen the two things come together [then the] emotions and inner nature coalesce, <br>\nthe dragon and tiger entwine where the five phases become complete. <br>\nFrom the beginning rely upon \"jueji\" [sic, \"wuji\"] to be the matchmaker; <br>\nthen cause the husband and wife to be calm and joyous. <br>\nSimply wait until the work is completed [then] pay court to the Northern Palace; <br>\namidst the brightness in nine rose-coloured clouds [you will] ride the auspicious \"luan\" bird. (1997:40-41) \n\nFor translating the thorny \"wuji\" expression, Crowe notes, \"\"Wu\" 戊 and \"ji\" 己 refer to the fifth and sixth of the ten celestial stems (\"tiangan\" 天干) which, in combination, correspond to the earth phase which occupies the central position.\"\n\nThere is also a poetic translation by Richard Bertschinger (2004) which is being updated on-line (2009- ). It includes his commentary based upon classical sources. Here is his translation of the same stanza with commentary:\n\n\"A Study of Fairyhood must be <br>\nA Study of natural Fairyhood <br>\nSince the Golden Elixir itself <br>\nIs quite evidently unique. <br>\nAs the Two Materials assemble, <br>\nWhat you feel and what you are unite - <br>\nThe Cycle of Five coiling entirely <br>\nTogether as Dragon and Tiger: <br>\nAt their Origin they rely on the Soil, <br>\nThere as Go-between, <br>\nEnabling Husband and Wife <br>\nTo protect their happy home together, <br>\nAwaiting only the Task's completion - <br>\nDawn at the Northern Gate, <br>\nNine Times layered clouds with Red Rays of light, <br>\nWe hold back our fabulous Luan...\" \n\nAnd finally, here is how Fabrizio Pregadio (2009: 23) translates the same verses:\nIf you study immortality, <br>\nyou should study celestial immortality: <br>\nonly the Golden Elixir <br>\nis the highest principle. <br>\nWhen the two things meet, <br>\nemotions and nature join one another; <br>\nwhere the five agents are whole, <br>\nDragon and Tiger coil.\n\nRely in the first place on \"wu\" and \"ji\" <br>\nthat act as go-betweens, <br>\nthen let husband and wife <br>\njoin together and rejoice. <br>\nJust wait until your work is achieved <br>\nto have audience at the Northern Portal, <br>\nand in the radiance of a ninefold mist <br>\nyou will ride a soaring phoenix. <br>\nIn his notes, Pregadio remarks that the imagery of the final four verses is similar to the one found in a passage of the \"Zhouyi cantong qi\" (see also the page):\nWith the Way completed and Virtue fulfilled, <br>\nwithdraw, stay concealed, and wait for your time. <br>\nThe Great One will send forth his summons, <br>\nand you move your abode to the Central Land. <br>\nYour work concluded, you ascend on high <br>\nto obtain the Register and receive the Chart. <br>\nThe last line of the \"Cantong qi\" passage refers to receiving consecration as an Immortal.\n\n\n"}
