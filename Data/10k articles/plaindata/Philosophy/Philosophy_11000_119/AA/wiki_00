{"id": "2044064", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2044064", "title": "Algirdas Julien Greimas", "text": "Algirdas Julien Greimas\n\nAlgirdas Julien Greimas (; born \"Algirdas Julius Greimas\"; 9 March 1917 – 27 February 1992), was a French-Lithuanian literary scientist, known among other things for the Greimas Square (\"le carré sémiotique\"). He is, along with Roland Barthes, considered the most prominent of the French semioticians. With his training in structural linguistics, he added to the theory of signification and laid the foundations for the Parisian school of semiotics. Among Greimas's major contributions to semiotics are the concepts of isotopy, the actantial model, the narrative program, and the semiotics of the natural world. He also researched Lithuanian mythology and Proto-Indo-European religion, and was influential in semiotic literary criticism.\n\nGreimas's father, Julius Greimas, 1882–1942, a teacher and later school inspector, was from Liudvinavas in the Suvalkija region of present-day Lithuania. His mother Konstancija Greimienė, née Mickevičiūtė (Mickevičius), 1886–1956, a secretary, was from Kalvarija. They lived in Tula, Russia, when he was born, where they ran away as refugees during World War I. They returned with him to Lithuania when he was two years old. His baptismal names are \"Algirdas Julius\" but he used the French version of his middle name, \"Julien\", while he lived abroad. He did not speak another language than Lithuanian until preparatory middle school, where he started with German and then French, which opened the door for his early philosophical readings in high school of Friedrich Nietzsche and Arthur Schopenhauer. After attending schools in several towns, as his family moved, and finishing Rygiškių Jonas High School in Marijampolė in 1934, he studied law at Vytautas Magnus University, Kaunas, and then drifted toward linguistics at the University of Grenoble, from which he graduated in 1939 with a paper on Franco-Provençal dialects. He hoped to focus next on early medieval linguistics (substrate toponyms in the Alps), but the beginning of World War II returned him to Lithuania for military service, where he then taught, worked as an editor, and published literary reviews and essays on culture.\n\nIn 1944 he enrolled for graduate study at the Sorbonne in Paris and specialized in lexicography, namely taxonomies of exact, interrelated definitions. He wrote a thesis on the vocabulary of fashion (a topic later popularized by Roland Barthes), for which he received a PhD in 1949.\n\nGreimas began his academic career as a teacher at a French Catholic boarding school for girls in Alexandria in Egypt, where he would take part in a weekly discussion group of about a dozen European researchers that included a philosopher, a historian, and a sociologist. Early on, he also met Roland Barthes, with whom he remained close for the next 15 years. In 1959 he moved on to universities in Ankara and Istanbul in Turkey, and then to Poitiers in France. In 1965 he became professor at the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales (EHESS) in Paris, where he taught for almost 25 years. He co-founded and became Secretary General of the International Association for Semiotic Studies.\n\nGreimas died in 1992 in Paris, and was buried at his mother's resting place, Petrašiūnai Cemetery in Kaunas, Lithuania. (His parents were deported to Siberia during the Soviet occupation. His mother managed to return in 1954; his father perished and his grave is unknown, but he has a symbolic tombstone at the cemetery.) He was survived by his wife, Teresa Mary Keane.\n\nGreimas's first published essay \"Cervantes ir jo don Kichotas\" (\"Cervantes and his Don Quixote\") came out in the literary journal \"Varpai\", which he helped to found, during the period of alternating Nazi and Soviet occupations of Lithuania. Although a review of the first Lithuanian translation of \"Don Quixote\", it addressed partly the issue of one's resistance to circumstances – even when doomed, defiance can at least aim at the preservation of one's dignity (\"Nebijokime būti donkichotai\", \"Let's not be afraid to be Don Quixotes\"). The first work of direct significance to his subsequent research was his doctoral thesis \"La Mode en 1830. Essai de description du vocabulaire vestimentaire d' après les journaux de modes de l'époque\" (\"Fashion in 1830. A Study of the Vocabulary of Clothes based on the Fashion Magazines of the Times\"). He left lexicology soon after, acknowledging the limitations of the discipline in its concentration on the word as a unit and in its basic aim of classification, but he never ceased to maintain his lexicological convictions. He published three dictionaries throughout his career. During his decade in Alexandria, the discussions in his circle of friends helped broaden his interests. The topics included Greimas's early influences – the works of the founder of structural linguistics Ferdinand de Saussure and his follower, Danish linguist Louis Hjelmslev, the initiator of comparative mythology Georges Dumézil, the structural anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss, the Russian specialist in fairy tales Vladimir Propp, the researcher into the aesthetics of theater Étienne Souriau, the phenomenologists Edmund Husserl and Maurice Merleau-Ponty, the psychoanalyst Gaston Bachelard, and the novelist and art historian André Malraux.\n\nGreimas proposed an original method for \"discourse semiotics\" that evolved over a thirty-year period. His starting point began with a profound dissatisfaction with the structural linguistics of the mid-century that studied only phonemes (minimal sound units of every language) and morphemes (grammatical units that occur in the combination of phonemes). These grammatical units could generate an infinite number of sentences, the sentence remaining the largest unit of analysis. Such a molecular model did not permit the analysis of units beyond the sentence.\n\nGreimas begins by positing the existence of a \"semantic universe\" that he defined as the sum of all possible meanings that can be produced by the value systems of the entire culture of an ethno-linguistic community. As the semantic universe cannot possibly be conceived of in its entirety, Greimas was led to introduce the notion of \"semantic micro-universe\" and \"discourse universe\", as actualized in written, spoken or iconic texts. To come to grips with the problem of signification or the production of meaning, Greimas had to transpose one level of language (the \"text\") into another level of language (the \"metalanguage\") and work out adequate techniques of \"transposition\".\n\nThe descriptive procedures of \"narratology\" and the notion of \"narrativity\" are at the very base of Greimassian semiotics of discourse. His initial hypothesis is that meaning is only apprehensible if it is articulated or narrativized. Second, for him narrative structures can be perceived in other systems not necessarily dependent upon natural languages. This leads him to posit the existence of two levels of analysis and representation: a \"surface\" and a \"deep level\", which forms a common trunk where narrativity is situated and organized anterior to its manifestation. The signification of a phenomenon does not therefore depend on the mode of its manifestation, but since it originates at the deep level it cuts through all forms of linguistic and non-linguistic manifestation. Greimas' semiotics, which is \"generative\" and \"transformational\", goes through three phases of development. He begins by working out a \"semiotics of action\" (\"sémiotique de l'action\") where \"subjects\" are defined in terms of their quest for \"objects\", following a \"canonical narrative schema\", which is a formal framework made up of three successive sequences: a \"mandate\", an \"action\" and an \"evaluation\". He then constructs a \"narrative grammar\" and works out a syntax of \"narrative programs\" in which subjects are \"joined up with\" or \"separated\" from objects of value. In the second phase he works out a \"cognitive semiotics\" (\"sémiotique cognitive\"), where in order to perform, subjects must be \"competent\" to do so. The subjects' competence is organized by means of a \"modal grammar\" that accounts for their existence and performance. This modal semiotics opens the way to the final phase that studies how \"passions\" modify actional and cognitive performance of subjects (\"sémiotique de passions\") and how belief and knowledge modify the competence and performance of these very same subjects.\n\nHe later began researching and reconstructing Lithuanian mythology. He based his work on the methods of Vladimir Propp, Georges Dumézil, Claude Lévi-Strauss, and Marcel Detienne. He published the results in \"Apie dievus ir žmones: lietuvių mitologijos studijos\" (\"Of Gods and Men: Studies in Lithuanian Mythology\") 1979, and \"Tautos atminties beieškant\" (\"In Search of National Memory\") 1990. He also wrote on Proto-Indo-European religion.\n\n\n"}

It refers to the psychological struggle of aspiring authors to overcome the anxiety posed by the influence of their literary antecedents.\n\nThe theory of anxiety of influence is a theory applied principally to early nineteenth century romantic poetry. Its author, Harold Bloom, maintains that the theory has general applicability to the study of literary tradition, ranging from Homer and the Bible to Thomas Pynchon and Anne Carson in the 20th and 21st century. It is based primarily on Bloom's belief that there is no such thing as an original poem, that every new composition is simply a misreading or misinterpretation of an earlier poem and that influence is unavoidable and inescapable; all writers inevitably, to some degree, adopt, manipulate or alter and assimilate certain aspects of the content or subject matter, literary style or form from their predecessors. To illustrate his point, Bloom quotes Oscar Wilde, noting that:\n\n\"Influence is simply transference of personality, a mode of giving away what is most precious to one's self, and its exercise produces a sense, and, it may be, a reality of loss. Every disciple takes away something from his master.\"\n\nContrary to universally-held beliefs that the literary influence of precursors can provide a purely benevolent, inspirational platform for young, aspiring writers; Bloom deems that this influence provides entirely the opposite effect. He contends that it proves detrimental; that this influence instills in young writers a type of unease, apprehension or anxiety as they psychologically struggle against past literary forebears to create something definitive and original and achieve literary recognition and success. Bloom equates this struggle to the Freudian family drama; particularly to the Oedipal complex and relationship of son to father, where the emerging writer is cast as the 'son' in a battle against the 'father'; a literary precursor. Bloom claims that this forces poets or authors into a type of 'creative misprision'; where they must distort the works of their literary masters in an attempt to create something revolutionary and innovative. The authors who triumph over this struggle are deemed 'strong', with some even receiving acclaim to the extent where the contemporary has the potential to transcend time, with some literary predecessors being read in terms of their contemporary successor. In contrast, writers who cannot prevail over this anxiety of influence are deemed 'weak', with their works regarded as markedly derivative and reminiscent of the works of earlier literary masters. Some great poets in which Bloom draws upon, who have overcome this anxiety of influence include Wordsworth, Shelley and Wallace Stevens.\n\nIn order to determine the effects of this theory on literature, Bloom has established the six \"revisionary ratios\", which are occasionally based on the model of Freud's defense mechanisms. These ratios show the developmental stages of anxiety of influence in relation to the ways a poet or author misreads and deforms the work of a literary precursor in the composition of a literary text.\n\n\n"}

It removes sorrows. According to Indian Philosophy, the three traditional kinds of knowledge are – \"pratyaksha\" (empirical), \"paroksha\" (conventional, universal) and \"aparoksha\" (transcendental). \"Aparoksha\" is the highest kind of knowledge which cannot be gained without the practice of morality that converts \"paroksha\" knowledge from which unity of existence is derived. This knowledge is gained by establishing a \"guru-shishya sambandha\" (Guru-shishya tradition) with a teacher who has already experienced that kind of knowledge (Aparoksanubhuti); the karma or acts required to be done, after gain of \"Aparoksha jnana\" is \"Vidya-karma\" which consists in \"sravana\" (hearing of srutis), \"manana\" (reflection) and \"nididhyasana\" (meditation on Brahman). \n\nAparoksha is \"savikalpa jnana\" (knowledge) when one re-recognizes the non-dual nature of the ever-realized Self (Tat Tvam Asi), it is the immediate knowledge gained through the \"pramanas\"; practice of \"Dhyana\" (meditation) removes all \"vikalpas\" (varied thoughts) and leads to \"nirvikalpa\" or the thoughtless state, which is the highest experience, the immediate realization of Truth. It is the method of cessation from individual and collective perception leading to the position of neutrality. \"Sarvam khalvidam Brahman\" (all this is Brahman) is \"paroksha\" knowledge, but the understanding that \"Aham Brahman Asmi\" (I am Brahman) is \"aparoksha\" knowledge.\n"}
{"id": "50123", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50123", "title": "Autocracy", "text": "Autocracy\n\nAn autocracy is a system of government in which supreme power is concentrated in the hands of one person, whose decisions are subject to neither external legal restraints nor regularized mechanisms of popular control (except perhaps for the implicit threat of a coup d'état or mass insurrection). Absolute monarchies (such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Brunei and Swaziland) and dictatorships (such as Turkmenistan and North Korea) are the main modern-day forms of autocracy.\n\nIn earlier times, the term \"autocrat\" was coined as a favorable feature of the ruler, having some connection to the concept of \"lack of conflicts of interests\" as well as an indication of grandeur and power. The Russian Tsar for example was styled, \"Autocrat of all the Russians\", as late as the early 20th century.\n\nAutocracy comes from the Ancient Greek \"autós\" (self) and \"krátos\" (power, strength) from Kratos, the Greek personification of authority. In the Medieval Greek language, the term \"Autocrates\" was used for anyone holding the title \"emperor\", regardless of the actual power of the monarch. Some historical Slavic monarchs, such as Russian tsars and emperors, included the title \"Autocrat\" as part of their official styles, distinguishing them from the constitutional monarchs elsewhere in Europe.\n\nBoth totalitarianism and military dictatorship are often identified with, but need not be, an autocracy. Totalitarianism is a system where the state strives to control every aspect of life and civil society. It can be headed by a supreme leader, making it autocratic, but it can also have a collective leadership such as a commune, junta, or single political party.\n\nIn an analysis of militarized disputes between two states, if one of the states involved was an autocracy the chance of violence occurring doubled.\n\nExamples from early modern Europe suggests early statehood was favorable for democracy. But, according to Jacob Hariri, outside Europe, history shows that early statehood has led to autocracy. The reasons he gives are: continuation of the original autocratic rule and absence of \"institutional transplantation\" or European settlement. This may be because of the country's capacity to fight colonization or the presence of state infrastructure that Europeans did not need to build new institutions to rule. In all the cases, representative institutions were unable to get introduced in these countries and they sustained their autocratic rule. European colonization was varied and conditional on many factors. Countries which were rich in natural resources had an extractive and indirect rule, whereas other colonies saw European settlement. Because of this settlement, these countries possibly experienced setting up of new institutions. Colonization also depended on factor endowments and settler mortality.\n\nMancur Olson theorizes the development of autocracies as the first transition from anarchy to state. Anarchy for Olson is characterized by a number of \"roving bandits\" who travel around many different geographic areas extorting wealth from local populations leaving little incentive for populations to invest, and produce. As local populations lose the incentive to produce, there is little wealth for either the bandits to steal or the people to use. Olson theorizes autocrats as \"stationary bandits\" who solve this dilemma by establishing control over a small fiefdom and monopolize the extortion of wealth in the fiefdom in the form of taxes. Once an autocracy is developed, Olson theorizes that both the autocrat and the local population will be better off as the autocrat will have an \"encompassing interest\" in the maintenance and growth of wealth in the fiefdom. Because violence threatens the creation of rents, the \"stationary bandit\" has incentives to monopolize violence and to create a peaceful order.\n\nDouglass North, John Joseph Wallis and Barry R. Weingast describe autocracies as limited access orders that arise from this need to monopolize violence. In contrast to Olson, these scholars understand the early state not as a single ruler, but as an organization formed by many actors. They describe the process of autocratic state formation as a bargaining process among individuals with access to violence. For them, these individuals form a dominant coalition that grants each other privileges such as the access to resources. As violence reduces the rents, members of the dominant coalition have incentives to cooperate and to avoid fighting. A limited access to privileges is necessary to avoid competition among the members of the dominant coalition, who then will credibly commit to cooperate and will form the state.\n\nBecause autocrats need a power structure to rule, it can be difficult to draw a clear line between historical autocracies and oligarchies. Most historical autocrats depended on their nobles, the military, the priesthood, or other elite groups. Some autocracies are rationalized by assertion of divine right.\n\nAccording to Douglass North, John Joseph Wallis and Barry R. Weingast, in limited access orders the state is ruled by a dominant coalition formed by a small elite group that relates to each other by personal relationships. In order to remain in power, this elite hinders people outside the dominant coalition to access organizations and resources. Autocracy, then, is maintained as long as the personal relationships of the elite continue to forge the dominant coalition. These scholars further suggest that once the dominant coalition starts to become broader and allow for impersonal relationships, limited access orders can give place to open access orders.\n\nFor Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson and James Robinson, the allocation of political power explains the maintenance of autocracies, which they usually refer to as \"extractive states\". For them, the de jure political power comes from political institutions, whereas the de facto political power is determined by the distribution of resources. Those holding the political power in the present will design the political and economic institutions in the future according to their interests. In autocracies, both de jure and de facto political powers are concentrated in one person or a small elite that will promote institutions for keeping the de jure political power as concentrated as the de facto political power, thereby maintaining autocratic regimes with extractive institutions.\n\nIt has been argued that authoritarian regimes, such as China and Russia, have attempted to export their system of government to other countries through \"autocracy promotion\". A number of scholars are skeptical that China and Russia have successfully exported authoritarianism abroad.\n\nThe Roman Empire: In 27 B.C., Augustus founded the Roman Empire following the end of the Roman Republic. Augustus officially kept the Roman Senate while effectively consolidating all of the real power in himself. Rome was peaceful and prosperous until the dictatorial rule of Commodus starting in 180 A.D. The third century saw invasions from the barbarians as well as economic decline. Both Diocletian and Constantine ruled as autocratic leaders, strengthening the control of the emperor. The empire grew extremely large, and was ruled by a tetrarchy, instituted by Diocletian. Eventually, it was split into two halves: the Western (Roman) and the Eastern (Byzantine). The Western Roman Empire fell in 476 after civic unrest, further economic decline, and invasions led to the surrender of Romulus Augustus to Odoacer, a German king.\n\nAztec Empire: In Mesoamerica, the Aztecs were a tremendous military powerhouse that earned a fearsome reputation of capturing prisoners during battle to be used for sacrificial rituals. The priesthood supported a pantheon that demanded human sacrifice, and the nobility consisted mainly of warriors who had captured many prisoners for these sacrificial rites. The Aztec Emperor hence functioned both as the sole ruler of the empire and its military forces, and as the religious figurehead behind the empire's aggressive foreign policy.\n\nChile under the dictatorship of Pinochet\n\nTsarist and Imperial Russia: Shortly after being crowned as ruler, Tsar Ivan immediately removed his political enemies by execution or exile and established dominance over an Empire, expanding the borders of his kingdom dramatically. To enforce his rule, Ivan the Terrible established the Streltzy as Russia's standing army, and he developed two cavalry divisions that were fiercely loyal to the Tsar; the Cossacks, and the Oprichniki. In his later years, Ivan made orders for his forces to sack the city of Novgorod in fear of being overthrown. The ideology Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Nationality was introduced by Emperor Nicholas I of Russia.\n\nTokugawa Shogunate: Medieval Japan was caught in a vicious series of skirmishes between warring clans, states, and rulers, all of them vying for power in a mad scramble. While many of these lords struggled against each other openly, Ieyasu Tokugawa seized mastery of all of Japan through a mix of superior tactics and cunning diplomacy, until he became the dominant power of the land. By establishing his shogunate as the sole ruling power in Japan, Ieyasu Tokugawa and his successors controlled all aspects of life, closing the borders of Japan to all foreign nations and ruling with a policy of isolationism.\n\nNazi Germany: After the failed Beer Hall Putsch, the National Socialist German Workers' Party began a more subtle political strategy to take over the government. Following a tense social and political environment in the 1930s, the Nazis under Adolf Hitler took advantage of the civil unrest of the state to seize power through cunning propaganda and by the charismatic speeches of their party leader. By the time Hitler was appointed chancellor, the Nazi party began to restrict civil liberties on the public following the Reichstag Fire. With a combination of cooperation and intimidation, Hitler and his party systematically weakened all opposition to his rule, transforming the Weimar Republic into a fascist dictatorship where Hitler alone spoke and acted on behalf of Germany. Nazi Germany is an example of an autocracy run primarily by a single leader, but many decisions made by Hitler coincided with the interests and ideology of the Nazi Party in mind, also making an example of an autocracy ruled by a political party rather than solely one man.\n\nSoviet Union: During Joseph Stalin's rule.\n\nSpain: During Francisco Franco's rule.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "10698861", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10698861", "title": "Consideration", "text": "Consideration\n\nConsideration is a concept of English common law and is a necessity for simple contracts but not for special contracts (contracts by deed). The concept has been adopted by other common law jurisdictions, including the US.\n\nThe court in \"Currie v Misa\" declared consideration to be a “Right, Interest, Profit, Benefit, or Forbearance, Detriment, Loss, Responsibility”. Thus, consideration is a promise of something of value given by a promissor in exchange for something of value given by a promisee; and typically the thing of value is goods, money, or an act. Forbearance to act, such as an adult promising to refrain from smoking, is enforceable only if one is thereby surrendering a legal right.\n\nConsideration may be thought of as the concept of value offered and accepted by people or organisations entering into contracts. Anything of value promised by one party to the other when making a contract can be treated as \"consideration\": for example, if A signs a contract to buy a car from B for $5,000, A's consideration is the $5,000, and B's consideration is the car.\n\nAdditionally, if A signs a contract with B such that A will paint B's house for $500, A's consideration is the service of painting B's house, and B's consideration is $500 paid to A. Further, if A signs a contract with B such that A will \"not\" repaint his own house in any other color than white, and B will pay A $500 per year to keep this deal up, there is also consideration. Although A did not promise to affirmatively do anything, A did promise \"not\" to do something that he was allowed to do, and so A did pass consideration. A's consideration to B is the \"forbearance\" in painting his own house in a color other than white, and B's consideration to A is $500 per year. Conversely, if A signs a contract to buy a car from B for $0, B's consideration is still the car, but A is giving no consideration, and so there is no valid contract. However, if B still gives the title to the car to A, then B cannot take the car back, since, while it may not be a valid contract, it \"is\" a valid gift.\n\nIn common law it is a prerequisite that both parties offer consideration before a contract can be thought of as binding. The doctrine of consideration is irrelevant in many jurisdictions, although contemporary commercial litigant relations have held the relationship between a promise and a deed is a reflection of the nature of contractual considerations. If there is no element of consideration found, there is thus no contract formed.\n\nHowever, even if a court decides there is no contract, there might be a possible recovery under the doctrines of \"quantum meruit\" (sometimes referred to as a quasi-contract) or promissory estoppel.\n\nThere are a number of common issues as to whether consideration exists in a contract:\n\nSystems based on Roman law (including Germany and Scotland) do not require consideration, and some commentators consider it unnecessary and have suggested that the doctrine of consideration should be abandoned, and estoppel used to replace it as a basis for contracts. However, [[legislation]], rather than judicial development, has been touted as the only way to remove this entrenched common law doctrine. [[Lord Denning|Lord Justice Denning]] famously stated that \"The doctrine of consideration is too firmly fixed to be overthrown by a side-wind\".\n\nThe reason that both exist in common law jurisdictions is thought by leading scholars to be the result of the combining by 19th century judges of two distinct threads: first the consideration requirement was at the heart of the action of [[assumpsit]], which had grown up in medieval times and remained the normal action for breach of a simple contract in England and Wales until 1884, when the old forms of action were abolished; secondly, the notion of agreement between two or more parties as being the essential legal and moral foundation of contract in all legal systems, was promoted by the 18th century French writer Pothier in his \"Traite des Obligations\", much read (especially after translation into English in 1805) by English judges and jurists. The latter chimed well with the fashionable will theories of the time, especially [[John Stuart Mill]]'s influential ideas on free will, and got grafted on to the traditional common law requirement for consideration to ground an action in assumpsit.\n\n[[Civil law (legal system)|Civil law]] systems take the approach that an exchange of promises, or a concurrence of wills alone, rather than an exchange in valuable rights is the correct basis. So if A promises to give B a book, and B accepts the offer without giving anything in return, B would have a legal right to the book and A could not change her mind about giving it to B as a gift. However, in [[common law system]]s the concept of \"[[culpa in contrahendo]]\", a form of [[estoppel]], is increasingly used to create obligations during [[pre-contractual negotiations]]. Estoppel is an [[Equity (law)|equitable doctrine]] that provides for the creation of legal obligations if a party has given another an [[wikt:assurance|assurance]] and the other has relied on the assurance to his [[detriment (law)|detriment]].\n\nGenerally, courts do not inquire whether the deal between two parties was monetarily fair—merely that each party passed some legal obligation or duty to the other party. The dispositive issue is presence of consideration, not adequacy of the consideration. The values between consideration passed by each party to a contract need not be comparable.\n\nFor instance, if A offers B $200 to buy B's mansion, luxury sports car, and private jet, there is still consideration on both sides. A's consideration is $200, and B's consideration is the mansion, car, and jet. Courts in the United States generally leave parties to their own contracts, and do not intervene. The old English rule of consideration questioned whether a party gave the \"value of a [[peppercorn (legal)|peppercorn]]\" to the other party. As a result, contracts in the United States have sometimes have had one party pass nominal amounts of consideration, typically citing $1. Thus, licensing contracts that do not involve any money at all often cite as consideration, \"for the sum of $1 and other good and valuable consideration.\"\n\nHowever, some courts in the United States may take issue with nominal consideration, or consideration with virtually no value. Some courts have since thought this was a sham. Since contract disputes are typically resolved in state court, some state courts have found that merely providing $1 to another is not a sufficiently legal duty, and therefore no legal consideration passes in these kinds of deals, and consequently, no contract is formed. However, this is a minority position.\n\nA party that \"already\" has a legal duty to provide money, an object, a service, or a forbearance, does not provide consideration when promising merely to uphold that duty. That legal duty can arise from law, or obligation under a previous contract.\n\nThe prime example of this sub-issue is where an uncle gives his seven-year-old nephew (a resident of the US) the following offer: \"if you do not smoke cigarettes or marijuana until your 18th birthday, then I will pay you $500\". On the nephew's 18th birthday, he tells the uncle to pay up, and the uncle says no. In the subsequent lawsuit, the uncle wins, because the nephew, by U.S. criminal law, already had a duty to refrain from smoking cigarettes while under 18, or marijuana at any age.\n\nThe same applies if the consideration is a performance for which the parties had previously contracted. For example, A agrees to paint B's house for $500, but halfway through the job A tells B that he will not finish unless B increases the payment to $750. If B agrees, and A then finishes the job, B still only needs to pay A the $500 originally agreed to, because A was already contractually obligated to paint the house for that amount.\n\nAn exception to this rule holds for [[settlement (litigation)|settlement]]s, such as an [[accord and satisfaction]]. If a creditor has a credit against a debtor for $10,000, and offers to settle it for $5,000, it is still binding, if accepted, even though the debtor had a legal duty to repay the entire $10,000.\n\nPre-existing duties relating to [[at-will employment]] depend largely on state law. Generally, [[at-will employment]] allows the employer to terminate the employee for good or even no reason, and allows the employee to resign for any reason. There are no duties of continued employment in the future. Therefore, when an employee demands a raise, there is no issue with consideration because the employee has no legal duty to continue working. Similarly, when an employer demands a pay-cut, there is also no contractual issue with consideration, because the employer has no legal duty to continue employing the worker. However, certain states require additional consideration other than the prospect of continued employment, to enforce terms demanded later by the employer, in particular, non-competition clauses.\n\nContracts where a legally valueless term is bundled with a term that does have legal value are still generally enforceable.\n\nConsider the uncle's situation above. If the same uncle had instead told his 17-year-old nephew the following offer: \"if you do not smoke cigarettes and do not engage females before your 18th birthday, then I will pay you $500\". On the nephew's 18th birthday, he asks the uncle to pay up, and this time, in the subsequent lawsuit, the nephew may win. Although the promise of not smoking was not valuable consideration (it was already legally prohibited), virtually all states allow some sort of engagement by minors. Even though the engagement by minors is legally restricted, there are circumstances where it is legal, and thus the promise to forbear from it entirely has legal value. However, the uncle would still be relieved from the liability if his nephew smoked a cigarette, even though \"that\" consideration is valueless, because it was paired with something of legal value; therefore, adherence to the entire, collective agreement is necessary.\n\nGenerally, past consideration is not a valid consideration and has no legal value. Past consideration is consideration that has already flowed from the promisee to the promisor. That is, the promisee's act or forbearance predates the promisor's promise. Past consideration therefore cannot be used as a basis when claiming damages.\n\nAn exception to this rule is where there is a duty owed to a third party. An act done before the giving of a promise to make a payment or to confer some other benefit can sometimes be consideration for the promise. For this to hold, three conditions must be satisfied (Pao On v Lau Yiu Long [1980]):\n\n\nGenerally, conditional consideration is valid consideration.\n\nSuppose A is a movie script writer and B runs a movie production company. A says to B, \"buy my script.\" B says \"How about this – I will pay you $5,000 so that you do not let anyone else produce your movie until one year from now. If I do produce your movie in that year, then I will give you another $50,000, and no one else can produce it. If I do not produce your movie in that year, then you're free to go.\" If the two subsequently get into a dispute, the issue of whether a contract exists is answered. B had an option contract—he could decide to produce the script, or not. B's consideration passed was the $5,000 down, and the possibility of $50,000. A's consideration passed was the exclusive rights to the movie script for at least one year.\n\nSuppose B commits a [[tort]] against A, causing $5,000 in [[compensatory damages]] and $3,000 in [[punitive damages]]. Since there is no guarantee that A would win against B if it went to court, A may agree to drop the case if B pays the $5,000 compensatory damages. This is sufficient consideration, since B's consideration is a guaranteed recovery, and A's consideration is that B only has to pay $5,000, instead of $8,000.\n\n\n[[Category:Contract law]]\n[[Category:Legal doctrines and principles]]"}

{"id": "385241", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=385241", "title": "Emotional intimacy", "text": "Emotional intimacy\n\nEmotional intimacy is an aspect of interpersonal relationships that varies in intensity from one relationship to another and varies from one time to another, much like physical intimacy. Emotional intimacy involves a perception of closeness to another that allows sharing of personal feelings, accompanied by expectations of understanding, affirmation, and demonstration of caring.\n\nEmotional intimacy can be expressed in verbal and non-verbal communication. The degree of comfort, effectiveness, and mutual experience of closeness might indicate emotional intimacy between individuals. Intimate communication is both expressed (e.g. talking) and implied (e.g. friends sitting close on a park bench in silence).\n\nEmotional intimacy depends primarily on trust, as well as the nature of the relationship and the culture in which it is observed. Emotional intimacy is different from sexual intimacy. Sexual intimacy can take place with or without emotional intimacy. Sexual intimacy differs from emotional intimacy because it often does not occur within any kind of sexual context. Emotional intimacy is a psychological event that happens when trust levels and communication between two people are such that it fosters the mutual sharing of one another's deepest selves. Depending on the background and conventions of the participants, emotional intimacy might involve disclosing thoughts, feelings and emotions in order to reach an understanding, offer mutual support or build a sense of community. Or it might involve sharing a duty, without commentary.\n\nDeep intimacy requires a high level of transparency and openness. Conversation is a key point in every emotional intimate relationship. For example, a long-distance relationship is purely based on conversation. A long-distance relationship can be stronger, in comparison to a normal one, because it forces the two partners to enhance the conversation process. This involves a degree of vulnerability that can feel uncomfortable or anxiety-producing to many individuals. These feelings do, however, tend to diminish and even dissolve over time and with practice. Couples who partake in this act of emotional intimacy are able to be more comfortable with each other. They feel they can share their dreams and their positive characteristics, along with the negative characteristics that they may have. There are great moments and also tough moments that come along within a relationship. Emotional intimacy is being able to communicate your feelings to show how much you care. It is important to practice emotional intimacy in relationships. A lack of emotional intimacy could be solved by taking the time to be with your partner throughout the duration of your relationships. Many specialists suggest that talking about problems as soon as they arise is wise to continue emotional intimacy. Being honest, expressing appreciation, and routinely communicating also keeps stable emotional intimacy.\n\nThe interdependence between all the individuals contains our freedom. By maintaining a strong relationship, individuals need to follow written and unwritten rules to permit a community life. They also ask for services to different people to fulfill the mandatory aspects of their life. It is impossible for an individual to occupy all the positions in society that he or she needs, to be able to live in this society. So, the individual is constantly forced to be dependent of people that he or she did not choose or has selected by default. But, according to Hegel, the individual chooses with whom to have an intimate relationship, and thus can have more freedom and choice to be \"ourselves\". This freedom is even more important because it allows the individual not to be the subject of public property or of private secrecy. The emotional intimacy can be seen as a bubble, an exception which permits to separate the individual. Paradoxically, this intimacy, with Love for example, creates a stronger self-confidence which is developed by a process of socialization. So emotional intimacy also permits to be easily integrated in society. The individual stays dependent of the social process because the intimate relationships can be framed by society. For example, a family or a couple needs to declare their status and follow government laws.\n\nBeing more emotionally invested in a relationship than the other partner can be considered as a loss of power. Emotional intimacy can also enhance the physical and physiologic well-being. The individual is stronger to be a part of the social process and thus, he can have a more powerful impact to make evolve the values’ system of the society. Emotional intimacy can be shared with not just your partner in life, but with friends, family, colleagues, even pets.\n\nEmotional intimacy is difficult to create because of social barriers or norms. For example, emotional intimacy between men is hard to create owing to the role of masculinity in society: the competition pressure, the fear of vulnerability, being homophobe. Men have a lot of best friends of the same sex but a big majority discuss important topics and decisions with their female friends. Society determines or at least has a strong influence on the building of an emotional intimate relationship.\n\nThe 5-item Emotional Intimacy Scale (EIS) is a scale which enables to evaluate the emotional intimacy in a relationship. Its goal is to predict the different outcomes produced by the existence of an intimate relationship.\n\nThis scale is created with a study of different items which are fundamental components of an intimate relationship. Some persons need to answer to a questionnaire. They answer to judge the degree of truth of each of these components in comparison with their actual situation. There are five of them: \nThese results are putting in correlation with specific values which characterize an individual such as psychological and physical well-being, social support, and health.\n\nThe results provided by the scale prove a positive relationship between an increase of EIS and an increase for the individual of social support, self-efficiency, life satisfaction and other positive effects. It also shows the negative relation between a decrease of EIS and an increase of stress, pain, and fatigue for the individual. An intimate relationship gives a sentiment of purpose and belonging which increases the physiological and psychological well-being.\n"}

Members of Equinet have been established on the basis of the EU equal treatment Directives and they are empowered to counteract discrimination across the range of grounds including age, disability, gender, race or ethnic origin, religion or belief, and sexual orientation.\n\nEquinet builds upon the two-year project \"Strengthening the co-operation between specialised bodies for the implementation of equal treatment legislation\" (2002-2004). The initiative to create a network of equality bodies was taken by the Migration Policy Group, who also acted as Equinet's Secretariat until 2007. Equinet was established as an independent structure in 2007 with the creation of the Equinet Secretariat in Brussels and its registration as a not-for-profit international association (AISBL) under Belgian law.\n\nEquinet is the European network of equality bodies. The network promotes equality in Europe through supporting and enabling the work of national equality bodies. It supports equality bodies to be independent and effective as valuable catalysts for more equal societies.

In Heidegger's philosophy, people are thrown into the world in a given situation, but they are also a project towards the future, possibility, freedom, wait, hope, anguish. In contrast with the philosopher Kierkegaard, Heidegger wanted to explore the problem of \"Dasein\" existentially (\"existenzial\"), rather than existentielly (\"existenziell\") because Heidegger argued Kierkegaard had already described the latter with \"penetrating fashion\".\n\nBesides Heidegger, other existential phenomenologists were Hannah Arendt, Karl Jaspers, Emmanuel Levinas, Gabriel Marcel, Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, Frantz Fanon, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and Samuel Todes.\n\nExistential phenomenology extends also to other disciplines. For example, Leo Steinberg's essay \"The Philosophical Brothel\" describes Picasso's \"Les Demoiselles d'Avignon\" in a perspective that is existential-phenomenological.

{"id": "33685498", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33685498", "title": "Forrest Yoga", "text": "Forrest Yoga\n\nForrest Yoga is a modern yoga style based on Hatha yoga. It was created by and named for Ana T. Forrest, an American yogini. It is known for \"its long holding of positions, emphasis on abdominal core work, and standing series that can go on for 20 poses on each side\". Reputed for its intensity, the style emphasizes connecting to one's feelings in order to work through physical and emotional trauma.\n\nForrest derived her practice from some aspects of Sivananda yoga, along with attention to alignment and use of props found in Iyengar yoga, and the heat and flowing sequences of Ashtanga vinyasa yoga. As the style evolved, she created a number of additional poses and sequences adapted to modern society,\nsuch as wrist stretches to prevent and relieve carpal tunnel syndrome. Forrest wrist stretches are also important \"to warm up and stretch out the hands and wrists before their usual yoga practice. First, stretch each finger open one at a time, by grasping the finger and pulling it back for one breath. You should feel the stretch in the fingers and across the palm and a little into the forearm. Next, place all of the fingers on the floor or a table with the fingertips facing toward your torso. Stretch the fingers, but not the palm of the hand, down toward the surface. From that position, see if you can stretch the whole palm down, though you may not make it the whole way. Finally, extend the arms straight out from your shoulders, parallel to the floor. Curl the fingers one by one into the palm, starting with the little finger and ending with the thumb, forming a fist. First, curl the fist in toward the underside of the wrist and then stretch it out. Repeat this exercise a few times before you put weight on your hands.\" She also created shoulder shrugs to relieve tension and loosen the upper back, abdominal exercises to tone internal organs and strengthen the lower back, and a number of poses using a folded over and rolled up yoga mat.\n\nForrest Yoga classes are conducted in a warm room () and begin with pranayama, then move through seated poses and abs before arriving on to the \"hot part\" of the class that might involve sun salutations, standing poses, inversions, backbends and other asanas that build up to a number of more challenging \"apex\" poses. The \"contemplative, intensive poses are sustained, some for 10 deep breaths, others for minutes at a time\".\n\nForrest Yoga's vision and mission is \"to mend the hoop of the people\". Ana T. Forrest wrote, \"I began to read about Black Elk, a healer and Medicine Man of the Oglala Lakota Sioux. He's best known for sharing the teachings of the Sioux with a white man named John Neihardt (who earned the name Flaming Rainbow), who published them as \"Black Elk Speaks\". In that book, he shared a powerful vision he'd received through a 'rainbow door' when he was nine years old, about his mission to protect a 'medicine wheel' around a sacred tree on the 'good red road' that is the true good medicine of the native peoples. At the time Black Elk had his vision, the assault on the traditions of the Sioux was well under way; their culture and Spirit were dying out. Black Elk proclaimed, 'The Rainbow Hoop of the People has been broken.' He wanted to restore it, and this became his life's work...reading about Black Elk's life's work helped me to articulate my own—I call it Mending the Rainbow Hoop of the People.\" In this style, \"the healing aspect of Forrest Yoga extends to the emotional body. Students are encouraged to breathe into tight spots or places where they feel stagnant energy in order to free up emotional issues that may be stored there.\"\n\nThe style is founded on four principles, or \"pillars\":\n\nSome sources cite a fifth pillar exemplified by the style's motto, \"Go Deeper\".\n\nForrest Yoga's physical practice uses a number of \"basic moves\" in every pose up until Savasana. Many of these moves resemble those practiced in other yoga styles, such as Ujjayi breath and tucking the tailbone, while others are unique to this style, particularly the practice of relaxing the neck and wrapping the shoulders. Overall emphasis is on breath work and core strengthening.\n\n\nAnother part of Forrest Yoga practice is development of feeling connections between one part of the body and another. As Forrest noted, \"I call this synaptic bridging. Synaptic bridging helps the brain make more intelligent mind-body connections.\"\n\n"}

Gift cards are also given out by retailers and marketers as part of a promotion strategy, to entice the recipient to come in or return to the store, and at times such cards are called cash cards. Gift cards are generally redeemable only for purchases at the relevant retail premises and cannot be cashed out, and in some situations may be subject to an expiry date or fees. Visa and MasterCard credit cards produce generic gift cards which need not be redeemed at particular stores, and which are widely used for cashback marketing strategies. A feature of these cards is that they are generally anonymous and are disposed of when the stored value on a card is exhausted.\n\nFrom the purchaser's point of view, a gift card is a gift, given in place of an object which the recipient may not need, when the giving of cash as a present may be regarded as socially inappropriate. In the United States, gift cards are highly popular, ranking in 2006 as the second-most given gift by consumers and the most-wanted gift by women, and the third-most wanted by males. Gift cards have become increasingly popular as they relieve the donor of selecting a specific gift. In 2012, nearly 50% of all US consumers claimed to have purchased a gift card as a present during the holiday season. In Canada, $1.8 billion was spent on gift cards, and in the UK it is estimated to have reached £3 billion in 2009, whereas in the United States about US$80 billion was paid for gift cards in 2006. The recipient of a gift card can use it at their discretion within the restrictions set by the issue, for example as to validity period and businesses that accept a particular card.\n\nThe first giftcard using a payments infrastructure was introduced by Neiman Marcus in late 1994, though Blockbuster Entertainment was the first company to do so at a wide scale, test-marketing them in 1995 and launching them around the country the next year. In the beginning, the Blockbuster giftcard replaced gift certificates that were being counterfeited with recently introduced color copiers and color printers. Blockbuster's first giftcard transactions were processed by what was then Nabanco of Sunrise, Florida. Nabanco was the developer of the first third-party platform for the processing of giftcards using existing payment infrastructure.\n\nNeiman Marcus and Blockbuster were later followed by the Mobil gas card which initially offered prepaid phone value provided by MCI. Kmart was next with the introduction of the Kmart Cash Card which in the early generations provided prepaid phone time with AT&T. Later this feature was dropped as it was not profitable for both Kmart and Mobil. The Kmart Mags Pangilinan Cash Card was the first replacement for cash returns when a shopper did not have a receipt for a gift. This practice of giving a cash card in place of cash for non-receipted returns is common place today with most merchants. From these early introductions, other retailers began to adapt a giftcard program to replace their gift certificate programs.\n\nA gift card may resemble a credit card or display a specific theme on a plastic card the size of a credit card. The card is identified by a specific number or code, not usually with an individual name, and thus could be used by anybody. They are backed by an on-line electronic system for authorization. Some gift cards can be reloaded by payment and can be used thus multiple times.\n\nCards may have a barcode or magnetic strip, which is read by an electronic credit card machine. Many cards have no value until they are sold, at which time the cashier enters the amount which the customer wishes to put on the card. This amount is rarely stored on the card but is instead noted in the store's database, which is crosslinked to the card ID. Gift cards thus are generally not stored-value cards as used in many public transport systems or library photocopiers, where a simplified system (with no network) stores the value only on the card itself. To thwart counterfeiting, the data is encrypted. The magnetic strip is also often placed differently than on credit cards, so they cannot be read or written with standard equipment. Other gift cards may have a set value and need to be activated by calling a specific number.\n\nGift cards can also be custom tailored to meet specific needs. By adding a custom message or name on the front of the card, it can make for an individualized gift or incentive to an employee to show how greatly they are appreciated.\n\nGift cards are divided into \"open loop\" or \"network\" cards and \"closed loop\" cards. The former are issued by banks or credit card companies and can be redeemed by different establishments, the latter by a specific store or restaurant and can be only redeemed by the issuing provider. The latter, however, tend to have fewer problems with card value decay and fees. In either case the giver would buy the gift card (and may have to pay an additional purchase or activation fee), and the recipient of the card would use the value of the card at a later transaction. A third form is the \"hybrid closed loop\" card where the issuer has bundled a number of closed loop cards; an example is free gift cards for a specific mall.\n\nGift cards differ from gift certificates, in that the latter are usually sold as a paper document with an authorized signature by a restaurant, store, or other individual establishment as a voucher for a future service; there is no electronic authorization. A gift certificate may or may not have an expiration date and generally has no administrative fees.\n\nBank-issued gift cards may be used in lieu of checks as a way to disburse rebate funds. Some retailers use the gift card system for refunds in lieu of cash thereby assuring that the customer will spend the funds at their store.\n\nA Charity Gift Card allows the gift giver to make a charitable donation, and the gift recipient to choose a charity that will receive the donation.\n\nMobile gift cards are delivered to mobile phones via email or SMS and phone apps allow users to carry only their cell phone. Benefits include tying them to a particular phone number and ease of distribution.\n\nVirtual gift cards are delivered via e-mail to the recipient, the benefits being that they cannot be lost and that the consumer does not have to drive to the bricks and mortar location to purchase a gift card.\n\nOther companies have introduced virtual gift cards that users redeem on their smartphones. As the merchant is not involved in the loop, it is considered a cash transfer rather than a traditional gift card.\n\nIt has been argued that holiday giving destroys value due to mismatching gifts. The most efficient way to keep value in gifting would be to give cash; however, this is socially acceptable only within limits. Gift cards, to a degree, may overcome this problem but have certain pitfalls. Some feel that the absence of the thought of selecting a specific gift makes a gift card a worse choice than a poorly executed but individual gift. New products in the gift card industry are evolving to tackle this \"impersonal\" pitfall of gift cards. New services launched by some service providers allows for customization and personalization of gift cards.\n\nGift cards have been criticized for the ability of the issuer to set rules that are detrimental to the purchaser or card recipient. For example, gift cards may be subject to an expiry date, administrative fees, restrictions on use, and absence of adequate protection in case of fraud or loss. Over time fees may render the value of a gift card zero. However, these issues have been addressed in recent years in some jurisdictions. In the United States, many jurisdictions limit or prohibit all fees or expiration dates for gift cards. Further, because of the negative impact on sales that such policies can have, most merchants have adopted and even advertise a \"no fee, no expiration\" policy for their gift cards, whether or not state laws require it. In 2011, an estimated 2.5% of gift cards were subject to an expiration date and 2.7% to post-sale fees.\n\nA quarter of gift card recipients still have not spent gift cards a year after receiving them, according to a Consumer Reports survey. And a majority of people say they end up spending more than the value of the card once they get to the store.\n\nIn the event of the bankruptcy of the issuing retailer, the outstanding value on gift cards is considered unsecured debt, and as such gift cards may become valueless. If the company intends to continue trading, gift cards may be honoured even in bankruptcy.\n\nAnother issue regarding gift cards are the growing concerns from retailers and other businesses about what can be done to prevent gift cards from being exploited by fraudsters. Gift card information can either be stolen from their rightful owners by fraudsters or they can be purchased with stolen credit card information. In recent years, cybercriminals have increased their efforts to take advantage of fraudulent gift cards as they are simple to exploit with automated brute-force bot attacks. The most common form of gift card fraud is committed through the act of stealing card information for activated cards with an existing balance by attacking a retailer’s systems which store gift card data. Once a gift card has been compromised, the fraudster will then check the balance through online customer portals before using the funds or reselling on the secondary gift card market.\n\nNot all gift cards are redeemed. The card may be lost; there may be time decay (expiration and fees) or complex rules of redemption; the recipient may not be interested in the store that accepts the card or be under the false assumption that not using it will save money for the giver. It has been estimated that perhaps 10% of cards are not redeemed, amounting to a gain for retailers of about $8 billion in the United States in 2006.\n\nIn 2012, over $100 billion in gift cards will be purchased in the United States, where over 20% of those gift cards will go unredeemed or unused. This has amassed a large opportunity in the secondary market, similar to the secondary ticket market in the early 2000s. Some companies have created a business in the secondary gift card market that allow consumers to sell their unused gift cards or buy discounted gift cards to their favorite brands. This has helped their users recoup their share of some $55 million per day that goes unredeemed in the United States every year, by turning their unused gift cards into cash.\n\nAll Canadian provinces have legislations passed to ban expiry dates and fees collected on gift cards. However, provincial gift card legislations do not apply to sectors that are regulated under federal laws. For example, gift cards that resemble credit cards (i.e. with Visa, MasterCard or American Express branding) and phone cards are regulated by the federal government. Under the federal \"Prepaid Payment Products Regulations\", effective May 1, 2014, federally regulated gift cards may only charge maintenance fees under certain conditions, and may not set an expiry date for funds on those cards.\n\nIn the past, uniform standards concerning gift cards did not exist. This was set to change as an addendum to the Credit CARD Act of 2009 directs the federal government to create consumer-friendly standards pertaining to gift cards. Most notably, the new regulations prohibit retailers from setting expiration dates unless they are at least 5 years after the card’s date of issue or the date on which funds were last added to the card. In addition, retailers are no longer able to assess dormancy, inactivity, or service fees unless the card has been inactive for at least 12 months, and if fees are added after that period, the details of such fees must be clearly disclosed on the card. Additionally, retailers are unable to levy more than one fee per month. The new provisions took effect on August 22, 2010.\n\nOpen loop cards are governed by rules of the Comptroller of the Currency, however oversight has been criticized. Closed loop gift cards are subject to rules set by different state regulations, and issuing authorities vary widely in the rules they set for the consumer. Rules can be changed by the issuer without notifying the consumer.\n\n"}

In this metaphor, Indra's net has a multifaceted jewel at each vertex, and each jewel is reflected in all of the other jewels. \n\nIn the Huayan school of Chinese Buddhism, which follows the Avatamsaka Sutra, the image of \"Indra's net\" is used to describe the interconnectedness of the universe. Francis H Cook describes Indra's net thus:\n\nThe Buddha in the Avatamsaka Sutra's 30th book states a similar idea:\n\nBook 30 of the sutra is named \"The Incalculable\" because it focuses on the idea of the infinitude of the universe and as Cleary notes, concludes that \"the cosmos is unutterably infinite, and hence so is the total scope and detail of knowledge and activity of enlightenment.\" In another part of the sutra, the Buddhas' knowledge of all phenomena is referred to by this metaphor:\n\nThey [Buddhas] know all phenomena come from interdependent origination.\nThey know all world systems exhaustively. They know all the\ndifferent phenomena in all worlds, interrelated in Indra's net.\n\nThe metaphor of Indra's net of jewels plays an essential role in the Chinese Huayan school, where it is used to describe the interpenetration (Wylie: \"zung-'jug\"; Sanskrit: yuganaddha) of microcosmos and macrocosmos. The Huayan text entitled \"Calming and Contemplation in the Five Teachings of Huayan\" (Huayan wujiao zhiguan 華嚴五教止觀, T1867) attributed to the first Huayan patriarch Dushun (557–640) gives an extended overview of this concept:\n\nThe manner in which all dharmas interpenetrate is like an imperial net of\ncelestial jewels extending in all directions infinitely, without limit. … As for the imperial net of heavenly jewels, it is known as Indra’s Net, a net which is made entirely of jewels. Because of the clarity of the jewels, they are all reflected in and enter into each other, ad infinitum. Within each jewel, simultaneously, is reflected the whole net. Ultimately, nothing comes or goes. If we now turn to the southwest, we can pick one particular jewel and\nexamine it closely. This individual jewel can immediately reflect the image\nof every other jewel. \nAs is the case with this jewel, this is furthermore the case with all the rest of the jewels–each and every jewel simultaneously and immediately reflects each and every other jewel, ad infinitum. The image of each of these limitless jewels is within one jewel, appearing brilliantly. None of the other jewels interfere with this. When one sits within one jewel, one is simultaneously sitting in all the infinite jewels in all ten directions. How is this so? Because within each jewel are present all jewels. If all jewels are present within each jewel, it is also the case that if you sit in one jewel you sit in all jewels at the same time. The inverse is also understood in the same way. Just as one goes into one jewel and thus enters every other jewel while never leaving this one jewel, so too one enters any jewel while never leaving this particular jewel. \n\nThe Huayan Patriarch Fazang (643–712) used the golden statue of a lion to demonstrate the Huayan vision of interpenetration to empress Wu:\n\nAccording to Rajiv Malhotra, the earliest reference to a net belonging to Indra is in the Atharva Veda (c. 1000 BCE). Verse 8.8.6. says: \nAnd verse 8.8.8. says:\nThe net was one of the weapons of the sky-god Indra, used to snare and entangle enemies. The net also signifies magic or illusion. According to Teun Goudriaan, Indra is conceived in the Rg Veda as a great magician, tricking his enemies with their own weapons, thereby continuing human life and prosperity on earth. Indra became associated with earthly magic, as reflected in the term \"indrajalam\", \"Indra's Net\", the name given to the occult practices magicians. According to Goudriaan, the term \"indrajalam\" seems to originate in verse 8.8.8 from the Atharva Veda, of which Goudriaan gives a different translation:\nAccording to Goudriaan, the speaker pretends to use a weapon of cosmical size. The net being referred to here \nIn \"Gödel, Escher, Bach\" (1979), Douglas Hofstadter uses Indra's net as a metaphor for the complex interconnected networks formed by relationships between objects in a system—including social networks, the interactions of particles, and the \"symbols\" that stand for ideas in a brain or intelligent computer.\n\nIn \"Vermeer's Hat\" (2007), a history book written by Timothy Brook, the author uses the metaphor:\n\nWriting in \"The Spectator\", Sarah Burton explains that Brook uses the metaphor, and its interconnectedness, \nIn \"Indra's Net\" (2014), Rajiv Malhotra uses the image of Indra's net as a metaphor for\n\n"}

His father was a grammar-school principal, then a protestant court pastor and ecclesiastical inspector for , the last count of the Gaugrehweiler line. In 1773, in a murder attempt on his father, his ten-year-old sister was shot to death as the family sat to dinner; his father was badly injured; his beloved sister's death, and his father's survival – which he considered miraculous – had a lifelong effect on him. The attacker was later found to be a subordinate of his father, one Pastor Valentin, who later took his own life. It was later suggested during the investigation that his father's authoritarian nature might have been a contributory factor to the crime. Because of this incident, the family moved to Ribeauvillé, in the Alsace region, where his father again became a pastor. In 1777, the family moved to Strasbourg where his father became deacon at St.Thomas' Church and later a pastor at Saint Aurelia’s Church. His uncle, Johann Samuel Herrenschneider, was a professor of mathematics at the University of Strasbourg.\nHerrenschneider enrolled at the University of Strasbourg and studied mathematics and astronomy under . On 26 September, 1782, he gained his PhD with the dissertation \"On Consciousness.\" On the death of his uncle in 1784, he took over his mathematics lectures at the university in October that year. He studied law at his father's behest and became licensed to practise in 1785. His passion was for the sciences and mathematics, however. In 1789, he was called to chair of astronomy, taking his recently-deceased former professor Brackenhofer's role.\n\nHis professorship commenced with a tour of European observatories: he met William Herschel, Nevil Maskelyne, Jean-Dominique Cassini, Jérôme Lalande, Jean Sylvain Bailly and Pierre-Simon Laplace. On his return to Strasbourg in 1791, the university was closed as a result of the French Revolution. He taught physics, chemistry and mathematics in various local schools. During the Reign of Terror he was arrested along with his father, and and others – for refusing to renounce their faith – until the 9th Thermidor and the execution of Maximilien Robespierre. From 1795 to 1798 he was an examiner for \"l'École centrale des travaux publics\", subsequently \"L'École polytechnique\", a newly-founded centralised organisation, and he was also on the commission for new weights and measures. During 1796 and 1797 he was a member of the Jury of Instruction for the reorganisation of the Central School of the \"département\" of Bas-Rhin; he became professor of experimental physics and chemistry at the same school in 1800 until its closure three years later.\nIn 1803, he was one of the founding educators at the , along with Haffner and Blessig (all former professors of the University of Strasbourg who were still alive became professors at the new Seminary). There, Herrenschneider was initially a professor of philosophy. In 1807, he became a curator of the public library of the town and the seminary. From 1809, he was professor of experimental mathematical physics in the Faculty of Science at the Royal Academy of Strasbourg, a post he held until 1829. In 1808, his teaching of mathematics at the Seminary was challenged by a fellow professor, Christian Kramp, who was teaching science there and regarded Herrenschneider's Academy role as competition and threatened to denounce him to the Seminary director. Herrenschneider decided to restrict himself to the teaching of logic and metaphysics at the Seminary, which he openly admitted were not his strengths: \"I believe I have understood Plato and Aristotle, Bacon and Descartes, Locke and Leibnitz, Kant and Jacobi, Fichte and as far as Schelling, but I do not understand anything about Hegel.\" By 1812, he was vice-director of the Seminary. \n\nDuring his career, he collected 40 years of meteorological data, which was published and compared with similar data from Paris, including air pressure, humidity and temperature, magnetic-north direction, wind direction, rainfall, intensity of thunderstorms and the temperature a few metres below ground.\n\nIn 1823, he founded a society to help young people freed from prison. He was a much-loved teacher and was celebrated by his students, colleagues and the city burghers for his charitable and philanthropic works. A poem was written for his golden jubilee by . A painting by Strintz was commissioned in his honour in 1823. He was made a knight of the Legion of Honour on 29th April 1838. \n\nFrom 1839, his health began to fail. In 1843, he died and was buried in a tomb at St.Thomas' Church in Strasbourg. A bust of Herrenschneider stands before it.\n"}

{"id": "517028", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=517028", "title": "Michel Aflaq", "text": "Michel Aflaq\n\nMichel Aflaq (‎, , 9 January 1910 – 23 June 1989) was a Syrian philosopher, sociologist and Arab nationalist. His ideas played a significant role in the development of Ba'athism and its political movement; he is considered by several Ba'athists to be the principal founder of Ba'athist thought. He published various books during his lifetime, the most notable being \"The Battle for One Destiny\" (1958) and \"The Struggle Against Distorting the Movement of Arab Revolution\" (1975).\n\nBorn into a middle-class family in Damascus, Syria, Aflaq studied at the Sorbonne, where he met his future political companion Salah al-Din al-Bitar. He returned to Syria in 1932, and began his political career in communist politics. Aflaq became a communist activist, but broke his ties with the communist movement when the Syrian–Lebanese Communist Party supported France's colonial policies. Later in 1940 Aflaq and al-Bitar established the Arab Ihya Movement (later renaming itself the \"Arab Ba'ath Movement\", taking the name from Zaki al-Arsuzi's group by the same name). The movement proved successful, and in 1947 the Arab Ba'ath Movement merged with al-Arsuzi's Arab Ba'ath organisation to establish the Arab Ba'ath Party. Aflaq was elected to the party's executive committee and was elected \"'Amid\" (meaning the party's leader).\n\nThe Arab Ba'ath Party merged with Akram al-Hawrani's Arab Socialist Party to establish the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party in 1952; Aflaq was elected the party's leader in 1954. During the mid-to-late 1950s the party began developing relations with Gamal Abdel Nasser, the President of Egypt, which eventually led to the establishment of the United Arab Republic (UAR). Nasser forced Aflaq to dissolve the party, which he did, but without consulting with party members. Shortly after the UAR's dissolution, Aflaq was reelected as Secretary General of the National Command of the Ba'ath Party. Following the 8th of March Revolution, Aflaq's position within the party was weakened to such an extent that he was forced to resign as the party's leader in 1965. Aflaq was ousted during the 1966 Syrian coup d'état, which led to a schism within the Ba'ath Party. He escaped to Lebanon, but later went to Iraq. In 1968 Aflaq was elected Secretary General of the Iraqi-led Ba'ath Party; during his tenure he held no \"de facto\" power. He held the post until his death on 23 June 1989.\n\nAflaq's theories about society, economics, and politics, which are collectively known as Ba'athism, hold that the Arab world needs to be unified into one Arab Nation in order to achieve an advanced state of development. He was critical of both capitalism and communism, and critical of Karl Marx's view of dialectical materialism as the only truth. Ba'athist thought placed much emphasis on liberty and Arab socialism – a socialism with Arab characteristics, which was not part of the international socialist movement as defined by the West. Aflaq believed in the separation of state and religion, and was a strong believer in secularisation, but was against atheism. Although a Christian, he believed Islam to be proof of \"Arab genius\". In the aftermath of the 1966 Ba'ath Party split, the Syrian-led Ba'ath Party accused Aflaq of stealing al-Arsuzi's ideas, and called him a \"thief\". The Iraqi-led Ba'ath Party rejects this, and does not believe that al-Arsuzi contributed to Ba'athist thought. Additionally, Saddam Hussein claimed without evidence that prior to his death, Aflaq had secretly converted to Islam.\nBorn on 9 January 1910 in Damascus to a middle class Greek Orthodox Christian family, his father, Joseph, working as a grain merchant. Aflaq was first educated in the westernized schools of the French Mandate of Syria. In 1929, he left Syria to study philosophy abroad at the Sorbonne in Paris. During his stay Aflaq was influenced by the works of Henri Bergson, and met his longtime collaborator Salah al-Din al-Bitar, a fellow Syrian nationalist. Aflaq founded an Arab Student Union at the Sorbonne, and discovered the writings of Karl Marx. He returned to Syria in 1932, and became active in communist politics, but left the movement when the government of Léon Blum, supported by the French Communist Party (FCP), continued France's old politics towards its colonies. Aflaq, and others, had believed that the FCP followed pro-independence policies towards the French colonies. It had not helped that the Syrian–Lebanese Communist Party (SLCP) supported the FCP's decision. From then on Aflaq saw the communist movement as a tool of the Soviet Union. He was impressed by the organisation and ideology of Antun Saadeh's Syrian Social Nationalist Party.\n\nUpon their return to Syria, Aflaq and al-Bitar became teachers at Tajhiz all'-Ula, \"the most prestigious secondary school in Syria\". Aflaq taught history, while al-Bitar taught math and physics. By 1940, Aflaq and al-Bitar had managed to set up a student circle, which usually met on Fridays. That year, the Arab Ihya Movement, a political party, was established by Aflaq and al-Bitar. They used most of their spare time in 1941 to agitate for the party. It was in 1942 that Aflaq showed his skills as \"a compelling speaker\" who was able to utilize the \"theatrical pause\" to great effect. The party changed its name to \"Arab Ba'ath Movement\" to signify the radical changes which were sweeping the Middle East; Rashid Ali al-Gaylani, the Prime Minister of Iraq, had challenged Britain's domination over Iraq. The replacement of the word \"Revival\" with \"Ba'ath\" (, literally means \"resurrection\"/\"rebirth\") signified that Arab revival had been replaced ideologically by the need for an Arab rebirth. The change of name led to Zaki al-Arsuzi, leader of the Arab Ba'ath Party, to accuse Aflaq and al-Bitar of stealing his party's name from him. Though both men were promoting a party platform based on an Arab nationalist stance, Aflaq and al-Arsuzi became bitter rivals.\n\nOn 24 October 1942, both Aflaq and al-Bitar resigned from their teaching positions, now determined to devote themselves fully to the political struggle. In 1941 the Syrian Committee to Help Iraq was established to support the Iraqi Government led by Rashid Ali al-Gaylani against the British invasion during the Anglo–Iraqi War. Al-Arsuzi, the leader of the other Arab Ba'ath movement, was skeptical of the new committee, and opposed helping the Iraqis on the ground that they would lose anyway. In 1941 the movement began publishing documents under the name the \"Arab Ihya Movement\". Later, in 1945, Aflaq and al-Bitar asked the French Mandate authorities to grant the movement a party license. The Arab Ba'ath movement did not become an official party until 1947, when it merged with al-Arsuzi's Arab Ba'ath Movement to found the Arab Ba'ath Party. The Arab Ba'ath Movement, led by Aflaq and al-Bitar, drew supporters from al-Arsuzi's Ba'ath Movement; during the 1940s, al-Arsuzi started to seclude himself from the public eye, he developed a deep distrust of others and became, according to some of his associates, paranoid. When the two Ba'ath movements merged and established the Arab Ba'ath Party in 1947, the only subject discussed was how much socialism to include; Wahib al-Ghanim and Jalal al-Sayyid from the al-Arsuzi led Ba'ath movement wanted Aflaq and al-Bitar to adopt more radical socialist policies.\n\nThe Arab Ba'ath Party's first congress was held in Damascus in 1947. Aflaq took the pre-eminent position of \"Amid\", sometimes translated as 'doyen' or as 'leader'; and was elected to a four-member executive committee. Under the constitution adopted at the congress, this made him effective leader of the party, with sweeping powers within the organisation; al-Bitar was elected Secretary General of the National Command. Zaki al-Arsuzi, the leader of the Arab Ba'ath, was not given any position, or membership in the party. Aflaq as \"Amid\" was responsible for ideological affairs and became the party's mentor, while al-Bitar controlled the party's day-to-day management. The merger would prove problematic, several members of the al-Arsuzi-led Ba'ath Party were more left-leaning, and would become, later in Aflaq's tenure as leader, highly critical of his leadership.\n\nIn the late 1940s, Aflaq and al-Bitar gave free lessons on Ba'athist thought, and in 1948 they established the newspaper \"al-Ba'ath\" (English: \"rebirth\"/\"resurrection\"). Aflaq tested the Ba'ath Party's strength during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War after early Syrian defeats – he led several demonstrations against the government led by President Shukri al-Quwatli. He personally led demonstrations, and claimed that al-Quwatli, a landowner, was a corrupt and capitalistic politician, who was to blame for the Syrians army's defeat. Aflaq called for al-Quwatli's resignation, and wrote several \"al-Ba'ath\" articles criticising his presidency and his prime minister, Jamil Mardam Bey. Aflaq was later arrested on the orders of al-Quwatli's prime minister Bey. Al-Quwali's government was brought down in a coup d'état led by military officer Husni al-Za'im. Al-Za'im banned all parties, claiming that Syria was not ready to establish a liberal democracy yet. Aflaq, who had been set free, was rearrested during al-Zai'm's presidency and sent to the notorious Mezzeh Prison. Al-Za'im's rule did not last for long, and in August 1949, he was toppled, and Hashim al-Atassi, who was democratically elected, took his place. Al-Atassi established a national unity government, and Aflaq was appointed to the post of Minister of Education, the only government post he would ever hold; he held it from August to December 1949. Al-Attasi's presidency did not last for very long either, and in 1951 Adib Shishakli took power in a military coup.\n\nAflaq at first extended his support to the new government, believing that he and the Ba'ath Party could collaborate with Shishakli because they shared the same Arab nationalist sentiments. His analysis of Shishakli proved to be wrong, and one of Shishakli's first decisions as ruler was to ban all political parties, including the Ba'ath Party. The Ba'ath Party leadership, and several leading members, escaped to Lebanon in the wake of increased government repression. In Lebanon Aflaq and al-Bitar agreed to a merger of the Arab Ba'ath Party and the Arab Socialist Party (ASP), led by Akram al-Hawrani, to establish the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party in 1952. The newly formed party worked as a base of operation against Shishali's rule – Aflaq and the rest cooperated with non-Ba'athist opposition forces too. Shishakli was toppled in February 1954.\n\nFollowing the overthrow of al-Shishakli, Syria held its first democratic elections in five years. The Ba'ath Party, led by Aflaq, al-Bitar and al-Hawrani, had 22 members elected to parliament. This increase in influence can largely be attributed to al-Hawrani – several old ASP strongholds voted for the Ba'ath Party because of al-Hawrani's presence. By this time Aflaq was losing much of his power to al-Hawrani and his supporters, who were in a majority in the party. A proof of this was the decision of the Ba'ath Party to collaborate openly with the Syrian Communist Party (SCP), a move Aflaq opposed. Aflaq was elected the party's Secretary General of the newly established National Command, a title equivalent to 'party leader', by the party's Second National Congress.\n\nWhen, under the United Arab Republic (UAR), Aflaq was forced by Nasser to dissolve the party, he disbanded the party by himself, instead of convening a congress on the matter. The UAR proved to be disastrous for the Ba'ath Party – the party was sidelined to a great extent by Nasser's government. The Ba'ath movement, which was on the verge in 1958 of becoming the dominant Arab nationalist movement, found itself in disarray after three years of Nasserist rule. Only a handful of Ba'athists were given public office in the UAR's government, al-Hawrani became Vice President and al-Bitar became Minister of Culture and Guidance. Several members, mostly young, blamed Aflaq for this situation; it was he who dissolved the party in 1958 without consulting the National Congress. Hafez al-Assad and Salah Jadid amongst others, eventually established the Military Committee to save the Syrian Ba'ath movement from annihilation. The party's Third National Congress in 1959 supported Aflaq's decision to dissolve the party, but a 1960 National Congress, in which Jadid was a delegate representing the then-unknown Military Committee, reversed the decision and called for the Ba'ath Party's reestablishment. The Congress also decided to improve relations with Nasser by democratising the UAR from within. A faction within the party, led by al-Hawrani, called for Syria's secession. When the UAR broke up in 1961, some members applauded the dissolution, among them was al-Bitar.\n\nThe Ba'ath Party captured 20 seats, down from 22, in the 1961 election. In 1962, after four years, Aflaq convened the Fifth Congress in Homs. Al-Hawrani was not invited; cells that had stayed active and defied Aflaq's orders, and Ba'athists who become Nasserists during the period of the UAR, were not invited to the congress. Aflaq was reelected the National Command's Secretary General, and ordered the reestablishment of the Syrian-regional Ba'ath organisation. During the congress, Aflaq and the Military Committee, through Muhammad Umran, made contact for the first time; the committee asked for permission to initiate a coup d'état; Aflaq supported the conspiracy. Following the success of the February 1963 Iraqi coup d'état, led by the Ba'ath Party's Iraqi Regional Branch, the Military Committee hastily convened to hatch a coup against Nazim al-Kudsi's presidency. The 8th of March Revolution, a military coup launched in 1963, proved successful, and a Ba'athist government in Syria was established. The plotters first order was to establish the National Council of the Revolutionary Command (NCRC), consisting entirely of Ba'athists and Nasserists, and controlled by military personnel rather than civilians from the very beginning.\n\nThe relationship between the Ba'athists and the Nasserists were at best, uncomfortable. The Ba'ath Party's rise to power in Iraq and Syria put Nasser, as he put it, \"between the hammer and the anvil\". The establishment of a union between Iraq and Syria would weaken his credentials as a pan-Arab leader. Nasser started launching bitter propaganda attacks against the party; Aflaq was dismissed as an ineffectual theorist who was mocked as a puppet \"Roman emperor\" and accused of being a \"Cypriot Christian\". In several Ba'ath Party meetings Aflaq responded with pure anger, and became an anti-Nasserist. Because of the position he took, Aflaq had a falling out with al-Bitar who still believed there was a chance to reestablish good ties with Nasser.\n\nThe break with Nasser weakened the original leaders of the Ba'ath Party, which in turn gave the Military Committee room to expand. After taking power, the Military Committee looked for theoretical guidance, but instead of going to Aflaq to solve problems (which was usual before), they contacted the party's Marxist faction led by Hammud al-Shufi. At the Syrian Ba'athist Regional Congress, the Military Committee \"proved\" that it was rebelling equally against Aflaq and the traditional leadership, as against their moderate social and economic policies. The Military Committee was bent on removing Aflaq from a position of power, believing that he had become old and frail.\nAt the Sixth National Congress held in October 1963, Aflaq was barely able to hold on to his post as Secretary General – the Marxist factions led by al-Shufi and Ali Salih al-Sadi, in Syria and Iraq respectively, were the majority group. Another problem facing Aflaq was that several of his colleagues were not elected to party office, for instance al-Bitar was not reelected to a seat in the National Command. Instead of the traditional civilian leadership, a new leadership consisting of military officers was gradually growing; Jadid and Amin al-Hafiz from Syria and Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr and Salih Mahdi Ammash from Iraq were elected to the National Command. While the Military Committee was in fact taking control over the Ba'ath Party from the civilian leadership, they were sensitive to such criticism, and stated, in an ideological pamphlet, that civilian-military symbiosis was of major importance, if socialist reconstruction was to be achieved. To the outside world Aflaq seemed to be in charge. As the Tunisian newspaper \"\" put it; \"The philosopher who made two coups [Iraqi and Syrian coups] in a month\".\n\nThe Ba'ath movement was not running as smoothly as the rest of the world believed; the Iraqi Regional Branch was already starting to lose membership. The Iraqi military and the party's militant arm, the National Guard, detested each other. Al-Sadi, the Regional Secretary of the Iraqi Regional Branch, was eventually exiled to Madrid, Spain on 11 November by several military officers and moderate Ba'athists. An anxious Aflaq hastily traveled from Syria and dissolved the Regional Command of the Iraqi Regional Branch, exclaiming that the National Command would rule Iraq in its place until a new Regional Command was elected. This was not greeted warmly by the majority of Iraqi military officers and Ba'athists – the idea that a Christian was to rule over a Muslim country was considered \"insensitive\".\n\nThe situation in Iraq did not improve, Abdul Salam Arif, the President of Iraq and a Nasserist, plotted a coup against the Ba'ath Party on 18 November, which succeeded. The dream of cornering Nasser's pan-Arab project was over; instead, it was Nasser and the Nasserists who were cornering the Ba'ath movement. On hearing the news, Aflaq and several Ba'athists fled Iraq for Syria.\n\nAfter a falling out with the Military Committee, of which he was a member, Muhammad Umran told Aflaq about the Committee's secret plans to oust the civilian leadership, led by Aflaq, and take over the Ba'ath Party. Shortly after, Umran was sent into exile as Ambassador to Spain for supporting the Aflaq faction. Aflaq responded to the threat posed to his leadership by invoking his office as Secretary General, and calling for the National Command to dissolve the Regional Command. He was forced to withdraw his request, when the majority of Ba'ath Party members proved to oppose such a move. A contest for power, between Aflaq and the Military Committee, ensued in the open; but it was a struggle Aflaq was losing. It was plain from the very beginning that the initiative lay with the anti-Aflaq forces. To counter the military threat, Aflaq invoked party rules and regulations against them. To counter this, the Military Committee befriended a staunchly anti-Aflaq civilian faction calling themselves the \"Regionalists\" – this group had not dissolved their party organisations as ordered by Aflaq in the 1950s.\n\nThe Regional Congress of the Syrian Regional Branch, in March 1965, devolved power from the center, the National Command, to the Regional Command. From then on, the Regional Secretary of the Regional Command was considered Syria's \"ex officio\"'s head of state. The Regional Secretary had the power to appoint the Prime Minister, the cabinet, the chief of staff and top military commanders. Aflaq was unsettled by the way things were moving, and in May he convened the Eighth National Congress to get a showdown between his followers and those of the Military Committee. However, this never came to fruition. Several civilian members of the National Command, such as the Lebanese Jibran Majdalani and the Saudi Ali Ghannam, advised caution, believing that if he pressed the Military Committee too hard the military would take over the Syrian Regional Branch, and then the Ba'ath Party—as had happened in Iraq following the ousting of the Iraqi Regional Branch.\nBecause of their concerns, Aflaq kept quiet. But to his astonishment, keeping quiet caused him to lose his post as Secretary General – Aflaq was succeeded as Secretary General of the National Command by Munif al-Razzaz, a Jordanian of Syrian origin. However, the power between the two camps was unexpectedly reshuffled when Amin al-Hafiz defected to Aflaq's camp. In contrast to other military officers al-Hafiz had very little influence within or outside the party. Al-Hafiz's defection led to a resurgence of activity within Aflaq's faction, al-Bitar and Umran were brought back from Spain to form a new government.\n\nAl-Razzaz, Aflaq's successor as Secretary General, came from the pro-Aflaq faction. With the defection of al-Hafez, he ordered that the National Command was the \"de jure\" ruling body of the Ba'ath Party. He appointed al-Bitar Prime Minister, Umran defence minister, Mansur al-Atrash as Chairman of the National Council of the Revolutionary Command and al-Hafiz retained his post as President of Syria. Salah Jadid, the Military Committee's strongman, responded by arresting several Umran supporters. Umran responded by dismissing a handful of pro-Jadid officials. The most important of these dismissals was the removal of Ahmad Suwaydani from the post of head of the country's military intelligence to head of the Officer Administration. On 23 February a coup d'état led by Jadid and Hafez al-Assad overthrew the Syrian Government and the Ba'ath Party leadership. Aflaq was exiled from Syria, and ordered never to return his homeland. Members of the party's other factions fled; Aflaq was captured and detained, along with other pro-Aflaq supporters, in a government guest house. When the new rulers launched a purge in August that year, Aflaq managed to make his escape, with the help of Nasim Al Safarjalani and Malek Bashour, both closely trusted friends and colleagues, and hence was able to flee to Beirut, Lebanon, and later to Brazil.\n\nAflaq's downfall caused a split within the Ba'ath Party; the party was \"de facto\" dissolved and two Ba'ath Parties were established, one Iraqi-led Ba'ath Party and one Syrian-led Ba'ath Party. The Syrian-led party was led by Jadid and his supporters and hailed Zaki al-Arsuzi, the founder of the Arab Ba'ath in 1940, as the father of Ba'athist thought, while the Iraqi-led party led by Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr and Saddam Hussein, still proclaimed Aflaq to be the founder of Ba'athist thought. In February 1966 at the Ninth National Congress, held after the coup which ousted the pro-Aflaq faction, the Iraqi delegation split with the Syrian Ba'athists. The Iraqi's held the \"true\" Ninth National Congress in February 1968 in Beirut, and elected Aflaq as Secretary General of the National Command. Aflaq's election to the Secretary Generalship also proved to be his final break with al-Bitar; before the congress convened al-Bitar announced that he had left the Ba'ath Party and given up on the Ba'athist movement as a whole.\n\nAflaq moved to Baghdad following his reelection to the Secretary Generalship in February 1968. He stayed there until 1970, when Black September happened, he criticised the Ba'ath leadership of doing too little to help the Palestine Liberation Organisation during the conflict. During the conflict, Aflaq lobbied extensively for Yasser Arafat and the PLO. Aflaq wanted Iraqi intervention; al-Bakr, however, refused to get Iraq involved in such a conflict. Because of this, Aflaq returned to Lebanon in self-imposed exile. The government of Hafez al-Assad, the President of Syria, condemned Aflaq to death in absentia in 1971.\n\nAfter four years of self-imposed exile Aflaq returned to Iraq In 1974, a year before the Lebanese Civil War broke out. He refrained from taking part in Iraqi politics. He published several works during this period, the most notable being \"The Struggle Against Distorting the Movement of Arab Revolution\" in 1975. Aflaq regained some of his influence when he befriended Saddam Hussein, President of Iraq from 1979 until 2003. During the Iran–Iraq War the Iranian leadership accused Hussein of being under the control of a Christian, and Aflaq himself was labelled \"a Christian infidel\". Effectively, throughout his tenure as Secretary General in Iraq, Aflaq was given all due honour as the founder of the Ba'ath movement, but on policy-making, he was ignored.\n\nAflaq died on 23 June 1989 in Paris, after undergoing heart surgery there.\n\nSaddam Hussein claimed that Aflaq had converted to Islam prior to his death – according to nameless Western diplomats. This claim was later disputed by nameless members of Aflaq's own family - although Aflaq's son Iyad confirmed that his father thought about conversion already in 1980. Upon his disputed conversion he had taken the first name of Ahmad. According to the German orientalists Martin Robbe and Gerhard Höpp the conversion happened before 1988. Even so, Aflaq was given an Islamic funeral. For the Berkley Center, Aflaq's disputed conversion is considered by anonymous members of his family as a tool used by Saddam Hussein to disassociate Ba'athism from Christianity. The tomb constructed on the orders of Hussein was later used by American soldiers after the 2003 American invasion of Iraq as a military barracks for troops stationed within the Green Zone.\nAccording to Aflaq's family, the tomb was badly damaged during the invasion.\n\nUpon his death in 1989 he was given a state funeral. A large tomb and mausoleum were erected to form a shrine for him. The tomb, widely regarded as a work of great artistic merit, designed by Iraqi architect Chadagee, was located on the western grounds of the Ba'ath Party Pan-Arab Headquarters, at the intersection of Al-Kindi street and the Qādisiyyah Expressway overpass. Although there were rumors and accusations that his tomb was destroyed during the 2003 Iraq War, the burial chamber and building above it were left untouched. Its blue-tiled dome can be seen above the concrete T-walls surrounding the Camp's perimeter.\n\nThe Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party slogan \"Unity, liberty, socialism\" is the key tenet of Aflaq's and Ba'athist thought. Unity meant the unification of the Arab people into one nation, the Arab Nation. The creation of an Arab Nation would have direct implications on Arab development. The establishment of this new state would lead to an Arab Ba'ath (literally meaning \"Renaissance\"). The Arab nations of his time could only progressively \"decline\" if not unified; these nations had various ailments – \"feudalism, sectarianism, regionalism, intellectual reactionism\". The only way to \"cure\" the Arab nations was, according to Aflaq, through a revolutionary movement. Aflaq was influenced by Marxism in that he saw the need for a vanguard party to rule the Arab Nation for an indefinite period of time (the period would be a transition from the old to the new).\n\nThe need for liberty was one of the defining features of Ba'athism, however, liberty not in the sense used by liberal democracies. Aflaq was a strong believer in pluralism of thought, but paradoxically, against pluralism in the form of votes. In theory, the Ba'ath Party would rule, and guide the people, in a transitional period of time without consulting the people because the party knew what was right.\n\nThe last tenet, 'socialism', did not mean socialism as it is defined in the West, but rather a unique form of Arab socialism. Aflaq coined the word Arab socialism for his variant of socialism. Socialism, in its original form in the Arab world had, according to Aflaq, first come into being under the rule of Muhammad. The point of Arab socialism was not to answer questions such as: how much state control was necessary, or economic equality; but instead Arab socialism was a system that freed the Arab people from oppression and enslavement, which in turn created independent individuals.\n\nAflaq opposed Marx's view that dialectical materialism was the only truth, but believed that the \"importance of material economic conditions in life\" was one of the greatest discoveries in modern history. Even so, Aflaq was critical of both capitalism and communism, and did not want either of the two power blocs to collapse during the Cold War – believing that the Cold War was a sort of check and balance on their power.\n\nWhat Aflaq saw in Islam was a revolutionary movement. In contrast to other nationalities, the Arab awakening and expansion was attributed to a religious message. Because of this, Aflaq believed that the Arab's spirituality was directly linked to Islam, therefore, one could never take Islam out of the equation of what is essentially, and essentially is not, Arab. Arab nationalism, just as Islam had been during the lifetime of Muhammad, was a spiritual revolutionary movement, leading the Arabs towards a new renaissance: Arab nationalism was the second revolution to appear in the Arab world. All Arab religious communities should, according to Aflaq, respect and worship the spirituality of Islam, even if they did not worship Islam in a religious sense – Aflaq was a Christian who worshipped Islam. Aflaq did not believe it was necessary to worship Muhammad, but believed that all Arabs should strive to emulate Muhammad. In the words of Aflaq himself, Arabs \"belong to the nation that gave birth to a Muhammad; or rather, because this Arab individual is a member of the community which Muhammad put all his efforts into creating […] Muhammad was all the Arabs; let us today make all the Arabs Muhammad.\" The Muslim of Muhammad's days were, according to Aflaq, synonymous with Arabs – the Arabs were the only ones to preach the message of Islam during Muhammad's lifetime. In contrast to Jesus, who was a religious leader, but not a political leader, Muhammad was both – the first leader of Islam and of the Arab world. Therefore, secularisation could not take the same shape in the Arab world as it did in the West.\n\nAflaq called on all Arabs, both Muslim and non-Muslim alike, to admire the role Islam had played in creating the Arab character. But his view on Islam was purely spiritual, and Aflaq emphasised that Islam \"should not be imposed\" on state and society. Time and again Aflaq emphasised that the Ba'ath party was against atheism, but also equally against fundamentalism. For him, any fundamentalism represented a \"shallow, false faith.\" According to Ba'athist ideology, all religions were equal. Despite his anti-atheist stance, Aflaq was a strong supporter of secular government, and stated that a Ba'athist state would replace religion with a state \"based on a foundation – Arab nationalism, and a moral – freedom.\"\n\nFouad Ajami criticised Aflaq for a lack of real substance, stating, \"Nearly three hundred pages of text yield no insight, on his part, into what went wrong and what needed to be done; there is only the visible infatuation with words\" and \"Aflaq summons the party to renounce power and go back to its 'pure essence'\". There is some truth in this critique. Aflaq spent much time and energy writing optimistically about the future, and the past, of the Arab Nation, and of how the Arab World could be unified. As Kanan Makiya, the author of \"Republic of Fear: The Politics of Modern Iraq\", notes: for \"Aflaq, reality is confined to the inner world of the party.\" In contrast to other philosophers, such as Karl Marx or John Locke, Aflaq's ideological view of the world makes no clear stand on the materialistic or socioeconomic behavior of humanity. While other philosophers make distinctions between what is real and what is not real, that is between prescriptive and descriptive analysis, Aflaq did not as a rule define what \"is\" and what \"ought\" to be. In his thought both are molded into the same category: that which is \"attainable\".\n\nIn contrast to his longtime friend and colleague Salah al-Din al-Bitar, who was more practical when it came to politics, Aflaq was a \"visionary, the dreamer rather unfitted for political life\". Aflaq was described by his associates as an \"ascetic, shy and intense figure living a simple and unpretentious life.\" He has been accused of seeking help from other people instead of fulfilling his goal by himself or with others he led; Aflaq collaborated with Gamal Abdel Nasser, Abd al-Karim Qasim and Abdul Rahman Arif in 1958, to Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr and Ali Salih al-Sadi in 1963 and finally in the 1970s to Saddam Hussein. There are several Ba'athists, mostly from the Syrian-led Ba'ath Party, who believe Aflaq stole Ba'athist ideology from its original founder, Zaki al-Arsuzi. These individuals have denounced, and labelled, Aflaq as a \"thief\".\n\nIn his writings Aflaq had been stridently in favor of free speech and other human rights and aid for the lower classes. During the Military Committee's gradual take over of power in Syria, Aflaq rallied against what he saw as the establishment of a military dictatorship, instead of the democracy for which Aflaq had planned. These ideals were never realized by the governments that used his ideology. Most scholars see the Assad government in Syria and Saddam Hussein's government in Iraq to have only employed Aflaq's ideology as a pretense for dictatorship.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "47880066", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47880066", "title": "Negative utilitarianism", "text": "Negative utilitarianism\n\nNegative utilitarianism is a version of the ethical theory utilitarianism that gives greater priority to reducing suffering (negative utility or 'disutility') than to increasing happiness (positive utility). This differs from classical utilitarianism, which does not claim that reducing suffering is intrinsically more important than increasing happiness. Both versions of utilitarianism hold that morally right and morally wrong actions depend solely on the consequences for overall well-being. 'Well-being' refers to the state of the individual. The term 'negative utilitarianism' is used by some authors to denote the theory that reducing negative well-being is the \"only\" thing that ultimately matters morally. Others distinguish between 'strong' and 'weak' versions of negative utilitarianism, where strong versions are \"only\" concerned with reducing negative well-being, and weak versions say that \"both\" positive and negative well-being matter but that negative well-being matters more.\n\nOther versions of negative utilitarianism differ in how much weight they give to negative well-being ('disutility') compared to positive well-being (positive utility), as well as the different conceptions of what well-being (utility) is. For example, negative preference utilitarianism says that the well-being in an outcome depends on frustrated preferences. Negative hedonistic utilitarianism thinks of well-being in terms of pleasant and unpleasant experiences. There are many other variations on how negative utilitarianism can be specified.\n\nThe term \"negative utilitarianism\" was introduced by R. Ninian Smart in 1958 in his reply to Karl Popper's \"The Open Society and Its Enemies\". Smart also presented the most famous argument against negative utilitarianism: that negative utilitarianism would entail that a ruler who is able to instantly and painlessly destroy the human race would have a duty to do so. Furthermore, every human being would have a moral responsibility to commit suicide, thereby preventing future suffering. Many authors have endorsed versions of this argument, and some have presented counterarguments against it.\n\nThe term ‘negative utilitarianism’ was introduced by R. N. Smart in his 1958 reply to Karl Popper's book \"The Open Society and Its Enemies\", published in 1945. In the book, Popper emphasizes the importance of preventing suffering in public policy. The ideas in negative utilitarianism have similarities with ancient traditions such as Jainism and Buddhism. Ancient Greek philosopher Hegesias of Cyrene has been said to be “one of the earliest exponents of NU [Negative Utilitarianism].” In more recent times, ideas similar to negative utilitarianism can be found in the works of 19th century psychologist Edmund Gurney who wrote:\n\nLike other kinds of utilitarianism, negative utilitarianism can take many forms depending on what specific claims are taken to constitute the theory. For example, negative preference utilitarianism says that the utility of an outcome depends on frustrated and satisfied preferences. Negative hedonistic utilitarianism thinks of utility in terms of hedonic mental states such as suffering and unpleasantness. Versions of (negative) utilitarianism can also differ based on whether the \"actual\" or \"expected\" consequences matter, and whether the aim is stated in terms of the \"average\" outcome among individuals or the \"total\" net utility (or lack of disutility) among them. Negative utilitarianism can aim either to \"optimize\" the value of the outcome or it can be a \"satisficing\" negative utilitarianism, according to which an action ought to be taken if and only if the outcome would be \"sufficiently\" valuable (or have sufficiently low disvalue). A key way in which negative utilitarianisms can differ from one another is with respect to how much weight they give to negative well-being (disutility) compared to positive well-being (positive utility). This is a key area of variation because the key difference between negative utilitarianism and non-negative kinds of utilitarianism is that negative utilitarianism gives more weight to negative well-being.\n\nPhilosophers Gustaf Arrhenius and Krister Bykvist develop a taxonomy of negative utilitarian views based on how the views weigh disutility against positive utility. In total, they distinguish among 16 kinds of negative utilitarianism. They first distinguish between \"strong negativism\" and \"weak negativism\". Strong negativism \"give all weight to disutility\" and weak negativism \"give some weight to positive utility, but more weight to disutility.\" The most commonly discussed subtypes are probably two versions of weak negative utilitarianism called 'lexical' and 'lexical threshold' negative utilitarianism. According to 'lexical' negative utilitarianism, positive utility gets weight only when outcomes are equal with respect to disutility. That is, positive utility functions as a tiebreaker in that it determines which outcome is better (or less bad) when the outcomes considered have equal disutility. 'Lexical threshold' negative utilitarianism says that there is some disutility, for instance some extreme suffering, such that no positive utility can counterbalance it. 'Consent-based' negative utilitarianism is a specification of lexical threshold negative utilitarianism, which specifies where the threshold should be located. It says that if an individual is suffering and would at that moment not \"agree to continue the suffering in order to obtain something else in the future\" then the suffering cannot be outweighed by any happiness.\n\nThomas Metzinger proposes the 'principle of negative utilitarianism,' which is the broad idea that suffering should be minimized when possible. Mario Bunge writes about negative utilitarianism in his \"Treatise on Basic Philosophy\" but in a different sense than most others. In Bunge's sense, negative utilitarianism is about not harming. In contrast, most other discussion of negative utilitarianism takes it to imply a duty both not to harm and to help (at least in the sense of reducing negative well-being).\n\nIn the 1958 article where R. N. Smart introduced the term ‘negative utilitarianism’ he argued against it, stating that negative utilitarianism would entail that a ruler who is able to instantly and painlessly destroy the human race, \"a benevolent world-exploder,\" would have a duty to do so. This is the most famous argument against negative utilitarianism, and it is directed against sufficiently strong versions of negative utilitarianism. Many authors have endorsed this argument, and some have presented counterarguments against it. Below are replies to this argument that have been presented and discussed.\n\nOne possible reply to this argument is that only a naive interpretation of negative utilitarianism would endorse world destruction. The conclusion can be mitigated by pointing out the importance of cooperation between different value systems. There are good consequentialist reasons why one should be cooperative towards other value systems and it is particularly important to avoid doing something harmful to other value systems. The destruction of the world would strongly violate many other value systems and endorsing it would therefore be uncooperative. Since there are many ways to reduce suffering which do not infringe on other value systems, it makes sense for negative utilitarians to focus on these options. In an extended interpretation of negative utilitarianism, cooperation with other value systems is considered and the conclusion is that it is better to reduce suffering without violating other value systems.\n\nAnother reply to the benevolent world-exploder argument is that it does not distinguish between eliminating and reducing negative well-being, and that negative utilitarianism should plausibly be formulated in terms of reducing and not eliminating. A counterargument to that reply is that elimination is a form of reduction, similar to how zero is a number.\n\nSeveral philosophers have argued that to try to destroy the world (or to kill many people) would be counterproductive from a negative utilitarian perspective. One such argument is provided by David Pearce, who says that \"planning and implementing the extinction of all sentient life couldn't be undertaken painlessly. Even contemplating such an enterprise would provoke distress. Thus a negative utilitarian is not compelled to argue for the apocalyptic solution.\" Instead, Pearce advocates the use of biotechnology to phase out the biology of suffering throughout the living world, and he says that \"life-long happiness can be genetically pre-programmed.\" A similar reply to the similar claim that negative utilitarianism would imply that we should kill off the miserable and needy is that we rarely face policy choices and that \"anyway there are excellent utilitarian reasons for avoiding such a policy, since people would find out about it and become even more miserable and fearful.\" The Negative Utilitarianism FAQ's answer to question \"3.2 Should NUs try to increase extinction risk?\" begins with \"No, that would very bad even by NU standards.\"\n\nSome replies to the benevolent world exploder-argument take the form that even if the world were destroyed, that would or might be bad from a negative utilitarian perspective. One such reply provided by John W. N. Watkins is that even if life were destroyed, life could evolve again, perhaps in a worse way. So the world-exploder would need to destroy the possibility of life, but that is in principle beyond human power. To this, J. J. C. Smart replies,\n\nAnother related reply to the world-exploder argument is that getting killed would be a great evil. Erich Kadlec defends negative utilitarianism and replies to the benevolent world-exploder argument (in part) as follows: \"He [R. N. Smart] also dispenses with the generally known fact that all people (with a few exceptions in extreme situations) like to live and would consider being killed not a benefit but as the greatest evil done to them.\"\n\nNegative preference utilitarianism has a preferentialist conception of well-being. That is, it is bad for an individual to get his aversions fulfilled (or preferences frustrated), and depending on version of negative utilitarianism, it may also be good for him to get his preferences satisfied. A negative utilitarian with such a conception of well-being, or whose conception of well-being includes such a preferentialist component, could reply to the benevolent world-exploder argument by saying that the explosion would be bad because it would fulfill many individuals' aversions. Arrhenius and Bykvist provide two criticisms of this reply. First, it could be claimed that frustrated preferences require that someone exists who has the frustrated preference. But if everyone is dead there are no preferences and hence no badness. Second, even if a world-explosion would involve frustrated preferences that would be bad from a negative preference utilitarian perspective, such a negative utilitarian should still favor it as the lesser of two evils compared to all the frustrated preferences that would likely exist if the world continued to exist.\n\nThe Negative Utilitarianism FAQ suggests two replies to Arrhenius and Bykvist's first type of criticism (the criticism that if no one exists anymore then there are no frustrated preferences anymore): The first reply is that past preferences count, even if the individual who held them no longer exists. The second is that \"instead of counting past preferences, one could look at the matter in terms of life-goals. The earlier the death of a person who wants to go on living, the more unfulfilled her life-goal.\" The Negative Utilitarianism FAQ also replies to Arrhenius and Bykvist's second type of criticism. The reply is (in part) that the criticism relies on the empirical premise that there would be more frustrated preferences in the future if the world continued to exist than if the world was destroyed. But that negative preference utilitarianism would say that extinction would be better (in theory), assuming that premise, should not count substantially against the theory, because for any view on population ethics that assigns disvalue to something, one can imagine future scenarios such that extinction would be better according to the given view.\n\nA part of Clark Wolf's response to the benevolent world-exploder objection is that negative utilitarianism can be combined with a theory of rights. He says,\n\nNegative utilitarianism can be combined, in particular, with Rawls' theory of justice. Rawls knew Popper’s normative claims and may have been influenced by his concern for the worst-off.\n\nToby Ord provides a critique of negative utilitarianism in his essay \"Why I'm Not a Negative Utilitarian,\" to which David Pearce and Bruno Contestabile have replied. Other critical views of negative utilitarianism are provided by Thaddeus Metz, Christopher Belshaw, and Ingmar Persson. On the other hand, Joseph Mendola develops a modification of utilitarianism, and he says that his principle\n\n\n"}

{"id": "21922", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21922", "title": "Neoteny", "text": "Neoteny\n\nNeoteny (, or ), (also called juvenilization) is the delaying or slowing of the physiological (or somatic) development of an organism, typically an animal. Neoteny is found in modern humans. In progenesis (also called paedogenesis), sexual development is accelerated.\nBoth neoteny and progenesis result in paedomorphism (or paedomorphosis), a type of heterochrony. Some authors define paedomorphism as the retention of larval traits, as seen in salamanders.\n\nBoth neoteny and progenesis cause the retention in adults of traits previously seen only in the young. Such retention is important in evolutionary biology, domestication and evolutionary developmental biology.\n\nThe origins of the concept of neoteny have been traced to the Bible (as argued by Ashley Montagu) and to the poet William Wordsworth's \"The Child is the father of the Man\" (as argued by Barry Bogin). The term itself was invented in 1885 by Julius Kollmann as he described the axolotl's maturation while remaining in a tadpole-like aquatic stage complete with gills, unlike other adult amphibians like frogs and toads.\n\nThe word \"neoteny\" is borrowed from the German \"Neotenie\", the latter constructed by Kollmann from the Greek νέος (\"neos\", \"young\") and τείνειν (\"teínein\", \"to stretch, to extend\"). The adjective is either \"neotenic\" or \"neotenous\". For the opposite of \"neotenic\", different authorities use either \"gerontomorphic\" or \"peramorphic\". Bogin points out that Kollmann had intended the meaning to be \"retaining youth\", but had evidently confused the Greek \"teínein\" with the Latin \"tenere\", which had the meaning he wanted, \"to retain\", so that the new word would mean \"the retaining of youth (into adulthood)\".\n\nIn 1926, Louis Bolk described neoteny as the major process in humanization. In his 1977 book \"Ontogeny and Phylogeny\", Steven Jay Gould noted that Bolk's account constituted an attempted justification for \"scientific\" racism and sexism, but acknowledged that Bolk had been right in the core idea that humans differ from other primates in becoming sexually mature in an infantile stage of body development.\n\nNeoteny in humans is the slowing or delaying of body development, compared to non-human primates, resulting in features such as a large head, a flat face, and relatively short arms and legs. These neotenic changes may have been brought about by sexual selection in human evolution. In turn, they may have permitted the development of human capacities such as emotional communication. However, humans also have relatively large noses and long legs, both peramorphic (not neotenic) traits. Some evolutionary theorists have proposed that neoteny was a key feature in human evolution. Gould argued that the \"evolutionary story\" of humans is one where we have been \"retaining to adulthood the originally juvenile features of our ancestors\". J. B. S. Haldane mirrors Gould's hypothesis by stating a \"major evolutionary trend in human beings\" is \"greater prolongation of childhood and retardation of maturity.\" Delbert D. Thiessen said that \"neoteny becomes more apparent as early primates evolved into later forms\" and that primates have been \"evolving toward flat face.\" However, in light of some groups using arguments based around neoteny to support racism, Gould also argued \"that the whole enterprise of ranking groups by degree of neoteny is fundamentally unjustified\" (Gould, 1996, pg. 150). Doug Jones argued that human evolution's trend toward neoteny may have been caused by sexual selection in human evolution for neotenous facial traits in women by men with the resulting neoteny in male faces being a \"by-product\" of sexual selection for neotenous female faces.\n\nNeoteny is seen in domesticated animals such as dogs and mice. This is because there are more resources available, less competition for those resources, and with the lowered competition the animals expend less energy obtaining those resources. This allows them to mature and reproduce more quickly than their wild counterparts. The environment that domesticated animals are raised in determines whether or not neoteny is present in those animals. Evolutionary neoteny can arise in a species when those conditions occur, and a species becomes sexually mature ahead of its \"normal development\". Another explanation for the neoteny in domesticated animals can be the selection for certain behavioral characteristics. Behavior is linked to genetics which therefore means that when a behavioral trait is selected for, a physical trait may also be selected for due to mechanisms like linkage disequilibrium. Often, juvenile behaviors are selected for in order to domesticate more easily a species; aggressiveness in certain species comes with adulthood when there is a need to compete for resources. If there is no need for competition, then there is no need for aggression. Selecting for juvenile behavioral characteristics can lead to neoteny in physical characteristics because, for example, with the reduced need for behaviors like aggression there is no need for developed traits that would help in that area. Traits that may become neotenized due to decreased aggression may be a shorter muzzle and smaller general size among the domesticated individuals. Some common neotenous physical traits in domesticated animals (mainly dogs, pigs, ferrets, cats, and even foxes) include: floppy ears, changes in reproductive cycle, curly tails, piebald coloration, fewer or shortened vertebra, large eyes, rounded forehead, large ears, and shortened muzzle.\n\nWhen the role of dogs expanded from just being working dogs to also being companions, humans started selective breeding dogs for morphological neoteny, and this selective breeding for \"neoteny or paedomorphism\" had the effect of enhancing the bond between humans and dogs. Humans bred dogs to have more \"juvenile physical traits\" as adults such as short snouts and wide-set eyes which are associated with puppies, because people usually consider these traits to be more attractive. Some breeds of dogs with short snouts and broad heads such as the Komondor, Saint Bernard and Maremma Sheepdog are more morphologically neotenous than other breeds of dogs.Cavalier King Charles spaniels are an example of selection for neoteny, because they exhibit large eyes, pendant-shaped ears and compact feet, giving them a morphology similar to puppies as adults.\n\nIn 2004, a study that used 310 wolf skulls and over 700 dog skulls representing 100 breeds concluded that the evolution of dog skulls can generally not be described by heterochronic processes such as neoteny although some pedomorphic dog breeds have skulls that resemble the skulls of juvenile wolves. By 2011, the finding by the same researcher was simply \"Dogs are not paedomorphic wolves.\"\n\nNeoteny has been observed in many other species. It is important to note the difference between partial and full neoteny when looking at other species in order to distinguish between juvenile traits that are only advantageous in the short term and traits that provide a benefit throughout the organism’s life; this might then provide some insight into the cause of neoteny in those species. Partial neoteny is the retention of the larval form beyond the usual age of maturation with the possibility of the development of sexual organs progenesis, but eventually the organism still matures into the adult form; this can be seen in \"Lithobates clamitans\". Full neoteny is seen in \"Ambystoma mexicanum\" and some populations of \"Ambystoma tigrinum\", which remain in their larval form for the duration of their life. \"Lithobates clamitans\" is partially neotenous: it delays its maturation through the winter season, because it is not advantageous for it to metamorphose into the adult form until there are more resources available: it can find those resources much more easily in the larval form. This would fall under both of the main causes of neoteny; the energy required to survive in the winter as a newly formed adult is too costly, so the organism exhibits neotenous characteristics until a time when it is capable of better survival as an adult. \"Ambystoma tigrinum\" retains its neotenous features for a similar reason, however the retention is permanent due to the lack of resources available throughout its lifetime. This is another example of an environmental cause of neoteny in that the species retains juvenile characteristics because the environment limits the ability of the organism to fully come into its adult form. A few species of birds show partial neoteny. A couple of examples of such species are the manakin birds \"Chiroxiphia linearis\" and \"Chiroxiphia caudata\". The males of both species retain their juvenile plumage into adulthood, but they eventually lose it once they are fully mature. In certain species of birds the retention of juvenile plumage is often linked to the molting times within each species. In order to ensure there is no overlap between the molting and mating times, the birds may show partial neoteny in regards to their plumage so that the males do not attain their bright adult plumage before the females are prepared to mate. In this instance, neoteny is present because there is no need for the males to molt early and it would be a waste of energy for them to try to mate while the females are still immature.\n\nNeoteny is commonly seen in flightless insects like the females in the order Strepsiptera. The flightless trait in insects has evolved many separate times; environments that may have contributed to the separate evolution of this trait are: high altitudes, isolation on islands, and insects that reside in colder climates. These environmental factors may be responsible for the flightless trait, because in these situations it would be disadvantageous to have a population that is more dispersed, so flightlessness would be favored due to the boundaries it poses to dispersal. Also, in cooler temperatures heat is lost more rapidly through wings, thus the circumstance favors flightlessness. Another couple of main points to note about insects are that the females in certain groups become sexually mature without metamorphosing into adulthood, and some insects which grow up in certain conditions do not ever develop wings. Flightlessness in some female insects has been linked to higher fecundity, this would increase the fitness of the individual because the female is producing more offspring and therefore passing on more of her genes. In those instances, neoteny occurs because it is more advantageous for the females to remain flightless in order to conserve energy which thereby increases their fecundity. Aphids are a great example of insects that may never develop wings due to their environmental setting. If resources are abundant there is no need to grow wings and disperse. When the nutrition of a host plant is abundant, aphids may not grow wings, remaining on the host plant for the duration of their lives; however, if the resources become diminished, their offspring may develop wings in order to disperse to other host plants.\n\nTwo common environments that tend to favor neoteny are high-altitude and cool environments because neotenous individuals have a higher fitness than those that metamorphose into the adult form. This is because the energy required for metamorphosis is too costly for the individual’s fitness, also the conditions favor neoteny due to the ability of neotenous individuals to utilize the available resources more easily. This trend can be seen in the comparison of salamander species of lower and higher altitudes. The neotenous individuals have higher survivorship as well as higher fecundity than the salamanders that had gone to the adult form in the higher altitude and cooler environment. Insects in cooler environments tend to show neoteny in flight because wings have a high surface area and lose heat quickly, thus it is not advantageous for insects in that environment to metamorphose into adults.\n\nMany species of salamander, and amphibians in general, are known to have neotenized characteristics because of the environment they live in. Axolotl and olm are species of salamander that retains their juvenile aquatic form throughout adulthood, examples of full neoteny. Gills are a common juvenile characteristic in amphibians that are kept after maturation; an example of this would be a comparison of the tiger salamander and the rough-skinned newt, both of which retain gills into adulthood.\n\nPygmy chimpanzees (bonobos) share many physical characteristics with humans. A prime example is their neotenous skulls. The shape of their skull does not change into adulthood; it only increases in size. This is due to sexual dimorphism and an evolutionary change in timing of development. Juveniles became sexually mature before their bodies had fully developed into adulthood, and due to some selective advantage the neotenic structure of the skull remained in later generations.\n\nIn some species, energy costs result in neoteny, as in the insect families Gerridae, Delphacidae, and Carabidae. Many of the species in these families have smaller, neotenous wings or no wings at all. Similarly, some cricket species shed their wings in adulthood, while in beetles of the genus \"Ozopemon\", the males (thought to be the first example of neoteny in the Coleoptera) are significantly smaller than the females, through inbreeding. In the termite \"Kalotermes flavicollis\",neoteny is seen in females during molting.\n\nIn other species, environmental conditions cause neoteny, as in the northwestern salamander (\"Ambystoma gracile\"), where higher altitude is correlated with greater neotenic tendencies, perhaps to help conserve energy as mentioned above. Similarly, neoteny is found in a few species of the crustacean family Ischnomesidae, which live in deep ocean waters.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2959097", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2959097", "title": "Phan Chu Trinh", "text": "Phan Chu Trinh\n\nPhan Châu Trinh (, 1871 - 1926), courtesy name Tử Cán (梓幹), pen name Tây Hồ (西湖) or Hi Mã (希馬), was an early 20th-century Vietnamese nationalist. He sought to end France's colonial occupation of Vietnam. He opposed both violence and turning to other countries for support, and instead believed in attaining Vietnamese liberation by educating the population and by appealing to French democratic principles.\nPhan Châu Trinh was born in Tây Lộc, Quảng Nam Province in Annam, French Indochina on 9 September 1872. He was the son of a rich land owner and scholar. His father was a fighter in the Scholars' Revolt, but in 1885 he was killed by the other leaders in the revolt who suspected him of being a traitor. This left Trinh an orphan at the age of 13. His older brother educated him in classics. In 1901 he got the highest Mandarin degree. \n\nIn 1905 Trinh resigned from his post in the mandarin bureaucracy. He had become strongly opposed to the monarchy, traditional Chinese Confucian-influenced Vietnamese court and mandarin system. He called for an end to the monarchy and its replacement with a democratic republic. Having earlier met Phan Bội Châu in 1903, in March/April 1906 he went to Hong Kong and then to Kwangtung to meet with him again. He made his way there disguised as a disheveled common laborer. He then went to Japan with Châu as part of the Đông-Du movement. They stayed in Yokohama, where they had set up a two-story Japanese house to teach students, which they called Binh Ngo Hien. In June they went to Tokyo to inspect the Japanese education and political system.\n\nTrinh disagreed with Châu's early ideas of asking for military assistance from Japan, as he didn't trust Japan's militarism. He also had other disagreements with Châu's philosophy. Therefore, they had a friendly argument for a few weeks before he returned to Vietnam. Back in Vietnam he continued to receive letters from Châu arguing about his opposition to the monarchy and his belief that the French could be used. Trinh continued to campaign with slogans like \"Up with Democracy, Out with Monarchy\", and \"Making Use of the French in the Quest for Progress\". This made Châu quite upset and worried that the movement was fragmenting and that fundraising efforts would fail. \n\nIn 1906 he wrote to the French Governor General Paul Beau. He asked the French to live up to their civilising mission. He blamed them for the exploitation of the countryside by Vietnamese collaborators. He called on France to develop modern legal, educational, and economic institutions in Vietnam and industrialise the country, and to remove the remnants of the mandarin system. In 1907 he opened a patriotic modern school for young Vietnamese men and women. The school was called Đông Kinh Nghĩa Thục (aka Tonkin Free School). He was a lecturer at the school, and Châu's writings were also used. The school carefully avoided doing anything illegal. Its ideas attacked the brutality of the French occupation of Vietnam, but also wanted to learn modernisation from the French. The school required scholars to renounce their elitist traditions and learn from the masses. It also offered the peasants a modern education. After peasant tax revolts erupted in 1908, Trinh was arrested, and his school was closed. He was sentenced to death, but it was commuted to life imprisonment after his progressive admirers in France intervened. He was sent to Côn Đảo island. In 1911, after three years, he was pardoned and sentenced to house arrest. He said he would rather return to prison than have partial freedom. So instead he was deported to France, where the French continued to monitor him. \n\nHe went to Paris in 1915 to get the support of progressive French politicians and Vietnamese exiles. There he worked with Hồ Chí Minh, Phan Văn Trường, Nguyễn Thế Truyền, and Nguyễn An Ninh in \"The Group of Vietnamese Patriots\". The group was based at 6 Villa des Gobelins. There they wrote patriotic articles signed with the name \"Nguyễn Ái Quốc\" which Hồ Chí Minh later used, \"on behalf of the Group of Vietnamese Patriots\". He worked as a photograph retoucher to support himself while he was in France. He returned to Saigon in 1925, where he died on 24 March 1926, aged 53. His funeral was attended by 60,000 people and caused big protests across the country demanding the end of French colonial occupation, which would not occur for three more decades. \n\nIn Tokyo, Trinh told Châu: \"The level of their people is so high, and the level of our people is so low! How could we not become slaves? That some students now can enter Japanese schools has been your great achievement. Please stay on in Tokyo to take a quiet rest and devote yourself to writing, and not to making appeals for combat against the French. You should only call for 'popular rights and popular enlightenment.' Once popular rights have been achieved, then we can think about other things.\"\n\nChâu commented: \"Thereafter over more than ten days, he and I debated time and again, and our opinions were diametrically opposed. That is to say, he wished to overthrow the monarchy in order to create a basis for the promotion of popular rights; I, on the contrary, maintained that first the foreign enemy should be driven out, and after our nation's independence was restored we could talk about other things. My plan was to make use of the monarchy, which he opposed absolutely. His plan was to raise up the people to abolish the monarchy, with which I absolutely disagreed. In other words, he and I were pursuing one and the same goal, but our means were considerably different. He wished to start by relying on the French to abolish the monarchy, but I wished to start by driving out the French to restore Vietnam - That was the difference. However, even though his political view was the opposite of mine, he liked me personally a great deal and we roomed together for several weeks. Then all of a sudden he decided to return to our country.\" \n\nMost cities in Vietnam have named major streets after him.\n"}

He was given the honorifics \"Abdal-i-Haq\" and \"Hasn-e-Ukhra\".\n\nQalandar Baba Auliya was born in Khorja, Bulandshahr, which is in the U.P. province of India in 1898.\n\nQalandar Baba Auliya received his primary and religious education in a local school. He went to high school in Bulandshahr. After completing his education in high school, he went to Aligarh Muslim University in Aligarh, now in India.\n\nDuring his stay in Aligarh, Qalandar Baba Auliya became inclined towards learning spirituality. He spent a lot of time at the tomb of the Sufi Maulana Kabuli. It was in those times, when he went to visit his maternal grand father, Tajuddin Muhammad Badruddin. Teacher of the teachers, Knower of Divine Secrets, Baba Tajuddin instructed his grand son to stay with him in Nagpur for Spiritual training. Upon learning his son's intention to learn spiritual knowledge, Qalandar Baba's father came to Nagpur to persuade his son to complete his academic education. Baba Tajuddin replied to his father that if he would receive academic education any more, he would not be useful to him. His father left his son to his own liking.\n\nQalandar Baba Auliya stayed with Tajuddin Baba Auliya, whom he called grandfather (Nana), for nine years. During this time, he received his spiritual training from him in an arduous manner.\n\nWhen Qalandar Baba's mother died, she left behind six children- of whom he was the second oldest, only to his elder sister. Tajuddin Baba advised him to get married. He married the daughter of one of the followers of Tajuddin Baba Auliya in Delhi. In 1947, independence of Pakistan, Qalandar Baba Auliya migrated to Karachi in Pakistan with his father, siblings and his family. He rented an old house near Lee Market. The Commissioner for Rehabilitation, who was also one of the followers of Tajuddin Baba, requested him to lodge an application with him so that he could be allocate a house to him. He did not take any notice of his suggestion and continued to reside in a rented premise.\n\nQalandar Baba seldom washed his hands with soap. He washed his hands with lukewarm water until all traces of grease were removed. He was very meticulous and organised in his day-to-day life. He did not sleep for more than two to three hours. He went through phases of silence and spiritual ecstasy and selflessness.\n\nAfter marriage, Qalander Baba settled in Delhi. He became a freelance journalist for different newspapers and magazines. He also proofread and corrected the works of the contemporary poets. People who were interested in Tassuvuf (spiritual knowledge or Sufism) approached him and held discussions with him on the subject.\n\nAfter migrating to Karachi he opted repairing of domestic electrical appliances till he had the job as the sub editor of the daily newspaper Dawn. He also worked for the monthly Naqqad for some time. He edited many magazines, and also published many stories in serial form.\n\nIn 1956 the then master of the Suhrawardiyya Order, Hazrat Abul Faiz Qalandar Ali Suhrawardi visited Karachi. Qalander Baba Auliya went for an audience with him and requested to be initiated. Hazrat Abul Faiz asked him to come at 3 O' clock in the morning. In the bitter cold of the early morning, he sat on the steps of the Grand Hotel on McLeod Road, Karachi; exactly at 3 O' clock Hazrat Abul Faiz opened the door and asked him to come inside. He instructed Qalandar Baba to sit in front of him and then he blew on Qalandar Baba's forehead 3 times. With the first breath the realm of spirits was revealed. With the second blowing of the breath, angels and the Divine Attributes was revealed and with the third breath the highest realm was revealed to him. Hazrat Abul Faiz Qalandar Ali Soharwardi imparted spiritual training to him in three weeks time.\n\nAfter that Qalandar Baba's spiritual training was taken over by the soul of Sheikh Najmuddin Kubra. When the training was completed He transferred the spiritual knowledge to him and presented him to the Divine Presence of God.\n\nDuring this period Qalander Baba Aulia did not sleep for ten days and nights. He prayed and chanted the holy verses all the time.\n\nTo spread the teachings of Qalandar Baba Auliya, three books have been written by Silsela-e-Azeemia. \n\nAdditionally, Qalandar Baba Auliya left maps and diagrams of the visible and invisible realms. He started the publication of the monthly magazine called \"Roohani Digest\", and formed a trust called The Azeemiyya Trust. The trust acquired land and constructed a mausoleum over his resting place in Shadman Town, North Karachi.\n\nPigeon that came to life:\nI loved pigeons and pigeon keeping was my hobby. Once a dove joined the flock of pigeons and started living with them. The dove was crossed with one of the pigeons. When she laid and the chicks hatched out they were extraordinary pretty. They had black wings. Rest of the body was pure white. They were so attractive that every one would praise them for their beauty.\nOne day, one of these pigeons fell prey to a cat. I chased the cat. By the time I reached the cat on the roof, the cat had killed the pigeon and was busy in devouring on the prey. Tears came to my eyes with grief and anger. In that state of shock I came to His Divine Grace Qalander Baba Auliya and in a very hurt tone told him that the cat killed my pigeon, which I adored the most. He calmly commented, \"It happens so.\"\n\nI feeling grieved even more, said, \"I am at loss to understand that how a cat could dare to prey on my pigeon in your presence,\" I was quite desperate, I went to the kitchen with a heavy heart. His divine Grace, Qalandar Baba Auliya called out my name twice. Grief and anger had made me arrogant and I ignored his calls. When I came out of the kitchen, I saw my pigeon pecking in the compound. I couldn't believe my eyes. I ran upstairs and found feathers and blood spots on the roof. I felt ashamed of myself. Came down and fell on the feet of His Divine Grace and apologised for my indecorous behaviour. Before evening I distributed all the pigeons to my friends and decided to stay away from the hobby.\n\nDeaf and Dumb Girl: \nA born deaf and dumb girl was brought to Qalandear Baba Auliya. Those who have been close to Babaji know it well that he was a very cautious person by nature and avoided any performance of wonder working. God knows in what state he was at that time. He addressed the girl and asked her name. The dumb girl naturally remained mute. He asked her again. Now this time more commandingly \"Tell, what is your name?\" She kept staring in silence. Now he was angry he lifted his hand as if to hit her and said in an enraged tone, \"Tell what is your name?\"\n\nAnd to the surprise of all those who were there, she uttered her name and started speaking normally thereafter. She was sixteen or seventeen at that time.\n\nSpiritual Healing of Tumor:\nOnce a lady visited Qalandar Baba Auliya and told him that there was a tumor preventing her to bear children. She said, \"I am otherwise a contented person but due to my inability to bear children my husband is insisting on for second marriage.\"\n\nAnd, after saying this all she started crying desperately in sobs. In that fit of crying she drew near to Qalandar Baba Auliya and placed her head on his chest. Tears not only soaked the shirt but affected his heart as well. Getting up, he told her to lie down straight. Recited something and blew upon his index finger and made a cross where the tumor was supposed to be. When the doctors tested her they found that tumor was no more there. Allah, the most exalted also blessed her with children after that.\n\nQalandar Baba Auliya died on 27 January 1979 in Karachi. Every year on this date his Urs is celebrated which is attended by thousands of people from all over the country and abroad. During Urs many seminars and workshops are held. There are organised sessions of meditation under the instruction of the present Master of Silsila Azeemiyya; Khwaja Shamsuddin Azeemi.\n\nQalandar Baba Auliya left a widow, two sons and two daughters.\n\nOne week before his death he told his disciples and friends; \"I am a guest here for a maximum of one week\". He appointed Khwaja Shamsuddin Azeemi head of the order of the Azeemia and died, on 27 January 1979. His tomb is in the Shadman Town subdivision of Karachi.\n\n\n"}

A Japanese \"garan\" was originally just a park where monks gathered together with their teacher, but the term later came to mean \"Buddhist temple\". \n\nThe word \"garan\" can be found in a record in Nihon Shoki dated 552, although no monastery of this time survives, so we don't know what they were like. \n\nThe compound word is found in a much more recent literature of Edo period, referring to a complex that had a complete set of buildings forming an ideal Buddhist temple.\n\nA record dated 577 in the Nihon Shoki states that a mission including among others a temple architect and a Buddhist image maker was sent by to Japan, with more Buddhist related artisans sent over in the following years. Excavations carried out between 1979-1980 on the temple site of Jeongnimsa in Buyeo, capital of Baekje from 538 to 663, revealed that the original temple was laid out in a typical north-to-south style with key buildings put on the center axis, which was an arrangement closely adhered to at Shitennō-ji in Ōsaka.\n\nWhat is counted in the group of seven buildings, or \"shichidō\", can vary greatly from temple to temple, from sect to sect, and from time to time. As mentioned above, \"shichidō garan\" could mean a complete temple or even simply a large temple complex.\n\nAccording to a 13th-century text, \"a garan is a temple with a \"kon-dō\" (main hall), a \"tō\" (pagoda), a \"kō-dō\" (lecture hall), a \"shōrō\" (bellfry), a \"jiki-dō\" (refectory), a \"sōbō\" (monks' living quarters), and a \"kyōzō\" (scriptures deposit, library).\" These are the seven listed as \"shichidō\" elements of a temple.\n\nA 15th-century text describes how Zen school temples (Sōtō (), Rinzai ()) included a \"butsuden\" or \"butsu-dō\" (main hall), a \"hattō\" (lecture hall), a \"kuin\" (kitchen/office), a \"sō-dō\" (building dedicated to Zazen), a \"sanmon\" (main gate), a \"tōsu\" (toilet) and a \"yokushitsu\" (bath).\n\nBecause of the relics they contained, wooden pagodas used to be the centerpiece of the \"garan\", the seven edifices considered indispensable for a temple. They gradually lost of importance and were replaced by the \"kondō\" (golden hall), because of the magic powers believed to lie within the images the building housed. This loss of status was so complete that the Zen sects, which arrived late in Japan from China, normally do not build any pagoda at all. The layout of four early temples clearly illustrates this trend: they are in chronological order Asuka-dera, Shitennō-ji, Hōryū-ji, and Yakushi-ji. In the first, the pagoda was at the very center of the \"garan\" surrounded by three small \"kondō\" (see the reconstruction of the temple's original layout). In the second, a single \"kondō\" is at the center of the temple and the pagoda lies in front of it. At Hōryū-ji, they are one next to the other. Yakushi-ji has a single, large \"kondō\" at the center with two pagodas on the sides. The same evolution can be observed in Buddhist temples in China.\n\n is a Buddhist temple of the \"Shōtoku\" sect in Ikaruga, Nara Prefecture, Japan. Its \"garan\" is composed of (see plan on the right):\n\nA \"Chūmon\" (中門) \nIn a temple, the gate after the \"naindaimon\" connected to a \"kairō\" \n\nB \"Kairō\" (回廊・廻廊) \nA long and roofed portico-like passage surrounding the \"kondō\" and the pagoda. \n\nC \"Kon-dō\" (金堂)\nThe main hall of a \"garan\", housing the main object of worship.\n\nD \"Tō\"\nA pagoda, which is an evolution of the stupa (a kind of reliquary) . After reaching China, the stupa evolved into a tower with an odd number of tiers (three, five, seven, nine, thirteen).\n\nE \"Kōdō\" (講堂) \nThe lecture hall of a non-Zen \"garan\". \n\nF \"Kyōzō\" (経蔵) \nLit. \"scriptures deposit\".

It was found at the entrance of Suksusa Temple, in Sunheung-myeon, Yeongju City, Gyeongsangbuk-do South Korea. Sosu Seowon was founded by Ju Sebung (주세붕/ 1495–1554), who was serving as magistrate of Pungseong county.\n\nSosu Seowon was the only seowon that survived from the \"Seowon Abolishment\" by Heungseon Daewongun Regent in 1871. It has been well preserved retaining most of its old structures and is designated as National Treasure of South Korea No.55\n\nIn 1542, during the 37th year of King Jungjong's reign (1506–44) of the Joseon Dynasty, the magistrate of Punggi County and Confucian scholar, Ju Se-bung, built Baekundong Seowon, renamed to Sosu Seowon in 1550, to honor the peaceful times of Goryeo. Also in 1550, during the reign of King Myeongjong of the Joseon Dynasty, Toegye Yi Hwang established Sosu Seowon as the first legislated private institute of Korea.\n\nMany criticized Ju Se-bung's actions of founding Baekundong (Sosu) Seowon during a time of famine. But be defended himself by quoting Zhu Xi (1130–1200), the scholar who systematized Neo-Confucianism in Song dynasty. Like Zhu Xi, Ju Se-bung believed that education was the cardinal virtue of man, and ought to be promoted above all else.\n\nJu Se-bung was a man ahead of his time. Private academies blossomed across Korea in short order, but because Sosu Seowon was the first, it became one of the richest. After Ju Se-bung departed as magistrate, local scholars continued fund raising campaigns, receiving vast donations of grain, land, and slaves to support the academy. Sosu Seowon grew in prestige because it enshrined An Hyang (1243 -1306), a local a Confucian scholar who lived during the end of the Goryeo Dynasty who had brought Neo-Confucianism to Korea from China in the 13th century.\n\nThe academy gained even more prestige when Toegye (Yi Hwang) (1501–70), the preeminent Neo-Confucian philosopher of Korea, became magistrate of the county. He asked King Myeongjong to grant the academy a royal charter. The king responded favorably, sending a plaque with the name \"Sosu Seowon\" in the king's own handwriting, along with a generous supply of books. The annals of the king give interesting clues to the relation of the academy to the state. It specifies that the local magistrate cannot interfere in the affairs of the academy, nor disturb the Confucian scholars. The academy was to be promoted as a place where scholars could gather without interference from the monarchy.\n\nAbout 4,000 scholars, including the pupils of Confucian scholar Toegye Yi Hwang, studied at the institute.\n\nDuring the Joseon era (1392–1910), Korean Buddhism suffered heavy persecution. Many temples were closed and renovated for other uses. Because Sosu Seowon originally had been a Buddhist temple and then became a private academy, Sosu Seowon has an unconventional architectural layout compared with later Confucian academies.\n\nSosu Seowon also has Munseonggong Shrine, which was built to enshrine An Hyang, An Bo, An Chuk and Ju Se-bung, where a memorial service takes place on the first day of the third and ninth months of the lunar calendar every year.\n\nThe basic principle of Chinese architectural locates the study facilities at the front of the structure and the shrine to the rear, as seen in most Korean Confucian academies. But Sosu Seowon is based on the arrangement of having the study facilities placed in the east and the shrine placed in the west, positioning the greater emphasis on the east.\n\nOn the right of the Sosu Seowon entrance is the Okgyesu, a stream of the Nakdong River coming from Mt. Sobaek. Inside Sosu Seowon's auditorium is a 'Sosu Seowon' sign engraved by King Myeongjong. Behind the auditorium there are Jikbangjae, Ilshinjae, Hakgujae and Jirakjae. On the east side are the Seogo, the portrait of Anhyang (National Treasure No.111) painted at the end of Goryeo Dynasty, and the Munseong Tomb where the Daesungjisung King Munseon’s Jeonjwado (National Treasure No.485) is enshrined.\n\nToday, an average of 800,000 tourists visit Sosu Seowon every year. Inside the institute is the Sosu Museum which exhibits a wide range of traditional Confucian cultural assets.\n\n"}
{"id": "2552726", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2552726", "title": "Spinozism", "text": "Spinozism\n\nSpinozism (also spelled Spinozaism) is the monist philosophical system of Benedict de Spinoza that defines \"God\" as a singular self-subsistent Substance, with both matter and thought being attributes of such.\n\nIn a letter to Henry Oldenburg, Spinoza wrote: \"as to the view of certain people that I identify god with nature (taken as a kind of mass or corporeal matter), they are quite mistaken\". For Spinoza, our universe (cosmos) is a \"mode\" under two \"attributes\" of Thought and Extension. God has infinitely many other attributes which are not present in our world. According to German philosopher Karl Jaspers, when Spinoza wrote \"Deus sive Natura\" (\"God or Nature\") Spinoza meant God was \"Natura naturans\" not \"Natura naturata\", that is, \"a dynamic nature in action, growing and changing, not a passive or static thing.\"\n\nIn Spinozism, the concept of a personal relationship with God comes from the position that one is a part of an infinite interdependent \"organism.\" Spinoza argued that everything is a derivative of God, interconnected with all of existence. Although humans experience only thought and extension, what happens to one aspect of existence will affect others. Thus, Spinozism teaches a form of determinism and ecology, and uses these as a basis for morality.\n\nAdditionally, a core doctrine of Spinozism is that the universe is essentially deterministic. All that happens or will happen could not have unfolded in any other way. Spinoza claimed that the third kind of knowledge, intuition, is the highest kind. More specifically, he defined intuition as the ability of the human intellect to intuit knowledge based upon its accumulated understanding of the world.\n\nSpinoza's metaphysics consists of one thing, Substance, and its modifications (modes). Early in \"The Ethics\" Spinoza argues that there is only one Substance, which is absolutely infinite, self-caused, and eternal. Substance causes an infinite number of attributes (the intellect perceiving an abstract concept or essence) and modes (things following from attributes and modes). He calls this Substance \"God\", or \"Nature\". In fact, he takes these two terms to be synonymous (in the Latin the phrase he uses is \"Deus sive Natura\"), but readers often disregard his neutral monism. During his time, this statement was seen as literally equating the existing world with God - for which he was accused of atheism. Spinoza asserted that the whole of the natural universe is made of one Substance – God or Nature – and its modifications (modes).\n\nOne should, however, remember the neutral monist position. While the natural universe humans experience in the realm of mind and physical reality is part of God, it is only two modes – thought and extension – that are part of infinite modes emanating from God.\n\nSpinoza's doctrine was considered radical at the time he published, and he was widely seen as the most infamous atheist-heretic of Europe. His philosophy was part of the philosophic debate in Europe during the Enlightenment, along with Cartesianism. Specifically, Spinoza disagreed with Descartes on substance duality, Descartes' views on the will and the intellect, and the subject of free will.\n\nSpinoza defines \"Substance\" as follows:\n\nThis means, essentially, that Substance is just whatever can be thought of without relating it to any other idea or thing. For example, if one thinks of a particular object, one thinks of it as a kind of thing, \"e.g.\", \"x\" is a cat. Substance, on the other hand, is to be conceived of by itself, without understanding it as a particular kind of thing, because it isn't a particular thing.\n\nSpinoza defines \"attribute\" as follows:\n\nFrom this it can be seen that Attributes are related to Substance. It is not clear, however, even from Spinoza's direct definition, whether, a) Attributes are really the way(s) Substance is, or b) Attributes are simply ways to understand Substance, but not necessarily the ways it really is.\nSpinoza thinks that there are an \"infinite\" number of Attributes, but there are two Attributes for which Spinoza thinks we can have knowledge. Namely, \"thought\" and \"extension\".\n\nThe attribute of thought is how Substance can be understood to be composed of thoughts, \"i.e.\", thinking things. When we understand a particular thing through the Attribute of thought, we are understanding the mode as an \"idea\" of something (either another idea, or an object).\n\nThe Attribute of extension is how Substance can be understood to be physically extended in space. Particular things that occupy space are what is meant by \"extended\". It follows from this that if Substance and God are identical, in Spinoza's view, and contrary to the traditional conception, God has extension as one of his Attributes.\n\nModes are particular modifications of substance, \"i.e.\", particular things in the world. Spinoza gives the following definition:\nThe argument for there only being one Substance (or, more colloquially, one kind of stuff) in the universe occurs in the first fourteen propositions of \"The Ethics.\" The following proposition expresses Spinoza's commitment to substance monism:\n\nSpinoza takes this proposition to follow directly from everything he says prior to it. Spinoza's monism is contrasted with Descartes' dualism and Leibniz's pluralism. Thus, Spinoza avoids the unsolvable problem of how mind and body interact, which troubled Descartes in his \"Meditations on First Philosophy.\" Specifically, how can immaterial mind interface with material body, and vice-versa? They exist in wholly different categories.\n\nThe issue of causality and modality (possibility and necessity) in Spinoza's philosophy is contentious. Spinoza's philosophy is, in one sense, thoroughly deterministic (or necessitarian). This can be seen directly from Axiom 3 of \"The Ethics\":\n\nYet Spinoza seems to make room for a kind of freedom, especially in the fifth and final section of \"The Ethics\", \"On the Power of the Intellect, or on Human Freedom\":\n\nSo Spinoza certainly has a use for the word 'freedom', but he equates \"Freedom of Mind\" with \"blessedness\", a notion which is not traditionally associated with freedom of the will at all.\n\nThough the PSR is most commonly associated with Gottfried Leibniz, it is arguably found in its strongest form in Spinoza's philosophy.\nWithin the context of Spinoza's philosophical system, the PSR can be understood to unify causation and explanation. What this means is that for Spinoza, questions regarding the \"reason\" why a given phenomenon is the way it is (or exists) are always answerable, and are always answerable in terms of the relevant cause(s). This constitutes a rejection of teleological, or final causation, except possibly in a more restricted sense for human beings. Given this, Spinoza's views regarding causality and modality begin to make much more sense.\n\nSpinoza's philosophy contains as a key proposition the notion that mental and physical (thought and extension) phenomena occur in parallel, but without causal interaction between them. He expresses this proposition as follows:\n\nHis proof of this proposition is that:\n\nThe reason Spinoza thinks parallelism follows from this axiom is that, since the idea we have of each thing requires knowledge of its cause, such a cause must be understood under the same attribute. Further, there is only one substance, so whenever we understand some chain of ideas concerning things, we understand that the way the ideas are causally related must be the same as the way the things themselves are related, since the ideas and the things are the same modes, but understood under different attributes.\n\nIn 1785, Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi published a condemnation of Spinoza's pantheism, after Gotthold Ephraim Lessing was thought to have confessed on his deathbed to being a \"Spinozist\", which was the equivalent in his time of being called a heretic. Jacobi claimed that Spinoza's doctrine was pure materialism, because all Nature and God are said to be nothing but extended substance. This, for Jacobi, was the result of Enlightenment rationalism and it would finally end in absolute atheism. Moses Mendelssohn disagreed with Jacobi, saying that there is no actual difference between theism and pantheism. The entire issue became a major intellectual and religious concern for European civilization at the time, which Immanuel Kant rejected, as he thought that attempts to conceive of transcendent reality would lead to antinomies (statements that could be proven both right and wrong) in thought.\n\nThe attraction of Spinoza's philosophy to late eighteenth-century Europeans was that it provided an alternative to materialism, atheism, and deism. Three of Spinoza's ideas strongly appealed to them:\n\nSpinoza's \"God or Nature\" [\"Deus sive Natura\"] provided a living, natural God, in contrast to the Newtonian mechanical \"First Cause\" or the dead mechanism of the French \"Man Machine.\" Coleridge and Shelley saw in Spinoza's philosophy a \"religion of nature\" and called him the \"God-intoxicated Man.\" Spinoza inspired the poet Shelley to write his essay \"The Necessity of Atheism.\"\n\nSpinoza was considered to be an atheist because he used the word \"God\" [Deus] to signify a concept that was different from that of traditional Judeo–Christian monotheism. \"Spinoza expressly denies personality and consciousness to God; he has neither intelligence, feeling, nor will; he does not act according to purpose, but everything follows necessarily from his nature, according to law...\" Thus, Spinoza's cool, indifferent God differs from the concept of an anthropomorphic, fatherly God who cares about humanity.\n\nGerman philosopher Karl Jaspers believed that Spinoza, in his philosophical system, did not mean to say that God and Nature are interchangeable terms, but rather that God's transcendence was attested by his infinitely many attributes, and that two attributes known by humans, namely Thought and Extension, signified God's \"immanence\". Even God under the attributes of thought and extension cannot be identified strictly with our world. That world is of course \"divisible\"; it has parts. But Spinoza insists that \"no attribute of a substance can be truly conceived from which it follows that the substance can be divided\" (Which means that one cannot conceive an attribute in a way that leads to division of substance), and that \"a substance which is absolutely infinite is indivisible\" (\"Ethics\", Part I, Propositions 12 and 13). Following this logic, our world should be considered as a mode under two attributes of thought and extension. Therefore, the pantheist formula \"One and All\" would apply to Spinoza only if the \"One\" preserves its transcendence and the \"All\" were not interpreted as the totality of finite things.\n\nFrench philosopher Martial Guéroult suggested the term \"panentheism\", rather than \"pantheism\" to describe Spinoza's view of the relation between God and the world. The world is not God, but it is, in a strong sense, \"in\" God. Not only do finite things have God as their cause; they cannot be conceived without God. In other words, the world is a subset of God. American philosopher Charles Hartshorne, on the other hand, suggested the term \"Classical Pantheism\" to describe Spinoza's philosophy.\n\nSimilarities between Spinoza's philosophy and Eastern philosophical traditions have been discussed by many authorities. The 19th-century German Sanskritist Theodore Goldstücker was one of the early figures to notice the similarities between Spinoza's religious conceptions and the Vedanta tradition of India, writing that Spinoza's thought was \"... a western system of philosophy which occupies a foremost rank amongst the philosophies of all nations and ages, and which is so exact a representation of the ideas of the Vedanta, that we might have suspected its founder to have borrowed the fundamental principles of his system from the Hindus, did his biography not satisfy us that he was wholly unacquainted with their doctrines... We mean the philosophy of Spinoza, a man whose very life is a picture of that moral purity and intellectual indifference to the transitory charms of this world, which is the constant longing of the true Vedanta philosopher... comparing the fundamental ideas of both we should have no difficulty in proving that, had Spinoza been a Hindu, his system would in all probability mark a last phase of the Vedanta philosophy.\"\n\nIt has been said that Spinozism is similar to the Hindu doctrines of Samkhya and Yoga. Though within the various existing Indian traditions there exist many traditions which astonishingly had such similar doctrines from ages, out of which most similar and well known are the Kashmiri Shaivism and Nath tradition, apart from already existing Samkhya and Yoga.\n\nMax Muller, in his lectures, noted the striking similarities between Vedanta and the system of Spinoza, saying \"the Brahman, as conceived in the Upanishads and defined by Sankara, is clearly the same as Spinoza's 'Substantia'.\" Helena Blavatsky, a founder of the Theosophical Society also compared Spinoza's religious thought to Vedanta, writing in an unfinished essay \"As to Spinoza's Deity – natura naturans – conceived in his attributes simply and alone; and the same Deity – as natura naturata or as conceived in the endless series of modifications or correlations, the direct outflowing results from the properties of these attributes, it is the Vedantic Deity pure and simple.\"\n\n\n"}

Mumford is best known for his work in metaphysics on dispositions and laws, but has also made contributions in the philosophy of sport.\n\nMumford was born in Wakefield, West Yorkshire. Mumford went on to read Philosophy and History of Ideas with Politics at Huddersfield Polytechnic (now University of Huddersfield) as his first degree. After Huddersfield, Mumford went on to the University of Leeds to take an MA in Philosophy of Mind. At Leeds, Mumford met Robin Le Poidevin who was to become his PhD supervisor. Mumford was awarded a PhD in 1994, for his thesis \"Dispositions and Reductionism\", and was awarded a two-year lectureship at Leeds. Mumford left Leeds in 1995 for The University of Nottingham, where he has been Dean of the Faculty of Arts from 2011 to 2015.\n\nPrior to his appointment as Dean of the Faculty of Arts in 2011, Mumford was Head of the Department of Philosophy from 2004–2007 and Head of the School of Humanities from 2009-2011.\n\nMumford is the sole-author of four books: \"Dispositions\" (1998), \"Laws in Nature\" (2004), \"David Armstrong\" (2007), and \"Watching Sport: Aesthetics, Ethics and Emotions\" (2011). Mumford has also edited two books: \"Russell on Metaphysics\" (2003) and George Molnar’s \"Powers: A Study in Metaphysics\" (2003). Most recently, Mumford co-authored, with Rani Lill Anjum, \"Getting Causes from Powers\" (2011).\n\nThe late philosopher George Molnar (1934–1999) published only four philosophical papers on metaphysics in his career, but his importance in the field should not be underestimated. After a return to the field, following a self-imposed absence, he was working on a book (\"\"\") and continued up until his sudden and untimely death in August 1999. The book remained unfinished until Mumford, who had previously been in contact with Molnar, in the summer of 1999, with the intention of giving feedback on the work (nearing completion), was approached to edit the remaining manuscript into a completed book. Mumford, along with several other figures in the field of metaphysics, including David Armstrong, were involved collaboratively in providing insight on Molnar's work, and as a person, but the editing was left to Mumford, as was the writing of an introductory chapter to correctly present and establish the material laid out - something which Molnar did not get round to doing before his death. Armstrong states, \"We can be very grateful to Stephen Mumford for making a volume from the much that we have. His excellent introduction serves in place of the introductory chapter that was left unwritten\". Mumford had discussed Molnar at a conference on Australian metaphysics, held in Grenoble (9–13 December 1999), but the colloquium - organised by Jean-Maurice Monnoyer, entitled \"The Structure of the World: Objects, Properties and States of Affairs\" - was to be the first official meeting of Mumford and Molnar as well. Mumford had considered this to be the end of the matter, but, in the spring of 2000, Mumford was contacted again concerning \"\"\"\". This time, however, it was through mutual friend Tony Skillen (lecturer in philosophy at the University of Kent) on behalf of Molnar's former partner Carlotta McIntosh, who had given access to the manuscript and who shared it with Mumford. Although the book was, in places, complete and filled with promise, there was much work to be done on the later chapters - Mumford reflects on a conversation between himself and Armstrong on the way to the Grenoble colloquium, mentioning Molnar's email stating the work was near finished, Armstrong replied: \"it was near finished, in his mind\". The main theory of powers survives, and with Mumford's help and editorial contribution is readily accessible.\n\nMumford was a project leader for The University of Nottingham in the AHRC (Arts & Humanities Research Council) funded three-year research project: the metaphysics of science. Mumford worked alongside Alexander Bird (Bristol) and Helen Beebee (Birmingham) within this project with their joint focus on \"causes, laws, kinds, and dispositions\". The project was described with the following abstract:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

To remind people of the issues the world is facing, Galschiøt created 27 sculptures of starving African kids out of bronze. The \"kids\" have a sad look on their faces. The bronze is darkened to give them a sad, dark look. At the bottom of the sculpture, there is a shining new shoe, made by one of the major shoe companies that is responsible for the use of poor kids in the third world to work for a small payment. \n\nIn May 2001, in the center of Odense, a bronze sculpture of a 12-year-old starved black boy, with a large pair of shining new Nike shoes, was set up so that it appeared to watch the well-fed Danes rushing by. The sculpture stood on a polished black granite pedestal, with the slogan \"JUST DO IT\" written on it.\n\nGalschiøt stated \"With this sculpture, I'll pinpoint the hypocrisy of companies who in their lifestyle commercials are linking their brands with concepts such as freedom and equality and at the same time are cynically exploiting and \noppressing the workers who make the products.\"\n\nDuring the ASEM 4 summit in Copenhagen in September 2002, 27 \"starving boys\" were placed in Copenhagen to demonstrate for social justice. The 27 sculptures were supposed to represent the starving people in the Third World countries that are influenced by the way that the summit focuses on corporations' profit, instead of poor peoples' interests. The event was arranged in co-operation with Care-Denmark and The Salvation Army. The latter organization supplied the boys with Adidas, Nike and Reebok shoes.\n\nIn the summer of 2002, a crowd of 27 starving African boys cast in copper started a tour throughout Denmark to protest against the government's cutback of development aid. \n\nGalschiøt launched the action in cooperation with the NGO Forum in Aarhus. Hundreds of volunteers took part in the creation of the sculptures in the artist's workshop, and subsequently in the mobilization of the boys all over the country. \n\nIn March 2003, DanChurchAid is using the sculptures in their collection to support children who have been left orphans due to AIDS.\n\n\"The Hunger March\" has often appeared as a participant in different demonstrations in Denmark, such as the climate demonstrations. Usually the sculptures are placed on small wagons, where they appear as being a part of the marching crowd.\n\n"}

In his address to the University of Valladolid, Spain, in October 2001, he said \"According to the cybernetician, the purpose of a system is what it does. This is a basic dictum. It stands for bald fact, which makes a better starting point in seeking understanding than the familiar attributions of good intention, prejudices about expectations, moral judgment, or sheer ignorance of circumstances.\"\n\nThe term is widely used by systems theorists. It is generally invoked to counter the notion that the purpose of a system can be read from the intentions of those who design, operate, or promote it. From a cybernetic perspective complex systems are not controllable by simple notions of management, and interventions in a system can best be understood by looking at how they affect observed system behavior. When \"side effects\" or \"unintended consequences\" reveal that system behavior is poorly understood, then taking the POSIWID perspective allows the more political understandings of system behavior to be balanced by a more straightforwardly descriptive view.\n\nThe term is used in many fields including biology and management.\n\n"}

He became an expert in Huayan (華嚴) doctrine and was the founder of the Korean Hwaeom school. Most well-known among his writings is the \"Beopseongge\" or \"Hwaeom ilseung beopgye do \"(\"Diagram of the Avataṃsaka Single Vehicle Dharmadhātu\") (華嚴一乘法界圖). This is a commentary on his mandala-like diagram \"haein do\" ('Ocean Seal'), which consists of 210 Chinese characters that express the essence of the Huayan doctrine. A full translation can be found in the appendix to Odin, 1982.\n\nLittle is known of his early life other than his father was named Hin-sin and his family name was Kim.\n\nHe is famous for his travel to Táng China with his friend, Wonhyo. At one point they were captured by border guards and held for ten days as suspected spies but were subsequently released and expelled. Late, Wonhyo left Uisang, after unknowingly drinking water from a skull in the dark. The shock of this brought about an enlightenment experience such that he felt it was unnecessary to continue to China in search of wisdom. Dismayed, but nonetheless determined, Uisang continued on his journey eventually reaching China by sea.\n\nA Korean folk story relates how, when he was young, Uisang fell in love with a beautiful girl, Myo Hwa (\"Delicate Flower\") but she was chosen by the king of Silla to be sent as a gift to the Chinese Emperor thus thwarting their relationship. This turned Uisang to the religious life and he became a monk. Myo Hwa in desperation tried to commit suicide on the journey in China by throwing herself in the river. However, she was rescued and nursed back to health by a family who subsequently adopted her. Many years later she met Uisang on his travels to China but he explained that he was now a monk and could not go back with her to Silla as she wished. However, he said he would visit her when his studies in China were complete. This he did ten years later. Unfortunately, Myo Hwa was not at home so Uisang left her a note and hurried to get his ship back to Silla. Myo Hwa returned and realized she had just missed him and ran down to the sea to try and catch him before he left. The ship however had already left the shore and in desperation she leapt in the water. As she hit the water she was magically transformed into a dragon by the strength of her love and she was able to follow the ship back to Silla. \n\nSafely arrived in Silla, Uisang went on to found Buseoksa, a temple in the Gyeongsangbuk-do (North Gyeongsang) mountains. The temple name means \"Floating Rock\" and is derived from an incident in which Myo Hwa, as a dragon, scares away some bandits by magically raising a bolder into the air. She is said to have transformed herself into a rock to continue protecting the site and her lover, Uisang. (Story related by Sunin, 1987).\n\nUisang is often referred to as the \"Temple Builder\" because of the number of temples he established or extended during his lifetime.\n\n\n"}

Teilhard's theories are better known in the West (and have also been commented on by Julian Huxley), and integrate Darwinian evolution and Christianity, whilst Vernadsky wrote more purely from a scientific perspective.\n\nThree classic levels are described. Cosmogenesis (Teilhard) or the formation of inanimate matter (the Physiosphere of Wilber), culminating in the Lithosphere, Atmosphere, Hydrosphere, etc. (Teilhard), or collectively, the Geosphere (Vernadsky). Here progress is ruled by structure and mechanical laws, and matter is primarily of the nature of non-consciousness (Teilhard - the \"Without\").\n\nThis is followed by Biogenesis (Teilhard) and the origin of life or the Biosphere (Vernadsky, Teilhard), where there is a greater degree of complexity and consciousness (Teilhard - the \"Within\"), ecology (Vernadsky) comes into play, and progress and development is the result of Darwinian mechanisms of evolution.\n\nFinally there is human evolution and the rise of thought or cognition (Vernadsky, Teilhard), and a further leap in complexity and the interior life or consciousness (Teilhard), resulting in the birth of the Noosphere (Vernadsky, Teilhard). Just as the biosphere transformed the geosphere, so the noosphere (human intervention) transformed the biosphere (Vernadsky). Here the evolution of human society (socialization) is ruled by psychological, economic, informational and communicative processes.\n\nFor Teilhard there is a further stage, one of spiritual evolution, the Christing of the collective noosphere, in which humanity converges in a single divinisation he calls the Omega Point.\n\nNine levels are described , the \"classical\" biological stages being levels 6, 7 & 8 of the universal evolution. Stages 1 to 5 are grouped into the Lithosphere, also called Geosphere or Physiosphere, where (the progress of) the structure of the organisms is ruled by structure, mechanical laws and coincidence. Stages 6 to 8 are grouped into the Biosphere, where (the progress of) the structure of the organisms is ruled by genetical mechanisms. The actual stage, stage 9, is called the Noosphere, where (the progress of) the structure of human society (socialization) is ruled by psychological, informational and communicative processes.\n\n\n"}
