The book was first published in 1926 by Oriental Books Agency, Pune, under the patronage of Sir Parashuramarao Bhausaheb, Raja of Jamkhandi. It was later republished by Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Mumbai.\n\nRanade wrote the book on the basis of his various lectures on Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita that were delivered in 1915. In that year, inspired by a lecture of Sir Ramakrishna Gopal Bhandarkar, he had first conceived the idea of a presentation of Upanishadic philosophy in terms of modern thought. He took into consideration of the place of the Upanishads in Indian philosophy, and examined the opinions of the Orientalists with a view to put into hand of the Orientalists and those interested a new method for treating the problems of Indian philosophy, and into the hands of European philosophers a new material for exercising their intellects on, to serve the main intended spiritual purpose. He employed \"the method of construction through a systematic exposition of all the problems that emerge from the discussion of Upanishadic thought in their manifold bearings\". The work is broadly divided into seven chapters. First he deals with the background of Upanishadic Speculation, then with the development of Upanishadic Cosmogony. He discusses the varieties of psychological reflection and the roots of later philosophies, before taking up the problem of the Ultimate Reality in the Upanishads. He covers the ethics of the Upanishads, and finally the intimation of self-realisation. It is a wide-ranging study that through Jnanamarga leads to the inference that dualism or pluralism is only apparent. Ranade provides an exhaustive bibliography that classifies the secondary books on Upanishads under three basic heads: as histories of literature, histories of religion and histories of philosophies. He has, as expected, mentioned about the creation of cosmos by two methods i.e. from life and from lifeless matter.\n\n"}

{"id": "3552463", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3552463", "title": "Anthroposophic medicine", "text": "Anthroposophic medicine\n\nAnthroposophic medicine (or anthroposophical medicine) is a form of alternative medicine. Devised in the 1920s by Rudolf Steiner (1861–1925) in conjunction with Ita Wegman (1876–1943), anthroposophical medicine is based on occult notions and draws on Steiner's spiritual philosophy, which he called anthroposophy. Practitioners employ a variety of treatment techniques based upon anthroposophic precepts, including massage, exercise, counselling, and substances.\n\nMany drug preparations used in anthroposophic medicine are ultra-diluted substances, similar to those used in homeopathy. Homeopathic remedies are not medically effective and are generally considered harmless, except when used as a substitute for a scientifically proven and effective cure. In certain European countries, people with cancer are sometimes prescribed remedies made from specially harvested mistletoe, but research has found no convincing evidence of clinical benefit. Some anthroposophic doctors oppose childhood vaccination, and this has led to preventable outbreaks of disease.\n\nAnthroposophic medicine departs from fundamental biological principles in several respects. For example, Steiner said that the heart does not pump blood but that blood propels itself along. Anthroposophic medicine also proposes that patients' past lives may influence their illness and that the course of an illness is subject to karmic destiny. Professor of complementary medicine Edzard Ernst and other physicians and scientists including Simon Singh and David Gorski have characterized anthroposophic medicine as pseudoscientific quackery with no basis in reason or logic.\n\nThe first steps towards an anthroposophic approach to medicine were made before 1920, when homeopathic physicians and pharmacists began working with Rudolf Steiner, who recommended new medicinal substances as well as specific methods for preparation along with an anthroposophic concept of man. In 1921, Ita Wegman opened the first anthroposophic medical clinic, now known as the Klinik Arlesheim, in Arlesheim, Switzerland. Wegman was soon joined by a number of other doctors. They then began to train the first anthroposophic nurses for the clinic.\n\nAt Wegman's request, Steiner regularly visited the clinic and suggested treatment regimes for particular patients. Between 1920 and 1925, he also gave several series of lectures on medicine. In 1925, Wegman and Steiner wrote the first book on the anthroposophic approach to medicine, \"Fundamentals of Therapy\".\n\nWegman later opened a separate clinic and curative home in Ascona. Wegman lectured widely, visiting the Netherlands and England particularly frequently, and an increasing number of doctors began to include the anthroposophic approach in their practices. A cancer clinic, the Lukas Clinic, opened in Arlesheim in 1963.\n\nIn 1976 anthroposophic medicine in Germany got regulated by law as a specific therapeutic system (\"Besondere Therapierichtung\") by the Medicines Act-Arzneimittelgesetz (AMG) and by the Code of Social Law (Sozialgesetzbuch V)\n\nIn the 1990s the Witten/Herdecke University in Germany established a chair in anthroposophical medicine. The press described the appointment as a \"death sentence\" and the perception that pseudoscience was being taught damaged the university's reputation, bringing it close to financial collapse. It was ultimately saved by a cash injection from Software AG, a technology corporation with a history of funding anthroposophic projects.\n\nIn 2006, anthroposophical medicine was practised in 80 countries.\n\nIn 2012 the University of Aberdeen considered establishing a chair in holistic health jointly funded by Software AG, and by the Anthroposophic Health, Education, and Social Care Movement, each of which would provide £1.5 million of endowment. Edzard Ernst commented \"that any decent university should even consider an anthroposophical medicine unit seems incomprehensible. The fact that it would be backed by people who have a financial interest in this bogus approach makes it even worse.\" The University's governance and nominations committee eventually decided not to proceed with the appointment.\n\nThe categorization of anthroposophical medicine is complex since in part it complements conventional medicine, and in part it substitutes for it. In 2008, Ernst wrote that it was being promoted as an \"extension to conventional medicine\".\n\nErnst writes that Steiner used imagination and insight as a basis for his ideas, drawing mystical knowledge from the occult Akashic Records, a work which is supposedly situated on the astral plane, and which Steiner said was accessible to him via his intuitive powers. On this basis, Steiner proposed \"associations between four postulated dimensions of the human body (physical body, etheric body, astral body, and ego), plants, minerals, and the cosmos\". Steiner also proposed a connection betweens planets, metals and organs so that, for example, the planet Mercury, the element mercury and the lung were all somehow associated. These propositions form the basis of anthroposophical medicine.\n\nErnst has said that anthroposophical medicine \"includes some of the least plausible theories one could possibly imagine\", categorized it as \"pure quackery\", and said that it \"has no basis in science\". According to Quackwatch, anthroposophical medicine practitioners regard illness as a \"rite of passage\" necessary to purge spiritual impurities carried over from past lives, according to the precepts of \"karmic destiny\".\n\nIn anthroposophic pharmacy drugs are prepared according to ancient notions of alchemy and homeopathy which are not related to the science underlying modern pharmacology. During the preparation process, patterns formed by crystallization are interpreted to see which \"etheric force\" they most closely resemble. Most anthroposophic preparations are highly diluted, like homeopathic remedies. This means that, while they are completely harmless in themselves, using them in place of conventional medicine to treat serious illness carries a risk of severe adverse consequences.\n\nAs well as drug remedies, anthroposophical medicine also includes:\n\n\nTo select an anthroposophic substance for a particular illness, practitioners consider the source of the substances used. The character of a mineral, plant or animal is hypothesised to have been formed by the substances that are most active within it, in the belief that this character may also influence what the substance will accomplish when given to treat another organism. This is related to Samuel Hahnemann's Doctrine of signatures. Willow, for example, is considered to have an unusual character:\nThere is no scientific evidence that the shape of plants has ever caused a new medical property to be discovered.\n\nSteiner described the heart not as a pump, but as a regulator of flow, such that the heartbeat itself can be distinguished from the circulation of blood. Anthroposophic medicine claims the flow in the blood of the circulatory system is, as Marinelli put it, \"propelled with its own biological momentum, as can be seen in the embryo, and boosts itself with \"induced\" momenta from the heart\".\n\nThis view of the heart is not based on any scientific theory and has been characterized as \"crank science\".\n\nRudolf Steiner hypothesised that mistletoe could cure cancer, on the basis of the observation that the plant was a parasite which eventually killed its host, a process which he claimed paralleled the progression of cancer. Steiner believed the plant's medical potential was influenced by the position of the sun, moon and planets and that it therefore was important to harvest the plant at the right time. Some mistletoe preparations are ultra-diluted; others are made from fermented mistletoe. The most commonly used trade names for mistletoe drugs are Iscador and Helixor.\n\nAlthough laboratory experiments have suggested that mistletoe extract may affect the immune system and be able to kill some kinds of cancer cells, there is little evidence of its benefit to people with cancer. Most of the clinical research claiming that mistletoe therapy is effective is published in Germany, and it is generally considered unreliable because of major lapses in quality. Edzard Ernst wrote that research by anthroposophic doctors often reached positive conclusions on mistletoe therapy because it drew on unreliable material; independent researchers tended instead to find no evidence of benefit. The American Cancer Society says that \"available evidence from well-designed clinical trials does not support claims that mistletoe can improve length or quality of life\".\n\nMistletoe-based cancer drugs are widely used in Europe, especially in German-speaking countries. In 2002 nearly half a million prescriptions were paid for by German health insurance and in 2006 there were reportedly around 30 types of mistletoe extract on the market. Mistletoe extracts have been used as an unconventional treatment for cancer patients in the Netherlands, and in Germany the treatment has been approved as palliative therapy to treat the symptoms of patients with malignant tumors. In Sweden, controversially, mistletoe therapy has been approved for use in the treatment of cancer symptoms.\n\nIn other countries mistletoe therapy is virtually unknown. The United States Food and Drug Administration has not approved mistletoe-based drugs for any purpose; mistletoe extracts may not be distributed in or imported into the US except for research purposes. no mistletoe-based drugs are licensed for use in the United Kingdom.\n\nA 2013 article on mistletoe in \"Lancet Oncology\" invoked Ben Goldacre's observation that a geographical preference for certain therapies was a hallmark of quackery, and proposed that the continuing use of this \"apparently ineffectual therapy\" in a small cluster of countries was based on sociological rather than medical reasons, indicating a need for a more informed consent from patients.\n\nThe risks arising from using anthroposophical medicine as a substitute for evidence-based medicine are exemplified by several cases of low vaccination levels in Waldorf schools, since some anthroposophical doctors oppose immunization. A 1999 study of children in Sweden showed that in Waldorf schools, only 18% had received MMR vaccination, compared to a level of 93% in other schools nationally.\n\nA 2003 report of a widespread measles outbreak around Coburg, Germany, identified a Waldorf school as the origin. At the time the town's mayor had condemned homeopathic doctors who had discouraged vaccination, saying \"Their stronghold is the Waldorf School, which actively encourages people not to have their children vaccinated. Now we have an epidemic.\"\n\nPaul Offit writes that Steiner believed vaccination \"interferes with karmic development and the cycles of reincarnation\", and that adherence to this belief led to a 2008 pertussis outbreak in a Californian Waldorf school, causing its temporary closure.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "314708", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=314708", "title": "Autosuggestion", "text": "Autosuggestion\n\nAutosuggestion is a psychological technique related to the placebo effect, developed by apothecary Émile Coué at the beginning of the 20th century. It is a form of self-induced suggestion in which individuals guide their own thoughts, feelings, or behavior. The technique is often used in self-hypnosis.\n\nÉmile Coué identified two very different types of self-suggestion:\n\nIn relation to Coué's group of \"spontaneous auto-suggestions\", his student Charles Baudouin (1920, p. 41) made three further useful distinctions, based upon the sources from which they came:\n\nÉmile Coué, who had both B.A. and B.Sc. degrees before he was 21, graduated top of his class (with First Class Honours) with a degree in pharmacology from the prestigious Collège Sainte-Barbe in Paris in 1882. Having spent an additional six months as an intern at the Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital in Paris, he returned to Troyes, where he worked as an apothecary from 1882 to 1910.\n\nIn 1885, his investigations of hypnotism and the power of the imagination began with Ambroise-Auguste Liébeault and Hippolyte Bernheim, two leading exponents of \"hypnosis\", of Nancy, with whom he studied in 1885 and 1886 (having taken leave from his business in Troyes). Following this training, \"he dabbled with ‘hypnosis’ in Troyes in 1886, but soon discovered that their Liébeault's techniques were hopeless, and abandoned ‘hypnosis’ altogether\".\n\nIn 1901, Coué sent to the United States for a free book, \"Hypnotism as It is\" (i.e., Sage, 1900a), which purported to disclose \"secrets [of the] science that brings business and social success\" and \"the hidden mysteries of personal magnetism, hypnotism, magnetic healing, etc.\". Deeply impressed by its contents, he purchased the French language version of the associated correspondence course (i.e., Sage, 1900b, and 1900c), created by stage hypnotist extraordinaire, \"Professor Xenophon LaMotte Sage, A.M., Ph.D., LL.D., of Rochester, New York\" (who had been admitted into the prestigious \"Medico-Legal Society of New York\" in 1899).\n\nIn real life, Xenophon LaMotte Sage was none other than Ewing Virgil Neal (1868-1949), the multi-millionaire, calligrapher, hypnotist, publisher, advertising/marketing pioneer (he launched the career of Carl R. Byoir), pharmaceutical manufacturer, parfumier, international businessman, confidant of Mussolini, Commandatore of the Order of the Crown of Italy, Officer of the Legion of Honour, and fugitive from justice, who moved to France in the 1920s.\n\nSage's course supplied the missing piece of the puzzle — namely, Braid-style hypnotic inductions — the solution for which had, up to that time, eluded Coué: \n\nAlthough he had abandoned Liébeault's \"hypnosis\" in 1886, he adopted Braid's \"hypnotism\" in 1901; and, in fact, in addition to, and (often) separate from, his auto-suggestive practices, Coué actively used Braid's hypnotism for the rest of his professional life.\n\nCoué was so deeply impressed by Bernheim's concept of “suggestive therapeutics” — in effect, \"an imperfect re-branding of the ‘dominant idea’ theory that Braid had appropriated from Thomas Brown\" — that, on his return to Troyes from his (1886-1886) interlude with Liébeault and Bernheim, he made a practice of reassuring his clients by praising each remedy's efficacy. He noticed that, in specific cases, he could increase a medicine's efficacy by praising its effectiveness. He realized that, when compared those to whom he said nothing, those to whom he praised the medicine had a noticeable improvement (this is suggestive of what would later be identified as a \"placebo response\").\n\nCoué discovered that subjects could not be hypnotized against their will and, more importantly, that the effects of hypnotic suggestion waned when the subjects regained consciousness. He thus eventually developed the Coué method, and released his first book, \"Self-Mastery Through Conscious Autosuggestion\" (published in 1920 in England and two years later in the United States). He described autosuggestion itself as:\nAlthough Coué never doubted pharmaceutical medicine, and still advocated its application, he also came to believe that one's mental state could positively affect, and even amplify, the pharmaceutical action of medication. He observed that those patients who used his mantra-like conscious suggestion, \"Every day, in every way, I'm getting better and better\", (French: \"Tous les jours, à tous points de vue, je vais de mieux en mieux\"; lit. 'Every day, from all points of view, I'm getting better and better') — in his view, replacing their \"thought of illness\" with a new \"thought of cure\", could augment their pharmaceutical regimen in an efficacious way.\n\nBy contrast with the conceptualization driving Coué's auto-suggestive self-administration procedure — namely, that constant repetition creates a situation in which \"a particular idea saturates the microcognitive environment of 'the mind'…\", which, then, in its turn, \"is converted into a corresponding ideomotor, ideosensory, or ideoaffective action, by the \"ideodynamic principle of action\"\", \"which then, in its turn, generates the response\" — the primary target of the entirely different self-administration procedure developed by Johannes Heinrich Schultz, known as \"Autogenic Training\", was to affect the autonomic nervous system, rather than (as Coué's did) to affect 'the mind'.\n\nThe Coué method centers on a routine repetition of this particular expression according to a specified ritual, in a given physical state, and in the absence of any sort of allied mental imagery, at the beginning and at the end of each day. Coué maintained that curing some of our troubles requires a change in our subconscious/unconscious thought, which can only be achieved by using our imagination. Although stressing that he was not primarily a healer but one who taught others to heal themselves, Coué claimed to have affected organic changes through autosuggestion.\n\nCoué thus developed a method which relied on the belief that \"any idea exclusively occupying the mind turns into reality\", although only to the extent that the idea is within the realm of possibility. For instance, a person without hands will not be able to make them grow back. However, if a person firmly believes that his or her asthma is disappearing, then this may actually happen, as far as the body is actually able to physically overcome or control the illness. On the other hand, thinking negatively about the illness (e.g. \"I am not feeling well\") will encourage both mind and body to accept this thought.\n\nCoué observed that the main obstacle to autosuggestion was willpower. For the method to work, the patient must refrain from making any independent judgement, meaning that he must not let his will impose its own views on positive ideas. Everything must thus be done to ensure that the positive \"autosuggestive\" idea is consciously \"accepted\" by the patient, otherwise one may end up getting the opposite effect of what is desired.\n\nCoué noted that young children always applied his method perfectly, as they lacked the willpower that remained present among adults. When he instructed a child by saying \"clasp your hands\" and then \"you can't pull them apart\" the child would thus immediately follow his instructions and be unable to unclasp their hands.\n\nCoué believed a patient's problems were likely to increase if his willpower and imagination opposed each other, something Coué referred to as \"self-conflict.\" As the conflict intensifies, so does the problem i.e., the more the patient consciously wants to sleep, the more he becomes awake. The patient must thus abandon his willpower and instead put more focus on his imaginative power in order to fully succeed with his cure.\n\nWith his method, which Coué once called his \"trick\", patients of all sorts would come to visit him. The list of ailments included kidney problems, diabetes, memory loss, stammering, weakness, atrophy and all sorts of physical and mental illnesses. According to one of his journal entries (1916), he apparently cured a patient of a uterus prolapse as well as \"violent pains in the head\" (migraine).\n\nAdvocates of autosuggestion appeal to brief case histories published by Émile Coué describing his use of autohypnosis to cure, for example, enteritis and paralysis from spinal cord injury.\n\nAutogenic training is an autosuggestion-centered relaxation technique influenced by the Coué method. In 1932, German psychiatrist Johannes Schultz developed and published on autogenic training. Unlike autosuggestion, autogenic training has been proven in clinical trials and, along with other relaxation techniques, such as progressive relaxation and meditation, has replaced autosuggestion in therapy. The co-author of Schultz's multi-volume tome on autogenic training, Wolfgang Luthe, was a firm believer that autogenic training was a powerful approach that should only be offered to patients by qualified professionals. Its effectiveness has been confirmed in several studies.\n\n"}

Sit relaxed but alert. Silently, interiorly begin to say a single word. We recommend the prayer phrase maranatha. Recite it as four syllables of equal length. Ma-ra-na-tha. Listen to it as you say it, gently but continuously. Do not think or imagine anything - spiritual or otherwise. If thoughts and images come, these are distractions at the time of meditation, so keep returning to simply saying the word. Meditate each morning and evening for twenty to thirty minutes.\n"}

Meeker had begun to experiment with Attunement in 1929. Emissaries of Divine Light dates its origin to Meeker’s spiritual awakening on September 16, 1932. On three successive evenings, Meeker had been compelled to write and, as he did so, he experienced a higher spiritual awareness that flowed through him. He reported that he had been looking for a teacher but realized through his awakening that the teacher he sought was within him.\n\nMeeker lectured, taught, and practiced Attunement in various locations in North America from 1929 to 1945. He wrote under the pen name Uranda, and he was known to his followers by that name. In 1945 Meeker established his headquarters at Sunrise Ranch, which was a dryland farm at the time. From 1952 to 1954 he conducted six-month Servers Training School classes at Sunrise Ranch, teaching Attunement and the spiritual understanding behind the practice, as well as practical spirituality. These classes were attended by people from many backgrounds, and included GPC (God-Patient-Chiropractor) chiropractors, led by a former Major League Baseball pitcher, George Shears, and others.\n\nIn 1954 Meeker died in a plane crash in San Francisco Bay with his wife, Kathy Meeker. A close associate of Meeker’s, Albert Ackerley, and two children also died in the crash. Lord Martin Cecil (1909-1988), who had worked closely with Meeker, assumed the responsibility for leading Emissaries of Divine Light from 1954 until his death in 1988. Lord Martin succeeded his older brother to become The 7th Marquess of Exeter in October 1981.\n\nLord Martin Cecil was the second son of The 5th Marquess of Exeter and was descended from William Cecil, chief adviser to Queen Elizabeth I. He led a ranching operation on his family’s property in the Cariboo country of British Columbia. In 1948, Cecil formed a spiritual community at 100 Mile House, BC. On the death of his brother, The 6th Marquess of Exeter, in October 1981, he became The 7th Marquess of Exeter and a member of the House of Lords of the United Kingdom. However, he never spoke in the House.\n\nUnder Lord Martin's leadership, the network grew to about 4,000 adherents. Many young people, disenchanted with the Vietnam War and inspired by the idealism of the 1960s and ’70s, were drawn to his message and the network that was growing around him. Twelve centers developed around the world, and numerous other nonprofit organizations were birthed by participants in Emissaries of Divine Light. These included an outdoor adventure educational organization, Educo; an association of spiritually based business people, Renaissance Business Associates; an association of media professionals, Association for Responsible Communication; an association of educators, Renaissance Educational Associates; and Emissary Foundation International.\n\nBill Bahan became an important leader and teacher for Emissaries of Divine Light in the ’60s, ’70s and early ’80s, offering classes at Sunrise Ranch; Epping, New Hampshire; and Livingston Manor, New York. He was a nephew of George Shears, D.C., leader of the G-P-C Chiropractic Movement. He and his brother Walter Bahan (also active in the Emissary program), along with three other brothers (all five chiropractors), operated the Bahan and Bahan Chiropractic Clinics in Salem and Derry, New Hampshire, using GPC principles. Bill founded the Whole Health Institute, an association of healthcare professionals promoting wholistic health. They hosted conferences and lectures around the world, and published the journal \"Healing Currents\". In Bill's words, \"Health is the unhindered expression of life through the body, truth through the mind and love through the heart.\"\n\nWhen Lord Exeter died in January 1988, his son, Michael, 8th Marquess of Exeter (formerly known as Lord Burghley), became the leader of Emissaries of Divine Light until he left the organisation in 1996. In that eight-year period, much of the leadership left the organisation, including most of the children of both Lloyd Arthur Meeker and Martin, Lord Exeter, who had been prominent in the network. From 1988 to 1996, more than two thirds of the participants in Emissaries of Divine Light left as well. Many ex-members became bitter about their experience and launched accusations against the organization.\n\nAs The 8th Marquess of Exeter resigned from his position in 1996, a group of trustees assumed responsibility for the leadership of the network. They set in place ethical guidelines throughout the network and addressed grievances brought to them by participants. They sought to bring the universal truths taught by Lloyd Arthur Meeker into contemporary language and practice.\n\nIn the 1990s, Emissaries of Divine Light developed new programs for spiritual understanding and personal development. \"Deepening Spiritual Expression\" and \"The Opening\" are week-long residential programs that are still offered by the organization. They also developed Attunement Practitioner certification training, which is available at many Emissary centers.\n\nIn August 2004, the trustees of Emissaries of Divine Light named David Karchere as the leader of the global network. In 2008, David Karchere and Jane Anetrini developed and taught a year-long leadership program based on the teachings of Emissaries of Divine Light. A second session of the program was conducted in 2009 and 2010. In 2012 they initiated a new series of seminars under the title \"Practical Spirituality: An Operator’s Guide to Being Human\", led by David Karchere.\n\nThe headquarters of Emissaries of Divine Light was established in 1945 at Sunrise Ranch in Loveland, Colorado, now a conference and retreat center staffed by a community of eighty-five people. Sunrise Ranch hosts workshops, seminars and retreats intended to offer the participants fresh thinking and understanding, leading to a direct experience of spiritual renewal. There are seven other major centers around the world for Emissaries of Divine Light, each offering programs with a similar approach.\n\nSunrise Ranch also offers residential work-study programs in practical spirituality, which it defines as the application of universal spiritual principles to the common issues of human life. These include a program designed for personal spiritual renewal, called \"Full Self Emergence\", and a \"Permaculture Design Course\" for people interested in sustainable human systems and sustainable agriculture.\n\nThe trustees of Emissaries of Divine Light lead the Creative Field Project. The project is an exploration of the power of human intention to influence the field of energy held by a group of people. The Creative Field Project began in 2009 with a network of small groups around the world that meet monthly by telephone. It included the first Creative Field Conference in 2011 at Sunrise Ranch that featured Lynne McTaggart, who wrote The Field; and American priest and theologian Matthew Fox. In 2012, Emissaries of Divine Light joined with the Novalis Ubuntu Institute in Cape Town, South Africa, to host the Creative Field Conference—South Africa: Your Destiny Is Calling.\n\nEmissaries of Divine Light teach that the key to creative living is the individual’s openness to the source of universal power and intelligence within them, and that human emotions either connect a person to that source or cut them off from it. The educational programs of the Emissaries are designed to assist people to find out what has been emotionally triggering them, so that they can withdraw their emotional attention from the trigger and turn it to the life force within them. The Emissaries believe that behind all emotions is the universal power of love and a universal intelligence that bring spiritual enlightenment. They teach that through deliberate conscious thought a person can let their own emotional current purify, so that they open themselves to the flow of the universal power and intelligence within them.\n\nThe central teaching of Emissaries of Divine Light is referred to as The One Law. They describe it as a law of cause and effect. They see the causative factor in spiritual regeneration as the universal power and intelligence within all people, and the effect in human experience as dependent on the response to that internal reality. They describe the creative process in human experience as the working of The One Law in a sequence of five stages: radiation, response, attraction, union and unified radiation. Their seminars claim to assist people to withdraw their energetic response from the circumstances around them and direct it to the power and intelligence within them.\n\nEmissaries of Divine Light describe the process of personal spiritual renewal as Full Self Emergence because they believe that a person is renewed when their own divine selfhood expresses through their mind, emotions and their body. They use the story of the Seven Days of Creation in Genesis as a symbolic template for the process of spiritual renewal in the life of the individual, and for humankind as a whole.\n\nAttunement is a central practice of Emissaries of Divine Light. The origin of the word Attunement refers to the attuning of the human capacity with the universal animating spirit within all people. Attunement practitioners believe that positive shifts in consciousness release a healing energy through a person’s body, mind and emotions.\n\nEmissaries of Divine Light practice Attunement as a form of energy medicine. Attunement practitioners believe that universal life energy is conveyed to the client through the hands of the practitioner. The primary contact points for the client receiving the Attunement are the endocrine glands. Attunement practitioners teach that the endocrine glands are portals for universal life energy that operates through the physical body, and through the mental and emotional function of the individual.\n\nEmissaries of Divine Light also teach Attunement as a personal spiritual practice. They believe it is a central factor in the conscious evolution of humanity.\n\nEmissaries of Divine Light is led by David Karchere, who is the spiritual director of the organization, and six other trustees. Karchere lives, writes and teaches at Sunrise Ranch, and travels in North America, Europe, Africa and Australia, offering programs on practical spirituality and Attunement.\n\nThe trustees are elected by an International Emissary Congress with representatives from Emissary organizations around the world. Currently, the trustees are Jane Anetrini, Ruth Buckingham, Hugh Duff, David Karchere, Marilyn Manderson, Phil Richardson and Maureen Waller.\n\nIn addition to their international headquarters at Sunrise Ranch, Emissaries of Divine Light used to operate Glen Ivy in Corona, California, as a conference and retreat center and an Attunement teaching center. Glen Ivy is also a natural mineral springs. The Emissaries leased the mineral springs and the spa property adjacent to their center to Glen Ivy Hot Springs, a popular destination in Southern California. The property was sold in 2016.\n\nThese are the major centers for Emissaries of Divine Light around the world:\n\n\nBeginning in the 1930s, Emissaries of Divine Light have continually published their writings and teachings and circulated these to their membership. In 1936, Lloyd A. Meeker published his seven-week meditation guide, \"Seven Steps to the Temple of Light\", as well as his correspondence course, \"Steps to Mastership\". In the 1980s, Martin Cecil published eighteen volumes of his own writing and the writings of Lloyd Meeker under the title \"The Third Sacred School\".\n\nFor most of its history, weekly talks and writings of Emissary leadership have been distributed by regular mail. Since 2005, the organization has circulated a weekly e-mail message, \"The Pulse of Spirit\", authored by David Karchere and other current leaders of the network. In 2010 they began to publish the \"Journal of the Creative Field\".\n"}

It is the theological method stressed by Augustine (354–430) and Anselm of Canterbury ( – 1109) in which one begins with belief in faith and on the basis of that faith moves on to further understanding of Christian truth. \nAnselm uses this expression for the first time in his Proslogion (II–IV). It articulates the close relationship between faith and human reason. This is the key to Anselm's theological thought and philosophical thinking. He would understand all things in faith. It means to understand intellectually what we already believe. Chronologically, faith precedes understanding, like when small children first trust their parents and believe what they state, and just later on, when they grow up, they want to examine and understand the reality by themselves. But, logically, intellect precedes faith, because we trust other people, at least in principle, only provisionally, but our aim is a direct personal knowledge. In the words of Anselm of Canterbury : \"Neque enim quaero intelligere ut credam, sed credo ut intelligam\" (\"I do not seek to understand in order that I may believe, but rather, I believe in order that I may understand\").\n\n\n"}

{"id": "143245", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=143245", "title": "Gospel of Thomas", "text": "Gospel of Thomas\n\nThe Gospel of Thomas is a non-canonical sayings gospel. It was discovered near Nag Hammadi, Egypt, in December 1945 among a group of books known as the Nag Hammadi library. Scholars speculate that the works were buried in response to a letter from Bishop Athanasius declaring a strict canon of Christian scripture.\n\nThe Coptic-language text, the second of seven contained in what modern-day scholars have designated as Codex II, is composed of 114 sayings attributed to Jesus. Almost half of these sayings resemble those found in the Canonical Gospels, while it is speculated that the other sayings were added from Gnostic tradition. Its place of origin may have been Syria, where Thomasine traditions were strong.\n\nThe introduction states: \"These are the hidden words that the living Jesus spoke and Didymos Judas Thomas wrote them down.\" Didymus (Greek) and Thomas (Aramaic) both mean \"twin\". Some critical scholars suspect that this reference to the Apostle Thomas is false, and that therefore the true author is unknown.\n\nIt is possible that the document originated within a school of early Christians, possibly proto-Gnostics. Some verses are similar to verses in the Quran. Some critics further state that even the description of Thomas as a \"gnostic\" gospel is based upon little other than the fact that it was found along with gnostic texts at Nag Hammadi. The name of Thomas was also attached to the Book of Thomas the Contender, which was also in Nag Hammadi Codex II, and the Acts of Thomas. While the Gospel of Thomas does not directly point to Jesus' divinity, it also does not directly contradict it, and therefore neither supports nor contradicts gnostic beliefs. When asked his identity in the Gospel of Thomas, Jesus usually deflects, ambiguously asking the disciples why they do not see what is right in front of them, similar to some passages in the canonical gospels like John 12:16 and Luke 18:34.\n\nThe Gospel of Thomas is very different in tone and structure from other New Testament apocrypha and the four Canonical Gospels. Unlike the canonical Gospels, it is not a narrative account of the life of Jesus; instead, it consists of \"logia\" (sayings) attributed to Jesus, sometimes stand-alone, sometimes embedded in short dialogues or parables. The text contains a possible allusion to the death of Jesus in logion 65 (Parable of the Wicked Tenants, paralleled in the Synoptic Gospels), but does not mention his crucifixion, his resurrection, or the final judgment; nor does it mention a messianic understanding of Jesus. Since its discovery, many scholars have seen it as evidence in support of the existence of the so-called Q source, which might have been very similar in its form as a collection of sayings of Jesus without any accounts of his deeds or his life and death, a so-called \"sayings gospel\".\n\nBishop Eusebius included it among a group of books that he believed to be not only spurious, but \"the fictions of heretics\". However, it is not clear whether he was referring to this Gospel of Thomas or one of the other texts attributed to Thomas.\n\nThe manuscript of the Coptic text (CG II), found in 1945 at Nag Hammadi, Egypt, is dated at around 340 AD. It was first published in a photographic edition in 1956. This was followed three years later (1959) by the first English-language translation, with Coptic transcription. In 1977, James M. Robinson edited the first complete collection of English translations of the Nag Hammadi texts. The Gospel of Thomas has been translated and annotated worldwide in many languages.\n\nThe original Coptic manuscript is now the property of the Coptic Museum in Cairo, Egypt, Department of Manuscripts.\n\nAfter the Coptic version of the complete text was discovered in 1945 at Nag Hammadi, scholars soon realized that three different Greek text fragments previously found at Oxyrhynchus (the Oxyrhynchus Papyri), also in Egypt, were part of the Gospel of Thomas. These three papyrus fragments of Thomas date to between 130 and 250 AD.\nPrior to the Nag Hammadi library discovery, the sayings of Jesus found in Oxyrhynchus were known simply as Logia Iesu. The corresponding Uncial script Greek fragments of the Gospel of Thomas, found in Oxyrhynchus are:\n\nThe wording of the Coptic sometimes differs markedly from the earlier Greek Oxyrhynchus texts, the extreme case being that the last portion of logion 30 in the Greek is found at the end of logion 77 in the Coptic. This fact, along with the quite different wording Hippolytus uses when apparently quoting it (see below), suggests that the Gospel of Thomas \"may have circulated in more than one form and passed through several stages of redaction.\"\n\nAlthough it is generally thought that the Gospel of Thomas was first composed in Greek, there is evidence that the Coptic Nag Hammadi text is a translation from Syriac (see Syriac origin).\n\nThe earliest surviving written references to the \"Gospel of Thomas\" are found in the writings of Hippolytus of Rome (\"c.\" 222–235) and Origen of Alexandria (\"c.\" 233). Hippolytus wrote in his \"Refutation of All Heresies\" 5.7.20:\n\nThis appears to be a reference to saying 4 of Thomas, although the wording differs significantly.\n\nOrigen listed the \"Gospel according to Thomas\" as being among the heterodox apocryphal gospels known to him (\"Hom. in Luc.\" 1).\n\nIn the 4th and 5th centuries, various Church Fathers wrote that the Gospel of Thomas was highly valued by Mani. In the 4th century, Cyril of Jerusalem mentioned a \"Gospel of Thomas\" twice in his \"Catechesis\": \"The Manichæans also wrote a Gospel according to Thomas, which being tinctured with the fragrance of the evangelic title corrupts the souls of the simple sort.\" and \"Let none read the Gospel according to Thomas: for it is the work not of one of the twelve Apostles, but of one of the three wicked disciples of Manes.\" The 5th-century \"Decretum Gelasianum\" includes \"A Gospel attributed to Thomas which the Manichaean use\" in its list of heretical books.\n\nRichard Valantasis writes:\nValantasis and other scholars argue that it is difficult to date Thomas because, as a collection of \"logia\" without a narrative framework, individual sayings could have been added to it gradually over time. Valantasis dates Thomas to 100 – 110 AD, with some of the material certainly coming from the first stratum which is dated to 30 – 60 AD. J. R. Porter dates the Gospel of Thomas much later, to 250 AD.\n\nRobert E. Van Voorst states:\n\nTheissen and Merz argue the genre of a collection of sayings was one of the earliest forms in which material about Jesus was handed down. They assert that other collections of sayings, such as the Q document and the collection underlying Mark 4, were absorbed into larger narratives and no longer survive as independent documents, and that no later collections in this form survive. Marvin Meyer also asserted that the genre of a \"sayings collection\" is indicative of the 1st century, and that in particular the \"use of parables without allegorical amplification\" seems to antedate the canonical gospels. Maurice Casey has strongly questioned the argument from genre: the \"logic of the argument requires that Q and the Gospel of Thomas be also dated at the same time as both the book of Proverbs and the \"Sayings of Amen-em-Opet\".\"\n\nStevan L. Davies argues that the apparent independence of the ordering of sayings in Thomas from that of their parallels in the synoptics shows that Thomas was not evidently reliant upon the canonical gospels and probably predated them. Several authors argue that when the logia in Thomas do have parallels in the synoptics, the version in Thomas often seems closer to the source. Theissen and Merz give sayings 31 and 65 as examples of this. Koester agrees, citing especially the parables contained in sayings 8, 9, 57, 63, 64 and 65. In the few instances where the version in Thomas seems to be dependent on the Synoptics, Koester suggests, this may be due to the influence of the person who translated the text from Greek into Coptic.\n\nKoester also argues that the absence of narrative materials (such as those found in the canonical gospels) in Thomas makes it unlikely that the gospel is \"an eclectic excerpt from the gospels of the New Testament\". He also cites the absence of the eschatological sayings considered characteristic of Q to show the independence of Thomas from that source.\n\nAnother argument for an early date is what some scholars have suggested is an interplay between the Gospel of John and the \"logia\" of Thomas. Parallels between the two have been taken to suggest that Thomas' \"logia\" preceded John's work, and that the latter was making a point-by-point riposte to Thomas, either in real or mock conflict. This seeming dialectic has been pointed out by several New Testament scholars, notably Gregory J. Riley, April DeConick, and Elaine Pagels. Though differing in approach, they argue that several verses in the Gospel of John are best understood as responses to a Thomasine community and its beliefs. Pagels, for example, says that John's gospel makes two references to the inability of the world to recognize the divine light. In contrast, several of Thomas' sayings refer to the light born 'within'.\n\nJohn's gospel is the only canonical one that gives Thomas the Apostle a dramatic role and spoken part, and Thomas is the only character therein described as having \"apistos\" (unbelief), despite the failings of virtually all the Johannine characters to live up to the author's standards of belief. With respect to the famous story of \"Doubting Thomas\", it is suggested that John may have been denigrating or ridiculing a rival school of thought. In another apparent contrast, John's text matter-of-factly presents a bodily resurrection as if this is a \"sine qua non\" of the faith; in contrast, Thomas' insights about the spirit-and-body are more nuanced. For Thomas, resurrection seems more a cognitive event of spiritual attainment, one even involving a certain discipline or asceticism. Again, an apparently denigrating portrayal in the \"Doubting Thomas\" story may either be taken literally, or as a kind of mock \"comeback\" to Thomas' logia: not as an outright censuring of Thomas, but an improving gloss. After all, Thomas' thoughts about the spirit and body are really not so different from those which John has presented elsewhere. John portrays Thomas as physically touching the risen Jesus, inserting fingers and hands into his body, and ending with a shout. Pagels interprets this as signifying one-upmanship by John, who is forcing Thomas to acknowledge Jesus' bodily nature. She writes that \"...he shows Thomas giving up his search for experiential truth – his 'unbelief' – to confess what John sees as the truth...\". The point of these examples, as used by Riley and Pagels, is to support the argument that the text of Thomas must have existed and have gained a following at the time of the writing of John's Gospel, and that the importance of the Thomasine logia was great enough that John felt the necessity of weaving them into his own narrative.\n\nAs the scholarly debate continues on the issue of possible John–Thomas interplay, Christopher Skinner more recently responded in part to Riley, DeConick, and Pagels with \"John and Thomas – Gospels in Conflict?\" (Wipf and Stock, Princeton Theological Monograph Series 115, 2009).\n\nAlbert Hogeterp argues that the Gospel's saying 12, which attributes leadership of the community to James the Just rather than to Peter, agrees with the description of the early Jerusalem church by Paul in Galatians and may reflect a tradition predating AD 70. Meyer also lists \"uncertainty about James the righteous, the brother of Jesus\" as characteristic of a 1st-century origin.\n\nIn later traditions (most notably in the Acts of Thomas, Book of Thomas the Contender, etc.), Thomas is regarded as the twin brother of Jesus. Nonetheless, this gospel holds some sentences (log. 55, 99 y 101), that are in opposition with the familiar group of Jesus, which involves difficulties, when it tries to identify him with James, the brother, quoted by Josephus in Antiquities of the Jews. Moreover, there are some sayings, (principally log. 6, 14, 104) and Oxyrh. papyri 654 (log. 6) in which Gospel is shown in the opposite point of view to Jewish mores specially in respect to the circumcision and dietary practices (log. 55), key issue, in the early Jewish-Christian community led by James (Acts 15: 1-35, Gal. 2:1–10).\n\nIn saying 13, Peter and Matthew are depicted as unable to understand the true significance or identity of Jesus. Patterson argues that this can be interpreted as a criticism against the school of Christianity associated with the Gospel of Matthew, and that \"[t]his sort of rivalry seems more at home in the first century than later\", when all the apostles had become revered figures.\n\nAccording to Meyer, Thomas's saying 17: \"I shall give you what no eye has seen, what no ear has heard and no hand has touched, and what has not come into the human heart\", is strikingly similar to what Paul wrote in (which was itself an allusion to ).\n\nThe late camp dates \"Thomas\" some time after 100 AD, generally in the mid-2nd century. They generally believe that although the text was composed around the mid-2nd century, it contains earlier sayings such as those originally found in the New Testament gospels of which \"Thomas\" was in some sense dependent in addition to inauthentic and possibly authentic independent sayings not found in any other extant text. J. R. Porter dates Thomas much later, to the mid-third century.\n\nSeveral scholars have argued that the sayings in \"Thomas\" reflect conflations and harmonisations dependent on the canonical gospels. For example, saying 10 and 16 appear to contain a redacted harmonisation of , and . In this case it has been suggested that the dependence is best explained by the author of \"Thomas\" making use of an earlier harmonised oral tradition based on Matthew and Luke. Biblical scholar Craig A. Evans also subscribes to this view and notes that \"Over half of the New Testament writings are quoted, paralleled, or alluded to in Thomas... I'm not aware of a Christian writing prior to AD 150 that references this much of the New Testament.\"\n\nAnother argument made for the late dating of Thomas is based upon the fact that Saying 5 in the original Greek (Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 654) seems to follow the vocabulary used in the gospel according to Luke (), and not the vocabulary used in the gospel according to Mark (). According to this argument – which presupposes firstly the rectitude of the two-source hypothesis (widely held among current New Testament scholars), in which the author of Luke is seen as having used the pre-existing gospel according to Mark plus a lost Q document to compose his gospel – if the author of Thomas did, as Saying 5 suggests – refer to a pre-existing gospel according to Luke, rather than Mark's vocabulary, then the gospel of Thomas must have been composed after both Mark and Luke (the latter of which is dated to between 60 AD and 90 AD).\n\nAnother saying that employs similar vocabulary to that used in Luke rather than Mark is Saying 31 in the original Greek (Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 1), where Luke 4:24's term \"dektos\" (acceptable) is employed rather than 's \"atimos\" (without honor). The word \"dektos\" (in all its cases and genders) is clearly typical of Luke, since it is only employed by him in the canonical gospels ; ; ). Thus, the argument runs, the Greek Thomas has clearly been at least influenced by Luke's characteristic vocabulary.\n\nJ. R. Porter states that, because around half of the sayings in Thomas have parallels in the synoptic gospels, it is \"possible that the sayings in the Gospel of Thomas were selected directly from the canonical gospels and were either reproduced more or less exactly or amended to fit the author's distinctive theological outlook.\" According to John P. Meier, scholars predominantly conclude that Thomas depends on or harmonizes the Synoptics.\n\nSeveral scholars argue that Thomas is dependent on Syriac writings, including unique versions of the canonical gospels. They contend that many sayings of the Gospel of Thomas are more similar to Syriac translations of the canonical gospels than their record in the original Greek. Craig A. Evans states that saying 54 in \"Thomas\", which speaks of the poor and the kingdom of heaven, is more similar to the Syriac version of Matthew 5:3 than the Greek version of that passage or the parallel in Luke 6:20.\n\nKlyne Snodgrass notes that saying 65–66 of \"Thomas\" containing the Parable of the Wicked Tenants appears to be dependent on the early harmonisation of Mark and Luke found in the old Syriac gospels. He concludes that, \"\"Thomas\", rather than representing the earliest form, has been shaped by this harmonizing tendency in Syria. If the \"Gospel of Thomas\" were the earliest, we would have to imagine that each of the evangelists or the traditions behind them expanded the parable in different directions and then that in the process of transmission the text was trimmed back to the form it has in the Syriac Gospels. It is much more likely that Thomas, which has a Syrian provenance, is dependent on the tradition of the canonical Gospels that has been abbreviated and harmonized by oral transmission.\"\n\nNicholas Perrin argues that \"Thomas\" is dependent on the \"Diatessaron\", which was composed shortly after 172 by Tatian in Syria. Perrin explains the order of the sayings by attempting to demonstrate that almost all adjacent sayings are connected by Syriac catchwords, whereas in Coptic or Greek, catchwords have been found for only less than half of the pairs of adjacent sayings. Peter J. Williams analyzed Perrin's alleged Syriac catchwords and found them implausible.\n\nBart Ehrman argues that the historical Jesus was an apocalyptic preacher, and that his apocalyptic beliefs are recorded in the earliest Christian documents: Mark and the authentic Pauline epistles. The earliest Christians believed Jesus would soon return, and their beliefs are echoed in the earliest Christian writings. The Gospel of Thomas proclaims that the Kingdom of God is already present for those who understand the secret message of Jesus (Saying 113), and lacks apocalyptic themes. Because of this, Ehrman argues, the Gospel of Thomas was probably composed by a Gnostic some time in the early 2nd century.\n\nN.T. Wright, former Anglican bishop and professor of New Testament history, also sees the dating of Thomas in the 2nd or 3rd century. Wright's reasoning for this dating is that the \"narrative framework\" of 1st-century Judaism and the New Testament is radically different from the worldview expressed in the sayings collected in the Gospel of Thomas. Thomas makes an anachronistic mistake by turning Jesus the Jewish prophet into a Hellenistic/Cynic philosopher. Wright concludes his section on the Gospel of Thomas in his book \"The New Testament and the People of God\" in this way: \"[Thomas'] implicit story has to do with a figure who imparts a secret, hidden wisdom to those close to him, so that they can perceive a new truth and be saved by it. 'The Thomas Christians are told the truth about their divine origins, and given the secret passwords that will prove effective in the return journey to their heavenly home.' This is, obviously, the non-historical story of Gnosticism... It is simply the case that, on good historical grounds, it is far more likely that the book represents a radical translation, and indeed subversion, of first-century Christianity into a quite different sort of religion, than that it represents the original of which the longer gospels are distortions... Thomas reflects a symbolic universe, and a worldview, which are radically different from those of the early Judaism and Christianity.\"\n\nThe harsh and widespread reaction to Marcion's canon, the first New Testament canon known to have been created, may demonstrate that, by 140 AD, it had become widely accepted that other texts formed parts of the records of the life and ministry of Jesus. Although arguments about some potential New Testament books, such as the \"Shepherd of Hermas\" and Book of Revelation, continued well into the 4th century, four canonical gospels, attributed to Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, were accepted among proto-orthodox Christians at least as early as the mid-2nd century. Tatian's widely used \"Diatessaron\", compiled between 160 and 175 AD, utilized the four gospels without any consideration of others. Irenaeus of Lyons wrote in the late 2nd century that \"since there are four quarters of the earth ... it is fitting that the church should have four pillars ... the four Gospels\" (\"Against Heresies\", 3.11.8), and then shortly thereafter made the first known quotation from a fourth gospel—the canonical version of the Gospel of John. The late 2nd-century Muratorian fragment also recognizes only the three synoptic gospels and John. Bible scholar Bruce Metzger wrote regarding the formation of the New Testament canon, \"Although the fringes of the emerging canon remained unsettled for generations, a high degree of unanimity concerning the greater part of the New Testament was attained among the very diverse and scattered congregations of believers not only throughout the Mediterranean world, but also over an area extending from Britain to Mesopotamia.\"\n\nThe question also arises as to various sects' usage of other works attributed to Thomas and their relation to this work. The Book of Thomas the Contender, also from Nag Hammadi, is foremost among these, but the extensive Acts of Thomas provides the mythological connections. The short and comparatively straightforward Apocalypse of Thomas has no immediate connection with the synoptic gospels, while the canonical Jude – if the name can be taken to refer to Judas Thomas Didymus – certainly attests to early intra-Christian conflict. The Infancy Gospel of Thomas, shorn of its mythological connections, is difficult to connect specifically to our gospel, but the Acts of Thomas contains the Hymn of the Pearl whose content is reflected in the Psalms of Thomas found in Manichaean literature. These psalms, which otherwise reveal Mandaean connections, also contain material overlapping the Gospel of Thomas.\n\nAs one of the earliest accounts of the teachings of Jesus, the \"Gospel of Thomas\" is regarded by some scholars as one of the most important texts in understanding early Christianity outside the New Testament. In terms of faith, however, no major Christian group accepts this gospel as canonical or authoritative. It is an important work for scholars working on the Q document, which itself is thought to be a collection of sayings or teachings upon which the gospels of Matthew and Luke are partly based. Although no copy of Q has ever been discovered, the fact that Thomas is similarly a 'sayings' Gospel is viewed by some scholars as an indication that the early Christians did write collections of the sayings of Jesus, bolstering the Q hypothesis.\n\nMost scholars do not consider Apostle Thomas the author of this document and the author remains unknown. J. Menard produced a summary of the academic consensus in the mid-1970s which stated that the gospel was probably a very late text written by a Gnostic author, thus having very little relevance to the study of the early development of Christianity. Scholarly views of Gnosticism and the Gospel of Thomas have since become more nuanced and diverse. Paterson Brown, for example, has argued forcefully that the three Coptic Gospels of Thomas, Philip and Truth are demonstrably not Gnostic writings, since all three explicitly affirm the basic reality and sanctity of incarnate life, which Gnosticism by definition considers illusory and evil.\n\nIn the 4th century Cyril of Jerusalem considered the author a disciple of Mani who was also called Thomas. Cyril stated:\n\nMany scholars consider the \"Gospel of Thomas\" to be a gnostic text, since it was found in a library among others, it contains Gnostic themes, and perhaps presupposes a Gnostic worldview. Others reject this interpretation, because \"Thomas\" lacks the full-blown mythology of Gnosticism as described by Irenaeus of Lyons (ca. 185), and because Gnostics frequently appropriated and used a large \"range of scripture from Genesis to the Psalms to Homer, from the Synoptics to John to the letters of Paul.\"\n\nSome modern scholars believe that the Gospel of Thomas was written independently of the canonical gospels, and therefore is a useful guide to historical Jesus research. Scholars may utilize one of several critical tools in biblical scholarship, the criterion of multiple attestation, to help build cases for historical reliability of the sayings of Jesus. By finding those sayings in the \"Gospel of Thomas\" that overlap with the Gospel of the Hebrews, Q, Mark, Matthew, Luke, John, and Paul, scholars feel such sayings represent \"multiple attestations\" and therefore are more likely to come from a historical Jesus than sayings that are only singly attested.\n\nThe material in the comparison chart is from \"Gospel Parallels\" by B. H. Throckmorton, \"The Five Gospels\" by R. W. Funk, \"The Gospel According to the Hebrews\" by E. B. Nicholson and \"The Hebrew Gospel and the Development of the Synoptic Tradition\" by J. R. Edwards.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "828919", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=828919", "title": "Henri Lefebvre", "text": "Henri Lefebvre\n\nHenri Lefebvre (; ; 16 June 1901 – 29 June 1991) was a French Marxist philosopher and sociologist, best known for pioneering the critique of everyday life, for introducing the concepts of the right to the city and the production of social space, and for his work on dialectics, alienation, and criticism of Stalinism, existentialism, and structuralism. In his prolific career, Lefebvre wrote more than sixty books and three hundred articles.\n\nLefebvre's book \"The Production of Space\" is the most requested book from the British Library's collection.\n\nLefebvre was born in Hagetmau, Landes, France. He studied philosophy at the University of Paris (the Sorbonne), graduating in 1920. By 1924 he was working with Paul Nizan, Norbert Guterman, Georges Friedmann, Georges Politzer and Pierre Morhange in the \"Philosophies\" group seeking a \"philosophical revolution\". This brought them into contact with the Surrealists, Dadaists, and other groups, before they moved towards the French Communist Party (PCF).\n\nLefebvre joined the PCF in 1928 and became one of the most prominent French Marxist Intellectuals during the second quarter of the 20th century, before joining the French resistance. From 1944 to 1949, he was the director of \"Radiodiffusion Française\", a French radio broadcaster in Toulouse. Among his works was a highly influential, anti-Stalinist, text on dialectics called \"Dialectical Materialism\" (1940). Seven years later, Lefebvre published his first volume of \"The Critique of Everyday Life\". His early work on method was applauded and borrowed centrally by Sartre in \"The Critique of Dialectical Reason\" (1960). During Lefebvre’s thirty-year stint with the PCF, he was chosen to publish critical attacks on opposed theorists, especially existentialists like Sartre and Lefebvre's former colleague Nizan, only to intentionally get himself expelled from the party for his own heterodox theoretical and political opinions in the late 1950s. Ironically, he then went from serving as a primary intellectual for the PCF to becoming one of France’s most important critics of the PCF’s politics (e.g. immediately, the lack of an opinion on Algeria, and more generally, the partial apologism for and continuation of Stalinism) and intellectual thought (i.e. Structuralism, especially the work of Louis Althusser).\n\nIn 1961, Lefebvre became professor of sociology at the University of Strasbourg, before joining the faculty at the new university at in 1965. He was one of the most respected professors, and he had influenced and analysed the May 1968 student revolt. Lefebvre introduced the concept of the right to the city in his 1968 book \"Le Droit à la ville\" (the publication of the book predates the May 1968 revolts which took place in many French cities). Following the publication of this book, Lefebvre wrote several influential works on cities, urbanism, and space, including \"The Production of Space\" (1974), which became one of the most influential and heavily cited works of urban theory. By the 1970s, Lefebvre had also published some of the first critical statements on the work of post-structuralists, especially Foucault. During the following years he was involved in the editorial group of \"Arguments\", a New Left magazine which largely served to enable the French public to familiarize themselves with Central European revisionism.\n\nLefebvre died in 1991. In his obituary, \"Radical Philosophy\" magazine honored his long and complex career and influence:\n\nOne of Lefebvre's most important contributions to social thought is the idea of the \"critique of everyday life,\" which he pioneered in the 1930s. Lefebvre defined everyday life dialectically as the intersection of \"illusion and truth, power and helplessness; the intersection of the sector man controls and the sector he does not control\", and is where the perpetually transformative conflict occurs between diverse, specific rhythms: the body’s polyrhythmic bundles of natural rhythms, physiological (natural) rhythms, and social rhythms (Lefebvre and Régulier, 1985: 73). The everyday was in short, the space in which all life occurred, and between which all fragmented activities took place. It was the residual. While the theme presented itself in many works, it was most notably outlined in his eponymous 3 volume study, which came out in individual installments, decades apart, in 1947, 1961, and 1981.\n\nLefebvre argued that everyday life was an underdeveloped sector compared to technology and production, and moreover that in the mid 20th century, capitalism changed such that everyday life was to be colonized—turned into a zone of sheer consumption. In this zone of everydayness (boredom) shared by everyone in society regardless of class or specialty, autocritique of everyday realities of boredom vs. societal promises of free time and leisure, could lead to people understanding and then revolutionizing their everyday lives. This was essential to Lefebvre because everyday life was where he saw capitalism surviving and reproducing itself. Without revolutionizing everyday life, capitalism would continue to diminish the quality of everyday life, and inhibit real self-expression. The critique of everyday life was crucial because it was for him only through the development of the conditions of human life—rather than abstract control of productive forces—that humans could reach a concrete utopian existence.\n\nLefebvre's work on everyday life was heavily influential in French theory, particularly for the Situationists, as well as in politics (e.g. for the May 1968 student revolts). The third volume has also recently influenced scholars writing about digital technology and information in the present day, since it has a section dealing with this topic at length, including analysis of the Nora-Minc Report () (1977); key aspects of information theory; and other general discussion of the 'colonisation' of everyday life through information communication technologies as 'devices' or 'services'.\n\nLefebvre dedicated a great deal of his philosophical writings to understanding the importance of (the production of) space in what he called the reproduction of social relations of production. This idea is the central argument in the book \"The Survival of Capitalism\", written as a sort of prelude to (1974) (\"The Production of Space\"). These works have deeply influenced current urban theory, mainly within human geography, as seen in the current work of authors such as David Harvey, Dolores Hayden, and Edward Soja, and in the contemporary discussions around the notion of spatial justice. Lefebvre is widely recognized as a Marxist thinker who was responsible for widening considerably the scope of Marxist theory, embracing everyday life and the contemporary meanings and implications of the ever-expanding reach of the urban in the western world throughout the 20th century. The generalization of industry, and its relation to cities (which is treated in ), \"The Right to the City\" and \"The Urban Revolution\" were all themes of Lefebvre's writings in the late 1960s, which was concerned, among other aspects, with the deep transformation of \"the city\" into \"the urban\" which culminated in its omni-presence (the \"complete urbanization of society\").\n\nLefebvre contends that there are different modes of production of space (i.e. spatialization) from natural space ('absolute space') to more complex spaces and flows whose meaning is produced in a social way (i.e. social space). Lefebvre analyses each historical mode as a three-part dialectic between everyday practices and perceptions (), representations or theories of space () and the spatial imaginary of the time ().\n\nLefebvre's argument in \"The Production of Space\" is that space is a social product, or a complex social construction (based on values, and the social production of meanings) which affects spatial practices and perceptions. This argument implies the shift of the research perspective from space to processes of its production; the embrace of the multiplicity of spaces that are socially produced and made productive in social practices; and the focus on the contradictory, conflictual, and, ultimately, political character of the processes of production of space. As a Marxist theorist (but highly critical of the economic structuralism that dominated the academic discourse in his period), Lefebvre argues that this social production of urban space is fundamental to the reproduction of society, hence of capitalism itself. The social production of space is commanded by a hegemonic class as a tool to reproduce its dominance (see Antonio Gramsci).\n\nLefebvre argued that every society—and, therefore, every mode of production—produces a certain space, its own space. The city of the ancient world cannot be understood as a simple agglomeration of people and things in space—it had its own spatial practice, making its own space (which was suitable for itself—Lefebvre argues that the intellectual climate of the city in the ancient world was very much related to the social production of its spatiality). Then if every society produces its own space, any \"social existence\" aspiring to be or declaring itself to be real, but not producing its own space, would be a strange entity, a very peculiar abstraction incapable of escaping the ideological or even cultural spheres. Based on this argument, Lefebvre criticized Soviet urban planners on the basis that they failed to produce a socialist space, having just reproduced the modernist model of urban design (interventions on physical space, which were insufficient to grasp social space) and applied it onto that context:\n\nIn his book \"The Urban Question\", Manuel Castells criticizes Lefebvre's Marxist Humanism and approach to the city influenced by Hegel and Nietzsche. Castells' political criticisms of Lefebvre's approach to Marxism echoed the Structuralist \"Scientific Marxism\" school of Louis Althusser of which Lefebvre was an immediate critic. Many responses to Castells are provided in \"The Survival of Capitalism\", and some may argue that the acceptance of those critiques in the academic world would be a motive for Lefebvre's effort in writing the long and theoretically dense \"The Production of Space\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

As such, samurai, for example, would typically, as a class, be considered devoid of \"iki\" (see \"yabo\"). At the same time, individual warriors are often depicted in contemporary popular imagination as embodying the \"iki\" ideals of a clear, stylish manner and blunt, unwavering directness. The term became widespread in modern intellectual circles through the book \"The Structure of Iki\" (1930) by Kuki Shūzō.\n\n\"Iki\", having emerged from the worldly Japanese merchant class, may appear in some ways a more contemporary expression of Japanese aesthetics than concepts such as \"wabi-sabi\". The term is commonly used in conversation and writing, but is not necessarily exclusive of other categories of beauty.\n\n\"Iki\" is an expression of simplicity, sophistication, spontaneity, and originality. It is ephemeral, romantic, straightforward, measured, audacious, smart, and lacking in detrimental self-consciousness.\n\n\"Iki\" is not overly refined, pretentious, complicated, showy, slick, coquettish, or, generally, cute. At the same time, \"iki\" may exhibit any of those traits in a smart, direct, and unabashed manner.\n\n\"Iki\" may signify a personal trait, or artificial phenomena exhibiting human will or consciousness. \"Iki\" is not used to describe natural phenomena, but may be expressed in human appreciation of natural beauty, or in the nature of human beings. Murakami Haruki (b. 1949), who writes in a clear, unflinching style—at turns sentimental, fantastic, and surreal—is described as embodying \"iki\". In contrast, Kawabata Yasunari (1899-1972) writes in a more poetic vein, with a closer focus on the interior \"complex\" of his characters, while situations and surroundings exhibit a kind of \"wabi-sabi\". That said, stylistic differences may tend to distract from a similar emotional subjectivity. Indeed, \"iki\" is strongly tied to stylistic tendencies.\n\nThe indefinite ideal of tsū (通) can be said to reference a highly cultivated but not necessarily solemn sensibility. The \"iki\"/\"tsu\" sensibility resists being construed within the context of overly specific rules about what could be considered as vulgar or uncouth.\n\n\"Iki\" and \"tsu\" are considered synonymous in some situations, but \"tsu\" exclusively refers to persons, while \"iki\" can also refer to situations/objects. In both ideals, the property of refinement is not academic in nature. \"Tsu\" sometimes involves excessive obsession and cultural (but not academic) pedantry, and in this case, it differs from \"iki\", which will not be obsessive. \"Tsu\" is used, for example, for knowing how to properly appreciate (eat) Japanese cuisines (sushi, tempura, soba etc.). \"Tsu\" (and some \"iki\"-style) can be transferred from person to person in form of \"tips.\" As \"tsu\" is more focused in knowledge, it may be considered superficial from \"iki\" point of view, since \"iki\" cannot be easily attained by learning.\n\n\"Yabo\" (野暮) is the antonym of \"iki\". \"Busui\" (無粋), literally \"non-\"iki\",\" is synonymous to \"yabo\".\n\nIn the Kamigata or Kansai area, the ideal of \"sui\" is prevalent. \"Sui\" is also represented by the kanji \"粋\". The sense of \"sui\" is similar to \"iki\" but not identical, reflecting various regional differences. The contexts of their usages are also different.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "38762347", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38762347", "title": "Integrational linguistics", "text": "Integrational linguistics\n\nIntegrational Linguistics (IL) is a general approach to linguistics that has been developed by the German linguist Hans-Heinrich Lieb and others since the late 1960s. The term \"Integrational Linguistics\" as a name for this approach has been used in publications since 1977 and antedates the use of the same term for integrationism, an unrelated approach developed by Roy Harris. Integrational Linguistics continues being developed by an open group of linguists from various countries.\n\nOver the past decades, IL has developed two major linguistic theories: (i) a general theory of language (the integrational theory of language) that covers both the systematic features of language systems and the phenomenon of language variability in a unified way, and (ii) a theory of grammars (the integrational theory of grammars), understood as part of a theory of linguistic descriptions. The separation of a theory of language from a theory of grammars is a major feature of IL by which it differs from approaches with a generative orientation. After an initial emphasis on the integrational theory of grammars till the mid-1970s, work in IL has been characterized by a steady and continuous refinement of the integrational theory of language based on empirical data from typologically diverse languages, avoiding basic revisions as they occurred in Chomskyan generative grammar.\n\nThe most comprehensive presentation of IL to date is Lieb (1983). This book contains both a theory of grammars and a general theory of language comprising a general morphology, morphosemantics, lexical semantics, syntax, and sentential semantics; a general phonology has been added by Lieb (1998, 1999, 2008). A shorter overview of the theory of language developed in IL may be found in Lieb (1992); for its syntactic part see, in particular, Lieb (1993). The general orientation of Integrational Linguistics places this approach within a 'New Structuralism' that combines careful attention to methodological soundness, emphasis on actual language description, and a cognitive outlook that leaves language structure outside the mind (Lieb 1992); at the same time, IL is closest among modern approaches to Western grammatical tradition.\n\nIntegrational Linguistics has its own multilingual website, \"The Homepage of Integrational Linguistics\", which contains, among other resources, a comprehensive \"Bibliography of Integrational Linguistics\" as well as information about linguists currently working within this approach.\n\nIL is not a theory but an \"approach\" within general linguistics, i.e. the branch of linguistics which studies all languages and aims at developing a general theory of language.\n\nAccordingly, IL has developed a comprehensive theoretical framework for the description of arbitrary languages. From its inception, this framework has been a non-generative and non-transformational, but rather declarative formal framework for studying all aspects of language and languages. IL provides an axiomatically formulated theory of language, which currently covers, in particular, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, and language variability.\n\nIL is a \"non-generative\" and \"non-transformational\" approach in linguistics: it assumes neither \"deep structures\" nor transformational relations between sequentially ordered structures. Rather, IL conceives linguistic entities as interrelated, \"multidimensional\" objects, which are typically modelled as set-theoretic constructs.\n\nIL is opposed to basic assumptions that characterize linguistic cognitivism in its 'non-intentionalist' varieties: the objects of linguistics are construed not as mental or neurophysiological mechanisms or corresponding 'representations,' but as natural languages conceived as abstract, extramental entities; a grammar of a language is an empirical theory (ideally, an empirical axiomatic theory) of that language, in a sense of 'theory' that requires sets of statements among the theory's components<ref name=\"Lieb 1974a/1976c\">Lieb, Hans-Heinrich. 1974/1976. \"Grammars as theories: the case for axiomatic grammar\". Part I: \"Theoretical Linguistics\" 1. 39–115. Part II: \"Theoretical Linguistics\" 3. 1–98.</ref> Hence, the traditional generative as well as the more recent cognitive conceptions of grammars as algorithms are rejected: from the very beginning, grammars were construed in IL not as algorithms but as 'declarative' theories (theories that make claims formulated as statements, and carefully keep apart a description from the entities described), a position that is currently being seriously considered also in other approaches. Natural languages are seen to arise from abstract, extramental objects (such as phonetic sounds). However, these objects are associated with concrete physical events (such as utterances of phonetic sound sequences) and are involved in the content of mental states or events that are connected with language use and knowledge. IL is thus compatible with a non-cognitivist, 'intentionalist' mentalism that may be proposed as typical of a 'New Structuralism' (Lieb 1992a, 1992b).\n\nGiven these characteristics, the common but rather constrained distinction between 'formalist,' 'functionalist,' and 'cognitivist' schools of linguistics does not apply to IL, which exhibits features of all three kinds of approaches. Major advantages of IL may be seen in (i) the fact that it was developed in view of the full spectrum of linguistic diversity from the outset, (ii) its integration of all levels of linguistic description (from phonetics to sentence semantics) within a unified theoretical framework, (iii) its inclusion of both system-based and non-system-based properties of languages, (iv) its development both of a theory of language and a theory of linguistic descriptions, and (v) the ontological explicitness and consistency of all its theories, making it a framework suitable for the description of individual languages as well as for contrastive linguistics, linguistic typology and universals research.\n\nIL adopts a positive and constructive attitude toward Western linguistic tradition and regards itself as a part of this tradition. In syntax and morphology, the Integrational Theory of Language centers around a formally explicit, consistent, and vastly enriched version of theoretical conceptions underlying actual grammar writing since antiquity, embedding them in a broader scientific context that comprises linguistics and its neighboring disciplines; and the Integrational Theory of Grammars applies modern means to account for the intricacies of actual descriptive work.\n\nIntegrational Linguistics strives for logical soundness even in informal descriptions and makes extensive use of naive set theory in formulating its theories in order to achieve explicitness and clarity.\n\nThe term 'integrational' is motivated by the following 'integrative' features of the approach as a whole:\n\nIntegrational Linguistics is an approach to linguistics that has arisen mainly from work done by Hans-Heinrich Lieb since roughly 1965. From its inception, Integrational Linguistics has been non-generative.\n\nLieb's early work, culminating in Lieb (1970), was directed towards that part of a theory of language that deals with language-internal variability, especially with variability in time. As such, it was opposed to the general orientation of linguistics in the sixties and early seventies where language variability was programmatically disregarded. The integrational treatment of language variability has later been continued, and to some extent completed, in Lieb (1993).\n\nThe 1970 framework for language variability did not include a theory of language systems. In 1972, Lieb began work on a general syntax as part of a theory of language systems. At the same time he was also working on a theory of grammars conceived as part of a theory of linguistic description not of a theory of language. In the Integrational Theory of Grammars, the traditional modern conception of grammars as algorithms was rejected in favour of a conception that has later become known as 'declarative grammar'. The integrational format of grammars construed as empirical axiomatic theories (Lieb 1974, 1976) is also characterized in Lieb (1983: Part G), and more briefly in Lieb (1989).\n\nIn 1972 Lieb founded a research group at the Freie Universität Berlin for further developing a general syntax as part of a theory of language. Under his direction, the group did work both on a general syntax and on the syntax of German from 1972 to 1982. Since 1992 there has again been a regular research colloquium at the Freie Universität Berlin working on problems of Integrational Linguistics.\n\nDifferently from other approaches, there have been no abrupt changes of direction in Integrational Linguistics. By now the theory of language developed in Integrational Linguistics has grown into an in-depth theory of all major aspects of language, and its application to a number of different and unrelated languages of the world is in progress.\n\nSo far, the following languages have been or are being studied from an integrational point of view: German, English, Latin, French, Russian, Polish, Chinese, Burmese, Yinchia, Guaraní, Aweti.\n\n\n"}

He is also known for his investigations on \"the relationships of Wave Function\" and \"Perception Function\", where Perception Function builds time Present, as Wave Function builds time Future.\n\nWhat marks him as distinguish scholar is a pioneer attempt for synthesis and unification of Psychology, Quantum Physics and Linguistics, presented as “Symmetry of psychological, physical and linguistic worlds”.\n\n“On the basis of his immensely broad investigations and his creative artistic experience he has proposed a synthesis of nearly all the ruling disciplines… Dr. Ge Moll may one day be a voice that is heard in America” (William Lovitt, professor of philosophy, California State University, Sacramento)\n\nHis proposal for hypothesis of “Objective Psyche of the Universe and Subjective Psyche of Man” where distinction between “Subjective Psyche, Subjective Physics and Objective Psyche” draw the new way of theorization and cogitative praxis of “Hearing the Essences” as “Concepts-phony” and build the new way of thought, sensibility and cognizing.\n\nHe is also known by his works on psychology, linguistic psychoanalysis, (“History of linguistic hypocrisy” 1992) quantum psychology, philosophy of quantum physics (“Libido Significandi, second volume, “Sign Quantum Continuum” 2005, 2009), theory of literature, brain research, and his broad spectrum of writings - poetry, dramaturgy, novels, essay and c.t.r.\n\nJohann Ge Moll is Plovdiv, Bulgaria-born psychiatrist, writer, philosopher, and violinist, a scientist with an encyclopedic scope of knowledge, and religious philosopher, more popular abroad than in Bulgaria.\n\nHe studies medicine in Sankt-Peterburg, Russia and Bulgaria and took his degree as doctor of Medicine in Medical Academy, Sofia. He works as psychiatrist and teaches History of Philosophy, Psychoanalysis, Philosophy of Music and creative Writing in Bulgarian and American universities.\n\nHe rises to popularity during the 1990s following the publication of his books The Revolt of the Mediocrities, A History of Linguistic Hypocrisy, Anti-Faust, Alchemy of Language, etc. He has published 21 poetry books and 12 plays. He has also written over 20,000 pages of tracts in ontology, logics, ethics, aesthetics, transcendental psychology, sociology, semiotics, hermeneutics.\n\nHe has created a theoretical model for a non-repressive civilisation, a model of the brain and the superconsciousness, a new interpretation of the quantum mathematics and cosmology, systems for automatic poetry and automatic stylistics, systems for meditation and heuristic-creative techniques, a hypothesis for the symmetrical-syntax correlative between the Universe and the Mind, a hypothesis for the ultramicroscopic universal objective psyche, world memory and quantum-mechanic collective inter-ego.\n\nHe has also founded a new philosophical movement – Omnisematicism, a new international youth intellectual movement for new logical and passionate revolution Omnirealism. He has set the foundations of a new science – Alphysics, he has developed a Non-Self-Identical Ontology, Nihilistic Physics, Permutative Hermeneutics.\n\nJohann Ge Moll’s theoretical work is dedicated to the search for the Great Synthesis between Science and Art, which negates Dilthey’s distinction between natural sciences and humanities. His basic philosophical concept is overcoming the \"human\" and its transcendenting through a mutating humanism towards a transhuman cosmic reason. This concept acquaints us with the incomprehensible harmony between the inhumanity of knowledge in man and the unreason of man in knowledge.\n\nThe philosopher preaches that Clarity, Authenticity, Incontrovertibility, Confidence, Conviction – those pillars of logics are attributes not of thought, but of fascination. They are the eyes not of a soberer, but of a hypnotic, which hope to find Truth under their features, but instead discover Beauty. In out blind hypnotic pursuance of human thought after Language and Sign we unmask its thirst for extonation and de-essentialization (assimilation of our essence in the Supreme). This is why it is time, he calls, to accuse Western Metaphysics' whole methodology of desire to Bewitch. This is why we no longer need to hide the fact that rationalism has always been merely a pretext for aestheticism.\n\nJ. Ge Moll defines “human” as a world theft of the Object’s self-knowledge. Subjectivity is born of this ontological theft’s constitution. This is why cognition is sin, because it is the world’s Mentality which man and evolution have appropriated. And the only way for man to redeem himself for this sin he has committed before the Universe and achieve salvation, is to restore the Intelligence he stole from the Substances through evolution, and to restore them to the Universe. The subjectivity, criminally stolen and appropriated by him\n\nAccording to Ge Moll man should also be tried with the crimes of the humanistic reduction, through which the Cosmic Reason and Sensitivity are reduced to human reason. Thus, the major prerequisite and condition for the mind to be elevated to the philosophy of the Thinking Substance, joyful energy and Intelligent Object is the requirement for overcoming Man and the human. Subjectivity, he teaches, which has separated (for the purposes of its narcissism) the Flower from the Thought, has a duty to restore the unity of the Thinking Flower. This statement of his has led his students to call his teaching The Philosophy of the Thinking Flower.\n\nThus, through antinomy,Ge Moll extricates the theory of the joyous energy and the worrisome form. This is why his teaching is called Joyous Insolubilionism. Via this “joyous insolubility” he defends the concept of a rational mysticism, which explains the world through the sacrament of cognition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1974 to 1989.\n\n\nStage performance of drama \"Anti-Faust\".

He has also received Dharma Transmission in the Sōtō tradition of Zen. Daizan Roshi is the founder of the Zenways Sangha and resident teacher at Yugagyo Dojo (Zen Yoga Camberwell) in London, United Kingdom.\n\nSkinner was born in Chatham, UK in 1963 and grew up in Kent. After graduation, he worked as a scientist in the pharmaceuticals industry. He began studying Sōtō Zen under Rev. Master Daishin Morgan at Throssel Hole Buddhist Abbey in Northumberland in northern England. Given permission to enter full-time monastic training as a postulant in 1989, he was ordained as an unsui or novice monk on 4 April 1991. Reflecting on his time at the monastery, Daizan wrote, \"For fourteen formative years I studied with him [Daishan Morgan], before continuing elsewhere with Rinzai Zen\".\n\nWithin Zen monastic society, the hierarchy is all-pervading and rigid. For the first seven years he lived in the zendo, the meditation hall, with three by six feet of space on the meditation platform and two cupboards, one for bedding and one for robes. Daizan Rōshi reflects: \"As junior monks, we were almost never alone. Every action 24 hours a day was expected to be obedient to instructions, undertaken mindfully and with consideration for others. The monastery is a pressured environment. The image used to exemplify it was the rock tumbler; the months and years of living cheek by jowl gradually smooth off all the rough corners so that each monk becomes a polished jewel.” He received dharma transmission on 21 December 1995.\n\nIn 2003, Daizan began training with Rinzai Zen Master Shinzan Miyamae Rōshi of Gyokuryuji Temple in Gifu, central Japan. The temple was the former hermitage of the outstanding Rinzai Zen reformer Bankei Yōtaku Zenji (1622–1693). Shinzan Rōshi, something of a maverick in the modern Zen world, intended the tiny temple to provide a basis of true Zen training outside the Rinzai mainstream which has become increasingly focused on providing high-price funerals. Daizan eventually became fukujushoku, vice-abbott, continued his study of zazen and zen yoga and studied the kōan curriculum of the Mino branch of the Inzan lineage of Rinzai Zen, completing it in 2007. On 8 May 2007 Daizan received inka from Shinzan Rōshi. He returned to the UK to begin teaching Zen.\n\nOn midsummer morning (21 June) 2007 Daizan Rōshi began a walk from the south tip of the Isle of Wight to the northern tip of Scotland. Wearing his monastic robes and kasa (hat) and carrying no money, Daizan Rōshi walked up the centre of the island of Britain finishing on Cape Wrath at the north of Scotland. The 777 mile walk took 64 days.\n\nOn 28 May 2011, he was installed as resident teacher at Yugagyo Dojo (Zen Yoga Camberwell) in London. The event was presided over by Shinzan Rōshi. He has served as a resident teacher at the Buddhist Society in London and is an appointed trainer with the College of Mindful Clinicians. He has been involved in Zen teaching at Oxford University and is particularly involved in the “Managing Your Mind” programme of postdoctoral study.\n\nIn March 2015 Daizan Rōshi, together with co-translator Sumiko Hayashi, published the book \"In Heaven's River: Poems and Carvings of Mountain-Monk Enku\", a tribute to the life and art of Enkū, the 17th century Japanese itinerant wonder-working mountain monk, sculptor, and poet. In July 2015, he published the book \"The Zen Character: Life, Art and Teachings of Zen Master Shinzan Miyamae\" to coincide with Shinzan Rōshi's 80th birthday and an exhibition of his calligraphy in London. In June 2017, Singing Dragon Press published Daizan's third book \"Practical Zen: Meditation and Beyond\".\n\n"}

{"id": "3056180", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3056180", "title": "Mandaeism", "text": "Mandaeism\n\nMandaeism or Mandaeanism ( ') is a gnostic religion with a strongly dualistic worldview. Its adherents, the Mandaeans, revere Adam, Abel, Seth, Enos, Noah, Shem, Aram, and especially John the Baptist. The Mandaeans are Semites and speak a dialect of Eastern Aramaic known as Mandaic. The name 'Mandaean' is said to come from the Aramaic \"manda\" meaning \"knowledge\", as does Greek \"gnosis\". Within the Middle East, but outside of their community, the Mandaeans are more commonly known as the ' (singular: ) or Sabians. The term ' is derived from the Aramaic root related to baptism, the neo-Mandaic is \".\" In Islam, the \"Sabians\" ( ') are described several times in the Qur'an as People of the Book, alongside Jews and Christians. Occasionally, Mandaeans are called \"Christians of Saint John\". \n\nAccording to most scholars, Mandaeaism originated sometime in the first three centuries AD, in either southwestern Mesopotamia or the Syro-Palestinian area. However, some scholars take the view that Mandaeanism is older and dates from pre-Christian times. \n\nThe religion has been practised primarily around the lower Karun, Euphrates and Tigris and the rivers that surround the Shatt-al-Arab waterway, part of southern Iraq and Khuzestan Province in Iran. There are thought to be between 60,000 and 70,000 Mandaeans worldwide. Until the 2003 Iraq war, almost all of them lived in Iraq. Many Mandaean Iraqis have since fled their country because of the turmoil created by the 2003 invasion of Iraq and subsequent occupation by U.S. armed forces, and the related rise in sectarian violence by Muslim extremists. By 2007, the population of Mandaeans in Iraq had fallen to approximately 5,000.\n\nThe Mandaeans have remained separate and intensely private. Reports of them and of their religion have come primarily from outsiders: particularly from Julius Heinrich Petermann, a scholar in Iranian studies, as well as from Nicolas Siouffi, a Syrian Christian who was the French vice-consul in Mosul in 1887, and British cultural anthropologist Lady E. S. Drower. There is an early if highly prejudiced account by the French traveller Jean-Baptiste Tavernier from the 1650s.\n\nThe term Mandaeism comes from Classical Mandaic \"Mandaiia\" and appears in Neo-Mandaic as \"Mandeyānā.\" On the basis of cognates in other Aramaic dialects, Semiticists such as Mark Lidzbarski and Rudolf Macuch have translated the term \"manda\", from which \"Mandaiia\" derives, as \"knowledge\" (cf. \"mandaʻ\" in Dan. 2:21, 4:31, 33, 5:12; cf. \"maddaʻ\", with characteristic assimilation of /n/ to the following consonant, medial -nd- hence becoming -dd-). This etymology suggests that the Mandaeans may well be the only sect surviving from Late Antiquity to identify themselves explicitly as Gnostics.\n\nOther scholars derive the term \"mandaiia\" from \"Mandā d-Heyyi\" (Mandaic \"manda ḏ-hiia\" \"Knowledge of Life,\" in reference to the chief divinity \"hiia rbia\" \"the Great Life\") or from the word \"(bi)mandi\", which is the cultic hut in which many Mandaean ceremonies are performed (such as the baptism, which is the central sacrament of Mandaean religious life). This last term is possibly to be derived from Pahlavi \"m’nd\" \"mānd\" (\"house\").\n\nAccording to the Mandaean text the Haran Gawaita, the recorded history of the Mandaeans began when a group called the Nasoreans (the Mandaean priestly caste as opposed to the laity), left Palestine and migrated to Mesopotamia in the 1st century AD. The reason given for this was their persecution by the community in Jerusalem in the course of which the city was destroyed as a punishment. The emigrants went first to Haran (probably Harran in modern day Turkey), and then the Median hills in Iran, before finally settling in the southern provinces of Mesopotamia (modern day Iraq). \n\nAt the beginning of the Muslim conquest of Mesopotamia, the leader of the Mandaeans, Anush son of Danqa appeared before Muslim authorities showing them a copy of the Ginza Rabba, the Mandaean holy book, and proclaiming the chief Mandaean prophet to be John the Baptist, who is also mentioned in the Quran. This identified Mandaeans with the Sabians who are mentioned in the Quran as being counted among the \"Ahl al-Kitāb\" (People of the Book). This provided Mandaeans a status as a legal minority religion within the Muslim Empire. The Mandaeans were henceforth associated with the Sabians and the Jewish Christian group the Elcesaites, on account of the location of all three in Mesopotamia in the early centuries AD, and the similarities in their beliefs. The importance of baptism in the rituals of all three is particularly marked. Like the Mandaeans, the Sabians were also said to be gnostics and descended from Noah. Mandaeans continue to be identified with Sabians up to the present day, but the exact relationship between the three groups however, remains unclear. \n\nAround 1290, a learned Dominican Catholic from Tuscany, Ricoldo da Montecroce, or Ricoldo Pennini, was in Mesopotamia where he met the Mandaeans. He described them as follows:\n\nMandaeans were called \"Christians of Saint John\" by members of the Discalced Carmelite mission in Basra during the 16th century, based upon their preliminary reports. Some Portuguese Jesuits had also met some \"Saint John Christians\" around the Strait of Hormuz in 1559, when the Portuguese fleet fought with the Ottoman Turkish army in Bahrain. These Mandaean seemed to be willing to obey the Catholic Church. They learned and used the seven Catholic sacraments and the related ceremonies in their lives.\n\nMandaeism, as the religion of the Mandaean people, is based more on a common heritage than on any set of religious creeds and doctrines. A basic guide to Mandaean theology does not exist. The corpus of Mandaean literature, though quite large, covers topics such as eschatology, the knowledge of God and the afterlife—in an unsystematic manner. Moreover, it is known only to the priesthood and a few laypeople.\n\nAccording to E. S. Drower, the Mandaean Gnosis is characterized by nine features, which appear in various forms in other gnostic sects:\n\nAs noted above Mandaean theology is not systematic. There is no one single authoritative account of the creation of the cosmos, but rather a series of several accounts. Some scholars, such as Edmondo Lupieri, maintain that comparison of these different accounts may reveal the diverse religious influences upon which the Mandaeans have drawn and the ways in which the Mandaean religion has evolved over time.\n\nIn contrast with the religious texts of the western Gnostic sects formerly found in Syria and Egypt, the earliest Mandaean religious texts suggest a more strictly dualistic theology, typical of other Iranian religions such as Zoroastrianism, Zurvanism, Manichaeism, and the teachings of Mazdak. In these texts, instead of a large pleroma, there is a discrete division between \"light\" and \"darkness.\" The ruler of darkness is called Ptahil (similar to the Gnostic Demiurge), and the originator of the light (i.e. God) is only known as \"the great first Life from the worlds of light, the sublime one that stands above all works.\" When this being emanated, other spiritual beings became increasingly corrupted, and they and their ruler Ptahil created our world. The name Ptahil is suggestive of the Egyptian Ptah—the Mandaeans believe that they were resident in Egypt for a while—joined to the semitic El, meaning \"god\".\n\nThe issue is further complicated by the fact that Ptahil alone does not constitute the demiurge but only fills that role insofar as he is the creator of our world. Rather, Ptahil is the lowest of a group of three \"demiurgic\" beings, the other two being Yushamin (a.k.a. Joshamin) and Abathur. Abathur's demiurgic role consists of his sitting in judgment upon the souls of mortals. The role of Yushamin, the senior being, is more obscure; wanting to create a world of his own, he was severely punished for opposing the King of Light. The name may derive from Iao \"haš-šammayim\" (in Hebrew: Yahweh \"of the heavens\").\n\nWhile Mandaeans agree with other gnostic sects that the world is a prison governed by the planetary archons, they do not view it as a cruel and inhospitable one.\n\nMandaeans recognize several prophets. Yahya ibn Zakariyya, known to Christians as John the Baptist, is accorded a special status, higher than his role in Christianity and Islam. Mandaeans do not consider John to be the founder of their religion but revere him as one of their greatest teachers, tracing their beliefs back to Adam.\n\nMandaeans maintain that Jesus was a \"mšiha kdaba\" \"false messiah\" who perverted the teachings entrusted to him by John. The Mandaic word \"k(a)daba\", however, might be interpreted as being derived from either of two roots: the first root, meaning \"to lie\", is the one traditionally ascribed to Jesus; the second, meaning \"to write\", might provide a second meaning, that of \"book\"; hence some Mandaeans, motivated perhaps by an ecumenical spirit, maintain that Jesus was not a \"lying Messiah\" but a \"book Messiah\", the \"book\" in question presumably being the Christian Gospels. This seems to be a folk etymology without support in the Mandaean texts.\n\nLikewise, the Mandaeans believe that Abraham and Moses were false prophets, but recognize other prophetic figures from the Abrahamic religions, such as Adam and his grandson Anuš (Enos), as well as Nuh (Noah), his son Sam (Shem) and his son Ram (Aram). The latter three they consider to be their direct ancestors.\n\nMandaeans consider the Holy Spirit in the Talmud and Bible, which is known in Mandaic as the \"Ruha d-Qudsha\", to be an evil being.\n\nThe Mandaeans have a large corpus of religious scriptures, the most important of which is the \"Ginza Rba\" or Ginza, a collection of history, theology, and prayers. The \"Ginza Rba\" is divided into two halves—the \"Genzā Smālā\" or \"Left Ginza\", and the \"Genzā Yeminā\" or \"Right Ginza\". By consulting the colophons in the Left Ginza, Jorunn J. Buckley has identified an uninterrupted chain of copyists to the late second or early third century. The colophons attest to the existence of the Mandaeans or their predecessors during the late Parthian Empire at the very latest.\n\nThe oldest texts are lead amulets from about the third century AD, followed by magic bowls from about AD 600. The important religious manuscripts are not older than the sixteenth century, with most coming from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.\n\nAlthough the \"Ginza\" continued to evolve under the rule of the Sasanian Empire and the Islamic caliphates, few textual traditions can lay claim to such extensive continuity.\n\nAnother important text is the \"Haran Gawaita\" which tells the history of the Mandaeans. According to this text, a group of Nasoreans (Mandean priests) left Judea after the destruction of Jerusalem in the first century CE, and settled within the Parthian Empire. \n\nOther important books include the \"Qolusta\", the canonical prayerbook of the Mandaeans, which was translated by E. S. Drower. One of the chief works of Mandaean scripture, accessible to laymen and initiates alike, is the \"Mandaean Book of John\" (), which includes a dialogue between John and Jesus. In addition to the \"Ginza\", \"Qolusta\", and \"Draša\", there is the \"Dīvān\", which contains a description of the 'regions' the soul ascends through, and the \"Asfar Malwāshē\", the \"Book of the Zodiacal Constellations\". Finally, there are some pre-Muslim artifacts that contain Mandaean writings and inscriptions, such as some Aramaic incantation bowls.\n\nThe language in which the Mandaean religious literature was originally composed is known as Mandaic, and is a member of the Aramaic family of dialects. It is written in a cursive variant of the Parthian chancellory script. Many Mandaean lay people do not speak this language, though some members of the Mandaean community resident in Iran and Iraq continue to speak Neo-Mandaic, a modern version of this language.\n\nThe two most important ceremonies in Mandaean worship are baptism (masbuta), and a mass for the dead or 'ascent of the soul ceremony' (masiqta). Unlike other religions, baptism is not a one-off event but is performed every Sunday, the Mandaean holy day. Baptism usually involves full immersion in flowing water, and all rivers considered fit for baptism are called Yardana (after the River Jordan). After emerging from the water, the worshipper is anointed with holy oil and partakes of a communion of bread and water. The ascent of the soul ceremony can take various forms, but usually involves a ritual meal in memory of the dead. The ceremony is believed to help the souls of the departed on their journey through purgatory to the World of Light.\n\nA ' () is a place of worship for followers of Mandaeism. A ' must be built beside a river in order to perform maṣbuta (or baptism) because water is an essential element in the Mandaeic faith. Modern \"\"s sometimes have a bath inside a building instead. Each mandi is adorned with a \"darfash\", which is a cross of olive wood half covered with a piece of white pure silk cloth. The cross bears no relation to the Christian cross. Instead the four arms of the cross symbolise the four corners of the universe, while the pure silk cloth represents the Light of God.\n\nMandaeans believe in marriage and procreation, and in the importance of leading an ethical and moral lifestyle in this world. They also place a high priority upon family life. Consequently, Mandaeans do not practice celibacy or asceticism. Mandaeans will, however, abstain from strong drink and red meat.\n\nThere is a strict division between Mandaean laity and the priests. According to E.S. Drower (\"The Secret Adam\", p. ix):\n\nThere are three grades of priesthood in Mandaeism: the \"tarmidia\" \"disciples\" (Neo-Mandaic \"tarmidānā\"), the \"ganzibria\" \"treasurers\" (from Old Persian \"ganza-bara\" \"id.,\" Neo-Mandaic \"ganzeḇrānā\") and the \"rišamma\" \"leader of the people\". This last office, the highest level of the Mandaean priesthood, has lain vacant for many years. At the moment, the highest office currently occupied is that of the \"ganzeḇrā\", a title which appears first in a religious context in the Aramaic ritual texts from Persepolis (c. 3rd century BCE) and which may be related to the \"kamnaskires\" (Elamite <qa-ap-nu-iš-ki-ra> \"kapnuskir\" \"treasurer\"), title of the rulers of Elymais (modern Khuzestan) during the Hellenistic age. Traditionally, any \"ganzeḇrā\" who baptizes seven or more \"ganzeḇrānā\" may qualify for the office of \"rišamma\", though the Mandaean community has yet to rally as a whole behind any single candidate.\n\nThe contemporary priesthood can trace its immediate origins to the first half of the 19th century. In 1831, an outbreak of cholera devastated the region and eliminated most if not all of the Mandaean religious authorities. Two of the surviving acolytes (\"šgandia\"), Yahia Bihram and Ram Zihrun, reestablished the priesthood on the basis of their own training and the texts that were available to them.\n\nIn 2009, there were two dozen Mandaean priests in the world, according to the Associated Press.\n\nThe Mandaeans have been identified with several groups, in particular the Sabians and the Elkasaites. Other groups such as the Nazerences and the Dositheans have also been identified with the Mandaeans. The exact relation of all these groups to one another is a difficult question. While it seems certain that a number of distinct groups are intended by these names, the nature of these sects and the connections between them are less than clear. At least according to the \"Fihrist\" (see below), these groups seem all to have emerged from or developed in parallel with the \"Sabian\" followers of \"El-Hasaih\"; \"Elkasaites\" in particular may simply have been a blanket term for Mughtasila, Mandaeans, the original Sabians and even Manichaeans.\n\nThe Quran makes several references to the Sabians, who are frequently thought to be Mandaeans. Sabians are counted among the \"Ahl al-Kitāb\" (People of the Book), and several hadith feature them. Arab sources of early Qur'anic times (7th century) also make some references to Sabians. Some scholars hold that the etymology of the root word 'Sabi'un' points to origins either in the Syriac or Mandaic word 'Sabian', and suggest that the Mandaean religion originated with Sabeans who came under the influence of early Hellenic Sabian missionaries, but preferred their own priesthood. The Sabians believed they \"belong to the prophet Noah\"; Similarly, the Mandaeans claim direct descent from Noah.\n\nEarly in the 9th century, a group of Hermeticists in the northern Mesopotamian city of Harran declared themselves Sabians when facing persecution; an Assyrian Christian writer said that the true 'Sabians' or Sabba lived in the marshes of lower Iraq. The Assyrian writer Theodore Bar Konai (in the Scholion, 792) described a \"sect\" of \"Sabians\", who were located in southern Mesopotamia. \n\nAl-Biruni (writing at the beginning of the 11th century) said that the 'real Sabians' were \"the remnants of the Jewish tribes who remained in Babylonia when the other tribes left it for Jerusalem in the days of Cyrus and Artaxerxes. These remaining tribes ... adopted a system mixed-up of Magism and Judaism.\"\n\nThe Elkesaites were a Judeo-Christian baptismal sect which seem to have been related, and possibly ancestral, to the Mandaeans (see Sabians). The members of this sect, like the Mandaeans, wore white and performed baptisms. They dwelt in east Judea and Assyria, whence the Mandaeans claim to have migrated to southern Mesopotamia, according to the \"Harran Gawaiṯā\" legend. In the \"Fihrist\" (\"Book of Nations\") of Arabic scholar Al-Nadim (c. 987), the \"Mogtasilah\" (\"Mughtasila\", \"self-ablutionists\") are counted among the followers of \"El-Hasaih\" or Elkesaites. \"Mogtasilah\" may thus have been Al-Nadim's term for the Mandaeans, as the few details on rituals and habit are similar to Mandaeans ones. The Elkesaites seem to have prospered for a while, but ultimately splintered. They may have originated in a schism where they renounced the Torah, while the mainstream Sampsaeans held on to it (as Elchasai's followers did)—if so, this must have happened around the mid-late 1st millennium CE. However, it is not clear exactly which group he referred to, for by then the Elkesaite sects may have been at their most diverse. Some disappeared subsequently; for example, the Sampsaeans are not well attested in later sources. The \"Ginza Rba\", one of the chief holy scriptures of the Mandaeans, appears to originate around the time of Elchasai or somewhat thereafter.\n\nAccording to the \"Fihrist\" of ibn al-Nadim, the Mesopotamian prophet Mani, the founder of Manichaeism, was brought up within the Elkesaite (\"Elcesaite\" or \"Elchasaite\") sect, this being confirmed more recently by the Cologne Mani Codex. Unfortunately, none of the Manichaean scriptures has survived in its entirety, and it seems that the remaining fragments have not been compared to the \"Ginza Rba\". Mani later left the Elkasaites to found his own religion. In a comparative analysis, Mandaean scholar Säve-Söderberg indicated that Mani's \"Psalms of Thomas\" were closely related to Mandaean texts. This would imply that Mani had access to Mandaean religious literature, or that both derived from the same source.\n\nThe Haran Gawaita uses the name Nasoreans for the Mandaeans arriving from Jerusalem. Consequently, the Mandaeans have been connected with the 4th-century Nazarenes described by Epiphanius. Epiphanius says (29:6) that they existed before Christ. That is questioned by some, but others accept the pre-Christian origin of this group.\n\nThey are connected with the Samaritan group the Dositheans by Theodore Bar Kōnī in his \"Scholion\".\n\nOfficial numbers estimate that the current population of Mandaeans numbers between 60,000 and 70,000 people. Their proportion in their native lands has collapsed because of the Iraq War, with most of the community relocating to nearby Iran, Syria, and Jordan.\n\nIn 2011, Al Arabiya put the number of hidden and unaccounted for Iranian Mandaeans in Iran as high as 60,000.\n\nOf the Mandaeans tallied in official numbers, many have formed diaspora communities outside the Middle East, especially Australia, where some 10,000 now reside, mainly around Sydney, representing 15% of the total world Mandaean population. \n\nAccording to a 2009 article in \"The Holland Sentinel\", the Mandaean community in Iran has also been dwindling, numbering between 5,000 and at most 10,000 people.\n\nApproximately 1,000 Iranian Mandaeans have emigrated to the United States since the US State Department in 2002 granted them protective refugee status, which was also later accorded to Iraqi Mandaeans in 2007.\n\nA community estimated at 2,500 members live in Worcester, Massachusetts, where they began settling in 2008. Most emigrated from Iraq.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "46636", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46636", "title": "Maoism", "text": "Maoism\n\nMaoism, known in China as Mao Zedong Thought (), is a communist political theory derived from the teachings of the Chinese political leader Mao Zedong, whose followers are known as Maoists. Developed from the 1950s until the Deng Xiaoping reforms in the 1970s, it was widely applied as the guiding political and military ideology of the Communist Party of China and as theory guiding revolutionary movements around the world. A key difference between Maoism and other forms of Marxist-Leninism is that Mao said that peasants should be the bulwark of the revolutionary energy, led by the working class in China.\n\nThe modern Chinese intellectual tradition of the turn of the twentieth century is defined by two central concepts: iconoclasm and nationalism.\n\nBy the turn of the 20th century, a proportionately small yet socially significant cross-section of China's traditional elite (i.e. landlords and bureaucrats) found themselves increasingly skeptical of the efficacy and even the moral validity of Confucianism. These skeptical iconoclasts formed a new segment of Chinese society, a modern intelligentsia whose arrival—or as historian of China Maurice Meisner would label it, their defection—heralded the beginning of the destruction of the gentry as a social class in China.\n\nThe fall of the last imperial Chinese dynasty in 1911 marked the final failure of the Confucian moral order and it did much to make Confucianism synonymous with political and social conservatism in the minds of Chinese intellectuals. It was this association of conservatism and Confucianism which lent to the iconoclastic nature of Chinese intellectual thought during the first decades of the 20th century.\n\nChinese iconoclasm was expressed most clearly and vociferously by Chen Duxiu during the New Culture Movement which occurred between 1915 and 1919. Proposing the \"total destruction of the traditions and values of the past\", the New Culture Movement was spearheaded by the \"New Youth\", a periodical which was published by Chen Duxiu and was profoundly influential on the young Mao Zedong, whose first published work appeared on the magazine's pages.\n\nAlong with iconoclasm, radical anti-imperialism dominated the Chinese intellectual tradition and slowly evolved into a fierce nationalist fervor which influenced Mao's philosophy immensely and was crucial in adapting Marxism to the Chinese model. Vital to understanding Chinese nationalist sentiments of the time is the Treaty of Versailles, which was signed in 1919. The Treaty aroused a wave of bitter nationalist resentment in Chinese intellectuals as lands formerly ceded to Germany in Shandong were—without consultation with the Chinese—transferred to Japanese control rather than returned to Chinese sovereignty.\n\nThe negative reaction culminated in the 4 May Incident which occurred on that day in 1919. The protest began with 3,000 students in Beijing displaying their anger at the announcement of the Versailles Treaty's concessions to Japan, yet rapidly took a violent turn as protesters began attacking the homes and offices of ministers who were seen as cooperating with, or in the direct pay of the Japanese. The 4 May Incident and Movement which followed \"catalyzed the political awakening of a society which had long seemed inert and dormant\".\n\nYet another international event would have a large impact not only on Mao, but also on the Chinese intelligentsia: the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917. Although the revolution did elicit interest among Chinese intellectuals, socialist revolution in China was not considered a viable option until after the May 4 Incident. Afterwards, \"[t]o become a Marxist was one way for a Chinese intellectual to reject both the traditions of the Chinese past and Western domination of the Chinese present\".\n\nDuring the period immediately following the Long March, Mao and the Communist Party of China (CPC) were headquartered in Yan'an, which is a prefecture-level city in Shaanxi province. During this period, Mao clearly established himself as a Marxist theoretician and he produced the bulk of the works which would later be canonized into the \"thought of Mao Zedong\". The rudimentary philosophical base of Chinese Communist ideology is laid down in Mao's numerous dialectical treatises and it was conveyed to newly recruited party members. This period truly established ideological independence from Moscow for Mao and the CPC.\n\nAlthough the Yan'an period did answer some of the questions, both ideological and theoretical, which were raised by the Chinese Communist Revolution, it left many of the crucial questions unresolved; including how the Communist Party of China was supposed to launch a socialist revolution while completely separated from the urban sphere.\n\nMao's Intellectual Marxist development can be divided into five major periods: (1) The Initial Marxist Period from 1920–1926; (2) the formative Maoist period from 1927–1935; (3) the mature Maoist period from 1935–1940; (4) the civil war period from 1940–1949; and (5) the post-1949 period, following the revolutionary victory.\n\nThe theory of the New Democracy was known to the Chinese revolutionaries from the late 1940s. This thesis held that for the majority of the people of the planet, the long road to socialism could only be opened by a \"national, popular, democratic, anti-feudal and anti-imperialist revolution, run by the communists\".\n\nHolding that \"political power grows out of the barrel of a gun\", Maoism emphasizes the \"revolutionary struggle of the vast majority of people against the exploiting classes and their state structures\", which Mao termed a \"people's war\". Mobilizing large parts of rural populations to revolt against established institutions by engaging in guerrilla warfare, Maoist Thought focuses on \"surrounding the cities from the countryside\".\n\nMaoism views the industrial-rural divide as a major division exploited by capitalism, identifying capitalism as involving industrial urban developed First World societies ruling over rural developing Third World societies. Maoism identifies peasant insurgencies in particular national contexts were part of a context of world revolution, in which Maoism views the global countryside would overwhelm the global cities. Due to this imperialism by the capitalist urban First World towards the rural Third World, Maoism has endorsed national liberation movements in the Third World.\n\nContrary to the Leninist vanguard model employed by the Bolsheviks, the theory of the mass line holds that party must not be separate from the popular masses, either in policy or in revolutionary struggle. To conduct a successful revolution the needs and demands of the masses must be the most important issues.\n\nThe theory of the Cultural Revolution states that the proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat does not wipe out bourgeois ideology—the class-struggle continues and even intensifies during socialism, therefore a constant struggle against these ideologies and their social roots must be conducted. Cultural Revolution is directed also against traditionalism.\n\nMao drew from the writings of Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin in elaborating his theory. Philosophically, his most important reflections emerge on the concept of \"contradiction\" (\"maodun\"). In two major essays, \"On Contradiction\" and \"On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People\", he adopts the positivist-empiricist idea (shared by Engels) that contradiction is present in matter itself and thus also in the ideas of the brain. Matter always develops through a dialectical contradiction: \"The interdependence of the contradictory aspects present in all things and the struggle between these aspects determine the life of things and push their development forward. There is nothing that does not contain contradiction; without contradiction nothing would exist\".\n\nFurthermore, each contradiction (including class struggle, the contradiction holding between relations of production and the concrete development of forces of production) expresses itself in a series of other contradictions, some dominant, others not. \"There are many contradictions in the process of development of a complex thing, and one of them is necessarily the principal contradiction whose existence and development determine or influence the existence and development of the other contradictions\".\n\nThus the principal contradiction should be tackled with priority when trying to make the basic contradiction \"solidify\". Mao elaborates further on this theme in the essay \"On Practice\", \"on the relation between knowledge and practice, between knowing and doing\". Here, \"Practice\" connects \"contradiction\" with \"class struggle\" in the following way: Inside a mode of production, there are three realms where practice functions: economic production, scientific experimentation (which also takes place in economic production and should not be radically disconnected from the former) and finally class struggle. These may be considered the proper objects of economy, scientific knowledge and politics.\n\nThese three spheres deal with matter in its various forms, socially mediated. As a result, they are the only realms where knowledge may arise (since truth and knowledge only make sense in relation to matter, according to Marxist epistemology). Mao emphasizes—like Marx in trying to confront the \"bourgeois idealism\" of his time—that knowledge must be based on empirical evidence.\n\nKnowledge results from hypotheses verified in the contrast with a real object; this real object, despite being mediated by the subject's theoretical frame, retains its materiality and will offer resistance to those ideas that do not conform to its truth. Thus in each of these realms (economic, scientific and political practice), contradictions (principle and secondary) must be identified, explored and put to function to achieve the communist goal. This involves the need to know, \"scientifically\", how the masses produce (how they live, think and work), to obtain knowledge of how class struggle (the main contradiction that articulates a mode of production, in its various realms) expresses itself.\n\nMao held that contradictions were the most important feature of society and since society is dominated by a wide range of contradictions, this calls for a wide range of varying strategies. Revolution is necessary to fully resolve antagonistic contradictions such as those between labour and capital. Contradictions arising within the revolutionary movement call for ideological correction to prevent them from becoming antagonistic.\n\nThree Worlds Theory states that during the Cold War two imperialist states formed the \"first world\"—the United States and the Soviet Union. The second world consisted of the other imperialist states in their spheres of influence. The third world consisted of the non-imperialist countries. Both the first and the second world exploit the third world, but the first world is the most aggressive party. The workers in the first and second world are \"bought up\" by imperialism, preventing socialist revolution. On the other hand, the people of the third world have not even a short-sighted interest in the prevailing circumstances, hence revolution is most likely to appear in third world countries, which again will weaken imperialism opening up for revolutions in other countries too.\n\nMaoism departs from conventional European-inspired Marxism in that its focus is on the agrarian countryside, rather than the industrial urban forces—this is known as agrarian socialism. Notably, Maoist parties in Peru, Nepal and the Philippines have adopted equal stresses on urban and rural areas, depending on the country's focus of economic activity. Maoism broke with the state capitalist framework of the Soviet Union under Nikita Khrushchev, dismissing it as revisionist, a pejorative term among communists referring to those who fight for capitalism in the name of socialism and who depart from historical and dialectical materialism.\n\nAlthough Maoism is critical of urban industrial capitalist powers, it views urban industrialization as a prerequisite to expand economic development and socialist reorganization to the countryside, with the goal being the achievement of rural industrialization that would abolish the distinction between town and countryside.\n\nIn its post-revolutionary period, Mao Zedong Thought is defined in the CPC's Constitution as \"Marxism–Leninism applied in a Chinese context\", synthesized by Mao and China's \"first-generation leaders\". It asserts that class struggle continues even if the proletariat has already overthrown the bourgeoisie and there are capitalist restorationist elements within the Communist Party itself. Maoism provided the CPC's first comprehensive theoretical guideline with regards to how to continue socialist revolution, the creation of a socialist society, socialist military construction and highlights various contradictions in society to be addressed by what is termed \"socialist construction\". While it continues to be lauded to be the major force that defeated \"imperialism and feudalism\" and created a \"New China\" by the Communist Party of China, the ideology survives only in name on the Communist Party's Constitution as Deng Xiaoping abolished most Maoist practices in 1978, advancing a guiding ideology called \"socialism with Chinese characteristics\".\n\nShortly after Mao's death in 1976, Deng Xiaoping initiated socialist market reforms in 1978, thereby beginning the radical change in Mao's ideology in the People's Republic of China (PRC). Although Mao Zedong Thought nominally remains the state ideology, Deng's admonition to \"seek truth from facts\" means that state policies are judged on their practical consequences and in many areas the role of ideology in determining policy has thus been considerably reduced. Deng also separated Mao from Maoism, making it clear that Mao was fallible and hence the truth of Maoism comes from observing social consequences rather than by using Mao's quotations as holy writ, as was done in Mao's lifetime.\n\nContemporary Maoists in China criticize the social inequalities created by the revisionist Communist Party. Some Maoists say that Deng's \"Reform and Opening\" economic policies that introduced market principles spelled the end of Maoism in China, although Deng himself asserted that his reforms were upholding Mao Zedong Thought in accelerating the output of the country's productive forces.\n\nIn addition, the party constitution has been rewritten to give the socialist ideas of Deng prominence over those of Mao. One consequence of this is that groups outside China which describe themselves as Maoist generally regard China as having repudiated Maoism and restoring capitalism and there is a wide perception both inside and outside China that China has abandoned Maoism. However, while it is now permissible to question particular actions of Mao and talk about excesses taken in the name of Maoism, there is a prohibition in China on either publicly questioning the validity of Maoism or on questioning whether the current actions of the CPC are \"Maoist\".\n\nAlthough Mao Zedong Thought is still listed as one of the four cardinal principles of the People's Republic of China, its historical role has been re-assessed. The Communist Party now says that Maoism was necessary to break China free from its feudal past, but it also says that the actions of Mao are seen to have led to excesses during the Cultural Revolution.\n\nThe official view is that China has now reached an economic and political stage, known as the primary stage of socialism, in which China faces new and different problems completely unforeseen by Mao and as such the solutions that Mao advocated are no longer relevant to China's current conditions. The official proclamation of the new CPC stance came in June 1981, when the Sixth Plenum of the Eleventh National Party Congress Central Committee took place. The 35,000-word \"Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party Since the Founding of the People's Republic of China\" reads: Chief responsibility for the grave 'Left' error of the 'cultural revolution,' an error comprehensive in magnitude and protracted in duration, does indeed lie with Comrade Mao Zedong... [and] far from making a correct analysis of many problems, he confused right and wrong and the people with the enemy... herein lies his tragedy.\n\nScholars outside China see this re-working of the definition of Maoism as providing an ideological justification for what they see as the restoration of the essentials of capitalism in China by Deng and his successors, who sought to \"eradicate all ideological and physiological obstacles to economic reform\". In 1978, this led to the Sino-Albanian split when Albanian leader Enver Hoxha denounced Deng as a revisionist and formed Hoxhaism as an anti-revisionist form of Marxism.\nMao himself is officially regarded by the CPC as a \"great revolutionary leader\" for his role in fighting against the Japanese fascist invasion during the Second World War and creating the People's Republic of China, but Maoism as implemented between 1959 and 1976 is regarded by today's CPC as an economic and political disaster. In Deng's day, support of radical Maoism was regarded as a form of \"left deviationism\" and being based on a cult of personality, although these \"errors\" are officially attributed to the Gang of Four rather than being attributed to Mao himself. Thousands of Maoists were arrested in the Hua Guofeng period after 1976. The prominent Maoists Zhang Chunqiao and Jiang Qing were sentenced to death with a two-year-reprieve while some others were sentenced to life imprisonment or imprisonment for 15 years.\n\nAfter the death of Mao in 1976 and the resulting power-struggles in China that followed, the international Maoist movement was divided into three camps. One group, composed of various ideologically nonaligned groups, gave weak support to the new Chinese leadership under Deng Xiaoping. Another camp denounced the new leadership as traitors to the cause of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought. The third camp sided with the Albanians in denouncing the Three Worlds Theory of the CPC (see Sino-Albanian split).\n\nThough initially praising the Soviet Union prior to, during and shortly after the Cuban Revolution, Che Guevara later came out in support of Maoism and advocated the adoption of the ideology throughout Latin America. The pro-Albanian camp would start to function as an international group as well (led by Enver Hoxha and the APL) and was also able to amalgamate many of the communist groups in Latin America, including the Communist Party of Brazil and the Marxist-Leninist Communist Party in Ecuador. Later, Latin American Communists such as Peru's Shining Path also embraced the tenets of Maoism.\n\nThe new Chinese leadership showed little interest in the various foreign groups supporting Mao's China. Many of the foreign parties that were fraternal parties aligned with the Chinese government before 1975 either disbanded, abandoned the new Chinese government entirely, or even renounced Marxism–Leninism and developed into non-communist, social democratic parties. What is today called the \"international Maoist movement\" evolved out of the second camp—the parties that opposed Deng and said they upheld the true legacy of Mao.\n\nFrom 1962 onwards, the challenge to the Soviet hegemony in the world communist movement made by the CPC resulted in various divisions in communist parties around the world. At an early stage, the Albanian Party of Labour sided with the CPC. So did many of the mainstream (non-splinter group) Communist parties in South-East Asia, like the Burmese Communist Party, Communist Party of Thailand and Communist Party of Indonesia. Some Asian parties, like the Workers Party of Vietnam and the Workers Party of Korea attempted to take a middle-ground position.\n\nThe Khmer Rouge of Cambodia is said to have been a replica of the Maoist regime. According to the BBC, the Communist Party of Kampuchea (CPK) in Cambodia, better known as the Khmer Rouge, identified strongly with Maoism and it is generally labeled a Maoist movement today. Maoists (and Marxists generally) contend that the CPK strongly deviated from Marxist doctrine and the few references to Maoist China in CPK propaganda were critical of the Chinese.\n\nIn the west and south, a plethora of parties and organizations were formed that upheld links to the CPC. Often they took names such as Communist Party (Marxist–Leninist) or Revolutionary Communist Party to distinguish themselves from the traditional pro-Soviet communist parties. The pro-CPC movements were in many cases based among the wave of student radicalism that engulfed the world in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nOnly one Western classic communist party sided with the CPC, the Communist Party of New Zealand. Under the leadership of the CPC and Mao Zedong, a parallel international communist movement emerged to rival that of the Soviets, although it was never as formalized and homogeneous as the pro-Soviet tendency.\n\nThe Progressive Youth Organization was a Maoist organization in Afghanistan. It was founded in 1965 with Akram Yari as its first leader, advocating the overthrow of the then-current order by means of people's war.\n\nPurba Banglar Sarbahara Party is a Maoist party in Bangladesh. It was founded in 1968 with Siraj Sikder as its first leader. The party played a role in the Bangladesh Liberation War.\n\nThe Sino-Soviet split had an important influence on communism in Belgium. The pro-Soviet Communist Party of Belgium experienced a split of a Maoist wing under Jacques Grippa. The latter was a lower-ranking CPB member before the split, but Grippa rose in prominence as he formed a worthy internal Maoist opponent to the CPB leadership. His followers where sometimes referred to as \"Grippisten/Grippistes\". When it became clear that the differences between the pro-Moscow leadership and the pro-Beijing wing were too great, Grippa and his entourage decided to split from the CPB and formed the Communist Party of Belgium – Marxist–Leninist (PCBML). The PCBML had some influence, mostly in the heavily industrialized Borinage region of Wallonia, but never managed to gather more support than the CPB. The latter held most of its leadership and base within the pro-Soviet camp. However, the PCBML was the first European Maoist party that was officially recognized as a sister-party of the CPC by Beijing.\n\nThough the PCBML never really gained a foothold in Flanders, there was a reasonably successful Maoist movement in this region. Out of the student unions that formed in the wake of the May 1968 protests, Alle Macht Aan De Arbeiders (AMADA) or All Power To The Workers, was formed as a vanguard party-under-construction. This Maoist group originated mostly out of students from the universities of Leuven and Ghent, but did manage to gain some influence among the striking miners during the shut-downs of the Belgian stonecoal mines in the late 1960s and early 1970s. This group became the Workers' Party of Belgium (WPB) in 1979 and still exists today, although its power base has shifted somewhat from Flanders towards Wallonia. The WPB stayed loyal to the teachings of Mao for a long time, but after a general congress held in 2008 the party formally broke with its Maoist/Stalinist past.\n\nThe Communist Party of Ecuador – Red Sun, also known as \"Puka Inti\", is a small Maoist guerrilla organization in Ecuador.\n\nCommunist Party of India (Maoist) is the leading Maoist organisation in India. Two major political groupings owing allegiance to Mao Tse Tung's ideas — Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) People's War and Maoist Communist Centre of India (MCCI) — merged on on 21 September 2004 to form Communist Party of India (Maoist).\n\nUnion of Iranian Communists (Sarbedaran) was an Iran Maoist organization. UIC (S) was formed in 1976 after the alliance of a number of Maoist groups carrying out military actions within Iran. In 1982, the UIC (S) mobilized forces in forests around Amol and launched an insurgency against the Islamist Government. The uprising was eventually a failure and many UIC (S) leaders were shot.\n\nThe Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine is a Maoist political and military organization. The DFLP's original political orientation was based on the view that Palestinian national goals could be achieved only through revolution of the masses and people's war.\n\nMaoist movements in Portugal were very active during the 1970s, especially during the Carnation Revolution that led to the fall of the fascist government the Estado Novo in 1974.\n\nThe largest Maoist movement in Portugal was the Portuguese Workers' Communist Party. The party was among the most active resistance movements before the Portuguese democratic revolution of 1974, especially among students of Lisbon. After the revolution, the MRPP achieved fame for its large and highly artistic mural paintings.\n\nIntensely active during 1974 and 1975, during that time the party had members that later came to be very important in national politics. For example, a future Prime Minister of Portugal, José Manuel Durão Barroso was active within Maoist movements in Portugal and identified as a Maoist. In the 1980s, the Forças Populares 25 de Abril was another far-left Maoist armed organization operating in Portugal between 1980 and 1987 with the goal of creating socialism in post-Carnation Revolution Portugal.\n\nIn the United States during the late 1960s, parts of the emerging New Left rejected the Marxism espoused by the Soviet Union and instead adopted pro-Chinese communism.\n\nThe Black Panther Party, especially under the leadership of Huey Newton, was influenced by Mao Zedong's ideas. Into the 1970s, Maoists in the United States, e.g. Maoist representative Jon Lux, formed a large part of the New Communist movement.\n\nThe Revolutionary Communist Party, USA is also a Maoist movement.\n\nThe Communist Party of Spain (Reconstituted) was a Spanish clandestine Maoist party. The armed wing of the party was First of October Anti-Fascist Resistance Groups.\n\nCommunist Party of Turkey/Marxist–Leninist (TKP/ML) is a Maoist organization in Turkey currently waging a people's war against the Turkish government. It was founded in 1972 with İbrahim Kaypakkaya as its first leader. The armed wing of the party is named the Workers' and Peasants' Liberation Army in Turkey (TIKKO).\n\nVarious efforts have sought to regroup the international communist movement under Maoism since the time of Mao's death in 1976.\n\nAnother effort at regrouping the international communist movement is the International Conference of Marxist-Leninist Parties and Organizations (ICMLPO). Three notable parties that participate in the ICMLPO are the Marxist–Leninist Party of Germany (MLPD), the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) and Marxist–Leninist Communist Organization – Proletarian Way. The ICMLPO seeks to unity around Marxism-Leninism, not Maoism. However, some of the parties and organizations within the ICMLPO identify as Mao Zedong Thought or Maoist.\n\nMaoism has fallen out of favour within the Communist Party of China, beginning with Deng Xiaoping's reforms in 1978. Deng believed that Maoism showed the dangers of \"ultra-leftism\", manifested in the harm perpetrated by the various mass movements that characterized the Maoist era. In Chinese communism, the term \"left\" can be taken as a euphemism for Maoist policies. However, Deng stated that the revolutionary side of Maoism should be considered separate from the governance side, leading to his famous epithet that Mao was \"70% right, 30% wrong\". Chinese scholars generally agree that Deng's interpretation of Maoism preserves the legitimacy of Communist rule in China, but at the same time criticizes Mao's brand of economic and political governance.\n\nCritic Graham Young says that Maoists see Joseph Stalin as the last true socialist leader of the Soviet Union, but allows that the Maoist assessments of Stalin vary between the extremely positive and the more ambivalent. Some political philosophers, such as Martin Cohen, have seen in Maoism an attempt to combine Confucianism and socialism—what one such called \"a third way between communism and capitalism\".\n\nEnver Hoxha critiqued Maoism from a Marxist–Leninist perspective, arguing that New Democracy halts class struggle, the theory of the three worlds is \"counter-revolutionary\" and questioned Mao's guerilla warfare methods.\n\nSome say Mao departed from Leninism not only in his near-total lack of interest in the urban working class, but also in his concept of the nature and role of the party. For Lenin, the party was sacrosanct because it was the incarnation of the \"proletarian consciousness\" and there was no question about who were the teachers and who were the pupils. On the other hand, for Mao this question would always be virtually impossible to answer.\n\nThe implementation of Maoist thought in China was arguably responsible for as many as 70 million deaths during peacetime, with the Cultural Revolution, Anti-Rightist Campaign of 1957–1958 and the Great Leap Forward. Some historians have argued that because of Mao's land reforms during the Great Leap Forward, which resulted in famines, thirty million perished between 1958 and 1961. By the end of 1961, the birth rate was nearly cut in half because of malnutrition. Active campaigns, including party purges and \"reeducation\" resulted in imprisonment and/or the execution of those deemed contrary to the implementation of Maoist ideals. The incidents of destruction of cultural heritage, religion and art remain controversial. Some Western scholars saw Maoism specifically engaged in a battle to dominate and subdue nature and was a catastrophe for the environment.\n\nMao also believed strongly in the concept of a unified people. These notions were what prompted him to investigate the peasant uprisings in Hunan while the rest of China's communists were in the cities and focused on the orthodox Marxist proletariat. Many of the pillars of Maoism such as the distrust of intellectuals and the abhorrence of occupational specialty are typical populist ideas. The concept of \"People's War\" which is so central to Maoist thought is directly populist in its origins. Mao believed that intellectuals and party cadres had to become first students of the masses to become teachers of the masses later. This concept was vital to the strategy of the \"People's War\".\n\nMao's nationalist impulses also played a crucially important role in the adaption of Marxism to the Chinese model and in the formation of Maoism. Mao truly believed that China was to play a crucial preliminary role in the socialist revolution internationally. This belief, or the fervor with which Mao held it, separated Mao from the other Chinese communists and led Mao onto the path of what Leon Trotsky called \"Messianic Revolutionary Nationalism\", which was central to his personal philosophy. German post–World War II Strasserist Michael Kühnen, himself a former Maoist, once praised Maoism as being a Chinese form of national socialism.\n\n\n\n"}

Mosiah priority is the most widely held solution to questions regarding the sequence of the English text.\n\nThe original transcription of the Book of Mormon by scribe Martin Harris was interrupted by the loss of the original manuscript. The question about the subsequent workflow is known as the problem of priority in the Book of Mormon.\n\nThe \"Lost 116 pages\" were the first manuscript pages of the Book of Mormon, and these were entrusted to scribe Martin Harris and subsequently lost. Smith subsequently announced a revelation:\n\nBehold I say unto you, that you shall not translate again those words which have gone forth out of your hands; for behold, they shall not lie any more against those words; for behold, if you should bring forth the same words, they would say that you have lied; that you have pretended to translate, but that you have contradicted your words; and behold they would publish this, and satan would harden the hearts of the people, to stir them up to anger against you, that they might not believe my words\n\nIn a preface to the 1830 edition of the Book of Mormon, Smith writes of the Lost 116 pages: \n\nFaced with the loss of the 116 page manuscript, transcription of a second manuscript began.\n\nThe theory of \"1 Nephi\" Priority argues that after the loss of the original 116-page manuscript, the transcription process returned to the beginning of the Golden Plates narrative, starting over at the beginning with \"1 Nephi\". Proponents of 1 Nephi Priority included multiple 20th century authors.\nThe theory of Mosiah Priority argues that after the loss of the original 116-page manuscript, transcription continued in narrative order, beginning with Mosiah and continuing to Moroni. Afterwards, the transcription process turned to replacing the beginning of the Book of Mormon (1 Nephi to Words), roughly corresponding to the material in the Lost 116 pages.\n\nThe title page of the Book of Mormon, which Joseph Smith said was found at the very end of Moroni's record, had been completed before 11 Jun 1829. But evidence shows that the translation process still continued after this date. Metcalfe also argues that because the title page mentions Mormon's abridgment and Ether, but not Nephi's record, this suggests that \"1 Nephi\" had not yet been translated.\n\nFor some parts of the Book of Mormon text, likely dates of transcription have been identified. This includes the restarting of translation work (referred to in D&C 10 in April–May 1829), teachings on baptism in \"3 Nephi\" (referred to in D&C 13 on May 15, 1829), and a prophecy of the Three Witnesses in \"2 Nephi\" 27 (referred to in D&C 17 in June 1829). The times when these passages were produced corresponds with a sequence and a consistent pace of translation beginning at \"Mosiah\" in April 1829 and then arriving at \"1 Nephi\" later that summer.\n\nThe pages of the original manuscript containing \"1 Nephi\" are written in Oliver Cowdery's handwriting. However, the first scribes were Joseph's wife Emma and his younger brother Samuel, suggesting that the original manuscript was not begun at \"1 Nephi\". In addition, a scribe's handwriting in \"1 Nephi\" is believed to be from John Whitmer, who was not involved until late in the translation process, after Joseph Smith had moved back to Fayette, New York.\n\nThe beginning of the \"Book of Mosiah\" appears to be missing, since it lacks an introduction (unlike all the other abridged books) and its beginning was originally marked as Chapter 3 in the printer's manuscript. This suggests that an earlier beginning to \"Mosiah\" may have been in the lost 116-page manuscript and that the current \"Book of Mosiah\" immediately continues from that lost text.\n\nTextual evidence for Mosiah priority includes the shift in word choices over the transcription process. Scholars examine pairs of words that are roughly synonymous, such as:\n\nA 2008 computational study claimed to note patterns which support Mosiah priority, although its methodology is not without criticism.\n\nMosiah priority is widely accepted by Book of Mormon researchers and in scholarly publications about the text.\n"}

Alternate historical spellings of his name in English include \"Berdiaev\" and \"Berdiaeff\", and of his given name as \"Nicolas\" and \"Nicholas\".\n\nNikolai Berdyaev was born at Obukhiv, Kiev Governorate in 1874, in an aristocratic military family. His father, Alexander Mikhailovich Berdyaev, came from a long line of Kiev and Kharkov nobility. Almost all of Alexander Mikhailovich's ancestors served as high-ranking military officers, but he resigned from the army quite early and became active in the social life of the Kiev aristocracy. Nikolai's mother, Alina Sergeevna Berdyaeva, was half-French and came from the top levels of both French and Russian nobility. He also had Polish as well as Tatar origins.\n\nGreatly influenced by Voltaire, his father was an educated man that considered himself a freethinker and expressed great skepticism towards religion. Nikolai's mother, Eastern Orthodox by birth, was in her views on religion more Catholic than Orthodox. He spent a solitary childhood at home, where his father's library allowed him to read widely. He read Hegel, Schopenhauer, and Kant when he was only 14 and excelled at languages.\n\nBerdyaev decided on an intellectual career and entered the Kiev University in 1894. It was a time of revolutionary fervor among the students and the intelligentsia. He became a Marxist and he was arrested in a student demonstration and expelled from the university. His involvement in illegal activities led in 1897 to three years of internal exile, Vologda, in northern Russia, a mild sentence compared to that faced by many other revolutionaries.\n\nIn 1904, he married Lydia Yudifovna Trusheff. The couple moved to Saint Petersburg, the Russian capital, and the centre of intellectual and revolutionary activity. He participated fully in intellectual and spiritual debate, eventually departing from radical Marxism to focus his attention on philosophy and Christian spirituality.\n\nA fiery 1913 article, entitled \"Quenchers of the Spirit\", criticising the rough purging of Imiaslavie Russian monks on Mount Athos by the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church using tsarist troops, caused him to be charged with the crime of blasphemy, the punishment for which was exile to Siberia for life. The World War and the Bolshevik Revolution prevented the matter coming to trial. After the October Revolution of 1917, as the Bolshevik régime began consolidating its power with a growing suppression of non-Lenin Marxist Intelligentsia, Berdyaev remained steadfast in his criticism of its totalitarianism and the domination of the state over the freedom of the individual. Nonetheless, he was permitted, for the time being, to continue to lecture and write.\n\nHis disaffection culminated, in 1919, with the foundation of his own private academy, the \"Free Academy of Spiritual Culture\". It was primarily a forum for him to lecture on the hot topics of the day and to present them from a Christian point of view. He also presented his opinions in public lectures, and every Tuesday, the academy hosted a meeting at his home because official Soviet anti-religious activity was intense at the time and the official policy of the Bolshevik government, with its Soviet anti-religious legislation, strongly promoted State atheism.\n\nIn 1920, Berdiaev became professor of philosophy at the University of Moscow. In the same year, he was accused of participating in a conspiracy against the government; he was arrested and jailed. The feared head of the Cheka, Felix Dzerzhinsky, came in person to interrogate him, and he gave his interrogator a solid dressingdown on the problems with Bolshevism. Novelist Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn in his book \"The Gulag Archipelago\" recounts the incident as follows:\n\n[Berdyaev] was arrested twice; he was taken in 1922 for a midnight interrogation with Dzerjinsky; Kamenev was also there... But Berdyaev did not humiliate himself, he did not beg, he firmly professed the moral and religious principles by virtue of which he did not adhere to the party in power; and not only did they judge that there was no point in putting him on trial, but he was freed. Now there is a man who had a \"point of view\"!\nThe Soviet authorities eventually expelled Berdyaev from Russia, in September 1922. He became one of a group of prominent writers, scholars and intellectuals who were sent into forced exile on the so-called \"philosophers' ships\".\n\nAt first, Berdyaev and other émigrés went to Berlin, where he founded an academy of philosophy and religion, but economic and political conditions in the Weimar Republic caused him and his wife to move to Paris in 1923. He transferred his academy there, and taught, lectured and wrote, working for an exchange of ideas with the French and European intellectual community, and participated in a number of international conferences.\n\nDuring the German occupation of France during World War II, Berdyaev continued to write books that were published after the war, some of them after his death. In the years that he spent in France, Berdyaev wrote 15 books, including most of his most important works. He died at his writing desk in his home in Clamart, near Paris, in 1948.\n\nPrimary source biographical works in English are Berdyaev's intellectual autobiography, published originally under the title \"Dream and Reality\", and Donald A. Lowrie's 1960 book, \"Rebellious Prophet: A Life of Nikolai Berdyaev\", written in close collaboration with Berdyaev's sister-in-law, Evgenia Rapp, and others of their close acquaintance under the auspices of the Berdiaev Société.\n\nDavid Bonner Richardson described Berdyaev's philosophy as Christian existentialism and personalism. He emphasized the importance of creativity that requires personal freedom.\n\nAccording to Marko Markovic, \"He was an ardent man, rebellious to all authority, an independent and \"negative\" spirit. He could assert himself only in negation and could not hear any assertion without immediately negating it, to such an extent that he would even be able to contradict himself and to attack people who shared his own prior opinions\".\n\nHe also published works about Russian history and the Russian national character. In particular, he wrote about Russian nationalism:\nBerdyaev was a member of the Russian Orthodox Church, and believed Orthodoxy was the religious tradition closest to early Christianity.\n\nBerdyaev criticized Russian Orthodox Church and described his views as anticlerical, but this should be considered in context of a abusive distortion of the \"we\" aspect of churchly Sobornost by a pseudo \"us-them\" class divisive Marxist-like mentality. He considered himself closer to Orthodoxy than either Catholicism or Protestantism. According to him, \"I can not call myself a typical Orthodox of any kind; but Orthodoxy was near to me (and I hope I am nearer to Orthodoxy) than either Catholicism or Protestantism. I never severed my link with the Orthodox Church, although confessional self-satisfaction and exclusiveness are alien to me.\"\n\nBerdyaev is frequently presented as one of the important Russian Orthodox thinkers of the 20th century. However, neopatristic scholars such as Florovsky have questioned whether his philosophy is essentially Orthodox in character, and emphasize his western influences. But Florovsky can hardly be considered an objective unbiased critic, having been savaged in a 1937 Journal Put' article by Berdyaev, along with Florovsky's own extreme ultra-Byzantine views impelling his 1955 career change. Paul Valliere has pointed out the sociological factors and global trends which have shaped the Neopatristic movement, and questions their claim that Berdyaev and Vladimir Solovyov are somehow less authentically Orthodox.\n\nBerdyaev affirmed universal salvation, as did many important Orthodox theologians of the 20th century. Along with Sergei Bulgakov, he was instrumental in bringing renewed attention to the Orthodox doctrine of apokatastasis, which had largely been neglected since it was expounded by Maximus the Confessor in the seventh century, although he rejected Origen's articulation of this doctrine.\n\nThe aftermath of the Russian Revolution and Civil War, along with Soviet interference, caused the Russian Orthodox emigre diaspora to splinter into three Russian Church jurisdictions: the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia (in schism from Moscow Patriarchate until 2007); the parishes under Metropolitan Eulogius (Georgiyevsky) that went under the Constantinople Ecumenical Patriarchate; and parishes that remained under the Moscow Patriarchate. Berdyaev was among those that chose to remain under the omophor of the Moscow Patriarchate. He is mentioned by name on the Kosun/Chersonese Diocesan history as among those noted figures who supported the Moscow Patriarchate West-European Eparchy (in France now Korsun eparchy).\n\nCurrently, the house in Clamart in which Berdyaev lived, now comprises a small \"Berdiaev-museum\" and attached Chapel in name of the Holy Spirit, under the omophor of the Moscow Patriarchate. On 24 March 2018, the 70th anniversary of Berdyaev's death, the priest of the Chapel served panikhida-memorial prayer at the Diocesan cathedral for eternal memory of Berdyaev, and later that day the Diocesan bishop Nestor(Sirotenko) presided over prayer at the grave of Berdyaev.\n\nThe first date is of the Russian edition, the second date is of the first English edition\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1073770", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1073770", "title": "Nolle prosequi", "text": "Nolle prosequi\n\nNolle prosequi (; ) is a legal term of art and a Latin legal phrase meaning \"be unwilling to pursue\", a phrase amounting to \"do not prosecute\". It is a phrase used in many common law criminal prosecution contexts to describe a prosecutor's decision to voluntarily discontinue criminal charges either before trial or before a verdict is rendered. It contrasts with an involuntary dismissal.\n\n\"Nolle prosequi\" as a declaration is most often used in criminal cases, but in jurisdictions making use of \"nolle prosequi\" in civil lawsuits, it is used by a plaintiff that voluntarily drops its claims. In civil cases, a motion for voluntary dismissal may be made by a plaintiff instead of a declaration of \"nolle prosequi\", depending upon the custom and rules of a given jurisdiction.\n\n\"Nolle prosequi\" as a declaration can be made by a prosecutor in a criminal case either before or during trial, resulting in the prosecutor declining to further pursue the case against the defendant. Courts seldom challenge applications for \"nolle prosequi\". In the United States, judges will usually sign a dismissal order prepared by the prosecution or make a docket entry indicating the disposition of the case to be \"nolle prosse\" after a declaration or motion by the prosecution.\n\nIn criminal cases in the United States it has been held improper for a court to enter an order of \"nolle prosequi\" on its own, without a motion by the prosecutor, but as to sentencing discrepancies involved in a sentence recommendation, a trial judge is authorized to reject an underlying guilty plea based upon concerns of fairness and justice or because it is presented after the plea cutoff date. The notes to Rule 48 of the US Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (FRCRP) draw attention to the effect of the rule as contrasting with common law. Rule 48 now mandates for prosecutors to seek leave of the court before they dismiss a case via filing a \"nolle prosequi\".\n\nThe declaration may be made because the charges cannot be proved because the evidence is too weak to carry the burden of proof, the evidence is fatally flawed in light of the claims that are brought, the prosecutor becomes doubtful that the accused is guilty, the defendant's innocence is proved, or the defendant has died. It has also been used when a federal criminal charge is brought up against a defendant when the prosecutor on a state charge for the same offense no longer wishes to pursue the case. Usually, that happens when the state prosecutor is content with the sentence on the federal charge and has no need to go any further with the original case.\n\nIn criminal cases, \"nolle prosequi\" declarations are made generally after an indictment as long as adjudication on the merits has not occurred or, in some jurisdictions, as long as a trial has not commenced. In civil cases, \"nolle prosequi\" declarations are made either before the trial begins or before a judgment on the merits is rendered, depending on the rules of the jurisdiction.\n\nThe entry of a \"nolle prosequi\" is not an acquittal. Since the principle of double jeopardy therefore does not apply, the defendant may later be indicted on the same charge again.\n\nIn civil cases, a \"nolle prosequi\" or voluntary dismissal may be entered as to one of several counts or claims, or as to one of several defendants, or both. In any jurisdiction, whether a motion for voluntary dismissal or a declaration of \"nolle prosequi\" is used, federal and state rules of civil procedure generally govern when, how, and why claims may be voluntarily dismissed and apply different rules to different types of claims and to whether a court may give leave to dismiss a matter with or without prejudice.\n\n\"Nolle prosequi\" is similar to a declination of prosecution, which is an agreement not to prosecute made before any charges are brought or suit has been filed. A declination of prosecution may be made by an attorney or may be made as an agreement between the aggrieved party and the claimant.\n\nIn contrast, \"nolle prosequi\" is usually made after a decision to prosecute has already been made. A declination of prosecution may be made for many reasons, such as weak evidence or a conflict of interest.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11609814", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11609814", "title": "Pashupata Shaivism", "text": "Pashupata Shaivism\n\nPashupata Shaivism (, ) is the oldest of the major Shaivite Hindu schools. There is a debate about pioneership of this school and Goan school of Nakulish darshan believes that Nakulish was pioneer and Lakulish and Patanjalinath were his disciples while Gujrat school believes that Nakulish and Lakulish are one. Sarwdarshansangrah written by Madhavachary mentiones it as \"Nakulish Darshan\" not as \"Lakulish Darshan\" Both sub schools are still active in their own areas. The philosophy of the Pashupata sect was systematized by also called Nakulīśa) in the 2nd century A.D. The main texts of the school are ' with Kauṇḍinya's ', and ' with Bhāsarvajña's '. Both texts were discovered only in the twentieth century. Prior to that, the major source of information on this sect was a chapter devoted to it in 's \"\".\n\nThe date of foundation of the school is uncertain. However, the Pashupatas may have existed from the 1st century CE. Gavin Flood dates them to around the 2nd century CE. They are also referred to in the epic Mahabharata which is thought to have reached a final form by 4th century CE. The Pashupata movement was influential in South India in the period between the 7th and 14th century, but it no longer exists.\n\nPashupata Shaivism was a devotional (bhakti) and ascetic movement. Pashu in Pashupati refers to the effect (or created world), the word designates that which is dependent on something ulterior. Whereas, Pati means the cause (or principium), the word designates the Lord, who is the cause of the universe, the pati, or the ruler. To free themselves from worldly fetters Pashupatas are instructed to do a pashupata vrata. Atharvasiras Upanishsad describes the pashupata vrata as that which consists of besmearing one's own body with ashes and at the same time muttering mantra — \"Agni is ashes, Vayu is ashes, Sky is ashes, all this is ashes, the mind, these eyes are ashes.\"\n\nHaradattacharya, in Gaṇakārikā, explains that a spiritual teacher is one who knows the eight pentads and the three functions. The eight pentads of Acquisition (result of expedience), Impurity (evil in soul), Expedient (means of purification), Locality (aids to increase knowledge), Perseverance (endurance in pentads), Purification (putting away impurities), Initiation and Powers are —\n\nThe three functions correspond to the means of earning daily food — mendicancy, living upon alms, and living upon what chance supplies.\n\nPashupatas disapprove of the Vaishnava theology, known for its doctrine servitude of souls to the Supreme Being, on the grounds that dependence upon anything cannot be the means of cessation of pain and other desired ends. They recognize that those depending upon another and longing for independence will not be emancipated because they still depend upon something other than themselves. According to Pashupatas, spirits possess the attributes of the Supreme Deity when they become liberated from the 'germ of every pain'. In this system the cessation of pain is of two kinds, impersonal and personal. Impersonal consists of the absolute cessation of all pains, whereas the personal consists of development of visual and active powers like swiftness of thought, assuming forms at will etc. The Lord is held to be the possessor of infinite, visual, and active powers.\n\nPañchārtha bhāshyadipikā divides the created world into the insentient and the sentient. The insentient is unconscious and thus dependent on the conscious. The insentient is further divided into effects and causes. The effects are of ten kinds, the earth, four elements and their qualities, colour etc. . The causes are of thirteen kinds, the five organs of cognition, the five organs of action, the three internal organs, intellect, the ego principle and the cognising principle. These insentient causes are held responsible for the illusive identification of Self with non-Self. The sentient spirit, which is subject to transmigration is of two kinds, the appetent and nonappetent. The appetent is the spirit associated with an organism and sense organs, whereas the non-appetent is the spirit without them.\n\nUnion in the Pashupata system is a conjunction of the soul with God through the intellect. It is achieved in two ways, action and cessation of action. Union through action consists of pious muttering, meditation etc. and union through cessation of action occurs through consciousness.\n\nRituals and spiritual practices were done to acquire merit or puṇya. They were divided into primary and secondary rituals, where primary rituals were the direct means of acquiring merit. Primary rituals included acts of piety and various postures. The acts of piety were bathing thrice a day, lying upon sand and worship with oblations of laughter, song, dance, sacred muttering etc. Postures involved absurd actions such as, snoring or showing signs of being asleep while awake, limping, wooing or gestures of an inamorato on seeing a young and pretty woman, talking nonsensically etc. Secondary rituals involved bearing marks of purity after bathing.\n\nLakulisa is credited with authorship of the \"Pancharthavidya\", in which devotees are instructed to \"bathe thrice a day\" and \"lie on the dust or ashes\". This \"Pasupata Vow\" is also described in the Atharvasiras Upanishad.\n\nThe Pasupatas worshiped Lord Shiva as God Almighty. They would bathe their body three times a day in sand, lie in ashes, sing bhajans of Shiva.\n\nLaughing was also an important Pasupata practice, as was physically shaking and meditation.\n\nThey call the union (Moksha) with Shiva, \"Rudrasajujya.\"\n\nAccording to Govind Chandra Pande, there are given major principles which the Pasupata members adhere to: \n\nThe Pasupatas are known to have had sects within the Pasupata sect. For example, the Lakulins are said to be a sub-sect. The Tripurantaka sect are also said to be the same. Their scripture is the Cintra prashasti. They were found in Gujarat up to the Chalukya era. The Lalikesa Sasana were another sect.\n\nIt is said that \"Lakulisa\" became the name of the Pasupata sects at least after the 11th century CE. The Lakulin sect is also known by the names \"Lakulasamaya\", \"Lakula\", \"Lanjana\", \"Laguda\", \"Langala\", \"Nakula\", \"Vakula.\"\n\nTemples with the carvings of Lakulisa are found in western regions of India as that is where it originated although it is also found in the east as far as Orissa, south to Tamil Nadu and north to Kashmir.\n\nThe practice of course began in western India and so spread amongst areas of the west. many images of Lakula have been found in areas such as Rajasthan. Fergusson assigned temples from Rajasthan down to Andhra as belonging to the Pasupatas. The region around Mt. Abu was the principal place of Pasuapta activities. MadhyaPradesh too has a treasure of images of Lakula found from places like Mandsaur, Ujjain, etc.\n\nAlong with other forms of Shiva, there is a painting of Lakulisa in an Ellora cave of Maharashtra.\n\n\"The form of Saivism in Kashmir during the early period was of the Pasupata sect. According to a tradition recorded in the Mahabharata, the doctrine of Pasupata was first preached by Siva Srikantha. Siva Srikantha was regarded in the Valley to as the promulgator or Sivagama or Agamanta Saivism which included the system of the Pasupata.\"\n\nIn Tamil Nadu, it is known to have existed in the modern-day district of Tiruvottiyur, and in Kashmir in Payar, where there are Lakulisa figures found. In Tamil Nadu, it also existed in Tanjore and Nagapattnam.\n\nAccording to the findings of the Archaeological Survey of India, Bijjaladeva of the Chalukyan Empire of Southern India and parts of Northern India, donated a gift in the service to God. The gift was made after washing the feet of Divyasakti-Panditadeva, a Lakulin.\n\nAs the \"Hinduism Today\" article reports: \nIt is believed by some scholars that they may have been absorbed into other sects such as the Kanpatha Yoga.\n\nTo King Ishttanga's rule (915-930 CE) is attributed the building of a Pasupata temple.\n\nThere is a Nakuleshvara Temple complex in Kalighata, West Bengal.\n\nIt has been theorized by a few scholars such as Dale Hoiberg and Indu Ramchandani state that the sect existed in Cambodia and Java, Indonesia.\n\nThe Pasupata beliefs are summarized in the \"Pasaputa Sutra\". This text was rediscovered in 1930 and is attributed to Lakulisa himself. Bhanmdarkar attributes the \"Atharva-Siras\"to the Pasupatas. Also, in the text, their vow is recorded.\n\nThe Mahabharata claimed that he was a son of Lord Brahma and taught people the Pasupata system. In the Mahabharata, Srikantha (or Lakulisa) claims that the Pasupata system is a son of Lord Brahma when a form of Shiva emerged from Lord Brahma's eyebrow (MBh (B), 12, 349-67) \n\nThe \"Sarva-Darsana-Samgraha\" of the Advaitin saint Madhavacarya wrote in the text, the philosophical system of Lakulin. Kaundinya's or Rashikara's \"Pancharta Bhasya\" discusses this sect. The \"Gana-karika\" of Bhasarvajna too discusses this school in detail. The Pasupata system is mentioned in the \"Vayuviha Samhita\".\n\nSome people including compilers of the Vayu and Linga puranas to be a corresponding system of the Pancharatna.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "76939", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=76939", "title": "Phenomenology (philosophy)", "text": "Phenomenology (philosophy)\n\nPhenomenology (from Greek \"phainómenon\" \"that which appears\" and \"lógos\" \"study\") is the philosophical study of the structures of experience and consciousness. As a philosophical movement it was founded in the early years of the 20th century by Edmund Husserl and was later expanded upon by a circle of his followers at the universities of Göttingen and Munich in Germany. It then spread to France, the United States, and elsewhere, often in contexts far removed from Husserl's early work.\nPhenomenology is not a unitary movement; rather, different authors share a common family resemblance but also with many significant differences. Gabriella Farina states:A unique and final definition of phenomenology is dangerous and perhaps even paradoxical as it lacks a thematic focus. In fact, it is not a doctrine, nor a philosophical school, but rather a style of thought, a method, an open and ever-renewed experience having different results, and this may disorient anyone wishing to define the meaning of phenomenology.Phenomenology, in Husserl's conception, is primarily concerned with the systematic reflection on and study of the structures of consciousness and the phenomena that appear in acts of consciousness. Phenomenology can be clearly differentiated from the Cartesian method of analysis which sees the world as objects, sets of objects, and objects acting and reacting upon one another.\n\nHusserl's conception of phenomenology has been criticized and developed not only by himself but also by students such as Edith Stein and Roman Ingarden, by hermeneutic philosophers such as Martin Heidegger, by existentialists such as Nicolai Hartmann, Gabriel Marcel, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Jean-Paul Sartre, and by other philosophers such as Max Scheler, Paul Ricoeur, Jean-Luc Marion, Michel Henry, Emmanuel Levinas, Jacques Derrida, and sociologists Alfred Schütz and Eric Voegelin.\n\nIn its most basic form, phenomenology attempts to create conditions for the objective study of topics usually regarded as subjective: consciousness and the content of conscious experiences such as judgements, perceptions, and emotions. Although phenomenology seeks to be scientific, it does not attempt to study consciousness from the perspective of clinical psychology or neurology. Instead, it seeks through systematic reflection to determine the essential properties and structures of experience.\n\nThere are several assumptions behind phenomenology that help explain its foundations:\n\nHusserl derived many important concepts central to phenomenology from the works and lectures of his teachers, the philosophers and psychologists Franz Brentano and Carl Stumpf. An important element of phenomenology that Husserl borrowed from Brentano is intentionality (often described as \"aboutness\"), the notion that consciousness is always consciousness \"of\" something. The object of consciousness is called the \"intentional object\", and this object is constituted for consciousness in many different ways, through, for instance, perception, memory, retention and protention, signification, etc. Throughout these different intentionalities, though they have different structures and different ways of being \"about\" the object, an object is still constituted as the identical object; consciousness is directed at the same intentional object in direct perception as it is in the immediately following retention of this object and the eventual remembering of it.\n\nThough many of the phenomenological methods involve various reductions, phenomenology is, in essence, anti-reductionistic; the reductions are mere tools to better understand and describe the workings of consciousness, not to reduce any phenomenon to these descriptions. In other words, when a reference is made to a thing's \"essence\" or \"idea\", or when the constitution of an identical coherent thing is specified by describing what one \"really\" sees as being only these sides and aspects, these surfaces, it does not mean that the thing is only and exclusively what is described here: the ultimate goal of these reductions is to understand \"how\" these different aspects are constituted into the actual thing as experienced by the person experiencing it. Phenomenology is a direct reaction to the psychologism and physicalism of Husserl's time.\n\nAlthough previously employed by Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel in his \"Phenomenology of Spirit\", it was Husserl's adoption of this term (circa 1900) that propelled it into becoming the designation of a philosophical school. As a philosophical perspective, phenomenology is its method, though the specific meaning of the term varies according to how it is conceived by a given philosopher. As envisioned by Husserl, phenomenology is a method of philosophical inquiry that rejects the rationalist bias that has dominated Western thought since Plato in favor of a method of reflective attentiveness that discloses the individual's \"lived experience.\" Loosely rooted in an epistemological device, with Sceptic roots, called epoché, Husserl's method entails the suspension of judgment while relying on the intuitive grasp of knowledge, free of presuppositions and intellectualizing. Sometimes depicted as the \"science of experience,\" the phenomenological method is rooted in intentionality, i.e. Husserl's theory of consciousness (developed from Brentano). Intentionality represents an alternative to the representational theory of consciousness, which holds that reality cannot be grasped directly because it is available only through perceptions of reality that are representations of it in the mind. Husserl countered that consciousness is not \"in\" the mind; rather, consciousness is conscious of something other than itself (the intentional object), whether the object is a substance or a figment of imagination (i.e., the real processes associated with and underlying the figment). Hence the phenomenological method relies on the description of phenomena as they are given to consciousness, in their immediacy.\n\nAccording to Maurice Natanson (1973, p. 63), \"The radicality of the phenomenological method is both continuous and discontinuous with philosophy's general effort to subject experience to fundamental, critical scrutiny: to take nothing for granted and to show the warranty for what we claim to know.\" In practice, it entails an unusual combination of discipline and detachment to bracket theoretical explanations and second-hand information while determining one's \"naive\" experience of the matter. (To \"bracket\" in this sense means to provisionally suspend or set aside some idea as a way to facilitate the inquiry by focusing only on its most significant components.) The phenomenological method serves to momentarily erase the world of speculation by returning the subject to his or her primordial experience of the matter, whether the object of inquiry is a feeling, an idea, or a perception. According to Husserl the suspension of belief in what we ordinarily take for granted or infer by conjecture diminishes the power of what we customarily embrace as objective reality. According to Rüdiger Safranski (1998, 72), \"[Husserl's and his followers'] great ambition was to disregard anything that had until then been thought or said about consciousness or the world [while] on the lookout for a new way of letting the things [they investigated] approach them, without covering them up with what they already knew.\"\n\nMartin Heidegger modified Husserl's conception of phenomenology because of what Heidegger perceived as Husserl's subjectivist tendencies. Whereas Husserl conceived humans as having been constituted by states of consciousness, Heidegger countered that consciousness is peripheral to the primacy of one's existence (i.e., the mode of being of Dasein), which cannot be reduced to one's consciousness of it. From this angle, one's state of mind is an \"effect\" rather than a determinant of existence, including those aspects of existence of which one is not conscious. By shifting the center of gravity from consciousness (psychology) to existence (ontology), Heidegger altered the subsequent direction of phenomenology. As one consequence of Heidegger's modification of Husserl's conception, phenomenology became increasingly relevant to psychoanalysis. Whereas Husserl gave priority to a depiction of consciousness that was fundamentally alien to the psychoanalytic conception of the unconscious, Heidegger offered a way to conceptualize experience that could accommodate those aspects of one's existence that lie on the periphery of sentient awareness.\n\nPhenomenology has at least three main meanings in philosophical history: one in the writings of G. W. F. Hegel, another in the writings of Edmund Husserl in 1920, and thirdly, succeeding Husserl's work, in the writings of his former research assistant Martin Heidegger in 1927.\n\nAlthough the term \"phenomenology\" was used occasionally in the history of philosophy before Husserl, modern use ties it more explicitly to his particular method. Following is a list of important thinkers, in rough chronological order, who used the term \"phenomenology\" in a variety of ways, with brief comments on their contributions:\n\nLater usage is mostly based on or (critically) related to Husserl's introduction and use of the term. This branch of philosophy differs from others in that it tends to be more \"descriptive\" than \"prescriptive\".\n\nThe \"Encyclopedia of Phenomenology\" (Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1997) features separate articles on the following seven types of phenomenology:\n\nThe contrast between \"constitutive phenomenology\" (; also static phenomenology (') or descriptive phenomenology (')) and \"genetic phenomenology\" ('; also phenomenology of genesis (')) is due to Husserl.\n\nModern scholarship also recognizes the existence of the following varieties: late Heidegger's transcendental hermeneutic phenomenology (see transcendental philosophy and \"a priori\"), Maurice Merleau-Ponty's embodied phenomenology (see embodied cognition), Michel Henry's material phenomenology (also based on embodied cognition), analytic phenomenology (see analytic philosophy), J. L. Austin's linguistic phenomenology (see ordinary language philosophy), and post-analytic phenomenology (see postanalytic philosophy).\n\nIntentionality refers to the notion that consciousness is always the consciousness \"of\" something. The word itself should not be confused with the \"ordinary\" use of the word intentional, but should rather be taken as playing on the etymological roots of the word. Originally, intention referred to a \"stretching out\" (\"in tension,\" from Latin \"intendere\"), and in this context it refers to consciousness \"stretching out\" towards its object. However, one should be careful with this image: there is not some consciousness first that, subsequently, stretches out to its object; rather, consciousness \"occurs as\" the simultaneity of a conscious act and its object.\n\nIntentionality is often summed up as \"aboutness.\" Whether this \"something\" that consciousness is about is in direct perception or in fantasy is inconsequential to the concept of intentionality itself; whatever consciousness is directed at, \"that\" is what consciousness is conscious of. This means that the object of consciousness doesn't \"have\" to be a \"physical\" object apprehended in perception: it can just as well be a fantasy or a memory. Consequently, these \"structures\" of consciousness, i.e., perception, memory, fantasy, etc., are called \"intentionalities\".\n\nThe term \"intentionality\" originated with the Scholastics in the medieval period and was resurrected by Brentano who in turn influenced Husserl's conception of phenomenology, who refined the term and made it the cornerstone of his theory of consciousness. The meaning of the term is complex and depends entirely on how it is conceived by a given philosopher. The term should not be confused with \"intention\" or the psychoanalytic conception of unconscious \"motive\" or \"gain\".\n\nIntuition in phenomenology refers to cases where the intentional object is directly present to the intentionality at play; if the intention is \"filled\" by the direct apprehension of the object, you have an intuited object. Having a cup of coffee in front of you, for instance, seeing it, feeling it, or even imagining it – these are all filled intentions, and the object is then \"intuited\". The same goes for the apprehension of mathematical formulae or a number. If you do not have the object as referred to directly, the object is not intuited, but still intended, but then \"emptily\". Examples of empty intentions can be signitive intentions – intentions that only \"imply\" or \"refer to\" their objects.\n\nIn everyday language, we use the word evidence to signify a special sort of relation between a state of affairs and a proposition: State A is evidence for the proposition \"A is true.\" In phenomenology, however, the concept of evidence is meant to signify the \"subjective achievement of truth.\" This is not an attempt to reduce the objective sort of evidence to subjective \"opinion,\" but rather an attempt to describe the structure of having something present in intuition with the addition of having it present as \"intelligible\": \"Evidence is the successful presentation of an intelligible object, the successful presentation of something whose truth becomes manifest in the evidencing itself.\"\n\nIn Husserl's phenomenology, which is quite common, this pair of terms, derived from the Greek \"nous\" (mind), designate respectively the real content, noesis, and the ideal content, noema, of an intentional act (an act of consciousness). The Noesis is the part of the act that gives it a particular sense or character (as in judging or perceiving something, loving or hating it, accepting or rejecting it, and so on). This is real in the sense that it is actually part of what takes place in the consciousness (or psyche) of the subject of the act. The Noesis is always correlated with a Noema; for Husserl, the full Noema is a complex ideal structure comprising at least a noematic sense and a noematic core. The correct interpretation of what Husserl meant by the Noema has long been controversial, but the noematic sense is generally understood as the ideal meaning of the act and the noematic core as the act's referent or object \"as it is meant in the act\". One element of controversy is whether this noematic object is the same as the actual object of the act (assuming it exists) or is some kind of ideal object.\n\nIn phenomenology, empathy refers to the experience of one's own body \"as\" another. While we often identify others with their physical bodies, this type of phenomenology requires that we focus on the subjectivity of the other, as well as our intersubjective engagement with them. In Husserl's original account, this was done by a sort of apperception built on the experiences of your own lived-body. The lived body is your own body as experienced by yourself, \"as\" yourself. Your own body manifests itself to you mainly as your possibilities of acting in the world. It is what lets you reach out and grab something, for instance, but it also, and more importantly, allows for the possibility of changing your point of view. This helps you differentiate one thing from another by the experience of moving around it, seeing new aspects of it (often referred to as making the absent present and the present absent), and still retaining the notion that this is the same thing that you saw other aspects of just a moment ago (it is identical). Your body is also experienced as a duality, both as object (you can touch your own hand) and as your own subjectivity (you experience being touched).\n\nThe experience of your own body as your own subjectivity is then applied to the experience of another's body, which, through apperception, is constituted as another subjectivity. You can thus recognise the Other's intentions, emotions, etc. This experience of empathy is important in the phenomenological account of intersubjectivity. In phenomenology, intersubjectivity constitutes objectivity (i.e., what you experience as objective is experienced as being intersubjectively available – available to all other subjects. This does not imply that objectivity is reduced to subjectivity nor does it imply a relativist position, cf. for instance intersubjective verifiability).\n\nIn the experience of intersubjectivity, one also experiences oneself as being a subject among other subjects, and one experiences oneself as existing objectively \"for\" these Others; one experiences oneself as the noema of Others' noeses, or as a subject in another's empathic experience. As such, one experiences oneself as objectively existing subjectivity. Intersubjectivity is also a part in the constitution of one's lifeworld, especially as \"homeworld.\"\n\nThe lifeworld (German: \"Lebenswelt\") is the \"world\" each one of us \"lives\" in. One could call it the \"background\" or \"horizon\" of all experience, and it is that on which each object stands out as itself (as different) and with the meaning it can only hold for us. The lifeworld is both personal and intersubjective (it is then called a \"homeworld\"), and, as such, it does not enclose each one of us in a solus ipse.\n\nIn the first edition of the \"Logical Investigations\", still under the influence of Brentano, Husserl describes his position as \"descriptive psychology.\" Husserl analyzes the intentional structures of mental acts and how they are directed at both real and ideal objects. The first volume of the \"Logical Investigations\", the \"Prolegomena to Pure Logic\", begins with a devastating critique of psychologism, i.e., the attempt to subsume the \"a priori\" validity of the laws of logic under psychology. Husserl establishes a separate field for research in logic, philosophy, and phenomenology, independently from the empirical sciences.\n\nSome years after the publication of the \"Logical Investigations\", Husserl made some key elaborations that led him to the distinction between the act of consciousness (\"noesis\") and the phenomena at which it is directed (the \"noemata\").\n\nWhat we observe is not the object as it is in itself, but how and inasmuch it is given in the intentional acts. Knowledge of essences would only be possible by \"bracketing\" all assumptions about the existence of an external world and the inessential (subjective) aspects of how the object is concretely given to us. This procedure Husserl called \"epoché\".\n\nHusserl in a later period concentrated more on the ideal, essential structures of consciousness. As he wanted to exclude any hypothesis on the existence of external objects, he introduced the method of phenomenological reduction to eliminate them. What was left over was the pure transcendental ego, as opposed to the concrete empirical ego. Now Transcendental Phenomenology is the study of the essential structures that are left in pure consciousness: This amounts in practice to the study of the noemata and the relations among them. The philosopher Theodor Adorno criticised Husserl's concept of phenomenological epistemology in his metacritique \"Against Epistemology\", which is anti-foundationalist in its stance.\n\nTranscendental phenomenologists include Oskar Becker, Aron Gurwitsch, and Alfred Schütz.\n\nAfter Husserl's publication of the \"Ideen\" in 1913, many phenomenologists took a critical stance towards his new theories. Especially the members of the Munich group distanced themselves from his new transcendental phenomenology and preferred the earlier realist phenomenology of the first edition of the \"Logical Investigations\".\n\nRealist phenomenologists include Adolf Reinach, Alexander Pfänder, , Max Scheler, Roman Ingarden, Nicolai Hartmann, Dietrich von Hildebrand.\n\nExistential phenomenology differs from transcendental phenomenology by its rejection of the transcendental ego. Merleau-Ponty objects to the ego's transcendence of the world, which for Husserl leaves the world spread out and completely transparent before the conscious. Heidegger thinks of a conscious being as always already in the world. Transcendence is maintained in existential phenomenology to the extent that the method of phenomenology must take a presuppositionless starting point – transcending claims about the world arising from, for example, natural or scientific attitudes or theories of the ontological nature of the world.\n\nWhile Husserl thought of philosophy as a scientific discipline that had to be founded on a phenomenology understood as epistemology, Martin Heidegger held a radically different view. Heidegger himself states their differences this way:\n\nAccording to Heidegger, philosophy was not at all a scientific discipline, but more fundamental than science itself. According to him science is only one way of knowing the world with no special access to truth. Furthermore, the scientific mindset itself is built on a much more \"primordial\" foundation of practical, everyday knowledge. Husserl was skeptical of this approach, which he regarded as quasi-mystical, and it contributed to the divergence in their thinking.\n\nInstead of taking phenomenology as \"prima philosophia\" or a foundational discipline, Heidegger took it as a metaphysical ontology: \"\"being is the proper and sole theme of philosophy\"... this means that philosophy is not a science of beings but of being.\" Yet to confuse phenomenology and ontology is an obvious error. Phenomena are not the foundation or Ground of Being. Neither are they appearances, for, as Heidegger argues in \"Being and Time\", an appearance is \"that which shows itself in something else,\" while a phenomenon is \"that which shows itself in itself.\"\n\nWhile for Husserl, in the epoché, being appeared only as a correlate of consciousness, for Heidegger being is the starting point. While for Husserl we would have to abstract from all concrete determinations of our empirical ego, to be able to turn to the field of pure consciousness, Heidegger claims that \"the possibilities and destinies of philosophy are bound up with man's existence, and thus with temporality and with historicality.\"\n\nHowever, ontological being and existential being are different categories, so Heidegger's conflation of these categories is, according to Husserl's view, the root of Heidegger's error. Husserl charged Heidegger with raising the question of ontology but failing to answer it, instead switching the topic to the Dasein, the only being for whom Being is an issue. That is neither ontology nor phenomenology, according to Husserl, but merely abstract anthropology. To clarify, perhaps, by abstract anthropology, as a non-existentialist searching for essences, Husserl rejected the existentialism implicit in Heidegger's distinction between beings qua existents as things in reality and their Being as it unfolds in Dasein's own reflections on its being-in-the-world, wherein being becomes present to us, that is, is unconcealed.\n\nExistential phenomenologists include: Martin Heidegger (1889–1976), Hannah Arendt (1906–1975), Karl Jaspers (1883–1969), Emmanuel Levinas (1906–1995), Gabriel Marcel (1889–1973), Jean-Paul Sartre (1905–1980), Paul Ricoeur (1913–2005) and Maurice Merleau-Ponty (1908–1961).\n\nSome researchers in phenomenology (in particular in reference to Heidegger's legacy) see possibilities of establishing dialogues with traditions of thought outside of the so-called Western philosophy, particularly with respect to East-Asian thinking, and despite perceived differences between \"Eastern\" and \"Western\". Furthermore, it has been claimed that a number of elements within phenomenology (mainly Heidegger's thought) have some resonance with Eastern philosophical ideas, particularly with Zen Buddhism and Taoism. According to Tomonobu Imamichi, the concept of \"Dasein\" was inspired – although Heidegger remained silent on this – by Okakura Kakuzo's concept of \"das-in-der-Welt-sein\" (being in the world) expressed in \"The Book of Tea\" to describe Zhuangzi's philosophy, which Imamichi's teacher had offered to Heidegger in 1919, after having studied with him the year before.\n\nThere are also recent signs of the reception of phenomenology (and Heidegger's thought in particular) within scholarly circles focused on studying the impetus of metaphysics in the history of ideas in Islam and Early Islamic philosophy such as in the works of the Lebanese philosopher Nader El-Bizri; perhaps this is tangentially due to the indirect influence of the tradition of the French Orientalist and phenomenologist Henri Corbin, and later accentuated through El-Bizri's dialogues with the Polish phenomenologist Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka.\n\nIn addition, the work of Jim Ruddy in the field of comparative philosophy, combined the concept of Transcendental Ego in Husserl's phenomenology with the concept of the primacy of self-consciousness in the work of Sankaracharya. In the course of this work, Ruddy uncovered a wholly new eidetic phenomenological science, which he called \"convergent phenomenology.\" This new phenomenology takes over where Husserl left off, and deals with the constitution of relation-like, rather than merely thing-like, or \"intentional\" objectivity.\n\nJames Moor has argued that computers show up policy vacuums that require new thinking and the establishment of new policies. Others have argued that the resources provided by classical ethical theory such as utilitarianism, consequentialism and deontological ethics is more than enough to deal with all the ethical issues emerging from our design and use of information technology.\n\nFor the phenomenologist the 'impact view' of technology as well as the constructivist view of the technology/society relationships is valid but not adequate (Heidegger 1977, Borgmann 1985, Winograd and Flores 1987, Ihde 1990, Dreyfus 1992, 2001). They argue that these accounts of technology, and the technology/society relationship, posit technology and society as if speaking about the one does not immediately and already draw upon the other for its ongoing sense or meaning. For the phenomenologist, society and technology co-constitute each other; they are each other's ongoing condition, or possibility for being what they are. For them technology is not just the artifact. Rather, the artifact already emerges from a prior 'technological' attitude towards the world (Heidegger 1977).\n\nFor Heidegger the essence of technology is the way of being of modern humans—a way of conducting themselves towards the world—that sees the world as something to be ordered and shaped in line with projects, intentions and desires—a 'will to power' that manifests itself as a 'will to technology'.\nHeidegger claims that there were other times in human history, a pre-modern time, where humans did not orient themselves towards the world in a technological way—simply as resources for our purposes.\n\nHowever, according to Heidegger this 'pre-technological' age (or mood) is one where humans' relation with the world and artifacts, their way of being disposed, was poetic and aesthetic rather than technological (enframing). There are many who disagree with Heidegger's account of the modern technological attitude as the 'enframing' of the world. For example, Andrew Feenberg argues that Heidegger's account of modern technology is not borne out in contemporary everyday encounters with technology. Christian Fuchs has written on the anti-Semitism rooted in Heidegger's view of technology.\n\nIn critiquing the artificial intelligence (AI) programme, Hubert Dreyfus (1992) argues that the way skill development has become understood in the past has been wrong. He argues, this is the model that the early artificial intelligence community uncritically adopted. In opposition to this view, he argues, with Heidegger, that what we observe when we learn a new skill in everyday practice is in fact the opposite. We most often start with explicit rules or preformulated approaches and then move to a multiplicity of particular cases, as we become an expert. His argument draws directly on Heidegger's account in \"Being and Time\" of humans as beings that are always already situated in-the-world. As humans 'in-the-world', we are already experts at going about everyday life, at dealing with the subtleties of every particular situation; that is why everyday life seems so obvious. Thus, the intricate expertise of everyday activity is forgotten and taken for granted by AI as an assumed starting point.\nWhat Dreyfus highlighted in his critique of AI was the fact that technology (AI algorithms) does not make sense by itself. It is the assumed, and forgotten, horizon of everyday practice that makes technological devices and solutions show up as meaningful. If we are to understand technology we need to 'return' to the horizon of meaning that made it show up as the artifacts we need, want and desire. We need to consider how these technologies reveal (or disclose) us.\n\n\n\n"}

PNS was developed in the 1990s by Silvio Funtowicz and Jerome R. Ravetz. It can be considered as a reaction to the styles of analysis based on risk and cost-benefit analysis prevailing at that time, and as an embodiment of concepts of a new \"critical science\" developed in previous works by the same authors. In a more recent work PNS is described as \"the stage where we are today, where all the comfortable assumptions about science, its production and its use, are in question\".\n\nIn 1962, Thomas Kuhn's \"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\" introduced the concept of normal science as part of his theory that scientific knowledge progresses through socially constructed paradigm shifts, where normal science is what most scientists do all the time and what all scientists do most of the time. The process of a paradigm shift is essentially as follows:\n\nAn illustration of the theory in practice is the Copernican revolution, where Copernicus’ idea of a (sun-centered) solar system was largely ignored (not in the rules) when first introduced; then Galileo was deemed a heretic for supporting the idea (rules called into question); and finally, after a revolution in cosmology, the solar system became an obvious and foundational part of scientific knowledge (new rules).\n\nAnother example is the question of whether light is a particle or a wave. For a long time there was debate on this point. Advocates on both sides had many valid arguments based on scientific evidence but were lacking a theory that would resolve the conflict. After a revolution in thinking, it was realized that both perspectives could be true.\n\nPhysicist and policy adviser James J. Kay described post-normal science as a process that recognizes the potential for gaps in knowledge and understanding that cannot be resolved in ways other than revolutionary science. He argued that (between revolutions) one should not necessarily attempt to resolve or dismiss contradictory perspectives of the world, whether they are based on science or not, but instead incorporate multiple viewpoints into the same problem-solving process. From the ecological perspective post-normal science can be situated in the context of 'crisis disciplines' – a term coined by the conservation biologist Michael E. Soulé to indicate approaches addressing fears, emerging in the seventies, that the world was on the verge of ecological collapse. In this respect Michael Egan defines PNS as a 'survival science'.\n\nMoving from PNS Ziauddin Sardar developed the concept of Postnormal Times (PNT). Sardar was the editor of FUTURES when it published the article ‘Science for the post-normal age’ presently the most cited paper of the journal . A recent review of academic literature conducted on the Web of Science and encompassing the topics of Futures studies, Foresight, Forecasting and Anticipation Practice identifies the same paper as \"the all-time publication that received the highest number of citations\". \n\n\"At birth Post-normal science was conceived as an inclusive set of robust insights more than as an exclusive fully structured theory or field of practice\". Some of the ideas underpinning PNS can already be found in a work published in 1983 and entitled \"Three types of risk assessment: a methodological analysis\" This and subsequent works show that PNS concentrates on few aspects of the complex relation between science and policy: the communication of uncertainty, the assessment of quality, and the justification and practice of the extended peer communities.\n\nThe horizontal axis represents ‘Systems Uncertainties’ and the vertical one ‘Decision Stakes’. The three quadrants identify Applied Science, Professional Consultancy, and Post-Normal Science. Different standards of quality and styles of analysis are appropriate to different regions in the diagram, i.e. Post-normal science does not claim relevance and cogency on all of science's application but only on those defined by the PNS's mantram with a fourfold challenge: : ‘facts uncertain, values in dispute, stakes high and decisions urgent’. For applied research science’s own peer quality control system will suffice (or so was assumed at the moment PNS was formulated in the early nineties), while professional consultancy was considered appropriate for these settings which cannot be ‘peer-reviewed’, and where the skills and the tacit knowledge of a practitioner are needed at the forefront, e.g. in a surgery room, or in a house on fire. Here a surgeon or a fireman takes a difficult technical decision based on her or his training and appreciation of the situation (the Greek concept of ‘Metis (mythology)’).\n\nThere are important linkages between PNS and complexity science, e.g. system ecology (C. S. Holling) and hierarchy theory (Arthur Koestler). In PNS, complexity is respected through its recognition of a multiplicity of legitimate perspectives on any issue; and reflexivity is realised through the extension of accepted ‘facts’ beyond the supposedly objective productions of traditional research. Also, the new participants in the process are not treated as passive learners at the feet of the experts, being coercively convinced through scientific demonstration. Rather, they will form an ‘extended peer community’, sharing the work of quality assurance of the scientific inputs to the process, and arriving at a resolution of issues through debate and dialogue.\n\nPNS concept of extended peer community moves from and transcends the familiar concept of scientific peer community relative to a well-defined field of scientific research.\nThe peer community is extended in two respects: first, more than one discipline is assumed to have a potential bearing on the issue being debated, thereby providing different lenses to consider the problem. Second the community is extended to lay actors, taken to be all those with stakes, or an interest, in the given issue. Perhaps the best justification of the concept is offered by Paul Feyerabend in Against Method . For Feyerabend the participation of experts together with non-experts would allow the citizens to mature, inter alia by realizing that the experts are themselves lay-people outside their restricted field of competence. For Giandomenico Majone \"In any area of public policy the choice of instruments, far from being a technical exercise that can be safely delegated to the experts, reflects as in a microcosm all the political, moral, and cultural dimensions of policy-making.\" The same author notes: \"Dialectical confrontation between generalists and experts often succeeds in bringing out unstated assumptions, conflicting interpretations of the facts, and the risks posed by the projects\". These considerations justifies the need for an extended peer community, as the arena where the policy instruments and options can be discussed with - but without deference to - the experts and the authorities. \n\nThe lay members of the community thus constituted may also take upon themselves active 'research' tasks; this has happened e.g. in the so-called 'popular epidemiology' , when the official authorities have shown reticence to perform investigations deemed necessary by the communities affected - for example - by a case of air or water pollution , and more recently ‘citizen science’ . The extended community can usefully investigate the quality of the scientific assessments provided by the experts, the definition of the problem, as well as research priorities and research questions .\n\nThus, the extension of the peer community is not only ethically fair or politically correct, but also enhances the quality of the relevant science. An example is provided by Brian Wynne, who discusses the Cumbrian sheep farmers' interaction with scientist and authorities in the relation to the Chernobyl radioactive fallout .\n\nBeside its dominating influence in the literature on 'futures', PNS is considered to have influenced the ecological ‘conservation versus preservation debate’, especially via its reading by American pragmatist Bryan G. Norton. According to Jozef Keulartz the PNS concept of \"extended peer community\" influenced how Norton's developed his 'convergence hypothesis'. The hypothesis posits that ecologists of different orientation will converge once they start thinking 'as a mountain', or as a planet. For Norton this will be achieved via deliberative democracy, which will pragmatically overcome the black and white divide between conservationists and preservationists.\n\nOther authors attribute to PNS the role of having stimulated the take up of transdisciplinary methodological frameworks, reliant on the social constructivist perspective embedded in PNS.\n\nToday Post-normal science is intended as applicable to most instances where the use of evidence is contested due to different norms and values.\n\nAs summarized in a recent work \"the ideas and concepts of post normal science bring about the emergence of new problem solving strategies in which the role of science is appreciated in its full context of the complexity and the uncertainty of natural systems and the relevance of human commitments and values.\n\nFor Peter Gluckman (2014), chief science advisor to the Prime Minister of New Zealand, post normal science approaches are today appropriate for a host of problems including \"eradication of exogenous pests […], offshore oil prospecting, legalization of recreational psychotropic drugs, water quality, family violence, obesity, teenage morbidity and suicide, the ageing population, the prioritization of early-childhood education, reduction of agricultural greenhouse gases, and balancing economic growth and environmental sustainability\".\nFor Carrozza PNS can be \"framed in terms of a call for the ‘democratization of expertise’\", and as a \"reaction against long-term trends of ‘scientization’ of politics—the tendency towards assigning to experts a critical role in policymaking while marginalizing laypeople\". For Mike Hulme (2007), writing on \"The Guardian\" Climate change seems falls into the category of issues which are best dealt with in the context of PNS and notes that \"Disputes in post-normal science focus as often on the process of science - who gets funded, who evaluates quality, who has the ear of policy - as on the facts of science\". Recent reviews of the history and evolution of PNS, its definitions, conceptualizations,\nand uses can be found in Turnpenny et al., 2010, and in The Routledge Handbook of Ecological Economics (Nature and Society). There has been recently an increased reference to post-normal science, e.g. in Nature (journal).\n\nA criticism of post-normal science is offered by Weingart (1997) for whom Post-normal science does not introduce a new epistemology but retraces earlier debates linked to the so-called \"finalization thesis\".\n\nThe journal FUTURES devoted several specials issues to PNS.\n\n\n\nAnother special issue on Post Normal Science was published on the journal Science, Technology & Human Values in May 2011.\n\nMore titles and links relative to PNS special issues are available at the NUSAP net.\n\nA group of scholars of PNS orientation has published in 2016 a volume on the quality control crisis of science. The volume discusses \"inter alia\" what this community perceive as the root causes of the present crisis.\n\nAmong the quantitative styles of analysis which make reference to post-normal science one can mention NUSAP for numerical information, sensitivity auditing for indicators and mathematical modelling and MUSIASEM in the field of social metabolism.\n\nIn relation to mathematical modelling PNS suggests a participatory approach, whereby ‘models to predict and control the future’ are replaced by ‘models to map our ignorance about the future’, in the process exploring and revealing the metaphors embedded in the model. PNS is also known for the its definition of GIGO: in modelling GIGO occurs when the uncertainties in the inputs must be suppressed, lest the outputs become completely indeterminate. \n\n\n\n"}

Prajñāpāramitā is a central concept in Mahāyāna Buddhism and is generally associated with the doctrine of emptiness (Shunyata) or 'lack of Svabhava' (essence) and the works of Nagarjuna. Its practice and understanding are taken to be indispensable elements of the Bodhisattva path.\n\nAccording to Edward Conze, the Prajñāpāramitā Sutras are \"a collection of about forty texts ... composed somewhere around Indian subcontinent between approximately 100 BC and AD 600.\" Some Prajnāpāramitā sūtras are thought to be among the earliest Mahāyāna sūtras.\n\nOne of the important features of the Prajñāpāramitā Sutras is anutpada (unborn, no origin).\n\nWestern scholars have traditionally considered the earliest sūtra in the Prajñāpāramitā class to be the \"Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra\" or \"Perfection of Wisdom in 8,000 Lines\", which was probably put in writing in the 1st century BCE. This chronology is based on the views of Edward Conze, who largely considered dates of translation into other languages. This text also has a corresponding version in verse format, called the \"\", which some believe to be slightly older because it is not written in standard literary Sanskrit. However, these findings rely on late-dating Indian texts, in which verses and mantras are often kept in more archaic forms.\n\nAdditionally, a number of scholars have proposed that the Mahāyāna Prajñāpāramitā teachings were first developed by the Caitika subsect of the Mahāsāṃghikas. They believe that the \"Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra\" originated amongst the southern Mahāsāṃghika schools of the Āndhra region, along the Kṛṣṇa River. These Mahāsāṃghikas had two famous monasteries near Amarāvati and the Dhānyakataka, which gave their names to the Pūrvaśaila and Aparaśaila schools. Each of these schools had a copy of the \"Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra\" in Prakrit. Guang Xing also assesses the view of the Buddha given in the \"Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra\" as being that of the Mahāsāṃghikas. Edward Conze estimates that this sūtra originated around 100 BCE.\n\nIn 2012, Harry Falk and Seishi Karashima published a damaged and partial Kharoṣṭhī manuscript of the \"Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā\". It is radiocarbon dated to ca. 75 CE, making it one of the oldest Buddhist texts in existence. It is very similar to the first Chinese translation of the \"Aṣṭasāhasrikā\" by Lokakṣema (ca. 179 CE) whose source text is assumed to be in the Gāndhārī language;Lokakṣema's translation is also the first extant translation of the Prajñāpāramitā genre into a non-Indic language. Comparison with the standard Sanskrit text shows that it is also likely to be a translation from Gāndhāri as it expands on many phrases and provides glosses for words that are not present in the Gāndhārī. This points to the text being composed in Gāndhārī, the language of Gandhara (the region now called the Northwest Frontier of Pakistan, including Peshawar, Taxila and Swat Valley). The \"Split\" manuscript is evidently a copy of an earlier text, confirming that the text may date before the first century of the common era.\nIn contrast to western scholarship, Japanese scholars have traditionally considered the \"Diamond Sūtra\" (\"Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra\") to be from a very early date in the development of Prajñāpāramitā literature. The usual reason for this relative chronology which places the \"Vajracchedikā\" earlier is not its date of translation, but rather a comparison of the contents and themes. Some western scholars also believe that the \"Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra\" was adapted from the earlier \"Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra\".\n\nExamining the language and phrases used in both the \"Aṣṭasāhasrikā\" and the \"Vajracchedikā\", Gregory Schopen also sees the \"Vajracchedikā\" as being earlier than the \"Aṣṭasāhasrikā\". This view is taken in part by examining parallels between the two works, in which the \"Aṣṭasāhasrikā\" seems to represent the later or more developed position. According to Schopen, these works also show a shift in emphasis from an oral tradition (\"Vajracchedikā\") to a written tradition (\"Aṣṭasāhasrikā\").\n\nAn Indian commentary on the \"Mahāyānasaṃgraha\", entitled \"Vivṛtaguhyārthapiṇḍavyākhyā\", gives a classification of teachings according to the capabilities of the audience:\nThe titles of these eight Prajñāpāramitā texts are given according to their length. The texts may have other Sanskrit titles as well, or different variations which may be more descriptive. The lengths specified by the titles are given below.\n\n\nAccording to Joseph Walser, there is evidence that the \"Pañcaviṃśatisāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra\" (25,000 lines) and the \"Śatasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra\" (100,000 lines) have a connection with the Dharmaguptaka sect, while the \"Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra\" (8000 lines) does not.\n\nIn addition to these, there are also other Prajñāpāramitā sūtras such as the \"Heart Sutra\" (\"Prajñāpāramitā Hṛdaya\"), which exists in a shorter and longer versions. Regarding the shorter texts, Edward Conze writes, \"Two of these, the \"Diamond Sūtra\" and the \"Heart Sūtra\" are in a class by themselves and deservedly renowned throughout the world of Northern Buddhism. Both have been translated into many languages and have often been commented upon.\". Some scholars consider the Diamond Sutra to be much earlier than Conze does. Scholar Jan Nattier argues the Heart Sutra to be an apocryphal text composed in China from extracts of the Pañcaviṃśatisāhasrikā and other texts ca 7th century. Red Pine, however, does not support Nattiers argument and believes the Prajnaparamita Hridaya Sutra to be of Indian origin.\n\nTāntric versions of the Prajñāpāramitā literature were produced from the year 500 CE on and include sutras such as the Adhyardhaśatikā Prajñāpāramitā (150 lines). Additionally, Prajñāpāramitā terma teachings are held by some Tibetan Buddhists to have been conferred upon Nāgārjuna by the Nāgarāja \"King of the Nāgas\", who had been guarding them at the bottom of the sea.\n\nThere are various Indian and later Chinese commentaries on the Prajñāpāramitā sutras, some of the most influential commentaries include:\n\n\nThe sutras were first brought to Tibet in the reign of Trisong Detsen (742-796) by scholars Jinamitra and Silendrabodhi and the translator Yeshe De.\n\nBy the middle of the 3rd century CE, it appears that some Prajñāpāramitā texts were known in Central Asia, as reported by the Chinese monk Zhu Shixing, who brought back a manuscript of the \"Prajñāpāramitā\" of 25,000 lines:\n\nIn China, there was extensive translations of many Prajñāpāramitā texts beginning in the second century CE, main translators include: Lokakṣema (支婁迦讖), Zhī Qīan (支謙), Dharmarakṣa (竺法護), Mokṣala (無叉羅), Kumārajīva (鳩摩羅什, 408 CE), Xuánzàng (玄奘), Făxián (法賢) and Dānapāla (施護). These translations were very influential in the development of East Asian Mādhyamaka and on Chinese Buddhism.\n\nXuanzang (fl. c. 602–664) was a Chinese scholar who traveled to India and returned to China with three copies of the \"Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra\" which he had secured from his extensive travels. Xuanzang, with a team of disciple translators, commenced translating the voluminous work in 660 CE using the three versions to ensure the integrity of the source documentation. Xuanzang was being encouraged by a number of the disciple translators to render an abridged version. After a suite of dreams quickened his decision, Xuanzang determined to render an unabridged, complete volume, faithful to the original of 600 fascicles.\n\nThere are also later commentaries from Zen Buddhists on the Heart and Diamond sutra and Kūkai's commentary (9th century) is the first known Tantric commentary.\n\nA key theme of the Prajñāpāramitā sutras is the figure of the Bodhisattva (literally: awakening-being) which is defined in the 8,000 line PP sutra as:\n\nA Bodhisattva is then a being that experiences everything \"without attachment\" (\"asakti\") and sees reality or suchness (\"Tathātā\") as it is. The Bodhisattva is the main ideal in Mahayana (Great Vehicle), which sees the goal of the Buddhist path as becoming a Buddha for the sake of all sentient beings, not just yourself:\n\nA central quality of the Bodhisattva is their practice of Prajñāpāramitā, a most deep (\"gambhīra\") state of knowledge which is an understanding of reality arising from analysis as well as meditative insight. It is non-conceptual and non-dual (\"advaya\") as well as transcendental. Literally, the term could be translated as \"knowledge gone to the other (shore)\", or transcendental knowledge. The PP sutra in 8000 lines says:\n\nA further passage in the 8,000 line PP sutra states that Prajñāpāramitā means that a Bodhisattva stands in emptiness (shunyata) by not standing (\"√sthā\") or supporting themselves on any dharma (phenomena), whether conditioned or unconditioned. The dharmas that a Bodhisattva does \"not stand\" on include standard listings such as: the five aggregates, the sense fields (ayatana), nirvana, Buddhahood, etc. This is explained by stating that Bodhisattvas \"wander without a home\" (\"aniketacārī\"); \"home\" or \"abode\" meaning signs (\"nimitta\", meaning a subjective mental impression) of sensory objects and the afflictions that arise dependent on them. This includes the absence, the \"not taking up\" (\"aparigṛhīta\") of even \"correct\" mental signs and perceptions such as \"form is not self\", \"I practice Prajñāpāramitā\", etc. To be freed of all constructions and signs, to be signless (\"animitta\") is to be empty of them and this is to stand in Prajñāpāramitā. The PP sutras state that all Buddhas and Bodhisattvas in the past have practiced Prajñāpāramitā. Prajñāpāramitā is also associated with \"Sarvajñata\" (all-knowledge) in the PP sutras, a quality of the mind of a Buddha which knows the nature of all dharmas.\n\nAccording to Karl Brunnholzl, Prajñāpāramitā means that \"all phenomena from form up through omniscience being utterly devoid of any intrinsic characteristics or nature of their own.\" Furthermore, \"such omniscient wisdom is always nonconceptual and free from reference points since it is the constant and panoramic awareness of the nature of all phenomena and does not involve any shift between meditative equipoise and subsequent attainment.\"\n\nEdward Conze outlined several psychological qualities of a Bodhisattva's practice of Prajñāpāramitā:\n\n\nThe PP sutras also teach of the importance of the other paramitas (perfections) for the Bodhisattva such as Ksanti (patience): \"Without resort to this patience (kṣānti) they [bodhisattvas] cannot reach their respective goals\". \n\nAnother quality of the Bodhisattva is their freedom from fear (\"na √tras\") in the face of the seemingly shocking doctrine of the emptiness of all dharmas which includes their own existence. A good friend (\"kalyanamitra\") is useful in the path to fearlessness. Bodhisattvas also have no pride or self-conception (\"na manyeta\") of their own stature as Bodhisattvas. These are important features of the mind of a bodhisattva, called bodhicitta. The PP sutras also mention that bodhicitta is a middle way, it is neither apprehended as existent (\"astitā\") or non-existent (\"nāstitā\") and it is \"immutable\" (\"avikāra\") and \"free from conceptualization\" (\"avikalpa\").\n\nThe Bodhisattva is said to generate \"great compassion\" (\"maha-karuṇā\") for all beings on their path to liberation and yet also maintain a sense of equanimity (upekṣā) and distance from them through their understanding of emptiness, due to which, the Bodhisattva knows that even after bringing countless beings to nirvana, \"no living being whatsoever has been brought to nirvana.\" Bodhisattvas and Mahāsattvas are also willing to give up all of their meritorious deeds for sentient beings and develop skillful means (upaya) in order to help abandon false views and teach them the Dharma. The practice of Prajñāpāramitā allows a Bodhisattva to become: \n\n\"a saviour of the helpless, a defender of the defenceless, a refuge to those without refuge, a place to rest to those without resting place, the final relief of those who are without it, an island to those without one, a light to the blind, a guide to the guideless, a resort to those without one and...guide to the path those who have lost it, and you shall become a support to those who are without support.\"\n\n\"Tathātā\" (Suchness or Thusness) and the related term \"Dharmatā\" (the nature of Dharma), and Tathāgata are also important terms of the PP texts. To practice Prajñāpāramitā means to practice in accord with 'the nature of Dharma' and to see the Tathāgata (i.e. the Buddha). As the 8000 line PP sutra states, these terms are generally used equivalently: \"As the suchness (\"tathatā\") of dharmas is immovable (\"acalitā\"), and the suchness (\"tathatā\") of dharmas is the \"Tathāgata\".\". The Tathāgata is said in the 8000 line PP sutra to \"neither come nor go\". Furthermore, the 8000 line PP sutra includes a list of synonyms associated with Tathāgata as also being \"beyond coming and going\", these include: 1. Suchness (\"tathatā\"); 2. Unarisen (\"anutpāda\"); 3. Reality limit (\"bhūtakoṭi\"); 4. Śūnyatā; 5. Division (\"yathāvatta\"); 6. Detachment (\"virāga\"); 7. Cessation (\"nirodha\"); 8. Space element (\"ākāśadhātu\"). The sutra then states:\n\nApart from these dharmas, there is no Tathāgata. The suchness of these dharmas, and the suchness of the Tathāgatas, is all one single suchness (\"ekaivaiṣā tathatā\"), not two, not divided (\"dvaidhīkāraḥ\"). … beyond all classification (\"gaṇanāvyativṛttā\"), due to non-existence (\"asattvāt\").\n\nSuchness then does not come or go because like the other terms, it is not a real entity (\"bhūta\", \"svabhāva\"), but merely appears conceptually through dependent origination, like a dream or an illusion. \n\nEdward Conze lists six ways in which the ontological status of dharmas is considered by the Prajñāpāramitā:\n\n\nIt is through seeing this Tathātā that one is said to have a vision of the Buddha (the Tathāgata), seeing this is called seeing the Buddha's Dharmakaya (Dharma body) which is a not his physical body, but none other than the true nature of dharmas.\n\nMost modern Buddhist scholars such as Lamotte, Conze and Yin Shun have seen Śūnyatā (emptiness, voidness, hollowness) as \"the\" central theme of the PP sutras. Edward Conze writes:\n\nIt is now the principal teaching of Prajñāpāramitā with regard to own-being that it is \"empty.\" The Sanskrit term is \"svabhāva-śūnya\". This is a \"tatpuruṣa\" compound (one in which the last member is qualified by the first without losing its grammatical independence), in which svabhava may have the sense of any oblique case. The Mahayana understands it to mean that dharmas are empty of any own-being, i.e.,that they are not ultimate facts in their own right, but merely imagined and falsely discriminated, for each and every one of them is dependent on something other than itself. From a slightly different angle this means that dharmas, when viewed with perfected gnosis, reveal an own-being which is identical with emptiness, i.e in their own-being they are empty.\n\nThe PP sutras commonly use apophatic statements to express the nature of reality as seen by Prajñāpāramitā. A common trope in the Prajñāpāramitā sutras is the negation of a previous statement in the form 'A is not A, therefore it is A', or more often negating only a part of the statement as in, “XY is a Y-less XY”. Japanese Buddhologist, Hajime Nakamura, calls this negation the 'logic of not' (\"na prthak\"). An example from the Diamond sutra of this use of negation is:\n\nThe rationale behind this form is the juxtaposition of conventional truth with ultimate truth as taught in the Buddhist two truths doctrine. The negation of conventional truth is supposed to expound the ultimate truth of the emptiness (Śūnyatā) of all reality - the idea that nothing has an ontological essence and all things are merely conceptual, without substance. \n\nThe PP sutras state that dharmas should not be conceptualized either as existent, nor as non existent, and use negation to highlight this: \"in the way in which dharmas exist (\"saṃvidyante\"), just so do they not exist (\"asaṃvidyante\")\".\n\nThe PP sutras commonly state that all dharmas (phenomena), are in some way like an illusion (\"māya\"), like a dream (\"svapna\") and like a mirage. The \"Diamond Sutra\" states: \n\nEven the highest Buddhist goals like Buddhahood and Nirvana are to be seen in this way, thus the highest wisdom or prajña is a type of spiritual knowledge which sees all things as illusory. As Subhuti in the 8000 line PP sutra states:\n\nThis is connected to the impermanence and insubstantial nature of dharmas. The PP sutras give the simile of a magician (\"māyākāra\": 'illusion-maker') who, when seemingly killing his illusory persons by cutting off their heads, really kills nobody and compare it to the bringing of beings to awakening (by 'cutting off' the conceptualization of self view; Skt: \"ātmadṛṣṭi chindati\") and the fact that this is also ultimately like an illusion, because their aggregates \"are neither bound nor released\". The illusion then, is the conceptualization and mental fabrication of dharmas as existing or not existing, as arising or not arising. Prajñāpāramitā sees through this illusion, being empty of concepts and fabrications. \n\nPerceiving dharmas and beings like an illusion (\"māyādharmatām\") is termed the \"great armor\" (\"mahāsaṃnaha\") of the Bodhisattva, who is also termed the 'illusory man' (\"māyāpuruṣa\").\n\nAccording to Paul Williams, another major theme of the PP sutras is \"the phenomenon of laudatory self reference – the lengthy praise of the sutra itself, the immense merits to be obtained from treating even a verse of it with reverence, and the nasty penalties which will accrue in accordance with karma to those who denigrate the scripture.\"\n\nAccording to Edward Conze, the PP sutras added much new doctrinal material in the later layers and the larger texts. Conze lists the later accretions as:\n\n\nThe Prajnaparamita is often personified as a \"bodhisattvadevi\" (female bodhisattva). Artifacts from Nalanda depict the Prajnaparamita personified as a deity. The depiction of Prajnaparamita as a Yidam deity can also be found in ancient Java and Cambodian art.\n\nMahayana Buddhism took root in ancient Java Sailendra court in the 8th century CE. The Mahayana reverence of female buddhist deity started with the cult of Tara enshrined in the 8th century Kalasan temple in Central Java. Some of Prajnaparamita's important functions and attributes can be traced to those of the goddess Tara. Tara and Prajnaparamita are both referred to as mothers of all Buddhas, since Buddhas are born from wisdom. The Sailendra dynasty was also the ruling family of Srivijaya in Sumatra. During the reign of the third Pala king Devapala (815-854) in India, Srivijaya Maharaja Balaputra of Sailendras also constructed one of Nalanda’s main monasteries in India itself. Thereafter manuscript editions of the \"Ashtasahasrika Prajnaparamita Sutra\" circulating in Sumatra and Java instigated the cult of the Goddess of Transcendent Wisdom.\n\nIn the 13th century, the tantric buddhism gained royal patronage of king Kertanegara of Singhasari, and thereafter some of Prajnaparamita statues were produced in the region, such as the Prajnaparamita of Singhasari in East Java and Prajnaparamita of Muaro Jambi Regency, Sumatra. Both of East Java and Jambi Prajnaparamitas bear resemblance in style as they were produced in same period, however unfortunately Prajnaparamita of Jambi is headless and was discovered in poor condition.\n\nThe statue of Prajnaparamita of East Java is probably the most famous depiction of the goddess of transcendental wisdom, and is considered the masterpiece of classical ancient Java Hindu-Buddhist art in Indonesia. It was discovered in the Cungkup Putri ruins near Singhasari temple, Malang, East Java. Today the beautiful and serene statue is displayed on 2nd floor Gedung Arca, National Museum of Indonesia, Jakarta.\n\n\n"}

The title is derived from a central scene where the damsel shares a pear which she has peeled with her teeth with the lover.\n\nThe text is preserved in BnF Ms. fr. 2186, an illuminated manuscript dated to the 1250s. It was illustrated in the workshop of the \"maître de Bari\" (so named after a gradual now at San Nicola, Bari), which is known to have been active in Paris during the 1250s. The text itself would on internal evidence be dated to between about 1230 and 1285, so that it is rather certain that the manuscript is the one used for the original presentation of the text and that the text's composition dates to the mid 13th century (Tesnière 1987). \nThe manuscript extends to 83 folia, measuring 205 x 135 mm.

{"id": "12178732", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12178732", "title": "Sacred", "text": "Sacred\n\nSacred is dedicated or set apart for the service or worship of a deity or considered worthy of spiritual respect or devotion; or inspiring awe or reverence among believers. The property is often ascribed to objects (a \"sacred artifact\" that is venerated and blessed), or places (\"sacred ground\").\n\nFrench sociologist Émile Durkheim considered the dichotomy between the sacred and the profane to be the central characteristic of religion: \"religion is a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to \"sacred things\", that is to say, things set apart and forbidden.\" In Durkheim's theory, the sacred represented the interests of the group, especially unity, which were embodied in sacred group symbols, or totems. The profane, on the other hand, involved mundane individual concerns.\n\nAlthough there are similarities between the terms \"sacred\" and \"holy\" and they are sometimes used interchangeably, there are subtle differences. \"Holiness\" is generally the term used in relation to persons and relationship, while \"sacredness\" is used in relation to objects, places, or happenings. Thus a saint may be considered as holy, but he is not viewed as sacred.\n\nThe word \"sacred\" descends from the Latin \"sacer\", that is consecrated, or dedicated to the gods or anything in their power, and to \"sacerdos\" and \"sanctum\", set apart.\n\nAlthough there are similarities between the terms \"sacred\" and \"holy\" and they are sometimes used interchangeably, there are subtle differences. \"Holiness\" is generally the term used in relation to persons and relationship, while \"sacredness\" is used in relation to objects, places, or happenings. Thus a saint may be considered as holy, but he is not viewed as sacred. However, there are things that are both holy and sacred such as the holy bible.\n\nThe English word \"holy\" dates back to at least the 11th century with the Old English word \"hālig\", an adjective derived from \"hāl\" meaning \"whole\" and used to mean \"uninjured, sound, healthy, entire, complete\". The Scottish \"hale\" (\"health, happiness and wholeness\") is the most complete modern form of this Old English root. The word \"holy\" in its modern form appears in Wycliffe's Bible of 1382. In non-specialist contexts, the term \"holy\" is used in a more general way, to refer to someone or something that is associated with a divine power, such as water used for baptism.\n\nWhile both words denote something or someone set apart to the worship of God and therefore worthy of respect and in some cases veneration, \"holy\" (the stronger word) implies an inherent or essential character. Holiness originates in God and is communicated to things, places, times, and persons engaged in His Service. Thus Aquinas Thomas defines \"holiness\" as that virtue by which a man's mind applies itself and all its acts to God; he ranks it among the infused moral virtues, and identifies it with the virtue of religion, but with this difference that, whereas religion is the virtue whereby one offers God due service in the things which pertain to the Divine service, holiness is the virtue by which one makes all one's acts subservient to God. Thus holiness or sanctity is the outcome of sanctification, that Divine act by which God freely justifies a person, and by which He has claimed them for His own.\n\nHierology (Greek ιερος, \"hieros\", \"sacred\" or \"holy\", + -logy) is the study of sacred literature or lore.\n\nMircea Eliade outlines that religion should not be interpreted only as 'belief in deities', but as 'experience of the sacred'. He analyses the dialectic of the sacred. The sacred is presented in relation to the profane. The relation between the sacred and the profane is not of opposition, but of complementarity, as the profane is viewed as a hierophany.\n\nFrench sociologist Émile Durkheim considered the dichotomy between the sacred and the profane to be the central characteristic of religion: \"religion is a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to \"sacred things\", that is to say, things set apart and forbidden.\" In Durkheim's theory, the sacred represented the interests of the group, especially unity, which were embodied in sacred group symbols, or totems. The profane, on the other hand, involved mundane individual concerns. Durkheim explicitly stated that the dichotomy sacred/profane was not equivalent to good/evil. The sacred could be good or evil, and the profane could be either as well.\n\nIn Theravada Buddhism one finds the designation of 'noble person' or \"ariyapuggala\" (Pali). The Buddha described four grades of such person depending on their level of purity. This purity is measured by which of the ten fetters (\"samyojana\") and \"klesha\" have been purified and integrated from the mindstream. These persons are called (in order of increasing sanctity) \"Sotāpanna\", \"Sakadagami\", \"Anāgāmi\" and \"Arahant\".\n\nMore traditional denominations, such as the Anglican, Catholic, Lutheran, and Methodist Churches, believe in Holy Sacraments that the clergy perform, such as Holy Communion and Holy Baptism, as well as strong belief in the Holy Catholic Church, Holy Scripture, Holy Trinity, and the Holy Covenant. They also believe that angels and saints are called to holiness.\n\nCatholicism has inherited much of the Jewish vision of the world in terms of holiness, with certain behaviour appropriate to certain places and times. The calendar gives shape to Catholic practice, which tends to focus on the Eucharist, in which the Real Presence of Christ is manifested. Holy days, celebrating events of the life of Christ and the lives of Catholic saints officially recognized as holy, are celebrated throughout the year.\n\nMany features of the Jewish temple (although now seen as having Christian significance) are imitated in churches, such as the altar, bread, lamp, incense, font, etc., to emphasise the extreme holiness of the Eucharistic elements, which are reserved in a tabernacle. In extension of this focus on the Sacrament as holy, many objects in Catholicism are also considered holy. They are called sacramentals and are usually blessed by a priest. Such items include rosaries, crucifixes, medals, and statues and icons of Jesus, angels and saints (e.g. Virgin Mary). While Catholics believe that holy places and objects (i.e., objects dedicated to God for sacred use) should be respected and not put to profane use, the Catholic Church condemns worshiping the object itself, as any worship given to something other than God is considered idolatry.\n\nPeople in a state of sanctifying grace are also considered holy in Catholicism. A central notion of Catholicism as articulated in contemporary theology is the \"[personal] call to holiness,\" considered to be a vocation shared by every Christian believer. Profound personal holiness has traditionally also been seen as a focus for the kind of contagious holiness primarily associated with the Sacrament. So the communion of saints in Catholicism is not only the acclamation of their piety or morality, but also reverence for the tangible holiness that flows from their proximity to the divine. Hence the places where saints lived, died, performed miracles, or received visions frequently become sites of pilgrimage, and notable objects surviving a saint (including the body or parts of it) are considered relics. The holiness of such places or objects, resulting from contact with a deeply holy person, is often connected with the miraculous long after the death of the saint.\n\nSanctus (Latin for \"holy\") is the name of an important hymn of Christian liturgy. The Trisagion ('Thrice Holy') is a standard hymn of the Divine Liturgy of the Eastern Churches.\n\nThe early Protestant Reformers, who were often scholars of Ancient Greek and also borrowed from Jewish scholarship, recognized that holiness is an attribute of God, and holiness is always part of the presence of God. Yet they also recognized that \"practical holiness\" was the evidence of the presence of God in the converted believer. Martin Luther viewed God's grace (and therefore God's holiness), as an invasion of the life. Actions that demonstrated holiness would spring up, not premeditated, as believers focused more and more on their relationship with Christ. This was the life of faith, according to Luther; a life in which one recognizes that the sin inherent in human nature never departs, yet grace invades each human spirit and draws each person after Christ.\n\nCalvin, on the other hand, formulated a practical system of holiness that even tied in with culture and social justice. All unholy actions, Calvin reasoned, resulted in suffering. Thus he proved out to the city fathers of Geneva that dancing and other social vices always ended with the wealthy oppressing the poor. A holy life, in his outlook, was pietistic and simple, a life that shunned extravagance, excess, and vanity. On a personal level, Calvin believed that suffering would be a manifestation of taking on the Cross of Christ, but suffering was also part of the process of holiness. He expected that all Christians would suffer in this life, not as punishment, but rather as participation in union with Christ, who suffered for them. And yet, socially, Calvin argued that a holy society would end up as a gentle, kindly society (except to criminals) where the poor would be protected from the abuses of the wealthy, the lawyers, and others who normally preyed upon them.\n\nIn Methodism, holiness has acquired the secondary meaning of the reshaping of a person through spiritual rebirth. The term owes its origin to John Wesley, who stressed \"scriptural holiness\", as well as Christian perfection.\n\nThe Holiness movement began within Methodism in the United States, among those who thought the church had lost the zeal and emphasis on personal holiness of Wesley's day. In the latter part of the 19th century revival meetings were held, attended by thousands. In Vineland, N.J in 1867 a camp meeting was begun and the National Holiness Camp Meeting Association went on to establish many holiness camp meetings across the nation. Some adherents to the movement remained within their denominations; others founded new denominations, such as the Free Methodist Church, the Church of the Nazarene, and the Church of God (Anderson). Within a generation another movement, the Pentecostal movement was born, drawing heavily from the Holiness movement. Around the middle of the 20th century, the Conservative Holiness Movement, a conservative offshoot of the Holiness movement, was born. The Higher Life movement appeared in the British Isles during the mid-19th century.\n\nIn the contemporary Holiness movement, the idea that holiness is relational is growing. In this thought, the core notion of holiness is love. Other notions of holiness, such as purity, being set apart, perfection, keeping rules, and total commitment, are seen as contributory notions of holiness. These contributory notions find their ultimate legitimacy when love is at their core (Thomas Jay Oord and Michael Lodahl).\n\nCommonly recognized outward expressions or \"standards\" of holiness among more fundamental adherents frequently include applications relative to dress, hair, and appearance: e.g., short hair on men, uncut hair on women, and prohibitions against shorts, pants on women, make-up and jewelry. Other common injunctions are against places of worldly amusement, mixed swimming, smoking, minced oaths, as well as the eschewing of television and radio.\n\nAmong the names of God in the Qur'an is القدوس (\"Al-Quddus\") : found in and , the closest English translation is \"holy\" or \"sacred\". It shares the same triliteral Semitic root as the Hebrew \"kodesh\" (see below). Another use of the same root is found in the Arabic name for Jerusalem: \"al-Quds\", \"the Holy\".\n\nThe word حرام \"(ħarām)\", often translated as \"prohibited\" or \"forbidden\", is better understood as \"sacred\" or \"sanctuary\" in the context of places considered sacred in Islam, \"e. g.\": the \"Masjid al-Haram\", the Sacred Mosque in Mecca, constituting the immediate precincts of the Ka'aba; \"al-Haramain\" or \"the (two) Sanctuaries\", a reference to the twin holy cities of Mecca and Medina; and the \"Haram ash-Sharif\" or Noble Sanctuary, the precincts of the Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem.\n\nThe Hebrew word קֹדֶשׁ, transliterated as \"qodesh\", has been used in the Torah to mean set-apartness and separateness as well as holiness and sacredness. The Torah describes the Aaronite priests and the Levites as being selected by God to perform the Temple services; they, as well, are called \"holy.\" Some consider that the Hebrew noun for \"holiness,\" \"kedushah\" (), from the adjective \"kodesh\", \"holy,\" has the connotation of \"separateness\".\n\nHowever, holiness is not a single state, but contains a broad spectrum. The Mishnah lists concentric circles of holiness surrounding the Temple in Jerusalem: Holy of Holies, Temple Sanctuary, Temple Vestibule, Court of Priests, Court of Israelites, Court of Women, Temple Mount, the walled city of Jerusalem, all the walled cities of Israel, and the borders of the Land of Israel. Distinctions are made as to who and what are permitted in each area.\n\nLikewise, the Jewish holidays and the Shabbat are considered to be holy in time; the Torah calls them \"holy [days of] gathering\". Work is not allowed on those days, and rabbinic tradition lists 39 categories of activity that are specifically prohibited.\n\nBeyond the intrinsically holy, objects can become sacred through consecration. Any personal possession may be dedicated to the Temple of God, after which its misappropriation is considered among the gravest of sins. The various sacrifices are holy. Those that may be eaten have very specific rules concerning who may eat which of their parts, and time limits on when the consumption must be completed. Most sacrifices contain a part to be consumed by the priests – a portion of the holy to be consumed by God's holy devotees.\n\nThe encounter with the holy is seen as eminently desirable, and at the same time fearful and awesome. For the strongest penalties are applied to one who transgresses in this area – one could in theory receive either the death penalty or the heavenly punishment of \"kareth\", spiritual excision, for mis-stepping in his close approach to God's domain.\n\n"}

He specialised in logic, epistemology, ethics, metaphysics, mysticism, and metaphilosophy. As a philosopher he combined insights from Indian and Western Philosophies. Besides JDV, Pune, India, he has also taught at the Jesuit Philosophate, Kandy, Sri Lanka and Diocesan Seminary, Gozo, Malta.\n\nHe is famous for his new insights on mysticism and metaphilosophy. His ideas and insights have influenced many philosophers in India.\n\nSalvino, the fifth child of the Legal Procurator Philip Azzopardi and Giuseppina née Borg, and nephew of the servant of God, Eugenio Borg, his mother’s brother, was born on 20 June 1931 at Hamrun, Malta. He had his secondary schooling at the Lyceum and at an early age joined the “Lega”, the Hamrun Catholic Action “Milites Christi Regis”, where he became a catechist of the young aspirants.\n\nIn 1947, at the age of sixteen, Salvino joined the Society of Jesus at Naxxar, Malta, following in the footsteps of his elder brother Anton who had joined the Society two years ahead of him. He emitted his first vows in 1949 at Naxxar, and then followed the normal course of studies in the Society: two years literature at Naxxar, three years philosophy at Vals in France, a year’s prefecting the boys at St Aloysius’ College, Malta, and another year at Clongows College, Ireland. Then four years of theology at Heythrop College, Oxon, England, where he was ordained priest on 31 July 1959. Fr Salvino did his Third Year of Novitiate in Florence, Italy, after which, i.e. in 1961, he was sent to the Gregorian University in Rome where in 1963 he took his Doctorate in Philosophy “cum laude”.\n\nAfter all those years of intensive intellectual activity in India, Fr Salvino began to feel his health wane. So in 1990 his Superiors advised him to return to Malta to regain his health. The doctors in Malta sent him to London for a heart\nby-pass surgery, after which he had to spend over a year convalescing in Malta. Fr Salvino aspired to go back to India, but could not.\n\nFrom 2001 onwards, Fr Salvino at Loyola House, Naxxar, Malta, carried on with his studies in Sanskrit, Greek and Hebrew. He was also the House historian and put in charge of various small offices. When his health did not permit him to move about freely he stayed in bed and spent time in prayer, listened to classical music and watched DVD films on his computer.\nHis health grew worse. In 2006 the periodic but frequent severe bouts of stomach and pulmonary attacks made his life miserable. But he never lost his optimism, his cheerful smile and his hearty laugh, nor did he ever refuse to help anyone who asked for his assistance.\n\nOn 6 August 2006, the feast of Our Lord the Saviour, his namesake, Fr Salvino, feeling relatively well, accepted an invitation by his niece to lunch at her house. At about 3:00 p.m. he started feeling queer in his chest and hard to breathe. He was rushed back home, and the doctor ordered him straight to hospital. Fr Salvino, in bitter pain and hardly able to breathe, received the last rites and just after 9:00 p.m. he died.\n\nAzzopardi left Malta for Pune, India as a missionary in 1964.\nHe belonged to the Maltese Province of the Society of Jesus and was lent to Dumka-Raiganj Province (formerly Santal Region) of the Society of Jesus, Jharkhand, India.\n\nIn India, he was primarily involved in teaching philosophy at Jnana-Deepa Vidyapeeth, Pune. Then in 1988, due to ill health, he returned to Malta. Later for a brief period of time, he went to Sri Lanka to start the Jesuit philosophate there. He was recalled to be made the rector of Gozzo Seminary. He died in 2006, at Naxxar, Malta.\n\n\n"}

He was imprisoned several times for his controversial beliefs, and lived in exile in Spain, France and England. His sermons and writings presented revisionist theological and historical opinions that supported republicanism. Mier worked with Francisco Javier Mina during the Mexican War of Independence and, as a deputy in independent Mexico's constituent Congress, opposed Agustín de Iturbide's claim to imperial rule. He is honored for his role in Mexican independence.\n\nMier was born in Monterrey, Nuevo León, in the colony of New Spain (in modern-day Mexico). He was a descendant of the Dukes of Granada and conquistadors of Nuevo León. At the age of 16, he entered the Dominican Order in Mexico City. He studied philosophy and theology in the College of Porta Coeli, and was ordained a priest. By the age of 27, he had earned his doctorate and was a noted preacher.\n\nOn December 12, 1794, during the commemorations of the Virgin of Guadalupe apparition, in the presence of Viceroy Miguel de la Grúa Talamanca y Branciforte, marqués de Branciforte, Archbishop Manuel Omaña y Sotomayor and the members of the Audiencia of New Spain, Mier preached a sermon affirming that the apparitions of the Virgin of Guadalupe had happened 1750 years before, and not in 1531. He argued that the original painting of Our Lady of Guadalupe was on the cloak of Saint Thomas the Apostle, who had preached in the Americas long before Spanish conquest, and this had been re-discovered by Juan Diego. This sermon, with its bold revision of Mexican history and identity, was seen as a provocation. Our Lady of Guadalupe represented an intense and highly localized religious sensibility that Creole leaders, such as Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, would later use in their opposition to Spanish rule as a symbol of Mexico.\n\nThe sermon initially drew no attention but one week later, Archbishop Nuñez de Haro condemned condemned Mier to 10 years' exile in the convent of Las Caldas del Besaya in Cantabria, Spain; a perpetual ban from teaching, preaching, or hearing confessions; and the loss of his doctoral degree.\n\nIn 1796, he was granted permission to present his case to the Council of the Indies. However, on his return from the Council, he took the wrong road and was arrested again. This time, he was confined to the Franciscan convent in Burgos. In 1801, he escaped and took refuge in Bayonne, France. From Bayonne, he passed to Bordeaux and later to Paris. There he was interpreter for the rich Peruvian José Sarea, Count of Gijón.\n\nTogether with Simón Rodríguez, Simón Bolívar's former teacher, he opened an academy in Paris to teach Spanish and to translate the \"Atala\" of François-René de Chateaubriand. (The \"Atala\" was set in Louisiana, with an Indian heroine.) Mier also wrote a dissertation against Constantin-François de Chasseboeuf, comte de Volney.\n\nIn Paris, he came to know Chateaubriand; Lucas Alamán, then traveling as a student but later an important conservative politician in Mexico; Baron Alexander von Humboldt; and the Duke of Montmorency. In 1802, he left the Dominican Order and became a secular priest in Rome.\n\nWhen he returned to Madrid, he was again apprehended, this time for a satire he had written supporting Mexican independence. He was sent to the reformatory in Seville, from which he escaped in 1804. However, he was again arrested and returned to prison, where he spent three years. Then the Pope named him his domestic prelate, because he had converted two rabbis to Catholicism.\n\nIn the war between France and Spain, he returned to Spain as military chaplain of the Volunteers of Valencia. He was present at many battles. In Belchite, he was taken prisoner by the French, but he was able to escape again (for the fifth time). He presented himself to General Blake, who recommended him to the Junta of Seville for his services. The Regency in Cádiz granted him an annual pension of 3,000 pesos.\n\nHe moved to London, where he collaborated with José María Blanco on , a newspaper that supported the independence movements in Latin America.\n\nIn London, he met the Spanish revolutionary Francisco Javier Mina. Mina convinced him to join an expedition to New Spain to fight for its independence. They sailed for the United States on May 15, 1816, arriving in Norfolk, Virginia. Mier became friends with New Granadan exile Manuel Torres while Torres and other Spanish American agents helped organize Mina's expedition. The expedition left for New Spain in September, with disastrous results. With the capture of the insurgents' fort at Soto la Marina on June 13, 1817, Mier was taken prisoner again, this time by the royalists. He was sent to the castle of San Carlos de Perote, thence to the dungeons of the Inquisition, and finally, in 1820, to Havana—where he escaped for a sixth time.\n\nAfter this escape Mier returned to the United States again in June 1821, where lived in Manuel Torres' home in Philadelphia for three months along with Vicente Rocafuerte. Torres was now acting as the Colombian representative in the U.S. Though opposites in demeanor, Mier and Torres shared a fanatical anti-monarchism and had a close friendship.\n\nThrough Torres, Mier contacted Colombian secretary of foreign relations Pedro José Gual to encourage him to send a diplomat to Mexico to counter the monarchist movement there, which he did the next year. Mier published several works while in Philadelphia, including a new edition of \"A Brief Account of the Destruction of the Indies\" and the anti-monarchical tract . Historian Charles Bowman suggested one pamphlet bearing Mier's name, , was uncharacteristically moderate for Mier—and was actually Torres' work. \n\nThe priest involved himself in a controversy surrounding St. Mary's Church, to which he was connected through Torres and merchant Richard W. Meade, another acquaintance. Mier defended the parish's excommunicated priest William Hogan, who had offended Bishop Henry Conwell. The trustees of St. Mary's defied the bishop by keeping Hogan as their priest. For Mier this was a matter of control over what the American form of the Church should be, and he became central to the debate. In a dialog of pamphlets \"Servandus Mier\" made vigorous assertions and was vigorously condemned; in one response he wrote, \"It is true that I was a prisoner of the inquisition ... but I would think citizens in the United States and every civilized country would consider this honourable.\" He left the U.S. with a Colombian passport issued by Torres.\n\nIn February 1822, he returned to Mexico, at Veracruz, but was again taken prisoner and held at the castle of San Juan de Ulúa, still in control of the Spanish. The first Mexican constituent congress was able to secure his release; he became a deputy for Nuevo León.\n\nHe opposed the Mexican Empire under Agustín de Iturbide, and was arrested again. He was imprisoned in the convent of Santo Domingo, but on January 1, 1823, he escaped again, for the seventh and last time.\n\nHe was elected a deputy to the second constituent congress. On December 13, 1823, he delivered his famous speech (loosely translated, \"Prophetic Discourse\"). In this speech he argued for a centralized republic or in the event of a federal system being adopted, for its being in moderation. He was among the signers of the Act Constituting the Federation and of the Federal Constitution of the United States of Mexico. Mexico's first president, Guadalupe Victoria, invited him to live in the palace.\n\nIn 1797, he wrote a letter where he confirms that the original date of the apparition of the Virgen de Guadalupe was celebrated by the \"Mexica\" natives on September 8 (of the Julian calendar), and by the Spanish on December 12.\n\nNearing death, he invited his friends to a party to bid him farewell on November 16, 1827. He gave a speech justifying his life and opinions, and died on December 3, 1827. He was interred with great honor in the church of Santo Domingo in Mexico City. In 1861, his body was exhumed, together with 12 others. All the bodies were mummified.\n\nThe mummies were exhibited under the claim they were victims of the Inquisition. Some of the mummies, including Mier's, were sold to an Italian who accepted the claim. His mummy was later shown in Brussels, but what became of his remains after that is unknown.\n\nMier's name is inscribed in letters of gold on the Wall of Honor of the Legislative Palace of San Lázaro, the building that today houses the Chamber of Deputies in Mexico City.\n\nMier published many speeches, sermons and letters on religion and politics, including the following:\n\n\n"}

Geoffrey W. Bromiley calls the image \"especially appropriate to a rocky land like Palestine\". In the Hebrew Bible, the term for \"stumbling block\" is Biblical Hebrew (). In the Septuagint, is translated into Koine Greek (), a word which occurs only in Hellenistic literature, in the sense \"snare for an enemy; cause of moral stumbling\". In the Septuagint a stumbling block means anything that leads to sin.\n\nThe New Testament usages of , such as , resemble Septuagint usage. It appears 15 times in the New Testament in 12 unique verses according to Strong's Concordance. These passages are: , , (3 times), , , , , , , , , , and .\n\nThe noun has a derived verb, (formed with the suffix as English \"scandalize\"), meaning literally \"to trip somebody up\" or, idiomatically, \"to cause someone to sin.\" This verb appears 29 times in 27 New Testament verses.\n\nApart from \"skandalon\" the idiom of \"stumbling block\" has a second synonym in the Greek term \"proskomma\" \"stumbling.\" Both words are used together in 1 Peter 2:8; this is a \"stone of stumbling\" ( λίθος προσκόμματος) and a \"rock of offense\" ( πέτρα σκανδάλου). The antonymous adjective (ἀπρόσκοπος), \"without causing anyone to stumble,\" also occurs three times in the New Testament.\n\nThe Leviticus warning is developed in rabbinical Judaism as \"lifnei iver\" \"before the blind.\"\n\n\"Scandal\" is discussed by Thomas Aquinas in the \"Summa Theologica\". In the 1992 \"Catechism of the Catholic Church\", it is discussed under the fifth commandment (Thou shalt not kill) section \"Respect for the Dignity of Persons\".\n\n\"Active scandal\" is performed by a person; \"passive scandal\" is the reaction of a person to active scandal (\"scandal given\" or in Latin ), or to acts which, because of the viewer's ignorance, weakness, or malice, are regarded as scandalous (\"scandal received\" or in Latin ). \n\nIn order to qualify as scandalous, the behavior must, in itself, be evil or give the appearance of evil. To do a good act or an indifferent act, even knowing that it will inspire others to sin — as when a student studies diligently to do well, knowing it will cause envy — is not scandalous. Again, to ask someone to commit perjury is scandalous, but for a judge to require witnesses to give an oath even when he knows the witness is likely to commit perjury is not scandalous. It does not require that the other person actually commit sin; to be scandalous, it suffices that the act is of a nature to lead someone to sin. Scandal is performed with the intention of inducing someone to sin. Urging someone to commit a sin is therefore active scandal. In the case where the person urging the sin is aware of its nature and the person he is urging is ignorant, the sins committed are the fault of the person who urged them. Scandal is also performed when someone performs an evil act, or an act that appears to be evil, knowing that it will lead others into sin. (In case of an apparently evil act, a sufficient reason for the act despite the faults it will cause negates the scandal.) Scandal may also be incurred when an innocent act may be an occasion of sin to the weak, but such acts should not be foregone if the goods at stake are of importance.\n\nThe term \"stumbling block\" is common in Protestant writings. An early use was Martin Luther's consideration that the common belief that the Mass was a sacrifice was a \"stumbling block.\"\n\nThe Greek word was borrowed from Greek to Latin to French, and finally to English as \"scandal\". The modern English meaning of \"scandal\" is a development from the religious meaning, via the intermediate sense of \"damage to reputation\". \n\n"}

Since his family was so poor, he had to begin working as a laborer in the fields at the age of 12. It was at that time in his life that he was presented with a book of mantras for Lord Ganesha, given to him by a great Mahatma. Murugesu started to chant regularly.\n\nGayathri Siddhar Swami Murugesu is the founder of Sri Lankatheeswarar temple in 1974 with his sole efforts, and had counted thousands of devotees all over the world and hundreds of admirers including leading figures within the country and abroad, among whom were Prime Ministers and others, visiting this temple and getting his blessings, who had tirelessly worked for peace and amity all over the world. The Sri Lankatheeswarar temple is the first and the foremost temple built for Gayathri Amman in Sri Lanka, and the Shiva Lingham installed in this temple was brought from the holy river Narmada by Sri Sivabalayogi Maharaj.\nThis temple has showered with endless blessings of Siddhars especially Gayathri Siddhar Swami Murugesu. Swami MurugesuHe had an ashram next to the temple and lived next to the ashram. There was also a block of sandy steps leading up to a big hall, where Murugesu conducted yagnas and did rituals for Poya day. In the temple there was a big Shivalingam, that would have an abishekam every month. There is a black statue of Goddess Gayathri is there opposite to the temple.\n\nMurugesu went to India and admitted to Sri Kannaiya Yogis Ashram and became his disciple. There he researched in to Gayatri Mantra and written many books based on his researches. Hence he is also known as Gayathri Siddha by his disciples.\n\nMany flocked to the ashram and became Murugesu's disciples. One of them was Swami Shankarananda Maharajji who runs the Gayathri Peedam in South Africa, which was consecrated personally by Swami Murugesu in 1998. Another disciple is Swami Radhakrishnan who runs a Meditation centre in Germany and the Gayathri Meditation is held there.\n\nSwami Murugesu decided to enter into mahasamadhi to release his soul from the perishable body and attained \"Jeevan Mukthi\" on 24 September 2007 in India and his samadhi was laid in the Gayathri Mandir of the Sri Lankatheeswarar temple.

It is one of the five \"Bindu Upanishads\", all attached to the Atharvaveda, and one of twenty Yoga Upanishads in the four Vedas.\n\nThe text is notable for its focus on meditation, calling dedication to bookish learning as rubbish, emphasizing practice instead, and presenting the Vedanta doctrine from Yoga perspective.\n\nThe Tejobindu is listed at number 37 in the serial order of the Muktika enumerated by Rama to Hanuman in the modern era anthology of 108 Upanishads.\n\n\"Tejobindu\", states Paul Deussen, means \"the point representing the power of Brahman\", wherein the point is the \"Anusvara\" in Om.\n\nThe Tejobindu Upanishad is sometimes spelled as \"Tejabindu Upanishad\" (Sanskrit: तेजबिन्दु), such as in the Poona manuscript versions.\n\nMircea Eliade suggests that Tejobindu Upanishad was possibly composed in the same period as the didactic parts of the Mahabharata, the chief Sannyasa Upanishads and along with other early Yoga Upanishads: Brahmabindu (probably composed about the same time as Maitri Upanishad), Ksurika, Amritabindu, Brahmavidya, Nadabindu, Yogashikha, Dhyanabindu and Yogatattva. Eliade's suggestion places these in the final centuries of BCE or early centuries of the CE. All these, adds Eliade, were likely composed earlier than the ten or eleven later Yoga Upanishads such as the Yoga-kundalini, Varaha and Pashupatabrahma Upanishads. \n\nGavin Flood dates the Tejobindu text, along with other Yoga Upanishads, to be probably from the 100 BCE to 300 CE period.\n\nThis Upanishad is among those which have been differently attached to two Vedas, depending on the region where the manuscript was found. Deussen states, it and all Bindu Upanishads are attached to the Atharvaveda, while Ayyangar states it is attached to the Krishna Yajurveda.\n\nColebrooke's version of 52 Upanishads, popular in north India, lists this Upanishad's text at number 21 along with the other four Bindu Upanishads with similar theme. The Narayana anthology also includes this Upanishad at number 21 in \"Bibliothica Indica\". In the collection of Upanishads under the title \"Oupanekhat\", put together by Sultan Mohammed Dara Shikhoh in 1656, consisting of a Persian translation of 50 Upanishads and who prefaced it as the best book on religion, the Tejobindu is listed at number 27 and is named \"Tidj bandeh.\"\n\nThis text is part of the five \"Bindu Upanishads\" collection, the longest among the five, the other four being the \"Nadabindu Upanishad\", the \"Brahmabindu Upanishad\", the \"Amritabindu Upanishad\" and the \"Dhyanabindu Upanishad\", all forming part of the Atharvaveda. All five of Bindu Upanishads emphasize the practice of Yoga and Dhyana (meditation) with Om, to apprehend Atman (soul, self).\n\nLike almost all other Yoga Upanishads, the text is composed in poetic verse form.\n\nThe text exists in multiple versions. The manuscript translated by Deussen is short. It has fourteen verses, describing how difficult meditation is in its first two verses, the requirements for a successful meditative practice in next two, the need for the universal constant Brahman as the radiant focal point of meditation and the nature of Brahman in verses 5 to 11, then closes the text by describing the Yogi who has achieved the state of \"liberation, freedom\" (moksha) while being alive.\n\nThe manuscript translated by TRS Ayyangar of Adyar Library is long, and has six chapters with a cumulative total of 465 verses. The first chapter contains 51 verses, the second has 43 verses, the third with 74 verses, the fourth contains 81 verses, fifth has 105, and the last sixth chapter has 111 verses. Two chapters, in the longer version, are structured as a discourse, with chapters 2 to 4 between Kumara and his father Shiva, and the last two chapters between Nidagha and Ribhu. Deussen states that the shorter form may be a trimmed, \"enormously corrupt text transmission\".\n\nThe text opens by asserting that \"Dhyana\" (meditation) is difficult, and increasingly so as one proceeds from gross, then fine, then superfine states. Even the wise and those who are alone, states the text, find meditation difficult to establish, implement and accomplish.\n\nFor success in \"Dhyana\", asserts the text, one must first conquer anger, greed, lust, attachments, expectations, worries about wife and children. Give up sloth and lead a virtuous life. Be temperate in the food you eat, states Tejobindu, abandon your delusions, and crave not. Find a Guru, respect him and strive to learn from him, states the text.\n\nThe Tejobindu Upanishad begins its discussion of Yoga, with a list of fifteen \"Angas\" (limbs), as follows: Yamas (self control), Niyama (right observances), Tyaga (renunciation), Mauna (silence, inner quietness), Desa (right place, seclusion), Kala (right time), Asana (correct posture), Mula-bandha (stopping all connection with the world), Dehasamyama (body equilibrium, no quivering), Drksthiti (mind equilibrium, stable introspection), Pranasamyama (breath equilibrium), Pratyahara (breath exercises), Dharana (concentration), Atma-dhyana (meditation on soul), Samadhi (union of soul with Brahman).\n\nThe Tejobindu briefly defines these fifteen limbs in verses 1.17 to 1.37, without details. The verses 1.38 to 1.51 describe the difficulty in achieving meditation and Samadhi, and ways to overcome these difficulties. One must function in the world and be good at what one does, improve upon it, yet avoid longing, state verses 1.44–1.45. Physical yoga alone does not provide the full results, unless introspection and right knowledge purifies the mind, state verses 1.48–1.49 of the longer manuscript. One must abandon anger, selfish bonds to things and people, likes and dislikes to achieve Samadhi, states verse 3 of the shorter version of the manuscript.\n\nChapter 2 is a discourse from Shiva to his son Kumara on \"Individual One Essence\". This is Atman (soul, self), states Shiva, it is all existence, the entire world, all knowledge, all space, all time, all Vedas, all introspection, all perceptors, all bodies, all minds, all learning, all that is little, all that is big, and it is Brahman. \"Individual One Essence\" is identical to but called by many names such as Hari and Rudra, and it is without origin, it is gross, subtle and vast in form. \"Individual One Essence\" is thou, a mystery, that which is permanent, and that which is the knower. It is the father, it is the mother, it is the sutra, it is the \"Vira\", what is within, what is without, the nectar, the home, the sun, the crop field, the tranquility, the patience, the good quality, the Om, the radiance, the true wealth, the Atman.\n\nShiva describes the nature of consciousness in verses 2.24–2.41, and asserts the Vedanta doctrine, \"Atman is identical with Brahman\" in the final verses of chapter 2.\n\nThe \"Tejabindu Upanishad\", states Madhavananda, conceives the Supreme \"Atman\" dwelling in the heart of man, as the most subtle centre of effulgence, revealed to yogis by super-sensuous meditation. This Atman and its identity with Brahman, the nature of Tat Tvam Asi, is the subject of text's chapter 3, one to be meditated upon, and realised in essence, for the absolute freedom of the soul.\n\nThe text attributes Shiva explaining the non-dual (Advaita) nature of Atman and Brahman. The verses describe the Atman to be bliss, peace, contentment, consciousness, emotions, delight, satisfaction, absolute, imperishable, bright, \"Nirguna\" (without attributes or qualities), without beginning, without end, and repeatedly states \"I am Atman\", \"I am Brahman\" and the \"Indivisible One Essence\". The Upanishad also states that the ultimate reality (Brahman) is also Vishnu, same as consciousness. This discussion in Tejobindu Upanishad, a Yoga Upanishad, is same as in the major Vedanta Upanishads.\n\nIn the shorter manuscript version, translates Eknath Easwaran, \"the Brahman gives himself through his infinite grace\" to ones who abandon life's duality.\n\nThe chapter 4 of the Upanishad, in a discourse from Shiva to his son Kumara, describes Jivanmukta as follows (abridged):\n\nThe text asserts that a Jivanmukta has Self-knowledge, knows his Atman is pure Hamsa (migrant swan), he is firmly planted in his soul, in the kingdom of his soul, peaceful, comfortable, kind, happy, living by his own accord. He is \"the Lord of his own Atman\", state verses 4.31–4.32 of the text.\n\nThe Tejobindu Upanishad, in verses 4.33–4.79 describes \"Videhamukta\", and the difference between Videha mukti and Jivanmukti.\n\nA Videhamukta, states the text, is one who is beyond the witness (4th). \n"}
{"id": "2604124", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2604124", "title": "Transcendent theosophy", "text": "Transcendent theosophy\n\nTranscendent theosophy or al-hikmat al-muta’li (حكمت متعالي), the doctrine and philosophy developed by Persian philosopher Mulla Sadra, is one of two main disciplines of Islamic philosophy that is currently live and active.\n\nThe expression al-hikmat al-muta’liyah comprises two terms al-hikmat (meaning literally, \"wisdom\"; and technically, \"philosophy\", and by contextual extension \"theosophy\") and muta’liyah (meaning \"exalted\" or \"Transcendent\"). This school of Mulla Sadra in Islamic philosophy is usually called al-hikmat al-muta’liyah. It is a most appropriate name for his school, not only for historical reasons, but also because the doctrines of Mulla Sadra are both hikmah or theosophy in its original sense and an intellectual vision of the transcendent which leads to the Transcendent Itself. So Mulla Sadra’s school is transcendent for both historical and metaphysical reasons.\n\nWhen Mulla Sadra talked about hikmah or theosophy in his words, he usually meant the transcendent philosophy. He gave many definitions to the term hikmah, the most famous one is: hikmah is a vehicle through which “man becomes an intelligible world resembling the objective world and similar to the order of universal existence”.\n\nMulla Sadra's philosophy and ontology is considered to be just as important to Islamic philosophy as Martin Heidegger's philosophy later was to Western philosophy in the 20th century. Mulla Sadra bought \"a new philosophical insight in dealing with the nature of reality\" and created \"a major transition from essentialism to existentialism\" in Islamic philosophy.\n\nA concept that lies at the heart of Mulla Sadra's philosophy is the idea of \"existence precedes essence\", a key foundational concept of existentialism which was not popularized in the West until Jean-Paul Sartre in the 20th century. This was also the opposite of the idea of \"essence precedes existence\" previously supported by Avicenna and his school of Avicennism as well as Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi and his school of Illuminationism. Sayyid Jalal Ashtiyani later summarizes Mulla Sadra's concept as follows:\n\nFor Mulla Sadra, \"existence precedes the essence and is thus principle since something has to exist first and then have an essence.\" This is primarily the argument that lies at the heart of Mulla Sadra's philosophy. Mulla Sadra substituted a metaphysics of existence for the traditional metaphysics of essences, and giving priority Ab initio to existence over quiddity.\n\nMulla Sadra effected a revolution in the metaphysics of being by his thesis that there are no immutable essences, but that each essence is determined and variable according to the degree of intensity of its act of existence.\n\nIn his view reality is existence, in a variety of ways, and these different ways look to us like essences. What first affects us are things that exist and we form ideas of essences afterward, so existence precedes essence. This position referred to as primacy of existence ().\n\nMulla Sadra's existentialism is therefore fundamentally different from Western, i.e. existentialism of Jean-Paul Sartre. Sartre said that human beings have no essence before their existence because, there is no Creator, no God. This is the meaning of \"existence precedes essence\" in Sartre's existentialism.\n\nAnother central concept of Mulla Sadra's philosophy is the theory of \"substantial motion\" (\"al-harakat al-jawhariyyah\"), which is \"based on the premise that everything in the order of nature, including celestial spheres, undergoes substantial change and transformation as a result of the self-flow (\"fayd\") and penetration of being (\"sarayan al-wujud\") which gives every concrete individual entity its share of being. In contrast to Aristotle and Ibn Sina who had accepted change only in four categories, i.e., quantity (\"kamm\"), quality (\"kayf\"), position (\"wad’\") and place (\"‘ayn\"), Sadra defines change as an all-pervasive reality running through the entire cosmos including the category of substance (\"jawhar\").\" Heraclitus described a similar concept centuries earlier ( - panta rhei - \"everything is in a state of flux\"), while Gottfried Leibniz described a similar concept a century after Mulla Sadra's work.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "13530776", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13530776", "title": "Trương Định", "text": "Trương Định\n\nTrương Định (1820 – August 19, 1864), sometimes known as Trương Công Định, was a mandarin in the Nguyễn dynasty of Vietnam under Emperor Tự Đức. He is best known for leading a guerrilla army in southern Vietnam against the French invasion in defiance of the emperor. He refused to recognise the 1862 Treaty of Saigon that ceded Vietnamese territory to France.\n\nThe son of a military mandarin from central Vietnam, Định moved south when his father was posted to Gia Định as the provincial commander. Định grew up to lead a military colony, overseeing the settlement and economic development of his constituency. He gained a reputation for being an able leader and land developer who cared for his people. When France began its invasion of southern Vietnam in 1859, Định organised local militia to reinforce the imperial army. As the regular army units suffered defeats on the battlefield, its remnants joined Định's partisans, and by 1861, he had around 6,000 men under his command. Định built his own resistance base and organised guerrilla attacks against the French. His success led Tự Đức to grant Định command of the southern partisans and to order the regular commanders to coordinate their plans with him. Định's forces quickly gained the respect of the French. They focused on disrupting the French bureaucracy and military posts in addition to the transportation of rice. Their most notable attack was the sinking of \"L'Espérance\" in December 1861.\n\nAmid growing military setbacks, Vietnam signed the Treaty of Saigon in June 1862, losing three southern provinces which became the French colony of Cochinchina. Tự Đức hoped that by abiding by the treaty, Vietnam could eventually negotiate the future return of the territory. He ordered the partisans to disband, but Định refused to recognise the treaty and disobeyed the monarch, fighting on in defense of his homeland. With the loss of imperial support, Định's forces began to struggle against the superior resources of the French. His men were gradually worn down and, following an ambush, Định committed suicide to avoid being captured.\n\nVietnamese and French historians have fiercely debated Định's choice to disregard the treaty. The effectiveness of Định's insurgency led French officials to claim that Tự Đức was secretly assisting him, thereby violating the treaty, a pretext the French used to seize three more provinces in 1867. Vietnamese records dispute this, contending that Tự Đức attempted to ensure Định's compliance with the treaty. Định's defiance of the emperor has led historians to debate whether his actions were motivated by a rejection of the monarch's authority or whether he disobeyed in an attempt to help Tự Đức. Định remains widely respected among Vietnamese of all political persuasions. During the Vietnam War, communist historians sought to portray the Việt Cộng as Định's modern successor.\n\nĐịnh was born in the Bình Sơn District in the Quảng Ngãi prefecture in Quảng Nam Province in central Vietnam. The son of a military mandarin named Trương Cầm, Định went south in the 1830s when his father was posted to Gia Định as the provincial commander. Định enjoyed a reputation among the locals for his martial skills and knowledge of the military classics. He married the daughter of a wealthy resident of Tân An in nearby Dinh Tuong Province, having moved there after his father's unexpected death. It was likely that he would have returned to central Vietnam if he had not married.\n\nĐịnh took advantage of his improved socio-economic status to recruit a group of impoverished people, whom he organised for clearing land and founding a \"đồn điền\" (\"military colony\") in Gò Công. This occurred after Emperor Tự Đức's 1854 order, which granted General Nguyễn Tri Phương permission to organise southern levies in this manner. In recognition of his achievements, the mandarin authorities gave Định the rank of deputy regimental commander. His success in developing \"đồn điền\" was attributed to his organisational ability as well as a genuine concern for the welfare of those under his protection, ensuring that they had enough to eat and something to wear. He was regarded as energetic, brave and compassionate. In gratitude for Định's land development skills, the peasants gave him the middle name Công, which means \"great public service\".\n\nThe process of Vietnam's colonisation began in September 1858 when a Franco-Spanish force landed at Da Nang in central Vietnam and attempted to proceed to the capital, Huế. After becoming tied down, they sailed to the less-defended south. The French and Spanish quickly captured the imperial Citadel of Saigon in February 1859—the fortress's commander committed suicide. The citadel was razed and the substantial supplies were confiscated. The leaderless and defeated imperial troops fled in disarray. The attacks were ordered by French Emperor Napoleon III. French diplomats, naval officers, merchants and missionaries had long advocated the expedition. The missionaries wanted the French administration to facilitate their work converting the Vietnamese to Roman Catholicism, while military and business figures saw commercial opportunities in Vietnam. Napoleon's motivations were primarily imperial, strategic and commercial, but he found it convenient to cite \"freedom of religion\" as his justification for taking action. The Nguyễn Dynasty was Confucianist and had restricted the activity of missionaries. The belief system of Christianity was incompatible with the Confucian belief that the monarch was the \"son of heaven\".\n\nIn response to the razing of the Citadel of Saigon, Định organised his local levies into a \"guerrilla\" force that initially numbered between 500 and 1000 men, operating out of Thuan Kieu. They were armed with bladed spears, fire lances, knives, sabres, bamboo sticks and swords, trained and on call as necessary. As a local notable who was respected for his leadership and military ability, Định naturally assumed a lead role in the partisan movement that responded to Tự Đức's appeals for popular resistance against European aggression. In the initial phase of the conflict, the local militias concentrated on evacuating the populace from areas that had been taken over by the French, while urging those who chose to stay to not cooperate with the Europeans. Snipers were deployed into French areas to assassinate isolated soldiers.\n\nIn 1861, Định moved his men to Tân Hòa sub-prefecture in the Gò Công area. Tan Hoa was an ideal location for a resistance base. It was close to newly formed resistance groups led by Nguyễn Trung Trực, Tran Xuan Hoa and others in the Gò Công and Mỹ Tho area, yet was also close to Saigon. In February, the French attacked the citadel of Ky Hoa, seizing the fort after two days, along with a large quantity of weapons, artillery and food supplies. Having fought at Ky Hoa, Định incorporated soldiers from the defeated imperial army into his ranks, because its commander Vo Duy Ninh had committed suicide. In May 1861, Admiral Léonard Charner ordered the dissolution of the \"đồn điền\" of Gò Công. He went about confiscating the land of those Vietnamese who remained loyal to the monarchy, giving it to his collaborators. French impositions against the trade of rice via nearby waterways caused a further backlash from the locals of Gò Công. In 1861, the resistance leaders in the Gò Công area delegated Định to travel to Biên Hòa to seek permission from Imperial Military Commissioner Nguyen Ba Nghi to \"turn around the situation\".\n\nAppointed to the rank of lieutenant colonel, Định began to stockpile foodstuffs, manufacture weapons, and recruit forces from the populace with the help of officers from the imperial army. His forces grew to around 6,000 men by June 1861. The French began to report that junks from Singapore and Hong Kong had arrived in Gò Công with shipments of European-made weapons. Định's forces began inflicting substantial damage on the European troops, largely because of their intimate knowledge of the terrain, skill in hit-and-run guerrilla tactics, and support from the local villagers. Định's men focused on chasing French soldiers around the countryside and attacking military installations that were left undefended as a consequence of their guerrilla pursuit. Learning of Định's role in support of the Nguyễn dynasty's call for popular resistance, Tự Đức promoted him to the rank of lieutenant colonel for the Gia Định region. Later in 1861, the imperial regulars were defeated at Biên Hòa, and the commanding Vietnamese officers were ordered by the royal authorities to meet Định at Tan Hoa to develop a plan for retaking Biên Hòa. As a result, the number of troops under Định's direct authority grew. Early in 1862, the Nguyễn court granted Định command of all the southern \"nghĩa quân\" (\"righteous soldiers\"), the term that Huế used for the partisans. Định continued to lead raids on enemy forces from his base in Gò Công. Friction developed between the regular army and Định's partisans as to whether to stage aggressive sorties from Tan Hoa, as was Định's strategy, or to bide their time and engage in military buildup.\n\nĐịnh's \"nghĩa quân\" quickly earned the respect of the opposing French naval officers. Léopold Pallu de la Barrière, who defended the posts at Gò Công from Định's attacks, was surprised by their ferocity. Unaware of their nationalist feelings, de la Barrière had expected the Vietnamese to live submissively under any ruler that would allow them to sow their crops. He wrote:\nHe went on to recognise the popular nature of the partisans' efforts, stating that the \"centre of resistance was everywhere, infinitely subdivided\"; he regarded every peasant as a centre of resistance.\n\nFrom the middle of 1861, Định's Gò Công guerrillas focused on three objectives: to disrupt the newly created French bureaucracy, to disrupt their military outposts and to disrupt the transport of rice to Cholon, the main commercial hub of southern Vietnam. The first major attack against the French administration in the area targeted the Gò Công district office on June 22, 1861. At 05:00, 600 rebels under the command of Do Dinh Thoai stormed the military post in the town, engaging the French troops in hand-to-hand combat with lances, bayonets, knives and bamboo sticks. The French were surprised by the attack, losing one soldier and having 100 wounded. By the time reinforcements and naval cover had arrived from Mỹ Tho, Định's men had fled. Thoai—who had been the district chief until the French invasion—was among the 14 killed.\n\nOn September 27, the guerrillas assassinated the French-installed chief of Gò Công, displaying his severed head in the town market. The chief's servant, who was an informant for Định, aided this operation. The killing had the effect of intimidating the chief's designated successor into submitting to the rebels and ceasing his service for the French. In November 1861, Định's men went into the town of Mỹ Tho to recruit militants and collect food supplies. During this time, they attacked and burned pro-French villages and their leaders.\n\nĐịnh's Gò Công insurgents attempted to stop rice from being shipped to Cholon by attacking the French lorchas and apprehending the trading vessels on the local waterways. A French report in November 1861 noted that shipping had been severely disrupted and restricted, despite high levels of French naval protection. The most notable of the seaborne attacks was the burning of the lorcha \"L'Espérance\" on Nhat Tao Canal on December 10, 1861. Around 150 guerrillas commanded by Trực ambushed the vessel, killing some of the crew before burning and sinking the boat. The attack buoyed Vietnamese morale and instilled the belief that they could fight against French naval forces. The sinking earned the specific praise of Emperor Tự Đức, who described the incident as \"most outstanding\".\n\nHowever, the overall Vietnamese military performance was not as successful as Định's guerrilla activities. On June 5, 1862, Định broke with the Nguyễn army after the court's plenipotentiary Phan Thanh Giản and another official, Lam Duy Hiep, signed the Treaty of Saigon. This agreement ceded the three southern provinces of Gia Định, Định Tường and Biên Hòa to France; they became the colony of Cochinchina. The treaty was accompanied by financial payments to France, religious concessions to missionaries and commercial opportunities for European merchants. Militarily, the withdrawal of the Nguyễn army deprived the resistance of the logistical support that could be provided by a regular force. It also permitted the French to concentrate their efforts against a single antagonist. Politically, the treaty provided, for those Vietnamese who needed one, a legal basis to collaborate with the French on Cochinchinese soil. As a result, the colonial forces found it easier to recruit militia and administrative personnel among Vietnamese who had been too afraid or too embarrassed to serve the French openly before the 1862 treaty. Định then allied himself with Võ Duy Dương to form the Movement of Popular Self Defense (\"Phong Trao Nhan Dan Tu Ve\"), creating an operations base in Đồng Tháp.\n\nThe Huế court ordered Định to disband his forces and to accept a high position in An Giang Province. Fearing that they faced extermination at the hands of the French, Định's followers and lieutenants pressed him to remain. Claiming that his followers would not allow him to leave, Định refused his appointment to An Giang, instead adopting the title of \"Bình Tây Sát Tà Đại Tướng\" (\"Western Pacifying Antiheresy General\"). He continued his guerrilla attacks against French patrols and their Vietnamese collaborators. The slogan \"Phan-Lâm mái quốc; Triều đình khi dân\" (\"Phan [Thanh Gian] and Lam [Duy Hiep] sell out the country; the court doesn’t care for the people\") was circulated through the region. From his stronghold at Gò Công, Định exhorted all southern Vietnamese to rise against the occupying regime, an appeal that was well received. In the words of French naval artillery officer Henri de Poyen, by December 1862, \"the insurrection had broken out and was rapidly spreading throughout the colony\". French commanders were convinced that Định remained in secret contact with Huế and was privately supported by Tự Đức against the terms of the treaty. The French charged that Định possessed a seal of office from Huế. However, there were reports that Tự Đức had twice ordered the arrest of Định and Dương to ensure their compliance with the treaty.\n\nIn contrast with many of his scholar-gentry colleagues who lacked a military training, Định was regarded as having a good understanding of the capabilities and limitations of his armed resistance. Định hoped to wear down the French over an extended period by exploiting the constant outbreak of malaria among the Europeans. During the initial phase of the invasion in 1858, the French had suffered heavily from tropical disease. Định calculated that such illnesses would partly compensate for the inferior weaponry of his forces. He attempted to maintain an administration parallel to the one imposed on the districts by the French admirals. These objectives required a high degree of regional coordination, something that was impossible without the support of the imperial bureaucracy. Định's appeal among the peasantry was attributed to their gratitude for his administration of the \"đồn điền\". Under such a system, he was responsible for assisting them in matters such as clearing land, educating the community, providing health care and mediating disputes. Joining the resistance army was seen as a means of showing trust and gratitude. \"Hịch Trương Định\" (\"The proclamation of Trương Định\"), which was believed to have been written in 1862 or 1863, emphasised such themes. It read:\n\nBy February 1864, Admiral Bonard had accumulated sufficient reinforcements to attack and seize Định's main strongholds in the Tan Hoa and Gò Công areas. He inflicted heavy casualties on the partisans and forced them to retreat in disarray. Định reorganised his troops and procured more firearms from the local Chinese in order to resume his guerrilla campaign. He attempted to widen his support base by distributing leaflets as far as the regional centres of Saigon and Mỹ Tho, calling on \"nghĩa quân\" from other provinces to join the common struggle. By this time, the French were able to keep Định and the other resistance leaders constantly on the move, aided by a growing network of local informants. In 1863, a famine had broken out, and resistance forces were increasingly unable to find food. With the court providing no practical support, the French gradually wore down the partisans. Định retreated into the marshes of Bien Hoa, where he attempted to reorganise his forces.\n\nOn August 19, 1864, with his remaining guerrillas facing serious supply problems and suffering from hunger, Định was betrayed by a former follower and ambushed by French forces. Wounded and facing imminent capture, Định committed suicide. His 20-year-old son Truong Quyen (1840–1870), attempted with modest success to carry on his father's struggle. A new base was set up in Tây Ninh. It allowed more room for tactical manoeuvring but still depended on supplies being carried north from Tan Hoa. Quyen was eventually killed and in 1874, long after the southern insurgency had been crushed, Tự Đức granted a monthly allowance in grain and cash to Định's widow Le Thi Thuong, who had returned to her native village in Quảng Ngãi, which at the time was still in independent Vietnamese territory. The ration of 20 francs and 60 litres of rice was substantial, because the monthly salary of a ninth-rank mandarin was only 18 francs and 48 litres of rice.\n\nThe actions of Định in the wake of the Treaty of Saigon have long been a subject of conjecture. At the time, the French military accused Huế of surreptitiously supporting Định in contravention of the treaty, while Huế denied this, publicly claiming that Định's actions in resisting the French would be counterproductive in attempting to maintain Vietnamese sovereignty.\n\nAfter the signing of the Treaty of Saigon, the Huế court attempted to regain what it had lost militarily through diplomacy. Vietnamese negotiators sought a reversal of the territorial cession, which they regarded as the most humiliating clause of the treaty. In late 1863, the Vietnamese proposed extensive financial, economic, and political concessions in exchange for the return of the three provinces. Tự Đức sent Gian to France to seek an audience with Napoleon III. There Gian behaved in a helpless manner in an attempt to gain pity from the French monarch. Gian promised that Vietnam would pay large indemnities for the military conflicts, grant further commercial concessions and a protectorate over all six southern provinces. Napoleon initially agreed, but the decision was reversed after lobbying from French officers.\n\nTự Đức continued to hope that Vietnamese compliance with the treaty would convince France to return the three southern provinces. In the words of Gian, Vietnam's full cooperation with the 1862 treaty was necessary to maintain the possibility of a territorial retrocession. The French officers in Saigon, the capital of Cochinchina, frequently accused the Nguyễn court of violating the treaty by quietly supporting continued resistance. In 1867, they took this as a pretext to seize the other three provinces in southern Vietnam: Vĩnh Long, Hà Tiên and An Giang.\n\nThe court records of the Nguyễn dynasty in Huế, the \"Đại Nam thực lục\" (\"Veritable Records of the Great South\") dispute the French claims, revealing that the court attempted to prevent illegal guerrilla activity by the likes of Định. However, in one edict, Định claimed that Tự Đức endorsed his struggle, in an attempt to garner popular support. This fuelled French claims that the guerrillas were periodically traveling between French territory and the adjoining sovereign Nguyễn territory to get supplies from provincial officials.\n\nThe French officers never produced concrete proof of Huế's support for the southern partisans or of the connivance of Vietnamese officials in the sovereign provinces bordering French-occupied territory. Despite this, they seized the rest of southern Vietnam on the basis that Huế was violating the treaty. Vice-Admiral Bonard, governor of French Cochinchina from 1861 until 1863, asserted:\n\nHistorians sympathetic to the colonisation reiterated the officers' assertions about the contacts between Huế and the southern partisans. De Poyen wrote that the southern insurgency \"was ceaselessly excited and supported by emissaries from Huế, who travelled throughout the country\". Milton Osborne, while noting that evidence was circumstantial, asserted that French charges were probably legitimate:\n\nVietnamese documentation challenges the French assertions. The imperial records, written communications between Gian and Định, and the account of the southern insurgency written by a resistance figure named Nguyen Thong support the contention that Định's guerrillas operated independently of Huế and in violation of its orders. The imperial records hold that Tự Đức immediately ordered the insurgents to disband, fearing that their actions were an obstacle to his plan of negotiating the return of the lost territory. The records assert that Tự Đức ordered his officials to prevent the insurgents from returning to independent Vietnamese land and to arrest those who did so. Messengers were sent from Huế into the south with the intention of discouraging the insurgents, rather than fomenting resistance.\n\nIn the specific case of Định, the Vietnamese documents record the failed attempts of Gian to persuade him to lay down his arms and accept an administrative post in An Giang. The records assert that his position as head of the resistance was granted by his followers rather than Huế. Shortly after signing the treaty, the court directed Gian to write to Định, ordering him to respect the agreement and end his resistance. Gian's letter and Định's rebuff show Tự Đức's insistence on abiding by the treaty and the guerrilla chief's staunch refusal to do so. Gian's letter argued that it was illegal and futile to ignore the court's order to cease hostilities. Gian wrote:\n\nIn his reply, Định demonstrated his awareness of the illegality of his insurgency and the southerners' obligation to obey their emperor. Định nevertheless refused to abandon his supporters, vowing to disobey royal orders:\n\nVietnamese records show that when Định disobeyed the court's orders, he was stripped of his position and titles: \"Trương Định has refused to return to the exercise of his office, and he is accordingly removed from that function with loss of honorific titles.\" Nguyen Thong, a former mandarin who fought alongside Định and corresponded with many other guerrilla leaders, agreed with the court records. According to Thong, Định's continued resistance resulted from local initiatives contrary to Huế's explicit instructions. Định's supporters implored him to disobey the edicts of 1862 that directed the partisans to end hostilities: \"Our people forced the Westerners to retreat many times, and now that the court has made peace with them, they will surely kill us... Since the court has settled with them, who will support us? Let us unite to strike back at them, to take for ourselves a piece of land on which we can fight for our lives.\"\n\nAccording to Thong's account, Định agreed with these arguments and began to organise the resources required for his unapproved anti-French movement. Although he was fully aware of his imperial defiance, Định sent an appeal \"to all the righteous men, encouraging them in the name of loyalty to the court to rise and destroy the invaders\". Thong asserted that the imperial edicts used by Định—which were cited by French officers for subsequent aggression—were fake. Định had falsified them to make propaganda in order to rally popular support. According to Mark McLeod, it is unclear whether hawkish mandarins in the imperial court were assisting Định's southern insurgents in contravention of Tự Đức's wishes. Truong Buu Lam opined that \"if some partisans received assistance from the Vietnamese authorities, it was extended to them by local officials who acted independently\".\n\nIn light of Định's disobedience of Tự Đức, his justification for his defiance is discussed against the backdrop of the Confucian expectation for him to defer to the emperor's \"Mandate of Heaven\". As Định left no explicit or definitive statement for his rationale for disobeying Tự Đức, scholars who have recognised or suspected Định's disobedience have been forced to speculate.\n\nLam assumes Định's disobedience and explains it by asserting that the insurgents drew a distinction between the reigning monarch and the monarchy as an idealised institution.\n\nThe historian David Marr agrees, noting that \"the distinction quite rightly pointed out by Professor Truong Buu Lam was in all probability bred of immediate adverse conditions and not the product of a long tradition\". Modern Vietnamese historians of the communist regime go to the extent of asserting that Định's justification for continued resistance was based on an implicit rejection of the monarchy at large. These historians base their hypothesis on the assertion that the Confucian virtue of monarchical loyalty was unconditional and absolute in 19th-century Vietnam. In the words of the editors of the Institute of Historical Study's journal, \"Nghiên cứu lịch sử\" (\"Historical Studies\"), \"Loyalty to the king was the people's duty, and to satisfy the obligation of monarchical loyalty, the court's orders had to be followed\". In the view of Marxist authors, Định resolved the conflict between monarchical loyalty and resisting foreign occupation by discarding the constraints of Confucian ethics. They assert that Định justified his struggle by placing loyalty to Tự Đức below his loyalty to Vietnam and its people. The Institute of Historical Study's Nguyen Cong Binh stated, \"Relying on the people, Trương Định placed the country above the king, thus safeguarding his feelings of loyalty to the country\". These arguments are consistent with Marxist ideology and its criticism of the Nguyễn dynasty as a \"reactionary, feudal regime\". Communist party historiography has long criticised the Nguyễn dynasty and its roots in the Nguyễn lords for the division of the country in the centuries-long struggle with the Trịnh lords of the north and then the subsequent use of French aid of Pigneau de Behaine to unseat the Tây Sơn dynasty. It further accords with Hanoi's ideological line of portraying anti-colonial, anti-French fighters of the 19th century as the spiritual ancestors of the Vietnamese Communist Party.\n\nAccording to historian Mark McLeod, these postulated explanations of Định's behaviour are plausible, given the chaos engulfing Vietnam at the time and the lack of conclusive documentation. However, Định and his supporters asserted their loyalty to the monarch and justified their struggle in his name, both before and after the signing of the treaty. These declarations show no hint of rejecting Tự Đức's authority nor any reference to a worthier, idealised monarch. Conversely, many of these proclamations display an intense feeling of personal loyalty. A placard that French forces found floating downstream near Định's base in Gò Công asserted: \"Gratitude ties us to our king. We will avenge the insults he has received [from the French], or we will die for him.\" One of Định's proclamations to his followers read: \"The Emperor does not recognise us, but it is indeed our duty to carry on our struggle... The Emperor calls us rebels, but in the depth of his heart he cannot help but praise our loyalty. When the day of victory arrives, not only will the Emperor forgive us, he will furthermore grant us all kinds of awards.\"\nSuch writings may be dismissed by skeptics as a political stunt aimed at attracting support for continued resistance by appealing to the widely held Confucian value of monarchical loyalty. This is the explanation suggested by the Marxist authors: \"On the one hand, Trương Định opposed Tự Đức's order to lay down his arms; on the other hand, he exploited Tự Đức's name in order to call upon the people to rise and fight the French\". McLeod argues that the best explanation for Định's continued insurgency was that the Confucian tradition allows for a loyal official to disobey his sovereign without calling the sovereign's authority into question. This is termed a \"tránh thần\", meaning a minister who is willing to dispute his sovereign's orders in order to prevent the ruler from committing a mistake, even if this incurred his ire. The minister who allowed the ruler to err rather than risk upsetting him was regarded as a sycophant, a careerist rather a loyal adviser. The loyal official was thus required in certain circumstances to remonstrate with and even to disobey his sovereign to show his concern for the monarch. Thus, according to McLeod, Định's disobedience did not \"ipso facto\" constitute a rejection of Tự Đức's authority.\n\nĐịnh believed that Tự Đức would eventually realise his error and reward the insurgents. Historians feel that it is likely that Gian and Tự Đức saw Định's continued resistance as a misguided attempt to help the monarchy. In their written confrontation after the signing of the treaty, Gian did not accuse Định of being a rebel, but of excessive devotion to the emperor, which while admirable in principle, was hindering their current strategy. \"Monarchical loyalty is a noble quality\", Gian had told the recalcitrant guerrilla leader, but \"[i]t must have a limit. One cannot exceed this limit and still be faithful and pious. Too much is just as bad as not enough; when a snake begins to have legs, it is no longer a snake...\" Tự Đức also appeared to view Định's continued resistance as a misguided manifestation of loyalty. Although the southern insurgents' disobedience provided the French with a pretext for further aggression, thereby hindering Tự Đức's plans for regaining the lost territory, the emperor never accused them of rebelling against royal authority. Instead, he continued to refer to them as \"righteous recruits\" motivated by \"indignation\" at the actions of the Westerners.\n\nNguyễn Đình Chiểu, the leading poet of the southern struggle, did not portray Định as a rebel opposed to the Huế court. In an elegy to fallen insurgents, Chiểu asserted that the resistance continued its struggle after the treaty was signed \"because their hearts would not heed the Son of Heaven's edict\". Chiểu strongly supported the partisans' continuing efforts in attempting to expel the French from southern Vietnam, a cause he considered righteous. However, his reference to Tự Đức as the \"Son of Heaven\" indicates that the legitimacy of the emperor was not called into question. After Định's death, Chiểu wrote in a poem:\n\nChiểu further hoped that the Vietnamese court would change its position and come to the aid of the insurgents, writing: \"The sigh of the wind and the cry of the crane [announcing the official army's arrival] held you breathless for more than ten months. You were expecting news from the officials as one expects rain in the dry season.\"\n\nThe reputation of Định and his southern rebels persisted long after his death. Phan Bội Châu, the leading Vietnamese revolutionary of the early 20th century, travelled into the south in 1904, seeking to start a new anti-French movement. He specifically attempted to recruit followers among the surviving elderly members of Định's movement. Định was highly regarded as a revolutionary hero by Vietnamese of both communist and anti-communist persuasions. In 1964, an article in the North Vietnamese \"Nghiên cứu lịch sửu\" described Định as \"the hero symbolising the spirit of resistance to the foreign colonialists of the people of Southern Viet-Nam\". The same article extolled Định's physical appearance and his capabilities, stating \"He was handsome in appearance, understood the military manual and was a good shot\". During the Vietnam War era, North Vietnamese historians sought to portray the Viet Cong—which fought against the Army of the Republic of Vietnam and the United States—as Định's modern successor. Định was also highly regarded among anti-communist South Vietnamese scholars. A prominent thoroughfare in the centre of Ho Chi Minh City in southern Vietnam is named after him.\n\nAlthough Định received little attention in French academia, the North Vietnamese heavily relied on French sources for their accounts of the guerrilla leader. In the most detailed French account by Paulin Vial, Định is depicted as a \"criminal\" or \"rebel\". Osborne said that Định's final manifesto before his death showed him \"to have been a man with a high concept of duty, an awareness of his own weakness and with a sense of despair, common to many of his countrymen, at the ambivalence of the Huế court\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "47751868", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47751868", "title": "Vegetarian ecofeminism", "text": "Vegetarian ecofeminism\n\nVegetarian ecofeminism is an activist and academic movement which states that all types of oppression are linked and must be eradicated, with a focus on including the domination of humans over nonhuman animals. Through the feminist concept known as intersectionality, it is recognized that sexism, racism, classism, and other forms of inter human oppression are all connected. Vegetarian ecofeminism aims to include the domination of not only the environment but also of nonhuman animals to the list. Vegetarian ecofeminism is part of the academic and philosophical field of ecofeminism, which states that the ways in which the privileged dominates the oppressed should include the way humans dominate nature. A major theme within ecofeminism is the belief that there is a strong connection between the domination of women and the domination of nature, and that both must be eradicated in order to end oppression.\n\nVegetarian ecofeminism extends beyond ecofeminism because it believes that the way in which humans exploit and kill nonhuman animals should be distinctly recognized, and that the oppression of humans is linked to the oppression of nonhuman animals. The concept of speciesism is central to distinguishing between vegetarian ecofeminism and ecofeminism, and it strongly links the hierarchies created among nonhuman animals to the hierarchies created among humans. Distinguishing between ecofeminism and vegetarian ecofeminism is important because of vegetarian ecofeminism's focus on the oppression of nonhuman animals provides connections between the other linked forms of oppression, but specifically the oppression of women.\n\nSpeciesism is a form of oppression central to the ecofeminist concept, and the belief that speciesism is a valid form of oppression that must be eradicated is at the center of most vegetarian ecofeminist arguments. It is used to support the exploitation and killing of nonhuman animals. Much like any other form of oppression, speciesism is a social construction that benefits the dominant at the expense of the oppressed.\n\nHumanists believe that speciesism is not a \"bad -ism\" like racism or sexism, because while women, people of color, and any other group of oppressed humans are moral humans, nonhuman animals are not and therefore do not deserve the same rights. According to humanism, the domination of humans over animals is justified, and animals are indeed meant for human consumption. Human rights are inherently more important than animal rights because their biological differences from human makes them morally different as well.\n\nVegetarian ecofeminists argue that there is an inherent bond between humans and nonhuman animals, and the human supremacy and degradation of animals that ensues is a social construction meant to undermine the human-animal bond. It is in fact not the characteristic of an abnormal few who care and empathize with nonhuman animals, but the normal state for most humans. This is exemplified by the cross-cultural practice of pet-keeping or the usage of animals in therapy, which demonstrate the strength of the bond between humans and animals. The act of expiation in which humans justify the act of killing nonhuman animals shows that humans are inclined not to harm animals, otherwise there would not need to be any mechanisms created cross-culturally to help deal with the guilt felt in killing animals.\n\nThe hierarchy created among nonhuman animals validates the hierarchies created among humans. Humans identify more closely with nonhuman animals that have human characteristics, and this allows for humans to create a hierarchy that places nonhuman that humans are able to identify more closely with at the top, and those it shares less characteristics with at the bottom. Humans have evolved to sympathize with beings similar to themselves. This allows humans to justify the killing of certain animals over others, because due to the hierarchy humans have created, some animals are of lesser value and therefore have fewer rights. For example, Western cultures kill cows, chickens, and fish for consumption, but find it morally wrong to kill lions, dogs, and dolphins. That is because Western moral values find connections between humans and lions, dogs, and dolphins, but do not find connections between cows, chickens, and fish, and therefore value certain species' lives over others. Which species are valued over others differs depending on culture, country, religion, etc., as can be seen in the fact that it is socially acceptable to eat dogs in many Asian cultures, but is seen as morally corrupt in most Western cultures. The lack of a universal hierarchy for nonhuman animals shows that it is a social construction created to benefit humans.\n\nVegetarian ecofeminism argues that the killing of any animal is part of a larger system of oppression, and that instead of choosing one animal over another, or a human over a nonhuman animal, humans should care about all oppressed subjects and should be invested in ending each subject's oppression, so as to end the oppression of all beings. The creation of hierarchies in nonhuman animals can also rapidly become the creation of hierarchies in humans, and thus one can once again observe how speciesism is linked to racism, classism, sexism, and other forms of oppression.\n\nVegetarian ecofeminism asserts that as long as \"humans are violent toward animals, they often are violent toward one another\" and this \"vicious circle of violence and destruction can end only if and when the human species learns to form harmonious relations – non-hierarchical and non-exploitative – with other animal species and the natural world.\"\n\nVegetarian ecofeminism argues that the oppression of nonhuman animals and the oppression of women are closely linked, so vegetarian ecofeminism argues that eating meat makes one complicit in the exploitation of animals. It also makes one complicit in the violence towards animals and women, for \"meat-eating is a form of patriarchal domination ... that suggests a link between male violence and a meat-based diet\". The phrase \"the personal is political\" is deeply embedded in ecofeminism, because just as it is hypocritical for feminists to buy products created in sweatshops, it is hypocritical for feminists to buy products produced by factory farming. Feminists recognize that buying and consuming these products, whether they are clothes made by a woman denied her Human rights in Cambodia or meat from a cow whose rights as a nonhuman animal were violated until it was killed, is an act of support to sweatshops and factory farming, but also to the larger patriarchal system at play.\n\nIt is also noted that vegetarianism can be a means to protest violence of all kinds because it believes that \"animals and humans suffer and die alike. Violence causes the same pain, the same spilling of blood, the same stench of death, the same arrogant, cruel and brutal taking of life.\" Vegetarianism is therefore a way that ecofeminists can embody their beliefs, because eating meat directly supports the domination of humans over nonhumans, speciesism, and the creation of hierarchies. Or in other words, \"the fact that our meat-advocating culture has successfully separated the consequence of eating animals from the experience of eating animals\". The dairy industry acquires revenue via artificial insemination and the consequential lactating of female bodies. When their calf is born, the newborn is immediately taken from their mother. If they are a male calf, they are destined to be sold to the veal or beef industry. If they are a female calf, they are destined to live the same dairy cow life as their mothers. Vegetarians are able to empathize with nonhuman animals and reject the notion of speciesism, and their diets reflect their beliefs. Vegetarian ecofeminists do the same but connect it to the larger picture of systematic oppression, and recognize that the only way that humans are able to justify their oppression of animals is to discredit the empathy and sympathy felt for nonhuman animals.\n\nWhile the goal of vegetarian ecofeminism is to end all oppression, it does focus on the connections between the oppression of nonhuman animals and the oppression of women. Both are objectified by men within the dominate discourse of the patriarchy, though in different ways: women are seen as sex objects and nonhuman animals are seen as food. In both instances, both beings are considered to be less than men, and therefore are able to be used, abused, and consumed by those with more privilege. There are often essentialistic and empathetic connections made between human mothers and nonhuman mothers, and ecofeminist scholar Carol Adams exemplifies this when she states \"As a lactating mother, I empathize with the sow whose reproductive freedoms have been denied and whose nursing experience seems so wretched.\" Generalizing women as mothers is problematic because not all women identify as mothers, yet there often is a strong link made between women and nonhuman animals due to their shared experience and oppression as mothers.\n\nThe egg, veal, and dairy industry directly profits from exploiting the reproductive system of female non-human animals. Similarly, many industries profit from objectifying, dominating, and consuming female human bodies. The advertising industry often objectifies women's bodies, as something to be dominated and consumed. Adams asserts that the culturally accepted belief that animal bodies are \"disposable objects for fun or eating\" emboldens the acceptance of \"heterosexuality as normative and the idea that pleasuring men is women's work\".\n\nWomen are often objectified by being compared to a piece of meat or dehumanized by being called a 'cow' or a 'bird'. There is indeed a history of dehumanization through equating humans to animals, which because of speciesism, means that they are devalued and considered to be less than other valued humans. This is often seen in cases of genocide, for in Rwanda the Tutsi were compared to cockroaches for many months leading up to the actual genocide. Viewing humans as animals makes it easier to oppress them, and thus it is once again clear that in order to end the oppression of humans, one must also work to end the oppression of nonhuman animals, because so long as nonhuman animals are viewed as inherently inferior to humans, dehumanization will continue to be justified with comparisons to nonhuman animals.\n\nSympathy towards nonhuman animals and recognizing that the same dominant power is abusing all of the oppressed is essential to ending all oppression because \"humans have an innate sense of sympathy and that this is the basis for moral awareness\", and are therefore able to make the moral and sympathetic connections between human experiences and nonhuman experiences. These can include the connection mothers will feel to cows being exploited for their milk, or the understanding among \"people of color, women, gays, and lesbians [who] all know the experience of being hunted-of being \"prey\" in Western culture.\" Vegetarian ecofeminists argue that as feminists, those who recognize the domination of the patriarchal power, should also recognize the way in which it dominates and objectifies nonhuman animals, and should therefore feel a moral obligation to end not only women's oppression, but animals' oppression as well.\n\nHarming animals goes against humans' natural instincts, and language is used to hide the harm humans cause nonhuman animals. In farming, the act of killing a nonhuman animal is not known as \"slaughter\" but as \"termination\" or \"meat-packing\" and the animals themselves are referred to as \"livestock\". This terminology prevents sympathy, through disconnecting the living animal from the product, and by masking the harm done to these nonhuman animals by humans. Another justification for exploiting and harming animals is that it is a necessary function in order for humans to survive. This is supported by the discourse that humans must consume meat and eggs in order to be healthy, or that animal testing must be used to advance medicine. So while humans are naturally empathetic and caring to nonhuman animals, there are a great deal of obstacles created by \"the substantial power of institutionalized animal exploitation [that] sustain ignorance, promote fear, reward cruelty, and punish kindness.\" These obstacles are deeply ingrained in many societies and thus social justice for nonhuman animals is often difficult to obtain.\n\n\"The feminist–vegetarian connection\" first appeared in Sheri Lucas' \"A Defense of the Feminist-Vegetarian Connection\", a response to Kathryn Paxton George's book \"Animal, Vegetable, or Woman? A Feminist Critique of Ethical Vegetarianism (2000)\". The feminist–vegetarian connection is a concept indicating that the oppression of animals in the form of being slaughtered and consumed is parallel to the oppression of women in a patriarchal society, which establishes a connection between feminism and vegetarianism. Carol. J. Adams first published on this topic in 1975. However, this topic was mentioned in 'few publications' for ten years afterwards. The lack of acknowledgment on this topic in the 1980s became a concern amongst feminists and, eventually, triggered the formation of an 'Ecofeminist Task Force' in 1990, raising awareness on the feminist–vegetarian connection. After 1990, this connection was extensively analysed in articles and journals by numerous scholars such as Josephine Donovan and Kathryn Paxton George.\n\nIn \"Animal, Vegetable, or Woman,\" Kathryn Paxton George invalidates the oppression of nonhuman animals, which is \"inconsistent with feminism or antithetical to its goals\" in her opinion. George argues in her essay \"Should Feminists be Vegetarians\" that \"these traditional arguments for ethical vegetarianism cannot be assimilated into a feminist ethic. Correlatively, limited consumption of animal products and, in some cases, meat is consistent with a feminist ethic\".\n\nGeorge's stance is based on human beings' physiology that conditions male to be more likely to succeed on a vegetarian diet than female. According to George, adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet poses risks on \"people identifiable by characteristics over which they have no choice or control: infants, children, adolescents, gestating or lactating women, some elderly people, and many people living in cultural and environmental circumstances that are not dependent on industrialized agriculture and high-tech society\". Based on George's scientific research, she discovered that women and children \"are more vulnerable to deficiencies of certain vitamins and minerals\". Especially children who adopt a vegan diet \"may lack sufficient quantities of vitamin D and B, iron, calcium, and zinc\". Vegan women may face the risk of being diagnosed with osteoporosis as a result of adopting diets that are low in calcium. George claims that \"milk is still recommended as the best source of calcium\" as calcium in plants \"either comes in a form the body cannot use very well or occurs in the presence of other compounds (such as phytates, fiber, cellulose, uronic acids, and oxalates in the case of calcium) that prevent its use\". Furthermore, lactating and gestating women may be at 'greater nutritional risk' which may negatively influence the health of the fetus or infant. In addition, George claims that \"even lacto-ovovegetarian diet poses some risks\". Along with children and women, people from developing countries where resources and education about taking iron and B supplements are not available can also be under the risk of iron deficiency.\n\nTo further support the argument, George claims that the research on plant-based nutrition was \"done almost entirely on men\" to support the statement that one does not need to eat animal products for good health. In George's opinion, the potential health risks brought by a vegetarian or vegan diet are \"rare for Western adult males, for whom the ideal is best suited\". Also, \"the nutritional evidence suggests that the best candidates for vegetarianism, and for veganism in particular, are young, healthy adult males\" because they do not have the nutritional stress \"from feeding a rapidly growing fetus nor are they unduly stressed by their own growth requirements, as most of their growth is accomplished\". In general, good health can be achieved and maintained on a vegetarian or vegan diet by privileged people who are \"adult [20–50-year-old] male, non-allergic, healthy, well-educated, middle or upper class individual or upper class female unable to bear children\". Everyone else who does not fall into the category of those privileged people is \"\"physiologically\" barred\" from both maintaining health and \"being fully moral\" of not consuming animals.\n\nIn \"A Defense of the Feminist-Vegetarian Connection,\" Lucas summarizes George's arguments on healthy vegetarian and vegan diets as diets that \"[requires] access to fortified foods, supplements, a dietitian, and many other advantages\". Therefore, an \"ecofeminist dilemma\" arises in the form that \"the entire human population cannot enjoy health on vegetarian diets unless an environmental dire spread of industrialization occurs\". According to George, even if fortified foods and supplements are already incorporated into one's diet, the risk of supplementation still takes its toll on people's health due to \"the possibility of toxicity, low availability, and interactions among supplements\".\n\nAccording to George, there are two \"minimum conceptions of a feminist ethics\": \"First, no ethics can permit arbitrariness in its prescriptions and theories,\" and, \"Second, any specific feminist ethic must affirm the value of the female body\". Thus, for George, \"any feminist ethic must reject (1) requiring women to live as if physiologically the same as men and (2) placing arbitrary burdens upon females that males do not have to bear\". However, in order to adopt a vegetarian or vegan diet, women are required \"to accept these burdens rather than reject them\". Therefore, this requirement upon women causes vegetarianism and veganism to \"hardly be a feminist ideal\". Instead, George thinks that semivegetarianism best embraces \"the value of health\" and that \"it would be more productive ... to improve conditions for animals and to urge truly balanced diets that are not excessive\".\n\nSome scholars such as Carol J. Adams and Josephine Donovan support the feminist–vegetarian connection. In \"The Sexual Politics of Meat: A Feminist-Vegetarian Critical Theory\", Adams establishes \"the cross-mapping between feminism and vegetarianism\" through an in-depth analysis of gender identification embedded in people's food choices. In a patriarchal society, \"meat is constant for men, intermittent for women\". For example, Ethiopian women and girls of all classes are obliged to prepare two meals, one for the males and a second, often containing no meat or other substantial protein, for the females. Also, women who prepare to be pregnant are told that \"one should eat meat (or fish, vegetables, chocolate, and salt) at least six weeks before becoming pregnant if one wants a boy. But if a girl is desired, no meat please, rather milk, cheese, nuts, beans, and cereals\". Additionally, there are cultural food taboos that concern meat consumption based on gender; women are commonly forbidden to have \"chicken, duck, and pork\" and also \"fish, seafood, and eggs\" in some Asian countries. Only \"vegetables and other nonmeat foods are viewed as women's food\". Thus, gender identification is heavily associated with the eating of animals; meat-eating links with masculinity while vegetable-eating suggests \"emasculation or femininity\". This gender-based reading of meat-eating is further accentuated by \"Derrida's notion of carnophallogocentrism,\" indicating that \"masculinity and carnivorism work together to support the virility, power, and authority of one who argues, dialogues, and speaks reasonably\".\n\nAdams also argues that animals and women are linked through \"fused oppressions\" as \"we oppress animals by associating them with women's lesser status\". Examples include the use of different gender pronouns based on whether an animal poses as having \"\"a major power\" (he) or \"a minor power\" (she)\". In this case, \"a major power\" refers to an active power and a possible danger to the speaker while \"a minor power\" refers to the power as a potential prey, a power that has to be destroyed. Adams further explains that \"'she' represents not only a 'minor power', but a vanished power, a soon-to-be-killed powerless animal\". Through Adams' analysis, a female-gendered pronoun becomes an indicator of the oppressed, \"representing the violated victim of male violence\". Thus, women and animals are linked through \"a shared and co-constitutive mechanism of oppression that manifests linguistically, particularly through metaphor\".\n\nIn addition, Adams indicates that people exploits animals' \"femaleness\" through the consumption of female animals such as hens and cows as well as their by-products such as eggs and dairy. In the meat industry, slaughters are told not to slaughter female animals \"in the advanced stage of pregnancy\" because \"the physiological condition of the female is disturbed and the flesh is not normal\". Conclusively, Adams states that \"the text of the body upon whom we write the fate of being meat is symbolically if not predominantly female\".\n\nFurthermore, Adams argues that the links between women and animals are reinforced \"through a structure of the absent referent\". For instance, animals whose flesh is called \"meat\" become \"absent referent\" through butchering; by renaming dead bodies as meat, people \"do not conjured dead, butchered animals, but cuisine\". On the other hand, Women also becomes absent in the language about sexual violence. For example, the term \"rape\" is used metaphorically to depict other devastating violent incidents, such as rape' of the earth in ecological writing of the early 1970s. In this case, the experiences of women are recalled \"as a vehicle for explicating another being's oppression\" yet women themselves are absent. According to Adams, violence against both women and animals in the form of \"sexual violence and meat eating ... find a point of intersection in the absent referent; ... if animals are the absent referent in the phrase 'the butchering of women', women are the absent referent in the phrase 'the rape of animals.\n\nVegetarian ecofeminism brings to light the interconnecting oppressions of women and animals within the patriarchal hierarchy. One primary issue that feminists address is autonomy over their bodies, independent and free from control from the church and the state. Vegan ecofeminist Marti Kheel contends that \"the lack of control that women have over their reproductive capacity in patriarchal society is magnified on factory farms where female cows are kept in a continual state of lactation, and where rape racks are routinely used to impregnate female animals\".\n\nAfter acknowledging the connections amongst vegetable-eating, women, and animals, Adams proposes that \"not only was vegetarianism a logical enacting of a moral viewpoint, but it also resonated with feminist theory and female experience\". According to ethicist Beverly Harrison, feminists must be with their bodies and acknowledge that all their knowledge, including their moral one, is 'body-mediated knowledge'; disconnecting from their bodies would result in the destruction of 'possibility of moral relations' amongst feminists. Adams further asserts that \"ethical vegetarianism is a theory people enact with their bodies\" as \"vegetarians identify a connection between a healthy body and a diet that honors the moral relations between us and other animals\". From a biological point of view, Adams supports the arguments that humans have bodies of herbivores as opposed to those of carnivores due to the biological evidences from humans' \"teeth, saliva, stomach acids, and length of the intestines\". Thus, vegetarianism and feminism are connected through the predominant involvement of one's body. Veganism is a method of rejection to partaking in the oppression of animals in a patriarchal culture.\n\nThrough evidences from several nutritional studies that prove the health benefits of vegetarian and vegan diets, Donovan explicitly proclaims that \"yes, feminists should be vegetarians\" one year after the publication of George's article \"Should Feminists be Vegetarians?\" in 1994. Donovan quotes \"Nutritional Consequences of Vegetarianism\" that with appropriate attention to nutritional needs, the health consequences of vegetarianism itself are neutral and in some respects may even be positive. Based on nutritional studies done in 1994, she also quotes that \"infant, children, adolescents, and pregnant women have ... special needs ... vegan diets can safely be used by these groups if foods, and in some instances, supplements, are selected which provide a healthful and nutritionally adequate diet ... In many cases, vegan diets offer health benefits\". Donovan also claims that \"most non-Western diets are largely vegetarian\" and meat-eating, as a 'Western norm', is imposed on non-Western countries through 'Western cultural imperialism'. Moreover, according to Lucas, \"in the West, nearly all of the available flesh, milk products, and eggs are the output of cruel, violet, and wasteful practices\". By extension, purchasing and consuming any animal products directly supports cruelty. Such evidences disproving the potential biological and environmental harm caused by vegetarianism accentuates the necessity of adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet while being a feminist. According to Donovan, \"feminism must take a stand against animal suffering and exploitation, including human consumption of meat\".\n\nWhile vegetarian ecofeminism is at its core an academic field, its main principles and ideas – eradicating all oppression by including speciesism and emphasizing the link between speciesism and sexism – can be transferred from theory into action through activism. Activism can take many forms, one of the most common and achievable being the power of boycotting products that support the exploitation and abuse of women and/or animals. For example, vegetarian ecofeminists might boycott products that were created in sweatshops and therefore exploited women, or products that were tested on animals or that were created by killing animals and therefore exploited nonhuman animals. The act of being a vegetarian or a vegan is itself a form of boycotting, for it choosing not to consume products that were created at the expense of killing or abusing nonhuman animals. Even at the Ecofeminist Task Force of the National Women's Studies Association suggested that no animal products should be served the 1990 NWSA meeting or at future conferences due to ecological and humane issues. Vegetarian ecofeminist might put their beliefs into practice by participating in demonstrations, as was seen at the 1990 March for the Animals in Washington, D.C., when ecofeminists carried a banner showing their support of recognizing how the domination of humans over nonhumans animals fits into ecofeminism, but also feminism in general.\n\nSince vegetarian ecofeminism is part of the larger academic field of ecofeminism, the most significant thinkers of vegetarian ecofeminism are part of both, but one of their focuses is connecting the domination of women to the domination of nonhuman animals, and understanding how animal liberation fits into ecofeminism.\n\nGreta Gaard is one of the main thinkers within ecofeminism in general, but especially within vegetarian ecofeminism. Aside from being an activist and a writer, she is also a professor at the University of Wisconsin, River Falls. Her essay entitled \"Vegetarian Ecofeminism\" speaks to many of the key concepts within the field, including the importance of including speciesism in ecofeminism.\n\nCarol J. Adams, both a vegetarian ecofeminist writer and activist, has spent over twenty years writing about ecofeminism, focusing on the importance of connecting speciesism to sexism. Her article entitled \"Ecofeminism and the Eating of Animals\" is an essential work to the field, and draws upon the importance of not consuming meat as an ecofeminist. Another one of her major works is \"The Sexual Politics of Meat\", which once again examines major themes in vegetarian ecofeminism.\n"}

The initiative's Secretariat is administered by the Washington, D.C. office of Foley Hoag, LLP.\n\nThe written principles represent a voluntary agreement between participating companies, governments and NGO's on what steps companies should take to ensure their security practices respect human rights. To distinguish between the principles and the multi-stakeholder initiative, the principles are frequently abbreviated to the VPs and the tripartite organization is abbreviated to the VPI (Voluntary Principles Initiative).\n\nThe introduction to the text of the VPs includes the following statement that captures the various interests that the principles attempt to address:\n“Acknowledging that security is a fundamental need, shared by individuals, communities, businesses, and governments alike, and acknowledging the difficult security issues faced by Companies operating globally, we recognize that security and respect for human rights can and should be consistent”\n\nThe VPs include provisions defining expectations that:\n\nThrough the inclusion of elements of the VPs in services contracts with security providers, the VPs have been cited as a precedent for the inclusion of codes of conduct in legal contracts.\n\nWhile the VPs aren't designed to deal with root causes of conflicts, they do guide companies to have measures in place to prevent conflicts from escalating to violent confrontation. In an April 2015 article in The newsletter of the International Council on Mining and Metals, International Alert noted that while this potential seems to be recognized at senior levels in companies that have committed to the VPs, there is work still to be done to better implement the principles \"on the ground\". This reflects both the challenges of translating the principles into practices appropriate in each operating context, and also challenges companies can have in engaging with, and reaching agreements with, public authorities in operating locations.\n\nThe Principles are significant in two ways:\n\nThe Principles have also been cited as an example of moving the notion of corporate citizenship from principle into practice, though the commitment by participating companies to follow the approach articulated in the Principles.\n\nThe Voluntary Principles Initiative (VPI) was established in 2000, and although developed before the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the VPs are consistent with the responsibility of business to respect human rights as outlined in the UN Guiding Principles.\n\nThe Initiative is a multi-stakeholder initiative composed of governments, multinational oil, gas, and mining companies, and non-governmental organizations. The initiative is chaired by a member government, rotating between country members annually. As of 2015 participants in the initiative include 9 national governments, 27 companies, and 10 non-governmental organizations. In 2010 the law firm Foley Hoag LLP was selected to act as the Secretariat of the VPI.\n\nThe VPI holds an annual two-day plenary meeting to discuss progress and issues in the implementation of the VPs and to agree on collective priorities for the Initiative in the following year.\n\nSupporting documentation produced by the VPI for the VPs includes definitions of role and responsibilities of participating companies, governments, and non-governmental organizations.\n\nMember organizations have also collaborated to produce guidance documents to assist companies and civil society organizations in working with the VPs. \n\nMember countries also make efforts to encourage companies operating internationally to adhere to the VPs. The Canadian government includes the VPs in its framework \"Doing Business the Canadian Way: A Strategy to Advance Corporate Social Responsibility in Canada’s Extractive Sector Abroad\". The Swiss government describes its efforts as both raising awareness of the VPs among mining companies based in Switzerland, and also engaging with host governments in resource rich countries to persuade those governments to join the initiative and also to promote dialogue between host governments, companies and civil society - particularly in Peru and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\n"}
