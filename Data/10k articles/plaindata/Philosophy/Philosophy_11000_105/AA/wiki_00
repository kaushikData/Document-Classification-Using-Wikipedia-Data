Therefore, a growing number of public institutions started a transition to free-software solutions. This does not only grant independence but can address the often argued need for public access to publicly-funded developments. In addition, this is the only way that public services can ensure that citizen data is handled in a trustworthy manner since non-free software wouldn't allow total control (or even knowledge) over the employed functions of the needed programs.\n\nThe Government of Assam state made open source a part of its IT policy.\n\nThe Government of Kerala, India, announced its official support for free/open-source software in its State IT Policy of 2001. This was formulated after the first-ever free-software conference in India, \"Freedom First!\", held in July 2001 in Thiruvananthapuram, the capital of Kerala, where Richard Stallman inaugurated the Free Software Foundation of India. Kerala's Government's support for Free Software in 2001 is perhaps the earliest instance of a Government supporting the use of Free Software.\n\nUnder the IT@School project the government of Kerala has adopted free and open sourced software for the schools.\n\nIn January 2010, the Government of Jordan announced that it has formed a partnership with Ingres Corporation, a leading open-source database-management company based in the United States that is now known as Actian Corporation, to promote the use of open-source software starting with university systems in Jordan.\n\nMalaysia launched the \"Malaysian Public Sector Open Source Software Program\", saving millions on proprietary-software licences till 2008.\n\nIn 2005 Vienna migrated Microsoft Office 2000 to OpenOffice.org and Microsoft Windows 2000 to Linux\n\nThe National Gendarmerie announced in March 2009 that it will totally switch to Ubuntu by 2015.

This policy mandates that at least 20% of custom source code developed by or for any agency of the federal government must be released as open-source software (OSS). In addition, the policy requires that all source code be shared between agencies. The public release is under a three-year pilot program and agencies are obliged to collect data on this pilot to gauge its performance. The overall policy aims to reduce duplication, avoid vendor 'lock-in', and stimulate collaborative development. A new website provides \"an online collection of tools, best practices, and schemas to help agencies implement this policy\", the policy announcement stated. It also provides the \"primary discoverability portal for custom-developed software intended both for Government-wide reuse and for release as OSS\". As yet unspecified OSS licenses will be added to the code. The US Chief Information Officer Tony Scott, co-author of the policy, blogged \"This is, after all, the People's code. Explore it. Learn from it. Improve it. Use it to propel America's next breakthrough in innovation.\"\n\nThe government of Brazil migrated from Microsoft Windows to Linux. In 2006, the Brazilian government also encouraged the distribution of cheap computers running Linux throughout its poorer communities by subsidizing their purchase with tax breaks.\n\nIn April, Ecuador passed a similar law, Decree 1014, designed to migrate the public sector to Libre Software.\n\nIn 2005, the Government of Peru voted to adopt open source across all its bodies. The 2002 response to Microsoft's critique is available online.

{"id": "3669631", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3669631", "title": "Affect (philosophy)", "text": "Affect (philosophy)\n\nAffect (from Latin \"affectus\" or \"adfectus\") is a concept, used in the philosophy of Baruch Spinoza and elaborated by Henri Bergson, Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, that places emphasis on bodily or embodied experience. The concept of affect takes on a different meaning in psychology and other fields. \n\nFor Spinoza, as discussed in Parts Two and Three of his \"Ethics\", affects are states of mind and body that are related to (but not exactly synonymous with) feelings and emotions, of which he says there are three primary kinds: pleasure or joy (\"laetitia\"), pain or sorrow (\"tristitia\") and desire (\"cupiditas\") or appetite. Subsequent philosophical usage by Gilles Deleuze, Félix Guattari and their translator Brian Massumi, while derived explicitly from Spinoza, tends to distinguish more sharply than Spinoza does between affect and what are conventionally called emotions. Affects are difficult to grasp and conceptualize because, as Spinoza says, \"an affect or passion of the mind [\"animi pathema\"] is a confused idea\" which is only perceived by the increase or decrease it causes in the body's vital force. The term \"affect\" is central to what has become known as the \"affective turn\" in the humanities and social sciences.\n\nIn Baruch Spinoza's \"Ethics\", Part III Definition 3, the term \"affect\" (\"affectus\", traditionally translated as \"emotion\") is the modification or variation produced in a body (including the mind) by an interaction with another body \"which increases or diminishes the body's power of activity\" (potentia agendi):\nAffect is thus a special case of the more neutral term \"affection\" (\"affectio\"), which designates the form \"taken on\" by some thing, the mode, state or quality of a body's relation to the world or nature (or infinite \"substance\"). In Part III, \"Definitions of the Emotions/Affects\", Spinoza defines 48 different forms of affect, including love and hatred, hope and fear, envy and compassion. They are nearly all manifestations of the three basic affects of:\nIn Spinoza's view, since God's power of activity is infinite, any affection which increases the organism's power of activity leads to greater perfection. Affects are transitional states or modes in that they are vital forces by which the organism strives to act against other forces which act on it and continually resist it or hold it in check.\n\nHenri Bergson contends in \"Matter and Memory\" (1896) that we do not know our body only \"from without\" by perceptions, but also \"from within\" by affections (French: \"affections\").\n\nThe terms \"affect\" and \"affection\" came to prominence in Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari's \"A Thousand Plateaus\", the second volume of \"Capitalism and Schizophrenia\". In his notes on the terminology employed, the translator Brian Massumi gives the following definitions of the terms as used in the volume:\nAffects, according to Deleuze, are not simple affections, as they are independent from their subject.\nArtists create affects and percepts, \"blocks of space-time\", whereas science works with functions, according to Deleuze, and philosophy creates concepts.\n\nSince 2000, a number of authors in the social sciences and humanities have begun to explore affect theory as a way of understanding spheres of experience (including bodily experience) which fall outside of the dominant paradigm of representation (based on rhetoric and semiotics); this movement has been called the affective turn. Consequently, these approaches are interested in the widest possible variety of interactions and encounters, interactions and encounters that are not necessarily limited to human sensibility. The translator of Deleuze and Guattari's \"A Thousand Plateaus\", Canadian political philosopher Brian Massumi, has given influential definitions of affect (see above) and has written on the neglected importance of movement and sensation in cultural formations and our interaction with real and virtual worlds. Likewise, geographer Nigel Thrift has explored the role of affect in what he terms \"non-representational theory\". In 2010, \"The Affect Theory Reader\" was published by Melissa Gregg and Gregory J. Seigworth and has provided the first compendium of affect theory writings.\nResearchers such as Mog Stapleton, Daniel D. Hutto and Peter Carruthers have pointed to the need to investigate and to develop the notions of affect and emotion. They hold that these are important in the developing paradigm of embodiment in cognitive science, in consciousness studies and the philosophy of mind. This step will be necessary for cognitive science, Mog Stapleton maintains, to be \"properly embodied\" cognitive science.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8656923", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8656923", "title": "Ahmad Fardid", "text": "Ahmad Fardid\n\nSeyyed Ahmad Fardid () (Born in 1912, Yazd – 16 August 1994, Tehran), born Ahmad Mahini Yazdi, was a prominent Iranian philosopher and an inspiring and dedicated professor of Tehran University. He is considered to be among the philosophical ideologues of the Islamic government of Iran which came to power in 1979. Fardid was under the influence of Martin Heidegger, the influential German philosopher, whom he considered \"the only Western philosopher who understood the world and the only philosopher whose insights were congruent with the principles of the Islamic Republic. These two figures, Khomeini and Heidegger, helped Fardid argue his position.\" What he decried was the anthropocentrism and rationalism brought by classical Greece, replacing the authority of God and faith with human reason, and in that regard he also criticized Islamic philosophers like al Farabi and Mulla Sadra for having absorbed Greek philosophy.\n\nFardid studied philosophy at Sorbonne university and University of Heidelberg. The sparsity of Fardid’s written work has led to his recognition as an \"oral philosopher\". This was, to be sure a puzzling attribute. Although Fardid tried to justify his expository reluctance to the poverty and contamination of the language, (in the Heideggerian sense) some suspect his reticence stemmed from his paralyzing perfectionism.\n\nFardid coined the concept of \"Westoxication\" which was then popularized by Jalal Al-e-Ahmad on his then widely known book Gharbzadegi, and after the Iranian Revolution of 1979, became among the core ideological teachings of the new Islamic government of Iran. Among those influenced by his thought are also included \"the theoretician of Islamic cinema\", Morteza Avini, and the former conservative president, Ahmadinejad. \n\nFardid's turbulent intellect was absorbed in the enterprise of synthesizing (promisingly or otherwise) the results of his studies of Eastern civilizations with the Western philosophy, as interpreted by Heidegger. Fardid's project remains unfinished and fraught with shortcomings and errors. Nevertheless, it remains an enormously intriguing and valuable endeavor. Heidegger himself on several occasions (including in his encounters with DT Suzuki concerning \"transmetaphysical thinking\" and in his valedictory interview with \"Der Spiegel\") optimistically alluded to the possibility of a convergence of Eastern and Western thought but he never explored the subject matter himself, citing a lack of knowledge and insight about the non-Western universe of discourse. Ahmad Fardid, from his corner, hoped to produce a blueprint for the endeavor, but he only succeeded in vaguely adumbrating certain contours of it. His influence is evident in the work of many philosophers in modern Iran even if that is left concealed in their biographies and writings due to the criticism that is generally directed at his thinking by intellectuals with liberal and leftist politics.\n\nAhmad Fardid has been widely denounced by prominent Iranian intellectuals such as Abdolkarim Soroush and Dariush Ashuri as a total fraud; and perhaps this is due to their own political commitments rather than being as such on purely philosophical grounds. Mahmoud Sadri, himself a student of Fardid in the seventies, has rejected such virulent ad hominem attacks on Fardid in an article for www.iranian.com.\nFardid rejected Human Rights declaring it a Western notion, and an instance of \"Westoxication\". Fardid often instructed his disciples, many of whom later became among the ruling clique of the Islamic government of Iran, to disregard such \"westoxicated\" concepts as democracy, civil rights, and tolerance, and instead to return to their \"authentic Oriental self\". Fardid was also a conspiracy theorist and an avid anti-Semite.\n\nAbdee Kalantari has described Fardid as \"a terrorist with 'philosophical' gloves\". Introducing Dariush Ashuri's famous exposé documenting Fardid's fraudulent scholarship, and the horrendous consequences of his anti-west, nativist views and teachings, Kalantari wrote:\n\nThose who remember the little clownish figure of Fardid on TV (Beyond the West and the East), with his stern but funny gestures and incomprehensive phrases, would enjoy the debunking of the ‘depth’ of this cartoon figure. But when they reach the final pages, blood is everywhere! They will be touched by an apt comparison and contrast with Sadegh Hedayat, whose gentle countenance lies silently next to the cold, pale, sleeping figures of all those murdered writers in morgue; all the victims who saw through the Oriental spirituality and anti-modern postures. Reminiscent of the work of Aramesh Dustdar thirty years ago, here Mr. Ashouri points his finger at, and then stirs some, the swamp. Fardid is dead but little Fardids are all around us. And not just of religious stripe. They come in all varieties: secular, left, right, liberal …When will this cycle end?\n\n"}

Leibniz introduced the concept of apperception into the more technical philosophical tradition, in his work \"Principes de la nature fondés en raison et de la grâce\"; although he used the word practically in the sense of the modern attention, by which an object is apprehended as \"not-self\" and yet in relation to the self.\n\nImmanuel Kant distinguished transcendental apperception from empirical apperception. The first is the perception of an object as involving the consciousness of the pure self as subject--\"the pure, original, unchangeable consciousness that is the necessary condition of experience and the ultimate foundation of the unity of experience.\" The second is \"the consciousness of the concrete actual self with its changing states\", the so-called \"inner sense.\" (Otto F. Kraushaar in \"Runes\"). Transcendental apperception is almost equivalent to self-consciousness; the existence of the ego may be more or less prominent, but it is always involved. See \"Kantianism\".\n\nThe German philosopher Theodor Lipps distinguished the terms perception and apperception in his 1902 work, \"Vom Fühlen, Wollen und Denken\". Perception, for Lipps, is a generic term that covers such psychic occurrences as auditory and tactile sensations, recollections, visual representations in memory, etc. But these perceptions do not always hold our conscious attention - perception is not always consciously noticed. Lipps uses the term apperception, then, to refer to attentive perception, wherein, in addition to merely perceiving an object, either one also consciously attends to the perceived object or one also attends to the very perception of the object. \n\nIn psychology, apperception is \"the process by which new experience is assimilated to and transformed by the residuum of past experience of an individual to form a new whole.\" In short, it is to perceive new experience in relation to past experience. The term is found in the early psychologies of Herbert Spencer, Hermann Lotze, and Wilhelm Wundt. It originally means passing the threshold into consciousness, i.e., to perceive. But the percept is changed when reaching consciousness due to the contextual presence of the other stuff already there, thus it is not perceived but apperceived.\n\nAccording to Johann Friedrich Herbart apperception is that process by which an aggregate or \"mass\" of presentations becomes systematized (\"apperceptions-system\") by the accretion of new elements, either sense-given or product of the inner workings of the mind. He thus emphasizes in apperception the connection with the self as resulting from the sum of antecedent experience. Hence in education the teacher should fully acquaint himself with the mental development of the pupil, in order that he may make full use of what the pupil already knows.\n\nApperception is thus a general term for all mental processes in which a presentation is brought into connection with an already existent and systematized mental conception, and thereby is classified, explained or, in a word, understood; e.g. a new scientific phenomenon is explained in the light of phenomena already analysed and classified. The whole intelligent life of man is, consciously or unconsciously, a process of apperception, in as much as every act of attention involves the appercipient process.\n\nA rich child and a poor child walking together come across the same ten dollar bill on the sidewalk. The rich child says it is not very much money and the poor child says it is a lot of money. The difference lies in how they \"apperceive\" the same event – the lens of past experience through which they see and value (or devalue) the money.|Christopher Ott\nIn epistemology, apperception is \"the introspective or reflective apprehension by the mind of its own inner states\".\n\n\n"}

This is normally a short-term committed relationship, where other titles (e.g., \"husband, partner\") are more commonly used for long-term committed relationships. A boyfriend can also be called an admirer, beau, suitor and sweetheart. The analogous female term is \"girlfriend\".\n\nPartners in committed non-marital relationships are also sometimes described as a \"significant other\" or \"partner\", \n\n\"Boyfriend\" and \"partner\" mean different things to different people; the distinctions between the terms are subjective. How the term is used will ultimately be determined by personal preference.\n\nA 2005 study of 115 people ages 21 to 35 who were either living with or had lived with a romantic partner notes that the lack of proper terms often leads to awkward situations, such as someone upset over not being introduced in social situations to avoid the question.\n\nThere is a significant difference between \"girlfriend\" and \"boyfriend\", and \"girl friend\" and \"boy friend\". In a strictly grammatical sense, a \"girlfriend\" or \"boyfriend\" is an 'individual of significance' with whom one shares a relationship.\n\nThe word \"dating\" entered the American language during the Roaring Twenties. Prior to that, courtship was a matter of family and community interest. Starting around the time of the American Civil War, courtship became a private matter for couples. In the early to mid 20th century in the US, women were often visited by \"gentleman callers\", single men who would arrive at the home of a young woman with the hopes of beginning a courtship. The era of the gentleman caller ended in the early 20th century and the modern idea of dating developed.\n\nIn literature, the term is discussed in July 1988 in Neil Bartlett's, \"Who Was That Man? A Present for Mr Oscar Wilde.\" On pages 108-110, Bartlett quotes from an issue of \"The Artist and Journal of Home Culture\", which refers to Alectryon as \"a boyfriend of Mars\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "13085503", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13085503", "title": "Church Educational System Honor Code", "text": "Church Educational System Honor Code\n\nThe Church Educational System (CES) Honor Code is a set of standards by which students and faculty attending a school owned and operated by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) are required to live. The most widely known university that is part of the Church Educational System (CES) that has adopted the honor code is Brigham Young University (BYU), located in Provo, Utah. The standards are largely derived from codes of conduct of the LDS Church, and were not put into written form until the 1940s. Since then, they have undergone several changes. The CES Honor Code also applies for students attending BYU's sister schools Brigham Young University–Idaho, Brigham Young University–Hawaii, and LDS Business College.\n\nEvery year BYU has an \"Honor Week\" dedicated to celebrating the legacy of the Honor Code and to remind students of the importance of following it. Early forms of the CES Honor Code are found as far back as the days of the Brigham Young Academy (1875–1903). Early school president, Karl G. Maeser. Maeser created the \"Domestic Organization\", which was a group of teachers who would visit students at their homes to see that they were following the school's moral rules. In the 1901 school catalog this guide of conduct included a prohibition on \"strong drink and tobacco\", \"profanity and obscenity\", attending parties not under the control of \"responsible persons\", \"keeping late hours, having improper associates, and visiting places of questionable repute\". Maeser also, however, relied largely on individual student's honor and honesty in keeping the rules, intending faculty visits as times of counsel rather than espionage. After George H. Brimhall served as president, enforcement became somewhat more lax (there were no more faculty visits), but adherence to the same basic principles were encouraged. From 1910 to 1960 the annual student catalog would only contain a few brief sentences on student conduct and discipline, often mentioning the prohibition of tobacco, \"improper associates\", and \"visiting places of questionable repute\", though the 1930s and 40s saw increased standards regarding rules related to student housing and the dress code. Women were allowed to wear slacks only on Saturdays, and men wore uniforms for a short time.\n\nIn 1949 students drafted the first Honor Code enforced by an Honor Council of students and administrators, and was used mainly for cases of cheating and academic dishonesty. The Student Honor Council, created around 1949, oversaw case violations. This council met with enough success among students in alleviating cheating that in 1957 BYU president Ernest L. Wilkinson suggested the Honor Code expand to include other school standards. This led to an expansion during the 1960s which created the bulk of what the Honor Code represents today: rules regarding chastity, dress, grooming, drugs, and alcohol. Instead of a short paragraph on university standards, the undergraduate catalog began printing a more detailed set of Honor Code policies in 1968, including a clause requiring students to act when observing any violation and a list of banned drugs (\"amphetamines, barbiturates, hallucinogenic drugs, psychedelic drugs, and narcotics\"). This change came because the administration completely took over the previously student run honor code and disbanded the student senate and student honor code committee. The honor code was expanded in the 1970 catalog with a requirement to adhere to the \"standards of dress\" and the addition of marijuana and LSD to the list of banned drugs.\n\nIn the 1960s, several rules regarding longer hairstyles in men were introduced after long hair on men became associated with the radical movements then springing up on college campuses around the country. However, long hair and beards were not completely against the rules until the mid-1970s with the 1978 annual catalog being the first edition to contain any detailed dress and grooming standards code. The 1960s also saw changes in rules regarding women's dress, as LDS Church leaders made statements against low-cut dresses and short skirts. By this time, women were allowed to wear slacks and pant-suits, but jeans were not allowed until 1981.\n\nThe CES Honor Code governs not only academic behavior but also everyday conduct on or off campus as well as dress and grooming standards of students and faculty, with the aim of providing an atmosphere consistent with LDS principles. The Honor Code requires:\n\n\nSpecific additional restrictions on appearance have been mentioned including those deemed as \"extreme fashion\" including a ban on shaved heads for women, blue hair, long nails or eyeshadow for men, and any piercings besides a single pair for women.\n\nBefore the 1960s there was little explicit mention of homosexuality by BYU administration, but by 1962 a ban on homosexual students was enacted. On 12 September 1962 Apostles Spencer W. Kimball and Mark E. Peterson and BYU President Ernest L. Wilkinson agreed on a university policy that \"no one will be admitted as a student ... whom we have convincing evidence is a homosexual\". They agreed to share information about individuals cases of homosexual members between general church administration and BYU administration. This policy was reiterated in Wilkinson's address to BYU in 1965 when he stated \"we [do not] intend to admit to this campus any homosexuals. ... [I]f any of you have this tendency, ... may I suggest you leave the University immediately ... We do not want others on this campus to be contaminated by your presence.\" The 1967 version of the Honor code stated that \"homosexuality will not be tolerated\" along with not approving \"any form of artificial birth control\".\n\nThe ban on any homosexually oriented students was softened a decade later by Wilkinson's successor Dallin H. Oaks in a 19 April 1973 Board of Trustees meeting. There it was decided BYU would allow students who had \"repented of\" homosexual acts and \"forsaken\" them for a \"lengthy period of time\". Additionally they would allow students \"guilty of irregular sexual behavior\" (not including fornication or adultery equivalents) who were \"repentant\" and \"showed evidence\" that the act(s) would \"not be repeated\" while still banning overt and active homosexuals.\n\nAccording to the Standards Office director from 1971 to 1981, all homosexual BYU students who were reported to the Standards Office (now called the Honor Code Office) were either expelled, or, for \"less serious\" offenses, were required to undergo therapy in order to remain at the university; in \"special cases\" this treatment included \"electroshock and vomiting aversion therapies\". This program of aversion therapy—which spanned from the late 1950s until at least the late 1970s—was dedicated to \"curing\" male homosexual students reported by bishops and BYU administrators through administering electrical shocks or vomit inducing drugs while showing \"nude\" pictures of men to the patient in an attempt to associate pain with homosexual visual stimulation.\n\nIn the late 1990s a reference to homosexual conduct was added to the code, and in 2001 Associate Dean of Students Lane Fischer over the BYU Honor Code Office stated that it was inappropriate for a BYU student to advocate for the [homosexual] lifestyle by publishing material or participating in public demonstrations as well as advertising ones same-sex preference in any public way. He also required homosexual students facing discipline to refrain from same-sex \"dating, holding hands, kissing, romantic touching, showering, clubbing, ets., as well as regular association with homosexual men.\"\n\nIn 2007, BYU changed the honor code to read that stating one's sexual orientation was not an honor code issue while removing the phrase that \"any behaviors that indicate homosexual conduct, including those not sexual in nature, are inappropriate and violate the Honor Code.\" The change also clarified the policy on advocacy of LGBTQ rights or romantic relationships. Several students, including gay and lesbian students, thought that the previous wording was confusing and unclear. While both homosexuals and heterosexuals must abide by the church's law of chastity (i.e. no sexual relations outside of marriage, no crude language, and no pornography), the Honor Code additionally prohibits all forms of physical intimacy that give expression to homosexual feelings (i.e. dating, kissing). There is no similar restriction against expressing heterosexual feelings. The first explicit mention of homosexuality in the language of the school's code of conduct available to students was not noted until the Fall of 2009. Both this version and the 2010 versions contained a clause banning homosexual advocacy defined as \"seeking to influence others to engage in homosexual behavior or promoting homosexual relations as being morally acceptable.\" In early 2011, BYU quietly removed the clause prohibiting advocacy.\n\nHonor code policies and principles are promoted by BYUSA, the campus student association, and the Honor Code Office. The office handles all accusations and violations, and works in conjunction with bishops of BYU wards. If the student's bishop is thought to be able to corroborate the alleged infraction, the accused student may be required to sign a legal form waiving his or her rights to ecclesiastical privacy, which allows the school direct access to the bishop and any content discussed on the said topic, or others which may have been in violation of the Honor Code, but not yet reported. Not all students at the school are familiar with LDS standards, so students who break the code for the first time are usually only contacted by mail as a warning and clarification of standards. Later violations may cause the student to be called into the office to speak with an Honor Code officer. Severe and continued violations can merit expulsion. Students may be brought to the attention of the Honor Code office by faculty, staff, or other students but \"no anonymous reports will be acted upon\". BYU Events Staff patrol school dances for Honor Code violations. Cafeteria, library, athletics, and BYU Testing Center employees are asked to encourage students to follow dress and grooming standards, sometimes denying service to students not adhering to the code. In 2001 it was reported that less than 2 or 3 percent of BYU students are referred to the Honor Code Office annually, though no percentage on punitive actions were given. Data from 1955, however, showed that 9 students were expelled, 23 were suspended, and 72 were placed on probation.\n\nIn regards to facial hair restrictions, permission to wear facial hair can be granted in three specific cases: For men with skin conditions aggravated by shaving, for theatrical performances, and (since a policy change in January 2015) for religious reasons. In regards to medical exemptions, students/faculty must visit a BYU Student Health Center doctor who will fax a recommendation to the Honor Code office. The student/faculty must then visit the office to fill out the requisite exemption paperwork. A new BYU ID card is issued including a symbol marked \"BE\" and a photograph with the facial hair. In regards to theater exemptions, students or faculty must obtain written permission from the theater or film company explaining the need for facial hair. Such exemptions are only granted for the duration of the production. Thus, in such cases a temporary exemption card issued. Religious exemptions will be coordinated through the university chaplain's office.\n\nStudents are required to sign in agreement to the Honor Code, Dress and Grooming Standards, Residential Living Guidelines, and Academic Honesty Policy yearly. Additionally they must have a yearly interview with a leader of their local religious congregation, or (for religious students or those without a local congregation) the non-denominational BYU chaplain and maintain this ecclesiastical endorsement to attend BYU. In the past about 5% of BYU was not LDS, but that number has shrunk closer to 1% in recent years. The chaplain or religious leader is instructed to inquire about the student's and understanding of and adherence to specific policies. These include the ban on the consumption of specific substances, viewing pornography, any extramarital heterosexual \"relations\", any homosexual conduct, and adherence to the Honor Code, Dress and Grooming Standards, Residential Living Guidelines, and Academic Honesty Policy on and off campus. LDS bishops and branch presidents are additionally instructed to verify that LDS students demonstrate \"appropriate and consistent church activity\", \"abid[e] by the standards of the Church\", and are in \"full fellowship\". The chaplain or religious leader can revoke the endorsement at any time.\n\nAs of 2017, the enforcement of the BYU's Honor Code is directed by Spencer Hawkins, who is under Vice Dean of Students Casey Peterson, who is under Dean of Students Vernon Heperi. Over the Office of Student Life is Vice President Janet S. Scharman, who reports to university president Kevin J Worthen, who is under the BYU Board of Trustees, which is composed of general authorities and general officers of the LDS Church.\n\nStudents have the option of living in on-campus housing, with family members who reside in the local area, or in off-campus housing which must pass a school inspection for health and safety, as well as satisfactory separation of gender quarters and compliance with other standards. Students under certain conditions can apply for a housing waiver for special approval.\nThis approval is designed to ensure that students live in a safe environment that is consistent with the standards of the University. Since students are only allowed to live in BYU-approved housing, landlords in the area consider it important to meet the standard in order to gain residents. The housing standards mandate that bathrooms and bedrooms be off limits to those of the opposite sex. Members of the opposite sex are required to be out of the apartment by midnight. Guns are permitted in off-campus housing only if the gun owner receives written permission from both the landlord and all residents in the apartment.\n\nIn 2003, BYU announced that beginning in 2007, housing would only be approved if it was within of campus. The school did this out of concern that its Office of Residence Life was being stretched too thin and was unable to meet demands. Students feared the new boundaries might lead to a rise in apartment prices and decrease the amount of available housing. According to BYU, the effect would be minimal, as 98 percent of students already lived within the designated area. About 40 properties lost BYU approval due to the new guideline.\n\nThere has been several controversies surrounding BYU's honor code, with criticism from students, advocacy groups, local governmental institutions, and national press coverage.\n\nAs part of a BYU ban on websites containing sexual content, the popular website YouTube was blocked on all BYU networks. In 2007 Fox News highlighted BYU's blocking of pornographic and other sites, including YouTube, from campus Internet connections, pursuant to the code's prohibition of the viewing of pornographic material. BYU lifted the YouTube ban in 2009, again receiving nationwide press attention.\n\nAccording to BYU spokesperson Carri Jenkins, LDS BYU students who experience a transition in faith views away from church orthodoxy are \"not eligible to attend BYU\" and are thus not granted religious freedom by the university. There are many non-believing and former Mormons on campus, and some have been expelled for publicly expressing disagreement or doubt. In 2014, the organization FreeBYU composed of BYU alumni and students asked the BYU Board of Trustees to reform the Honor Code to allow LDS students to change their religion, then subsequently challenged BYU's accreditation by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities on the basis of the honor code's suppression of academic and religious freedom. In 2015, religion scholar Dr. Mark Juergensmeyer boycotted a religious freedom conference held on BYU campus in protest over its policy of expelling and terminating LDS students who lose their faith. In 2015-2016, the American Bar Association reviewed formal complaints stemming from a student's allegations that the honor code violates the Association's non-discrimination standards; the student had written a book that laid out why same-sex marriage was not, according to his research, at odds with the LDS Church's teachings. Shortly after the submission of the American Bar Association complaint, BYU added an \"Application for Exception\" clause that would theoretically enable a formerly LDS applicant to be accepted if certain criteria are met.\n\nBeginning in 2014 and continuing through 2016, several students have alleged that when they reported being raped, the school punished them for violating the honor code. Some students report that, after having been victimized by a rapist, they were told they were guilty of sexual sin because of past actions that came to light in connection to their sexual assaults. This atmosphere may prevent some students from being willing to report similar crimes to police, a situation that local law enforcement have publicly criticized. The Victim Services Coordinator of the Provo Police Department called for an amnesty clause to be added to the Honor Code which would excuse rape survivors for past infractions of BYU policies. Hollingshead states \"The victim of a sexual assault will never be referred to the Honor Code Office for being a victim of sexual assault. A report of sexual assault would always be referred to the BYU Title IX Office – not to the Honor Code office.\" BYU launched a review of the practice which concluded in October 2016. BYU announced several changes to how it would handle sexual assault reports, including adding an amnesty clause for the victim of sexual misconduct, and ensuring under most circumstances that information is not shared between the Title IX Office and Honor Code Office without the survivor's consent. According to a Spring 2017 BYU survey answered by over 40% of BYU students, 6.5% of women and 1.2% of men experienced unwanted sexual contact in the last year as BYU students. Of those, 64% of these incidents were not reported to any formal organization with 21% of those who did not report the crime citing a fear of Honor Code discipline or their ecclesiastical endorsement being questioned as a reason for not reporting.\n\nControversy surrounding the BYU's honor code has grown since 2014, with criticism from students, advocacy groups, local governmental institutions, and national press coverage. Various LGBT advocacy groups have protested the honor code and criticized it as being anti-gay, In the fall of 2016 BYU faced national criticism when many called its Honor Code policies for LGBT students discriminatory while the university was being considered as an addition to the Big 12 Conference. The Princeton Review has regularly ranked BYU among the most LGBT-unfriendly schools in the United States and the campus currently offers no official LGBT-specific resources after revoking permission in 2012 for the unofficial university gay-straight alliance USGA to continue meeting on campus.\n\nIn March 2008, the University of Texas at San Antonio was accused of plagiarizing a portion of BYU's honor code related to cheating and plagiarism. Southern Virginia University, which also espouses LDS standards, uses a similar code of conduct.\n\nThe Honor Code received national attention in March 2011 when the university dismissed BYU basketball player Brandon Davies from the team for violating the code, reportedly by having premarital sex, the same day the college basketball rankings came out listing BYU as the #3 team in the nation. Davies was reinstated to the university the next school year, and returned to the basketball team, where he completed his athletic eligibility in 2013.\n\nThe CES Honor Code has been criticized at various times including by Darron Smith, a former BYU instructor, Marcus Whalen, a BYU football player, and Don Harwell, president of Genesis, as being applied in a racially disparate manner on many occasions. However, Vai Sikahema, a former BYU football player and native Tongan, has defended the honor code enforcement as not racist citing a number of players, of various racial backgrounds, who had positive experiences at BYU.\n\nBYU students led a campaign to loosen the beard restrictions in 2014, but it had the opposite effect at Church Educational System schools: some students who had previously been granted beard exceptions were found no longer to qualify, and for a brief period the LDS Business College required students with a registered exception to wear a \"beard badge\", which was likened to a \"badge of shame\". Some students also join in with shaming their fellow beard-wearing students, even those with registered exceptions.\n\n\n"}

According to the Census and Statistics Department of Hong Kong, a third of secondary school students went for private tutoring in the 2004–05 school year, spending a total of HK$18.9 million per month (2.42 million). On the lower estimate, the whole industry is worth more than HK$400 million, and according to other reports, the industry is generating more than US$3.6 billion a year. Amongst these, Modern Education and Beacon College are the only listed operations.\n\nThese establishments cater to the 478 thousand secondary school students in Hong Kong (2008 figures). The schools focus on the two major local public examinations, namely HKDSE and HKALE. Cram schools focus on teaching examination techniques as well as providing students tips on topics which may appear on the coming examination. Monthly tuition fees per subject in 2009 were approximately HK$400 (US$51) for each student. The fee for a course, such as English, can be HK$100 per hour. In 2015, fees were stable at around HK$500, due to tough competition amongst tuition centres and falling school rolls due to demographic factors. The use of video tutorials, pioneered by Kevin Ko, has become a permanent feature in the industry in Hong Kong. Multimedia technology has permitted the leveraging of classes simultaneously to hundreds of students at two or more different locations.\n\nThe Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups surveyed 524 year five to year twelve pupils in 2012, 63 per cent of respondents said they were being tutored; approximately 56 per cent of those spent at least HK$1,000 a month on tuition fees. The popularity of tutoring has been fuelled by aggressive social pressures and competition for university places for subjects such as medicine and law.\n\nTutors are independent contractors to cram schools, who share their revenue with tutors. Tutors on the other hand bear their own overheads, such as advertising and promotion expenses; many hire assistants to research course materials and to answer students' queries. The share of gross revenues paid to tutors may depend on their bargaining power (popularity), and whether classes are live or virtual. Media reported that the more successful amongst these are able to obtain a 60% share. Some liken themselves to stage performers, so cultivate their images and daily rehearse new content or delivery. There are said to be approximately 20 such 'star tutors' in number within the industry in 2007, who made monthly gross revenues of HK$1 million or above. Public disclosures made during the 2014/15 fiscal year by two leading cram schools indicated that Modern Education paid fees ranging from about HK$2 million to around HK$15 million to five tutors; Beacon College paid its top tutor HK$35 million in the same year, and another four tutors averaged approximately HK$4.8 million each. By comparison, Hong Kong secondary school teachers earnings are capped at $68,915, and a primary school teacher was earning maximum $52,815 in 2009. Some of the tutors, or \"presenters\", are model-turned. \n\nThe schools apply a fandom approach to promote tutors, who dress fashionably and are given nicknames like \"the Godfather of Science,\" \"Brand-A tutor\", \"Super tutor\" or the \"Queen of English.\" They can be seen on billboards, full-page newspaper ads and TV screens in railway stations or on buses. Some of them have their own teams of stylists, fashion designers and photographers; many have personal web sites. Ken Ng, founder of Modern Education, claims credit for initiating this trend, and for \"liberat[ing] the very feudal education system\" whilst making a lot of money.\n\nUnlike individual private tutors who advertise on sites such as adpost, kijiji and craiglist, cram schools regularly spend a lot on millions on front pages of papers, on the MTR and on buses. Multimedia techniques are increasingly deployed. To increase yield, once traditional classes are now supplemented by classes transmitted by video feed. Since around 2004, tutors have produced promotional videos for posting to YouTube.\n\nIn late 2015, media reported that Modern Education was overtly trying to poach a \"star tutor\" employed by a competitor. The tutor, likely to have been responsible for over 40 percent of the fees generated by rival Beacon College, was reported to have been offered a lucrative package representing an estimated HK$85 million (US$10.97 million) a year. The package included $30 million signing bonus plus 65% of all the revenue he generates throughout his 4-year contract period. Modern Education took out full-page advertising in two local journals to vaunt its offer publicly. Beacon College had revealed in its 2015 application for listing of the HK Stock Exchange that it made HK$236.4 million, HK$337.9 million, and HK$327.8 million in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively, and that its unnamed “top one tutor” was responsible for generating 43.6 percent, 45.5 percent and 40.5 percent of its turnover in those three years respectively. The brazen attempt of Modern Education to poach the Chinese tutor signalled to investors the extent that these schools may be dependent on a single teacher.\n\nFernando Cheung , a member of the Legislative Council panel on education questioned the purpose of the money fuelling Hong Kong’s cram culture. Cheung said: “Our children are pushed into a system where they have to go through exercise after exercise, extracurricular activities, exam preparation and all that. Even when kids take up activities in arts and sports, they’re just there to be competitive and put one more thing on their resumes”.\n\nIn May 2008, the Independent Commission Against Corruption of Hong Kong stepped in to investigate allegations that HKCEE examination papers had been bought, and that K. Oten of Modern Education had sent out an analysis the current year's paper to examination candidates by text message during the exam. His employers immediately distanced themselves, saying he had been terminated. Oten had previously been dismissed by King's Glory in April 2006 on several counts of violating his employment contract. The court found him in breach, and ordered him to pay HK$8.87 million in damages to his former employers.\n\nFor his satirical dramatisation of the tutoring sector entitled \"Trick or Cheat\" 《愛出貓》, Hong Kong director Oxide Pang was sued by one of the sector's biggest stars for libel. Kevin Ko, co-founder of Ever Learning, alleges the film was a libellous portrayal of him. The film's main character, named Seven Ko, uses all manner of unethical means, including bribery and having sex with an exams official to gain access to examination questions.\n\nIn 2002 and again in 2010, Chinese star tutor Siu Yuen became embroiled in controversies when his teaching manuals included essay answers that bore uncanny resemblances to the year end examinations. His teaching materials for written Chinese in 2010 included notes on how to write an essay on a cinema on fire, which turned out to closely resemble a written question the fifth form Chinese public exam the same year. Siu was accused of possessing insider knowledge.\n\nAccording to the Education Bureau, there are almost 7,500 tutorial centres and branches across Hong Kong. The ones with larger scale operations include:\n"}
{"id": "14654024", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14654024", "title": "Elitism", "text": "Elitism\n\nElitism is the belief or attitude that individuals who form an elite — a select group of people with a certain ancestry, intrinsic quality, high intellect, wealth, special skills, or experience — are more likely to be constructive to society as a whole, and therefore deserve influence or authority greater than that of others. In the United States, the term \"elitism\" often refers to the concentration of power in the Northeast Corridor and on the West Coast, where the typical American elite resides – journalists, lawyers, doctors, high-level civil servants, businesspeople, university lecturers, entrepreneurs, and financial advisors in the quaternary sector, often in established technological or political catchments of their higher education alma mater.\n\nAlternatively, the term \"elitism\" may be used to describe a situation in which power is concentrated in the hands of a limited number of people. Oppositions of elitism include anti-elitism, egalitarianism, populism and political theory of pluralism.\n\nElite theory is the sociological or political science analysis of elite influence in society: elite theorists regard pluralism as a utopian ideal. Elitism is closely related to social class and what sociologists call social stratification, which in the Anglo Saxon tradition have long been anchored in the \"blue blood\" claims of hereditary nobility. Members of the upper classes are sometimes known as the social elite. The term \"elitism\" is also sometimes used to denote situations in which a group of people claiming to possess high abilities or simply an in-group or cadre grant themselves extra privileges at the expense of others. This form of elitism may be described as \"discrimination\".\n\nAttributes that identify an elite vary; personal achievement may not be essential. Elitist status \"can\" be based on personal achievement, such as degrees from top-rate universities or impressive internships and job offers, it can (in archaic societies) be based on lineage or passed-on fame from parents or grandparents. As a term, \"elite\" usually describes a person or group of people who are members of the uppermost class of society, and wealth can contribute to that class determination. Personal attributes commonly purported by elitist theorists to be characteristic of the elite include: rigorous study of, or great accomplishment within, a particular field; a long track record of competence in a demanding field; an extensive history of dedication and effort in service to a specific discipline (e.g., medicine or law) or a high degree of accomplishment, training or wisdom within a given field. Elitists tend to favor social systems such as meritocracy, technocracy and plutocracy as opposed to radical democracy, political egalitarianism and populism. Elitists also believe only a few \"shakers and movers\" truly change society rather than society being changed by the majority of people who only vote and elect the elites into power. To elitists, the public is abjectly powerless and can be manipulated only by the top group of elites.\n\nSome synonyms for \"elite\" might be \"upper-class\" or \"aristocratic\", indicating that the individual in question has a relatively large degree of control over a society's means of production. This includes those who gain this position due to socioeconomic means and not personal achievement. However, these terms are misleading when discussing elitism as a political theory, because they are often associated with negative \"class\" connotations and fail to appreciate a more unbiased exploration of the philosophy.\n\nElitism in the context of education is the practice of concentrating attention on or allocating funding to the best students, or those students who rank highest in a particular field of endeavour. For example, a politician who promotes advanced classes for students deemed to be highly intelligent might be accused of elitism, even if this were argued to promote an egalitarian goal, such as curing disease. Elitism in education could be based on conventional assessment of learning ability, knowledge, or other abilities. However, an \"elite\" school can also mean a school for the wealthy or one that is hard to enter.\n\nThe term \"elitism\" and the pejorative title \"elitist\" are sometimes used by people who are not (or, who claim not to be) members of elite organizations. In politics, such terms are often used to disparage a politician's views as out of touch with the interests of the \"average Joe\". The implication is that the alleged elitist person or group thinks they are better than everyone else, and put themselves before others as a result. The definition of \"elitist\" is similar to that of the word \"snob\".\n\nAn elitist is not always seen as truly elite, but only privileged. The definition may have different appreciations depending on the political contexts. Since elitism may be viewed as something necessary for creating patterns of good intellectual or professional performance, it can be used also for maintaining conditions of lack of competition and privilege.\n\nAn early proponent of anti-elitism was Georges Sorel.\n\nElitism endorses the exclusion of large numbers of people from positions of privilege or power. Thus, many populists seek the (perceived, if not present in practice) social equality of egalitarianism, populism, socialism, or communism. They may also support affirmative action, social security, luxury taxes, and highly progressive taxes for the wealthiest members of society. All of these measures seek to reduce the difference of power between the elite and the ordinary. However, these measures to reduce difference could be seen as anti-meritocratic in that they avoid rewarding or promoting those who are the most competitive or provide the most effort in their endeavors.\n\nThe terms \"elitism\" and \"meritocracy\" are not equivalent in meaning. Professor Kenneth Paul Tan at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy asserts that \"Meritocracy, in trying to 'isolate' merit by treating people with fundamentally unequal backgrounds as superficially the same, can be a practice that ignores and even conceals the real advantages and disadvantages that are unevenly distributed to different segments of an inherently unequal society, a practice that in fact perpetuates this fundamental inequality. In this way, those who are picked by meritocracy as having merit may already have enjoyed unfair advantages from the very beginning, ignored according to the principle of nondiscrimination.\"\n\n"}

In philosophy he mostly specialised in pedagogy.\n\nBonnici was born in Cospicua, Malta, on July 14, 1853. However, when still very young, his family moved to Mqabba. He graduated as Doctor of Theology from the University of Malta in 1872 and was ordained priest in 1876. He taught languages for many years at the bishop’s major seminary at Mdina, and was Rector at the bishop’s minor seminary at Floriana. He was nominated a canon of the bishop’s cathedral chapter in 1882.\n\nThroughout the years, Bonnici endeavoured to create institutions of Christian charity. In 1884 he founded a popular educational itinerary mission for children, and in 1888 he began a shelter for homeless boys at Ħamrun, where it also had a small printing press for educational purposes. Bonnici further founded a congregation of Brothers of Charity to keep up his work at the shelter. Moreover, he also founded a crèche for homeless babies.\n\nDespite his hard and wide pastoral work, Bonnici engaged himself in serious study, both of theology and philosophy. In 1890 he was appointed Professor of the Chair of Philosophy at the University of Malta, an office he held for ten years, up till 1900. During the last two years of his life, he was very ill, having spent all his energies in indefatigable work. He was only fifty-three years of age when he died on December 24, 1905. Though he was buried at the Mdina cathedral, his body was later transferred to the Boys’ Shelter in Ħamrun.\n\nBonnici’s philosophical writings do not seem to be many. Nevertheless, one composition stands out from the rest. It is his 1893 pamphlet La Pedagogia e la Filosofia (Pedagogy and Philosophy), printed at his own printing press in Ħamrun by his homeless boys (Tipografia della Casa di S. Giuseppe). The work is in Italian, and is made up of 22 pages. The writing has no divisions or parts. In fact, it is an address which Bonnici delivered at the Malta National Library in Valletta on October 2, 1893, on the occasion of the opening of the academic year 1893/94 for public schools. Bonnici dedicated the work to his parents and teachers. In it he deals with the relation between the philosophy of education and the theory of education (pedagogy). Bonnici sustains his views with philosophical arguments and submits to the idea that education is the root to all progress.\n\n"}
{"id": "25342166", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25342166", "title": "Friedrich Nietzsche's views on women", "text": "Friedrich Nietzsche's views on women\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche's views on women have attracted controversy, beginning during his life and continuing to the present.\n\nIda von Miaskowski remarked in her memoir, published 7 years after his death:In the eighties, when Nietzsche's later writings containing some of the oft-quoted sharp words against women appeared, my husband sometimes told me jokingly not to tell people of my friendly relations with Nietzsche, since this was not very flattering for me. It was just a joke. My husband, like myself, always kept friendly memories of Nietzsche [...] his behavior precisely towards women was so sensitive, so natural and comradely, that even today in old age I cannot regard Nietzsche as a despiser of women.\n\nNietzsche wrote specifically about his views on women in Section VII of \"Human, All Too Human\", which seems to hold women in high regard; but given some of his other comments, his overall attitude towards women is ambivalent. For instance, while in \"Human, All Too Human\", he states that \"the perfect woman is a higher type of human than the perfect man, and also something much more rare,\" there are a number of contradictions and subtleties in Nietzsche's thought elsewhere which are not easily reconcilable. He could be both in praise and contempt of women at one time or another. For instance, in the following passage: \"What inspires respect for woman, and often enough even fear, is her nature, which is more “natural” than man’s, the genuine, cunning suppleness of a beast of prey, the tiger’s claw under the glove, the naiveté of her egoism, her uneducability and inner wildness, the incomprehensibility, scope, and movement of her desires and virtues.\" (\"Beyond Good and Evil\", section 239.)\n\nHis attitude can sometimes be entirely disparaging: \"From the beginning, nothing has been more alien, repugnant, and hostile to woman than truth—her great art is the lie, her highest concern is mere appearance and beauty.\" In section 6 in \"Why I Write Such Excellent Books\" of \"Ecce Homo\", he claims that \"goodness\" in women is a sign of \"physiological degeneration\", and that women are on the whole cleverer and more wicked than men- which in Nietzsche's view, constitutes a compliment. Yet he goes on to claim that the emancipation of women, and feminists, was merely the resentment of some women against other women, who were physically better constituted and able to bear children.\n\nDespite Nietzsche's writings being viewed as being misogynistic by many, others, such as Anthony Ludovici, insist that he is only an anti-feminist, not a misogynist. Other writings include:\n\n\"Woman's love involves injustice and blindness against everything that she does not love... Woman is not yet capable of friendship: women are still cats and birds. Or at best cows... (\"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\", On the Friend)\n\n\"Woman! One-half of mankind is weak, typically sick, changeable, inconstant... she needs a religion of weakness that glorifies being weak, loving, and being humble as divine: or better, she makes the strong weak--she rules when she succeeds in overcoming the strong... Woman has always conspired with the types of decadence, the priests, against the 'powerful', the 'strong', the men-\" (The Will to Power - 864, Second German edition of 1906) (It must be noted, however, that \"The Will to Power\" is a gathering of notes and fragments assembled through his sister Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche and others which were never approved by Nietzsche himself to be published.)\n\nScholars of Aristotle have drawn comparisons between Nietzsche's views on women and Aristotle's views on women. They have argued that Nietzsche may have borrowed much of his political philosophy from the latter.\n\nSome philosophers have even suggested that Nietzsche's philosophy cannot be understood or analyzed apart from his remarks on women. They discuss the fact that Nietzsche's work has been useful in the development of some feminist theory but ultimately conclude \"While Nietzsche challenges traditional hierarchies between mind and body, reason and irrationality, nature and culture, truth and fiction - hierarchies that have been used to degrade and exclude women - his remarks about women and his use of feminine and maternal metaphors throughout his writings confound attempts simply to proclaim Nietzsche a champion of feminism or women.\"\n\nLou Andreas-Salomé, who knew Nietzsche very well, and claimed that he had proposed to her (according to her, she refused him) claimed there was something feminine in Nietzsche's \"spiritual nature\", and that he had considered genius to be a feminine genius.\n\nFrances Nesbitt Oppel interprets Nietzsche's attitude towards women as part of a rhetorical strategy...Nietzsche's apparent misogyny is part of his overall strategy to demonstrate that our attitudes toward sex-gender are thoroughly cultural, are often destructive of our own potential as individuals and as a species, and may be changed. What looks like misogyny may be understood as part of a larger strategy whereby \"woman-as-such\" (the universal essence of woman with timeless character traits) is shown to be a product of male desire, a construct.\n\nOthers exhibit a less tolerant sophistication, though some recognize that Nietzsche made these remarks from a consciously relative position, and while they show little patience for his remarks overall they recognize that however odious his individual opinion of women may have been, he was not advocating it as a model for others. Cornelia Klinger states in her book \"Continental Philosophy in Feminist Perspective\": \"Nietzsche, like Schopenhauer a prominent hater of women, at least relativizes his savage statements about woman-as-such.\" One of Nietzsche's own statements is cited in support of this assertion:\"Whenever a cardinal problem is at stake, there speaks an unchangeable \"this is I\"; about man and woman, for example, a thinker cannot relearn but only finish learning–only discover ultimately how this is \"settled in him.\" At times we find certain solutions of problems that inspire strong faith in \"us\"; some call them henceforth \"their\" \"convictions.\" Later–we see them only as steps to self-knowledge, signposts to the problem we \"are\"–rather, to the great stupidity we are, to our spiritual \"fatum\", to what is \"unteachable\" very \"deep down\". After this abundant civility that I have just evidenced in relation to myself I shall perhaps be permitted more readily to state a few truths about \"woman as such\"–assuming that it is now known from the outset how very much these are after all only–\"my\" truths.\" (BGE, 7, 231)\n\nAnother author takes up this same quote, recognizing that \"[a]lthough Nietzsche as generously as ever saves his commentators the labor of interpretation the problem recurs precisely because of the nature of what he proceeds to call his truths.\" But instead of focusing on putative misogyny she opines:Much more [...] must be thought to affect everything Nietzsche writes about woman. Rather than mere psychological digs and constructions, rather than a simple expression of his own misogyny, Nietzsche's philosophic expression of the nature of woman reflects and repeats the possibilities of the affirmation or denial of illusion. This is Nietzsche's understanding of truth, and to this extent Nietzsche was able to exploit his own misogyny, in style, tracing the Platonic metaphor as such.\n\nAs Leonard Lawlor and Zeynep Direk point out, \"What Nietzsche \"says\" -and repeats with hysterical insistence- is that woman is the source of all folly and unreason, the siren figure who lures the male philosopher out of his appointed truth-seeking path.\"\n"}

Jardine was transferred in October 1760 from the parish school to Glasgow College, and after passing through the arts and divinity courses (MA 1765), was licensed to preach by the presbytery of Linlithgow.\n\nIn 1770 he went to Paris as tutor to the sons of William Mure of Caldwell, who obtained for him from David Hume introductions to Helvetius and D'Alembert. Soon after his return from France in July 1773, he failed to secure election to the chair of humanity at Glasgow, by a single vote, but in June 1774 was appointed professor of Greek and assistant professor in logic. In 1787 he became sole professor of logic.\n\nJardine gave a practical turn to the teaching of his chair, and established a system of daily examination. His classes rose from an average of fifty to nearly two hundred. He expounded his principles of teaching in his \"Outlines of Philosophical Education\", published at Glasgow, 1818; 2nd edit. 1825. He was also an administrator and brought the finances of the college to order.\n\nHe had a country house, \"Hallside\" (near Cambuslang and modern-day Drumsagard Village) constructed in 1790.\n\nHe was one of the founders in 1792, and afterwards for more than twenty years secretary, of Glasgow Royal Infirmary. For over thirty years he was the representative of the presbytery of Hamilton in the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. He retired from the chair of logic in 1824, and died on 27 January 1827.\n\nHe is buried in the Lindsay plot on the north side of the churchyard around Glasgow Cathedral.\n\nIn 1776 Jardine married Janet Lindsay, daughter of John Lindsay, founder in Glasgow. She died in 1815. They had one son, John Jardine, advocate, who held the office of sheriff of Ross and Cromarty, and died in 1850.\n\nThey are both buried with him.\n\nAmong those apparently influenced by Jardine was Alexander Campbell, founder of Bethany College, West Virginia. Jardine's pupils included Christopher North and Sir William Hamilton.\n\nJardine's portrait, by John Graham-Gilbert, hangs in the Hunterian Art Gallery in Glasgow. He was also painted by Thomas Hodgetts in 1827.\n\n"}

The idea has been proposed by geneticist Dean Hamer in the 2004 book called \"\".\n\nThe God gene hypothesis is based on a combination of behavioral genetic, neurobiological and psychological studies. The major arguments of the hypothesis are: (1) spirituality can be quantified by psychometric measurements; (2) the underlying tendency to spirituality is partially heritable; (3) part of this heritability can be attributed to the gene VMAT2; (4) this gene acts by altering monoamine levels; and (5) spirituality provides an evolutionary advantage by providing individuals with an innate sense of optimism.\n\nAccording to the God Gene hypothesis, spirituality has a genetic component, of which (VMAT2) comprises one component by contributing to sensations associated with mystic experiences, including the presence of God and feelings of connection to a larger universe.\n\nThe research uses the self-transcendence scale developed by psychologist Robert Cloninger to quantify spirituality using three sub-scales: \"self-forgetfulness\" (as in the tendency to become totally absorbed in some activity, such as reading); \"transpersonal identification\" (a feeling of connectedness to a larger universe); and \"mysticism\" (an openness to believe things that remain unproven, such as ESP). Cloninger suggests that taken together, these measurements are a reasonable way to quantify (make measurable) an individual's propensity to spiritual.\n\nThe self-transcendence measure was shown to be heritable by classical twin studies conducted by Lindon Eaves and Nicholas Martin. Their work demonstrated that approximately 40% of the variation in self-transcendence was due to genes. By contrast, specific religious beliefs (such as belief in a particular deity) were found to have no genetic basis and are instead cultural units or memes. Similar conclusions were drawn from studies of identical twins reared apart.\n\nIn order to identify some of the specific genes involved in self-transcendence, Hamer analyzed DNA and personality score data from over 1,000 individuals and identified one particular locus, VMAT2, with a significant correlation. VMAT2 codes for a vesicular monoamine transporter that plays a key role in regulating the levels of the brain chemicals serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine. These monoamine transmitters are in turn postulated to play an important role in regulating the brain activities associated with mystic beliefs.\n\nHamer hypothesized that self-transcendence might provide an evolutionary advantage by providing human beings with an innate sense of optimism that gives people the will to keep on living and procreating, despite the inevitability of death, and promoting better health and recovery from diseases.\n\nIn the brain, VMAT2 proteins are located on synaptic vesicles. VMAT2 transports monoamine neurotransmitters from the cytosol of monoamine neurons into vesicles. PZ Myers argues: \"It's a pump. A teeny-tiny pump responsible for packaging a neurotransmitter for export during brain activity. Yes, it's important, and it may even be active and necessary during higher order processing, like religious thought. But one thing it isn't is a 'god gene.'\"\n\nCarl Zimmer claimed that VMAT2 can be characterized as a gene that accounts for less than one percent of the variance of self-transcendence scores. These, Zimmer says, can signify anything from belonging to the Green Party to believing in ESP. Zimmer also points out that the God Gene theory is based on only one unpublished, unreplicated study. However Hamer notes that the importance of the VMAT2 finding is not that it explains all spiritual or religious feelings, but rather that it points the way toward one neurobiological pathway that may be important.\n\nJohn Polkinghorne, an Anglican priest, member of the Royal Society and Canon Theologian at Liverpool Cathedral, was asked for a comment on Hamer's theory by the British national daily newspaper, \"The Daily Telegraph\". He replied: \"The idea of a God gene goes against all my personal theological convictions. You can't cut faith down to the lowest common denominator of genetic survival. It shows the poverty of reductionist thinking.\" \n\nWalter Houston, the chaplain of Mansfield College, Oxford, and a fellow in theology, told the \"Telegraph\": \"Religious belief is not just related to a person's constitution; it's related to society, tradition, character—everything's involved. Having a gene that could do all that seems pretty unlikely to me.\"\n\nHamer responded that the existence of such a gene would not be incompatible with the existence of a personal God: \"Religious believers can point to the existence of God genes as one more sign of the creator's ingenuity—a clever way to help humans acknowledge and embrace a divine presence.\" He repeatedly notes in his book that, \"This book is about whether God genes exist, not about whether there is a God.\"\n\n\n\n"}

Moral absolutism is the ethical view that certain actions are absolutely right or wrong regardless of other contexts such as their consequences or the intentions behind them. Graded absolutism is moral absolutism but qualifies that a moral absolute, like \"Do not kill,\" can be greater or lesser than another moral absolute, like \"Do not lie\". Also called contextual absolutism or the greater good view, is an alternative to the third alternative view and the lesser evil view, both discussed below, regarding moral conflict resolution.\n\nAccording to graded absolutism, in moral conflicts, the dilemma is not that we are obligated to opposites, because greater absolutes are not opposites of lesser absolutes, and evil is not the opposite of good but is instead the privation of good. Since evil is the privation of good, only the privation of the greater good counts as evil, since whenever there is a moral conflict, we are only obligated to the greater good. The real dilemma is that we cannot perform both conflicting absolutes at the same time. 'Which' absolutes are in conflict depends on the context, but which conflicting absolute is ‘greater’ does not depend on the context. That is why graded absolutism is also called 'contextual absolutism' but is not to be confused with situational ethics. The conflict is resolved in acting according to the greater absolute. That is why graded absolutism is also called the 'greater good view', but is not to be confused with utilitarianism.\n\nThis is the view that there are never any real moral conflicts and that there is always a third alternative. For example, instead of answering in the affirmative or negative to the Nazi at the door, one may simply withhold an answer.\n\nThe lesser evil view is the view that the only way out of a moral conflict is to violate one of the moral absolutes and choose the lesser evil. For example, if we disagree with Kant's thoughts on the categorical imperative and say that lying is a lesser evil than helping a would-be murderer, the lesser evil view would have us lie rather than help a would-be murderer. According to the proponent of graded absolutism, this violates the ought implies can principle and defeats itself in obligating evil.\n\nThe greater good view is the view that there are real moral conflicts between absolutes, but rather than requiring a third alternative (as in the case of the third alternative view above) or obligating evil (as in the case of the lesser evil view above), this view obligates the greater absolute, or greater good. For example, when one saves a life rather than telling the truth to a would-be murderer, one is committing the greater good of saving life, rather than violating the lesser good of telling the truth or committing the lesser (than aiding a murderer) evil of lying. Since evil is the privation of good, only the privation of the greater good counts as evil, since whenever there is a moral conflict, we are only obligated to the greater good.\n\n\n\n"}

Lee had also filed a Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau report against the monk.\n\nThe two were in a dispute over the ownership of a Buddhist sculpture valued around over $1 million. Lee Boon Teow has sued the monk for defamation over a series of group chat messages that the former abbot had shared with other management committee members, where Guo Jun had allegedly implied that Lee's company was in financial difficulties and questioned if his cancer relapse was affecting his judgement and decision-making. Lee claimed that Guo Jun discredited him as he had uncovered the monk's alleged impropriety. Guo Jun countersued Lee, claiming ownership of the sculpture and asked for its return. The sculpture was returned to Guo Jun in December 2017. \n\nOn 24 October 2017, a settlement was reached over the defamation lawsuit, with Guo Jun offering to pay $30,000 to Lee Boon Teow to settle the case, without admitting to any defamation or guilt. \n\nIn November 2017, Lee also told the High Court that his monetary contributions for the monk to pursue a doctoral degree was used by Guo Jun to buy a A$545,000 property in Sydney, Australia. Guo Jun believed that the money had been given to him as a gift for his own use. During the proceedings, Guo Jun disclosed that he has at least A$3 million in assets in 2009, and that he has a \"different interpretation\" of Buddhist concepts of austerity; he believes he should manage his own financial assets and expenditure, without disclosing them to the monastery or its management committee.\n\n"}

The injunction had been issued because of the hindrance to transportation of U.S. Mail. However, Debs refused to end the strike and was cited for contempt of court; he appealed the decision to the courts. The main question being debated was whether the President had a right to issue the injunction, which dealt with both interstate and intrastate commerce and shipping on rail cars. The legislative branch had never delegated to the President the power to issue an injunction. However, in a unanimous decision written by Justice David Josiah Brewer, the court ruled in favor of the U.S. government. Joined by Chief Justice Melville Fuller and Associate Justices Stephen Johnson Field, John Marshall Harlan, Horace Gray, Henry Billings Brown, George Shiras, Jr., Howell Edmunds Jackson and Edward Douglass White, the court ruled that the government had a right to regulate interstate commerce and ensure the operations of the Postal Service, along with a responsibility to \"ensure the general welfare of the public.\" \n\nThe constitution is interpreted by the government and the people.

That is, any object (or class) that satisfies A’s specification also satisfies B’s specification, because B’s specification is weaker.\n\nThe \"is-a\" relationship is to be contrasted with the \"has-a\" (\"has_a\" or \"has a\") relationship between types (classes); confusing the relations \"has-a\" and \"is-a\" is a common error when designing a model (e.g., a computer program) of the real-world relationship between an object and its subordinate. The \"is-a\" relationship may also be contrasted with the \"instance-of\" relationship between objects (instances) and types (classes): see \"type-token distinction\" and \"type-token relations.\"\n\nTo summarize the relations, we have\n\n\nSubtyping enables a given type to be substituted for another type or abstraction. Subtyping is said to establish an is-a relationship between the subtype and some existing abstraction, either implicitly or explicitly, depending on language support. The relationship can be expressed explicitly via inheritance in languages that support inheritance as a subtyping mechanism.\n\nThe following C++ code establishes an explicit inheritance relationship between classes B and A, where B is both a subclass and a subtype of A, and can be used as an A wherever a B is specified (via a reference, a pointer or the object itself).\n\nThe following python code establishes an explicit inheritance relationship between classes B and A, where B is both a subclass and a subtype of A, and can be used as an A wherever a B is required.\n\nThe following example, type(a) is a \"regular\" type, and type(type(a)) is a metatype. While as distributed all types have the same metatype (PyType_Type, which is also its own metatype), this is not a requirement. The type of classic classes, known as types.ClassType, can also be considered a distinct metatype.\n\nIn Java, is-a relation between the type parameters of one class or interface and the type parameters of another are determined by the extends and implements clauses.\n\nUsing the Collections classes, ArrayList<E> implements List<E>, and List<E> extends Collection<E>. So ArrayList<String> is a subtype of List<String>, which is a subtype of Collection<String>. The subtyping relationship is preserved between the types automatically. When we define an interface, PayloadList, that associates an optional value of generic type P with each element. Its declaration might look like:\n\nThe following parameterizations of PayloadList are subtypes of List<String>:\n\nLiskov substitution principle explains a property, \"If for each object o1 of type S there is an object o2 of type T such that for all programs P defined in terms of T, the behavior of P is unchanged when o1 is substituted for o2 then S is a subtype of T,\". Following example shows a violation of LSP.\nObviously, the DrawShape function is badly formatted. It has to know about every derivative classes of Shape class. Also, it should be changed whenever new subclass of Shape are created. In object-oriented design, many view the structure of this as anathema.\n\nHere is a more subtle example of violation of LSP:\nThis works well but when it comes to Square class, which inherits Rectangle class, it violates LSP even though the is-a relationship holds between Rectangle and Square. Because square is rectangular. The following example overrides two functions, Setwidth and SetHeight, to fix the problem. But fixing the code implies that the design is faulty.\n\nThe following example, function g just works for Rectangle class but not for Square, and so the open-closed principle has been violated.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "15624", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15624", "title": "Judaism", "text": "Judaism\n\nJudaism (originally from Hebrew , \"Yehudah\", \"Judah\"; via Latin and Greek) is the religion of the Jewish people. It is an ancient, monotheistic, Abrahamic religion with the Torah as its foundational text. It encompasses the religion, philosophy, and culture of the Jewish people. Judaism is considered by religious Jews to be the expression of the covenant that God established with the Children of Israel. Judaism encompasses a wide corpus of texts, practices, theological positions, and forms of organization. The Torah is part of the larger text known as the Tanakh or the Hebrew Bible, and supplemental oral tradition represented by later texts such as the Midrash and the Talmud. With between 14.5 and 17.4 million adherents worldwide, Judaism is the tenth largest religion in the world.\n\nWithin Judaism there are a variety of movements, most of which emerged from Rabbinic Judaism, which holds that God revealed his laws and commandments to Moses on Mount Sinai in the form of both the Written and Oral Torah. Historically, this assertion was challenged by various groups such as the Sadducees and Hellenistic Judaism during the Second Temple period; the Karaites and Sabbateans during the early and later medieval period; and among segments of the modern non-Orthodox denominations. Modern branches of Judaism such as Humanistic Judaism may be nontheistic. Today, the largest Jewish religious movements are Orthodox Judaism (Haredi Judaism and Modern Orthodox Judaism), Conservative Judaism, and Reform Judaism. Major sources of difference between these groups are their approaches to Jewish law, the authority of the Rabbinic tradition, and the significance of the State of Israel. Orthodox Judaism maintains that the Torah and Jewish law are divine in origin, eternal and unalterable, and that they should be strictly followed. Conservative and Reform Judaism are more liberal, with Conservative Judaism generally promoting a more traditionalist interpretation of Judaism's requirements than Reform Judaism. A typical Reform position is that Jewish law should be viewed as a set of general guidelines rather than as a set of restrictions and obligations whose observance is required of all Jews. Historically, special courts enforced Jewish law; today, these courts still exist but the practice of Judaism is mostly voluntary. Authority on theological and legal matters is not vested in any one person or organization, but in the sacred texts and the rabbis and scholars who interpret them.\n\nThe history of Judaism spans more than 3,000 years. Judaism has its roots as an organized religion in the Middle East during the Bronze Age. Judaism is considered one of the oldest monotheistic religions. The Hebrews and Israelites were already referred to as \"Jews\" in later books of the Tanakh such as the Book of Esther, with the term Jews replacing the title \"Children of Israel\". Judaism's texts, traditions and values strongly influenced later Abrahamic religions, including Christianity, Islam and the Baha'i Faith. Many aspects of Judaism have also directly or indirectly influenced secular Western ethics and civil law. Hebraism was just as important a factor in the ancient era development of Western civilization as Hellenism, and Judaism, as the background of Christianity, has considerably shaped Western ideals and morality since Early Christianity.\n\nJews are an ethnoreligious group including those born Jewish, in addition to converts to Judaism. In 2015, the world Jewish population was estimated at about 14.3 million, or roughly 0.2% of the total world population. About 43% of all Jews reside in Israel and another 43% reside in the United States and Canada, with most of the remainder living in Europe, and other minority groups spread throughout Latin America, Asia, Africa, and Australia.\n\nUnlike other ancient Near Eastern gods, the Hebrew God is portrayed as unitary and solitary; consequently, the Hebrew God's principal relationships are not with other gods, but with the world, and more specifically, with the people he created. Judaism thus begins with ethical monotheism: the belief that God is one and is concerned with the actions of mankind. According to the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible), God promised Abraham to make of his offspring a great nation. Many generations later, he commanded the nation of Israel to love and worship only one God; that is, the Jewish nation is to reciprocate God's concern for the world. He also commanded the Jewish people to love one another; that is, Jews are to imitate God's love for people. These commandments are but two of a large corpus of commandments and laws that constitute this covenant, which is the substance of Judaism.\n\nThus, although there is an esoteric tradition in Judaism (Kabbalah), Rabbinic scholar Max Kadushin has characterized normative Judaism as \"normal mysticism\", because it involves everyday personal experiences of God through ways or modes that are common to all Jews. This is played out through the observance of the Halakha (Jewish law) and given verbal expression in the Birkat Ha-Mizvot, the short blessings that are spoken every time a positive commandment is to be fulfilled.\nWhereas Jewish philosophers often debate whether God is immanent or transcendent, and whether people have free will or their lives are determined, Halakha is a system through which any Jew acts to bring God into the world.\n\nEthical monotheism is central in all sacred or normative texts of Judaism. However, monotheism has not always been followed in practice. The Jewish Bible (Tanakh) records and repeatedly condemns the widespread worship of other gods in ancient Israel. In the Greco-Roman era, many different interpretations of monotheism existed in Judaism, including the interpretations that gave rise to Christianity.\n\nMoreover, some have argued that Judaism is a non-creedal religion that does not require one to believe in God. For some, observance of Jewish law is more important than belief in God \"per se\". In modern times, some liberal Jewish movements do not accept the existence of a personified deity active in history. The debate about whether one can speak of authentic or normative Judaism is not only a debate among religious Jews but also among historians.\n\nScholars throughout Jewish history have proposed numerous formulations of Judaism's core tenets, all of which have met with criticism. The most popular formulation is Maimonides' thirteen principles of faith, developed in the 12th century. According to Maimonides, any Jew who rejects even one of these principles would be considered an apostate and a heretic. Jewish scholars have held points of view diverging in various ways from Maimonides' principles.\n\nIn Maimonides' time, his list of tenets was criticized by Hasdai Crescas and Joseph Albo. Albo and the Raavad argued that Maimonides' principles contained too many items that, while true, were not fundamentals of the faith.\n\nAlong these lines, the ancient historian Josephus emphasized practices and observances rather than religious beliefs, associating apostasy with a failure to observe Jewish law and maintaining that the requirements for conversion to Judaism included circumcision and adherence to traditional customs. Maimonides' principles were largely ignored over the next few centuries. Later, two poetic restatements of these principles (\"\"Ani Ma'amin\" and \"Yigdal\"\") became integrated into many Jewish liturgies, leading to their eventual near-universal acceptance.\n\nIn modern times, Judaism lacks a centralized authority that would dictate an exact religious dogma. Because of this, many different variations on the basic beliefs are considered within the scope of Judaism. Even so, all Jewish religious movements are, to a greater or lesser extent, based on the principles of the Hebrew Bible and various commentaries such as the Talmud and Midrash. Judaism also universally recognizes the Biblical Covenant between God and the Patriarch Abraham as well as the additional aspects of the Covenant revealed to Moses, who is considered Judaism's greatest prophet. In the Mishnah, a core text of Rabbinic Judaism, acceptance of the Divine origins of this covenant is considered an essential aspect of Judaism and those who reject the Covenant forfeit their share in the World to Come.\n\nEstablishing the core tenets of Judaism in the modern era is even more difficult, given the number and diversity of the contemporary Jewish denominations. Even if to restrict the problem to the most influential intellectual trends of the nineteenth and twentieth century, the matter remains complicated. Thus for instance, Joseph Soloveitchik's (associated with the Modern Orthodox movement) answer to modernity is constituted upon the identification of Judaism with following the halakha whereas its ultimate goal is to bring the holiness down to the world. Mordecai Kaplan, the founder of the Reconstructionist Judaism, abandons the idea of religion for the sake of identifying Judaism with civilization and by means of the latter term and secular translation of the core ideas, he tries to embrace as many Jewish denominations as possible. In turn, Solomon Schechter's Conservative Judaism was identical with the tradition understood as the interpretation of Torah, in itself being the history of the constant updates and adjustment of the Law performed by means of the creative interpretation. Finally, David Philipson draws the outlines of the Reform movement in Judaism by opposing it to the strict and traditional rabbinical approach and thus comes to the conclusions similar to that of the Conservative movement.\n\nThe following is a basic, structured list of the central works of Jewish practice and thought.\n\nMany traditional Jewish texts are available online in various Torah databases (electronic versions of the Traditional Jewish Bookshelf). Many of these have advanced search options available.\n\nThe basis of Jewish law and tradition (halakha) is the Torah (also known as the Pentateuch or the Five Books of Moses). According to rabbinic tradition, there are 613 commandments in the Torah. Some of these laws are directed only to men or to women, some only to the ancient priestly groups, the Kohanim and Leviyim (members of the tribe of Levi), some only to farmers within the Land of Israel. Many laws were only applicable when the Temple in Jerusalem existed, and only 369 of these commandments are still applicable today.\n\nWhile there have been Jewish groups whose beliefs were based on the written text of the Torah alone (e.g., the Sadducees, and the Karaites), most Jews believe in the oral law. These oral traditions were transmitted by the Pharisee school of thought of ancient Judaism and were later recorded in written form and expanded upon by the rabbis.\n\nAccording to Rabbinical Jewish tradition, God gave both the Written Law (the Torah) and the Oral law to Moses on Mount Sinai. The Oral law is the oral tradition as relayed by God to Moses and from him, transmitted and taught to the sages (rabbinic leaders) of each subsequent generation.\n\nFor centuries, the Torah appeared only as a written text transmitted in parallel with the oral tradition. Fearing that the oral teachings might be forgotten, Rabbi Judah haNasi undertook the mission of consolidating the various opinions into one body of law which became known as the \"Mishnah\".\n\nThe Mishnah consists of 63 tractates codifying Jewish law, which are the basis of the \"Talmud.\" According to Abraham ben David, the \"Mishnah\" was compiled by Rabbi Judah haNasi after the destruction of Jerusalem, in anno mundi 3949, which corresponds to 189 CE.\n\nOver the next four centuries, the Mishnah underwent discussion and debate in both of the world's major Jewish communities (in Israel and Babylonia). The commentaries from each of these communities were eventually compiled into the two Talmuds, the Jerusalem Talmud (\"Talmud Yerushalmi\") and the Babylonian Talmud (\"Talmud Bavli\"). These have been further expounded by commentaries of various Torah scholars during the ages.\n\nIn the text of the Torah, many words are left undefined and many procedures are mentioned without explanation or instructions. Such phenomena are sometimes offered to validate the viewpoint that the Written Law has always been transmitted with a parallel oral tradition, illustrating the assumption that the reader is already familiar with the details from other, i.e., oral, sources.\n\nHalakha, the rabbinic Jewish way of life, then, is based on a combined reading of the Torah, and the oral tradition—the Mishnah, the halakhic Midrash, the Talmud and its commentaries. The Halakha has developed slowly, through a precedent-based system. The literature of questions to rabbis, and their considered answers, is referred to as responsa (in Hebrew, \"Sheelot U-Teshuvot\".) Over time, as practices develop, codes of Jewish law are written that are based on the responsa; the most important code, the Shulchan Aruch, largely determines Orthodox religious practice today.\n\nJewish philosophy refers to the conjunction between serious study of philosophy and Jewish theology. Major Jewish philosophers include Solomon ibn Gabirol, Saadia Gaon, Judah Halevi, Maimonides, and Gersonides. Major changes occurred in response to the Enlightenment (late 18th to early 19th century) leading to the post-Enlightenment Jewish philosophers. Modern Jewish philosophy consists of both Orthodox and non-Orthodox oriented philosophy. Notable among Orthodox Jewish philosophers are Eliyahu Eliezer Dessler, Joseph B. Soloveitchik, and Yitzchok Hutner. Well-known non-Orthodox Jewish philosophers include Martin Buber, Franz Rosenzweig, Mordecai Kaplan, Abraham Joshua Heschel, Will Herberg, and Emmanuel Lévinas.\n\nOrthodox and many other Jews do not believe that the revealed Torah consists solely of its written contents, but of its interpretations as well. The study of Torah (in its widest sense, to include both poetry, narrative, and law, and both the Hebrew Bible and the Talmud) is in Judaism itself a sacred act of central importance. For the sages of the Mishnah and Talmud, and for their successors today, the study of Torah was therefore not merely a means to learn the contents of God's revelation, but an end in itself. According to the Talmud,\nIn Judaism, \"the study of Torah can be a means of experiencing God\". Reflecting on the contribution of the Amoraim and Tanaim to contemporary Judaism, Professor Jacob Neusner observed:\nTo study the Written Torah and the Oral Torah in light of each other is thus also to study \"how\" to study the word of God.\n\nIn the study of Torah, the sages formulated and followed various logical and hermeneutical principles. According to David Stern, all Rabbinic hermeneutics rest on two basic axioms:\nThese two principles make possible a great variety of interpretations. According to the Talmud,\nObservant Jews thus view the Torah as dynamic, because it contains within it a host of interpretations\n\nAccording to Rabbinic tradition, all valid interpretations of the written Torah were revealed to Moses at Sinai in oral form, and handed down from teacher to pupil (The oral revelation is in effect coextensive with the Talmud itself). When different rabbis forwarded conflicting interpretations, they sometimes appealed to hermeneutic principles to legitimize their arguments; some rabbis claim that these principles were themselves revealed by God to Moses at Sinai.\n\nThus, Hillel called attention to seven commonly used hermeneutical principles in the interpretation of laws (baraita at the beginning of Sifra); R. Ishmael, thirteen (baraita at the beginning of Sifra; this collection is largely an amplification of that of Hillel). Eliezer b. Jose ha-Gelili listed 32, largely used for the exegesis of narrative elements of Torah. All the hermeneutic rules scattered through the Talmudim and Midrashim have been collected by Malbim in \"Ayyelet ha-Shachar\", the introduction to his commentary on the Sifra. Nevertheless, R. Ishmael's 13 principles are perhaps the ones most widely known; they constitute an important, and one of Judaism's earliest, contributions to logic, hermeneutics, and jurisprudence. Judah Hadassi incorporated Ishmael's principles into Karaite Judaism in the 12th century. Today R. Ishmael's 13 principles are incorporated into the Jewish prayer book to be read by observant Jews on a daily basis.\n\nThe term \"Judaism\" derives from \"Iudaismus\", a Latinized form of the Ancient Greek \"Ioudaismos\" (Ἰουδαϊσμός) (from the verb , \"to side with or imitate the [Judeans]\"). Its ultimate source was the Hebrew יהודה, \"Yehudah\", \"Judah\", which is also the source of the Hebrew term for Judaism: יַהֲדוּת, \"Yahadut\". The term \"Ἰουδαϊσμός\" first appears in the Hellenistic Greek book of 2 Maccabees in the 2nd century BCE. In the context of the age and period it meant \"seeking or forming part of a cultural entity\" and it resembled its antonym \"hellenismos\", a word that signified a people's submission to Hellenic (Greek) cultural norms. The conflict between \"iudaismos\" and \"hellenismos\" lay behind the Maccabean revolt and hence the invention of the term \"iudaismos\".\n\nShaye J. D. Cohen writes in his book \"The Beginnings of Jewishness\":\n\nAccording to the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" the earliest citation in English where the term was used to mean \"the profession or practice of the Jewish religion; the religious system or polity of the Jews\" is Robert Fabyan's \"The newe cronycles of Englande and of Fraunce\" (1516). \"Judaism\" as a direct translation of the Latin \"Iudaismus\" first occurred in a 1611 English translation of the apocrypha (Deuterocanon in Catholic and Eastern Orthodoxy), 2 Macc. ii. 21: \"Those that behaved themselves manfully to their honour for Iudaisme.\"\n\nAccording to Daniel Boyarin, the underlying distinction between religion and ethnicity is foreign to Judaism itself, and is one form of the dualism between spirit and flesh that has its origin in Platonic philosophy and that permeated Hellenistic Judaism. Consequently, in his view, Judaism does not fit easily into conventional Western categories, such as religion, ethnicity, or culture. Boyarin suggests that this in part reflects the fact that much of Judaism's more than 3,000-year history predates the rise of Western culture and occurred outside the West (that is, Europe, particularly medieval and modern Europe). During this time, Jews experienced slavery, anarchic and theocratic self-government, conquest, occupation, and exile. In the Diaspora, they were in contact with, and influenced by, ancient Egyptian, Babylonian, Persian, and Hellenic cultures, as well as modern movements such as the Enlightenment (see Haskalah) and the rise of nationalism, which would bear fruit in the form of a Jewish state in their ancient homeland, the Land of Israel. They also saw an elite population convert to Judaism (the Khazars), only to disappear as the centers of power in the lands once occupied by that elite fell to the people of Rus and then the Mongols. Thus, Boyarin has argued that \"Jewishness disrupts the very categories of identity, because it is not national, not genealogical, not religious, but all of these, in dialectical tension.\"\n\nIn contrast to this point of view, practices such as Humanistic Judaism reject the religious aspects of Judaism, while retaining certain cultural traditions.\n\nAccording to Rabbinic Judaism, a Jew is anyone who was either born of a Jewish mother or who converted to Judaism in accordance with Jewish Law. Reconstructionist Judaism and the larger denominations of worldwide Progressive Judaism (also known as Liberal or Reform Judaism) accept the child as Jewish if one of the parents is Jewish, if the parents raise the child with a Jewish identity, but not the smaller regional branches. All mainstream forms of Judaism today are open to sincere converts, although conversion has traditionally been discouraged since the time of the Talmud. The conversion process is evaluated by an authority, and the convert is examined on his or her sincerity and knowledge. Converts are called \"ben Abraham\" or \"bat Abraham\", (son or daughter of Abraham). Conversions have on occasion been overturned. In 2008, Israel's highest religious court invalidated the conversion of 40,000 Jews, mostly from Russian immigrant families, even though they had been approved by an Orthodox rabbi.\n\nRabbinical Judaism maintains that a Jew, whether by birth or conversion, is a Jew forever. Thus a Jew who claims to be an atheist or converts to another religion is still considered by traditional Judaism to be Jewish. According to some sources, the Reform movement has maintained that a Jew who has converted to another religion is no longer a Jew, and the Israeli Government has also taken that stance after Supreme Court cases and statutes. However, the Reform movement has indicated that this is not so cut and dried, and different situations call for consideration and differing actions. For example, Jews who have converted under duress may be permitted to return to Judaism \"without any action on their part but their desire to rejoin the Jewish community\" and \"A proselyte who has become an apostate remains, nevertheless, a Jew\".\n\nKaraite Judaism believes that Jewish identity can only be transmitted by patrilineal descent. Although a minority of modern Karaites believe that Jewish identity requires that both parents be Jewish, and not only the father. They argue that only patrilineal descent can transmit Jewish identity on the grounds that all descent in the Torah went according to the male line.\n\nThe question of what determines Jewish identity in the State of Israel was given new impetus when, in the 1950s, David Ben-Gurion requested opinions on \"mihu Yehudi\" (\"Who is a Jew\") from Jewish religious authorities and intellectuals worldwide in order to settle citizenship questions. This is still not settled, and occasionally resurfaces in Israeli politics.\n\nHistorical definitions of Jewish identity have traditionally been based on \"halakhic\" definitions of matrilineal descent, and halakhic conversions. Historical definitions of who is a Jew date back to the codification of the Oral Torah into the Babylonian Talmud, around 200 CE. Interpretations of sections of the Tanakh, such as Deuteronomy 7:1–5, by Jewish sages, are used as a warning against intermarriage between Jews and Canaanites because \"[the non-Jewish husband] will cause your child to turn away from Me and they will worship the gods (i.e., idols) of others.\" says that the son in a marriage between a Hebrew woman and an Egyptian man is \"of the community of Israel.\" This is complemented by , where Israelites returning from Babylon vow to put aside their gentile wives and their children. A popular theory is that the rape of Jewish women in captivity brought about the law of Jewish identity being inherited through the maternal line, although scholars challenge this theory citing the Talmudic establishment of the law from the pre-exile period. Since the anti-religious \"Haskalah\" movement of the late 18th and 19th centuries, \"halakhic\" interpretations of Jewish identity have been challenged.\n\nThe total number of Jews worldwide is difficult to assess because the definition of \"who is a Jew\" is problematic; not all Jews identify themselves as Jewish, and some who identify as Jewish are not considered so by other Jews. According to the \"Jewish Year Book\" (1901), the global Jewish population in 1900 was around 11 million. The latest available data is from the World Jewish Population Survey of 2002 and the Jewish Year Calendar (2005). In 2002, according to the Jewish Population Survey, there were 13.3 million Jews around the world. The Jewish Year Calendar cites 14.6 million. Jewish population growth is currently near zero percent, with 0.3% growth from 2000 to 2001.\n\nRabbinic Judaism (or in some Christian traditions, Rabbinism) (Hebrew: \"Yahadut Rabanit\" – יהדות רבנית) has been the mainstream form of Judaism since the 6th century CE, after the codification of the Talmud. It is characterised by the belief that the Written Torah (Written Law) cannot be correctly interpreted without reference to the Oral Torah and the voluminous literature specifying what behavior is sanctioned by the Law.\n\nThe Jewish Enlightenment of the late 18th century resulted in the division of Ashkenazi (Western) Jewry into religious movements or denominations, especially in North America and Anglophone countries. The main denominations today outside Israel (where the situation is rather different) are Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform.\n\nWhile traditions and customs (see also \"Sephardic law and customs\") vary between discrete communities, it can be said that Sephardi and Mizrahi Jewish communities do not generally adhere to the \"movement\" framework popular in and among Ashkenazi Jewry. Historically, Sephardi and Mizrahi communities have eschewed denominations in favour of a \"big tent\" approach. This is particularly the case in contemporary Israel, which is home to the largest communities of Sephardi and Mizrahi Jews in the world. (However, individual Sephardi and Mizrahi Jews may be members of or attend synagogues that do adhere to one Ashkenazi-inflected movement or another.) \n\nSephardi and Mizrahi observance of Judaism tends toward the conservative, and prayer rites are reflective of this, with the text of each rite being largely unchanged since their respective inception. Observant Sephardim may follow the teachings of a particular rabbi or school of thought; for example, the Sephardic Chief Rabbi of Israel.\n\nMost Jewish Israelis classify themselves as \"secular\" (\"hiloni\"), \"traditional\" (\"masorti\"), \"religious\" (\"dati\") or \"Haredi\". The term \"secular\" is more popular as a self-description among Israeli families of western (European) origin, whose Jewish identity may be a very powerful force in their lives, but who see it as largely independent of traditional religious belief and practice. This portion of the population largely ignores organized religious life, be it of the official Israeli rabbinate (Orthodox) or of the liberal movements common to diaspora Judaism (Reform, Conservative).\n\nThe term \"traditional\" (\"masorti\") is most common as a self-description among Israeli families of \"eastern\" origin (i.e., the Middle East, Central Asia, and North Africa). This term, as commonly used, has nothing to do with the Conservative Judaism, which also names itself \"Masorti\" outside North America. There is a great deal of ambiguity in the ways \"secular\" and \"traditional\" are used in Israel: they often overlap, and they cover an extremely wide range in terms of worldview and practical religious observance. The term \"Orthodox\" is not popular in Israeli discourse, although the percentage of Jews who come under that category is far greater than in the diaspora. What would be called \"Orthodox\" in the diaspora includes what is commonly called \"dati\" (religious) or \"haredi\" (ultra-Orthodox) in Israel. The former term includes what is called \"Religious Zionism\" or the \"National Religious\" community, as well as what has become known over the past decade or so as \"haredi-leumi\" (nationalist \"haredi\"), or \"Hardal\", which combines a largely \"haredi\" lifestyle with nationalist ideology. (Some people, in Yiddish, also refer to observant Orthodox Jews as \"frum\", as opposed to \"frei\" (more liberal Jews)).\n\n\"Haredi\" applies to a populace that can be roughly divided into three separate groups along both ethnic and ideological lines: (1) \"Lithuanian\" (non-hasidic) \"haredim\" of Ashkenazic origin; (2) Hasidic \"haredim\" of Ashkenazic origin; and (3) Sephardic \"haredim\".\n\nKaraite Judaism defines itself as the remnants of the non-Rabbinic Jewish sects of the Second Temple period, such as the Sadducees. The Karaites (\"Scripturalists\") accept only the Hebrew Bible and what they view as the Peshat (\"simple\" meaning); they do not accept non-biblical writings as authoritative. Some European Karaites do not see themselves as part of the Jewish community at all, although most do.\n\nThe Samaritans, a very small community located entirely around Mount Gerizim in the Nablus/Shechem region of the West Bank and in Holon, near Tel Aviv in Israel, regard themselves as the descendants of the Israelites of the Iron Age kingdom of Israel. Their religious practices are based on the literal text of the written Torah (Five Books of Moses), which they view as the only authoritative scripture (with a special regard also for the Samaritan Book of Joshua).\n\n\"See also: Haymanot; Beta Israel.\"\n\nHaymanot (meaning \"religion\" in Ge'ez and Amharic) refers the Judaism practiced by Ethiopian Jews. This version of Judaism differs substantially from Rabbinic, Karaite, and Samaritan Judaisms, Ethiopian Jews having diverged from their coreligionists earlier. Sacred scriptures (the Orit) are written in Ge'ez, not Hebrew, and dietary laws are based strictly on the text of the Orit, without explication from ancillary commentaries. Holidays also differ, with some Rabbinic holidays not observed in Ethiopian Jewish communities, and some additional holidays, like Sigd.\n\nJewish ethics may be guided by halakhic traditions, by other moral principles, or by central Jewish virtues. Jewish ethical practice is typically understood to be marked by values such as justice, truth, peace, loving-kindness (chesed), compassion, humility, and self-respect. Specific Jewish ethical practices include practices of charity (tzedakah) and refraining from negative speech (lashon hara). Proper ethical practices regarding sexuality and many other issues are subjects of dispute among Jews.\n\nTraditionally, Jews recite prayers three times daily, Shacharit, Mincha, and Ma'ariv with a fourth prayer, Mussaf added on Shabbat and holidays. At the heart of each service is the \"Amidah\" or \"Shemoneh Esrei\". Another key prayer in many services is the declaration of faith, the \"Shema Yisrael\" (or \"Shema\"). The \"Shema\" is the recitation of a verse from the Torah (Deuteronomy 6:4): \"Shema Yisrael Adonai Eloheinu Adonai Echad\"—\"Hear, O Israel! The Lord is our God! The Lord is One!\"\n\nMost of the prayers in a traditional Jewish service can be recited in solitary prayer, although communal prayer is preferred. Communal prayer requires a quorum of ten adult Jews, called a \"minyan\". In nearly all Orthodox and a few Conservative circles, only male Jews are counted toward a \"minyan\"; most Conservative Jews and members of other Jewish denominations count female Jews as well.\n\nIn addition to prayer services, observant traditional Jews recite prayers and benedictions throughout the day when performing various acts. Prayers are recited upon waking up in the morning, before eating or drinking different foods, after eating a meal, and so on.\n\nThe approach to prayer varies among the Jewish denominations. Differences can include the texts of prayers, the frequency of prayer, the number of prayers recited at various religious events, the use of musical instruments and choral music, and whether prayers are recited in the traditional liturgical languages or the vernacular. In general, Orthodox and Conservative congregations adhere most closely to tradition, and Reform and Reconstructionist synagogues are more likely to incorporate translations and contemporary writings in their services. Also, in most Conservative synagogues, and all Reform and Reconstructionist congregations, women participate in prayer services on an equal basis with men, including roles traditionally filled only by men, such as reading from the Torah. In addition, many Reform temples use musical accompaniment such as organs and mixed choirs.\n\nA \"kippah\" (Hebrew: כִּפָּה, plural \"kippot\"; Yiddish: יאַרמלקע, \"yarmulke\") is a slightly rounded brimless skullcap worn by many Jews while praying, eating, reciting blessings, or studying Jewish religious texts, and at all times by some Jewish men. In Orthodox communities, only men wear kippot; in non-Orthodox communities, some women also wear kippot. \"Kippot\" range in size from a small round beanie that covers only the back of the head to a large, snug cap that covers the whole crown.\n\n\"Tzitzit\" (Hebrew: צִיציִת) (Ashkenazi pronunciation: \"tzitzis\") are special knotted \"fringes\" or \"tassels\" found on the four corners of the \"tallit\" (Hebrew: טַלִּית) (Ashkenazi pronunciation: \"tallis\"), or prayer shawl. The \"tallit\" is worn by Jewish men and some Jewish women during the prayer service. Customs vary regarding when a Jew begins wearing a tallit. In the Sephardi community, boys wear a tallit from bar mitzvah age. In some Ashkenazi communities, it is customary to wear one only after marriage. A \"tallit katan\" (small tallit) is a fringed garment worn under the clothing throughout the day. In some Orthodox circles, the fringes are allowed to hang freely outside the clothing.\n\nTefillin (Hebrew: תְפִלִּין), known in English as phylacteries (from the Greek word φυλακτήριον, meaning \"safeguard\" or \"amulet\"), are two square leather boxes containing biblical verses, attached to the forehead and wound around the left arm by leather straps. They are worn during weekday morning prayer by observant Jewish men and some Jewish women.\n\nA \"kittel\" (Yiddish: קיטל), a white knee-length overgarment, is worn by prayer leaders and some observant traditional Jews on the High Holidays. It is traditional for the head of the household to wear a kittel at the Passover seder in some communities, and some grooms wear one under the wedding canopy. Jewish males are buried in a \"tallit\" and sometimes also a \"kittel\" which are part of the \"tachrichim\" (burial garments).\n\nJewish holidays are special days in the Jewish calendar, which celebrate moments in Jewish history, as well as central themes in the relationship between God and the world, such as creation, revelation, and redemption.\n\n\"Shabbat\", the weekly day of rest lasting from shortly before sundown on Friday night to nightfall on Saturday night, commemorates God's day of rest after six days of creation. It plays a pivotal role in Jewish practice and is governed by a large corpus of religious law. At sundown on Friday, the woman of the house welcomes the Shabbat by lighting two or more candles and reciting a blessing. The evening meal begins with the Kiddush, a blessing recited aloud over a cup of wine, and the Mohtzi, a blessing recited over the bread. It is customary to have challah, two braided loaves of bread, on the table. During Shabbat, Jews are forbidden to engage in any activity that falls under 39 categories of \"melakhah\", translated literally as \"work\". In fact the activities banned on the Sabbath are not \"work\" in the usual sense: They include such actions as lighting a fire, writing, using money and carrying in the public domain. The prohibition of lighting a fire has been extended in the modern era to driving a car, which involves burning fuel and using electricity.\n\nJewish holy days (\"chaggim\"), celebrate landmark events in Jewish history, such as the Exodus from Egypt and the giving of the Torah, and sometimes mark the change of seasons and transitions in the agricultural cycle. The three major festivals, Sukkot, Passover and Shavuot, are called \"regalim\" (derived from the Hebrew word \"regel\", or foot). On the three regalim, it was customary for the Israelites to make pilgrimages to Jerusalem to offer sacrifices in the Temple.\n\nThe High Holidays (\"Yamim Noraim\" or \"Days of Awe\") revolve around judgment and forgiveness.\n\nPurim (Hebrew: \"Pûrîm\" \"lots\") is a joyous Jewish holiday that commemorates the deliverance of the Persian Jews from the plot of the evil Haman, who sought to exterminate them, as recorded in the biblical Book of Esther. It is characterized by public recitation of the Book of Esther, mutual gifts of food and drink, charity to the poor, and a celebratory meal (Esther 9:22). Other customs include drinking wine, eating special pastries called hamantashen, dressing up in masks and costumes, and organizing carnivals and parties.\n\nPurim has celebrated annually on the 14th of the Hebrew month of Adar, which occurs in February or March of the Gregorian calendar.\n\nHanukkah (, \"dedication\") also known as the Festival of Lights, is an eight-day Jewish holiday that starts on the 25th day of Kislev (Hebrew calendar). The festival is observed in Jewish homes by the kindling of lights on each of the festival's eight nights, one on the first night, two on the second night and so on.\n\nThe holiday was called Hanukkah (meaning \"dedication\") because it marks the re-dedication of the Temple after its desecration by Antiochus IV Epiphanes. Spiritually, Hanukkah commemorates the \"Miracle of the Oil\". According to the Talmud, at the re-dedication of the Temple in Jerusalem following the victory of the Maccabees over the Seleucid Empire, there was only enough consecrated oil to fuel the eternal flame in the Temple for one day. Miraculously, the oil burned for eight days – which was the length of time it took to press, prepare and consecrate new oil.\n\nHanukkah is not mentioned in the Bible and was never considered a major holiday in Judaism, but it has become much more visible and widely celebrated in modern times, mainly because it falls around the same time as Christmas and has national Jewish overtones that have been emphasized since the establishment of the State of Israel.\n\nTisha B'Av ( or , \"the Ninth of Av\") is a day of mourning and fasting commemorating the destruction of the First and Second Temples, and in later times, the expulsion of the Jews from Spain.\n\nThere are three more minor Jewish fast days that commemorate various stages of the destruction of the Temples. They are the 17th Tamuz, the 10th of Tevet and Tzom Gedaliah (the 3rd of Tishrei).\n\nThe modern holidays of Yom Ha-shoah (Holocaust Remembrance Day), Yom Hazikaron (Israeli Memorial Day) and Yom Ha'atzmaut (Israeli Independence Day) commemorate the horrors of the Holocaust, the fallen soldiers of Israel and victims of terrorism, and Israeli independence, respectively.\n\nThere are some who prefer to commemorate those who were killed in the Holocaust on the 10th of Tevet.\n\nThe core of festival and Shabbat prayer services is the public reading of the Torah, along with connected readings from the other books of the Tanakh, called Haftarah. Over the course of a year, the whole Torah is read, with the cycle starting over in the autumn, on Simchat Torah.\n\nSynagogues are Jewish houses of prayer and study. They usually contain separate rooms for prayer (the main sanctuary), smaller rooms for study, and often an area for community or educational use. There is no set blueprint for synagogues and the architectural shapes and interior designs of synagogues vary greatly. The Reform movement mostly refer to their synagogues as temples. Some traditional features of a synagogue are:\n\nIn addition to synagogues, other buildings of significance in Judaism include yeshivas, or institutions of Jewish learning, and mikvahs, which are ritual baths.\n\nThe Jewish dietary laws are known as \"kashrut\". Food prepared in accordance with them is termed kosher, and food that is not kosher is also known as \"treifah\" or \"treif\". People who observe these laws are colloquially said to be \"keeping kosher\".\n\nMany of the laws apply to animal-based foods. For example, in order to be considered kosher, mammals must have split hooves and chew their cud. The pig is arguably the most well-known example of a non-kosher animal. Although it has split hooves, it does not chew its cud. For seafood to be kosher, the animal must have fins and scales. Certain types of seafood, such as shellfish, crustaceans, and eels, are therefore considered non-kosher. Concerning birds, a list of non-kosher species is given in the Torah. The exact translations of many of the species have not survived, and some non-kosher birds' identities are no longer certain. However, traditions exist about the \"kashrut\" status of a few birds. For example, both chickens and turkeys are permitted in most communities. Other types of animals, such as amphibians, reptiles, and most insects, are prohibited altogether.\n\nIn addition to the requirement that the species be considered kosher, meat and poultry (but not fish) must come from a healthy animal slaughtered in a process known as \"shechitah\". Without the proper slaughtering practices even an otherwise kosher animal will be rendered \"treif\". The slaughtering process is intended to be quick and relatively painless to the animal. Forbidden parts of animals include the blood, some fats, and the area in and around the sciatic nerve.\n\nJewish law also forbids the consumption of meat and dairy products together. The waiting period between eating meat and eating dairy varies by the order in which they are consumed and by community, and can extend for up to six hours. Based on the Biblical injunction against cooking a kid in its mother's milk, this rule is mostly derived from the Oral Torah, the Talmud and Rabbinic law. Chicken and other kosher birds are considered the same as meat under the laws of \"kashrut\", but the prohibition is Rabbinic, not Biblical.\n\nThe use of dishes, serving utensils, and ovens may make food \"treif\" that would otherwise be kosher. Utensils that have been used to prepare non-kosher food, or dishes that have held meat and are now used for dairy products, render the food \"treif\" under certain conditions.\n\nFurthermore, all Orthodox and some Conservative authorities forbid the consumption of processed grape products made by non-Jews, due to ancient pagan practices of using wine in rituals. Some Conservative authorities permit wine and grape juice made without rabbinic supervision.\n\nThe Torah does not give specific reasons for most of the laws of \"kashrut\". However, a number of explanations have been offered, including maintaining ritual purity, teaching impulse control, encouraging obedience to God, improving health, reducing cruelty to animals and preserving the distinctness of the Jewish community. The various categories of dietary laws may have developed for different reasons, and some may exist for multiple reasons. For example, people are forbidden from consuming the blood of birds and mammals because, according to the Torah, this is where animal souls are contained. In contrast, the Torah forbids Israelites from eating non-kosher species because \"they are unclean\". The Kabbalah describes sparks of holiness that are released by the act of eating kosher foods, but are too tightly bound in non-kosher foods to be released by eating.\n\nSurvival concerns supersede all the laws of \"kashrut\", as they do for most halakhot.\n\nThe Tanakh describes circumstances in which a person who is \"tahor\" or ritually pure may become \"tamei\" or ritually impure. Some of these circumstances are contact with human corpses or graves, seminal flux, vaginal flux, menstruation, and contact with people who have become impure from any of these. In Rabbinic Judaism, Kohanim, members of the hereditary caste that served as priests in the time of the Temple, are mostly restricted from entering grave sites and touching dead bodies. During the Temple period, such priests (Kohanim) were required to eat their bread offering (Terumah) in a state of ritual purity, which laws eventually led to more rigid laws being enacted, such as hand-washing which became a requisite of all Jews before consuming ordinary bread.\n\nAn important subcategory of the ritual purity laws relates to the segregation of menstruating women. These laws are also known as \"niddah\", literally \"separation\", or family purity. Vital aspects of halakha for traditionally observant Jews, they are not usually followed by Jews in liberal denominations.\n\nEspecially in Orthodox Judaism, the Biblical laws are augmented by Rabbinical injunctions. For example, the Torah mandates that a woman in her normal menstrual period must abstain from sexual intercourse for seven days. A woman whose menstruation is prolonged must continue to abstain for seven more days after bleeding has stopped. The Rabbis conflated ordinary \"niddah\" with this extended menstrual period, known in the Torah as \"zavah\", and mandated that a woman may not have sexual intercourse with her husband from the time she begins her menstrual flow until seven days after it ends. In addition, Rabbinical law forbids the husband from touching or sharing a bed with his wife during this period. Afterwards, purification can occur in a ritual bath called a mikveh.\n\nTraditional Ethiopian Jews keep menstruating women in separate huts and, similar to Karaite practice, do not allow menstruating women into their temples because of a temple's special sanctity. Emigration to Israel and the influence of other Jewish denominations have led to Ethiopian Jews adopting more normative Jewish practices.\n\nLife-cycle events, or rites of passage, occur throughout a Jew's life that serves to strengthen Jewish identity and bind him/her to the entire community.\n\nThe role of the priesthood in Judaism has significantly diminished since the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE when priests attended to the Temple and sacrifices. The priesthood is an inherited position, and although priests no longer have any but ceremonial duties, they are still honored in many Jewish communities. Many Orthodox Jewish communities believe that they will be needed again for a future Third Temple and need to remain in readiness for future duty.\n\nFrom the time of the Mishnah and Talmud to the present, Judaism has required specialists or authorities for the practice of very few rituals or ceremonies. A Jew can fulfill most requirements for prayer by himself. Some activities—reading the Torah and \"haftarah\" (a supplementary portion from the Prophets or Writings), the prayer for mourners, the blessings for bridegroom and bride, the complete grace after meals—require a \"minyan\", the presence of ten Jews.\n\nThe most common professional clergy in a synagogue are:\n\nJewish prayer services do involve two specified roles, which are sometimes, but not always, filled by a rabbi or hazzan in many congregations. In other congregations these roles are filled on an ad-hoc basis by members of the congregation who lead portions of services on a rotating basis:\n\nMany congregations, especially larger ones, also rely on a:\n\nThe three preceding positions are usually voluntary and considered an honor. Since the Enlightenment large synagogues have often adopted the practice of hiring rabbis and hazzans to act as \"shatz\" and \"baal kriyah\", and this is still typically the case in many Conservative and Reform congregations. However, in most Orthodox synagogues these positions are filled by laypeople on a rotating or ad-hoc basis. Although most congregations hire one or more Rabbis, the use of a professional hazzan is generally declining in American congregations, and the use of professionals for other offices is rarer still.\n\n\nAt its core, the Tanakh is an account of the Israelites' relationship with God from their earliest history until the building of the Second Temple (c. 535 BCE). Abraham is hailed as the first Hebrew and the father of the Jewish people. As a reward for his act of faith in one God, he was promised that Isaac, his second son, would inherit the Land of Israel (then called Canaan). Later, the descendants of Isaac's son Jacob were enslaved in Egypt, and God commanded Moses to lead the Exodus from Egypt. At Mount Sinai, they received the Torah—the five books of Moses. These books, together with Nevi'im and Ketuvim are known as \"Torah Shebikhtav\" as opposed to the Oral Torah, which refers to the Mishnah and the Talmud. Eventually, God led them to the land of Israel where the tabernacle was planted in the city of Shiloh for over 300 years to rally the nation against attacking enemies. As time went on, the spiritual level of the nation declined to the point that God allowed the Philistines to capture the tabernacle. The people of Israel then told Samuel the prophet that they needed to be governed by a permanent king, and Samuel appointed Saul to be their King. When the people pressured Saul into going against a command conveyed to him by Samuel, God told Samuel to appoint David in his stead.\n\nOnce King David was established, he told the prophet Nathan that he would like to build a permanent temple, and as a reward for his actions, God promised David that he would allow his son, Solomon, to build the First Temple and the throne would never depart from his children.\n\nRabbinic tradition holds that the details and interpretation of the law, which are called the \"Oral Torah\" or \"oral law\", were originally an unwritten tradition based upon what God told Moses on Mount Sinai. However, as the persecutions of the Jews increased and the details were in danger of being forgotten, these oral laws were recorded by Rabbi Judah HaNasi (Judah the Prince) in the Mishnah, redacted \"circa\" 200 CE. The Talmud was a compilation of both the Mishnah and the Gemara, rabbinic commentaries redacted over the next three centuries. The Gemara originated in two major centers of Jewish scholarship, Palestine and Babylonia. Correspondingly, two bodies of analysis developed, and two works of Talmud were created. The older compilation is called the Jerusalem Talmud. It was compiled sometime during the 4th century in Palestine. The Babylonian Talmud was compiled from discussions in the houses of study by the scholars Ravina I, Ravina II, and Rav Ashi by 500 CE, although it continued to be edited later.\n\nSome critical scholars oppose the view that the sacred texts, including the Hebrew Bible, were divinely inspired. Many of these scholars accept the general principles of the documentary hypothesis and suggest that the Torah consists of inconsistent texts edited together in a way that calls attention to divergent accounts. Many suggest that during the First Temple period, the people of Israel believed that each nation had its own god, but that their god was superior to other gods. Some suggest that strict monotheism developed during the Babylonian Exile, perhaps in reaction to Zoroastrian dualism. In this view, it was only by the Hellenic period that most Jews came to believe that their god was the only god and that the notion of a clearly bounded Jewish nation identical with the Jewish religion formed.\n\nJohn Day argues that the origins of biblical Yahweh, El, Asherah, and Ba'al, may be rooted in earlier Canaanite religion, which was centered on a pantheon of gods much like the Greek pantheon.\n\nAccording to the Hebrew Bible, the United Monarchy was established under Saul and continued under King David and Solomon with its capital in Jerusalem. After Solomon's reign, the nation split into two kingdoms, the Kingdom of Israel (in the north) and the Kingdom of Judah (in the south). The Kingdom of Israel was conquered by the Assyrian ruler Sargon II in the late 8th century BCE with many people from the capital Samaria being taken captive to Media and the Khabur River valley. The Kingdom of Judah continued as an independent state until it was conquered by a Babylonian army in the early 6th century BCE, destroying the First Temple that was at the center of ancient Jewish worship. The Judean elite was exiled to Babylonia and this is regarded as the first Jewish Diaspora. Later many of them returned to their homeland after the subsequent conquest of Babylonia by the Persians seventy years later, a period known as the Babylonian Captivity. A new Second Temple was constructed, and old religious practices were resumed.\n\nDuring the early years of the Second Temple, the highest religious authority was a council known as the Great Assembly, led by Ezra of the Book of Ezra. Among other accomplishments of the Great Assembly, the last books of the Bible were written at this time and the canon sealed.\n\nHellenistic Judaism spread to Ptolemaic Egypt from the 3rd century BCE. After the Great Revolt (66–73 CE), the Romans destroyed the Temple. Hadrian built a pagan idol on the Temple grounds and prohibited circumcision; these acts of ethnocide provoked the Bar Kokhba revolt 132–136 CE after which the Romans banned the study of the Torah and the celebration of Jewish holidays, and forcibly removed virtually all Jews from Judea. In 200 CE, however, Jews were granted Roman citizenship and Judaism was recognized as a \"religio licita\" (\"legitimate religion\") until the rise of Gnosticism and Early Christianity in the fourth century.\n\nFollowing the destruction of Jerusalem and the expulsion of the Jews, Jewish worship stopped being centrally organized around the Temple, prayer took the place of sacrifice, and worship was rebuilt around the community (represented by a minimum of ten adult men) and the establishment of the authority of rabbis who acted as teachers and leaders of individual communities (see Jewish diaspora).\n\nAround the 1st century CE, there were several small Jewish sects: the Pharisees, Sadducees, Zealots, Essenes, and Christians. After the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, these sects vanished. Christianity survived, but by breaking with Judaism and becoming a separate religion; the Pharisees survived but in the form of Rabbinic Judaism (today, known simply as \"Judaism\"). The Sadducees rejected the divine inspiration of the Prophets and the Writings, relying only on the Torah as divinely inspired. Consequently, a number of other core tenets of the Pharisees' belief system (which became the basis for modern Judaism), were also dismissed by the Sadducees. (The Samaritans practiced a similar religion, which is traditionally considered separate from Judaism.)\n\nLike the Sadducees who relied only on the Torah, some Jews in the 8th and 9th centuries rejected the authority and divine inspiration of the oral law as recorded in the Mishnah (and developed by later rabbis in the two Talmuds), relying instead only upon the Tanakh. These included the Isunians, the Yudganites, the Malikites, and others. They soon developed oral traditions of their own, which differed from the rabbinic traditions, and eventually formed the Karaite sect. Karaites exist in small numbers today, mostly living in Israel. Rabbinical and Karaite Jews each hold that the others are Jews, but that the other faith is erroneous.\n\nOver a long time, Jews formed distinct ethnic groups in several different geographic areas—amongst others, the Ashkenazi Jews (of central and Eastern Europe), the Sephardi Jews (of Spain, Portugal, and North Africa), the Beta Israel of Ethiopia, and the Yemenite Jews from the southern tip of the Arabian Peninsula. Many of these groups have developed differences in their prayers, traditions and accepted canons; however, these distinctions are mainly the result of their being formed at some cultural distance from normative (rabbinic) Judaism, rather than based on any doctrinal dispute.\n\nAntisemitism arose during the Middle Ages, in the form of persecutions, pogroms, forced conversions, expulsions, social restrictions and ghettoization.\n\nThis was different in quality from the repressions of Jews which had occurred in ancient times. Ancient repressions were politically motivated and Jews were treated the same as members of other ethnic groups. With the rise of the Churches, the main motive for attacks on Jews changed from politics to religion and the religious motive for such attacks was specifically derived from Christian views about Jews and Judaism. During the Middle Ages, Jewish people who lived under Muslim rule generally experienced tolerance and integration, but there were occasional outbreaks of violence like Almohad's persecutions.\n\nHasidic Judaism was founded by Yisroel ben Eliezer (1700–1760), also known as the \"Ba'al Shem Tov\" (or \"Besht\"). It originated in a time of persecution of the Jewish people when European Jews had turned inward to Talmud study; many felt that most expressions of Jewish life had become too \"academic\", and that they no longer had any emphasis on spirituality or joy. Its adherents favored small and informal gatherings called Shtiebel, which, in contrast to a traditional synagogue, could be used both as a place of worship and for celebrations involving dancing, eating, and socializing. Ba'al Shem Tov's disciples attracted many followers; they themselves established numerous Hasidic sects across Europe. Unlike other religions, which typically expanded through word of mouth or by use of print, Hasidism spread largely owing to Tzadiks, who used their influence to encourage others to follow the movement. Hasidism appealed to many Europeans because it was easy to learn, did not require full immediate commitment, and presented a compelling spectacle. Hasidic Judaism eventually became the way of life for many Jews in Eastern Europe. Waves of Jewish immigration in the 1880s carried it to the United States. The movement itself claims to be nothing new, but a \"refreshment\" of original Judaism. As some have put it: \"they merely re-emphasized that which the generations had lost\". Nevertheless, early on there was a serious schism between Hasidic and non-Hasidic Jews. European Jews who rejected the Hasidic movement were dubbed by the Hasidim as Misnagdim, (lit. \"opponents\"). Some of the reasons for the rejection of Hasidic Judaism were the exuberance of Hasidic worship, its deviation from tradition in ascribing infallibility and miracles to their leaders, and the concern that it might become a messianic sect. Over time differences between the Hasidim and their opponents have slowly diminished and both groups are now considered part of Haredi Judaism.\n\nIn the late 18th century CE, Europe was swept by a group of intellectual, social and political movements known as the Enlightenment. The Enlightenment led to reductions in the European laws that prohibited Jews to interact with the wider secular world, thus allowing Jews access to secular education and experience. A parallel Jewish movement, Haskalah or the \"Jewish Enlightenment\", began, especially in Central Europe and Western Europe, in response to both the Enlightenment and these new freedoms. It placed an emphasis on integration with secular society and a pursuit of non-religious knowledge through reason. With the promise of political emancipation, many Jews saw no reason to continue to observe Jewish law and increasing numbers of Jews assimilated into Christian Europe. Modern religious movements of Judaism all formed in reaction to this trend.\n\nIn Central Europe, followed by Great Britain and the United States, Reform (or Liberal) Judaism developed, relaxing legal obligations (especially those that limited Jewish relations with non-Jews), emulating Protestant decorum in prayer, and emphasizing the ethical values of Judaism's Prophetic tradition. Modern Orthodox Judaism developed in reaction to Reform Judaism, by leaders who argued that Jews could participate in public life as citizens equal to Christians while maintaining the observance of Jewish law. Meanwhile, in the United States, wealthy Reform Jews helped European scholars, who were Orthodox in practice but critical (and skeptical) in their study of the Bible and Talmud, to establish a seminary to train rabbis for immigrants from Eastern Europe. These left-wing Orthodox rabbis were joined by right-wing Reform rabbis who felt that Jewish law should not be entirely abandoned, to form the Conservative movement. Orthodox Jews who opposed the Haskalah formed Haredi Orthodox Judaism. After massive movements of Jews following The Holocaust and the creation of the state of Israel, these movements have competed for followers from among traditional Jews in or from other countries.\n\nCountries such as the United States, Israel, Canada, United Kingdom, Argentina and South Africa contain large Jewish populations. Jewish religious practice varies widely through all levels of observance. According to the 2001 edition of the National Jewish Population Survey, in the United States' Jewish community—the world's second largest—4.3 million Jews out of 5.1 million had some sort of connection to the religion. Of that population of connected Jews, 80% participated in some sort of Jewish religious observance, but only 48% belonged to a congregation, and fewer than 16% attend regularly.\n\nBirth rates for American Jews have dropped from 2.0 to 1.7. (Replacement rate is 2.1.) Intermarriage rates range from 40–50% in the US, and only about a third of children of intermarried couples are raised as Jews. Due to intermarriage and low birth rates, the Jewish population in the US shrank from 5.5 million in 1990 to 5.1 million in 2001. This is indicative of the general population trends among the Jewish community in the Diaspora, but a focus on total population obscures growth trends in some denominations and communities, such as Haredi Judaism. The Baal teshuva movement is a movement of Jews who have \"returned\" to religion or become more observant.\n\nChristianity was originally a sect of Second Temple Judaism, but the two religions diverged in the first century. The differences between Christianity and Judaism originally centered on whether Jesus was the Jewish Messiah but eventually became irreconcilable. Major differences between the two faiths include the nature of the Messiah, of atonement and sin, the status of God's commandments to Israel, and perhaps most significantly of the nature of God himself. Due to these differences, Judaism traditionally regards Christianity as Shituf or worship of the God of Israel which is not monotheistic. Christianity has traditionally regarded Judaism as obsolete with the invention of Christianity and Jews as a people replaced by the Church, though a Christian belief in dual-covenant theology emerged as a phenomenon following Christian reflection on how their theology influenced the Nazi Holocaust.\n\nSince the time of the Middle Ages, the Catholic Church upheld the \"Constitution pro Judæis\" (Formal Statement on the Jews), which stated \n\nUntil their emancipation in the late 18th and the 19th century, Jews in Christian lands were subject to humiliating legal restrictions and limitations. They included provisions requiring Jews to wear specific and identifying clothing such as the Jewish hat and the yellow badge, restricting Jews to certain cities and towns or in certain parts of towns (ghettos), and forbidding Jews to enter certain trades (for example selling new clothes in medieval Sweden). Disabilities also included special taxes levied on Jews, exclusion from public life, restraints on the performance of religious ceremonies, and linguistic censorship. Some countries went even further and completely expelled Jews, for example, England in 1290 (Jews were readmitted in 1655) and Spain in 1492 (readmitted in 1868). The first Jewish settlers in North America arrived in the Dutch colony of New Amsterdam in 1654; they were forbidden to hold public office, open a retail shop, or establish a synagogue. When the colony was seized by the British in 1664 Jewish rights remained unchanged, but by 1671 Asser Levy was the first Jew to serve on a jury in North America.\nIn 1791, Revolutionary France was the first country to abolish disabilities altogether, followed by Prussia in 1848. Emancipation of the Jews in the United Kingdom was achieved in 1858 after an almost 30-year struggle championed by Isaac Lyon Goldsmid with the ability of Jews to sit in parliament with the passing of the Jews Relief Act 1858. The newly united German Empire in 1871 abolished Jewish disabilities in Germany, which were reinstated in the Nuremberg Laws in 1935.\n\nJewish life in Christian lands was marked by frequent blood libels, expulsions, forced conversions and massacres. An underlying source of prejudice against Jews in Europe was religious. Christian rhetoric and antipathy towards Jews developed in the early years of Christianity and was reinforced by ever increasing anti-Jewish measures over the ensuing centuries. The action taken by Christians against Jews included acts of violence, and murder culminating in the Holocaust. These attitudes were reinforced in Christian preaching, art and popular teaching for two millennia, containing contempt for Jews, as well as statutes which were designed to humiliate and stigmatise Jews. The Nazi Party was known for its persecution of Christian Churches; many of them, such as the Protestant Confessing Church and the Catholic Church, as well as Quakers and Jehovah's Witnesses, aided and rescued Jews who were being targeted by the antireligious régime.\n\nThe attitude of Christians and Christian Churches toward the Jewish people and Judaism, have been changed mostly positive since World War II. Pope John Paul II and the Catholic Church have \"upheld the Church's acceptance of the continuing and permanent election of the Jewish people\" as well as a reaffirmation of the covenant between God and the Jews. In December 2015, the Vatican released a 10,000-word document that, among other things, stated that Catholics should work with Jews to fight antisemitism.\n\nBoth Judaism and Islam arose from the patriarch Abraham, and they are therefore considered Abrahamic religions. In both Jewish and Muslim tradition, the Jewish and Arab peoples are descended from the two sons of Abraham—Isaac and Ishmael, respectively. While both religions are monotheistic and share many commonalities, they differ based on the fact that Jews do not consider Jesus or Muhammad to be prophets. The religions' adherents have interacted with each other since the 7th century when Islam originated and spread in the Arabian peninsula. Indeed, the years 712 to 1066 CE under the Ummayad and the Abbasid rulers have been called the Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain. Non-Muslim monotheists living in these countries, including Jews, were known as dhimmis. Dhimmis were allowed to practice their own religions and administer their own internal affairs, but they were subject to certain restrictions that were not imposed on Muslims. For example, they had to pay the jizya, a per capita tax imposed on free adult non-Muslim males, and they were also forbidden to bear arms or testify in court cases involving Muslims. Many of the laws regarding dhimmis were highly symbolic. For example, dhimmis in some countries were required to wear distinctive clothing, a practice not found in either the Qur'an or the hadiths but invented in early medieval Baghdad and inconsistently enforced. Jews in Muslim countries were not entirely free from persecution—for example, many were killed, exiled or forcibly converted in the 12th century, in Persia, and by the rulers of the Almohad dynasty in North Africa and Al-Andalus, as well as by the Zaydi imams of Yemen in the 17th century (see: Mawza Exile). At times, Jews were also restricted in their choice of residence—in Morocco, for example, Jews were confined to walled quarters (mellahs) beginning in the 15th century and increasingly since the early 19th century.\n\nIn the mid-20th century, Jews were expelled from nearly all of the Arab countries. Most have chosen to live in Israel. Today, antisemitic themes including Holocaust denial have become commonplace in the propaganda of Islamic movements such as Hizbullah and Hamas, in the pronouncements of various agencies of the Islamic Republic of Iran, and even in the newspapers and other publications of Refah Partisi.\n\nThere are some movements that combine elements of Judaism with those of other religions. The most well-known of these is Messianic Judaism, a religious movement, which arose in the 1960s, that incorporates elements of Judaism with the tenets of Christianity. The movement generally states that Jesus is the Jewish Messiah, that he is one of the Three Divine Persons, and that salvation is only achieved through acceptance of Jesus as one's savior. Some members of the movement argue that Messianic Judaism is a sect of Judaism. Jewish organizations of every denomination reject this, stating that Messianic Judaism is a Christian sect, because it teaches creeds which are identical to those of Pauline Christianity.\n\nOther examples of syncretism include Semitic neopaganism, a loosely organized sect which incorporates pagan or Wiccan beliefs with some Jewish religious practices; Jewish Buddhists, another loosely organized group that incorporates elements of Asian spirituality in their faith; and some Renewal Jews who borrow freely and openly from Buddhism, Sufism, Native American religions, and other faiths.\n\nThe Kabbalah Centre, which employs teachers from multiple religions, is a New Age movement that claims to popularize the kabbalah, part of the Jewish esoteric tradition.\n\n\n\nJews in Islamic countries:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee also Torah database for links to more Judaism e-texts.\n\n\nText study projects at .

Arguments may be logical if they are \"conducted or assessed according to strict principles of validity\", while they are rational according to the broader requirement that they are based on reason and knowledge.\n\nLogic and rationality have each been taken as fundamental concepts in philosophy. Philosophical rationalism in its most extreme form is the doctrine that knowledge can ultimately be founded on pure reason, while logicism is the doctrine that mathematical concepts, among others are reducible to pure logic.\n\nDeductive reasoning concerns the logical consequence of given premises. On a narrow conception of logic, logic concerns just deductive reasoning, although such a narrow conception controversially excludes most of what is called informal logic from the discipline. Other forms of reasoning are sometimes also taken to be part of logic, such as inductive reasoning and abductive reasoning, which are forms of reasoning that are not purely deductive, but include material inference. Similarly, it is important to distinguish deductive validity and inductive validity (called \"strength\"). An inference is deductively valid if and only if there is no possible situation in which all the premises are true but the conclusion false. An inference is inductively strong if and only if its premises give some degree of probability to its conclusion.\n\nThe notion of deductive validity can be rigorously stated for systems of formal logic in terms of the well-understood notions of semantics. Inductive validity, on the other hand, requires us to define a reliable generalization of some set of observations. The task of providing this definition may be approached in various ways, some less formal than others; some of these definitions may use logical association rule induction, while others may use mathematical models of probability such as decision trees. For the most part this discussion of logic deals only with deductive logic.\n\nAbductive reasoning is a form of inference which goes from an observation to a theory which accounts for the observation, ideally seeking to find the simplest and most likely explanation. In abductive reasoning, unlike in deductive reasoning, the premises do not guarantee the conclusion. One can understand abductive reasoning as \"inference to the best explanation\".\n\nCritical thinking, also called critical analysis, is clear, rational thinking involving critique.\n\nDialectic is a discourse between two or more people holding different points of view about a subject but wishing to establish the truth through reasoned arguments. It has been the object of study since ancient times, but only recently has it been the subject of attempts at formalisation.\n\nIllogicality in terms of thinking processes are, as defined by researchers such as Aaron T. Beck, cognitive distortions that cause abnormal functioning. The state of depression often feeds off of illogical thinking and results in victims being mired in self-defeating conclusions. Patients seeking psychological help may suffer from problems of over-generalization, becoming mired in general, negative conclusions on the basis of essentially insignificant life events. Cognitive behavioral therapy can assist individuals in recognizing their own habits of faulty logic and slanted interpretations of past experiences.\n\nOn the other hand depression in the sense of \"Weltschmerz\" in its non-aesthetically realistic and non-positivistic nature is intrinsically logical and rational. Some philosophers assert that the question of value of life has not been answered in psychologically pleasing way without embracing circular reasoning fallacy.\n\nIn the socio-political context, the ability to amalgamate disparate, conflicting interests and passions into an illogical synthesis has been labeled as a possible strength, albeit one with concurrent weaknesses, by literary publications such as \"Blackwood's Magazine\":\n\n"}

Roger Smith was awarded the OBE in 2000, in the Queen's New Year Honours for services to the Project.\n\nIn collaboration with other biodiversity projects around the world expeditions are sent to collect seeds from dryland plants. Where possible, collections are kept in the country of origin with duplicates being sent to the Millennium Seed Bank Project for storage. Major partnerships exist on all the continents, enabling the countries involved to meet international objectives such as the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation and the Millennium Development Goals of the United Nations Environment Programme.\n\nThe seed bank at Kew has gone through many iterations. The Kew Seed Bank facility, set up by Peter Thompson in 1980, preceded the MSBP and was headed by Roger Smith from 1980 to 2005. From 2005, Paul Smith took over as head of the MSBP. The Wellcome Trust Millennium Seed Bank building was designed by the firm Stanton WIlliams and opened by Prince Charles in 2000. The laboratories and offices are in two wings flanking a wide space open to visitors housing an exhibition, and also allowing them to watch the work of cleaning and preparing seeds for storage through the large windows of the work areas. There is also a view down to the entrance to the underground vaults where the seeds are stored at . In 2001, the international programme of the MSBP was launched.\n\nIn April 2007, it banked its billionth seed, the \"Oxytenanthera abyssinica\", a type of African bamboo.\nIn October 2009, it reached its 10% goal of banking all the world's wild plant species by adding \"Musa itinerans\", a wild banana, to its seed vault. As estimates for the number of seed bearing plant species have increased, 34,088 wild plant species and 1,980,405,036 seeds in storage as of June 2015 represent over 13% of the world's wild plant species.\n\nThe main aims of the project are to:\n\nPartnerships exist in Australia, Mexico, Chile, Kenya, China, United States, Jordan, Mali, Malawi, Madagascar, Burkina Faso, Botswana, Tanzania, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon and South Africa. Australia is particularly significant as its flora constitutes 15% of the world's total of species, with 22% of them identified as under threat of extinction.\n\nSeed collections arrive at the MSBP in varying states, sometimes attached to fruits, sometimes clean. The collections usually also include a voucher specimen that can be used to identify the plant. The collections are immediately moved to a dry room until processing can be conducted where the seeds are cleaned of debris and other plant material, X-rayed, counted, and banked at . Seeds are banked in hermetically sealed glass containers along with Silica gel packets impregnated with indicator compounds that change colour if moisture seeps into the collection. Seeds are tested for viability with a germination test shortly after banking and then at regular 10 year intervals. If seed collections are low, re-harvesting from the wild is always the preferred option.\n\nWhen seeds are required for research purposes they can be requested from the MSBP's seedlist. If it has the legal permission to do so the MSB can then provide up to 60 seeds for free, to bona fide, non-commercial organisations for the purposes of research, restoration, and reintroduction. All seeds provided to institutions are on a non-profit mutual benefit basis. The MSB also operates the UK Native Seed Hub which aims to improve the resilience of the UK's ecological networks by providing high quality UK native seeds to conservation and restoration groups.\n\n\n"}

The cultural characteristics of \"Minnesota nice\" include polite friendliness, an aversion to confrontation, a tendency toward understatement, a disinclination to make a fuss or stand out, emotional restraint, and self-deprecation.\n\nPlaywright and corporate communications consultant Syl Jones suggested that \"Minnesota nice\" is not entirely about being \"nice\" but is more about keeping up appearances, maintaining the social order, and keeping people in their place. He relates these social norms to the literary work of Danish-Norwegian novelist Aksel Sandemose, the fictional Law of Jante, and more generally, Scandinavian culture. Garrison Keillor's \"A Prairie Home Companion\" discusses \"Wobegonics\", the supposed language of Minnesotans which includes \"no confrontational verbs or statements of strong personal preference\".\n\nThe generosity of state citizens has been commented on; the heavily-reported influenza vaccine shortage of late 2004 did not strike the state as hard as elsewhere since many people willingly gave up injections for others. The concept has also received some support from the academic community; a national study by Peter Rentfrow, Samuel Gosling, and Jeff Potter done in 2008 found that Minnesota was the second most agreeable and fifth most extroverted state in the nation, traits associated with \"nice\".\n\nThe tradition of social progressivism in Minnesota politics has been linked to the Minnesota Nice culture. \n\nMinnesota nice was an influence on the Coen brothers movie \"Fargo\", set in both Minnesota and neighboring North Dakota; a documentary about the making of the movie was entitled \"Minnesota Nice\".\n\n"}
{"id": "55223808", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55223808", "title": "Miscarriage and grief", "text": "Miscarriage and grief\n\nMiscarriage and grief are both an event and subsequent process of grieving that develops in response to a miscarriage. Almost all those experiencing a miscarriage experience grief. This event is often considered to be identical to the loss of a child and has been described as traumatic. \"Devastation\" is another descriptor of miscarriage. Grief differs from the emotion sadness. Sadness is an emotion along with grief, on the other hand, is a response to the loss a of the bond or affection was formed and is a process rather than one single emotional response. Grief is not equivalent to depression. Grief also has physical, cognitive, behavioral, social, cultural, and philosophical dimensions. Bereavement and mourning refer to the ongoing state of loss, and grief is the reaction to that loss. Emotional responses may be bitterness, anxiety, anger, surprise, fear, and disgust and blaming others; these responses may persist for months. Self-esteem can be diminished as another response to miscarriage. Not only does miscarriage tend to be a traumatic event, women describe their treatment afterwards to be worse than the miscarriage itself.\n\nA miscarriage can often be \"heart-breaking\". A miscarriage can effect the women, husband, partner, siblings, grandparents, the whole family system and friends. Almost all those experiencing a miscarriage go through a grieving process. Serious emotional impact is usually experienced immediately after the miscarriage. Some may go through the same loss when an ectopic pregnancy is terminated. In some, the realization of the loss can take weeks. Providing family support to those experiencing the loss can be challenging because some find comfort in talking about the miscarriage while others may find the event painful to discuss. The father of the baby can have the same sense of loss. Expressing feelings of grief and loss can sometimes be harder for men. Some women are able to begin planning their next pregnancy after a few weeks of having the miscarriage. For others, planning another pregnancy can be difficult. Organizations exist that provide information and counselling to help those who have had a miscarriage. Some women have a higher risk of developing prolonged grief and complicated grief than others.\n\nMiscarriage has an emotional effect and can also lead to psychological disorders. One discorder that can develop is primary maternal preoccupation. This is defined as a \" ...'special psychiatric condition' in which the pregnant woman identifies with her baby, highlights the crisis a woman faces when the baby with whom she is preoccupied and identified dies...\" Grieving manifests itself differently for each woman after miscarriage. It may often go unrecognized. The grief that follows a miscarriage resembles, but is not the same as, the grief experienced after the loss of a family member. Disbelief, depression, anger, and yearning, are described as being a part of the normal grieving process. These reactions remain from three to nine months after the loss. Forty-one percent of parents experience a normal, expected decline in grief in the first two years while 59% were delayed in the resolution of their grief.\n\nGrieving can create feelings of loneliness.\nThis grieving has been called a type of psychological trauma. Other serious consequences can develop including depression, anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and somatoform disorder. These responses all are associated with grieving after a miscarriage. Some women are able to complete the grieving process a few weeks after the miscarriage and start anticipating their next pregnancy. Planning another pregnancy is traumatic for others. The impact of a miscarriage can be \"crippling\" psychologically. Anger can be directed toward those who have had successful pregnancies and children. A woman can grieve the \"loss of a future child\" and question her own role as a mother. They may blame themselves or their partner for the miscarriage.\n\nUnsuccessful attempts to become pregnant through in vitro fertilization (IVF) can also illicit a similar grief response in women. Those experiencing a late miscarriage may have more significant distress compared to those who have experienced a miscarriage in the first trimester. Even depression can occur.\n\n\"Women today...are aught in a unique historical moment: technology encourages them to form emotional attachments to their pregnancies, but society has not developed traditions to cushion the shock when those attachmets are shattered.\"\n\nDescriptions of the miscarriage are expressed in non-clinical terms by those who have experienced the event.\n\nMiscarriage has been found to be a traumatic event and a major loss for women. Pregnancy loss, including induced abortion is a risk factor for mental illness. The impact of miscarriage can be underestimated. The trauma can be compounded if the miscarriage was accompanied by visible and relatively large amounts of blood loss.\nThe trauma of miscarriage can be compounded if the miscarriage was accompanied by visible and relatively large amounts of blood loss.\nBipolar disorders are associated with miscarriage. Depression and bilpolar disorder becomes evident after a miscarriage in 43% of women. Some women are more likely to experience complicated and prolonged grief than others.\n\nWomen experiencing miscarriage are at risk for grief reactions, anxiety or depression. Obsessiveness regarding the miscarriage can develop. Primary maternal preoccupation is also considered a consequence of miscarriage. This condition can occur if a woman who develop a close bond \"with her baby\" experiences the loss of the pregnancy.\n\nDifferent grieving \"styles\" can exist and vary between individuals. There can be a complete avoidance of dealing with the memories of the miscarriage and there can be an \"obsessive\" concentration on an event in the miscarriage. This is in contrast with the expected ability to \"reminisce about the loss of a loved one\". Complicated grief differs from the more common form of grief that occurs after a miscarriage. The grieving process associated with other events such as the loss of a spouse or parent is expected to decline in predictable and steady rate. This not true for those experiencing grief after a miscarriage because only 41% follow the expected decline in grief while most, 59% do not fit this pattern.\n\nMiscarriage is associated with post traumatic stress disorder.\nRisks for developing PTSD after miscarriage are: emotional pain, expressions of emotion, and low levels of social support. Even if relatively low levels of stress occur after the miscarriage, symptoms of PTSD including flashbacks, intrusive thoughts, dissociation and hyperarousal can later develop. The effects of stress can complicate miscarriage. Miscarriage is a stressful event and because stress is a risk factor for subsequent miscarriage, its presence can become part of cycle that continues. Lower stress levels are associated with more favorable outcomes in future pregnancies while higher stress levels increase the risk.\n\nPhysical recovery from miscarriage can have an effect on emotional disturbances. The body has to recover from the sudden pregnancy loss. In some instances ffatigue is present. Insomnia can be a problem. The miscarriage is very upsetting to the family and can generate very strong emotions. Some women may feel that the miscarriage occurred because they somehow had caused it. Others may blame the father or partner for the miscarriage. Coping with a miscarriage can very greatly between women and families. Some find it difficult to talk about the miscarriage. The narratives of women tend to coincide with quantified and measurable effects. Some women engage in activities that are believed to aid in recovery such as therapy, religion and art.\nCounseling can be offered but effective interventions to assist in recovery have been difficult to identify due to the reports of efficacy and ineffective counseling. Comparisons are hard to make. Despite the lack of studies that describe effective interventions for those with grief after a miscarriage, some clinicians still offer counselling and follow-up to help women recover and adapt to the loss.\n\nRecommendations to help recover from the event include:\n\nGenerally, the impact of experiencing miscarriage is underestimated. Other methods used to promote recovery are be relaxation techniques, guided imagery, and \"thought-stopping\". Even Gestalt role-playing has been used. Some women can \"emotionally relocate the child\", redefine a relationship \"with the missing child\", and engage in \"continuing the bond\" to incorporate the loss into their life experiences.\n\nWomen who have miscarried report that they were dissatisfied with the care they received from physicians and nurses. One observer highlights the insensitivity of some health care providers when they approach the grieving mother \"...by playing down her emotion as somehow an irrational response...\" Clinicians may not recognize the psychological impact of the miscarriage and can \"expect parents to move on with their lives.\"\n\nSince the experiences of women can vary so widely, sensitive nursing care afterward is appropriate.\n\nOne emotional response to miscarriage is the strong apprehension that can develop anticipating a subsequent pregnancy. Procreation abilities may also be questioned by the woman. Significant distress can develop in the other children in the family when they think a sibling has died. They may regard this as a baby they did not get to meet. They can also experience grief and guilt find it difficult to express these emotions to their parents. The siblings may feel a need to act as if everything is the same and that they are unaffected in an attempt to protect their parents from their own feelings. Children can also need help, understanding and the ability to make sense of the event.\n\nRituals that recognize the loss can be important in coping. Family and friends often conduct a memorial or burial service. Hospitals also can provide support and help memorialize the event. Depending on locale others desire to have a private ceremony. The religious faith of the woman and family impacts the grief process. Conversely, the lack of recognition that the miscarriage has occurred by family and friends can be troubling and add to the trauma of the event.\nGrieving after the loss of a child through miscarriage in other cultures can vary from western culture. An individual’s culture plays a large role in determining an inappropriate pattern of grief, and it is appropriate to take into account cultural norms before reaching a complicated grief diagnosis. There are cultural differences in emotional levels, how these are expressed and how long they are expressed. External symptoms of grief differ in non-Western cultures, presenting increased somatization. Narratives by Swedish women include their own perception of losing a child. Investigations describe their grief over their miscarriage: \"When miscarriage occurs it is not a gore, an embryo, or a fetus they lose, it is their child. They feel that they are the cause of the miscarriage through something they have done, eaten, or thought. They feel abandonment and they grieve for their profound loss; they are actually in bereavement.\" Native American women have cut their long hair following the death of a family member. The narratives of women tend to coincide with quantified and measurable effects. In women who are induced to have an abortion, an identical grieving process can occur. The emotional responses to a spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) and an elective abortion are sometimes identical. Spanish women experience grief in much the same way in the rest of Western culture. Some women find online forums helpful.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1834251", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1834251", "title": "Morteza Motahhari", "text": "Morteza Motahhari\n\nMorteza Motahari (; January 31, 1919 – May 1, 1979) was an Iranian cleric, philosopher, lecturer, and politician.\n\nMotahari is considered to have an important influence on the ideologies of the Islamic Republic, among others. He was a co-founder of Hosseiniye Ershad and the Combatant Clergy Association (\"Jāme'e-ye Rowhāniyat-e Mobārez\"). He was a disciple of Ayatollah Khomeini during the Shah's reign and formed the Council of the Islamic Revolution at Khomeini's request. He was chairman of the council at the time of his assassination.\n\nMotahari was born in Fariman on January 31, 1919. He attended the Hawza of Qom from 1944 to 1952 and then left for Tehran. His grandfather was an eminent religious scholar in Sistan province and since he traveled with his family to Khorasan Province, there is little information about his origin as Sistanian. His father Shaykh Mohammad Hosseini was also an eminent figure in his village, Fariman, who was respected by the people. He was considered as one of the pupils of Akhund Khorasani and besides he was admired by Ayatollah Mara'shi Najafi.\n\nIt is said that he was very intelligent as a child. At the age of 5, he went to school without informing his parents. Sometimes he was found sleeping near the school. By the age of twelve he learned the preliminary Islamic sciences from his father. He also went to the seminary of Mashhad and studied for two years there in the school of Abd ul-Khan along with his brother. But his studies remained unfinished in Mashhad seminary because of problems faced by his family which obliged him to return to Fariman to help them.\n\nAccording to his own account, in this period he could study a great number of historical books. It was in this period that he was confronted with questions on worldview such as the problem of God. He considered Agha Mirza Mahdi Shahid Razavi as an eminent master in rational sciences. He decided to go to Qom in 1315 Solar Hijri calendar.\n\nHe finally took up residence in the school of Feyzieh in Qum. He studied books Kifayah and Makaseb in Shia jurisprudence under instruction of Ayatollah Sayyed Mohaqeq Yazdi popularly known as Damad. He also participated in the lectures of Hojjat Kooh Kamarehei ant sough knowledge from Sayyed Sadr Al Din Sadr, Mohammad Taqi Khansari, Golpaygani, Aaahmad Khansari and Najafi Marashi.\n\nWhen Ayatollah Boroujerdi emigrated to Qom, Motahari could take part in his courses on Principles of Jurisprudence. Ayatollah Montazeri was his classmate in this period.\n\nLater, Motahari emigrates to Isfahan because of hot climate of Qom. There he becomes familiar with Haj Ali Agha Shirazi who was the teacher of Nahj Al Balaghah in 1320 Solar Hijri calendar who Motahari always describes with honor.\nLater, he joined the University of Tehran, where he taught philosophy for 22 years. Between 1965 and 1973 he also gave regular lectures at the Hosseiniye Ershad in Northern Tehran.\n\nMotahari wrote several books on Islam, Iran, and historical topics. His emphasis was on teaching rather than writing. However, after his death, some of his students worked on writing down his lectures and publishing them as books. As of the mid-2008, the \"Sadra Publication\" published more than sixty volumes by Motahari. Nearly 30 books were written about Motahari or quoted from his speeches.\n\nMorteza Motahari opposed what he called groups who \"depend on other schools, especially materialistic schools\" but who present these \"foreign ideas with Islamic emblems\". In a June 1977 article he wrote to warn \"all great Islamic authorities\" of the danger of \"these external influential ideas under the pretext and banner of Islam.\" It is thought he was referring to the People's Mujahideen of Iran and the Furqan Group.\n\nMotahari was the father in law of Iran's former secretary of National Security Council Ali Larijani. It was by Motahari's advice that Larijani switched from computer science to Western Philosophy for graduate studies.\n\nA major street in Tehran formerly known as \"Takhte Tavoos\" (Peacock Throne) was renamed after him. Morteza Motahari Street connects Sohrevardi Street and Vali Asr Street, two major streets in Tehran.\n\nDuring the struggle with shah’s regime, Morteza Motahari contributed in creating new Islamic discourses. Besides, he was among those who had discussed the conditions of Marja' after the death of Ayatollah Broujerdi. He wrote the book \"Mutual services of Iran and Islam\" in such a condition. Also his works had important impact on expanding the movement of religious reform in early days of revolution. His works primarily consisted of traditional Islamic and Shia thoughts. He wrote an essay about revitalization of religious thought in the occasion. Writing the \"need for Candidness in religious leadership\", he aimed to show the youth the attractiveness of Islam.\n\nDuring the revolution, while Shapour Bakhtiyar prevented Khomeini's return to Iran in 1978, Ayatollah Motahari was the leader who managed the protester clergies in Tehran University's mosque. Motahari was an important figure, and helped Ayatollah Khomeini to organize revolutionary department.\n\nMorteza Motahari expressed his opinions in different majors and disciplines such as philosophy, religion, economic, politics and etc. Motahari and Shariati were counted as two prominent figures during Islamic revolution of Iran. He emphasized on Islamic democracy for suitable political structure.\n\nMotahari also recognized fitra as the truth of human. According to him, fitra is a permanent and unchangeable quality in human nature. In fact, he believed that fitra played the role of a mediator in God-human beings relation. Also, he believed that Imam was a perfect man who shows the high rank of human spirituality. Imam also is characterized as a religious leader. His lengthy footnote on the “book of principles of philosophy and method of realism” by Muhammad Husayn Tabataba'i was against the historical Marxism. Also he believed that \"Wali-e faqih\" only had the right of supervisory not governing. He also maintained that the ruling was one of the political aspect of Imam in society. He maintained that there was no conflict between science and religion since he believed that Science qua science had no conflict and challenge with metaphysics. He believed that the quasi-conflict between science and religion was in terms of their language not themselves.\n\nMotahari also expressed views on development and relevant ideology. According to him, freedom, culture and mental-cultural revolution are principles of development. He also refers to some elements for characterizing a developed society.these factors are independence, knowledge and transcendence. Also, according to Motahari, development originates from cultural self-reliance, purification of cultural sources and logical and cautious communication with west. Motahari believed in the development of human resources but he also thought that economy was not an aim but only is a condition for development.\n\nAs outlined by Ayatollah Morteza Motahari in 1975, the phrase ‘equal rights’ means something different from what is commonly understood by western world. He clarified that men and women were innately different and therefore enjoyed different rights, duties and punishments.\n\nMotahari believed that the eternality of Islam is provided by \"Fiqh\". He thought that fiqh along with the character of ijtihad could be an important thing for confronting with the problem of different times and places. Using ijtihad, there is no need to a new prophet.\n\nMotahari also believed that there were great challenges between scientists for knowing the human as a phenomenon and at the same time we can rarely find two philosophers who have common ideas in their approach toward studying humanity.\n\nMotahari defined freedom as nonexistence of obstacles. According to him, obstacles were of two characters. The first one was that obstacle could limit human and besides counted as a something get human not to do something. In simple word, obstacle could has the dignity of limiting and declining humans. The second one is to thing which decline the perception and introspection of subject in terms of knowledge. According to Motahhari, aside from the realization of putting away obstacles we need to give the spirit of freedom. He analyze the concept of freedom as both right and obligation. He believes that the freedom has necessity for human. Human must be free to choose voluntarily his path. He believes that, contrary to liberalists, inborn right has an ultimate for transcending of human beings.\n\nLike other men of thought, Motahari thinks that we have to define the concepts first of all. Therefore, he defines right as a dominance or score on something. According to right the human is merit to possess something and other human ought to respect him. Some of rights are such as the right of parents on their children or the rights of husband and wife in relation to each other. Motahari divided the right into two groups. First group is existential rights Or Takwini and the second is religious rights or tashriei. former is a real relation between person and object and the latter determined according to former. He knew the right as a potential score for persons. In fact the right concerned with the priority of somebody on something. He concerned with the question in that is the right and possession predicated on human as such or predicated on human in terms of being in society? He believes that undoubtedly the right existed prior to society.Contrary to John Austin (legal philosopher), Motahari believes that there is a mutual relation between right and responsibility (\"Haq va Taklif\"). Motahari believes that the natural law theory is a rational one that is of importance for human kind. According to him, the foundation of natural theory of law is to world has a goal and aim finally. On the basis of principle of having goal, the God creates the world for the sake of human kind and they have potential right to change the world therefore human kind have right prior to introducing in society.\n\nMotahari refers to the concept of Maktab or school when he intends to define the word of religion. According to him maktab is a thoughtful disciplined system including ideology and View in terms of ethics, politics, economy and civil law and etc. Finally, he defines religion as a collection of knowledge bestowed to human for the sake of guiding him and also religion is a collection of beliefs, moralities and individual and collective judgments. Therefore, he knows religion and its teaching as beliefs, moralities and judgments. Also Motahari believes that the domain of religion at all is not limited to life but concerned with after afterlife. He believes that Islam as a religion is consistent with life of human and there is no room for denying it.\n\nDariush Shayegan believes that Motahari confused the hegelian thought and Stace's quotations in confronting with Hegel. According to Shaygan since each of Motahari and hegel belong to different paradigms, there is no common world between them.\n\nHe considered Marxism as a great threat for youths and revolution of Iran therefore he tried to criticize Marxism along with pioneer figures like shariati. Also his commentary on the book of Mulla Sadra influenced many scholars. Besides, he also emphasized on the social, cultural and historical contingencies of religious knowledge. Motahari argued that if someone compares fatwas belong to different jurists and at the same time considers their lives and states of knowledge then it is clear that the presuppositions of jurists and its knowledge affected their knowledge. According to him, because of this reason, we observe that the fatwa belong to Arab has an Arab flavor and the fatwa belong to non-Arab has an Ajam flavor. Also He tried to compare Quran with nature. He also believed that the contemporary interpretations of Quran were considerable than Ancient rendition of Islam because the future generation has a better understanding of Quran and Also a deeper appreciation of it. But At the same Time he doesn’t believe in epistemological pluralism.\nBecause of his activities, he was favored by revolutionary people and was hated by anti-revolutionaries group, such as the Islamist Furqan Group. On 1 May 1979 Morteza Motahari was assassinated in Tehran by gunshot after leaving a late meeting at the house of Yadollah Sahabi. The Furqan Group claimed responsibility for the assassination. The alleged assassin was the group's founder, Akbar Goudarzi.\n\n\nHe \"authored over fifty books, which dealt with theology and philosophy as well as practical issues such as sexual ethics, usury, and insurance\", some of which include:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "205495", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=205495", "title": "Richard Rorty", "text": "Richard Rorty\n\nRichard McKay Rorty (October 4, 1931 – June 8, 2007) was an American philosopher. Educated at the University of Chicago and Yale University, he had strong interests and training in both the history of philosophy and contemporary analytic philosophy, the latter of which came to comprise the main focus of his work at Princeton University in the 1960s. He subsequently came to reject the tradition of philosophy according to which knowledge involves correct representation (a \"mirror of nature\") of a world whose existence remains wholly independent of that representation. Rorty had a long and diverse academic career, including positions as Stuart Professor of Philosophy at Princeton University, Kenan Professor of Humanities at the University of Virginia, and Professor of Comparative Literature at Stanford University. Among his most influential books are \"Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature\" (1979), \"Consequences of Pragmatism\" (1982), and \"Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity\" (1989).\n\nRorty saw the idea of knowledge as a \"mirror of nature\" as pervasive throughout the history of western philosophy. Against this approach, Rorty advocated for a novel form of American pragmatism, sometimes called neopragmatism, in which scientific and philosophical methods form merely a set of contingent \"vocabularies\" which people abandon or adopt over time according to social conventions and usefulness. Abandoning representationalist accounts of knowledge and language, Rorty believed, would lead to a state of mind he referred to as \"ironism\", in which people become completely aware of the contingency of their placement in history and of their philosophical vocabulary. Rorty tied this brand of philosophy to the notion of \"social hope\"; he believed that without the representationalist accounts, and without metaphors between the mind and the world, human society would behave more peacefully. He also emphasized the reasons why the interpretation of culture as conversation (Bernstein 1971), constitutes the crucial concept of a \"postphilosophical\" culture determined to abandon representationalist accounts of traditional epistemology, incorporating American pragmatist naturalism that considers the natural sciences as an advance towards liberalism.\n\nRichard Rorty was born on October 4, 1931, in New York City. His parents, James and Winifred Rorty, were activists, writers and social democrats. His maternal grandfather, Walter Rauschenbusch, was a central figure in the Social Gospel movement of the early 20th century.\nHis father experienced two nervous breakdowns in his later life. The second breakdown, which he had in the early 1960s, was more serious and \"included claims to divine prescience.\" Consequently, Richard Rorty fell into depression as a teenager and in 1962 began a six-year psychiatric analysis for obsessional neurosis. Rorty wrote about the beauty of rural New Jersey orchids in his short autobiography, \"Trotsky and the Wild Orchids.\" His colleague Jürgen Habermas's obituary for Rorty points out that Rorty's contrasting childhood experiences, such as beautiful orchids versus reading a book in his parents' house that defended Leon Trotsky against Stalin, created an early interest in philosophy. He describes Rorty as an ironist:\n\nNothing is sacred to Rorty the ironist. Asked at the end of his life about the 'holy', the strict atheist answered with words reminiscent of the young Hegel: 'My sense of the holy is bound up with the hope that some day my remote descendants will live in a global civilization in which love is pretty much the only law.'\n\nRorty enrolled at the University of Chicago shortly before turning 15, where he received a bachelor's and a master's degree in philosophy (studying under Richard McKeon), continuing at Yale University for a PhD in philosophy (1952–1956). He married another academic, Amélie Oksenberg Rorty (Harvard University professor), with whom he had a son, Jay, in 1954. After two years in the United States Army, he taught at Wellesley College for three years until 1961. Rorty divorced his wife and then married Stanford University bioethicist Mary Varney Rorty in 1972. They had two children, Kevin and Patricia. While Richard Rorty was a \"strict atheist\" (Habermas), Mary Varney Rorty was a practicing Mormon.\n\nRorty was a professor of philosophy at Princeton University for 21 years. In 1981, he was a recipient of a MacArthur Fellowship, commonly known as the \"Genius Award,\" in its first year of awarding, and in 1982 he became Kenan Professor of the Humanities at the University Of Virginia. In 1997 Rorty became professor of comparative literature (and philosophy, by courtesy), at Stanford University, where he spent the remainder of his academic career. During this period he was especially popular, and once quipped that he had been assigned to the position of \"transitory professor of trendy studies.\"\n\nRorty's doctoral dissertation, \"The Concept of Potentiality\" was an historical study of the concept, completed under the supervision of Paul Weiss, but his first book (as editor), \"The Linguistic Turn\" (1967), was firmly in the prevailing analytic mode, collecting classic essays on the linguistic turn in analytic philosophy. However, he gradually became acquainted with the American philosophical movement known as pragmatism, particularly the writings of John Dewey. The noteworthy work being done by analytic philosophers such as Willard Van Orman Quine and Wilfrid Sellars caused significant shifts in his thinking, which were reflected in his next book, \"Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature\" (1979).\n\nPragmatists generally hold that the meaning of a proposition is determined by its use in linguistic practice. Rorty combined pragmatism about truth and other matters with a later Wittgensteinian philosophy of language which declares that meaning is a social-linguistic product, and sentences do not 'link up' with the world in a correspondence relation. Rorty wrote in his \"Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity\" (1989):\n\nTruth cannot be out there—cannot exist independently of the human mind—because sentences cannot so exist, or be out there. The world is out there, but descriptions of the world are not. Only descriptions of the world can be true or false. The world on its own unaided by the describing activities of humans cannot.\"(5)\n\nViews like this led Rorty to question many of philosophy's most basic assumptions—and have also led to him being apprehended as a postmodern/deconstructionist philosopher. Indeed, from the late 1980s through the 1990s, Rorty focused on the continental philosophical tradition, examining the works of Friederich Nietzsche, Martin Heidegger, Michel Foucault, Jean-François Lyotard and Jacques Derrida. His work from this period included \"Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity\", \"Essays on Heidegger and Others: Philosophical Papers\" (1991) and \"Truth and Progress: Philosophical Papers\" (1998). The latter two works attempt to bridge the dichotomy between analytic and continental philosophy by claiming that the two traditions complement rather than oppose each other.\n\nAccording to Rorty, analytic philosophy may not have lived up to its pretensions and may not have solved the puzzles it thought it had. Yet such philosophy, in the process of finding reasons for putting those pretensions and puzzles aside, helped earn itself an important place in the history of ideas. By giving up on the quest for apodicticity and finality that Edmund Husserl shared with Rudolf Carnap and Bertrand Russell, and by finding new reasons for thinking that such quest will never succeed, analytic philosophy cleared a path that leads past scientism, just as the German idealists cleared a path that led around empiricism.\n\nIn the last fifteen years of his life, Rorty continued to publish his writings, including four volumes of his archived philosophical papers, \"Achieving Our Country\" (1998), a political manifesto partly based on readings of Dewey and Walt Whitman in which he defended the idea of a progressive, pragmatic left against what he feels are defeatist, anti-liberal, anti-humanist positions espoused by the critical left and continental school. Rorty felt these anti-humanist positions were personified by figures like Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Foucault. Such theorists were also guilty of an \"inverted Platonism\" in which they attempted to craft overarching, metaphysical, \"sublime\" philosophies—which in fact contradicted their core claims to be ironist and contingent. Rorty's last works, after his move to Stanford University, focused on the place of religion in contemporary life, liberal communities, comparative literature and philosophy as \"cultural politics.\"\n\nShortly before his death, he wrote a piece called \"The Fire of Life,\" (published in the November 2007 issue of \"Poetry\" magazine), in which he meditates on his diagnosis and the comfort of poetry. He concludes, \"I now wish that I had spent somewhat more of my life with verse. This is not because I fear having missed out on truths that are incapable of statement in prose. There are no such truths; there is nothing about death that Swinburne and Landor knew but Epicurus and Heidegger failed to grasp. Rather, it is because I would have lived more fully if I had been able to rattle off more old chestnuts—just as I would have if I had made more close friends. Cultures with richer vocabularies are more fully human—farther removed from the beasts—than those with poorer ones; individual men and women are more fully human when their memories are amply stocked with verses.\"\n\nOn June 8, 2007, Rorty died in his home from pancreatic cancer.\n\nIn \"Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature\" (1979), Rorty argues that the central problems of modern epistemology depend upon a picture of the mind as trying to faithfully represent (or \"mirror\") a mind-independent, external reality. If we give up this metaphor, then the entire enterprise of foundationalist epistemology is misguided. A foundationalist believes that in order to avoid the regress inherent in claiming that all beliefs are justified by other beliefs, some beliefs must be self-justifying and form the foundations to all knowledge.\n\nThere were two senses of \"foundationalism\" criticized in \"Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature\". In the epistemological sense, Rorty criticized the attempt to justify knowledge claims by tracing them to a set of foundations (e.g., self-evident premises or noninferential sensations); more broadly, he criticized the claim of philosophy to function foundationally within a culture. The former argument draws on Sellars's critique of the idea that there is a \"given\" in sensory perception, in combination with Quine's critique of the distinction between analytic sentences (sentences which are true solely in virtue of what they mean) and synthetic sentences (sentences made true by the world). Each critique, taken alone, provides a problem for a conception of how philosophy ought to proceed, yet leaves enough of the tradition intact to proceed with its former aspirations. Combined, Rorty claimed, the two critiques are devastating. With no privileged insight into the structure of belief and no privileged realm of truths of meaning, we have, instead, knowledge as those beliefs that pay their way. The only worthwhile description of the actual process of inquiry, Rorty claimed, was a Kuhnian account of the standard phases of the progress of disciplines, oscillating through normal and abnormal periods, between routine problem-solving and intellectual crises.\n\nAfter rejecting foundationalism, Rorty argues that one of the few roles left for a philosopher is to act as an intellectual gadfly, attempting to induce a revolutionary break with previous practice, a role that Rorty was happy to take on himself. Rorty suggests that each generation tries to subject all disciplines to the model that the most successful discipline of the day employs. In Rorty's view, the success of modern science has led academics in philosophy and the humanities to mistakenly imitate scientific methods. \"Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature\" popularized and extended ideas of Wilfrid Sellars (the critique of the Myth of the given) and Willard Van Orman Quine (the critique of the analytic-synthetic distinction) and others who advocate the Wittgensteinian doctrine of \"dissolving\" rather than solving philosophical problems.\n\nIn \"Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity\" (1989), Rorty abandons specifically analytic modes of explication in favor of narrative pastiche in order to develop an alternative conceptual vocabulary to that of the \"Platonists\" he rejects. This schema is based on the belief that there is no worthwhile theory of truth, aside from a non-epistemic semantic one (as Donald Davidson developed out of the work of Alfred Tarski). Rorty suggests that the task of philosophy should be distinguished along public and private lines. Private philosophers, who provide one with greater abilities to (re)create oneself, a view adapted from Nietzsche and which Rorty also identifies with the novels of Marcel Proust and Vladimir Nabokov, should not be expected to help with public problems. For a public philosophy, one might turn to Rawls or Habermas.\n\nThis book also marks his first attempt to specifically articulate a political vision consistent with his philosophy, the vision of a diverse community bound together by opposition to cruelty, and not by abstract ideas such as 'justice' or 'common humanity,' policed by the separation of the public and private realms of life.\n\nIn this book, Rorty introduces the terminology of Ironism, which he uses to describe his mindset and his philosophy.\n\nAmongst the essays in \"Objectivity, Relativism, and Truth: Philosophical Papers, Volume 1\" (1990), is \"The Priority of Democracy to Philosophy,\" in which Rorty defends Rawls against communitarian critics. Rorty argues that liberalism can \"get along without philosophical presuppositions,\" while at the same time conceding to communitarians that \"a conception of the self that makes the community constitutive of the self does comport well with liberal democracy.\" For Rorty, social institutions ought to be thought of as \"experiments in cooperation rather than as attempts to embody a universal and ahistorical order.\"\n\nIn this text, Rorty focuses primarily on the continental philosophers Heidegger and Derrida. He argues that these European \"post-Nietzscheans\" share much with American pragmatists, in that they critique metaphysics and reject the correspondence theory of truth. When discussing Derrida, Rorty claims that Derrida is most useful when viewed as a funny writer who attempted to circumvent the Western philosophical tradition, rather than the inventor of a philosophical (or literary) \"method.\" In this vein, Rorty criticizes Derrida's followers like Paul de Man for taking deconstructive literary theory too seriously.\n\nIn \"Achieving Our Country: Leftist Thought in Twentieth-Century America\" (1997), Rorty differentiates between what he sees as the two sides of the Left, a cultural Left and a progressive Left. He criticizes the cultural Left, which is exemplified by post-structuralists such as Foucault and postmodernists such as Lyotard, for offering critiques of society, but no alternatives (or alternatives that are so vague and general as to be abdications). Although these intellectuals make insightful claims about the ills of society, Rorty suggests that they provide no alternatives and even occasionally deny the possibility of progress. On the other hand, the progressive Left, exemplified for Rorty by the pragmatist Dewey, Whitman and James Baldwin, makes hope for a better future its priority. Without hope, Rorty argues, change is spiritually inconceivable and the cultural Left has begun to breed cynicism. Rorty sees the progressive Left as acting in the philosophical spirit of pragmatism.\n\nRorty's notion of human rights is grounded on the notion of sentimentality. He contended that throughout history humans have devised various means of construing certain groups of individuals as inhuman or subhuman. Thinking in rationalist (foundationalist) terms will not solve this problem, he claimed. Rorty advocated the creation of a culture of global human rights in order to stop violations from happening through a sentimental education. He argued that we should create a sense of empathy or teach empathy to others so as to understand others' suffering.\n\nRorty is among the most widely discussed and controversial contemporary philosophers, and his works have provoked thoughtful responses from many other well-respected figures in the field. In Robert Brandom's anthology, entitled \"Rorty and His Critics\", for example, Rorty's philosophy is discussed by Donald Davidson, Jürgen Habermas, Hilary Putnam, John McDowell, Jacques Bouveresse, and Daniel Dennett, among others. In 2007, Roger Scruton wrote, \"Rorty was paramount among those thinkers who advance their own opinion as immune to criticism, by pretending that it is not truth but consensus that counts, while defining the consensus in terms of people like themselves.\" Ralph Marvin Tumaob concludes that Rorty was really influenced by the notion of Jean-François Lyotard's Metanarratives, and by this he further added that \"postmodernism was influenced further by the works of Rorty\".\n\nJohn McDowell is strongly influenced by Rorty, particularly by Rorty's \"Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature\" (1979). In continental philosophy, authors such as Jürgen Habermas, Gianni Vattimo, Jacques Derrida, Albrecht Wellmer, Hans Joas, Chantal Mouffe, Simon Critchley, Esa Saarinen, and Mike Sandbothe are influenced in different ways by Rorty's thinking. American novelist David Foster Wallace titled a short story in his collection \"\" \"Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature\", and critics have attributed some of Wallace's writings on Irony to Rorty.\n\nSusan Haack has been a fierce critic of Rorty's neopragmatism. Haack criticises Rorty's claim to be a pragmatist at all and wrote a short play called \"We Pragmatists\", where Rorty and Charles Sanders Peirce have a fictional conversation using only accurate quotes from their own writing. For Haack, the only link between Rorty's neopragmatism and the pragmatism of Peirce is the name. Haack believes Rorty's neopragmatism is both anti-philosophical and anti-intellectual, and exposes people further to rhetorical manipulation.\n\nAlthough Rorty was an avowed liberal, his political and moral philosophies have been attacked by commentators from the Left, some of whom believe them to be insufficient frameworks for social justice. Rorty was also criticized by others for his rejection of the idea that science can depict the world. One criticism, especially of \"Contingency, irony, and solidarity\" is that Rorty's philosophical 'hero', the ironist, is an elitist figure. Rorty claims that the majority of people would be \"commonsensically nominalist and historicist\" but not ironist. These people would combine an ongoing attention to the particular as opposed to the transcendent (nominalism), with an awareness of their place in a continuum of contingent lived experience alongside other individuals (historicist), without necessarily having continual doubts about the resulting worldview as the ironist does. An ironist is someone who: 1) \"has radical and continuing doubts about their final vocabulary\"; 2) \"realizes that argument phrased in their vocabulary can neither underwrite nor dissolve these doubts\"; and 3) \"does not think their vocabulary is closer to reality than others\" (all 73, \"Contingency, irony, and solidarity\"). On the other hand, the Italian philosopher Gianni Vattimo alongside the Spanish philosopher Santiago Zabala in their 2011 book \"Hermeneutic Communism: from Heidegger to Marx\" affirm that \"together with Richard Rorty we also consider it a flaw that 'the main thing contemporary academic Marxists inherit from Marx and Engels is the conviction that the quest for the cooperative commonwealth should be scientific rather than utopian, knowing rather than romantic.' As we will show hermeneutics contains all the utopian and romantic features that Rorty refers to because, contrary to the knowledge of science, it does not claim modern universality but rather postmodern particularism.\"\n\nRorty often draws on a broad range of other philosophers to support his views, and his interpretation of their works has been contested. Since Rorty is working from a tradition of re-interpretation, he remains uninterested in 'accurately' portraying other thinkers, but rather in utilizing their work in the same way a literary critic might use a novel. His essay \"The Historiography of Philosophy: Four Genres\" is a thorough description of how he treats the greats in the history of philosophy. In \"Contingency, irony, and solidarity\", Rorty attempts to disarm those who criticize his writings by arguing that their philosophical criticisms are made using axioms that are explicitly rejected within Rorty's own philosophy. For instance, Rorty defines allegations of irrationality as affirmations of vernacular \"otherness\", and so—Rorty claims—accusations of irrationality can be expected during \"any\" argument and must simply be brushed aside.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "474321", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=474321", "title": "Robinson Jeffers", "text": "Robinson Jeffers\n\nJohn Robinson Jeffers (January 10, 1887 – January 20, 1962) was an American poet, known for his work about the central California coast. Much of Jeffers' poetry was written in narrative and epic form. However, he is also known for his shorter verse and is considered an icon of the environmental movement. Influential and highly regarded in some circles, despite or because of his philosophy of \"inhumanism\", Jeffers believed that transcending conflict required human concerns to be de-emphasized in favor of the boundless whole. This led him to oppose U.S. participation in World War II, a stance that was controversial after the U.S. entered the war.\n\nJeffers was born in Allegheny, Pennsylvania (now part of Pittsburgh), the son of Reverend Dr. William Hamilton Jeffers, a Presbyterian minister and scholar of ancient languages and Biblical history, and Annie Robinson Tuttle. His brother was Hamilton Jeffers, a well-known astronomer who worked at Lick Observatory. Jeffers traveled through Europe during his youth and attended school in Germany, France, and Switzerland. An outstanding student, he was instructed in the classics and Greek and Latin language and literature. By age twelve, he was fluent in German and French as well as English. He earned his bachelor's degree from Occidental College at age 18. While attending college he was an avid outdoorsman and active in the school's literary societies.\n\nAfter he graduated from Occidental, Jeffers went to the University of Southern California (USC) to study at first literature, and then medicine. He met Una Call Kuster in 1906; she was three years older than he was, a graduate student, and the wife of a Los Angeles attorney. Jeffers and Mrs. Kuster became lovers. Mr. Kuster discovered their affair in 1910. Jeffers dropped out of USC medical school and enrolled as a forestry student at the University of Washington in Seattle, a course of study that he abandoned after a semester, at which time he returned to Los Angeles. By 1912 the affair became a scandal, reaching the front page of the \"Los Angeles Times\". Una spent some time in Europe to quiet things down, then the lovers lived together by Lake Washington to await the completion of Una's divorce. The two were married in 1913, then moved to La Jolla, California, and finally Carmel, California, where Jeffers constructed Tor House and Hawk Tower. The couple had a daughter who died a day after birth in 1913, and then twin sons (Donnan and Garth) in 1916. Una died of cancer in 1950. Jeffers died in 1962; an obituary can be found in the \"New York Times\", January 22, 1962.\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, at the height of his popularity, Jeffers was famous for being a tough outdoorsman, living in relative solitude and writing of the difficulty and beauty of the wild. He spent most of his life in Carmel, California, in a granite house that he had built himself called \"Tor House and Hawk Tower\". \"Tor\" is a term for a craggy outcrop or lookout. Before Jeffers and Una purchased the land where Tor House would be built, they rented two cottages in Carmel, and enjoyed many afternoon walks and picnics at the \"tors\" near the site that would become Tor House.\n\nTo build the first part of Tor House, a small, two story cottage, Jeffers hired a local builder, Michael Murphy. He worked with Murphy, and in this short, informal apprenticeship, he learned the art of stonemasonry. He continued adding on to Tor House throughout his life, writing in the mornings and working on the house in the afternoon. Many of his poems reflect the influence of stone and building on his life.\n\nHe later built a large four-story stone tower on the site called Hawk Tower. While he had not visited Ireland at this point in his life, it is possible that Hawk Tower is based on Francis Joseph Bigger's 'Castle Séan' at Ardglass, County Down, which had also in turn influenced Yeats' choice of a poets tower, Thoor Ballylee. Construction on Tor House continued into the late 1950s and early 1960s, and was completed by his eldest son. The completed residence was used as a family home until his descendants decided to turn it over to the Tor House Foundation, formed by Ansel Adams, for historic preservation. The romantic Gothic tower was named after a hawk that appeared while Jeffers was working on the structure, and which disappeared the day it was completed. The tower was a gift for his wife Una, who had a fascination for Irish literature and stone towers. In Una's special room on the second floor were kept many of her favorite items, photographs of Jeffers taken by the artist Weston, plants and dried flowers from Shelley's grave, and a rosewood melodeon which she loved to play. The tower also included a secret interior staircase – a source of great fun for his young sons.\n\nDuring this time, Jeffers published volumes of long narrative blank verse that shook up the national literary scene. These poems, including \"Tamar\" and \"Roan Stallion\", introduced Jeffers as a master of the epic form, reminiscent of ancient Greek poets. These poems were full of controversial subject matter such as incest, murder and parricide. Jeffers' short verse includes \"Hurt Hawks,\" \"The Purse-Seine\" and \"Shine, Perishing Republic.\" His intense relationship with the physical world is described in often brutal and apocalyptic verse, and demonstrates a preference for the natural world over what he sees as the negative influence of civilization. Jeffers did not accept the idea that meter is a fundamental part of poetry, and, like Marianne Moore, claimed his verse was not composed in meter, but \"rolling stresses.\" He believed meter was imposed on poetry by man and not a fundamental part of its nature.\n\nMany books followed Jeffers' initial success with the epic form, including an adaptation of Euripides' \"Medea\", which became a hit Broadway play starring Dame Judith Anderson. D. H. Lawrence, Edgar Lee Masters, Benjamin De Casseres, and George Sterling were close friends of Jeffers, Sterling having the longest and most intimate relationship with him. While living in Carmel, Jeffers became the focal point for a small but devoted group of admirers. At the peak of his fame, he was one of the few poets to be featured on the cover of \"Time Magazine\". He was also asked to read at the Library of Congress, and was posthumously put on a U.S. postage stamp.\n\nPart of the decline of Jeffers' popularity was due to his staunch opposition to the United States' entering World War II. In fact, his book \"The Double Axe and Other Poems\" (1948), a volume of poems that was largely critical of U.S. policy, came with an extremely unconventional note from Random House that the views expressed by Jeffers were not those of the publishing company. Soon after, his work was received negatively by several influential literary critics. Several particularly scathing pieces were penned by Yvor Winters, as well as by Kenneth Rexroth, who had been very positive in his earlier commentary on Jeffers' work. Jeffers would publish poetry intermittently during the 1950s but his poetry never again attained the same degree of popularity that it had in the 1920s and the 1930s.\n\nJeffers coined the word \"inhumanism\", the belief that mankind is too self-centered and too indifferent to the \"astonishing beauty of things.\" In the famous poem \"Carmel Point,\" Jeffers called on humans to \"uncenter\" themselves. In \"The Double Axe,\" Jeffers explicitly described inhumanism as \"a shifting of emphasis and significance from man to notman; the rejection of human solipsism and recognition of the trans-human magnificence. ... This manner of thought and feeling is neither misanthropic nor pessimist. ... It offers a reasonable detachment as rule of conduct, instead of love, hate and envy ... it provides magnificence for the religious instinct, and satisfies our need to admire greatness and rejoice in beauty.\"\n\nIn \"The Loyalties of Robinson Jeffers\",the first in-depth study of Jeffers not written by one of his circle, poet and critic J. Radcliffe Squires addresses the question of a reconciliation of the beauty of the world and potential beauty in mankind: \"Jeffers has asked us to look squarely at the universe. He has told us that materialism has its message, its relevance, and its solace. These are different from the message, relevance, and solace of humanism. Humanism teaches us best why we suffer, but materialism teaches us how to suffer.\" \n\nHis poems have been translated into many languages and published all over the world. Outside of the United States he is most popular in Japan and the Czech Republic. William Everson, Edward Abbey, Robert McDowell, Gary Snyder, and Mark Jarman are just a few recent authors who have been influenced by Jeffers. Charles Bukowski remarked that Jeffers was his favorite poet. Polish poet Czesław Miłosz also took an interest in Jeffers' poetry and worked as a translator for several volumes of his poems. Jeffers also exchanged some letters with his Czech translator and popularizer, the poet Kamil Bednář. Writer Paul Mooney (1904–1939), son of American Indian authority James Mooney (1861–1921) and collaborator of travel writer Richard Halliburton (1900–1939), \"was known always to carry with him (a volume of Jeffers) as a chewer might carry a pouch of tobacco ... and, like Jeffers,\" writes Gerry Max in \"Horizon Chasers\", \"worshipped nature ... (taking) refuge (from the encroachments of civilization) in a sort of chthonian mysticism rife with Greek dramatic elements ...\"\n\nJeffers was an inspiration and friend to western U.S. photographers of the early twentieth century, including Ansel Adams, Edward Weston, and Morley Baer. In fact, the elegant book of Baer's photographs juxtaposed with Jeffers' poetry, combines the creative talents of those two residents of the Big Sur coast.\n\nAlthough Jeffers has largely been marginalized in the mainstream academic community over the last thirty years, several important contemporary literary critics, including Albert Gelpi of Stanford University, and poet, critic and NEA chairman Dana Gioia, have consistently cited Jeffers as a formidable presence in modern literature.\n\nHis poem \"The Beaks of Eagles\" was included in the track \"California Saga\" on The Beach Boys album \"Holland\" (1973).\n\nTwo lines from Jeffers' poem \"We Are Those People\" are quoted toward the end of the 2008 film \"Visioneers\".\n\nSeveral lines from Jeffers' poem \"Wise Men in Their Bad Hours\" (\"Death's a fierce meadowlark: but to die having made / Something more equal to the centuries / Than muscle and bone, is mostly to shed weakness.\") appear in Christopher McCandless' diary.\n\nRobinson Jeffers is mentioned in the 2004 film \"I Heart Huckabees\" by the character Albert Markovski played by Jason Schwartzman, when defending Jeffers as a nature writer against another character's claim that environmentalism is socialism. Markovski says, \"Henry David Thoreau, Robinson Jeffers, the National Geographic Society...all socialists?\"\n\nA passage from Jeffers' poem \"Ghost\" was read in the Ghost Adventures episode \"Tor House\", where the Ghost Adventures crew investigated Jeffers' house to see if Jeffers' spirit would appear 50 years later after his death, as was said in his poem.\n\nIn \"A Secular Age\", a critique of Western secularization, philosopher Charles Taylor presents Jeffers as an important literary example of \"immanent anti-humanism\" alongside figures such as Friedrich Nietzsche and Cormac McCarthy. Invoking (often at length) the poems \"At the Birth of an Age,\" \"Invasion,\" \"Rock and Hawk,\" \"Tamar,\" and \"The Women at Point Sur,\" Taylor sees Jeffers as encouraging human beings to embrace the beautiful cruelty of an indifferent universe.\n\nPoet Adrienne Rich quotes Jeffers's poem \"Prelude\" in her poem \"Yom Kippur 1984\"\n\nStanford University Press released a five-volume collection of the complete works of Robinson Jeffers. In an article titled, \"A Black Sheep Joins the Fold\", written upon the release of the collection in 2001, \"Stanford Magazine\" commented that it was remarkable that, due to a number of circumstances, \"there was never an authoritative, scholarly edition of California's premier bard\" until the complete works published by Stanford.\n\nIn a rare recording, Jeffers can be heard reading his \"The Day Is A Poem\" (September 19, 1939) on \"Poetry Speaks – Hear Great Poets Read Their Work from Tennyson to Plath\", Narrated by Charles Osgood (Sourcebooks, Inc., c2001), Disc 1, #41; including text, with Robert Hass on Robinson Jeffers, pp. 88–95. Jeffers was also on the cover of \"Time – The Weekly Magazine\", April 4, 1932 (pictured on p. 90. \"Poetry Speaks\").\n\n\"Jeffers Studies\", a journal of research on the poetry of Robinson Jeffers and related topics, is published semi-annually by the Robinson Jeffers Association.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "40832516", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40832516", "title": "Sexual Desire (book)", "text": "Sexual Desire (book)\n\nSexual Desire: A Philosophical Investigation, published as Sexual Desire: A Moral Philosophy of the Erotic in the United States, is a 1986 book about the philosophy of sex by the philosopher Roger Scruton, in which the author discusses sexual desire and erotic love, arguing against the idea that the former expresses the animal part of human nature while the latter is an expression of its rational side. The book was first published in the United Kingdom by Weidenfeld and Nicolson, and in the United States by Free Press.\n\nScruton draws upon both analytic philosophy and phenomenology, a philosophical movement founded by Edmund Husserl. Borrowing the term from phenomenology, he argues that sexual desire is characterised by \"intentionality\", the quality \"of pointing to, and delineating, an object of thought\". He makes the case that common experiences related to sex, such as obscenity, modesty and shame, falling in love, and jealousy, involve intentionality. He defends traditional sexual morality, but rather than basing his arguments on religion, he writes from a secular perspective, following an approach suggested by Aristotle in the \"Nicomachean Ethics\". He upholds the traditional condemnation of lust (which he defines as sexual desire \"from which the goal of erotic love has been excluded\") and perversion (which he defines as \"a diverting of the sexual impulse from its interpersonal goal\"). In his view, sexual perversion involves failure to recognise \"the personal existence of the other\", and this justifies its moral condemnation. He argues that homosexuality is a perversion, as is a form of masturbation. He argues that science cannot provide substitute for the concepts which order everyday experience and that it may potentially harm people's understanding of human sexual desire. He criticises Sigmund Freud, arguing that psychoanalytic theory unacceptably depends on metaphor and that its scientific status is questionable. He also criticises feminism and the work of the biologist Alfred Kinsey, describing it as reductive and as involving misrepresentation of sexual arousal and desire.\n\nThe book received positive reactions from some reviewers and unfavourable reactions from others. It has been called a classic work, and has been praised for providing insightful or appealing accounts of topics such as jealousy, sado-masochism, sexual arousal, love and sexual desire, for its criticism of Freud, and for its originality. A noted example of a work by a philosopher who argues that sex is morally acceptable only if it involves love and intimacy, it has been considered one of the most important works in the philosophy of sex and has influenced subsequent discussions of sexual ethics. However, many of Scruton's conclusions were controversial. \"Sexual Desire\" has been criticised for Scruton's claim that sexual desire essentially aims at an individual person, his defense of conservative moral views, his arguments against feminism, his treatment of sexual behaviours such as homosexuality and masturbation and theories such as psychoanalysis and sociobiology, his use of the concept of intentionality, his interpretation of the British political tradition, and his understanding of science. Some reviewers wrote that the book contains errors of fact, would be difficult for people who are not philosophers to read, and presented arguments that were unlikely to convince readers not already in agreement with Scruton.\n\nScruton discusses sexual desire and erotic love, and the views that philosophers have held of these topics. He argues against Plato's view that sexual desire expresses the animal part of human nature while erotic love is an expression of its rational side, and tries to provide a philosophical basis for sexual morality and to defend traditional moral views on a secular basis. He draws upon both analytic philosophy and phenomenology, despite some disagreements with its founder Edmund Husserl, and discusses the distinction between categories that involve \"functional significance\" and those that involve \"explanatory power\", respectively \"functional and natural kinds.\" He argues that science aims to discover natural kinds, since only they make it possible to explain the world; in contrast, many concepts used in everyday life are not explanatory, or at least not primarily explanatory, but rather \"divide the world in accordance with out interests\" and \"mark out possibilities of action.\" He adopts the term \"intentionality\" from phenomenology, using it to refer to the quality, contained in human consciousness, \"of pointing to, and delineating, an object of thought.\" He also makes use of the term, often used by phenomenologists, \"Lebenswelt\", or \"Lifeworld\", which refers to the world described with the \"concepts that designate the intentional objects of human experience.\"\nAccording to Scruton, science cannot provide substitutes for \"the concepts which order and direct our everyday experience\" and may potentially harm our understanding of human sexual desire. Scruton argues that philosophy and religion must help to sustain everyday concepts, such as that of the human person, when science threatens to undermine them. He attempts to \"restore the concept of sexual desire to its rightful place\" in the description of the lifeworld and show \"why a science of sex can neither displace that concept nor illuminate the human phenomenon that it describes.\" Scruton is influenced by Immanuel Kant and his \"distinction between person and thing\", although he rejects Kant's theory of the \"transcendental self\", which \"ascribes to persons a metaphysical core ... lying beyond nature and eternally free from its constraints.\" Scruton maintains that sexual experience is informed by some of the concepts which define the lifeworld, including \"the concepts of innocence and guilt, normality and perversion, sacred and profane.\" He identifies the \"three basic phenomena of human sexual feeling\" as arousal, desire, and love and its important expressions as \"glances, caresses and the act of love itself.\" In his view, sexual desire is a \"social artefact\" that must be built properly so that it can be fulfilled by \"those who experience its normal forms\", and that the \"problem of sexual desire\" is therefore ultimately \"a political problem\". He follows the example of Aristotle in the \"Nicomachean Ethics\" by moving \"from the facts of human nature to the morality which they imply.\"\n\nArousal is defined by Scruton as the state of mind in which \"the body of one person awakens to the presence or thought of another.\" He maintains that sensations only qualify as sexual pleasure when they are \"an integral part of sexual arousal.\" According to Scruton, it is arousal that transforms pleasurable sensations into sexual pleasure, which is characterised by intentionality. Scruton criticises views about sexual arousal expressed by authors such as Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, and the biologist Alfred Kinsey. He refers to the Kinsey Reports as \"exercises in reduction\" because of their representation of sexual arousal as a bodily state, common to humans and non-human animals, which \"so irritates those subject to it that they can find relief only in the sexual act\" and whose \"root phenomena\" are \"the erection of the penis or the softening of the vagina\". He maintains that Freud's theory of the erotogenic zones paradoxically presents \"the localised pleasures of the sexual act as the aim or object of desire\", which in his view ignores both \"the drama of sexual feeling\" and \"the fact of the other who is desired.\"\n\nScruton illustrates his view of the dependence of sexual pleasure and sexual arousal on the intentional object of experience with reference to the Bible's account of Jacob and Leah, and its retelling by the novelist Thomas Mann in \"Joseph and His Brothers\" (1933–1943), noting that Jacob did not \"discover attractions in Leah that he had previously overlooked\" and that \"his pleasure in her was really pleasure in Rachel, whom he wrongly thought to be the recipient of his embraces\". He credits the philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre with providing, in \"Being and Nothingness\" (1943), \"perhaps the most acute philosophical analysis of desire\", citing Sartre's metaphorical suggestion that the caress \"incarnates\" the other. He also refers to the philosopher Thomas Nagel's discussion of desire in \"Mortal Questions\" (1979), though unlike Nagel he holds that the intentionality exemplified by meaning is only sometimes, rather than always, found in glances of desire. He argues that obscenity \"involves the attempt to divorce the sexual act from its interpersonal intentionality\", or the directedness of sexual arousal. According to Scruton, the face has a key role in desire because it is \"the primary expression of consciousness, and to see \"in the face\" the object of sexual arousal is to find the focus which all attraction requires\".\n\nAccording to Scruton, sexual desire does not originate in sexual arousal or have sexual arousal as its aim. He believes that while sexual arousal may seem to support the idea that desire is \"a 'biological' fact, rooted in the life which we share with animals\", it does not do so, because it is an interpersonal response founded in an epistemic intentionality and can be experienced only by people. He argues that though non-human animals experience sexual urges, they do not experience sexual desire. He attempts to defend this conclusion against potential criticism by clarifying the ideas of the animal and the person. In his view, the concept of the person is not a qualification of the concept of the animal, but a distinct concept with a differing purpose. Scruton outlines the history of the term \"person\", noting that in the theatre a \"persona\", originally a mask, came to stand for a theatrical character. \"Persona\" was then used in a more general sense, to refer to any representation of a human being, and in Roman law came to denote the \"collection of rights and liabilities which the law courts could adjudicate, on behalf of the subject who appeared before them.\" Though he rejects the idea that the concept of legal personality can be used to distinguish what separates humans from non-human animals, he considers it relevant to understanding the concept of the person.\nScruton believes that desire is characterised by intentionality. He argues that \"desire expresses itself through patterns of deliberate activity\" but can nevertheless be understood as an expression of human mental states only if \"we recognise the central importance of the involuntary aspect of human behaviour\", giving blushing, laughter, and the erection of the penis as examples. He sees the focus of desire as embodiment, which entails finding a unity between the body and the personal identity of the desired person. He criticises what he considers a common picture of the aim of sexual desire, according to which it begins in sexual arousal and has as its objective \"pleasurable stimulus\" and orgasm. He considers Kinsey and his co-authors the \"most-simple minded\" proponents of this view, writing that they unacceptably see orgasm as the aim of desire and \"the presence of the other person as its occasion.\" He follows Sartre and Thomas Nagel in holding that the \"attempt to assimilate sexual desire to appetite misses the interpersonal component of human sexual responses.\" He argues that ordinary language shows that the object of sexual desire is the \"person himself\", and that despite the possibility of mistakes of identity, it is part of the directed character of desire that its object is a particular person.\n\nIn Scruton's view, \"true sexual desire\" has as its aim union with a \"particular person, with a particular perspective upon my actions.\" According to him, a person who feels \"randiness\" and desires sex with a particular category of person but with no specific person within that category is \"desiring to desire\" and exchanges \"the desire to desire for desire\" when he encounters a person within the relevant category. Scruton argues that common experiences related to sex, such as obscenity, modesty and shame, the meanings associated with the sexual organs, prostitution, falling in love, jealousy, Don Juanism, and sado-masochism, involve intentionality. His discussion of love is partially informed by Stendhal's views.\n\nDiscussing the \"metaphysical idea of individuality\", Scruton considers six features of interpersonal attitudes, corresponding to six distinctions: those between the universal and the particular; between the reason-based, the reason-free, and the reason-involving; between the attentive and the non-attentive; between the purposeful and the purposeless; between the transferable and the non-transferable; and between the mediate and the immediate. He describes these distinctions to make sense of \"the highly complex claim that some of our attitudes are directed towards individuals \"as\" individuals, and others towards individuals only \"as\" members of some class.\" He criticises Kant's ideas about love, desire, and morality, and the views of the philosophers Baruch Spinoza and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. Scruton writes that Spinoza created an impersonal metaphysics in which \"the 'self' and all its mysteries\" vanish, and argues that Leibniz, by trying to understand the world based on an idea of individual existence that has the self as its model, made it impossible to recognise the \"objective order into which individuals may enter as component parts.\" He advocates an understanding of individuality between these extremes. He suggests that the aim of sexual desire can be described metaphorically as the wish to \"unite you with your body\" or to \"summon your perspective into your flesh, so that it becomes identical with your flesh\". He explains that this means establishing a metaphysical \"sense of an identity\" between a person's \"unity of consciousness\" and the \"animal unity\" of their body.\n\nScruton questions the scientific basis of sociobiology and criticises what he sees as its moral implications. He considers sociobiology the \"most radical of all attempts at a science of sexual conduct\" because of its attempt to explain social phenomena in evolutionary terms by showing how they relate to the survival of the species. However, he is critical of sociobiological explanations of the behavior of both non-human animals and humans, arguing that the former risk anthropomorphism and that the latter dubiously extend explanations of the behavior of non-human animals to that of humans. He criticises the biologist E. O. Wilson for using anthropomorphic language, and for suggesting that sociobiology supports a liberalised sexual morality. However, he maintains that the criticisms directed against sociobiology do not show that it should be rejected entirely, but only that it has drawn premature conclusions. He accepts that sociobiological explanations of phenomena such as monogamy may possibly be correct, albeit in his view they remain insensitive to important distinctions and cannot lead to full understanding of human behaviour because in human life phenomena that must be understood in terms of reasons rather than causes are common. He argues that the prime mistake of sociobiology is to hold that because humans as a species have a social disposition, \"human societies will owe their ruling characteristics to genetic implantation.\" He suggests that sociobiology is incapable of taking intentional understanding into account in its theory of social behavior.\n\nDiscussing psychoanalysis, Scruton suggests that Freud had the same fundamental objective, that of creating \"a theory of human nature and human sexuality that might eventually be given a biological basis\", as that of sociobiology. He writes that Freud's presentation of his theories is \"widely admitted to be fluctuating, unsystematic and riddled with metaphor\", and that later psychoanalysts such as Melanie Klein and Wilhelm Reich, both of whom he considers to be among the \"most influential of the post-Freudian psychoanalytic writers on sex\", are vulnerable to criticisms similar to those that can be made against Freud. He maintains that Freud was \"neither an accurate observer nor a plausible theorist\" of sex, and that recognizing this is important for anyone concerned to rescue sexual morality. According to Scruton, Freud's account of sexuality is based on a metaphorical model of the human mind, the scientific value of which depends on \"whether it can be transformed into a literal, and explanatory, theory of the mind.\" Scruton criticises Freud for failing to provide a convincing theory that would explain the mind in neurophysiological terms and identify the mental forces, barriers and spaces he postulated in terms accessible to empirical investigation. He argues that Freud's model of the mind functions as a myth rather than a scientific theory, and that it is doubtful that it could expressed in literal terms and retain any explanatory power because it is only as myth that it explains the mind in terms of intentional understanding, something it would be unable to do as a scientific theory.\nScruton argues that Freud's model of the id, ego and super-ego is anthropomorphic and may also be incoherent. He provides an account and critique of the model, noting that it construes the ego as an agent that keeps unwelcome thoughts out of conscious awareness and in the unconscious. According to Scruton, the model suggests that mental states move from the unconscious into conscious awareness unless the ego acts to prevent this. He argues that since the contents of the unconscious are not observed by the ego, they are not part of it, and its consciousness and its mentality must be identical unless it is also divided into a conscious and unconscious section, opening the prospect of an infinite regress. He maintains that if it is possible to conclude that the mental states of the ego as all necessarily conscious, then it should be possible to reach the same conclusion about the mental states of the human person as a whole. In his view a truly scientific account of the mind would therefore eliminate metaphor entirely and make no reference to the unconscious mind. He further argues that even if it were possible to resolve the philosophical problems of Freudian theory it would still provide neither a correct description nor an explanation of sexual phenomena. However, he is unconvinced by the argument, put forward by the philosophers Karl Popper and Ernest Nagel, that Freudian theory implies no testable observation and therefore does not have genuine predictive power, maintaining that it has both \"theoretical terms\" and \"empirical content.\" He points to the example of Freud's theory of repression, arguing that despite being tied to metaphor it has \"strong empirical content\" and implies testable consequences. In his view, psychoanalysis is not genuinely scientific because the transition from its theoretical terms to the empirical consequences they entail involves \"ineliminable metaphor.\"\n\nIn his view, the two crucial parts of Freud's theory of the development of adult sexuality from its origins in infantile sexuality are the libido and the erotogenic zone. He argues that both are incoherent and present \"a caricature of sexual desire\": the libido is supposed to be conceived as both an instinct seeking the release of accumulated sexual tension and \"a passion\" based on a person's understanding of himself and his relations with others, and involves an incorrect comparison between the sexual drive and hunger. He argues that writers such as Reich, in \"The Function of the Orgasm\" (1942), and Norman O. Brown, in \"Life Against Death\" (1959), have illegitimately drawn moral conclusions from the theory of the libido. He argues that the theory of the libido and the theory of the erotogenic zone both require the zones to inconsistently be locations of both sexual pleasure and sexual arousal, which involves interpersonal intentionality. He argues that Freud's definitions of the erotogenic zones are tautologous. He criticises Freud for lending his authority to the idea \"that human sexuality belongs in the depths of our organic nature\" and that the human sexual impulse is amoral and \"outside the sphere of personal feeling and relation\" and held in check by shame. He argues against Freud that, \"Sexual desire is not impeded by morality, but created by it.\"\n\nScruton believes that traditional accounts of sexuality have failed to explain the place of sexual desire in love, friendship, and esteem. Following the views of Socrates, as reported in Plato's dialogue \"Symposium\" (4th century BC), he argues that it is problematic to hold that sexual desire either is part of love or that it is not part of love, since the former view suggests that erotic love cannot be a form of friendship and the latter suggests that love is never erotic. He refers to this dilemma as \"Plato's question\". He criticises Plato's ideas about love, such as his belief that desire, as a physical urge, has no place in love, and argues that erotic love is both a form of desire and a form of love. In Scruton's view, \"Plato's question\" derives its force from the fact that, \"Love implicates the whole being of the lover, and desires the whole being of the beloved\", and Platonism involves a \"misdescription of desire\" that makes it impossible to understand how desire can be an expression or a form of love. He attempts to clarify the distinction between love and friendship by providing an account of the intentional structure of the latter, and discusses different kinds of friendship, concluding that \"the friendship of esteem\" can become love and in so doing acquire its distinguishing features, but that the development of esteem into love is not inevitable and that love may also have other origins. He maintains that erotic love has a normal course that involves the lover and the beloved developing their selves through responses to each other's desires and perceptions. He also discusses the European tradition of courtly love, and criticises the idea that romantic love did not exist before the 12th century, arguing that evidence from Japanese, Persian, and classical literature shows otherwise.\n\nScruton discusses the concept of gender, and the distinction between gender and sex. He maintains that sex is \"material base\" of the \"intentional superstructure\" of gender. According to Scruton, gender incorporates, \"not only the distinct observable forms of man and woman, but also the differences in life and behaviour which cause us selectively to respond to them.\" Scruton criticises other understandings of gender, including those of feminists, writing that they have wrongly argued that \"distinctions of gender are entirely arbitrary, and may be either abolished or constructed in any way, depending on the social conventions, prejudices and ideological purpose of the person who makes them.\" He argues that feminist views often depend on untenable assumptions resembling those of Kant. He refers to such views as \"Kantian feminism\", giving Simone de Beauvoir's ideas in \"The Second Sex\" (1949) as an example. He argues that \"Kantian feminism\" wrongly maintains that \"personality is distinct from its bodily form\" and thereby ignores the fact that people are identical with their bodies, and fails to recognise that distinctions of gender are \"artificial\" only in the same sense that the human person is \"artificial\", and suggests that sociobiology supports the claim that men and women have \"distinct psychological dispositions\" deriving from the different roles of men and women in sexual reproduction.\n\nScruton defends and explicates the concept of sexual perversion, and the related idea of normality. He criticises Freud's view that sexual acts of a kind that do not normally lead to procreation should be considered perverted. He also criticises G. E. M. Anscombe's view that perversion is \"to be explained in terms of the \"animal\" process of biological reproduction\", noting that few other philosophers have found her argument satisfactory. According to Scruton, perversion involves deviations from \"the unity of animal and interpersonal relation\" that normally characterises sexual desire and detaches the sexual urge from its interpersonal intentionality. Scruton sees its \"major structural feature\" as the \"failure to recognise, in and through desire, the personal existence of the other\", which in turn is \"an affront, both to him and oneself.\" He argues that this justifies its moral condemnation.\n\nBuilding on these ideas, Scruton evaluates bestiality, necrophilia, paedophilia, sado-masochism, homosexuality, incest, fetishism and masturbation, to determine whether they can be considered perverted. He concludes that bestiality, necrophilia and paedophilia are perversions. However, he argues that sado-masochism is \"relatively normal\", while maintaining that it also has a perverted form. He compares sadism to slavery, invoking the philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel's account of the conflict between master and slave in \"The Phenomenology of Spirit\" (1807), summarising Hegel as maintaining that the \"final end of every rational being is the building of the self\", which involves recognising other people as ends in themselves. According to Scruton, Hegel maintains that all human relations involve both an element of conflict, based on desire to \"compel the other to give what is required\", and a compulsion toward agreement and \"the mutual recognition that only what is given can be genuinely received.\" Scruton argues that sado-masochism likewise involves an \"intrinsic paradox\", whereby the sadist \"wishes to possess the other, but also to be recognised by the other as a person and accepted accordingly.\" In the normal form of sado-masochism, the pain inflicted is \"incorporated into the love-play of the partners\" and the sadomasochistic impulse is \"incorporated into an interpersonal relation\", while in the perverted form, the consent of the other is irrelevant and he is reduced \"a state of servitude in which his existence as a free being is systematically negated.\" According to Scruton, masochism also has both perverted and non-perverted forms; he cites an example in which a girl's masochism formed part of \"a sincere erotic giving of herself to another.\"\n\nScruton suggests that homosexuality can be considered a perversion, arguing that it differs from heterosexuality in a way that helps to explain that traditional judgment. He suggests that the \"intentional content\" of homosexual desire may differ from that of heterosexual desire in a way that justifies the conclusion that the former has \"a distinct moral character\" and potentially \"diverges from the norm of interpersonal relations in the direction of obscenity.\" He argues that heterosexuality, unlike homosexuality, involves dealing with the different and complementary nature of the opposite sex, and that such \"opening of the self to the mystery of another gender\" is a feature of sexual maturity. He believes that male and female homosexuality differ from each other significantly because of differences between the sexual dispositions of the two sexes: men are interested in immediate sexual excitement and prone to promiscuity, while women are interested in lasting partnerships and find sexual excitement \"inseparable from the feeling of dependence\". He considers male, though not female, homosexuals prone to sexual promiscuity, and argues that this, combined with \"the natural predatoriness of the male\", constitutes the danger inherent in male homosexuality. Though basing his conclusions about homosexuality partly on Greek art and literature, he dismisses the classicist Kenneth Dover's \"Greek Homosexuality\" (1978) as \"trivialising\". He suggests that it may be proper to regard homosexuality as obscene because, \"In the heterosexual act, it might be said, I move out \"from\" my body \"towards\" the other, whose flesh is unknown to me; while in the homosexual act I remain locked within my body narcissistically contemplating in the other an excitement that is the mirror of my own.\"\n\nThough Scruton concludes that incest is not necessarily a perversion, he maintains it is nevertheless immoral. He argues that fetishism is a perversion, though a \"harmless and amusing\" one. He maintains that there are two forms of masturbation, one in which the practice \"relieves a period of sexual isolation, and is guided by a fantasy of copulation\" and the other in which it \"replaces the human encounter\", and that only the second can be considered perverted, since it diverts the sexual impulse away from interpersonal union.\n\nCombining his theory of sexual desire with a \"plausible account of moral reasoning\", Scruton tries to establish an \"intuitively persuasive sexual morality.\" He relates morality to practical reason, describing it as a \"constraint upon reasons for action\" and which is \"a normal consequence of the possession of a first-person perspective.\" He criticises Kant's attempt to base morality on the categorical imperative, considering it a failure even though it is \"the most beautiful and thorough of all the theories which try to find the basis of morality in the first-person perspective\". He proposes an alternative view inspired by Aristotle, which seeks to base \"first-person practical reason outside the immediate situation of the agent\", believing that only this approach can help to establish \"a secular morality of sexual conduct\" because unlike other secular approaches it \"gives cogency to prohibitions and privations\". He argues that the capacity for erotic love is a virtue, and that sexual virtue involves avoiding habits that impede the \"development of the sexual impulse towards love\" and acquiring dispositions that encourage that development. He considers preventing jealousy an essential moral task. He argues that because virtuous desire is \"an artefact, made possible by a process of moral education which we do not, in truth, understand in its complexity\" much of \"traditional sexual morality\" must be upheld. For Scruton, this includes the traditional condemnation of lust and perversion, the former of which he defines as sexual desire \"from which the goal of erotic love has been excluded\", and latter of which he defines as \"a diverting of the sexual impulse from its interpersonal goal\". He defends sexual fidelity and marriage, criticises promiscuity, and maintains that sexual morality inevitably has a political aspect. He criticises the philosophers Herbert Marcuse and Michel Foucault, writing that in \"The History of Sexuality\" (1976), Foucault mistakenly assumes that there could be societies in which a \"problematisation\" of the sexual did not occur. He argues against Foucault that, \"No history of thought could show the 'problematisation' of sexual experience to be peculiar to certain specific social formations: it is characteristic of personal experience generally, and therefore of every genuine social order.\"\n\n\"Sexual Desire\" was first published in the United Kingdom in 1986 by Weidenfeld and Nicolson. Subsequent British editions include those published by Phoenix Books in 1994 and Continuum in 1996. In the United States, the book was published as \"Sexual Desire: A Moral Philosophy of the Erotic\" by Free Press in 1986.\n\n\"Sexual Desire\" received positive reviews from the historian Piers Paul Read in \"The Spectator\", C. D. Keyes in \"Library Journal\", the anthropologist Richard Shweder in \"The New York Times\", and the journalist Joseph Sobran in \"National Review\", mixed reviews from John Ryle in the \"London Review of Books\", the philosopher Galen Strawson in \"The Times Literary Supplement\", and the philosopher Martha Nussbaum in \"The New York Review of Books\", and negative reviews from the critic Roz Kaveney in the \"New Statesman\", Shirley Robin Letwin in \"The American Spectator\", the philosopher Richard Rorty in \"The New Republic\", and John Weightman in \"Encounter\" magazine. The book was also reviewed by the sociologist Michael Kimmel in \"Psychology Today\", and discussed by the political commentator Andrew Sullivan in \"The New Republic\", the critic Terry Teachout in \"Commentary\" magazine, and the Christian cleric Richard John Neuhaus in \"National Review\".\n\nRead described the book as an ambitious and erudite work. He compared it to \"The Second Sex\", but found its conclusions sounder. He credited Scruton with providing unprejudiced discussions of topics such as homosexuality and bestiality, finding this important since his conclusions went against views currently accepted in western society. However, he argued that Scruton relied too much on philosophy and was overly dismissive of anthropology and psychology. He agreed with Scruton's criticism of Freud, but criticised him for neglecting the psychiatrist Carl Jung. He believed that Scruton neglected theology, questioned his claim to reach moral conclusions independently of religion, and criticised him for underestimating the importance of children in the fulfillment of love based on trust and companionship and for failing to clarify the relationship between flourishing and sexual virtue. He noted that parts of the book would be incomprehensible to many readers, but suggested that the details of Scruton's writing were more valuable than his \"general argument\".\n\nKeyes considered the book \"radical in its methods and conservative in many of its conclusions\". He credited Scruton with \"drawing from a wide range of historical and contemporary texts\", but concluded that the book would be of interest mainly to scholars and specialists in the field of the philosophy of sex. Shweder, who characterised Scruton's views as \"illiberal, antifeminist, anti-Freudian, antiliberationist, antilibertarian, and anti-free market\", described the book as \"a stunning achievement\", \"brave\", and \"deliberately provocative\". However, he noted that Scruton was not a sexologist, and wrote that his work was \"not sexy\", \"excessively illiberal\", and likely to be misinterpreted. He also considered Scruton's case that homosexuality is a perversion to be contrived. Sobran described Scruton's argument as \"learned and subtle in the extreme\", and admitted that he did not fully understand it. However, though not considering himself competent to offer a final evaluation of \"Sexual Desire\", he wrote that it \"abounds in fine observations and fascinating insights\", that \"its dozens of stimulating passages will reward any reader's effort, whether or not he accepts the argument as a whole\", and that the book was highly original.\n\nRyle wrote that while the book would not be easy for non-philosophers to read it was often enjoyable. He compared Scruton's views to Foucault's, writing that Scruton and Foucault would agree that human sexuality is unique and were both disinterested in the biological basis of sexual desire. He praised Scruton's discussions of jealousy and sado-masochism, and credited Scruton with effectively criticising sociobiology and Kinsey by demonstrating that desire \"involves a distinctively human concept of selfhood.\" He believed that Scruton's use of theological language suggested that he was covertly expressing religious views. However, while he found Scruton's view that the aim of sexual desire is to \"unite you with your body\" attractive, he questioned its accuracy. He argued that Scruton ignored the diversity of homosexual experience. He faulted Scruton for dismissing Dover's \"Greek Homosexuality\", writing that he did so without relevant credentials. He also observed that despite Scruton's discussion of topics such as Japanese court literature, the literary and philosophical references of the book were limited mainly to classical and modern European culture, and that the work was undermined by Scruton's limited use of ethnographic evidence.\n\nStrawson described the book as ambitious, interesting, and serious, and predicted that those interested in philosophizing about sex would find it impossible to ignore. However, he also believed that it was florid in style, that its level of originality was questionable, that it presented an incomplete attempt at philosophical analysis, and that most non-philosophers, and even some philosophers, would find it unreadable. He criticised Scruton for using terms such as \"rational\" and \"moral\" in a vague fashion and for \"intellectual irresponsibility\". He wrote that Scruton made misleading or incorrect statements and drew conclusions about human nature in general from his own distinctive experience. He criticised Scruton's views about jealousy, embarrassment and friendship, sexual arousal, homosexuality, women's experience, feminism, psychoanalysis, and obscenity, and argued that his outline of a \"general moral theory\" took no account of possible objections from anthropologists and historians and that Scruton presented idealised accounts of sexual desire and love. However, he expressed a more favorable view of Scruton's discussions of other topics, including nakedness, orgasm, narcissism, sociobiology, gender identity, perversion, and Platonic love. He agreed with Scruton that Plato's view that desire has no place in love should be rejected, and welcomed Scruton's defense of the claim that erotic love is a genuine possibility.\n\nNussbaum described the book as uneven in quality and argued that Scruton's work revealed his \"distaste for the flesh\", disgust for \"the sexuality of animals\", and lack of sense of fun. She was convinced by Scruton's case for the intentionality of sexual desire and credited Scruton with using it to make \"effective criticisms of reductionist pseudosciences of sex that have severed desire from its personal and subjective aspects.\" However, she wrote that Scruton unconvincingly moved from the claim that sexual desire is intentional to the proposition that it \"treats its object as irreducibly unique and particular, attending to and cherishing all of its perceptible properties\" and that \"desire’s aim is to establish union with that ineffable spirit, through contact with its embodied traces.\" She found Scruton's view that love is \"love of the other person’s entire self\" appealing but unconvincing. She found Scruton's discussions of bestiality and necrophilia disappointing, but his discussion of sado-masochism interesting. She was unconvinced by Scruton's condemnation of homosexuality and what she saw as his rejection of \"female equality\", arguing that, like his support for state religion and marriage, it did not follow in any obvious way from his philosophical reflections on sexual desire. She criticised Scruton for inconsistently trying to use sociobiology to criticise feminism, despite his own criticisms of it.\n\nIn a letter responding to Nussbaum's review, Scruton accused her of misrepresenting his views about sexual desire, love, and feminism. In response, Nussbaum wrote that \"Sexual Desire\" suffered from \"vagueness and haste about crucial distinctions, lack of clarity about argumentative structure, and the substitution of truculent rhetoric for careful inquiry.\" She also defended her interpretations and criticisms of Scruton's book, describing his philosophical arguments as interesting but his views as open to various objections.\n\nKaveney described the book as \"foggy and pompous\" and as containing \"misstatements of fact and misinterpretations of texts\". In her view, \"the only thing which redeems it is Scruton's tendency to shoot himself, and his cause, in the foot.\" She accused Scruton of being driven by spite toward \"lives he does not understand and wishes to remould.\" Letwin found Scruton's discussions of personhood and intentionality obscure. She rejected his view that the unity of an aesthetic object is imposed by the observer. She compared Scruton's conception of erotic love to Stendhal's, finding its only novel feature to be Scruton's refusal to accept that sexuality and morality cannot be reconciled. Though agreeing with Scruton's call for \"sexual integrity\", she criticised him for failing to support it convincingly and for moving from \"saying that the illusion of a person is the object of sexual desire to the conclusion that this illusion \"ought to be\" what we seek\". She further argued that, despite his claims, Scruton was \"violating traditional morality\" rather than defending it. She also found his view of marriage inconsistent, and believed that he failed to take sufficient interest in religion and that his conclusions about politics were misleading. She questioned his claim to be a conservative, arguing that his beliefs conflicted with the English moral and political tradition, that he misinterpreted Aristotle, and that conservatives should reject his work.\n\nRorty considered the book less \"interesting as it might have been\" because of Scruton's refusal \"to take the competition seriously\", writing that Scruton discussed Freud alongside Kinsey and sociobiology and dismissed him in a condescending fashion. He also criticised Scruton's treatment of Foucault and feminism. He argued that Scruton was misled by his belief that as a philosopher he had \"the methodological high ground\", questioned whether it was possible to use philosophy to determine the nature of sexual desire, and suggested that Scruton's account of desire was overly technical and that his book was too long. He also questioned whether Scruton's analysis of sexual desire helped him to make a moral argument about it, and argued that Scruton was wrong to believe that ever since Plato sexual desire had wrongly been assigned to the \"animal side of human nature.\" Though considering some of Scruton's observations about sex \"brilliant\", he criticised Scruton's treatment of masturbation and homosexuality. He concluded that, \"The later chapters of the book partly make up for the almost unreadable, and specifically philosophical, earlier chapters. But Scruton has written better books, and doubtless will again.\"\n\nWeightman wrote that while he was initially \"captivated\" by Scruton's work, he came to find it disappointing. He believed that Scruton wrote insightfully about subjects such as \"the importance of the face in human sex, the psychology of fashion, and the symbolism of the Incarnation\", and rightly skeptical of Freudian views. Nevertheless, he found \"Sexual Desire\" as a whole confused and unsatisfactory. He believed that Scruton, despite his avoidance of religious commitment, made dogmatic and quasi-religious claims about the nature of personal identity. He also questioned the accuracy of Scruton's ideas about sexual desire, writing that Scruton defined \"desire as he thinks it should ideally be, not as it very commonly is\", and presented \"very personal quirks with a rhetorical vigour that gives them a false air of universal truth.\" He described Scruton's discussion of the morality of homosexuality as \"unexpectedly tentative\" and unhelpful and his discussion of the politics of sex as \"astonishingly simplistic and moralising\".\n\nSullivan wrote that the book, like Scruton's previous work, expressed its author's wish to make conservatism \"a sexy research topic\" and \"reclaim lost intellectual ground by staging terror strikes into the heart of the enemy camp and then retreating.\" He credited Scruton with showing how \"involuntary actions, such as a blush, a glance, or an erection, can be the most powerful signs of an acutely voluntary desire\" and explaining \"sexual hunger as an urge to enter conversation, rather than to assuage appetite, and of orgasm as an interruption of congress rather than its end\". He complimented Scruton for his \"defense of pain in sex\", his analysis of shame and \"the relationship of love to esteem\" and \"the uncontractual nature of marriage\", noting that they were insights that might not be expected from a conventional political conservative. However, he criticised Scruton's treatment of homosexuality, describing his arguments about it as contrived. He also criticised Scruton's lack of sympathy for Freud and failure to appreciate that \"Victorian virtues\" could \"destroy the sexual virtue of countless people\". He believed that the credibility of Scruton's arguments about sexual morality was undermined by his refusal to base them on \"religious revelation or natural law\". He questioned the merits of Scruton's use of phenomenology, and suggested that Scruton was guilty of the \"cynical use of philosophy to support a particular political structure.\"\n\nTeachout praised the book as \"a serious discussion of conservative sexual ideology\". Neuhaus described the book as \"remarkable\", but noted that Scruton's project of making a secular case for traditional sexual ethics was not easy.\n\n\"Sexual Desire\" was discussed by Nussbaum in \"The New Republic\", Michael Tanner in \"Literary Review\", and the radical feminist Julie Bindel in \"Standpoint\" magazine.\n\nNussbaum credited Scruton with popularising a view of sexual attraction according to which, \"Really valuable sexual passion ... requires qualitative differences between the parties\". She criticised Scruton for applying his thesis inconsistently, writing that he applied it to sexual orientation but not to romances between people of different ages or backgrounds. Nussbaum wrote that it was unclear how his argument about similarity could be assessed.\n\nTanner described \"Sexual Desire\" as Scruton's \"magnum opus\". Bindel called the book a classic work.\n\n\"Sexual Desire\" received positive reviews from the political scientist Mark Lilla in \"The Public Interest\", the philosopher Norman P. Barry in the \"Journal of Applied Philosophy\", and the philosopher Anthony O'Hear in \"Mind\", a mixed review from the political theorist Carole Pateman in \"Ethics\", and negative reviews from David A. J. Richards in \"Constitutional Commentary\", Herbert McArthur in \"Metaphilosophy\", and Edward Johnson in \"Philosophy of the Social Sciences\". It was also discussed by Michael-Roy Kingham in \"The Sociological Review\", J. Martin Stafford in the \"Journal of Applied Philosophy\" and \"Studies in Philosophy and Education\", Alan Singer in \"SubStance\", and the philosopher Alan Soble in the \"Journal of Sex Research\".\n\nLilla credited Scruton with being the first author to provide a detailed examination of sexual morality written from a secular conservative viewpoint, with making effective criticisms of \"liberal morality\" and its psychological basis, and with making sense of the widespread revulsion for phenomena such as prostitution, pornography, and incest. He described \"Sexual Desire\" as \"a permanent contribution to conservative thought\". However, he considered the work difficult and open to possible misunderstanding. He considered Scruton's approach to moral issues more interesting than his conclusions, which he found largely unsurprising. He suggested that Scruton's work was sufficiently different from philosophy as usually practiced that it could be considered instead a work of \"moral psychology\", and that Scruton's use of phenomenology to discuss sexual experience was both simpler and more compelling than Husserl's work. He endorsed Scruton's view that sexual desire is both \"intentional and interpersonal\" and that it arises \"within the mores and institutions also constructed through human intention\", and praised Scruton discussions of \"the smile and the caress, shame and jealousy\" and the moral relevance of gender, but criticised his treatment of homosexuality. He complimented Scruton for his criticism of Freud, writing that his discussion of metapsychology accomplished more than that of the philosopher Adolf Grünbaum, although he noted that Scruton's failed to consider \"Freud's own moral project, and how it might compare with Scruton's.\" He also believed that, because Scruton rejected Freud's metapsychology, Scruton created a mistaken impression \"that we bear moral blame for our sexual incapacities as well as our chosen perversions.\" He faulted Scruton's proposals for moral education, suggesting that underlying them \"there lurks an ineradicable Freudianism that still fears being overwhelmed by wild, untamed desire.\"\n\nBarry described the book as \"profound and penetrating\" and \"intellectually exciting and beautifully written\". He considered it comparable to Alfred Schütz's \"The Phenomenology of the Social World\". He praised Scruton's discussions of sexual desire and sexual arousal, considering Scruton correct to stress that orgasm is not the purpose of sexual desire and to stress \"the role of the face in sexual desire\", believing that Scruton helped to show that arousal is not only a biological response to another person but has \"cognitive significance\". He also credited Scruton with showing that the \"ideal of embodiment\" finds its \"truest expression in erotic love\" and providing a beautiful description of \"the agony of sexual jealousy\". However, he expressed dissatisfaction with Scruton's discussion of the politics of sex and skepticism about whether Scruton had succeeded in refuting libertarian views of sexual morality, suggesting that Scruton's Aristotelian view of sexual morality could be compared to that of Ayn Rand. He criticised Scruton for attempting to \"view the metaphysically sanitised conception of sexual desire from a specific political perspective.\" He agreed with Scruton that \"the cultivation of an appropriate sexual morality is an essential part of the process of self-realisation\" and that this requires a public set of rules, but disputed Scruton's \"Hegelian assertion that such a desirable public morality cannot be sustained by the spontaneous development of social institutions\", believing that Scruton arbitrarily rejected \"the idea that the moral integrity of marriage can be sustained by contract alone.\" Against Scruton, Barry argued that the state \"has destroyed that morality which Scruton is so anxious to preserve\" by prescribing a standard form of the marriage contract.\n\nO'Hear credited Scruton with usefully illustrating his thesis that human sexual relations in general, and sexual arousal and desire in particular, are characterised by intentionality with reference to Mann's novel \"Joseph and His Brothers\" (1933–1943), and with using the thesis to make \"highly effective criticisms of both Freud and of Kinsey.\" He described Scruton's argument that one of the roots of feminist thought is the \"Kantian approach to the human person as something essentially disembodied\" as interesting. Pateman wrote that there is much to be learned from Scruton's account of sexual desire, including his discussions of arousal, the object of desire, the meaning of the sexual organs, normality, and sexual phenomena such as sado-masochism and jealousy, but that his book was nevertheless \"deeply flawed.\" Though she found Scruton's account of desire appealing, she did not consider it a description \"of the structure of our existing sexual lives.\" She criticised Scruton for his failure to present evidence about \"actual relations between women and men\", for presenting a model of the self that remained abstracted from the body, for discussing Freud without mentioning that \"an explanation of how masculinity and femininity are constructed is central to Freud's work\", for ignoring the perpsective of women, for his treatment of prostitution, and for including numerous untranslated quotations. She found Scruton's comments about women full of \"conventional banalities\" and sometimes \"silly\", and argued that it was possible to accept much of Scruton's account of desire without accepting his conservative moral and political conclusions, which she described as \"patriarchal\". She also suggested that \"Sexual Desire\" \"could profitably have been much shorter.\"\n\nRichards considered Scruton's attempt to defend traditional sexual morality open to question and believed it had only limited connection to Scruton's philosophy of the erotic. He found the book dogmatic and wrote that Scruton's account of erotic experience and human sexuality added little to that of Thomas Nagel. He criticised the idea that \"integrity of sexual experience requires the interpersonal intentionality\" emphasised by Scruton. He also criticised Scruton for defining perversion in a way that made it include anything Scruton considered morally unacceptable, such as masturbation. He believed that Scruton misunderstood the work of Freud and Kinsey, falsely attributing to them a \"depersonalization of sexual experience\", presented an oversimplified view of the British political tradition, offered arguments that were unlikely to convince those not already in agreement with him, and presented \"a highly personal profession of faith in traditional heterosexuality.\" He faulted Scruton's criticism of feminism, as well as Scruton's discussion of homosexuality, writing that it ignored the role of differences between individuals in sexual attraction and love and that Scruton's emphasis on the sex organs was suggestive of biological determinism.\n\nMcArthur criticised Scruton's understanding of science, describing it as \"rather limiting\". He suggested that Scruton had a conception of science that was \"based on the crudest of physical models\" and was unable to \"comprehend the great complexities of biological systems.\" He considered it inconsistent of Scruton to criticise Freud for using metaphor while doing so himself, and also criticised Scruton for stereotyping men as having a tendency to sexual promiscuity and women as finding sexual excitement \"inseparable from the feeling of dependence\" and for ignoring \"centuries of crime and injustice based on sex\". He charged Scruton with distorting Wilson's views by quoting him out of context. He believed that Scruton's \"exaggerated\" view of responsibility created philosophical difficulties for his understanding of sexual desire. He questioned whether the concept of intentionality was useful for \"a practical morality of sexual desire\", and argued that if all significant human acts, whether voluntary or involuntary, were evidence of intentionality, then the concept itself became \"empty\" and was not necessarily more useful than an emphasis on \"will-power\". He argued that Scruton had not achieved an advance over traditional philosophical views, such as those of Plato and Aristotle. He concluded that because Scruton condemned the scientific study of human sexuality and failed to address fundamental questions about traditional sexual morality, \"Sexual Desire\" was \"more rhetoric than philosophy.\" He predicted that it would \"encourage the right and enrage the left\", but that it would \"change no minds.\"\n\nJohnson considered Scruton's efforts at \"baiting liberals\", and his \"theme of the devaluation of claims to first-person epistemic authority\", familiar from his earlier work. He wrote that Scruton's view that perversion is a form of depersonalization required constant readjustment. He argued that it was hard to specify exactly what recognizing someone as a person requires, and that Scruton's reinterpretation of Kantian ideas was of little help. He believed that Scruton's account of perversion was most convincing in the cases of bestiality, necrophilia, and paedophilia, but described Scruton's distinction between normal and perverted forms of sado-masochism as surprising. He considered Scruton's account of sexual relations between the sexes interesting but debatable, suggesting that what Scruton saw as normal might be part of a \"patriarchal heritage\". He criticised Scruton's arguments about gender. He also suggested that Scruton's concern with \"clarity of feeling and scrutability of desire\" were primary motives behind many of his arguments. He dismissed Scruton's arguments about homosexuality. He found Scruton's descriptions of \"male and female desire\" to be based on stereotypes, and criticised Scruton's treatment of feminism, as well as his accounts of sexual arousal and desire. He questioned the usefulness of Scruton's view that \"the metaphysical self is a transcendental illusion, albeit one we cannot do without\" for understanding desire, as well whether Scruton's account of desire supported Scruton's moral and political views, and the overall coherence of Scruton's philosophical views, which combined Aristotelian with Kantian ideas. He also criticised Scruton's discussions of masturbation, sexual fantasy, and fetishism, and suggested that Scruton was prudish.\n\nKingham compared \"Sexual Desire\" to the sociologist Jeffrey Weeks's \"Sexuality and Its Discontents\" (1985), writing that while Scruton's conclusions differed from those of Weeks, his book addressed the same range of issues and was similar in structure and content. He also compared Scruton's work to that of the critic F. R. Leavis. Stafford, writing in the \"Journal of Applied Philosophy\", criticised \"Sexual Desire\", arguing that Scruton's proposal that moral education guide students toward a state in which sexuality is integrated within a life of personal affection and responsibility is inconsistent with his views on homosexuality. According to Stafford, Scruton was invited by the \"Journal of Applied Philosophy\" to respond, but declined to do so. Writing in \"Studies in Philosophy and Education\", Stafford again criticised Scruton, arguing that Scruton's view that children should be encouraged to feel revulsion for homosexuality is inconsistent with the ideas expressed in \"Sexual Desire\". He noted that the question of why homosexuality exists could potentially be answered through a sociobiological explanation of the kind that Scruton might accept. Stafford endorsed Scruton's view that a proper sexual relationship involves interpersonal intentionality, and argued that Scruton's admission that this is possible in homosexual and as well as heterosexual relationships should have led him to oppose discrimination against homosexuals. Singer credited Scruton with succinctly discussing the problems involved in thinking about sexual activity and with showing that sexual desire involves complexity of thought. Soble described the book as \"erudite and philosophically elegant\", and noted that despite a \"social climate already highly sensitive to issues surrounding sexual orientation\", Scruton was \"not afraid to doubt the normality, morality, and social effects of homosexuality.\" He observed that Scruton's contrast between sex and love was a \"standard\" part of traditionalism.\n\nRobert Brown observed in \"Analyzing Love\" (1987) that while some of his conclusions about topics such as moral theory, love and sex were similar to Scruton's, he reached them by \"independent routes that, if pursued further, would diverge toward disparate outcomes.\" He considered the points raised in \"Sexual Desire\" \"important, interesting, and also highly contentious\". The philosopher Michael Ruse argued in \"\" (1988) that Scruton's critique of Freud is weak and unconvincing. He considered Scruton's view that genuine science does not involve metaphor outdated, as philosophers and historians have shown that metaphor is common in science, in fields as diverse as physics and sociology. He also wrote that Scruton's criticism of sociobiology suggests that he falsely understands rationality as a \"beyond-biology phenomenon\". The classicist David M. Halperin argued in \"One Hundred Years of Homosexuality\" (1990) that Scruton's textual practice of retaining the masculine pronoun for both the subject and object of desire helped illustrate the philosopher and psychoanalyst Luce Irigaray's concept of \"hom(m)osexualité\". Scruton, writing in \"Sexual morality and the liberal consensus\", an essay included in \"The Philosopher on Dover Beach\" (1990), drew on his arguments in \"Sexual Desire\" in the course of seeking to justify revulsion for homosexuality.\n\nNorman O. Brown wrote in \"Apocalypse and/or Metamorphosis\" (1991) that Scruton was correct to identify Spinoza as his philosophical antagonist. He cited Scruton's ideas as an example of the way in which the \"popular mythology\" of individual love depends on the idea of \"the individual self, soul, or person as a substantial reality\". The social theorist Jonathan Dollimore interpreted Scruton as basing his sexual ethic on the Hegelian proposition that the \"final end of every rational being is the building of the self\" in \"Sexual Dissidence\" (1991). He wrote that Scruton sees homosexuality as a perversion and argued that Scruton's philosophy of sex is open to many objections. He argued that by \"privileging sexual difference\", Scruton is engaging in \"the modern intensification of sexuality which in other ways he might regard as contributing to a legitimation of the perversions he repudiates.\" He found Scruton's writing jargon-ridden, believing that its Hegelian framework bestows \"a spurious profundity on a normative sexual politics\" that is \"timid, conservative, and deeply ignorant.\" He also suggested that, notwithstanding Scruton's attack on psychoanalysis, his defense of sexual difference is indebted to psychoanalytic theory.\n\nRaymond A. Belliotti cited \"Sexual Desire\" as a notable example of a work by a philosopher who argues that sex is morally permissible only if it involves love and intimacy in the anthology \"A Companion to Ethics\" (1991). He compared the work to Vincent Punzo's \"Reflective Naturalism\" (1969). The economist Richard Posner, in \"Sex and Reason\" (1992), compared \"Sexual Desire\" to Anscombe's defense of Pope Paul VI's encyclical \"Humanae vitae\" (1968). He noted that they both sought to free Christian sexual morality from inessential details such as \"making sexual pleasure problematic even in marriage\". He argued that Scruton does not provide any adequate reason for viewing homosexuality as immoral, although he granted that Scruton might be correct that, \"the fact that a male homosexual's preferred sex partner is another man reduces the psychological distance between the partners to the point of making the relationship narcissistic, almost masturbatory.\" He compared Scruton's views about the narcissistic character of homosexuality to those of Freud. Dover observed in \"Marginal Comment\" (1994) that he was unconcerned by Scruton's dismissal of \"Greek Homosexuality\", explaining that despite agreeing with part of Scruton's analysis of sexual emotion, his work has a different focus. The philosopher Christopher Janaway identified \"Sexual Desire\" as one of several works in which Scruton challenges the conventional boundaries of analytic philosophy in \"The Oxford Companion to Philosophy\" (1995).\n\nNussbaum credited Scruton with providing an interesting argument against gay rights in the anthology \"The Liberation Debate: Rights at Issue\" (1996). She noted that Scruton's argument was \"expressed with a tentativeness and a lack of venom rare in these matters.\" However, she criticised it on several grounds, writing that Scruton used the unclear notion of \"gender\" rather than the clearer notion of biological sex, and suggesting that if one accepts Scruton's view that having sex with a person of the same gender is superficial in comparison to having sex with a person of the opposite gender because of one's greater familiarity with one's own gender, then \"any relationship in which a barrier of experiential difference is crossed\" should have superior moral value. Nussbaum maintained in the third edition of the anthology \"The Philosophy of Sex\" (1997) that Scruton's work advances the understanding of sexual objectification and provides \"the most interesting philosophical attempt as yet to work through the moral issues involved in our treatment of persons as sex partners.\" Soble, in the same work, criticised Scruton's treatment of masturbation and described his judgment that all masturbation is \"obscene\" as \"silly\".\n\n\"Sexual Desire\" was cited in the anthology \"Unauthorized Freud\" (1998), edited by the critic Frederick Crews.\n\nThe philosopher James Giles argued in \"The Nature of Sexual Desire\" (2003) that Scruton is mistaken to think that sexual desire essentially aims at an individual person, since it can be desire simply for sexual activity. Scruton stated in his memoir \"Gentle Regrets\" (2005) that the philosopher A. J. Ayer dismissed \"Sexual Desire\" as \"silly\". Describing Ayer's comment as part of a pattern of negative responses to his work, he replied that he considers \"Sexual Desire\" cogent and an answer to Foucault's \"mendacious\" \"The History of Sexuality\" (1976). Stafford argued in the second volume of \"Sex from Plato to Paglia\" (2005) that Scruton's essay \"Sexual morality and the liberal consensus\" (1989), in which Scruton argued that children should be encouraged to feel revulsion for homosexuality, was an attempt by Scruton to prevent his admission that homosexual desire is spontaneous and not necessarily perverted from being seen as supporting the positive treatment of homosexuality by moral educators. Christopher Hamilton called \"Sexual Desire\" \"the most interesting and insightful philosophical account of sexual desire\" produced within analytic philosophy in the fifth edition of \"The Philosophy of Sex\" (2008).\n\nThe philosopher Mark Dooley called \"Sexual Desire\" \"magisterial\" in \"Roger Scruton: The Philosopher on Dover Beach\" (2009). He observed that Scruton's objective is to show that sexual desire fundamentally enriches a person's experience of the sacred. Dooley stated in his introduction to \"The Roger Scruton Reader\" (2011) that \"Sexual Desire\" is often considered Scruton's \"magnum opus\". Anne Barnhill described \"Sexual Desire\" as, \"One of the most interesting philosophical accounts of sexual ethics\" but also \"one of the most frustratingly anti-feminist\" in the anthology \"Out from the Shadows: Analytical Feminist Contributions to Traditional Philosophy\" (2012). She adopted Scruton work on sexual ethics as a model despite disagreeing with most of Scruton's conclusions about gender. Michael Plaxton described \"Sexual Desire\" as important in \"Implied Consent and Sexual Assault\" (2015), though he noted that Scruton's conclusions about topics such as homosexuality and the role of women in society are controversial. He drew on Scruton's work in his own discussion of sexual ethics despite not accepting some of Scruton's views.\n\nScruton, interviewed by Dooley in \"Conversations with Roger Scruton\" (2016), attributed his interest in writing \"Sexual Desire\" to having lived through the sexual revolution and experiencing a need to explain why the view of sex that he observed at the time was \"naïve and destructive.\" He commented that he considered the book far too long and that if he were writing it again, he would \"write it at half the length.\" He suggested that the book's essential ideas were summarised in a single chapter of his work \"Death-Devoted Heart: Sex and the Sacred in Wagner's Tristan und Isolde\" (2003). He noted that the book \"upset many advocates of sexual liberation, who saw it as a kind of assault\", adding that he had not expected that it would change people's views. Dooley suggested the book represents the first time Scruton made use of concepts, such as intentionality, the lifeworld, the transcendental, and the sacred, that later became central to his philosophical work, though Scruton noted that his interest in intentionality predated the book. Scruton observed in the anthology \"The Religious Philosophy of Roger Scruton\" (2017) that his views on the philosophy of sex had become gradually clearer to him after the publication of \"Sexual Desire\", and that he had moved \"away from the abstract theory of intentionality towards more concrete representations of our interpersonal being.\"\n\nScruton, in an interview with the journalist Mick Hume published in \"Spiked\" magazine in 2015, commented that it had become more dangerous to express the views about homosexuality that he put forward in \"Sexual Desire\". According to Lily Pickard, writing in \"The Independent\", officers at the University of Bristol Students' Union sought to No Platform Scruton in 2016 for comments he \"made over same-sex marriage\" in \"Sexual Desire\" and \"Sexual morality and the liberal consensus\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "45943", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45943", "title": "Swastika", "text": "Swastika\n\nThe swastika (as a character 卐 or 卍) is a geometrical figure and an ancient religious icon in the cultures of Eurasia, used as a symbol of divinity and spirituality in Indian religions. In the Western world, it was a symbol of auspiciousness and good luck until the 1930s, when it became a feature of Nazi symbolism as an emblem of Aryan race identity and, as a result, was stigmatized by association with ideas of racism and antisemitism.\n\nThe name \"swastika\" comes from Sanskrit (Devanagari: ) meaning \"conducive to well being or auspicious\". In Hinduism, the clockwise symbol is called \"swastika\", symbolizing surya (sun), prosperity and good luck, while the counterclockwise symbol is called \"sauvastika\", symbolizing night or tantric aspects of Kali. In Jainism, a swastika is the symbol for Suparshvanatha—the seventh of 24 Tirthankaras (spiritual teachers and saviours), while in Buddhism it symbolizes the auspicious footprints of the Buddha.\nThe swastika is an icon widely found in human history and the modern world. In various forms it is alternatively known in various European languages as the Hakenkreuz, gammadion, cross cramponnée, croix gammée, fylfot or tetraskelion and in East Asia as the wàn 卐/卍/萬, meaning \"all things\", and the manji. A swastika generally takes the form of a cross whose arms are of equal length and perpendicular to the adjacent arms, each bent midway at a right angle. It is found in the archeological remains of the Indus Valley Civilization and Mesopotamia as well as in early Byzantine and Christian artwork.\n\nThe swastika was adopted by several organizations in pre–World War I Europe and later, and most notably, by the Nazi Party and Nazi Germany prior to World War II. It was used by the Nazi Party to symbolize German nationalistic pride. To Jews and the enemies of Nazi Germany, it became a symbol of antisemitism and terror. In many Western countries, the swastika is viewed as a symbol of racial supremacy and intimidation because of its association with Nazism. The reverence for the \"swastika\" symbol in Asian cultures, in contrast to the stigma in the West, has led to misinterpretations and misunderstandings.\n\nThe word \"swastika\" has been used in the Indian subcontinent and the middle east since 500 BC. Its appearance in English is more recent. In the 1870s, replacing \"gammadion\", from Greek . It is alternatively spelled in contemporary texts as \"svastika\", while in the 19th- and early 20th-century, alternate spellings such as \"suastika\" were occasionally used. It was derived from the Sanskrit term (Devanagari: ), which transliterates to \"\" under the commonly used IAST transliteration system, but is pronounced closer to \"swastika\" when letters are used with their English values. The first attested use of the word swastika in a European text is found in 1871 with the publications of Heinrich Schliemann, who while crudely digging the Hisarlik mound near the Aegean Sea coast, for the lost history of Troy (Trojan war), discovered over 1,800 ancient samples of the swastika symbol and its variants. Schliemann linked his findings to the Sanskrit \"swastika\".\n\nThe word \"swastika\" derives from the Sanskrit root \"swasti\", which is composed of \"su,\" (\"good, well\") and \"asti\" (\"it is, there is\"). The word \"swasti\" occurs frequently in the Vedas, as well as in classical literature, meaning ‘health luck, success, prosperity\", and was commonly used a greeting The final ‘ka’ is a common suffix with same meaning as the English suffix ‘like’, so swastika means \"associated with well-being\". According to Monier-Williams, a majority of scholars consider it a solar symbol.\n\nThe sign implies something fortunate, lucky or auspicious, and when applied to entrances, doors, mandalas or object it denotes or reminds of auspiciousness or well-being.\n\nThe earliest known textual use of the word \"swastika\" is in Panini's Ashtadhyayi, which uses it to explain one of the Sanskrit grammar rules, in the context of a type of identifying mark on a cow's ear. Most scholarship suggests Panini lived in or before mid 4th-century BCE, possibly in 6th or 5th century BCE.\n\nOther names for the symbol include:\n\nAll swastikas are bent crosses based on a chiral symmetry—but they appear with different geometric details: as compact crosses with short legs, as crosses with large arms and as motifs in a pattern of unbroken lines. One distinct representation of a swastika, as a double swastika or swastika made of squares, appears in a Nepalese silver mohar coin of 1685, kingdom of Patan (NS 805) KM# 337.\n\nChirality describes an absence of reflective symmetry, with the existence of two versions that are mirror images of each other. The mirror-image forms are typically described as:\nThe left-facing version is distinguished in some traditions and languages as a distinct symbol from the right-facing and is called the \"sauwastika\".\n\nThe compact swastika can be seen as a chiral irregular icosagon (20-sided polygon) with fourfold (90°) rotational symmetry. Such a swastika proportioned on a 5 × 5 square grid and with the broken portions of its legs shortened by one unit can tile the plane by translation alone. The Nazi \"Hakenkreuz\" used a 5 × 5 diagonal grid, but with the legs unshortened.\n\nThe sauwastika were adopted as a standard character in Chinese, \"\" () and as such entered various other East Asian languages, including Chinese script. In Japanese the symbol is called or .\n\nThe sauwastika is included in the Unicode character sets of two languages. In the Chinese block it is U+534D 卍 (left-facing) and U+5350 for the swastika 卐 (right-facing); The latter has a mapping in the original Big5 character set, but the former does not (although it is in Big5+). In Unicode 5.2, two swastika symbols and two sauwastikas were added to the Tibetan block: swastika , , and sauwastikas , .\n\nEuropean hypotheses of the swastika are often treated in conjunction with cross symbols in general, such as the sun cross of Bronze Age religion. Beyond its certain presence in the \"proto-writing\" symbol systems, such as the Vinca script, which appeared during the Neolithic.\nAccording to René Guénon, the swastika represents the north pole, and the rotational movement around a centre or immutable axis (\"axis mundi\"), and only secondly it represents the Sun as a reflected function of the north pole. As such it is a symbol of life, of the vivifying role of the supreme principle of the universe, the absolute God, in relation to the cosmic order. It represents the activity (the Hellenic \"Logos\", the Hindu \"Aum\", the Chinese \"Taiyi\", \"Great One\") of the principle of the universe in the formation of the world. According to Guénon, the swastika in its polar value has the same meaning of the yin and yang symbol of the Chinese tradition, and of other traditional symbols of the working of the universe, including the letters Γ (gamma) and G, symbolizing the Great Architect of the Universe of Freemasonic thought.\n\nAccording to the scholar Reza Assasi, the swastika represents the north ecliptic north pole centred in ζ Draconis, with the constellation Draco as one of its beams. He argues that this symbol was later attested as the four-horse chariot of Mithra in ancient Iranian culture. They believed the cosmos was pulled by four heavenly horses who revolved around a fixed centre in a clockwise direction. He suggests that this notion later flourished in Roman Mithraism, as the symbol appears in Mithraic iconography and astronomical representations.\n\nAccording to the Russan archaeologist Gennady Zdanovich, who studied some of the oldest examples of the symbol in Sintashta culture, the swastika symbolizes the universe, representing the spinning constellations of the celestial north pole centred in α Ursae Minoris, specifically the Little and Big Dipper (or Chariots), or Ursa Minor and Ursa Major. Likewise, according to René Guénon the swastika is drawn by visualising the Big Dipper/Great Bear in the four phases of revolution around the pole star.\n\nCarl Sagan in his book \"Comet\" (1985) reproduces a Han-dynasty Chinese manuscript (the \"Book of Silk\", 2nd century BCE) that shows comet tail varieties: most are variations on simple comet tails, but the last shows the comet nucleus with four bent arms extending from it, recalling a swastika. Sagan suggests that in antiquity a comet could have approached so close to Earth that the jets of gas streaming from it, bent by the comet's rotation, became visible, leading to the adoption of the swastika as a symbol across the world.\n\nBob Kobres in his 1992 paper \"Comets and the Bronze Age Collapse\" contends that the swastika-like comet on the Han-dynasty silk comet manuscript was labeled a \"long tailed pheasant star\" (\"dixing\") because of its resemblance to a bird's foot or footprint, the latter comparison also being drawn by J.F.K. Hewitt's observation on page 145 of \"Primitive Traditional History: vol. 1\". as well as an article concerning carpet decoration in \"Good Housekeeping\". Kobres goes on to suggest an association of mythological birds and comets also outside China.\n\nAccording to Mukti Jain, the symbol is part of \"an intricate meander pattern of joined up swastikas\" found on a late paleolithic figurine of a bird, carved from mammoth ivory, found in Mezine, Ukraine and dated to 15,000 years old. These engraved objects were found near phallic objects, which states Jain may support the idea that the meandering pattern of swastika was a fertility symbol. However it has also been suggested that this swastika may be a stylized picture of a stork in flight and not the true swastika that is in use today.\n\nIn England, neolithic or Bronze Age stone carvings of the symbol have been found on Ilkley Moor, such as the Swastika Stone.\n\nMirror-image swastikas (clockwise and anti-clockwise) have been found on ceramic pottery in the Devetashka cave, Bulgaria, dated to 6,000 BCE.\n\nSome of the earliest archaeological evidence of the swastika in the Indian subcontinent can be dated to 3,000 BCE. Investigators have also found seals with \"mature and geometrically ordered\" swastikas that date to before the Indus Valley Civilisation (3300–1300 BCE). Their efforts have traced references to swastikas in the \"Vedas\" at about that time. The investigators put forth the theory that the swastika moved westward from India to Finland, Scandinavia, the British Highlands and other parts of Europe.\n\nSwastikas have also been found on pottery in archaeological digs in Africa, in the area of Kush and on pottery at the Jebel Barkal temples, in Iron Age designs of the northern Caucasus (Koban culture), and in Neolithic China in the Majiabang,Majiayao, Dawenkou and Xiaoheyan cultures.\n\nOther Iron Age attestations of the swastika can be associated with Indo-European cultures such as the Illyrians, Indo-Iranians, Celts, Greeks, Germanic peoples and Slavs. In Sintashta culture's \"Country of Towns\", ancient Indo-European settlements in southern Russia, it has been found a great concentration of some of the oldest swastika patterns.\n\nThe swastika is also seen in Egypt during the Coptic period. Textile number T.231-1923 held at the V&A Museum in London includes small swastikas in its design. This piece was found at Qau-el-Kebir, near Asyut, and is dated between AD 300 and 600.\n\nThe \"Tierwirbel\" (the German for \"animal whorl\" or \"whirl of animals\") is a characteristic motif in Bronze Age Central Asia, the Eurasian Steppe, and later also in Iron Age Scythian and European (Baltic and Germanic) culture, showing rotational symmetric arrangement of an animal motif, often four birds' heads. Even wider diffusion of this \"Asiatic\" theme has been proposed, to the Pacific and even North America (especially Moundville).\n\nIn Asia, the swastika symbol first appears in the archaeological record around 3000 BCE in the Indus Valley Civilization. It also appears in the Bronze and Iron Age cultures around the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. In all these cultures the swastika symbol does not appear to occupy any marked position or significance, but appears as just one form of a series of similar symbols of varying complexity. In the Zoroastrian religion of Persia, the swastika was a symbol of the revolving sun, infinity, or continuing creation. It is one of the most common symbols on Mesopotamian coins.\n\nThe icon has been of spiritual significance to Indian religions such as Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. The use of the swastika by the Bön faith of Tibet, as well as Chinese Taoism, can also be traced to Buddhist influence. In Thailand, the word \"Sawaddi\" is normally used as a greeting that simply means \"hello\"; Sawaddi-ka (feminine) and Sawaddi-krup (masculine). \"Sawaddi\" derives from the Sanskrit word \"swasti\" and its meaning is a combination of the words \"prosperity, luck, security, glory\", and \"good\".\n\nIn Jainism, it is a symbol of the seventh tīrthaṅkara, Suparśvanātha. In the Śvētāmbara tradition, it is also one of the aṣṭamaṅgala or eight auspicious symbols. All Jain temples and holy books must contain the swastika and ceremonies typically begin and end with creating a swastika mark several times with rice around the altar. Jains use rice to make a swastika in front of statues and then put an offering on it, usually a ripe or dried fruit, a sweet ( ), or a coin or currency note. The four arms of the swastika symbolize the four places where a soul could be reborn in the cycle of birth and death — svarga \"heaven\", naraka \"hell\", manushya \"humanity\" or \"tiryancha\" \"as flora or fauna\" — before the soul attains moksha \"salvation\" as a siddha, having ended the cycle of birth and death and become omniscient.\n\nThe swastika is an important Hindu symbol. The swastika symbol is commonly used before entrances or on doorways of homes or temples, to mark the starting page of financial statements, and mandala constructed for rituals such as weddings or welcoming a new born.\n\nThe Swastika has a particular association with Diwali, being drawn in rangoli (coloured sand) or formed with deepak lights on the floor outside Hindu houses and on wall hangings and other decorations.\n\nIn the diverse traditions within Hinduism, both the clockwise and counter-clockwise swastika are found, with different meaning. The clockwise or right hand icon is called swastika, while the counter clockwise or left hand is called sauvastika. The clockwise swastika is a solar symbol (Surya), mirroring the motion of Sun in India (the northern hemisphere) where it appears to enter from east, then south, exiting to the west. The counterclockwise sauvastika is less used, connotes the night and in tantric traditions it is an icon for goddess Kali, the terrifying form of Devi Durga. The symbol also represents activity, karma, motion, wheel, lotus in some contexts. Its symbolism for motion and Sun may be from shared prehistoric cultural roots, according to Norman McClelland.\n\nThe Arya Samaj is of the opinion that \"swastik\" is 'OM' written in the ancient Brahmi script.\n\nIn Buddhism, the swastika is considered to symbolize the auspicious footprints of the Buddha. It is an aniconic symbol for the Buddha in many parts of Asia and a homologous with the \"dharma wheel\". The shape symbolizes eternal cycling, a theme found in samsara doctrine of Buddhism.\n\nThe swastika symbol is common in esoteric tantric traditions of Buddhism, along with Hinduism, where it is found with Chakra theories and other meditative aids. The clockwise symbol is more common, and contrasts with the counter clockwise version common in the Tibetan Bon tradition and locally called \"yungdrung\".\n\nSwastika-like symbols were in use in China already in Neolithic scripts. The paired swastika symbols (leftwise and rightwise) are included, at least since the Liao Dynasty (AD 907–1125), as part of the Chinese writing system (卍 and 卐) and are variant characters for 萬 or 万 (\"wàn\" in Mandarin, \"man\" in Korean, Cantonese, and Japanese, \"vạn\" in Vietnamese) meaning \"myriad\", \"all\", or \"eternity. The swastika marks the beginning of many Buddhist scriptures. In East Asian countries, the left-facing character is often used as symbol for Buddhism and marks the site of a Buddhist temple on maps.\nIn Chinese, Japanese, and Korean the swastika is also a homonym of the number 10,000, and is commonly used to represent the whole of creation, e.g. \"the myriad things\" in the \"Tao Te Ching\". During the Tang dynasty, Empress Wu Zetian (684–704) decreed that the swastika would also be used as an alternative symbol of the Sun.\n\nWhen the Chinese writing system was introduced to Japan in the 8th century, the swastika was adopted into the Japanese language and culture. It is commonly referred as the \"manji\" (lit. \"man-character\"). Since the Middle Ages, it has been used as a \"mon\" by various Japanese families such as Tsugaru clan, Hachisuka clan or around 60 clans that belong to Tokugawa clan. On Japanese maps, a swastika (left-facing and horizontal) is used to mark the location of a Buddhist temple. The right-facing swastika is often referred to as the or , and can also be called .\n\nIn Chinese and Japanese art, the swastika is often found as part of a repeating pattern. One common pattern, called \"sayagata\" in Japanese, comprises left- and right-facing swastikas joined by lines. As the negative space between the lines has a distinctive shape, the sayagata pattern is sometimes called the \"key fret\" motif in English.\n\nAn object very much like a hammer or a double axe is depicted among the magical symbols on the drums of Sami shamans, used in their religious ceremonies before Christianity was established. The name of the Sami thunder god was Horagalles, thought derive from \"Old Man Thor\" (\"Þórr karl\"). Sometimes on the drums, a male figure with a hammer-like object in either hand is shown, and sometimes it is more like a cross with crooked ends, or a swastika.\n\nThe swastika shape (also called a \"fylfot\") appears on various Germanic Migration Period and Viking Age artifacts, such as the 3rd-century Værløse Fibula from Zealand, Denmark, the Gothic spearhead from Brest-Litovsk, today in Belarus, the 9th-century Snoldelev Stone from Ramsø, Denmark, and numerous Migration Period bracteates drawn left-facing or right-facing.\n\nThe pagan Anglo-Saxon ship burial at Sutton Hoo, England, contained numerous items bearing the swastika, now housed in the collection of the Cambridge Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology. The swastika is clearly marked on a hilt and sword belt found at Bifrons in Kent, in a grave of about the 6th century.\n\nHilda Ellis Davidson theorized that the swastika symbol was associated with Thor, possibly representing his Mjolnir — symbolic of thunder — and possibly being connected to the Bronze Age sun cross. Davidson cites \"many examples\" of the swastika symbol from Anglo-Saxon graves of the pagan period, with particular prominence on cremation urns from the cemeteries of East Anglia. Some of the swastikas on the items, on display at the Cambridge Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, are depicted with such care and art that, according to Davidson, it must have possessed special significance as a funerary symbol. The runic inscription on the 8th-century Sæbø sword has been taken as evidence of the swastika as a symbol of Thor in Norse paganism.\n\nAccording to painter Stanisław Jakubowski the \"little sun\" (pol. \"słoneczko\") is an Early Slavic pagan symbol of the Sun. It was engraved on wooden monuments built near the final resting places of fallen Slavs to represent eternal life. The symbol was first seen in a collection of Early Slavic symbols and architectural features drawn and compiled by Polish painter Stanisław Jakubowski, which he named \"Prasłowiańskie motywy architektoniczne\" (). His work was published in 1923, by a publishing house that was then based in the Dębniki district of Kraków. The symbol can also be found on embroidery and pottery in most Slavic countries.\nIn Russia before World War I the swastika was a favorite sign of the last Russian Empress Alexandra Feodorovna. She placed it where she could for happiness, including drawing it in pencil on the walls and windows in the Ipatiev House – place of execution of the royal family, and, without dating, on the wallpaper above the bed, where obviously slept the heir. It was printed on some banknotes of the Russian Provisional Government (1917) and some sovznaks (1918–1922). In 1919 it was approved as insignia for the Kalmyk formations, and for a short period had a certain popularity amongst some artists, politics and army groups. Also it was present on icons, vestments and clerical clothing but in World War II it was removed, having become by association a symbol of the German occupation.\n\nIn modern Russia some neo-Nazis and neopagans argue that the Russian name of the swastika is \"Kołowrót\" (Russian: Коловрат, literally \"spinning wheel\"), but there are no ethnographic sources confirming this. In vernacular speech the swastika was called differently; for example, \"breeze\" — as in Christianity, the swastika represents spiritual movement, descent of the Holy Spirit, and therefore the \"wind\" and \"spirit\" —, or \"ognevtsi\" (\"little flames\"), \"geese\", \"hares\" (a towel with a swastika was called as towel with \"hares\"), \"little horses\".\n\nThe neo-Nazi Russian National Unity group's branch in Estonia is officially registered under the name \"Kołowrót\" and published an extremist newspaper in 2001 under the same name. A criminal investigation found the paper included an array of racial epithets. One Narva resident was sentenced to 1 year in jail for distribution of \"Kołowrót\". The Kolovrat has since been used by the Rusich Battalion, a Russian militant group known for its operation during the War in Donbass.\n\nThe bronze frontispiece of a ritual pre-Christian () shield found in the River Thames near Battersea Bridge (hence \"Battersea Shield\") is embossed with 27 swastikas in bronze and red enamel. An Ogham stone found in Anglish, Co Kerry, Ireland (CIIC 141) was modified into an early Christian gravestone, and was decorated with a cross pattée and two swastikas. The Book of Kells () contains swastika-shaped ornamentation. At the Northern edge of Ilkley Moor in West Yorkshire, there is a swastika-shaped pattern engraved in a stone known as the Swastika Stone. A number of swastikas have been found embossed in Galician metal pieces and carved in stones, mostly from the Castro Culture period, although there also are contemporary examples (imitating old patterns for decorative purposes).\n\nAncient Greek architectural, clothing and coin designs are replete with single or interlinking swastika motifs. There are also gold plate fibulae from the 8th century BCE decorated with an engraved swastika. Related symbols in classical Western architecture include the cross, the three-legged triskele or triskelion and the rounded lauburu. The swastika symbol is also known in these contexts by a number of names, especially \"gammadion\", or rather the tetra-gammadion. The name \"gammadion\" comes from its being seen as being made up of four Greek gamma (Γ) letters. Ancient Greek architectural designs are replete with the interlinking symbol.\n\nIn Greco-Roman art and architecture, and in Romanesque and Gothic art in the West, isolated swastikas are relatively rare, and the swastika is more commonly found as a repeated element in a border or tessellation. The swastika often represented perpetual motion, reflecting the design of a rotating windmill or watermill. A meander of connected swastikas makes up the large band that surrounds the Augustan Ara Pacis.\n\nA design of interlocking swastikas is one of several tessellations on the floor of the cathedral of Amiens, France. A border of linked swastikas was a common Roman architectural motif, and can be seen in more recent buildings as a neoclassical element. A swastika border is one form of meander, and the individual swastikas in such a border are sometimes called \"Greek keys\". There have also been swastikas found on the floors of Pompeii.\n\nThe swastika was widespread among the Illyrians, symbolizing the Sun. The Sun cult was the main Illyrian cult; the Sun was represented by a swastika in clockwise motion, and it stood for the movement of the Sun.\n\nIn Armenia the swastika is called the \"arevakhach\" and \"kerkhach\" () and is the ancient symbol of eternity and eternal light (i.e. God). Swastikas in Armenia were founded on petroglyphs from the copper age, predating the Bronze Age. During the Bronze Age it was depicted on cauldrons, belts, medallions and other items. Among the oldest petroglyphs is the seventh letter of the Armenian alphabet – \"E\" (which means \"is\" or \"to be\") – depicted as a half-swastika.\n\nSwastikas can also be seen on early Medieval churches and fortresses, including the principal tower in Armenia's historical capital city of Ani. The same symbol can be found on Armenian carpets, cross-stones (khachkar) and in medieval manuscripts, as well as on modern monuments as a symbol of eternity.\n\nSwastika shapes have been found on numerous artifacts from Iron Age Europe.\n\nIn Christianity, the swastika is used as a hooked version of the Christian Cross, the symbol of Christ's victory over death. Some Christian churches built in the Romanesque and Gothic eras are decorated with swastikas, carrying over earlier Roman designs. Swastikas are prominently displayed in a mosaic in the St. Sophia church of Kiev, Ukraine dating from the 12th century. They also appear as a repeating ornamental motif on a tomb in the Basilica of St. Ambrose in Milan.\n\nA ceiling painted in 1910 in the church of St Laurent in Grenoble has many swastikas. It can be visited today because the church became the archaeological museum of the city. A proposed direct link between it and a swastika floor mosaic in the Cathedral of Our Lady of Amiens, which was built on top of a pagan site at Amiens, France in the 13th century, is considered unlikely. The stole worn by a priest in the 1445 painting of the Seven Sacraments by Rogier van der Weyden presents the swastika form simply as one way of depicting the cross.\n\nSwastikas also appear in art and architecture during the Renaissance and Baroque era. The fresco \"The School of Athens\" shows an ornament made out of swastikas, and the symbol can also be found on the facade of the \"Santa Maria della Salute\", a Roman Catholic church and minor basilica located at Punta della Dogana in the Dorsoduro sestiere of the city of Venice.\n\nIn the Polish First Republic the symbol of the swastika was also popular with the nobility. According to chronicles, the Rus' prince Oleg, who in the 9th century attacked Constantinople, nailed his shield (which had a large red swastika painted on it) to the city's gates. Several noble houses, e.g. Boreyko, Borzym, and Radziechowski from Ruthenia, also had swastikas as their coat of arms. The family reached its greatness in the 14th and 15th centuries and its crest can be seen in many heraldry books produced at that time.\nThe swastika was also a heraldic symbol, for example on the Boreyko coat of arms, used by noblemen in Poland and Ukraine. In the 19th century the swastika was one of the Russian empire's symbols; it was even placed in coins as a background to the Russian eagle.\n\nA swastika can be seen on stonework at Valle Crucis Abbey, near Llangollen.\nThe swastika can be found on Ashanti gold weights and among adinkra symbols in West Africa.\nIn the Western world, the symbol experienced a resurgence following the archaeological work in the late 19th century of Heinrich Schliemann, who discovered the symbol in the site of ancient Troy and associated it with the ancient migrations of Proto-Indo-Europeans, whose proto-language was not coincidentally termed \"Proto-Indo-Germanic\" by German language historians. He connected it with similar shapes found on ancient pots in Germany, and theorized that the swastika was a \"significant religious symbol of our remote ancestors\", linking it to ancient Teutons, Greeks of the time of Homer and Indians of the Vedic era. By the early 20th century, it was used worldwide and was regarded as a symbol of good luck and success.\n\nSchliemann's work soon became intertwined with the \"völkisch\" movements, which used the swastika as a symbol for the \"Aryan race\"—a concept that theorists such as Alfred Rosenberg equated with a Nordic master race originating in northern Europe. Since its adoption by the Nazi Party of Adolf Hitler, the swastika has been associated with Nazism, fascism, racism in its (white supremacy) form, the Axis powers in World War II, and the Holocaust in much of the West. The swastika remains a core symbol of neo-Nazi groups.\n\nThe Benedictine choir school at Lambach Abbey, Upper Austria, which Hitler attended for several months as a boy, had a swastika chiseled into the monastery portal and also the wall above the spring grotto in the courtyard by 1868. Their origin was the personal coat of arms of Abbot Theoderich Hagn of the monastery in Lambach, which bore a golden swastika with slanted points on a blue field. The Lambach swastika is probably of Medieval origin.\n\nIn the 1880s the Theosophical Society adopted a swastika as part of its seal, along with an Om, a hexagram or star of David, an Ankh and an Ouroboros. Unlike the much more recent Raëlian movement, the Theosophical Society symbol has been free from controversy, and the seal is still used. The current seal also includes the text \"There is no religion higher than truth.\"\nThe British author and poet Rudyard Kipling used the symbol on the cover art of a number of his works, including \"The Five Nations\", 1903, which has it twinned with an elephant.\n\nThe Danish brewery company Carlsberg Group used the swastika as a logo from the 19th Century until the middle of the 1930s when it was discontinued because of association with the Nazi Party in neighbouring Germany. The swastika carved on elephants at the entrance gates of the company's headquarters in Copenhagen in 1901 can still be seen today.\n\nThe Swastika Laundry was a laundry founded in 1912, located on Shelbourne Road, Ballsbridge, a district of Dublin, Ireland. In the fifties Heinrich Böll came across a van belonging to the company while he was staying in Ireland, leading to some awkward moments before he realized the company was older than Nazism and totally unrelated to it. The chimney of the boiler-house of the laundry still stands, but the laundry has been redeveloped.\n\nIn Finland the swastika (\"hakaristi\", meaning hook-cross) was often used in traditional folk art products, as a decoration or magical symbol on textiles and wood. The swastika was also used by the Finnish Air Force until 1945, and is still used on air force flags.\n\nThe tursaansydän is used by scouts in some instances and a student organization. The village of Tursa uses the tursaansydän as a kind of a certificate of authenticity on products made there. Traditional textiles are still being made with swastikas as parts of traditional ornaments.\n\nThe Finnish Air Force used the swastika as an emblem, introduced in 1918. The type of swastika adopted by the air-force was the symbol of luck for the Swedish count Eric von Rosen, who donated one of its earliest aircraft; he later became a prominent figure in the Swedish nazi-movement.\n\nThe swastika was also used by the women's paramilitary organization Lotta Svärd, which was banned in 1944 in accordance with the Moscow Armistice between Finland and the allied Soviet Union and Britain.\n\nThe President of Finland is the grand master of the Order of the White Rose. According to the protocol, the president shall wear the Grand Cross of the White Rose with collar on formal occasions. The original design of the collar, decorated with 9 swastikas, dates from 1918, and was designed by the artist Akseli Gallen-Kallela. The Grand Cross with the swastika collar has been awarded 41 times to foreign heads of state. To avoid misunderstandings, the swastika decorations were replaced by fir crosses at the decision of president Urho Kekkonen in 1963 after it became known that the President of France Charles De Gaulle was uncomfortable with the swastika collar.\n\nAlso a design by Gallen-Kallela from 1918, the Cross of Liberty has a swastika pattern in its arms. The Cross of Liberty is depicted in the upper left corner of the standard of the President of Finland.\n\nIn December 2007, a silver replica of the World War II period Finnish air defence's relief ring decorated with a swastika became available as a part of a charity campaign.\n\nThe original war time idea was that the public swap their precious metal rings for the State air defence's relief ring, made of iron.\n\nThe swastika is an ancient Baltic thunder cross symbol (\"pērkona krusts;\" also fire cross, \"ugunskrusts\"), used to decorate objects, traditional clothing and in archaeological excavations. Latvia adopted the swastika, for its Air Force in 1918/1919 and continued its use until the Soviet occupation in 1940. The cross itself was maroon on a white background, mirroring the colors of the Latvian flag. Earlier versions pointed counter-clockwise, while later versions pointed clock-wise and eliminated the white background. Various other Latvian Army units and the Latvian War College (the predecessor of the National Defence Academy) also had adopted the symbol in their battle flags and insignia during the Latvian War of Independence. A stylized fire cross is the base of the Order of Lāčplēsis, the highest military decoration of Latvia for participants of the War of Independence. The radical political organization Pērkonkrusts also used the fire cross as one of its symbols.\n\nLithuania\n\nAs in Latvia, the symbol is a traditional Baltic ornament, found on relics dating from at least the 13th century.\n\nThe traditional symbols of the Podhale Rifles include the edelweiss flower and the Mountain Cross, a swastika symbol popular in folk culture of the Polish mountainous regions. The units of Podhale Rifles, both historical and modern, are notable for their high morale and distinctive uniforms.\n\nThe Swedish company ASEA, now a part of ABB, in the late 1800s introduced a company logo featuring a swastika. The logo was replaced in 1933, when Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany. During the early 1900s, the swastika was used as a symbol of electric power, perhaps because it resembled a waterwheel or turbine. On maps of the period, the sites of hydroelectric power stations were marked with swastikas.\n\nThe headquarters of the Oslo Municipal Power Station was designed by architects \"Bjercke and Eliassen\" in 1928–31. Swastikas adorn its wrought iron gates. The architects knew the swastika as a symbol of \"electricity\" and were probably not yet aware that it had been usurped by the German Nazi party and would soon become the foremost symbol of the German Reich. The fact that these gates survived the cleanup after the German occupation of Norway during WW II is a testimony to the innocence and good faith of the power plant and its architects.\n\nThe swastika motif is found in some traditional Native American art and iconography. Historically, the design has been found in excavations of Mississippian-era sites in the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys, and on objects associated with the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex (S.E.C.C.). It is also widely used by a number of southwestern tribes, most notably the Navajo, and plains nations such as the Dakota. Among various tribes, the swastika carries different meanings. To the Hopi it represents the wandering Hopi clan; to the Navajo it is one symbol for the whirling log (\"tsin náálwołí\"), a sacred image representing a legend that is used in healing rituals. A brightly colored First Nations saddle featuring swastika designs is on display at the Royal Saskatchewan Museum in Canada.\n\nThe Passamaquoddy Native American tribe, now located in the state of Maine and in Canada, used an elongated swastika on their war canoes in the American colonial period as well as later. A carving of a canoe with a Passamaquody swastika was found in a ruin in the Argonne Forest in France, having been carved there by Moses Neptune, an American soldier of Passamaquody heritage, who was one of the last American soldiers to die in battle in World War I.\n\nBefore the 1930s, the symbol for the 45th Infantry Division of the United States Army was a red diamond with a yellow swastika, a tribute to the large Native American population in the southwestern United States.\n\nA swastika shape is a symbol in the culture of the Kuna people of Kuna Yala, Panama. In Kuna tradition it symbolizes the octopus that created the world, its tentacles pointing to the four cardinal points.\n\nIn February 1925 the Kuna revolted vigorously against Panamanian suppression of their culture, and in 1930 they assumed autonomy. The flag they adopted at that time is based on the swastika shape, and remains the official flag of Kuna Yala. A number of variations on the flag have been used over the years: red top and bottom bands instead of orange were previously used, and in 1942 a ring (representing the traditional Kuna nose-ring) was added to the center of the flag to distance it from the symbol of the Nazi party.\n\nThe town of Swastika, Ontario, Canada is named after the symbol.\n\nFrom 1909 to 1916, the K-R-I-T automobile, manufactured in Detroit, Michigan, used a right-facing swastika as their trademark.\n\nThe swastika was widely used in Europe at the start of the 20th century. It symbolized many things to the Europeans, with the most common symbolism being of good luck and auspiciousness. In the wake of widespread popular usage, in post-World War I Germany, the newly established Nazi Party formally adopted the (, meaning \"hooked-cross\") in 1920 The emblem was a black swastika (hooks branching clockwise) rotated 45 degrees on a white circle on a red background. This insignia was used on the party's flag, badge, and armband.\n\nIn his 1925 work , Adolf Hitler writes that: \"I myself, meanwhile, after innumerable attempts, had laid down a final form; a flag with a red background, a white disk, and a black swastika in the middle. After long trials I also found a definite proportion between the size of the flag and the size of the white disk, as well as the shape and thickness of the swastika.\"\n\nWhen Hitler created a flag for the Nazi Party, he sought to incorporate both the swastika and \"those revered colors expressive of our homage to the glorious past and which once brought so much honor to the German nation.\" (Red, white, and black were the colors of the flag of the old German Empire.) He also stated: \"As National Socialists, we see our program in our flag. In red, we see the social idea of the movement; in white, the nationalistic idea; in the swastika, the mission of the struggle for the victory of the Aryan man, and, by the same token, the victory of the idea of creative work.\"\n\nThe swastika was also understood as \"the symbol of the creating, effecting life\" () and as \"race emblem of Germanism\" ().\n\nThe use of the swastika was incorporated by Nazi theorists with their conjecture of Aryan cultural descent of the German people. The fascination of the German people with Aryanism arose when artifacts with swastikas on them were found near the Trojan city of Troy by . The Nazi party was looking for the symbol that would preferably catch the attention of all of Germany and the swastika had that potential. It became a symbol to unify the German people, to a conjecture about their ancestors, Aryan identity and nationalistic pride. It also allowed the Nazi party to establish their anti-Semitic views, as well as terrify Jews and the enemies of the Nazi state.\n\nThe concept of racial hygiene was an ideology central to Nazism, though it is scientific racism. For , the Aryans of India were both a model to be imitated and a warning of the dangers of the spiritual and racial \"confusion\" that, he believed, arose from the proximity of races. Thus, they saw fit to co-opt the sign as a symbol of the Aryan master race. The use of the swastika as a symbol of the Aryan race dates back to writings of Emile Burnouf. Following many other writers, the German nationalist poet Guido von List believed it was a uniquely Aryan symbol.\n\nBefore the Nazis, the swastika was already in use as a symbol of German nationalist movements ().\n\nJosé Manuel Erbez says:\n\nHowever, Liebenfels was drawing on an already established use of the symbol.\n\nOn 14 March 1933, shortly after Hitler's appointment as Chancellor of Germany, the NSDAP flag was hoisted alongside Germany's national colors. An adaption of the NSDAP flag – with the swastika slightly offset from center – was adopted as the sole national flag of Germany on 15 September 1935.\n\nThe swastika was used for badges and flags throughout Nazi Germany, particularly for government and military organizations, but also for \"popular\" organizations such as the (German Hunting Society).\n\nWhile the DAP and the NSDAP had used both right-facing and left-facing swastikas, the right-facing swastika was used consistently from 1920 onwards. Ralf Stelter notes that the swastika flag used on land had a right-facing swastika on both sides, while the ensign (naval flag) had it printed through so that a left-facing swastika would be seen when looking at the ensign with the flagpole to the right. Nazi ensigns had a through and through image, so both versions were present, one on each side, but the Nazi flag on land was right-facing on both sides and at a 45° rotation.\n\nSeveral variants are found:\n\nDuring World War II it was common to use small swastikas to mark air-to-air victories on the sides of Allied aircraft, and at least one British fighter pilot inscribed a swastika in his logbook for each German plane he shot down.\n\nBecause of its use by Nazi Germany, the swastika since the 1930s has been largely associated with Nazism. In the aftermath of World War II it has been considered a symbol of hate in the West, or alternatively of white supremacy in many Western countries.\n\nAs a result, all of its use, or its use as a Nazi or hate symbol, is prohibited in some countries, including Germany. Because of the stigma attached to the symbol, many buildings that have used the symbol as decoration have had the symbol removed. In some countries, such as the United States' \"Virginia v. Black\" 2003 case, the highest courts have ruled that the local governments can prohibit the use of swastika along with other symbols such as cross burning, if the intent of the use is to intimidate others.\n\nThe German and Austrian postwar criminal code makes the public showing of the (the swastika), the sig rune, the Celtic cross (specifically the variations used by white power activists), the , the odal rune and the skull illegal, except for scholarly reasons (and, in the case of the odal rune, as the insignia of the rank of sergeant major, , in the modern German ). It is also censored from the reprints of 1930s railway timetables published by the . The eagle remains, but appears to hold a solid black circle between its talons. The swastikas on Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain temples are exempt, as religious symbols cannot be banned in Germany.\n\nThe German fashion company Esprit Holdings was investigated for using traditional British-made folded leather buttons after complaints that they resembled swastikas. In response, Esprit Holdings destroyed two hundred thousand catalogues.\n\nA controversy was stirred by the decision of several police departments to begin inquiries against anti-fascists. In late 2005 police raided the offices of the punk rock label and mail order store \"Nix Gut Records\" and confiscated merchandise depicting crossed-out swastikas and fists smashing swastikas. In 2006 the police department started an inquiry against anti-fascist youths using a placard depicting a person dumping a swastika into a trashcan. The placard was displayed in opposition to the campaign of right-wing nationalist parties for local elections.\n\nOn Friday, 17 March 2006, a member of the , Claudia Roth reported herself to the German police for displaying a crossed-out swastika in multiple demonstrations against Neo-Nazis, and subsequently got the Bundestag to suspend her immunity from prosecution. She intended to show the absurdity of charging anti-fascists with using fascist symbols: \"We don't need prosecution of non-violent young people engaging against right-wing extremism.\" On 15 March 2007, the Federal Court of Justice of Germany () held that the crossed-out symbols were \"clearly directed against a revival of national-socialist endeavors\", thereby settling the dispute for the future.\n\n\nThe European Union's Executive Commission proposed a European Union-wide anti-racism law in 2001, but European Union states failed to agree on the balance between prohibiting racism and freedom of expression. An attempt to ban the swastika across the EU in early 2005 failed after objections from the British Government and others. In early 2007, while Germany held the European Union presidency, Berlin proposed that the European Union should follow German Criminal Law and criminalize the denial of the Holocaust and the display of Nazi symbols including the swastika, which is based on the Ban on the Symbols of Unconstitutional Organizations Act. This led to an opposition campaign by Hindu groups across Europe against a ban on the swastika. They pointed out that the swastika has been around for 5,000 years as a symbol of peace. The proposal to ban the swastika was dropped by Berlin from the proposed European Union wide anti-racism laws on 29 January 2007.\n\n\nAs the public display of Nazi-era German flags (or any other flags) is protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, which guarantees the right to freedom of speech, the Nazi \"Reichskriegsflagge\" has also been seen on display at white supremacist \"events\" within United States borders.\n\nAs with many neo-Nazi groups across the world, the swastika was also a part of the American Nazi Party's flag before its first dissolution in 1967 – its \"re-use\" was initiated by successor organizations in 1983, without the publicity Rockwell's original organization possessed. The symbol was originally chosen by the initial organization's founder, George L. Rockwell.\n\nThe swastika, in various iconographic forms, is one of the hate symbols identified in use as graffiti in the schools of the United States, and is a part of the 1999 US Department of Education's emergency school-wide response trigger.\n\nIn 2010, Microsoft officially spoke out against use of the swastika by players of the first-person shooter \"\". In \"Black Ops\", players are allowed to customize their name tags to represent, essentially, whatever they want. The swastika can be created and used, but Stephen Toulouse, director of Xbox Live policy and enforcement, stated that players with the symbol on their name tag will be banned (if someone reports as inappropriate) from Xbox Live.\n\nIn the \"Indiana Jones Stunt Spectacular\" in Disney Hollywood Studios in Orlando, Florida, the swastikas on German trucks, aircraft and actor uniforms in the reenactment of a scene from \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" were removed in 2004. The swastika has been replaced by a stylized Greek Cross.\n\nNazi imagery was adapted and incorporated into the 2016 sci-fi movie \"\". Its inclusion was to subliminally draw parallels between the movie's Federal Bureau of Termination and Nazi Germany, and also refer to Kurt Vonnegut's experiences as a POW and the influence World War II played in his imagining of a population-controlled future where authorities use gas chambers to terminate people. The Federal Bureau of Termination logo appears as a white geometric design with a black outline, centered on vertical banners, in reference to the Third Reich banners. These banners were initially red, until the crew felt the allusion was too strong. The movie's hospital was envisaged as the Bureau's branch that controlled birth, and their red cross was given 'wings' to transform it into a swastika, and link it to the Bureau's logo.\n\nIn 2005, authorities in Tajikistan called for the widespread adoption of the swastika as a national symbol. President Emomali Rahmonov declared the swastika an Aryan symbol, and 2006 \"the year of Aryan culture,\" which would be a time to \"study and popularize Aryan contributions to the history of the world civilization, raise a new generation (of Tajiks) with the spirit of national self-determination, and develop deeper ties with other ethnicities and cultures.\"\n\nIn East Asia, the swastika is prevalent in Buddhist monasteries and communities. It is commonly found in Buddhist temples, religious artefacts, texts related to Buddhism and schools founded by Buddhist religious groups. It also appears as a design or motif (singularly or woven into a pattern) on textiles, architecture and various decorative objects as a symbol of luck and good fortune. The icon is also found as a sacred symbol in the Bon tradition, but in the left facing mode.\n\nMany Chinese religions make use of the swastika symbol, including Guiyidao and Shanrendao. The Red Swastika Society, which is the philanthropic branch of Guiyidao, runs two schools in Hong Kong (the Hong Kong Red Swastika Society Tai Po Secondary School and the Hong Kong Red Swastika Society Tuen Mun Primary School) and one in Singapore (Red Swastika School). All of them show the swastika in their logos.\n\nAmong the predominantly Hindu population of Bali, in Indonesia, the swastika is common in temples, homes and public spaces. Similarly, the swastika is a common icon associated with Buddha's footprints in Theravada Buddhist communities of Myanmar, Thailand and Cambodia.\n\nIn Japan, the swastika is also used as a map symbol and is designated by the Survey Act and related Japanese governmental rules to denote a Buddhist temple.\n\nThe city of Hirosaki in Aomori Prefecture designates this symbol as its official flag, which stemmed from its use in the emblem of the Tsugaru clan, the lords of Hirosaki Domain during the Edo period.\n\nIn India, Nepal and Sri Lanka, the swastika is common. Temples, businesses and other organisations, such as the Buddhist libraries, Ahmedabad Stock Exchange and the Nepal Chamber of Commerce, use the swastika in reliefs or logos. Swastikas are ubiquitous in Indian and Nepalese communities, located on shops, buildings, transport vehicles, and clothing. The swastika remains prominent in Hindu ceremonies such as weddings. The left facing \"sauwastika\" symbol is found in tantric rituals.\n\nMusaeus College in Colombo, Sri Lanka, a Buddhist girls' school, has a left facing swastika in their school logo.\n\nIn India, swastik and swastika, with their spelling variants, are first names for males and females respectively, for instance with Swastika Mukherjee. The Seal of Bihar contains two swastikas.\n\nSince the end of the 20th century, and through the early 21st century, confusion and controversy has occurred when consumer goods bearing the traditional Jain, Buddhist, or Hindu symbols have been exported to the West, notably to North America and Europe, and have been interpreted by consumers as bearing a Nazi symbol. This has resulted in several such products having been boycotted or pulled from shelves.\n\nWhen a ten-year-old boy in Lynbrook, New York, bought a set of Pokémon cards imported from Japan in 1999, two of the cards contained the left-facing Buddhist swastika. The boy's parents misinterpreted the symbol as the right-facing Nazi swastika and filed a complaint to the manufacturer. Nintendo of America announced that the cards would be discontinued, explaining that what was acceptable in one culture was not necessarily so in another; their action was welcomed by the Anti-Defamation League who recognised that there was no intention to offend, but said that international commerce meant that, \"Isolating [the Swastika] in Asia would just create more problems.\"\n\nIn 2002, Christmas crackers containing plastic toy red pandas sporting swastikas were pulled from shelves after complaints from consumers in Canada. The manufacturer, based in China, said the symbol was presented in a traditional sense and not as a reference to the Nazis, and apologized to the customers for the cross-cultural mixup.\n\nBesides the use as a religious symbol in Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism, which can be traced to pre-modern traditions, the swastika is also used by a number of new religious movements established in the modern period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "316380", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=316380", "title": "The Extended Mind", "text": "The Extended Mind\n\n\"The Extended Mind\" by Andy Clark and David Chalmers (1998) is a seminal work in the field of extended cognition. In this paper, Clark and Chalmers present the idea of \"active externalism\" (similar to semantic or \"content\" externalism), in which objects within the environment function as a part of the mind. They argue that it is arbitrary to say that the mind is contained only within the boundaries of the skull. The separation between the mind, the body, and the environment is seen as an unprincipled distinction. Because external objects play a significant role in aiding cognitive processes, the mind and the environment act as a \"coupled system\". This coupled system can be seen as a complete cognitive system of its own. In this manner, the mind is extended into the external world. The main criterion that Clark and Chalmers list for classifying the use of external objects during cognitive tasks as a part of an extended cognitive system is that the external objects must function with the same purpose as the internal processes.\n\nIn \"The Extended Mind\", a thought experiment is presented to further illustrate the environment's role in connection to the mind. The fictional characters Otto and Inga are both travelling to a museum simultaneously. Otto has Alzheimer's disease, and has written all of his directions down in a notebook to serve the function of his memory. Inga is able to recall the internal directions within her memory. In a traditional sense, Inga can be thought to have had a belief as to the location of the museum before consulting her memory. In the same manner, Otto can be said to have held a belief of the location of the museum before consulting his notebook. The argument is that the only difference existing in these two cases is that Inga's memory is being internally processed by the brain, while Otto's memory is being served by the notebook. In other words, Otto's mind has been extended to include the notebook as the source of his memory. The notebook qualifies as such because it is constantly and immediately accessible to Otto, and it is automatically endorsed by him.\n\nGoing further, the authors ask and answer their own question about the role of enculturation:\n\nThey bring up the recurrent theme of the role of language:\n\nThe \"extended mind\" is an idea in the field of philosophy of mind, often called extended cognition, which holds that the reach of the mind need not end at the boundaries of skin and skull. Tools, instrument and other environmental props can under certain conditions also count as proper parts of our minds. Closely related topics often conjoined with the idea of \"extended mind\" are situated cognition, distributed cognition, and embodied cognition.\n\nIn a book with the title \"The Extended Mind: The Emergence of Language, the Human Mind and Culture\", Robert K. Logan (2007) develops the thesis that verbal language extends the brain into a mind capable of conceptualization and hence the mind = brain + language. The human brain before it acquired verbal language according to this thesis is considered to be a percept processor. With language the mind is capable of conceptualization and hence able to consider things that are not immediately available in the here and now. The first words of verbal language are concepts associated with all the percepts associated with those words. For example the word water brings to mind the water we drink, the water we cook with, the water we wash with and the water we find in rivers, lakes and oceans and the water we find when it rains or when snow melts. Logan's thesis was first developed in a paper, \"The extended mind: understanding language and thought in terms of complexity and chaos theory\" presented at the 7th Annual Conference of The Society for Chaos Theory in Psychology and the Life Sciences at Marquette U., Milwaukee, Wisconsin on August 1, 1997.\n\n\n"}

Since November 2011, it has also been available as a podcast.\n\nFour regular panellists discuss moral and ethical issues raised by a recent news story. Michael Buerk delivers a preamble launching the topic, then a series of 'witnesses' - experts or other relevant people - are questioned by the panellists, who then discuss what each witness said.\n\nThe regular panellists are:\n\nThe panellists mainly fall into two opposing camps of broadly centrist and right-wing viewpoints, and the discussions hence often revolve around whether newer liberal values are eroding more traditional values. This binary split is often complicated by differing philosophical views the panel hold which do not conveniently sit in a simple left-right political divide.\n\nNotable former panellists include Rabbi Hugo Gryn (who died in 1996), Janet Daley, Edward Pearce, Geoffrey Robertson, Michael Mansfield, politician Michael Gove, Ian Hargreaves, Kenan Malik, scientist Steven Rose, philosophers Simon Blackburn and Roger Scruton, and historian David Starkey, who often attracted controversy for his allegedly blunt manner.\n\nThe first programme on Monday 20 August 1990 was forty minutes long from 11am, and followed by \"Poetry Please\". It was made by the Factual Unit of Religious Programmes (later called Factual Programmes Religion) at BBC North in Manchester. It was hoped that the programme format would involve the panellists' views being revised during the course of a programme, but this rarely happened.\n\nIn April 1991, it had moved to Tuesdays, and followed the 9am news, until 9:45am (a slot similar to the current \"In Our Time\"). In July 1991, it had moved to 8:05pm until 8:50pm on Fridays, replacing \"Any Questions?\" for the summer recess. There was then a repeat at 1pm on the following Saturday, and a phone-in from 2 to 2:30pm, replacing \"Any Answers?\". There was also an end-of-year programme. In July 1992, it had moved to Thursday mornings following the 9am news. It became a \"de rigueur\" listen for Westminster MPs. By 1997, it was fifty-five minutes long, lasting until 10am. It moved to Wednesday evenings from 13 May 1998 in the 1998 schedule changes, with a repeat of the forty-five-minute programme on Saturday night at 10:15pm.\n\nMichael Buerk has presented the programme since August 1990. David Aaronovitch presents occasional episodes during Buerk's absence. \n\nOriginally produced at the BBC North West's New Broadcasting House on Oxford Road in Manchester, the programme production base is Salford Quays. The programme is broadcast live from BBC Broadcasting House in London.\n\nIn early 1994, a television version was considered, which eventually took off on Saturday 10 September 1994 on BBC2 as a trial series of six 45-minute-long programmes broadcast around midnight, perhaps influenced by Channel 4's successful late-night discussion programme \"After Dark\". The pilot had audiences of around 1.3 million. It was last broadcast on 15 October 1994 at 11pm.\n\nIn his book \"Bad Thoughts\" (US title \"Crimes Against Logic\"), libertarian philosopher Jamie Whyte, who has been a witness on the programme, advises readers to listen to \"The Moral Maze\" for innumerable examples of faulty reasoning. Journalist and author Nick Cohen has also criticised the programme, in a piece highlighting the media careers of Trotskyite-turned-libertarian former cadres of the Revolutionary Communist Party, centered around the Spiked magazine.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "186397", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=186397", "title": "The Name of the Rose", "text": "The Name of the Rose\n\nThe Name of the Rose ( ) is the 1980 debut novel by Italian author Umberto Eco. It is a historical murder mystery set in an Italian monastery in the year 1327; an intellectual mystery combining semiotics in fiction, biblical analysis, medieval studies and literary theory. It was translated into English by William Weaver in 1983.\n\nThe novel has sold over 50 million copies worldwide, becoming one of the best-selling books ever published. It has received many international awards and accolades, such as the Strega Prize in 1981 and Prix Medicis Étrangère in 1982, and was ranked 14th on \"Le Monde\" 100 Books of the Century list.\n\nIn 1327, Franciscan friar William of Baskerville and Adso of Melk, a Benedictine novice travelling under his protection, arrive at a Benedictine monastery in Northern Italy to attend a theological disputation. This abbey is being used as an embassy between Pope John XXII, and the Friars Minor, who are suspected of heresy. \n\nThe monastery is disturbed by the death of Adelmo of Otranto, an illuminator revered for his illustrations. Adelmo was skilled at comical artwork, especially concerning religious matters. William is tasked by the monastery's abbot, Abo of Fossanova to investigate the death, and he has a debate with one of the oldest monks in the abbey, Jorge of Burgos, about the theological meaning of laughter, which Jorge despises. \n\nThe next day, a scholar of Aristotle and translator of Greek and Arabic, Venantius of Salvamec, is found dead in a vat of pig's blood. Previously, William and Adso had been prohibited from the library by the book keeper Malachi of Hildesheim, so they penetrate the labyrinth, discovering that there must be a hidden room, entitled the \"finis Africae.\" Bencio of Uppsala, a rhetoric scholar, reveals to William that Malachi, and his assistant Berengar of Arundel, had a homosexual relationship, until Berengar seduced Adelmo, who committed suicide out of religious shame. The only other monks who knew about the indiscretions were Jorge and Venantius.\n\nBy the day after, Berengar has gone missing, which puts pressure onto William. William learns of how Salvatore of Montferrat, and Remigio of Varagine, two cellarer monks, had a history with the Dulcinian heretics. Meanwhile, Adso is seduced by a peasant girl, with whom he has his first sexual experience. After confessing to William, Adso is absolved, although he still feels guilty. Severinus of Sankt Wendel, the herbalist, tells William that Venantius's body had ink stains on the tongue and fingers, which suggests poison. William and Adso penetrate the library once more, discovering that Venantius had a book stolen from him, which they pursue. \n\nOn the fourth day, Berengar is found drowned in a bath, although he bears ink stains similar to those of Venantius. Bernard Gui, a member of the Inquisition, arrives to search for the murderer via Papal deduction. Due to this arrival, Gui arrests the peasant girl Adso loved, as well as Salvatore, accusing them both of heresy.\n\nRemigio is interrogated by Gui, who scares him into revealing his heretic past, as well as falsely confessing to the crimes of the Abbey. Severinus then is found dead in his room, to which Jorge responds by leading a sermon about the coming of the Antichrist. \n\nMalachi returns to the early sermon that day near death, and his final words concern scorpions. Nicholas of Morimondo, the glazier, tells William that whoever is the librarian would then become the Abbot, and with new light, William goes to the library to search for evidence. The Abbot is distraught that William has not solved the crime, and that the Inquisition is undermining him, so he fires William. That night, William and Adso penetrate the library once more in search of the \"finis Africae.\"\n\nWilliam and Adso discover Jorge waiting for them in the forbidden room. He says that he has been masterminding the Abbey for years, and his last victim is the Abbot himself, who has been led into the library. The Abbot suffocates, and Jorge tells them that Venantius's hidden book was Aristotle's Second \"Poetics\", which speaks of the virtues of laughter, something Jorge despises. Jorge poisoned the ink on the book, which is consumed when one turns the pages. Venantius was translating the book and died. Berengar found the body and disposed of it in pig's blood, fearing exposure, before reading the book himself and dying. Malachi was convinced by Jorge to retrieve the book, which was stashed with Severinus, so he kills Severinus and retrieves the book, before getting curious and dying as well. \n\nAll of the murders time out with the Seven Trumpets, which call for objects falling from the sky (Adelmo threw himself from a tower), pools of blood, poison from water, bashing of the stars (Severinus was killed with his head bashed in with a celestial orb), scorpions, locusts, and fire. Jorge consumes the book's poisoned pages and uses Adso's lantern to start a fire, which burns down the library. As the fire spreads to the rest of the abbey, William laments his failure. Confused and defeated, William and Adso escape the abbey. Years later, Adso, now aged, returns to the ruins of the abbey and collects books that were salvaged from the fire, creating a lesser library.\n\n\n\n\nEco was a professor of semiotics, and employs techniques of metanarrative, partial fictionalization, and linguistic ambiguity to create a world enriched by layers of meaning. The solution to the central murder mystery hinges on the contents of Aristotle's book on Comedy, which has been lost. In spite of this, Eco speculates on the content and has the characters react to it. Through the motif of this lost and possibly suppressed book which might have aestheticized the farcical, the unheroic and the skeptical, Eco also makes an ironically slanted plea for tolerance and against dogmatic or self-sufficient metaphysical truths—an angle which reaches the surface in the final chapters.\n\n\"The Name of the Rose\" has been described as a work of postmodernism. The quote in the novel, \"books always speak of other books, and every story tells a story that has already been told\", refers to a postmodern idea that all texts perpetually refer to other texts, rather than external reality, while also harkening back to the medieval notion that citation and quotation of books was inherently necessary to write new stories. The novel ends with irony: as Eco explains in his \"Postscript to the Name of the Rose\", \"very little is discovered and the detective is defeated.\" After unraveling the central mystery in part through coincidence and error, William of Baskerville concludes in fatigue that there \"was no pattern.\" Thus Eco turns the modernist quest for finality, certainty and meaning on its head, leaving the overall plot partly the result of accident and arguably without meaning.\n\nThe mystery revolves around the abbey library, situated in a fortified tower—the aedificium. This structure has three floors—the ground floor contains the kitchen and refectory, the first floor a scriptorium, and the top floor is occupied by the library. The two lower floors are open to all, while only the librarian may enter the last. A catalogue of books is kept in the scriptorium, where manuscripts are read and copied. A monk who wishes to read a book would send a request to the librarian, who, if he thought the request justified, would bring it to the scriptorium. Finally, the library is in the form of a labyrinth, whose secret only the librarian and the assistant librarian know.\n\nThe aedificium has four towers at the four cardinal points, and the top floor of each has seven rooms on the outside, surrounding a central room. There are another eight rooms on the outer walls, and sixteen rooms in the centre of the maze. Thus, the library has a total of fifty-six rooms. Each room has a scroll containing a verse from the Book of Revelation. The first letter of the verse is the letter corresponding to that room. The letters of adjacent rooms, read together, give the name of a region (e.g. Hibernia in the West tower), and those rooms contain books from that region. The geographical regions are:\n\nTwo rooms have no lettering - the easternmost room, which has an altar, and the central room on the south tower, the so-called \"finis Africae,\" which contains the most heavily guarded books, and can only be entered through a secret door. The entrance to the library is in the central room of the east tower, which is connected to the scriptorium by a staircase.\n\nMuch attention has been paid to the mystery the book's title refers to. In fact, Eco has stated that his intention was to find a \"totally neutral title\". In one version of the story, when he had finished writing the novel, Eco hurriedly suggested some ten names for it and asked a few of his friends to choose one. They chose \"The Name of the Rose\". In another version of the story, Eco had wanted the neutral title \"Adso of Melk\", but that was vetoed by his publisher, and then the title \"The Name of the Rose\" \"came to me virtually by chance.\" In the \"Postscript to the Name of the Rose\", Eco claims to have chosen the title \"because the rose is a symbolic figure so rich in meanings that by now it hardly has any meaning left\".\n\nThe book's last line, translates as: \"the rose of old remains only in its name; we possess naked names.\" The general sense, as Eco pointed out, was that from the beauty of the past, now disappeared, we hold only the name. In this novel, the lost \"rose\" could be seen as Aristotle's book on comedy (now forever lost), the exquisite library now destroyed, or the beautiful peasant girl now dead.\n\nThe title is also an allusion to the nominalist position in the problem of universals, taken by William of Ockham. According to nominalism, universals are bare names: there is not a universal rose, only the name \"rose\".\n\nThis text has also been translated as \"Yesterday's rose stands only in name, we hold only empty names.\" This line is a verse by twelfth century monk Bernard of Cluny (also known as Bernard of Morlaix). Medieval manuscripts of this line are not in agreement: Eco quotes one Medieval variant verbatim, but Eco was not aware at the time of the text more commonly printed in modern editions, in which the reference is to Rome (\"Roma\"), not to a rose (\"rosa\"). The alternative text, with its context, runs: \"Nunc ubi Regulus aut ubi Romulus aut ubi Remus? / Stat Roma pristina nomine, nomina nuda tenemus\". This translates as \"Where now is Regulus, or Romulus, or Remus? / Primordial Rome abides only in its name; we hold only naked names.\"\n\nAlso the title of the book may be related to a poem by the Mexican poet and mystic Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz (1651–1695):\n\nRosa que al prado, encarnada,\nte ostentas presuntuosa\nde grana y carmín bañada:\ncampa lozana y gustosa;\npero no, que siendo hermosa\ntambién serás desdichada.\nwhich appears in Eco's \"Postscript to the Name of the Rose\", and is translated into English in \"Note 1\" of that book as:\nRed rose growing in the meadow,\nyou vaunt yourself bravely\nbathed in crimson and carmine:\na rich and fragrant show.\nBut no: Being fair,\nYou will be unhappy soon.\nThe name of the central character, William of Baskerville, alludes both to the fictional detective Sherlock Holmes (compare \"The Hound of the Baskervilles\" – also, Adso's description of William in the beginning of the book resembles, almost word for word, Dr. Watson's description of Sherlock Holmes when he first makes his acquaintance in \"A Study in Scarlet\") and to William of Ockham (see the next section). The name of the narrator, his apprentice Adso of Melk is among other things a pun on Simplicio from Galileo Galilei's \"Dialogue\"; Adso deriving from \"ad Simplicio\" (\"to Simplicio\"). Adso's putative place of origin, Melk, is the site of a famous medieval library, at Melk Abbey. And his name echoes the narrator of the Sherlock Holmes stories, Watson (omitting the first and last latters, with \"t\" and \"d\" being phonetically similar).\n\nThe blind librarian Jorge of Burgos is a nod to Argentinian writer Jorge Luis Borges, a major influence on Eco. Borges was blind during his later years and was also director of Argentina's national library; his short story \"The Library of Babel\" is an inspiration for the secret library in Eco's book. Another of Borges's stories, \"The Secret Miracle\", features a blind librarian. In addition, a number of other themes drawn from various of Borges's works are used throughout \"The Name of the Rose\": labyrinths, mirrors, sects and obscure manuscripts and books.\n\nThe ending also owes a debt to Borges' short story \"Death and the Compass\", in which a detective proposes a theory for the behavior of a murderer. The murderer learns of the theory and uses it to trap the detective. In \"The Name of the Rose\", the librarian Jorge uses William's belief that the murders are based on the Revelation of John to misdirect William, though in Eco's tale, the detective succeeds in solving the crime.\n\nThe \"poisoned page\" motif may have been inspired by Alexandre Dumas' novel \"La Reine Margot\" (1845). It was also used in the film \"Il giovedì\" (1963) by Italian director Dino Risi. A similar story is associated with the Chinese erotic novel \"Jin Ping Mei\", translated as \"The Golden Lotus\" or \"The Plum in the Golden Vase\".\n\nEco seems also to have been aware of Rudyard Kipling's short story \"The Eye of Allah\", which touches on many of the same themes, like optics, manuscript illumination, music, medicine, priestly authority and the Church's attitude to scientific discovery and independent thought, and which also includes a character named John of Burgos.\n\nEco was also inspired by the 19th century Italian novelist Alessandro Manzoni, citing \"The Betrothed\" as an example of the specific type of historical novel he purposed to create, in which some of the characters may be made up, but their motivations and actions remain authentic to the period and render history more comprehensible.\n\nThroughout the book, there are Latin quotes, authentic and apocryphal. There are also discussions of the philosophy of Aristotle and of a variety of millenarist heresies, especially those associated with the fraticelli. Numerous other philosophers are referenced throughout the book, often anachronistically, including Wittgenstein.\n\nWilliam of Ockham, who lived during the time at which the novel is set, first put forward the principle known as Ockham's Razor, often summarised as the \"dictum\" that one should always accept as most likely the simplest explanation that accounts for all the facts (a method used by William of Baskerville in the novel).\n\nThe book describes monastic life in the 14th century. The action takes place at a Benedictine abbey during the controversy surrounding the Apostolic poverty between branches of Franciscans and Dominicans; (see renewed controversy on the question of poverty). The setting was inspired by monumental Saint Michael's Abbey in Susa Valley, Piedmont and visited by Umberto Eco. The Spirituals abhor wealth, bordering on the Apostolics or Dulcinian heresy. The book highlights this tension that existed within Christianity during the medieval era: the Spirituals, one faction within the Franciscan order, demanded that the Church should abandon all wealth, and some heretical sects began killing the well-to-do, while the majority of the Franciscans and the clergy took to a broader interpretation of the gospel. Also in the background is the conflict between Louis IV and Pope John XXII, with the Emperor supporting the Spirituals and the Pope condemning them.\n\nA number of the characters, such as the Inquisitor Bernard Gui, Ubertino of Casale and the Minorite Michael of Cesena, are historical figures, though the novel's characterization of them is not always historically accurate. Eco notes in a companion book that he had to situate the monastery in mountains so it would experience early frosts, in order for the action to take place at a time when the historical Bernard Gui could have been in the area. For the purposes of the plot, Eco needed a quantity of pig blood, but at that time pigs were not usually slaughtered until a frost had arrived. Later in the year, Gui was known to have been away from Italy and could not have participated in the events at the monastery.\n\nPart of the dialogue in the inquisition scene of the novel is lifted bodily from the historical Gui's own Manual for Inquisitors, the \"Practica Inquisitionis Heretice Pravitatis\", for example the dialogue: \"What do you believe?\" \"What do you believe, my Lord?\" \"I believe in all that the Creed teaches.\" \"So I believe, my Lord.\" Bernardo then points out that what Remigius the cellarer is saying is not that Remigius believes in the Creed, but that Remigius believes that \"Bernardo\" believes in the Creed. This is an example given by the historical Gui in his book to warn inquisitors against the slipperiness and manipulation of words by heretics. This use of Gui's own book by Eco is self-consciously of a piece with his perspective that \"books always speak of other books\". In this case, the author integrates the historical Bernard Gui's text into his own through the fictional character of Bernardo.\n\nAdso's description of the portal of the monastery is recognizably that of the portal of the church at Moissac, France. Dante Alighieri and his \"Comedy\" are mentioned once in passing. There is also a quick reference to a famous \"Umberto of Bologna\"—Umberto Eco himself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He co-edited the journals \"The Psychoanalytical Bulletin\", \"The Bulletin of Psychoanalysis\", etc. He was a forerunner (with V.S. Stepin) of the Minsk philosophical school \"Humanities Encyclopedia\". He is considered one of the founders of modern Belarusian sociology.\n\nIn 1969 he graduated from the historical department of the Belarusian State University (BSU). After finishing post-graduate study at the chair of philosophy of BSU he wrote his doctoral thesis \"Critical analysis of the personality theory of Freud's psychoanalytical system\" (1973, BSU). From 1972 to 1982 he worked as a lecturer, a senior lecturer, and an assistant professor of the chair of philosophy at the BSU.\n\nIn 1982-1983 he was an assistant professor of the chair of philosophy at the Refresher Institute for Lectures of Social Sciences of the BSU. From 1983-1987 he worked as an assistant professor of the chair of philosophy at the Refresher Institute for Lecturers of Social Sciences of Moscow State University, named after M.V. Lomonosov.\n\nIn 1987 he was an assistant professor and later a professor (1995) of the chair of philosophy at Moscow State Linguistic University. His doctoral thesis was \"Genesis, Foundations, Forms and Tendencies of Sociological Psychologism Development as a Phenomenon of Social Thought\" (1995, MSU).\n\nThe scientific achievements of V.Ocharenko connect sociological psychologism, the problems of personality and interpersonal relations, the contents and models of mind; history, the theory and methodology of psychoanalysis and post-freudism, the human dimensions of world history, alienation and humanism, the history of philosophy, sociology and psychology; metaphilosophy and methods of teaching philosophy.\n\nHe proved that the creation of the Western and Eastern versions of conceptual humanism were one of the first socially significant results of systematic philosophical activity in the Ancient world.\n\nHe researched paradigms and trends of classical and modern social thought. In 1990 he elaborated the foundations of the sociological psychologism— \"concept that regards action and interaction of social, group and individual psychical factors as a premise of research and explanation of social phenomena and processes\" .\n\nIn 1993 V.Ovcharenko initiated the campaign to return original documents and materials about the history of the Russian Psychoanalytical movement to Russia.\n\nIn 1994 he published the \"Psychoanalytical Glossary\" — the first Russian language edition of a dictionary and reference book on psychoanalysis that presented systematized data on the history of psychoanalysis, its ideas and leaders, terminology, founding documents, classical and modern schools and theories. He has marked out three principal stages in the development of classical psychoanalysis: 1) Clinical (1896—1905), 2) Psychological (1905—1913) and 3) Metaphysical (1913—1939).\n\nIn 1996 V.Ovcharenko worked out the first historical periods of the Russian psychoanalysis and psychoanalytical movement. With Russian psychoanalyst V.Leibin, he published \"The Anthology of Russian Psychoanalysis\" (in two volumes) describing the first century of Russian psychoanalytical ideas.\n\nV.Ovcharenko introduced the categories of \"sociological psychologism\", \"conceptual problematic complex\", \"conceptual problematic associations\", \"latent and contact world history\", \"dispersed rational sphere\", \"dispersed psychoanalytical sphere\", \"multibasisness of a person\", etc. He published about 1500 articles in different countries. These include more than 700 biographies of philosophers, sociologists, psychologists and psychoanalysts. He also wrote articles in Russian and foreign journals, encyclopedias and dictionaries.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Although also a utilitarian accessory, it is best known for its use in zazen Zen meditation.\n\nAlthough \"zafu\" is often translated as \"sewn seat\" in American English, the meaning of the Japanese kanji, 座蒲, is different. \"Za\" (座) means \"seat\", and \"fu\" (蒲) means reedmace (cattail, \"Typha\" spp.). A \"zafu\" is a seat stuffed with the fluffy, soft, downy fibres of the disintegrating reedmace seed heads. The Japanese zafu originates in China, where these meditation seats were originally filled with reedmace down.\n\nThe words \"zabuton\", \"zafuton\" and \"futon\" are closely linked. The word \"zazen\" meaning \"seated meditation\" or \"sitting meditation\" is also closely linked. In western terms, colloquially speaking, \"zafu\" refers to a meditation cushion, and \"zabuton\" refers to the cushioned mat upon which a zafu is placed.\n\nTypical zafus are about in diameter, and often about high when fluffed.\nContemporary zafus are sewn from three pieces of heavy cloth, usually colored black: two round swatches of equal size for the top and the bottom of the cushion, and a long rectangle that is sewn into gathers in between. They are typically filled with either kapok (a fluffy plant fibre, similar to Typha) or buckwheat hulls. Zen Buddhist practitioners traditionally sit on a zafu when engaged in sitting meditation. The cushion raises the hips, making the entire range of cross-legged sitting positions more stable for the meditator.\n\nBefore and after practicing zazen, Zen practitioners perform a gassho bow to the zafu, to fellow practitioners, and to the teacher. In many practice places, there is a prescribed form for respectfully handling zafu while walking in the meditation hall, or zendo.\nA zabuton (, ) is a rectangular cushion, about by , that is often used under a zafu cushion to provide comfort and support when engaged in zazen. The outer cover is typically made of a heavy duty fabric and has a zipper along one side so that it can be easily removed and washed. Inside the cover, the batting is enclosed in a natural cotton casing.\n"}
