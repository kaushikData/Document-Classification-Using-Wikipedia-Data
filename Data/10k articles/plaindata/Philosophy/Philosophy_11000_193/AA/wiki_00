It challenges previously widespread belief that only \"a priori\" knowledge can be necessary. It draws on a number of philosophical concepts such as necessity, the causal theory of reference, rigidity, and the a priori a posteriori distinction.\n\nIt was first introduced by philosopher Saul Kripke in his 1970 series of lectures at Princeton University. The transcript of these lectures was then compiled and assembled into his seminal book, \"Naming and Necessity\".\n\nHere is an overview of the argument:\n\nOther instances of a posteriori necessary truths include: \"H2O is water\".\n\nNaming and necessity is among the most important philosophical works of the 20th century. The prospect of a posteriori necessity also makes the distinction between a prioricity, analyticity, and necessity harder to discern because they were previously thought to be largely separated from the a posteriori, the synthetic, and the contingent. With the example “Hesperus is Phosphorus”, Kripke seems to have provided a successful counter-example to the Kantian claims:\n\n(a) \"P\" is a priori iff \"P\" is necessary.\n\n(b) \"P\" is a posteriori iff \"P\" is contingent.\n\nHilary Putnam comments on the significance of Kripke’s counter-examples, \n\"Since Kant there has been a big split between philosophers who thought that all necessary truths were analytic and philosophers who thought that some necessary truths were synthetic a priori. But none of these philosophers thought that a (metaphysically) necessary truth could fail to be a priori.” \n\n"}

{"id": "13127539", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13127539", "title": "Advice (opinion)", "text": "Advice (opinion)\n\nAdvice (also called exhortation) is a form of relating personal or institutional opinions, belief systems, values, recommendations or guidance about certain situations relayed in some context to another person, group or party often offered as a guide to action and/or conduct. Put a little more simply, an advice message is a recommendation about what might be thought, said, or otherwise done to address a problem, make a decision, or manage a situation.\n\nAdvice is believed to be theoretical, and is often considered taboo as well as helpful. The kinds of advice can range from systems of instructional and practical toward more esoteric and spiritual, and is often attributable toward problem solving, strategy seeking, and solution finding, either from a social standpoint or a personal one. Advice may pertain to relationships, lifestyle changes, legal choices, business goals, personal goals, career goals, education goals, religious beliefs, personal growth, motivation, inspiration and so on. Advice is not pertinent to any solid criteria, and may be given freely, or only given when asked upon. In some cultures advice is socially unacceptable to be released unless requested. In other cultures advice is given more openly. It may, especially if it is expert advice such as legal advice or methodological advice also be given only in exchange for payment.\n\nMany expressions and quotations have been used to describe the status of advice, whether given, or received. One such expression is \"Advice is what we ask for when we already know the answer but wish we didn't.\" (Erica Jong, How to Save Your Own Life, 1977). Advice is like water, you drink it to replenish your soul. This particular quotation pertains the belief system that states that the answers to one's questions are within themselves, and do not come from any external stimuli. The accuracy of this particular belief is often disputed among theologians, philosophers, etc. However, a person who would hold such a belief, would \"advise\" another person to seek the answers out from within one's own esoteric and inner spiritual natures.\n\nAdvice when adhered to and followed may be beneficial, non-beneficial, damaging, non-damaging, partially beneficial and partially damaging, in reference to personal or social paradigms. In other words, not all advice is either \"all good\" or \"all bad\". Many people consider unrequested advice to be paternalistic and patronizing and are thus offended.\n\nTherefore, some people may come to the conclusion that advice is morally better to be left out of the equation altogether, and this theory is included within the following quote (author unknown): \"The best advice is this: Don't take advice and don't give advice.\" Yet, often in society advice has been helpful. A more day to day example would be \"eat your vegetables\" or \"don't drink and drive.\" If this advice is adhered to we can see that the benefits would outweigh the consequences.\n\nGrammatically speaking, advice is an uncountable noun, like rice or milk. Clicheing or using a cliche, refers to mainstream advice that is overused.\n\nAdvice-taking and advice-giving are of interest to researchers in the disciplines of psychology, economics, judgment and decision-making, organizational behavior and human resources, and human communication, among others.\n\nIn psychology, seminal articles include Brehmer and Hagafors (1986), Hollenbeck et al. (1995), and Sniezek and Buckley (1995). The Sniezek and Buckley (1995) and Hollenbeck et al. (1995) articles, in particular, introduced researchers to standardized ways of studying advice in the laboratory. The psychological literature on advice-giving and advice-taking was reviewed by Bonaccio and Dalal (2006), and a portion of this literature was also reviewed by Humphrey et al. (2002).\n\nCommunication researchers have tended to study advice as part of their research on supportive communication. Much research has focused on gender differences (and similarities) in the provision and receipt of supportive communication.\n\nIn economics, the willingness of entrepreneurs to take advice from early investors and other partners (i.e., entrepreneurial \"coachability\") has long been considered a critical factor in entrepreneurial success. At the same time, some economists have argued that entrepreneurs should not simply act on all advice given to them, even when that advice comes from well-informed sources, because the entrepreneurs themselves possess far deeper and richer local knowledge about their own firm than any outsider. Indeed, measures of advice-taking are \"not\" actually predictive of subsequent entrepreneurial success (e.g., measured as success in subsequent funding rounds, acquisitions, pivots, and firm survival).\n\nIn the social sciences in general, and in psychological research in particular, advice has typically been defined as a recommendation to do something. For example, in response to a client's question regarding whether to invest in stocks, bonds, or T-notes, a financial planner (the advisor) might say: \"I recommend going with bonds at this time.\" However, Dalal and Bonaccio (2010) have argued, based on a review of the research literature, that such a definition is incomplete and leaves out several important types of advice These authors have provided the following taxonomy of advice:\nOf these four types of advice (and socio-emotional support, which is a related form of interpersonal assistance that often accompanies advice), Dalal and Bonaccio (2010) found that decision-makers reacted most favorably to the provision of information, because this form of advice not only increased decision accuracy but also allowed the decision-maker to maintain autonomy.\n\nMethodological advice concerns expert advice on research methodology. This kind of advice is, as opposed to some forms of advising mentioned above, usually initiated by the person who receives the advice, thus not unrequested. The goal of the advisor (see statistical consultant) is to guarantee the quality of research undertaken by his client, a researcher, by providing sound methodological advice. The advice may take different forms. In some cases the advisor collaborates with a researcher in a more long-term process, and guides him through the more technical parts of the research (this type of advising is called longitudinal consultancy). In complex, longterm projects it is not uncommon for the advisor to help by doing part of the work him or herself (interactive consultancy). In other cases a researcher may have a specific question that can be answered in a brief conversation with a consultant (cross-sectional consultancy, or advisory consulting). The advisors role can also take a didactic form, when the client is not familiar with suggested (statistical) methods. Sometimes the best advice is not statistically ideal, but is comprehensible for the client.\n\nDepending on the function of the methodological advisor, the advice that is given may not be free. If a student conducts research commissioned by a professor, this professor will probably help this student for free, if needed. However, if a researcher contacts an independent advisor, this probably costs him/her. In this case the methodological advisor is basically being hired by the researcher. In other cases the advisor may be incorporated into research team, leading to co-authorship. It is advisable to make clear agreements about the advisors compensation on fore hand.\n\nResearchers may seek advice on a wide range of subjects concerning their research. One of the major tasks of the methodological advisor is to help his clients think about what they really want to accomplish. This may involve helping them to (re)formulate the research question and relatedly, the research hypothesis (see scientific hypothesis). Clients may also seek advice on the construction of a measurement instrument (for instance a psychological test). Or, they may want to know how to implement an appropriate research design. Often questions arise on how to analyze the data (see data analysis), and how to interpret and report the results (see scientific publishing).\n\nA researcher will usually know more about the field in which the study is conducted than the methodological advisor. The advisor on the other hand will know more about the method. By combining their expertise and, through dialog and cooperation, researcher and consultant may achieve better, more reliable results.\n\n"}

The family came to Australia in 1864 on account of the father's health, and Alexander at 14 years of age became a pupil-teacher with the education department at Sydney.\n\nComing to Melbourne in 1870 he first taught at Hawthorn Grammar School and then entered on the arts course at the University. He maintained himself largely by scholarships and graduated with honours in 1874. For two years he was a mathematical master at Scotch College, Melbourne, and in 1877 founded Carlton College. He was an excellent schoolmaster, and the school was so successful that 15 years later he felt himself able to retire and devote himself to literature.\n\nThe banking crisis of 1893, however, affected his position so much, that he was obliged to do a great deal of journalism for the \"Argus\" and \"Australasian\". Sutherland did a large amount of literary work. He was responsible for the first volume only of \"Victoria and its Metropolis\", published in 1888, an interesting history of the first 50 years of the state of Victoria. In 1890 he published \"Thirty Short Poems\", the cultured verse of an experienced literary man, but his most important book was \"The Origin and Growth of the Moral Instinct\", which appeared in 1898 in two volumes. Sutherland had long brooded over this book and was greatly pleased at receiving the commendation of some of the leaders of philosophic thought in England. Generally the book was well received both in Europe and the United States. With his brother, George Sutherland, he wrote a short \"History of Australia\", which attained a sale of 120,000 copies, and he collaborated with Henry Gyles Turner in a useful volume, \"The Development of Australian Literature\" (1898). His undoubted powers as a teacher gave value to his text book, \"A New Geography\", and other works of that kind. He contributed on scientific subjects to the Nineteenth Century, and did a large amount of lecturing on literature and science in Melbourne.\n\nIn 1897 he became a candidate for parliament, but his methods were too guileless and straightforward to ensure success . In 1898, he went to London as representative of the South Australian Register, but found the climate oppressed him and returned to Australia towards the end of 1899. He continued his journalistic work in Melbourne, and in March 1901 was an unsuccessful candidate for the southern Melbourne seat in the first federal parliament. Soon afterwards he was appointed by the council of the University of Melbourne to the position of registrar.\n\nThe university was passing through a difficult time after a period of slack administration, and Sutherland had to work very hard. On the death of Professor Morris while away on leave in Europe, Sutherland took over his lectures on English literature. The burden of the extra work was too great for Sutherland who did not have a strong constitution, and he died suddenly on 9 August 1902. His widow, a son and three daughters survived him. His daughter, Margaret Sutherland, became well known as a musician and composer.\n\n"}

It is one of the many names of Lord Vishnu. Ananta is the Shesha-naga, the celestial snake, on which Lord Vishnu reclines.\n\nIn the Mahabharata, Ananta or Adi-sesa, the serpent, or Vasuki, is the son of Kasyapa, one of the Prajapatis, through Kadru as her eldest son. Kadru had asked her sons to stay suspended in the hair of Airavata’s tail who on refusing to do so were cursed to die at the serpent-yajna of Janamejaya. Ananta was saved by Brahma who directed him to go to the nether world and support the world on his hoods, and thus became the king of the Nagas in Patala. Rudra, who consumes the three worlds, is believed to have emanated from the face of Ananta. By the grace of Ananta, Garga was able to master the sciences of astronomy and causation. Vishnu reposes on Ananta floating on the ocean of eternal existence sheltered by his hoods. Ananta is an epithet of Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva, Skanda, Krishna, Balarama, earth, and the letter A. Ananta also appears in the Buddhist iconography as one of three female deities emanating from Dhyani Buddha Amitabha.\n\nAnanta is that which is without destruction because it is not subject to the six modifications such as birth, growth, death etc. According to the Vedanta School, the term Ananta used in the phrase “ \"anadi\" (begininngless) \"ananta\" (endless) \"akhanda\" (unbroken) \"sat-chit-ananda\" (being-consciousness-bliss)” refers to the Infinite, the single non-dual reality. It denotes Brahman as one of its six attributes which are \"prajna\", \"priyam\", \"satyam\", \"ananta\", \"ananda\" and \"stithi\" which manifest themselves in space which is common to all six as the basis. It denotes the infinite causal energy of the Creator, the energy in the form of \"chaitanya\" that has no end. There exist four types of objects or categories – 1) \"Nitya\", which has no beginning or an end, 2) \"Anitya\", which has a beginning and end, 3) \"Anadi\", which has no beginning but has an end and 4) \"Ananta\", which has a beginning but no end.Brahman has no initial cause and is known as \"anadikarana\", the uncreated who is not a product, which means Brahman has no material cause and is not the material cause of anything. Ananta is the infinite space, the infinite space is Brahman.\n\nAccording to the Yoga School, Ananta is the serpent of infinity who eavesdropped on the secret teaching that was being imparted to Goddess Parvati by Lord Shiva; the secret teaching was Yoga. On being apprehended Ananta was sentenced by Lord Shiva to impart that teaching to human beings for which purpose Ananta assumed the human form and was called Patanjali. In his Yoga Sutras, Patanjali stresses upon the use of breath to achieve perfection in posture which entails steadiness and comfort, by making an effort, the effort meant is the effort of breathing. The effort of breathing has been highlighted by the term, Ananta, in Sutra 2.47. Ananta was called Patanjali because he desired to teach Yoga to human beings, he fell from heaven to earth landing in the palm of a virtuous woman named Gonika.\n\nAccording to Jainism the pure soul of each life form is \"Ananta-gyana\" (Endless Knowledge), \"Ananta-darshana\" (Endless Perception), \"Ananta-caritra\" (Endless Consciousness) and \"Ananta-sukha\" (Endless Bliss). The 14th of the 24 Jain Tirathankaras is known as Ananta or Anant Nath.\n"}

{"id": "1889289", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1889289", "title": "Character displacement", "text": "Character displacement\n\nCharacter displacement is the phenomenon where differences among similar species whose distributions overlap geographically are accentuated in regions where the species co-occur, but are minimized or lost where the species’ distributions do not overlap. This pattern results from evolutionary change driven by biological competition among species for a limited resource (e.g. food). The rationale for character displacement stems from the competitive exclusion principle, also called Gause's Law, which contends that to coexist in a stable environment two competing species must differ in their respective ecological niche; without differentiation, one species will eliminate or exclude the other through competition.\n\nCharacter displacement was first explicitly explained by William L. Brown Jr. and E. O. Wilson in 1956: \"Two closely related species have overlapping ranges. In the parts of the ranges where one species occurs alone, the populations of that species are similar to the other species and may even be very difficult to distinguish from it. In the area of overlap, where the two species occur together, the populations are more divergent and easily distinguished, i.e., they 'displace' one another in one or more characters. The characters involved can be morphological, ecological, behavioral, or physiological; they are assumed to be genetically based.\"\n\nBrown and Wilson used the term character displacement to refer to instances of both reproductive character displacement, or reinforcement of reproductive barriers, and ecological character displacement driven by competition. As the term character displacement is commonly used, it generally refers to morphological differences due to competition. Brown and Wilson viewed character displacement as a phenomenon involved in speciation, stating, \"we believe that it is a common aspect of geographical speciation, arising most often as a product of the genetic and ecological interaction of two (or more) newly evolved, cognate species [derived from the same immediate parental species] during their period of first contact.\" While character displacement is important in various scenarios of speciation, including adaptive radiations like the cichlid fish faunas in the rift lakes of East Africa, it also plays an important role in structuring communities. It also plays a role in speciation by reinforcement in such that allopatric populations overlapping in sympatry exhibit greater trait divergence. The results of numerous studies contribute evidence that character displacement often influences the evolution of resource acquisition among members of an ecological guild.\n\nCompetitive release, defined as the expansion of an ecological niche in the absence of a competitor, is essentially the mirror image of character displacement. It too was described by Brown and Wilson: “Two closely related species are distinct where they occur together, but where one member of the pair occurs alone it converges toward the second, even to the extent of being nearly identical with it in some characters.”\n\n“Character displacement is the situation in which, when two species of animals overlap geographically, the differences between them are accentuated in the zone of sympatry and weakened or lost entirely in the parts of their ranges outside this zone”. While the term “ecological character displacement” first appeared in the scientific literature in 1956, the idea has earlier roots. For example, Joseph Grinnell, in the classic paper that set forth the concept of the ecological niche, stated, “It is, of course, axiomatic that no two species regularly established in a single fauna have precisely the same niche requirements.” The existence of character displacement is evidence that the two species do not completely overlap in their niche requirement.\n\nFollowing the dissemination of the concept, character displacement was viewed as an important force in structuring ecological communities, and biologists identified numerous examples. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, however, the role of competition and character displacement in structuring communities was questioned and its importance greatly downgraded. Many found the early examples unconvincing and suggested it to be a rare phenomenon. Criticisms with earlier studies included the lack of rigor in statistical analyses and the use of poorly rationalized characters. Additionally, theory seemed to indicate that the conditions that allowed character displacement to occur were limited. This scrutiny helped motivate theoretical and methodological advances as well as the development of a more rigorous framework for testing character displacement.\n\nSix criteria have been developed to establish character displacement as the mechanism for differences between sympatric species. These include: (1) differences between sympatric taxa are greater than expected by chance; (2) differences in character states are related to differences in resource use; (3) resources are limiting, and interspecific competition for these resources is a function of character similarity; (4) resource distribution are the same in sympatry and allopatry such that differences in character states are not due to differences in resource availability; (5) differences must have evolved in situ; (6) differences must be genetically based. Rigorously testing these criteria necessitates a synthetic approach, combining areas of research like community ecology, functional morphology, adaptation, quantitative genetics and phylogenetic systematics, While satisfying all six criteria in a single study of character displacement is not often feasible, they provide the necessary context for researching character displacement.\n\nCharacter displacement has indicated to be a major factor in beak size among finches located in the Galápagos Islands and Hawaiian Islands.\n\nStudies have been performed in a wide variety of taxa—a few groups having disproportionately contributed to the understanding of character displacement: mammalian carnivores, Galapagos finches, anole lizards on islands, three-spined stickleback fish, and snails.\n\nIn the initial explication of character displacement, many of the examples set forth as potential evidence for character displacement were observations between multiple pairs of birds. These included rock nuthatches in Asia, Australian honeyeaters of the genus \"Myzantha\", Australian parrots, shearwaters in the Cape Verde Islands, flycatchers of the Bismarck Archipelago and notably, Darwin's finches in the Galapagos. David Lack found that when the two species \"Geospiza fortis\" and \"G. fuliginosa\" occurred on large islands together, they could be distinguished unequivocally by beak size. When either one occurred by itself on a smaller island, however, the beak size was intermediate in size relative to when the two co-occurred. Similarly, Peter and Rosemary Grant found that a \"Geospiza fortis\" island population diverged in beak size (due to high mortality) from competitor \"G. magnirostris\" in a year with low food supply, apparently due to increased competition for larger seeds that both species fed on. Most character displacement studies focus on morphological differences in feeding apparatus rather than on those relating to habitat use. However, comparisons of micro-habitat use and morphological adaptations of Western and Eastern Rock Nuthatches indicate that these two species show spatial niche segregation in addition to trophic niche segregation.\n\nIt is often assumed that closely related species are more likely to compete than are more distantly related species, and hence many researchers investigate character displacement among species in the same genus. While character displacement was originally discussed in the context of very closely related species, evidence suggests that even interactions among distantly related species can result in character displacement. Finches and bees in the Galapagos provide support for this. Two finch species (\"Geospiza fuliginosa\" and \"G. difficilis\") exploit more flower nectar on islands where the lager carpenter bee (\"Xylocopa darwini\") is absent than on islands with the bees. Individual finches that harvest nectar are smaller than members of the same species that do not.\n\nThe lizard genus \"Anolis\" on the islands in the Caribbean has also been the subject of numerous studies investigating the role of competition and character displacement in community structure. Lesser Antilles islands can only support \"Anolis\" species of different sizes, and the relative importance of character displacement versus size at colonization in determining invasion success has been explored and debated.\n\nThe Appalachian salamanders \"Plethodon hoffmani\" and \"P. cinereus\" display no morphological differences, eating habits, or resource use exploitation differences among allopatric populations; when the species occurs in sympatry; however, they exhibit morphological differentiation that is associated with segregation in prey size. Where these two species co-occur, \"P. hoffmani\" has a faster closing jaw required for larger prey, and \"P. cinereus\" has a slower, stronger jaw for smaller prey. Other studies have found \"Plethodon\" salamander species that demonstrate character displacement from aggressive behavioral interference rather than exploitation. That is, morphological character displacement between the two species is due to aggressive interaction between them rather than the exploitation of different food resources.\n\nOn Okinawa Island, the snail species \"Satsuma largillierti\" lives on the eastern half of the island, while \"Satsuma eucosmia\" lives on the eastern half. Both populations overlap in sympatry along the middle of the island, where the penis length of the species differs significantly wherer they meet in sympatry. The snails' penis lengths exhibit divergence, suggesting reproductive character displacement of this trait.\n\nThreespine sticklebacks (\"Gasterosteus\" spp.) in post-glacial lakes in western Canada have contributed significantly to recent research of character displacement. Both observations of natural populations and manipulative experiments show that when two recently evolved species occur in a single lake, two morphologies are selected for: a limnetic form that feeds in open water and a benthic form that feeds at the lake bottom. They differ in size, shape and the number and length of gill rakers, all of which is related to divergence in their diet. Hybrids between the two forms are selected against. When only one species inhabits a lake, that fish displays an intermediate morphology. Studies on other fish species have shown similar patterns of selection for benthic and limnetic morphologies, which can also lead to sympatric speciation.\n\nIntroduced species have also provided recent “natural experiments” to investigate how rapidly character displacement can affect evolutionary change. When American mink (\"Mustela vison\") were introduced in north-eastern Belarus, the native European mink (\"Mustela lutreola\") increased in size, and the introduced mink decreased in size. This displacement was observed within a ten-year study, demonstrating that competition can drive rapid evolutionary change.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8199", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8199", "title": "Denis Diderot", "text": "Denis Diderot\n\nDenis Diderot (; 5 October 171331 July 1784) was a French philosopher, art critic, and writer, best known for serving as co-founder, chief editor, and contributor to the \"Encyclopédie\" along with Jean le Rond d'Alembert. He was a prominent figure during the Enlightenment.\n\nDiderot began his education by obtaining a Master of Arts degree in philosophy at a Jesuit college in 1732. He considered working in the church clergy before briefly studying law. When he decided to become a writer in 1734, his father disowned him for not entering one of the learned professions. He lived a bohemian existence for the next decade. He befriended philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau in 1742.\n\nThough his work was broad as well as rigorous, it did not bring Diderot riches. He secured none of the posts that were occasionally given to needy men of letters; he could not even obtain the bare official recognition of merit that was implied by being chosen a member of the Académie française. He saw no alternative to selling his library to provide a dowry for his daughter. Empress Catherine II of Russia heard of his financial troubles and commissioned an agent in Paris to buy the library. She then requested that the philosopher retain the books in Paris until she required them, and act as her librarian with a yearly salary. Between October 1773 and March 1774, the sick Diderot spent a few months at the empress's court in Saint Petersburg.\n\nDiderot died of pulmonary thrombosis in Paris on 31 July 1784, and was buried in the city's Église Saint-Roch. His heirs sent his vast library to Catherine II, who had it deposited at the National Library of Russia. He has several times been denied burial in the Panthéon with other French notables. The French government considered memorializing him in this fashion on the 300th anniversary of his birth, but this did not come to pass.\n\nDiderot's literary reputation during his lifetime rested primarily on his plays and his contributions to the \"Encyclopédie\"; many of his most important works, including \"Jacques the Fatalist, Rameau's Nephew\", \"Paradox of the Actor\", and \"D'Alembert's Dream\", were published only after his death.\n\nDenis Diderot was born in Langres, Champagne. His parents were Didier Diderot (1685–1759) a cutler, \"maître coutelier\", and his wife Angélique Vigneron (1677–1748). Three of five siblings survived to adulthood, Denise Diderot (1715–1797) and their youngest brother Pierre-Didier Diderot (1722–1787), and finally their sister Angélique Diderot (1720–1749). According to Arthur McCandless Wilson, Denis Diderot greatly admired his sister Denise, sometimes referring to her as \"a female Socrates\".\n\nDiderot began his formal education at a Jesuit college in Langres, earning a Master of Arts degree in philosophy in 1732. He then entered the Collège d'Harcourt of the University of Paris. He abandoned the idea of entering the clergy and decided to study at the Paris Law Faculty. His study of law was short-lived however and in 1734, he decided to become a writer. Because of his refusal to enter one of the learned professions, he was disowned by his father, and for the next ten years he lived a bohemian existence.\n\nIn 1742, he befriended Jean-Jacques Rousseau. In 1743, he further alienated his father by marrying Antoinette Champion (1710–1796), a devout Roman Catholic. The match was considered inappropriate due to Champion's low social standing, poor education, fatherless status, and lack of a dowry. She was about three years older than Diderot. The marriage, in October 1743, produced one surviving child, a girl. Her name was Angélique, named after both Diderot's dead mother and sister. The death of his sister, a nun, in her convent may have affected Diderot's opinion of religion. She is assumed to have been the inspiration for his novel about a nun, \"La Religieuse\", in which he depicts a woman who is forced to enter a convent where she suffers at the hands of the other nuns in the community.\n\nDiderot had affairs with Mlle. Babuti (who would marry Greuze), Madeleine de Puisieux, Sophie Volland and Mme de Maux. His letters to Sophie Volland are known for their candor and are regarded to be \"among the literary treasures of the eighteenth century\".\n\nDiderot's earliest works included a translation of Temple Stanyan's \"History of Greece\" (1743); with two colleagues, François-Vincent Toussaint and Marc-Antoine Eidous, he produced a translation of Robert James's \"Medicinal Dictionary\" (1746–1748). In 1745, he published a translation of Shaftesbury's \"Inquiry Concerning Virtue and Merit\", to which he had added his own \"reflections\".\n\nIn 1746, Diderot wrote his first original work: the \"Philosophical Thoughts\" (French:\"Pensées philosophiques\"). In this book, Diderot argued for a reconciliation of reason with feeling so as to establish harmony. According to Diderot, without feeling there is a detrimental effect on virtue, and no possibility of creating sublime work. However, since feeling without discipline can be destructive, reason is necessary to control feeling.\n\nAt the time Diderot wrote this book he was a deist. Hence there is a defense of deism in this book, and some arguments against atheism. The book also contains criticism of Christianity.\n\nIn 1747, Diderot wrote \"The Skeptic's Walk\" (French:\"Promenade du sceptique\") in which a deist, an atheist, and a pantheist have a dialogue on the nature of divinity. The deist gives the argument from design. The atheist says that the universe is better explained by physics, chemistry, matter, and motion. The pantheist says that the cosmic unity of mind and matter, which are co-eternal and comprise the universe, is God. This work remained unpublished till 1830. The local police—warned by the priests of another attack on Christianity—either seized the manuscript, or authorities forced Diderot give an undertaking that he would not publish this work, according to different versions of what happened.\n\nIn 1748, Diderot needed to raise money on short notice. He had become a father through his wife, and his mistress Mme. de Puisieux was making financial demands from him. At this time, Diderot had stated to Mme. de Puisieux that writing a novel was a trivial task, whereupon she challenged him to write a novel. In response, Diderot wrote his novel \"The Indiscreet Jewels\" (French:\"Les bijoux indiscrets\"). The book is about the magical ring of a Sultan which induces any woman's \"discreet jewels\" to confess their sexual experiences when the ring is pointed at them. In all, the ring is pointed at thirty different women in the book—usually at a dinner or a social meeting—with the Sultan typically being visible to the woman. However, since the ring has the additional property of making its owner invisible when required, a few of the sexual experiences recounted are through direct observation with the Sultan making himself invisible and placing his person in the unsuspecting woman's boudoir.\n\nBesides the bawdiness there are several digressions into philosophy, music, and literature in the book. In one such philosophical digression, the Sultan has a dream in which he sees a child named \"Experiment\" growing bigger and stronger till it demolishes an ancient temple named \"Hypothesis\". The book proved to be lucrative for Diderot even though it could only be sold clandestinely. It is Diderot's most published work.\n\nThe book is believed to be an imitation of .\n\nDiderot would keep writing on science in a desultory way all his life. The scientific work of which he was most proud was \"Memoires sur differents sujets de mathematique\" (1748). This work contains original ideas on acoustics, tension, air resistance, and \"a project for a new organ\" which could be played by all. Some of Diderot's scientific works were applauded by contemporary publications of his time like \"The Gentleman's Magazine\", the \"Journal des savants\"; and the Jesuit publication \"Journal de Trevoux,\" which invited more such work: \"on the part of a man as clever and able as M. Diderot seems to be, of whom we should also observe that his style is as elegant, trenchant, and unaffected as it is lively and ingenious.\"\n\nDiderot's celebrated \"Letter on the Blind\" (\"Lettre sur les aveugles à l'usage de ceux qui voient\") (1749) introduced him to the world as an original thinker. The subject is a discussion of the interrelation between man's reason and the knowledge acquired through perception (the five senses). The title of his book also evoked some ironic doubt about who exactly were \"the blind\" under discussion. In the essay, blind English mathematician Nicholas Saunderson argues that, since knowledge derives from the senses, mathematics is the only form of knowledge that both he and a sighted person can agree on. It is suggested that the blind could be taught to read through their sense of touch. (A later essay, \"Lettre sur les sourds et muets\", considered the case of a similar deprivation in the deaf and mute.) According to Jonathan Israel, what makes the \"Lettre sur les aveugles\" so remarkable, however, is its distinct, if undeveloped, presentation of the theory of variation and natural selection.\n\nThis powerful essay, for which La Mettrie expressed warm appreciation in 1751, revolves around a remarkable deathbed scene in which a dying blind philosopher, Saunderson, rejects the arguments of a deist clergyman who endeavours to win him round to a belief in a providential God during his last hours. Saunderson's arguments are those of a neo-Spinozist Naturalist and fatalist, using a sophisticated notion of the self-generation and natural evolution of species without Creation or supernatural intervention. The notion of \"thinking matter\" is upheld and the \"argument from design\" discarded (following La Mettrie) as hollow and unconvincing. The work appeared anonymously in Paris in June 1749, and was vigorously suppressed by the authorities. Diderot, who had been under police surveillance since 1747, was swiftly identified as the author, had his manuscripts confiscated, and was imprisoned for some months, under a \"lettre de cachet\", on the outskirts of Paris, in the dungeons at Vincennes where he was visited almost daily by Rousseau, at the time his closest and most assiduous ally.\n\nVoltaire wrote an enthusiastic letter to Diderot commending the \"Lettre\" and stating that he had held Diderot in high regard for a long time to which Diderot had sent a warm response. Soon after this, Diderot was arrested.\n\nScience historian Conway Zirkle has written that Diderot was an early evolutionary thinker and noted that his passage that described natural selection was \"so clear and accurate that it almost seems that we would be forced to accept his conclusions as a logical necessity even in the absence of the evidence collected since his time.\"\n\nAngered by public resentment over the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, the government started incarcerating many of its critics. It was decided at this time to rein in Diderot. On 23 July 1749, the governor of the Vincennes fortress instructed the police to incarcerate Diderot, and the next day he was arrested and placed in solitary confinement in the Vincennes. He had been permitted to retain one book that he had in his possession at the time of his arrest, \"Paradise Lost\", which he read during his incarceration. He wrote notes and annotations on the book, using a toothpick as a pen, and ink that he made by scraping slate from the walls and mixing it with wine.\n\nIn August 1749, Mme du Chatelet, presumably at Voltaire's behest, wrote to the governor of Vincennes, who was her kinsman, pleading that Diderot be lodged more comfortably while jailed. The governor then offered Diderot access to the great halls of the Vincennes castle and the freedom to receive books and visitors providing he would write a document of submission. On 13 August 1749, Diderot wrote to the governor:\n\nOn 20 August, Diderot was lodged in a comfortable room in the Vincennes, allowed to meet visitors, and to walk in the gardens of the Vincennes. On 23 August, Diderot signed another letter promising to never leave the Vincennes without permission. On 3 November 1749, Diderot was released from the Vincennes. Subsequently, in 1750, he released the prospectus for the \"Encyclopédie\".\n\nAndré le Breton, a bookseller and printer, approached Diderot with a project for the publication of a translation of Ephraim Chambers' \"Cyclopaedia, or Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences\" into French, first undertaken by the Englishman John Mills, and followed by the German Gottfried Sellius. Diderot accepted the proposal, and transformed it. He persuaded Le Breton to publish a new work, which would consolidate ideas and knowledge from the Republic of Letters. The publishers found capital for a larger enterprise than they had first planned. Jean le Rond d'Alembert was persuaded to become Diderot's colleague, and permission was procured from the government.\n\nIn 1750 an elaborate prospectus announced the project, and in 1751 the first volume was published. This work was unorthodox and advanced for the time. Diderot stated that \"An encyclopedia ought to make good the failure to execute such a project hitherto, and should encompass not only the fields already covered by the academies, but each and every branch of human knowledge.\" Comprehensive knowledge will give \"the power to change men's common way of thinking.\" The work combined scholarship with information on trades. Diderot emphasized the abundance of knowledge within each subject area. Everyone would benefit from these insights.\n\nDiderot's work, however, was mired in controversy from the beginning; the project was suspended by the courts in 1752. Just as the second volume was completed accusations arose regarding seditious content, concerning the editor's entries on religion and natural law. Diderot was detained and his house was searched for manuscripts for subsequent articles: but the search proved fruitless as no manuscripts could be found. They were hidden in the house of an unlikely confederate—Chretien de Lamoignon Malesherbes, who originally ordered the search. Although Malesherbes was a staunch absolutist, and loyal to the monarchy - he was sympathetic to the literary project. Along with his support, and that of other well-placed influential confederates, the project resumed. Diderot returned to his efforts only to be constantly embroiled in controversy.\n\nThese twenty years were to Diderot not merely a time of incessant drudgery, but harassing persecution and desertion of friends. The ecclesiastical party detested the \"Encyclopédie\", in which they saw a rising stronghold for their philosophic enemies. By 1757 they could endure it no longer - the subscribers had grown from 2,000 to 4,000, a measure of the growth of the work in popular influence and power. Diderot wanted the \"Encyclopédie\" to give all the knowledge of the world to the people of France. However, the \"Encyclopédie\" threatened the governing social classes of France (aristocracy) because it took for granted the justice of religious tolerance, freedom of thought, and the value of science and industry. It asserted the doctrine that the main concern of the nation's government ought to be the nation's common people. It was believed that the \"Encyclopédie\" was the work of an organized band of conspirators against society, and that the dangerous ideas they held were made truly formidable by their open publication. In 1759, the \"Encyclopédie\" was formally suppressed. The decree did not stop the work, which went on, but its difficulties increased by the necessity of being clandestine. Jean le Rond d'Alembert withdrew from the enterprise and other powerful colleagues, including Anne Robert Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune, declined to contribute further to a book which had acquired a bad reputation.\n\nDiderot was left to finish the task as best he could. He wrote several hundred articles, some very slight, but many of them laborious, comprehensive, and long. He damaged his eyesight correcting proofs and editing the manuscripts of less competent contributors. He spent his days at workshops, mastering manufacturing processes, and his nights writing what he had learned during the day. He was incessantly harassed by threats of police raids. The last copies of the first volume were issued in 1765.\n\nIn 1764, when his immense work was drawing to an end, he encountered a crowning mortification: he discovered that the bookseller, Le Breton, fearing the government's displeasure, had struck out from the proof sheets, after they had left Diderot's hands, all passages that he considered too dangerous. \"He and his printing-house overseer,\" writes Furbank, \"had worked in complete secrecy, and had moreover deliberately destroyed the author's original manuscript so that the damage could not be repaired.\" The monument to which Diderot had given the labor of twenty long and oppressive years was irreparably mutilated and defaced. It was 12 years, in 1772, before the subscribers received the final 28 folio volumes of the \"Encyclopédie, ou dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers\" since the first volume had been published.\n\nAlthough the \"Encyclopédie\" was Diderot's most monumental product, he was the author of many other works that sowed nearly every intellectual field with new and creative ideas. Diderot's writing ranges from a graceful trifle like the \"Regrets sur ma vieille robe de chambre\" (\"Regrets for my Old Dressing Gown\") up to the heady \"D'Alembert's Dream\" (\"Le Rêve de d'Alembert\") (composed 1769), a philosophical dialogue in which he plunges into the depths of the controversy as to the ultimate constitution of matter and the meaning of life. \"Jacques le fataliste\" (written in 1773, but not published until 1792 in German and 1796 in French) is similar to \"Tristram Shandy\" and \"The Sentimental Journey\" in its challenge to the conventional novel's structure and content.\n\nThe dialogue \"Rameau's Nephew\" (French: \"Le Neveu de Rameau\") is a \"farce-tragedy\" reminiscent of the \"Satires\" of Horace, a favorite classical author of Diderot's whose lines \"Vertumnis, quotquot sunt, natus iniquis\" (\"A man born when every single Vertumnus was out of sorts\") appear as epigraph. According to Nicholas Cronk, \"Rameau's Nephew\" is \"arguably the greatest work of the French Enlightenment's greatest writer.\"\n\nDiderot's intention in writing the dialogue—whether as a satire on contemporary manners, a reduction of the theory of self-interest to an absurdity, the application of irony to the ethics of ordinary convention, a mere setting for a discussion about music, or a vigorous dramatic sketch of a parasite and a human original—is disputed. In political terms it explores \"the bipolarisation of the social classes under absolute monarchy,\" and insofar as its protagonist demonstrates how the servant often manipulates the master, \"Le Neveu de Rameau\" can be seen to anticipate Hegel's master–slave dialectic.\n\nThe narrator in the book recounts a conversation with , nephew of the famous Jean-Philippe Rameau. The nephew composes and teaches music with some success but feels disadvantaged by his name and is jealous of his uncle. Eventually he sinks into an indolent and debauched state. After his wife's death, he loses all self-esteem and his brusque manners result in him being ostracized by former friends. A character profile of the nephew is now sketched by Diderot: a man who was once wealthy and comfortable with a pretty wife, who is now living in poverty and decadence, shunned by his friends. And yet this man retains enough of his past to analyze his despondency philosophically and maintains his sense of humor. Essentially he believes in nothing—not in religion, nor in morality; nor in the Roussean view about nature being better than civilization since in his opinion every species in nature consumes one another. He views the same process at work in the economic world where men consume each other through the legal system. The wise man, according to the nephew, will consequently practice hedonism: \n\nThe dialogue ends with Diderot calling the nephew a wastrel, a coward, and a glutton devoid of spiritual values to which the nephew replies: \"I believe you are right.\"\n\nThe publication history of the \"Nephew\" is circuitous. Written in 1761, Diderot never saw the work through to publication during his lifetime, and apparently did not even share it with his friends. After Diderot's death, a copy of the text reached Schiller, who gave it to Goethe, who, in 1805, translated the work into German. Goethe's translation entered France, and was retranslated into French in 1821. Another copy of the text was published in 1823, but it had been expurgated by Diderot's daughter prior to publication. The original manuscript was only found in 1891.\n\nDiderot's most intimate friend was the philologist Friedrich Melchior Grimm. They were brought together by their friend in common at that time, Jean-Jacques Rousseau. In 1753, Grimm began writing a newsletter, the \"La Correspondance littéraire, philosophique et critique\", which he would send to various high personages in Europe.\n\nIn 1759, Grimm asked Diderot to report on the biennial art exhibitions in the Louvre for the \"Correspondance\". Diderot reported on the Salons between 1759 and 1771 and again in 1775 and 1781. Diderot's reports would become \"the most celebrated contributions to La Correspondance.\"\n\nAccording to Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve, Diderot's reports initiated the French into a new way of laughing, and introduced people to the mystery and purport of colour by ideas. \"Before Diderot\", Anne Louise Germaine de Staël wrote, \"I had never seen anything in pictures except dull and lifeless colours; it was his imagination that gave them relief and life, and it is almost a new sense for which I am indebted to his genius\".\n\nDiderot had appended an \"Essai sur la peinture\" to his report on the 1765 Salon in which he expressed his views on artistic beauty. Goethe described the \"Essai sur la peinture\" as \"a magnificent work; it speaks even more usefully to the poet than to the painter, though for the painter too it is a torch of blazing illumination\".\n\nJean-Baptiste Greuze (1725–1805) was Diderot's favorite contemporary artist. Diderot appreciated Greuze's sentimentality, and more particularly Greuze's portrayals of his wife who had once been Diderot's mistress.\n\nDiderot wrote sentimental plays, \"Le Fils naturel\" (1757) and \"Le Père de famille\" (1758), accompanying them with essays on theatrical theory and practice, including \"Les Entretiens sur \"Le Fils Naturel\"\" (Conversations on \"The Natural Son\"), in which he announced the principles of a new drama: the 'serious genre', a realistic midpoint between comedy and tragedy that stood in opposition to the stilted conventions of the classical French stage. Diderot introduced the concept of the fourth wall, the imaginary \"wall\" at the front of the stage in a traditional three-walled box set in a proscenium theatre, through which the audience sees the action in the world of the play.\n\nWhen the Russian Empress Catherine the Great heard that Diderot was in need of money, she arranged to buy his library and appoint him caretaker of it until his death, at a salary of 1,000 livres per year. She even paid him 25 years salary in advance. Although Diderot hated traveling, he was obliged to visit her.\n\nOn 9 October 1773, he reached St. Petersburg, met Catherine the next day and they had several discussions on various subjects. During his five-month stay at her court, he met her almost every day. During these conversations, he would later state, they spoke 'man to man'. \n\nHe would occasionally make his point by slapping her thighs. In a letter to Madame Geoffrin, Catherine wrote:\n\nOne of the topics discussed was Diderot's ideas about how to transform Russia into a utopia. In a letter to Comte de Ségur, the Empress wrote that if she followed Diderot's advice, chaos would ensue in her kingdom.\n\nWhen returning, Diderot asked the Empress for 1,500 rubles as reimbursement for his trip. She gave him 3,000 rubles, an expensive ring, and an officer to escort him back to Paris. He would write a eulogy in her honor on reaching Paris.\n\nIn July 1784, upon hearing that Diderot was in poor health, Catherine arranged for him to move into a luxurious suite in the \"Rue de Richelieu\". Diderot died two weeks after moving there—on 31 July 1784.\n\nAmong Diderot's last works were notes \"On the Instructions of her Imperial Majesty...for the Drawing up of Laws\". This commentary on Russia included replies to some arguments Catherine had made in the Nakaz. Diderot wrote that Catherine was certainly despotic, due to circumstances and training, but was not inherently tyrannical. Thus, if she wished to destroy despotism in Russia, she should abdicate her throne and destroy anyone who tries to revive the monarchy. She should publicly declare that \"there is no true sovereign other than the nation, and there can be no true legislator other than the people.\" She should create a new Russian legal code establishing an independent legal framework and starting with the text: \"We the people, and we the sovereign of this people, swear conjointly these laws, by which we are judged equally.\" In the \"Nakaz\", Catherine had written: \"It is for legislation to follow the spirit of the nation.\" Diderot's rebuttal stated that it is for legislation to \"make\" the spirit of the nation. For instance, he argued, it is not appropriate to make public executions unnecessarily horrific.\n\nUltimately, Diderot decided not to send these notes to Catherine; however, they were delivered to her with his other papers after he died. When she read them, she was furious and commented that they were an incoherent gibberish devoid of prudence, insight, and verisimilitude.\n\nIn his youth, Diderot was originally a follower of Voltaire and his deist \"Anglomanie\", but gradually moved away from this line of thought towards materialism and atheism, a move which was finally realised in 1747 in the philosophical debate in the second part of his \"The Skeptic's Walk\" (1747). Diderot opposed mysticism and occultism, which were highly prevalent in France at the time he wrote, and believed religious truth claims must fall under the domain of reason, not mystical experience or esoteric secrets. However, Diderot showed some interest in the work of Paracelsus. He was \"a philosopher in whom all the contradictions of the time struggle with one another\" (Rosenkranz).\n\nIn his 1754 book \"On the interpretation of Nature\", Diderot expounded on his views about Nature, evolution, materialism, mathematics, and experimental science. It is speculated that Diderot may have contributed to his friend Baron d'Holbach's 1770 book \"The System of Nature\". Diderot had enthusiastically endorsed the book stating that: \n\nIn conceiving the \"Encyclopédie\", Diderot had thought of the work as a fight on behalf of posterity and had expressed confidence that posterity would be grateful for his effort. According to Diderot, \"posterity is for the philosopher what the 'other world' is for the man of religion.\"\n\nMarmontel and commented on the great pleasure of having intellectual conversations with Diderot. Morellet, a regular attendee at D'Holbach's salon, wrote: \"It is there that I heard...Diderot treat questions of philosophy, art, or literature, and by his wealth of expression, fluency, and inspired appearance, hold our attention for a long stretch of time.\" Diderot's contemporary, and rival, Jean Jacques Rousseau wrote in his \"Confessions\" that after a few centuries Diderot would be accorded as much respect by posterity as was given to Plato and Aristotle. In Germany, Goethe, Schiller, and Lessing expressed admiration for Diderot's writings, Goethe pronouncing Diderot's \"Rameau's Nephew\" to be \"the classical work of an outstanding man\" and that \"Diderot is Diderot, a unique individual; whoever carps at him and his affairs is a philistine.\"\n\nIn the next century, Diderot was admired by Balzac, Delacroix, Stendhal, Zola, and Schopenhauer. According to Comte, Diderot was the foremost intellectual in an exciting age. Historian Michelet described him as \"the true Prometheus\" and stated that Diderot's ideas would continue to remain influential long into the future. Marx chose Diderot as his \"favourite prose-writer.\"\n\nOtis Fellows and Norman Torrey have described Diderot as \"the most interesting and provocative figure of the French eighteenth century.\"\n\nIn 1993, American writer Cathleen Schine published \"Rameau's Niece\", a satire of academic life in New York that took as its premise a woman's research into an (imagined) 18th-century pornographic parody of Diderot's \"Rameau's Nephew\". The book was praised by Michiko Kakutani in the \"New York Times\" as \"a nimble philosophical satire of the academic mind\" and \"an enchanting comedy of modern manners.\"\n\nFrench author Eric-Emmanuel Schmitt wrote a play titled \"Le Libertin\" (\"The Libertine\") which imagines a day in Diderot's life including a fictional sitting for a woman painter which becomes sexually charged but is interrupted by the demands of editing the \"Encyclopédie\". It was first staged at Paris' Théâtre Montparnasse in 1997 starring Bernard Giraudeau as Diderot and Christiane Cohendy as Madame Therbouche and was well received by critics.\n\nIn 2013, the tricentennial of Diderot's birth, his hometown of Langres held a series of events in his honor and produced an audio tour of the town highlighting places that were part of Diderot's past, including the remains of the convent where his sister Angélique took her vows. On 6 October 2013, a museum of the Enlightenment focusing on Diderot's contributions to the movement, the Maison des Lumières Denis Diderot, was inaugurated in Langres.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4682359", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4682359", "title": "Directed evolution", "text": "Directed evolution\n\nDirected evolution (DE) is a method used in protein engineering that mimics the process of natural selection to steer proteins or nucleic acids toward a user-defined goal. It consists of subjecting a gene to iterative rounds of mutagenesis (creating a library of variants), selection (expressing those variants and isolating members with the desired function), and amplification (generating a template for the next round). It can be performed \"in vivo\"(in living organisms), or \"in vitro\" (in cells or free in solution). Directed evolution is used both for protein engineering as an alternative to rationally designing modified proteins, as well as studies of fundamental evolutionary principles in a controlled, laboratory environment.\n\nDirected evolution has its origins in the 1960s with the evolution of RNA molecules in the \"Spiegelman's Monster\" experiment. The concept was extended to protein evolution via evolution of bacteria under selection pressures that favoured the evolution of a single gene in its genome.\n\nEarly phage display techniques in the 1980s allowed targeting of mutations and selection to a single protein. This enabled selection of enhanced binding proteins, but was not yet compatible with selection for catalytic activity of enzymes. Methods to evolve enzymes were developed in the 1990s and brought the technique to a wider scientific audience. The field rapidly expanded with new methods for making libraries of gene variants and for screening their activity. The development of directed evolution methods was honored in 2018 with the awarding of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry to Frances Arnold for evolution of enzymes, and George Smith and Gregory Winter for phage display.\n\nDirected evolution is a mimic of the natural evolution cycle in a laboratory setting. Evolution requires three things to happen: variation between replicators, that the variation causes fitness differences upon which selection acts, and that this variation is heritable. In DE, a single gene is evolved by iterative rounds of mutagenesis, selection or screening, and amplification. Rounds of these steps are typically repeated, using the best variant from one round as the template for the next to achieve stepwise improvements.\n\nThe likelihood of success in a directed evolution experiment is directly related to the total library size, as evaluating more mutants increases the chances of finding one with the desired properties.\n\nThe first step in performing a cycle of directed evolution is the generation of a library of variant genes. The sequence space for random sequence is vast (10 possible sequences for a 100 amino acid protein) and extremely sparsely populated by functional proteins. Neither experimental, nor natural evolution can ever get close to sampling so many sequences. Of course, natural evolution samples variant sequences close to functional protein sequences and this is imitated in DE by mutagenising an already functional gene.\nSome calculations suggest it is entirely feasible that for all practical (i.e. functional and structural) purposes, protein sequence space has been fully explored during the course of evolution of life on Earth.\n\nThe starting gene can be mutagenised by random point mutations (by chemical mutagens or error prone PCR) and insertions and deletions (by transposons). Gene recombination can be mimicked by DNA shuffling of several sequences (usually of more than 70% homology) to jump into regions of sequence space between the shuffled parent genes. Finally, specific regions of a gene can be systematically randomised for a more focused approach based on structure and function knowledge. Depending on the method, the library generated will vary in the proportion of functional variants it contains. Even if an organism is used to express the gene of interest, by mutagenising only that gene, the rest of the organism’s genome remains the same and can be ignored for the evolution experiment (to the extent of providing a constant genetic environment).\n\nThe majority of mutations are deleterious and so libraries of mutants tend to mostly have variants with reduced activity. Therefore, a high-throughput assay is vital for measuring activity to find the rare variants with beneficial mutations that improve the desired properties. Two main categories of method exist for isolating functional variants. Selection systems directly couple protein function to survival of the gene, whereas screening systems individually assay each variant and allow a quantitative threshold to be set for sorting a variant or population of variants of a desired activity. Both selection and screening can be performed in living cells (\"in vivo\" evolution) or performed directly on the protein or RNA without any cells (\"in vitro\" evolution).\n\nDuring \"in vivo\" evolution, each cell (usually bacteria or yeast) is transformed with a plasmid containing a different member of the variant library. In this way, only the gene of interest differs between the cells, with all other genes being kept the same. The cells express the protein either in their cytoplasm or surface where its function can be tested. This format has the advantage of selecting for properties in a cellular environment, which is useful when the evolved protein or RNA is to be used in living organisms. When performed without cells, DE involves using \"in vitro\" transcription translation to produce proteins or RNA free in solution or compartmentalised in artificial microdroplets. This method has the benefits of being more versatile in the selection conditions (e.g. temperature, solvent), and can express proteins that would be toxic to cells. Furthermore, \"in vitro\" evolution experiments can generate far larger libraries (up to 10) because the library DNA need not be inserted into cells (often a limiting step).\n\nSelection for binding activity is conceptually simple. The target molecule is immobilised on a solid support, a library of variant proteins is flowed over it, poor binders are washed away, and the remaining bound variants recovered to isolate their genes. Binding of an enzyme to immobilised covalent inhibitor has been also used as an attempt to isolate active catalysts. This approach, however, only selects for single catalytic turnover and is not a good model of substrate binding or true substrate reactivity. If an enzyme activity can be made necessary for cell survival, either by synthesizing a vital metabolite, or destroying a toxin, then cell survival is a function of enzyme activity. Such systems are generally only limited in throughput by the transformation efficiency of cells. They are also less expensive and labour-intensive than screening, however they are typically difficult to engineer, prone to artefacts and give no information on the range of activities present in the library.\n\nAn alternative to selection is a screening system. Each variant gene is individually expressed and assayed to quantitatively measure the activity (most often by a colourgenic or fluorogenic product). The variants are then ranked and the experimenter decides which variants to use as templates for the next round of DE. Even the most high throughput assays usually have lower coverage than selection methods but give the advantage of producing detailed information on each one of the screened variants. This disaggregated data can also be used to characterise the distribution of activities in libraries which is not possible in simple selection systems. Screening systems, therefore, have advantages when it comes to experimentally characterising adaptive evolution and fitness landscapes.\n\nWhen functional proteins have been isolated, it is necessary that their genes are too, therefore a genotype-phenotype link is required. This can be covalent, such as mRNA display where the mRNA gene is linked to the protein at the end of translation by puromycin. Alternatively the protein and its gene can be co-localised by compartmentalisation in living cells or emulsion droplets. The gene sequences isolated are then amplified by PCR or by transformed host bacteria. Either the single best sequence, or a pool of sequences can be used as the template for the next round of mutagenesis. The repeated cycles of Diversification-Selection-Amplification generate protein variants adapted to the applied selection pressures.\n\nRational design of a protein relies on an in-depth knowledge of the protein structure, as well as its catalytic mechanism. Specific changes are then made by site-directed mutagenesis in an attempt to change the function of the protein. A drawback of this is that even when the structure and mechanism of action of the protein are well known, the change due to mutation is still difficult to predict. Therefore, an advantage of DE is that there is no need to understand the mechanism of the desired activity or how mutations would affect it.\n\nA restriction of directed evolution is that a high-throughput assay is required in order to measure the effects of a large number of different random mutations. This can require extensive research and development before it can be used for directed evolution. Additionally, such assays are often highly specific to monitoring a particular activity and so are not transferable to new DE experiments.\n\nAdditionally, selecting for improvement in the assayed function simply generates improvements in the assayed function. To understand how these improvements are achieved, the properties of the evolving enzyme have to be measured. Improvement of the assayed activity can be due to improvements in enzyme catalytic activity or enzyme concentration. There is also no guarantee that improvement on one substrate will improve activity on another. This is particularly important when the desired activity cannot be directly screened or selected for and so a ‘proxy’ substrate is used. DE can lead to evolutionary specialisation to the proxy without improving the desired activity. Consequently, choosing appropriate screening or selection conditions is vital for successful DE.\n\nCombined, 'semi-rational' approaches are being investigated to address the limitations of both rational design and directed evolution. Beneficial mutations are rare, so large numbers of random mutants have to be screened to find improved variants. 'Focused libraries' concentrate on randomising regions thought to be richer in beneficial mutations for the mutagenesis step of DE. A focused library contains fewer variants than a traditional random mutagenesis library and so does not require such high-throughput screening.\n\nCreating a focused library requires some knowledge of which residues in the structure to mutate. For example, knowledge of the active site of an enzyme may allow just the residues known to interact with the substrate to be randomised. Alternatively, knowledge of which protein regions are variable in nature can guide mutagenesis in just those regions.\n\nDirected evolution is frequently used for protein engineering as an alternative to rational design, but can also be used to investigate fundamental questions of enzyme evolution.\n\nAs a protein engineering tool, DE has been most successful in three areas:\n\n\nThe study of natural evolution is traditionally based on extant organisms and their genes. However, research is fundamentally limited by the lack of fossils (and particularly the lack of ancient DNA sequences) and incomplete knowledge of ancient environmental conditions. Directed evolution investigates evolution in a controlled system of genes for individual enzymes, ribozymes and replicators (similar to experimental evolution of eukaryotes, prokaryotes and viruses).\n\nDE allows control of selection pressure, mutation rate and environment (both the abiotic environment such as temperature, and the biotic environment, such as other genes in the organism).

{"id": "75340", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=75340", "title": "Dōgen", "text": "Dōgen\n\nDōgen Zenji (道元禅師; 19 January 1200 – 22 September 1253), also known as Dōgen Kigen (道元希玄), Eihei Dōgen (永平道元), Kōso Jōyō Daishi (高祖承陽大師), or Busshō Dentō Kokushi (仏性伝東国師), was a Japanese Buddhist priest, writer, poet, philosopher, and founder of the Sōtō school of Zen in Japan.\n\nOriginally ordained as a monk in the Tendai School in Kyoto, he was ultimately dissatisfied with its teaching and traveled to China to seek out what he believed to be a more authentic Buddhism. He remained there for five years, finally training under Tiantong Rujing, an eminent teacher of the Chinese Caodong lineage. Upon his return to Japan, he began promoting the practice of zazen (sitting meditation) through literary works such as \"Fukan zazengi\" and \"Bendōwa\".\n\nHe eventually broke relations completely with the powerful Tendai School, and, after several years of likely friction between himself and the establishment, left Kyoto for the mountainous countryside where he founded the monastery Eihei-ji, which remains the head temple of the Sōtō school today.\n\nDōgen is known for his extensive writing including his most famous work, the collection of 95 essays called the \"Shōbōgenzō\", but also \"Eihei Kōroku\", a collection of his talks, poetry, and commentaries, and \"Eihei Shingi\", the first Zen monastic code written in Japan, among others.\n\nDōgen was probably born into a noble family, though as an illegitimate child of Minamoto Michitomo, who served in the imperial court as a high-ranking . His mother is said to have died when Dōgen was age 7.\n\nAt some later point, Dōgen became a low-ranking monk on Mount Hiei, the headquarters of the Tendai school of Buddhism. According to the \"Kenzeiki\" (建撕記), he became possessed by a single question with regard to the Tendai doctrine:\nThis question was, in large part, prompted by the Tendai concept of original enlightenment (本覚 \"hongaku\"), which states that all human beings are enlightened by nature and that, consequently, any notion of achieving enlightenment through practice is fundamentally flawed.\n\nThe \"Kenzeiki\" further states that he found no answer to his question at Mount Hiei, and that he was disillusioned by the internal politics and need for social prominence for advancement. Therefore, Dōgen left to seek an answer from other Buddhist masters. He went to visit Kōin, the Tendai abbot of Onjō-ji Temple (園城寺), asking him this same question. Kōin said that, in order to find an answer, he might want to consider studying Chán in China. In 1217, two years after the death of contemporary Zen Buddhist Myōan Eisai, Dōgen went to study at Kennin-ji Temple (建仁寺), under Eisai's successor, Myōzen (明全).\n\nIn 1223, Dōgen and Myōzen undertook the dangerous passage across the East China Sea to China to study in Jing-de-si (Ching-te-ssu, 景德寺) monastery as Eisai had once done.\n\nIn China, Dōgen first went to the leading Chan monasteries in Zhèjiāng province. At the time, most Chan teachers based their training around the use of \"gōng-àn\"s (Japanese: \"kōan\"). Though Dōgen assiduously studied the kōans, he became disenchanted with the heavy emphasis laid upon them, and wondered why the sutras were not studied more. At one point, owing to this disenchantment, Dōgen even refused Dharma transmission from a teacher. Then, in 1225, he decided to visit a master named Rújìng (如淨; J. Nyōjo), the thirteenth patriarch of the Cáodòng (J. Sōtō) lineage of Zen Buddhism, at Mount Tiāntóng (天童山 \"Tiāntóngshān\"; J. Tendōzan) in Níngbō. Rujing was reputed to have a style of Chan that was different from the other masters whom Dōgen had thus far encountered. In later writings, Dōgen referred to Rujing as \"the Old Buddha\". Additionally he affectionately described both Rujing and Myōzen as .\n\nUnder Rujing, Dōgen realized liberation of body and mind upon hearing the master say, \"Cast off body and mind\" (身心脱落 \"shēn xīn tuō luò\"). This phrase would continue to have great importance to Dōgen throughout his life, and can be found scattered throughout his writings, as—for example—in a famous section of his \"Genjōkōan\" (現成公案):\nMyōzen died shortly after Dōgen arrived at Mount Tiantong. In 1227, Dōgen received Dharma transmission and \"inka\" from Rujing, and remarked on how he had finally settled his \"life's quest of the great matter\".\n\nDōgen returned to Japan in 1227 or 1228, going back to stay at Kennin-ji, where he had trained previously. Among his first actions upon returning was to write down the \"Fukan Zazengi\" (普観坐禅儀; \"Universally Recommended Instructions for Zazen\"), a short text emphasizing the importance of and giving instructions for \"zazen,\" or sitting meditation.\n\nHowever, tension soon arose as the Tendai community began taking steps to suppress both Zen and Jōdo Shinshū, the new forms of Buddhism in Japan. In the face of this tension, Dōgen left the Tendai dominion of Kyōto in 1230, settling instead in an abandoned temple in what is today the city of Uji, south of Kyōto. In 1233, Dōgen founded the Kannon-dōri-in in Fukakusa as a small center of practice. He later expanded this temple into Kōshōhōrin-ji (興聖法林寺).\n\nIn 1243, Hatano Yoshishige (波多野義重) offered to relocate Dōgen's community to Echizen province, far to the north of Kyōto. Dōgen accepted because of the ongoing tension with the Tendai community, and the growing competition of the Rinzai-school.\n\nHis followers built a comprehensive center of practice there, calling it Daibutsu Temple (Daibutsu-ji, 大仏寺). While the construction work was going on, Dōgen would live and teach at Yoshimine-dera Temple (Kippō-ji, 吉峯寺), which is located close to Daibutsu-ji. During his stay at Kippō-ji, Dōgen \"fell into a depression\". It marked a turning point in his life, giving way to \"rigorous critique of Rinzai Zen\". He criticized Dahui Zonggao, the most influential figure of Song Dynasty Chán.\n\nIn 1246, Dōgen renamed Daibutsu-ji, calling it Eihei-ji. This temple remains one of the two head temples of Sōtō Zen in Japan today, the other being Sōji-ji.\n\nDōgen spent the remainder of his life teaching and writing at Eihei-ji. In 1247, the newly installed shōgun's regent, Hōjō Tokiyori, invited Dōgen to come to Kamakura to teach him. Dōgen made the rather long journey east to provide the shōgun with lay ordination, and then returned to Eihei-ji in 1248. In the autumn of 1252, Dōgen fell ill, and soon showed no signs of recovering. He presented his robes to his main apprentice, Koun Ejō (孤雲懐弉), making him the abbot of Eihei-ji.\n\nAt Hatano Yoshishige's invitation, Dōgen left for Kyōto in search of a remedy for his illness. In 1253, soon after arriving in Kyōto, Dōgen died. Shortly before his death, he had written a death poem:\n\nDōgen often stressed the critical importance of zazen, or sitting meditation as the central practice of Buddhism. He considered zazen to be identical to studying Zen. This is pointed out clearly in the first sentence of the 1243 instruction manual \"Zazen-gi\" (坐禪儀; \"Principles of Zazen\"): \"Studying Zen ... is zazen\". Dōgen taught zazen to everyone, even for the laity, male or female and including all social classes. In referring to zazen, Dōgen is most often referring specifically to \"shikantaza\", roughly translatable as \"nothing but precisely sitting\", or \"just sitting,\" which is a kind of sitting meditation in which the meditator sits \"in a state of brightly alert attention that is free of thoughts, directed to no object, and attached to no particular content\". In his \"Fukan Zazengi\", Dōgen wrote:\n\nDōgen called this zazen practice \"without thinking\" (\"hi-shiryo\") in which one is simply aware of things as they are, beyond thinking and not-thinking - the active effort not to think.\n\nThe correct mental attitude for zazen according to Dōgen is one of effortless non-striving, this is because for Dōgen, enlightenment is already always present.\n\nFurther, Dōgen frequently distanced himself from more syncretic Buddhist practices at the time, including those of his contemporary Eisai. In the Bendowa, Dōgen writes:\n\nThe primary concept underlying Dōgen's Zen practice is \"oneness of practice-enlightenment\" (修證一如 \"shushō-ittō\" / \"shushō-ichinyo\").\n\nFor Dōgen, the practice of zazen and the experience of enlightenment were one and the same. This point was succinctly stressed by Dōgen in the \"Fukan Zazengi\", the first text that he composed upon his return to Japan from China: \nEarlier in the same text, the basis of this identity is explained in more detail:\nThe \"oneness of practice-enlightenment\" was also a point stressed in the \"Bendōwa\" (弁道話 \"A Talk on the Endeavor of the Path\") of 1231:\nFor Dōgen, Buddha-nature or \"Busshō\" (佛性) is the nature of reality and all Being. In the \"Shōbōgenzō\", Dōgen writes that \"whole-being is the Buddha-nature\" and that even inanimate things (grass, trees, etc.) are an expression of Buddha-nature. He rejected any view that saw Buddha-nature as a permanent, substantial inner self or ground. Dōgen held that Buddha-nature was \"vast emptiness\", \"the world of becoming\" and that \"impermanence is in itself Buddha-nature\". According to Dōgen:\n\nTherefore, the very impermanency of grass and tree, thicket and forest is the Buddha nature. The very impermanency of men and things, body and mind, is the Buddha nature. Nature and lands, mountains and rivers, are impermanent because they are the Buddha nature. Supreme and complete enlightenment, because it is impermanent, is the Buddha nature.\n\nDōgen's conception of Time-Being (\"Uji\", 有時) is an essential element of his metaphysics in the \"Shōbōgenzō\". According to the traditional interpretation, \"Uji\" here means time itself is being, and all being is time.\" \"Uji\" is all the changing and dynamic activities that exist as the flow of becoming, all beings in the entire world are time. The two terms are thus spoken of concurrently to emphasize that the things are not to be viewed as separate concepts. Moreover, the aim is to not abstract time and being as rational concepts. This view has been developed by scholars such as Steven Heine, Joan Stambaugh and others and has served as a motivation to compare Dōgen's work to that of Martin Heidegger's \"Dasein\". Recently, however, Rein Raud has argued that this view is not correct and that Dōgen asserts that all existence is momentary, showing that such a reading would make quite a few of the rather cryptic passages in the \"Shōbōgenzō\" quite lucid.\n\nAnother essential element of Dōgen's 'performative' metaphysics is his conception of Perfect expression (\"Dōtoku\", 道得). \"While a radically critical view on language as soteriologically inefficient, if not positively harmful, is what Zen Buddhism is famous for,\" it can be argued \"'within the framework of a rational theory of language, against an obscurantist interpretation of Zen that time and again invokes experience.'\" Dōgen distinguishes two types of language: monji 文字, the first, – after Ernst Cassirer – \"discursive type that constantly structures our experiences and—more fundamentally—in fact produces the world we experience in the first place\"; and dōtoku 道得, the second, \"presentative type, which takes a holistic stance and establishes the totality of significations through a texture of relations.\". As Döll points out, \"It is this second type, as Müller holds, that allows for a positive view of language even from the radically skeptical perspective of Dōgen’s brand of Zen Buddhism.\"\n\nDōgen was sometimes critical of the Rinzai school for their formulaic and intellectual koan practice (such as the practice of the \"Shiryoken\" or \"Four Discernments\") as well as for their disregard for the sutras:\n\nRecently in the great Sung dynasty of China there are many who call themselves \"Zen masters\". They do not know the length and breadth of the Buddha-Dharma. They have heard and seen but little. They memorize two or three sayings of Lin Chi and Yun Men and think this is the whole way of the Buddha-Dharma. If the Dharma of the Buddha could be condensed in two or three sayings of Lin Chi and Yun Men, it would not have been transmitted to the present day. One can hardly say that Lin Chi and Yun Men are the Venerable ones of the Buddha-Dharma.\n\nDōgen was also very critical of the Japanese Daruma school of Dainichi Nōnin.\n\nDogen's perspective of virtue is discussed in the \"Shōbōgenzō\" text as something to be practiced inwardly so that it will manifest itself on the outside. In other words, virtue is something that is both internal and external in the sense that one can practice internal good dispositions and also the expression of these good dispositions.\n\nWhile it was customary for Buddhist works to be written in Chinese, Dōgen often wrote in Japanese, conveying the essence of his thought in a style that was at once concise, compelling, and inspiring. A master stylist, Dōgen is noted not only for his prose, but also for his poetry (in Japanese \"waka\" style and various Chinese styles). Dōgen's use of language is unconventional by any measure. According to Dōgen scholar Steven Heine: \"Dogen's poetic and philosophical works are characterized by a continual effort to express the inexpressible by perfecting imperfectable speech through the creative use of wordplay, neologism, and lyricism, as well as the recasting of traditional expressions\".\n\nDōgen's masterpiece is the \"Shōbōgenzō\", talks and writings collected together in ninety-five fascicles. The topics range from monastic practice, to the equality of women and men, to the philosophy of language, being, and time. In the work, as in his own life, Dōgen emphasized the absolute primacy of \"shikantaza\" and the inseparability of practice and enlightenment.\n\nDōgen also compiled a collection of 301 koans in Chinese without commentaries added. Often called the \"Shinji Shōbōgenzō\" (\"shinji\": \"original or true characters\" and \"shōbōgenzō\", variously translated as \"the right-dharma-eye treasury\" or \"Treasury of the Eye of the True Dharma\"). The collection is also known as the \"Shōbōgenzō Sanbyakusoku\" (The Three Hundred Verse Shōbōgenzō\") and the \"Mana Shōbōgenzō\", where \"mana\" is an alternative reading of \"shinji\". The exact date the book was written is in dispute but Nishijima believes that Dogen may well have begun compiling the koan collection before his trip to China. Although these stories are commonly referred to as \"kōans\", Dōgen referred to them as \"kosoku\" (ancestral criteria) or \"innen\" (circumstances and causes or results, of a story). The word \"kōan\" for Dogen meant \"absolute reality\" or the \"universal Dharma\".\n\nLectures that Dōgen gave to his monks at his monastery, Eihei-ji, were compiled under the title \"Eihei Kōroku\", also known as \"Dōgen Oshō Kōroku\" (The Extensive Record of Teacher Dōgen’s Sayings) in ten volumes. The sermons, lectures, sayings and poetry were compiled shortly after Dōgen’s death by his main disciples, Koun Ejō (孤雲懐奘, 1198–1280), Senne, and Gien. There are three different editions of this text: the Rinnō-ji text from 1598, a popular version printed in 1672, and a version discovered at Eihei-ji in 1937, which, although undated, is believed to be the oldest extant version. Another collection of his talks is the \"Shōbōgenzō Zuimonki\" (Gleanings from Master Dōgen’s Sayings) in six volumes. These are talks that Dōgen gave to his leading disciple, Ejō, who became Dōgen’s disciple in 1234. The talks were recorded and edited by Ejō.\n\nThe earliest work by Dōgen is the \"Hōkojōki\" (Memoirs of the Hōkyō Period). This one volume work is a collection of questions and answers between Dōgen and his Chinese teacher, Tiāntóng Rújìng (天童如淨; Japanese: Tendō Nyojō, 1162–1228). The work was discovered among Dōgen’s papers by Ejō in 1253, just three months after Dōgen’s death.\n\nOther notable writings of Dōgen are:\n\nThe concept of oneness of practice-enlightenment is considered so fundamental to Dōgen's variety of Zen — and, consequently, to the Sōtō school as a whole — that it formed the basis for the work \"Shushō-gi\" (修證儀), which was compiled in 1890 by Takiya Takushū (滝谷卓洲) of Eihei-ji and Azegami Baisen (畔上楳仙) of Sōji-ji as an introductory and prescriptive abstract of Dōgen's massive work, the \"Shōbōgenzō\" (\"Treasury of the Eye of the True Dharma\").\n\nThough Dogen emphasised the importance of the correct transmission of the Buddha dharma, as guaranteed by the line of transmission from Shakyamuni, his own transmission became problematic in the third generation. In 1267 Ejō retired as Abbot of Eihei-ji, giving way to Gikai, who was already favored by Dōgen. Gikai introduced esoteric elements into the practice. Opposition arose, and in 1272 Ejō resumed the position of abbot. Following Ejō's death in 1280, Gikai became abbot again, strengthened by the support of the military for magical practices. Opposition arose again, and Gikai was forced to leave Eihei-ji. He was succeeded by Gien, who was first trained in the Daruma-school of Nōnin. His supporters designated him as the third abbot, rejecting the legitimacy of Gien.\n\n\nJakuen, a student of Rujing, who traced his lineage \"directly back the Zen of the Song period\", established Hōkyō-ji, where a strict style of Zen was practised. Students of his played a role in the conflict between Giin and Gikai.\n\nA notable successor of Dogen was Keizan (瑩山; 1268–1325), founder of Sōji-ji Temple and author of the \"Record of the Transmission of Light\" (傳光錄 \"Denkōroku\"), which traces the succession of Zen masters from Siddhārtha Gautama up to Keizan's own day. Together, Dōgen and Keizan are regarded as the founders of the Sōtō school in Japan.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2998760", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2998760", "title": "Facilitated variation", "text": "Facilitated variation\n\nThe theory of facilitated variation demonstrates how seemingly complex biological systems can arise through a limited number of regulatory genetic changes, through the differential re-use of pre-existing developmental components. The theory was presented in 2005 by Marc W. Kirschner (a professor and chair at the Department of Systems Biology, Harvard Medical School) and John C. Gerhart (a professor at the Graduate School, University of California, Berkeley).\n\nThe theory of facilitated variation addresses the nature and function of phenotypic variation in evolution. Recent advances in cellular and evolutionary developmental biology shed light on a number of mechanisms for generating novelty. Most anatomical and physiological traits that have evolved since the Cambrian are, according to Kirschner and Gerhart, the result of regulatory changes in the usage of various conserved core components that function in development and physiology. Novel traits arise as novel packages of modular core components, which requires modest genetic change in regulatory elements. The modularity and adaptability of developmental systems reduces the number of regulatory changes needed to generate adaptive phenotypic variation, increases the probability that genetic mutation will be viable, and allows organisms to respond flexibly to novel environments. In this manner, the conserved core processes facilitate the generation of adaptive phenotypic variation, which natural selection subsequently propagates.\n\nThe theory of facilitated variation consists of several elements. Organisms are built from a set of highly conserved modules called \"core processes\" that function in development and physiology, and have remained largely unchanged for millions (in some instances billions) of years. Genetic mutation leads to regulatory changes in the package of core components (i.e. new combinations, amounts, and functional states of those components) exhibited by an organism. Finally, the altered combinations, amounts, and states of the conserved components function to develop and operate a new trait on which natural selection acts. Because of their modular organization, adaptability (e.g. arising through exploratory processes) and compartmentation, developmental systems tend to produce facilitated (i.e. functional and adaptive) phenotypic variation when challenged by genetic mutation or novel environmental conditions.\n\nAnimals are built from a tool kit of components (e.g. like lego bricks). Most of the core components are conserved across diverse phyla of the animal kingdom. Examples of core components are:\n\nAdditional core processes, such as appendage and limb formation in arthropods and tetrapods, respectively, are combinations of different conserved core processes linked in new regulatory configurations, and conserved in their entirety. \n\nDifferent core processes become linked, through differential regulation, in different combinations, and operate in different amounts, states, times, and places, to generate new anatomical and physiological traits. These regulatory linkages can be made and changed easily, a phenomenon that Kirschner and Gerhart call “weak regulatory linkage”. Regulatory signals can switch on and off the core components to elicit complex responses. Although the signal seems to control the response, typically the responding core process can produce the output by itself but inhibits itself from doing so. All the signal does is interferes with this self-inhibition. Regulatory change is easily effected because conserved core processes have switch-like behavior and alternative outputs already built into them, which means that regulation does not need to coevolve with the functional output. \n\nSome conserved core processes, called \"exploratory processes\", have the ability to generate many different phenotypical outcomes or states. Examples include:\n\nExploratory processes first generate a very large amount of physiological variation, often at random, and then select or stabilize the most useful ones, with the rest disappearing or dying back. Hence, exploratory processes resemble a Darwinian process operating during development. \n\nFor example, as the vascular system develops, blood vessels expand to regions with insufficient oxygen supply. There is no predetermined genetically specified map for the distribution of blood vessels in the body, but the vascular system responds to signals from hypoxic tissues, whilst unrequired vessels in well-oxygenated tissues die back. Exploratory processes are powerful because they provide organisms with a tremendous scope for adaptation.\n\nAncient regulatory processes (evolved in pre-Cambrian animals) allow the re-use of core processes in different combinations, amounts, and states in some regions of the body, or certain times in development, while decreasing their chances of generating disruptive or maladaptive pleiotropic effects elsewhere in the organism. Spatial compartmentation of transcriptional regulation and cell–cell signaling are examples. The vertebrate embryo is organized spatially into perhaps 200 compartments, each uniquely defined by its expression of one or a few key genes encoding transcription factors or signaling molecules. An example of compartmentation is found in the developing spine: all vertebrae contain bone-forming cells, but those in the chest form ribs, whereas those in the neck do not, because they arose in different compartments (expressing different Hox genes). Other forms of regulatory compartmentation include different cell types, developmental stages, and sexes.\n\nGerhart and Kirschner give the example of the evolution of a bird or bat wing from a tetrapod forelimb. They explain how, if bones undergo regulatory change in length and thickness as a result of genetic mutation, the muscles, nerves and vasculature will accommodate to those changes without themselves requiring independent regulatory change. Studies of limb development show that muscle, nerve, and vascular founder cells originate in the embryonic trunk and migrate into the developing limb bud, which initially contains only bone and dermis precursors. Muscle precursors are adaptable; they receive signals from developing dermis and bone and take positions relative to them, wherever they are. Then, as noted previously, axons in large numbers extend into the bud from the nerve cord; some fortuitously contact muscle targets and are stabilized, and the rest shrink back. Finally, vascular progenitors enter. Wherever limb cells are hypoxic, they secrete signals that trigger nearby blood vessels to grow into their vicinity. Because of the adaptability conferred by exploratory processes, the co-evolution of bones, muscles, nerves and blood vessels is not required. Selection does not have to coordinate multiple independently varying parts. This not only means that viable phenotypes can easily be generated with little genetic change, but also that genetic mutations are less likely to be lethal, that large phenotypic changes can be favored by selection, and that phenotypic variation is functional and adaptive (i.e. ‘facilitated’). \n\nThe theory of facilitated variation is supported by computational analyses of the evolution of regulatory networks. These studies confirm that phenotypic variability can be directed towards phenotypes with high fitness even when mutations are randomly distributed, and even when challenged with novel environmental conditions. Parter et al. demonstrate how key elements of facilitated variation theory, such as weak regulatory linkage, modularity, and reduced pleiotropy of mutations, evolve spontaneously under realistic conditions. \n\nIn the classical Darwinian view, a large number of successive mutations, each selected for its usefulness to the survival of the organism, is required to produce novel structures such as wings, limbs, or the brain. Alternatively, facilitated variation asserts that the physiological adaptability of core processes and properties such as weak linkage and exploratory processes enable proteins, cells, and body structures to interact in numerous ways that can lead to the creation of novelty with a limited number of genes, and a limited number of mutations.\n\nTherefore, the role of mutations is often to change how, where, and when the genes are expressed during the development of the embryo and adult. The burden of creativity in evolution does not rest on selection alone. Through its ancient repertoire of core processes, the current phenotype of the animal determines the kind, amount, and viability of phenotypic variation the animal can produce in response to regulatory change. In emphasizing the adaptability of organisms, and their ability to produce functional phenotypes even in the face of mutation or environmental change, Kirschner and Gerhart’s theory builds upon earlier ideas by James Baldwin (the Baldwin effect), Ivan Schmalhausen, Conrad Waddington (genetic assimilation and accommodation), and Mary Jane West-Eberhard (‘genes are followers not leaders’). More recently, the theory of facilitated variation has been embraced by advocates of an extended evolutionary synthesis, and emphasized for its role in generating non-random phenotypic variation (‘developmental bias’). However, some evolutionary biologists remain skeptical as to whether facilitated variation adds a great deal to evolutionary theory.\n\nCreationists and advocates of Intelligent Design have argued that complex traits cannot evolve through successive small modifications to pre-existing functional systems. The theory of facilitated variation challenges this idea of irreducible complexity by explaining how random mutation can cause substantial and adaptive changes within a species. It explains how the individual organism can change from a passive target of natural selection, to an active player in the 3-billion-year history of evolution. Kirschner and Gerhart's theory thereby provides a scientific rebuttal to modern critics of evolution who champion Intelligent Design.\n\n"}

Frugality may contribute to health by leading people to avoid products that are both expensive and unhealthy when used to excess. Frugal living is mainly practiced by those who aim to cut expenses, have more money, and get the most they possibly can from their money.\n\nIn the context of some belief systems, frugality is a \"philosophy\" in which one does not trust (or is deeply wary of) \"expert\" knowledge from commercial markets or corporate cultures, claiming to know what is in the best economic, material, or spiritual interests of the individual.\n\nDifferent spiritual communities consider frugality to be a virtue or a spiritual discipline. The Religious Society of Friends and the Puritans are examples of such groups. The basic philosophy behind this is the idea that people ought to save money in order to allocate it to more charitable purposes, such as helping others in need.\n\nThere are also environmentalists who consider frugality to be a virtue through which humans can make use of their ancestral skills as hunter-gatherers, carrying little and needing little, and finding meaning in nature instead of man-made conventions or religion. Henry David Thoreau expressed a similar philosophy in \"Walden\", with his zest for self-reliance and minimal possessions while living simply in the woods.\n\nFrugality has been adopted as a strategic imperative by large enterprises as a means of cost reduction through engenderment of a philosophy of careful spending amongst the workforce. Cost reduction is often perceived negatively, be it within a corporate organisation or in society, so inviting each employee to embrace frugality transfers the burden of cost reduction from management to the employee. In doing so, corporations introduce a moral obligation to cost cutting, proposing the notion that careful management of costs is in the company, shareholder and employee's best interests.\n"}

Mosca held several other academic positions throughout his life.\n\nIn 1909 Mosca was elected to the Chamber of Deputies of Italy, in which he served until 1919. During this time, he served as Under-secretary for the Colonies from 1914 until 1916. In 1919, Mosca was nominated life senator of the Kingdom of Italy. He served actively in this capacity until 1926. During the Fascist dictatorship, Mosca retired to teach and research. In 1925 he signed the Manifesto of the Anti-Fascist Intellectuals.\n\nDuring this time, Mosca also worked as a political journalist for the \"Corriere della Sera\" of Milan (after 1901) and the \"Tribuna\" of Rome (from 1911 to 1921).\n\nMosca is most famous, however, for his works of political theory. These were ' (Theory of Governments and Parliamentary Government), published in 1884; ' (The Ruling Class), published in 1896; and \"\" (History of Political Doctrines), published in 1936.\n\nMosca's enduring contribution to political science is the observation that all but the most primitive societies are ruled in fact, if not in theory, by a numerical minority. He named this minority the political class. That means that every society could be split between two social classes: the one who rules and the one which is ruled. This is always true, for Mosca, because without a political class there is no rule.\n\nAlthough his theory is correctly characterized as \"elitist\", it should be observed that its basis is far different from \"The Power Elite\" described by, for example, C. Wright Mills. Unlike Mills and later sociologists, Mosca aimed to develop a universal theory of political society and his more general theory of the \"Political Class\" reflects this aim.\nMosca defined modern elites in term of their superior organizational skills. These organizational skills were especially useful in gaining political power in modern bureaucratic society. Nevertheless, Mosca's theory was more liberal than the elitist theory of, for example, Pareto, since in Mosca's conception, elites are not hereditary in nature and peoples from all classes of society can theoretically become elite: when this happens, the reproduction of power is defined as democratic; whereas, when the member's recycle remains inside the elite, the reproduction of power is defined as aristocratic. He also adhered to the concept of the circulation of elites, which is a dialectical theory of constant competition between elites, with one elite group replacing another repeatedly over time. That concept came from his materialist idea of history as a conflict between classes (Marx), from the conflicted nature of politic considered as a fight for acquisition and department of power (Machiavelli) and finally from the non-egalitarian and hierarchical structure of society. Unlike Marx, Mosca has not a linear concept of time, but a circular one, as in classical political theory, which consists in a perpetual condition of conflict and recycle of the elite. For Mosca, the dichotomous structure of society wouldn't be solved by the revolution.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "35542081", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35542081", "title": "Greenhouse effect (United States Supreme Court)", "text": "Greenhouse effect (United States Supreme Court)\n\nThe Greenhouse Effect is a theory of Supreme Court justices' behavior, first proposed by Hoover Institution economist Thomas Sowell and popularized by D.C. Court of Appeals Senior Judge Laurence Silberman in a speech to The Federalist Society in 1992. Here, the word \"Greenhouse\" refers to Linda Greenhouse, a Pulitzer Prize winning reporter who covered the Supreme Court for the \"New York Times\" for 40 years. Silberman used the term to postulate a tendency of conservative Supreme Court Justices to vote with the liberals more often as their careers progress due to a desire for favorable press coverage. He said \"It seems that the primary objective of The Times's legal reporters is to put activist heat on recently appointed Supreme Court justices.\"\n\nThe existence of the Greenhouse Effect has been challenged by some commentators, who note it presumes a \"vast, hegemonic liberal control over the media and academia\" and question whether professional decision makers who have \"come to their views despite years of elite education and exposure to elite opinion\" are really so malleable. However, the evidence below suggests that conservative justices become liberal more often than liberals become conservative. Further, the existence of a more general version of the Greenhouse Effect, one not restricted to the media but rather \"elites\" in general or legal elites, is less controversial. Though this does not show causation, 75% of law professors who began their careers after 1986 identify as liberal, while only 10% identify as conservative. Evidence suggests more \"elite\" journalists identify as liberal than conservative.\n\nThe Greenhouse Effect refers to Linda Greenhouse, a Pulitzer Prize winning \"New York Times\" Supreme Court reporter for over three decades, currently a Senior Fellow at Yale Law School. Greenhouse came under fire from conservatives for publicly espousing liberal viewpoints by participating in a 1989 pro-choice march and in remarks at the Radcliffe Institute in 2006.\n\nGreenhouse herself commented on the origins of the theory in an interview with NPR:\n\nIt is unclear whether Ms. Greenhouse meant to refer to Mr. Bethell or Mr. Sowell. Mr. Bethell, an editor at the \"American Spectator\" and another Hoover Institution fellow, started the \"Strange New Respect Awards\", which are given to conservatives who have become more liberal. Ms. Greenhouse is said by some to have inspired the award. Mr. Sowell is more often cited as the origin of the name of the theory.\n\nPat Buchanan, a conservative political commentator, wrote the passage below, after quoting Linda Greenhouse in reference to Justice John Paul Stevens' advocating for a reconsideration of the death penalty in \"Kennedy v. Louisiana\":\n\nSupreme Court author, Larry Berkson, holds that the Supreme Court has two audiences: the highly attentive legal profession and the less engaged general public. If the Supreme Court is without the general public's backing, its authority may be eroded. However, the Court must remain independent of the ongoing political process. Richard Davis discusses this relationship with the Court and the public as, \"the paradox of imagemaking – to engage in imagemaking while denying its existence to maintain the image.\"\n\nSince the majority of the general public does not have the time, interest or expertise to read the opinions for themselves, they must depend on newspapers, periodicals, radio and TV for its information. Justices have also been known to survey reporters to determine if they were interpreting their opinions as intended. In these ways and more the Court also tried to shape the way the media covers the justices and their decisions. The Supreme Court also receives news of the public's reactions to its decisions through the press. Some scholars have postulated that swing justices, who have disproportionate influence over the court, may be more attuned to public opinion since their own policy preferences are weaker than their colleagues.\n\nThe demographics of the Supreme Court reveal that Justices tend to be more highly educated and wealthy relative to the rest of the nation. In 2007, 7 of the 9 justices had a net worth of over a million dollars and all of the justices attended an Ivy League law school. Social psychological theory holds that we seek approval from those similar to us, and those we interact with more often. In the court's case, this means Justices may be more influenced by elites than by the public.\n\nRegardless of the cause, it is well established that many Supreme Court Justices exhibit sizable shifts in voting patterns over their careers, much more so than would be expected for experienced jurists who are chosen for life service on the nation's highest court.\n\nLawrence Baum found some evidence that supports the effect's existence. However, the research is not definitive at this point in time, as it is hampered by the small sample size of Supreme Court justices in the modern era. Furthermore, it is important to note that much of Baum's research focuses on the influence of \"elite\" opinion, not just the media. However, the evidence for the influence of \"elite\" opinion is more robust than the evidence for media specifically.\n\n\"Amicus curiae\" briefs and law review articles can influence the court by providing precedents or reasoning to support a position. In \"West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette\" the court overturned the precedent relating to school prayer that it had established in \"Minersville School District v. Gobitis\" just three years earlier, ruling that students did not have to salute the flag, which was applauded by liberals. Notably, 31 out of the 39 law review articles commenting on Gobitis condemned the decision. Justice Hugo Black was said by Justice William O. Douglas to have changed his mind because \"he had been reading the papers\". In \"Grutter v. Bollinger\", an affirmative action case, 83 out of the 102 \"amicus\" briefs supported affirmative action, and briefs filed by \"elites\" such as Fortune 500 companies, colleges, and states displayed even higher levels for support for affirmative action. In \"Gannett Co. v. Depasquale\" the court held that the 6th Amendment didn't guarantee public access to trials. The media erupted in a firestorm of criticism, prompting four Justices to make public statements about the meaning of the case. However, one year later, the court reversed itself in \"Richmond Newspapers v. Virginia\".\n\nThroughout the modern era and in a variety of cases, Supreme Court decisions better reflect the opinions of the highly educated than general public opinion. For example, in 1964, 41.4% of those with post-graduate degrees agreed with the court's position on school prayer compared to only 14.9% of those with lower levels of education. There was an equivalent gulf for \"Texas v. Johnson\", the 1990 decision concerning flag burning. In 2003, in \"Lawrence v. Texas\", which legalized homosexual intercourse in states that had anti-sodomy laws, 75% of people with post-graduate degrees agreed with the court, whereas 51% of those with lower levels of education agreed.\n\nSome of the strongest empirical evidence concerns the difference between conservative Justices who lived in Washington, D.C. before they were nominated and those who did not. The evidence from the modern era is summarized in the table below. The table displays the change in pro-civil liberties votes from Justice's early terms and later terms. A higher percentage of pro-civil liberties votes is generally regarded as more liberal.\n\n\nOnly four of the twenty-six Justices serving since 1937 remained relatively stable. Justice Harry Blackmun was famously said to have \"evolved\" over his career, becoming much more liberal in later decades; Linda Greenhouse herself wrote an article about Blackmun called \"The Evolution of A Justice.\" Notably, he wrote the opinion in favor of legalizing abortion in \"Roe v. Wade\". This is despite the fact that President Richard Nixon asked Justice Harry Blackmun if \"he could resist the Washington cocktail party circuit\" before his nomination. Several other Republican presidents' nominees shifted to the left, such as Brennan, O'Connor, Souter and Stevens. Some justices have shifted to the right, such as Felix Frankfurter and Byron White, but on the whole in the modern era there have been more shifts to the left than the right. Frankfurter began his career in the 1938 term as a slightly left-of-center Justice, closer to the term's likely median. Virtually from the start of his second term, however, Frankfurter appears to have drifted right. By the conclusion of his tenure, Frankfurter was second only to John M. Harlan II as the Court's most extreme conservative voter; he actually ended his service more firmly planted on the right than Chief Justice Rehnquist. Justice Black's movement to the right was not missed by some commentators. As James F. Simon once wrote, Black's \"increasingly brittle, unmistakably conservative tilt\" actually proved embarrassing to many of his admirers.\n\nOf sitting justices as of 2012, Justice Anthony Kennedy is noted for having become much more liberal. Kennedy had been expected to be the swing vote overturning \"Roe v. Wade\" in \"Planned Parenthood v. Casey\", but instead voted to uphold it, with the evidence suggesting he changed his mind between conference and the final vote. Kennedy had previously changed his mind in \"Lee v. Weisman\", concerning school prayer. Kennedy has been observed to be concerned with how he will go down in history. In an interview given just minutes before Casey was handed down, he said \"Sometimes you don't know if you're Caesar about to cross the Rubicon or Captain Queeg cutting your own tow line.\" Kennedy displays the concern with his historical image that would lend credence to the Greenhouse Effect, for example by having his clerks clip all news stories about him.\n"}

{"id": "47458946", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47458946", "title": "Holy Confucian Church", "text": "Holy Confucian Church\n\nThe Holy Confucian Church or Holy Church of Confucius (孔圣会 \"Kǒngshènghuì\") or Holy Confucian Church of China (中华孔圣会 \"Zhōnghuá Kǒngshènghuì\") is a body formed of many local Confucian churches or halls (孔圣堂 \"Kǒngshèngtáng\") in China. The grassroots movement was initiated by Zhou Beichen, a disciple of the Confucian philosopher Jiang Qing, who founded the first holy church in Shenzhen in 2009. The aim of the movement was to develop a network of local Confucian churches throughout the country, eventually unifying into a national body and becoming the state religion of China. The Holy Confucian Church has received support from the Confucian Academy of Hong Kong, although it has developed independently from the latter.\n\nIn 2010 the first holy church in Shenzhen was officially registered as a non-governmental non-profit (\"fēi qǐyè\" 非企业) organisation of public interest (\"gōngyì\" 公益) affiliated with the Federation of Confucian Culture of Qufu City. The Holy Church maintains close relations with local government officials and high-ranking dignitaries of the State Administration for Religious Affairs attend its ceremonies. The national and international body, the Holy Confucian Church of China, was finally established in late 2015.\n\nZhou Beichen was born in the province of Guizhou in 1965. He studies at the Guizhou University and experienced with work in journalism, publishing and teaching. In the 1980s he was interested in Western philosophy, while in the 1990s he studied the works of many contemporary Neo-Confucian circles.\n\nLater, Zhou Beichen approached to Jiang Qing's work on the Gongyang (公羊) school of New Text Confucianism, especially the idea of political Confucianism or the \"outside kingship\" (外王). In 1996 he met Jiang Qing in person and they founded together the Yangming Academy in Guizhou. Between that year and 2003 he settled down in Shenzhen, living with business activity and projecting the Confucian holy halls (\"Kongshengtang\") movement which officially started in 2009.\n\nThe Confucian holy halls multiplied over the following years and on 1 November 2015 many Confucian scholars including Jiang Qing, Kang Xiaoguang, Zhang Xianglong and Sheng Hong gathered in Shenzhen for the formal establishment of a national and international Holy Confucian Church which would encompass all local Confucian congregations and civil organisations. Jiang Qing was appointed as the spiritual leader of the church.\n\nSome see the Holy Confucian Church as a continuation of the Confucian Church that was founded in 1912 by Kang Youwei, a Confucian reformer, but which was later disbanded because of hostile political climate. The contemporary Holy Confucian Church aims to foster folk Confucian and traditional religion in a period of deep crisis of the Chinese civilisation, and represent a \"body\" for the \"soul\" of the Chinese, or a new embodiment of the \"wandering soul\" of Confucianism deprived of its social structure after the empire fell apart. The church has found some opposition, even within the Confucian community, by people who see it as an imitation of Christianity and fear a departure from the teachings of Confucianism.\n\nBesides the nourishment of Chinese culture, the Holy Church's constitution also mentions the aim of maintaining the \"religious ecology\" (宗教生态 \"zōngjiào shēngtài\") of Chinese society through the absorption and reinterpretation of alien religions and heterodox cults into Confucianism.\n\nThe Holy Confucian Church is a highly structured institution both in its doctrine of the faith and in its organisation. The reference to its \"holiness\" in its name means that the church reflects the sacred order of nature in holidays, ancestral ties and the environment.\n\nIts local congregations (孔圣堂 \"Kǒngshèngtáng\") are at the same times schools and temples (学庙和一 \"xué miào hé yī\") for the education of the individuals and the moral reconstitution of society, the filial way (孝慈之道 \"xiàocí zhī dào\") and spiritual home (精神家园 \"jīngshén jiāyuán\") of Chinese life. Its worship halls are called \"dàochǎng\" (道场 \"place of the way\"), a term for wide worship halls.\n\nIn order to develop independently from the support of sponsors as it was the case in the first months after its creation, in 2010 the Holy Confucian Church of Shenzhen adopted a \"sustainable development model\", also termed the \"Shenzhen model\" by the media. The policy implies the self-support of the Church through wedding and funeral rites, and through schools of \"Confucian corporate culture\" for business companies. The goal of the church is to provide non-profit services, and it offers education, rituals and other activities which are free of charge.\n\nThe nationwide Holy Confucian Church created in 2015 plans to replicate the Shenzhen model all over China and abroad and form missionary institutes and community-oriented lecture circuits, and Confucian schools. These objectives will be financed by integrated social donations and funding members, contributions from local government for public services at Temples of Confucius, its industrial platform, and other resources.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2103537", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2103537", "title": "Hospitality", "text": "Hospitality\n\nHospitality refers to the relationship between a guest and a host, wherein the host receives the guest with goodwill, including the reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers. Louis, chevalier de Jaucourt describes hospitality in the Encyclopédie as the virtue of a great soul that cares for the whole universe through the ties of humanity.\n\nHospitality ethics is a discipline that studies this usage of hospitality.\n\nDerives from the Latin \"hospes\", meaning \"host\", \"guest\", or \"stranger\". \"Hospes\" is formed from \"hostis\", which means \"stranger\" or \"enemy\" (the latter being where terms like \"hostile\" derive). By metonymy the Latin word 'Hospital' means a guest-chamber, guest's lodging, an inn. Hospes/hostis is thus the root for the English words , hospitality, hospice, hostel and hotel.\n\nIn ancient cultures hospitality involved welcoming the stranger and offering him food, shelter, and safety.\n\nIn Ancient Greece, hospitality was a right, with the host being expected to make sure the needs of his guests were met. The ancient Greek term \"xenia\", or \"theoxenia\" when a god was involved, expressed this ritualized guest-friendship relation. In Greek society a person's ability to abide by the laws of hospitality determined nobility and social standing. The Stoics regarded hospitality as a duty inspired by Zeus himself.\n\nIn India and Nepal hospitality is based on the principle \"Atithi Devo Bhava\", meaning \"the guest is God\". This principle is shown in a number of stories where a guest is revealed to be a god who rewards the provider of hospitality. From this stems the Indian or Nepal practice of graciousness towards guests at home and in all social situations. The \"Tirukkuṛaḷ,\" an ancient Indian work on ethics and morality, explains the ethics of hospitality through its verses 81 through 90, dedicating a separate chapter on it (Chapter 9).\n\nJudaism praises hospitality to strangers and guests based largely on the examples of Abraham and Lot in the Book of Genesis ( and ). In Hebrew, the practice is called \"hachnasat orchim\", or \"welcoming guests\". Besides other expectations, hosts are expected to provide nourishment, comfort, and entertainment for their guests, and at the end of the visit, hosts customarily escort their guests out of their home, wishing them a safe journey.\n\nIn Christianity, hospitality is a virtue which is a reminder of sympathy for strangers and a rule to welcome visitors. This is a virtue found in the Old Testament, with, for example, the custom of the foot washing of visitors or the kiss of peace. It was taught by Jesus in the New Testament. Indeed, Jesus said that those who had welcomed a stranger had welcomed him. Some Western countries have developed a host culture for immigrants, based on the bible.\n\nOne of the main principles of Pashtunwali is Melmastia. This is the display of hospitality and profound respect to all visitors (regardless of race, religion, national affiliation or economic status) without any hope of remuneration or favour. Pashtuns will go to great lengths to show their hospitality.\n\nIslam highly recommends one another to say peace be upon you salam Wa Alaikum to one another as Muhammad had said,\nMuslims are obliged to treat their guest with kindness and peace even prisoners (in war), As Muhammad had said in authentic sources and verses from the Quran\n\nAbu Aziz ibn Umair reported: I was among the prisoners of war on the day of the battle of Badr. Muhammad had said, “I enjoin you to treat the captives well.” After I accepted Islam, I was among the Ansar (Inhabitants of Madinah) and when the time of lunch or dinner arrived, I would feed dates to the prisoners for I had been fed bread due to the command of Muhammad. al-Mu’jam al-Kabīr 18444\n\nInvite (all) to the Way of thy Lord with wisdom and beautiful preaching; and argue with them in ways that are best and most gracious: Quran\n\nGood hospitality is crucial in Islam even in business According to another report, Muhammad passed by a pile of food in the market. He put his hand inside it and felt dampness, although the surface was dry. He said:\n“O owner of the food, what is this?’\nThe man said, ‘It was damaged by rain, O Messenger of God.’\nHe said, ‘Why did you not put the rain-damaged food on top so that people could see it! Whoever cheats us is not one of us.” (Saheeh Muslim)\n\nCeltic societies also valued the concept of hospitality, especially in terms of protection. A host who granted a person's request for refuge was expected not only to provide food and shelter for his/her guest, but to make sure they did not come to harm while under their care.\n\nIn the West today hospitality is rarely a matter of protection and survival and is more associated with etiquette and entertainment. However, it still involves showing respect for one's guests, providing for their needs, and treating them as equals. Cultures and subcultures vary in the extent to which one is expected to show hospitality to strangers, as opposed to personal friends or members of one's ingroup.\n\nJacques Derrida offers a model to understand hospitality that divides unconditional hospitality from conditional hospitality. Over the centuries, philosophers have devoted considerable attention to the problem of hospitality. However, hospitality offers a paradoxical situation (like language) since inclusion of those who are welcomed in the sacred law of hospitality implies others will be rejected. Julia Kristeva (1991) alerts readers to the dangers of “perverse hospitality”, which consists of taking advantage of the vulnerability of aliens to dispossess them. Hospitality serves to reduce the tension in the process of host-guest encounters, producing a liminal zone that combines curiosity about others and fear of strangers. In general terms, the meaning of hospitality centres on the belief that strangers should be assisted and protected while traveling. However, not all voices are in agreement with this concept. Professor Anthony Pagden describes how the concept of hospitality was historically manipulated to legitimate the conquest of Americas by imposing the right of free transit, which was conducive to the formation of the modern nation-state. This suggests that hospitality is a political institution which can be ideologically deformed to oppress others.\n\n\n"}

This “Jewish Ismailism” consisted of adapting Ismaili doctrines about cosmology, prophecy and hermeneutics. There are many examples of the Brethren of Purity influencing Yemenite Jewish philosophers and authors in the period 1150-1550.\n\nFor example, chapter two of the Judaeo-Arabic theologic-philosophical work by Natan'el al-Fayyumi, \"The Garden of Intellects\" (\"Bustan al-‘uqul\"), written in Yemen in 1165, includes a correspondence between the numbers 1 through 10 and ten scientific and philosophical concepts (soul's faculties, senses, directions, bodily substances and parts, etc.) most of which are identical to those listed by the Brethren of Purity.\n\nSome traces of Brethren of Purity doctrines, as well as of their numerology or Hurufism, are found in two Yemenite philosophical midrashim written in 1420-1430: \"\"The Glad Learning\" (Midrash ha-hefez) by \"Zerahyah ha-Rofé\" (\"Yahya al-Tabib\") and the \"Lamp of Intellects\"\" (\"Siraj al-‘uqul\") by Hoter ben Solomon.

Prior to the appointment at the Supreme Court, Justice Iqbal shortly tenured as the Chief Justice of the Balochistan High Court which lasted only a month.\n\nDuring his career as jurist, he has heard and led high-profile cases, including the case of suspension of fellow chief justice Iftikhar Chaudhry and the trial of missing persons in 2012. His credential led to the government appointing him as a chairman of the Abbottabad Commission to find out the preludes and causes of the unilateral raid conducted by the United States in Abbottabad, Khyber Pakhyunkhwa Province of Pakistan in 2011. After carefully studying the case, Justice Iqbal authored the papers over this issue which was submitted to the Prime Minister of Pakistan in 2013.\n\nJaved Iqbal was born on 1 August 1946 & raised in Quetta. After graduating from the Sandman High School (SHC) in Quetta, he moved to Lahore, Punjab Province to study law.\n\nAdmitted at the Punjab University, he obtained LLB degree in 1968, and MA degree in Political science in 1970 from the Punjab University. For his advanced studies, Iqbal went to Australia where he attended the University of Western Australia, subsequently submitting his thesis to obtained LLM degree in International law in 1971.\n\nIn 1971, he moved to his native city, Quetta, where he became Public prosecutor and government pleader at the Balochistan High Court. In 1973, he joined the law branch of the Government of Balochistan Province which he retained until 1977. Iqbal later acted as the Deputy Secretary at the Law Department in 1981 and later served as the Officiating Secretary Law till 1982. The same year he resigned from the provincial government's legal branch after accepting the professorship in law at the Balochistan University and became honorary lecturer at the Balochistan University.\n\nIn 1982, he was appointed as a session judge at the district court, and gave verdicts in anti-corruption and custom cases.

In it he describes his conception of justice. It comprises two main principles of liberty and equality; the second is subdivided into Fair Equality of Opportunity and the Difference Principle.\n\nRawls arranges the principles in 'lexical priority', prioritising in the order of the Liberty Principle, Fair Equality of Opportunity and the Difference Principle. This order determines the priorities of the principles if they conflict in practice. The principles are, however, intended as a single, comprehensive conception of justice—'Justice as Fairness'—and not to function individually. These principles are always applied so as to ensure that the \"least advantaged\" are benefitted and not hurt or forgotten.\n\nRawls presented the theory in the famous \"A Theory of Justice\", subsequently revising it in \"Political Liberalism\".\n\nThe first and most important principle states that every individual has an equal right to basic liberties, Rawls claiming \"that certain rights and freedoms are more important or 'basic' than others\". For example, Freeman argues, Rawls believes that \"personal property\" – personal belongings, a home – constitutes a basic liberty, but an absolute right to unlimited private property is not. As basic liberties, these rights are inalienable: no government can amend, infringe or remove such rights from individuals. Thomas Mertens says Rawls contends that principles for a society are just when chosen by representative citizens placed within \"fair\" conditions.\n\nIn \"A Theory of Justice\", Rawls articulates the Liberty Principle as the most extensive basic liberty compatible with similar liberty for others; he later amended this in \"Political Liberalism\", stating instead that \"each person has an equal claim to a fully adequate scheme of equal basic rights and liberties\".\n\nThe Equality Principle is the component of Justice as Fairness establishing distributive justice. Rawls awards the Fair Equality of Opportunity Principle lexical priority over the Difference Principle: a society cannot arrange inequalities to maximize the share of the least advantaged whilst not allowing access to certain offices or positions.\n\nThis principle maintains that \"offices and positions\" should be open to any individual, regardless of his or her social background, ethnicity or sex. It is stronger than 'Formal Equality of Opportunity' in that Rawls argues that an individual should not only have the \"right\" to opportunities, but should have an \"effective\" equal chance as another of similar natural ability.\n\nThe Difference Principle regulates inequalities: it only permits inequalities that work to the advantage of the worst-off. This is often misinterpreted as trickle-down economics; Rawls' argument is more accurately expressed as a system where wealth \"diffuses up\". By guaranteeing the worst-off in society a fair deal, Rawls compensates for naturally occurring inequalities (talents that one is born with, such as a capacity for sport).\n\nRawls justifies the Difference Principle on the basis that, since Fair Equality of Opportunity has lexical priority, the Just choice from Pareto optimal scenarios which could occur would be that benefiting the worst-off rather than the best-off.\n\nA key component of Rawls' argument is his claim that his Principles of Justice would be chosen by parties in the original position. This is a thought experiment in which the parties select principles that will determine the basic structure of the society they will live in. This choice is made from behind a veil of ignorance, which would deprive participants of information about their particular characteristics: his or her ethnicity, social status, gender and, crucially, their conception of The Good. This forces participants to select principles impartially and rationally.\n\n"}

Pirsig, who is best known for \"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\". \"Lila: An Inquiry into Morals\" was a nominated finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1992. This semi-autobiographical story takes place in the autumn as the author sails his boat down the Hudson River. Phaedrus, the author's alter ego, is jarred out of his solitary routine by an encounter with Lila, a straightforward but troubled woman who is nearing a mental breakdown.\n\nThe main goal of this book is to develop a complete metaphysical system based on the idea of Quality introduced in his first book. As in his previous book, the narrative is embedded between rounds of philosophical discussion. Unlike his previous book, in which he creates a dichotomy between Classical and Romantic Quality, this book centers on the division of Quality into the Static and the Dynamic. According to the novel, the known universe can be divided into four Static values: inorganic, biological, social, and intellectual. Everything in the known universe can be categorized into one of these four categories, except Dynamic Quality. Because Dynamic Quality is indefinable, the novel discusses the interactions between the four Static values and the Static values themselves.\n\nAnother goal of this book is to critique the field of anthropology. Pirsig claims traditional objectivity renders the field ineffective. He then turns his concept of Quality toward an explanation of the difficulties Western society has had in understanding the values and perspectives of American Indians. One interesting conclusion is that modern American culture is the result of a melding of Native American and European values.\n\nAnother theme analyzed using the Metaphysics of Quality is the interaction between intellectual and social patterns. Pirsig states that until the end of the Victorian era, social patterns dominated the conduct of members of the American culture. In the aftermath of World War I, intellectual patterns and the scientific method acceded to that position, becoming responsible for directing the nation's goals and actions. The later occurrences of fascism are seen as an anti-intellectual struggle to return social patterns to the dominant position. The hippie movement, having perceived the flaws inherent in both social and intellectual patterns, sought to transcend them, but failed to provide a stable replacement, degenerating instead into lower level biological patterns as noted in its calls for free love.\n\nAlthough Pirsig attended graduate studies of Hindu philosophy at Banaras Hindu University and also attended Ramlila celebrations in India, the name of the female character is only accidentally the same as the Hindu concept of Lila. \"I asked Pirsig ... he said it was like 'lilac,' and that, 'it was the unsubtlety of the lilac odour and the hardiness of the bush that helped suggest her name to me.'\"\n\nIn an interview, the author said that he was disappointed that more 'seriously thinking people' did not really understand his ideas entirely. Many people, he said, wrote to him that they re-read the book many times but still didn't really understand it, adding \"I have read many reviews criticizing my ideas, but I have yet to see anything that proves me wrong. I'd like to give a prize to the first person who can convince me that my ideas about a metaphysics of quality are wrong.\"\n\n"}

The Lindisfarne Association is named for Lindisfarne Priory—a monastery, known for the Lindisfarne Gospels, founded on the British island of Lindisfarne in the 7th century.\n\nAdvertising executive Gene Fairly had just left his position at Interpublic Group of Companies and begun studying Zen Buddhism when he read a review of Thompson's \"At the Edge of History\" in the \"New York Times\". Fairly visited Thompson at York University in Toronto to discuss forming a group for the promotion of planetary culture. Upon returning to New York he raised $150,000 from such donors as Nancy Wilson Ross and Sydney and Jean Lanier. Support from these donors served as an entrée to the Rockefeller Brothers Fund.\n\nLindisfarne was incorporated as a non-profit educational foundation in December 1972. It began operations at a refitted summer camp in Southampton, New York on August 31, 1973.\n\nFrom 1974–1977 Lindisfarne held an annual conference \"to explore the new planetary culture\" with the following themes:\n\n\"Earth's answer : explorations of planetary culture at the Lindisfarne conferences\" (1977) reprints some of the lectures given at the 1974 and 1975 conferences.\n\nThe Lindisfarne Association was first based in Southampton, New York in 1973 and then in Manhattan at the Church of the Holy Communion and Buildings which was leased to Lindisfarne from 1976–1979.\n\nAs Lindisfarne began to run low on funding, it faced the loss of its lease on the Church of the Holy Communion. At a conference at the New Alchemy Institute in Cape Cod, Massachusetts, Petro-Canada CEO and United Nations official Maurice Strong offered to donate land from his ranch in Crestone, Colorado. Thompson chose 77 acres of land near Spanish Creek—self-reportedly because his \"Irish Druid Radar\" had gone off while driving past—where Lindisfarne began to construct new buildings for its purposes. \n\nToday the Lindisfarne Fellows House, the Lindisfarne Chapel, and the Lindisfarne Mountain Retreat are under the ownership and management of the Crestone Mountain Zen Center. Lindisfarne has functioned variously as a sponsor of classes, conferences, and concerts and public lectures events, and as a think tank and retreat, similar to the Esalen Institute in California. Lindisfarne functioned as a not-for-profit foundation until 2009; the Lindisfarne Fellowship continued to hold annual meetings until 2012. It is no longer an active organization.\n\nIn addition to its facility in Crestone (the \"Lindisfarne Mountain Retreat\"), three other branches of the organization were formed: \n\nThe Lindisfarne doctrine is closely related to that of its founder, William Thompson. Mentioned as part of the Lindisfarne ideology are a long list of spiritual and esoteric traditions including yoga, Tibetan Buddhism, Chinese traditional medicine, Hermeticism, Celtic animism, Gnosticism, cabala, geomancy, ley lines, Pythagoreanism, and ancient mystery religions.\n\nThe group placed a special emphasis on sacred geometry, defined by Thompson as \"a vision of divine intelligence, the logos, revealing itself in all forms, from the logarithmic spiral of a seashell to the hexagonal patterns of cooling basalt, from the architecture of the molecule to the galaxy.\" Rachel Fletcher, Robert Lawlor, and Keith Critchlow lectured at Crestone on the application of sacred geometry, Platonism, and Pythagoreanism to architecture. The exemplar of these ideas is the Grail Chapel in Crestone (also known as Lindisfarne Chapel), which is built to reflect numerous basic geometrical relationships.\n\nLindisfarne's social agenda was exemplified by the \"meta-industrial village\", a small community focused on subsistence and crafts while yet connected to a world culture. All members of a community might participate in essential tasks such as the harvest. (Thompson has speculated that the United States, 40% of the population could work at agriculture, and another 40% in social services.) The villages would have a sense of shared purpose in transforming world culture. They would combine \"the four classical economies of human history, hunting and gathering, agriculture, industry, and cybernetics\", all \"recapitulated within a single deme.\"\n\nThe villages would be linked together by an electronic information network (i.e., what today we call the internet). Thompson called for a counter-cultural vanguard \"which can formulate an integral vision of culture and maintain the high standards of that culture without compromise to the forces of electronic vulgarization.\" \n\nAccording to the Lindisfarne Association website, Lindisfarne's fourfold goals are:\n\nThompson has also stated the United States has a unique role to play in the promotion of planetary culture because people from all over the world mingle there.\n\nLindisfarne sought to spread its message widely, through a mailing list and through book publications of the Lindisfarne press.\n\nJournalist Sally Helgesen, after a visit in 1977, criticized Lindisfarne as confused pseudo-intellectuals, citing for example their attempt to build an expensive fish \"bioshelter\" while overlooking a marsh with fish in it.\n\nMembers of the Lindisfarne Fellowship have included, among others:\n\n\nThe Lindisfarne Association disbanded as a not-for-profit institution in 2009. The Lindisfarne Fellows continued to meet once a year up to 2012 at varying locations as an informal group interested in one another's creative projects.\n\n\nSee also William Irwin Thompson, \"Afterword\" to DARKNESS AND SCATTERED LIGHT (New York: Doubleday, 1978), 181-183.\n\n"}

It is developed by Magnolia International Ltd., based in Basel, Switzerland. It is based on Content repository API for Java (JSR-283).\n\nMagnolia CMS is a Java-based content management system that uses a JCR repository to store, retrieve and search data. In this respect Magnolia is similar to Adobe Experience Manager, Hippo CMS and Jahia which also use JCR. Magnolia uses Apache Jackrabbit, the JCR reference implementation by default. It is possible to use another JSR-170 certified repository implementation such as Modeshape.\n\nIn Magnolia, Jackrabbit persists data to the H2 database by default. A light-weight embedded H2 database contains the Magnolia software, configuration, and two demonstration websites in a single download for trying out the system. For production environments other databases such as MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL or Oracle can be used.\n\nMagnolia CMS is distributed as two web applications: an author instance and a public instance. Editors work on the author instance which typically resides in a secure location behind a firewall, inaccessible from the Internet. Editors publish content to a public instance which serves the content to visitors on the Web. The public instance resides in a location that can be reached from the Internet or an intranet. A typical Magnolia CMS production setup consists of at least two public instances. More instances can be created to meet site load and availability needs.\n\nMagnolia CMS has a modular architecture. The system core and features such as the page editor, digital asset management and cache are packaged into separate modules. The module mechanism is also used to package and deploy websites built with Magnolia CMS. The templates, themes and functionality used on a website are split into separate modules.\n\nModularity allows site administrators to install and uninstall functionality according to a project's requirements. Encapsulating functionality into discrete modules also promotes separation of concerns: one team can work on website templates while another team develops apps, for example.\n\nAt the file system level a Magnolia module is a JAR, a Java file format used to package Java class files and resources (images, CSS, JavaScript) into one file. Deploying a Magnolia module involves copying the JAR file into the Java application server and restarting the Magnolia instance. Magnolia CMS recognizes the JAR file during the startup process and installs the module.\n\nMagnolia International Ltd. provides commonly used feature modules such as Commenting and Personalization. The user community has developed further modules for specific tasks such as for checking broken links.\n\nMagnolia clients come primarily from financial services, government and media. The system is best suited for organizations that have complex integration requirements and sufficient IT resources to customize the product to their needs. Significant Java expertise is needed to take advantage of Magnolia's open-source architecture and to integrate the CMS with existing systems. The company has indicated that a file-system based development approach makes the product less demanding of Java skills.\n\nMagnolia Conference is an annual event for CMS developers and digital marketing users. The conference is a place to meet other users, share best practices, and learn about product updates. A technical presentation track targets software developers, focusing on integrations and CMS implementation cases. In 2015, Magnolia added a digital business presentation track where talks focus on content challenges that businesses are facing and how they are using the product build their brands on the Web.\n\nThe conference also includes a community unconference where attendees themselves are responsible for proposing, voting for and presenting talks which everyone is free to choose to attend.\n\n"}

Born to Danish parents, he began his studies in France and emigrated to the United States in 1986. He is the author of many works on the history and philosophy of psychiatry, psychoanalysis and hypnosis. His constructivist analysis of the co-production of psychical \"facts\" emphasises the accuracy of historical accounts of mental disorders. He is known for his positions in virulent debates about psychoanalysis – called the \"Freud Wars\" – especially with regard to his 2005 publication of \"Le Livre noir de la psychanalyse\" (\"The Black Book of Psychoanalysis\"). In a review entitled \"Folies à plusieurs. De l'hystérie à la dépression\" (\"Many madnesses. From hysteria to depression\"), Pierre-Henri Castel calls Borch-Jacobsen \"one of the most polemic thinkers with regard to the \"Freud Wars\"\".\n\nBorch-Jacobsen studied philosophy with Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe and Jean-Luc Nancy, two philosophers close in thought to, and in dialogue with, Jacques Derrida and Jacques Lacan.\n\nIn 1981 at the University of Strasbourg he submitted his doctoral dissertation on \"The Freudian Subject\" and then began teaching in the department of Psychoanalysis at Vincennes University in Paris, where Jacques Lacan had first made his mark.\n\nIn 1986 he emigrated to the United States.\n\nIn 1983, Borch-Jacobsen participated in a meeting on the subject of hypnosis at the Hôpital Fernand-Widal where he joined such other as Léon Chertok, René Girard and François Roustang in the discussion of hypnosis. The following year, he published with Éric Michaud and Jean-Luc Nancy, \"Hypnoses\". In this book, the authors consider the whole history of therapeutic hypnosis, the psychological or sociological theory becoming suspect to dangerous regressions from intellectual, ethical and political ideas.\n\nOn 21 January 1985, he presented a conference paper entitled \"L'hypnose dans la psychanalyse\" (\"Hypnosis in psychoanalysis\") to the Society of Psychosomatic Medicine. The text of this paper was then published in collaboration with Chertok in 1987, with replies from many psychoanalysists, philosophers and sociologists, such as Georges Lapassade, Octave Mannoni and Franklin Rausky.\n\nIn this paper, Borch-Jacobsen presented evidence that psychoanalytic transference is a form of altered state of consciousness, comparable with those that had existed in the work of pschotherapies which predate psychoanalysis, from Shamanism to the hypnotism of the Nancy School, by way of animal magnetism. He averred that \"\" (\"On Freud's own admission, the phenomenon of transference is nothing other than the resurgence, in the bosom of [psycho]analytical techniques, of the characteristic relationship (of 'rapport') of hypnosis techniques: dependence, submission, or again... exclusive worship of the doctor\"). He emphasised that there is consequently an important risk of suggestion on the part of the psychoanalyst, even more so when the psychoanalyst himself is not conscious of these phenomena.\n\nBorch-Jacobsen then reaffirmed that Sigmund Freud, after having started to use suggestive hypnotic psychotherapy on Hippolyte Bernheim in 1887 replaced it with the cathartic method in 1899, no longer using hypnosis as a means of direct suggestion, but to bring out suppressed feelings of patients' traumas. After practicing using free association in 1892, Freud totally abandoned hypnosis at the end of 1896. This is explained in the following manner by Chertok: \"\" (\"In his opposition to hypnosis, Freud was known to have founded a scientific psychotherapy, destined, as such, to become the psychotherapy \"par excellence\". The interpretation and the capture of consciousness thus becomes the fulcrum of the cure. The effectiveness of the new method certainly could not be discounted, but in it one can find it being channelled into transference, and by that, come to dominate the consciousness and put it to work. Such was the ambition of the Founder of Psychoanalysis [Freud], and the turn of the century was once again filled with positivity\"). It is precisely this posture of Freud's that the consciousness is \"dominated\" that was put into question by Borch-Jacobsen.\n\nBertrand Méheust rebuked Borch-Jacobsen for accepting without further discussion a dated view of hypnotherapy, bequeathed by the positivist institutional medicine of the 19th century. Furthermore, he argues that hypnosis follows a state of absolute passivity and therefore hurts well-being, and that hypnosis is induced in someone in which all consciousness is disconnected, a being totally immersed in the inner self, indeed a puppet who thinks and lives totally by the workings of another. He takes sides with Armand Marie Jacques de Chastenet de Puységur and Joseph Philippe François Deleuze, stating that lucid, magnetic phenomena are assumed to establish a kind of synergy between the higher functions of intelligence and the immediacy of instinct.\n\nIn 1996 he completed a treatise on the case of Bertha Pappenheim, \"Anna O.\", subtitled (\"A 100-year-old mystery\"), in which, according to Claude Meyer, he \"\" (\"put an end to one of the founding myths of psychoanalysis\"). It is also the opinion of Elizabeth Loentz, who had also written a book on Pappenheim, and Paul Roazen, who considers this work a major stage of university and historiographical work on psychoanalysis, and a fly in the ointment of the \"defenders of the status quo\".\n\nIn 2005 he collaborated in writing (\"The Black Book of Psychoanalysis\"), a book which received a great reception and has been the subject of several commentaries.\n\n\n\n"}

He was a friend to Tommaso Campanella and Giordano Bruno and a member of the Accademia dei Lincei.\n\nHe was an adherent of Copernican heliocentrism and of Bruno's ideas on Hermeticism and magic. He believed in the complex Pythagorean and Brunian cosmologies, including the view that the planets and stars were like the earth, covered in plants and animals:\n\"Stigliola said to me...that it seemed irrational to him that bodies so much larger than the earth and the space between the centre of the earth to the moon should be composed simply of idle fire, and not instead of all manner of elements and plants and animals and men, just as our countryman Philolaus held.\"\nIndeed, Stigliola and Bruno were born just two years apart in the same region of southern Italy, Nola, and in the same town of Monte Cicala.\n\nEarly studies and life in Naples\nStigliola studied medicine at the University of Salerno, gaining his degree in 1571, after which he lived in Naples. There, he published \"Theriace et Mithridatia Libellus\" (1577), a polemic defending his teacher Maranta on the use of theria (a subclass of mammals), against the medical school at Padua - an effort that meant he could not progress as a medical student.\nInstead, he turned his attentions to architecture and teaching. He became, in the 1580s, topographer to the city of Naples, and developed new plans for the city's port and city wall, neither of which were implemented. Instead, he turned to teaching, perhaps medicine as well as architecture. He was said to have had, at one time, 400 students.\nHe also turned his hand to the very risky business of printing, establishing a press on the Porta Reale from 1593 to 1606.

The Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League (UNIA-ACL) formally adopted it on August 13, 1920 in Article 39 of the Declaration of the Rights of the Negro Peoples of the World, during its month-long convention at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Variations of the flag can and have been used in various countries and territories in the Americas to represent Garveyist ideologies.\n\nThe flag was created in 1920 by members of UNIA in response to the enormously popular 1900 coon song \"Every Race Has a Flag but the Coon\". which has been cited as one of the three songs that \"firmly established the term \"coon\" in the American vocabulary\". In a 1927 report of a 1921 speech appearing in the \"Negro World\" weekly newspaper, Marcus Garvey was quoted as saying:\n\nThe \"Universal Negro Catechism\", published by the UNIA in 1921, refers to the colors of the flag meaning:\n\nJournalist Charles Mowbray White has asserted that Garvey proposed the colors red, black and green for the following reasons: \"Garvey said red because of sympathy for the 'Reds of the world', and the Green their sympathy for the Irish in their fight for freedom, and the Black [for] the Negro.\"\n\nAccording to the UNIA as of recent; the three colors on the Black Nationalist flag represent:\n\nThe flag later became a Black Nationalist symbol for the worldwide liberation of Black people. As an emblem of Black pride, the flag became popular during the Black Liberation movement of the 1960s. In 1971, the school board of Newark, New Jersey, passed a resolution permitting the flag to be raised in public school classrooms. Four of the board's nine members were not present at the time, and the resolution was introduced by the board's teen member, a mayoral appointee. Fierce controversy ensued, including a court order that the board show cause why they should not be forced to rescind the resolution, and at least two state legislative proposals to ban ethnic flags and national flags (other than the U.S. flag) in public classrooms.\n\nIn the United States, the flag is presently widely available through flag shops or ethnic specialty stores. It is commonly seen at parades commemorating Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, civil rights rallies, and other special events.\n\nIn the United States, following the refusal of a grand jury to indict a police officer in the August 9, 2014 shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, a Howard University student replaced the U.S. flag on that school's Washington, DC campus flagpole with a Black Nationalist flag flying at half-mast. The incident resulted in the university president, Wayne Frederick, issuing a statement disapproving the flag-raising by unauthorized personnel.\n\nThe flag goes by several other names with varying degrees of popularity:\n\nThe African National Congress flag is three horizontal stripes, descending black, green, and dark yellow (gold).\nThe United States Postal Service issued a stamp in 1997 to commemorate Kwanzaa with a painting by fine artist Synthia Saint James of a dark-skinned family wearing garments traditional in parts of Africa and fashionable for special occasions among African-Americans. The family members are holding food, gifts, and a flag. The flag in the stamp may have been meant to represent the Pan-African flag, However, instead of the stripes descending red, black, and green, the stamp's flag transposes the top two bands and descends black, red, and green.\n\nIn 2000, artist David Hammons created a work called \"African-American Flag\", which is held by the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. Based on the standard U.S. flag, its stripes are black and red, the field is green, and the stars on the field are black.\n\nIn response to the controversy over the flying of the Confederate flag, an African American-run company called NuSouth created a flag based on the Confederate naval jack, with the white stars and saltire outline replaced by green and the blue saltire made black.\n\nIn 1999, an article appeared in the July 25 edition of \"The Black World Today\" suggesting that, as an act of global solidarity, every August 17 should be celebrated worldwide as Universal African Flag Day by flying the red, black, and green banner. August 17 is the birthday of Marcus Garvey.\n\n\n\n"}

Among these were members of the previous government, corrupt officials, \"lazy workers\", and supposed counter-revolutionaries.\n\nSankara came to power in what was then the Republic of Upper Volta through a military coup in 1983, and immediately set about to transform society through what he dubbed the \"Democratic and Popular Revolution\" (). The Popular Revolutionary Tribunals, formed in October 1983, were inspired by a number of historical predecessors, among them the Revolutionary Tribunal of the French Revolution and the \"revtribunals\" of the October Revolution, along with their equivalents during the Cuban Revolution, as well as more directly by the contemporary people's courts established by Jerry Rawlings in Ghana. Another important tool of the Burkinabé attempt at a social revolution was the Committees for the Defense of the Revolution (). The TPRs were made up of magistrates, soldiers, and members of the Committees.\n\nThe tribunals, which have been alleged to have been only show trials, were intended to be held very openly with oversight from the public. Despite this, some of the trials are said to have been held in secret. The TPRs were initially popular with the people, but became heavy-handed and inefficient. Sankara himself self-critically admitted that the tribunals often were used as occasions to settle private scores, rather than deal revolutionary justice. \n\nAmong those tried by the Popular Revolutionary Tribunals was Colonel Saye Zerbo, military ruler and President of Upper Volta between 1980 and 1982, who was sentenced to 15 years in prison in May 1984 but released already in August 1985. His conviction would later annulled be 18 February 1997 by the supreme court of Burkina Faso. \n\nThe Popular Revolutionary Tribunals, along with the Committees for the Defense of the Revolution, were abolished in 1987 after Thomas Sankara's death at the hands of a military coup led by Blaise Compaoré, his former friend and colleague.

The Nyaya School recognizes \"Pratyaksha\" (perception) as a kind of \"pramana\" along with \"Anumana\" (inference), \"Upamana\" (comparison) and Shabda (verbal testimony); this school recognizes these four kinds only. The Sankhya School does not recognize \"Upamana\" as a \"pramana\". To these four auxiliaries which help illuminate things the Vedantins and the Mimamsakas also add \"Anupalabdhi\" (non-apprehension) and \"Arthapatti\" (presumption)as valid \"pramanas\".\n\n\"Pratyaksha\" is one of the three principal means of knowledge. The three principal means of knowledge are – 1) \"Anumana\", inference from data, which depends for its value on the possession of the right data, on the right observation of the data including the drawing of the right analogies, the unerring perception of true identity and rejection of false identity, the just estimate of difference and contrast, and on the power of right reasoning from the right data; 2) \"Pratyaksha\" which is the process of collecting and knowing the data, and 3) \"Aptavakya\" which is evidence, the testimony of men in possession of the sought after knowledge.\n\n\"Pratyaksha\" refers to the faculties of perception with which are connected thoughts (\"Chinta\"), imagination (\"Kalpana\") and volition (\"Praytna\"), which four together as \"Chetas\" illuminate the \"Manas\", the ordinary mental equipment of the individual, and give awareness or consciousness (\"Chetna\"). There are four types of valid perceptions – a) \"Indriya pratyaksha\" or sense perception, b) \"Manas pratyaksha\" or mental perception, c) \"Svavedana pratyaksha\" or self-consciousness, and d) \"Yoga pratyaksha\" or super normal intuition. In sense perception, which is an indeterminate perception the \"chittashakti\" (intelligence-energy) acts as the substratum of the senses. Mental perception arises when \"chittashakti\", with the aid of \"Buddhi\", reflects upon objects of senses, and is a determinate perception. Self-consciousness arises when, directed by the \"tattvas\" or \"panchakoshas\", \"raga\" (attachment), \"vidya\" (knowledge), \"niyati\" (order of things), \"kala\" (time) and \"kalpa\" (the elements) along with pleasure and pain become objects of knowledge to chit, the intelligence of the self. Super normal intuition is gained after removal of impurities cover the intelligent-self through practice of the eight-fold yogic-discipline.\n\n\"Pratyaksha\" knowledge can be gained through a) Worldly pratyaksha, externally through the five senses and internally through mind, and b) Transcendental \"pratyaksha\" which is divided into \"Samanya\", \"Lakshana\", \"Gyana lakshana\" and \"Yogaja\". \"Pratyaksha\" (apparent or obvious) is divided into \"Savikalpa\", \"Nirvikalpa\" and \"Pratibhigya\". \"Pratyaksha\" knowledge is intuitive in nature and in Yoga and Vedanta is also known as Aparokshanubhuti.\n"}
{"id": "50092683", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50092683", "title": "Presumption (canon law)", "text": "Presumption (canon law)\n\n\"For a look at Presumption in other jurisdictions, see Presumption.\"\n\nPresumption in the canon law of the Catholic Church is a term signifying a reasonable conjecture concerning something doubtful, drawn from arguments and appearances, which by the force of circumstances can be accepted as a proof. It is on this presumption our common adage is based: \"Possession is nine points of the law\". Presumption has its place in canon law only when positive proofs are wanting, and yet the formulation of some judgment is necessary. It is never in itself an absolute proof, as it only presumes that something is true. Canonists divide presumption into:\n\nCanon 1584 of the 1983 Code of Canon Law defines the current canonical jurisprudence around presumption:\n\nThis canon of the 1983 Code removes the distinction between relative and absolute legal presumption that was present in the 1917 Code of Canon Law.\n\nThere are several sub-varieties of presumption of law. The foundation of these legal presumptions is to be sought in the natural conclusions drawn from the ordinary happenings of common life and the consideration of the motives that usually sway men in given circumstances. The general rules are thus formulated: \"What is natural is presumed to be in the person or case in question\"; \"Change is not to be presumed\"; \"Presumption is to be formed from the favourable side\". As to effects, when there is question of presumption \"juris,\" it abstracts from the necessity of proof; not so presumption \"hominis.\" A judge can follow the first in civil cases even when doubt remains, not so the second. The former places the burden of proof on the adversary, but the latter does not. Finally, the first is considered of itself equivalent to proof, while the second needs corroboration from something extraneous to itself.\n\nA legal presumption (\"presumptio juris\") is a presumption that is stated in the positive canon law (\"ab ipsa lege\"). Under the 1917 Code of Canon Law, legal presumption was divided into two kinds: \"juris tantum\" \"which is relative and vincible by both direct and indirect proof to the contrary\", and \"juris et de jure\" or absolute presumption which can only be refuted by indirect proof (undermining the fact(s) upon which the presumption is based). This distinction between the subdivisions of legal presumption, the relative (\"juris simpliciter\") and the absolute (\"juris et de jure\") was not continued into the 1983 Code of Canon Law and was dropped.\n\nThus, it is called presumption of law alone (\"juris tantum\") when a thing is judged to be so until the contrary is proved. Hence the legal formulæ: \"Everyone is presumed innocent until his guilt is proved\"; \"Once bad always bad\" (i. e. in the same species of ill-doing, if amendment is not certain); \"What is known in a remote place is known in a neighbouring place\", and others similar.\n\nIt is denominated presumption \"juris et de jure,\" when the law so strongly supports the presumption that it is held to be certain in judicial proceedings. Against such a presumption no proofs are admitted except the evident truth. Thus, goods described in the inventory made by a guardian are presumed to belong to the possessions of the deceased, nor would the later testimony of the guardian himself to the contrary ordinarily be admitted.\n\nNatural presumptions (\"presumptiones juris naturales\") fall under the definition of \"presumptio hominis\". According to a generally held opinion of canonists, \"presumptions \"hominis\" and \"naturae\" are, in as far as they are moral, in contrast to presumptions \"juris\" or legal presumptions.\"\n\nPresumptions of the natural law are those presumptions that are not stated in the positive canon law, and as such do not constitute \"legal\" presumptions. Some presumptions of the natural law have been incorporated into the \"Rules of Law\". Sometimes judges use natural law presumptions as their basis for judicial presumptions.\n\nAs to the presumption \"judicis\" or \"hominis\", it is denoted by the following:\n\n"}

{"id": "23981046", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23981046", "title": "Susanne Langer", "text": "Susanne Langer\n\nSusanne Katherina Langer (; \"née\" Knauth; December 20, 1895 – July 17, 1985) was an American philosopher, writer, and educator and was well known for her theories on the influences of art on the mind. She was one of the first women in American history to achieve an academic career in philosophy and the first woman to be popularly and professionally recognized as an American philosopher. Langer is best known for her 1942 book entitled, \"Philosophy in a New Key\". In 1960, Langer was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.\n\nBorn Susanne Katherina Knauth, Langer was raised in Manhattan's West Side in New York. She was the daughter of Antonio Knauth, an attorney, and Else Uhlich, both emigrants of Germany. Though she was American born, Langer's primary language was German, as it was strictly spoken in her household throughout her youth, and her German accent remained her entire life. She was exposed thoroughly to creativity and art, most specifically through music. She was taught to play the cello and the piano, and she continued with the cello for the remainder of her life. As a girl, Langer enjoyed reciting the works of great poets as well as traditional children's rhymes and tales. This sparked her love for reading and writing, and she would often write her own poems and stories to entertain her younger siblings. Her love of nature began during the summers her family spent in their cottage on Lake George. She married William Leonard Langer, a fellow student at Harvard in 1921, and in the same year they took their studies to Vienna, Austria. They had two sons and moved back to Cambridge, Massachusetts before the couple divorced in 1942. She died July 17, 1985.\n\nHer early education included attendance at Veltin School for Girls, a private school as well as being tutored from home. In 1916, Langer enrolled at Radcliffe College. She earned the bachelor's degree in 1920 and continued with graduate studies in philosophy at Harvard, where she received the master's diploma in 1924 and the doctorate in 1926. She was a tutor in philosophy at Radcliffe from 1927 to 1942. She lectured in philosophy for one year at the University of Delaware and for five years at Columbia University (1945-1950). From 1954 to 1962 she taught at Connecticut College. She also taught philosophy at the University of Michigan, New York University, Northwestern University, Ohio University, Smith College, Vassar College, the University of Washington, and Wellesley College.\n\nSusanne Langer's unexplored thesis revolving around the connection of consciousness and aesthetics as well as her unusual use of language in her writing ultimately caused her to be scrutinized by her fellow scholars. However, it led her to further explore the complexity and nature of human consciousness.\n\nLanger's philosophy explored the continuous process of meaning-making in the human mind through the power of “seeing” one thing in terms of another. Langer's first major work is entitled, \"Philosophy in a New Key\". It put forth an idea that has become commonplace today: that there is a basic and pervasive human need to symbolize, to invent meanings, and to invest meanings in one’s world.\n\nBeginning with a critique of positivism, the work is a study of human thought progressing from semantic theory through philosophy of music, sketching a theory for all the arts. For Langer, the human mind \"is constantly carrying on a process of symbolic transformation of the experiential data that come to it,\" causing it to be \"a veritable fountain of more or less spontaneous ideas\".\n\nSusanne Langer's distinction between discursive versus presentational symbols is one of her better known concepts. Discursive symbolization arranges elements (not necessarily words) with stable and context invariant meanings into a new meaning. Presentation symbolization operates independently of elements with fixed and stable meanings. The presentation cannot be comprehended by progressively building up an understanding of its parts in isolation. It must be understood as a whole. For example, an element used in one painting may be used to articulate an entirely different meaning in another. The same principle applies to a note in a musical arrangement—such elements independently have no fixed meaning except in the context of their entire presentation.\n\nLanger believed that symbolism is the central concern of philosophy because it underlies all human knowing and understanding. As with Ernst Cassirer, Langer believed that what distinguishes humans from animals is the capacity for using symbols. While all animal life is dominated by feeling, human feeling is mediated by conceptions, symbols, and language. Animals respond to signs, but stimulus from a sign is significantly more complex for humans. The perspective also is associated with symbolic communication where animal societies are studied to help understand how symbolic communication affects the conduct of members of a cooperating group.\n\nLanger is one of the earliest philosophers who paid close attention to the concept of the virtual. Inspired by Henri Bergson's notions of matter and memory, she connected art to the concept of the virtual. For her, figuring out the space of an art work by its creator was no less than building a virtual world. She describes virtuality as \"the quality of all things that are created to be perceived.\" For her, the virtual is not only a matter of consciousness, but something external that is created intentionally and existing materially, as a space of contemplation outside of the human mind. Langer sees virtuality as a physical space created by the artist, such as a painting or a building, that is “significant in itself and not as part of the surroundings.” She particularly considers architecture not as the realization of a space for being, but its conceptual translation into virtuality for perceiving: “The architect, in fine, deals with a created space, a virtual entity.” In contrast to Bergson, for Langer, virtuality is tangible and can cause a contemplative interaction between humans and the machine.\n\nIn her later years, Langer came to believe that the decisive task of her work was to construct a science and psychology based theory of the \"life of the mind\" using process philosophy conventions. Langer's final work, \"Mind: An Essay on Human Feeling\" represents the culmination of her attempt to establish a philosophical and scientific underpinning of aesthetic experience, relying on a three volume survey of a comprehensive set of relevant humanistic and scientific texts.\n\nLanger's desire to study the mind and its connections with art was rooted in her theory that works of art are representations of human feeling and expression. This led Langer to construct a biological theory of feeling that explains that \"feeling\" is an inherently biological concept that can be connected to evolutionary genetics. In her essay, \"Mind\", Langer goes into depth to connect the early evolution of man to how we perceive the mind today. She explains that early organisms underwent refinery through natural selection, in which certain behaviors and functions were shaped in order for them to survive. Langer describes the body's organs to all operate within a specific rhythm, and these rhythms must cooperate with one another to keep the organism alive. This development, Langer explains, was the beginning of the framework for the Central Nervous System, which Langer believed to be the heart of cognitive interactions among humans.\n\nSusanne Langer's work with symbolism and meaning has led to her association with contemporary rhetoric, although her influence in the field is somewhat debated. Langer established the use of symbols as the \"epistemic unit of community\", suggesting that all knowledge in a community is gained and built from shared symbol-systems within a given culture. Langer's concept regarding language and dialogue may be understood to imply that language does not simply communicate, but it produces symbols from which humans then create their own reality. Claimed support of this perspective comes from Langer's statement that \"language is intrinsic to thinking, imagining, even our ways of perceiving\".\n\nAccording to Arabella Lyon, professor at State University of New York, Langer holds that meaning arises from the relationship between a community, its discourse, and the individual. Lyon suggests that Langer's work may be viewed as a contradiction to the comparatively traditional theories of Aristotle, by way of Langer's argument that discourse forms through sensory experiences shared between speaker and hearer, rather than through logic as advocated by the philosopher. Langer's epistemic view of symbolism and language, which further examines the motivation of the speaker, the influential aspects of language that affect people, and the relationship between the speaker and the community, are often reflected in aspects of modern rhetorical studies.\n\nLanger's works were largely influenced by fellow philosophers Ernst Cassirer and Alfred North Whitehead. Whitehead, an English mathematician and philosophy professor, was Langer's professor at Radcliffe. Whitehead introduced Langer to the history of human thought, the origins of the modern world, and contemporary philosophy. He helped shape her perspective on these topics which she presented in her first text, The Practice of Philosophy. Throughout her career, Whitehead continued to influence her understanding of the complicated world of human thought which guided her to pursue a philosophical career. She shared Whitehead’s belief in going beyond the limitations of scientific research and believed that along with the new-found thinking and ideas that had initiated the modern era in science and philosophy, the opportunity for a rebirth of philosophical creativity would arise. Langer dedicated Philosophy in a New Key, to \"Alfred North Whitehead, my great Teacher and Friend.\"\n\nSusanne Langer's other main influence was the German philosopher Ernst Cassirer. Cassirer was a neo-Kantianist who studied the field of theories of symbolization. Cassirer influenced much of Langer's ides in \"Philosophy in a New Key\", where she stated that the creation of symbols is the essential activity of art, myth, rite, the sciences, mathematics, and philosophy. She stated, \"It is a peculiar fact that every major advance in thinking, every epoch-making new insight, springs from a new type of symbolic transformation\". She drew from Cassirer's view in her belief that art theory must be independent with a theory of mind.\n\nSusanne Langer is not an extremely well known philosopher; however, her work has influenced and continues to influence many. As one of the first female philosophers, her work has posed as an inspiration to many fellow women to pursue a future in philosophy and other related fields. Her imaginative views on the connections of art and aesthetics with the human mind were revolutionary during her time and sparked a wide interest in the complexity of human consciousness. Although her work is not often cited by today's philosophers, her theories on presentational symbolic activity are part of the \"collective unconscious\" where philosophy and psychology meet anthropology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He also did a longer interview with the Melbourne radio channel of the network.\n\nSinger also participated in an Ask Me Anything on Reddit, fielding questions about his book, on April 14, 2015 (a week after the book's release).\n\nNicholas Kristof reviewed the book for \"The New York Times\", beginning with a discussion of the earning to give strategy. Kristof had three reservations about the book: (1) it's not clear where to draw the line with respect to altruism, (2) in addition to humanitarian motives, loyalty is also important and many give to universities or the arts out of loyalty, (3) the idea of taking a job solely because it is well-paying made him flinch. Kristof concluded on a positive note: \"Singer’s argument is powerful, provocative and, I think, basically right. The world would be a better place if we were as tough-minded in how we donate money as in how we make it.\"\n\nUniversity of Chicago Law School professor Eric Posner reviewed the book for \"Slate Magazine\", concluding: \"So what’s an effective altruist to do? The utilitarian imperative to search out and help the people with the highest marginal utility of money around the world is in conflict with our limited knowledge about foreign cultures, which makes it difficult for us to figure out what the worst-off people really need.* For this reason, donations to Little League and other local institutions you are familiar with may not be a bad idea. The most good you can do may turn out to be—not much.\" Posner wrote a follow-up post on his personal blog, stressing that in his view Singer's main weakness was that he didn't spend enough time working through the ramifications of the importance of institutions.\n\nMinal Bopaiah wrote a blog post favorably reviewing the book for PSI Impact, a website maintained by Population Services International. PSI was one of many charities discussed by Singer in his book as potentially effective places to donate to.\n\nJohn Abdulla reviewed the book on Oxfam's blog, concluding: \"And so the question that remains for me, as I think more about the ideas laid out in this book, is how can I challenge myself to do more good in this world?\"\n\nGlenn C. Altschuler, professor of American Studies at Cornell University, reviewed the book for Philly.com, concluding: \"Singer opens up worthwhile conversations (and practical applications) related to ethical ideals. At minimum, The Most Good You Can Do can stimulate donors to insist that charitable organizations provide persuasive proof of their effectiveness.\"\n"}

He was critical of Buddhism, Confucianism and Shintoism. Whereas each of these traditions drew on history as a source of authority, Tominaga saw appeals to history as a pseudo-justification for innovations that try to outdo other sects vying for power. For example, he cited the various Confucian Masters who saw human nature as partially good, neither good nor bad, all good, and inherently bad; analysing later interpreters who tried to incorporate and reconcile all Masters. He criticised Shintoism as obscurantist, especially in its habit of secret instruction. As he always said, \"hiding is the beginning of lying and stealing\".\n\nIn his study of Buddhist scriptures, he asserted that Hinayana school of scriptures preceded Mahayana scriptures but also asserted that the vast majority of Hinayana scriptures are also composed much later than the life of Gautama Buddha, the position which was later supported by modern scriptural studies. His work represents an early and indigenous example of Buddhist studies and reflects awareness of Manichaeism and its possible relationship with Buddhism. While Michael Pye has argued that Tominaga represents a non-European example of religious studies, this view has been challenged by Jason Josephson, who argues that Tominaga does not treat non-Buddhist traditions as systematic religions. \n\n"}

Liu Dalin, among the first sexologists in Mainland China, estimates that 90% of gay Chinese men marry a heterosexual woman, while in the United States, only 15-20% of gay men marry. Sexologist and sociologist Li Yinhe (李银河) believes there are 20 million male homosexuals in China, 80% of whom marry a woman.\nGay Chinese men are under social pressure to marry and produce a male heir to continue the family line, as Confucianism places a strong emphasis on this.\n\nThe word combines the \"tong\" from tongzhi (slang for \"gay\") with \"qi\" (\"wife\").\n\nVery few of the women who enter into these marriages are aware that their spouses are gay. Many women have turned to social media because it allows them to maintain anonymity while expressing their feelings about being married to gay men. The majority of these women worry more about the social stigma of being divorced in Chinese society than they do about being in a loveless marriage. For the men, the shame of being stigmatized as homosexual causes them to enter these marriages in the first place. In addition to the emotional toll of being married to a man who does not desire them physically, nearly 90% of these women suffer physical abuse and \"sexual apathy\" from their husbands. Many women who are married to gay men in China are dependent on the men for financial survival. Even with a divorce, they can be left with social and financial hardships. Only 31.2% of tongqi marriages end in divorce, according to a recent survey. Divorce laws in China do not allow women to seek a dissolution of marriage from their husbands if they are gay.\n\nA lot of these women are speaking out against China's policy against same sex marriage beyond chat rooms. Recently, tongqi have been seen marching in Hong Kong's gay rights parade to bring visibility to their plight. A new trend among Chinese gay men and lesbian is arrangements called cooperation marriages, where they marry each other publicly while living with a same sex partner in private. There are services which are available to assist in the matching of gay men to lesbians for the purposes of marriage. Research has been conducted about the plight of tongqi by the Harbin Institute of Technology for the first time that encourages the acceptance of gays, to reduce the number of women subjected to these marriages.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "30802041", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30802041", "title": "Whitehead Research Project", "text": "Whitehead Research Project\n\nThe Whitehead Research Project (WRP) is dedicated to the research of, and scholarship on, the texts, philosophy, and life of Alfred North Whitehead. It explores and analyzes the relevance of Whitehead's thought in dialogue with contemporary philosophies in order to unfold his philosophy of organism and its consequences for our time and in relation to emerging philosophical thought. Of particular interest is the investigation into the emergence of Whitehead's philosophy in the context of British and American pragmatism, its complicated relation to Continental philosophy and the analytic tradition, the relevance of his thought in the discourse of post-modern paradigms of deconstruction and post-structuralism, and its creative impulse for developing process philosophies. Additionally, following Whitehead's own inclination to reach beyond European modes of thought, WRP seeks to extend its horizon of research by fostering similar conversations with strains of Indian and East Asian thought, thereby exhibiting de facto mutual influence–e.g., with the Kyoto School of Buddhist philosophy.\n\nThe WRP was conceived and founded in 2005 by Roland Faber, who serves as its executive director. In February 2005, Faber proposed and installed WRP as a project of the Center for Process Studies, a faculty research center of the Claremont School of Theology since 1973 and of which Faber is the executive director. In March 2005, the goal of creating a fully integrated online Whitehead research interface was established as a long-term, strategic aim of WRP. The official inauguration of WRP followed in December 2005 with its first international conference, \"Event and Decision\", on Badiou, Deleuze, and Whitehead. In March 2006, Faber invited Brian G. Henning to serve as the WRP's Director of Research. In July 2006, the creation of the WRP's International Board of Academic Advisors signaled the completion of the first phase of the genesis of WRP.\n\nIn July 2009, the WRP announced the creation of the Whitehead Research Interface, also known as EVE (in honor of Whitehead's beloved wife, Evelyn). Once implemented, EVE will revolutionize the study of Whitehead's works by providing open access to the most complete electronic library of Whiteheadian scholarship in the world, some parts of which have never been made available to scholars.\n\nIn 2009, WRP founded Contemporary Whitehead Studies (CWS), an interdisciplinary book series that publishes manuscripts from scholars with contemporary and innovative approaches to Whitehead studies. By publishing innovative and adventurous approaches to Whitehead’s philosophy that engage with the problems, promise, and ideas of the twenty-first century, Contemporary Whitehead Studies creates a vital and dynamic space for scholarly engagement.\n\nIn September 2010, the WRP announced the inauguration of the Critical Edition of Whitehead, a long-term initiative of the WRP that will, for the first time, make available the complete published and unpublished writings of Alfred North Whitehead in a single, critical edition. The Critical Edition of Whitehead is led by General Editor George R. Lucas, Jr. and Executive Editor Brian G. Henning.\n\n\n\n"}

They are also commonly known as non-slip mats, non-skid mats or sticky mats.\n\nAncient yoga practice in India was originally conducted on kusha grass, on hard earth without any cover, or on a rug of deer or tiger skin. Due to the scarcity and cost of such rugs, they are now rarely used even in India.\n\nWith yoga's introduction in the West, many practitioners used towels or cotton mats on wooden floors. Rubber mats were introduced as an intermediate material to prevent cotton mats from slipping on wooden floors. Slipping of hands and feet was avoided by squirting a mist of water on the mats on the respective places of positions.\n\nIn 1982, while teaching yoga in Germany, Angela Farmer used carpet underlay cut to towel size during yoga classes; later she returned home to London with the material. Angela's father, Richard Farmer, contacted the German padding manufacturer and became the first retailer of \"sticky mats\".\n\nThe first purpose-made yoga mat was manufactured and sold by Hugger Mugger Yoga Products in the 1990s. In 2002, the first ‘eco-conscious’ mat was manufactured by EcoYoga and sold through Yogamatters in Britain.\n\nYoga mats increasingly fulfill the purpose of reducing risk of injury and some insurance companies require yoga practice to be executed with a non-slip mat in order to be eligible for coverage.\n\n\"Yoga mat\"s are normally around 72\" / 182 cm long and have a width of 24\" / 60 cm. Some practitioners prefer extra-wide mats (30\" / 78 cm) for positions such as Surya Namaskar or hand-balances. \"Yoga mat\"s range in thicknesses from 2 mm (lightweight) to 4–5 mm (standard or \"classic\") and up to 7 mm for either high performance mats reserved for professional daily practices while guaranteeing little wear-out, or soft mats providing extra cushioning during yoga therapy.\n\nYoga mats are available in many colors and patterns. \"Alignment mats\" are printed with guides to proper alignment. Some companies print custom images on mats. Other items used to complement yoga mats are belts, blocks and bricks,\n\nThe first commercially produced yoga mats were made from PVC. More recently, commercial mats have become made from natural jute and rubber. Mats with rubber bases may have microfiber top layers.\n\nGeneral care instructions include advice on how to machine wash mats, or alternatively to wipe down the mat with a warm wet cloth and allow to air dry.\n\n"}
{"id": "7219768", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7219768", "title": "Yuval Steinitz", "text": "Yuval Steinitz\n\nYuval Steinitz (; born 10 April 1958) is Israel's Minister of Energy, in charge of Israel Atomic Energy Commission and a member of the Security Cabinet. He is a member of the Knesset from the Likud party. He served as Minister of Finance (2009-2013) and as Minister of Intelligence and Strategic Affairs (2013-2015). Steinitz holds a Ph.D. in Philosophy and was a senior lecturer at the University of Haifa.\n\nBorn and raised in Moshav Ramot HaShavim, 30  km north of Tel Aviv, he is the eldest of four children. His father, Dan, is an engineer and his late mother, Mina, was a teacher of literature and philosophy. Steinitz served in the IDF as a soldier in Golani infantry Brigade (1977-1980). He sustained a leg injury during a battle with the Syrian army when he served as a reservist, during the 1982 Lebanon War.\n\nAfter three years of compulsory military service, he was awarded BA and MA in Philosophy at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem with honors. His doctoral thesis \"From a Rational Point of View\" was completed at the Cohn Institute for the History and Philosophy of Science and Ideas at Tel Aviv University. The thesis examined the possibility of logical arguments for the existence of God, and the rule of logical reasoning in modern science. In 1993 Steinitz was awarded the Alon Scholarship, the most prestigious award for outstanding young doctors in Israel, which led to a teaching position at the University of Haifa. Steinitz was chosen two years in a row as \"The outstanding Lecturer\" in philosophy and the philosophy of science. In 1996 he was appointed Senior Lecturer (the Israeli parallel of a tenured assistant professor).\nSteinitz has published several philosophy books. The first, \"Invitation to Philosophy\" (1987), became a number one best-selling philosophy book in Israeli history, and was printed in 60 editions. Another book, \"A Logical-Scientific Missile to God and Back\" became a best seller as well and was printed in 17 editions. He also published philosophical papers in academic journals including \"The Philosophical Quarterly\", \"American Philosophical Quarterly\", \"International Philosophical Quarterly\", \"Cambridge Religious Studies\", and \"The Jerusalem Philosophical Quarterly Iyyun\".\n\nSteinitz's political involvement began in the early 1980s when he joined the 'Peace Now' movement as a young student. He was injured in his leg (the same leg again) during an anti-government rally in Jerusalem in 1983, when a right-wing extremist hurled a hand-grenade into the crowd, killing peace activist Emil Grunzweig.\nHis reservations about Oslo Accords signed with the Palestinians, together with his concerns regarding the massive Egyptian military buildup despite the peace treaty with Israel, led him to shift to the right in 1995 and to publicly support the Likud Party.\n\nIn 1999 he was elected to the 15th Knesset on the Likud list. A year later he became a member of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee and the chairman of its \"Subcommittee on Defense Planning and Policy\" and a member of the Constitution and Law Committee.\n\nIn 1999-2004 he served as president of Israel's Media Watch.\n\nAfter being reelected to the 16th Knesset, he became chairman of Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, chairman of the \"Subcommittee on Intelligence and Secret Service\" and co-chairman of the \"Joint Committee on Defense with the US Congress\", which he established and chaired together with Senator Jon Kyl.\nRight at the beginning of his tenure, Steinitz declared that the committee will cease to be \"The House of Lords\" and will exercise \"a very proactive and effective parliamentary oversight of Israel defense establishment\". This new approach has led him to a series of clashes with Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, with Minister of Defense Shaul Mofaz and with IDF Chief of Staff Moshe Ya'alon.\n\nA few months later he established the \"Investigation Committee for the Israeli Intelligence following the Iraq War\" and appointed himself as its chairman. This was followed later on by the establishment of similar committees in United States and Britain. The committee report in 2004 sharply criticized the Israeli Intelligence Community for misleading alerting reports, following its failure to detect the non-existence of chemical weapons and ballistic missiles in Iraq before the war. Additionally, the report also criticized the failure of the Israeli intelligence to detect the Libyan nuclear program on time. The committee's public report included a number of specific recommendations:\n\nAlongside with the above, Steinitz established a special Public Committee led by Prof. Amnon Rubinstein to examine the means to improve parliamentary oversight of the defense establishment. As committee chairman often pointed to the massive Egyptian military buildup with modern American weapons. In addition, Steinitz expressed a great Support for developing the Israeli Navy into a significant strategic arm and published several articles on this issue at the Maarachot Military Journal.\n\nUnlike Netanyahu, Steinitz did support Sharon's 2005 plan to withdrawal from Gaza. Yet, at the same time, he led a parliamentary battle against delivering the Philadelphi Corridor to Egypt, claiming that the Egyptians deliberately ignore Palestinian arms smuggling through the Sinai Peninsula. He also argued that the Israel-Egypt Philadelphi agreement might erode the demilitarization of Sinai.\n\nIn addition, he called for a rapid \"Defensive Shield\" Operation in Gaza, prior to the Israeli withdrawal, in order to destroy the Hamas and Islamic Jihad rockets industry.\n\nIn 2018, the Israeli censorship allowed the publication of the secret documents that Steinitz sent to Prime Minister Sharon and the heads of the security services and intelligence organizations - in which he indicated in the summer of 2004 the possible existence of a secret nuclear project in Syria. It turned out that Steinitz and the sub-committee he chaired were the first in Israel and in the entire Western world, who have uncovered the military nuclear project in Syria, in absolute contrast to the intelligence agencies in Israel and the world. In the summer of 2004, Steinitz asked the Mossad and the Israeli Military Intelligence Directorate to present to the sub-committee of Intelligence and Secret Services a special plan to uncovering the likely secret nuclear project in Syria. While the military intelligence ignored the warnings, the Mossad did, in fact, change its action plan according to Steinitz's report, and after three years the Mossad found proof of the existence of a nuclear plant in the process of being built in the Syrian desert, what led to the distruction of the plant by the Israeli Air Force in 2007.\n\nSteinitz was reelected to the 17th Knesset in 2006 when the Likud has lost his leading position to Kadima. As an opposition MK became again a member on the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee and as the chairman of the \"Subcommittee on Defense Readiness\". Steinitz was Netanyahu's candidate for chairman of the \"World Likud\" in June 2006, but he lost to MK Danny Danon.\n\nAfter being reelected to the 18th Knesset, and following the Likud 2009 victory, Steinitz was appointed Minister of Finance and a member of the inner Security Cabinet by Prime Minister Netanyahu.\n\nHe was the first Finance Minister of Israel to submit to the Knesset a two-year budget, instead of the until-then customary one-year budget. This move generated some controversy, with some accusing it of decreasing government transparency and others praising it for its greater efficiency. Since then, Israel continued with the biennial budget and became the first country in the west to institute such a policy change. In 2009, most experts in the Bank of Israel and the Ministry of Finance opposed Steinitz's move, but today the biennial budget had a wide approval among the officials in the Bank of Israel and the Ministry of Finance.\n\nIn the 19th Knesset Steinitz served as Minister for Intelligence, Strategic Affairs and International Relations in the new government.\n\nSteinitz was reelected to 20th Knesset and became Minister of National Infrastructure, Energy and Water Resources in the Thirty-fourth government of Israel.\n\nAmong the laws initiated by Steinitz during his tenure as MK:\n\nWith the establishment of the 32nd by Prime Minister Netanyahu, Steinitz was appointed Minister of Finance. He took up this position in March 2009, during the beginning of the global economic crisis, and after the Israeli economy already suffered from two quarters of negative economic growth which led to almost 10% unemployment.\n\nAfter few weeks at office, Steinitz has launched an emergency plan entitled \"Blima & Tnufa\" (Break and Accelerate) aimed at returning the country to positive economic growth, through dramatically encouraging investments in the high-tech industry, in R&D, and in construction and transportation. As part of the program, a \"triple package deal\" between the government, the Histadrut Unions Association and the Israel Manufacturers Association was signed. The employees agreed to contribute 3.5 Billion NIS to help accelerating growth. In April 2009, Steinitz announced his unprecedented plan to enact the first biennial budget in Israel's history, as part of his counter-crisis policy. In July 2009, the government approved the biennial budget (since then all budgets in Israel were biennial).\n\nAt the beginning of his term, Steinitz raised the VAT from 15.5% to 16.5% effectively from July 2009, but it was reduced to 16% in January 2010. In 2010 the Israeli economy has already shown the fastest growing figures in the western world, with 5% growth and sharp reduction of unemployment.\n\nIn April 2009 Steinitz appointed Prof. Omer Moav as head of his advisory committee. When Moav resigned a year later, Steinitz appointed Prof. Avi Simchon to the post. In November 2009 Steinitz appointed Haim Shani as director general, but he resigned a year and a half later following the 2011 social protests.\nIn 2009 Steinitz started an intensive diplomatic campaign to promote Israel's acceptance to the OECD. In May 2010, after more than thirty years of failing attempts and despite strong opposition from the Arab World, Israel has finally become a full member of the OECD.\n\nIn 2010 Steinitz established the Sheshinski Committee to examine ways to increase the level of taxation on Natural Gas and Oil fields. Steinitz announced that he intended to raise the level of the over-whole \"government-take\" on gas and oil from 20% to around 50%-60%. This led to a very aggressive campaign against him by the energy lobby, including pressures from the US White House on behalf of the American Noble Energy. In 2011 Steinitz legislate the committee recommendations in the Knesset, raising the \"government-take\" on big gas fields to more than 60%. In addition, Steinitz has doubled the royalties paid by \"Israel Chemicals\" from using the Dead Sea natural resources and cancel its historic tax exemptions.\n\nTwo other important committees were the \"Concentration Committee\" (established at winter 2011 together with PM Netanyahu), which led to unprecedented steps to reduce economic concentration in Israel, like enforcing separation between significant Financial and Real holdings; And the \"Investment Taxation Committee\" (established in 2010 together with Minister Ben-Eliezer), which led to significant increase in Israel's investments incentives.\n\nIn 2011, a doctors' strike broke out and paralyzed all Hospitals and Clinics around the country, in what became the longest strike in Israel history. The strike ended after five months with a compromise between the Ministry of Finance and the Doctors union, which included the improvement of the doctors employment conditions, especially in peripheral hospitals, as well as Steinitz's demand that hospital doctors will be subjected to time clocks. Nevertheless, hundreds of interns and 200 senior doctors continued the strike and the protest against the deal, until eventually the protest petered out.\n\nIn the summer of 2011, and alongside with the doctors strike, a series of social protests against the cost of living in Israel took place. Demonstrations took place for a prolonged period of time, focusing on the high housing prices and the cost of daycare. The protesters were accompanied by doctors, teachers, students, and dairy farmers, who called for a change in the government social outlook. At the beginning Steinitz rejected the protesters' claims. But with the continuation of the protests, Steinitz began to show a more flexible attitude. One step was lowering taxes in order to reduce petrol price hike. Following the appointment of the \"Trajtenberg Committee\", Steinitz dealt with implementation of the committee's recommendations.\n\nIn September 2011, S&P raised Israel credit rating to A+. This decision took place in light of the fact that Israel managed to continue to reduce its debt-to-GDP ratio, and despite the global economic crisis.\n\nDuring his tenure, Steinitz made extensive efforts to develop business connections with China and India. In 2010-2011, Israeli exports to these countries increased by 35%. During his three official visits in China and India, Steinitz led negotiations for the signing a series of bilateral agreements designed to increase the volume of trade with these countries. Among other things, the agreement include specipic steps to encourage young doctors from China and India to make their Postdoctoral Researches in Israel.\n\nIn July 2012, Steinitz led the signing of an economic agreement between Israel and the Palestinian Authority with Prime Minister Salam Fayyad. As part of the deal, it was decided to increase joint enforcement against smuggling of goods, and Israeli assistance to the Palestinian tax collection capabilities.\n\nIn 2012 the state annual deficit reached 39 Billion NIS, almost twice as much as was predicted, but the Debt-to-GDP ratio continued to decline. The average economic growth during Steinitz's tenure as Finance Minister (2010-2012) was 4.5%, the highest economic growth in the entire developed world.\n\nAfter the 2013 elections Steinitz was appointed Minister for Intelligence, Strategic Affairs and International Relations, and became responsible to several topics:\n\n\nIn May 2015, Steinitz was appointed Minister of National Infrastructure, Energy and Water Resources, as well as Minister in charge of the Israel Atomic Energy Commission.\nTwo months later, after several years of delays and against very strong opposition from the Israeli left circles, Steinitz formulated the \"Gas Framework\", in order to enable the development of Israel's biggest gas discovery \"Leviathan\" (discovered in 2010), and to pave the way to future gas and oil explorations. The \"Gas Framework\" was approved by the Israeli government in August 2015, and by the Knesset Plenum in September 2015. Yet in March 2016 Israel's Supreme court nullified the framework stability section, and forced Minister Steinitz to amend it and bring it back to government approval. The revised framework was approved in May 2016, and the development of \"Leviathan\" ultimately started.\nIn April 2016 the US Energy Secretary Dr. Ernest Moniz visited Israel for the first time. Together with Steinitz, they signed a bilateral agreement which upgrades the energy cooperation between the United States and Israel.\n\nIn July 2016 Steinitz announced that the Ministry of Energy will publish new oil and gas licenses, after four years in which the country economic waters were practically closed for new explorations and searches.\n\nDuring 2017, the natural gas monopoly consisting of the Israeli company \"Delek\" and the American company \"Noble Energy\" had begun to fall apart, when the selling of the Karish-Tanin to the Greek company \"Energean\" occurred. This ultimately led to more competition for customers and the cheaper prices.\n\nIn April 2017 Steinitz hosted the ministers of energy from Italy, Greece, and Cyprus, as well as the European Commissioner for Energy, to kick off his plan to construct a sub-sea pipeline - the longest and deepest in the world - allowing Israel and Cyprus to export gas to Greece and Italy, and through them to west Europe.\n\nIn his capacity, Steinitz initiated a plan to eliminating the use of coal and polluting fuels in the State of Israel, and replacing them with natural gas and renewable energies. Within 3 years the percentage of coal and mazut dropped from 65% of electricity production in 2015 to 25% in 2018. According to the plan, in 2027 Israel will no longer continue to use coal. Steinitz has also promoted a plan to shift all transportation in Israel from traditional fuels to electricity and natural gas, by the year 2030.\n\nIn June 2018, Steinitz signed an implementation agreement with his American counterpart, Rick Perry, establishing a joint energy research and development center. This cooperation agreement aims to accelerate development and rapid deployment of critical and innovative technologies for natural gas, cybersecurity, energy-water nexus, water storage, and other areas of energy that are needed to diversify energy supply and promote higher efficiency.\n\nHe has campaigned for heightened awareness of the Iranian nuclear threat, lobbying at home and abroad to ensure that Iran does not become a nuclear power.\n\nIn 2008, when Israel refused permission for Palestinian Fulbright students to leave Gaza and study in the United States, Steinitz supported this action. He told the New York Times: \"We are fighting the regime in Gaza that does its utmost to kill our citizens and destroy our schools and our colleges. So I don’t think we should allow students from Gaza to go anywhere. Gaza is under siege, and rightly so, and it is up to the Gazans to change the regime or its behavior.\" He disagreed with former Governor of the Bank of Israel, Stanley Fischer, on various issues, and has a complicated relationship with Netanyahu, who bypassed him several times in his first year in office.\n\nIn June 2013, when Austria planned to withdraw its UN-Troops (stationary since 1974) from the Golan Heights, Yuval Steinitz issued a statement expressing regret at the Austrian move, adding that the lesson for Israel was clear: \"Even as part of peace agreements, Israel cannot place its security in the hands of international forces instead of relying on the presence of IDF soldiers.\"\n\nIn December 2015, after the assassination of Samir Kuntar, he claimed in the newspaper Haretz that the Finnish Intelligence services was perhaps behind this affair. After contact from the Helsingin Sanomat newspaper, Hareetz claimed that it was a joke, putting to serious threat Israel's foreign policy.\n\nOn 19 November 2017, Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz said that Israel has had covert contacts with Saudi Arabia amid common concerns over Iran. This is the first public admission of cooperation between the two countries by a senior Israeli official.\n\nOn 7 May 2018, Steinitz, in an interview to Israeli news site Ynet, said that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, should be 'eliminated' by Israel for his relationship with Iran, he later clarified it was his personal opinion and not that of the government.\n\nSteinitz is married to Gila Kanfy-Steinitz, a judge and the vice president of the Jerusalem District Court. They have three children.\n\n\n\n"}
