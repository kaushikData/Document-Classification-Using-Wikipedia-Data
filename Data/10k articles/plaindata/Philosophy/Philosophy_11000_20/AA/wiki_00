The hunting season lasts from mid-November to mid-May, but the hunt mainly occurs in March and April. Canada's seal hunt is the world's largest hunt for marine mammals.\n\nSome animal rights groups were given observer permits and monitored the hunt. They said it was cruel and that it ravaged the seal population. Sealers said it was sustainable, humane, and well-managed.\n\nThe pelts and oil were sold to buyers in Norway, Russia, and China.\n\nThe total allowable catch for 2008 was set by the Canadian government at 275,000 harp seals (the quota includes 2,000 seals for personal seal hunting, and 4,950 seals for the Aboriginal seal hunt), 8,200 hooded seals, and 12,000 grey seals.\n\nA new rule in the Marine Mammal Regulations for 2008 required hunters to slit the seal's main arteries under its flippers, after clubbing or shooting a seal. The European Union recommended adding this rule in a report released in December 2007. This was to prevent the seal from having to withstand the pain of being skinned alive.\n\nThe hunt in the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence started on Friday March 28, 2008. A handful of sealing vessels set out before dawn from the Magdalen Islands. In the first hour of the hunt, only 15 seals were killed. The ice had made it hard for the 16 vessels, carrying roughly 100 hunters, to get near the seals. Most of the hunters in these first days of the hunt were from the Magdalen Islands. The average seal hunt brings in about $1 million annually to the Magdalen Islands. As of March 30, about 1000 had been killed. On March 30, the hunt in the Gulf of St. Lawrence opened for the people from New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia. As of April 18, sealers in the Gulf of St. Lawrence had taken about half of their total allowable catch (TAC) of 51,500 seals.\n\nThe biggest part of the 2008 Canadian seal hunt took place off of Newfoundland and Labrador, known as the Front. The hunt in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and the Front officially began on April 11 and 12 respectively. Official opening times and license conditions were released on April 7. According to Fisheries Department spokesman Larry Yetman, up to 120 larger boats were heading to the Front on April 12.\n\nAs of April 18, sealers on the Front had taken 56% of a total 194,000 seals allowed to be taken in the area. By April 18, longliners on the Front had taken of their TAC of 112,000 seals. Small boats on the Front had taken 27% of their TAC of 71,000 seals.\n\nThe seal hunt for longliners on the Front closed on April 19, 2008. At the time, these were the only groups of hunters close to catching their quota.\n\nOn March 29, 2008, a 12-metre fishing vessel with six men, \"L'Acadien II\", capsized near Cape Breton. Navy divers searched the waters for four men, who had been sleeping in the lower decks of the vessel. Two men, who were at the upper decks, were rescued on to another fishing boat. The vessel had capsized when it was being towed by the Canadian Coast Guard's \"Sir William Alexander\". The \"L'Acadien II\" took part in the seal hunt, and had to be towed because of a steering problem. When the vessel had capsized, a Cormorant helicopter and a Hercules aircraft came to aid the rescue. The vessel had since been secured to the side of the Coast Guard's vessel. The navy divers recovered the bodies of three of the missing men on March 29, with one man still missing. The men who died were from the Magdalen Islands. They have been identified as Bruno Bourque, the boat's owner and captain, Gilles Leblanc (in his 50s), and Marc-Andre Deraspe (in his early 20s). Still missing but presumed dead was Carl Aucoin.\n\nOn the evening of March 28, it was reported that two sealing vessels were taking in water, and one vessel had mechanical problems, in heavy ice conditions off Cape Breton. Two icebreakers were sent out to help the vessels out of the ice. On March 29, the coast guard and Department of Defence rescued seven people before their vessel, the \"Annie Marie\", was crushed in the ice pack northeast off Cape Breton.\n\nOn April 14, the vessel \"Lucy May\" burnt to the waterline on Newfoundlands's northeast coast, after the crew had been rescued by a Cormorant helicopter. Also on April 14, the vessel \"BS Venture\" had mechanical trouble on Newfoundland's west coast, and six men escaped from the vessel before it ran ashore. The men reached land safely in Rocky Harbour in a self-brought speedboat.\n\nThe vessel \"White Bay Challenger\" started to take in water on April 17 because it had been struck by ice while it was being escorted by the Canadian Coast Guard Ship \"\". The \"White Bay Challenger\" sank after the seven people on board had been taken aboard the \"Ann Harvey\".\n\nJournalists have a constitutional right to observe the hunt that was affirmed under a 1989 Federal Court of Appeal ruling. The federal government have a right to issue observer permits, to prevent the ice from being overcrowded with observers. A Seal Fishery Observation Licence in 2008 cost $25, and regulations on who is eligible for a license were found in the Marine Mammal Regulations.\n\nAfter noon on March 28, federal fisheries officials issued observer permits for the hunt's opening day to activists and journalists. A couple of hours before the permits were issued, Phil Jenkins of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans said: \"We're going to delay the giving out of permits until we can understand what exact level of sealing is going on.\" When the permits were issued, the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) managed to fly out to film some scenes. The journalists (such as the United Kingdom's Sky TV) and the representatives of the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) were unable to make it to the ice floes because the weather had turned bad during the day, making it very hard to fly a helicopter. DFO spokesman Phil Jenkins said that 60 observer permits had been issued.\n\nThe permits for March 29 were issued on the evening of March 28.\n\nAccording to the Marine Mammal Regulations, Canada does not allow the hunting of whitecoats. Whitecoats are suckling pups of the harp or grey seal under two weeks of age.\n\nMost of the seals that were hunted are young harp seals, called beaters. They were whelped (born) in February or early March in whelping patches on the ice. Such patches vary from 20 to 200 square kilometres, and may contain as many as 2,000 adult females per square kilometre. The pups are abandoned by their mothers at two weeks of age, and remain in the whelping patches until the ice starts to melt in March or early April. The hunt takes place in and around these whelping patches.\n\nCarino, a Norwegian-owned company, is a major buyer of Canadian seals. The Carino plant is located in South Dildo in Newfoundland and Labrador. Carino's Norwegian parent company, Rieber Skinn, announced in April 2008 that its factory in Bergen, Norway, with 17 employees, was closing down within a year. As a result, sealskin from seals captured in Norway was to be processed in their plant in Canada. An agreement with Canada says that Rieber is bound to process sealskin in Canada.\n\nOn March 24, the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society's vessel, the R/V \"Farley Mowat\", left Bermuda to head for the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The seventeen persons on the vessel were from the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, France, Sweden, South Africa, Canada and the United States.\n\nOn March 21, Lawrence Cannon of the Canadian government had sent a fax to the \"Farley Mowat\", ordering it not to enter Canadian waters and warning it of prosecution if the order was not complied with. Paul Watson replied to the minister that the conventions of the International Maritime Organization apply to commercial ships, but the \"Farley Mowat\" is a Dutch-registered yacht. He said the \"Farley Mowat\" would enter the Canadian Economic Exclusion Zone, but not the territorial limit.\n\nOn March 30, according to the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, the \"Farley Mowat\" was rammed twice by the icebreaker \"Des Groseilliers\" of the Canadian Coast Guard. The collision occurred after the \"Farley Mowat\" failed to comply with a request from \"Des Groseilliers\" not to approach the seal hunt area. Plates on the \"Farley Mowat\" were buckled by the contact, but there was no other damage. Phil Jenkins of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans called the allegation \"absolutely false.\" Loyola Hearn, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, issued a statement on March 31, saying the allegations were \"completely untrue\", and that the \"Farley Mowat\" manoeuvred itself in front of the \"Des Groseilliers\" to cause a collision as an attempt to provoke a confrontation and attract media attention. Paul Watson replied on the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society's website, on April 1, that \"Des Groseilliers\" was faster and more manoeuvrable in the ice than the \"Farley Mowat\", and that the \"Farley Mowat\" was stopped when it was hit for the second time. He said the entire incident was captured on video by a man on board the \"Farley Mowat\", and the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) helicopter was going to pick up the video on March 31, but had been grounded by the government.\n\nSealer Shane Briand said the \"Farley Mowat\" came close to the hunters about sixty km off Cape Breton and broke up the ice under a hunter on March 30. He said his ship and crew was harassed until the \"Des Groseilliers\" arrived.\n\nA release from the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society on April 2 said: \"The Sea Shepherd Conservation Society recognizes that the deaths of four sealers is a tragedy but Sea Shepherd also recognizes that the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of seal pups is an even greater tragedy.\" Paul Watson was quoted in the same release as saying: \"One of the sealers was quoted as saying that he felt absolutely helpless as he watched the boat sink with sealers on board. I can't think of anything that defines helplessness and fear more than a seal pup on the ice that can't swim or escape as it is approached by some cigarette smoking ape with a club. This is a seal nursery and these men are sadistic baby killers and that might offend some people but it is the unvarnished truth — they are vicious killers who are now pleading for sympathy because some of their own died while engaged in a viciously brutal activity.\"\n\nBecause of these statements, the leader of the Green Party of Canada, Elizabeth May, decided on April 3 to resign from the advisory board of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society.\n\nOn April 4, angry fishermen used axes to cut the mooring lines of the \"Farley Mowat\" in Saint-Pierre, where it was tied up. According to a fisherman, the ropes were cut because the fishermen of Saint-Pierre did not accept what Paul Watson had said. There had first been a confrontation between the activists and the fishermen.\n\nOn April 5, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans Loyola Hearn announced that charges were being laid against the \"Farley Mowat\"s Dutch captain, Alexander Cornelissen, and Swedish First Officer Peter Hammarstedt. They were charged with contraventions of the Marine Mammal Regulations (MMR) on getting too close to the hunt without an observer permit. Captain Alexander Cornelissen was also charged under the Fisheries Act for obstructing or hindering a Fishery Officer, a fishery guardian, or an inspector.\n\nOn April 12, armed Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers boarded and seized the \"Farley Mowat\". They had first asked permission to board the vessel, but were refused. The \"Farley Mowat\"s captain and first officer were arrested. According to the Fisheries Department, the \"Farley Mowat\" was to be kept in DFO custody until a court ordered the release of the vessel. According to Paul Watson of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, the boarding happened in international waters, and the \"Farley Mowat\" had never strayed into Canada's territorial limit. He said this was proven in the ship's logs and GPS records, which the Canadian authorities had seized. According to the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, the vessel was seized in Canadian national waters.\n\nThe captain and first officer were each granted a $5,000 bail in a Sydney, Nova Scotia courtroom on April 13. The 17 crew members went on a hunger strike until the two men were to be released. The Sea Shepherd Conservation Society bailed the men out with $10,000 donated by author Farley Mowat.\n\nThe next court appearance was scheduled for May 1, 2008. A new hearing was then scheduled for May 9 and a preliminary hearing for July 2.\n\nThe European Union considered a ban on all seal products in the wake of the 2008 hunt. A Canadian delegation headed to Europe in March 2008 to lobby for the hunt. The delegation includes Canadian Fisheries Conservation representative Loyola Sullivan, Nunavut Premier Paul Okalik, Newfoundland Natural Resources Minister Kathy Dunderdale, Fur Institute of Canada executive director Rob Cahill, and sealers Mark Small and Denis Longuepee. The delegation travelled to London, Brussels, Berlin, Vienna, and Paris.\n\n\n"}

However, he fell out of favor in 1983 and lost his power. He made a strong political comeback during the democratic transition and was elected chairman of the Bulgarian Communist Party. He led the party to transform and adapt to the post-communist era. A party referendum supported his proposal to change the name to the Bulgarian Socialist Party. After winning the first democratic elections he did not become prime minister himself, instead he eventually supported a multi-party government led by Dimitar Popov. After losing the 1991 parliamentary elections he stepped down as party leader. In 2001 he retired as MP after having served for 39 years.\n\nAleksandar Lilov was born on 31 August 1933 in the village of Granichak, northwestern Vidin Province. He graduated Bulgarian Studies (philosophy) at Sofia University in 1962 and graduated doctoral studies in communist Social Science at the Academy of Public Sciences in Moscow. In 1975 he became an associate at the institution of art at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences. Six years later, he defended a doctoral thesis in 1981. He died on 20 July 2013 at the age of 79.\n\nLilov joined the Dimitrov Young Communist League in Vidin and rose to the ranks of its central committee in 1963. Six years later he joined the central Party organ and in 1971 he became a prominent member of the Communist Party. Lilov was a member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party from July 1974 to September 1983 and was also a secretary of the Central Committee of the Party from July 1972 to September 28, 1983. He was also a member of the State Council of Bulgaria from 1976 to 1983. By the end of the 70s he was viewed as the second most powerful member of the party. After the death of Lyudmila Zhivkova (General Secretary Todor Zhivkov's daughter) in 1981, Lilov's power began to wane. In 1983 he was removed from the Politburo after criticizing the General Secretary for his economic mismanagement and apparent lack of interest in current issues.\n\nAfter fading from the public view for six year, Lilov returned from Great-Britain - where he was when Zhivkov was forced to resign on November 10, 1989 - and was welcomed back among the leaders of the BCP. There he denounced the Revival Process (started by Zhivkov and internationally condemned) and allowed Bulgarian Muslims to reinstate their former names.\n\nDuring the 14th emergency congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party (held in January - February 1990), the post of general secretary was abolished, and Lilov was elected to the new post of chairman. Under his leadership the party was dissolved and reorganized into the Bulgarian Socialist Party on April 3 following an party referendum. This transition brought about revolutionary change to the party's ideology, from Communism to Socialism (from far-left to left-wing). Change was also brought to the way the party was run in order to dismantle the totalitarian apparatus in the country. In September he was reelected as party chairman by a margin of 2 to 1 against the hopes of the liberals in the party who sought to remove the remains of the former Communist regime. He remained the party's leader until the end of 1991.\n\nHe led the Socialists through the first democratic elections in 1990, elected to adopt a new constitution, where his party won a majority of the seats (211 out of 400) and 47.15% of the votes. He did not become Prime Minister himself, instead continuing his support for the socialist government in place led by Andrey Lukanov. This came to an end when mass demonstrations and a general strike led to the formation of a government under the non-partisan judge Dimitar Popov in which the BSP participated alongside the UDF, BANU and independent experts.\n\nHis second election campaign in 1991 ended with defeat after his electoral alliance won only 33.1% of the votes and 106 seats (out of 240); finishing behind the Union of Democratic Forces who won 34.4% of the votes and 110 seats. Later that year he stepped down and as chairman of the party and was succeeded by Zhan Videnov. Lilov remained a Member of Parliament until 2001, a seat he held for 39 years (1962–2001). In 2001 he was the longest serving member of parliament.\n"}

{"id": "38532183", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38532183", "title": "Anutpada", "text": "Anutpada\n\nAnutpada is a Buddhist concept for the absence of an origin. \n\n\"Anutpāda\" means \"having no origin\", \"not coming into existence\", \"not taking effect\", \"non-production\".\n\nThe Buddhist tradition uses the term \"anutpāda\" for the absence of an origin or sunyata (voidness). \"Anutpāda\" means that \"dharmas\", the constituting elements of reality, do not come into existence. Atiśa:\nChandrakirti, in his \"Yuktisastikavrrti\", states:\nAccording to Nakamura in his study of Advaita Vedanta, the Buddhist \"paramārtha\", \"highest truth\", is identified with \"anutpāda\" The term \"paramārtha\" is a synonym for tattva, tathata, sunyata, animitta, bhutakoti and dharmadhatu. One who understands sunyata, anutpada and dependent arising, has realized the ultimate truth and gains nirvana. Nagarjuna:\n\"Anutpāda\" is one of the important features of the Prajñāpāramitā Sutras and Madhyamaka. The term is also being used in the Lankavatara Sutra. According to D.T Suzuki, \"anutpada\" is not the opposite of \"utpada\", but transcends opposites. It is the seeing into the true nature of existence, the seeing that \"all objects are without self-substance\". Another well-known use is in Bankei's \"Unborn\".\n\nGaudapada-karika characterizes Brahman-Atman Absolute with the concept of \"Ajātivāda\". It is a fundamental philosophical doctrine of Gaudapada. In \"Gaudapada-Karika\", chapter III, verses 46-48, Gaudapada states that Brahman never arises, is never born, is never unborn, it rests in itself:\nAccording to Gaudapada, the Absolute has no origin, and is not subject to birth, change and death. The Absolute is \"aja\", the unborn eternal. The empirical world of appearances is considered Maya (unreal, changing, transitory), and not ontologically independent reality.\n\nGaudapada's concept of \"ajāta\" is similar to Nagajurna's Madhyamaka philosophy. The Buddhist tradition usually uses the term \"anutpāda\" for the absence of an origin or śūnyatā.\n\nBut Gaudapada's perspective is quite different from Nagarjuna. Gaudapada's perspective is based on the \"Mandukya Upanishad\". According to Gaudapada, Brahman cannot undergo alteration, so the phenomenal world cannot arise independently from Brahman. If the world cannot arise, yet is an empirical fact, than the world has to be an unreal (transitory) appearance of Brahman. And if the phenomenal world is a transitory appearance, then there is no real origination or destruction, only apparent origination or destruction. From the level of ultimate truth (\"paramārthatā\") the phenomenal world is \"māyā\", changing and not what it seems to be.\n\nThe Ajativada of Gaudapada, states Karmarkar, has nothing in common with the Sunyavada concept in Buddhism. While the language of Gaudapada is undeniably similar to those found in Mahayana Buddhism, Coman states that their perspective is different because unlike Buddhism, Gaudapada is relying on the premise of \"Brahman, Atman or Turiya\" exist and are the nature of absolute reality.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "294902", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=294902", "title": "Brook Farm", "text": "Brook Farm\n\nBrook Farm, also called the Brook Farm Institute of Agriculture and Education or the Brook Farm Association for Industry and Education, was a utopian experiment in communal living in the United States in the 1840s. It was founded by former Unitarian minister George Ripley and his wife Sophia Ripley at the Ellis Farm in West Roxbury, Massachusetts (9 miles outside of downtown Boston) in 1841 and was inspired in part by the ideals of Transcendentalism, a religious and cultural philosophy based in New England. Founded as a joint stock company, it promised its participants a portion of the profits from the farm in exchange for performing an equal share of the work. Brook Farmers believed that by sharing the workload, ample time would be available for leisure activities and intellectual pursuits.\n\nLife on Brook Farm was based on balancing labor and leisure while working together for the benefit of the greater community. Each member could choose to do whatever work they found most appealing and all were paid equally, including women. Revenue for the community came from farming and from selling handmade products like clothing as well as through fees paid by the many visitors to Brook Farm. The main source of income was the school, which was overseen by Mrs. Ripley. A pre-school, primary school, and a college preparatory school attracted children internationally and each child was charged for his or her education. Adult education was also offered.\n\nThe community was never financially stable and had difficulty profiting from its agricultural pursuits. By 1844, the Brook Farmers adopted a societal model based on the socialist concepts of Charles Fourier and began publishing \"The Harbinger\" as an unofficial journal promoting Fourierism. Following his vision, the community members began building an ambitious structure called the Phalanstery. When the uninsured building was destroyed in a fire, the community was financially devastated and never recovered. It was fully closed by 1847. Despite the experimental commune's failure, many Brook Farmers looked back on their experience positively. Critics of the commune included Charles Lane, founder of another utopian community called Fruitlands. Nathaniel Hawthorne was a founding member of Brook Farm, though he was not a strong adherent of the community's ideals. He later fictionalized his experience in his novel \"The Blithedale Romance\" (1852).\n\nAfter the community's failure, the property was operated for most of the next 130 years by a Lutheran organization as first an orphanage, and then a treatment center and school. The buildings of the Transcendentalists were destroyed by fire over the years. In 1988 the State of Massachusetts acquired of the farm, which is now operated by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation as a historic site. Brook Farm was one of the first sites in Massachusetts to be listed on the National Register of Historic Places and be designated a National Historic Site. In 1977, the Boston Landmarks Commission designated Brook Farm a Landmark, the city's highest recognition for historic sites.\n\nIn October 1840, George Ripley announced to the Transcendental Club that he was planning to form a Utopian community. Brook Farm, as it would be called, was based on the ideals of Transcendentalism; its founders believed that by pooling labor they could sustain the community and still have time for literary and scientific pursuits. The experiment was meant to serve as an example for the rest of the world, based on the principles of \"industry without drudgery, and true equality without its vulgarity\". At Brook Farm, as in other communities, physical labor was perceived as a condition of mental well-being and health. Brook Farm was one of at least 80 communal experiments active in the United States throughout the 1840s, though it was the first to be secular. Ripley believed his experiment would be a model for the rest of society. He predicted: \"If wisely executed, it will be a light over this country and this age. If not the sunrise, it will be the morning star.\" As more interested people began to take part in planning, Ripley relocated meetings from his home to the West Street bookshop operated by Elizabeth Palmer Peabody.\n\nRipley and his wife Sophia formed a joint stock company in 1841 along with 10 other initial investors. He sold shares of the company $500 apiece with a promise of five percent of the profits to each investor. Shareholders were also allowed a single vote in decision-making and several held director positions. The Ripleys chose to begin their experiment at a dairy farm owned by Charles and Maria Mayo Ellis in West Roxbury, Massachusetts, near the home of Theodore Parker. They began raising money, including holding a meeting at Peabody's bookshop to raise $10,000 for the farm's initial purchase. The site was eventually purchased on October 11, 1841, for $10,500. though participants had begun moving in as early as April. The farm about eight miles (13 km) from Boston was described in a pamphlet as a \"place of great natural beauty, combining a convenient nearness to the city with a degree of retirement and freedom from unfavorable influences unusual even in the country\". The purchase also covered a neighboring Keith farm, approximately , \"consisting altogether of a farm with dwelling house, barn, and outbuildings thereon situated\".\n\nThe first major public notice of the community was published in August 1841. \"The Community at West Roxbury, Mass.\" was likely written by Elizabeth Palmer Peabody. Though they began with 10 investors, eventually some 32 people would become Brook Farmers. Writer and editor Margaret Fuller was invited to Brook Farm and, though she never officially joined the community, she was a frequent visitor, often spending New Year's Eve there. Ripley received many applications to join the community, especially from people who had little money or those in poor health, but full-fledged membership was granted only to individuals who could afford the $500 share of the joint stock company.\n\nOne of the initial founders of Brook Farm was author Nathaniel Hawthorne. Hawthorne did not particularly agree with the ideals of the experiment, hoping only that it would help him raise enough money to begin his life with his wife-to-be Sophia Peabody. She considered moving there as well and even visited in May 1841, though Hawthorne sent her away. Ripley was aware of Hawthorne's motivations, and tried to convince him to get involved more fully by appointing him as one of four trustees, specifically overseeing \"Direction of Finance\". After requesting his initial investment be returned, Hawthorne officially resigned from Brook Farm on October 17, 1842. He wrote of his displeasure with the community: \"even my Custom House experience was not such a thraldom and weariness; my mind and heart were freer ...Thank God, my soul is not utterly buried under a dung-heap.\"\n\nIn the late 1830s Ripley became increasingly engaged in \"Associationism\", an early socialist movement based on the work of Charles Fourier. Horace Greeley, a New York newspaper editor, and others began to pressure the Brook Farm experiment to follow more closely the pattern of Charles Fourier at a time when the community was struggling to be self-sufficient. Albert Brisbane, whose book \"The Social Destiny of Man\" (1840) had been an inspiration to Ripley, paid Greeley $500 for permission to publish a front-page column in the \"New York Tribune\" which ran in several parts from March 1842 to September 1843. Brisbane argued in the series, titled \"Association: or, Principles of a True Organization of Society\", how Fourier's theories could be applied in the United States. Brisbane published similar articles in 1842 in \"The Dial\", the journal of the Transcendentalists. Fourier's societal vision included elaborate plans for specific structures and highly organized roles of its members. He called this system for an ideal community a \"Phalanx\".\n\nTo meet this vision, now under the name \"Brook Farm Association for Industry and Education\", Brook Farmers committed themselves to constructing an ambitious communal building known as the Phalanstery. Construction began in the summer of 1844 and the structure would provide accommodations for 14 families and single people as well. It was planned to be by and include, as Ripley described, \"a large and commodious kitchen, a dining-hall capable of seating from three to four hundred persons, two public saloons, and a spacious hall or lecture room\".\n\nRipley and two associates created a new constitution for Brook Farm in 1844, beginning the experiment's attempts to follow closely Fourier's Phalanx system. Many Brook Farmers supported the transition; at a dinner in honor of Fourier's birthday, one member of the group proposed a toast to \"Fourier, the second coming of Christ\". Others, however, did not share in the enthusiasm and some left the commune altogether. One of those who left was Isaac Hecker, who converted to Catholicism and went on to become the founder of the first American-based order of priests, the Paulist Fathers, in 1858. In particular, many Brook Farmers thought the new model was too rigid and structured and too different from the carefree aspects that they had been attracted to. Both supporters and detractors referred to the early part of Brook Farm's history as the \"Transcendental days\". Ripley himself became a celebrity proponent of Fourierism and organized conventions throughout New England to discuss the community.\nIn the last few months of 1844, Brook Farmers were offered the possibility of taking over two Associationism-inspired publications, Brisbane's \"The Phalanx\" and John Allen's \"The Social Reformer\". Four printers were part of Brook Farm at the time and members of the community believed it would elevate their status as leaders of the movement as well as provide additional income. Ultimately, the Brook Farmers published a new journal combining the two, \"The Harbinger\". The journal's first issue was published June 14, 1845, and was continuously printed, originally weekly, until October 1847, when it was relocated to New York City, still under the oversight of George Ripley and fellow Brook Farmer Charles Anderson Dana. Naming the publication, however, turned out to be a difficult task. Parke Godwin offered advice when it was suggested to keep the name \"The Phalanx\":\n\nBrook Farm began to decline rapidly after its restructuring. In October 1844, Orestes Brownson visited the site and sensed that \"the atmosphere of the place is horrible\". To save money, \"retrenchments\", or sacrifices, were called for, particularly at the dinner table. Meat, coffee, tea, and butter were no longer offered, though it was agreed that a separate table with meat be allowed in December 1844. That Thanksgiving, a neighbor had donated a turkey. Many Brook Farmers applied for exceptions to these rules and soon it was agreed that \"members of the Association who sit at the meat table shall be charged extra for their board\". Life on Brook Farm was further worsened by an outbreak of smallpox in November 1845; though no one died, 26 Brook Farmers were infected. Ripley attempted to quell the financial difficulties by negotiating with creditors and stockholders, who agreed to cancel $7,000 of debts.\n\nConstruction on the Phalanstery was progressing well until the evening of March 3, 1846, when it was discovered that the Phalanstery had caught fire. Within two hours, the structure had completely burned down; firefighters from Boston arrived too late. The fire was likely caused by a defective chimney. One participant noted, \"Ere long the flames were chasing one another in a mad riot over the structure; running across long corridors and up and down the supporting columns of wood, until the huge edifice was a mass of firework\". The financial blow from the loss of the uninsured building was $7,000 and it marked the beginning of the end of Brook Farm.\n\nGeorge Ripley, who had begun the experiment, made an unofficial break with Brook Farm in May 1846. Many others began to leave as well, though the dissolution of the farm was slow. As one Brook Farmer said, the slow decline of the community was like apple petals drifting slowly to the ground, making it seem \"dreamy and unreal\". On November 5, 1846, Ripley's book collection, which had served as Brook Farm's library, was auctioned to help cover the association's debts. By the end, Brook Farm had a total debt of $17,445. Ripley told a friend, \"I can now understand how a man would feel if he could attend his own funeral\". He took a job with the \"New York Tribune\" and it took him 13 years to pay off the Brook Farm debt, which he did in 1862.\n\nA man named John Plummer purchased the land that was Brook Farm in 1849 before selling it six years later to James Freeman Clarke, who intended to establish another community there. Instead, Clarke offered it to President Abraham Lincoln during the American Civil War and the Second Massachusetts Regiment used it for training as Camp Andrew.\n\nClarke sold the property in 1868 to two brothers, who used it as a summer boarding house. In 1870 Gottlieb F. Burckhardt purchased the property, after which he formed the Association of the Evangelical Lutheran Church for Works of Mercy to operate an orphanage in The Hive, as the main house on the property was known. The orphanage opened in 1872 and operated until 1943. In 1948 the Lutherans converted it into a treatment center and school, which closed in 1977. Parts of the farm were separated in 1873 for use as a cemetery, a use that continues today as a non-denominational cemetery known as the Gardens of Gethsemene (as part of St. Joseph's Cemetery and the Baker Street Jewish Cemeteries). During the period of Lutheran ownership the only now extant building, a c. 1890 print shop, was built on the land; the buildings associated with the Transcendentalists, most recently the Margaret Fuller Cottage, had burned down by the 1980s.\n\nIn 1988 the Metropolitan District Commission (since merged with the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation, or DCR) purchased of the original land. The farm was declared a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1965, a Boston Landmark in 1977, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The DCR now operate the state-owned portion as a historic site; the West Roxbury Historical Society periodically offers tours.\n\nBrook Farm was named for the brook that ran near the roadside and that eventually went to the Charles River. It was surrounded by low hills and its meadows and sunny slopes were diversified by orchard, quiet groves and denser pine woods. The land, however, turned out to be difficult to farm.\n\nThe land on the Keith lot that was purchased along with the Ellis farm included a functional farmhouse, which Brook Farmers immediately began calling \"The Hive\". The Hive became the center for social activities and was where the people of the community went to eat three meals a day. The Hive's dining room held fifty people and its library was stocked with George Ripley's personal book collection which was made available for all community members.\n\nAs the community grew, it became necessary to add more buildings for lodgings and various activities. The first building constructed was \"The Nest\", where school lessons took place and where guests of the farm would stay. Mr. and Mrs. Ripley's house, later to be called the Eyrie, was built during the second year. The next building to be built was the Margaret Fuller Cottage; though named after Fuller, she never spent a night there. A participant at Brook Farm named Ichabod Morton built the Pilgrim House, named in honor of his home town of Plymouth, Massachusetts. The -story building was the third structure built that year and cost nearly $5,000 to build. Morton stayed there only two weeks before moving out, after which the building was used for general lodging and also held the laundry facilities. The many constructions, including greenhouses and small craft shops, quickly reduced their treasury.\n\nParticipants at Brook Farm were also shareholders and were promised five percent of the annual profits or free tuition for one student. In exchange for 300 days of work per year, they were granted free room and board. Members performed whatever work most appealed to them and all, including women, were paid equal wages. The philosophy of labor, according to Ripley, was \"to insure a more natural union between intellectual and manual labor than now exists; to combine the thinker and the worker, as far as possible, in the same individual.\"\n\nThe organization of work in Brook Farm changed over time because of both financial troubles and changes in ideologies. Members of Brook Farm initially participated in an \"attractive industry\" system where each individual could pick his or her work assignments based on their won preferences. This method did not have any specific authority making sure that essential tasks were getting done. After initial leniency, some sensed that not all members were doing their fair share of the labor, so in 1841 the community adopted required standards for work: ten hours of work were required per day during the summer, and eight hours during winter. When Brook Farm first started adopting Fourierist notions, they created a more structured work environment with a system that consisted of three series of industry, which were agriculture, mechanical, and domestic, and within each series there were a number of groups that handled more specific tasks. Each group had a chief whose duty it was to keep a record of the work done. While this system did create a new work hierarchy, the members still had the flexibility to move between groups easily. These new measures caused Brook Farm to achieve a profit in 1844 which was a feat that had not been accomplished in its first few years of the community's existence.\n\nTypical work duties at Brook Farm included chopping wood, bringing in firewood, milking cows, turning a grindstone, and other farming chores. Not all were farmers, however. Some worked in the trades, including making shoes, and others were teachers. Regardless of the job, all were considered equal and because of the job distribution, as Elizabeth Peabody wrote, \"no one has any great weight in any one thing\". In exchange for their work, participants were granted several \"guarantees\", including \"medical attendance, nursing, education in all departments, amusements\". There were some occasional conflicts between different workers, partly because those who were educators believed themselves more aristocratic; overall, however, as historian Charles Crowe wrote, \"indeed all aspects of communal life operated with surprisingly little friction\" in general.\n\nVisitors to Brook Farm came frequently, totaling an estimated 1,150 each year, though each was charged for their visit. Between November 1844 and October 1845, surviving records show that $425 was collected from visitor fees. The list of visitors included theologian Henry James, Sr., sculptor William Wetmore Story, artist John Sartain, and British social reformer Robert Owen.\n\nDespite multiple sources of income, the community was in constant debt almost immediately after it began. The community, including Ripley, had difficulty with the farming aspects of the community, in particular because of poor soil and not enough labor. The major crop was hay, though it was sold at low grade prices; vegetables, milk, and fruit were not produced in high enough numbers to be profitable. The property was mortgaged four times between 1841 and 1845. Brook Farm got into the habit of spending money before they had raised it. As one Brook Farmer wrote, \"I think here lies the difficulty,—we have not had business men to conduct our affairs ... those among us who have some business talents, see this error\".\n\nOn September 29, 1841, the \"Brook Farm Institute of Agriculture and Education\" was organized. The school was the most immediate (and at times the only) source of income for Brook Farm and attracted students as far away as Cuba and the Philippines. Children under twelve were charged three-and-a-half dollars per week and, at first, boys over twelve were charged four dollars a week and girls were charged five; by August 1842, the rates were made identical, regardless of gender. Adult education was also available in the evenings. The schedule for adults included courses on moral philosophy, German language, and modern European history.\n\nWithin the school there was an infant school for children under six, a primary school for children under ten, and there was a preparatory school that prepared children for college in six years. When entering the school, each pupil under high school age was assigned a woman of the community who was in charge of his/her wardrobe, personal habits, and exercise. The teachers included three graduates of Harvard Divinity School (George Ripley, George Bradford, John Sullivan Dwight) as well as several women (Ripley's wife Sophia, his sister Marianne, and his cousin Hannah, as well as Georgianna Bruce and Abby Morton). Ripley was in charge of teaching English and was known to be relaxed in his class. Dana taught languages, being able to speak ten himself. Dwight taught music as well as Latin. Students studied European languages and literature and, at no extra cost, pupils could also indulge in the fine arts. The primary school was overseen by Sophia Ripley and Marianne Ripley, using a progressive child-centered pedagogy that has been compared to the later reforms of John Dewey. Sophia Ripley's dedication to the school was remarked upon by many; she only missed two classes in six years.\n\nThe people of Brook Farm spent most of their time either studying or working the farm, but they always set aside time in the day for play. In their free time, the members of Brook Farm enjoyed music, dancing, card games, drama, costume parties, sledding, and skating. Every week everyone in the community would gather at The Hive for a dance of the young ladies of the community. They would wear wreaths of wild daisies on top of their heads, and each week a special wreath, bought from a florist, would be given to the best dressed girl. At the end of every day, many performed a \"symbol of Universal Unity\", in which they stood in a circle and joined hands and vowed for \"truth to the cause of God and Humanity\".\n\nSpirits remained high throughout the experiment, regardless of the community's financial standing. Their social structure demanded selflessness and individuals rarely failed to fulfill their duties, a requirement to earn leisure time. Leisure time was important to the Brook Farm philosophy. As Elizabeth Palmer Peabody wrote for \"The Dial\" in January 1842, \"none will be engaged merely in bodily labor ... This community aims to be rich, not in the metallic representative of wealth, but in ... leisure to live in all the faculties of the soul\".\n\nAt Brook Farm, women had the opportunity to expand beyond their typical sphere of tasks and their labor was highly valued. They did have tasks that were typical of other women at the time such as simple food preparation, and shared housekeeping. However, during the harvest time women were allowed to work in the fields and men even helped out with laundry during the cold weather. Because no single religion could impose its beliefs on the community, women were safe from the typical patriarchy associated with religion at the time. Because of the community's focus on individual freedom, women were autonomous from their husbands and were also allowed to become stockholders. Women also played an important role in providing sources of income to the community. Many devoted time to making, as Brook Farmer Marianne Dwight described, \"elegant and tasteful caps, capes, collars, undersleeves, etc., etc.,\" for sale at shops in Boston. Others painted screens and lamp shades for sale. Women were allowed to go to school and, because of the well-known education of women at Brook Farm, many female writers and performers visited the farm. George Ripley's wife Sophia, who had written an outspoken feminist essay for \"The Dial\" on \"Woman\" before moving to Brook Farm, was very educated and was able to teach history and foreign languages at the farm.\n\nMany people in the community wrote of how much they enjoyed their experience and, in particular, the light-hearted atmosphere. One participant, a man named John Codman, joined the community at the age of 27 in 1843. He wrote, \"It was for the meanest a life above humdrum, and for the greatest something far, infinitely far beyond. They looked into the gates of life and saw beyond charming visions, and hopes springing up for all\". The idealism of the community sometimes was not met, however. Because the community was officially secular, a variety of religions were represented, though not always amicably. When Isaac Hecker and, later, Sophia Ripley converted to Catholicism, a Protestant Brook Farmer complained, \"We are beginning to see wooden crosses around and pictures of saints ... and I suspect that rosaries are rattling under aprons.\"\n\nNathaniel Hawthorne, eventually elected treasurer of the community, did not enjoy his experience. Initially, he praised the work he was doing, boasting of \"what a great, broad-shouldered, elephantine personage I shall become by and by!\" Later, he wrote to his wife-to-be Sophia Peabody, \"labor is the curse of the world, and nobody can meddle with it without becoming proportionately brutified\". After disassociating with the community Hawthorne demanded the return of his initial investment, though he never held any ill will with Ripley, to whom he wrote he would \"heartily rejoice at your success—of which I can see no reasonable doubt\".\n\nMany outside the community were critical of Brook Farm, especially in the press. The New York \"Observer\", for example, suggested that, \"The Associationists, under the pretense of a desire to promote order and morals, design to overthrow the marriage institution, and in the place of the divine law, to substitute the 'passions' as the proper regulator of the intercourse of the sexes\", concluding that they were \"secretly and industriously aiming to destroy the foundation of society\". Critic Edgar Allan Poe expressed his opinions on the community in an article titled \"Brook Farm\" in the December 13, 1845, issue of the \"Broadway Journal\". He wrote that he had \"sincere respect\" for the group and that its journal, \"The Harbinger\", was \"conducted by an assemblage of well-read persons who mean no harm—and who, perhaps, can do no less\". Despite many critics, none suggested George Ripley be replaced as Brook Farm's leader.\n\nRalph Waldo Emerson never joined the Brook Farm community, despite several invitations. He wrote to Ripley on December 15, 1840, of his \"conviction that the Community is not good for me\". He also questioned the idealism of the community, particularly its optimism that all members would equally share responsibility and workload. As he wrote, \"The country members naturally were surprised to observe that one man ploughed all day and one looked out of a window all day ... and both received at night the same wages\". Twenty years later, Emerson publicly denounced the experiment in his collection of essays titled \"The Conduct of Life\". Charles Lane, one of the founders of another community called Fruitlands, thought the Brook Farmers lived a lifestyle that did not sacrifice enough. As he said, they were \"playing away their youth and day-time in a miserably joyous frivolous manner\". Like other communities, Brook Farm was criticized for its potential to break up the nuclear family because of its focus on working as a larger community. After its conversion to Fourierism, the Transcendentalists showed less support for the experiment. Henry David Thoreau questioned the community members' idealism and wrote in his journal, \"As for these communities, I think I had rather keep bachelor's hall in hell than go to board in heaven\". Even Sophia Ripley later questioned their original optimism, referring to it as \"childish, empty, & sad\".\n\nNathaniel Hawthorne, though a founding member, was unhappy during his tenure as a Brook Farmer, partly because he was unable to write while living there. \"I have no quiet at all\", he complained, and his hands were covered \"with a new crop of blisters—the effect of raking hay\". He later presented a fictionalized portrait of his experience in his 1852 novel, \"The Blithedale Romance\". He acknowledged the resemblance in his introduction, saying \"in the 'Blithedale' of this volume, many readers will probably suspect a faint and not very faithful shadowing of Brook Farm, in West Roxbury, which (now a little more than ten years ago) was occupied and cultivated by a company of socialists.\" The chapter called \"The Masqueraders\", for example, was based on a picnic held one September to celebrate the harvest season. George Ripley, who reviewed the book for the \"New York Tribune\", said that former Brook Farmers would only notice the resemblance in the humorous parts of the story. Some have also seen a resemblance between Margaret Fuller and Hawthorne's fictional character Zenobia. In the novel, a visitor—a writer like Hawthorne—finds that hard farm labor is not conducive to intellectual creativity.\n\n\n\n\n"}

In 1739 he came to Paris, and after teaching in the colleges of Lisieux and Navarre, was appointed to the chair of Greek and Roman philosophy in the Collège de France. \nHis 1746 treatise \"Les beaux arts réduits à un même principe\" (translated into English as \"The Fine Arts Reduced to a Single Principle\", trans. James O. Young, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2015) was an attempt to find a unity among existing theories of beauty and taste on \"a single principle\", and its views were widely accepted, not only in France but throughout Europe.\nAccording to P. O. Kristeller, \n\nThe reputation thus gained, confirmed by his translation of Horace (1750), led to Batteux's becoming a member of the Académie des Inscriptions (1754) and of the Académie française (1761). His \"Cours de belles lettres\" (1765) was afterwards included with some minor writings in the large treatise, \"Principes de la littérature\" (1774). His philosophical writings were \"La morale d'Épicure tirée de ses propres écrits\" (1758), and the \"Histoire des causes premières\" (1769). In consequence of the freedom with which in this work he attacked the abuse of authority in philosophy, he lost his professorial chair. \nHis last and most extensive work was a \"Cours d'études à l'usage des élèves de l'école militaire\" in forty-five volumes.\n\nIn \"Les Beaux Arts\", Batteux developed a theory influenced by John Locke through Voltaire's sceptical sensualism. He held that the fine arts are arts (\"assemblages of rules for doing well\"), for producing fine or beautiful things (\"which please\" of themselves), always \"in imitation of \"la belle nature\"\" and requiring genius. \nApplying this principle to the art of poetry, and analysing, line by line and even word by word, the works of great poets, he deduced the law that the beauty of poetry consists in the accuracy, beauty and harmony of individual expression. \nHis \"Histoire des causes premières\" was among the first attempts at a history of philosophy, and in his work on Epicurus, following on Gassendi, he defended Epicureanism against the general attacks made against it.\n\nStrictly in Aesthetics terms Batteux sets the single principle for fine arts in imitation of nature, and this in terms of ideal of perfection to make an harmonious whole: \"let's choose the most beautiful parts of nature, to make an exquisite whole, more perfect then nature, but never ending to be natural\". In this concept, clearly, Batteux follows a long tradition, present at least in Leon Battista Alberti; as well as for the expression of fine arts, present in Giovanni Battista Armenini and more back in Sebastiano Serlio.\n"}

He also served as an administrative assistant at Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory, and later as one of its official historians. Together with Herbert A. Simon, he discovered and proved the Hawkins–Simon theorem.\n\nDavid Hawkins was born in El Paso, Texas, the youngest of seven children of William Ashton Hawkins, and his wife Clara Gardiner. His father was a prominent lawyer noted for his work on water law, who worked for the El Paso and Northeastern Railway, and was one of the founders of the city of Alamogordo, New Mexico. He grew up in La Luz, New Mexico.\n\nHawkins attended Hotchkiss School in Lakeville, Connecticut, but left after his junior year to enter Stanford University. He initially studied chemistry, but then switched to physics before finally majoring in philosophy. He was awarded his B.A. in 1934 and M.A. in 1936. While he was there, he met Frances Pockman, a teacher and writer. They were married in San Francisco in 1937. They had a daughter, Julie.\n\nIn 1936 Hawkins went to the University of California, Berkeley, to work on his doctorate. He became friends with Robert Oppenheimer, with whom he liked to discuss Hindu philosophy, and issues in the philosophy of science, such as the uncertainty principle, and Niels Bohr's complementarity. In 1938, Hawkins and his wife Frances joined the Berkeley campus branch of the Communist Party of America. He earned his Ph.D. in 1940, writing his thesis on \"A Causal Interpretation of Probability\".\n\nAfter graduating, Hawkins worked at Berkeley until May 1943, when Oppenheimer recruited him to work at the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory, also known as Project Y, as his administrative assistant. \"I was intrigued by the thought of being part of this extraordinary development\", he later explained, \"And it was still of course in those days entirely focused on the terrible thought that the Germans might get this weapon and win World War II.\"\n\nHawkins saw his role as that of a go-between, mediating between the civilian scientists and the military leadership at Los Alamos; but he also found a kindred spirit in the Polish mathematician Stan Ulam, who was working in Edward Teller's \"Super\" Group. They investigated the problem of branching a neutron multiplication in a nuclear chain reaction. Stan Frankel and Richard Feynman had tackled the problem using classical physics, but Ulam and Hawkins approached it using probability theory, creating a new sub-field now known as branching process theory. They investigated branching chains using a characteristic function. After the war, Ulam would extend and generalise this work. He described Hawkins as \"the most talented amateur mathematician I know.\" \n\nHawkins is credited with the selection of the Alamogordo area for the Trinity nuclear test, but he declined to watch it. His final assignment at Los Alamos was as its historian, writing the history of Project Y. He completed this work in August 1946, covering the history of Project Y up to August 1945, but it remained classified until 1961. He was a founding member of the Federation of American Scientists.\n\nWith World War II over, he left Los Alamos to become an associate professor of philosophy at George Washington University, but left in 1947 to join the faculty at the University of Colorado Boulder. Together with Herbert A. Simon, he discovered and proved the Hawkins–Simon theorem on the \"conditions for the existence of positive solution vectors for input-output matrices.\" This macroeconomic theorem helped economists better understand the interconnectedness of various sectors of an economy.\n\nOn December 20, 1950, Hawkins was called before the House Un-American Activities Committee. He testified that he had been a member of the Communist Party from 1938 to 1942. The testimony of Hawkins and his wife Frances was released publicly in January 1951, resulting in an outcry led by \"The Denver Post\". There were calls for his dismissal, but he had tenure, and under the university's law, this could only be revoked for incompetence or moral turpitude. The regents took a vote, and were split evenly; the numbers went in his favor when one of them died. He remained at the University of Colorado until he retired in 1982, except for periods as a visiting professor at Berkeley, the University of North Carolina, Cornell University, Simon Fraser University, the University of Michigan and the University of Rome. He was also a fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study and the American Council of Learned Societies.\n\nFrom 1962 on, Hawkins increasingly took an interest in early childhood education, and in improving elementary school science education. With his wife Frances, they established the Elementary Science Advisory Center to improve the standard of science teaching, which he directed from 1965 to 1970. In 1970 they founded the campus-based Mountain View Center for Environmental Education with funding from the university and the Ford Foundation, which provided advanced education for elementary school teachers. He was a consultant to the National Institute of Education and the National Science Foundation. In 1981, he received a $300,000 \"genius grant\" from the MacArthur Foundation. \n\nHawkins died at his home in Boulder, Colorado, on February 24, 2002. He was survived by his wife Frances and daughter Julie.\nHis papers are in the University of Colorado, Boulder, library. In 2013, the University of Colorado hosted an interactive exhibit in Boulder about his life and work, \"Cultivate the Scientist in Every Child: The Philosophy of Frances and David Hawkins\". Over the following five years the exhibit travelled to Wyoming, New Mexico, Nebraska, Illinois, Wisconsin, Tennessee, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and California, before landing in its permanent home at Boulder Journey School in Boulder, CO.\n\n\n"}

The book is the study of embodiment in cyberspace, an ideal book also related to human–computer interaction (HCI); Ihde explores the meaning of bodies in technology.\n\nDon Ihde entirely rejects Cartesian dualism and Ihde further \"does not believe we human beings can exist in disembodied form.\" Even to have an out of body experience is to have an implicit 'here-body' from which we experience an 'object-body' over there. Ihde believes in having 'I am my body.' But its outlines are ambiguous and 'my experience' can reach through other spatialitities. Don Ihde has further explored these arguments in his book \"Bodies in Technology\" \n\nBeginning with a \"phenomenology of multistability\" in the way various \"technological media\" are perceived, Don Ihde examines the \"roles of human embodiment, perception, and spatial transformations within communication and information media.\" \nIhde (2006) argues that movies like the Matrix trilogy play upon fantasy in a technological context and relate to the human sense of embodiment. Ihde points out to an important fact that we have to experience the embodiment where we live, rather than to \"plugin\" to a technofantasies world.\n\nIhde is the Director of the Technoscience Research Group in the Philosophy Department. The study of technoscience examines cutting-edge work in the fields of the philosophies of science and technology, and science studies; it also emphasizes the roles of our material cultures and expertise.\n\nIhde directs the graduate and post-graduate Technoscience research seminar, which reads only living authors such as Donna Haraway, Bruno Latour, Ian Hacking, Andrew Pickering, Sandra Harding. Ihde has on occasion invited other authors to the seminar for a \"roast\". Past roastees have included Peter Galison, Hubert Dreyfus, Albert Borgmann, Andrew Feenberg, and Harry Collins.\n\nThe seminar on technoscience has resulted in a number of publications related to its activities, and participants regularly present research results at major international conferences (Aarhus, Denmark; Vienna, Austria; CERN, Switzerland, etc.).\n\nIn a paper \"Was Heidegger prescient concerning Technoscience?\", Ihde re-examines Martin Heidegger's philosophy of science with a reappraisal of what was innovative, and what remained archaic. Heidegger then is read against the background of the \"new\" approaches to science in science studies, and against the background of the scientific revolutions which have occurred since the mid-20th century.\n\nOn the issues of \"Hermeneutics from the Phenomenological Perspective\" Ihde examines what might he called a \"material hermeneutics,\" which characterizes much practice within the domains of technoscience. Ihde rejects the vestigial Diltheyan division between the humanistic and natural sciences and argues that certain types of critical interpretation, broadly hermeneutic, characterize both sets of disciplines. Ihde examines what he calls a style of interpretation based in material practices relating to imaging technologies which have given rise to the visual hermeneutics in technoscience studies. Veszprém, 1993, it was at that meeting that Ihde first proposed the notion of \"Expanding hermeneutics\".\n\n\"Abstract of Ihde's Sheffield paper on Material Hermeneutics, 2006\":\n\nDon Ihde has argued on numerous occasions that \"if the philosopher is to play a more important role it must not be only in or limited to the 'Hemingway role'. Rather, it should take place in the equivalent of the officers' strategy meeting, before the battle takes shape. I will call this the 'R&D role'\" (Ihde, 1999, p. 46). Philosophers should engage themselves on \"interdisciplinary research teams and play precisely ‘R&D’ roles\" (p. 49). Over the years Don Ihde has been pleading that philosophers should be in the 'R&D' position. The philosophers of technology \"should reposition themselves\" in the \"R&D\" position where \"technologies are taking developmental shape, in think tanks, in incubator facilities, in research centers. Only then can truly \"new\" and emerging technologies be philosophically engaged\" (Ihde, 2012, p. 332).\n\n\"Philosophers, postphenomenologists, in R&D positions could conceivable bring to bear thinking on future, rather than past or actually in-place phenomena\" argues Don Ihde (2003, p. 7).\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5161347", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5161347", "title": "Ethics of terraforming", "text": "Ethics of terraforming\n\nThe ethics of terraforming has constituted a philosophical debate within biology, ecology, and environmental ethics as to whether terraforming other worlds is an ethical endeavor.\n\nOn the pro-terraforming side of the argument, there are those like Robert Zubrin and Richard L. S. Taylor who believe that it is humanity's moral obligation to make other worlds suitable for Terran life, as a continuation of the history of life transforming the environments around it on Earth. They also point out that Earth will eventually be destroyed as nature takes its course, so that humanity faces a very long-term choice between terraforming other worlds or allowing all Earth life to become extinct. Dr. Zubrin further argues that even if native microbes have arisen on Mars, for example, the fact that they have not progressed beyond the microbe stage by this point, halfway through the lifetime of the Sun, is a strong indicator that they never will; and that if microbial life exists on Mars, it is likely related to Earth life through a common origin on one of the two planets, which spread to the other as an example of panspermia. Since Mars life would then not be fundamentally unrelated to Earth life, it would not be unique, and competition with such life would not be fundamentally different from competing against microbes on Earth.\n\nDr. Zubrin summed up this view:\n\nRichard Taylor more succinctly exemplified this point of view with the slogan, \"move over microbe\".\n\nSome critics label this argument as an example of anthropocentrism. These critics may view the homocentric view as not only geocentric but short-sighted, and tending to favour human interests to the detriment of ecological systems. They argue that an anthropocentrically driven approach could lead to the extinction of indigenous extraterrestrial life, or the Interplanetary contamination.\n\nMartyn J. Fogg rebutted these ideas by delineating four potential rationales on which to evaluate the ethics of terraforming—anthropocentrism, zoocentrism, ecocentrism, and preservationism—roughly forming a spectrum from placing the most value on human utility to placing the most value on preserving nature. While concluding that arguments for protecting alien biota can be made from any of these standpoints, he also concludes with an argument, similar to Zubrin's, that strict preservationism is \"untenable\", since \"it assumes that human consciousness, creativity, culture and technology stand outside nature, rather than having been a product of natural selection. If \"Homo sapiens\" is the first space faring species to have evolved on Earth, space settlement would not involve acting 'outside nature', but legitimately 'within our nature'.\" \n\nStrong ecocentrists like Richard Sylvan feel there is an intrinsic value to life, and seek to preserve the existence of native lifeforms. This idea is usually referred to as biocentrism. In response to these objections, weak anthropocentrism incorporates biocentric ethics, allowing for various degrees of terraforming.\n\nChristopher McKay strikes a position between these two, what may be termed weak ecocentrism, proposing that an entire biosphere of alien life, even if only microbial life, has far more value than individual microbes, and should not be subject to interference by Earth life. However, he also proposed that it would be valuable and desirable to terraform a planet to nurture the alien life, to allow it to thrive as well as to exhibit a broader range of behavior for scientific study, and that such activity is ultimately justified by the utilitarian value to humans of being able to study and appreciate the still somewhat undisturbed alien life.\n\nMcKay put his views in these words:\n\nEven this \"help\" would be seen as a type of terraforming to the strictest of ecocentrists, who would say that all life has the right, in its home biosphere, to evolve at its own pace as well as its own direction, free of any outside interference. The impact of the human species on otherwise untouched worlds and the possible interference with or elimination of alien life forms are good reasons to leave these other worlds in their natural states; this is an example of a strong biocentric view, or object-centered ethic. Critics claim this is a form of anti-humanism and they assert that rocks and bacteria can not have rights, nor should the discovery of alien life prevent terraforming from occurring.\n\nPragmatists argue that humanity on other planets is sociologically impractical. The basis is that being on another planet wouldn't change human nature, so it wouldn't be long until pollution and destruction by humankind began, and on a planet that has probably only known peace since its formation. Since life on Earth will ultimately be destroyed by planetary impacts or the red giant phase of the Sun, all native species will perish if not allowed to move to other objects.\n\nSome advocates of animal welfare have pointed out the ethical issues associated with spreading Earth-based wild-animal life by terraforming. In particular, they claim it may be ethically objectionable to bring into existence large numbers of animals that suffer greatly during their often-short lives in the wild. There are also concerns that even with full terraformation, distinct differences between Earth and Mars, such as gravity, lengths of the day and night cycles, and differing/lacking magnetic fields, would cause harm to many introduced species that have evolved for millions of years under Earth conditions. Though some species may survive, and others possibly could be adapted through genetic modification, if the introduced species were isolated on Mars and not frequently interbred with Earth counterparts, the species would eventually evolve through many generations in order to better suit their new environment, possibly leading to different evolutionary lines. Thus, the introduced life may eventually look and act very different from their Earthly counterparts and/or ancestors.\n\nAnother aspect of terraforming ethics deals with an opposing extreme in this debate. Terraforming could be seen as a potential waste of precious materials, in light of alternative uses. Critics believe that it would constrict the growth potential of humanity by encapsulating the material inside of an astronomical object. Once the surface is terraformed and people have taken residence there, all the interior material is needed to sustain the maximum gravity potential for those inhabitants. If all of the material were utilized to produce space habitation systems, a much greater number of lives would then be supported.\n\nThe contrasts between these arguments are fully explored in the field of environmental ethics. Some researchers suggest that both paradigms need to mature into a more complex, cosmocentric ethic which incorporates the (unknown) value of extraterrestrial life with the values of humanity and all things in the universe. Debates often focus on how much time and effort should be expended on investigating the possibility of any microscopic life on a planet before deciding whether to terraform, and what level of sophistication or chances for future development alien life would deserve varying levels of commitment to non-interference. Such debates have been engaged in live, between Zubrin and McKay and others, at various conferences of the Mars Society, which has made written and video records of the debates available. For example, a written account of some of these debates is available in \"\", as a joint article, \"Do Indigenous Martian Bacteria have Precedence over Human Exploration?\" (pp. 177–182)\n\nA fairly thorough non-fictional analysis of the ethics of terraforming is also presented under the guise of the fictional Mars trilogy by Kim Stanley Robinson, particularly between the characters Ann Clayborne and Sax Russell, with Clayborne epitomizing an ecocentric ethic of non-interference and Russell embodying the anthropocentric belief in the virtue of terraforming.\nThe idea of interplanetary colonization and its ethical implications are also explored by C.S. Lewis in the first book of his Space Trilogy \"Out of the Silent Planet\" published in 1938.\n\nThe plot of the 1982 film \"\" is based around the use of the so-called \"Genesis Device\" to create the conditions and organic building-blocks for life on previously lifeless planets. In debating the ethics of the device, Dr. McCoy, Spock and Admiral Kirk reflect on the Device's ability to replace any existing lifeforms with \"its new matrix\". McCoy describes the ethics of the Device in the following terms: \"According to myth, the Earth was created in six days. Now watch out - here comes Genesis! We'll do it for you in six minutes!\" The technology is shown to be flawed in the 1984 sequel, \"\"\n\n\"\" dealt with terraforming. In the episode \"Home Soil\", terraformers are causing harm to the native lifeforms on Velara III, with disastrous consequences.\n\nIn the novel \"Revelation Space\" by Alastair Reynolds, there was a political dispute in the human colony of a fictional planet called Resurgam between a faction who were in support of terraforming the planet and another faction of archeologists who were against terraforming due to the discovery of the remains of an extinct alien civilisation on the planet and due to the fear that any attempt to terraform the planet would destroy the valuable artifacts that still might be buried underground.\n\nThe ethics of terraforming, as well as deep space colonization, are recurring themes in \"Firefly\", in which they are compared to the issues of expansionism and imperialism in the American Old West.\n\n\nCathcart, R.B., Badescu, V. with Ramesh Radhakrishnan, MACRO-ENGINEERS' DREAMS (23 November 2006), a cost-free downloadable 176-page exposition made available at http://textbookrevolution.org in its engineering selection of textbooks.\n"}

A book of the same name was published in 1982.\n\nAccording to the book \"The Men Who Stare at Goats\" by journalist Jon Ronson, Channon spent time in the 1970s with many of the people in California credited with starting the Human Potential Movement, and subsequently wrote an operations manual for a First Earth Battalion. The manual was a 125-page mixture of drawings, graphs, maps, polemical essays, and point-by-point redesigns of every aspect of military life. Channon imagined a new battlefield uniform that would include pouches for ginseng regulators, divining tools, food stuffs to enhance night vision, and a loudspeaker that would automatically emit \"indigenous music and words of peace.\" A movie based on the book—released in Autumn 2009—starring George Clooney, Ewan McGregor, Jeff Bridges and Kevin Spacey, fictionalized the First Earth Battalion as the \"New Earth Army\".\n\nChannon believed the Army could be the principal moral and ethical basis on which politics could harmonize in the name of the Earth. He declared that the First Earth Battalion's primary allegiance was to the planet earth. Channon envisioned that the First Earth Battalion would organize itself informally: uniforms without uniformity, structure without status, and unity powered by diversity, and members would be multicultural, with each race contributing to \"rainbow power\". He also proposed as a guiding principle that members of the First Earth Battalion seek nondestructive methods of conflict resolution because their first loyalty is to the planet.\n\nChannon adopted the term \"warrior monk\" for potential members of the First Earth Battalion.\n\nAccording to the book \"Mind Wars\" by Ronald McRae, each member of the First Earth Battalion would be sworn to uphold a credo of \"high commandos and guerrilla gurus\":\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1721496", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1721496", "title": "Free and open-source software", "text": "Free and open-source software\n\nFree and open-source software (FOSS) is software that can be classified as both free software and open-source software. That is, anyone is freely licensed to use, copy, study, and change the software in any way, and the source code is openly shared so that people are encouraged to voluntarily improve the design of the software. This is in contrast to proprietary software, where the software is under restrictive copyright licensing and the source code is usually hidden from the users.\n\nFOSS maintains the software user's civil liberty rights (see the Four Essential Freedoms, below). Other benefits of using FOSS can include decreased software costs, increased security and stability (especially in regard to malware), protecting privacy, education, and giving users more control over their own hardware. Free and open-source operating systems such as Linux and descendants of BSD are widely utilized today, powering millions of servers, desktops, smartphones (e.g. Android), and other devices. Free-software licenses and open-source licenses are used by many software packages. The free-software movement and the open-source software movement are online social movements behind widespread production and adoption of FOSS.\n\n\"Free and open-source software\" (FOSS) is an umbrella term for software that is simultaneously considered both Free software and open-source software. FOSS (free and open-source software) allows the user to inspect the source code and provides a high level of control of the software's functions compared to proprietary software. The term \"free software\" does not refer to the monetary cost of the software at all, but rather whether the license maintains the software user's civil liberties (\"free” as in “free speech,” not as in “free beer”). There are a number of related terms and abbreviations for free and open-source software (FOSS or F/OSS), or free/libre and open-source software (FLOSS or F/LOSS -- FLOSS is the FSF-preferred term). \n\nAlthough there is almost a complete overlap between free-software licenses and open-source-software licenses, there is a strong philosophical disagreement between the advocates of these two positions. The terminology of FOSS or \"Free and Open-source software\" was created to be a neutral on these philosophical disagreements between the FSF and OSI and have a single unified term that could refer to both concepts.\n\nAs the Free Software Foundation (FSF) explains the philosophical difference between free software and open-source software: \"The two terms describe almost the same category of software, but they stand for views based on fundamentally different values. Open-source is a development methodology; free software is a social movement. For the free-software movement, free software is an ethical imperative, essential respect for the users' freedom. By contrast, the philosophy of open-source considers issues in terms of how to make software “better”—in a practical sense only.\" In parallel to this the Open Source Initiative (OSI) considers many free-software licenses to also be open source. These include the latest versions of the FSF's three main licenses: the GPL, the Lesser General Public License (LGPL), and the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL). \n\nRichard Stallman's Free Software Definition, adopted by the Free Software Foundation (FSF), defines free software as a matter of liberty not price, and it upholds the Four Essential Freedoms. The earliest-known publication of the definition of his free-software idea was in the February 1986 edition of the FSF's now-discontinued GNU's Bulletin publication. The canonical source for the document is in the philosophy section of the GNU Project website. As of August 2017, it is published there in 40 languages.\n\nTo meet the definition of \"free software\", the FSF requires the software's licensing rights what the FSF respect the civil liberties / human rights of what the FSF calls the software user's \"Four Essential Freedoms\".\n\n\nThe open-source-software definition is used by the Open Source Initiative (OSI) to determine whether a software license qualifies for the organization's insignia for Open-source software. The definition was based on the Debian Free Software Guidelines, written and adapted primarily by Bruce Perens. Perens did not base his writing on the Four Essential Freedoms of free software from the Free Software Foundation, which were only later available on the web. Perens subsequently stated that he felt Eric Raymond's promotion of Open-source unfairly overshadowed the Free Software Foundation's efforts and reaffirmed his support for Free software. In the following 2000s, he spoke about open source again.\n\nIn the 1950s through the 1980s, it was common for computer users to have the source code for all programs they used, and the permission and ability to modify it for their own use. Software, including source code, was commonly shared by individuals who used computers, often as public domain software. Most companies had a business model based on hardware sales, and provided or bundled software with hardware, free of charge.\n\nBy the late 1960s, the prevailing business model around software was changing. A growing and evolving software industry was competing with the hardware manufacturer's bundled software products; rather than funding software development from hardware revenue, these new companies were selling software directly. Leased machines required software support while providing no revenue for software, and some customers able to better meet their own needs did not want the costs of software bundled with hardware product costs. In \"United States vs. IBM\", filed 17 January 1969, the government charged that bundled software was anticompetitive. While some software was still being provided without monetary cost and license restriction, there was a growing amount of software that was only at a monetary cost with restricted licensing. In the 1970s and early 1980s, some parts of the software industry began using technical measures (such as distributing only binary copies of computer programs) to prevent computer users from being able to use reverse engineering techniques to study and customize software they had paid for. In 1980, the copyright law was extended to computer programs in the United States—previously, computer programs could be considered ideas, procedures, methods, systems, and processes, which are not copyrightable.\n\nEarly on, closed-source software was uncommon until the mid-1970s to the 1980s, when IBM implemented in 1983 an \"object code only\" policy, no longer distributing source code.\n\nIn 1983, Richard Stallman, longtime member of the hacker community at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, announced the GNU project, saying that he had become frustrated with the effects of the change in culture of the computer industry and its users. Software development for the GNU operating system began in January 1984, and the Free Software Foundation (FSF) was founded in October 1985. An article outlining the project and its goals was published in March 1985 titled the \"GNU Manifesto\". The manifesto included significant explanation of the GNU philosophy, \"Free Software Definition\" and \"copyleft\" ideas. The FSF takes the position that the fundamental issue Free software addresses is an ethical one—to ensure software users can exercise what it calls \"The Four Essential Freedoms\".\n\nThe Linux kernel, created by Linus Torvalds, was released as freely modifiable source code in 1991. Initially, Linux was not released under either a Free software or an Open-source software license. However, with version 0.12 in February 1992, he relicensed the project under the GNU General Public License.\n\nFreeBSD and NetBSD (both derived from 386BSD) were released as Free software when the USL v. BSDi lawsuit was settled out of court in 1993. OpenBSD forked from NetBSD in 1995. Also in 1995, The Apache HTTP Server, commonly referred to as Apache, was released under the Apache License 1.0.\n\nIn 1997, Eric Raymond published The Cathedral and the Bazaar, a reflective analysis of the hacker community and Free software principles. The paper received significant attention in early 1998, and was one factor in motivating Netscape Communications Corporation to release their popular Netscape Communicator Internet suite as Free software. This code is today better known as Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird.\n\nNetscape's act prompted Raymond and others to look into how to bring the FSF's Free software ideas and perceived benefits to the commercial software industry. They concluded that FSF's social activism was not appealing to companies like Netscape, and looked for a way to rebrand the Free software movement to emphasize the business potential of sharing and collaborating on software source code. The new name they chose was \"Open-source\", and quickly Bruce Perens, publisher Tim O'Reilly, Linus Torvalds, and others signed on to the rebranding. The Open Source Initiative was founded in February 1998 to encourage the use of the new term and evangelize open-source principles.\n\nWhile the Open Source Initiative sought to encourage the use of the new term and evangelize the principles it adhered to, commercial software vendors found themselves increasingly threatened by the concept of freely distributed software and universal access to an application's source code. A Microsoft executive publicly stated in 2001 that \"Open-source is an intellectual property destroyer. I can't imagine something that could be worse than this for the software business and the intellectual-property business.\" This view perfectly summarizes the initial response to FOSS by some software corporations. For many years FOSS played a niche role outside of the mainstream of private software development. However the success of FOSS Operating Systems such as GNU/Linux, BSD and the companies based on FOSS such as Red Hat, has changed the software industry's attitude and there has been a dramatic shift in the corporate philosophy concerning the development of Free and Open-source software (FOSS). \n\nUsers of FOSS benefit from the Four Essential Freedoms to making unrestricted use, study, copy, modify, and redistribute such software with or without modification. If they would like to change the functionality of software they can bring about changes to the code and, if they wish, distribute such modified versions of the software or often − depending on the software's decision making model and its other users − even push or request such changes to be made via updates to the original software.\n\nManufacturers of proprietary, closed-source software are sometimes pressured to building in backdoors or other covert, undesired features into their software. Instead of having to trust software vendors users of FOSS can inspect and verify the source code themselves and can put trust on a community of volunteers and users. As proprietary code is typically hidden from public view, only the vendors themselves and hackers may be aware of any vulnerabilities in them while FOSS involves as many people as possible for exposing bugs quickly.\n\nFOSS is often free of charge although donations are often encouraged. This also allows users to better test and compare software.\n\nFOSS allows for better collaboration among various parties and individuals with the goal of developing the most efficient software for its users or use-cases while proprietary software is typically meant to generate profits. Furthermore, in many cases more organizations and individuals contribute to such projects than to proprietary software. It has been shown that technical superiority is typically the primary reason why companies choose open source software.\n\nInfringes on user's civil liberties and human rights\n\nBy definition proprietary software does not respect the user's Four Essential Freedoms. This means that even though the software purchaser has bought the software, the software does not fully belong to the purchaser because the software can not be used to do whatever the user wishes with it and that the source code is not made available by it's creator to be inspected, modified and redistributed. This state of affairs is counter to what people are used to such as when they purchase an item (ie. a car), they have the right to do with it as they please, to tinker with it, modify it or resell it.\n\nAccording to Linus's Law the more people who can see and test a set of code, the more likely any flaws will be caught and fixed quickly. However, this does not guarantee a high level of participation. Having a grouping of full-time professionals behind a commercial product can in some cases be superior to FOSS.\n\nFurthermore, publicized source code might make it easier for hackers to find vulnerabilities in it and write exploits. This however assumes that such malicious hackers are more effective than white hat hackers which responsibly disclose or help fix the vulnerabilities, that no code leaks or exfiltrations occur and that reverse engineering of proprietary code is a hindrance of significance for malicious hackers.\n\nOften FOSS is not compatible with proprietary hardware or specific software. This is often due to manufacturers obstructing FOSS such as by not disclosing the interfaces or other specifications needed for members of the FOSS movement to write drivers for their hardware − for instance as they wish customers to run only their own proprietary software or as they might benefit from partnerships.\n\nWhile FOSS can be superior to proprietary equivalents in terms of software features and stability, in many cases FOSS has more unfixed bugs and missing features when compared to similar commercial software. This varies per case and usually depends on the level of interest and participation in a FOSS project. Furthermore, unlike with typical commercial software missing features and bugfixes can be implemented by any party that has the relevant motivation, time and skill to do so.\n\nThere is often less certainty in FOSS projects gaining the required resources / participation for continued development than commercial software backed by companies. However companies also often abolish projects for being unprofitable and often large companies rely on and hence co-develop open source software.\n\nAs the FOSS operating system distributions of GNU/Linux has a lower market share of end users there are also fewer applications available.\n\nGNU/Linux may require more effort or technical knowledge to set up and maintain.\n\nIn 2017, the European Commission stated that \"EU institutions should become open source software users themselves, even more than they already are\" and listed open source software as one of the nine key drivers of innovation, together with big data, mobility, cloud computing and the internet of things.\n\nWhile copyright is the primary legal mechanism that FOSS authors use to ensure license compliance for their software, other mechanisms such as legislation, patents, and trademarks have implications as well. In response to legal issues with patents and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), the Free Software Foundation released version 3 of its GNU Public License in 2007 that explicitly addressed the DMCA and patent rights.\n\nAfter the development of the GNU GPLv3 in 2007, the FSF (as the copyright holder of many pieces of the GNU system) updated many of the GNU programs' licenses from GPLv2 to GPLv3. On the other hand, the adoption of the new GPL version was heavily discussed in the FOSS ecosystem, several projects decided against upgrading. For instance the linux kernel, the BusyBox project, AdvFS, Blender, and as also the VLC media player decided against adopting the GPLv3.\n\nApple, a user of GCC and a heavy user of both DRM and patents, switched the compiler in its Xcode IDE from GCC to Clang, which is another FOSS compiler but is under a permissive license. LWN speculated that Apple was motivated partly by a desire to avoid GPLv3. The Samba project also switched to GPLv3, so Apple replaced Samba in their software suite by a closed-source, proprietary software alternative.\n\nLeemhuis criticizes the prioritization of skilled developers who − instead of fixing issues in popular applications and desktop environments − create new, mostly redundant software to gain fame and fortune.\n\nHe also criticizes notebook manufacturers for optimizing their own products only privately or creating workarounds instead of helping fix the actual causes of the many issues with GNU/Linux on notebooks such as the unnecessary power consumption.\n\nMergers have affected major open-source software. Sun Microsystems (Sun) acquired MySQL AB, owner of the popular open-source MySQL database, in 2008.\n\nOracle in turn purchased Sun in January, 2010, acquiring their copyrights, patents, and trademarks. Thus, Oracle became the owner of both the most popular proprietary database and the most popular open-source database. Oracle's attempts to commercialize the open-source MySQL database have raised concerns in the FOSS community. Partly in response to uncertainty about the future of MySQL, the FOSS community forked the project into new database systems outside of Oracle's control. These include MariaDB, Percona, and Drizzle. All of these have distinct names; they are distinct projects and cannot use the trademarked name MySQL.\n\nIn August, 2010, Oracle sued Google, claiming that its use of Java in Android infringed on Oracle's copyrights and patents. The Oracle v. Google case ended in May 2012, with the finding that Google did not infringe on Oracle's patents, and the trial judge ruled that the structure of the Java APIs used by Google was not copyrightable. The jury found that Google infringed a small number of copied files, but the parties stipulated that Google would pay no damages. Oracle appealed to the Federal Circuit, and Google filed a cross-appeal on the literal copying claim.\n\nBy defying ownership regulations in the construction and use of information − a key area of contemporary growth − the Free/Open Source Software (FOSS) movement counters neoliberalism and privatization in general.\n\nBy realizing the historical potential of an \"economy of abundance\" for the new digital world FOSS may lay down a plan for political resistance or show the way towards a potential transformation of capitalism.\n\nAccording to Yochai Benkler, Jack N. and Lillian R. Berkman Professor for Entrepreneurial Legal Studies at Harvard Law School, free software is the most visible part of a new economy of commons-based peer production of information, knowledge, and culture. As examples, he cites a variety of FOSS projects, including both free software and open-source.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "27554939", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27554939", "title": "Greenhouse Development Rights", "text": "Greenhouse Development Rights\n\nGreenhouse Development Rights (GDRs) is a justice-based effort-sharing framework designed to show how the costs of rapid climate stabilization can be shared fairly, among all countries. More precisely, GDRs seeks to transparently calculate national “fair shares” in the costs of an emergency global climate mobilization, in a manner that takes explicit account of the fact that, as things now stand, global political and economic life is divided along both North/South and rich/poor lines.\n\nCritically, GDRs approaches climate protection and economic development as two sides of one coin. Its goal is developmental justice, as it might exist even in a world that is compelled to rapidly reduce greenhouse-gas emissions to near-zero levels. The GDRs analysis suggests that rapid climate stabilization will prove impossible without an extremely strong commitment – a right – to a dignified level of sustainable human development (humanity). A right to life free from the privations of poverty.\n\nThe GDRs approach builds, whenever possible, upon established scientific and political understandings. In particular, it explicitly codifies the foundational call of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which seeks “the widest possible cooperation by all countries and their participation in an effective and appropriate international response, in accordance with their common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities.” The GDRs strategy is to transparently calculate responsibility and capacity for all countries, with respect to explicit assumptions and benchmarks that can be clearly debated, negotiated, and, when necessary, changed. By so doing, it seeks to provide a coherent, transparent, and compelling way of calculating and comparing national “fair shares” – broadly defined – of the cost of the global climate transition.\n\nThe goal of the GDRs effort is a sustainable mobilization that can be accepted as fair around the world. National obligations are calculated as shares of a global obligation that includes adaptation as well as mitigation. The approach here does not traditionally exhibit political realism, for that term is generally understood to imply an approach that starts with what is politically realistic today. The GDRs approach, in contrast, seeks to outline an approach that is consistent with the requirements of the climate science.\n\nIn the GDRs framework, a country’s obligation to act is based upon its climate debt – its responsibility for contributing to climate change – and equally upon its capacity to act. Responsibility and capacity are both defined with respect to a “development threshold” that exempts the responsibilities and resources of the poor – survival resources and survival income – from being considered when calculating national obligation. Thus, GDRs can be seen as a \"reference framework\" intended to support clear, useful thinking about “comparability of effort,” even between widely disparate developed and developing nations.\n\nFinally, GDRs is not an academic exercise. Climate stabilization is a global commons problem, one that is fundamentally defined by the problem of fair use. GDRs, by transparently calculating principle-based obligations to protect the global climate system, sets out a framework by which fair-shares emissions rights can be defined, calculated, understood, debated, and negotiated. As such, it lays out a framework by which actually existing climate treaties and strategies – even “bottom up pledges” like those welcomed by the Copenhagen Accord – can be transparently evaluated and compared.\n\nThe Greenhouse Development Rights framework was developed and modeled by Paul Baer, Tom Athanasiou of EcoEquity, Sivan Kartha and Eric Kemp-Benedict of the Stockholm Environment Institute.\nGDRs evolved from per-capita frameworks that conceive of fair-shares global effort-sharing in terms of equal rights to emit greenhouse gases. The most well known of these is the proposal of Anil Agarwal and Sunita Narain (1991). The GDRs authors group felt that the per-capita emission rights approach lacked a systematic treatment of “national circumstances,” and attempted to solve this problem with a “Per-capita Plus” approach. They eventually concluded that, despite the obvious importance of the per-capita principle, it is not a viable foundation for a robust approach to a fair climate regime, not, at least, in a world where most all the “atmospheric space” has already been consumed. The Per-capita Plus approach was eventually abandoned in favor of GDRs (which is based not on per-capita rights but rather the UNFCCC principles of responsibility and capacity).\nGDRs debuted at a side event at the Tenth Conference of Parties (COP10) in Argentina in December 2004, with a paper and presentation entitled \"Cutting the Gordian Knot\". The final, reworked version of this paper was published on April 15, 2005, under the title Cutting the Knot: Climate Protection, Political Realism, and Equity as Requirements of a Post-Kyoto Regime. The first edition of the GDRs book and model were published in 2007 by the Heinrich Böll Foundation, and was presented at COP-13 in Bali. The GDRs second edition book and model were released at COP 14 in Poznan. The GDRs framework continues to evolve. It can best be tracked at the project website.\n\nAs a first step, GDRs codifies the right to development as a \"development threshold\" − a level of welfare below which people are not expected to share the costs of the climate transition. It’s important to note that this threshold is not an extreme poverty line, which is typically defined to be so low ($1 or $2 a day) as to be more properly called a “destitution line.” Rather, it is set to be above the global poverty line (about $16 per person per day, in Purchasing Power Parity terms ), and to reflect a level of welfare that is beyond basic needs, but still well short of today’s levels of affluent consumption.\nThe level where a development threshold would best be set is a matter for debate. In the GDRs standard case, it is set to be modestly (25%) above the global poverty line, at about $20 per person per day ($7,500 per year). This figure reflects an empirical analysis of the income levels at which the classic plagues of poverty – malnutrition, high infant mortality, low educational attainment, high relative food expenditures – begin to disappear, or at least become exceptions to the rule. It also reflects the level at which the southern “middle class” begins to emerge.\n\nHardship, of course, persists at incomes above $7,500 per year, and a higher development threshold (and thus a more progressive effort-sharing function) can be strongly defended. But, for introductory purposes, the GDRs standard case takes people whose incomes are above $20 per day – be they lower middle-class or middle-class or wealthy – to have “developed,” in the most basic meaningful sense of the term. Poorer people, as they struggle for better lives, are taken to have little responsibility for the climate problem (the approximately 70 percent of humanity that lives below the development threshold is responsible for only about 15 percent of all cumulative emissions) and precious little capacity to invest in solving it.\nRicher people are taken as having realized their right to development and as bearing the responsibility to preserve that right for others. As their incomes rise, they assume a greater faction of the costs of curbing the emissions associated with their own consumption, as well as the costs of ensuring that, as those who still live below the threshold rise toward and then above it, they are able to do so along sustainable, low-emission paths. Moreover, and critically, these obligations are taken to belong to all those above the development threshold, whether they happen to live in the North or in the South.\n\nBased on the global development threshold, and national emissions history and income distribution data, it is possible to calculate any country’s \"responsibility\" and \"capacity\".\n\nThese measures of responsibility and capacity can be combined (by averaging, in the GDRs standard case) to determine a country’s obligation for shouldering the climate challenge, which is represented as a Responsibility and Capacity Index (RCI). This calculation is done for all countries. The precise numerical results depend, of course, on the particular values chosen for key parameters, such as the development threshold and the responsibility start date.\n\nIn the 2010 standard case, the United States, with its exceptionally large population of individuals with incomes above the $7,500 development threshold (capacity) and the world’s largest share of cumulative emissions since 1990 (responsibility), has the largest single share (32 percent) of global RCI. The EU follows with 25 percent of the global RCI. China, despite being relatively poor, is home to a significant number of people still living above the development threshold, and has a notable 6.6 percent share of global RCI, which puts it close behind Japan with its 7.4 percent. India is also large but far poorer, placing it far behind with a 0.8 percent share.\n\nGDRs is a reference framework. Its principal goal is to demonstrate the fair allocation of the effort (or \"burden”) of managing the global climate transition among nations. In mitigation terms, the size of this effort can be expressed as an increasingly wide wedge (measured in tons) that defines a “mitigation gap” between a business-as-usual emissions trajectory and an “emergency pathway” that is defined in scientific terms (see the 2 °C Emergency Pathway shown in Figure 2).\n\nNational reduction obligations in any year are defined as shares of the global mitigation gap, which is allocated among countries in proportion to their RCI. The US, for example (see Figure 2) is projected to have a 2020 reduction obligation equal to 29.1% of the roughly 4 Gigatonnes of carbon mitigation that will then be needed. In general, each country is given an emission target equal to its reference trajectory minus its proportional share of the global mitigation gap. Distributing the global mitigation gap in this way yields some striking results. For one thing, it clearly shows that a major commitment to North-South cooperation – including financial and technological transfers – is an inevitable part of any viable global climate stabilization architecture. This is because the national mitigation obligations of the high-RCI countries of the North vastly exceed the reductions they could conceivably make at home. In fact, by 2030, northern mitigation obligations typically come to exceed even their total domestic emissions. Which is to say that wealthier and higher emitting countries would receive “negative allocations,” as is necessary in order to open enough atmospheric space for the developing world. This kind of negative allocation can never arise under frameworks that seek to allocate “emission rights.”\n\nInstitutionally, there are many ways that a system like GDRs could be implemented. For example, an international fund could be used to support both mitigation and adaptation. In this case, the RCI would serve as the basis for determining each nation’s expected financial contribution to that fund. More generally, it’s useful to think about the RCI as, in effect, the basis of a progressive global “climate tax” – not a carbon tax, per se (carbon taxes are, all else being equal, regressive) but a \"responsibility\" and \"capacity\" tax. Alternatively, GDRs could be implemented by way of global emissions markets. In this case, national RCIs would be used to calculate allocations, in tons, and these would then be traded to generate the international financial flows necessary to support a fair global climate regime.\n\nThe real issue here is that the scale and nature of the financial and technological cooperation demanded by the climate crisis is unprecedented, and will inevitably involve the expansion and reform of existing institutions, as well as the creation of entirely new ones. Any number of devices might be useful: progressive taxes of various kinds, trade-related levies, auctions, rebates, sectoral agreements, multilateral funds, international property-rights concessions, and so on. Beyond these, new and as-yet unnamed channels for both international resource transfer and accounting will need to be conceived and implemented, inevitably posing an impressive set of challenges: How to scale up rapidly? How to build absorptive and distributional capacity? How to ensure efficiency and avoid waste? How to institute credible and democratic governance?\n\nWhatever the eventual utility of frameworks like GDRs, no principle-based effort-sharing system that would impose binding commitments on developing countries is likely to be adopted anytime soon. As long as developing countries are still lack convincing evidence that poverty eradication and human development can be attained simultaneously with decarbonization, binding commitments will appear too them as being too great a risk.\n\nA transition to principle-based effort-sharing would require industrialized countries to embrace their commitment under the UNFCCC to “take the lead in combating climate change and the adverse effects thereof”, and in so doing convincingly demonstrate the existence of an alternative develop path. A trust-building and momentum-building period (lasting, say, to 2020) during which the industrialized countries prove the technical and political possibility of climate-friendly development would open up the possibility of a global regime based on principle-based effort-sharing.\n\nWhile the GDRs approach promotes a responsibility and capacity based effort-sharing regime, there are other approaches that aim to define fairness differently using different means.\n\n\n"}

The commandment is generally regarded in Protestant and Jewish sources as the fifth in both the list in Exodus 20:1–21, and in Deuteronomy (Dvarim) 5:1–23. Catholics count this as the fourth.\n\nThese commandments were enforced as law in many jurisdictions, and are still considered enforceable law by some. Exodus 20, 1 describes the Ten Commandments as being spoken by God, inscribed on two stone tablets by the finger of God, broken by Moses, and rewritten on replacement stones by the Lord.\n\nIn the Torah, keeping this commandment was associated with individual benefit and with the ability of the nation of Israel to remain in the land to which God was leading them. Dishonouring parents by striking or cursing them was punishable by death and so the clause \"so that you may live long\" could be interpreted as \"so that you are not put to death\". In the Talmud, the commandment to honour one's human parents is compared to honoring God. According to the prophet Malachi, God makes the analogy himself:\nThe commandment to honour one's human parents is compared to honouring God, for human owes his existence to his father and his mother.\n\nThe Talmud says that since there are three partners in the creation of a person (God and two parents), honour showed to parents is the same as honour shown to God. It also compares a number of similarly constructed passages from the Torah and concludes that honour toward parents and honour toward God are intentionally equated:\nBecause honouring parents is part of honouring God, the mitzvah does not depend on the worthiness of the parent:\"Even if his father is wicked and a sinner, he must fear and revere him ... A convert to Judaism must not curse or despise his non-Jewish father.\" (Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 143:13,25)\n\nIt also requires honour to one's stepparents or an older sibling who is raising one, and one's teachers, though one has a greater obligation to honor a parent than a grandparent.\n\nThe commandment is repeated eight times throughout the bible.\n\nKeeping this commandment was associated by the Israelites with the ability of the nation of Israel to remain in the land to which God was leading them. According to the Torah, striking or cursing one’s father or mother was punishable by immediate death. In Deuteronomy, a procedure is described for parents to bring a persistently disobedient son to the city elders for death by stoning.\n\nHonouring one's parents is also described in the Torah as an analogue to honouring God. According to the prophet Jeremiah, God refers to himself as Father to Israel, and according to the prophet Isaiah, God refers to Israel as his sons and daughters. According to the prophet Malachi, God calls for similar honour.\n\nAccording to Jeremiah, God blessed the descendants of Rechab for obeying their forefather's command to not drink wine and uses the family as a counterexample to Israel's failure to obey his command to not worship other gods: \n\nAccording to the Mishneh Torah this commandment requires one to honour both of one's parents equally; there is no greater weight given to either the father or the mother. While in some parts of scripture, father is stated first, in others, mother comes first. This shows that the honour due to each is equal.\n\nWhile Jewish teaching holds that a married woman must honour her husband, there are also guidelines for how she may continue to honour her parents:\nThe commandment requires one to obey one's parents when the command given by a parent is reasonable and permissible under Jewish law. For example, if a parent asks a child to bring him/her water, he/she must obey. Because honouring God is above all mitzvot, if a parent asks a child to break a law of the Torah, s/he must refuse to obey.\n\nA child is not required to obey if a parent says that s/he must marry a particular person, or must not marry a person s/he wishes to marry, provided the marriage is permissible by Jewish law.\n\nA child who is travelling has an obligation to communicate with his/her parents to let them know s/he is safe in order to prevent them from worrying.\n\nA child must continue to honour his/her parent after their deaths. This can be done by reciting kaddish for 11 months and on the yarzeit (anniversary of the parent's death), and by donating charity in the memory of the parent. The study of Torah is also considered to be reverence toward a parent, for it shows that a parent raised a worthy child.\n\nA child must never put a parent to shame, or speak arrogantly to a parent. A person who is told to do something by his/her mother for which his father does not like the result is not permitted to tell his/her father that his/her mother said to do that. This is because this could lead to his/her father cursing his/her mother. A child is not permitted to interrupt or contradict a parent, or to disturb a parent's sleep.\n\nIn the gospels, Jesus affirmed the importance of honouring one's father and mother (Matthew 15:1–9, Matthew 19:17–19, Mark 10:17–19, Luke 18:18–21) Paul quotes the commandment in his letter to the church in Ephesus:\nIn his letters to the Romans and Timothy, Paul describes disobedience to parents as a serious sin (Romans 1:29–31, 2 Timothy 3:2).\n\nThe words of Jesus and the teaching of Paul indicate that adult children remain obligated to honour their parents by providing for material needs. In the gospels, Jesus is portrayed as angry with some people who avoided materially providing for their parents by claiming the money they would have used was given to God (Matthew 15:3–8, Mark 7:9–12. In these passages, Jesus quotes Isaiah 29:13) According to the Gospel of John, when Jesus was on the cross, he provided for his natural mother by giving the Apostle John the charge to care for her, which John accepted.\n\nAccording to the gospel of Matthew, the obligation to honour one's parents is bounded by one's obligation to God: \"Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me.\" (Matthew 10:37 ESV) Such boundaries, and the primacy of the first commandment itself, lead scholars to conclude that honouring one's parents does \"not\" include breaking God's law (i.e., committing a sin) at the behest of a parent.\n\nPaul's instructions to Timothy regarding the physical care of widows include the following:\n\nThe import of honouring father and mother is based on the divine origin of the parental role:\nAccording to the teachings of the Catholic Church, the commandment to honour father and mother reveals God's desired order of charity – first God, then parents, then others. Keeping the commandment to honour father and mother brings both spiritual and temporal rewards of peace and prosperity, while failure to honor parents harms the individual as well as society. The pervasive societal effect of obedience or disobedience to this command is attributed to the status of the family as the fundamental building block of society:\nThe Gospel of Luke notes that, as a child, Jesus was obedient to his earthly parents. For a child in the home, the commandment to honour parents is comprehensive, excluding immoral actions. Grown children, while not obligated to obedience in the same way, should continue to afford respect for parental wishes, advice and teaching. \"Filial respect is shown by true docility and obedience. 'My son, keep your father's commandment, and forsake not your mother's teaching. ... When you walk, they will lead you; when you lie down, they will watch over you...'\" (Proverbs 6:20–22)\n\nThe Church teaches that adult children have a duty to honour their parents by providing \"material and moral support in old age and in times of illness, loneliness, or distress\". This honour should be based on the son or daughter's gratitude for the life, love and effort given by the parents and motivated by the desire to pay them back in some measure.\n\nThe principle of the commandment is extended to the duty to honour others in direct authority, such as teachers, and employers. The commandment to honour father and mother also forms a basis for charity to others when each person is seen, ultimately, as \"a son or daughter of the One who wants to be called 'our Father'.\" Thus, charitable actions are viewed as extensions of the honour owed to the heavenly Father.\n\nFather Seraphim Stephens sees \"Honor\" defined as \"Love and Respect\", and notes that this commandment is positioned between those that address one's obligations to God and those that relate to how one treats others. \"It clearly lays the foundation of our relationship to God and to all other people.\" Richard D. Andrews points out that, \"Every time we do something good, just, pure, holy, we bring honor to our parents.\"\n\nJohn Calvin describes the sacred origin of the role of human father (which thus demands honour). The analogy between the honour of parents and the honour of God himself is further strengthened by this understanding that earthly fatherhood is derived from God's Fatherhood. Thus the duty to honour does not depend on whether the parent is particularly worthy. However, Calvin acknowledges that some fathers are outright wicked and emphasizes there is no excuse for sin in the name of honouring a parent, calling the notion \"absurd\".\n\nThe commentary of John Wesley on the commandment to honour father and mother is consistent with the interpretation in the Catechism of the Catholic Church. He summarizes the actions that express honour as follows: 1. An inward esteem of them, outwardly expressed, 2. Obedience to their lawful commands (Ephesians 6:1–3), 3. Submission to their rebukes, instructions and corrections, 4. Acting with consideration of parental advice, direction and consent, 5. Giving comfort and providing for physical needs of aged parents. Like the Catechism, Wesley also teaches that the commandment includes honouring others in legitimate secular authority. He also encourages people toward honour of those in spiritual leadership with the question, \"Have ye all obeyed them that watch over your souls, and esteemed them highly in love for their work's sake?\" This question is reminiscent of Paul's statements to the church in Galatia and to Timothy.\n\nMatthew Henry explains that the commandment to honour father and mother applies not only to biological parents but also to those who fulfill the role of mother or father. He uses the example of Esther honouring her guardian and cousin Mordecai:\n\nThe commandment itself encourages obedience \"so that you may enjoy long life and that it may go well with you\". Henry, Wesley and Calvin affirm the applicability of this promise for all who keep the commandment, though each notes that for the New Testament Christian, the promise may be fulfilled as earthly rewards and/or heavenly rewards, as God sees fit in his wisdom and love for the individual.\n\nIn his commentary, Calvin notes the harsh consequences required in Exodus and Leviticus for specific failures to keep the commandment. Those who struck or cursed a parent were to be sentenced to death. Persistently disobedient sons were to be brought before the city elders and stoned by the whole community if the parents' testimony was judged to be accurate. Calvin writes that God knew capital punishment for these offences would seem harsh and be difficult to pronounce, even for those responsible for adjudicating the situation. This is why, he argues, the text specifically places responsibility for the consequences on the offender. The severity of the sentence emphasized the importance of removing such behaviour from the community and deterring others who might imitate it.\n\nAlthough Calvin refers mostly to fathers in his commentary on the commandment to honour father and mother, he writes near the beginning that the commandment mentions both parents on purpose. As described above, Proverbs supports the value of guidance from both father and mother, and Paul specified that children should provide for their own widowed mothers and grandmothers, “which is pleasing to God.”\n\nJust as \"honor\" involves offering profound respect, the opposite of honoring someone is to trivialize him, as if of no importance. \n\nRespect is not something based solely on personal or professional qualifications, but also on the position that God has given that person. In 1 Samuel 26 David spares Saul’s life, even at the risk of losing his own, submitting to the authority God had placed over him as anointed king.\n\nThis commandment is distinct from the others in that a promise is attached to it: \"...so that you may live long in the land the Lord your God is giving you.\" Deuteronomy 5:16 amplifies this: \"...that your days may be prolonged, and that it may be well with you, in the land which the Lord your God is giving you.\"\nAs with most terms of the covenant between God and Israel, there are consequences for disobedience as well as rewards for obedience:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "41403846", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41403846", "title": "Indigenous American philosophy", "text": "Indigenous American philosophy\n\nIndigenous American philosophy is the philosophy of the Indigenous people of the Americas.\n\nAn indigenous philosopher is an indigenous person or associate who practices philosophy and has a vast knowledge of various indigenous history, culture, language, and traditions. There are very few contemporary indigenous philosophers alive today.\n\nEpistemology refers to the study of knowledge, the ways in which a person acquires and processes information. Among Indigenous cultures, epistemology is understood differently and more inherently than how it is understood in Western philosophy. Native American epistemology is found primarily in theories, philosophies, histories, ceremonies and nature as multiple ways of knowing. Emphasis is put on the importance of language as one of the vital components of Native American epistemology. It is through the unique symbolism and the close connection with nature, that Native Americans consider knowledge to be acquired. In relation to consciousness, rationality and other heavily studied psychological states, the inherent structure of the complex Native American language is necessary to understand in the obtainment of indigenous knowledge. There is also a strong link between nature and the interpretation of knowledge within Native American culture. It is believed that the mind interacts with the environment in a very active, conscious way. The process through which they interact with nature is through the necessary need for survival but also through a deep respect and understanding the land as a huge part of their identity. It is vital to understand how to gather medicine, predict weather conditions so as to effectively produce food, and how to navigate through the land in order to grow and thrive as part of an ecological dependent community. Native American knowledge is continuously adapting to the changing environment as the ecosystem evolves and this is how epistemology is understood to have such a strong root to nature.\n\nNative American science and understanding is said to have a basis in perceptual phenomenology, meaning the philosophical study of phenomena. In this context, phenomenology refers to the examination of ones experiences to come to a personal world view. Something is believed to be true when it has been verified by experiences and provides explanations which assist in completing tasks.This worldview is dynamic as new experiences alter this worldview and add to it. There is no belief in a universal worldview which could explain all aspects of reality for a permanent set of time.\n\nThe world is viewed as infinitely complex and so it is impossible to come to a universal understanding of it. Therefore, Native Americans believe that useful knowledge can only be acquired through individual experience which, whilst subjective, is valid to that space and time. The method of interacting with the environment is never made fixed and instead, is carried through generations who continuously revise it and add to it. This creates a web of knowledge shaped by the individual experiences of a community.\n\nThe subjectivity of experience and circumstance means that each Indigenous community's beliefs will be distinct. Indigenous people believe that experience can always present a better way of interacting with the environment. As a result of this understanding, no belief is viewed as being supremely valid when compared to another belief. A belief receives its validity from experience.Regardless of whether an experience is ordinary and extraordinary, they are both viewed the same and are equally useful for gathering knowledge. Everything is viewed as possible in the world as no universal laws are seen to govern how the world exists. Each person in their own environment and circumstance can derive their own beliefs which is completely valid and logical in their personal circumstance.\n\nBrian Yazzie Burkhart, a Cherokee, has described his experience of the story of Coyote:\n\nEventually, the entire land is flooded. Coyote's mistake is not letting what is right guide his actions, but instead acting entirely on his own motivations. This is a reminder that one must be careful about what one desires, and must keep in mind the things around us and how we relate to them. Burkhart terms this the principle of relatedness:\n\nAnne Waters has described a \"nondiscreet ontology of being\" in the context of gender. With a different attitude towards labels, Waters argues that American Indian viewpoints are more tolerant to those that don't fit into a strict binary gender framework.\n\nThe canon of Western philosophy (WP) is rooted in the Platonic understanding of truth (the form of the truth) being stable immutable and present, upon which philosophical investigations take place. On the other hand, Native American philosophy (NAP) holds that the stability for the basis of such inquiry in the native world is found not in absolutes, rather the consistencies in a complexity of the world. This concept of an absolute simplified starting point against finding similarities in a complex matrix is highlighted in particular in the different ways notes how NAP and WP analyse space and time. Typical WP views the world in sections: the universe is views as created ex nihilo (implying it had a definitive beginning and most likely with have a definitive end) and is depicted as violent (e.g. 'the big bang'). Moreover, time is broken up into 3 simple sections that all acts can fit within: past, present and future, all of which have definable boundaries that actions in reality can go up to and occasional cross. Conversely, Cordova notes that NAP views space as being a concept that connects everything to our global environment and time as an endless continuous motion. The universe is considered as infinite and unbound; being in constant motion with no beginning or end and is balanced and stable despite occasional \"temporary sadness.\" Similarly, time does not belong to an absolute and bounded category in NAP, it is not a self-existing thing independent of human acknowledgement. Time is not even another dimension - it is nothing more than a human construct. Instead, it is, \"merely a measure of motion ... the sun, stars, and moon through the sky, of changes that are visible and can be predicted.\"\n"}

His father owned a shop in Zapadnaya Dvina.\n\nPrezent went to high school in Dukhovshschina, and after completing it in 1919, he returned to Zapadnaya Dvina to teach in a local railway school. He became a communist activist while still in high school. Parallel with being a teacher in Zapadnaya Dvina, he helped found a local branch of Komsomol, and was finally accepted as a party member in 1921. Later that year he moved to Pskov to assume a gubernatorial-level party function. Following a party decision, he enrolled at Leningrad State University (LGU) in 1922. He temporarily left university in 1923 to take part in the late stages of the Civil War as a political instructor. He soon resumed his studies, and graduated from Faculty of Social Sciences of LGU in 1926. As a recognition for his work on biology, he was awarded a doctorate in biological sciences in 1936.\n\nAfter graduating, Prezent worked on achieving transition from social sciences to biology by acquainting himself to some of the lead Soviet biologists of the time, including geneticist Nikolai Vavilov. Prezent even briefly worked for Vavilov at the Institute of Plant Industry. However, the two would later become major adversaries, once Prezent joined Lysenko and denounced genetics.\n\nAfter leaving Vavilov, Prezent started teaching at Herzen Pedagogical Institute, where he quickly rose through the academic ranks and became a docent within a couple of years. At the same time, he was active in the Scientific Society of Marxists (NOM, initialism for Nauchno obshchestvo marksistov). There he co-headed the group focused on biology. In 1930, NOM was merged into the Communist Academy, and in that or following year Prezent assumed a position of the head of biology sector of the natural science section of the Leningrad branch of Communist Academy. In 1931, he started teaching dialectics of nature and evolutionary studies at LGU, parallel with his activities in the Communist Academy. In this early part of his career, Prezent was mostly focused on ecology.\n\nHowever, from 1932 on, many of the academic Marxist societies were shut down, after the proponents of \"cultural revolution\" fell out of favor with the regime. In 1934, Prezent had to leave university, and he moved to Odessa, where he worked with Trofim Lysenko at All-Union Institute of Selection and Genetics until 1938. The alliance with Lysenko proved extremely useful for both men, as Lysenko got a politically-savvy mentor in Prezent, while Prezent managed to return to political grace by associating himself with Lysenko and changing his views on biology and genetics in the process. From 1935 to 1941, Prezent was a deputy editor-in-chief of journal \"Yarovizaciya\" (Russian: \"Яровизация\", meaning Vernalization). In 1939, he became Lysenko's consultant for philosophical issues at Lenin All-Union Academy of Agricultural Science (VASKhNIL) in Moscow, where he became a full member in 1948. From 1943 until 1951, Prezent held a chair of Darwinism and History of Biology at LGU, while for the final three years of that period (1948-1951) simultaneously being the dean of the Faculty of Biology of Moscow State University (MGU).\n\nIn 1951, Prezent was made to leave both university positions due to concerns about his capacity to teach biology. He returned to VASKhNIL, where he stayed until the beginning of 1969, when he was dismissed due to his association with Lysenkoism.\n\nDuring the early 1930s, Prezent established himself as a critic of the leading Soviet ecologists of the time, and especially of the sub-field of biocenology as such. His attack on biocenologists had three directions: attack on the botanically-oriented ecologists, attack on then-most prominent Soviet educator in the field Boris Yevgenyevich Raikov, and finally attack on zoology-focused ecologists.\n\nPrezent's attack on plant ecologists occurred in February 1931. As a representative of Leningrad branch of Communist Academy, he had a role in the organization of the First All-Union Conference of Geobotanists and Floristics Experts. The conference was sponsored by the Botanical Institute, but Prezent nonetheless managed to overtake \"methodological leadership\" and put forward his agenda against biocenological botanists.\n\nBoris Raikov was Prezent's former colleague from Herzen Institute, and as of 1930 he was already under attacks from the organization of young naturalists. Prezent objected to Raikov's conservationist views. He considered conservationism a \"wrecking theory\", holding that it opposed the Stalinist views on progress, understood here as a triumph of working men and their technology. Proponents of conservationism, such as Raikov, were therefore considered by Prezent to be \"agents of the world bourgeoisie\". In 1932, one of the Prezent's anti-Raikov speeches, titled \"Class Struggle on the Natural Science Front\" was published in 20,000 copies, which marked the demise of conservationism in ecological education. Raikov and his associates were arrested or exiled. Raikov himself spent the World War II teaching in Arkhangelsk.\n\nThe attack on zoologists started early, during the Fourth All-Union Congress of Zoologists, Anatomists, and Histologists in Kiev in May 1930, where Prezent first made his criticism of biocenology public in an exchange with the prominent zoologist Vladimir Vladimirovich Stanchinskiy. Similarly to the tactics he employed in fighting the botanists, Prezent waited until the December 1931 All-Union Faunistics Conference, and navigated its organization into silencing and attacking conservationsim.\n\nPrezent first met Lysenko at the Congress of Geneticists and Breeders in 1929, but it was not until 1934 that they started closely cooperating in Lysenko's lab in Odessa. By that time, Lysenko was already following Michurin's version of Lamarckism, but he was not yet associating his work in the field of genetics with any political positions. However, after 1934, Prezent began introducing Lysenko to Marxist theory and party politics, which led to increasingly political tone of Lysenko's pronouncements, as well as to both Lysenko and Prezent denouncing Mendelian genetics. Prezent's influence on Lysenko was not limited to the philosophical and political aspects of the latter's work. Despite Prezent's lack of formal education in biology, he was one of Lysenko's main sources of information on Darwinism.\n\nLysenko eventually produced a pseudo-scientific synthesis of Michurin's evolutionary biology, Prezent's philosophy of science, and Stalinist political theory that came to be known as Lysenkoism. Lysenko's teachings were based on his concept of \"natural cooperation\", as opposed to Darwin's idea of natural selection that he rejected. According to Lysenko, not only that the acquired characteristics of organisms were inheritable, but it was even possible for organisms of one species to transform into another species by acquiring appropriate characteristics over the course of their lives. The proponents of Lysenkoism advocated for the use of these \"findings\" in agriculture in order to increase yields, and alleviate the consequences of the Soviet famine of 1932-33.\n\nWhile many of Lysenko's views on agriculture, as well as his prominence, predated his cooperation with Prezent, it was only after 1934 that his debate with the mainstream geneticists became politicized. In that period, and with the full support of Stalin, many of the Soviet geneticists were purged or at least fired. In 1935 and 1936 Lysenko and Prezent brought the debates over genetics to the center of party politics. In those two years, the so-called \"Academy Sessions\" took place. It was a series of scientific debates chaired by Stalin himself, where Lysenko and Prezent counterposed their views to those of mainstream geneticists. The entire time, Prezent was extremely active in presenting Lysenko's works publicly as acts of genius. The full triumph came during a conference in 1948, when Lysenko announced genetics to be a bourgeois pseudoscience, and that the Central Committee supported such stance. After this, any serious engagement with non-Lysenkoist genetics became impossible in the Soviet union until 1964, especially at Lysenko-headed VASKhNIL, and Prezent-headed MGU Department of Darwinism.\n\nIsaak Prezent died of cancer on January 6, 1969 in Moscow. It was only several days after being dismissed from VASKhNIL.\n\nIn 1943, Prezent was awarded Order of the Red Banner of Labour.\n\n"}

In 1938, after the Anschluss he had to abandon his studies, and went to the United Kingdom as a refugee, where he was interned as a \"friendly enemy alien\" and sent to Australia on the \"Dunera\". There he began studying philosophy. Baier received his B.A. from the University of Melbourne in 1944, and his M.A. in 1947. In 1952, he received his DPhil at Oxford University.\n\nBaier taught at the University of Melbourne and the Australian National University. He met and married Annette Baier in 1958. He joined the faculty of the University of Pittsburgh in 1961, and became Chair of the Department in 1967, and remained at Pitt until his retirement in 1996. He became president of the Eastern Division and chair of the National Board of Officers of the American Philosophical Association, Both Baiers gave the Paul Carus lectures. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1974. In 2001, Kurt was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Jurisprudence from the Karl Franzen University of Graz. He was also honored by the Humanist Society.\n\nBaier died at his home in Dunedin, New Zealand.\n\nBeginning with his first and best known book, \"The Moral Point of View\" (1958), Baier has been attempting to construct a justification of morality that is grounded in rationality. His original strategy was to find certain nonquestion-begging requirements of practical reason that then could be shown to favor morality over egoism. According to Baier, the very raison d'être of a morality is to yield reasons that overrule the reasons of self-interest in those cases when everyone following their own self-interest would be harmful to everyone. If we appeal to self-interested reasons to be moral, it would seem that such reasons cannot support morality over self-interest in cases of conflict. On the other hand, if we appeal to non-self-interested reasons to justify morality, those reasons seem to be implicitly moral, and so this would just be begging the question against egoistic opponents of morality. While making many contributions to the conceptual analysis of basic concepts in moral, political and legal philosophy such as those of obligation, responsibility, reason for action, egoism and the meaning of life, and also to applied ethics. Baier has struggled with the fundamental question of how to justify morality throughout his career. He inspired many other philosophers to do so as well.\n\nIn \"The Rational and the Moral Order\" (1995), Baier attempted to answer the question by interpreting morality as a system of reasons of mutual benefit that are appropriate for contexts in which everyone's following self-interested reasons would have suboptimal results for everyone. So interpreted, moral reasons apply only when there exists an adequate enforcement system that makes acting against those reasons unprofitable. Morality so construed never requires any degree of altruism or self-sacrifice; it only requires that people act upon reasons of mutual benefit. Given this interpretation of morality, it is not possible for the egoist to do better by acting against morality. So construed, morality and egoism do not really conflict. This solution to the problem of the justification of morality bears some resemblance to the one offered by David Gauthier in \"Morals By Agreement\" (1986), a philosopher who was also inspired by Baier’s work and who later joined Baier as a colleague at the University of Pittsburgh in 1980.\n\n"}

Beginning as a tool that helped standardize communication between writers and editors at a government laboratory, published information about levels of edit was later made available to the general public. Subsequently, others developed a variety of levels of edit, which are now accessible through print and web-based resources.\n\nVan Buren and Buehler of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) developed five levels of edit defined by nine editorial categories.\nIn 1976, JPL first published Van Buren and Buehler's work as The Levels of Edit. JPL published a second edition in 1980, and the United States Government Printing Office (GPO) sold copies of the book to the general public. After the GPO’s supply of the second edition was depleted, the Society for Technical Communication (STC) made available a facsimile reprint of the second edition.\n\nDrawing on Van Buren and Buehler’s work, in 1985 the writing and editing group at the Los Alamos National Laboratory established four levels of edit for technical reports. A team at the laboratory revised the work following a 1994 survey that indicated the original four levels no longer met authors’ needs. The Los Alamos revision presented three “author-based” levels of edit (proofreading edit, grammar edit, and full edit) whose goals were to “simplify the editing process, focus editing on improving technical clarity, and ensure that value was added in editing.”\n\nMore recently, Rude reduced the levels to just two types: 1) comprehensive editing and 2) copyediting. \n\nSeveral chapters in New Perspectives on Technical Editing, edited by Avon J. Murphy, include discussions of the different types of edits.\n\nOther researchers built schemes based on editing rules, tasks, and analyses. For example, Tarutz defined a hierarchy of levels that Corbin and Oestreich referred to in their presentation at the 2011 STC Summit as “informal,” as follows.\n\nTo bring a quality assurance perspective to technical editing, Corbin and others mapped types of edit to types of testing, for example, “system testing to comprehensive editing” and “function testing to copyediting” (p. 290).\n\nAs web-based on-demand proofreading and editing services have become increasingly available, the number of edit levels and editing schemes has increased in variety. For example, three cumulative levels is a common scheme, typically 1) light, 2) medium, and 3) heavy editing, although another three-level scheme appears frequently across websites: 1) proofreading and 2) light and 3) heavy editing. Four levels usually differs from a three-level scheme only by the inclusion of a mid-range level, such as 1) basic proofreading and 2) light, 3) medium, and 4) heavy editing. No matter the scheme, a level of edit defined as heavy often results in a complete rewrite. And one web-based service offers six levels of edit according to a partially cumulative scheme:\nBased on the function of the edit and the working unit to which it applies, eight levels of edit are also presented, as follows.\n\nCoggin, W.

{"id": "6793630", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6793630", "title": "Maria Montessori", "text": "Maria Montessori\n\nMaria Tecla Artemisia Montessori (; August 31, 1870 – May 6, 1952) was an Italian physician and educator best known for the philosophy of education that bears her name, and her writing on scientific pedagogy. At an early age, Montessori broke gender barriers and expectations when she enrolled in classes at an all-boys technical school, with hopes of becoming an engineer. She soon had a change of heart and began medical school at the University of Rome, where she graduated – with honors – in 1896. Her educational method is in use today in many public and private schools throughout the world.\n\nMontessori was born on August 31, 1870 in Chiaravalle, Italy. Her father, Alessandro Montessori, 33 years old at the time, was an official of the Ministry of Finance working in the local state-run tobacco factory. Her mother, Renilde Stoppani, 25 years old, was well educated for the times and was the great-niece of Italian geologist and paleontologist Antonio Stoppani. While she did not have any particular mentor, she was very close to her mother who readily encouraged her. She also had a loving relationship with her father, although he disagreed with her choice to continue her education.\n\nThe Montessori family moved to Florence in 1873 and then to Rome in 1875 because of her father's work. Montessori entered a public elementary school at the age of 6 in 1876. Her early school record was \"not particularly noteworthy\", although she was awarded certificates for good behavior in the 1st grade and for \"lavori donneschi\", or \"women's work\", the next year.\n\nIn 1883 or 1884, at the age of 13, Montessori entered a secondary, technical school, Regia Scuola Tecnica Michelangelo Buonarroti, where she studied Italian, arithmetic, algebra, geometry, accounting, history, geography, and sciences. She graduated in 1886 with good grades and examination results. That year, at the age of 16, she continued at the technical institute Regio Istituto Tecnico Leonardo da Vinci, studying Italian, mathematics, history, geography, geometric and ornate drawing, physics, chemistry, botany, zoology, and two foreign languages. She did well in the sciences and especially in mathematics.\n\nShe initially intended to pursue the study of engineering upon graduation, an unusual aspiration for a woman in her time and place. However, by the time she graduated in 1890 at the age of 20, with a certificate in physics–mathematics, she had decided to study medicine instead, an even more unlikely pursuit given cultural norms at the time.\n\nMontessori moved forward with her intention to study medicine. She appealed to Guido Baccelli, the professor of clinical medicine at the University of Rome, but was strongly discouraged. Nonetheless, in 1890, she enrolled in the University of Rome in a degree course in natural sciences, passing examinations in botany, zoology, experimental physics, histology, anatomy, and general and organic chemistry, and earning her \"diploma di licenza\" in 1892. This degree, along with additional studies in Italian and Latin, qualified her for entrance into the medical program at the University in 1893.\n\nShe was met with hostility and harassment from some medical students and professors because of her gender. Because her attendance of classes with men in the presence of a naked body was deemed inappropriate, she was required to perform her dissections of cadavers alone, after hours. She resorted to smoking tobacco to mask the offensive odor of formaldehyde. Montessori won an academic prize in her first year, and in 1895 secured a position as a hospital assistant, gaining early clinical experience. In her last two years she studied pediatrics and psychiatry, and worked in the pediatric consulting room and emergency service, becoming an expert in pediatric medicine. Montessori graduated from the University of Rome in 1896 as a doctor of medicine. Her thesis was published in 1897 in the journal \"Policlinico\". She found employment as an assistant at the University hospital and started a private practice.)\n\nFrom 1896 to 1901, Montessori worked with and researched so-called \"phrenasthenic\" children—in modern terms, children experiencing some form of mental retardation, illness, or disability. She also began to travel, study, speak, and publish nationally and internationally, coming to prominence as an advocate for women's rights and education for mentally disabled children.\n\nOn 31 March 1898, her only child – a son named Mario Montessori (March 31, 1898 – 1982) was born. Mario Montessori was born out of her love affair with Giuseppe Montesano, a fellow doctor who was co-director with her of the Orthophrenic School of Rome. If Montessori married, she would be expected to cease working professionally; instead of getting married, Montessori decided to continue her work and studies. Montessori wanted to keep the relationship with her child's father secret under the condition that neither of them would marry anyone else. When the father of her child fell in love and subsequently married, Montessori was left feeling betrayed and decided to leave the university hospital and place her son into foster care with a family living in the countryside opting to miss the first few years of his life. She would later be reunited with her son in his teenage years, where he proved to be a great assistant in her research.\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Rome in 1896, Montessori continued with her research at the University's psychiatric clinic, and in 1897 she was accepted as a voluntary assistant there. As part of her work, she visited asylums in Rome where she observed children with mental disabilities, observations which were fundamental to her future educational work. She also read and studied the works of 19th-century physicians and educators Jean Marc Gaspard Itard and Édouard Séguin, who greatly influenced her work. Maria was intrigued by Itard's ideas and created a far more specific and organized system for applying them to the everyday education of children with disabilities. When she discovered the works of Jean Itard and Édouard Séguin they gave her a new direction in thinking and influenced her to focus on children with learning difficulties. Also in 1897, Montessori audited the University courses in pedagogy and read \"all the major works on educational theory of the past two hundred years\".\n\nIn 1897 Montessori spoke on societal responsibility for juvenile delinquency at the National Congress of Medicine in Turin. In 1898, she wrote several articles and spoke again at the First Pedagogical Conference of Turin, urging the creation of special classes and institutions for mentally disabled children, as well as teacher training for their instructors. In 1899 Montessori was appointed a councilor to the newly formed National League for the Protection of Retarded Children, and was invited to lecture on special methods of education for retarded children at the teacher training school of the College of Rome. That year Montessori undertook a two-week national lecture tour to capacity audiences before prominent public figures. She joined the board of the National League and was appointed as a lecturer in hygiene and anthropology at one of the two teacher-training colleges for women in Italy.\n\nIn 1900 the National League opened the \"Scuola Magistrale Ortofrenica\", or Orthophrenic School, a \"medico-pedagogical institute\" for training teachers in educating mentally disabled children with an attached laboratory classroom. Montessori was appointed co-director. 64 teachers enrolled in the first class, studying psychology, anatomy and physiology of the nervous system, anthropological measurements, causes and characteristics of mental disability, and special methods of instruction. During her two years at the school, Montessori developed methods and materials which she would later adapt to use with mainstream children.\n\nThe school was an immediate success, attracting the attention of government officials from the departments of education and health, civic leaders, and prominent figures in the fields of education, psychiatry, and anthropology from the University of Rome. The children in the model classroom were drawn from ordinary schools but considered \"uneducable\" due to their deficiencies. Some of these children later passed public examinations given to so-called \"normal\" children.\n\nIn 1901, Montessori left the Orthophrenic School and her private practice, and in 1902 she enrolled in the philosophy degree course at the University of Rome. (Philosophy at the time included much of what we now consider psychology.) She studied theoretical and moral philosophy, the history of philosophy, and psychology as such, but she did not graduate. She also pursued independent study in anthropology and educational philosophy, conducted observations and experimental research in elementary schools, and revisited the work of Itard and Séguin, translating their books into handwritten Italian. During this time she began to consider adapting her methods of educating mentally disabled children to mainstream education.\n\nMontessori's work developing what she would later call \"scientific pedagogy\" continued over the next few years. Still in 1902, Montessori presented a report at a second national pedagogical congress in Naples. She published two articles on pedagogy in 1903, and two more the following year. In 1903 and 1904, she conducted anthropological research with Italian schoolchildren, and in 1904 she was qualified as a free lecturer in anthropology for the University of Rome. She was appointed to lecture in the Pedagogic School at the University and continued in the position until 1908. Her lectures were printed as a book titled \"Pedagogical Anthropology\" in 1910.\n\nIn 1906 Montessori was invited to oversee the care and education of a group of children of working parents in a new apartment building for low-income families in the San Lorenzo district in Rome. Montessori was interested in applying her work and methods to mentally normal children, and she accepted. The name \"Casa dei Bambini\", or Children's House, was suggested to Montessori, and the first \"Casa\" opened on January 6, 1907, enrolling 50 or 60 children between the ages of two or three and six or seven.\n\nAt first, the classroom was equipped with a teacher's table and blackboard, a stove, small chairs, armchairs, and group tables for the children, and a locked cabinet for the materials that Montessori had developed at the Orthophrenic School. Activities for the children included personal care such as dressing and undressing, care of the environment such as dusting and sweeping, and caring for the garden. The children were also shown the use of the materials Montessori had developed. Montessori herself, occupied with teaching, research, and other professional activities, oversaw and observed the classroom work, but did not teach the children directly. Day-to-day teaching and care were provided, under Montessori's guidance, by the building porter's daughter.\n\nIn this first classroom, Montessori observed behaviors in these young children which formed the foundation of her educational method. She noted episodes of deep attention and concentration, multiple repetitions of activity, and a sensitivity to order in the environment. Given free choice of activity, the children showed more interest in practical activities and Montessori's materials than in toys provided for them, and were surprisingly unmotivated by sweets and other rewards. Over time, she saw a spontaneous self-discipline emerge.\n\nBased on her observations, Montessori implemented a number of practices that became hallmarks of her educational philosophy and method. She replaced the heavy furniture with child-sized tables and chairs light enough for the children to move, and placed child-sized materials on low, accessible shelves. She expanded the range of practical activities such as sweeping and personal care to include a wide variety of exercises for care of the environment and the self, including flower arranging, hand washing, gymnastics, care of pets, and cooking. She also included large open air sections in the classroom encouraging children to come and go as they please in the room's different areas and lessons. In her book she outlines a typical winter's day of lessons, starting at 09:00 AM and finishing at 04:00 PM:\n\n\nShe felt by working independently children could reach new levels of autonomy and become self-motivated to reach new levels of understanding. Montessori also came to believe that acknowledging all children as individuals and treating them as such would yield better learning and fulfilled potential in each particular child.\nShe continued to adapt and refine the materials she had developed earlier, altering or removing exercises which were chosen less frequently by the children. Also based on her observations, Montessori experimented with allowing children free choice of the materials, uninterrupted work, and freedom of movement and activity within the limits set by the environment. She began to see independence as the aim of education, and the role of the teacher as an observer and director of children's innate psychological development.\n\nThe first \"Casa dei Bambini\" was a success, and a second was opened on April 7, 1907. The children in her programs continued to exhibit concentration, attention, and spontaneous self-discipline, and the classrooms began to attract the attention of prominent educators, journalists, and public figures. In the fall of 1907, Montessori began to experiment with teaching materials for writing and reading—letters cut from sandpaper and mounted on boards, moveable cutout letters, and picture cards with labels. Four- and five-year-old children engaged spontaneously with the materials and quickly gained a proficiency in writing and reading far beyond what was expected for their age. This attracted further public attention to Montessori's work. Three more Case dei Bambini opened in 1908, and in 1909 Italian Switzerland began to replace Froebellian methods with Montessori in orphanages and kindergartens.\n\nIn 1909, Montessori held the first teacher training course in her new method in Città di Castello, Italy. In the same year, she described her observations and methods in a book titled \"Il Metodo della Pedagogia Scientifica Applicato All'Educazione Infantile Nelle Case Dei Bambini\" (\"The Method of Scientific Pedagogy Applied to the Education of Children in the Children's Houses\"). Two more training courses were held in Rome in 1910, and a third in Milan in 1911. Montessori's reputation and work began to spread internationally as well, and around that time she gave up her medical practice to devote more time to her educational work, developing her methods and training teachers. In 1919 she resigned from her position at the University of Rome, as her educational work was increasingly absorbing all her time and interest.\n\nAs early as 1909, Montessori's work began to attract the attention of international observers and visitors. Her work was widely published internationally, and spread rapidly. By the end of 1911, Montessori education had been officially adopted in public schools in Italy and Switzerland, and was planned for the United Kingdom. By 1912, Montessori schools had opened in Paris and many other Western European cities, and were planned for Argentina, Australia, China, India, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Switzerland, Syria, the United States, and New Zealand. Public programs in London, Johannesburg, Rome, and Stockholm had adopted the method in their school systems. Montessori societies were founded in the United States (the Montessori American Committee) and the United Kingdom (the Montessori Society for the United Kingdom). In 1913 the first International Training Course was held in Rome, with a second in 1914.\n\nMontessori's work was widely translated and published during this period. \"Il Metodo della Pedagogia Scientifica\" was published in the United States as \"The Montessori Method: Scientific Pedagogy as Applied to Child Education in the Children's Houses\", where it became a best seller. British and Swiss editions followed. A revised Italian edition was published in 1913. Russian and Polish editions came out in 1913 as well, and German, Japanese, and Romanian editions appeared in 1914, followed by Spanish (1915), Dutch (1916), and Danish (1917) editions. \"Pedagogical Anthropology\" was published in English in 1913. In 1914, Montessori published, in English, \"Doctor Montessori's Own Handbook\", a practical guide to the didactic materials she had developed.\n\nIn 1911 and 1912, Montessori's work was popular and widely publicized in the United States, especially in a series of articles in \"McClure's Magazine\", and the first North American Montessori school was opened in October 1911, in Tarrytown, New York. The inventor Alexander Graham Bell and his wife became proponents of the method and a second school was opened in their Canadian home. \"The Montessori Method\" sold quickly through six editions. The first International Training Course in Rome in 1913 was sponsored by the American Montessori Committee, and 67 of the 83 students were from the United States. By 1913 there were more than 100 Montessori schools in the country. Montessori traveled to the United States in December 1913 on a three-week lecture tour which included films of her European classrooms, meeting with large, enthusiastic crowds wherever she traveled.\n\nMontessori returned to the United States in 1915, sponsored by the National Education Association, to demonstrate her work at the Panama–Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco, California, and to give a third international training course. A glass-walled classroom was put up at the Exposition, and thousands of observers came to see a class of 21 students. Montessori's father died in November 1915, and she returned to Italy.\n\nAlthough Montessori and her educational approach were highly popular in the United States, she was not without opposition and controversy. Influential progressive educator William Heard Kilpatrick, a follower of American philosopher and educational reformer John Dewey, wrote a dismissive and critical book titled \"The Montessori Method Examined\", which had a broad impact. The National Kindergarten Association was critical as well. Critics charged that Montessori's method was outdated, overly rigid, overly reliant on sense-training, and left too little scope for imagination, social interaction, and play. In addition, Montessori's insistence on tight control over the elaboration of her method, the training of teachers, the production and use of materials, and the establishment of schools became a source of conflict and controversy. After she left in 1915, the Montessori movement in the United States fragmented, and Montessori education was a negligible factor in education in the United States until 1952.\n\nIn 1915, Montessori returned to Europe and took up residence in Barcelona, Spain. Over the next 20 years Montessori traveled and lectured widely in Europe and gave numerous teacher training courses. Montessori education experienced significant growth in Spain, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Italy.\n\nOn her return from the United States, Montessori continued her work in Barcelona, where a small program sponsored by the Catalan government begun in 1915 had developed into the Escola Montessori, serving children from three to ten years old, and the Laboratori i Seminari de Pedagogia, a research, training, and teaching institute. A fourth international course was given there in 1916, including materials and methods, developed over the previous five years, for teaching grammar, arithmetic, and geometry to elementary school children from six to twelve years of age. In 1917 Montessori published her elementary work in \"L'autoeducazionne nelle Scuole Elementari (Self-Education in Elementary School)\", which appeared in English as \"The Advanced Montessori Method\". Around 1920, the Catalan independence movement began to demand that Montessori take a political stand and make a public statement favoring Catalan independence, and she refused. Official support was withdrawn from her programs. In 1924, a new military dictatorship closed Montessori's model school in Barcelona, and Montessori education declined in Spain, although Barcelona remained Montessori's home for the next twelve years. In 1933, under the Second Spanish Republic, a new training course was sponsored by the government, and government support was re-established. In 1934, she published two books in Spain, \"Psicogeometrica\" and \"Psicoarithemetica\". However, with the onset of the Spanish Civil War in 1936, political and social conditions drove Montessori to leave Spain permanently.\n\nIn 1917, Montessori lectured in Amsterdam, and the Netherlands Montessori Society was founded. She returned in 1920 to give a series of lectures at the University of Amsterdam. Montessori programs flourished in the Netherlands, and by the mid-1930s there were more than 200 Montessori schools in the country. In 1935 the headquarters of the Association Montessori Internationale, or AMI, moved permanently to Amsterdam.\n\nMontessori education was met with enthusiasm and controversy in England between 1912 and 1914. In 1919, Montessori came to England for the first time and gave an international training course which was received with high interest. Montessori education continued to spread in the United Kingdom, although the movement experienced some of the struggles over authenticity and fragmentation that took place in the United States. Montessori continued to give training courses in England every other year until the beginning of World War II.\n\nIn 1922, Montessori was invited to Italy on behalf of the government to give a course of lectures and later to inspect Italian Montessori schools. Later that year Benito Mussolini's Fascist government came to power in Italy. In December, Montessori came back to Italy to plan a series of annual training courses under government sponsorship, and in 1923, the minister of education Giovanni Gentile expressed his official support for Montessori schools and teacher training. In 1924 Montessori met with Mussolini, who extended his official support for Montessori education as part of the national program. A pre-war group of Montessori supporters, the Societa gli Amici del Metodo Montessori (Society of Friends of the Montessori Method) became the Opera Montessori (Montessori Society) with a government charter, and by 1926 Mussolini was made honorary president of the organization. In 1927 Mussolini established a Montessori teacher training college, and by 1929 the Italian government supported a wide range of Montessori institutions. However, from 1930 on, Montessori and the Italian government came into conflict over financial support and ideological issues, especially after Montessori's lectures on Peace and Education. In 1932 she and her son Mario were placed under political surveillance. Finally, in 1933, she resigned from the Opera Montessori, and in 1934 she left Italy. The Italian government ended Montessori activities in the country in 1936.\n\nMontessori lectured in Vienna in 1923, and her lectures were published as \"Il Bambino in Famiglia\", published in English in 1936 as \"The Child in the Family\". Between 1913 and 1936 Montessori schools and societies were also established in France, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, Russia, Serbia, Canada, India, China, Japan, Indonesia, Australia, and New Zealand.\n\nIn 1929, the first International Montessori Congress was held in Elsinore, Denmark, in conjunction with the Fifth Conference of the New Education Fellowship. At this event, Montessori and her son Mario founded the Association Montessori Internationale or AMI \"to oversee the activities of schools and societies all over the world and to supervise the training of teachers.\" AMI also controlled rights to the publication of Montessori's works and the production of authorized Montessori didactic materials. Early sponsors of the AMI included Sigmund Freud, Jean Piaget, and Rabindranath Tagore.\n\nIn 1932, Montessori spoke on Peace and Education at the Second International Montessori Congress in Nice, France; this lecture was published by the Bureau International d'Education, Geneva, Switzerland. In 1932, Montessori spoke at the International Peace Club in Geneva, Switzerland, on the theme of Peace and Education. Montessori held peace conferences from 1932 to 1939 in Geneva, Brussels, Copenhagen, and Utrecht, which were later published in Italian as \"Educazione e Pace\", and in English as \"Education and Peace\". In 1949, and again in 1950 and in 1951, Montessori was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, receiving a total of six nominations.\n\nIn 1936 Montessori and her family left Barcelona for England, and soon moved to Laren, near Amsterdam. Montessori and her son Mario continued to develop new materials here, including the knobless cylinders, the grammar symbols, and botany nomenclature cards. In the context of rising military tensions in Europe, Montessori increasingly turned her attention to the theme of peace. In 1937, the 6th International Montessori Congress was held on the theme of \"Education for Peace\", and Montessori called for a \"science of peace\" and spoke about the role of education of the child as a key to the reform of society. In 1938, Montessori was invited to India by the Theosophical Society to give a training course, and in 1939 she left the Netherlands with her son and collaborator Mario.\n\nAn interest in Montessori had existed in India since 1913, when an Indian student attended the first international course in Rome, and students throughout the 1920s and 1930s had come back to India to start schools and promote Montessori education. The Montessori Society of India was formed in 1926, and \"Il Metodo\" was translated into Gujarati and Hindi in 1927. By 1929, Indian poet Rabindranath Tagore had founded many \"Tagore-Montessori\" schools in India, and Indian interest in Montessori education was strongly represented at the International Congress in 1929. Montessori herself had been personally associated with the Theosophical Society since 1907. The Theosophical movement, motivated to educate India's poor, was drawn to Montessori education as one solution.\n\nMontessori gave a training course at the Theosophical Society in Madras in 1939, and had intended to give a tour of lectures at various universities, and then return to Europe. However, when Italy entered World War II on the side of the Germans in 1940, Britain interned all Italians in the United Kingdom and its colonies as enemy aliens. In fact only Mario Montessori was interned, while Montessori herself was confined to the Theosophical Society compound, and Mario was reunited with his mother after two months. The Montessoris remained in Madras and Kodaikanal until 1946, although they were allowed to travel in connection with lectures and courses.\n\nDuring her years in India, Montessori and her son Mario continued to develop her educational method. The term \"cosmic education\" was introduced to describe an approach for children aged from six to twelve years that emphasized the interdependence of all the elements of the natural world. Children worked directly with plants and animals in their natural environments, and the Montessoris developed lessons, illustrations, charts, and models for use with elementary aged children. Material for botany, zoology, and geography was created. Between 1942 and 1944 these elements were incorporated into an advanced course for work with children from six to twelve years old. This work led to two books: \"Education for a New World\" and \"To Educate the Human Potential\".\n\nWhile in India, Montessori observed children and adolescents of all ages, and turned to the study of infancy. In 1944 she gave a series of thirty lectures on the first three years of life, and a government-recognized training course in Sri Lanka. These lectures were collected in 1949 in the book \"What You Should Know About Your Child\".\n\nIn 1944 the Montessoris were granted some freedom of movement and traveled to Sri Lanka. In 1945 Montessori attended the first All India Montessori Conference in Jaipur, and in 1946, with the war over, she and her family returned to Europe.\n\nIn 1946, at the age of 76, Montessori returned to Amsterdam, but she spent the next six years travelling in Europe and India. She gave a training course in London in 1946, and in 1947 opened a training institute there, the Montessori Centre. After a few years this centre became independent of Montessori and continued as the St. Nicholas Training Centre. Also in 1947, she returned to Italy to re-establish the Opera Montessori and gave two more training courses. Later that year she returned to India and gave courses in Adyar and Ahmedabad. These courses led to the book \"The Absorbent Mind\", in which Montessori described the development of the child from birth onwards and presented the concept of the Four Planes of Development. In 1948 \"Il Metodo\" was revised again and published in English as \"The Discovery of the Child\". In 1949 she gave a course in Pakistan and the Montessori Pakistan Association was founded.\n\nIn 1949 Montessori returned to Europe and attended the 8th International Montessori Congress in Sanremo, Italy, where a model classroom was demonstrated. The same year, the first training course for birth to three years of age, called the Scuola Assistenti all'infanzia (Montessori School for Assistants to Infancy) was established. She was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. Montessori was also awarded the French Legion of Honor, Officer of the Dutch Order of Orange Nassau, and received an Honorary Doctorate of the University of Amsterdam. In 1950 she visited Scandinavia, represented Italy at the UNESCO conference in Florence, presented at the 29th international training course in Perugia, gave a national course in Rome, published a fifth edition of \"Il Metodo\" with the new title \"La Scoperta del Bambino\" (\"The Discovery of the Child\"), and was again nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. In 1951 she participated in the 9th International Montessori Congress in London, gave a training course in Innsbruck, was nominated for the third time for the Nobel Peace Prize. Montessori died of a cerebral hemorrhage on May 6, 1952 at the age of 81 in Noordwijk aan Zee, the Netherlands.\n\nMontessori's theory and philosophy of education were initially heavily influenced by the work of Jean Marc Gaspard Itard, Édouard Séguin, Friedrich Fröbel, and Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi, all of whom emphasized sensory exploration and manipulatives. Montessori's first work with mentally disabled children, at the Orthophrenic School in 1900–1901, used the methods of Itard and Séguin, training children in physical activities such as walking and the use of a spoon, training their senses by exposure to sights, smells, and tactile experiences, and introducing letters in tactile form. These activities developed into the Montessori \"Sensorial\" materials.\n\nMontessori considered her work in the Orthophrenic School and her subsequent psychological studies and research work in elementary schools as \"scientific pedagogy\", a concept current in the study of education at the time. She called for not just observation and measurement of students, but for the development of new methods which would transform them. \"Scientific education, therefore, was that which, while based on science, modified and improved the individual.\" Further, education itself should be transformed by science: \"The new methods if they were run on scientific lines, ought to change completely both the school and its methods, ought to give rise to a new form of education.\"\n\nWorking with non-disabled children in the \"Casa dei Bambini\" in 1907, Montessori began to develop her own pedagogy. The essential elements of her educational theory emerged from this work, described in \"The Montessori Method\" in 1912 and in \"The Discovery of the Child\" in 1948. Her method was founded on the observation of children at liberty to act freely in an environment prepared to meet their needs. Montessori came to the conclusion that the children's spontaneous activity in this environment revealed an internal program of development, and that the appropriate role of the educator was to remove obstacles to this natural development and provide opportunities for it to proceed and flourish.\n\nAccordingly, the schoolroom was equipped with child-sized furnishings, \"practical life\" activities such as sweeping and washing tables, and teaching material that Montessori had developed herself. Children were given freedom to choose and carry out their own activities, at their own paces and following their own inclinations. In these conditions, Montessori made a number of observations which became the foundation of her work. First, she observed great concentration in the children and spontaneous repetition of chosen activities. She also observed a strong tendency in the children to order their own environment, straightening tables and shelves and ordering materials. As children chose some activities over others, Montessori refined the materials she offered to them. Over time, the children began to exhibit what she called \"spontaneous discipline\".\n\nMontessori continued to develop her pedagogy and her model of human development as she expanded her work and extended it to older children. She saw human behavior as guided by universal, innate characteristics in human psychology which her son and collaborator Mario Montessori identified as \"human tendencies\" in 1957. In addition, she observed four distinct periods, or \"planes\", in human development, extending from birth to six years, from six to twelve, from twelve to eighteen, and from eighteen to twenty-four. She saw different characteristics, learning modes, and developmental imperatives active in each of these planes, and called for educational approaches specific to each period. Over the course of her lifetime, Montessori developed pedagogical methods and materials for the first two planes, from birth to age twelve, and wrote and lectured about the third and fourth planes. Maria created over 4,000 Montessori classrooms across the world and her books were translated into many different languages for the training of new educators. Her methods are installed in hundreds of public and private schools across the United States.\n\nOne of Montessori's many accomplishments was the Montessori method. This is a method of education for young children that stresses the development of a child's own initiative and natural abilities, especially through practical play. This method allowed children to develop at their own pace and provided educators with a new understanding of child development. Montessori's book, \"The Montessori Method\", presents the method in detail. Educators who followed this model set up special environments to meet the needs of students in three developmentally-meaningful age groups: 2–2.5 years, 2.5–6 years, and 6–12 years. The students learn through activities that involve exploration, manipulations, order, repetition, abstraction, and communication. Teachers encourage children in the first two age groups to use their senses to explore and manipulate materials in their immediate environment. Children in the last age group deal with abstract concepts based on their newly developed powers of reasoning, imagination, and creativity.\n\nMontessori published a number of books, articles, and pamphlets during her lifetime, often in Italian, but sometimes first in English. According to Kramer, \"the major works published before 1920 (\"The Montessori Method\", \"Pedagogical Anthropology\", \"The Advanced Montessori Method—Spontaneous Activity in Education and The Montessori Elementary Material\"), were written in Italian by her and translated under her supervision.\" However, many of her later works were transcribed from her lectures, often in translation, and only later published in book form.\n\nMontessori's major works are given here in order of their first publication, with significant revisions and translations.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4754923", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4754923", "title": "Metaphysical solipsism", "text": "Metaphysical solipsism\n\nMetaphysical solipsism is the variety of idealism which asserts that nothing exists externally to \"this one mind\", and since \"this mind\" is the whole of reality then the \"external world\" was never anything more than an \"idea\". It can also be expressed by the assertion \"there is nothing external to these present experiences\", in other words, no reality exists beyond whatever is presently being sensed. The aforementioned definition of solipsism entails the non-existence of anything presently unperceived including the external world, causation, other minds (including God's mind or a subconscious mind), the past or future, and a subject of experience. Despite their ontological non-existence, these entities may nonetheless be said to \"exist\" as \"useful descriptions\" of the various experiences and thoughts that constitute 'this' mind. The solipsistic self is described by Wittgenstein in the Tractatus: \"The self of solipsism shrinks to a point without extension and there remains the reality co-ordinated with it\" (\"TLP\" 5.64).\n\nThere are weaker versions of metaphysical solipsism, such as Caspar Hare's egocentric presentism (or perspectival realism), in which other persons are conscious but their experiences are simply not \"present\". Similarly, J. J. Valberg develops a concept of one's personal horizon and discusses how it is in a sense \"the\" (preeminent) horizon, stating that \"we are all solipsists\" in his sense of solipsism.\n\nThe argument in favor of solipsism:\n\n\nThe basic form of the argument:\n\nSimilar philosophy is found in Hindu religion, namely drishti-srishti-vada.\nIn teachings of Ramana Maharshi there are two cues on solipsism:\n\n\"Jiva is called so because he sees the world. A dreamer sees many jivas in a dream, but all of them are not real. The dreamer alone exists and he sees all. So it is with the individual and the world. There is the creed of only one Self, which is also called the creed of only one jiva. It says that the jiva is the only one who sees the whole world and the lives therein.\"\n\nOne reason for the lack of support of this philosophical position is how strange it would be for a solipsist to preach solipsism – as if to convince everyone around them that they are purely a figment of the author's own imagination. The very idea of communicating philosophical ideas would be arbitrary to a true solipsist, as according to them, there is no other mind with whom they would communicate their beliefs.\n\nRussell commented, on the same theme:\n\"As against solipsism, it is to be said, in the first place, that it is psychologically impossible to believe, and is rejected in fact even by those who mean to accept it. I once received a letter from an eminent logician, Mrs. Christine Ladd-Franklin,\nsaying that she was a solipsist, and was surprised that there were no others. Coming from a logician, this surprised me. The fact that I cannot believe something does not prove that it is false, but it does prove that I am insincere and frivolous if I pretend to believe it.\" (Russell, p. 180).\nThe basic argument for solipsism suffers a logical error as well. It is argued that, because the mind can not conclude the existence of anything external, therefore nothing external exists. But this conclusion does not follow, only that the existence of externalities cannot be known. It is just as logically consistent that there are external realities/minds/etc. as there are not when experience cannot be verified either true or false.\n\n\n"}

Adorno's Perspective\", in 2004. His primary fields of interest are critical theory, Western Marxism and Post-Marxism, and their relation to contemporary thought. He mostly deals with materialistic theory of the subject, ideas and universalism, praxis, concepts of transition and the theory of spectacular categories (or materialist hauntology). He is a fellow at the Department of Contemporary Continental Philosophy (Institute of Philosophy at the Academy of Arts of the Czech Republic), and also teaches at the Faculty of Education (Charles University). Since 2005, Hauser has published several academic books.\n\nHauser has made several translations into Czech, including \"The Ticklish Subject\" by Slavoj Žižek, and \"Dialectic of the Enlightenment\". He published a number of articles, both academic (in \"Filosofický časopis\", \"Décalages\", \"An Althusser Studies Journal\") and popular (\"Právo\", \"A2\", \"Literární noviny\", \"A2larm\" and \"Deník referendum\"). In 2004, he founded Socialist Circle (later renamed as SOK – Association for Leftist Theory), an organization that seeks to reflect and promote contemporary leftist theory in the Czech environment and establish a common basis for interaction between philosophy, sociology, economy and art theory. The association held a number of conferences and public seminars, many of which included Hauser as a speaker, and also published translations of the works of Alain Badiou, Jacques Rancière or Slavoj Žižek. Alongside the focus on European philosophy, the association also concentrates on the Czech and Slovak leftist scene (Karel Kosík, Egon Bondy, Milan Machovec). In 2006, Hauser was among the leading figures of the \"Jsme občané!\" (We Are Citizens!) initiative, a critical public reflection of the shortcomings of liberal democracy in the Czech Republic. His current work includes the development of a materialist theory of the subject alternative to the conceptions of Alain Badiou and Slavoj Žižek, in the sense that it would relate the discussed issues to the tradition of Western Marxism (Adorno, Lukács, Althusser, Marx). Hauser also finds inspiration in Czech critical thinking (Karel Kosík, Robert Kalivoda, Milan Machovec).

He was president of the Miloš Crnjanski Endowment in Belgrade.\n\nIn 1968 during a big student revolt in the streets of Belgrade, he daily criticized official press coverage of the protests in front of hundreds of protesting students. For this reason he was denounced by semi-official newspaper \"Politika\". He was a leading anti-Marxist intellectual in Serbia during the 1970s and 1980s. In the 1970s he criticized severely Vladimir Lenin's involvement in pre-revolutionary robberies and this had powerful echo and undermined pro-Marxist intelligentsia in Yugoslavia that supported the government of Josip Broz Tito. In his 1985 book \"Marxism and Jesuitism\" he severely criticized Lenin and Joseph Stalin, which prompted Soviet officials to unsuccessfully demand his removal from the University of Belgrade. He continued his anti-communist involvement during the rule of Slobodan Milošević (1990–2000) and was eventually banned from entering the Faculty of Philology building in 1998 by a government-appointed dean.\n\nNikola Milošević's lectures at the Faculty of Philology were attended by the who is who of intellectual Belgrade and his polemics with Marxist authors attracted considerable attention.

Founded in 1977 by Elizabeth Lesser and Stephan Rechtschaffen, inspired by Sufi mystic, Pir Vilayat Inayat Khan and his ecumenical spirituality, today it offers classes to over 25,000 people a year, at the campus.\n\nThe institute's stated mission is to \"provide hope and healing for individuals and society through innovative educational experiences that awaken the best in the human spirit\". Omega’s workshops, conferences, and retreats aim to create dialogues on the integration of modern medicine and natural healing; connect science, spirituality, and creativity; and build the groundwork for new traditions and lifestyles.\n\nIn 1977, co-founders Stephan Rechtschaffen, author of \"Timeshifting,\" and Elizabeth Lesser, author of \"The Seeker’s Guide\" and \"New York Times\" best-selling \"Broken Open\", say they were inspired to create the Omega Institute by scholar and Eastern meditation teacher, Pir Vilayat Inayat Khan. The name “Omega” came from the teachings of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, a 20th-century French philosopher and Jesuit priest who used the term “Omega Point” to describe the peak of unity and integration toward which all life is evolving. First established while Lesser and Rechtschaffen were staying at New Lebanon Shaker Village, then in 1980 it found a new home at a land which once housed the Sholem Aleichem Folk Institute's Camp Boiberick, in the Hudson River Valley.\n\nOmega Institute began its programming with several workshops, and now holds more than 300 workshops in Rhinebeck, New York City, Costa Rica, and California.\n\nIn 1982, Omega expanded from rented facilities in New York and Vermont to its current location on the former grounds of Camp Boiberik, a Yiddish camp, in Rhinebeck, New York. There are more than 100 buildings on the campus, including a dining hall, café, and bookstore. Its buildings also include the Ram Dass Library, named for author Ram Dass who \"has been a trusted guide to Omega\". In honor of Dass' life’s work, the organization commissioned the library, which is designed in an eight petal lotus blossom shape to represent Ram Dass’ service to public health, advancing social justice, and supporting spiritual development throughout the world.\n\nThe campus also includes the (OCSL), which is an education center powered by a 48.5 kW solar electric system and has a water reclamation facility.\n\nThe OCSL was one of the first two buildings in the world to be certified as \"living\" by the International Living Building Institute. The Omega Center for Sustainable Living is a wastewater filtration facility that is designed to use the treated water for garden irrigation and in a grey water recovery system. Omega will use the system and the building as a teaching tool in their educational program designed around the ecological impact of their campus.\n\nOmega’s educational programs include workshops, professional trainings, retreats, and conferences. Workshops are organized into six categories: body, mind, and spirit; health and healing; creative expression; relationships and family; leadership and work; and sustainable living.\n\nNew York City events have included speakers such as Al Gore, Christopher Reeve, and\nEckhart Tolle.

In his thesis, he argues that inventions are not the result of a rigorous scientific method but rather come as a deterministic consequence of a set of conditions in which the inventor lives. This theory was contested very soon after its publication in the 1882 edition of the \"Revue Internationale de l'Enseignement\". Also in 1882 his wife gave birth to Étienne Souriau, who also became a philosopher in aesthetics. The French thesis was created simultaneously with a Latin thesis titled \"De motus perceptione\". The Latin thesis emphasized the importance of vision in movement perception, hence the initial title \"De visione motus\". The thesis was a precursor for his later works on movement perception.\n\nHe became a professor at the Faculté des Lettres de Lille (now University of Lille) very soon after its foundation in 1887. In 1889, he published his reflections on the aesthetics of movement. The book described two levels of movement aesthetics: the mechanical beauty (the adaptation of the movement to fulfil its goal) and the movement expression (the meaning of the movement for an observer). By doing so Souriau distinguished movement from perception of movement, two concepts which later became the subjects of studies of motor cognition and psychophysics.\n\nThroughout his career, but more particularly during the first decade of the 20th century, he published his reflections on the aesthetics of arts while being a professor at Henri Poincaré University (Nancy). Throughout his life, Félix Alcan was his main editor.\n\n"}

He has a doctorate in brain research and is the author and editor of over 25 books. He is a long-time adviser to China's leaders and the Chinese government, to multinational corporations on China strategies and transactions, and is a frequent commentator on the politics, economics, business, finance, philosophy and science of China. He is a columnist for \"China Daily\" and \"South China Morning Post\" and appears on the \"BBC\", \"CNN\", \"China Central Television\", \"Bloomberg\" and other major media. Kuhn is the creator and host of the \"CCTV/CGTN News\" show \"Closer to China with R.L.Kuhn\". Kuhn is the creator, writer and host of the public television series \"Closer to Truth\", which presents scientists and philosophers discussing fundamental issues (cosmos, consciousness, philosophy/religion). His essays are featured on \"LiveScience.com\" and \"Space.com\".\n\nKuhn received a bachelor's degree in human biology from Johns Hopkins University (Phi Beta Kappa) in 1964, a PhD in anatomy / brain research from the University of California at Los Angeles' Brain Research Institute in 1968 and a master of science in management as a Sloan fellow from the MIT Sloan School of Management in 1980.\n\nKuhn first came to prominence in 1972 when \"Why the Vast Difference between Animal Brain and Human Mind?\" appeared in \"The Plain Truth\" magazine published by Ambassador College, an institution of the Worldwide Church of God (WCG). The WCG's Systematic Theology Project was coordinated by Kuhn, but later banned by WCG Founder Herbert W. Armstrong. Kuhn severed his connection to the WCG and its affiliates, including the Ambassador International Cultural Foundation (classical music concerts, featuring musicians including Vladimir Horowitz and Luciano Pavarotti), which Kuhn had created and managed.\n\nDuring the 1980s, Kuhn represented American and Japanese companies in mergers and acquisitions.\n\nDuring the 19th CPC National Congress (October 2017), Dr. Kuhn was interviewed extensively, including multiple times on CNN, BBC World News and BBC World Service, CGTN, and CCTV, and he was quoted extensively.

In 2000 Kuhn sold the Geneva Companies to Citigroup.\n\nSeveral reviewers argue that Kuhn has obtained privileged access to China's leaders by refraining from critical comments, producing propaganda instead of serious works of non-fiction. A review in Foreign Affairs of Kuhn's The Man Who Changed China, a biography of Jiang Zemin said it was actually better understood as an officially sanctioned autobiography, presenting an image that China's leaders want the world to see. Additionally, it said the writing of the book was, beginning in 2001, overseen by a secret state propaganda team. The Asian Review of Books said that the first part of this book was \"close to hagiography\". A review on the website of Forbes said his later book, \"How China's Leaders Think: The Inside Story of China's Past, Current and Future Leaders\", was equally reluctant to criticize Hu Jintao, the leader who followed Jiang. The reviewer writes: \"Kuhn merely repeats what the Communist Party says about itself and accepts its words at face value, taking obsequiousness to new heights.\" \n\n\"Closer to Truth\" is a continuing television series on PBS and public television stations, created, produced, written and hosted by Kuhn. The series premiered in 2000. The current series, \"Closer to Truth: Cosmos. Consciousness. God\" is now in its 17th season. See List of Closer to Truth episodes. \"Closer To Truth\" offers candid, in-depth conversations with leading scientists, philosophers, theologians and scholars, covering cosmology and physics (cause, size and nature of the universe or multiverse), brain/mind and consciousness and philosophy of religion and the search for meaning.

Since 1985 Ruether has served as a board member for the pro-choice group \"Catholics for Choice\".\n\nRuether was born in 1936 in St. Paul, Minnesota, to a Roman Catholic mother and Episcopal father. She has reportedly described her upbringing as free-thinking and humanistic as opposed to oppressive. Ruether's father died when she was 12 and afterwards Ruether and her mother moved to California. Ruether attended several Catholic schools staffed by the Sisters of Providence from St. Mary-of-the-Woods, IN, who, in conjunction with her mother's friend group, offered Ruether a strong feminist and activist foundation that informed her later work. She pursued a college education at Scripps College from 1954-58. She entered with an intention to study art, but one professor, Robert Palmer, influenced her decision to switch to classics. Palmer's passion for classical Greek and Roman culture introduced Ruether to the philosophies and histories of the era. She received an MA in classics and Roman history, and later a doctorate in classics and patristics at the School of Theology at Claremont.\n\nRuether participated in civil rights activism during the 1960s in Mississippi and Washington D.C.

{"id": "10511903", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10511903", "title": "Seongcheol", "text": "Seongcheol\n\nSeongcheol (April 6, 1912 – November 4, 1993) is the dharma name of a Korean Seon (Zen) Master. He was a key figure in modern Korean Buddhism, being responsible for significant changes to it from the 1950s to 1990s.\n\nSeongcheol was widely recognized in Korea as having been a living Buddha, due to his extremely ascetic lifestyle, the duration and manner of his meditation training, his central role in reforming Korean Buddhism in the post-World War II era, and the quality of his oral and written teachings.\n\nBorn on April 10, 1912 in Korea under the name of Yi Yeongju(이영주), Seongcheol was the first of seven children of a Confucian scholar in Gyeongsang province. He was rumored to have been an exceptionally bright child who read constantly, having learned to read at the age of three, and being proficient enough to read such Chinese classics as \"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\" and \"Journey to the West\" by age ten. His enthusiasm for reading was such that he once traded a sack of rice for Immanuel Kant's \"Critique of Pure Reason\" as a teenager.\n\nHaving read numerous books on philosophy and religion, both Western and Eastern, he reportedly felt dissatisfied, being convinced that these could not lead him to truth. One day, a Seon monk gave Seongcheol a copy of \"The Song of Attainment of the Tao\" (Hangul: 증도가, Hanja: 證道歌), a Seon text written by Yeongga Hyeon-gak (永嘉玄覺) in the Tang dynasty. Seongcheol felt as if \"a bright light had suddenly been lit in complete darkness,\" and that he had finally found the way to the ultimate truth.\n\nImmediately, he started meditating on the \"Mu\" gong-an (Japanese: koan) and started ignoring all his responsibilities at home. Deciding that his parents' house had too many distractions, he promptly packed his bags and went to Daewonsa (Daewon temple). After obtaining permission to stay in the temple, the young Seongcheol started to meditate intensively. Later in life, he would say that he attained the state of Dongjeong Ilyeo (see Teachings below, Hangul: 동정일여, Hanja: 動靜一如) at this early point in his life in only forty-two days.\n\nThe rumor of a lay person meditating so intensely naturally spread to the main temple of Haeinsa(해인사). Under the recommendations of renowned Seon Masters Gim Beomnin and Choe Beomsul, the young Seongcheol left for Haeinsa in the winter of 1936. At the time, Seon Master Dongsan was the spiritual leader of Haeinsa, and recognizing Seongcheol's great potential, he recommended he become a monk. But Seongcheol refused, stating that he had absolutely no intention of becoming a monk and that only intense meditation was important. But Dongsan master's dharma talk during the following retreat season changed his mind:\n\nIn March 1937, Yi Yeongju received his dharma name of Seongcheol, forsook all relations with the outside world, and became a monk, writing this poem:\n\nIn the tradition of Korean Buddhist monks, Seongcheol wandered from one temple to the next after each meditation retreat. In the summer of 1940, he went into deep meditation at the Geum Dang Seon Center and attained enlightenment. Having become a monk at the age of 25, he had attained his true nature in only three years. He went on to write his enlightenment poem:\n\nHaving attained enlightenment, Seongcheol began pilgrimages to various temples in order to validate his experience and to examine other monks and their levels of attainment. But he was frequently disappointed, noticing that inka (validation of a monk's attainment by a master) was given too carelessly, thereby falsely recognizing many monks as having fully attained enlightenment. During his retreat at Songgwangsa, he was also dismayed at Jinul's theory of Dono Jeomsu (sudden enlightenment, gradual training), and how it was the widespread theory during the time. Later during the 1980s and 1990s, his contribution to the revival of Hui Neng's traditional theory of Dono Donsu (sudden enlightenment, sudden training) would have a significant effect on the practice of Seon in Korea, China, Japan, and other countries where Seon/Zen is practiced.\n\nSeongcheol's reputation soon began to spread. Numerous factors contributed to his growing recognition.\n\nOne of the more famous anecdotes is Seongcheol's Jangjwa Bulwa (Hangul: 장좌불와, Hanja: 長坐不臥). Literally translated as 'long sitting, no lying,' it is a meditation technique that some monks employ to intensify their practice. Sitting meditation is equivalent to most other practices, except that the practitioner does not lie down to sleep, but stays in the lotus position even during sleep, with the intention of minimizing sleep through the position. Seongcheol was known to have practiced this for eight years after his enlightenment. He reportedly never once lied down and denied sleeping at all.\n\nAnother anecdote recounts how while Seongcheol was staying in Mangwolsa in Dobong mountain, an old monk by the name of Chunseong refused to believe this. He wanted to catch Seongcheol dozing off to sleep, so spied on him secretly throughout one night. But having witnessed the truth of the rumor, Chunseong was struck with amazement and himself started employing the technique. It is said that the stress of the practice and the old age at which he started the technique caused all of his teeth to fall out later in life.\n\nSeongcheol's reputation for intensive practice was not limited only to his meditation per se. He was also known to be completely indifferent to the outside world, focused intently only on meditation and guiding fellow monks to enlightenment. His indifference was so thorough that he even refused to see his mother when she visited him at Mahayunsa in Kumgangsan mountain. \"No need to see her\" was reportedly his reply to her visit, to which his fellow monks burst out in anger, stating that although they were monks devoted to asceticism and meditation, refusing to see his own mother was too extreme an action. Afterwards, Seongcheol accompanied his mother, showing her the sites of Kumgangsan mountain.\n\nOn August 15, 1945, Japan surrendered unconditionally, thereby ending World War II and the occupation of Korea. The events offered an invaluable opportunity for the reformation of Korean Buddhism, which had been severely oppressed during the Japanese occupation. As an emerging leader of Korean Buddhism, Seongcheol joined the nascent discussions on the emerging plans to reform the religion. Forming a partnership with such luminaries as the venerable Jawoon, Cheongdam, and Hyanggok, the future leaders of Korean Buddhism chose Bong Am Sa temple of Heui Yang mountain. There, they formed a pact to live strictly according to the Vinaya, the Buddhist code of ethics. The members agreed upon rules of conduct (Hangul: 공주규약, Hanja: 共住規約) and required strict adherence to it amongst themselves:\n\n\nThe reformation movement started around a small group of monks centered on Seongcheol, but quickly grew by reputation, attracting monks all over the country who were also intent on bringing back the Korean tradition of intense meditation, strict celibacy, and study of sutras. Among these younger generations were Weolsan (월산), Ubong (우봉), Bomun (보문), Seongsu (성수), Dou (도우), Hyeam (혜암), Beopjeon (법전), etc. Not only did this group become the future leaders of Korean Buddhism, but produced two Supreme Patriarchs (Hyeam, Beopjeon) and three chief administrators of the Jogye order.\n\nUnfortunately, the Bong Am Sa experiment ended prematurely in 1950 when the Korean War broke out on the peninsula. With constant bombing raids and the presence of soldiers of both sides around the temple, it was impossible to continue the strict monastic life of Bong-amsa.\n\nSome of the reforms that occurred during this period were:\n\nAfter the war, the reformation gained momentum and significant changes were set in motion, although it would be years until they were solidified. Central to the reformation was the issue of celibacy. While all the Buddhist canons emphasized the celibacy of monks, Japanese Buddhism had undergone significant changes during the Meiji Restoration, most notably the end of monastic celibacy. During the Japanese occupation, Korean Buddhism was severely oppressed and the Japanese style was advocated, thereby converting most Korean monks into little more than monastic residents officiating over ceremonies, married, with a business and income. Seongcheol and the new leaders were very critical of the Japanese style of Buddhism, maintaining that the tradition of celibacy, hermitage, poverty, and intense meditation were not only central to Korean Buddhism but to the true spirit of Buddhism as a whole. Korean post-war sentiments towards Japan could not have been worse at this time, and with the help of the populace and president Syngman Rhee, the traditional Korean style began to take hold and became the dominant form of Buddhism by the 1970s.\n\nSeongcheol insisted on giving away all monastic assets to the public and reverting to the original Buddhist way of wandering and begging for alms while investing all energy into meditation. He contended this was the only surefire way for true reforms to take place, warning that otherwise, full-scale conflict could ensue between bikkhus and married monks fighting over temples. The leaders of the reformation refused to follow, stating that his assertions were too extreme. Seongcheol's predictions, though, did come true and Korean Buddhism has had numerous conflicts between monks over temple jurisdiction ever since then up to the present day, many of them escalating to violent measures by both sides (e.g. paying gangsters to physically harm opponents). Many ordination restrictions were loosened by the bikkhus in order to increase their numbers in their efforts to assume control over temples such that men of questionable social standing (e.g. former convicts and criminals) were ordained as bikkhus, leading to more violent fights amongst monks. A particularly embarrassing chapter in Korean Buddhism was in the late 1990s when monks fought over Jogyesa, the main administrative temple in Seoul, by not only employing gangsters but joining the fight themselves using weapons, including Molotov cocktails, to violently subdue each other.\n\nIn 1955, Seongcheol was appointed as the patriarch of Haeinsa, but disappointed by the direction that the reformation was taking, Seongcheol declined, removing himself from the forefront and moved to a hermitage near Pagyesa in the Palgong mountains near Daegu to deepen the meditative and enlightened stage that he had attained. The hermitage was named Seongjeonam and it was here that Seongcheol began to build the scholarly foundations that would later support his spiritual teachings. Seongcheol surrounded the hermitage with barbed wire so as to keep outsiders out (except for a few assistants) and himself within its boundaries. Never leaving the boundaries of the small hermitage for an incredible ten years, he deepened his meditation and studied the ancient Buddhist canons, Zen texts, sutras, modern mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, and even taught himself English so as to keep current on international affairs. This decade of self-education would affect his future teachings significantly.\n\nSeongcheol finally opened the doors of Seong Juhn Am hermitage in 1965. The temple he visited was Gimyongsa, where he gave his first dharma talk in a decade. In 1967, with the insisting of Jawoon, Seongcheol became the patriarch of Haeinsa temple. That winter, he started his daily two-hour dharma talks to monks and the lay people, thereby beginning his famous Hundred-Day Talk (Hangul: 백일법문, Hanja: 百日法門.) Applying his decade of scholarly studies, he began to break the stereotype of the \"boring and stuffy\" dharma talks and transformed them into an electrifying hybrid of Buddhism, spiritualism, quantum mechanics, general relativity, and current affairs, ushering in a new kind of dharma talk aimed at reaching the modern audience living in an age of globalization and intellectual diversity.\n\nUshering in a revival of the Seon tradition of intense meditation and strict monastic lifestyle, Seongcheol spearheaded the reformation of modern Korean Buddhism from the rubbles of Japanese colonialism into an epicenter of meditation training. During his tenure as patriarch of Haeinsa, the temple transformed into a training ground for meditation, sutra studies, and Vinaya studies, attracting monks from all over the country. The meditation center averaged approximately 500 monks per biannual retreat, which was unheard of since the days of Hui Neng and Ma Tzu.\n\nDuring the 1970s, the political climate became even more militaristic and dictatorial, eventually leading to a purge of many Buddhist monks suspected of political involvement. With his increasing reputation as a living Buddha both by the lay and the monastic, the Jogye order looked toward Seongcheol and nominated him as the next Supreme Patriarch of the order. \"If I can help reform and improve Korean Buddhism, I will humbly accept\" was the response he gave. His inauguration speech brought him from a little known monk, only known by monks and devout lay people, into the limelight as the official leader of Korean Buddhism, bringing his teachings to the entire nation:\n\nDeclining all formal ceremonies as Supreme Patriarch from inauguration to his death, Seongcheol never left the mountains, stating that a monk's true place was in the temple. There was initially a huge protest against his semi-hermetic policy, but this was eventually replaced by sense of respect that had been lacking since the Joseon period, and helped to vastly improve the image and treatment of monks in Korea.\n\nDuring his years as patriarch of Haeinsa and as Supreme Patriarch of the Jogye order, Seongcheol's reputation kept growing. Amongst monks, he was famous for being a very strict teacher, being called the tiger of Kaya mountain. When monks would nod off to sleep during meditation, he would beat them with wooden sticks while yelling, \"Thief, pay for your rice!\" (referring to the donations of the lay, and the monks' debts to society and therefore his duty to practice to the utmost of his abilities).\n\nHe was also known for his unique three thousand prostrations. After the Korean war, Seongcheol built a small cave-hermitage near Anjungsa temple and named it Cheonjegul. Around this time, many people came to pay their respects to him, and to further guide the pilgrims in their practice, Seongcheol first started using his famous 3000 prostrations. Nobody could visit with him unless the person completed 3000 prostrations in front of the statue of the Buddha in the main hall. Later, some lay people would accuse Seongcheol of arrogance, but he maintained that this practice was used to help guide practitioners in their own practice by helping them destroy their ego and more easily attain one-mindedness (N.B.: the 3000 full prostrations are actually a mainstay of the Korean Buddhist training regimen, performed at most temples in Korea on a monthly basis. It would take approximately eight to twelve hours, depending on the experience of the practitioner, and the technique is used frequently to \"clear the mind,\" instill a sense of humility, and increase the awareness and focusing power of the practitioner). As his fame and reputation grew, the prostrations became more necessary as more and more people asked to meet with him. What was unique was that this requirement was uniform, i.e., he would never make any exceptions regardless of the person's wealth, fame, or power. A famous anecdote serves to illustrate the daunting task of the 3000 prostrations and Seongcheol's strict adherence to his own rules. When Park Chung-hee, the president of Korea, was opening up the new highway between Seoul and Pusan, he happened to visit Haeinsa. Hearing that the president was visiting, the head administrative monk quickly sent word to Seongcheol to come down from his hermitage to greet the president. But true to form, Seongcheol demanded the president go to the main Buddha hall and perform the 3000 prostrations before meeting with him. Park refused and the two never met.\n\nDuring the latter years of his life, Seongcheol presided over many publications, including eleven books of his lectures and 37 books that translated many Zen classics not well known to the general public (see official website). The former included the full transcriptions of the Hundred-Day Talk, lectures on Huineng's sutra, \"Shin Sim Myung\" (Hangul: 신심명, Hanja: 信心銘), \"Jeung Do Ga\" (Hangul: 증도가, Hanja: 證道歌), \"Illumination of Sudden Enlightenment\" (Hangul: 돈오입도요문론, Hanja: 頓悟入道要門論), and his dharma talks. The latter was called \"Seon Lim Go Gyung Chong Suh\" (Hangul: 선림고경총서, Hanja: 禪林古鏡叢書) and was a collection of Chinese and Korean Zen classics that until publication was known mostly only to monks. These publications helped to spread his teachings to the general public and raise the general awareness and knowledge of Buddhism.\n\nEnglish translations of Great Master Seongcheol's work include \"Echoes from Mt. Kaya\", Changgyonggak Publishing, Seoul, 1988 (currently out of print), and \"Opening the Eye\", Gimmyeong International Co., Seoul, 2002. Both are translations from Korean by Brian Barry.\n\nOn November 4, 1993, Seongcheol died in Haeinsa Toesoeldang, the same room in which he had first become ordained as a monk. His last words to his followers were: \"Meditate well\". His parinirvana poem was:\n\nSeongcheol had this explanation for the cryptic poem:\nHis death was followed by the largest funeral ever seen in Korean history for a monk, with over 100,000 people attending. His cremation took over thirty hours and his sarira numbered over a hundred.\n\nSeongcheol's teachings can be summarized into five big categories:\n\nCiting Taego Bou (太古普愚: 1301-1382) as the true successor of the Linji Yixuan (臨済義玄) line of patriarchs rather than Jinul (知訥: 1158-1210), he advocated Hui Neng's original stance of 'sudden enlightenment, sudden cultivation' (Hangul: 돈오돈수, Hanja: 頓悟頓修) as opposed to Jinul's stance of 'sudden enlightenment, gradual cultivation' (Hangul: 돈오점수, Hanja: 頓悟漸修). Whereas Jinul had initially asserted that with enlightenment comes the need to further one's practice by gradually destroying the karmic vestiges attained through millions of rebirths, Huineng and Seongcheol maintained that with perfect enlightenment, all karmic remnants disappear and one becomes a Buddha immediately.\n\nHe also expounded on the true definition of the Middle Way (Hangul: 중도, Hanja: 中道), stating that it was not limited to avoiding the two extremes of sensual indulgence and self-mortification as many understood, but that it was also an explanation of the state of nirvana where all dualities fuse and cease to exist as separate entities, where good and bad, self and non-self become meaningless. He compared this to the common misconception that had ruled pre-Einsteinian physics, that energy and mass were two separate entities, but which Einstein had elucidated as interchangeable dual forms with the relationship described by \"E=mc²\", thereby proving the equivalence of one to the other. He also compared this to the fusion of space and time into spacetime, and also formed the analogy of ice and water. The Middle Way is not the 'middle' or 'average' of ice and water, but the true form of each, HO, and maintained that the state of nirvana was also like this, a state where the true form of all dualities is revealed as equivalent.\n\nSeongcheol strongly advocated the gong'an (Hangul: 공안, Hanja: 公案) meditation technique, asserting that it was the fastest and safest way to enlightenment. The most common gong'ans he would give to the lay and his followers were:\n\nSeongcheol also set a clear benchmark that the practitioner could apply to gauge his level of practice. Throughout his life, many followers came to him to obtain acknowledgement of their enlightenment. He was dismayed at the number of people who thought they had attained perfect enlightenment by experiencing some mental phenomenon during their practice. He therefore reiterated that every enlightened person from the Buddha and on had asserted the same definition of what enlightenment is. True attainment, he quoted, came only after \"going beyond\" the level of being able to meditate in deep sleep. Only after being able to meditate on a gong'an continuously, without interruption, throughout the waking state, then the dreaming state, and finally in deep sleep, one reaches the state where enlightenment can become possible. Before any of this, one should never claim to have become enlightened, even though there may be many instances of weird mental phenomena that happens during one's practice. The levels he identified were:\n\nSeongcheol was very critical of the Japanese style of Zen meditation. The Japanese style favors a gradual study of many gong'ans, similar to a curriculum where the practitioner would improve from an easier gong'an to a more difficult one as he mastered each one over time. Seongcheol, and many other masters, stated that this would achieve nothing since the whole point of meditation was to rid one's mind of all divergent thoughts, which was the cause of karmic rebirths and its concomitant suffering, by focusing the mind deeply on only one gong'an until it destroyed all other thoughts. By studying gong'ans like a curriculum, one was only exercising the mind even more, which was diametrically opposed to the original goal of extinguishing the mind. Thus, this gradual style of meditation was not only similar to Jinul's gradual cultivation, it was a complete waste of time to the practitioner in that Zen became nothing more than an exercise in sophistry, with higher positions being given to those who could solve more riddles. Gong'ans can never be solved with such rational, or even intuitive methods, and only the final, perfect enlightenment could give the solution to the gong'an, and simultaneously all gong'ans. Therefore, Seongcheol repeatedly made clear that the study of many gong'ans was antithetical to true meditation. He stated that attaining perfect enlightenment was equal to becoming a Buddha, and this was also equal to definitively solving the gong'an, remarking that this was not his unique teaching, but that of numerous masters including Huineng, Ma Tzu, all the way down to current masters. Being able to solve multiple gong'ans was pure delusion believed by many practitioners, and Seongcheol devoted much of his teachings to elucidating this point.\n\nSeongcheol played a key role in revitalizing Korean Buddhism which had been in deep disarray from the Japanese occupation. He was one of the leaders in the reformation, bringing back celibacy, strict practice, monasticism, and mendicancy back to Korean Buddhism. Later in his life, with his growing recognition, he helped to rectify Buddhism's discredited reputation amongst the general public, from a group of nominal monks who would get married, own businesses, and frequently collude with the Japanese occupiers, to that of serious practitioners, who never got married, and owned no possessions. Seongcheol also contributed significantly to bringing back Huineng's 'sudden enlightenment, sudden cultivation,' and clarified the notions of gong'an practice, meditation, monasticism, and enlightenment. More than a decade after his death, his books are still widely read and respected, and pilgrimages to Haeinsa are a mainstay for Buddhists.\n\n"}

{"id": "26582079", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26582079", "title": "Spygate (conspiracy theory)", "text": "Spygate (conspiracy theory)\n\nSpygate is a conspiracy theory developed and popularized by the United States president Donald Trump. With no actual supporting evidence produced, the May 2018 allegations have been widely described as blatantly false.\n\nOn May 22–May 23, 2018, Trump announced and elaborated, without providing evidence, on the existence of this conspiracy via his Twitter account, stating his belief that the previous administration under Barack Obama paid to plant a spy inside Trump's 2016 presidential campaign to assist his rival, Hillary Clinton, win the 2016 US presidential election. An FBI informant had approached separately three Trump campaign advisers in 2016 in a covert effort to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections, but as of June 7, 2018, no evidence has appeared indicating that this individual attempted to join Trump's campaign.\n\nDemocratic (Adam Schiff) and Republican (Paul Ryan, Trey Gowdy, Tom Rooney, Richard Burr, Jeff Flake and Marco Rubio) Congressmen have dismissed Trump's May 2018 allegations as lacking evidence, and maintained that the FBI did not do anything improper.\n\nIn June 2018, Trump again alleged, without providing any evidence, that there was a counter-intelligence operation into the Trump campaign starting from December 2015.\n\nTrump has been involved in the promotion of a number of conspiracy theories which have lacked meaningful substance. These have included promoting Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories from 2011, claiming that Ted Cruz's father was involved in the assassination of John F. Kennedy in 2016, and claiming that he would have won the popular vote in the 2016 election (in addition to his electoral college win) if there had not been \"millions\" of illegal voters in that election cycle. Trump also made his Trump Tower wiretapping allegations in 2017, for which the Department of Justice has said evidence has yet to be provided. In January 2018, Trump claimed that texts between FBI employees Peter Strzok and Lisa Page were tantamount to \"treason\", but the \"Wall Street Journal\" reviewed them and concluded that the texts \"show no evidence of a conspiracy against\" Trump. Glenn Kessler, Salvador Rizzo and Meg Kelly, writing for \"The Washington Post\", found that Trump has made over 3,000 false or misleading claims (including repeats) in the first 466 days of his presidency.\n\nAccording to NBC News, around July to August 2016, after Donald Trump had become the Republican nominee for president during the 2016 presidential election, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) \"briefed and warned\" Trump that foreign adversaries, which included Russia, would probably attempt to spy on and infiltrate his campaign. Trump was told to alert the FBI of any suspicious activity. White House spokesman Raj Shah acknowledged that \"the Republican and Democrat nominee for president received a standardized briefing on counterintelligence\" and said that NBC News learned \"about the contents of this classified conversation due to an inappropriate leak\".\n\nOn May 16, 2018, \"The New York Times\" reported the existence of a 2016 FBI investigation called Crossfire Hurricane, which investigated whether individuals within the Trump campaign had links to Russian efforts to undermine the presidential election. Four individuals, Michael T. Flynn, Paul Manafort, Carter Page and George Papadopoulos, were initially investigated due to obvious or suspected Russian ties. During the investigation, the FBI \"obtained phone records and other documents using national security letters, a secret type of subpoena\". \"The New York Times\" also reported that FBI agents (believing that Trump would lose the election and cognizant of Trump's claims that the election was rigged against him) took extreme care and caution to keep the investigation secret as they feared that Trump would blame his defeat on the revelation of the investigation. \n\nOn May 17, 2018, Trump quoted \"National Review\" columnist Andrew C. McCarthy, who had said: \"There's probably no doubt that [the FBI] had at least one confidential informant in the [Trump] campaign\". From that quote, Trump described that \"word seems to be coming out that the Obama FBI SPIED ON THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN ... If so, this is bigger than Watergate!\"\n\nAlthough an FBI informant, Stefan Halper, spoke separately to three Trump campaign advisers (Carter Page, Sam Clovis and George Papadopoulos) in 2016 in an effort to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections, there is no evidence that Halper actually tried to join Trump's campaign. Page said that he \"had extensive discussions\" with Halper on \"a bunch of different foreign-policy-related topics\". Clovis's attorney said that Clovis and Halper had discussed China during their sole meeting. Papadopoulos was paid $3,000 by Halper for a research paper on the oil fields of Turkey, Israel and Cyprus.\n\nOn May 22, 2018, Trump expanded on McCarthy's theory, alleging that the Barack Obama administration had paid to plant a spy inside the 2016 Trump presidential campaign \"very early on\" to assist Trump's rival, Hillary Clinton, win the 2016 US presidential election. From May 23, 2018, Trump began to describe his allegations as Spygate. The Associated Press reported that Trump privately said that he wanted \"to brand\" the informant as a \"spy\" as using a more nefarious term would supposedly resonate more with the public.\n\nDespite claiming that Spygate \"could be one of the biggest political scandals in history\", Trump has not offered any evidence when asked for it, instead saying, \"All you have to do is look at the basics and you'll see it.\"\n\nIn the May 22 tweets, Trump wrote that Halper, the FBI informant, was paid a \"massive amount of money\", and concluded that he thus must be a spy implanted for \"political purposes\". However, the $1 million in contracts were signed between Halper (a professor in international security) and the United States Department of Defense's Office of Net Assessment between 2012 to 2016, with 40% of the money awarded before Trump announced his candidacy in 2015. It is unknown if the FBI paid Halper at all. \n\nIn the May 23 tweets, Trump published a false quote attributed to former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper that \"Trump should be happy that the FBI was SPYING on his campaign\". Instead, when asked \"was the FBI spying on Trump’s campaign\", Clapper had said, \"No, they were not.\" What Clapper really said Trump should have been happy about was that the FBI was investigating “what the Russians were doing” and \"were the Russians infiltrating\" his campaign and trying to influence the election.\n\nOn May 26, 2018, Trump questioned \"why didn’t the crooked highest levels of the FBI or “Justice” contact me to tell me of the phony Russia problem?\" However, according to NBC News, Trump was warned by the FBI around July to August 2016 about possible Russian espionage and infiltration into his campaign.\n\nOn May 25, \"The Washington Post\" wrote that several conservative sources have sided with Trump to embrace and promote Spygate, including the \"Fox & Friends\" talk show and political commentators Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity for Fox News, the website Breitbart, and also radio show host Rush Limbaugh. Meanwhile, Infowars host Alex Jones took credit for coining the \"Spygate\" term.\n\nAsked on whether the promotion of the Spygate theory is meant to discredit the special counsel investigation, Trump’s attorney Rudy Giuliani said on May 27 that the investigators \"are giving us the material to do it. Of course, we have to do it in defending the president ... it is for public opinion\" on whether to \"impeach or not impeach\" Trump.\n\nOn June 5, Trump declared that \"SPYGATE is in full force!\", claiming without providing any evidence that \"Strzok-Page, the incompetent & corrupt FBI lovers, have texts referring to a counter-intelligence operation into the Trump Campaign dating way back to December, 2015.\" However, the December 2015 texts do not make any reference to the Trump campaign or Russia.\n\nThis particular conspiracy theory promoted by Trump was traced by media outlets to originate from a Twitter user called @Nick_Falco, who on June 4 posted about the words \"oconus lures\" in December 2015 texts between FBI employees Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. While \"oconus\" refers to \"outside the continental United States\", Falco inferred that \"lures\" refer to spies. However, according to the United States Department of Justice, \"lures\" refer to \"subterfuge to entice a criminal defendant to leave a foreign country so that he or she can be arrested\". Falco questioned if \"the FBI wanted to run a baited Sting Op using foreign agents against Trump\", despite none of the texts mentioning the Trump campaign or Russia.\nAlso on June 4, Falco's tweet spread to the \"r/conspiracy\" forum on Reddit, and also The Gateway Pundit, a far-right, pro-Trump website which has published multiple false conspiracy theories. The Gateway Pundit wrote an article entitled: \"Breaking: Senate releases unredacted texts showing FBI initiated MULTIPLE SPIES in Trump campaign in December 2015\". However, the texts referenced by Falco were publicly released by a Senate committee months earlier in February 2018. On June 5, Lou Dobbs of Fox Business said that \"the FBI may have initiated a number of spies into the Trump campaign as early as December of 2015.\" Dobbs' interviewee on the show, Chris Farrell, agreed that the existence of an \"intelligence operation directed against then-candidate Trump\" was \"indisputable\". Trump's June 5 tweet on Spygate came less than an hour after Dobbs' interview, with Trump also tweeting praise of Dobbs for the \"great interview\".\n\nAfter Trump made his June 5 tweet, Fox News described the news as \"New Strzok-Page texts released\", with Fox News television host Laura Ingraham saying: \"It certainly appears they were looking to put more lures into the campaign in 2015.\" Republican Representative Ron DeSantis, a panelist on Ingraham's show, agreed that it was \"clear\" that the FBI investigation into Trump started earlier than July 2016.\n\nTrey Gowdy, the Republican chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, said after a classified meeting with Department of Justice officials that \"the FBI is doing what [Trump] told them to do ... I am even more convinced that the FBI did exactly what my fellow citizens would want them to do when they got the information they got, and that it has nothing to do with Donald Trump\". Fellow Republicans, Paul Ryan, Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, and Richard Burr, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, have supported Gowdy's assessment of the situation.\n\nRepublican Representative Tom Rooney, who is on the House Intelligence Committee, chided Trump for creating \"this thing to tweet about knowing that it’s not true ... Maybe it’s just to create more chaos\". Republican senator Jeff Flake has said that the \"so-called Spygate\" is a \"diversion tactic, obviously\", while Republican senator Marco Rubio said that \"it appears that there was an investigation not of the campaign but of certain individuals who have a history that we should be suspicious of that predate the presidential campaign of 2015, 2016\".\n\nRepresentative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, has said that Spygate is \"lie-gate\", a \"piece of propaganda the president wants to put out and repeat\". He accused President Trump of repeatedly spreading baseless lies by quoting that \"people are saying ...\" or \"we’ve been told ...\" Michael Hayden, a retired general, former Director of the National Security Agency and former Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, said that Trump, through Spygate, was \"simply trying to delegitimize the Mueller investigation, the FBI, the Department of Justice, and he’s willing to throw almost anything against the wall\".\n\nJournalist Shepard Smith has said that \"Fox News can confirm that Spygate is not\" true; \"Fox News knows of no evidence to support the president's claim. Lawmakers from both parties say using an informant to investigate is not spying. It’s part of the normal investigative process.\" Legal analyst Andrew Napolitano concurred in telling Fox News that the FBI's usage of an informant was being done \"all the time\" and thus \"stunningly unremarkable\".\n\nJon Meacham, a presidential historian, has said, in regards to Spygate, \"The effect on the life of the nation of a president inventing conspiracy theories in order to distract attention from legitimate investigations or other things he dislikes is corrosive\".\n\nAaron Blake, writing for \"The Washington Post\", wrote that the \"central problem\" of the Spygate conspiracy theory is the \"fact that these people who supposedly would do anything to stop Trump ... didn't.\" In the period before the election, the FBI \"didn't use the information it had collected to actually prevent Trump from becoming president\", as it did not publicly reveal it was already investigating links between George Papadopoulos, Carter Page, Paul Manafort and Russia. Rather, the reports before the election were that the FBI saw no clear link between Russia and the Trump campaign, instead believing that Russia was trying to disrupt the election without purposely trying to elect Trump.\n\nSteven Poole, writing for \"The Guardian\", wrote that the real scandal was Trump even using the \"-gate\" suffix for the issue, as the Spygate allegations are about \"purely imaginary things\".\n\nFrom May 31 to June 5, 2018, Quinnipiac University conducted a national poll of 1,223 voting Americans regarding the Spygate allegations. With the margin for error being 3.4%, a majority of 56% believe that the FBI's usage of a confidential informant was \"routine procedure\", while 33% agree with Trump that the FBI was spying on the Trump campaign. The only group of voters with a majority believing Trump are Republicans at 66%.\n\nThe \"New York\" magazine addressed the June 2018 allegations by stating: \"It’s not surprising or scandalous that FBI agents would be using espionage tradecraft. Gateway Pundit seems to have invented the crucial factual element of the conspiracy out of thin air\" while \"Trump is citing right-wing conspiracy theorists who operate at a full level further removed from reality than the right-wing conspiracy theorists he customarily cites.\"\n\nZack Beauchamp of \"Vox\" wrote about the situation which was \"entirely unfounded in the actual evidence\" is that \"Fox picks up on some random internet rumor, the president picks it up from Fox, and then Fox and other right-wing outlets leap to defend what the president tweeted, which only reinforces Trump’s sense that he’s right.\"\n"}

{"id": "30179841", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30179841", "title": "The Denationalization of Money", "text": "The Denationalization of Money\n\nThe Denationalization of Money is a 1976 book by Friedrich Hayek, in which the author advocated the establishment of competitively issued private moneys. In 1978 Hayek published a revised and enlarged edition entitled Denationalization of Money: The Argument Refined, where he speculated that rather than entertaining an unmanageable number of currencies, markets would converge on one or only a limited number of monetary standards, on which institutions would base the issue of their notes.\n\nAccording to Hayek, instead of a national government issuing a specific currency, use of which is imposed on all members of its economy by force in the form of legal tender laws, private businesses should be allowed to issue their own forms of money, deciding how to do so on their own.\n\nHayek advocates a system of private currency in which financial institutions create currencies that compete for acceptance. Stability in value is presumed to be the decisive factor for acceptance. Hayek makes the assumption that competition will favor currencies with the greatest stability in value since a devalued currency hurts creditors, and an upward-revalued currency hurts debtors. Hence users would choose the monies which they expected to offer a mutually acceptable intersection between depreciation and appreciation. Hayek suggests that institutions may find through experimentation that an extensive basket of commodities forms the ideal monetary base. Institutions would issue and regulate their currency primarily through loan-making, and secondarily through currency buying and selling activities. It is postulated that the financial press would report daily information on whether institutions are managing their currencies within a previously-defined tolerance. Hayek's effort has been cited by economists George Selgin, Richard Timberlake, and Lawrence White.\n\nEconomist Milton Friedman was critical of Hayek's writings of the 1970s on monetary reform. Noting Hayek's vigorous defense of \"invisible hand\" evolution that Hayek claimed has created better economic institutions than could be created by rational design, Friedman pointed out the irony that Hayek was then proposing to replace the monetary system thus created with a deliberate construct of his own design. Moreover, Friedman noted, there is nothing in current law to prevent voluntary bilateral exchange via any medium freely accepted by two parties.\n\nIn a 1977 review of the book, economist David H. Howard also noted that Hayek neglected to address the extent to which existing monetary institutions evolved to meet real economic needs. Furthermore, Howard states, Hayek's regime of competitive moneys may result in the establishment of a new monopoly similar to the existing system. According to Howard, Hayek did not consider the real costs and other inefficiencies of a system of competing monies that might lead to such an outcome.\n\nAustrian School economist Lawrence H. White was critical of Hayek's assumption that the most stable currencies would win market acceptance.\n\n\n"}

It is thus an equivalent of Alethea, a female first name first used in England \"circa\" 1585, derived from the ancient and modern Greek feminine noun \"αλήθεια\" (pronounced \"al-ee-thia\"), meaning \"truth\". It was adopted in England as a Puritan virtue name, truthfulness being considered as a desirable attribute especially in a female. Verity was one of the most popular first names given to girls in Australia. It is especially associated with parts of Yorkshire and Northern England. Verity is also a surname, which may have more ancient unrelated origins, possibly being a corruption of a similar word. Notable people with the name include:\n\n\n\n"}

In its strongest, unqualified form, the principle of wholistic reference is the proposition that each and every proposition, regardless how limited the referents of its non-logical or content terms, refers to the whole of its universe of discourse. According to this principle every proposition of number theory, even an equational proposition such as 5 + 7 = 12, refers not only to the individual numbers that it happens to mention but to the whole universe of numbers. The relation verb ‘refers’ is being used in its broad sense (loosely “is about”) and not as a synonym for ‘names’ in the sense of “is a name of”.\n\nGeorge Boole (1815–1864) introduced this principle into modern logic: Even though he changed from a monistic fixed-universe framework in his 1840s writings to a pluralistic multiple-universe framework in 1854, he never wavered in his frank avowal of the principle of wholistic reference. Indeed, he took it as an essential accompaniment to his theory of concept formation and proposition formation. For Boole, the essential first step in the process of conceiving of a proposition preliminary to making a judgement of its truth or falsity – or even using it in a deduction, however hypothetically – was to conceive of the universe of discourse. See Boole 1854/2003, xxi, 27, 42, 43. One statement of his principle is in the sentence immediately following his definition of universe of discourse, which is his first use of the expression 'universe of discourse' and probably the first in the history of the English language. See the next section.\n\nSimilar views, perhaps not similarly motivated, are found in later logicians, including Gottlob Frege (1848–1925). Some recent formulations of standard one-sorted first-order logic seem to be in accord with a form of it, if they do not actually imply the principle itself.\n"}

The WKM’s chief object is to foster goodwill among the broad community – local, national and international – by way of collaborations in kindness and in so doing, create greater understanding and co-operation between all people and all nations throughout the world. WKM is a worldwide coalition of the Good-Willing various \"kindness movements\"—organizations that study and promote improved individual and collective human behavior. The movement was initially conceptualized in 1997 with the aim of bringing like minded kindness movements across the globe together. The current members of the movement represent 27 nations including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, India, Italy, Japan, Liberia, Nepal, Malaysia, Mexico, Netherlands, Pakistan, New Zealand, Nigeria, Oman, Romania, Scotland, South Korea, South Africa, Switzerland, Thailand, United Arab Emirates, Ukraine, United Kingdom and 10 organisations from the USA.\n\nThe idea of a World Kindness Movement was conceived at a Tokyo conference in 1996 when founders of the Small Kindness Movement in Japan brought together like-minded individuals from around the world who had started kindness movements in their own countries. They were led by Dr. Wataru Mori, a physician in Tokyo, who envisioned that a more compassionate and peaceful world could be achieved if a critical mass of acts of kindness was ignited.\n\nA second conference was held in 1997 in which the World Kindness Movement was formed. The founding members of the movement were Japan, Singapore, Australia, Canada, Thailand, the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nDuring the 1999 World Kindness Movement conference in Tokyo, the cosmos bipinnatus was adopted as the official flower for the organization.\n\nThe movement was then officially launched in Singapore in November 2000 at the Third WKM Conference, hosted by the Singapore Kindness Movement. The conference saw 33 delegates from 22 countries.\n\nIn 2003, the Singapore Kindness Movement assumed the role of secretariat of the movement.\nThe Random Acts of Kindness Foundation is one of the United States delegates of the movement.\n\nIn 1997 a second conference was held in which the World Kindness Movement was formed.

Singapore indicated it wished to pass the kindness torch on and see the secretariat hosted by another nation referring to the 6th General Assembly host as a potential secretariat in waiting. The meeting was chaired by Mr Rodney Tan, Vice President of Singapore Kindness Movement. Many ideas were put forward including adopting a yellow flower hand out for World Kindness Day on 13 November and giving thought to establishing a World Kindness Youth Council. Delegates were taken to Rose Bay Secondary College where teachers and students hosted a morning tea and presented the school initiative for kindness. Using the school's radio studio, they taped a student interview with Michelle Tay from Singapore and Will Glennon from the USA.\n\n2012 On 20 September, the 7th General Assembly in London, hosted by Kindness UK, Australia was officially appointed as the new secretariat with Mr Michael Lloyd-White, Chairman and Founding Director of World Kindness Australia, being elected by the international members as the General Secretary. The assembly brought significant constitutional changes, which now include an International Council and the change to a generic domain name of www.theworldkindnessmovement.org.
