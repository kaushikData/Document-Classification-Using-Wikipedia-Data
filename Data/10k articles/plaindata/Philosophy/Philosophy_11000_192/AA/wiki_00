The book has come to be regarded as \"one of the most influential books on Zen in the West\".\n\nThe book grew out of Suzuki's 1914 publications for the Japanese journal \"New East\". Although the editor, Robertson Scott, suggested that Suzuki publish them in book form, he did not decide to do so until after the 1927 publication of his book \"Zen Essays\", which he decided would be \"too heavy\" as an introduction to Zen for beginners. Suzuki intended the resultant volume, 1934's \"An Introduction to Zen Buddhism\", to be used as a companion with the contemporaneously published \"Manual of Zen Buddhism\".\n\n\"An Introduction to Zen Buddhism\" was published in 1934 in Kyoto by the Eastern Buddhist Society. The Marshall Jones Company of Boston oversaw first publication in the United States. The 1939 German language edition was published with a preface by Carl Jung. In 1949, the book was reprinted in London and New York with Jung's preface, translated by Constance Rolfe, included.\n"}

The idea of establishing a place dedicated to Meher Baba in the warmer climate of Australia grew out of a letter from Meher Baba's sister and disciple, Mani Irani. On 11 January 1958, she wrote to the Australian group of followers, indicating that Meher Baba wished to give his Sahavas (company) in Australia at one place only, and that Baba would \"like Queensland if the climate is good during June, and if the place is practical.\" In 1958, using money inherited from the Australian Sufi leader Baron Von Frankenburg, Brabazon found and finalised the purchase of an eighty-two-acre pineapple farm on Kiels Mountain, Woombye, Queensland, after receiving Meher Babas' approval by telegram. Baba wrote on the telegram on 2 February 1958 'Place secured by you excellently suitable'.\n\nDuring 1958, Francis Brabazon and Bill Le Page, along with three paid workers from Queensland and with the help of several people from Sydney and Melbourne, worked hard (often in the rain) to have the site ready in time to welcome Baba. While he was there in 1958, Baba named the area Avatar's Abode and said it would become a place of world pilgrimage. Avatar's Abode is one of three main centres set up worldwide, the other being Meher Spiritual Center and the \"samadhi\" (tomb-shrine) in Meherabad, India.\n\nBrabazon lived in India for ten years with Meher Baba from 1959 to 1969; as a result he was released from the work associated with Australia. In 1967 Baba told Brabazon to 'transfer Avatar's Abode to Bill Le Page who will, when the time is ripe, form a trust of which he will be chairman and turn the place over to it'.\n\nBaba gave clear cut objectives to Le Page for Avatar's Abode's development, setting an objective of making Avatar's Abode universally known and one of the great places of pilgrimage in the world. Baba was consulted about the legal structure and approved a proprietary limited company; he also chose the name \"Meher Holdings\" and approved the directors, Brabazon and Le Page.\n\nIn 1979 significant numbers of the Baba community started a petition questioning Le Pages methods After several years of stalemate, a deal was brokered in 1984 by Eruch Jessawala and a new company \"Avatar's Abode Pty. Ltd.\" was created to accommodate local concerns brought about by the petition. \"Meher Baba Foundation Australia\" functioned concurrently with the new company after discussions with Eruch Jessawala in India.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4642940", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4642940", "title": "Compartment (development)", "text": "Compartment (development)\n\nCompartments can be simply defined as separate, different, adjacent cell populations, which upon juxtaposition, create a lineage boundary. This boundary prevents cell movement from cells from different lineages across this barrier, restricting them to their compartment. Subdivisions are established by morphogen gradients and maintained by local cell-cell interactions, providing functional units with domains of different regulatory genes, which give rise to distinct fates.\nCompartment boundaries are found across species. In the hindbrain of vertebrate embryos, rhobomeres are compartments of common lineage outlined by expression of Hox genes. In invertebrates, the wing imaginal disc of \"Drosophila\" provides an excellent model for the study of compartments. Although other tissues, such as the abdomen, and even other imaginal discs are compartmentalized, much of our understanding of key concepts and molecular mechanisms involved in compartment boundaries has been derived from experimentation in the wing disc of the fruit fly.\n\nBy separating different cell populations, the fate of these compartments are highly organized and regulated. In addition, this separation creates a region of specialized cells close to the boundary, which serves as a signaling center for the patterning, polarizing and proliferation of the entire disc. Compartment boundaries establish these organizing centers by providing the source of morphogens that are responsible for the positional information required for development and regeneration.\nThe inability of cell competition to occur across the boundary, indicates that each compartment serves as an autonomous unit of growth. Differences in growth rates and patterns in each compartment, maintain the two lineages separated and each control the precise size of the imaginal discs.\n\nThese two cell populations are kept separate by a mechanism of cell segregation linked to the heritable expression of a selector gene. A selector gene is one that is expressed in one group of cells but not the other, giving the founder cells and their descendants different instructions. Eventually these selector genes become fixed in either an expressed or unexpressed state and are stably inherited to the descendants, specifying the identity of the compartment and preventing these genetically different cell populations from intermixing. Therefore, these selector genes are key for the formation and maintenance of lineage compartments.\n\nThe difference in selector gene activity not only establishes two compartments, but also leads to the formation of a boundary between these two that serves as a source of morphogen gradients. In the central dogma of compartments, first, morphogen gradients position founder compartment cells. Then, active/inactive selector genes give a unique genetic identity to cells within a compartment, instructing their fate and their interactions with the neighboring compartment. Finally, border cells, established by short-range signaling from one compartment to its neighboring compartment emit long-range signals that spread to both compartments to regulate the growth and pattering of the entire tissue.\n\nIn 1970, by means of clonal analysis, the Anterior-Posterior boundary was identified. The founder cells, found at the border between parasegments 4 and 5 of embryo, are already determined at the early blastoderm stage and defined into the two populations they will generate by stripes of the engrailed gene.\nThe selector gene, \"engrailed (en)\", is a key determinant in boundary formation between the anterior and posterior compartments. As the wing imaginal disc expands, posterior, but not anterior cells will express engrailed and maintain this expression state as they expand and form the disc. Engrailed mutant clones of posterior origin will gain anterior affinity and move towards the anterior compartment and intermix with those cells. Within the posterior compartment these clones will sort out and form an ectopicborder where they meet other posterior cells.\nSimilarly, a clone of anterior cells expressing engrailed will gain posterior identity and create an ectopic boundary where the clone meets other anterior cells in this compartment.\nIn addition,to its cell autonomous role in specifying posterior compartment identity, \"engrailed\" also has a non-cell autonomous function in the general growth and patterning of the wing disc, through the activation of signaling pathways such as Hedgehog (Hh) and Decapentaplegic (Dpp).\nThe presence of engrailed in the posterior cells leads to the secretion of the short-range inducer Hh which can cross over to the anterior compartment to activate the long-range morphogen, Dpp. Cells in the posterior compartment produce Hh, but only anterior cells can transduce the signal.\n\"Optomotor-blind (omb)\" is involved in the transcriptional response of Dpp, which is only required in the anterior cells to interpret Hh signaling for boundary formation and maintenance.\nIn addition, Cubitus interruptus \"(Ci)\", the signal transducer of the Hh signal, is expressed throughout the anterior compartment, particularly in anterior border cells. In posterior cells engrailed prevents the expression of \"Ci\", such it is only expressed in anterior cells and hence only these cells can respond to Hh signaling by up-regulating the expression of \"dpp\".\nLoss of engrailed function in posterior cells, results in anterior transformation, where Hh expression is decreased and \"dpp\", \"ci\" and \"patched\" (ptc) is increased, resulting in the formation of a new A/P boundary, suggesting that \"en\" positively regulates\" hh\", while negatively regulating \"ci\",\" ptc\" and \"dpp\".\n\nTo explain how anterior and posterior cells are kept separated, the differential adhesion hypothesis proposes that these two cell populations express different adhesion molecules, producing different affinities for each other that minimize their contact.\nThe selector affinity model proposes that difference in cell affinity between compartments is a result of differential selector gene expression. The presence or absence of selector genes in a given compartment produces compartment-specific adhesion or recognition molecules that are different from those in its counterpart.\nFor example, \"engrailed\" expressed in the posterior, but not the anterior, cells provides the differential affinity that keeps these compartments separately.\nIt is also possible that this difference in cell adhesion/affinity is not directly due to \"en\" expression, but rather to the ability to receive Hh signaling. Anterior cells, capable of Hh transduction, will express given adhesive molecules that would differ from those present in posterior cells, creating differential affinity that would prevent them from intermixing.\nThis signaling-affinity model is supported by experiments that demonstrate the importance of Hh signaling. Clones mutant for the \"Smoothened (smo)\", the gene responsible for transducing Hh signaling, retain anterior-like features, but move into the posterior compartment without any changes in the expression \"engrailed\" or invected. This demonstrates that Hh signaling, rather than the absence of en, is what gives cells their compartmental identity. Nonetheless, this signaling-affinity model is incomplete: \"smo\" mutant clones of anterior origin that migrate into the posterior compartment, do not completely associate with these cells, but rather form a smooth boundary with these posterior cells. If signaling-affinity were the only factor determining compartment identity, then these clones, which are no longer receiving Hh signaling, would have the same affinity as the other posterior cells in that compartment and be able to intermix with them.\nThese experiments indicate that although Hh signaling could be having an effect in adhesive properties, this effect is limited to the border cells rather than throughout both compartments.\nIt is also possible that both compartments produce the same cell adhesion molecules, but a difference in its abundance or activity could result in sorting between the two compartments. In vitro, transfected cells with high levels of a given adhesion molecule will segregate from cells that expressing lower levels of this same molecule.\nFinally, differences in cell bond tension could also play a role in the establishment of the boundary and the separation of the two different cell populations. Experimental data has shown that Myosin-II is up-regulated along both the dorsal-ventral and anterior-posterior boundaries in the imaginal wing disc. The D/V boundary is characterized by the presence of filamentous actin and mutations in Myosin-II heavy chain impairs D/V compartmentalization. Similarly, both F-actin and Myosin-II are increased along the A/P boundary, accompanied by a decrease of \"Bazooka\", which was also observed in the D/V border. The Rho-kinase inhibitor Y-27632, of which Myosin-II is the main target, significantly reduces cell bond tension, suggesting that Myosin-II could be the main effector of this process. In support of the signaling-affinity model, creating an artificial interface between cells with active vs. inactive Hh signaling induces a junctional behavior that aligns the cell bonds of where these opposing cell types meet. Moreover, a 2.5-fold increase in mechanical tension is observed along the A/P boundary, compared to the rest of the tissue. Simulations using a vertex model demonstrate that this increase in cell bond tension is enough to maintain proliferating cell populations in separate compartment boundaries. Parameters used to measure cell bond tension are based cell-cell adhesion and cortical tension input.\nIt has also been suggested that boundary formation is not a result of differential mechanical tension between the two cell populations, but could be a result of the mechanical properties of the boundary itself.\nThe level the adhesion molecule, E-cadherin, was unaltered and the biophysical properties of cells between the two compartments were the same. Changes in cell properties, such as an enlarged apical cross-section area, are only observed in anterior and posterior border cells. Along the boundary, orientation of cell divisions was random and there is no evidence that increased cell death or zones of non-proliferating cells are important for maintaining the A/P or D/V boundary.\n\nDespite many attempts to identify the adhesion molecules important for the establishment and maintenance of compartment boundaries, none have been identified. Continuation of our understanding of this process will benefit from further experimental data on cell bonds and cortical tension, as well as screens to identify molecules regulating differential cell affinity.\n"}

He was one of the most influential public intellectuals in post-World War II Slovenia.\n\nDušan Pirjevec was born in Solkan, which was then a suburb of the Italian town of Gorizia. His birth house is now located in the Slovenian town of Nova Gorica. His father was the literary historian Avgust Pirjevec from Gorizia; his mother, Iva née Mozetič, came from a wealthy merchant family from Solkan. His sister, Ivica Pirjevec, later became a famous anti-Nazi resistance hero and was captured and killed by the Nazis in 1944 (a street in the Ljubljana neighbourhood of Tacen in the Šmarna Gora District bears her name). Soon after Dušan's birth, the family moved to Ljubljana, in what was then the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, where his father worked as the chief librarian of the National Research Library. Dušan attended the Ljubljana Technical High School, and in 1939 he enrolled in the University of Zagreb, where he studied agronomy. In 1940, he joined the Communist Party of Yugoslavia.\n\nAlready in his teenage years, Pirjevec developed an interest in literature, especially in the French poètes maudits. In the years before World War II, he published several articles under different pseudonyms in the distinguished liberal-progressive literary journal \"Ljubljanski zvon\". Together with the young poet Karel Destovnik Kajuh, he was the co-editor of the radical magazine \"Svobodna mladina\" (\"The Free Youth\").\n\nIn the early 1940s, he took part of the \"Conflict on the Literary Left\", a polemics involving the critical Croatian left-wing writer Miroslav Krleža against the Communist Party's ideological hardliners around Boris Ziherl and Edvard Kardelj. In the polemics, was largely evolving around the relation between personal artistic freedom and collective revolutionary engagement, Pirjevec defended Krleža's insistence on artistic freedom, trying to show that it is not in conflict with a Marxist Leninist position.\n\nSoon after the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, Pirjevec joined the partisan resistance in the Liberation Front of the Slovenian People, adopting the battle name Ahac, by which he remained known for the rest of his life. In late 1941, he was involved in the fight against the Italian Fascist occupation regime in the so-called Province of Ljubljana. He chose the fighting name \"Ahac\" (Agathius). The choice was highly symbolic: since the late 16th, Saint Agathius was venerated in the Slovene Lands as the patron saint against Turkish invasions, and in the 17th century he was also venerated as the saint protector of Carniola.\n\nHis talent in organization was spotted by the Communist leader Aleš Bebler who secured Pirjevec's promotion to the rank of political commissar in the military units active in Lower Carniola. During this time, he became notorious for his bellicosity and brutal treatment of opponents. In a highly controversial memoir published posthumously in 1990, fellow fighter and famous essayist Jože Javoršek even accused Pirjevec of burning war prisoners alive. He was also involved in an internal enquiry over the massacre of a group of Romani people in the region of White Carniola in 1942, but was acquitted. In 1943, he was sent to organize the resistance fight to the Slovenian Littoral and to Friulian Slovenia in Italy, and in 1944 to southern Carinthia.\n\nAfter the end of the War, Pirjevec was placed in the propaganda units of the newly established Communist regime in Slovenia. Between 1945 and 1947, he worked as the editor of the daily journal \"Ljudska pravica\" (\"People's Justice\"), the main Communist newspaper in Slovenia. There, he met the literary critic Bojan Štih, who introduced him to contemporary trends in literature. In 1947, Pirjevec became the chairman of the Agitprop section at the University of Ljubljana. During this period, he became a close personal friend with Vitomil Zupan, with whom he engaged in several provocations of what they saw as the \"reactionary and petit bourgeoise\" cultural scene in Ljubljana. In summer 1948, he was arrested and trialed in a show trial for numerous severe crimes, such as subversive activity, immoral acts and rape. Unlike his close personal friend who was arrested and accused of the same crimes in the same trial, Pirjevec was sentenced to a relatively mild sentence of two years in prison. He was released already after half a year, and put on probation. He was excluded from the Communist Party and stripped of all his war honours.\n\nBetween 1948 and 1952, Pirjevec studied French language and comparative literature at the University of Ljubljana under the supervision of the famous literary historian Anton Ocvirk. Between 1952 and 1961, he was employed as a clerk at the Institute for Literature of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts, later rising to the position of personal assistant to the Institute's president Josip Vidmar.\n\nIn 1958, Pirjevec became an assistant at the Department for Comparative Literature of the University of Ljubljana. In 1959, he was actively involved the so-called \"Slodnjak affair\", when the conservative-minded literary historian Anton Slodnjak was dismissed from his post of professor of Slovene literature for having published an anthology of Slovene literature in Germany, which included several authors which were not well viewed by the Communist regime. The same year, Pirjevec was admitted again to the Communist Party.\n\nBetween 1961 and 1962, Pirjevec started a long polemic with the Serbian writer Dobrica Ćosić regarding the cultural policies in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In contrast to Ćosić, who argued for a more unified and centralized cultural policy in Yugoslavia, Pirjevec defended the cultural autonomy of the single republics in the Yugoslav federation. The polemic gave Pirjevec a high degree of public visibility.\n\nIn 1961, Pirjevec achieved his PhD in comparative literature and in 1963 he became a professor at the Faculty of Arts of the University of Ljubljana. In the late 1960s, he rose to prominence among students as a charismatic professor. The Department of Comparative Literature, where he taught, became one of the most vibrant centers of Slovene intellectual scene of the 1960s and 1970s. Among Pirjevec's pupils were Dimitrij Rupel, Niko Grafenauer, Rudi Šeligo, Andrej Inkret and many other intellectuals who later formed the core of the intellectual movement focused around the alternative journal \"Nova revija\". In this period, Pirjevec also developed a close friendship with literary historian Taras Kermauner and philosopher Ivo Urbančič, who represented critical positions towards the existing Communist system. In 1964, Pirjevec criticized the regime's decision to prohibit the publication of the alternative journal \"Perspektive\", and was again expulsed from the Party for this reason.\n\nIn the 1960s, Pirjevec published several monographs on modern Slovene literature, focusing especially on the fin-de-siecle period. Most famous were his studies on the writer and essayist Ivan Cankar. He also published numerous studies of classical works of the western canon, in which the most famous is his treatise on the problem of evil in the works of Dostoyevski. He based his scholarly research on the esthetic theories of Hegel, Georg Lukács and Mikhail Bakhtin, but also on Sartre's existential philosophy and Roman Ingarden phenomenology of the literary science. He was also receptive to currents coming from the new historicism.\n\nDuring this period, Pirjevec maintained close contacts with the Praxis School, which was trying to formulate an alternative and humanist vision of Marxism. He was also member of the Committee of the famous Korčula Summer School organized by the \"Praxis\" group. Between 1969 and 1971, he served as editor of the Slovenian journal \"Sodobnost\".\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, Pirjevec was sympathetic to the student movement that developed at the University of Ljubljana. In 1971, he joined the protests against the arrest of two students of the University, Frane Adam and Milan Jesih, which escalated in the occupation of the Faculty of Arts by the students.\n\nFrom the 1970s, Pirjevec gradually left his previous Marxist positions. Under the influence of the philosopher Ivan Urbančič, he grew increasingly closer to the philosophy of Martin Heidegger, whom he personally met in 1974.\n\nHe died in Ljubljana on August 4, 1977 and was buried in the cemetery of Šmartno pod Šmarno goro.\n\nPirjevec was married twice. His first wife was his partisan co-fighter, the university professor of French language Marjeta Vasič, the second was the actress and later writer Nedeljka Kacin. His daughter Alenka Pirjevec is a famous theatre actress and puppeteer. His second daughter with Slovenian journalist Olga Ratej is a Slovenian dramaturg Ira Ratej.\n\nTogether with Edvard Kocbek, Pirjevec is considered one of the most influential intellectuals in Slovenia in the period between 1945 and 1980. He influenced not only literary critic and history, but also philosophers such as Tine Hribar, Ivan Urbančič, Dean Komel and Croatian philosopher Mario Kopić. He was crucial in the intellectual development of several public figures, among whom the most famous was writer and sociologist Dimitrij Rupel, who later became the first Slovenian foreign minister. Pirjevec was portrayed in several novels and memoirs, including Gert Hofmann's \"Die Fistelstimme\" (1982) Milan Dekleva's \"Oko v zraku\" (\"The Eye in the Air\"), Iztok Osojnik's \"Braşow\" in Rudi Šeligo's \"Izgubljeni sveženj\" (\"The Lost Bundle\"), and Taras Kermauner's \"Navzkrižna srečavanja\" (\"Crossed Encounters\").\n\nPirjevec's view on the national question, articulated in polemics with the ideologue of Yugoslav Socialism Edvard Kardelj, was particularly influential among the dissident Slovene intellectuals of the late 1970s and 1980s. Pirjevec was the single most quoted author in the \"Contributions to the Slovenian National Program\", a public manifesto written by 16 non-Communist intellectuals in 1987, which is frequently seen as the beginning of the Slovene movement for independence that culminated in the declaration of independence of Slovenia in 1991.\n\nIn 1997, a bust of Pirjevec was erected in the hall of the Faculty of Arts of the University of Ljubljana. In 1998, a memorial plaque was placed in his native house in Nova Gorica.\n\n"}
{"id": "1949181", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1949181", "title": "Eugène Minkowski", "text": "Eugène Minkowski\n\nEugène (Eugeniusz) Minkowski (; 17 April 1885 – 17 November 1972) was a French psychiatrist of Jewish Polish origin, known for his incorporation of phenomenology into psychopathology and for exploring the notion of \"lived time\". A student of Eugen Bleuler, he was also associated with the work of Ludwig Binswanger and Henri Ey. He was influenced by the phenomenological philosophy and the vitalistic philosophy of Henri Bergson, and by the phenomenologists Edmund Husserl and Max Scheler; therefore his work departed from classical medical and psychological models. He was a prolific author in several languages and regarded as a great humanitarian. Minkowski accepted the phenomenological essence of schizophrenia as the “trouble générateur” (\"generating disorder\") as he thought that it consists in a loss of “vital contact with reality” and shows itself as autism.\n\nMinkowski was born in Saint Petersburg, the capital of the Russian Empire, into a Jewish Polish family. He was second of the four sons of August Minkowski, a Warsaw banker and his wife, Tekla, née Lichtenbaum. When he was 7 years old, the family returned to the Polish capital where he attended school and started his medical studies at the Imperial University of Warsaw. However, due to political repression from the czarist government, the university was temporarily closed in 1905. He was obliged to continue his studies at Breslau University (3 semesters), at Göttingen University (2 semesters) and finally, at Munich University (3 semesters) where he obtained his medical degree in 1909. As a Russian subject, he went on to practice medicine in Kazan to obtain Russian certification, and while there, met his future wife, Franciszka Brokman, also a doctor and later known as 'Françoise'. They married in 1913. The couple settled in Munich, where Françoise pursued further work in psychiatry while Eugène took up the study of mathematics and philosophy, attending lectures by Alexander Pfänder and Moritz Geiger, pupils of Edmund Husserl. In Munich he became acquainted with Germanic philosophy. The outbreak of World War I forced them to seek refuge in Zürich with Minkowski's brother, Mieczysław (Michel). There, Minkowski and his wife both became assistants to Eugen Bleuler at the Burghölzli, a university clinic where Carl Gustav Jung and Ludwig Binswanger had practised earlier. In 1914 he finished a work entitled \"Les éléments essentiels du temps-qualité\" – \"The Essential Elements of Time-Quality\". At the beginning of the World War I Minkowski volunteered in the French Army in 1915 as a military medic. In 1915, the couple had a son, Alexandre Minkowski, later a pioneer of French neonatology and father of the noted orchestra conductor, Marc Minkowski, followed in 1918 by a daughter, Jeannine, a lawyer. In the war he saw action at the Battle of the Somme and at Battle of Verdun, where his bravery earned him several citations and military decorations, including the Croix de Guerre. He became an officer of the Legion of Honour and obtained French nationality. In France Minkowski came under the influence of the famous French philosopher Henri Bergson, whose views are considered unscientific and opposing the secular. Minkowski was convinced that psychopathology should be closer to philosophy and closer to individual philosopher's views. For Minkowski this philosopher was Bergson. \n\nAfter the war he said:\n\n\"During the war we were waiting for peace, hoping to take up again the life that we had abandoned. In reality, a new period began, a period of difficulties and deceptions, of setbacks and painful, often fruitless efforts to adapt oneself to new problems of existence. The calm propitious to philosophic thought was far from reborn. Long, arid, and somber years followed the war. My work lay dormant at the bottom of my drawer\".\nAfter World War I, when his enlistment came to an end, he adopted French nationality. The family moved again to Paris permanently and Minkowski returned to medicine and partially abandoned his philosophical pursuits. He worked on the perception of time as a vector in psychopathology, drawing heavily on his unpublished work on Bergson, whom he had known personally. In 1925 he became one of the co-founders of a movement and a French journal in psychiatry, known as \"L'Évolution psychiatrique\" – \"The Psychiatric Evolution\". \"L'Évolution psychiatrique\" introduced the work of Eugen Bleuler and several other psychiatrists, such as Karl Jaspers and Ludwig Binswanger. Directors of \"l'Ėvolution psychiatrique\" were A. Hesnard and R. Laforgue. Original works and critical studies in the journal have been made by messieurs R. Allendy, A. Borel, A. Ceillier, H. Claude, H. Codet, J. Damourette, A. Hesnard, R. Laforgue, M F. Minkowska, E. Minkowski, É Pichon, Robin, R. de Saussure, Schiff and J. Vinchon. Minkowski has published articles in 1925 to the first volume of \"L'Ėvolution psychiatrique\" – \"La Génèse de la Notion de Schizophrénie et ses Caractères Essentiels\" – \"Genesis of the Notion of Schizophrenia and its Essential Features\" and as a bonus he published a page about the modern history of psychiatry.\n\nIn 1926 he wrote a doctoral thesis on \"La notion de perte de contact avec la réalité et ses applications en psychopathologie\" – \"The Notion of Loss of Contact with Reality and its Applications in Psychopathology\", which was based on the works of Henri Bergson and Eugen Bleuler, and began work at Sainte-Anne's Psychiatric Hospital, a leading mental hospital in Paris. By the way, he also supported Bleuler's concept of the schizophrenic autism. Eugène Minkowski thought that autism is the patient's loss of vital contact with reality (\"perte de contact vital avec la réalité\"). He distinguished two types of the schizophrenic autism: 'rich or florid autism' (\"autisme riche\") & 'poor autism' (\"autisme pauvre\"), i.e. autism characterized by affective and cognitive \"poverty\".. But Minkowski disagreed with Eugen Bleuler on several points. First, he didn't believe that the necessary component of autism is \"the predominance of the inner fantasy life\". In truth, he claimed that a typical schizophrenic patient has the \"poor autism\" which he described by the poverty of affective and cognitive processes. On that subject, he also criticized Bleuler's description of schizophrenic autism together with Emil Kraepelin. Minkowski claimed that \"rich autism\" happened only when a schizophrenic patient was equipped with an autism-independent inclination towards affective and cognitive expressivity. Just as important, Minkowski considered autism as a both fundamental and primary disorder of schizophrenia. Other psychopathological features of schizophrenia could be comprehended (\"trouble générateur\").\n\nIn 1927 he published \"La Schizophrénie\" on schizophrenia, followed in 1933, by \"Le Temps vécu. Études phénoménologique et psychopathologiques\" – \"Lived Time. Phenomenological and Psychopathological Studies\". In this, his only book published in English, Minkowski sought to use phenomenology as an approach to psychopathology. He proposed that the pathology of patients should always be interpreted in light of their subjective experience of time. Unable initially to find a publisher he funded a thousand copies himself. It was eventually published by J.L.L. d'Artrey to whom Minkowski dedicated the new edition of the work.\nMinkowski was in the Resistance during World War II and directed the work of a charity to protect children from the Shoah, which saved thousands of Jewish children. In 1946 he gave one of the first Basel lectures on the psychological suffering during Nazi persecution and went on to testify as an expert witness in numerous subsequent lawsuits. He was the author of some 250 clinical papers and publications. Eugène Minkowski died in 1972. His funeral was attended by a large crowd, including his psychiatrist friend and collaborator, Henri Ey.\n\nPhilosophically, Minkowski was influenced by Bergson and the phenomenologist Max Scheler, who had developed separate accounts of Time, (see Bergson's 1889 work \"Time and Free Will\" and his analyses of the irrational nature of time). Following Bergson's account of élan vital, Minkowski developed what he named as \"vital energy\", an account of the essence of time.\nHe was also attracted by the practice of the Swiss psychiatrist, Eugen Bleuler and attempted to synthesize ideas from psychiatry with philosophy, taking an approach similar to Karl Jaspers. He introduced phenomenology as part of his investigations into psychopathology. He sought thereby to explain the experience of patients who appeared to suffer from distortions of time and/or space. Minkowski's first research into the psychopathology of schizophrenia was inspired by Bergson and appeared in his 1927 work \"La Schizophrénie\", which he thought was \"due to a deficiency of intuition, a sense of time and to a progressive hypertrophy of the grasp of spatial factors\". Based on his dissertation, he considered that schizophrenic patients display a \"loss of vital contact with reality\" unlike others who experienced life as a \"lived synchronism\" or what he called \"syntony\", a notion borrowed from Ernst Kretschmer. According to R.D. Laing, Minkowski made \"the first serious attempt in psychiatry to reconstruct the other person's lived experience\" and was \"the first figure in psychiatry to bring the nature of phenomenological investigations clearly into view\". He is quoted on the first page of Laing's classic \"The Divided Self\":\n\n\"Je donne une œuvre subjective ici, œuvre cependant qui tend de toutes ses forces vers l'objectivité.\" I offer you a subjective work, but a work which nevertheless struggles with all its might towards objectivity.\n\nHe was awarded honorary doctorates by the University of Zurich in 1955 and the University of Warsaw in 1965.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese include:\n\n\n"}

He was known as a defender of Platonism and an opponent of Aristotelianism. In Croatia he is mostly referred to as Franjo Petriš or Frane Petrić (sometimes \"Petris\", \"Petrišević\" and \"Petričević\"). His family name in Cres was known as Petris.\n\nFranciscus Patricius was born in Cres (Italian: \"Cherso\"), today in Croatia, then the territory of the Republic of Venice. According to the family legend, the Petriš family (Patricius was his Latin name) was of noble (patrician) origin from Kingdom of Bosnia and was forced to flee from the crumbling Bosnian kingdom after the Ottoman invasion.\n\nAs a young man, he traveled the Mediterranean with his uncle Georgius (Juraj) Patricius, who commanded a galley in the wars against the Ottoman Empire. He gained the patronage of the Greek Orthodox Bishop of Cyprus, who brought him to Venice, where his abilities were immediately recognized. He studied economy in Venice, then he moved to study in Ingolstadt under the patronage of his cousin Matthias Flacius (Matija Vlačić). Then he went to study medicine and philosophy at the University of Padova. Here he was elected twice as a representative of the students from Dalmatia.\n\nAfter graduation he lived in different cities in Italy: Ancona, Rome, Bologna, Ferrara, Venice. He later moved to Cyprus where he spent seven years. Here he attended upon the Bishop of Cyprus who send him back to Italy, where he traveled to Venice, Padova, Genoa, and even to Barcelona.\n\nHe finally went to live in Ferrara, a center of Platonism in Italy, where he was appointed to the chair of philosophy at the University of Ferrara by Duke Alfonso II. He was subsequently invited in Rome by Pope Clement VIII in 1592, where he spent five years as the chair of Platonic philosophy. Here he became a member of the Council of St. Jerome, at the Illyrian College of St. Jerome.\n\nPatricius died in Rome, and he was buried in the church of Sant'Onofrio, in the tomb of his colleague Torquato Tasso.\n\nIn spite of his continual controversies with the Aristotelians, Patricius managed to make a comprehensive study of contemporary science, publishing in 15 books a treatise on the \"New Geometry\" (1587), as well as works on history, rhetoric and the art of war. He studied ancient theories of music, and is said to have invented the thirteen-syllable verse form known subsequently as \"versi martelliani\". In his philosophy he was mainly concerned to defend Plato against the followers of Aristotle.\n\nHis two great works, \"Discussionum peripateticorum libri XV\" (Basel, 1571), and \"Nova de universis philosophia\" (\"New Philosophy of Universes\", Basel, 1591), developed the view that, whereas Aristotle's teaching was in direct opposition to Christianity, Plato, on the contrary, foreshadowed the Christian revelation and prepared the way for its acceptance. In the earlier treatise he attacks the life and character of Aristotle, impugns the authenticity of almost all his works, and attempts to refute his doctrines from a theological standpoint. In the second and greater work he goes back to the theories and methods of the Ionians and the Presocratics in general.\n\nPatricius' theory of the universe is that, from God there emanated Light which extends throughout space and is the explanation of all development. This Light is not corporeal and yet is the fundamental reality of things. From Light came Heat and Fluidity; these three together with Space make up the elements out of which all things are constructed. This cosmic theory is a curious combination of materialistic and abstract ideas; the influence of his master Bernardino Telesio, generally predominant, is not strong enough to overcome his inherent disbelief in the adequacy of purely scientific explanation.\n\nHis practical work included a scheme for diverting a river to protect Ferrara and military strategy.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "797698", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=797698", "title": "Friend zone", "text": "Friend zone\n\nIn popular culture, the friend zone is a situation in which one member of a friendship wishes to enter into a romantic or sexual relationship, while the other does not. It is generally considered to be an undesirable situation for the rejected person. \n\nThe sense of \"zone\" is one of being stuck in an unwanted and distant relationship. The rejected person is said to have been put \"in\" the object of their affection's \"friend zone\". The concept of the friend zone has been criticized as misogynistic, because of a belief that the concept implies an expectation that women should have sex with men in whom they have no interest, simply because the men were nice to them. This is closely associated with so-called \"nice guy syndrome\".\n\nThe term friendzone can be verbified, as in the sentence \"So, she's friendzoned you.\" Although the term is apparently gender-neutral, friend zone is often used to describe a situation in a male-female relationship in which the male is in the friend zone and the female is the object of his unrequited desire. The person who does the friendzoning is referred to as the \"friendzoner\", whereas the person who gets friendzoned is called the \"friend-zonee\".\n\nThe term \"friend zone\" is sometimes used in pick up artist (PUA) literature, where it forms part of PUA theories about female sexual attraction to males.\n\nWriter Jeremy Nicholson in \"Psychology Today\" suggested that a romantic pursuer, in order to avoid being rejected up front, uses a ploy of acting friendly as a \"back door\" way into a hoped-for relationship. When this method does not work, the pursuer consequently is placed in the \"friend zone\". \n\nAccording to some psychologists, the man in a cross-gender friendship is more likely to be attracted to his woman friend than she is to him, and he is more likely to overestimate her interest in a romantic or sexual relationship.\n\nFeminist writers have argued that the friend zone concept is misogynistic and rooted in male narcissism. The \"nice guy\" concept has been criticized as a gender trope with an underlying message that kind acts demand a sexual or romantic reward, and that this concept implies that if a woman and a man have a platonic friendship and the man becomes romantically attracted to the woman, then the woman has an obligation to return his affection. A woman who does not return her \"nice guy\" male friend's affection is viewed negatively or seen to be at fault.\n\n\"TheGuardian.com\" contributor Ally Fogg argues that while the friend zone does not exist in a literal sense, men who use the term \"friend zone\" are not necessarily misogynists who feel entitled to sex. He states the term's usage reflects a genuine emotional experience for straight men with low self-esteem and self-confidence. He places blame on ingrained gender roles.\n\nThe term was popularized by a 1994 episode of the American sitcom \"Friends\" entitled \"The One with the Blackout\", where the character Ross Geller, who was lovesick for Rachel Green, was described by character Joey Tribbiani as being the \"mayor of the friend zone\".\n\nThe 2005 film \"Just Friends\" features a main character (played by Ryan Reynolds) reunited after ten years with his friend (played by Amy Smart), who informs him that she loves him \"like a brother\", essentially dashing any hopes of him having her as a girlfriend.\n\nMTV aired a reality show entitled \"FriendZone\" from 2011 to 2013. Each episode is based around \"crushers\" who are friends with the \"crushees\", but want to begin relationships with them.\n\nThe Cartoon Network series \"Regular Show\" brings up and shows the friend zone on a regular basis, as one of the show's main characters, Mordecai, and his friend Margaret experience shifts in their relationship.\n\n"}

Educated there and at the University of Jena, he became a \"privatdozent\" at Jena in 1802. In 1805 he became professor of classical literature in the University of Landshut, where he remained until 1826, when it was transferred to Munich. He lived there until his death in 1841. \n\nIn recognition of his work, the Bavarian Academy of Sciences made him a member and aulic councillor. He is known principally for his work during the last twenty-five years of his life on the dialogues of Plato. His \"Plato's Leben and Schriften\" (1816)—which originated in the \"Introductions\" of Friedrich Schleiermacher and the historical scepticism of Niebuhr and Wolf—was the first of those critical inquiries into the life and works of Plato.\n\nDistrusting tradition, he took a few of the finest dialogues as his standard, and from internal evidence denounced as spurious not only those generally admitted to be so (\"Epinomis, Minos, Theages, Rivales, Clitophon, Hipparchus, Eryxias\", \"Letters and Definitions\"), but also the \"Meno, Euthydemus, Charmides, Lysis, Laches\", \"First\" and \"Second Alcibiades\", \"Hippias Major\" and \"Minor\", \"Ion, Euthyphro, Apology, Crito\", and even (against Aristotle's explicit assertion) \"The Laws\". The genuine dialogues he divides into three series:\n\n\nThe work was followed by a complete edition of Plato's works (2 vols., 1819–1832) with a Latin translation and commentary. His last work was the \"Lexicon Platonicum \"(3 vols., 1834–1839), which is both valuable and comprehensive. In his works on aesthetics he combined the views of Schelling with those of Winckelmann, Lessing, Kant, Herder, Schiller and others. His histories of philosophy are marked more by critical scholarship than by originality of thought, though they are interesting as asserting the now familiar principle that the history of philosophy is not the history of opinions, but of reason as a whole; he was among the first to attempt to formulate a principle of the development of thought. \n\nBeside his works on Plato, he wrote, on aesthetics, \"System der Kunstlehre\" (1805) and \"Grundriß der Aesthetik\" (1807); on the history of philosophy, \"Grundlinien der Philosophie\" (1807, republished 1809, but soon forgotten), \"Grundriß einer Geschichte der Philosophie\" (1807 and 1825), and \"Hauptmomente der Geschichte der Philosophie\" (1829); in philology, \"Grundlinien der Philologie\" (1808), and \"Grundlinien der Grammatik, Hermeneutik und Kritik\" (1808).\n\nHe died in Munich.\n\n\n\n"}

The vast majority of American Hindus are immigrants from South Asia (mainly India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh, some from Bhutan, Maldives, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Myanmar), Indonesia (mainly Bali and Java), the Caribbean (mainly Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, and Jamaica), Fiji, Africa (mainly Southern Africa and Eastern African), and Mauritius and other countries and their descendants. Additionally, the United States has a number of converts to Hinduism. There are also about 900 ethnic Cham people of Vietnam, living in America. 55% of whom are Hindus. They are one of the few remaining non-Indic Hindus in the World.\n\nWhile there were isolated sojourns by Hindus in the United States during the 19th century, Hindu presence in the United States was extremely limited until the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965.\n\nCurrently, Hindu-Americans hold the highest education levels among all religious communities in the United States. This is mostly due to strong US immigration policies that favor educated and highly skilled migrants. Many concepts of Hinduism, such as karma, reincarnation and yoga, have entered into mainstream American vernacular. According to Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life survey of 2009, 24% of Americans believe in reincarnation, a core concept of Hinduism.\n\nThe United States Department of State's Religious Freedom Report 2004 found some 1.5 million adherents of Hinduism, corresponding to 0.50% of the total population. The Hindu population of USA is the world's eighth-largest; 10% of Asian Americans who together account for 5.8% of US population, are followers of the Hindu faith.\n\nAlthough Hinduism is practised mainly by immigrants from India,Guyana etc,a sizeble amount of Hindus in United States were converts to Hinduism.According to the Pew research estimates, 9% of the Hindus in United States belong to a non-Asian ethnicity - 4% of the Hindus in United States were White, 2% were black, 1% latino and 2% Mixed.\nConverts to Hinduism include Hollywood actress Julia Roberts, actor Russell Brand etc\n\nAmerican Hindus have the highest rates of educational attainment and highest rate of household income among all religious communities, and the lowest divorce rates. 48% of American Hindus hold a post-graduate degree. According to a study by the Pew Research Center's Forum on Religion and Public Life in 2012, 48% of American Hindus have a household income of $100,000 or more, and 70% make at least $75,000.\n\nAccording to the 2008 Pew Research, Of all the America adults who said they were raised as Hindus, 80 percent continued to adhere to Hinduism which is the highest retention rate for any religion in America.\nHindus also have relatively highest acceptance towards homosexuality.71 % of the Hindus in United States believes that homosexuality should be accepted which is higher than the general public which is 62%.About 68 % of the Hindus supported same-sex marriage, while that of general public is only 53%.Hindus in United States also showed high support for abortion.About 68% of the Hindus supported abortion.About 69% of the Hindus supported strict laws and regulation for the protection of environment and nature.\n\nAccording to the pew research statistics in 2014, 88 % of the American Hindu believes in god.However, only 26 % believes that religion is very important in their life.About 51 % of the Hindus prays daily.\n\nThough 88 % of the Hindus believes in god,it is low compared to Evangelical protestants(99%),Catholics(96%),Jehovah witness (99%)etc.\n\nAnandibai Joshi is believed to be the first Hindu woman to set foot on American soil, arriving in New York in June 1883 at the age of 19. She graduated with an MD from the Women's Medical College of Pennsylvania on 11 March 1886, becoming the first female of South Asian origin to graduate with a degree in Western medicine from the United States. Joshi returned to India in late 1886 but died within months of her return.\nOne of the first major discussions of Hinduism in the United States was Swami Vivekananda's address to the World's Parliament of Religions in Chicago in 1893. He spent two years in the United States, and lectured in several cities including Detroit, Boston, and New York. In 1902 Swami Rama Tirtha visited the US for about two years lecturing on the philosophy of Vedanta. In 1920 Paramahansa Yogananda was India's delegate at the International Congress of Religious Liberals held in Boston.\n\nPrior to 1965, Hindu immigration to the United States was minuscule and isolated, with fewer than fifty thousand Indians immigrating before 1965. It is worth noting that although most of these immigrants were Punjabi Sikhs, they were incorrectly and derogatorily referred to as \"Hindoo\" by many Americans, as well as in some official immigration documents. The Bellingham Riots in Bellingham, Washington on September 5, 1907 epitomized the low tolerance in the USA for Indians and Hindus. In the 1923 case United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind, the Supreme Court ruled that Thind and other South Asians were not \"free white persons\" according to a 1790 federal law that stated that only white immigrants could apply for naturalized citizenship. The Immigration Act of 1924 prohibited the immigration of Asians such as Middle Easterners and Indians. This further prevented Hindus from immigrating to the United States. Despite such events, some people, including professionals, stayed and worked until the Immigration and Nationality Services (INS) Act of 1965 was passed. This opened the doors to Hindu immigrants who wished to work and start families in the United States. It included Hindu preachers as well, who spread awareness of the religion among the people who had little or no contact with it.\n\nAlso during the 1960s, Hindu teachers found resonance in the US counter-culture, leading to the formation of a number of Neo-Hindu movements such as the International Society for Krishna Consciousness founded by Swami Prabhupada. People involved in the counter-culture such as Ram Dass, George Harrison, and Allen Ginsberg were influential in the spread of Hinduism in the United States. Ram Dass was a Harvard professor known as Richard Alpert and after being fired from Harvard was receiving a lot of media coverage. He traveled to India and studied under Neem Karoli Baba and came back to the west as a Hindu teacher and changed his name to Ram Dass which means servant of Rama (one of the Hindu gods). A student of Ram Dass, Jeffery Kagel, devoted his life to Hinduism in the sixties and is now making many CDs chanting the sacred mantras or spiritual verses. He has been very successful and is considered the rock star of yoga. George Harrison was a member of The Beatles which in its peak of popularity was receiving more media coverage than any other band in the world. He became a devotee of Swami Prabhupada who is the founder of ISKCON (mentioned above). George Harrison started to record songs with the words \"Hari Krishna\" in the lyrics and was widely responsible for popularizing Hinduism in America with the younger generation of the time. Allen Ginsberg, the author of Howl, became a figure in the sixties that was also heavily involved with Hinduism and it was said that he chanted \"Om\" at The Human Be-in of 1967 for hours on end. Other influential Indians of a Hindu faith are Chinmoy and Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.\n\nA joint session of the United States Congress was opened with a prayer in Sanskrit (with some Hindi and English added), read by Venkatachalapathi Samudrala, in September 2000, to honour the visit of Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. The historic gesture was an initiative by Ohio Congressman Sherrod Brown who requested the US Congress House Chaplain to invite the Hindu priest from the Shiva Vishnu Hindu Temple in Parma, Ohio. Another Hindu prayer was read in the United States Senate on July 12, 2007, by Rajan Zed, a Hindu chaplain from Nevada. His prayer was interrupted by a couple and their daughter who claimed to be \"Christian patriots\", which prompted a criticism of candidates in the upcoming presidential election for not criticizing the remarks.\nIn October 2009, President Barack Obama lit a ceremonial Diwali lamp at the White House to symbolise victory of light over darkness.\n\n92,323 exiled Bhutanese refugee have been resettled in USA since 2008 (As per the date of Feb, 2017) and many more Bhutanese refugee are resettling in United State of America continuously. Hinduism is the major religion of Bhutanese refugees who resettle in USA.\n\nThe Vedanta Society was responsible for building some early temples in United States starting in 1906, but they were not formal temples. Earliest traditional Mandir in the United States is Shiva Murugan Temple, Concord, CA (1957) known as Palanisamy Temple, it is one of the few temples that is run by public by elected members. The Maha Vallabha Ganapathi Devastanam owned by the Hindu Temple Society of North America in Flushing, New York City was consecrated on July 4, 1977. This temple recently underwent significant expansion and renovation.\n\nToday there are over 450 Hindu Temples across the United States, spread across the country, with a majority of them situated on the east coast centred around the New York region which alone has over 135 temples the next largest number being in Texas with 28 Temples and Massachusetts with 27 temples.\n\nOther prominent temples include the Malibu Hindu Temple, built in 1981 and located in Calabasas, is owned and operated by the Hindu Temple Society of Southern California. The temple is near Malibu, California. Apart from these, Swaminarayan temples exist in several cities across the country with a sizable following.\n\nThe oldest Hindu Temple in Texas is the Shree Raseshwari Radha Rani temple at Radha Madhav Dham, Austin. The temple, established by Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj is one of the largest Hindu Temple complexes in the Western Hemisphere, and the largest in North America.\n\nIn Tampa, South Florida, Sri Vishnu Temple is established before about 160 years\n\nParashakthi Temple in Pontiac, Michigan is a tirtha peetham in the west for Goddess \"Shakthi\" referred to as the \"Great Divine Mother\" in Hinduism. The Temple was envisioned by Dr. G Krishna Kumar in a deep meditative kundalini experience of \"Adi Shakthi\" in 1994.\n\nAkshardham in Robbinsville, New Jersey is one of the largest stone Hindu temples in the United States.\n\nThe Indian American Cultural Center opened on March 9, 2002, in Merrillville, Northwest Indiana. It was in 2010 on June 18 that the temple was finalized and opened, The Bharatiya Temple of Northwest Indiana. This temple is adjacent to the Cultural Center. In the native way of Hinduism, one would never see different sectarian groups worship in one temple. The Bharatiya Temple is unique in its own way by allowing different sectarian groups to worship together. The Bharatiya Temple has four different Hindu groups as well as a Jain group.\n\nThere are many Hindu temples in the United States, and too many to be listed.\n\nIn 2012, Tulsi Gabbard became the first-ever Hindu to be elected to the US Congress. She is a Hawaiian of Samoan descent, the daughter of a Roman Catholic and a Caucasian Hindu convert.Later, in 2016 two more Hindus were elected to Congress-Raja Krishnamoorthi and Ro Khanna(Rohit Khanna). American Hindus are now the third largest Religious Group in Congress with 3 members.

He outlines the views of philosophers from Plato to Hegel, and tracing the development of ideas about being, ontology, and metaphysics. He also attempts to explain how developments in science, economics, and religion provided the background to existentialism. According to Barrett, \"With Protestantism begins that long modern struggle, which reaches its culmination in the twentieth century, to strip man naked.\" In his view, \"as the modern world moves onward, it becomes more and more secularized in every department of life; faith consequently becomes attenuated, and Protestant man begins to look more and more like a gaunt skeleton, a sculpture by Giacometti. A secular civilization leaves him more starkly naked than the iconoclasm of the Reformation had ever dreamed.\" Barrett writes that during the modern period, there has emerged \"an image of man himself that bears a new, stark, more nearly naked, and more questionable aspect. The contraction of man's horizons amounts to a denudation, a stripping down, of this being who has now to confront himself at the center of all his horizons. The labor of modern culture, wherever it has been authentic, has been a labor of denudation.\" Surveying trends in art, Barrett writes that the Dada movement was \"one of the \"valid\" eruptions of the irrational in this century.\"\n\nFour existentialist thinkers - Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Sartre - receive extended discussion from Barrett, who explains their main ideas and philosophical terminology. Barrett more briefly discusses other existentialist thinkers such as Karl Jaspers, Nikolai Berdyaev, Martin Buber, Miguel de Unamuno, Gabriel Marcel, Simone de Beauvoir, and Albert Camus, as well as some artists and writers he considers existentialist, such as the Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoyevsky, whom he compares to Nietzsche, crediting him with anticipating Nietzsche's insights into the will to power in \"Crime and Punishment\" (1866).\n\nDiscussing Kierkegaard, Barrett maintains that the Danish philosopher is relevant even to non-Christians because of his \"appeal to their own existence.\" Barrett writes that, \"Being a Christian, after all, is one way of being a man - for Kierkegaard personally it was the only way - and to have this way illumined, to be summoned to its tasks, is also to be called on to be a man, however divergent our own choice of a way may be.\" Barrett adds that, \"Kierkegaard stated the question of Christianity so nakedly, made it turn so decisively about the individual and his quest for his own eternal happiness, that all religious writers after him seem by comparison to be symbolical, institutional, or metaphorical - in a word, gnostic. Perhaps the very nakedness of Kierkegaard's statement of faith makes it impossible for Christianity to go anywhere but in the direction of some kind of gnosticism.\"\n\nIn his discussion of Nietzsche, Barrett writes that, \"Nietzsche's fate is one the great episodes in man's historic effect to know himself. After him, the problem of man could never quite return to its pre-Nietzschean level.\" Barrett calls \"Thus Spoke Zarathustra\" (1883-1891) Nietzsche's \"most lyrical book\" and \"the expression of the loneliest Nietzsche.\"\n\nFinally, Barrett applies existentialist thought to the world of the late 1950s, during the Cold War. \"Irrational Man\" includes two appendices, \"Negation, Finitude, and the Nature of Man\", which reprints a 1957 paper by Barrett, and \"Existence and Analytic Philosophers\", a highly technical discussion of existentialism in relation to analytic philosophy.\n\n\"Irrational Man\" was first published in 1958 by Doubleday & Company, Inc. Later editions include those published by Greenwood Press, Inc. in 1977 and Anchor Books in 1990.\n\n\"Irrational Man\" received a positive review from Robert Jordan in \"The Nation\". Later discussions of the book include those by Paul Stuewe in \"Quill & Quire\", Andrew Pulver in \"The Guardian\", and John Williams in \"The New York Times Book Review\".\n\nJordan described the book as a \"spirited defense\" of the methods and conclusions of existentialist philosophy. Stuewe described it as \"perhaps the best popular book on existentialism\". Pulver identified the book as an influence on filmmaker Woody Allen, observing that the title of his film \"Irrational Man\" (2015) is clearly inspired by Barrett's book, which \"no doubt formed part of Allen’s self-taught intellectual life in the late 50s and early 60s\".\n\nThe theologian John Macquarrie, writing in \"Existentialism\" (1972), described \"Irrational Man\" as one of the most useful books about existentialism. The Objectivist philosopher Leonard Peikoff, writing in \"The Ominous Parallels\" (1982), presented \"Irrational Man\" as an example of a prominent philosopher endorsing irrationality, citing Barrett's comments about Dada. The philosopher Jon Stewart, writing in his anthology \"The Hegel Myths and Legends\" (1996), accused Barrett of caricaturing, and propagating myths about, Hegel. Stewart deemed Barrett guilty of misrepresenting Hegel as a \"cosmic rationalist\" who, like Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling and some romantics, believed in a metaphysical world soul.\n\n\n\n"}

He seems to have been brought up at Lisbon, where he became a monk of the order of St. Augustine, and was pursuing his studies in the Portuguese capital when the city was destroyed by the earthquake of 1755.\n\nAt age 40 Magellan abandoned the monastic life. About 1764 he appears to have reached England and was in communication with Da Costa of the Royal Society in 1766. For some time he acted as tutor on continental tours, and made the acquaintance of leading scholars of the day, especially in the Netherlands. Magellan was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1774, and was a corresponding member of the academies of science in Paris, Madrid, and St. Petersburg. \nIn June 1778 Magellan was at Ermenonville, the seat of the Marquis de Gerardin, and there, with M. du Presle, he visited Jean-Jacques Rousseau a few days before his death on 2 July. He added a postscript describing his visit to Du Presle's \"Relation des derniers Jours de J. J. Rousseau\", London, 1778. Magellan settled in London soon afterwards. He was for some time engaged in superintending the construction of a set of astronomical and meteorological instruments for the court of Madrid, which he described in 1779. He devoted his last years to the construction of instruments including thermometers and barometers. He made a clock for the blind Louis Engelbert, 6th Duke of Arenberg, which indicated by bells the hours and other readings.\n\nAmong Magellan's friends was the Hungarian count Maurice Benyovszky. About 1784 the count borrowed a large sum from Magellan, and was soon afterwards shot as a pirate by the French in Madagascar. Magellan never recovered the money. He died on 7 February 1790, after more than a year's illness and was buried in Islington churchyard. Although there are claims that, due to his laxity and unorthodoxy, he renounced his faith, his correspondence and other sources confirm he never gave up Catholicism.\n\nMagellan's major works were:\n\n\nMagellan also wrote articles in the \"Journal de Physique\", 1778–83. On the title-page of his translation of Axel Fredrik Cronstedt's \"System of Mineralogy\", 1788, he assumed the appellation \"Talabrico-Lusitanus\".\n\nMagellan gave Count Benyovszky's memoirs to William Nicholson, who published them in English in 1790. Magellan's French version of the memoirs appeared after his death, and letters of Magellan to Benyowsky were published in Mór Jókai's edition of the count's memoirs.\n\nThe Magellanic Premium, a prize given for advances in navigation, was established in 1786 by a grant given by him.\n\n"}

The term was commonly used to refer to the Democratic-Republican Party (formally named the \"Republican Party\"), which Jefferson founded in opposition to the Federalist Party of Alexander Hamilton. The Jeffersonians were deeply committed to American republicanism, which meant opposition to aristocracy of any form, opposition to corruption, and insistence on virtue, with a priority for the \"yeoman farmer\", \"planters\", and the \"plain folk\".\n\nThey were antagonistic to the aristocratic elitism of merchants, bankers, and manufacturers, distrusted factory workers, and were on the watch for supporters of the dreaded British system of government. Jeffersonian democracy persisted as an element of the Democratic Party into the early 20th century, as exemplified by the rise of Jacksonian democracy and the three presidential candidacies of William Jennings Bryan. Its themes continue to echo in the 21st century, particularly among the Libertarian and Republican parties.\n\nAt the beginning of the Jeffersonian era, only two states (Vermont and Kentucky) had established universal white male suffrage by abolishing property requirements. By the end of the period, more than half of the states had followed suit, including virtually all of the states in the Old Northwest. States then also moved on to allowing popular votes for presidential elections, canvassing voters in a more modern style. Jefferson's party, known today as the Democratic-Republican Party, was then in full control of the apparatus of government\"—\"from the state legislature and city hall to the White House.\n\nJefferson has been called \"the most democratic of the Founding fathers\". The Jeffersonians advocated a narrow interpretation of the Constitution's Article I provisions granting powers to the federal government. They strenuously opposed the Federalist Party, led by Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton. President George Washington generally supported Hamilton's program for a financially strong national government. The election of Jefferson in 1800, which he called \"the revolution of 1800\", brought in the Presidency of Thomas Jefferson and the permanent eclipse of the Federalists, apart from the Supreme Court.\n\n\"Jeffersonian democracy\" is an umbrella term and some factions favored some positions more than others. While principled, with vehemently held core beliefs, the Jeffersonians had factions that disputed the true meaning of their creed. For example, during the War of 1812 it became apparent that independent state militia units were inadequate for conducting a serious war against a major country. The new Secretary of War John C. Calhoun, a Jeffersonian, proposed to build up the Army. With the support of most Republicans in Congress, he got his way. However, the \"Old Republican\" faction, claiming to be true to the Jeffersonian Principles of '98, fought him and reduced the size of the Army after Spain sold Florida to the U.S.\n\nHistorians characterize Jeffersonian democracy as including the following core ideals:\n\n\nTerritorial expansion of the United States was a major goal of the Jeffersonians because it would produce new farm lands for yeomen farmers. The Jeffersonians wanted to integrate the Indians into American society, or remove further west those tribes that refused to integrate. However Sheehan (1974) argues that the Jeffersonians, with the best of goodwill toward the Indians, destroyed their distinctive cultures with its misguided benevolence.\nThe Jeffersonians took enormous pride in the bargain they reached with France in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803. It opened up vast new fertile farmlands from Louisiana to Montana. Jefferson saw the West as an economic safety valve which would allow people in the crowded East to own farms. However, established New England political interests feared the growth of the West and a majority in the Federalist Party opposed the purchase. Jeffersonians thought the new territory would help maintain their vision of the ideal republican society, based on agricultural commerce, governed lightly and promoting self-reliance and virtue.\n\nThe Jeffersonians' dream did not come to pass as the Louisiana Purchase was a turning point in the history of American imperialism. The farmers with whom Jefferson identified conquered the West, often through violence against Native Americans. Jefferson himself sympathized with Native Americans, but that did not stop him from enacting policies that would continue the trend towards the dispossession of their lands.\n\nJeffersonian agrarians held that the economy of the United States should rely more on agriculture for strategic commodities than on industry. Jefferson specifically believed: \"Those who labor in the earth are the chosen people of God, if He ever had a chosen people, whose breast He has made His peculiar deposit for substantial and genuine virtue\". However, Jeffersonian ideals are not opposed to all manufacturing, rather he believed that all people have the right to work to provide for their own subsistence and that an economic system which undermines that right is unacceptable.\n\nJefferson's belief was that unlimited expansion of commerce and industry would lead to the growth of a class of wage laborers who relied on others for income and sustenance. The workers would no longer be independent voters. Such a situation, Jefferson feared, would leave the American people vulnerable to political subjugation and economic manipulation. The solution Jefferson came up with was, as scholar Clay Jenkinson noted, \"a graduated income tax that would serve as a disincentive to vast accumulations of wealth and would make funds available for some sort of benign redistribution downward\" as well as tariffs on imported articles, which were mainly purchased by the wealthy.\n\nSimilarly, Jefferson was against international trade. He believed that not only would economic dependence on Europe diminish the virtue of the republic, but that the United States had an abundance of natural resources that Americans should be able to cultivate and use to tend to their own needs. Furthermore, exporting goods by merchant ships created risks of capture by foreign pirates and armies, which would require an expensive navy for protection.\n\nWhile the Federalists advocated for a strong central government, Jeffersonians argued for strong state and local governments and a weak federal government. Self-sufficiency, self-government and individual responsibility were in the Jeffersonian worldview among the most important ideals that formed the basis of the American Revolution. In Jefferson's opinion, nothing that could feasibly be accomplished by individuals at the local level ought to be accomplished by the federal government. The federal government would concentrate its efforts solely on national and international projects. Jefferson's advocacy of limited government led to sharp disagreements with Federalist figures such as Alexander Hamilton. Jefferson felt that Hamilton favored plutocracy and the creation of a powerful aristocracy in the United States which would accumulate increasingly greater power until the political and social order of the United States became indistinguishable from those of the Old World.\n\nAfter initial skepticism, Jefferson supported the ratification of the United States Constitution and especially supported its stress on checks and balances. The ratification of the United States Bill of Rights, especially the First Amendment, gave Jefferson even greater confidence in the document. Jeffersonians favored a strict construction interpretation of federal government powers described in Article I of the Constitution. For example, Jefferson once wrote a letter to Charles Willson Peale explaining that although a Smithsonian-style national museum would be a wonderful resource, he could not support the use of federal funds to construct and maintain such a project. The \"strict constructionism\" of today is a remote descendant of Jefferson's views.\n\nThe spirit of Jeffersonian democracy dominated American politics from 1800 to 1824, the First Party System, under Jefferson and succeeding presidents James Madison and James Monroe. The Jeffersonians proved much more successful than the Federalists in building state and local party organizations that united various factions. Voters in every state formed blocs loyal to the Jeffersonian coalition.\n\nProminent spokesmen for Jeffersonian principles included Madison, Albert Gallatin, John Randolph of Roanoke, Nathaniel Macon, John Taylor of Caroline and James Monroe, as well as John C. Calhoun, John Quincy Adams and Henry Clay (with the last three taking new paths after 1828).\n\nRandolph was the Jeffersonian leader in Congress from 1801 to 1815, but he later broke with Jefferson and formed his own \"Tertium Quids\" faction because he thought the president no longer adhered to the true Jeffersonian principles of 1798. The Quids wanted to actively punish and discharge Federalists in the government and in the courts. Jefferson himself sided with the moderate faction exemplified by figures such as Madison, who were much more conciliatory towards Federalism.\n\nAfter the Madison administration experienced serious trouble financing the War of 1812 and discovered the Army and militia were unable to make war effectively, a new generation of Republican nationalists emerged. They were supported by President James Monroe, an original Jeffersonian; and included John Quincy Adams, Henry Clay and John C. Calhoun. In 1824, Adams defeated Andrew Jackson, who had support from the Quids; and in a few years two successor parties had emerged, the Democratic Party, which formulated Jacksonian democracy and which still exists; and Henry Clay's Whig Party. Their competition marked the Second Party System.\n\nAfter 1830, the principles were still talked about but did not form the basis of a political party, thus editor Horace Greeley in 1838 started a magazine, \"The Jeffersonian,\" that he said \"would exhibit a practical regard for that cardinal principle of Jeffersonian Democracy, and the People are the sole and safe depository of all power, principles and opinions which are to direct the Government\".\n\nJeffersonian democracy was not a one-man operation. It was a large political party with many local and state leaders and various factions, and they did not always agree with Jefferson or with each other.\n\nJefferson was accused of inconsistencies by his opponents. The \"Old Republicans\" said that he abandoned the Principles of 1798. He believed the national security concerns were so urgent that it was necessary to purchase Louisiana without waiting for a Constitutional amendment. He enlarged federal power through the intrusively-enforced Embargo Act of 1807. He idealized the \"yeoman farmer\" despite being himself a gentleman plantation owner. The disparities between Jefferson's philosophy and practice have been noted by numerous historians. Staaloff proposed that it was due to his being a proto-Romantic; John Quincy Adams claimed that it was a manifestation of pure hypocrisy, or \"pliability of principle\"; and Bailyn asserts it simply represented a contradiction with Jefferson, that he was \"simultaneously a radical utopian idealist and a hardheaded, adroit, at times cunning politician\". However, Jenkinson argued that Jefferson's personal failings ought not to influence present day thinkers to disregard Jeffersonian ideals.\n\nKuehnelt-Leddihn, a European nobleman who opposed democracy, argues that \"Jeffersonian democracy\" is a misnomer because Jefferson was not a democrat, but in fact believed in rule by an elite: \"Jefferson actually was an Agrarian Romantic who dreamt of a republic governed by an elite of character and intellect\".\n\nHistorian Sean Wilentz argues that as a practical politician elected to serve the people Jefferson had to negotiate solutions, not insist on his own version of abstract positions. The result, Wilentz argues, was \"flexible responses to unforeseen events ... in pursuit of ideals ranging from the enlargement of opportunities for the mass of ordinary, industrious Americans to the principled avoidance of war\".\n\nHistorians have long portrayed the contest between Jefferson and Hamilton as iconic for the politics, political philosophy, economic policies and future direction of the United States. In 2010, Wilentz identified a scholarly trend in Hamilton's favor:\n\nIn recent years, Hamilton and his reputation have decidedly gained the initiative among scholars who portray him as the visionary architect of the modern liberal capitalist economy and of a dynamic federal government headed by an energetic executive. Jefferson and his allies, by contrast, have come across as naïve, dreamy idealists. At best according to many historians, the Jeffersonians were reactionary utopians who resisted the onrush of capitalist modernity in hopes of turning America into a yeoman farmers' arcadia. At worst, they were proslavery racists who wish to rid the West of Indians, expand the empire of slavery, and keep political power in local hands – all the better to expand the institution of slavery and protect slaveholders' rights to own human property.\n\n\n"}

He was a lecturer in the philosophy faculty at Cambridge University and was later promoted to reader in 1997. In 1998, he became a senior research fellow at All Souls College at the University of Oxford; he returned to the University of Cambridge in his present position in 2006. He has held visiting positions at Princeton University, the University of Pittsburgh and the University of Sydney.\n\nButterfield is a fellow of the British Academy and a senior research fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge. He is a past president of the British Society for the Philosophy of Science, and of the Mind Association. He previously served on the governing board of the Philosophy of Science Association and on the executive committee of the British Philosophical Association. He co-founded the journal \"Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics\", and edited it until 2001. He serves on the editorial boards of several journals and book series.\n\nButterfield's research centres around a variety of topics in the philosophy of physics and philosophy of science, and he has also made contributions to the philosophy of language and logic, particularly with regard to the treatment of time and tense. In this regard, he has argued in several papers for a \"detensed\" theory of time, according to which the present is a merely subjective or indexical notion, on analogy with one's spatial location.\n\nIn the philosophy of quantum theory, Butterfield has proposed several clarifications of the notions of locality operative in algebraic quantum field theories (especially 'stochastic Einstein locality'), and has investigated which of these clarified versions of locality hold in those theories. He has also investigated the impact of the Bell inequalities in the light of Reichenbach's principle of the common cause, and has argued that the violation of these inequalities implies causation between the space-like separated wings of a Bell experiment. In addition, he has written on the quantum measurement problem, and the implications for it due to, and of it for, the philosophy and science of consciousness. He has also investigated the problems of localizability in relativistic quantum theories, in collaboration with Gordon Fleming.\n\nIn the philosophy of spacetime physics, Butterfield has argued for a resolution of Einstein's 1913 hole argument that preserves spacetime substantivalism by utilizing David Lewis's theory of modal counterparts. More recently, he has appealed to tensor calculus, and its use in much of contemporary physics, to argue against the popular view (propounded by David Lewis) that the world may be described in terms of 'local matters of fact'; i.e. in terms of chiefly intrinsic properties instantiated at spatial or spatio-temporal points.\n\nIn the philosophy of classical mechanics, Butterfield has investigated the elimination of descriptively redundant formal elements through \"symplectic reduction\", and the interdependence between conserved quantities and conservation laws. He has also made several appeals in his work, on classical mechanics and other physical theories, to the importance of an appreciation of \"modality\" in physics.\n\nIn several papers, Butterfield has collaborated with the theoretical physicist Chris Isham. These address the role of topos theory in understanding quantum theory (in particular the Kochen-Specker theorem), and the status of time in the various quantum gravity research programmes.\n\nIn recent years, Butterfield has argued for a reconciliation of the idea of \"emergence\" – the idea that novel structures, not described by \"fundamental\" theories, appear at a certain level of complexity – with the possibility of inter-theoretic reduction. He has illustrated the reconciliation in various areas such as phase transitions, renormalization, and gauge theories. He has also worked, often in collaboration with research students, on other topics, including: (i) identity and individuation of systems in quantum physics; (ii) dualities especially gauge/gravity duality; (iii) under-determination, and scientific realism, in modern cosmology.\n\nBooks\n\n\nResearch articles in journals\n\nResearch contributions in books\n"}

{"id": "6059204", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6059204", "title": "Life chances", "text": "Life chances\n\nLife chances (\"Lebenschancen\" in German) is a social science theory of the opportunities each individual has to improve their quality of life. The concept was introduced by German sociologist Max Weber. It is a probabilistic concept, describing how likely it is, given certain factors, that an individual's life will turn out a certain way. According to this theory, life chances are positively correlated with one's socioeconomic status.\n\nOpportunities in this sense refer to the extent to which one has access to resources, both tangible ones such as food, clothing and shelter, and intangible ones such as education and health care. Life chances comprise the individual's ability to procure goods, have a career and obtain inner satisfaction; in other words, the ability to satisfy one's needs.\n\nWeberian life chances can be seen as an expansion on some of functionalist Karl Marx's ideas. Both Weber and Marx agreed that economic factors were important in determining one's future, but Weber's concepts of life chances are more complex; inspired by, but different from Marx's views on social stratification and social class. Where for Marx the class status was the most important factor, and he correlated life chances with material wealth, Weber introduced such additional factors as social mobility and social equality. Other factors include those related to one's socioeconomic status, such as gender, race, and ethnicity.\n\nWhile some of those factors, like age, race or gender, are random, Weber stressed the link between life chances and the non-random elements of the three-component theory of stratification – how social class, social status and political affiliation affect each individual's life. In other words, individuals in certain groups have in common a specific causal component of their life chances: they are in similar situation, which tends to imply a similar outcome to their actions. Weber notes the importance of economic factors: how the power of those with property, compared to those without property, gives the former great advantages over the latter.\n\nWeber also noted that life chances are to certain extent subjective: one's assessment of one's life chances will affect one's actions; therefore, if one believes that one is or can become a respected and valued member of society, that outcome and associated positive results are more likely to become a reality for such a person than they are for one without this conviction. Persons without such a belief, especially those who consciously espouse or have unconsciously internalized a belief to the contrary, are vulnerable to learned helplessness and its long-term effects.\n\nIn terms of agency and structure, life chances represent the structure, the factors that one has no control over; whereas one's life conduct - values and beliefs, attitude to risk taking, social skills, or more generally, free willed choices about one's behavior - represent the factors one has control over. According to Weber theories, together with life conduct, life chances are responsible for one's lifestyle.\n\nIn social engineering, life chances may have to be balanced against other goals, such as eliminating poverty, ensuring personal freedom or ensuring equality at birth.\n\nThe life chances approach suggests that status is not entirely achieved, but is, to some extent, ascribed. Overall, in societies emphasizing ascription, opportunity is relatively low and status (in the sense of prestige in the community) is often inherited.\nThis means that people are, effectively, given their status as a result of the group into which they are born, rather than earning it entirely on merit. Ascriptive qualities such as race/ethnicity, gender, and class of origin can all affect one's life chances. In all societies parents pass on whatever advantages and disadvantages they have to their children.\n\nA persons’ class of origin determines one's neighborhood they live in, which in turn will affect educational attainment, the people they socialize with, and ultimately their class identification. A very important factor affecting life chances is housing. Poorer housing will affect health, available facilities, the likelihood of being a victim of crime, and many other aspects of life. Leisure facilities are often located in middle class areas or near non manual work places. Gym membership is expensive and subsidies are rarely available for lower grade staff. Therefore, in general, the middle and upper classes have far greater life chances available than the less advantaged groups.\n\nIf born into a wealthy family a person will have access to far more desirable resources that can assist them in further enhancing their life chances to a far greater extent than someone who is born into a working class poor family. One of these resources includes a family's social ties and the ability for a person with well connected parents to benefit greatly in the status attainment process. Status attainment refers to how each individual enters an occupation. This encompasses how both ascribed and achieved factors combine, because each individual enters an occupation based on the way their parents’ status produces advantages and disadvantages, their own efforts and abilities, and a degree of luck.\n\nAn additional dimension is the effect of family dynamics on life chances, such as the presence of biological parents, the quality of family relationships, and sibling configuration. For example, it has been demonstrated that children of divorced parents exhibit lower levels of psychological well-being, more problems in their own relationship, a greater risk of experiencing divorce, and also tend to be less educated.\n\nMax Weber discussed the effects of social stratification on life chances. He argued that life chances are opportunities and possibilities that make up one's lifestyle. Life chances are affected by a number of factors. Some of which include: income, social class, and occupational prestige. These factors all affect the availability of resources to an individual. For example, when one has low income, they have low life chances. Their education may not be as great and they may not have a high enough income to attain an advanced level of education.\nAccording to Wout Ultee, education is a major aspect of overcoming life chances. Without an education, it is harder to obtain a job that provides a substantial income to provide for a family of four. “Higher education is the way to stay ahead.\" The higher the education, the higher income and occupational prestige one will have, which results in more resources for an individual and his family.\n\nEarly intervention is also necessary in improving life chances. Save the Children is a non-governmental group that works in the best interest of children. They promote children's rights and the aid children in underdeveloped countries that need relief. The UK has started an early intervention program that aids in improving life chances early on a child's life. They believe that \"No child should endure poverty and no child's life chances should be shaped by the accident of birth.\" This program was made to ensure that inequalities in children's learning are tackled before problems can occur and separate them from peers. In order to do so, this program gives parents in lower classes the expertise they need to effectively help their children's learning in a home environment so that they are well prepared when they enter school. An example would be improving the parents' reading level so that they are able to teach their children how to read and write before kindergarten. This allows children in lower classes to be near the same level as children who are in higher classes with higher educated parents. Early intervention will allow for children to start out their education on the right foot, with skills they will need to succeed and achieve a high level of education, thus improving life chances.\n\nWeber noted that life chances are partially determined by subjective factors, such as by how one perceives their life chances. How one perceives their life chances is in large part determined by what one perceives their social class to be since life chances and social class go hand in hand and both reinforce each other. According to Weber this is because life chances are largely determined by economic factors such as social class. The phenomenon of how you perceive things actually affecting the tangible outcomes of life chances is explained by Robert K. Merton's theory of \"self fulfilling prophecy\" which he discusses in his book Social Theory and Social Structure. Essentially what it means is that individuals can tell themselves something like, \"I'm lower class, my family has always been lower class, there's no chance I'm ever going to be well off\" and although this statement had the potential to not end up being true, it became true simply because the individual believed it would be so and through his attitude and lack of self-esteem, made it his reality.\n\nIf you identify as low social class and believe you are most likely never going to be anything else, this will affect your life conduct in a myriad of ways. which in turn will affect your life chances. For one, the company you keep can lead to you networking with people that will not help you get out of a low socioeconomic environment. It can also affect your life conduct by making you think you are not qualified enough for anything but working class jobs. It can also affect your life conduct by making you think that pursuing higher education is not for someone of your social standing, further ensuring that you never get above working class work. The relationship between social class, life conduct, and life chances is a strong one that often decides what a person's fate in life will be like.\n\n\nThe Essentials\", Cengage Learning, 2009, , Google Print, p.214\n"}

{"id": "16162581", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16162581", "title": "Mind monkey", "text": "Mind monkey\n\nMind monkey or monkey mind, from Chinese \"xinyuan\" and Sino-Japanese \"shin'en\" 心猿 [lit. \"heart-/mind-monkey\"], is a Buddhist term meaning \"unsettled; restless; capricious; whimsical; fanciful; inconstant; confused; indecisive; uncontrollable\". In addition to Buddhist writings, including Chan or Zen, Consciousness-only, Pure Land, and Shingon, this \"mind-monkey\" psychological metaphor was adopted in Taoism, Neo-Confucianism, poetry, drama, and literature. \"Mind-monkey\" occurs in two reversible four-character idioms with \"yima\" or \"iba\" 意馬 [lit. \"thought-/will-horse\"], most frequently used in Chinese \"xinyuanyima\" 心猿意馬 and Japanese \"ibashin'en\" 意馬心猿. The \"Monkey King\" Sun Wukong in the \"Journey to the West\" personifies the mind-monkey. Note that much of the following summarizes Carr (1993).\n\n\"Mind-monkey\" 心猿 is an exemplary animal metaphor. Some figures of speech are cross-linguistically common, verging upon linguistic universals; many languages use \"monkey\" or \"ape\" words to mean \"mimic\", for instance, Italian \"to mock; to mimic\" < \"monkey; ape\", Japanese \"sarumane\" 猿真似 [lit. \"monkey imitation\"] \"copycat; superficial imitation\", and English \"monkey see, monkey do\" or \"\"). Other animal metaphors have culture-specific meanings; compare English \"\" \"cowardly; timid'; easily frightened\" and Chinese \"jixin\" 雞心 [lit. \"chicken heart\"] \"heart-shaped; cordate\".\n\nThe four morphological elements of Chinese \"xinyuanyima\" or Japanese \"shin'en'iba\" are \"xin\" or \"shin\" 心 \"heart; mind\", \"yi\" or \"i\" 意 \"thought\", \"yuan\" or \"en\" 猿 \"monkey\", and \"ma\" or \"ba\" 馬 \"horse\"'.\n\nThe psychological components of the \"mind-monkey will-horse\" metaphor are Chinese \"xin\" or Sino-Japanese \"shin\" or \"kokoro\" \"heart; mind; feelings, affections; center\" and \"yi\" or \"i\" 'thought, idea; opinion, sentiment; will, wish; meaning'. This Chinese character 心 was graphically simplified from an original pictogram of a heart, and 意 \"thought; think\" is an ideogram combining 心 under \"yin\" \"sound; tone; voice\" denoting \"sound in the mind; thought; idea\".\n\nIn Chinese Buddhism and Japanese Buddhism, \"xin\"/\"shin\" 心 \"heart; mind\" generally translates Sanskrit \"\" \"the mind; state of mind; consciousness\" and \"yi\"/\"i\" 意 translates Sanskrit \"\" \"the mental organ; deliberation\". Some Buddhist authors have used 心 and 意 interchangeably for \"mind; cognition; thought\". Compare these \"Digital Dictionary of Buddhism\" glosses \nFor example, take the Buddhist word Chinese \"xin-yi-shi\" or Japanese \"shin-i-shiki\" 心意識 [lit. \"mind, thought, and cognition\"] that compounds three near-synonyms. Abhidharma theory uses this word as a general term for \"mind; mentality\", but Yogacara theory of Eight Consciousnesses distinguishes \"xin\"/\"shin\" 心 \"store consciousness\", \"yi\"/\"i\" 意 \"\"manas\" consciousness\", and \"shi\"/\"shiki\" 識 \"six object-contingent consciousnesses\".\n\n\"Xinyuanyima\" 心猿意馬 [lit. \"mind-monkey idea-horse\"] \"distracted; indecisive; restless\" is comparable with some other Chinese collocations.\n\nThe animal components of the \"mind-monkey will-horse\" metaphor are Chinese \"yuan\" or Japanese \"en\" \"gibbon; monkey; ape\" and \"ma\" or \"ba\" \"horse\".\n\nChinese \"yuan\" 猿 (\"yuan\" or \"nao\" ) originally meant the \"agile gibbon, black-handed gibbon, \"Hylobates agilis\"\" but now generally means \"ape; monkey\" (e.g., \"yuanren\" 猿人 [\"ape-man\"] \"Homo erectus; anthropoid apes'\"). Robert van Gulik (1967:33) concludes that until about the 14th century, \"yuan\" designated the gibbon, but due to extensive deforestation, its habitat shrank to remote southern mountains; from then on, \"the majority of Chinese writers knowing about the gibbon only by hearsay, they began to confuse him with the macaque or other Cynopithecoids.\" Other common Chinese \"monkey\" names include \"feifei\" 狒狒 \"hamadryas baboon, \"Papio hamadryas\"\", \"hou\" \"monkey; ape\", and \"mihou\" 獼猴 (\"muhou\" 母猴) or \"husun\" 猢猻 \"rhesus macaque, rhesus monkey, \"Macaca mulatta\"\", Victor H. Mair (1990:36) reconstructs Old Sinitic *\"mug-gug\", which \"probably ultimately derives from the same African word as English 'macaque'\" and is reminiscent of Sanskrit \"maraṭāsana ('monkey posture')\" (see Hanumanasana). These \"monkey; ape\" characters combine the \"dog radical\" with different phonetic elements, such as the \"yuan\" phonetic in \"yuan\" 猿.\n\nIn Chinese mythology, \"yuan\" \"gibbons\" were supposedly long-lived because they could \"yinqi\" 引氣 [\"pull qi\"] \"absorb life-force\", which is a \"daoyin\" 導引 [\"guiding and pulling\"] \"Daoist gymnastic technique\". Chinese classic texts mentioned \"monkey leaping\" and \"monkey bowing\" yoga (Miura 1989:354). One of the 2nd-century BCE Mawangdui Silk Texts depicts 28 Daoist gymnastic exercises, many of which are named after animals, including number 22 \"muhou\" \"macaque\". In the present day, \"houquan\" 猴拳 [\"monkey fist/boxing\"] \"Monkey Kung Fu\" is a Chinese martial arts style and \"xinyuanyima\" \"mind-monkey will-horse\" is a Daoist breath meditation technique. \nWhen one breathes in and out, one's concentration causes the generative force to rise and fall (in the microcosmic orbit) thus slowly turning the wheel of the law. Count from one to ten and then from ten to one hundred breaths with the heart (mind) following the counting to prevent it from wandering outside. When the heart and breathing are in unison, this is called \"locking up the monkey heart\" and \"tying up the running horse of intellect\". (Luk 1990:48) \n\nThe Japanese kanji 猿 is pronounced as Sino-Japanese \"en\" < \"yuan\" or native \"saru\" \"monkey\", especially the indigenous \"Japanese macaque, \"Macaca fuscata\"\". In Japanese Shinto tradition, the monkey deity Sarutahiko was a divine messenger. Emiko Ohnuki-Tierney (1987:41) contrasts how, \"in earlier periods the dominant meaning of the monkey was that of mediator between deities and humans. Later in history, its meaning as a scapegoat became increasingly dominant.\"\n\nChinese \"ma\" 馬 \"horse\", which was the linguistic source for Sino-Japanese \"ba\" or \"ma\" 馬 \"horse\", originally referred to Przewalski's horse and later the Mongolian horse, Ferghana horse, etc. Horses were considered divine animals in both China (see Creel 1968) and Japan. For the Chinese, Edward H. Schafer says,\nHe was invested with sanctity by ancient tradition, endowed with prodigious qualities, and visibly stamped with the marks of his divine origin. A revered myth proclaimed him a relative of the dragon, akin to the mysterious powers of water. Indeed, all wonderful horses, such as the steed of the pious Hsüan-tsang which, in later legend [see the \"Xiyouji\" below], carried the sacred scriptures from India, were avatars of dragons, and in antiquity the tallest horses owned by the Chinese were called simply \"dragons.\" (1963:59) \nFor the Japanese, the ancient Shinto practice of offering \"shinme\" 神馬 \"sacred (esp. white) horses\" to shrines has evolved into the modern donation of symbolic \"Shinto ema\" 絵馬 [lit. \"picture horse\"] \"votive tablets\"'.\n\nBesides the \"mind-monkey idea-horse\" metaphor, monkeys and horses have further associations. In Chinese astrology, \"wu\" \"Horse\" and \"shen\" \"Monkey\" are the 7th and 9th of the 12 zodiacal animals. In Chinese animal mythology, monkeys supposedly bring good health to horses. The \"Bencao Gangmu\" (tr. Read 1931, no. 400) records the \"custom of keeping a female monkey in the horse's stable to ward off sickness (the menstrual discharge of the monkey is said to give immunity to the horse against infectious diseases)\".\n\nThis section summarizes Chinese and Japanese developments of \"xinyuan\" or \"shin'en\" 心猿 \"mind-monkey\" and \"yima\" or \"iba\" 意馬 \"idea-horse\" collocations and their synonyms. The earliest known textual usages are presented chronologically.\n\nChinese authors coined \"mind monkey\" expressions from the Later Qin Dynasty (384-417 CE) through the Song Dynasty (960-1279 CE). In modern usage, some terms are considered Classical Chinese, but others like \"xinyuanyima\" \"mind-monkey will-horse\" are Modern Standard Chinese. Unless otherwise noted, translations are by Carr (1993:154-159).\n\nThe c. 406 \"Weimojie suoshuo jing\" 維摩詰所說經 was Kumarajiva's groundbreaking CE Chinese translation of the \"Vimalakirti Sutra\". It introduced \"mind-monkey\" in the simile \"xin ru yuanhou\" 心如猨猴 \"heart/mind like a monkey/ape\" (with \"yuan\" 猿's variant Chinese character 猨). \"Since the mind of one difficult to convert is like an ape, govern his mind by using certain methods and it can then be broken in\" (tr. Dudbridge 1970:168). Carr (1993:169) suggests the subsequent line about \"xiang ma\" 象馬 \"elephants and horses\" having unruly natures could have affected the later \"yima\" \"idea-horse\" term.\n\nThe \"Mengyu chanhui shi\" 蒙預懺悔詩 \"Poem Repenting Foolish Pleasure\" is attributed to Emperor Jianwen of Liang (503-550 CE), who was a renowned author. This poem has the oldest known usage of \"xinyuan\" \"mind-monkey\", but with (the possibly miscopied) \"aima\" 愛馬 \"love-horse\" instead of \"yima\" 意馬 \"idea-horse\". \"The [三循/修] three disciplines/cultivations expel the [愛馬] love-horse, and the [六意/念] six recollections/ideas still the [心猿] mind-monkey.\" This Buddhistic poem has numerous graphic variants, including these \"sanxun\" 三循 \"three disciplines\" for \"sanxiu\" 三修 \"three cultivations\" (meditation on impermanence, awareness, and selflessness) and \"liuyi\" 六意 \"six ideas\" for \"liunian\" 六念 \"six recollections\" (mindfulness about Buddha, dharma, sangha, precepts, almsgiving, and heaven). Based on these contextual graphic inconsistencies, Carr (1993:156) suggests the possibility that a scribe transposed Jianwen's original \"yima\" 意馬 \"idea-horse\" as \"aima\" 愛馬 \"love-horse\".\n\nThe \"Daci'ensi sanzang fashizhuan\" 大慈恩寺三藏法師傳 \"Biography of the Tripitaka Dharma Master of the Temple of Great Compassionate Blessings\" is a biography of Xuanzang (see the \"Xiyouji\" below) written by his disciple Kuiji (or Ci'en, the namesake temple in Luoyang, see Emperor Gaozong of Tang). This record of the Consciousness-Only (Yogacara) Buddhism, has a memorial dated 657 CE that parallels \"yima\" \"idea-/will-horse\" with \"qingyuan\" 情猿 \"emotion-/feeling-monkey\": \"Now if you wish to entrust your thoughts to the Chan sect, you must make your mind as pure as still water, control your emotion-monkey's indolence and fidgeting, and restrain your idea-horse's haste and galloping.\"\n\nThe Tang Dynasty poet Xu Hun 許渾 (fl. 832-844) wrote the first known parallel between \"mind-monkey\" and \"idea-horse.\" His \"Zengti Du yinju\" 贈題杜隱居 \"Poem Written for Sir Du the Recluse\" says: \"Nature exhausts the mind-monkey's hiding, spirit disperses the idea-horse's moving/stopping. Guests who come ought to know this: both self and world are unfeeling.\"\n\nThe common \"xinyuanyima\" \"mind-monkey will-horse\" phrase dates back to a \"bianwen\" 變文 \"Vernacular Chinese transformation text\" narrative version of the \"Weimojie suoshuo jing\" (above) that was discovered in the Mogao Caves. This \"jiangjingwen\" 講經文 \"sutra lecture text\" dated 947 CE says: \"Within the indeterminable and unfathomable depths, the mind-monkey and idea-horse cease their craziness.\" \n\nThe 1075 CE \"Wuzhen pian\", which is a Daoist classic on \"Neidan\"-style internal alchemy, used \"xinyuan\" \"mind-monkey\" without \"horse\".\nThoroughly understanding the mind-monkey, the machinations in the heart, by three thousand achievements one becomes a peer of heaven. There naturally is a crucible to cook the dragon and tiger; Why is it necessary to support a household and be attached to spouse and children? (tr. Cleary 1987:118) \nCleary (1987:198) glosses \"xinyuan\" as \"the unruly mind, jumping from one object to another.\"\n\nThe Song Dynasty poet Zhu Yi 朱翌 (1098–1186 CE) reversed the Tang lyrical \"xinyuanyima\" expression into \"yimaxinyuan\" \"will-horse mind-monkey\". His \"Shuixuanshi\" 睡軒詩 \"Sleeping Porch Poem\" says: \"Haste is useless with the idea-horse and mind-monkey, so take off your baggage someplace deep within dreamland.\"\n\nThe c. 1200 \"Nan Tang shu\" 南唐書 \"History of the Southern Tang\" used the simile \"yi ru ma xin ru nao\" 意如馬心如猱 \"ideas like a horse and mind like a gibbon/monkey\". Congshan 從善 (939-987), seventh son of the figurehead Emperor Yuanzong of Southern Tang, confesses: \"Long ago in my youth, my ideas were like a horse and my mind was like a monkey. I was indolent with happiness and enjoyed lust, was pleased with rewards and forgot toil.\" \nThe c. 1590 \"Xiyouji\" 西遊記 \"\"Journey to the West\" (or \"Monkey\"\") popularized \"mind-monkey\" more than any other text. This famous Chinese novel centers upon the pilgrimage of Xuanzang to India, and frequently uses \"xinyuan\" and \"yima\" expressions (Dudbridge 1970:167, Chang 1983:200). Many are found in the couplet titles of chapters, for instance, 30 \"The evil demon attacks the true Dharma; The Horse of the Will recalls the Monkey of the Mind\". The preeminent translator Anthony C. Yu (1977:59) describes controlling the mind-monkey and will-horse as \"a theme central to the entire narrative and which receives repeated and varied developments.\" Chapter 7 has this exemplary poem:\nA monkey's transformed body weds the human mind. Mind is a monkey – this, the truth profound. The Great Sage [Buddha], Equal to Heaven, is no idle thought. For how could the post of [Bima \"Assistant of Horses\"] justly show his gifts? The Horse works with the Monkey – and this means both Mind and Will, Must firmly be harnessed and not ruled without. All things return to Nirvāna, taking this one course: In union with Tathāgata [Buddha] to live beneath twin trees. (tr. Yu 1977:168)\nMany \"Xiyouji\" scholars allegorically interpret \"xinyuan\" \"heart-/mind-monkey\" as the protagonist monkey-man Sun Wukong and \"yima\" \"idea-/will-horse\" as the dragon prince White Horse that enters the story in chapter 15. There are long-standing scholarly disagreements over whether Sun Wukong evolved from Hanuman, the monkey hero in the (3rd century BCE) \"Ramayana\". It is \"imagistically proper\" for Sun to be a monkey, says Mair (1989:662), because \"Zen thought symbolizes the restless and unbridled mind of man as an \"ape/monkey-mind\" 心猿.\"\n\nJapanese Buddhist monks not only imported Sino-Japanese vocabulary such as \"shin'en\" < \"xinyuan\" 心猿 \"mind-monkey\" and \"iba\" < \"yima\" 意馬 \"idea-horse\", but also invented analogous Japanese words like \"i'en\" 意猿 \"idea-monkey\" and \"shinba\" 心馬 \"mind-horse\". Unless otherwise noted, translations are by Carr (1993:159-161). The earliest known usages of relevant \"mind-monkey\" terminology are shown in the table below.\n\nDuring the Heian period (794-1185 CE), the Chinese \"mind-monkey\" and \"idea-horse\" were paraphrased as \"i'en\" 意猿 \"idea-monkey\" and \"shinba\" 心馬 \"mind-horse\". The 797 CE \"Sangō Shiiki\" 三教指帰 \"Indications of the Three teachings (Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism)\" was written by Kūkai, who founded esoteric Shingon Buddhism. Two passages introduced Japanese \"mind-monkey\" and \"will-horse\" neologisms. One used \"i'en\" 意猿 \"idea/will monkey\" with the common word \"nouma\" 野馬 \"wild horse\": \"The four great difficulties overexcite the wild horse's fast gallop, the twenty-six contributory causes mislead the plans of the idea-monkey.\" Another passage used \"shinba\" 心馬 \"heart/mind horse\" and \"isha\" 意車 \"idea-chariot\": \"Whip the mind-horse to gallop off in the eight directions, grease the idea chariot and gambol within the nine heavens.\"\nDuring the Kamakura period (1185–1333 CE), Pure Land Buddhism introduced the Sino-Japanese terms \"shin'en\" 心猿 \"mind-monkey\" and \"iba\" 意馬 \"idea-horse\", and an early travelogue popularized them. The \"Genkyū hōgo\" 元久法語 \"Genkyū era (1204–1206) Buddhist Sermons\" is a collection of writings by Hōnen, the founder of the Jōdo Shū. His c. 1205 \"Tozanjō 登山状 \"Mountain Climbing Description\" (tr. adapted from Carr 1993:159) uses \"iba\" with \"shin'en\": \"When you wish to enter the gate of determined goodness, then your idea-horse runs wild within the bounds of the six sense objects [\"rokujin\" 六塵 < Ayatana: \"form, sound, smell, taste, tangibility, and dharma\"]. When you wish to enter the gate of scattered goodness, then your mind-monkey gambols and jumps across the branches of the ten evil deeds [\"jūaku\" 十悪: killing, stealing, adultery, lying, cursing, slandering, equivocating, coveting, anger, and false views].\" The 1223 \"Kaidōki\" 海道記 \"Record of Coast Road Travels\" was a travelogue of the Tōkaidō (road) from Kyoto to Kamakura. It used \"shinsen\" 心船 \"heart/mind boat\" meaning \"imaginary journey\" with \"iba\" 意馬 \"idea/will horse\" and wrote \"arasaru\" 荒猿 \"wild monkey\" for \"arasu\" 荒す \"treat roughly/wildly\": \"I rowed the mind-boat for make-believe. As yet, I neither poled across myriad leagues of waves on the Coast Road, nor roughly rode the idea-horse to urge it on through clouds of the distant mountain barrier.\" \n\nDuring the early Edo period (1603–1868), the four-character Chinese collocations \"yimashinen\" 意馬心猿 and \"shinenyima\" 心猿意馬 were introduced into Japanese. The 1675 \"Man'an kana hōgo\" 卍庵仮名法語, which was a vernacular collection of Zen sermons, first used \"shin'en'iba\" 意馬心猿. \"For this reason, even if you reside somewhere with remote mountain streams and desolate tranquillity, and sit in silent contemplation, you will only be passing idle time because you are isolated from the road of the mind-monkey and idea-horse.\" The 1699 Kabuki play \"Wakoku gosuiten\" 和国五翠殿 \"Japan's Five Green Palaces\" repeatedly used \"ibashin'en\". For instance, the first act described two prisoners tied to a tree: \"They are the idea-horse and mind-monkey themselves. So if this pine tree is the pole of Absolute Reality, then these two prisoners are a greedy monkey – no, a cat – and a horse running wild; and they are just like the idea-horse and mind-monkey.\"\n\nMind monkey and monkey mind both occur in English usage, originally as translations of \"xinyuan\" or \"shin'en\" and later as culturally-independent images. Michael Carr concludes,\n\nEnglish translations of Chinese \"xinyuan\" or Japanese \"shin'en\" commonly include \"mind monkey\", \"monkey mind\", and \"monkey of the mind\".\n\nThis first list (expanded from Carr 1993:179, Table 5 Chinese-English Translation Equivalents) compares how 11 bilingual Chinese dictionaries translate \"xinyuanyima\" 心猿意馬 and \"yimaxinyuan\" 意馬心猿.\nSix of these 11 Chinese–English dictionaries enter only the common \"xinyuanyima\" \"mind-monkey idea-horse,\" 2 only the reverse \"yimaxinyuan\", and 3 enter both. Three translation equivalents give English \"ape\" rather than \"gibbon\" or \"monkey\" for \"yuan\" 猿, and \"ape\" sounds metaphorically stronger than \"monkey.\" Note how several of these dictionaries have identical translations. \n\nThis second list (expanded from Carr 1993:179, Table 7 Japanese-English Translation Equivalents) compares how 9 bilingual Japanese dictionaries translate \"ibashin'en\" 意馬心猿, none enters \"shin'en'iba\" 心猿意馬.\n\nAll 9 Japanese–English dictionaries mention \"passion\" or \"passions.\" Note how Saito's \"uncontrollable passions\" first appeared in 1930 and was copied into 6 other dictionaries. The 5 editions of Kenkyūsha's New Japanese–English Dictionary illustrate lexicographical modifications. Editors copied the \"clamorous demands of passion\" phrase from the 1st edition (\"Takenobu's …\" 1918) into all the subsequent versions. The 2nd (1931) first added \"uncontrollable\" to \"passions,\" which was copied in later editions. The 3rd edition (1954) included a literal translation \"wild horses of passions and flighty monkeys of desires\", but this was omitted from the 4th (1974) and 5th (2003, which added the definite article \"the\").\n\nExamples of \"mind monkey\" are predictably common in Chinese popular culture. For instance, \"Sam yuen yi ma\" 心猿意馬 – the Cantonese pronunciation of \"Xinyuanyima\" \"mind-monkey will-horse\" – was a 1999 Hong Kong movie (known in English as \"The Accident\") by Stanley Kwan. However, examples of \"mind monkey\" are surprisingly widespread in modern English culture. For instance, there are blogs named \"Mind Monkey!\", \"Mind of the Monkey\", \"Monkey Mind\", and \"No monkey mind\". Author Steve Michael Reedy explores the concept of the Monkey Mind through his collection of children's fantasy stories in \"Tales For Your Monkey's Mind.\"\n\nIn English-language publishing, fewer books are titled with \"mind monkey\", such as \"Master the Mind Monkey\" (Patkar 2007), than \"monkey mind\". \"Taming\" is common among \"Taming the Monkey Mind\" (Chodron 1999), \"Taming the Monkey Mind; A Guide to Pure Land Practice\" (Cheng 2000), and \"Taming Our Monkey Mind: Insight, Detachment, Identity\" (Krystal 2007). Other examples of book titles include \"Samba and the Monkey Mind\" (Williams 1965), \"Meeting the Monkey Halfway\" (Sumano and Popp 2000), \"Your Monkey Mind Connection\" (Antoinette 2007), and \"Still the Monkey\" (Alivia 2007). \n\nThe originally Buddhist \"mind monkey\" metaphor is also known in popular English-language music. \"Mad Melancholy Monkey Mind\" is a band. There are albums entitled \"Mind Monkey\" (Bill Foreman 1999), \"Monkey Mind\" (Wonder Stump, 2003), and \"Monkey Mind Control\" (Jay Roulston 2003). Song titles include \"The Monkey on the Mind\" (Dave Wilkerson 1960) and \"Monkey Mind\" (Neil Rolnick 2003).\n\n\n\n"}

Previously, he was a professor of sociology at Princeton University.\n\nA graduate of Swarthmore College, DiMaggio earned his Ph.D. in sociology from Harvard in 1979. He was the executive director of Yale's program on nonprofit organizations (1982–87), and through 1991 he was a professor in the sociology department at the university. He was a fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences (1984–85) and at the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation (1990). He also served on the Connecticut Commission on the Arts and on the board of the National Assembly of State Arts Agencies.\n\nDiMaggio's major works have been in the study of institutions and organizations and the formation of \"high culture\" in the U.S. His recent research explores social inequality in the Internet.\n\nAccording to Dimaggio, belief systems and cultural frames are imposed on and adapted by individual actors and organisations. Thus, roles are for a large part determined by larger structures.\n\nIn a much-quoted article, DiMaggio and Walter W. Powell argued that organizations, whether corporate, governmental, or non-profit, adopt business practices not because they are efficient, but because they furnish legitimacy in the eyes of outside stakeholders, e. g. lenders, government regulators, and shareholders, as they need to maintain the confidence of these often poorly-informed outside parties. This makes them less creative and innovative in their practices, and leads to institutional isomorphism.\n\nIn his cultural studies, DiMaggio's historical research documented the self-conscious creation of \"high culture\" in the late 19th-century America. DiMaggio argues that, unsettled by the weak class distinctions in growing industrial cities, local elites created a \"sophisticated\" culture (via the arts, universities, social clubs, and the like) that would separate commoners from those of high standing. DiMaggio says that \"high culture\" models developed by founders of museums and orchestras were then adopted by patrons of opera, dance, and theatre.\n\nDiMaggio's recent research considers the cultural advent of the Internet. He compares the emergence of the Internet with the rise of television in the 1950s. Television was introduced to American consumers in 1948, and within ten years 90% of households had TV. In contrast, Internet diffusion (introduced on a large scale in 1994) seems to have stalled at approximately 60% of American households. DiMaggio believes that this difference is the result of the so-called digital divide - inequalities in Internet usage by race, income, and education level. DiMaggio maintains that these inequalities were not found in the adoption of TV in the 1950s, and suggests that differences in Internet usage among social groups will continue. This remains an open question, and some recent data suggest Internet usage is growing, with more than 70% of American adults reporting that they use the Internet.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7580142", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7580142", "title": "Peter Glassen", "text": "Peter Glassen\n\nPeter Glassen (1920–1986) was a professor of philosophy at the University of Manitoba from 1949 until his death in 1986. He was previously (1948–49) a member of the psychology department at the University of Saskatchewan. He developed a considerable reputation as an analytic moral philosopher on the basis of a number of articles published in the late 1950s and early 1960s. He was also known for his arguments against metaphysical materialism.\n\nBorn in Szeged, Hungary (then the Austro-Hungarian Empire) on October 19, 1920, Glassen emigrated with his parents to Toronto, Canada in 1929, residing on Gladstone Avenue in the city's west end. He graduated from Bloor Collegiate Institute in 1940. Among other academic awards, Glassen received the R.W. Leonard Entrance Scholarship for General Proficiency from the University of Toronto, valued at what was then the very substantial sum of $900. He graduated from the university with a B.A. in 1944 and an M.A. in 1945.\n\nIn 1945, Glassen entered Harvard University, having been awarded the Philip H. Sears scholarship. There he studied with Ralph Barton Perry, C. I. Lewis, Henry D. Aiken, W. T. Stace, Henry Austryn Wolfson and others. In October 1947 he qualified for the A.M. degree and, under Aiken's supervision, continued to work on his doctoral dissertation (\"The Ethics of Shaftesbury and Hutcheson\", later changed to \"The Criterion of Rightness in Action\") for several years, but never completed his Ph.D. due to his commitments as an assistant professor.\n\nGlassen's first set of publications consisted in eight papers published in major philosophical journals in 1957, 1958 and 1959. These reflected his core interests: analytic moral theory (where he was a cognitivist and champion of ordinary language analysis), value theory (particularly the classification of, and distinctions among, moral and non-moral varieties of normative judgment), and epistemology (notably the question of the possibility of synthetic a priori knowledge). There followed a period of reduced activity, with two papers on cognitivism in 1962 and 1963, several reviews for \"Dialogue\" from 1963 to 1970, and finally a series of papers on another subject of enduring interest—the refutation of arguments against dualism—between 1976 and 1984. Glassen also authored a number of conference papers, including two that were published in the proceedings of the 12th and 13th meetings of the International Congress of Philosophy, in 1958 and 1963 respectively. Several other papers were unpublished and—with one or two exceptions—are likely lost.\n\nIn 1961, Glassen travelled to England on a Canada Council grant, meeting with many leading moral philosophers of the time, including Sir David Ross, H. B. Acton and others.\n\nGlassen's early promise was not entirely realized. This was at least partly due to the lasting effects of a personal tragedy. While returning from Toronto to Winnipeg for the beginning of the 1965-66 school year, Glassen was involved in a car accident that took the life of the other driver. Though not ultimately found at fault, Glassen never fully recovered from the shock. His scholarly output declined and he turned down an opportunity to move to the more prominent department at the University of Toronto in 1967. His career might have faded into complete obscurity had it not been for the development of eliminative materialism by fellow University of Manitoba philosophers Paul Churchland and Patricia Churchland in the 1970s. This aroused his vehement opposition and revived his interest in writing and publishing. After several years of good health, a series of illnesses in 1985-86 brought on a recurrence of depression and alcoholism, leading to his death by suicide on or about March 24, 1986 in Winnipeg.\n\n\"Some Questions about Relations\" (1957) is an analysis of the ontology of relations. Glassen argues that a relation has both properties (e.g. reflexivity (R), symmetry (S), transitivity (T)) and content. There must be content because many relations share the same set of properties while not being the same relation (e.g. \"to the left of\" and \"before\" are both [-R, -S, T]). Thus a relation \"r\" may be defined in terms of content and properties, e.g. as {r =df con, p1, p2, p3}. Glassen proceeds to point out several troubling questions that arise when we try to understand whether the relationship between content and properties is necessary or accidental. He admits in his conclusion that, \"given the Bradleyan flavour of the problems to which it gives rise\", there may be something wrong—and perhaps quite importantly wrong—with the initial distinction between content and properties. This paper was reviewed by Alonzo Church in \"The Journal of Symbolic Logic\" 32:3 (Sept. 1968), p. 408.\n\n\"A Fallacy in Aristotle's Argument about the Good\" (1957) is a close analysis of a crucial paragraph in Book I, chapter 7 of Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics. Glassen argues that Aristotle fails to show (or even to attempt to argue) that it follows from the fact that the function of a good man is activity of the soul in accordance with virtue that the good of man—his final goal—is precisely that function. This reflects Glassen's attention to the distinction between morality and the broader theory of value. Glassen's argument has been referred to in a number of subsequent papers. Aurel Kolnai, referring to the same problem although not specifically to Glassen's paper, called this the \"Aristotelian Equivocation\".\n\n\"Are There Unresolvable Moral Disputes?\" (1962) was influential in the field of ethical objectivism in its introduction of subjective bases of approval on top of the objective bases for approval outlined in emotivist theory - an introduction which made possible the resolution of moral disputes theoretically unresolvable under the emotivist theory. In a way, his work can be seen as straddling the line between emotivism and ethical objectivism.\n"}
{"id": "43756958", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43756958", "title": "Phenomenal concept strategy", "text": "Phenomenal concept strategy\n\nThe phenomenal concept strategy (PCS) is an approach within philosophy of mind to provide a physicalist response to anti-physicalist arguments like the explanatory gap and philosophical zombies. The name was coined by Daniel Stoljar. As David Chalmers put it, PCS \"locates the gap in the relationship between our \"concepts\" of physical processes and our \"concepts\" of consciousness, rather than in the relationship between physical processes and consciousness themselves.\" The idea is that if we can explain why we \"think\" there's an explanatory gap, this will defuse the motivation to question physicalism.\n\nPCS advocates typically subscribe to what Chalmers has called \"type-B materialism\", which holds that there is an epistemic but not ontological gap between physics and subjective experience. PCS maintains that our concepts are dualistic, but reality is monistic, in a similar way as \"heat\" and \"molecular motion\" are two different concepts that refer to the same property. However, phenomenal concepts are different from other concepts in that they incline us to see an epistemic gap. PCS suggests that physicalist explanations \"cannot feel satisfactory [...] since the concepts used in the physical explanation don't entail any applications of the phenomenal concepts in terms of which the explanandum is characterized.\"\n\nPCS would help physicalists answer the knowledge argument because upon seeing red, Mary would have new thoughts about phenomenal concepts, even though those thoughts would only re-express physical facts she already knew. Likewise, we can conceive of zombies even if they aren't possible because when we think about their functional/physical characteristics, we don't also conjure thoughts about phenomenal concepts.\n\nDavid Papineau coined the term \"antipathetic fallacy\" to refer to the way in which we fail to see phenomenal experience in brain processing. It's the opposite of the pathetic fallacy of seeing consciousness in non-minds.\n\nChalmers outlines several ways in which phenomenal concepts might be distinctive:\n\nThese are so-called \"type-demonstratives\" in which we point to \"one of \"those\"\". For instance:\n\nPeter Carruthers suggests that phenomenal concepts are \"purely\" recognitional, which means\n\nWe think about physical and phenomenal concepts in different ways.\n\nSeveral philosophers have suggested that phenomenal concepts denote brain states indexically, in a similar way as saying \"now\" picks out a particular time. Even given full knowledge of physics, additional indexical information is required to say where and when one is.\n\nSome contend that phenomenal states are part of the concepts that refer to them. For instance, Papineau suggests that phenomenal concepts are \"quotational\", like saying \"That state: ___.\"\n\nKatalin Balog defends a \"constitutional account\" of phenomenal concepts, in which \"token experiences serve as modes of presentation of the phenomenal properties they instantiate.\" For instance, the concept of pain is partly constituted by a token experience of pain. She claims this position helps resolve the explanatory gap because an \"a priori\" description alone doesn't suffice to express the concept; in addition, a direct experiential constitution is required. While it seems like physical/functional information about tells us all there is about it, we feel something more for phenomenality because we \"have a 'substantive' grasp of its nature.\"\n\nPapineau takes a similar position. He claims that normal physical identity statements (such as that heat is molecular kinetic energy) involve two descriptions, which we can associate in our minds. In contrast, we think about a phenomenal concept by either \"actually undergoing the experience\" or at least by imagining it, and this creates a \"what-it’s-likeness\" sensation. Then:\nPapineau compares the situation to the use–mention distinction: Phenomenal concepts directly use the experiences to which they refer, while physical descriptions merely mention them.\n\nDavid Chalmers presents \"A Master Argument\" against PCS. He defines C as the PCS thesis that\nAll three of these must hold for PCS to succeed. He defines P as all physical facts. Then he poses a dilemma:\nRegardless of which horn is true, C is invalidated.\n\nCarruthers and Veillet argue that Chalmers's argument commits a fallacy of equivocation between first-person and third-person phenomenal concepts, but the authors reformulate it to avoid that problem. They proceed to attack the revised argument by denying the premise that if zombies must have third-person phenomenal concepts, then phenomenal concepts can't account for the explanatory gap. In particular, they suggest that, pace Chalmers, people and zombies would have the same epistemic situation even though the \"contents\" of their situations would be different. For instance, a person's phenomenal concept would have content of a phenomenal state, while the \"schmenomenal\" concept of a zombie would have content about a \"schmenomenal\" state. A zombie \"is correct when he says that he is conscious, because he isn't saying that he has phenomenal states as we understand them. He is correct because he means that he has schmenomenal states, and he has them.\" So people and zombies can both have true beliefs justified in similar ways (same epistemic situation), even if those beliefs are \"about\" different things.\n\n\n"}

He began writing the play in 1606 and completed it by 1615. It was performed by students in the Hall of Christ Church, Oxford on 16 February 1618 (New Style). The play was not published in Burton's lifetime, and it remained in manuscript till 1862 when it was edited by William Edward Buckley and published by the Roxburghe Club. It was first translated into English by Paul Jordan-Smith and published by Stanford University Press, California in 1931.\n\nSince the play is about someone who pretends to be a philosopher, the term itself has been used in more recent times to refer to a pretender to philosophy.\n\nA university is established by the Duke of Osuna in the small town of Osuna in Andalusia, Spain. The university is well-endowed, and it offers salaries and other incentives for students and academics all over Europe. Unfortunately, as well as honest and reputable people, the new university also attracts 'philosophasters' or sham philosophers. These include confidence tricksters, fraudsters and others who are more interested in making money than in contributing to academic life. The play is about the havoc caused by these people and by prostitutes attracted to the town. The townspeople are outraged, and The Duke is inclined to close the university down. However, two scholars persuade him not to do so. Instead, he summons both the villains and the victims before a Tribunal. All the wrongs are righted, and the villains are punished. The two scholars are put in charge of the University which is established on a better footing. The play ends with everyone singing a hymn in praise of philosophy.\n\nThe philosophasters in the play include:\n\nThe background to the play is the Gunpowder Plot of 1605. The play was written shortly after this Catholic plot to blow up King and Parliament, and it reflects the anti-catholic feeling of the time. Burton, in fact, refers to a real Duke of Osuna who set up a university in Osuna in 1548. He chose this university because Andalusian universities were very religious, pro-catholic and peddled the worst kind of scholasticism. He is also attacking the Jesuits who were very active in his time, and the play portrays them as anti-social villains: \"The typical Jesuit is ‘a notorious Bawd, & famous Fornicator, \"lascivum pecus\", a very goat’ (AM 1.40), and the Jesuits play many ‘pranks’.\"\n\nErwin Schrödinger used the term \"philosophasters\" in his 1952 Lecture on \"Transformation and Interpretation in Quantum Mechanics\". He wrote, \"With all the milliards of dollars and pounds the governments now lavish on the promotion of physics, I maintain that nobody has ever yet been able to procure a physical system whose wave-function was known to him or to anybody else. Therefore the whole idea of predicting the results of future observations from the wave-function is, in this dogmatic form, a dream of positivist philophasters.\"\n"}

Narrowly defined, \"science\" refers to thought and behavior of professional scientists and technologists. More broadly defined, \"science\" refers to thought and behavior of any one (present or past) of any age engaged in theory construction, learning scientific or mathematical concepts, model building, hypothesis testing, scientific reasoning, problem finding or solving, or creating or working on technology.

The scholar Ge Hong (283-343 CE) immortalized \"pu\" in his pen name \"Baopuzi\" \"Master who Embraces Simplicity\" and eponymous book \"Baopuzi\".\n\n\"Pu\" can be written with either of the variant Chinese characters 樸 or 朴, which are linguistically complex.\n\nBoth 樸 and 朴 are classified as radical-phonetic characters, combining the semantically significant \"tree\" radical (commonly used for writing names of trees and wooden objects) with the phonetic indicators \"pu\" or \"bu\" .\n\nThe Chinese character \"pu\" 樸 was first recorded on Chinese bronze inscriptions from the Spring and Autumn period (771-476 BCE), and the character \"pu\" 朴 was first recorded in Chinese classics from the Warring States period (475-221 BCE).\n\nWhen the People's Republic of China promulgated simplified Chinese characters in 1956, the established variant \"pu\" 朴 (with 6 strokes) was chosen to replace the traditional Chinese character \"pu\" 樸 (with 16 strokes).\n\nOne of the two (c. 168 BCE) Mawangdui silk manuscript versions of the \"Daodejing\", discovered in 1973 by archeologists excavating a tomb, uses a rare textual variant character for \"pu\" 樸: \"wò\" 楃 \"a house tent (esp. with a wooden roof)\", written with the \"tree radical\" and \"wu\" 屋 \"room; house\" phonetic. The \"B\" text, like the received version, uses \"pu\" 樸 8 times in 6 chapters; the \"A\" text uses \"wò\" 楃 6 times in 4 chapters and has lacunae in chapters 19 and 57. The (c. 121 CE) \"Shuowen jiezi\" defines \"wo\" 楃 as \"muzhang\" 木帳 \"wood canopy\", and the (early 3rd century) \"Guangya\" defines it as \"choumu\" 幬幕 \"curtain; cover\". These variant words \"pú\" < *\"phrôk\" 樸 \"unworked wood\" and \"wò\" < *\"ʔôk\" 楃 \"house tent\" are semantically and phonologically dissimilar.\n\nThe comprehensive Chinese character dictionary \"Hanyu Da Zidian\" (1987: 2:1291, 2:1154) lists 2 pronunciations and 8 meanings for the character 樸, and 6 pronunciations and 11 meanings for 朴; which are summarized below.\n\nThe graph 樸 can be read:\n\nThe graph 朴 can be read to mean:\n\nThe \"Erya\", which is the oldest Chinese dictionary, defined \"pu\" 樸 and \"supu\" 樕樸 as \"oak\" names (in \"Explaining Trees\" chapter 14). First, \"pu\" 樸 is defined as \"bao\" 枹 (14:45). Guo Pu's \"Erya\" commentary identified this \"pu\" tree as \"yupu\" 棫樸 \"\"Quercus acutissima\", saw-tooth oak\" (which occurs in the \"Shijing\" below). \"Bao\" 枹 is usually read \"fu\" \"drumstick\", and Guo noted this name \"bao\" denoted \"a kind of oak [樸] that grew in clumps\", and quotes the \"Shijing\" usage as \"baoli\" 枹櫟 instead of \"baoli\" 苞櫟 \"bushy oak\" (see below). The \"Bencao Gangmu\" says there are two varieties of \"hu\" 槲 \"\"Quercus mongolica\", Mongolian oak\", the \"bao\" 枹 is small and grows in clumps while the \"li\" 櫟 is tall and has large leaves. Second, \"supu\" 樕樸 is defined as \"xin\" 心 \"heart; mind\" (14:64). Guo identifies \"supu\" (cf. reverse \"pusu\" 樸樕 in the \"Shijing\" below) as \"husu\" 槲樕 (with \"hu\" 槲 \"Mongolian oak\"), the \"\"Quercus dentata\", daimyo oak\". While \"xin\" \"heart; mind\" is a common Chinese word, this \"Erya\" definition is the only known context in which it names a tree. The \"Yijing\" uses \"xin\" to mean \"thorn; prick\", (tr. Wilhelm 1967:277): \"Among varieties of wood it means those which are firm and have much pith\".\n\nThe \"Shuowen Jiezi\", the first Chinese dictionary of characters, simply defines \"pu\" 朴 as \"mupi\" 木皮 \"tree bark; wood with bark\", and \"pu\" 樸 as \"musu\" 木素 \"plain wood; unworked lumber\" (later meaning \"lignin\" in scientific terminology).\n\nReturning to the central Daoist meaning of \"pu\", \nPas and Leung (1998:351) challenge the stereotyped \"uncarved block\" translation of \"pu\": \"The idea implied in it comes closer to \"wholeness,\" which is also contained in \"uncarved block,\" except that \"uncarved block\" has been reified. As a result, what was an excellent analogy of the Tao has become sterile and counterproductive.\" \nCiting the \"pu\" translations of Séraphin Couvreur (1890:475) \"wood that has not been worked on; simple, without ornament, without disguise\" and Bernhard Karlgren (1923:231) \"wood in its natural state, not worked: rough, plain, natural, simple\"; Pas and Leung conclude, \"it is obvious where the expression \"uncarved block\" came from, but the addition of \"block\" is an interpretation. The term means \"plain wood,\" \"uncarved wood.\"\"\n\nReconstructions of Old Chinese pronunciations have transformed Chinese etymology. Old Chinese reconstructions of \"pu\" or \"bu\" 樸 include: \n\nVictor Mair (1990:138) suggests that \"pu\" < *\"phluk\" 樸 \"unhewn log\" is \"almost certainly related to the English word \"block,\" which probably derives from the Indo-European root \"bhelk\" (beam).\"\n\nAxel Schuessler (2007:418) says the etymology of \"pú\" < *\"phrôk\" \"to trim wood\" could either be an \"aspirated iterative derivation\" from \"bāo\" < *\"prôk\" 剝 \"cut up, peel, pluck\", or \"belong to the homophonous etymon with the basic meaning 'in a natural state, unworked', as in \"pú\" 樸 'in a natural state', 璞 'unworked precious stone'.\"\n\n\"Pu\" occurs in some of the earliest Chinese classics, frequently in Daoist ones.\n\nTwo odes in the \"Shijing\" \"Classic of Poetry\" use \"pu\" 樸 compounds to mean \"an oak\".\n\n\"Pusu\" 樸樕 occurs in Ode 23: \"scrubby oaks\" (Legge 1879:34), \"a clump of oaks\" (Waley 1937:60), \"low shrubby trees\" (Karlgren 1950:13). The Mao commentary describes the \"pusu\" as a 小木 \"small tree\". The \"Erya\" (above) writes this reversible compound as \"supu\" 樕樸.\n\n\"Yupu\" 棫樸 is the name of Ode 238, which records using this tree for firewood: \"the \"yih\" and the \"p'oh\"\" (Legge 1879:442), \"the oak clumps\" (Waley 1937:266, Karlgren 1950:191). Commentaries describe the \"yupu\" as a \"dense and shrubby tree\".\n\nIn addition, Ode 132 has \"baoli\" 苞櫟: \"the bushy oaks\" (Legge 1879:201), \"a clump of oaks\" (Waley 1937:75), \"luxuriant oaks\" (Karlgren 1950:85). The \"Erya\" has \"baoli\" 枹櫟, writing \"bao\" as 枹 \"an oak\" instead of 苞 \"bushy; luxuriant\".\n\nThe \"Shujing\" \"Classic of History\" (\"Zhoushu\" 周書, \"Zicai\" 梓材 \"Chinese catalpa lumber\" section) uses \"pu\" once in the compound \"pozhou\" 樸斫 (\"po\" \"trim unworked wood\" and \"zhuo\" \"hack; chop off\"): \"as in working with the wood of the rottlera, when the toil of the coarser and finer operations has been completed, they have to apply the paint of red and other colours\" (Legge 1899:417), \"It is as when one works on catalpa wood; when he has toiled in trimming and carving it, he should take measures for making it red or green\" (Karlgren 1950:48). Legge notes that \"pu\" means \"the rough fashioning of the work\" and \"zhou\" means \"the fine finish given to it\". Karlgren (1970:313) quotes the Han commentator Ma Rong that \"po\" 樸 denotes \"wood that has not yet been worked into a utensil; unworked wood\", and concludes \"po\" means \"to treat the unworked wood (in the first rough cutting); to trim\" is a variation of the same stem as \"pu\" 樸 \"in a natural state; simple\".\n\nSix \"Daodejing\" chapters use \"pu\" 樸, two of them twice, for a total of 8 occurrences. \n\nChapter 19 parallels the near-synonyms \"su\" \"raw silk; white; plain; simple; quiet\" and \"pu\" 樸 \"unworked wood; plain; simple\", and was the source for Ge Hong's pen-name Baopuzi \"Master who Embraces Simplicity\". \nHolmes Welch (1957:35) describes \"pu\" \"the Uncarved Block\" and \"su\" \"Raw Silk\" as symbols that Laozi used to expound his basic doctrine of \"the return to our original nature\". In modern usage, \"pu\" and \"su\" mean \"plain,\" but originally \"pu\" \"was wood as it came from the tree before man had dressed it\", while \"su\" \"was silk that man had never dyed or painted.\" \n\nChapters 28 and 57 mention simple \"pu\" in reference to \"shengren\" \"sages\", Chapter 15 similarly refers to ancient Daoist adepts and describes \"pu\" as \"dun\" \"sincere; honest; plain\".\nAmong all the \"Daodejing\" occurrences of \"pu\", chapter 28 is the only case in which the transmitted and excavated versions are significantly different – the transmitted text has an extra grammatical particle \"zhi\" 之 \"a possessive marker; a 3rd person pronoun\" after \"yong\" 用 \"use; employ\". Robert G. Henricks (1989:242) explains this small grammatical change between the standard text saying the sage \"yong zhi\" \"uses it\" and the excavated silk text saying \"yong\" \"is used\". The transmitted version 樸散則為器聖人用之則為官長 \"When the uncarved wood is broken up, it is turned into concrete things. But when the sage uses it, he becomes the leading official.\" should be read 樸散則為器聖人用則為官長 \"When uncarved wood is cut up, it's turned into vessels. When the Sage is used, he becomes the Head of Officials.\" D. C. Lau (1989:183) says the traditional passage \"seems to say that when the uncarved block shatters it becomes vessels. A vessel is a specialist who is only fitted to be an official. Hence the sage when he makes use of these vessels becomes the lord over the officials.\", but in Mawangdui passage, \"The meaning is very different. The uncarved block is a symbol for the sage. Just as the uncarved block becomes vessels when it shatters so does the sage become the chief of the officials when he allows himself to be employed, and just as the uncarved block is ruined when it becomes useful, so does a sage become ruined when he becomes useful.\" The word \"qi\" 器 \"vessel; utensil\" is translated here as \"tools\", \"concrete things\", \"vessels\", \"specialists\", and \"officials\".\n\nChapters 32 and 37 both address \"houwang\" 侯王 \"feudal lords and kings\" and describe the \"Dao\" as \"wuming\" \"nameless\", while 37 also calls \"pu\" \"nameless\".\nChapter 37 has a minor textual difference between \"buyu\" 不欲 \"not desire\" in the standard version and \"buru\" 不辱 \"not disgrace\" in the Mawangdui version (Henricks 1989:260).\n\nLau (1989:xxx) explains \"pu\" in the \"Daodejing\" primarily means \"the uncarved block is in a state as yet untouched by the artificial interference of human ingenuity and so is a symbol for the original state of man before desire is produced in him by artificial means\".\n\nThe (c. 3rd century CE) \"Heshang Gong\" commentary version of this Daoist text interchangeably writes \"pu\" as both 樸 and 朴. Three chapters (28, 32, 37) use 樸 in both text and commentary, and one (15) uses 朴 in both. One (19) uses 樸 in text and 朴 in commentary, and another (57) uses 朴 in text and 樸 in commentary.\n\nOf nine \"Daodejing\" chapters without 樸 or 朴 in the text, three (3, 38, 41) use 樸 in commentary, and six (17, 64, 68, 71, 80, 81) use 朴. For examples, \n\nWelch (1957:84) paraphrases the \"Daodejing\" relationship among \"pu\", \"de\" \"inherent character; inner power\", and \"wuwei\" \"non-action; non-doing\". Outwardly, one cannot achieve \"de\" \"until you have erased the aggressive patterns etched by society into your nature. You must return to your natural self, to [\"pu\"]. You must discard morality and ambition, for if you keep these you will never be capable of compassion, moderation, and humility. When you discard some of your wishes, you will have them all.\" Inwardly, one performs several cultivations. \"For, to achieve the outward [\"pu\"] you will have to cultivate a [\"wuwei\"] of the mind. And when the mind is quiet, [\"pu\"] will deepen. It will become a faculty for intuitively sensing the order of the universe—the [Dao] that can be named.\"\n\n\"Pu\" occurs 20 times in the (ca. 3rd century BCE) Daoist classic \"Zhuangzi\". The standard \"Zhuangzi\" text writes \"pu\" both with the 16–stroke character 樸 six times in three chapters (9, 13, and 31) and with the 6–stroke variant character 朴 fourteen times in six chapters (7, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 20), which evidences the heterogeneous textual origins. For instance, the word \"pubi\" (with \"bi\" 鄙 \"low; mean; vulgar; unsophisticated\") is written both樸鄙 \"crude, mean [heart]\" (chapter 31, tr. Mair 1994:332) and 朴鄙 \"simple and unsophisticated [people]\" (10, tr. Mair 1994:87).\n\nA frequently occurring \"Zhuangzi\" metaphor contrasts returning to \"pu\" 樸 \"unhewn log\" with carving \"qi\" 器 \"vessels\" (which means \"specialist; official\" in \"Daodejing\" 28). \n\nAnother \"Zhuangzi\" chapter uses this term \"fupu\" 復朴 \"return to simplicity\".\n\n\n\n"}

While, technically, \"pāramī\" and \"pāramitā\" are both Pāli terms, Pali literature makes far greater reference to \"pāramī\".\n\nDonald S. Lopez, Jr. describes the etymology of the term:\nTheravada teachings on the \"pāramīs\" can be found in late canonical books and post-canonical commentaries.\n\nIn the Pāli Canon, the \"Buddhavaṃsa\" lists the ten perfections (\"dasa pāramiyo\") as:\n\n\nTwo of the above virtues, mettā and \"upekkhā\", also are brahmavihāras.\n\nThe Theravādin teachings on the pāramīs can be found in canonical books (\"Jataka tales\", \"Apadāna\", \"Buddhavaṃsa\", \"Cariyāpiṭaka\") and post-canonical commentaries written to supplement the Pāli Canon at a later time, and thus might not be an original part of the Theravādin teachings. The oldest parts of the \"Sutta Piṭaka\" (for example, \"Majjhima Nikāya\", \"Digha Nikāya\", \"Saṃyutta Nikāya\" and the \"Aṅguttara Nikāya\") do not have any mention of the pāramīs as a category (though they are all mentioned individually).\n\nSome scholars even refer to the teachings of the pāramīs as a semi-Mahāyāna teaching added to the scriptures at a later time in order to appeal to the interests and needs of the lay community and to popularize their religion. However, these views rely on the early scholarly presumption of Mahāyāna originating with religious devotion and appeal to laity. More recently, scholars have started to open up early Mahāyāna literature, which is very ascetic and expounds the ideal of the monk's life in the forest. Therefore, the practice of the pāramitās in Buddhism is close to the ideals of the ascetic tradition of the śramaṇa.\n\nBodhi (2005) maintains that, in the earliest Buddhist texts (which he identifies as the first four \"nikāyas\"), those seeking the extinction of suffering (\"nibbana\") pursued the noble eightfold path. As time went on, a backstory was provided for the multi-life development of the Buddha; as a result, the ten perfections were identified as part of the path for the bodhisattva (Pāli: \"bodhisatta\"). Over subsequent centuries, the \"pāramīs\" were seen as being significant for aspirants to both Buddhahood and arahantship. Thus, Bodhi (2005) summarizes:\n\nIn Mahāyāna Buddhism, the Prajñapāramitā sūtras, the \"Lotus Sutra\" and a large number of other texts list the six perfections:\n\n\nNote that this list is also mentioned by the Theravāda commentator Dhammapala, who says it is equivalent to the above list of ten.\n\nIn the \"Ten Stages Sutra\", four more pāramitās are listed:\n\nAccording to the perspective of Tibetan Buddhism, Mahāyāna practitioners have the choice of two practice paths: the path of perfection (Sanskrit: \"pāramitāyāna\") or the path of tantra (Sanskrit: \"tantrayāna\"), which is the Vajrayāna.\n\nTraleg Kyabgon Rinpoche renders \"pāramitā\" into English as \"transcendent action\" and then frames and qualifies it:\nThe pure illusory body is said to be endowed with the six perfections (Sanskrit: \"ṣatpāramitā\").\n\nThe first four perfections are skillful means practice while the last two are wisdom practice. These contain all the methods and skills required for eliminating delusion and fulfilling other's needs. Also, leading from happy to happier states.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7850102", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7850102", "title": "Quantum mind", "text": "Quantum mind\n\nThe quantum mind or quantum consciousness group of hypotheses propose that classical mechanics cannot explain consciousness. It posits that quantum mechanical phenomena, such as quantum entanglement and superposition, may play an important part in the brain's function and could contribute to form the basis of an explanation of consciousness.\n\nHypotheses have been proposed about ways for quantum effects to be involved in the process of consciousness, but even those who advocate them admit that the hypotheses remain unproven, and possibly unprovable. Some of the proponents propose experiments that could demonstrate quantum consciousness, but the experiments have not yet been possible to perform.\n\nQuantum mechanical terms are commonly misinterpreted to enable pseudoscience. Phenomena such as nonlocality and the observer effect are vaguely attributed to consciousness, resulting in quantum mysticism. According to Sean Carroll, \"No theory in the history of science has been more misused and abused by cranks and charlatans—and misunderstood by people struggling in good faith with difficult ideas.\" Prominent scientific skeptic Lawrence Krauss also conveyed that \"No area of physics stimulates more nonsense in the public arena than quantum mechanics.\"\n\nEugene Wigner developed the idea that quantum mechanics has something to do with the workings of the mind. He proposed that the wave function collapses due to its interaction with consciousness. Freeman Dyson argued that \"mind, as manifested by the capacity to make choices, is to some extent inherent in every electron.\"\n\nOther contemporary physicists and philosophers considered these arguments to be unconvincing. Victor Stenger characterized quantum consciousness as a \"myth\" having \"no scientific basis\" that \"should take its place along with gods, unicorns and dragons.\"\n\nDavid Chalmers argued against quantum consciousness. He instead discussed how quantum mechanics may relate to dualistic consciousness. Chalmers is skeptical of the ability of any new physics to resolve the hard problem of consciousness.\n\nDavid Bohm viewed quantum theory and relativity as contradictory, which implied a more fundamental level in the universe. He claimed both quantum theory and relativity pointed towards this deeper theory, which he formulated as a quantum field theory. This more fundamental level was proposed to represent an undivided wholeness and an implicate order, from which arises the explicate order of the universe as we experience it.\n\nBohm's proposed implicate order applies both to matter and consciousness. He suggested that it could explain the relationship between them. He saw mind and matter as projections into our explicate order from the underlying implicate order. Bohm claimed that when we look at matter, we see nothing that helps us to understand consciousness.\n\nBohm discussed the experience of listening to music. He believed the feeling of movement and change that make up our experience of music derive from holding the immediate past and the present in the brain together. The musical notes from the past are transformations rather than memories. The notes that were implicate in the immediate past become explicate in the present. Bohm viewed this as consciousness emerging from the implicate order.\n\nBohm saw the movement, change or flow, and the coherence of experiences, such as listening to music, as a manifestation of the implicate order. He claimed to derive evidence for this from Jean Piaget's work on infants. He held these studies to show that young children learn about time and space because they have a \"hard-wired\" understanding of movement as part of the implicate order. He compared this \"hard-wiring\" to Chomsky's theory that grammar is \"hard-wired\" into human brains.\n\nBohm never proposed a specific means by which his proposal could be falsified, nor a neural mechanism through which his \"implicate order\" could emerge in a way relevant to consciousness. Bohm later collaborated on Karl Pribram's holonomic brain theory as a model of quantum consciousness.\n\nAccording to philosopher Paavo Pylkkänen, Bohm's suggestion \"leads naturally to the assumption that the physical correlate of the logical thinking process is at the classically describable level of the brain, while the basic thinking process is at the quantum-theoretically describable level.\"\n\nTheoretical physicist Roger Penrose and anaesthesiologist Stuart Hameroff collaborated to produce the theory known as Orchestrated Objective Reduction (Orch-OR). Penrose and Hameroff initially developed their ideas separately and later collaborated to produce Orch-OR in the early 1990s. The theory was reviewed and updated by the authors in late 2013.\n\nPenrose's argument stemmed from Gödel's incompleteness theorems. In Penrose's first book on consciousness, \"The Emperor's New Mind\" (1989), he argued that while a formal system cannot prove its own consistency, Gödel’s unprovable results are provable by human mathematicians. He took this disparity to mean that human mathematicians are not formal proof systems and are not running a computable algorithm. According to Bringsjorg and Xiao, this line of reasoning is based on fallacious equivocation on the meaning of computation. In the same book, Penrose wrote, \"One might speculate, however, that somewhere deep in the brain, cells are to be found of single quantum sensitivity. If this proves to be the case, then quantum mechanics will be significantly involved in brain activity.\"\n\nPenrose determined wave function collapse was the only possible physical basis for a non-computable process. Dissatisfied with its randomness, Penrose proposed a new form of wave function collapse that occurred in isolation and called it \"objective reduction\". He suggested each quantum superposition has its own piece of spacetime curvature and that when these become separated by more than one Planck length they become unstable and collapse. Penrose suggested that \"objective reduction\" represented neither randomness nor algorithmic processing but instead a non-computable influence in spacetime geometry from which mathematical understanding and, by later extension, consciousness derived.\n\nHameroff provided a hypothesis that microtubules would be suitable hosts for quantum behavior. Microtubules are composed of tubulin protein dimer subunits. The dimers each have hydrophobic pockets that are 8 nm apart and that may contain delocalized pi electrons. Tubulins have other smaller non-polar regions that contain pi electron-rich indole rings separated by only about 2 nm. Hameroff proposed that these electrons are close enough to become entangled. Hameroff originally suggested the tubulin-subunit electrons would form a Bose–Einstein condensate, but this was discredited. He then proposed a Frohlich condensate, a hypothetical coherent oscillation of dipolar molecules. However, this too was experimentally discredited.\n\nHowever, Orch-OR made numerous false biological predictions, and is not an accepted model of brain physiology. In other words, there is a missing link between physics and neuroscience, for instance, the proposed predominance of 'A' lattice microtubules, more suitable for information processing, was falsified by Kikkawa \"et al.\", who showed all in vivo microtubules have a 'B' lattice and a seam. The proposed existence of gap junctions between neurons and glial cells was also falsified. Orch-OR predicted that microtubule coherence reaches the synapses via dendritic lamellar bodies (DLBs), however De Zeeuw \"et al.\" proved this impossible, by showing that DLBs are located micrometers away from gap junctions.\n\nIn January 2014, Hameroff and Penrose claimed that the discovery of quantum vibrations in microtubules by Anirban Bandyopadhyay of the National Institute for Materials Science in Japan in March 2013 corroborates the Orch-OR theory.\n\nAlthough these theories are stated in a scientific framework, it is difficult to separate them from the personal opinions of the scientist. The opinions are often based on intuition or subjective ideas about the nature of consciousness. For example, Penrose wrote, my own point of view asserts that you can't even simulate conscious activity. What's going on in conscious thinking is something you couldn't properly imitate at all by computer... If something behaves as though it's conscious, do you say it is conscious? People argue endlessly about that. Some people would say, 'Well, you've got to take the operational viewpoint; we don't know what consciousness is. How do you judge whether a person is conscious or not? Only by the way they act. You apply the same criterion to a computer or a computer-controlled robot.' Other people would say, 'No, you can't say it feels something merely because it behaves as though it feels something.' My view is different from both those views. The robot wouldn't even behave convincingly as though it was conscious unless it really was — which I say it couldn't be, if it's entirely computationally controlled.\n\nPenrose continues, A lot of what the brain does you could do on a computer. I'm not saying that all the brain's action is completely different from what you do on a computer. I am claiming that the actions of consciousness are something different. I'm not saying that consciousness is beyond physics, either — although I'm saying that it's beyond the physics we know now... My claim is that there has to be something in physics that we don't yet understand, which is very important, and which is of a noncomputational character. It's not specific to our brains; it's out there, in the physical world. But it usually plays a totally insignificant role. It would have to be in the bridge between quantum and classical levels of behavior — that is, where quantum measurement comes in.\n\nIn response, W. Daniel Hillis replied, \"Penrose has committed the classical mistake of putting humans at the center of the universe. His argument is essentially that he can't imagine how the mind could be as complicated as it is without having some magic elixir brought in from some new principle of physics, so therefore it must involve that. It's a failure of Penrose's imagination... It's true that there are unexplainable, uncomputable things, but there's no reason whatsoever to believe that the complex behavior we see in humans is in any way related to uncomputable, unexplainable things.\"\n\nLawrence Krauss is also blunt in criticizing Penrose's ideas. He said, \"Well, Roger Penrose has given lots of new-age crackpots ammunition by suggesting that at some fundamental scale, quantum mechanics might be relevant for consciousness. When you hear the term 'quantum consciousness,' you should be suspicious... Many people are dubious that Penrose's suggestions are reasonable, because the brain is not an isolated quantum-mechanical system.\"\n\nHiroomi Umezawa and collaborators proposed a quantum field theory of memory storage. Giuseppe Vitiello and Walter Freeman proposed a dialog model of the mind. This dialog takes place between the classical and the quantum parts of the brain. Their quantum field theory models of brain dynamics are fundamentally different from the Penrose-Hameroff theory.\n\nKarl Pribram's holonomic brain theory (quantum holography) invoked quantum mechanics to explain higher order processing by the mind. He argued that his holonomic model solved the binding problem. Pribram collaborated with Bohm in his work on the quantum approaches to mind and he provided evidence on how much of the processing in the brain was done in wholes. He proposed that ordered water at dendritic membrane surfaces might operate by structuring Bose-Einstein condensation supporting quantum dynamics.\n\nAlthough Subhash Kak's work is not directly related to that of Pribram, he likewise proposed that the physical substrate to neural networks has a quantum basis, but asserted that the quantum mind has machine-like limitations. He points to a role for quantum theory in the distinction between machine intelligence and biological intelligence, but that in itself cannot explain all aspects of consciousness. He has proposed that the mind remains oblivious of its quantum nature due to the principle of veiled nonlocality.\n\nHenry Stapp proposed that quantum waves are reduced only when they interact with consciousness. He argues from the Orthodox Quantum Mechanics of John von Neumann that the quantum state collapses when the observer selects one among the alternative quantum possibilities as a basis for future action. The collapse, therefore, takes place in the expectation that the observer associated with the state. Stapp's work drew criticism from scientists such as David Bourget and Danko Georgiev. Georgiev criticized Stapp's model in two respects: \n\nStapp has responded to both of Georgiev's objections.\n\nBritish philosopher David Pearce defends what he calls physicalistic idealism (\"\"Physicalistic idealism\" is the non-materialist physicalist claim that reality is fundamentally experiential and that the natural world is exhaustively described by the equations of physics and their solutions [...],\" and has conjectured that unitary conscious minds are physical states of quantum coherence (neuronal superpositions). This conjecture is, according to Pearce, amenable to falsification unlike most theories of consciousness, and Pearce has outlined an experimental protocol describing how the hypothesis could be tested using matter-wave interferometry to detect nonclassical interference patterns of neuronal superpositions at the onset of thermal decoherence. Pearce admits that his ideas are \"highly speculative,\" \"counterintuitive,\" and \"incredible.\"\n\nThese hypotheses of the quantum mind remain hypothetical speculation, as Penrose and Pearce admitted in their discussion. Until they make a prediction that is tested by experiment, the hypotheses aren't based in empirical evidence. According to Lawrence Krauss, \"It is true that quantum mechanics is extremely strange, and on extremely small scales for short times, all sorts of weird things happen. And in fact we can make weird quantum phenomena happen. But what quantum mechanics doesn't change about the universe is, if you want to change things, you still have to do something. You can't change the world by thinking about it.\"\n\nThe process of testing the hypotheses with experiments is fraught with problems, including conceptual/theoretical, practical, and ethical issues.\n\nThe idea that a quantum effect is necessary for consciousness to function is still in the realm of philosophy. Penrose proposes that it is necessary. But other theories of consciousness do not indicate that it is needed. For example, Daniel Dennett proposed a theory called multiple drafts model that doesn't indicate that quantum effects are needed. The theory is described in Dennett's book, \"Consciousness Explained\", published in 1991. A philosophical argument on either side isn't scientific proof, although the philosophical analysis can indicate key differences in the types of models, and they can show what type of experimental differences might be observed. But since there isn't a clear consensus among philosophers, it isn't conceptual support that a quantum mind theory is needed.\n\nThere are computers that are specifically designed to compute using quantum mechanical effects. Quantum computing is computing using quantum-mechanical phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement. They are different from binary digital electronic computers based on transistors. Whereas common digital computing requires that the data be encoded into binary digits (bits), each of which is always in one of two definite states (0 or 1), quantum computation uses quantum bits, which can be in superpositions of states. One of the greatest challenges is controlling or removing quantum decoherence. This usually means isolating the system from its environment as interactions with the external world cause the system to decohere. Currently, some quantum computers require their qubits to be cooled to 20 millikelvins in order to prevent significant decoherence. As a result, time consuming tasks may render some quantum algorithms inoperable, as maintaining the state of qubits for a long enough duration will eventually corrupt the superpositions. There aren't any obvious analogies between the functioning of quantum computers and the human brain. Some of the hypothetical models of quantum mind have proposed mechanisms for maintaining quantum coherence in the brain, but they have not been shown to operate.\n\nQuantum entanglement is a physical phenomenon often invoked for quantum mind models. This effect occurs when pairs or groups of particles interact so that the quantum state of each particle cannot be described independently of the other(s), even when the particles are separated by a large distance. Instead, a quantum state has to be described for the whole system. Measurements of physical properties such as position, momentum, spin, and polarization, performed on entangled particles are found to be correlated. If one of the particles is measured, the same property of the other particle immediately adjusts to maintain the conservation of the physical phenomenon. According to the formalism of quantum theory, the effect of measurement happens instantly, no matter how far apart the particles are. It is not possible to use this effect to transmit classical information at faster-than-light speeds (see Faster-than-light § Quantum mechanics). Entanglement is broken when the entangled particles decohere through interaction with the environment; for example, when a measurement is made or the particles undergo random collisions or interactions. According to David Pearce, \"In neuronal networks, ion-ion scattering, ion-water collisions, and long-range Coulomb interactions from nearby ions all contribute to rapid decoherence times; but thermally-induced decoherence is even harder experimentally to control than collisional decoherence.\" He anticipated that quantum effects would have to be measured in femtoseconds, a trillion times faster than the rate at which neurons function (milliseconds).\n\nAnother possible conceptual approach is to use quantum mechanics as an analogy to understand a different field of study like consciousness, without expecting that the laws of quantum physics will apply. An example of this approach is the idea of Schrödinger's cat. Erwin Schrödinger described how one could, in principle, create entanglement of a large-scale system by making it dependent on an elementary particle in a superposition. He proposed a scenario with a cat in a locked steel chamber, wherein the cat's life or death depended on the state of a radioactive atom, whether it had decayed and emitted radiation or not. According to Schrödinger, the Copenhagen interpretation implies that \"the cat remains both alive and dead\" until the state has been observed. Schrödinger did not wish to promote the idea of dead-and-alive cats as a serious possibility; on the contrary, he intended the example to illustrate the absurdity of the existing view of quantum mechanics. However, since Schrödinger's time, other interpretations of the mathematics of quantum mechanics have been advanced by physicists, some of which regard the \"alive and dead\" cat superposition as quite real. Schrödinger's famous thought experiment poses the question, \"\"when\" does a quantum system stop existing as a superposition of states and become one or the other?\" In the same way, it is possible to ask whether the brain's act of making a decision is analogous to having a superposition of states of two decision outcomes, so that making a decision means \"opening the box\" to reduce the brain from a combination of states to one state. But even Schrödinger didn't think this really happened to the cat; he didn't think the cat was literally alive and dead at the same time. This analogy about making a decision uses a formalism that is derived from quantum mechanics, but it doesn't indicate the actual mechanism by which the decision is made. In this way, the idea is similar to quantum cognition. This field clearly distinguishes itself from the quantum mind as it is not reliant on the hypothesis that there is something micro-physical quantum mechanical about the brain. Quantum cognition is based on the quantum-like paradigm, generalized quantum paradigm, or quantum structure paradigm that information processing by complex systems such as the brain can be mathematically described in the framework of quantum information and quantum probability theory. This model uses quantum mechanics only as an analogy, but doesn't propose that quantum mechanics is the physical mechanism by which it operates. For example, quantum cognition proposes that some decisions can be analyzed as if there are interference between two alternatives, but it is not a physical quantum interference effect.\n\nThe demonstration of a quantum mind effect by experiment is necessary. Is there a way to show that consciousness is impossible without a quantum effect? Can a sufficiently complex digital, non-quantum computer be shown to be incapable of consciousness? Perhaps a quantum computer will show that quantum effects are needed. In any case, complex computers that are either digital or quantum computers may be built. These could demonstrate which type of computer is capable of conscious, intentional thought. But they don't exist yet, and no experimental test has been demonstrated.\n\nQuantum mechanics is a mathematical model that can provide some extremely accurate numerical predictions. Richard Feynman called quantum electrodynamics, based on the quantum mechanics formalism, \"the jewel of physics\" for its extremely accurate predictions of quantities like the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron and the Lamb shift of the energy levels of hydrogen. So it is not impossible that the model could provide an accurate prediction about consciousness that would confirm that a quantum effect is involved. If the mind depends on quantum mechanical effects, the true proof is to find an experiment that provides a calculation that can be compared to an experimental measurement. It has to show a measurable difference between a classical computation result in a brain and one that involves quantum effects.\n\nThe main theoretical argument against the quantum mind hypothesis is the assertion that quantum states in the brain would lose coherency before they reached a scale where they could be useful for neural processing. This supposition was elaborated by Tegmark. His calculations indicate that quantum systems in the brain decohere at sub-picosecond timescales. No response by a brain has shows computation results or reactions on this fast of a timescale. Typical reactions are on the order of milliseconds, trillions of times longer than sub-picosecond time scales.\n\nDaniel Dennett uses an experimental result in support of his Multiple Drafts Model of an optical illusion that happens on a time scale of less than a second or so. In this experiment, two different colored lights, with an angular separation of a few degrees at the eye, are flashed in succession. If the interval between the flashes is less than a second or so, the first light that is flashed appears to move across to the position of the second light. Furthermore, the light seems to change color as it moves across the visual field. A green light will appear to turn red as it seems to move across to the position of a red light. Dennett asks how we could see the light change color before the second light is observed. Velmans argues that the cutaneous rabbit illusion, another illusion that happens in about a second, demonstrates that there is a delay while modelling occurs in the brain and that this delay was discovered by Libet. These slow illusions that happen at times of less than a second don't support a proposal that the brain functions on the picosecond time scale.\n\nAccording to David Pearce, a demonstration of picosecond effects is \"the fiendishly hard part – feasible in principle, but an experimental challenge still beyond the reach of contemporary molecular matter-wave interferometry. ...The conjecture predicts that we'll discover the interference signature of sub-femtosecond macro-superpositions.\"\n\nPenrose says,The problem with trying to use quantum mechanics in the action of the brain is that if it were a matter of quantum nerve signals, these nerve signals would disturb the rest of the material in the brain, to the extent that the quantum coherence would get lost very quickly. You couldn't even attempt to build a quantum computer out of ordinary nerve signals, because they're just too big and in an environment that's too disorganized. Ordinary nerve signals have to be treated classically. But if you go down to the level of the microtubules, then there's an extremely good chance that you can get quantum-level activity inside them.\n\nFor my picture, I need this quantum-level activity in the microtubules; the activity has to be a large scale thing that goes not just from one microtubule to the next but from one nerve cell to the next, across large areas of the brain. We need some kind of coherent activity of a quantum nature which is weakly coupled to the computational activity that Hameroff argues is taking place along the microtubules.\n\nThere are various avenues of attack. One is directly on the physics, on quantum theory, and there are certain experiments that people are beginning to perform, and various schemes for a modification of quantum mechanics. I don't think the experiments are sensitive enough yet to test many of these specific ideas. One could imagine experiments that might test these things, but they'd be very hard to perform.\n\nA demonstration of a quantum effect in the brain has to explain this problem or explain why it is not relevant, or that the brain somehow circumvents the problem of the loss of quantum coherency at body temperature. As Penrose proposes, it may require a new type of physical theory.\n\nCan self-awareness, or understanding of a self in the surrounding environment, be done by a classical parallel processor, or are quantum effects needed to have a sense of \"oneness\"? According to Lawrence Krauss, \"You should be wary whenever you hear something like, 'Quantum mechanics connects you with the universe' ... or 'quantum mechanics unifies you with everything else.' You can begin to be skeptical that the speaker is somehow trying to use quantum mechanics to argue fundamentally that you can change the world by thinking about it.\" A subjective feeling is not sufficient to make this determination. Humans don't have a reliable subjective feeling for how we do a lot of functions. According to Daniel Dennett, \"On this topic, \"Everybody's an expert...\" but they think that they have a particular personal authority about the nature of their own conscious experiences that can trump any hypothesis they find unacceptable.\"\n\nSince humans are the only animals known to be conscious, then performing experiments to demonstrate quantum effects in consciousness requires experimentation on a living human brain. This is not automatically excluded or impossible, but it seriously limits the kinds of experiments that can be done. Studies of the ethics of brain studies are being actively solicited by the BRAIN Initiative, a U.S. Federal Government funded effort to document the connections of neurons in the brain.\n\nAn ethically objectionable practice by proponents of quantum mind theories involves the practice of using quantum mechanical terms in an effort to make the argument sound more impressive, even when they know that those terms are irrelevant. Dale DeBakcsy notes that \"trendy parapsychologists, academic relativists, and even the Dalai Lama have all taken their turn at robbing modern physics of a few well-sounding phrases and stretching them far beyond their original scope in order to add scientific weight to various pet theories.\" At the very least, these proponents must make a clear statement about whether quantum formalism is being used as an analogy or as an actual physical mechanism, and what evidence they are using for support. An ethical statement by a researcher should specify what kind of relationship their hypothesis has to the physical laws.\n\nMisleading statements of this type have been given by, for example, Deepak Chopra. Chopra has commonly referred to topics such as quantum healing or quantum effects of consciousness. Seeing the human body as being undergirded by a \"quantum mechanical body\" composed not of matter but of energy and information, he believes that \"human aging is fluid and changeable; it can speed up, slow down, stop for a time, and even reverse itself,\" as determined by one's state of mind. Robert Carroll states Chopra attempts to integrate Ayurveda with quantum mechanics to justify his teachings. Chopra argues that what he calls \"quantum healing\" cures any manner of ailments, including cancer, through effects that he claims are literally based on the same principles as quantum mechanics. This has led physicists to object to his use of the term \"quantum\" in reference to medical conditions and the human body. Chopra said, \"I think quantum theory has a lot of things to say about the observer effect, about non-locality, about correlations. So I think there’s a school of physicists who believe that consciousness has to be equated, or at least brought into the equation, in understanding quantum mechanics.\" On the other hand, he also claims \"[Quantum effects are] just a metaphor. Just like an electron or a photon is an indivisible unit of information and energy, a thought is an indivisible unit of consciousness.\" In his book \"Quantum Healing\", Chopra stated the conclusion that quantum entanglement links everything in the Universe, and therefore it must create consciousness. In either case, the references to the word \"quantum\" don't mean what a physicist would claim, and arguments that use the word \"quantum\" shouldn't be taken as scientifically proven.\n\nChris Carter includes statements in his book, \"Science and Psychic Phenomena,\" of quotes from quantum physicists in support of psychic phenomena. In a review of the book, Benjamin Radford wrote that Carter used such references to \"quantum physics, which he knows nothing about and which he (and people like Deepak Chopra) love to cite and reference because it sounds mysterious and paranormal... Real, actual physicists I've spoken to break out laughing at this crap... If Carter wishes to posit that quantum physics provides a plausible mechanism for psi, then it is his responsibility to show that, and he clearly fails to do so.\" Sharon Hill has studied amateur paranormal research groups, and these groups like to use \"vague and confusing language: ghosts 'use energy,' are made up of 'magnetic fields', or are associated with a 'quantum state.'\"\n\nStatements like these about quantum mechanics indicate a temptation to misinterpret technical, mathematical terms like entanglement in terms of mystical feelings. This approach can be interpreted as a kind of Scientism, using the language and authority of science when the scientific concepts don't apply.\n\nPerhaps the final question is, what difference does it make if quantum effects are involved in computations in the brain? It is already known that quantum mechanics plays a role in the brain, since quantum mechanics determines the shapes and properties of molecules like neurotransmitters and proteins, and these molecules affect how the brain works. This is the reason that drugs such as morphine affect consciousness. As Daniel Dennett said, \"quantum effects are there in your car, your watch, and your computer. But most things — most macroscopic objects — are, as it were, oblivious to quantum effects. They don't amplify them; they don't hinge on them.\" Lawrence Krauss said, \"We're also connected to the universe by gravity, and we're connected to the planets by gravity. But that doesn't mean that astrology is true... Often, people who are trying to sell whatever it is they're trying to sell try to justify it on the basis of science. Everyone knows quantum mechanics is weird, so why not use that to justify it? ... I don't know how many times I've heard people say, 'Oh, I love quantum mechanics because I'm really into meditation, or I love the spiritual benefits that it brings me.' But quantum mechanics, for better or worse, doesn't bring any more spiritual benefits than gravity does.\"\n\n\n\n"}

Related to this work, the best known and widely used model of absorption bands in atmospheric opacity is due to the work of Goody in 1952, and the model was initially known as the Goody random model. It was later discovered that Harris Mayer's work under the supervision of Edward Teller at Los Alamos National Laboratory published in 1947 had made similar calculations and many sources now call the model the Mayer-Goody model or the Mayer-Goody statistical model.\n\nGoody was appointed the Abbott Lawrence Rotch Professor of Dynamic Meteorology and Director of the Blue Hill Observatory at Harvard in 1958 and elected into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences the following year.

{"id": "4287100", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4287100", "title": "Silsila", "text": "Silsila\n\nSilsila () is an Arabic word meaning \"chain\", \"link\", \"connection\" often used in various senses of lineage. In particular, it may be translated as \"(religious) order\" or \"spiritual genealogy\" where one Sufi Master transfers his khilfat to his spiritual descendant.\n\nEvery tariqa has a silsila. Silsilas originated with the initiation of Sufi orders which dates back to the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Most silsilas trace their lineage back to his cousin and son-in-law Ali bin Abi Talib such as the Qadiriyyah, the Chishtiyya, the Noorbakhshia and the Suhrawardiyyah orders. However, other silsilas owe their ancestry to other caliphs such as the Naqshbandiyyah order of South Asia is through the Caliph Abu Bakr.\n\nCenturies ago, Arabia did not have schools for formal education. Students went to masters who taught them. Upon completion of their study, they received ijazah (permission) which acted as the certification of their education. A graduate then acted as a master having his own students or disciples. This chain of masters was known as Silsila or lineage. Somewhat analogous to the modern situation where degrees are only accepted from recognized universities, the certification of a master having a verifiable chain of masters was the only criteria which accorded legitimacy:\n\n\"Theoretically one can only receive instruction in these practices (talqîn) from an authorised teacher of the tariqa, and only after pledging a vow of obedience (bay'ah) to this shaikh. The shaikh gives his disciples permission (ijâza) to practice the tariqa: he may also authorise one or more of them to teach it to others, i.e. appoint them as his khalîfa. In this way a hierarchically ordered network of teachers may emerge. Each shaikh can show a chain of authorities for the tarekat he teaches, his silsila or spiritual genealogy. Usually the silsila reaches back from one's own teacher up to the Prophet, with whom all tarekats claim to have originated although there have been modifications along the way. A Sufi's silsila is his badge of identity and source of legitimation; it provides him with a list of illustrious predecessors and shows how he is related to other Sufis.\"\n\nSilsila can be of a partial knowledge or a book as well. All Hafiz (memorizers of Quran), Muhaddiths (narrators of Hadiths), Qaries (reciters of Quran with correct accent and pronunciation) are given a chain of credible narrators linking to the Islamic prophet Mohammad.\n\nFor Muslims, the Chain of Authenticity is an important way to ascertain the validity of a saying of Mohammad (also known as a Hadith). The Chain of Authenticity relates the chain of people who have heard and repeated the saying of Mohammad through the generations, until that particular Hadith was written down (Ali bin Abi Talib said that 'Aisha said that the Prophet Mohammad said…). A similar idea appears in Sufism in regards to the lineage and teachings of Sufi masters and students. This string of master to student is called a silsila, literally meaning “chain”. The focus of the silsila like the Chain of Authenticity is to trace the lineage of a Sufi order to Mohammad through his Companions: Ali bin Abi Talib (the primary link between Sufi orders and Mohammad), Abu Bakr, and Umar (three of the Four Righteously Guided Caliphs). When a Sufi order can be traced back to Mohammad through one of the three aforementioned Companions the lineage is called the Silsilat al-Dhahab (dhahab meaning gold) or the “Chain of Gold” (Golden Chain). In early Islamic history, gold was an extremely desired prize and was used for currency, to show wealth and power, and for scientific purposes including medicine. Thus, gold was the most desired commodity in the material world, just as the Golden Chain is the most desired commodity of Sufi orders.\n\nWhen Sufism began in the second century of Islam, according to some experts, it was an individual choice; many Sufis aimed to be more like Muhammad by becoming ascetic and focusing their lives fully on God; more so than the Five Daily Prayers and usual prescripted religious practices. This often included removing oneself from society and other people in general. As Sufism became a greater movement in Islam, individual Sufis began to group together. These groups (also known as orders) were based on a common master. This common master then began spiritual lineage, which is a connection between a Sufi order in which there is a common spiritual heritage based on the master’s teachings (i.e., ‘path’ or ‘method’) called tariq or tariqah. As the number of Sufi orders grew, there arose a need for legitimacy of the orders to establish each order was following the teachings of Mohammad directly; thus the idea of the Silsilat al-Dhahab. If a Sufi order is able to trace its student to master lineage back to one of the three major caliphs (and in particular Ali bin Abi Talib) who provide a straight link to Mohammad (because of their Companion status with him) then the order is considered righteous and directly following the teachings of Mohammad. In possessing the Golden Chain, a Sufi order is able to establish their order prominently in the mystical world.\n\nShias use it idiomatically to mean a lineage of authentic Masters.\n\nAmong Chinese Muslims, the concept of \"silsilah\" has developed into that of a \"menhuan\" (门宦): a Chinese-style Sufi order whose leaders trace a lineage chain going back to the order's founder in China (e.g., Ma Laichi or Ma Mingxin), and beyond, toward his teachers in Arabia.\n\nThe term is used as the title of royal family trees and family records of the rulers in the palaces of Java.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6109963", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6109963", "title": "Sophist (dialogue)", "text": "Sophist (dialogue)\n\nThe Sophist (; ) is a Platonic dialogue from the philosopher's late period, most likely written in 360 BC. Its main theme is to identify what a sophist is and how a sophist differs from a philosopher and statesman. Because each seems distinguished by a particular form of knowledge, the dialogue continues some of the lines of inquiry pursued in the epistemological dialogue, \"Theaetetus\", which is said to have taken place the day before. Because the \"Sophist\" treats these matters, it is often taken to shed light on Plato's Theory of Forms and is compared with the \"Parmenides\", which criticized what is often taken to be the theory of forms.\n\nLike its sequel, the \"Statesman\", the dialogue is unusual in that Socrates is present but plays only a minor role. Instead, the Eleatic Stranger takes the lead in the discussion. The fact that Socrates is present but silent makes it difficult to attribute the views put forward by the Eleatic Stranger to Plato, beyond the difficulty inherent in taking any character to be an author's \"mouthpiece.\"\n\nThis dialogue takes place a day after Plato's \"Theaetetus\" in an unspecified gymnasium in Athens. The participants are Socrates, who plays a minor role, the elder mathematician Theodorus, the young mathematician Theaetetus, and a visitor from Elea, the hometown of Parmenides and Zeno, who is often referred to in English translations as the Eleatic Stranger or the Eleatic Visitor. Other young mathematicians are also silently present. The dialogue begins when Socrates arrives and asks the Eleatic Stranger whether in his homeland the sophist, statesperson, and philosopher are considered to be one kind or three. The Eleatic Stranger responds that they are three, and then sets about to give an account of the sophist through dialectical exchange with Theaetetus.\n\nThe Eleatic Stranger pursues a different method of definition than features in Plato's other dialogues by the use of a model, comparison of the model with the target kind, collection, and division (\"diairesis\"), of the collected kinds. At first he starts with the use of a mundane model (a fisherman), which shares some qualities in common with the target kind (the sophist). This common quality is the certain expertise (\"techne\") in one subject. Then through the method of collection of different kinds (farming, caring for mortal bodies, for things that are put together or fabricated and imitation), he tries to bring them together into one kind, which he calls \"productive art\". The same is true with the collection of learning, recognition, commerce, combat and hunting, which can be grouped into the kind of \"acquisitive art\".\n\nAfter these two collections, he proceeds to the division of the types of expertise into \"production\" and \"acquisition\", and then he tries to find out to which of these two sub-kinds the fisherman belongs (classification), in this case, the acquisitive kind of expertise. By following the same method, namely, diairesis through collection, he divides the acquisitive art into \"possession taking\" and \"exchanging goods\", to which sophistry belongs. The sophist is a kind of merchant. After many successive collections and divisions he finally arrives at the definition of the model (fisherman). Throughout this process the Eleatic Stranger classifies many kinds of activities (hunting, aquatic-hunting, fishing, strike-hunting).\n\nAfter the verbal explanation of the model (definition), he tries to find out what the model and the target kind share in common (sameness) and what differentiates them (difference). Through this comparison, and after having been aware of the different kinds and sub-kinds, he can classify sophistry also among the other branches of the ‘tree’ of division of expertise as follows: \"1. production, hunting by persuasion and money-earning, 2.acquisition, soul wholesaling, 3. soul retailing, retailing things that others make, 4. soul retailing, retailing things that he makes himself, 5. possession taking, competition, money-making expertise in debating.\"\n\nThroughout the process of comparison of the distinguished kinds through his method of collection, the Eleatic Stranger discovers some attributes in relation to which the kinds can be divided (difference in relation to something). These are similar to the \"Categories\" of Aristotle, so to say: quantity, quality, relation, location, time, position, end etc.\n\nAfter having failed to define sophistry, the Stranger attempts a final diairesis through the collection of the five definitions of sophistry. Since these five definitions share in common one quality (sameness), which is the \"imitation\", he finally qualifies sophistry as \"imitation art\". Following the division of the imitation art in \"copy-making and appearance-making\", he discovers that sophistry falls under the \"appearance-making art\", namely the Sophist imitates the wise man.\n\nThe sophist is presented negatively, but he can be said to be someone who merely pretends to have knowledge or to be a purveyor of false knowledge only if right opinion and false opinion can be distinguished. It seems impossible to say that the sophist presents things that are not as though they were, or passes off \"non-being\" as \"being,\" since this would suggest that non-being exists, or that non-existence exists. Otherwise, the sophist couldn't \"do\" anything with it. The Stranger suggests that it is Parmenides' doctrine of being and non-being that is at the root of this problem, and so proceeds to criticize Parmenides' ideas, namely that \"it is impossible that things that are not are.\"\n\nThe Eleatic Stranger, before proceeding to the final definition of sophistry, has to make clear the concepts that he used throughout the procedure of definition. In other words, he has to clarify what is the nature of the Being (\"that which is\"), Not-Being, sameness (identity), difference, motion (change), and rest, and how they are interrelated. Therefore, he examines Parmenides’ notion in comparison with Empedocles and Heraclitus’ in order to find out whether Being is identical with \"change\" or \"rest\", or both.\n\nThe conclusion is that rest and change both \"are,\" that is, both are beings; Parmenides had said that only rest \"is.\" Furthermore, \"Being\" is a \"kind\" which all existing things share in common. \"Sameness\" is a \"kind\" that all things which belong to the same kind or genus share with reference to a certain attribute, and due to which diaeresis through collection is possible. \"Difference\" is a \"kind\" that makes things of the same genus distinct from one another; therefore it enables us to proceed to their division. Finally, so-called \"Not-Being\" is not the opposite of Being, but simply different from it. Therefore, the negation of Being is identified with \"difference.\" Not-being is difference, not the opposite of Being.\n\nFollowing these conclusions, the true statement can be distinguished from the false one, since each statement consists of a verb and a name. The name refers to the subject, and because a thought or a speech is always about something, and it cannot be about nothing (\"Non-Being\"). The verb is the sign of the action that the subject performs or the action being performed to or on the subject. When the verb states something that is about the subject, namely one of his properties, then the statement is true. While when the verb states something that is \"different\" (\"it is not\") from the properties of the subject, then the statement is false, but is not attributing being to non-being.\n\nIt is plausible then, that ‘\"things that are not (appearing and seeming) somehow are\"’, and so it is also plausible that the sophist produces false appearances and imitates the wise man.\n\nAfter having solved all these puzzles, that is to say the interrelation between being, not-being, difference and negation, as well as the possibility of the \"appearing and seeming but not really being,\" the Eleatic Stranger can finally proceed to define sophistry. \"Sophistry is a productive art, human, of the imitation kind, copy-making, of the appearance-making kind, uninformed and insincere in the form of contrary-speech-producing art.\"\n\nSince Plato wrote the \"Statesman\" after the \"Sophist\", while he never wrote the dialogue \"Philosopher\", many scholars argue that Plato challenges the audience to search for the definition of the philosopher themselves, by applying the method of inquiry and definition shown in those two dialogues. However, this does not mean that one can simply extend the method in a mechanical way to the investigation of the philosopher, but he only shows us how one can proceed in such philosophical enquiries.\n\nAristotle picks up a number of themes dealt with in the \"Sophist\" in his own work \"De Interpretatione\". Among these are the required parts of a statement (names and verbs) as well as affirmations and denials.\n\n\n"}

He also lived in Poland and Italy.\n\nLasusãns was the teacher of the Brazilian philosopher and journalist Olavo de Carvalho.\n\nLadusãns earned his PhD from the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome. In 1970, he founded the Brazilian Society of Catholic Philosophers and later the Center for Philosophical Research in São Paulo. From 1953 onwards, Ladusãns took over the direction of the Library of the Center for Higher Studies of the Society of Jesus, specializing in Philosophy and Theology.\n\nAlready with a post-doctorate degree, Ladusãns was not able to return to Latvia because of the Soviet occupation. He hid his identity from the security organs, since, at the time, Latvians were forcibly repatriated to the Soviet Union. His ideas emerge from the thirteenth century and synthesize Thomism from the standpoint of modern philosophy and phenomenology. He was also a scholar of the Prussian philosopher Immanuel Kant, to whom he devoted his doctoral thesis.\n\nHe was one of the first to divulge the concrete philosophy of Mário Ferreira dos Santos. During a scientific research on the situation of Brazilian philosophical thought, he came into contact with Mário's philosophy with whom he began to have frequent personal contacts. \n\nStanislavs Ladusãns also organized four congresses of philosophy. He was a member of the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas and President of the Inter-American Catholic Association of Philosophy.\n\nHe was professor of the philosopher, journalist, writer and essayist Olavo de Carvalho in the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro. Father Paulo Ricardo, Olavo's pupil, has been a modern influence among the Catholic clergy.\n\n"}
