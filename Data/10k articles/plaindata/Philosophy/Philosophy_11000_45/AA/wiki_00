This process, unlike deductive reasoning, yields a plausible conclusion but does not positively verify it. Abductive conclusions are thus qualified as having a remnant of uncertainty or doubt, which is expressed in retreat terms such as \"best available\" or \"most likely\". One can understand abductive reasoning as inference to the best explanation, although not all uses of the terms \"abduction\" and \"inference to the best explanation\" are exactly equivalent.\n\nIn the 1990s, as computing power grew, the fields of law, computer science, and artificial intelligence research spurred renewed interest in the subject of abduction.\nDiagnostic expert systems frequently employ abduction.\nThe American philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce (; 1839–1914) introduced abduction into modern logic. Over the years he called such inference \"hypothesis\", \"abduction\", \"presumption\", and \"retroduction\". He considered it a topic in logic as a normative field in philosophy, not in purely formal or mathematical logic, and eventually as a topic also in economics of research.\n\nAs two stages of the development, extension, etc., of a hypothesis in scientific inquiry, abduction and also induction are often collapsed into one overarching concept — the hypothesis. That is why, in the scientific method known from Galileo and Bacon, the abductive stage of hypothesis formation is conceptualized simply as induction. Thus, in the twentieth century this collapse was reinforced by Karl Popper's explication of the hypothetico-deductive model, where the hypothesis is considered to be just \"a guess\" (in the spirit of Peirce). However, when the formation of a hypothesis is considered the result of a process it becomes clear that this \"guess\" has already been tried and made more robust in thought as a necessary stage of its acquiring the status of hypothesis. Indeed, many abductions are rejected or heavily modified by subsequent abductions before they ever reach this stage.\n\nBefore 1900, Peirce treated abduction as the use of a known rule to explain an observation, e.g., it is a known rule that if it rains the grass is wet; so, to explain the fact that the grass is wet; one \"abduces\" that it has rained. Abduction can lead to false conclusions if other rules explaining the observation are not taken into account (e.g. if the sprinklers were recently on the grass is wet). This remains the common use of the term \"abduction\" in the social sciences and in artificial intelligence.\n\nPeirce consistently characterized it as the kind of inference that originates a hypothesis by concluding in an explanation, though an unassured one, for some very curious or surprising (anomalous) observation stated in a premise. As early as 1865 he wrote that all conceptions of cause and force are reached through hypothetical inference; in the 1900s he wrote that all explanatory content of theories is reached through abduction. In other respects Peirce revised his view of abduction over the years.\n\nIn later years his view came to be:\n\nWriting in 1910, Peirce admits that \"in almost everything I printed before the beginning of this century I more or less mixed up hypothesis and induction\" and he traces the confusion of these two types of reasoning to logicians' too \"narrow and formalistic a conception of inference, as necessarily having formulated judgments from its premises.\"\n\nHe started out in the 1860s treating hypothetical inference in a number of ways which he eventually peeled away as inessential or, in some cases, mistaken:\n\nIn 1867, Peirce's \"The Natural Classification of Arguments\", hypothetical inference always deals with a cluster of characters (call them \"P′, P′′, P′′′,\" etc.) known to occur at least whenever a certain character (\"M\") occurs. Note that categorical syllogisms have elements traditionally called middles, predicates, and subjects. For example: All \"men\" [middle] are \"mortal\" [predicate]; \"Socrates\" [subject] is a \"man\" [middle]; ergo \"Socrates\" [subject] is \"mortal\" [predicate]\". Below, 'M' stands for a middle; 'P' for a predicate; 'S' for a subject. Note also that Peirce held that all deduction can be put into the form of the categorical syllogism Barbara (AAA-1).\n\nIn 1878, in \"Deduction, Induction, and Hypothesis\", there is no longer a need for multiple characters or predicates in order for an inference to be hypothetical, although it is still helpful. Moreover, Peirce no longer poses hypothetical inference as concluding in a \"probable\" hypothesis. In the forms themselves, it is understood but not explicit that induction involves random selection and that hypothetical inference involves response to a \"very curious circumstance\". The forms instead emphasize the modes of inference as rearrangements of one another's propositions (without the bracketed hints shown below).\n\nPeirce long treated abduction in terms of induction from characters or traits (weighed, not counted like objects), explicitly so in his influential 1883 \"A Theory of Probable Inference\", in which he returns to involving probability in the hypothetical conclusion. Like \"Deduction, Induction, and Hypothesis\" in 1878, it was widely read (see the historical books on statistics by Stephen Stigler), unlike his later amendments of his conception of abduction. Today abduction remains most commonly understood as induction from characters and extension of a known rule to cover unexplained circumstances.\n\nSherlock Holmes uses this method of reasoning in the stories of Arthur Conan Doyle, although Holmes refers to it as deductive reasoning.\n\nIn 1902 Peirce wrote that he now regarded the syllogistical forms and the doctrine of extension and comprehension (i.e., objects and characters as referenced by terms), as being less fundamental than he had earlier thought. In 1903 he offered the following form for abduction: \n\nThe hypothesis is framed, but not asserted, in a premise, then asserted as rationally suspectable in the conclusion. Thus, as in the earlier categorical syllogistic form, the conclusion is formulated from some premise(s). But all the same the hypothesis consists more clearly than ever in a new or outside idea beyond what is known or observed. Induction in a sense goes beyond observations already reported in the premises, but it merely amplifies ideas already known to represent occurrences, or tests an idea supplied by hypothesis; either way it requires previous abductions in order to get such ideas in the first place. Induction seeks facts to test a hypothesis; abduction seeks a hypothesis to account for facts.\n\nNote that the hypothesis (\"A\") could be of a rule. It need not even be a rule strictly necessitating the surprising observation (\"C\"), which needs to follow only as a \"matter of course\"; or the \"course\" itself could amount to some known rule, merely alluded to, and also not necessarily a rule of strict necessity. In the same year, Peirce wrote that reaching a hypothesis may involve placing a surprising observation under either a newly hypothesized rule or a hypothesized combination of a known rule with a peculiar state of facts, so that the phenomenon would be not surprising but instead either necessarily implied or at least likely.\n\nPeirce did not remain quite convinced about any such form as the categorical syllogistic form or the 1903 form. In 1911, he wrote, \"I do not, at present, feel quite convinced that any logical form can be assigned that will cover all 'Retroductions'. For what I mean by a Retroduction is simply a conjecture which arises in the mind.\"\n\nIn 1901 Peirce wrote, \"There would be no logic in imposing rules, and saying that they ought to be followed, until it is made out that the purpose of hypothesis requires them.\" In 1903 Peirce called pragmatism \"the logic of abduction\" and said that the pragmatic maxim gives the necessary and sufficient logical rule to abduction in general. The pragmatic maxim is:\n\nConsider what effects, that might conceivably have practical bearings, we conceive the object of our conception to have. Then, our conception of these effects is the whole of our conception of the object.\n\nIt is a method for fruitful clarification of conceptions by equating the meaning of a conception with the conceivable practical implications of its object's conceived effects. Peirce held that that is precisely tailored to abduction's purpose in inquiry, the forming of an idea that could conceivably shape informed conduct. In various writings in the 1900s he said that the conduct of abduction (or retroduction) is governed by considerations of economy, belonging in particular to the economics of research. He regarded economics as a normative science whose analytic portion might be part of logical methodeutic (that is, theory of inquiry).\n\nPeirce came over the years to divide (philosophical) logic into three departments: \nPeirce had, from the start, seen the modes of inference as being coordinated together in scientific inquiry and, by the 1900s, held that hypothetical inference in particular is inadequately treated at the level of critique of arguments. To increase the assurance of a hypothetical conclusion, one needs to deduce implications about evidence to be found, predictions which induction can test through observation so as to evaluate the hypothesis. That is Peirce's outline of the scientific method of inquiry, as covered in his inquiry methodology, which includes pragmatism or, as he later called it, pragmaticism, the clarification of ideas in terms of their conceivable implications regarding informed practice.\n\nAs early as 1866, Peirce held that:\n\n1. Hypothesis (abductive inference) is inference through an \"icon\" (also called a \"likeness\"). <br>\n2. Induction is inference through an \"index\" (a sign by factual connection); a sample is an index of the totality from which it is drawn. <br>\n3. Deduction is inference through a \"symbol\" (a sign by interpretive habit irrespective of resemblance or connection to its object).\n\nIn 1902, Peirce wrote that, in abduction: \"It is recognized that the phenomena are \"like\", i.e. constitute an Icon of, a replica of a general conception, or Symbol.\"\n\nAt the critical level Peirce examined the forms of abductive arguments (as discussed above), and came to hold that the hypothesis should economize explanation for plausibility in terms of the feasible and natural. In 1908 Peirce described this plausibility in some detail. It involves not likeliness based on observations (which is instead the inductive evaluation of a hypothesis), but instead optimal simplicity in the sense of the \"facile and natural\", as by Galileo's natural light of reason and as distinct from \"logical simplicity\" (Peirce does not dismiss logical simplicity entirely but sees it in a subordinate role; taken to its logical extreme it would favor adding no explanation to the observation at all). Even a well-prepared mind guesses oftener wrong than right, but our guesses succeed better than random luck at reaching the truth or at least advancing the inquiry, and that indicates to Peirce that they are based in instinctive attunement to nature, an affinity between the mind's processes and the processes of the real, which would account for why appealingly \"natural\" guesses are the ones that oftenest (or least seldom) succeed; to which Peirce added the argument that such guesses are to be preferred since, without \"a natural bent like nature's\", people would have no hope of understanding nature. In 1910 Peirce made a three-way distinction between probability, verisimilitude, and plausibility, and defined plausibility with a normative \"ought\": \"By plausibility, I mean the degree to which a theory ought to recommend itself to our belief independently of any kind of evidence other than our instinct urging us to regard it favorably.\" For Peirce, plausibility does not depend on observed frequencies or probabilities, or on verisimilitude, or even on testability, which is not a question of the critique of the hypothetical inference \"as\" an inference, but rather a question of the hypothesis's relation to the inquiry process.\n\nThe phrase \"inference to the best explanation\" (not used by Peirce but often applied to hypothetical inference) is not always understood as referring to the most simple and natural hypotheses (such as those with the fewest assumptions). However, in other senses of \"best\", such as \"standing up best to tests\", it is hard to know which is the best explanation to form, since one has not tested it yet. Still, for Peirce, any justification of an abductive inference as good is not completed upon its formation as an argument (unlike with induction and deduction) and instead depends also on its methodological role and promise (such as its testability) in advancing inquiry.\n\nAt the methodeutical level Peirce held that a hypothesis is judged and selected for testing because it offers, via its trial, to expedite and economize the inquiry process itself toward new truths, first of all by being testable and also by further economies, in terms of cost, value, and relationships among guesses (hypotheses). Here, considerations such as probability, absent from the treatment of abduction at the critical level, come into play. For examples:\n\nNorwood Russell Hanson, a philosopher of science, wanted to grasp a logic explaining how scientific discoveries take place. He used Peirce's notion of abduction for this.\n\nFurther development of the concept can be found in Peter Lipton's \"Inference to the Best Explanation\" (Lipton, 1991).\n\nDeductive reasoning allows deriving formula_1 from formula_2 only where formula_1 is formal logical consequence of formula_2. In other words, deduction derives the consequences of the assumed. Given the truth of the assumptions, a valid deduction guarantees the truth of the conclusion. For example, given that \"Wikis can be edited by anyone\" (formula_5) and \"Wikipedia is a wiki\" (formula_6), it follows that \"Wikipedia can be edited by anyone\" (formula_1).\n\nInductive reasoning allows inferring formula_1 from formula_2, where formula_1 does not follow necessarily from formula_2. formula_2 might give us very good reason to accept formula_1, but it does not ensure formula_1. For example, if all swans that we have observed so far are white, we may induce that the possibility that all swans are white is reasonable. We have good reason to believe the conclusion from the premise, but the truth of the conclusion is not guaranteed. (Indeed, it turns out that some swans are black.)\n\nAbductive reasoning allows inferring formula_2 as an explanation of formula_1. As a result of this inference, abduction allows the precondition formula_2 to be abduced from the consequence formula_1. Deductive reasoning and abductive reasoning thus differ in the direction in which a rule like \"formula_2 entails formula_1\" is used for inference.\n\nAs such, abduction is formally equivalent to the logical fallacy of affirming the consequent (or \"Post hoc ergo propter hoc\") because of multiple possible explanations for formula_1. For example, in a billiard game, after glancing and seeing the \"eight\" ball moving towards us, we may abduce that the cue ball struck the eight ball. The strike of the cue ball would account for the movement of the eight ball. It serves as a hypothesis that explains our observation. Given the many possible explanations for the movement of the eight ball, our abduction does not leave us certain that the cue ball in fact struck the eight ball, but our abduction, still useful, can serve to orient us in our surroundings. Despite many possible explanations for any physical process that we observe, we tend to abduce a single explanation (or a few explanations) for this process in the expectation that we can better orient ourselves in our surroundings and disregard some possibilities. Properly used, abductive reasoning can be a useful source of priors in Bayesian statistics.\n\nIn logic, explanation is done from a logical theory formula_22 representing a domain and a set of observations formula_23. Abduction is the process of deriving a set of explanations of formula_23 according to formula_22 and picking out one of those explanations. For formula_26 to be an explanation of formula_23 according to formula_22, it should satisfy two conditions:\n\n\nIn formal logic, formula_23 and formula_26 are assumed to be sets of literals. The two conditions for formula_26 being an explanation of formula_23 according to theory formula_22 are formalized as:\n\nAmong the possible explanations formula_26 satisfying these two conditions, some other condition of minimality is usually imposed to avoid irrelevant facts (not contributing to the entailment of formula_23) being included in the explanations. Abduction is then the process that picks out some member of formula_26. Criteria for picking out a member representing \"the best\" explanation include the simplicity, the prior probability, or the explanatory power of the explanation.\n\nA proof theoretical abduction method for first order classical logic based on the sequent calculus and a dual one, based on semantic tableaux (analytic tableaux) have been proposed (Cialdea Mayer & Pirri 1993). The methods are sound and complete and work for full first order logic, without requiring any preliminary reduction of formulae into normal forms. These methods have also been extended to modal logic.\n\nAbductive logic programming is a computational framework that extends normal logic programming with abduction. It separates the theory formula_22 into two components, one of which is a normal logic program, used to generate formula_26 by means of backward reasoning, the other of which is a set of integrity constraints, used to filter the set of candidate explanations.\n\nA different formalization of abduction is based on inverting the function that calculates the visible effects of the hypotheses. Formally, we are given a set of hypotheses formula_46 and a set of manifestations formula_47; they are related by the domain knowledge, represented by a function formula_48 that takes as an argument a set of hypotheses and gives as a result the corresponding set of manifestations. In other words, for every subset of the hypotheses formula_49, their effects are known to be formula_50.\n\nAbduction is performed by finding a set formula_49 such that formula_52. In other words, abduction is performed by finding a set of hypotheses formula_53 such that their effects formula_50 include all observations formula_47.\n\nA common assumption is that the effects of the hypotheses are independent, that is, for every formula_49, it holds that formula_57. If this condition is met, abduction can be seen as a form of set covering.\n\nAbductive validation is the process of validating a given hypothesis through abductive reasoning. This can also be called reasoning through successive approximation. Under this principle, an explanation is valid if it is the best possible explanation of a set of known data. The best possible explanation is often defined in terms of simplicity and elegance (see Occam's razor). Abductive validation is common practice in hypothesis formation in science; moreover, Peirce claims that it is a ubiquitous aspect of thought:\nLooking out my window this lovely spring morning, I see an azalea in full bloom. No, no! I don't see that; though that is the only way I can describe what I see. That is a proposition, a sentence, a fact; but what I perceive is not proposition, sentence, fact, but only an image, which I make intelligible in part by means of a statement of fact. This statement is abstract; but what I see is concrete. I perform an abduction when I so much as express in a sentence anything I see. The truth is that the whole fabric of our knowledge is one matted felt of pure hypothesis confirmed and refined by induction. Not the smallest advance can be made in knowledge beyond the stage of vacant staring, without making an abduction at every step.\nIt was Peirce's own maxim that \"Facts cannot be explained by a hypothesis more extraordinary than these facts themselves; and of various hypotheses the least extraordinary must be adopted.\" After obtaining results from an inference procedure, we may be left with multiple assumptions, some of which may be contradictory. Abductive validation is a method for identifying the assumptions that will lead to your goal.\n\nProbabilistic abductive reasoning is a form of abductive validation, and is used extensively in areas where the probability distribution over possible hypotheses needs to be derived, such as for making diagnoses from medical tests.\n\nFor example, a pharmaceutical company that develops a test for a particular infectious disease will typically determine the reliability of the test by hiring a group of infected and a group of non-infected people to undergo the test. Assume the statements formula_58: \"Positive test\", formula_59: \"Negative test\", formula_60: \"Infected\", and formula_61: \"Not infected\". The result of these trials will then determine the reliability of the test in terms of its true positive rate (sensitivity) formula_62 and false positive rate formula_63. The interpretations of the conditionals are: formula_62: \"The probability of positive test given infection\", and formula_63: \"The probability of positive test in the absence of infection\". The problem with applying these conditionals in a practical setting is that they are expressed in the opposite direction to what the practitioner needs. The conditionals needed for making the diagnosis are: formula_66: \"The probability of infection given positive test\", and formula_67: \"The probability of infection given negative test\". The marginal probability of infection could then have been conditionally deduced as formula_68, where formula_69 is the degree (probability) of positive test which typically can be set to formula_70 if the test is objectively positive, or to formula_71 if the test is objectively negative. Note that formula_72. Unfortunately the required conditionals are usually not directly available to the medical practitioner, but they can be obtained by applying Bayes' theorem if the base rate (aka. prior probability) formula_73 of the infection in the population is known. Two instances of Bayes' theorem are needed to obtain the required conditionals formula_66 and formula_67. These two instances of Bayes' theorem are\n\nThe full expression for the conditionally abduced marginal probability formula_77 of infection in a tested person, given the outcome (probability) of the test formula_69, the base rate of the infection formula_73, as well as the test's true and false positive rates formula_62 and formula_63, is then given by\n\nThis further simplifies to the expression for the marginal probability formula_77 deduced with the law of total probability as\n\nProbabilistic abduction can thus be described as a method for probabilistic deduction that uses Bayes' theorem.\n\nA medical test result is typically considered positive or negative, so\nwhen applying the above equation it can be assumed that\neither formula_70 (positive) or formula_86 (negative). In case the patient tests positive, the above equation can be simplified to formula_87 which in that case gives the correct likelihood that the patient actually is infected.\n\nThe base rate fallacy in medicine, or the prosecutor's fallacy in legal reasoning, consists of making the erroneous assumption that formula_88. While this reasoning error often can produce a relatively good approximation of the correct hypothesis probability value, it can lead to a completely wrong result and wrong conclusion in case the base rate is very low and the reliability of the test is not perfect. An extreme example of the base rate fallacy is to conclude that a male person is pregnant just because he tests positive in a pregnancy test. Obviously, the base rate of male pregnancy is zero, and assuming that the test is not perfect, it would be correct to conclude that the male person is not pregnant or the person is not biologically male.\n\nThe expression for probabilistic abduction can be generalised to multinomial cases, i.e., with a state space formula_89 of multiple formula_90 and a state space formula_91 of multiple states formula_92.\n\nSubjective logic generalises probabilistic logic by including degrees of uncertainty in the input arguments, i.e. in addition to assigning probabilities, the analyst can assign subjective opinions to the argument variables. Abduction in subjective logic is thus a generalization of probabilistic abduction described above. The input arguments in subjective logic are subjective opinions which can be binomial when the opinion applies to a binary variable or multinomial when it applies to an \"n\"-ary variable. A subjective opinion thus applies to a variable formula_89 which takes its values from a domain formula_94 (i.e. a state space of exhaustive and mutually disjoint values formula_58), and is denoted by the tuple formula_96, where formula_97 is a belief mass distribution over formula_98, formula_99 is the uncertainty mass, and formula_100 is a base rate distribution over formula_101. These parameters satisfy formula_102 and formula_103 as well as formula_104.\n\nAssume the domains formula_94 and formula_106 with respective variables formula_89 and formula_91, the set of conditional opinions formula_109 (i.e. one conditional opinion for each value formula_60), and the base rate distribution formula_111. Based on these parameters, the subjective Bayes' theorem denoted with the operator formula_112 produces the set of inverted conditionals formula_113 (i.e. one inverted conditional for each value formula_58) expressed by:\n\nThe advantage of using subjective logic abduction compared to probabilistic abduction is that uncertainty about the input argument probabilities can be explicitly expressed and taken into account during the analysis. It is thus possible to perform abductive analysis in the presence of uncertain arguments, which naturally results in degrees of uncertainty in the output conclusions.\n\nApplications in artificial intelligence include fault diagnosis, belief revision, and automated planning. The most direct application of abduction is that of automatically detecting faults in systems: given a theory relating faults with their effects and a set of observed effects, abduction can be used to derive sets of faults that are likely to be the cause of the problem.\n\nIn medicine, abduction can be seen as a component of clinical evaluation and judgment.\n\nAbduction can also be used to model automated planning. Given a logical theory relating action occurrences with their effects (for example, a formula of the event calculus), the problem of finding a plan for reaching a state can be modeled as the problem of abducting a set of literals implying that the final state is the goal state.\n\nIn intelligence analysis, analysis of competing hypotheses and Bayesian networks, probabilistic abductive reasoning is used extensively. Similarly in medical diagnosis and legal reasoning, the same methods are being used, although there have been many examples of errors, especially caused by the base rate fallacy and the prosecutor's fallacy.\n\nBelief revision, the process of adapting beliefs in view of new information, is another field in which abduction has been applied. The main problem of belief revision is that the new information may be inconsistent with the corpus of beliefs, while the result of the incorporation cannot be inconsistent. This process can be done by the use of abduction: once an explanation for the observation has been found, integrating it does not generate inconsistency. This use of abduction is not straightforward, as adding propositional formulae to other propositional formulae can only make inconsistencies worse. Instead, abduction is done at the level of the ordering of preference of the possible worlds. Preference models use fuzzy logic or utility models.\n\nIn the philosophy of science, abduction has been the key inference method to support scientific realism, and much of the debate about scientific realism is focused on whether abduction is an acceptable method of inference.\n\nIn historical linguistics, abduction during language acquisition is often taken to be an essential part of processes of language change such as reanalysis and analogy.\n\nIn anthropology, Alfred Gell in his influential book \"Art and Agency\" defined abduction (after Eco) as \"a case of synthetic inference 'where we find some very curious circumstances, which would be explained by the supposition that it was a case of some general rule, and thereupon adopt that supposition. Gell criticizes existing \"anthropological\" studies of art for being too preoccupied with aesthetic value and not preoccupied enough with the central anthropological concern of uncovering \"social relationships\", specifically the social contexts in which artworks are produced, circulated, and received. Abduction is used as the mechanism for getting from art to agency. That is, abduction can explain how works of art inspire a \"sensus communis:\" the commonly held views shared by members that characterize a given society. The question Gell asks in the book is, \"how does it initially 'speak' to people?\" He answers by saying that \"No reasonable person could suppose that art-like relations between people and things do not involve at least some form of semiosis.\" However, he rejects any intimation that semiosis can be thought of as a language because then he would have to admit to some pre-established existence of the \"sensus communis\" that he wants to claim only emerges afterwards out of art. Abduction is the answer to this conundrum because the tentative nature of the abduction concept (Peirce likened it to guessing) means that not only can it operate outside of any pre-existing framework, but moreover, it can actually intimate the existence of a framework. As Gell reasons in his analysis, the physical existence of the artwork prompts the viewer to perform an abduction that imbues the artwork with intentionality. A statue of a goddess, for example, in some senses actually becomes the goddess in the mind of the beholder; and represents not only the form of the deity but also her intentions (which are adduced from the feeling of her very presence). Therefore, through abduction, Gell claims that art can have the kind of agency that plants the seeds that grow into cultural myths. The power of agency is the power to motivate actions and inspire ultimately the shared understanding that characterizes any given society.\n\n"}

Writer and intellectual Frank B. Wilderson III developed the term in his political memoir about his time spent teaching and participating in the African National Congress in South Africa during apartheid. \n\nAccording to Tansi, \"Afro-pessimism [is] a terrible word used to conceal the greatest mess of all time,\" which is the \"tragedy\" that Africa's position \"dooms us to construct and build garbage economies in the depths of the most cruel, unbearable, and inhuman form of indignity that humans can swallow\" (as translated by John Conteh-Morgan). According to Wilderson, afro-pessimism theorizes blackness as a position of \"accumulation and fungibility\" (Saidiya Hartman); that is, as condition—or relation—of ontological death, as opposed to a cultural identity or human subjectivity.\n\nWilderson, along with Hortense Spillers, Saidiya Hartman, Achille Mbembe, Jared Sexton, and others who have contributed to afro-pessimist thought, cite the Martinician psychiatrist, philosopher, and writer Frantz Fanon as a foundational figure in the tradition of Afro-pessimism. \n\nAfro-pessimism has been constructed in many ways and with different aims. But Afro-pessimism is chiefly approached a transcendent position, not as a negative or disaffected political attitude in the sense that pessimism might seemingly connote. The Black radical tradition has drawn upon the term as a way to acknowledge the power, depth, and vitality of the resilience and radical imagination of people of African descent. Within this same critique, some have used Afro-pessimism to articulate the subject-position of renunciation, refusal, distancing, dread, doubt and abjection in response to the multitude and ongoing effects and historical traumas of colonialism. This includes the view that dismantling white supremacy would mean dismantling much of the social and political institutions of the modern world.\n\nDiscussions of Afro-pessimism have manifest in an online context, and have continued in Afro-pessimist approaches to art, poetics, and computing.\n\nAfro-pessimist ideas have been part of ongoing conversations about pan-African identity, as an inclusionary concept of blackness among all people of African descent. Pan-African thought has drawn attention to the shared racial identity and also the particulars of the expression of African identity among the African Diaspora and peoples on the African continent. Pan-African thought has analyzed the ongoing struggles of African peoples, and the power of Afrocentricity as a move away from the colonialism and violence of Eurocentricity. The writings of Frantz Fanon, a Martinican psychiatrist, intellectual, and revolutionary, reflect pan-African and Afro-pessimistic approaches to decolonization and black liberation. \n\nThe Pan-African movement négritude represents pessimism as a kind of realist recognition of the historical traumas of colonialism, from an existentialist position. A key figure in the movement, Aimé Césaire, uses pessimism to consider transcendence and a recognition of the breadth of the cultural imagination and perseverance of people of African descent.\n\nAfro-pessimism has also been employed as a term describing a narrative in Western media and International relations theory that portrays post-colonial Africa as unlikely to achieve economic growth and democratic governance. This use of Afro-pessimism has nothing to with Wilderson's definition. This form of Afro-pessimism has been criticized as a Western construct regarding the ongoing portrayal of Africa and African people in Western media, overwhelmingly in terms of tragedy, doom, victimization, and victim-hood. Scholar Toussaint Nothias has characterized these discussions by the components, \"essentialism, racialization, selectivity, ranking framework, and prediction.\" From this Afro-pessimistic perspective, news media that portray Africa and African people by the trope of victimhood, mirror the Eurocentric and ethnocentric of the Western media, language, images, and rhetoric. In this ways the media tends to victimize and exoticize Africa for its going struggles with poverty, health-crisis, famine, and lack of modern development. The victimization is then visible in the humanitarian and development projects, which sometimes use the language of \"saving\" African people from such \"humanitarian disasters\".\n\n\n"}

Ali ibn Sahl was fluent in Syriac and Greek, the two sources for the medical tradition of antiquity, and versed in fine calligraphy.\n\n\n\"Firdous al-Hikmah\" is one of the oldest encyclopedias of Islamic medicine, based on Syriac translations of Greek and Indian sources (Hippocrates, Galen Dioscorides, and others).It is divided into 7 sections and 30 parts, with 360 chapters in total.\n\nOn the Quran he said:\n\"When I was a Christian I used to say, as did an uncle of mine who was one of the learned and eloquent men, that eloquence is not one of the signs of prophethood because it is common to all the peoples; but when I discarded (blind) imitation and (old) customs and gave up adhering to (mere) habit and training and reflected upon the meanings of the Qur'an I came to know that what the followers of the Qur'an claimed for it was true. The fact is that I have not found any book, be it by an Arab or a Persian, an Indian or a Greek, right from the beginning of the world up to now, which contains at the same time praises of God, belief in the prophets and apostles, exhortations to good, everlasting deeds, command to do good and prohibition against doing evil, inspiration to the desire of paradise and to avoidance of hell-fire as this Qur'an does. So when a person brings to us a book of such qualities, which inspires such reverence and sweetness in the hearts and which has achieved such an overlasting success and he is (at the same time) an illiterate person who did never learnt the art of writing or rhetoric, that book is without any doubt one of the signs of his Prophethood.\"\n\n\n\n"}

He joined the Rutgers faculty in 1994. He has done influential work on a wide range of philosophical topics, but his principal areas of research are epistemology, philosophy of mind, and cognitive science.\n\nHe is married to the ethicist Holly Martin Smith.\n\nGoldman's early book, \"A Theory of Human Action\" (a revised version of his Ph.D. thesis), presents a systematic way of classifying and relating the many actions we perform at any time. Its influence was broad and can be found in, among other writings, John Rawls' book \"A Theory of Justice\". Goldman's early work in action theory soon gave way to work in other branches of philosophy, most influentially epistemology.\n\nGoldman's accounts of knowledge and justified belief, using notions like causation and reliability instead of normative concepts like permissibility and obligation, contributed to a philosophical approach that came to be known in the 1970s as naturalized epistemology. (Unlike W.V.O. Quine's version of naturalized epistemology, however, Goldman's retains a traditional focus on questions of justification.) Goldman's view emerged initially as part of the efforts in the 1960s to find a \"fourth\" condition in response to the Gettier challenge to the account of knowledge as \"justified true belief.\" In his 1967 paper, \"A Causal Theory of Knowing\", Goldman proposed that knowledge amounts to true belief appropriately caused by the fact that makes it true. Later, he claimed knowledge amounts to true belief that is produced by a reliable process.\n\nGoldman has described his \"naturalistic\" approach to epistemology as splitting \"epistemology (individual epistemology, anyway) into two parts... The first part is dedicated to the 'analytic' task of identifying the criteria, or satisfaction conditions, for various normative epistemic statuses. With respect to the normative status of justifiedness (of belief), the proposed criterion is the reliability of the belief-forming processes by which the belief is produced. Defense of this criterion of justifiedness was not based on scientific psychology, but rather a familiar form of armchair methodology. The second part is the task where science enters the picture. Psychological science is required to identify the kinds of operations or computations available to the human cognizer, how well they work when operating on certain inputs and under certain conditions.\"\n\nMore recently, Goldman has focused his epistemological efforts on questions of social epistemology, of the different social mechanisms through which knowledge is transmitted in society. His work in social epistemology has dealt with the law (especially evidence), voting and media, among other topics. He attempts to provide (in his words) a less radical view of social epistemology than those suggested by cultural theorists and postmodernists under that name. His approach uses tools of analytic philosophy especially formal epistemology to analyze problems in social knowledge. Some of this work is summarized in his book \"Knowledge in a Social World\".\n\nGoldman has devoted significant time to showing how research in cognitive science is relevant to a variety of branches of philosophy including epistemology. Much of this work appears in his books \"Epistemology and Cognition\", \"Philosophical Applications of Cognitive Science\", and \"Simulating Minds\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "964034", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=964034", "title": "Argument from poor design", "text": "Argument from poor design\n\nThe argument from poor design, also known as the dysteleological argument, is an argument against the existence of a creator God, based on the reasoning that an omnipotent and omnibenevolent God would not create organisms with the perceived suboptimal designs that can be seen in nature.\n\nThe argument is structured as a basic modus tollens: if \"creation\" contains many defects, then design is not a plausible theory for the origin of our existence. It is most commonly used in a weaker way, however: not with the aim of disproving the existence of God, but rather as a reductio ad absurdum of the well-known argument from design, which argues that living things are too well-designed to have originated by chance, so must have been deliberately created by an intelligent God.\n\nAlthough the phrase \"argument from poor design\" has seen little use, this type of argument has been advanced many times using words and phrases such as \"poor design\", \"suboptimal design\", \"unintelligent design\" or \"dysteology/dysteological\". The last of these is a term applied by the nineteenth-century biologist Ernst Haeckel to the implications of organs so rudimentary as to be useless to the life of an organism. Haeckel, in his book \"The History of Creation\", devoted most of a chapter to the argument, ending with the proposition (perhaps with tongue slightly in cheek) of \"a theory of the \"unsuitability of parts\" in organisms, as a counter-hypothesis to the old popular doctrine of the \"suitability of parts\"\". The term \"incompetent design\", a play on \"intelligent design\", has been coined by Donald Wise of the University of Massachusetts Amherst to describe aspects of nature that are currently flawed in design.\n\nTraditional theological responses generally posit that God's creation was perfect but that humanity's misuse of its free will to rebel against God has resulted in the corruption of good design.\n\nThe argument runs that:\n\n\nIt is sometimes used as a reductio ad absurdum of the well-known argument from design, which runs as follows:\n\n\n\"Poor design\" is consistent with the predictions of the scientific theory of evolution by means of natural selection. This predicts that features that were evolved for certain uses, are then reused or co-opted for different uses, or abandoned altogether; and that suboptimal state is due to the inability of the hereditary mechanism to eliminate the particular vestiges of the evolutionary process.\n\nIn fitness landscape terms, natural selection will always push \"up the hill\", but a species cannot normally get from a lower peak to a higher peak without first going through a valley.\n\nThe argument from poor design is one of the arguments that was used by Charles Darwin; modern proponents have included Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Dawkins. They argue that such features can be explained as a consequence of the gradual, cumulative nature of the evolutionary process. Theistic evolutionists generally reject the argument from design, but do still maintain belief in the existence of God.\n\nSeveral defects in human anatomy can result in death, especially without modern medical care:\n\n\n\nSeveral generic philosophical criticisms can be directed towards the first premise of the argument – that a Creator deity would have designed things 'optimally'. The argument hinges on an assumption that the human concept of 'optimal design' is the same as that of a theistic god. This is, in effect, the argument for the incomprehensibility of the Abrahamic God Yahweh in the Book of Job:\n\nThen the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said, Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge? Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me. Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? Declare, if thou hast understanding. Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? Or who hath stretched the line upon it? Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? Or who laid the corner stone thereof, when the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?\n\nThe Book of Job goes on to list a number of aspects of the world that seem wonderful or miraculous beyond human understanding. The claim is that, if humans have no understanding of how the wonders of the world were created, they cannot fully understand the things that appear flawed.\n\nOthers argue that the observed suboptimality in one system or another is intentional, as a trade-off to improve overall optimal design.\n\nIntelligent design proponent William Dembski questions the first premise of the argument, maintaining a distinction between \"intelligent design\" and optimal design. An article written by John Woodmorappe on the Creation Ministries International website says that the panda's \"thumb\" works well for what the panda uses it for – to strip leaves.\n\nWhile the appendix has been previously credited with very little function, research has shown that it serves an important role in the fetus and young adults. Endocrine cells appear in the appendix of the human fetus at around the 11th week of development, which produce various biogenic amines and peptide hormones, compounds that assist with various biological control (homeostatic) mechanisms. In young adults, the appendix has some immune functions.\n\nCreationist Jonathan Sarfati and ophthalmologist Peter Gurney have both published articles on the Creation Ministries International website which disagree that the human eye is poorly designed, arguing that alternative arrangements would have further complications and that the human eye actually works very well.\n\nIn addition, the plantaris muscle does atrophy. Its motor function is so minimal that its long tendon can readily be harvested for reconstruction elsewhere with little functional deficit. \"Often mistaken for a nerve by freshman medical students, the muscle was useful to other primates for grasping with their feet. It has disappeared altogether in 9 percent of the population.\"\n\nIn response to the claim that uses have been found for \"junk\" DNA, proponents note that the fact that some non-coding DNA has a purpose does not establish that all non-coding DNA has a purpose, and that the human genome does include pseudogenes that are nonfunctional \"junk\", with others noting that some sections of DNA can be randomized, cut, or added to with no apparent effect on the organism in question. The original study that suggested that the \"Makorin1-p1\" served some purpose has been disputed. However, the original study is still frequently cited in newer studies and articles on pseudogenes previously thought to be nonfunctional.\n\nThe argument from poor design is sometimes interpreted, by the argumenter or the listener, as an argument against the existence of God, or against characteristics commonly attributed to a creator deity, such as omnipotence, omniscience, or personality. In a weaker form, it is used as an argument for the incompetence of God. The existence of \"poor design\" (as well as the perceived prodigious \"wastefulness\" of the evolutionary process) would seem to imply a \"poor\" designer, or a \"blind\" designer, or no designer at all. In Gould's words, \"If God had designed a beautiful machine to reflect his wisdom and power, surely he would not have used a collection of parts generally fashioned for other purposes. Orchids are not made by an ideal engineer; they are jury-rigged...\"\n\nThe apparently suboptimal design of organisms has also been used by theistic evolutionists to argue in favour of a creator deity who uses natural selection as a mechanism of his creation. Arguers from poor design regard counter-arguments as a false dilemma, imposing that either a creator deity designed life on earth well, or flaws in design indicate the life is not designed. This allows proponents of intelligent design to cherry pick which aspects of life constitute design, leading to the unfalsifiability of the theory. Christian proponents of intelligent design as evidence of the existence of the Abrahamic God Yahweh can claim that good design indicates the creative intelligence of their God, while poor design indicates corruption of the world as a result of free will that caused the Fall (Genesis 3:16 has Yahweh saying to Eve \"I will increase your trouble in pregnancy\").\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "13397852", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13397852", "title": "Aurel Kolnai", "text": "Aurel Kolnai\n\nAurel Thomas Kolnai (December 5, 1900 – June 28, 1973) was a 20th-century philosopher and political theorist.\n\nKolnai was born (as Aurel Stein) in Budapest, Hungary to Jewish parents, but moved to Vienna before his twentieth birthday to enter Vienna University, studying under Heinrich Gomperz, Moritz Schlick, Felix Kaufmann, Karl Bühler, and Ludwig von Mises. It was also at this time that he became attracted to the thinking of Franz Brentano and the phenomenological thought of Brentano’s student Edmund Husserl. Kolnai studied under Husserl briefly in 1928 in Freiburg. During the early 1920s, Kolnai wrote as an independent scholar with little success. He graduated \"summa cum laude\" in 1926, publishing his dissertation on \"Der Ethische Wert und die Wirklichkeit\", which was received favorably in Germany. In 1926, he also converted to Catholicism, largely influenced by G. K. Chesterton, whom Kolnai viewed as “a brilliant, if unsystematic phenomenologist of common experience.” He then began a career of political journalism, writing for \"Der Österreichische Volkswirt\" and \"Die Schöne Zukunft\". Acutely aware of the real threat posed by the Nazi Party in Austria, he began writing for \"Der Österreichische Ständestaat\", a periodical founded to combat Nazism and edited by Dietrich von Hildebrand. During this time, he also published some of his own philosophical writings including his \"Sexualethik\", \"Der Ekel\", \"Der Inhalt der Politik\", and \"Der Versuch über den Haß\". Kolnai's philosophical writings, though producing little profit for the author, were well received and generated excellent reviews. Salvador Dalí was impressed by \"Der Ekel\"; in a 1932 essay for the journal \"This Quarter\", the painter recommended Kolnai's text strongly to other surrealists, praising its analytical power.\n\nDuring the 1930s, the encroachment of the Nazi Party in Austria remained a major concern. In 1938, Kolnai published his critique of National Socialism titled \"The War Against the West\". The Nazi threat compelled Kolnai to leave Austria in 1937, where he was then a citizen, and depart for France where he married Elisabeth Gemes in 1940, also a Catholic convert. The Vichy threat prevented the newly-wed Kolnai from remaining in France, and after a brief stay in England, Kolnai and his wife moved to Quebec where he accepted a teaching position at the University of Laval. Frustrated by what he saw as the oppressive parochial Catholicism and the rigid neo-Thomism, Kolnai left Quebec in 1955 and returned to England on a Nuffield Foundation Travel Grant. Though he had quite an extensive list of publications in five different languages, Kolnai had little luck finding a permanent professorship in Britain, and fraught with financial worries, his health began to rapidly decline. Due largely to the influence of Harry Acton, Bernard Williams, and David Wiggins, Kolnai was able to secure a part-time “Visiting Lectureship” at Bedford College at London University. In England at this time, Kolnai became very influenced by the English common-sense philosophy of G.E. Moore and other British intuitionists such as H.A. Prichard, E.F. Carritt, and W.D. Ross. In 1961, he received a one-year research fellowship at Birmingham. In 1968, he accepted a visiting professor position at Marquette University in Wisconsin which he maintained until 1973 when he died of a heart attack. Kolnai’s wife Elisabeth worked on compiling, translating, and publishing his work until her death in 1982.\n\nKolnai is an eclectic, well-read thinker in the fields of philosophy, economics, and politics. His major philosophical influences were the phenomenological school of Husserl and British analytic philosophy. A major theme in his writings is the effort to recover the givenness of reality and the sovereignty of the object in order to develop a common-sense approach to philosophy. Kolnai drew on the philosophical realism of Thomas Aquinas and believed that Aquinas could provide a valuable contribution to the recovery of broad dialectical objectivism, but he was opposed to the rigidity of 20th century neo-Thomistic orthodoxy and the dogmatic claims of Thomistic ideology. Kolnai’s objectivism rests on four claims:\n\n\nKolnai was critical of Martin Heidegger’s and Sartre’s existentialism, claiming that “they have nothing to offer but doom-consciousness spiced with a high-sounding idealistic demand—or worse: a new version of the aesthete’s surrender to active barbarism, an espousal of totalitarian tyranny as the next best substitute for the impossible pursuit of total freedom.” Because the world was fallen and tension-ridden, Kolnai thought that Christianity should make its concern the secular world, in order to instill in it practical reason and morality, as expressed in a revealing passage in The War Against the West:\nPersonally I am inclined to think that in spite of its Christian polish, Luther’s pessimism is more pagan than Hegel’s pagan optimism, the latter being not entirely foreign to nineteenth-century progressive and constitutionalist views. For black despair is the very core of overweening arrogance. It is true that with Luther this is wrapped in the thread-bare guise of reckless belief in God’s grace independent of man’s conduct. Hegel, on the other hand, preserves some elements of actual morality.\n\nAnother major theme in Kolnai’s writings is his anti-utopianism. Daniel Mahoney contextualizes Kolnai’s anti-utopianism among such thinkers as Alain Besançon and Václav Havel as well as Solzhenitsyn who viewed utopian thinking as the ideological underpinning of totalitarianism. Kolnai explores what he calls the “utopian mind” phenomenologically, which he links with what he calls the “perfectionist illusion,” which is marked by the view that human goods existing in a state of tension can somehow be reconciled. The reconciliation of value and reality, according to Kolnai “suggests the idea of a rupture between the given reality of the world and the counter-reality ‘set apart.’” Kolnai thought that the identification of utopianism with a search for justice was misguided, led to the “forced negation of ineliminable tensions.” The quest for a utopia was, in its essence, a quest for a world no longer fraught with tension or human alienation—a quest which Kolnai saw as doomed to inevitable failure.\n\nKolnai’s political thought arises from both his phenomenological method and his belief in the importance of philosophy for human life. His emphasis on common sense and his practical point of view frames his political discussions in which he expresses himself as a genuine conservative, praising such concepts as social privilege and hierarchy. However, though Kolnai was sympathetic to what he called “the conservative ethos,” he was not a partisan thinker but rather a self-proclaimed centrist opposed to all forms of totalitarianism. Kolnai had an ongoing concern that unrestrained liberalism would inevitably end in totalitarianism, and his critiques of liberalism as he saw it manifest in the United States and Europe center on preventing such consequences. While supporting the cause of the liberal West and affirming pluralism, Kolnai also aptly stated that “to love democracy well, it is necessary to love it moderately.”\n\nKolnai’s ethical thought is characterized by strong loves and hates and expressed in terms of values and universal meanings. Broadly, his ethical thought can be described as Christian imperfectionism opposed to the elevation of morality beyond the everyday life. The negative character of moral duties was key for Kolnai, as expressed in his treatise on “Morality and Practice II:”\nWhen we speak of ‘respecting’ alien property (as also life or rights) we use that word in its weak sense of ‘leaving alone,’ ‘not touching,’ ‘not interfering with,’ much as it is used in French medical language (the rash of typhus fever ‘respects’ the face, i.e. in the soberer style of English textbooks, the face ‘escapes’), not in its strong sense of positive appreciation for something distinctively noble and respectable . . .\n\nKolnai was strongly influenced by Max Scheler’s value ethics, and he thought that if all things were viewed axiologically, assessed first for value, as opposed to the language of ‘ought’ or ‘must,’ then one was provided with “a realm of approbative or disapprobative insights . . . without stressing the unbridgeable gulf between Is and Ought.” Thus,\n“value ethics precludes the classic pitfalls in Ethics: Hedonism or Eudemonism; Utilitarianism and Consequentialism of any kind, i.e. the interpretation of moral in terms of allegedly more evident primary, natural cognitive experiences; and various kinds of Imperativism: ‘duty’ cut off from Good and Bad, and its interpretation in terms either of a concrete (social, monarchical, fashionable . . . ) authority, or the ‘rational ego,’ or of ‘Conscience. . . . Axiological ethic directs our attention not only to the plurality of moral values and disvalues, but to the falseness of every monism in regard to the object of moral valuation: be it action, intention, maxim or motive, virtue and vice, character, and all the more of course wisdom or again ontological perfection.”\n\nKolnai currently remains relatively unknown, but especially in the light of the dialectical return to classical political theory in the writings of Leo Strauss and Eric Voegelin, as well as the recent debates concerning neo-Conservative philosophy, it is likely that Kolnai will receive increasingly more attention in the near future. Kolnai has been praised by influential figures such as Dietrich von Hildebrand, H.B. Acton, Bernard Williams, and Pierre Manent.\n\n"}

Those similarities have attracted Indian and Western scholars attention, and have also been criticised by concurring schools. The similarities have been interpreted as Buddhist influences on Advaita Vedanta, though some deny such influences, or see them as expressions of the same eternal truth.\n\nAdvaita Vedanta (IAST, \"\"; ; literally, \"not-two\") is the oldest extant sub-school of Vedanta – an orthodox (\"āstika\") school of Hindu philosophy and religious practice. \"Advaita\" (philosophies, world views, teachings) is one of the classic Indian paths to spiritual realization. It took shape with the writings of Gaudapada in the 6th century CE.\n\nBuddhism is a religion and dharma that encompasses a variety of traditions, beliefs and spiritual practices based on teachings attributed to the Buddha (5th century BCE), but diversified since then in a wide variety of practices and traditions. Buddhism originated in India, from where it spread through much of Asia. It declined in India during the middle ages, after the rise of new forms of Hinduism, including Advaita Vedanta.\n\nAdvaita Vedanta and various other schools of Hindu philosophy share numerous terminology and doctrines with Buddhism. Of the various schools, the similarities between Advaita and Buddhism have attracted Indian and Western scholars attention. Isaeva states in her analysis of scholarly views, that these have historically and in modern times ranged from \"Advaita and Buddhism are very different\", to \"Advaita and Buddhism absolutely coincide in their main tenets\", to \"after purifying Buddhism and Advaita of accidental or historically conditioned accretions, both systems can be safely regarded as an expression of one and the same eternal absolute truth\".\n\nScholars such as Belvalkar, Hiriyanna, Radhakrishnan and Thibaut state that Advaita's and Buddhism's theories on True Reality and Maya are similar, and the influence of Buddhism on Advaita Vedanta has been significant. Both traditions hold that \"the empirical world is transitory, a show of appearances\", and both admit \"degrees of truth or existence\". Both traditions emphasize the human need for spiritual liberation (moksha, nirvana, kaivalya), however with different assumptions.\n\nFrank Whaling states that the similarities between Advaita Vedanta and Buddhism are not limited to the terminology and some doctrines, it includes practice. The monastic practices and monk tradition in Advaita are similar to those found in Buddhism.\n\nYet, according to Natalia Isaeva, \"Probably because of these similarities, even such an astute Buddhologist as Rozenberg was of the opinion that a precise differentiation between Brahmanism and Buddhism is impossible to draw\".\n\nThe similarities with Buddhism have been criticised by concurring Indian schools. Ramanujacharya, the founder of Vishishtadvaita Vedanta, accused Adi Shankara of being a \"Prachanna Bauddha\", that is, a \"crypto-Buddhist\", and someone who was undermining theistic Bhakti devotionalism. The non-Advaita scholar Bhaskara of the Bhedabheda tradition, similarly around 800 CE, accused Shankara's Advaita as \"this despicable broken down Mayavada that has been chanted by the Mahayana Buddhists\", and a school that is undermining the ritual duties set in Vedic orthodoxy.\n\nMahadevan states, \"At the outset it must be pointed out that, when the critics hurl the charge of pseudo-Buddhism against Advaita, they use the word Buddhism rather in a vague and general sense. The doctrine of unreality of the world, and the theory of non-recognition are found to be common as between the idealistic schools of Buddhism and Advaita. Most critics believe that these are not Upanishadic doctrines, and so, their conclusion is that Advaita must have borrowed them from the Mahayana schools. And the earliest teacher who effected this borrowing, in their view, is Gaudapada.\"\n\nScholars state that Advaita Vedanta was influenced by Mahayana Buddhism, given the common terminology, methodology and some doctrines. points out that the early commentators on the Brahma Sutras were all realists, or pantheist realists. He states that they were influenced by Buddhism, particularly during the 5th-6th centuries CE when Buddhist thought developing in the Yogacara school. Eliot Deutsch and Rohit Dalvi state:\nScholars are divided on possible Buddhist influence on Gaudapada's writing.\n\nThe influence of Mahayana on Advaita Vedanta, states Deutsch, goes back at least to Gaudapada, where he \"clearly draws from Buddhist philosophical sources for many of his arguments and distinctions and even for the forms and imagery in which these arguments are cast\".\n\nGaudapada, in his Karikas text, uses the leading concepts and wording of Mahayana Buddhist school but, states John Plott, he reformulated them to the Upanishadic themes. The influence of Buddhism on Gaudapada, states , is undeniable and to be expected. He writes,\nMichael Comans states Gaudapada, an early Vedantin, utilised some arguments and reasoning from Madhyamaka Buddhist texts by quoting them almost verbatim. However, Comans adds there is a fundamental difference between Buddhist thought and that of Gaudapada, in that Buddhism has as its philosophical basis the doctrine of Dependent Origination according to which \"everything is without an essential nature (\"nissvabhava\"), and everything is empty of essential nature (\"svabhava-sunya\")\", while Gaudapada does not rely on this principle at all. Gaudapada's \"Ajativada\" is an outcome of reasoning applied to an unchanging nondual reality according to which \"there exists a Reality (\"sat\") that is unborn (\"aja\")\" that has essential nature (\"svabhava\") and this is the \"eternal, fearless, undecaying Self (Atman) and Brahman\". Thus, Gaudapada differs from Buddhist scholars such as Nagarjuna, states Comans, by accepting the premises and relying on the fundamental teaching of the Upanishads.\n\nMahadevan suggests that Gaudapada adopted Buddhist terminology and borrowed its doctrines to his Vedantic goals, much like early Buddhism adopted Upanishadic terminology and borrowed its doctrines to Buddhist goals; both used pre-existing concepts and ideas to convey new meanings.\n\nSome scholars suggests that Gaudapada (6th Century CE) bridged Buddhism and Vedanta, by taking over the Buddhist doctrines that ultimate reality is pure consciousness (\"vijñapti-mātra\") and \"that the nature of the world is the four-cornered negation\". According to Gaudapada, the Absolute Reality, that is Brahman, is not subject to birth, change and death. The Absolute is \"aja\", the unborn eternal. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan also opines that Gaudapada's philosophy is different from that of Adi Shankara and Badarayan. , and suggest that Gaudapada took over the Buddhist concept of \"ajāta\" from Nagarjuna's Madhyamaka philosophy, which uses the term \"anutpāda\". An equivalent theory of \"Ajātivāda\", \"the Doctrine of no-origination\" or \"non-creation\", is the fundamental philosophical doctrine of Gaudapada.\n\nOther scholars, however, refute this idea. According to , Gaudapada's doctrines are unlike Buddhism. Gaudapada's influential text consists of four chapters; Chapter One, Two and Three of which are entirely Vedantin and founded on the Upanishads, with little Buddhist flavor. Chapter Four uses Buddhist terminology and incorporates Buddhist doctrines but Vedanta scholars who followed Gaudapada through the 17th century, state both Murti and Richard King, never referenced nor used Chapter Four, they only quote from the first three. While there is shared terminology, the doctrines of Gaudapada and Buddhism are fundamentally different, states . refutes the argument for Buddhist influence on Gaudapada's philosophy by arguing that the whole purpose of Gaudapada was to demonstrate the ultimate reality of the birth-less and non-dual Atman, a concept foreign to Buddhism. Scholars such as Murti state that, while there is shared terminology, the doctrines of Gaudapada and Buddhism are fundamentally different.\n\nGiven the principal role attributed to Shankara in Advaita tradition, his works have been examined by scholars for similarities with Buddhism. Buddhism supporters have targeted Shankara, states , while his Hindu supporters state that \"accusations\" concerning explicit or implicit Buddhist influence are not relevant. Daniel Ingalls writes, \"If we are to adopt a metaphysical and static view of philosophy there is little difference between Shankara and Vijnanavada Buddhism, so little, in fact that the whole discussion is fairly pointless. But if we try to think our way back into minds of philosophers whose works we read, there is a very real difference between the antagonists\".\n\nNinian Smart, a historian of religion, quotes Mudgal view that \"the differences between Shankara and Mahayana doctrines are largely a matter of emphasis and background, rather than essence\". Mudgal additionally states that the Upanishadic and Buddhist currents of thought \"developed separately and independently, opposed to one another, as the orthodox and heterodox, the thesis and antithesis, and a synthesis was attempted by the Advaitin Shankara\".\n\nDasgupta and Mohanta suggest that Buddhism and Shankara's Advaita Vedanta represent \"different phases of development of the same non-dualistic metaphysics from the Upanishadic period to the time of Sankara.\"\n\nAdvaita Vedanta holds the premise, \"Soul exists, and Soul (or self, Atman) is a self evident truth\". Buddhism, in contrast, holds the premise, \"Atman does not exist, and An-atman (or \"Anatta\", non-self) is self evident\".\n\nBuddhists do not believe that at the core of all human beings and living creatures, there is any \"eternal, essential and absolute something called a soul, self or atman\". Buddhists reject the concept and all doctrines associated with atman, call atman as illusion (\"maya\"), asserting instead the theory of \"no-self\" and \"no-soul\". Buddhism, from its earliest days, has denied the existence of the \"self, soul\" in its core philosophical and ontological texts. In contrast to Advaita which describes knowing one's own soul as identical with Brahman as the path to \"nirvana\", in its soteriological themes, Buddhism has defined nirvana as that blissful state when a person realizes that he or she has \"no self, no soul\".\n\nThe epistemological foundations of Buddhism and Advaita Vedanta are different. Buddhism accepts two valid means to reliable and correct knowledge – perception and inference, while Advaita Vedanta accepts six. However, some Buddhists in history, have argued that Buddhist scriptures are a reliable source of spiritual knowledge, corresponding to Advaita's \"Śabda\" pramana, however Buddhists have treated their scriptures as a form of inference method.\n\nAdvaita Vedanta is a substance ontology, an ontology \"which holds that underlying the seeming change, variety, and multiplicity of existence there are unchanging and permanent entities (the so-called substances)\".

Camphill communities are residential communities and schools that provide support for the education, employment, and daily lives of adults and children with developmental disabilities, mental health problems, or other special needs.\n\nThere are over 100 Camphill communities in more than 20 countries across Europe, North America, Southern Africa and Asia.\n\nThe movement was founded in 1939 at Kirkton House near Aberdeen by a group that included Austrian paediatrician Karl König. It was König's view that every human being possessed a healthy inner personality that was independent of their physical characteristics, including characteristics marking developmental or mental disability, and the role of the school was to recognize, nurture and educate this essential self. The communities' philosophy, anthroposophy, states that \"a perfectly formed spirit and destiny belong to each human being.\" The underlying principles of König's Camphill school were derived from concepts of education and social life outlined decades earlier by anthroposophist Rudolf Steiner (1861–1925). Today there are over 100 communities worldwide, in more than 20 countries, mainly in Europe, but also in North America and Southern Africa.\n\nThe Camphill Movement takes its name from Camphill Estate in the Milltimber area of Aberdeen, Scotland, where the Camphill pioneers moved to with their first community for children with special needs in June 1940. Camphill Estate is now a campus of Camphill School Aberdeen. There are six Camphills in the Aberdeen area.\n\nThe Camphill School Aberdeen was noted in the HMI/Care Commission report for 2007 as meeting \"very good\" to \"excellent\" standards, The school also holds Autism Accreditation from the National Autistic Society.\n\nThe Botton village received the Deputy Prime Minister's Award for Sustainable Communities in 2005; the award cited the community's dedication to the ethos of sustainability and mutual respect, as well as their concrete achievements in these areas.\n\n\n\n"}

Changes in the catch per unit effort are inferred to signify changes to the target species' true abundance. A decreasing CPUE indicates overexploitation, while an unchanging CPUE indicates sustainable harvesting.\n\nCPUE has a number of advantages over other methods of measuring abundance. It does not interfere with routine harvesting operations, and data are easily collected. The data are also easy to analyse, even for non-specialists, in contrast to methods based on transects. This means that decisions about stock management can also be made by the people doing the harvesting. The best practice is to standardise the effort employed (\"e.g.\" number of traps or duration of searching), which controls for the reduction in catch size that often results from subsequent efforts.\n\nAlthough CPUE is a relative measure of abundance, it can be used to estimate absolute abundances. The main difficulty when using measures of CPUE is to define the unit of effort.\n\n"}

{"id": "42657576", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42657576", "title": "Christianity and science", "text": "Christianity and science\n\nMost sources of knowledge available to early Christians were connected to pagan world-views. There were various opinions on how Christianity should regard pagan learning, which included its ideas about nature. For instance, among early Christian teachers, Tertullian (c. 160–220) held a generally negative opinion of Greek philosophy, while Origen (c. 185–254) regarded it much more favorably and required his students to read nearly every work available to them.\n\nHistorically, Christianity has often been a patron of sciences. It has been prolific in the foundation of schools, universities and hospitals, and many clergy have been active in the sciences. Historians of science such as Pierre Duhem credit medieval Catholic mathematicians and philosophers such as John Buridan, Nicole Oresme and Roger Bacon as the founders of modern science. Duhem concluded that \"the mechanics and physics of which modern times are justifiably proud to proceed, by an uninterrupted series of scarcely perceptible improvements, from doctrines professed in the heart of the medieval schools\".\n\nEarlier attempts at reconciliation of Christianity with Newtonian mechanics appear quite different from later attempts at reconciliation with the newer scientific ideas of evolution or relativity. Many early interpretations of evolution polarized themselves around a \"struggle for existence.\" These ideas were significantly countered by later findings of universal patterns of biological cooperation. According to John Habgood, all man really knows here is that the universe seems to be a mix of good and evil, beauty and pain, and that suffering may somehow be part of the process of creation. Habgood holds that Christians should not be surprised that suffering may be used creatively by God, given their faith in the symbol of the Cross. Robert John Russell has examined consonance and dissonance between modern physics, evolutionary biology, and Christian theology.\n\nChristian philosophers Augustine of Hippo (354–430) and Thomas Aquinas held that scriptures can have multiple interpretations on certain areas where the matters were far beyond their reach, therefore one should leave room for future findings to shed light on the meanings. The \"Handmaiden\" tradition, which saw secular studies of the universe as a very important and helpful part of arriving at a better understanding of scripture, was adopted throughout Christian history from early on. Also the sense that God created the world as a self operating system is what motivated many Christians throughout the Middle Ages to investigate nature.\n\nModern historians of science such as J.L. Heilbron, Alistair Cameron Crombie, David Lindberg, Edward Grant, Thomas Goldstein, and Ted Davis have reviewed the popular notion that medieval Christianity was a negative influence in the development of civilization and science. In their views, not only did the monks save and cultivate the remnants of ancient civilization during the barbarian invasions, but the medieval church promoted learning and science through its sponsorship of many universities which, under its leadership, grew rapidly in Europe in the 11th and 12th centuries, St. Thomas Aquinas, the Church's \"model theologian\", not only argued that reason is in harmony with faith, he even recognized that reason can contribute to understanding revelation, and so encouraged intellectual development. He was not unlike other medieval theologians who sought out reason in the effort to defend his faith. Some of today's scholars, such as Stanley Jaki, have claimed that Christianity with its particular worldview, was a crucial factor for the emergence of modern science.\n\nDavid C. Lindberg states that the widespread popular belief that the Middle Ages was a time of ignorance and superstition due to the Christian church is a \"caricature\". According to Lindberg, while there are some portions of the classical tradition which suggest this view, these were exceptional cases. It was common to tolerate and encourage critical thinking about the nature of the world. The relation between Christianity and science is complex and cannot be simplified to either harmony or conflict, according to Lindberg. Lindberg reports that \"the late medieval scholar rarely experienced the coercive power of the church and would have regarded himself as free (particularly in the natural sciences) to follow reason and observation wherever they led. There was no warfare between science and the church.\" Ted Peters in \"Encyclopedia of Religion\" writes that although there is some truth in the \"Galileo's condemnation\" story but through exaggerations, it has now become \"a modern myth perpetuated by those wishing to see warfare between science and religion who were allegedly persecuted by an atavistic and dogma-bound ecclesiastical authority\". In 1992, the Catholic Church's seeming vindication of Galileo attracted much comment in the media.\n\nA degree of concord between science and religion can be seen in religious belief and empirical science. The belief that God created the world and therefore humans, can lead to the view that he arranged for humans to know the world. This is underwritten by the doctrine of imago dei. In the words of Thomas Aquinas, \"Since human beings are said to be in the image of God in virtue of their having a nature that includes an intellect, such a nature is most in the image of God in virtue of being most able to imitate God\".\n\nDuring the Enlightenment, a period \"characterized by dramatic revolutions in science\" and the rise of Protestant challenges to the authority of the Catholic Church via individual liberty, the authority of Christian scriptures became strongly challenged. As science advanced, acceptance of a literal version of the Bible became \"increasingly untenable\" and some in that period presented ways of interpreting scripture according to its spirit on its authority and truth.\n\nMany well-known historical figures who influenced Western science considered themselves Christian such as Copernicus, Galileo, Kepler, Newton and Boyle.\n\nIsaac Newton, for example, believed that gravity caused the planets to revolve about the Sun, and credited God with the design. In the concluding General Scholium to the Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica, he wrote: \"This most beautiful System of the Sun, Planets and Comets, could only proceed from the counsel and dominion of an intelligent and powerful being.\" Other famous founders of science who adhered to Christian beliefs include Galileo, Johannes Kepler, and Blaise Pascal.\n\nAccording to \"100 Years of Nobel Prizes\" a review of Nobel prizes award between 1901 and 2000 reveals that (65.4%) of Nobel Prizes Laureates, have identified Christianity in its various forms as their religious preference.\n\nOverall, Christians have won a total of 72.5% in Chemistry between 1901 and 2000, 65.3% in Physics, 62% in Medicine, 54% in Economics.\n\nIn recent history, the theory of evolution has been at the center of controversy between Christianity and science, largely in America. Christians who accept a literal interpretation of the biblical account of creation find incompatibility between Darwinian evolution and their interpretation of the Christian faith. Creation science or scientific creationism is a branch of creationism that attempts to provide scientific support for the Genesis creation narrative in the Book of Genesis and attempts to disprove generally accepted scientific facts, theories and scientific paradigms about the geological history of Earth, cosmology, the chemical origins of life and biological evolution. It began in the 1960s as a fundamentalist Christian effort in the United States to prove Biblical inerrancy and falsify the scientific evidence for evolution. It has since developed a sizable religious following in the United States, with creation science ministries branching worldwide. In 1925, The State of Tennessee passed the Butler Act, which prohibited the teaching of the theory of evolution in all schools in the state. Later that year, a similar law was passed in Mississippi, and likewise, Arkansas in 1927. In 1968, these \"anti-monkey\" laws were struck down by the Supreme Court of the United States as unconstitutional, \"because they established a religious doctrine violating both the First and Fourth Amendments to the Constitution.\n\nMost scientists have rejected creation science for several reasons, including that its claims do not refer to natural causes and cannot be tested. In 1987, the United States Supreme Court ruled that creationism is religion, not science, and cannot be advocated in public school classrooms.\n\nTheistic evolution is a discipline that accepts the current scientific understanding of the age of the Earth and the theory of evolution. It includes a range of beliefs, including views described as evolutionary creationism, which accepts most findings of modern science but also upholds classical religious understandings of God and creation in Christian context.\n\nIn \"Reconciling Science and Religion: The Debate in Early-twentieth-century Britain\", historian of biology Peter J. Bowler argues that in contrast to the conflicts between science and religion in the U.S. in the 1920s (most famously the Scopes Trial), during this period Great Britain experienced a concerted effort at reconciliation, championed by intellectually conservative scientists, supported by liberal theologians but opposed by younger scientists and secularists and conservative Christians. These attempts at reconciliation fell apart in the 1930s due to increased social tensions, moves towards neo-orthodox theology and the acceptance of the modern evolutionary synthesis.\n\nIn the 20th century, several ecumenical organizations promoting a harmony between science and Christianity were founded, most notably the American Scientific Affiliation, The Biologos Foundation, Christians in Science, The Society of Ordained Scientists, and The Veritas Forum.\n\nWhile refined and clarified over the centuries, the Catholic position on the relationship between science and religion is one of harmony, and has maintained the teaching of natural law as set forth by Thomas Aquinas. For example, regarding scientific study such as that of evolution, the church's unofficial position is an example of theistic evolution, stating that faith and scientific findings regarding human evolution are not in conflict, though humans are regarded as a special creation, and that the existence of God is required to explain both monogenism and the spiritual component of human origins. Catholic schools have included all manners of scientific study in their curriculum for many centuries.\n\nGalileo once stated \"The intention of the Holy Spirit is to teach us how to go to heaven, not how the heavens go.\" In 1981 John Paul II, then pope of the Catholic Church, spoke of the relationship this way: \"The Bible itself speaks to us of the origin of the universe and its make-up, not in order to provide us with a scientific treatise, but in order to state the correct relationships of man with God and with the universe. Sacred Scripture wishes simply to declare that the world was created by God, and in order to teach this truth it expresses itself in the terms of the cosmology in use at the time of the writer\".\nThe influence of the Church on Western letters and learning has been formidable. The ancient texts of the Bible have deeply influenced Western art, literature and culture. For centuries following the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, small monastic communities were practically the only outposts of literacy in Western Europe. In time, the Cathedral schools developed into Europe's earliest universities and the church has established thousands of primary, secondary and tertiary institutions throughout the world in the centuries since. The Church and clergymen have also sought at different times to censor texts and scholars. Thus different schools of opinion exist as to the role and influence of the Church in relation to western letters and learning.\n\nOne view, first propounded by Enlightenment philosophers, asserts that the Church's doctrines are entirely superstitious and have hindered the progress of civilization. Communist states have made similar arguments in their education in order to inculcate a negative view of Catholicism (and religion in general) in their citizens. The most famous incidents cited by such critics are narratives of the Church in relation to Copernicus, Galileo Galilei and Johannes Kepler.\n\nIn opposition to this view, some historians of science, including non-Catholics such as J.L. Heilbron, A.C. Crombie, David Lindberg, Edward Grant, Thomas Goldstein, and Ted Davis, have argued that the Church had a significant, positive influence on the development of Western civilization. They hold that, not only did monks save and cultivate the remnants of ancient civilization during the barbarian invasions, but that the Church promoted learning and science through its sponsorship of many universities which, under its leadership, grew rapidly in Europe in the 11th and 12th centuries. St.Thomas Aquinas, the Church's \"model theologian,\" argued that reason is in harmony with faith, and that reason can contribute to a deeper understanding of revelation, and so encouraged intellectual development. The Church's priest-scientists, many of whom were Jesuits, have been among the leading lights in astronomy, genetics, geomagnetism, meteorology, seismology, and solar physics, becoming some of the \"fathers\" of these sciences. Examples include important churchmen such as the Augustinian abbot Gregor Mendel (pioneer in the study of genetics), Roger Bacon (a Franciscan friar who was one of the early advocates of the scientific method), and Belgian priest Georges Lemaître (the first to propose the Big Bang theory). Other notable priest scientists have included Albertus Magnus, Robert Grosseteste, Nicholas Steno, Francesco Grimaldi, Giambattista Riccioli, Roger Boscovich, and Athanasius Kircher. Even more numerous are Catholic laity involved in science:Henri Becquerel who discovered radioactivity; Galvani, Volta, Ampere, Marconi, pioneers in electricity and telecommunications; Lavoisier, \"father of modern chemistry\"; Vesalius, founder of modern human anatomy; and Cauchy, one of the mathematicians who laid the rigorous foundations of calculus.\n\nThroughout history many Catholic clerics have made significant contributions to science. These cleric-scientists include Nicolaus Copernicus, Gregor Mendel, Georges Lemaître, Albertus Magnus, Roger Bacon, Pierre Gassendi, Roger Joseph Boscovich, Marin Mersenne, Bernard Bolzano, Francesco Maria Grimaldi, Nicole Oresme, Jean Buridan, Robert Grosseteste, Christopher Clavius, Nicolas Steno, Athanasius Kircher, Giovanni Battista Riccioli, William of Ockham, and others. The Catholic Church has also produced many lay scientists and mathematicians.\n\nThe Jesuits have made numerous significant contributions to the development of science. For example, the Jesuits have dedicated significant study to earthquakes, and seismology has been described as \"the Jesuit science\". The Jesuits have been described as \"the single most important contributor to experimental physics in the seventeenth century\". According to Jonathan Wright in his book \"God's Soldiers\", by the eighteenth century the Jesuits had \"contributed to the development of pendulum clocks, pantographs, barometers, reflecting telescopes and microscopes, to scientific fields as various as magnetism, optics and electricity. They observed, in some cases before anyone else, the colored bands on Jupiter's surface, the Andromeda nebula and Saturn's rings. They theorized about the circulation of the blood (independently of Harvey), the theoretical possibility of flight, the way the moon affected the tides, and the wave-like nature of light.\"\n\nThe Jesuit China missions of the 16th and 17th centuries introduced Western science and astronomy, then undergoing its own revolution, to China. One modern historian writes that in late Ming courts, the Jesuits were \"regarded as impressive especially for their knowledge of astronomy, calendar-making, mathematics, hydraulics, and geography\". The Society of Jesus introduced, according to Thomas Woods, \"a substantial body of scientific knowledge and a vast array of mental tools for understanding the physical universe, including the Euclidean geometry that made planetary motion comprehensible\". Another expert quoted by Woods said the scientific revolution brought by the Jesuits coincided with a time when science was at a very low level in China.\n\nAccording to Andrew Dickson White's A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom from the 19th century, a biblical world view affected negatively the progress of science through time. Dickinson also argues that immediately following the Reformation matters were even worse. The interpretations of Scripture by Luther and Calvin became as sacred to their followers as the Scripture itself. For instance, when Georg Calixtus ventured, in interpreting the Psalms, to question the accepted belief that \"the waters above the heavens\" were contained in a vast receptacle upheld by a solid vault, he was bitterly denounced as heretical. Today, much of the scholarship in which the conflict thesis was originally based is considered to be inaccurate. For instance, the claim that early Christians rejected scientific findings by the Greco-Romans is false, since the \"handmaiden\" view of secular studies was seen to shed light on theology. This view was widely adapted throughout the early medieval period and afterwards by theologians (such as Augustine) and ultimately resulted in fostering interest in knowledge about nature through time. Also, the claim that people of the Middle Ages widely believed that the Earth was flat was first propagated in the same period that originated the conflict thesis and is still very common in popular culture. Modern scholars regard this claim as mistaken, as the contemporary historians of science David C. Lindberg and Ronald L. Numbers write: \"there was scarcely a Christian scholar of the Middle Ages who did not acknowledge [earth's] sphericity and even know its approximate circumference.\" From the fall of Rome to the time of Columbus, all major scholars and many vernacular writers interested in the physical shape of the earth held a spherical view with the exception of Lactantius and Cosmas.\n\nH. Floris Cohen argued for a biblical Protestant, but not excluding Catholicism, influence on the early development of modern science. He presented Dutch historian R. Hooykaas' argument that a biblical world-view holds all the necessary antidotes for the hubris of Greek rationalism: a respect for manual labour, leading to more experimentation and empiricism, and a supreme God that left nature and open to emulation and manipulation. It supports the idea early modern science rose due to a combination of Greek and biblical thought.\n\nOxford historian Peter Harrison is another who has argued that a biblical worldview was significant for the development of modern science. Harrison contends that Protestant approaches to the book of scripture had significant, if largely unintended, consequences for the interpretation of the book of nature. Harrison has also suggested that literal readings of the Genesis narratives of the Creation and Fall motivated and legitimated scientific activity in seventeenth-century England. For many of its seventeenth-century practitioners, science was imagined to be a means of restoring a human dominion over nature that had been lost as a consequence of the Fall.\n\nHistorian and professor of religion Eugene M. Klaaren holds that \"a belief in divine creation\" was central to an emergence of science in seventeenth-century England. The philosopher Michael Foster has published analytical philosophy connecting Christian doctrines of creation with empiricism. Historian William B. Ashworth has argued against the historical notion of distinctive mind-sets and the idea of Catholic and Protestant sciences. Historians James R. Jacob and Margaret C. Jacob have argued for a linkage between seventeenth century Anglican intellectual transformations and influential English scientists (e.g., Robert Boyle and Isaac Newton). John Dillenberger and Christopher B. Kaiser have written theological surveys, which also cover additional interactions occurring in the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries. Philosopher of Religion, Richard Jones, has written a philosophical critique of the \"dependency thesis\" which assumes that modern science emerged from Christian sources and doctrines. Though he acknowledges that modern science emerged in a religious framework, that Christinaity greatly elevated the importance of science by sanctioning and religiously legitimizing it in medieval period, and that Christianity created a favorable social context for it to grow; he argues that direct Christian beliefs or doctrines were not primary source of scientific pursuits by natural philosophers, nor was Christianity, in and of itself, exclusively or directly necessary in developing or practicing modern science.\n\nOxford University historian and theologian John Hedley Brooke wrote that \"when natural philosophers referred to \"laws\" of nature, they were not glibly choosing that metaphor. Laws were the result of legislation by an intelligent deity. Thus the philosopher René Descartes (1596–1650) insisted that he was discovering the \"laws that God has put into nature.\" Later Newton would declare that the regulation of the solar system presupposed the \"counsel and dominion of an intelligent and powerful Being.\" Historian Ronald L. Numbers stated that this thesis \"received a boost\" from mathematician and philosopher Alfred North Whitehead's \"Science and the Modern World\" (1925). Numbers has also argued, \"Despite the manifest shortcomings of the claim that Christianity gave birth to science—most glaringly, it ignores or minimizes the contributions of ancient Greeks and medieval Muslims—it too, refuses to succumb to the death it deserves.\" The sociologist Rodney Stark of Baylor University, argued in contrast that \"Christian theology was essential for the rise of science.\"\n\nProtestantism had an important influence on science. According to the Merton Thesis there was a positive correlation between the rise of Puritanism and Protestant Pietism on the one hand and early experimental science on the other. The Merton Thesis has two separate parts: Firstly, it presents a theory that science changes due to an accumulation of observations and improvement in experimental techniques and methodology; secondly, it puts forward the argument that the popularity of science in 17th-century England and the religious demography of the Royal Society (English scientists of that time were predominantly Puritans or other Protestants) can be explained by a correlation between Protestantism and the scientific values. In his theory, Robert K. Merton focused on English Puritanism and German Pietism as having been responsible for the development of the scientific revolution of the 17th and 18th centuries. Merton explained that the connection between religious affiliation and interest in science was the result of a significant synergy between the ascetic Protestant values and those of modern science. Protestant values encouraged scientific research by allowing science to study God's influence on the world and thus providing a religious justification for scientific research.\n\nAccording of \"Scientific Elite: Nobel Laureates in the United States\" by Harriet Zuckerman, a review of American Nobel prizes winners awarded between 1901 and 1972, 72% of American Nobel Prize Laureates, have identified from Protestant background. Overall, Protestant have won a total of 84.2% of all the American Nobel Prizes in Chemistry, 60% in Medicine, 58.6% in Physics, between 1901 and 1972.\n\nThe Religious Society of Friends, commonly known as Quakers, encouraged some values which may have been conducive to encouraging scientific talents. A theory suggested by David Hackett Fischer in his book \"Albion's Seed\" indicated early Quakers in the US preferred \"practical study\" to the more traditional studies of Greek or Latin popular with the elite. Another theory suggests their avoidance of dogma or clergy gave them a greater flexibility in response to science.\n\nDespite those arguments a major factor is agreed to be that the Quakers were initially discouraged or forbidden to go to the major law or humanities schools in Britain due to the Test Act. They also at times faced similar discriminations in the United States, as many of the colonial universities had a Puritan or Anglican orientation. This led them to attend \"Godless\" institutions or forced them to rely on hands-on scientific experimentation rather than academia.\n\nBecause of these issues it has been stated Quakers are better represented in science than most religions. There are sources, Pendlehill and Encyclopædia Britannica, that indicate that for over two centuries they were overrepresented in the Royal Society. Mention is made of this possibility in studies referenced in religiosity and intelligence and in a book by Arthur Raistrick. Whether this is still accurate, there have been several noteworthy members of this denomination in science. The following names a few.\n\nChristians (particularly Nestorian Christians) contributed to the Arab Islamic Civilization during the Ummayad and the Abbasid periods by translating works of Greek philosophers to Syriac and afterwards to Arabic. During the 4th through the 7th centuries, scholarly work in the Syriac and Greek languages was either newly initiated, or carried on from the Hellenistic period. Centers of learning and of transmission of classical wisdom included colleges such as the School of Nisibis, and later the School of Edessa, and the renowned hospital and medical academy of Jundishapur; libraries included the Library of Alexandria and the Imperial Library of Constantinople; other centers of translation and learning functioned at Merv, Salonika, Nishapur and Ctesiphon, situated just south of what later became Baghdad. The House of Wisdom was a library, translation institute, and academy established in Abbasid-era Baghdad, Iraq. Nestorians played a prominent role in the formation of Arab culture, with the Jundishapur school being prominent in the late Sassanid, Umayyad and early Abbasid periods. Notably, eight generations of the Nestorian Bukhtishu family served as private doctors to caliphs and sultans between the 8th and 11th centuries.\n\nEvents in Christian Europe such as the Galileo affair, associated with the Scientific revolution and the Age of Enlightenment, led scholars such as John William Draper to postulate a conflict thesis, holding that religion and science have been in conflict methodologically, factually and politically throughout history. This thesis is held by several scientists, such as Richard Dawkins, Lawrence Krauss, PZ Myers, Jerry Coyne, Steven Weinberg, and Sean M. Carroll. While the conflict thesis remains popular in anti-theistic circles, it has lost favor among most contemporary historians of science and the majority of scientists in elite universities in the US do not hold a conflict view.\n\nBy tradition:\n\nIn the US:\n\n"}

It includes various forms of art therapy, whereby individuals and groups can express themselves to nurture healing and restoration. It is also used to overcome the recurrence of violence, as a preventative measure to make the foundations of peace stronger, especially in contexts of war and conflict. Creating an environment of lasting peace is the primary goal of creative peacebuilding.\n\nAccording to Johan Galtung, peacebuilding is the process of creating self-supporting structures that \"remove causes of wars and offer alternatives to war in situations where wars might occur.\" For John Paul Lederach, peacebuilding is a comprehensive concept that encompasses, generates, and sustains the full array of processes, approaches, and stages needed to transform conflict toward more sustainable, peaceful relationships, which involves a wide range of activities. It has a diverse range of interaction and involves various stakeholders in various levels within the spectrum of governance and development.\n\nCreative peacebuilding facilitates the establishments of sustainable peace by preventing recurrence of violence, addresses the root causes, healing and effects of conflict, and offer alternatives to violence through reconciliation, economic and social transformation with the use of photography, film, painting, and the like. Jolyon Mitchell argues that the visual arts can both encourage peacebuilding and instigating violence. This is true of various forms of visual arts, ranging from posters, cartoons, and stained glass, to websites, radio, and films by reflecting on examples from around the world.\n\nCreative peacebuilding can be especially powerful when used with those suffering from a young demographic and those with post-traumatic stress disorder. For at-risk youth, it lays the roots for a peaceful lifestyle and to help children who have already experienced trauma in their lives become fully functional adults.\n\nArt therapy has been used to help rehabilitate child soldiers in Uganda as well as to help children who lost their homes in the tsunami of 2004 cope with their feelings. Many youth centers catering to impoverished children use art forms to build community, discipline and trust.\n\nMusic therapy can be used in several different fashions to build peace. It can be used to help individuals express themselves or to foster communication between individuals or groups of people. It can be used to nurture healing and reconciliation. Music is something that transcends language and national or ethnic boundaries. It has unique styles depending on the community it originates in and can also be adapted to fit individual's tastes. When two groups who have been in conflict or have the potential for conflict make music together communication and healing become possible. When individuals listen to or play music, they can reduce their stress levels and express their feelings.\n\nVisual art therapy can be used to help individuals cope with their feelings resulting from violent experiences. It is also used to treat post-traumatic stress disorder. Art therapy is especially useful for people who are having trouble verbalizing their feelings and are keeping them bottled up. By sharing their experiences and processing them through a tactical and visual activity, people are able to heal. No prior experience with visual art is needed to participate in and gain benefits from art therapy—it is about the process of creation, not about the aesthetic appeal of the product. Art therapy can be used in group settings as well—creating a collaborative art project can be an experience that bridges differences between people and builds feelings of trust.\n\nIf people who have lived through traumatic or violent experiences can relive them and change the situation or their response to the situation they can come to terms with their past. Virtual technology and especially virtual reality simulations can be especially useful in cases like these and have been used to treat veterans of the Iraq war who are suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. If the technology needed for these simulations is too expensive to be practical, mental visualization, in which the victim uses their imagination to create situations and feel as if they are gaining control of the way events play out, can be used as an alternative.\n\nCreate Peace Project is an arts-for-peace education organization working to promote the practices of peace and spread the message of hope and goodwill to children around the world using creativity. Create Peace Project was founded in San Francisco, California in 2007 by artist and peace activist Ross Holzman in response to the overwhelming amount of violence in the world, on the news, and in our communities. Violence, coupled with the lack of creativity in peoples lives sparked the creation of projects such as Banners for Peace and The Peace Exchange. Create Peace Project has included more than 25,000 children from around the world in its arts-for-peace projects since its inception and continues to work with schools in the US and beyond promoting peace through creativity to children of all ages.\n\nArtist Lily Yeh has helped to heal the wounds genocide left on a village of widows and orphans through her work with Barefoot Artists. The members of the community were provided with a chance to honor their lost loved ones through their construction of a beautiful and expressive monument commemorating the mass grave of the local victims of the genocide. The construction process also provided a sense of closure to their mourning. Other aspects of the peacebuilding process in the village included paintings on building walls created by the village children of things that they hoped to see in the future as well as things important to their everyday existence. On the economic side of this peacebuilding effort, the people of the village learned how to mosaic and pour concrete, two useful and marketable skills to help provide economic stability.\n\nIn the United State, creative peacebuilding is used in many inner-city areas in places such as New York, Philadelphia, and Louisville. The River City Drum Corps in Louisville, Ky provides a musical outlet for children who perhaps are not listened to in other parts of their lives.

Soon afterward, several fans began creating websites in which they touted the experience and tried to comprehensively catalogue the corresponding moments. A second wave of awareness began in April 1997, when Boston radio DJ George Taylor Morris discussed \"Dark Side of the Rainbow\" on the air, leading to further mainstream media articles and a segment on MTV news.\n\nIn July 2000, the cable channel Turner Classic Movies aired a version of \"Oz\" with the \"Dark Side\" album as an alternate soundtrack. Turner Entertainment Co. has owned the rights to the film since 1986.\n\nThere are various approaches regarding when to start synchronizing \"The Dark Side of the Moon\" audio with the film. Several involve the MGM lion as the cue. Most suggest the third roar, while some prefer the second or first. Others suggest starting the album not immediately after the lion's roar, but after the lion fades to black—exactly when the film begins. Viewing recommendations include reducing the film's audio and using captions or subtitles to follow the dialogue and plot.\n\nThe iconic dispersive prism of the album's cover purportedly reflects the movie's transition from black-and-white Kansas to Technicolor Oz; further examples include music changes at dramatic moments, such as the tornado near the start of the movie aligning with the screaming section of \"The Great Gig in the Sky\", and thematic alignments such as the scarecrow dance during \"Brain Damage\". This synergy effect has been described as an example of synchronicity, defined by the psychologist Carl Jung as a phenomenon in which coincidental events \"seem related but are not explained by conventional mechanisms of causality.\" \n\nDetractors argue that the phenomenon is the result of the mind's tendency to think it recognizes patterns amid disorder by discarding data that does not fit. Psychologists refer to this tendency as apophenia, or confirmation bias. In this theory, a Dark Side of the Rainbow enthusiast will focus on matching moments while ignoring the greater number of instances where the film and the album do not correspond.\n\nPink Floyd band members have repeatedly said that the reputed phenomenon is coincidence. In an interview for the 25th anniversary of the album, guitarist/vocalist David Gilmour denied the album was intentionally written to be synchronized with the film, saying \"Some guy with too much time on his hands had this idea of combining \"Wizard of Oz\" with \"Dark Side of the Moon\".\" On an MTV special about Pink Floyd in 2002, the band dismissed any relationship between the album and the movie, saying there were no means of reproducing the film in the studio at the time they recorded the album.\n\n\"Dark Side of the Moon\" audio engineer Alan Parsons in 2003 dismissed the supposed effect:It was an American radio guy who pointed it out to me. It's such a non-starter, a complete load of eyewash. I tried it for the first time about two years ago. One of my fiancée's kids had a copy of the video, and I thought I had to see what it was all about. I was very disappointed. The only thing I noticed was that the line \"balanced on the biggest wave\" came up when Dorothy was kind of tightrope walking along a fence. One of the things any audio professional will tell you is that the scope for the drift between the video and the record is enormous; it could be anything up to twenty seconds by the time the record's finished. And anyway, if you play any record with the sound turned down on the TV, you will find things that work.\n\nPink Floyd drummer Nick Mason told MTV in 1997, \"It's absolute nonsense. It has nothing to do with \"The Wizard of Oz\". It was all based on \"The Sound of Music\".\"\n\nFilm critic Richard Roeper published his assessment of the phenomenon, which he referred to as \"Dark Side of Oz.\" Roeper concluded that while the band may have had the resources and technical know-how to produce an alternative film soundtrack, undergoing such an endeavor would have been highly impractical. Roeper also noted the technical issue of the roughly 43-minute \"Dark Side of the Moon\" being short compared to the 101-minute \"The Wizard of Oz\".\n\nIn the book \"\", Nick Mason noted that the band was becoming proficient at creating movie soundtracks by the time they started the recording of \"The Dark Side of the Moon\", and that they even interrupted their work on the album so they could score yet another film. He explained the technical process that Pink Floyd used to score movies when he wrote about the recording of the 1972 \"Obscured by Clouds\" movie soundtrack:\n\nAfter the success of \"More\", we had agreed to do another sound track for Barbet Schroeder. His new film was called \"La Vallée\" and we travelled over to France to record the music in the last week of February... We did the recording with the same method we had employed for \"More\", following a rough cut of the film, using stopwatches for specific cues and creating interlinking musical moods that would be cross-faded to suit the final version... The recording time was extremely tight. We only had two weeks to record the soundtrack with a short amount of time afterwards to turn it into an album.\n\nThe fame of Dark Side of the Rainbow has prompted some to search for synchronicities among other albums by other bands and films by other directors. The lengthy Pink Floyd song \"Echoes\" from the 1971 album \"Meddle\" has been paired with \"Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite,\" the fourth act in the 1968 film \".\" Again the correspondences are primarily formal/structural and not grounded in the content of the lyrics. Both the track and the sequence are approximately 23 minutes.\n\nComedian Matt Herzau claims that the Pixar film \"WALL-E\" syncs up with Pink Floyd's rock opera \"The Wall,\" which he has called \"Another Brick in the WALL-E\", after the album's three-part song \"Another Brick in the Wall.\" Another popular Pink Floyd movie sync pairs \"The Wall\" with Disney's 1951 animated \"Alice in Wonderland\". In connection with \"Alice\", another Floyd-related album syncs up with that film – Syd Barrett's solo album \"The Madcap Laughs\". Additionally, The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway by Genesis has been synced up with this film.\n\nCanadian dance music artist Rich Aucoin's second album \"Ephemeral\" (released September 2014 in North America) is an adaptation of the themes of the novella \"The Little Prince\" and is meant to sync up to the 1979 short claymation film of the same name, along the lines of \"The Dark Side of the Moon\" and \"The Wizard of Oz\".\n\nThe French avant-jazz band Ghost Rhythms's third album \"Madeleine\" is meant to sync up with Alfred Hitchcock's \"Vertigo\".\n\nThe 2002 Disney film Treasure Planet is said to link up with The Mars Volta's debut album De-Loused In The Comatorium, in rare form, where several themes and lyrics are highlights. \n\nAfter the final two parts of \"Twin Peaks: The Return\" aired on Sunday, September 4, 2017, a rumor developed on social media advancing the theory that the final two parts (17 & 18) were meant to be watched and interpreted simultaneously. During a Reddit interview on September 10, 2017, \"The Return\"'s executive producer Sabrina S. Sutherland summarily dismissed these rumors, saying \"This is definitely not the way to watch these parts\", although later leaving the possibility somewhat more open-ended by conceding \"Maybe it's something I'm not aware of - could be. I'm not infallible!\"\n\nPodcaster Griffin McElroy jokingly watched the film \"\" alongside \"The Dark Side of the Moon\" as part of the eternal podcast \"Til Death do us Blart,\" noting several thematic, rhythmic, and lyrical synchronicities. McElroy described the viewing as \"a religious experience.\" \n\nIn the Angry Video Game Nerd's 2008 episode on the video game adaptation of \"The Wizard of Oz\", all the episode's events are deliberately synced up to Pink Floyd's \"The Dark Side of the Moon\" if one plays the first four songs of the album in sync to this episode.\n\nIn the 2012 film \"Fun Size\", the main character (Victoria Justice) decides to dress as Dorothy for a high school Halloween party after listening to \"The Dark Side of the Moon\". The film briefly includes a visual clip of the album in its record form.\n\nIn a 2014 Drum Corps International show, performed by the Colts, Dark Side of the Rainbow is portrayed as a world in which the Scarecrow rules Oz after Dorothy has left.\n\n"}

Its main points have been retained in the Rule of the Daughters of Wisdom. The congregation strives to acquire heavenly wisdom by imitating the Incarnate Wisdom, Jesus Christ.\n\nWhen St Louis died in 1716, the community numbered only four sisters, led by Blessed Marie Louise Trichet who had met Louis de Montfort in 1701 and became known as the \"First Daughter of Wisdom\" when she offered her services to the hospital. Her mother is said to have told her: \"You will become as mad as that priest\". There followed a forty-three year career during which she nursed the sick, gave food to beggars and administered the great maritime hospital of France. The poor people of the Hospital of Niort (Deux-Sèvres) called her \"good Mother Jesus\". In 1714, she was joined by Catherine Brunet.\n\nIn 1715, at the request of the Bishop of La Rochelle, the sisters moved to that city. Henceforth the congregation undertook both care of the sick and teaching. Sister Marie-Louise was superior of the congregation. On 22 August 1715, Montfort gave the habit of Wisdom to Sister Ste Croix and Sister Incarnation. In 1720 the site of their mother-house was acquired at Saint-Laurent-sur-Sèvre. Henceforth the life of Marie-Louise was to be a series of travels necessitated by new foundations and by visits to all her communities; in 1750 there were already thirty. She died on 27 April 1759. \n\nBy the time of the French Revolution, the sisters numbered 700. During the Revolutionary era, they were severely persecuted and imprisoned. Two sisters were guillotined at Nantes; and another two, Sisters Véronique and Jouin, at Rennes. Under Napoleon, the community regained most of their former houses and were granted 30,000 francs for building purposes. It was in 1810, when Napoleon was temporarily the master of Europe, that, at his call, the Daughters of Wisdom left French soil for the first time to nurse wounded soldiers at Antwerp. Numerous medals were bestowed on the congregation by Napoleon, and by every French Government since; Spain, Prussia, and Belgium have honoured them for nursing the wounded or plague-stricken soldiers of those countries; as a congregation they have been acknowledged in the Apostolic Brief of Pope Leo XII in 1825; they were canonically approved, together with the Fathers of the Company of Mary, in 1853; they were placed under Cardinal Vincenzo Vannutelli as protector, and favoured by two important decrees in 1893 and 1898 securing the integrity of Montfort's institution; and they received the definitive approbation of the constitutions of Montfort's double foundation in 1904.\n\nSince then the Daughters of Wisdom has grown to a multinational organisation with houses across the world.\n\n\n"}

Originally published in 1950 by Oxford University Press, the book has been republished numerous times by the same publisher, most recently in 1997. A 2007 Indian edition was published by Pilgrims Publishing. The book has been reviewed in several professional journals. All editions have had 194 pages and have used the same title.\n\nRadhakrishnan's \"Dhammapada\" contains original Pali text as well as English translations of the Dhammapada's 26 chapters. It begins with a preface composed in 1950 in which Radhakrishnan states that\n\nTo-day... We have come to recognize that it is either one world or none. The effort to build one world requires a closer understanding among the peoples of the world and their cultures. This translation of the \"Dhammapada\"... is offered as a small contribution to world understanding. The central thesis of the book, that human conduct, righteous behaviour, reflection, and meditation are more important than vain speculations about the transcendent - has an appeal to the modern mind... Books so rich in significance... require to be understood by each generation in relation to its own problems.\n\nThe preface also states that \n\n[The \"Dhammapada\"'s] teaching - to repress the instincts entirely is to generate neuroses; to give them full rein is also to end up in neuroses - is supported by modern psychology.\n\nNext is a 57-page introduction that is divided into two main sections. The first introductory section, less than 3 pages in length, is entitled simply \"The \"Dhammapada\",\" and briefly summarizes the \"Dhammapada\"'s historical context, noting that its verses connect with incidents in the Buddha's life \"and illustrate the method of teaching adopted by him.\" The second section, entitled \"Gautama the Buddha,\" has several subsections:\n\nAlso in the fifth section, Radhakrishnan offers his interpretation of three \"inadequacies\" or \"exaggerations\" in the Buddha's thought, which \"revealed themselves in [Buddhism's] later history and relation to Hinduism.\" These are that i) \"Philosophy is a natural necessity of the human mind,\" and the Buddha's hearers were unable to adopt suspended judgement on the ultimate questions; ii) \"The Buddha's conception of \"dharma\" as the absolute reality was not sufficiently concrete for practical purposes\"; and iii) The Buddha taught that one could renounce householder duties at any age. Radhakrishnan states that these \"exaggerations\" are understandable if we realize that in the Buddha's time, attempts to lead the spiritual life had to contend with \"three great enemies... the theologians, the ritualists, and the worldlings.\"\n\nThe largest part of the book (pp. 58–187) consists of a romanized transliteration of the original Pali text, plus a verse-by-verse English translation. Two examples are shown in the table at right. Many verses are augmented with footnotes or are followed by commentary, presented in a smaller font size than the verses themselves. The book concludes with a short selected bibliography, a 4-page Pali index (indicating which verses contain a specified word), and a 2-page general index.\n\nThe book has been reviewed in professional journals that include \"The Journal of Religion\", \"Philosophy\", \"Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies\", and \"Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland\".\n\nAshby stated that \"the distinct contribution of this volume is the Introduction,\" where \"Radhakrishnan sets out in clear and penetrating fashion to give the reader a basic understanding of the thought-world in which Buddhist ethical teaching moves. His discussion of the relation of the teachings of the Buddha to the Upanishads and his examination of the metaphysical views of Sakyamuni will prove valuable ... [and his] insistence upon the positive nature of the Buddhist conception of Nirvana is recommended reading for... victims of the 'annihilation-extinction' theory of Nirvana.\"\n\nHorner noted that the same Pali word is translated differently by Radhakrishnan in different places. \"Pali technical terms are, of course, recognized to contain a subtle variety of meanings. Some of these will be appreciated by anyone making... the reasonably intensive study of this volume which it deserves as well as makes possible.\" For example, \"Professor Radhakrishnan translates \"dhamma\" in the text by 'virtue' and by 'law... Thus, \"asava\" is rendered by 'passions', 'taints', 'impurities', and... \"Samadhi\" is usually 'tranquillity', once (ver. 271) 'meditative calm'.\"\n\nBrough described the book as \"a convenient presentation of the Pali text, and... a useful introduction to the work for beginners in Pali,\" although \"a comprehensive textual study in the light of the Tibetan and Central Asian parallel verses is still awaited.\"\n\nIn the journal \"Philosophy\", Stede stated that \"On the whole, the translation is clear and accurate.\" She added that the translated verses are \"frequently... supplemented by explanations taken from the early commentator Buddhaghosa and by comparative passages selected from philosophical and theological texts of East and West. Although perhaps too numerous, these extraneous references give evidence of the translator's wide learning.\"\n\nEditions have been published in 1950, 1954, 1958, 1966, 1968, 1980, 1982, 1984, 1988, 1991, 1992, 1996, 1997, and 2007, and include: \n\n\n"}
{"id": "5113995", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5113995", "title": "Eight Precepts", "text": "Eight Precepts\n\nIn Buddhism, the eight precepts (, ) is a list of precepts that are observed by lay devotees on observance days and festivals.\n\nThe first five of the eight precepts are similar to the five precepts, that is, to refrain from killing living beings, stealing, wrong speech and to abstain from intoxicating drink or drugs, but the third precept is abstinence of all sexual activity instead of refraining from sexual offenses. The final three precepts are to abstain from eating at the wrong time (after midday); to abstain from entertainment such as dancing, singing, music, watching shows, as well as to abstain from wearing garlands, perfumes, cosmetics, and personal adornments; and to abstain from luxurious seats and beds.\n\nTo surmise, following anthropologist translation from Pāli language used in Thai ceremonies:\nIn Thailand, when the eight precepts are taken, it is believed that if one of them is broken, they are all broken. In some medieval Chinese texts, the order of the last three items is different, though the precepts are the same.\n\nAccording to ethicist Damien Keown, the eight precepts were derived from the regulations described in the \"Brahmajala Sutta\", an Early Buddhist Text. Since in this discourse the Buddha describes his own behavior, Keown argues that the eight precepts and several other moral doctrines in Buddhism are derived from the Buddha as a model figure.\n\nOn regular observance days (, ), Buddhist lay devotees often observe the eight precepts. In that context, the eight precepts are also called the uposatha vows (Sanskrit and ; , ). When laypeople stay in a Buddhist monastery or go on a meditation retreat, they also observe the eight precepts often; they are also upheld during yearly festivals such as Vesak. Presently, the \"uposatha\" vows are mostly associated with Theravāda Buddhism in South and Southeast Asia, but it was a widespread practice in China as well, and is still practiced. In practice, in Theravāda traditions, the precepts are mostly observed by faithful devotees above 40 years of age. Since the eight precepts are often observed for one day, they are also known as the one-day precepts. Sometimes a formula is recited confirming the observance for one day (and one night):\n\nObservance does not need to be temporary, however: some lay devotees choose to undertake the eight precepts continuously to improve themselves in morality. Furthermore, many nuns in Buddhist countries, such as the \"mae chi\" in Thailand or the \"dasa sil mata\" in Sri Lanka, observe the eight or ten precepts all the time as part of their way of life.\n\nThe Pāli texts describe that one undertakes the eight precepts on the observance days following the example of the enlightened disciples of the Buddha. The eight precepts are meant to give lay people an impression of what it means to live as a monastic, and the precepts \"may function as the thin end of a wedge for attracting some to monastic life.\" People who are observing the eight precepts are sometimes also addressed differently. The objective of the eight precepts is different from the five in that they are less moral in nature, but more focused on developing meditative concentration, and preventing distractions. Indeed, in Sri Lanka, lay devotees observing the eight precepts are expected to spend much time and effort on meditation, focusing especially on meditation on the parts of the body. This is intended to develop detachment.\n\nAmong the eight precepts, the third precept is about maintaining chastity. Buddhist tradition therefore requires lay people to be chaste on observance days, which is similar to the historical Indian tradition of being chaste on \"parvan\" days. As for the sixth rule, this means not having food after midday, in imitation of a nearly identical rule for monks. Fluids are allowed. The seventh precept is sometimes also interpreted to mean not wearing colorful clothes, which has led to a tradition for people to wear plain white when observing the eight precepts. This does not necessarily mean, however, that a Buddhist devotee dressed in white is observing the eight precepts all the time. As for the eighth precept, not sitting or sleeping on luxurious seats or beds, this usually comes down to sleeping on a mat on the floor. Though not specified in the precepts themselves, in Thailand and China, people observing the precepts usually stay in the temple overnight. This is to prevent temptations at home which break the eight precepts, and helps foster the community effort in upholding the precepts.\n\nIn 6th-century Korea, the eight precepts came to be associated with worship of Maitreya, due to the work of Hyeryang, a Korean monk that wrote a tract about these matters. In the late 1800s in Sri Lanka, there was a renewed interest in the tradition of observing the eight precepts, during the time of the Buddhist revival. This was mostly because of the influence of Anagarika Dharmapala, who observed the ten precepts (similar to the eight) continuously, maintaining a status between lay person and monk. The interest was further fostered by campaigns emphasizing Buddhist religious practice on traditional observance days.\n\n"}

{"id": "11174320", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11174320", "title": "Equine-assisted therapy", "text": "Equine-assisted therapy\n\nEquine-assisted therapy (EAT) encompasses a range of treatments that involve activities with horses and other equines to promote human physical and mental health. The use of EAT has roots in antiquity, and EAT applies to physical health issues in modern form dates to the 1960s. Modern use of horses for mental health treatment dates to the 1990s. Systematic review of studies of EAT as applied to physical health date only to about 2007, and a lack of common terminology and standardization has caused problems with meta-analysis. Due to a lack of high-quality studies assessing the efficacy of equine-assisted therapies for mental health treatment, concerns have been raised that these therapies should not replace or divert resources from other evidence-based mental health therapies.\n\nAn overall term that encompasses all forms of equine therapy is Equine-Assisted Activities and Therapy (EAAT). Various therapies that involve interactions with horses and other equines are used for individuals with and without special needs, including those with physical, cognitive and emotional issues. Terminology within the field is not standardized, and the lack of clear definitions and common terminology presents problems in reviewing medical literature. Within that framework, the more common therapies and terminology used to describe them are:\n\n\nMost research has focused on physical benefit of therapeutic work with horses, though the most rigorous studies have only been subject to systematic review since about 2007.\n\nEAAT have been used to treat individuals with neurological diseases or disorders such as cerebral palsy, movement disorders, or balance problems. It is believed the rhythmical gait of a horse acts to move the rider's pelvis in the same rotation and side-to-side movement that occurs when walking; the horse's adjustable gait promotes riders to constantly adjust to encourage pelvic motion while promoting strength, balance, coordination, flexibility, posture, and mobility.\n\nEAAT have also been used to treat other disabilities, such as autism, behavioral disorders and psychiatric disorders. Due to a lack of rigorous scientific evidence, there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate if equine therapy for mental health treatment provides any benefit.\n\nTherapeutic riding is used by disabled individuals who ride horses to relax, and to develop muscle tone, coordination, confidence, and well-being.\n\nTherapeutic horseback riding is considered recreational therapy where an individual is taught by a non-therapist riding instructor how to actively control a horse while riding. It is used as exercise to improve sensory and motor skills for coordination, balance, and posture.\n\nMost research has focused on the physical benefit of therapeutic work with horses, with the most rigorous studies being subject to systematic review since about 2007. Claims made as to the efficacy of equine therapies for mental health purposes have been criticized as lacking proper medical evidence due in large part to poor study design and lack of quantitative data. Ethical questions relating to its expense and its continued promotion have been raised in light of this lack of evidence. While such therapies do not appear to cause harm, it has been recommended they not be used as a mental treatment at this time unless future evidence shows a benefit for treating specific disorders.\n\nHippotherapy is an intervention used by a physical therapist, recreational therapist, occupational therapist, or speech and language pathologist. The movement of the horse affects a rider's posture, balance, coordination, strength and sensorimotor systems. It is thought that the warmth and shape of the horse and its rhythmic, three-dimensional movement along with the rider's interactions with the horse and responses to the movement of the horse can improve the flexibility, posture, balance and mobility of the rider. It differs from therapeutic horseback riding because it is one treatment strategy used by a licensed physical therapist, occupational therapist, or speech and language pathologists. They guide the rider's posture and actions while the horse is controlled by a horse handler at the direction of the therapist. The therapist guides both the rider and horse to encourage specific motor and sensory inputs. Therapists develop plans to address specific limitations and disabilities such as neuromuscular disorders, walking ability, or general motor function.\n\nEquine-assisted psychotherapy (EAP) or Equine Facilitated Psychotherapy (EFP) is the use of equines to treat human psychological problems in and around an equestrian facility. It is not the same as therapeutic riding or hippotherapy. Though different organizations may prefer one term over the other for various reasons, in practice, the two terms are used interchangeably. Other terms commonly used, especially in Canada, include Equine Facilitated Wellness (EFW), Equine Facilitated Counselling (EFC) and Equine Facilitated Mental Health (EFMH).\n\nWhile some mental health therapies may incorporate vaulting and riding, most utilize groundwork with horses. Some programs only use ground-based work. There are also differences between programs over whether the horse is viewed as a co-facilitator, or simply as a tool.\n\nThe field of equine-assisted psychotherapy did not publicly become a part of the equine-assisted therapy world until the 1990s, although individuals had been experimenting with the concept prior to that time. The first national group in the United States, the Equine-Facilitated Mental Health Association (EFMHA), now a part of PATH International, formed in 1996. The mental health area of equine-assisted therapy became subject to a major rift when a second group, the Equine Growth and Learning Association (EAGALA) formed in 1999, splitting from EFMHA (now PATH) over differences of opinion about safety protocols. Since that time, additional differences have arisen between the two groups over safety orientation, the therapeutic models used, training programs for practitioners, and the role of riding. EAGALA itself had a further split between its founders in 2006 due to legal issues, with yet another new organization formed.\n\nAs a result, although PATH and EAGALA remain the two main certification organizations in the United States, there has been a significant amount of misunderstanding amongst practitioners, client, and within the scientific literature. To resolve these differences, an independent organization, the Certification Board for Equine Interaction Professionals (CBEIP) formed, beginning in 2007, to promote professional credibility in the field. However, the world of equine-assisted psychotherapy remains disorganized and has not standardized its requirements for education or credentialing.\n\nHorses have been utilized as a therapeutic aid since the ancient Greeks used them for those people who had incurable illnesses. Its earliest recorded mention is in the writings of Hippocrates who discussed the therapeutic value of riding. The claimed benefits of therapeutic riding have been dated back to 17th century literature where it is documented that it was prescribed for gout, neurological disorder and low morale. In 1946 Equine Therapy was introduced in Scandinavia after an outbreak of poliomyelitis.\n\nHippotherapy as currently practiced was developed in the 1960s, when it began to be used in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland as an adjunct to traditional physical therapy. The treatment was conducted by a physiotherapist, a specially trained horse, and a horse handler. The physiotherapist gave directives to the horse handler as to the gait, tempo, cadence, and direction for the horse to perform. The movement of the horse was carefully modulated to influence neuromuscular changes in the patient. The first standardized hippotherapy curriculum would be formulated in the late 1980s by a group of Canadian and American therapists who travelled to Germany to learn about hippotherapy and would bring the new discipline back to North America upon their return. The discipline was formalized in the United States in 1992 with the formation of the American Hippotherapy Association (AHA). Since its inception, the AHA has established official standards of practice and formalized therapist educational curriculum processes for occupational, physical and speech therapists in the United States.\n\nTherapeutic riding as a therapy started with Liz Hartel from Denmark. Her legs were paralyzed from polio but with therapy she was able to win the silver medal for dressage in the 1952 Olympic Games. At about that time, in Germany, therapeutic riding was used to address orthopaedic dysfunctions such as scoliosis. The first riding centers in North America began in the 1960s and the North American Riding for the Handicapped Association (NARHA) was launched in 1969. Therapeutic riding was introduced to the United States and Canada in 1960 with the formation of the Community Association of Riding of the Disabled (CARD). In the United States riding for the disabled developed as a form of recreation and as a means of motivation for education, as well as its therapeutic benefits. In 1969 the Cheff Therapeutic Riding Center for the Handicapped was established in Michigan, and remains the oldest center specifically for people with disabilities in the United States.\n\nThe North American Riding for Handicapped Association (NARHA) was founded in 1969 to serve as an advisory body to the various riding for disabled groups across the United States and its neighboring countries. In 2011, NARHA changed its name to the Professional Association of Therapeutic Horsemanship (PATH) International.\n\nIn most cases, horses are trained and selected specifically for therapy before being integrated into a program. Therapy programs choose horses of any breed that they find to be calm, even-tempered, gentle, serviceably sound, and well-trained both under saddle and on the ground. As most equine-assisted therapy is done at slow speeds, an older horse that is not in its athletic prime is sometimes used.\n\nEquine-assisted therapy programs try to identify horses that are calm but not lazy and physically suited with proper balance, structure, muscling and gaits. Muscling is not generally considered to be as important as the balance and structural correctness, but proper conditioning for the work it is to do is required. Suitable horses move freely and have good quality gaits, especially the walk. Unsound horses that show any signs of lameness are generally avoided.\n\nThe welfare of the horse is taken into consideration. Each individual animal has natural biological traits but also has a unique personality with its own likes, dislikes and habits. Paying attention to what the animal is trying to communicate is helpful both in sessions of EAAT, but also to prevent burnout for the horse. Some programs refer to the therapy horse as an \"equine partner\". Other programs view the horse as a \"metaphor\" with no defined role other than to \"be themselves.\" Equine Facilitated Wellness programs, particularly those following the EFW-Canada certification route view the horse as 'sentient being': \"The equine is a sentient being, partner and co-facilitator in the equine facilitated relationship and process\".\n\nThere is some evidence that hippotherapy can help improve the posture control of children with cerebral palsy, although the use of mechanical hippotherapy simulators produced no clear evidence of benefit. A systematic review of studies on the outcomes of horseback riding therapy on gross motor function in children with cerebral palsy was concluded in 2012 with a recommendation for a \"large randomized controlled trial using specified protocols\" because, although positive evidence was indicated by nine high-quality studies surveyed, the studies were too limited to be considered conclusive.\n\nOverall, reviews of equine-assisted therapy scientific literature indicate \"there is no unified, widely accepted, or empirically supported, theoretical framework for how and why these interventions may be therapeutic\" The journal \"Neurology\" published a 2014 study finding inadequate data to know whether hippotherapy or therapeutic horseback riding can help the gait, balance, or mood of people with multiple sclerosis. There is no evidence that therapeutic horseback riding is effective in treating children with autism.\n\nThere is currently insufficient medical evidence to support the effectiveness of equine-related treatments for mental health. Multiple reviews have noted problems with the quality of research such as the lack of independent observers, rigorous randomized clinical trials, longitudinal studies, and comparisons to currently accepted and effective treatments. A 2014 review found these treatments did no physical harm, but found that all studies examined had methodological flaws, which led to questioning the clinical significance of those studies; the review also raised ethical concerns both about the marketing and promotion of the practice and the opportunity cost if patients in need of mental health services were diverted from evidence-based care. The review recommended that both individuals and organizations avoid this therapy unless future research establishes verifiable treatment benefits.\n\nThe Professional Association of Therapeutic Horsemanship (PATH) accredits centers and instructors that provide equine-assisted therapy. The Equine Assisted Growth and Learning Association (EAGALA) focuses only on mental health aspects of human-equine interaction, and provides certification for mental-health and equine professionals.\n\nIn Canada, centers and instructors for Therapeutic Riding are regulated by CanTRA, also known as The Canadian Therapeutic Riding Association. The field of Equine Facilitated Wellness is regulated by Equine Facilitated Wellness – Canada (EFW-Can) which provides a national certification program and certifies trainers and mentors to provide independent training at approved programs across Canada.\n\nThe American Hippotherapy Association offers certification for working as a hippotherapist. Hippotherapy Clinical Specialty (HPCS) Certification is a designation indicating board certification for therapists who have advanced knowledge and experience in hippotherapy. Physical therapists, occupational therapists, and speech-language pathologists in practice for at least three years (6,000 hours) and have 100 hours of hippotherapy practice within the prior three years are permitted to take the Hippotherapy Clinical Specialty Certification Examination through the American Hippotherapy Certification Board. Those who pass are board-certified in hippotherapy, and entitled to use the HPCS designation after their name. HPCS certification is for five years. After five years the therapist can either retake the exam or show written evidence of 120 hours of continuing education distributed over the five years. Continuing education must include 50% (60 hours) in education related to equine subject matter: psychology, training, riding skills and so on; 25% (30 hours) in education related to direct service in the professional discipline and 25% (30 hours) in any other subject related to hippotherapy. An alternative is to provide written evidence of scholarly activity appropriate to the field of hippotherapy. Acceptable scholarly activity may include graduate education in hippotherapy, publication of articles on hippotherapy in juried publications, scientific research related to hippotherapy, the teaching or development of hippotherapy, or acting as AHA-approved course faculty. AHA, Inc. now recognizes two different AHCB credentials: AHCB Certified Therapist and AHCB Certified Hippotherapy Clinical Specialist.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "22612861", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22612861", "title": "Exemplification theory", "text": "Exemplification theory\n\nExemplification theory is a theory that states that an event is the exemplification of a property in an entity. This identity is often modeled as an \"ordered triple\" of an entity, property type, and time).\n\nMuch of exemplification theory is based on logic arguing that there are evolutionary advantages that stem from the ability to group events together. Humans do this by sifting through experiences to group those that seem to go together and coding the occurrence of events in a quantitative manner that allows them to make judgments (most often nonconsciously) of how frequently different events occur. These judgments are considered based on two cognitive devices: the availability heuristic and the representativeness heuristic.\n\nThe availability heuristic tells us that judgments of social phenomena are greatly influenced by the ease with which information comes to mind. Availability heuristics can be a useful tool for assessing frequency or probability of an event. Individuals that employ the availability heuristic evaluate the frequency of events based on the quickness with which pertinent instances come to mind.\n\nThe representativeness heuristic is a special case of availability. It stipulates that abstract base-rate information plays little role in quantitative judgments about event populations. Instead, these judgments are based on the sample of more concrete exemplars that are available to the individual at the time of decision making. Exemplification theory is a simple combination of these heuristics. It posits that since exemplars come to mind more easily than base-rates when accessing information, available exemplars will dominate base-rate information when making judgments of event populations.\n\nBehavioral intentions are the direct determinants of behaviors. Much of this research focuses on the manipulation of attitudes, subjective norms, and/or behavioral control with the message having a direct impact on receivers based on the information provided and the presentation of base-rates and exemplars. Exemplification theory examines the role of base-rates and exemplars in communication messages. Individuals pay attention to (and are more influenced by) exemplars than by base-rate data. Base-rates are not always inconsequential.\n\nCriticism in the 1980s rejected exemplificationism, charging that it ultimately conﬂates events with facts. Since then, exemplificationism has lost almost all of its previous popularity.\n\nAn exemplar is an instance of an event population that shares essential features with all other instances from the group of events that is defined by those features. In a sense, exemplars are case reports used to represent characteristics typical of a group of event. Commonly, exemplars are illustrative representations of information. An exemplar will provide a demonstration of an event.\n\nExemplars used in conjunction with base-rates as case illustrations of event populations to enhance or detract from given base-rate information as the salient features of the exemplar are representative of the event population. As with news reports, exemplars are often added to provide a description of an event being discussed within a report and are chosen for their entertaining qualities.\n\nBase-rates present descriptions limited to certain general features of the event population. Base-rate information often comes in the form of a numerical representation such as the frequency with which an event occurs. Typically it is thought of as quantitative information\nabout population events or a general description of the number of things or people in the setting.\n\nBase-rates are said to be less illustrative or vivid than exemplar information. They have not been examined as often as exemplars. They are overwhelmed by exemplars in many circumstances, it does not appear that they are always ignored. Prior investigations suggest that base-rates are perceived by decision makers as more reliable and can influence decisional confidence more than exemplars. Base-rates are perceived as more truthful, precise, and accurate than exemplars. Nevertheless, recent research has shown that exemplification effects are prone to other perceptual phenomena.\n\nSome research suggests several disadvantages to the use of exemplars, particularly in relation to perceptual bias that might result from their use. Exemplars are also said to play a role in perpetuating negative stereotypes, and in isolation are frequently found to be inefficient sources of information.\n\nExemplar information has largely been found to be less reliable than base-rate information. In part, because it is seldom collected or presented in a systematic manner.\n\nExemplification research demonstrates that individuals often base their assessment of social reality more strongly on attributes of the exemplars selected for inclusion in media reports than statistical representations of information. This has been found problematic when the exemplar is atypical and chosen for its entertaining or sensational qualities, a common occurrence within news stories.\n"}

While originating in Greater China, they may also apply to Chinese-speaking people around the world. However, most homonymic pairs listed work only in some varieties of Chinese (for example, Mandarin only or Cantonese only), and may appear bewildering even to speakers of other varieties of Chinese.\n\nCertain customs regarding good and bad luck are important to many Chinese people. Although these might be regarded as superstitions by people from other cultures, these customs are often tied to religious traditions and are an important part of many people's belief systems, even among well-educated people and affluent sectors of society.\n\nGiving a clock (送鐘/送钟, sòng zhōng) is often taboo, especially to the elderly as the term for this act is a homophone with the term for the act of attending another's funeral (送終/送终, sòngzhōng). A UK government official Susan Kramer gave a watch to Taipei mayor Ko Wen-je unaware of such a taboo which resulted in some professional embarrassment and a pursuant apology.\nCantonese people consider such a gift as a curse.\n\nThis homonymic pair works in both Mandarin and Cantonese, although in most parts of China only clocks and large bells, and not watches, are called \"zhong\", and watches are commonly given as gifts in China.\n\nHowever, should such a gift be given, the \"unluckiness\" of the gift can be countered by exacting a small monetary payment so the recipient is buying the clock and thereby counteracting the (\"give\") expression of the phrase.\n\nIt is undesirable to give someone a fan or an umbrella as a gift. The words fan \"shàn\" () and umbrella \"sǎn\" () sound like the word \"sǎn/sàn\" (), meaning to scatter, or to part company, to separate, to break up with someone, to split.\n\nThese homonymic pairs work in Mandarin and Cantonese, though Cantonese has a more idiomatic term for umbrellas (\"ze1\" in Cantonese, ) to avoid precisely this association.\n\nAs a book () is a Mandarin homophone of \"loss, to lose\" (), carrying or looking at a book () where people are taking a risk, such as gambling or investing in stocks, may be considered to invite bad luck and loss (). This bad luck does not apply to carrying or reading newspapers () as newspapers () are not books.\n\nThis homonymic pair works in Mandarin.\n\nSharing a pear with friends or loved ones can be a mistake. \"Sharing a pear\" () is a homophone of \"to separate, to part, to leave\" (), both pronounced \"fēnlí\" in Mandarin. Sharing with distant friends is okay.\n\nThis homonymic pair works in Mandarin.\n\nIt is also thought to be bad luck to give shoes as a gift. \"Shoes\" ( xié) in Mandarin is a homophone of \"evil\" ( xié). Additionally, the Chinese people believe that gifting shoes equips a person to \"walk away\" from a relationship.\n\nThis homonymic pair works in Mandarin only and, other than part of northern China, there is no such superstition in any other part of China.\n\n"}

Returning to theology, he attempted to connect it with philosophy in a treatise, \"Dilucidationes philosophicae, de deo, anima humana, mundo\" (Tübingen, 1725, 1746, 1768). This work contains nothing original but giving a clear representation of Wolff's philosophy. It met with great success, and the author was appointed to the office of preacher at the castle of Tübingen and of reader in the school of theology.\n\nIn 1721, after two years study under Wolff, he became professor of philosophy at Halle, and in 1724 professor of mathematics. His friends at Tübingen disapproved of his new views, and in 1725, on Wolff's recommendation, he was invited by Peter I of Russia to lecture in Saint Petersburg, where he was well received. His success in winning the prize of a thousand crowns offered for a dissertation on the cause of gravity by the Académie des Sciences of Paris secured his return to his native land in 1731.\n\nIn 1735, largely on account of his knowledge of military engineering, Karl Alexander, Duke of Württemberg (reigned 1733–1737) made him a privy councillor, but his hands were tied owing to the frivolous atmosphere of the court. On the death of the duke, however, he became a member of the Regency Council, and devoted himself with energy and success to the reorganization of the state. In the departments of education, state-religion, agriculture and commerce, his administration was uniformly successful, and he became in a real sense the head of the state. He died at Stuttgart.\n\nAfter his return from Imperial Russia, he won the highest respect at home and abroad, and Frederick II of Prussia is recorded to have said of him, \"He was a great man whom I shall ever remember with admiration.\"\n\nBeside the \"Dilucidationes\", he wrote \"De harmonia animi et corporis humani commentatio\" (Frankfurt and Leipzig, 1735; Tübingen, 1741); \"De origine et permissione mali\" (1724), an account of the Leibnitzian theodicy.\n\n"}

{"id": "22393126", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22393126", "title": "Inferno (Dante)", "text": "Inferno (Dante)\n\nInferno (; Italian for \"Hell\") is the first part of Italian writer Dante Alighieri's 14th-century epic poem \"Divine Comedy\". It is followed by \"Purgatorio\" and \"Paradiso\". The \"Inferno\" tells the journey of Dante through Hell, guided by the ancient Roman poet Virgil. In the poem, Hell is depicted as nine concentric circles of torment located within the Earth; it is the \"realm ... of those who have rejected spiritual values by yielding to bestial appetites or violence, or by perverting their human intellect to fraud or malice against their fellowmen\". As an allegory, the \"Divine Comedy\" represents the journey of the soul toward God, with the \"Inferno\" describing the recognition and rejection of sin.\n\nCanto I\n\nThe poem begins on the night of Maundy Thursday on March 24 (or April 7), A.D. 1300, shortly before dawn of Good Friday. The narrator, Dante himself, is thirty-five years old, and thus \"midway in the journey of our life\" (\"Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita\") – half of the Biblical lifespan of seventy (Psalm 89:10, Vulgate; Psalm 90:10, KJV). The poet finds himself lost in a dark wood (\"selva oscura\"), astray from the \"straight way\" (\"diritta via\", also translatable as \"right way\") of salvation. He sets out to climb directly up a small mountain, but his way is blocked by three beasts he cannot evade: a \"lonza\" (usually rendered as \"leopard\" or \"leopon\"), a \"leone\" (lion), and a \"lupa\" (she-wolf). The three beasts, taken from the Jeremiah 5:6, are thought to symbolize the three kinds of sin that bring the unrepentant soul into one of the three major divisions of Hell. According to John Ciardi, these are incontinence (the she-wolf); violence and bestiality (the lion); and fraud and malice (the leopard); Dorothy L. Sayers assigns the leopard to incontinence and the she-wolf to fraud/malice. It is now dawn of Good Friday, April 8, with the sun rising in Aries. The beasts drive him back despairing into the darkness of error, a \"lower place\" (\"basso loco\") where the sun is silent (\"l sol tace\"). However, Dante is rescued by a figure who announces that he was born \"sub Iulio\" (i.e. in the time of Julius Caesar) and lived under Augustus: it is the shade of the Roman poet Virgil, author of the \"Aeneid\", a Latin epic.\n\nCanto II\n<br>\nOn the evening of Good Friday, Dante is following Virgil but hesitates; Virgil explains how he has been sent by Beatrice, the symbol of Divine Love. Beatrice had been moved to aid Dante by the Virgin Mary (symbolic of compassion) and Saint Lucia (symbolic of illuminating Grace). Rachel, symbolic of the contemplative life, also appears in the heavenly scene recounted by Virgil. The two of them then begin their journey to the underworld.\n\nCanto III\n<br>\nDante passes through the gate of Hell, which bears an inscription ending with the famous phrase \"\"Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate\"\", most frequently translated as \"Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.\" Dante and his guide hear the anguished screams of the Uncommitted. These are the souls of people who in life took no sides; the opportunists who were for neither good nor evil, but instead were merely concerned with themselves. Among these Dante recognizes a figure implied to be Pope Celestine V, whose \"cowardice (in selfish terror for his own welfare) served as the door through which so much evil entered the Church\". Mixed with them are outcasts who took no side in the Rebellion of Angels. These souls are forever unclassified; they are neither in Hell nor out of it, but reside on the shores of the Acheron. Naked and futile, they race around through the mist in eternal pursuit of an elusive, wavering banner (symbolic of their pursuit of ever-shifting self-interest) while relentlessly chased by swarms of wasps and hornets, who continually sting them. Loathsome maggots and worms at the sinners' feet drink the putrid mixture of blood, pus, and tears that flows down their bodies. This symbolizes the sting of their guilty conscience and the repugnance of sin. This may also be seen as a reflection of the spiritual stagnation in which they lived.\nAfter passing through the vestibule, Dante and Virgil reach the ferry that will take them across the river Acheron and to Hell proper. The ferry is piloted by Charon, who does not want to let Dante enter, for he is a living being. Virgil forces Charon to take him by declaring, \"Vuolsi così colà dove si puote / ciò che si vuole\" (\"It is so willed there where is power to do / That which is willed\"), referring to the fact that Dante is on his journey on divine grounds. The wailing and blasphemy of the damned souls entering Charon's boat contrast with the joyful singing of the blessed souls arriving by ferry in the \"Purgatorio\". The passage across the Acheron, however, is undescribed, since Dante faints and does not awaken until he is on the other side.\n\nCanto IV\n\nVirgil proceeds to guide Dante through the nine circles of Hell. The circles are concentric, representing a gradual increase in wickedness, and culminating at the centre of the earth, where Satan is held in bondage. The sinners of each circle are punished for eternity in a fashion fitting their crimes: each punishment is a \"contrapasso\", a symbolic instance of poetic justice. For example, later in the poem, Dante and Virgil encounter fortune-tellers who must walk forward with their heads on backward, unable to see what is ahead, because they tried to see the future through forbidden means. Such a \"contrapasso\" \"functions not merely as a form of divine revenge, but rather as the fulfilment of a destiny freely chosen by each soul during his or her life\". People who sinned, but prayed for forgiveness before their deaths are found not in Hell but in Purgatory, where they labour to become free of their sins. Those in Hell are people who tried to justify their sins and are unrepentant.\n\nDante's Hell is structurally based on the ideas of Aristotle, but with \"certain Christian symbolisms, exceptions, and misconstructions of Aristotle's text\". Dante's three major categories of sin, as symbolized by the three beasts that Dante encounters in Canto I, are Incontinence, Violence and Bestiality, and Fraud and Malice. Sinners punished for incontinence (also known as wantonness) — the lustful, the gluttonous, the hoarders and wasters, and the wrathful and sullen — all demonstrated weakness in controlling their appetites, desires, and natural urges; according to Aristotle's \"Ethics\", incontinence is less condemnable than malice or bestiality, and therefore these sinners are located in four circles of Upper Hell (Circles 2–5). These sinners endure lesser torments than do those consigned to Lower Hell, located within the walls of the City of Dis, for committing acts of violence and fraud — the latter of which involves, as Dorothy L. Sayers writes, \"abuse of the specifically human faculty of reason\". The deeper levels are organized into one circle for violence (Circle 7) and two circles for fraud (Circles 8 and 9). As a Christian, Dante adds Circle 1 (Limbo) to Upper Hell and Circle 6 (Heresy) to Lower Hell, making 9 Circles in total; incorporating the Vestibule of the Futile, this leads to Hell containing 10 main divisions. This \"9+1=10\" structure is also found within the \"Purgatorio\" and \"Paradiso\". Lower Hell is further subdivided: Circle 7 (Violence) is divided into three rings, Circle 8 (Simple Fraud) is divided into ten \"bolge\", and Circle 9 (Complex Fraud) is divided into four regions. Thus, Hell contains, in total, 24 divisions.\n\nDante wakes up to find that he has crossed the Acheron, and Virgil leads him to the first circle of the abyss, Limbo, where Virgil himself resides. The first circle contains the unbaptized and the virtuous pagans, who, although not sinful, did not accept Christ. Dorothy L. Sayers writes, \"After those who refused choice come those without opportunity of choice. They could not, that is, choose Christ; they could, and did, choose human virtue, and for that they have their reward.\" Limbo shares many characteristics with the Asphodel Meadows; thus, the guiltless damned are punished by living in a deficient form of Heaven. Without baptism (\"the portal of the faith that you embrace\") they lacked the hope for something greater than rational minds can conceive. When Dante asked if anyone has ever left Limbo, Virgil states that he saw Jesus (\"a Mighty One\") descend into Limbo and take Noah, Moses, Abraham, David, and Rachel (see Limbo of the Patriarchs) into his all-forgiving arms and transport them to Heaven as the first human souls to be saved. The event, known as the Harrowing of Hell, would have occurred in A.D. 33 or 34.\n\nDante encounters the poets Homer, Horace, Ovid, and Lucan, who include him in their number and make him \"sixth in that high company\". They reach the base of a great Castle – the dwelling place of the wisest men of antiquity – surrounded by seven gates, and a flowing brook. After passing through the seven gates, the group comes to an exquisite green meadow and Dante encounters the inhabitants of the Citadel. These include figures associated with the Trojans and their descendants (the Romans): Electra (mother of Troy's founder Dardanus), Hector, Aeneas, Julius Caesar in his role as Roman general (\"in his armor, falcon-eyed\"), Camilla, Penthesilea (Queen of the Amazons), King Latinus and his daughter, Lavinia, Lucius Junius Brutus (who overthrew Tarquin to found the Roman Republic), Lucretia, Julia, Marcia, and Cornelia Africana. Dante also views Saladin, a Muslim military leader known for his struggle against the Crusaders as well as his generous, chivalrous, and merciful conduct.\n\nDante next encounters a group of philosophers, including Aristotle with Socrates and Plato at his side, as well as Democritus, \"Diogenes\" (either Diogenes the Cynic or Diogenes of Apollonia), Anaxagoras, Thales, Empedocles, Heraclitus, and \"Zeno\" (either Zeno of Elea or Zeno of Citium). He sees the scientist Dioscorides; the mythical Greek poets Orpheus and Linus; and Roman statesmen Marcus Tullius Cicero and Seneca. Dante sees the Alexandrian geometer Euclid and Ptolemy, the Alexandrian astronomer and geographer, as well as the physicians Hippocrates and Galen. He also encounters Avicenna, a Persian polymath, and Averroes, a medieval Andalusian polymath known for his commentaries on Aristotle's works. Dante and Virgil depart from the four other poets and continue their journey.\n\nAlthough Dante implies that all virtuous non-Christians find themselves here, he later encounters two (Cato of Utica and Statius) in Purgatory and two (Trajan and Ripheus) in Heaven. In \"Purg.\" XXII, Virgil names several additional inhabitants of Limbo who were not mentioned in the \"Inferno.\"\n\nDante and Virgil leave Limbo and enter the Second Circle – the first of the circles of Incontinence – where the punishments of Hell proper begin. It is described as \"a part where no thing gleams\". They find their way hindered by the serpentine Minos, who judges all of those condemned for active, deliberately willed sin to one of the lower circles. Minos sentences each soul to its torment by wrapping his tail around himself a corresponding number of times. Virgil rebukes Minos, and he and Dante continue on.\n\nIn the second circle of Hell are those overcome by lust. These \"carnal malefactors\" are condemned for allowing their appetites to sway their reason. These souls are buffeted back and forth by the terrible winds of a violent storm, without rest. This symbolizes the power of lust to blow needlessly and aimlessly: \"as the lovers drifted into self-indulgence and were carried sway by their passions, so now they drift for ever. The bright, voluptuous sin is now seen as it is – a howling darkness of helpless discomfort.\" Since lust involves mutual indulgence and is not, therefore, completely self-centered, Dante deems it the least heinous of the sins and its punishment is the most benign within Hell proper. The \"ruined slope\" in this circle is thought to be a reference to the earthquake that occurred after the death of Christ.\nIn this circle, Dante sees Semiramis, Dido, Cleopatra, Helen of Troy, Paris, Achilles, Tristan, and many others who were overcome by sexual love during their life. Dante comes across Francesca da Rimini, who married the deformed Giovanni Malatesta (also known as \"Gianciotto\") for political purposes but fell in love with his younger brother Paolo Malatesta; the two began to carry on an adulterous affair. Sometime between 1283 and 1286, Giovanni surprised them together in Francesca's bedroom and violently stabbed them both to death. Francesca explains:\n\n<poem>\nLove, which in gentlest hearts will soonest bloom\nLove, which permits no loved one not to love,\nLove led us to one death. In the depths of Hell\n</poem>\n\nFrancesca further reports that she and Paolo yielded to their love when reading the story of the adultery between Lancelot and Guinevere in the Old French romance \"Lancelot du Lac\". Francesca says, \"Galeotto fu 'l libro e chi lo scrisse\". The word \"Galeotto\" means \"pander\" but is also the Italian term for Gallehaut, who acted as an intermediary between Lancelot and Guinevere, encouraging them on to love. John Ciardi renders line 137 as \"That book, and he who wrote it, was a pander.\" Inspired by Dante, author Giovanni Boccaccio invoked the name \"Prencipe Galeotto\" in the alternative title to \"The Decameron\", a 14th-century collection of novellas. The English poet John Keats, in his sonnet \"On a Dream,\" imagines what Dante does not give us, the point of view of Paolo:\n\n... But to that second circle of sad hell,<br>\nWhere 'mid the gust, the whirlwind, and the flaw<br>\nOf rain and hail-stones, lovers need not tell<br>\nTheir sorrows. Pale were the sweet lips I saw,<br>\nPale were the lips I kiss'd, and fair the form<br>\nI floated with, about that melancholy storm.\nAs he did at the end of Canto III, Dante – overcome by pity and anguish – describes his swoon: \"I fainted, as if I had met my death. / And then I fell as a dead body falls\"\n\nCanto VI\n\nIn the third circle, the gluttonous wallow in a vile, putrid slush produced by a ceaseless, foul, icy rain – \"a great storm of putrefaction\" – as punishment for subjecting their reason to a voracious appetite. Cerberus (described as \"il gran vermo\", literally \"the great worm\", line 22), the monstrous three-headed beast of Hell, ravenously guards the gluttons lying in the freezing mire, mauling and flaying them with his claws as they howl like dogs. Virgil obtains safe passage past the monster by filling its three mouths with mud.\n\nDorothy L. Sayers writes that \"the surrender to sin which began with mutual indulgence leads by an imperceptible degradation to solitary self-indulgence\". The gluttons grovel in the mud by themselves, sightless and heedless of their neighbors, symbolizing the cold, selfish, and empty sensuality of their lives. Just as lust has revealed its true nature in the winds of the previous circle, here the slush reveals the true nature of sensuality – which includes not only overindulgence in food and drink, but also other kinds of addiction.\n\nIn this circle, Dante converses with a Florentine contemporary identified as Ciacco, which means \"hog\". A character with the same nickname later appears in \"The Decameron\" of Giovanni Boccaccio. Ciacco speaks to Dante regarding strife in Florence between the \"White\" and \"Black\" Guelphs, which developed after the Guelph/Ghibelline strife ended with the complete defeat of the Ghibellines. In the first of several political prophecies in the \"Inferno\", Ciacco \"predicts\" the expulsion of the White Guelphs (Dante's party) from Florence by the Black Guelphs, aided by Pope Boniface VIII, which marked the start of Dante's long exile from the city. These events occurred in 1302, prior to when the poem was written but in the future at Easter time of 1300, the time in which the poem is set.\n\nCanto VII\n<br>\nThe Fourth Circle is guarded by a figure Dante names as \"Pluto\": this is Plutus, the deity of wealth in classical mythology. Although the two are often conflated, he is a distinct figure from Pluto (Dis), the classical ruler of the underworld. At the start of Canto VII, he menaces Virgil and Dante with the cryptic phrase \"Papé Satàn, papé Satàn aleppe\", but Virgil protects Dante from him.\n\nThose whose attitude toward material goods deviated from the appropriate mean are punished in the fourth circle. They include the avaricious or miserly (including many \"clergymen, and popes and cardinals\"), who hoarded possessions, and the prodigal, who squandered them. The hoarders and spendthrifts joust, using as weapons great weights that they push with their chests:\n<poem>\nHere, too, I saw a nation of lost souls,\nrolled them at one another. Then in haste\n</poem>\nRelating this sin of incontinence to the two that preceded it (lust and gluttony), Dorothy L. Sayers writes, \"Mutual indulgence has already declined into selfish appetite; now, that appetite becomes aware of the incompatible and equally selfish appetites of other people. Indifference becomes mutual antagonism, imaged here by the antagonism between hoarding and squandering.\" The contrast between these two groups leads Virgil to discourse on the nature of Fortune, who raises nations to greatness and later plunges them into poverty, as she shifts, \"those empty goods from nation unto nation, clan to clan\". This speech fills what would otherwise be a gap in the poem, since both groups are so absorbed in their activity that Virgil tells Dante that it would be pointless to try to speak to them – indeed, they have lost their individuality and been rendered \"unrecognizable\"\n\nIn the swampy, stinking waters of the river Styx – the Fifth Circle – the actively wrathful fight each other viciously on the surface of the slime, while the sullen (the passively wrathful) lie beneath the water, withdrawn, \"into a black sulkiness which can find no joy in God or man or the universe\". At the surface of the foul Stygian marsh, Dorothy L. Sayers writes, \"the active hatreds rend and snarl at one another; at the bottom, the sullen hatreds lie gurgling, unable even to express themselves for the rage that chokes them\". As the last circle of Incontinence, the \"savage self-frustration\" of the Fifth Circle marks the end of \"that which had its tender and romantic beginnings in the dalliance of indulged passion\".\n\nCanto VIII\n<br>\nPhlegyas reluctantly transports Dante and Virgil across the Styx in his skiff. On the way they are accosted by Filippo Argenti, a Black Guelph from the prominent Adimari family. Little is known about Argenti, although Giovanni Boccaccio describes an incident in which he lost his temper; early commentators state that Argenti's brother seized some of Dante's property after his exile from Florence. Just as Argenti enabled the seizing of Dante's property, he himself is \"seized\" by all the other wrathful souls.\n\nWhen Dante responds \"In weeping and in grieving, accursed spirit, may you long remain,\" Virgil blesses him with words used to describe Christ himself (\"Luke\" 11:27). Literally, this reflects the fact that souls in Hell are eternally fixed in the state they have chosen, but allegorically, it reflects Dante's beginning awareness of his own sin.\n\nIn the distance, Dante perceives high towers that resemble fiery red mosques. Virgil informs him that they are approaching the City of Dis. Dis, itself surrounded by the Stygian marsh, contains Lower Hell within its walls. Dis is one of the names of Pluto, the classical king of the underworld, in addition to being the name of the realm. The walls of Dis are guarded by fallen angels. Virgil is unable to convince them to let Dante and him enter, and Dante is threatened by the Furies (consisting of Alecto, Megaera, and Tisiphone) and Medusa.\n\nCanto IX\n<br>An angel sent from Heaven secures entry for the poets, opening the gate by touching it with a wand, and rebukes those who opposed Dante. Allegorically, this reveals the fact that the poem is beginning to deal with sins that philosophy and humanism cannot fully understand. Virgil also mentions to Dante how Erichtho sent him down to the lowest circle of Hell to bring back a spirit from there.\n\nCanto X\n<br>\nIn the sixth circle, heretics, such as Epicurus and his followers (who say \"the soul dies with the body\") are trapped in flaming tombs. Dante holds discourse with a pair of Epicurian Florentines in one of the tombs: Farinata degli Uberti, a famous Ghibelline leader (following the Battle of Montaperti in September 1260, Farinata strongly protested the proposed destruction of Florence at the meeting of the victorious Ghibellines; he died in 1264 and was posthumously condemned for heresy in 1283); and Cavalcante de' Cavalcanti, a Guelph who was the father of Dante's friend and fellow poet, Guido Cavalcanti. The political affiliation of these two men allows for a further discussion of Florentine politics. In response to a question from Dante about the \"prophecy\" he has received, Farinata explains that what the souls in Hell know of life on earth comes from seeing the future, not from any observation of the present. Consequently, when \"the portal of the future has been shut\", it will no longer be possible for them to know anything. Farinata explains that also crammed within the tomb are Emperor Frederick II, commonly reputed to be an Epicurean, and Ottaviano degli Ubaldini, to whom Dante refers to as \"il Cardinale\".\n\nCanto XI\n<br>\nDante reads an inscription on one of the tombs indicating it belongs to Pope Anastasius II – although some modern scholars hold that Dante erred in the verse mentioning Anastasius (\"Anastasio papa guardo, / lo qual trasse Fotin de la via dritta\", lines 8–9), confusing the pope with the Byzantine emperor of the time, Anastasius I. Pausing for a moment before the steep descent to the foul-smelling seventh circle, Virgil explains the geography and rationale of Lower Hell, in which the sins of violence (or bestiality) and fraud (or malice) are punished. In his explanation, Virgil refers to the \"Nicomachean Ethics\" and the \"Physics\" of Aristotle, with medieval interpretations. Virgil asserts that there are only two legitimate sources of wealth: natural resources (\"Nature\") and human labor and activity (\"Art\"). Usury, to be punished in the next circle, is therefore an offence against both; it is a kind of blasphemy, since it is an act of violence against Art, which is the child of Nature, and Nature derives from God.\n\nVirgil then indicates the time through his unexplained awareness of the stars' positions. The \"Wain\", the Great Bear, now lies in the northwest over Caurus (the northwest wind). The constellation Pisces (the Fish) is just appearing over the horizon: it is the zodiacal sign preceding Aries (the Ram). Canto I notes that the sun is in Aries, and since the twelve zodiac signs rise at two-hour intervals, it must now be about two hours prior to sunrise: 4:00 A.M. on Holy Saturday, April 9.\n\nCanto XII\n<br>\nThe Seventh Circle, divided into three rings, houses the Violent. Dante and Virgil descend a jumble of rocks that had once formed a cliff to reach the Seventh Circle from the Sixth Circle, having first to evade the Minotaur (\"L'infamia di Creti\", \"the infamy of Crete\", line 12); at the sight of them, the Minotaur gnaws his flesh. Virgil assures the monster that Dante is not its hated enemy, Theseus. This causes the Minotaur to charge them as Dante and Virgil swiftly enter the seventh circle. Virgil explains the presence of shattered stones around them: they resulted from the great earthquake that shook the earth at the moment of Christ's death (Matt. 27:51), at the time of the Harrowing of Hell. Ruins resulting from the same shock were previously seen at the beginning of Upper Hell (the entrance of the Second Circle, Canto V).\nCanto XIII\n\nCanto XIV\n\n\nCanto XV\n<br>\nProtected by the powers of the boiling rivulet, Dante and Virgil progress across the burning plain. They pass a roving group of Sodomites, and Dante, to his surprise, recognizes Brunetto Latini. Dante addresses Brunetto with deep and sorrowful affection, \"paying him the highest tribute offered to any sinner in the \"Inferno\"\", thus refuting suggestions that Dante only placed his enemies in Hell. Dante has great respect for Brunetto and feels spiritual indebtedness to him and his works (\"you taught me how man makes himself eternal; / and while I live, my gratitude for that / must always be apparent in my words\"), Brunetto prophesies Dante's bad treatment by the Florentines. He also identifies other sodomites, including Priscian, Francesco d'Accorso, and Bishop Andrea de' Mozzi.\nCanto XVI\n\nThe Poets begin to hear the waterfall that plunges over the Great Cliff into the Eighth Circle when three shades break from their company and greet them. They are Iacopo Rusticucci, Guido Guerra, and Tegghiaio Aldobrandi – all Florentines much admired by Dante. Rusticucci blames his \"savage wife\" for his torments. The sinners ask for news of Florence, and Dante laments the current state of the city. At the top of the falls, at Virgil's order, Dante removes a cord from about his waist and Virgil drops it over the edge; as if in answer, a large, distorted shape swims up through the filthy air of the abyss.\n\nCanto XVII\n<br>\nThe creature is Geryon, the Monster of Fraud; Virgil announces that they must fly down from the cliff on the monster's back. Dante goes alone to examine the Usurers: he does not recognize them, but each has a heraldic device emblazoned on a leather purse around his neck (\"On these their streaming eyes appeared to feast\"). The coats of arms indicate that they came from prominent Florentine families; they indicate the presence of Catello di Rosso Gianfigliazzi, Ciappo Ubriachi, the Paduan Reginaldo degli Scrovegni (who predicts that his fellow Paduan Vitaliano di Iacopo Vitaliani will join him here), and Giovanni di Buiamonte. Dante then rejoins Virgil and, both mounted atop Geryon's back, the two begin their descent from the great cliff in the Eighth Circle: the Hell of the Fraudulent and Malicious.\n\nGeryon, the winged monster who allows Dante and Virgil to descend a vast cliff to reach the Eighth Circle, was traditionally represented as a giant with three heads and three conjoined bodies. Dante's Geryon, meanwhile, is an image of fraud, combining human, bestial, and reptilian elements: Geryon is a \"monster with the general shape of a wyvern but with the tail of a scorpion, hairy arms, a gaudily-marked reptilian body, and the face of a just and honest man\". The pleasant human face on this grotesque body evokes the insincere fraudster whose intentions \"behind the face\" are all monstrous, cold-blooded, and stinging with poison.\n\nCanto XVIII\n<br>\nDante now finds himself in the Eighth Circle, called Malebolge (\"Evil ditches\"): the upper half of the Hell of the Fraudulent and Malicious. The Eighth Circle is a large funnel of stone shaped like an amphitheatre around which run a series of ten deep, narrow, concentric ditches or trenches called \"bolge\" (singular: \"bolgia\"). Within these ditches are punished those guilty of Simple Fraud. From the foot of the Great Cliff to the Well (which forms the neck of the funnel) are large spurs of rock, like umbrella ribs or spokes, which serve as bridges over the ten ditches. Dorothy L. Sayers writes that the Malebolge is, \"the image of the City in corruption: the progressive disintegration of every social relationship, personal and public. Sexuality, ecclesiastical and civil office, language, ownership, counsel, authority, psychic influence, and material interdependence – all the media of the community's interchange are perverted and falsified\".\nCanto XIX\n\nCanto XX\n\nCanto XXI\n\n\nCanto XXII\n<br>One of the grafters, an unidentified Navarrese (identified by early commentators as Ciampolo) is seized by the demons, and Virgil questions him. The sinner speaks of his fellow grafters, Friar Gomita (a corrupt friar in Gallura eventually hanged by Nino Visconti (see \"Purg.\" VIII) for accepting bribes to let prisoners escape) and Michel Zanche (a corrupt Vicar of Logodoro under King Enzo of Sardinia). He offers to lure some of his fellow sufferers into the hands of the demons, and when his plan is accepted he escapes back into the pitch. Alichino and Calcabrina start a brawl in mid-air and fall into the pitch themselves, and Barbariccia organizes a rescue party. Dante and Virgil take advantage of the confusion to slip away.\n\nCanto XXIII\n\nCanto XXIV\n\n\nCanto XXV\n<br>Vanni hurls an obscenity at God and the serpents swarm over him. The centaur Cacus arrives to punish the wretch; he has a fire-breathing dragon on his shoulders and snakes covering his equine back. (In Roman mythology, Cacus, the monstrous, fire-breathing son of Vulcan, was killed by Hercules for raiding the hero's cattle; in \"Aeneid\" VIII, 193–267, Virgil did not describe him as a centaur). Dante then meets five noble thieves of Florence and observes their various transformations. Agnello Brunelleschi, in human form, is merged with the six-legged serpent that is Cianfa Donati. A figure named Buoso (perhaps either Buoso degli Abati or Buoso Donati, the latter of whom is mentioned in \"Inf.\" XXX.44) first appears as a man, but exchanges forms with Francesco de' Cavalcanti, who bites Buoso in the form of a four-footed serpent. Puccio Sciancato remains unchanged for the time being.\nCanto XXVI\n\n<poem>\n'Brothers,' I said, 'o you, who having crossed \nunto your senses, you must not deny \nConsider well the seed that gave you birth: \n</poem>\n\nCanto XXVII\n<br>Dante is approached by Guido da Montefeltro, head of the Ghibellines of Romagna, asking for news of his country. Dante replies with a tragic summary of the current state of the cities of Romagna. Guido then recounts his life: he advised Pope Boniface VIII to offer a false amnesty to the Colonna family, who, in 1297, had walled themselves inside the castle of Palestrina in the Lateran. When the Colonna accepted the terms and left the castle, the Pope razed it to the ground and left them without a refuge. Guido describes how St. Francis, founder of the Franciscan order, came to take his soul to Heaven, only to have a devil assert prior claim. Although Boniface had absolved Guido in advance for his evil advice, the devil points out the invalidity: absolution requires contrition, and a man cannot be contrite for a sin at the same time that he is intending to commit it\n\nCanto XXVIII\n\n\nCanto XXIX\n\nCanto XXX\n<br>\nSuddenly, two spirits – Gianni Schicchi de' Cavalcanti and Myrrha, both punished as Imposters (Falsifiers of Persons) – run rabid through the pit. Schicchi sinks his tusks into Capocchio's neck and drags him away like prey. Griffolino explains how Myrrha disguised herself to commit incest with her father King Cinyras, while Schicchi impersonated the dead Buoso Donati to dictate a will giving himself several profitable bequests. Dante then encounters Master Adam of Brescia, one of the Counterfeiters (Falsifiers of Money): for manufacturing Florentine florins of twenty-one (rather than twenty-four) carat gold, he was burned at the stake in 1281. He is punished by a loathsome dropsy-like disease, which gives him a bloated stomach, prevents him from moving, and an eternal, unbearable thirst. Master Adam points out two sinners of the fourth class, the Perjurers (Falsifiers of Words). These are Potiphar's wife (punished for her false accusation of Joseph, \"Gen\". 39:7–19) and Sinon, the Achaean spy who lied to the Trojans to convince them to take the Trojan Horse into their city (\"Aeneid\" II, 57–194); Sinon is here rather than in \"Bolgia\" 8 because his advice was false as well as evil. Both suffer from a burning fever. Master Adam and Sinon exchange abuse, which Dante watches until he is rebuked by Virgil. As a result of his shame and repentance, Dante is forgiven by his guide. Sayers remarks that the descent through Malebolge \"began with the sale of the sexual relationship, and went on to the sale of Church and State; now, the very money is itself corrupted, every affirmation has become perjury, and every identity a lie\" so that every aspect of social interaction has been progressively destroyed.\n\nCanto XXXI\n\nDante and Virgil approach the Central Well, at the bottom of which lies the Ninth and final Circle of Hell. The classical and biblical Giants – who perhaps symbolize pride and other spiritual flaws lying behind acts of treachery – stand perpetual guard inside the well-pit, their legs embedded in the banks of the Ninth Circle while their upper halves rise above the rim and can be visible from the Malebolge. Dante initially mistakes them for great towers of a city. Among the Giants, Virgil identifies Nimrod (who tried to build the Tower of Babel; he shouts out the unintelligible \"Raphèl mai amècche zabì almi\"); Ephialtes (who with his brother Otus tried to storm Olympus during the Gigantomachy; he has his arms chained up) and Briareus (who Dante claimed to have challenged the Gods); and Tityos and Typhon, who insulted Jupiter. Also here is the Giant Antaeus, who did not join in the rebellion against the Olympian Gods and therefore is not chained. At Virgil's persuasion, Antaeus takes the Poets in his large palm and lowers them gently to the final level of Hell.\n\nCanto XXXII\n<br>\nAt the base of the well, Dante finds himself within a large frozen lake: Cocytus, the Ninth Circle of Hell. Trapped in the ice, each according to his guilt, are punished sinners guilty of treachery against those with whom they had special relationships. The lake of ice is divided into four concentric rings (or \"rounds\") of traitors corresponding, in order of seriousness, to betrayal of family ties, betrayal of community ties, betrayal of guests, and betrayal of lords. This is in contrast to the popular image of Hell as fiery; as Ciardi writes, \"The treacheries of these souls were denials of love (which is God) and of all human warmth. Only the remorseless dead center of the ice will serve to express their natures. As they denied God's love, so are they furthest removed from the light and warmth of His Sun. As they denied all human ties, so are they bound only by the unyielding ice.\" This final, deepest level of hell is reserved for traitors, betrayers and oathbreakers (its most famous inmate is Judas Iscariot).\n\n\nCanto XXXIII\n\nThe gnawing sinner tells his story: he is Count Ugolino, and the head he gnaws belongs to Archbishop Ruggieri. In \"the most pathetic and dramatic passage of the \"Inferno\"\", Ugolino describes how he conspired with Ruggieri in 1288 to oust his nephew and take control over the Guelphs of Pisa. However, as soon as Nino was gone, the Archbishop, sensing the Guelphs' weakened position, turned on Ugolino and imprisoned him with his sons and grandsons in the Torre dei Gualandi. In March 1289, the Archbishop condemned the prisoners to death by starvation in the tower.\n\nCanto XXXIV\n\n\nIn the very centre of Hell, condemned for committing the ultimate sin (personal treachery against God), is the Devil, referred to by Virgil as Dis (the Roman god of the underworld; the name \"Dis\" was often used for Pluto in antiquity, such as in Virgil's \"Aeneid\"). The arch-traitor, Lucifer was once held by God to be fairest of the angels before his pride led him to rebel against God, resulting in his expulsion from Heaven. Lucifer is a giant, terrifying beast trapped waist-deep in the ice, fixed and suffering. He has three faces, each a different color: one red (the middle), one a pale yellow (the right), and one black (the left):\n\n<poem>\n... he had three faces: one in front bloodred;\nand then another two that, just above\nthe right looked somewhat yellow, somewhat white;\n</poem>\n\nDorothy L. Sayers notes that Satan's three faces are thought by some to suggest his control over the three human races: red for the Europeans (from Japheth), yellow for the Asiatic (from Shem), and black for the African (the race of Ham). All interpretations recognize that the three faces represent a fundamental perversion of the Trinity: Satan is impotent, ignorant, and full of hate, in contrast to the all-powerful, all-knowing, and all-loving nature of God. Lucifer retains his six wings (he originally belonged to the angelic order of Seraphim, described in \"Isaiah\" 6:2), but these are now dark, bat-like, and futile: the icy wind that emanates from the beating of Lucifer's wings only further ensures his own imprisonment in the frozen lake. He weeps from his six eyes, and his tears mix with bloody froth and pus as they pour down his three chins. Each face has a mouth that chews eternally on a prominent traitor. Marcus Junius Brutus and Gaius Cassius Longinus dangle with their feet in the left and right mouths, respectively, for their involvement in the assassination of Julius Caesar (March 15, 44 BC) – an act which, to Dante, represented the destruction of a unified Italy and the killing of the man who was divinely appointed to govern the world. In the central, most vicious mouth is Judas Iscariot, the apostle who betrayed Christ. Judas is receiving the most horrifying torture of the three traitors: his head is gnawed inside Lucifer's mouth while his back is forever flayed and shredded by Lucifer's claws. According to Dorothy L. Sayers, \"just as Judas figures treason against God, so Brutus and Cassius figure treason against Man-in-Society; or we may say that we have here the images of treason against the Divine and the Secular government of the world\".\n\nAt about 6:00 p.m. on Saturday evening, Virgil and Dante begin their escape from Hell by clambering down Satan's ragged fur, feet-first. When they reach Satan's genitalia, the poets pass through the center of the universe and of gravity from the Northern Hemisphere of land to the Southern Hemisphere of water. When Virgil changes direction and begins to climb \"upward\" towards the surface of the Earth at the antipodes, Dante, in his confusion, initially believes they are returning to Hell. Virgil indicates that the time is halfway between the canonical hours of Prime (6 a.m.) and Terce (9 a.m.) – that is, 7:30 a.m. of the same Holy Saturday which was just about to end. Dante is confused as to how, after about an hour and a half of climbing, it is now apparently morning. Virgil explains that as a result of passing through the Earth's center into the Southern Hemisphere, which is twelve hours ahead of Jerusalem, the central city of the Northern Hemisphere (where, therefore, it is currently 7:30 p.m.).\n\nVirgil goes on to explain how the Southern Hemisphere was once covered with dry land, but the land recoiled in horror to the north when Lucifer fell from Heaven and was replaced by the ocean. Meanwhile, the inner rock Lucifer displaced as he plunged into the center of the earth rushed upwards to the surface of the Southern Hemisphere to avoid contact with him, forming the Mountain of Purgatory. This mountain – the only land mass in the waters of the Southern Hemisphere – rises above the surface at a point directly opposite Jerusalem. The poets then ascend a narrow chasm of rock through the \"space contained between the floor formed by the convex side of Cocytus and the underside of the earth above,\" moving in opposition to Lethe, the river of oblivion, which flows down from the summit of Mount Purgatory. The poets finally emerge a little before dawn on the morning of Easter Sunday (April 10, 1300 A.D.) beneath a sky studded with stars.\n\n\n\n"}

During a typical jazz meditation performance, a meditation guide or teacher is accompanied by one or more musicians, and musical improvisation is used as an anchor for mindfulness techniques such as visualization and breathing exercises. An audience of seated participants meditate in response to live music and the teacher's spoken instructions.\n\nSince the mid-20th Century, there has been an evolving relationship between jazz musicians and Buddhist meditative practices. From the emergence of the Beat Generation artists in the post World War II era United States, through the counter-culture 1960s and New Age and experimental aesthetics of the late 20th Century, musicians have found rich inspiration as well as discipline in many of the same concepts that are fundamental to Buddhist practices.\n\nMeditation concepts that have been integrated into jazz theory and performance include: being in the present moment; concentration; following the mind; following the breath; returning to the anchor concept of focus; placing priority on the action in the present, not in a theory. Particular Buddhist teachings such as esoteric ideas of non-verbal deep insight and communication, and the benefits of chanting (rhythmic repetition of sound) - have strong analogues in jazz performance.\n\nSeveral late 20th Century and contemporary jazz musicians have acknowledged drawing inspiration from meditation and Buddhist practices, including John Coltrane, John McLaughlin, Don Cherry, Wayne Shorter, Yusef Lateef, Sonny Rollins, and Herbie Hancock.\n\n\"\"When [John Coltrane] created A Love Supreme. He had meditated that week. I almost didn't see him downstairs. And it was so quiet! There was no sound, no practice! He was up there meditating, and when he came down he said, \"I have a whole new music!\" He said, \"There is a new recording that I will do, I have it all, everything.\" And it was so beautiful! He was like Moses coming down from the mountain. And when he recorded it, he knew everything, everything. He said this was the first time that he had all the music in his head at once to record.\" - Alice Coltrane\"\n\nSeveral academic institutions offer courses and degree programs linking contemplative practice with jazz, including the Berklee School of Music and the University of Michigan School of Music, Theatre & Dance.\nVerve Records' compilation album \"Jazz for Meditation\" was released in the UK in 2007. \nJazz meditation as a live music program originated at the Shinnyo Center for Meditation and Well-being in New York City and at the Mass Bliss Arts and Awareness Festival in the Berkshires.\nSince 2015, the Festival Jazz à Saint-Germain-des-Prés Paris has been proposing \"Jazz & Meditation\" sessions with a therapist specialized in MBSR (Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction), Elisabeth Petit-Lizop, and the Festival artistic director Frédéric Charbaut.\n\n"}

The belief is based on the idea that people and their thoughts are both made from pure energy, and that through the process of like energy attracting like energy a person can improve their own health, wealth, and personal relationships.\n\nThe Law of Attraction is among the most popular of the Universal Laws. Advocates of this mind-power paradigm generally combine cognitive reframing techniques with affirmations and creative visualization to replace limiting or self-destructive (\"negative\") thoughts with more empowered, adaptive (\"positive\") thoughts. A key component of the philosophy is that in order to effectively change one's negative thinking patterns, one must also \"feel\" (through creative visualization) that the desired changes have already occurred. This combination of positive thought and positive emotion is believed to allow one to attract positive experiences and opportunities by achieving resonance with the proposed energetic law.\n\nThe Law of Attraction has no scientific basis and has been dubbed a pseudoscience. A number of researchers have criticized the misuse of scientific concepts by its proponents.\n\nThe New Thought movement (Law of Attraction Origins) grew out of the teachings of Phineas Quimby in the early 19th century. Early in his life, Quimby was diagnosed with tuberculosis. However, medicinal treatment wasn't working, so he began carriage riding through his hometown, Lebanon, New Hampshire. He then regained his health and recovered, an event that prompted his study of \"mind over body\". Although he never used the words 'Law of Attraction', he explained this in a statement that captured the concept in the field of health: \n\nIn 1877, the term 'Law of Attraction' appeared in print for the first time in a book written by the Russian occultist Helena Blavatsky, in a context alluding to an attractive power existing between elements of spirit. (Her book \"Isis Unveiled\" discusses esoteric mysteries of ancient theosophy.)\n\nBut the one who really first articulated the Law as general principle was Prentice Mulford. Mulford, a pivotal figure in the development of New Thought thinking, discusses the Law of Attraction at length in, for example, his essay \"The Law of Success\", published 1886-1887. In this, Mulford was followed by other New Thought authors, such as Henry Wood (starting with his \"God’s Image in Man\", 1892), and Ralph Waldo Trine (starting with his first book, \"What All the World's A-Seeking\", 1896). For these authors, the Law of Attraction is concerned not only about health but every aspect of life.\n\nThe 20th century saw a surge in interest in the subject with many books being written about it, amongst which are two of the best-selling books of all time; Think and Grow Rich (1937) by Napoleon Hill and You Can Heal Your Life (1984) by Louise Hay.\n\nEven if the New Age movement adopted many New Thought ideas, including that of the Law of Attraction, the Law of Attraction remains a new thought philosophical concept.\n\nIn 2006, the concept of the Law of Attraction gained a lot of renewed exposure with the release of the film \"The Secret\" (2006) which was then developed into a book of the same title in 2007. The movie and book gained widespread media coverage. Rhonda Byrne's book also has influenced the creation of an untitled fiction film based on The Secret, starring Katie Holmes. This was followed by a sequel, The Power in 2010 that talks about the law of attraction being the law of love.\n\nNew Thought authors believe that the Law of Attraction is always in operation and that it brings to each person the conditions and experiences that they predominantly think about, or which they desire or expect.\n\nCharles Haanel wrote in \"The Master Key System\" (1912):\nRalph Trine wrote in \"In Tune With The Infinite\" (1897):\n\nThe New Thought concept of the Law of Attraction is rooted in ideas that come from various philosophical and religious traditions. In particular, it has been inspired by Hermeticism, New England transcendentalism, specific verses from the Bible, and Hinduism, \nHermeticism influenced the development of European thought in the Renaissance. Its ideas were transmitted partly through alchemy. In the 18th century, Franz Mesmer studied the works of alchemists such as Paracelsus and van Helmont. Van Helmont was a 17th-century Flemish physician who proclaimed the curative powers of the imagination. This lead Mesmer to develop his ideas about Animal magnetism which Phineas Quimby, the founder of New Thought, studied.\n\nThe Transcendentalist movement developed in the United States immediately before the emergence of New Thought and is thought to have had a great influence on it. George Ripley, an important figure in that movement, stated that its leading idea was \"the supremacy of mind over matter\".\n\nNew Thought authors often quote certain verses from the Bible in the context of the Law of Attraction. An example is Mark 11:24: \"Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.\"\n\nIn the late 19th century Swami Vivekananda traveled to the United States and gave lectures on Hinduism. These talks greatly influenced the New Thought movement and in particular, William Walker Atkinson who was one of New Thought's pioneers.\n\n\"Skeptical Inquirer\" magazine criticized the lack of falsifiability and testability of these claims. Critics have asserted that the evidence provided is usually anecdotal and that, because of the self-selecting nature of the positive reports, as well as the subjective nature of any results, these reports are susceptible to confirmation bias and selection bias. Physicist Ali Alousi, for instance, criticized it as unmeasurable and questioned the likelihood that thoughts can affect anything outside the head.\n\nThe Law of Attraction has been popularized in the early 21st century by books and films such as \"The Secret\". This 2006 film and the subsequent book use interviews with New Thought authors and speakers to explain the principles of the proposed metaphysical law that one can attract anything that one thinks about consistently. Writing for the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, Mary Carmichael and Ben Radford wrote that \"neither the film nor the book has any basis in scientific reality\", and that its premise contains \"an ugly flipside: if you have an accident or disease, it's your fault\".\n\nOthers have questioned the references to modern scientific theory, and have maintained, for example, that the Law of Attraction misrepresents the electrical activity of brainwaves. Victor Stenger and Leon Lederman are critical of attempts to use quantum mysticism to bridge any unexplained or seemingly implausible effects, believing these to be traits of modern pseudoscience.\n\n\n\n"}

The lovelock was a long lock of hair, often plaited (braided) and made to rest over the left shoulder (the heart side) to show devotion to a loved one.\n\nRobin Bryer, author of \"The History of Hair: Fashion and Fantasy Down the Ages\" (2003), speculates that the lovelock may have originated as an alternative to the love token worn by knights during the medieval period.\n\nJames I of England wore a lovelock, and at the court of his son, Charles I many courtiers (including women) wore them in the French fashion (where they were called \"denette\"). Charles I can be seen wearing one in the \"Triple portrait\" by Antony Van Dyck.\n\nWilliam Prynne, a puritan pamphleteer, wrote \"Health's Sickness. The Unloveliness of Lovelocks\" (1628), in which he states that for men to wear their hair long was \"unseemly and unlawful unto Christians\", while it was \"mannish, unnatural, impudent, and unchristian\" for women to cut it short. He related the story of a nobleman who was dangerously ill, and who, on his recovery, \"declared publicly his detestation of his effeminate, fantastic lovelock, which he then sensibly perceived to be but a cord of vanity, by which he had given the Devil holdfast to lead him at his pleasure, and who would never resign his prey as long as he nourished this unlovely bush\", and so he ordered the barber to cut it off. Thomas Hall wrote a pamphlet \"The Loathsomnesse of Long Haire. ...\" (1654) in which he also attacked the fashion. These different views on fashion are in part reflected in the uncomplimentary nicknames the two sides gave each other during the English Civil War: the Royalists called their enemies Roundheads while the Parliamentarians called the Royalists Cavaliers.\n\n"}

Taylor (born 13 December 1945) is a philosopher of religion and cultural critic who has published more than twenty books on theology, philosophy, art and architecture, media, technology, economics, and the natural sciences. After graduating from Wesleyan University in 1968, he received his doctorate in the study of religion from Harvard University and began teaching at Williams College in 1973. In 2007, Taylor moved from Williams College to Columbia University, where he chaired the Department of Religion until 2015.\n\nTaylor's first book, \"Kierkegaard’s Pseudonymous Authorship: A Study of Time and the Self\" was published by Princeton University Press in 1975. This was followed in 1980 by the work for which Taylor received his Doctorgrad, \"Journeys to Selfhood: Hegel and Kierkegaard\" (University of California Press; reissued by Fordham University Press in 2000). Taylor's early study of Kierkegaard and Hegel forms the foundation for all his subsequent work.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Taylor began exploring the texts of Jacques Derrida and his most important followers. \"Erring: A Postmodern A/Theology\" (University of Chicago Press, 1984) was one of the earliest attempts to study religion from the standpoint of poststructuralist philosophy and was followed by two closely related works, the sourcebook \"Deconstruction in Context: Literature and Philosophy\" (Chicago,1986) and \"Altarity\" (Chicago, 1987). In 1989, Taylor founded the Religion and Postmodernism series at the University of Chicago Press as a forum for translations and new scholarship. \nDuring the late 1980s, Taylor was drawn into debates about architecture and the visual arts, and in 1992 published a theological study of religious twentieth-century visual arts, \"Disfiguring: Art, Architecture and Religion\". In later essays and books, Taylor considers a broad range of artists: Mark Tansey, Michael Heizer, Richard Serra, Fred Sandback, Ann Hamilton, Joseph Beuys and others. His extensive work on architecture includes essays on Peter Eisenman, Bernard Tschumi, Daniel Liebeskind, Robert Venturi, Frank Gehry, and Frank Lloyd Wright.\n\nWhile writing on the visual arts, Taylor became interested in media and new information technologies. In 1992 he and Esa Saarinen, a Finnish philosopher, taught the first global seminar using teleconferencing technology. Their book, \"Imagologies: Media Philosophy\" (Routledge, 1994) grew out of this seminar. The book's unusual design in turn inspired the Finnish design company, Marimekko, to develop a product line derived from pages of the book. Taylor’s subsequent book, \"Hiding\" (Chicago, 1997), extended the use of graphic design to create hypertextual effects within the limits of a conventional bound book. As a companion to \"Hiding\", Taylor and José Marquez issued a CD-ROM video game entitled \"The Réal – Las Vegas, Nevada\".\n\nWhile Taylor was exploring art and new media, he extended his experiments with technology in the classroom. In 1993, he was awarded the Rector’s Medal by the University of Helsinki and in 1995 the Carnegie Foundation named him the national Professor of the Year for his innovative teaching. In 1998, Taylor and New York investment banker Herbert Allen, Jr., founded Global Education Network, whose mission was to provide high-quality, low-cost online education in the liberal arts, humanities, and sciences.\n\nTaylor’s work with technology led to a growing interest in the expanding fields of network theory and scientific studies of complex adaptive systems. In a series of books--\"The Picture in Question: Mark Tansey and the Ends of Representation\" (Chicago, 1999), \"The Moment of Complexity\" (Chicago, 2001), and \"Confidence Games: Money and Markets in a World Without Redemption\" (Chicago, 2004)--Taylor deploys complexity theory to explore a range of social, cultural and economic developments.\n\nTaylor’s interest in the visual arts and graphic design has led to his own artistic experiments. In \"Grave Matters\" (Reaktion, 2002), Taylor and Dietrich Christian Lammerts collaborated on a book featuring Lammerts's photographs of the graves of one hundred and fifty modern writers, theologians, philosophers, artists and architects. In 2003, Taylor expanded this project beyond the format of the book to create an exhibition at the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, which included not only the photographs but also sculpture and video art. In 2006, Taylor published \"Mystic Bones\", featuring forty of Taylor's own photographs of deer, cattle and elk bones, accompanied by aphorisms and an essay, \"Rubbings of Reality,\" on the place of deserts in the imagination. More recently, Taylor has been creating a complex work of art entitled \"NeXus,\" which includes land art, and stone, bone, and steel sculptures. In the summer of 2016 he co-curated an exhibition at the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute in Williamstown, MA entitled \"Sensing Place: Reflections on Stone Hill.\" NeXus was part of this exhibition. His book Recovering Place: Reflections on Stone Hill (Columbia University Press, 2014) was the catalog for this show. \n\nTaylor's work attempts to give sustained attention to the theological, philosophical, and artistic issues that were framed in Europe in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Taylor's \"After God\", published in the fall of 2007 (University of Chicago Press), weaves together the many strands of his oeuvre.\n\nTaylor's additional books include: Refiguring the Real: In Conversation with William Gaddis, Richard Powers, Mark Danielewski, and Don Dillo (Columbia University Press, 2013), Refiguring the Spiritual: Beuys, Barney, Turrell, Goldsworthy (Columbia University Press, 2012), Speed Limits: Where Time Went And Why We Have So Little Left (Yale, 2014), Last Works: Lessons in Leaving (Yale, 2018), and Abiding Grace: Time, Modernity, Death (University of Chicago Press, 2018)\nOn August 31, 2010, Taylor published \"Crisis on Campus: A Bold Plan for Reforming Our Colleges and Universities\" (Knopf, ), in which he identified and analyzed major problems facing higher education.\nIn addition to his own writing, Taylor has been involved in a number of editorial projects. In the late 1970s, he chaired the Research and Publications Committee of the American Academy of Religion, which initiated a series of major publishing programs. The Religion and Postmodernism book series he founded continues at the University of Chicago Press under the editorship of Thomas A. Carlson. Taylor has also edited a textbook, \"Critical Terms for the Study of Religion\" (Chicago, 1998), designed for college courses on method in religious studies.\n\nTaylor achieved notoriety outside academe in 2009 with an NYT op-ed piece entitled \"End the University As We Know It\" (Apr. 27), in which he advocated the end of tenure and academic departments. He followed it up quickly with a book in which he expanded on his reform, \"Crisis on Campus: A Bold Plan for Reforming Our Colleges and Universities\" (Knopf, 2010). Critics accused Taylor of hypocrisy, writing as a tenured Columbia professor drawing annual salary and benefits estimated at over $200,000, and charged him, after a career spent in elite private colleges, of being out of touch with the work loads and pay packets of faculty at non-elite institutions. Reviewer David Bell wrote of Taylor's book, \"Its logic is fragile and its evidence is thin,\" and called it \"unbelievably misguided,\" mocking Taylor's \"enraptured\" invocation of interdisciplinarity and conflation of \"forms of communication and forms of knowledge.\"\n\nTaylor began teaching at Williams College in 1973, attained Preston S. Parish Third Century Professor of Humanities in the mid-1980s, and at the time of his departure in 2007 was Cluett Professor of Humanities. He has also held visiting appointments at Harvard University, Smith College, University of North Carolina, and University of Sydney. After being a visiting professor of religion and architecture at Columbia University, he joined the faculty there full-time in 2007 as chair of the religion department.\n\nMark Taylor was a close friend of Jacques Derrida. When Derrida died on October 8, 2004, the \"New York Times\" published a highly critical obituary of the philosopher. Taylor felt that the obituary was not an accurate reflection of Derrida, and proceeded to write another obituary, which the \"Times\" published a few days later.\n\nAdditional biographical source: Mark C.

{"id": "5317064", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5317064", "title": "Marx's theory of human nature", "text": "Marx's theory of human nature\n\nSome Marxists posit what they deem to be Karl Marx's theory of human nature, which they accord an important place in his critique of capitalism, his conception of communism, and his 'materialist conception of history'. Marx, however, does not refer to human nature as such, but to \"Gattungswesen\", which is generally translated as 'species-being' or 'species-essence'. According to a note from the young Marx in the \"Manuscripts of 1844\", the term is derived from Ludwig Feuerbach’s philosophy, in which it refers both to the nature of each human and of humanity as a whole.\n\nHowever, in the sixth \"Theses on Feuerbach\" (1845), Marx criticizes the traditional conception of human nature as a species which incarnates itself in each individual, instead arguing that the conception of human nature is formed by the totality of social relations. Thus, the whole of human nature is not understood, as in classical idealist philosophy, as permanent and universal: the \"species-being\" is always determined in a specific social and historical formation, with some aspects being biological.\n\nThe sixth of the \"Theses on Feuerbach\", written in 1845, provided an early discussion by Marx of the concept of human nature. It states:\n\n\"Feuerbach resolves the essence of religion into the essence of man [\"menschliches Wesen\" = ‘human nature’]. But the essence of man is no abstraction inherent in each single individual. In reality, it is the ensemble of the social relations. Feuerbach, who does not enter upon a criticism of this real essence is hence obliged\": \n\nThus, Marx appears to say that human nature is no more than what is made by the 'social relations'. Norman Geras's \"Marx and Human Nature\" (1983), however, offers an argument against this position. In outline, Geras shows that, while the social relations are held to 'determine' the nature of people, they are not the only such determinant. However, Marx makes statements where he specifically refers to a human nature which is more than what is conditioned by the circumstances of one's life. In \"Capital\", in a footnote critiquing utilitarianism, he says that utilitarians must reckon with 'human nature in general, and then with human nature as modified in each historical epoch'. Marx is arguing against an abstract conception of human nature, offering instead an account rooted in sensuous life. While he is quite explicit that '[a]s individuals express their life, so they are. Hence what individuals are depends on the material conditions of their production', he also believes that human nature will condition (against the background of the productive forces and relations of production) the way in which individuals express their life. History involves 'a continuous transformation of human nature', though this does not mean that every aspect of human nature is wholly variable; what is transformed need not be wholly transformed.\n\nMarx did criticise the tendency to 'transform into eternal laws of nature and of reason, the social forms springing from your present mode of production and form of property'. For this reason, he would likely have wanted to criticise certain \"aspects\" of some accounts of human nature. Some people believe, for example, that humans are naturally selfish - Immanuel Kant and Thomas Hobbes, for example. (Both Hobbes and Kant thought that it was necessary to constrain our human nature in order to achieve a good society - Kant thought we should use rationality, Hobbes thought we should use the force of the state - Marx, as we shall see, thought that the good society was one which allows our human nature its full expression.) Most Marxists will argue that this view is an ideological illusion and the effect of commodity fetishism: the fact that people act selfishly is held to be a product of scarcity and capitalism, not an immutable human characteristic. For confirmation of this view, we can see how, in \"The Holy Family\" Marx argues that capitalists are not motivated by any essential viciousness, but by the drive toward the bare 'semblance of a human existence'. (Marx says 'semblance' because he believes that capitalists are as alienated from their human nature under capitalism as the proletariat, even though their basic needs are better met.)\n\nIn the \"1844 Manuscripts\" the young Marx wrote:\n\nIn the \"Grundrisse\" Marx says his nature is a 'totality of needs and drives'. In \"The German Ideology\" he uses the formulation: 'their \"needs\", consequently their nature'. We can see then, that from Marx's early writing to his later work, he conceives of human nature as composed of 'tendencies', 'drives', 'essential powers', and 'instincts' to act in order to satisfy 'needs' for external objectives. For Marx then, an explanation of human nature is an explanation of the needs of humans, together with the assertion that they will act to fulfill those needs. (c.f. \"The German Ideology\", chapter 3). Norman Geras gives a schedule of some of the needs which Marx says are characteristic of humans:\n\n\"...for other human beings, for sexual relations, for food, water, clothing, shelter, rest and, more generally, for circumstances that are conducive to health rather than disease. There is another one ... the need of people for a breadth and diversity of pursuit and hence of personal development, as Marx himself expresses these, 'all-round activity', 'all-round development of individuals', 'free development of individuals', 'the means of cultivating [one's] gifts in all directions', and so on.\" \n\nMarx says 'It is true that eating, drinking, and procreating, etc., are ... genuine human functions. However, when abstracted from other aspects of human activity, and turned into final and exclusive ends, they are animal.'\n\nIn several passages throughout his work, Marx shows how he believes humans to be essentially different from other animals. 'Men can be distinguished from animals by consciousness, by religion or anything else you like. They themselves begin to distinguish themselves from animals as soon as they begin to produce their means of subsistence, a step which is conditioned by their physical organisation.' In this passage from \"The German Ideology\", Marx alludes to one difference: that humans produce their physical environments. But do not a few other animals also produce aspects of their environment as well? The previous year, Marx had already acknowledged:\n\nIn the same work, Marx writes:\n\nAlso in the segment on Estranged Labour:\n\nMore than twenty years later, in \"Capital\", he came to muse on a similar subject:\n\nFrom these passages we can observe something of Marx's beliefs about humans. That they characteristically produce their environments, and that they would do so, even were they not under the burden of 'physical need' - indeed, they will produce the 'whole of [their] nature', and may even create 'in accordance with the laws of beauty'. Perhaps most importantly, though, their creativity, their production is \"purposive\" and \"planned\". Humans, then, make plans for their future activity, and attempt to exercise their production (even lives) according to them. Perhaps most importantly, and most cryptically, Marx says that humans make both their 'life activity' and 'species' the 'object' of their will. They relate to their life activity, and are not simply identical with it. Michel Foucault's definition of biopolitics as the moment when \"man begins to take itself as a conscious object of elaboration\" may be compared to Marx's definition hereby exposed.\n\nTo say that A is the object of some subject B, means that B (specified as an agent) acts upon A in some respect. Thus if 'the proletariat smashes the state' then 'the state' is the object of the proletariat (the subject), in respect of smashing. It is similar to saying that A is the \"objective\" of B, though A could be a whole sphere of concern and not a closely defined aim. In this context, what does it mean to say that humans make their 'species' and their 'lives' their 'object'? It's worth noting that Marx's use of the word 'object' can imply that these are things which humans produces, or makes, just as they might produce a material object. If this inference is correct, then those things that Marx says about human production above, also apply to the production of human life, by humans. And simultaneously, 'As individuals express their life, so they are. What they are, therefore, coincides with their production, both with what they produce and with how they produce. The nature of individuals thus depends on the material conditions determining their production.'\n\nTo make one's life one's object is therefore to treat one's life as something that is under one's control. To raise in imagination plans for one's future and present, and to have a stake in being able to fulfill those plans. To be able to live a life of this character is to achieve 'self-activity' (actualisation), which Marx believes will only become possible after communism has replaced capitalism. 'Only at this stage does self-activity coincide with material life, which corresponds to the development of individuals into complete individuals and the casting-off of all natural limitations. The transformation of labour into self-activity corresponds to the transformation of the earlier limited intercourse into the intercourse of individuals as such'.\n\nWhat is involved in making one's species one's object is more complicated (see Allen Wood 2004, pp. 16–21). In one sense, it emphasises the essentially social character of humans, and their need to live in a community of the species. In others, it seems to emphasise that we attempt to make our lives expressions of our species-essence; further that we have goals concerning what becomes of the species in general. The idea covers much of the same territory as 'making one's life one's object': it concerns self-consciousness, purposive activity, and so forth.\n\nIt is often said that Marx conceived of humans as \"homo faber\", referring to Benjamin Franklin's definition of 'man as the tool-making animal' - that is, as 'man, the maker', though he never used the term himself. Above, we indicated that one of Marx's central contentions about humans was that they were differentiated by the manner in which they produce and that thus, somehow, production was one of humans' essential activities. In this context, it is worth noting that Marx does not always address 'labour' or 'work' in such glowing terms. He says that communism 'does away with labour'. Furthermore, 'If it is desired to strike a mortal blow at private property, one must attack it not only as a material state of affairs, but also as activity, as labour. It is one of the greatest misapprehensions to speak of free, human, social labour, of labour without private property. “Labour” by its very nature is unfree, unhuman, unsocial activity, determined by private property and creating private property.' Under Capitalism '[t]he capitalist functions only as capital personified, capital as a person, just as the worker only functions as the personification of labour, which belongs to him as torment, as exertion'.\n\nIt is generally held that Marx's view was that productive activity is an essential human activity, and can be rewarding when pursued freely. Marx's use of the words 'work' and 'labour' in the section above may be unequivocally negative; but this was not always the case, and is most strongly found in his early writing. However, Marx was always clear that under capitalism, labour was something inhuman, and dehumanising. 'labour is external to the worker – i.e., does not belong to his essential being; that he, therefore, does not confirm himself in his work, but denies himself, feels miserable and not happy, does not develop free mental and physical energy, but mortifies his flesh and ruins his mind'. While under communism, 'In the individual expression of my life I would have directly created your expression of your life, and therefore in my individual activity I would have directly confirmed and realised my true nature, my human nature, my communal nature'.\n\nMarx's theory of history attempts to describe the way in which humans change their environments and (in dialectical relation) their environments change them as well. That is:\n\nFurther Marx sets out his 'materialist conception of history' in opposition to 'idealist' conceptions of history; that of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, for instance. 'The first premise of all human history is, of course, the existence of living human individuals. Thus the first fact to be established is the physical organisation of these individuals and their consequent relation to the rest of nature.' Thus 'History does nothing, it “possesses no immense wealth”, it “wages no battles”. It is man, real, living man who does all that, who possesses and fights; “history” is not, as it were, a person apart, using man as a means to achieve its own aims; history is nothing but the activity of man pursuing his aims'. So we can see that, even before we begin to consider the precise character of human nature, 'real, living' humans, 'the activity of man pursuing his aims' is the very building block of Marx's theory of history. Humans act upon the world, changing it and themselves; and in doing so they 'make history'. However, even beyond this, human nature plays two key roles. In the first place, it is part of the explanation for the growth of the productive forces, which Marx conceives of as the driving force of history. Secondly, the particular needs and drives of humans explain the class antagonism which is generated under capitalism.\n\nIt has been held by several writers that it is Marx's conception of human nature which explains the 'development thesis' (Cohen, 1978) concerning the expansion of the productive forces, which according to Marx, is itself the fundamental driving force of history. If true, this would make his account of human nature perhaps the most fundamental aspect of his work. Geras writes, (1983, pp. 107–108, italics in original) \"historical materialism itself, this whole distinctive approach to society that originates with Marx, rests squarely upon the idea of a human nature\". It highlights that specific nexus of universal needs and capacities which explains the human productive process and man's organized transformation of the material environment; which process and transformation it treats in turn as the basis both of the social order and of historical change.' G.A. Cohen (1988, p. 84): 'The tendency's autonomy is just its independence of social structure, its rootedness in fundamental material facts of human nature and the human situation.' Allen Wood (2004, p. 75): 'Historical progress consists fundamentally in the growth of people's abilities to shape and control the world about them. This is the most basic way in which they develop and express their human essence' (see also, the quotation from Allen Wood above).\n\nIn his article \"Reconsidering Historical Materialism\", however, Cohen gives an argument to the effect that human nature cannot be the premise on which the plausibility of the expansion of the productive forces is grounded.\n\nThe implication of this is that hence 'one might ... imagine two kinds of creature, one whose essence it was to create and the other not, undergoing similarly toilsome histories because of similarly adverse circumstances. In one case, but not the other, the toil would be a self-alienating exercise of essential powers' (p. 170). Hence, 'historical materialism and Marxist philosophical anthropology are independent of, though also consistent with, each other' (p. 174, see especially sections 10 and 11). The problem is this: it seems as though the motivation most people have for the work they do isn't the exercise of their creative capacity; on the contrary, labour is alienated by definition in the capitalist system based on salary, and people only do it because they have to. They go to work not to express their human nature but to find theirs means of subsistence. So in that case, why do the productive forces grow - does human nature have anything to do with it? The answer to this question is a difficult one, and a closer consideration of the arguments in the literature is necessary for a full answer than can be given in this article. However, it is worth bearing in mind that Cohen had previously been committed to the strict view that human nature (and other 'asocial premises') were \"sufficient\" for the development of the productive forces - it could be that they are only one \"necessary\" constituent. It is also worth considering that by 1988 (see quotation above), he appears to consider that the problem is resolved.\n\nSome needs are far more important than others. In \"The German Ideology\" Marx writes that 'life involves before everything else eating and drinking, a habitation, clothing and many other things'. All those other aspects of human nature which he discusses (such as 'self-activity') are therefore subordinate to the priority given to these. Marx makes explicit his view that humans develop new needs to replace old: 'the satisfaction of the first need (the action of satisfying, and the instrument of satisfaction which has been acquired) leads to new needs'.\n\nGeras says of Marx's work that: 'Whatever else it is, theory and socio-historical explanation, and scientific as it may be, that work is a moral indictment resting on the conception of essential human needs, an ethical standpoint, in other words, in which a view of human nature is involved' (1983, pp. 83–84).\n\nAlienation, for Marx, is the estrangement of humans from aspects of their human nature. Since - as we have seen - human nature consists in a particular set of vital drives and tendencies, whose exercise constitutes flourishing, alienation is a condition wherein these drives and tendencies are stunted. For essential powers, alienation substitutes disempowerment; for making one's own life one's object, one's life becoming an object of capital. Marx believes that alienation will be a feature of all society before communism. The opposite of, alienation is 'actualisation' or 'self-activity' - the activity of the self, controlled by and for the self.\n\nOne important criticism of Marx's 'philosophical anthropology' (i.e. his conception of humans) is offered by Gerald Cohen, the leader of Analytical Marxism, in \"Reconsidering Historical Materialism\" (in ed. Callinicos, 1989). Cohen claims: 'Marxist philosophical anthropology is one sided. Its conception of human nature and human good overlooks the need for self-identity than which nothing is more essentially human.' (p. 173, see especially sections 6 and 7). The consequence of this is held to be that 'Marx and his followers have underestimated the importance of phenomena, such as religion and nationalism, which satisfy the need for self-identity. (Section 8.)' (p. 173). Cohen describes what he sees as the origins of Marx's alleged neglect: 'In his anti-Hegelian, Feuerbachian affirmation of the radical objectivity of matter, Marx focused on the relationship of the subject to an object which is in no way subject, and, as time went on, he came to neglect the subject's relationship to itself, and that aspect of the subject's relationship to others which is a mediated (that is, indirect), form of relationship to itself' (p. 155).\n\nCohen believes that people are driven, typically, not to create identity, but to preserve that which they have in virtue, for example, of 'nationality, or race, or religion, or some slice or amalgam thereof' (pp. 156–159). Cohen does not claim that 'Marx denied that there is a need for self-definition, but [instead claims that] he failed to give the truth due emphasis' (p. 155). Nor does Cohen say that the sort of self-understanding that can be found through religion etc. is accurate (p. 158). Of nationalism, he says 'identifications [can] take benign, harmless, and catastrophically malignant forms' (p. 157) and does not believe 'that the state is a good medium for the embodiment of nationality' (p. 164).\n\n"}

In Hinduism, the mundamala is a characteristic of fearsome aspects of the Hindu Divine Mother and the god Shiva; while in Buddhism, it is worn by wrathful deities of Tibetan Buddhism.\n\nThe mundamala is often found in the iconography of the Mahavidyas, a group of ten fearsome Tantric goddesses. Kali, the foremost Mahavidya, often wears a garland of freshly severed heads. The blood from her bleeding garland bathes her nude body. The number of heads in the mundamala is generally described as fifty. Other Mahavidyas like Tara, Chhinnamasta, Bhairavi, Dhumavati and Matangi are depicted or at least described wearing mundamalas; the goddess may also hold a severed head or skull (kapala) in her hand. In description of Bhairavi, the heads are said to be so fresh that they vomit blood over her breasts.\n\nAnother fierce goddess depicted often wearing the mundamala is Chamunda.\n\nThe god Shiva and his fierce manifestations are often depicted wearing the mundamala; Shiva is covered with ashes and skulls adorn him. Pahari paintings often picture Shiva's family making mundamalas. His son Kartikeya helps him or his mother Parvati handing over a head, while the latter threads them. Another scene depicts the parents making the mundamala, while Kartikeya and his brother Ganesha play nearby.\n\nThe ferocious manifestation of Shiva, Bhairava (\"The Terrible\") as well as Bhairava's various forms like Vatuk-Bhairava are depicted wearing the mundamala. Other fierce forms of Shiva wearing the mundamalas include Virabhadra, Gajasurasamhara (\"Slayer of the Elephant demon\") and the eight-armed Aghoramurti.\n\nThe fifty or fifty-two heads or skulls in the mundamala are described to symbolize the letters of the Sanskrit alphabet in Kali's iconography, thus signifying the wearer Kali as \"sabda Brahman\", Ultimate Reality recognized as Sound and the primal sound of the sacred syllable Om. Another interpretation links the mundamala symbolizing the heads of foes and demons slain by the wearer goddess in battle. The mundamala in the context of Chhinnamasta's iconography is said to signify her victory over Time and fear of Death.\n\nIn Shiva's iconography, the mundamala represents the continual creation and destruction cycles of human existence.\n\nVarious wrathful deities, including the dharmapalas, wear the mundamala, a five-skull crown and human or animal skins. Manifestations of Akshobhya are generally fearsome and are depicted wearing the mundamala as well as skulls and serpents. These include Acala, Heruka, Chakrasamvara and Yamantaka. Mahakala, who from adopted from the Hindu Shiva also wears the mundamala. Hevajra and his terrific emanations also adore the mundamala.\n\nWrathful Buddhist goddesses like Marichi, Vajravarahi, Guhyeshvari and dakinis are depicted wearing the mundamala.\n\nThe Kumari, a girl worshipped as a goddess in Nepal, is identified with Vajravarahi by Buddhists. She wears a silver mundamala signifying her identity as Vajravarahi and her ferocious nature.\n\nLike in Hindu iconography, the mundamala symbolizes the Sanskrit alphabet in Buddhist iconography too. In Chakrasamvara's iconography, it symbolizes the \"abandonment of phenomenal appearances\" as well as his union with his consort Vajravarahi (when depicted with him).\n\n"}

{"id": "345803", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=345803", "title": "Politicization of science", "text": "Politicization of science\n\nThe politicization of science is the manipulation of science for political gain. It occurs when government, business, or advocacy groups use legal or economic pressure to influence the findings of scientific research or the way it is disseminated, reported or interpreted. The politicization of science may also negatively affect academic and scientific freedom. Historically, groups have conducted various campaigns to promote their interests in defiance of scientific consensus, and in an effort to manipulate public policy. On the other hand, policy makers are required to take timely action regardless of the raging debates and/or apparent credibility of alternative viewpoints. Politics cannot be completely divorced from policy.\n\nMany factors can act as facets of the politicization of science. These can range, for example, from populist anti-intellectualism and perceived threats to religious belief to postmodernist subjectivism and fear for business interests.\n\nPoliticization occurs as scientific information is presented with emphasis on the uncertainty associated with the scientific evidence. The emphasis capitalizes on the lack of consensus, which influences the way the studies are perceived. Chris Mooney describes how this point is sometimes intentionally ignored as a part an \"Orwellian tactic.\" Organizations and politicians seek to disclaim all discussion on some issues as 'the more probable conclusion is still uncertain' as opposed to 'conclusions are most scientifically likely' in order to further discredit scientific studies.\n\nTactics such as shifting conversation, failing to acknowledge facts, and capitalizing on doubt of scientific consensus have been used to gain more attention for views that have been undermined by scientific evidence. \"Merchants of Doubt,\" ideology-based interest groups that claim expertise on scientific issues, have ran successful \"disinformation campaigns\" in which they highlight the inherent uncertainty of science to cast doubt on scientific issues such as human-caused climate change, even though the scientific community has reached virtual consensus that humans play a role in climate change.\n\nWilliam R. Freudenburg and colleagues have written about politicization of science as a rhetorical technique and states that it is an attempt to shift the burden of proof in an argument. He offers the example of cigarette lobbyists opposing laws that would discourage smoking. The lobbyists trivialize evidence as uncertain, emphasizing lack of conclusion. Freudenberg concludes that politicians and lobby groups are too often able to make \"successful efforts to argue for full 'scientific certainty' before a regulation can be said to be 'justified' and maintain that what is needed is a balanced approach that carefully considers the risks of both Type 1 and Type 2 errors in a situation while noting that scientific conclusions are always tentative.\n\nPresident of the American Council on Science and Health Hank Campbell and microbiologist Alex Berezow have described \"feel-good fallacies\" used in politics, where politicians frame their positions in a way that makes people feel good about supporting certain policies even when scientific evidence shows there is no need to worry or there is no need for dramatic change on current programs. They have claimed that progressives have had these kinds of issues with policies involving genetically modified foods, vaccination, overpopulation, use of animals in research, nuclear energy, and other topics.\n\nBoth mainstream climatologists and their critics have accused each other of politicizing the science behind climate change. There is a scientific consensus that global surface temperatures have increased in recent decades and that the trend is caused primarily by human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases.\n\nIn 1991, a US corporate coalition including the National Coal Association, the Western Fuels Association and Edison Electrical Institute created a public relations organization called the \"Information Council on the Environment\" (ICE). ICE launched a $500,000 advertising campaign to, in ICE's own words, \"reposition global warming as theory (not fact).\" Critics of industry groups have charged that the claims about a global warming controversy are part of a deliberate effort to reduce the impact any international treaty, such as the Kyoto Protocol, might have on their business interests.\n\nIn June 2005, John Vidal, environment editor of \"The Guardian\", asserted the existence of US State Department papers showing that the Bush administration thanked Exxon executives for the company's \"active involvement\" in helping to determine climate change policy, including the US stance on Kyoto. Input from the industry advocacy group Global Climate Coalition was also a factor.\n\nIn 2006, \"Guardian\" columnist George Monbiot reported that according to data found in official Exxon documents, 124 organizations have taken money from ExxonMobil or worked closely with those that have, and that \"These organizations take a consistent line on climate change: that the science is contradictory, the scientists are split, environmentalists are charlatans, liars or lunatics, and if governments took action to prevent global warming, they would be endangering the global economy for no good reason. The findings these organisations dislike are labelled 'junk science'. The findings they welcome are labelled 'sound science'.\" The \"selective use of data\", cherry picking, is identified as a notable form of scientific abuse by the Pacific Institute, an organization created to provide independent research and policy analysis on issues at the intersection of development, environment, and security.\n\nThe intelligent design movement associated with the Discovery Institute, attempts to \"defeat [the] materialist world view\" represented by the theory of evolution in favor of \"a science consonant with Christian and theistic convictions\". The Discovery Institute portrays evolution as a \"theory in crisis\" with scientists criticizing evolution and that \"fairness\" and \"equal time\" requires educating students about \"the controversy.\"\n\nOne of the most reliable and empirically tested theories in science is that all forms of life on Earth are related by common descent with modification. Accordingly, any controversial aspects of evolution are a matter of religion and politics, not science. The 2005 ruling in the Dover trial, \"Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District\", where the claims of intelligent design proponents were considered by a United States federal court concluded that intelligent design is not science, that it \"cannot uncouple itself from its creationist, and thus religious, antecedents\", and concluded that the school district's promotion of it therefore violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n\nIn 2006 the scientific journal \"Science\" published survey finding that the U.S. ranks second from last in acceptance of the theory of evolution among thirty-four developed countries surveyed. The article said: \"The\nacceptance of evolution is lower in the United States than in Japan or Europe, largely because of\nwidespread fundamentalism and the politicization of science in the United States.\"\n\nBy the mid-1950s there was a scientific consensus that smoking promotes lung cancer, but the tobacco industry fought the findings, both in the public eye and within the scientific community. Tobacco companies funded think tanks and lobbying groups, started health reassurance campaigns, ran advertisements in medical journals, and researched alternate explanations for lung cancer, such as pollution, asbestos and even pet birds. Denying the case against tobacco was \"closed,\" they called for more research as a tactic to delay regulation. John Horgan, notes a rhetoric tactic that has been used by tobacco companies. It is summarized in a line that appeared in a confidential memo from a tobacco company, in 1969, when they sought to cast doubt on evidence that supports smoking causes cancer. It read, \"Doubt is our product since it is the best means of competing with the 'body of fact' that exists in the mind of the general public. It is also the means of establishing a controversy.\"\n\nNazi Germany under Adolf Hitler was well known for eugenics programs which attempted to maintain a \"pure\" German race through a series of programs that ran under the banner of Racial Hygiene. The Nazis manipulated scientific research in Germany, by forcing some scholars to emigrate, and by allocating funding for research based on ideological rather than scientific merit.\n\nIn the early 20th century, Eugenics enjoyed substantial international support, from leading politicians and scientists. The First International Congress of Eugenics in 1912 was supported by many prominent persons, including: its president Leonard Darwin, the son of Charles Darwin; honorary vice-president Winston Churchill, then First Lord of the Admiralty and future Prime Minister of the United Kingdom; Auguste Forel, famous Swiss pathologist; Alexander Graham Bell, the inventor of the telephone; among other prominent people.\n\nThe level of support for Eugenics research by the Nazis prompted an American Eugenics advocate to seek an expansion of the American program, with the complaint that \"the Germans are beating us at our own game\".\n\nThere was a strong connection between American and Nazi Eugenics research. Nazis based their Eugenics program on the United States' programs of forced sterilization, especially on the eugenics laws that had been enacted in California.\n\nIn the Soviet Union, scientific research was under strict political control. A number of research areas were declared \"bourgeois pseudoscience\" and forbidden. This has led to significant setbacks for the Soviet science, notably in biology due to ban on genetics (see \"Lysenkoism\") and in computer science, which drastically influenced the Soviet economy and technology.\n\nThe General Social Survey (GSS) of 1974 recorded that conservatives had the highest rates of trust in science between the three major political demographics; conservatives, liberals, and moderates. This study was repeated annually between 1972 through 1994, and biannually from 1994 until 2010. In 2010 when the same study was repeated, conservatives trust rates had decreased from 49% to 38%, moderates from 45% to 40%, and liberals staying relatively stable, rising slightly from 48% to 50%.\n\nThe study by Gordon Gauchat, which investigates time trends in the public trust of science in the United States, suggests that the increase of distrust of conservatives can be attributed to the two cultural shifts. The first was during the post-Reagan era when the New Right emerged, and the second during the G.W. Bush era when the NR intensified and conservatives commenced the “war on science”.\n\nBarack Obama and other politicians, since Bush’s Presidency, have expressed their concerns with the politicization of science in both the public and government sphere. In 2011, during his State of the Union speech, Obama discussed his dissatisfaction of the relationships between organized science, private economic interests, and the government.\n\nThe data collected in this study reveals the Public Trust in Science, the Public Confidence in Science, and the Predicted Probabilities between Liberals and Conservatives. The survey examines variables including gender, ethnicity, level of education, income, religion, age, political party preference, political demographics, and changes over time. Conclusively, the empirical findings of this study have shown that that although the distrust of conservatives has increased over time, the overall public trust in science has not changed since the 1970s.\n\nIn 2004, The \"Denver Post\" reported that the George W. Bush administration \"has installed more than 100 top officials who were once lobbyists, attorneys or spokespeople for the industries they oversee.\" At least 20 of these former industry advocates helped their agencies write, shape or push for policy shifts that benefit their former industries. \"They knew which changes to make because they had pushed for them as industry advocates.\"\n\nAlso in 2004, the scientific advocacy group Union of Concerned Scientists issued a report, \"Scientific Integrity in Policymaking: An Investigation into the Bush Administration's Misuse of Science\" which charged the following: A growing number of scientists, policy makers, and technical specialists both inside and outside the government allege that the current Bush administration has suppressed or distorted the scientific analyses of federal agencies to bring these results in line with administration policy. In addition, these experts contend that irregularities in the appointment of scientific advisors and advisory panels are threatening to upset the legally mandated balance of these bodies. A petition, signed on February 18, 2004, by more than 9,000 scientists, including 49 Nobel laureates and 63 National Medal of Science recipients, followed the report. The petition stated: When scientific knowledge has been found to be in conflict with its political goals, the administration has often manipulated the process through which science enters into its decisions. This has been done by placing people who are professionally unqualified or who have clear conflicts of interest in official posts and on scientific advisory committees; by disbanding existing advisory committees; by censoring and suppressing reports by the government’s own scientists; and by simply not seeking independent scientific advice. Other administrations have, on occasion, engaged in such practices, but not so systematically nor on so wide a front. Furthermore, in advocating policies that are not scientifically sound, the administration has sometimes misrepresented scientific knowledge and misled the public about the implications of its policies.\n\nThe same year, Francesca Grifo, executive director of the Union of Concerned Scientists' Scientific Integrity Program, stated \"We have reports that stay in draft form and don't get out to the public. We have reports that are changed. We have reports that are ignored and overwritten.\"\n\nIn response to criticisms, President Bush in 2006 unveiled a campaign in his State of the Union Address to promote scientific research and education to ensure American competitiveness in the world, vowing to \"double the federal commitment to the most critical basic research programs in the physical sciences over the next 10 years.\"\n\nRichard Carmona, the first surgeon general appointed by President George W. Bush, publicly accused the administration in July 2007 of political interference and muzzling him on key issues like embryonic stem cell research.\n\n\"Anything that doesn't fit into the political appointees' ideological, theological or political agenda is often ignored, marginalized or simply buried,\" Carmona testified.\n\nAlthough he did not make personal accusations, the \"Washington Post\" reported on July 29 that the official who blocked at least one of Carmona's reports was William R. Steiger.\n\nIn July 2006 the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) released survey results that demonstrate pervasive political influence of science at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Of the 997 FDA scientists who responded to the survey, nearly one fifth (18 percent) said that they \"have been asked, for non-scientific reasons, to inappropriately exclude or alter technical information or their conclusions in a FDA scientific document.\" This is the third survey Union of Concerned Scientists has conducted to examine inappropriate interference with science at federal agencies.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services also conducted a survey addressing the same topic which generated similar findings. According to \"USA Today\", a survey of Food and Drug Administration scientists by Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility and the Union of Concerned Scientists found that many scientists have been pressured to approve or reject new drugs despite their scientific findings concerns. In July 2006, the Union of Concerned Scientists released survey results that they said \"demonstrate pervasive political influence of science\" at the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nOn May 1, 2007, deputy assistant secretary at the United States Department of the Interior Julie MacDonald resigned after the Interior Department Inspector General, Honorable Earl E. Devaney, reported that MacDonald broke federal rules by giving non-public, internal government documents to oil industry and property rights groups, and manipulated scientific findings to favor Bush policy goals and assist land developers. On November 29, 2007, another report by Devaney found that MacDonald could have also benefitted financially from a decision she was involved with to remove the Sacramento splittail fish from the federal endangered species list.\n\nMacDonald's conduct violated the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) under 5 C.F.R. § 2635.703, Use of nonpublic information, and 5 C.F.R. § 2635.101, Basic obligation of public service. MacDonald resigned a week before a House congressional oversight committee was to hold a hearing on accusations that she had \"violated the Endangered Species Act, censored science and mistreated staff of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\"\n\nIn December 2007, the \"Christian Science Monitor\" reported that at least since 2003, and especially after Hurricane Katrina, the George W. Bush administration broadly attempted to control which climate scientists could speak with reporters, as well as edited scientists' congressional testimony on climate science and key legal opinions. Those who have studied organizations that set up to delay action and manufacture uncertainty about the well-established scientific consensus have divided their tactics into three steps: first, deny that there is a problem, second, make the case that there are benefits involved, and, third, insist that there is nothing that can be done.\n\nIn a study, \"The legitimacy of environmental scientists in the public sphere\" by Gordon Gauchat, Timothy O’Brien, and Oriol Mirosa, the researchers conclude that attitudes about environmental scientists as policy advisers are highly politicized. Their results demonstrate that, to be perceived by the public as a reputable policy advisor, the public's perception of their integrity and understanding weigh more strongly than their agreement with scientific consensus.\n\nIn August 2003, United States, Democratic Congressman Henry A. Waxman and the staff of the Government Reform Committee released a report concluding that the administration of George W. Bush had politicized science and sex education. The report accuses the administration of modifying performance measures for abstinence-based programs to make them look more effective. The report also found that the Bush administration had appointed Dr. Joseph McIlhaney, a prominent advocate of abstinence-only program, to the Advisory Committee to the director of the Centers for Disease Control. According to the report, information about comprehensive sex education was removed from the CDC's website.\n\nOther issues considered for removal included agricultural pollution, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and breast cancer; the report found that a National Cancer Institute website has been changed to reflect the administration view that there may be a risk of breast cancer associated with abortions. The website was updated after protests and now holds that no such risk has been found in recent, well-designed studies.\n\nThe abortion-breast cancer hypothesis is the belief that induced abortions increase the risk of developing breast cancer. This belief is in contrast to the scientific consensus that there is no evidence suggesting that abortions can cause breast cancer. Despite the scientific community rejecting the hypothesis, many pro-life advocates continue to argue that a link between abortions and breast cancer exists, in an effort to influence public policy and opinion to further restrict abortions and discourage women from having abortions. While historically a controversial hypothesis, the debate now is almost entirely political rather than scientific.\n\nThe most notable example of the politicization of this topic was the modification of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) fact sheet by the George W. Bush administration from concluding no link to a more ambiguous assessment regarding the abortion-breast cancer hypothesis, despite the NCI's scientifically-based assessment to the contrary.\n\nIn January 2007, the U.S. House Committee on Science, Space and Technology announced the formation of a new subcommittee, the Science Subcommittee on Oversight, which handles investigative and oversight activities on matters covering the committee's entire jurisdiction. The subcommittee has authority to look into a whole range of important issues, particularly those concerning manipulation of scientific data at Federal agencies.\n\nIn an interview, subcommittee chairman Rep. Brad Miller pledged to investigate scientific integrity concerns under the Bush Administration. Miller noted that there were multiple reports in the media of the Bush Administration's manipulation of science to advance his political agenda, corrupt advisory panels, and minimize scientific research with federal funds. Miller, as part of the House Committee of Science and Technology, collected evidence of interference with scientific integrity by Bush's political appointees.\n\nThe issue of politicized science surfaced again during the 2016 United States presidential campaign by then Republican candidate Donald Trump. Trump stated his intention to strip NASA's Earth Science division of its funding, a move that \"The Guardian\" writes \"would mean the elimination of NASA's world-renowned research into temperature, ice, clouds and other climate phenomena\".\n\nOn January 22, 2013, New Jersey Representative Rush D. Holt, Jr., a Quaker Christian and nuclear physicist, introduced a resolution to the United States Congress designating February 12, 2013 (Charles Darwin's 204th birthday) as \"Darwin Day\" in order to recognize \"the importance of sciences in the betterment of humanity\".\n\nThe politicization of science is a subset of a broader topic, the politics of science, which has been studied by scholars in a variety of fields, including most notably Science and Technology Studies; history of science; political science; and the sociology of science, knowledge, and technology. Increasingly in recent decades, these fields have examined the process through which science and technology are shaped. Some of the scholarly work in this area is reviewed in \"The Handbook of Science & Technology Studies\" (1995, 2008), a collection of literature reviews published by the Society for Social Studies of Science. There is an annual award for books relevant to the politics of science given by the Society for Social Studies of Science called the Rachel Carson Prize.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "24845", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24845", "title": "Pope Sixtus IV", "text": "Pope Sixtus IV\n\nPope Sixtus IV (21 July 1414 – 12 August 1484), born Francesco della Rovere, was Pope from 9 August 1471 to his death in 1484. His accomplishments as pope included building the Sistine Chapel and the creation of the Vatican Archives. A patron of the arts, the group of artists that he brought together introduced the Early Renaissance into Rome with the first masterpieces of the city's new artistic age.\n\nSixtus aided the Spanish Inquisition though he fought to prevent abuses therein, and he annulled the decrees of the Council of Constance. He was noted for his nepotism and was personally involved in the infamous Pazzi conspiracy.\n\nFrancesco was born to a family of modest means from Liguria, Italy, the son of Leonardo della Rovere and Luchina Monleoni. He was born in Celle Ligure, a town near Savona.\n\nAs a young man, Della Rovere joined the Franciscan Order, an unlikely choice for a political career, and his intellectual qualities were revealed while he was studying philosophy and theology at the University of Pavia. He went on to lecture at Padua and many other Italian universities.\n\nIn 1464, Della Rovere was elected Minister General of the Franciscan order at the age of 50. In 1467, he was appointed Cardinal by Pope Paul II with the titular church being the Basilica of San Pietro in Vincoli. Before his papal election, Cardinal della Rovere was renowned for his unworldliness and had even written learned treatises, entitled \"On the Blood of Christ\" and \"On the Power of God\". His pious reputation was one of the deciding factors that prompted the College of Cardinals to elect him pope upon the unexpected death of Paul II at the age of fifty-four.\n\nUpon being elected pope Della Rovere adopted the name Sixtus, which had not been used since the 5th century. One of his first acts was to declare a renewed crusade against the Ottoman Turks in Smyrna. However, after the conquest of Smyrna, the fleet disbanded. Some fruitless attempts were made towards unification with the Greek Church. For the remainder of his pontificate, Sixtus turned to temporal issues and dynastic considerations.\n\nSixtus IV sought to strengthen his position by surrounding himself with relatives and friends. In the fresco by Melozzo da Forlì, he is accompanied by his Della Rovere and Riario nephews, not all of whom were made cardinals; the protonotary apostolic Pietro Riario (on his right), the future Pope Julius II standing before him; and Girolamo Riario and Giovanni della Rovere, behind the kneeling Platina, author of the first humanist history of the popes. His nephew Pietro Riario also benefited from his nepotism. Pietro became one of the richest men in Rome and was entrusted with Pope Sixtus' foreign policy. However, Pietro died prematurely in 1474, and his role passed to Giuliano Della Rovere.\n\nThe secular fortunes of the Della Rovere family began when Sixtus invested his nephew Giovanni with the lordship of Senigallia and arranged his marriage to the daughter of Federico III da Montefeltro, duke of Urbino; from that union came a line of Della Rovere dukes of Urbino that lasted until the line expired, in 1631. Six of the thirty-four cardinals that he created were his nephews.\n\nIn his territorial aggrandizement of the Papal States, his niece's son Cardinal Raffaele Riario, for whom the Palazzo della Cancelleria was constructed, was a suspected colluder in the failed Pazzi conspiracy of 1478 to assassinate both Lorenzo de' Medici and his brother Giuliano and replace them in Florence with Sixtus IV's other nephew, Girolamo Riario. Francesco Salviati, Archbishop of Pisa and a main organizer of the plot, was hanged on the walls of the Florentine Palazzo Della Signoria. Sixtus IV replied with an interdict and two years of war with Florence.\n\nAccording to the later published chronicle of the Italian historian Stefano Infessura, \"Diary of the City of Rome\", Sixtus was a \"lover of boys and sodomites\", awarding benefices and bishoprics in return for sexual favours and nominating a number of young men as cardinals, some of whom were celebrated for their good looks. However, Infessura had partisan allegiances to the Colonna and so is not considered to be always reliable or impartial. The English churchman and Protestant polemicist John Bale, writing a century later, attributed to Sixtus \"the authorisation to practice sodomy during periods of warm weather\" to the \"Cardinal of Santa Lucia\". Although such accusations are easily dismissed as anti-Catholic propaganda, they still prompted the noted historian of the Catholic Church, Ludwig von Pastor, to issue a firm rebuttal.\n\nSixtus continued a dispute with King Louis XI of France, who upheld the Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges (1438), which held that papal decrees needed royal assent before they could be promulgated in France. That was a cornerstone of the privileges claimed for the Gallican Church and could never be shifted as long as Louis XI manoeuvred to replace King Ferdinand I of Naples with a French prince. Louis was thus in conflict with the papacy, and Sixtus could not permit it.\n\nOn 1 November 1478, Sixtus published the papal bull \"Exigit Sincerae Devotionis Affectus\" through which the Spanish Inquisition was established in the Kingdom of Castile. Sixtus consented under political pressure from Ferdinand of Aragon, who threatened to withhold military support from his kingdom of Sicily. Nevertheless, Sixtus IV quarrelled over protocol and prerogatives of jurisdiction; he was unhappy with the excesses of the Inquisition and condemned the most flagrant abuses in 1482.\n\nAs a temporal prince who constructed stout fortresses in the Papal States, he encouraged the Venetians to attack Ferrara, which he wished to obtain for another nephew. Ercole I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara, was allied with the Sforzas of Milan, the Medicis of Florence along with the King of Naples, normally a hereditary ally and champion of the papacy. The angered Italian princes allied to force Sixtus IV to make peace to his great annoyance. For refusing to desist from the very hostilities that he himself had instigated and for being a dangerous rival to Della Rovere dynastic ambitions in the Marche, Sixtus placed Venice under interdict in 1483. He also lined the coffers of the state by unscrupulously selling high offices and privileges.\n\nIn ecclesiastical affairs, Sixtus promoted the dogma of the Immaculate Conception, which had been confirmed at the Council of Basle in 1439, and he designated 8 December as its feastday. In 1476, he issued the apostolic constitution \"Cum Praeexcelsa\", establishing a Mass and Office for the feast. He formally annulled the decrees of the Council of Constance in 1478.\n\nThe two papal bulls issued by Pope Nicholas V, \"Dum Diversas\" of 1452 and \"Romanus Pontifex\" of 1455, had effectively given the Portuguese the rights to acquire slaves along the African Coast by force or trade. Those concessions were confirmed by Sixtus in his own bull, \"Aeterni regis\", of 21 June 1481. Arguably the \"ideology of conquest\" expounded in those texts became the means by which commerce and conversion were facilitated.\n\nIn November 1476, Isabel and Fernando ordered an investigation into rights of conquest in the Canary Islands, and in the spring of 1478, they sent Juan Rejon with sixty soldiers and thirty cavalry to the Grand Canary, where the natives retreated inland.\n\nSixtus's earlier threats to excommunicate all captains or pirates who enslaved Christians in the bull \"Regimini Gregis\" of 1476 could have been intended to emphasise the need to convert the natives of the Canary Islands and Guinea and establish a clear difference in status between those who had converted and those who resisted. The ecclesiastical penalties were directed towards those who were enslaving the recent converts.\n\nAs a civic patron in Rome, even the anti-papal chronicler Stefano Infessura agreed that Sixtus should be admired. The dedicatory inscription in the fresco by Melozzo da Forlì in the Vatican Palace records: \"You gave your city temples, streets, squares, fortifications, bridges and restored the Acqua Vergine as far as the Trevi...\" In addition to restoring the aqueduct that provided Rome an alternative to the river water, which had made the city famously unhealthy, he restored or rebuilt over 30 of Rome's dilapidated churches such as San Vitale (1475) and Santa Maria del Popolo, and he added seven new ones. The Sistine Chapel was sponsored by Sixtus IV, as was the \"Ponte Sisto\", the Sistine Bridge (the first new bridge across the Tiber since Antiquity) and the building of \"Via Sistina\" (later named \"Borgo Sant'Angelo\"), a road leading from Castel Sant'Angelo to Saint Peter. All of that was done to facilitate the integration of the Vatican Hill and Borgo with the heart of Old Rome. That was part of a broader scheme of urbanization carried out under Sixtus IV, who swept the long-established markets from the Campidoglio in 1477 and decreed in a bull of 1480 the widening of streets and the first post-Roman paving, the removal of porticoes and other post-classical impediments to free public passage.\nAt the beginning of his papacy, in 1471, Sixtus had donated several historically important Roman sculptures that founded a papal collection of art, which would eventually develop into the collections of the Capitoline Museums. He also refounded, enriched and enlarged the Vatican Library. He had Regiomontanus attempt the first sanctioned reorganisation of the Julian calendar and increased the size and prestige of the papal chapel choir, bringing singers and some prominent composers (Gaspar van Weerbeke, Marbrianus de Orto and Bertrandus Vaqueras) to Rome from the north.\n\nIn addition to being a patron of the arts, Sixtus was a patron of the sciences. Before he became pope, he had spent time at the very liberal and cosmopolitan University of Padua, which maintained considerable independence from the Church and had a very international character. As Pope, he issued a papal bull allowing local bishops to give the bodies of executed criminals and unidentified corpses to physicians and artists for dissection. It was that access to corpses which allowed the anatomist Vesalius, along with Titian's pupil Jan Stephen van Calcar, to complete the revolutionary medical/anatomical text \"De humani corporis fabrica\".\n\nPope Sixtus's tomb was destroyed in the Sack of Rome in 1527. Today, his remains, along with the remains of his nephew Pope Julius II (Giuliano della Rovere), are interred in St. Peter's Basilica in the floor, in front of the monument to Pope Clement X. A marble tombstone marks the site.\n\nHis bronze funerary monument, now in the basement Treasury of St. Peter's Basilica, like a giant casket of goldsmith's work, is by Antonio Pollaiuolo. The top of the casket is a lifelike depiction of the Pope lying in state. Around the sides are bas-relief panels depicting with allegorical female figures the arts and sciences (Grammar, Rhetoric, Arithmetic, Geometry, Music, Painting, Astronomy, Philosophy and Theology). Each figure incorporates the oak tree (\"rovere\" in Italian) symbol of Sixtus IV. The overall program of the panels, their beauty, complex symbolism, classical references and their relative arrangement are some compelling and comprehensive illustrations of the Renaissance worldview. None of them actually states how he died.\n\nSixtus created an unusually large number of cardinals during his pontificate (23) who were drawn from the roster of the princely houses of Italy, France and Spain, thus ensuring that many of his policies continued after his death:\n\n\nPope Sixtus is portrayed by James Faulkner in the historical fantasy \"Da Vinci's Demons\" as having an identical twin, Alessandro. Shortly after the true Pope Sixtus, Francesco, was elected on conclave, Alessandro usurped the Holy See and had his brother locked up in Castel Sant'Angelo. The series implies that many of the more unsavoury parts of Sixtus' reign were really the work of his twin, who was out to gain power for himself.\n\nPope Sixtus will be portrayed by Raul Bova in the second season of the TV series \"\".\n\n\n\n"}

Practitioners of rubrication, so-called \"rubricators\", were specialized scribes who received text from the manuscript's original scribe and supplemented it with additional text in red ink for emphasis. The term \"rubrication\" comes from the Latin \"rubrico\", \"to color red\".\n\nThe practice usually entailed the addition of red headings to mark the end of one section of text and the beginning of another. Such headings were sometimes used to introduce the subject of the following section or to declare its purpose and function. Rubrication was used so often in this regard that the term \"rubric\" was commonly used as a generic term for headers of any type or color, though it technically referred only to headers to which red ink had been added. In liturgical books such as missals, red may also be used to give the actions to be performed by the celebrant or others, leaving the texts to be read in black. Important feasts in liturgical calendars were also often rubricated, and rubrication can indicate how scribes viewed the importance of different parts of their text.\n\nRubrication may also be used to emphasize the starting character of a canto or other division of text; this was often important because manuscripts often consist of multiple works in a single bound volume. This particular type of rubrication is similar to flourishing, wherein red ink is used to style a leading character with artistic loops and swirls. However, this process is far less elaborate than illumination, in which detailed pictures are incorporated into the manuscript often set in thin sheets of gold to give the appearance of light within the text.\n\nQuite commonly the manuscript's initial scribe would provide notes to the rubricator in the form of annotations made in the margins of the text. Such notes were effectively indications to \"rubricate here\" or \"add rubric\". In many other cases, the initial scribe also held the position of rubricator, and so he applied rubrication as needed without the use of annotations. This is important, as a scribe's annotations to the rubricator can be used along with codicology to establish a manuscript's history, or provenance.\n\nLater medieval practitioners extended the practice of rubrication to include the use of other colors of ink besides red. Most often, alternative colors included blue and green. After the introduction of movable type printing, readers continued to expect rubrication, which might be done by hand, if there were few rubrics to add, or by a separate print using a red-ink form, later the normal method. The \"great majority of incunables did not issue from the press in a finished state… hardly any incunable was considered 'finished' by its printer…\", suggesting that hand rubrication provided a sense of legitimacy to the efforts of early printers and their works. This fact, the notion that something about hand written rubrication completes a printed work by attributing to it a sense of legitimacy and finality, is further supported by the fact that red ink \"was not merely decorative… red's original function was to articulate the text by indicating such parts as headings that were so essential to the function of manuscripts that the printers had to deal with them in some way\".\n\nThe title \"generally was written in one or more lines that the scribe of the text had left blank to receive the title\", showing both the importance of the section and the knowledge one may gain from this process. As mentioned above, the initial scribe of a text often left notes for the rubricator of where rubrication would be necessary, a fact that helps the modern historian learn of the provenance of the manuscript. Rubrication affected how later generations read and interpreted a text, and this process helped ensure editorial standardization throughout Western Europe.\n\nThe recipe for the red ink is given in Theophilus' \"De diversis artibus\":\nThe process took a long time to complete, but was cheap and used common materials. The white material is lead carbonate and the red material is lead(II,IV) oxide.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1393619", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1393619", "title": "Two truths doctrine", "text": "Two truths doctrine\n\nThe Buddhist doctrine of the two truths () differentiates between two levels of \"satya\" (Sanskrit), meaning truth or \"really existing\" in the discourse of the Buddha: the \"conventional\" or \"provisional\" () truth, and the \"ultimate\" () truth.\n\nThe exact meaning varies between the various Buddhist schools and traditions. The best known interpretation is from the Madhyamaka school of Mahāyāna Buddhism, whose founder was Nagarjuna. For Nagarjuna, the two truths are \"epistemological truths\". The phenomenal world is accorded a provisional existence. The character of the phenomenal world is declared to be neither real nor unreal, but logically indeterminable. Ultimately, phenomena are empty (\"sunyata\") of an inherent self or essence, but exist depending on other phenomena (\"Pratītyasamutpāda\").\n\nIn Chinese Buddhism, the Madhyamaka position is accepted and the two truths refer to two \"ontological truths\". Reality exists of two levels, a relative level and an absolute level. Based on their understanding of the Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra, the Chinese supposed that the teaching of the Buddha-nature was, as stated by that sutra, the final Buddhist teaching, and that there is an essential truth above sunyata and the two truths.\n\nThe doctrine is an attempt to show that it is neither proper nor strictly justifiable to regard any metaphysical system as absolutely valid. It doesn't lead to nihilism but strikes a middle course between excessive naivete and excessive scepticism.\n\n\"Satya\" is usually taken to mean \"truth\", but does also refer to mean \"a reality,\" \"a genuinely real existent.\" \"Satya\" (Sat-yá) is derived from \"Sat\" and \"ya\". \"Sat\" means being, reality, and is the present participle of the root \"as\" \"to be\" (PIE \"\"; cognate to English \"is\"). \"Ya\" and \"yam\" means \"advancing, supporting, hold up, sustain, one that moves\". As a composite word, \"Satya\" and \"Satyam\" imply that \"which supports, sustains and advances reality, being\"; it literally means, \"that which is true, actual, real, genuine, trustworthy, valid\".\n\nThe two truths doctrine states that there is:\n\nChandrakīrti suggests three possible meanings of :\n\nThe conventional truth may be interpreted as \"obscurative truth\" or \"that which obscures the true nature\" as a result. It is constituted by the appearances of mistaken awareness. Conventional truth would be the appearance that includes a duality of apprehender and apprehended, and objects perceived within that. Ultimate truths, are phenomena free from the duality of apprehender and apprehended.\n\nBuddha's teaching of () may be viewed as a path () of release from the anxieties of life. The first Noble Truth equates life-experiences with pain and suffering. Buddha's language was simple and colloquial. Naturally, various statements of Buddha at times appear contradictory to each other. Later Buddhist teachers were faced with the problem of resolving these contradictions. Nagarjuna and other teachers introduced an exegetical technique level-distinction between two levels of truth, the conventional and the ultimate.\n\nA similar method is reflected in the Brahmanical exegesis of the Vedic scriptuires which combine the ritualistic injunctions of the Brahmana and speculative philosophical questions of the Upanishads as one whole 'revealed' body of work thereby contrasting the with .\n\nWhile the concept of the two truths is associated with the Madhyamaka school, its history goes back to the oldest Buddhism.\n\nIn the Pali canon, the distinction is not made between a lower \"truth\" and a higher \"truth\", but rather between two kinds of expressions of the same truth, which must be interpreted differently. Thus a phrase or passage, or a whole sutta, might be classed as \"neyyattha\" or \"samuti\" or \"vohāra\", but it is not regarded at this stage as expressing or conveying a different level of \"truth\".\n\n\"Nītattha\" (Pāli; Sanskrit: \"nītārtha\"), \"of plain or clear meaning\" and \"neyyattha\" (Pāli; Sanskrit: \"neyartha\"), \"[a word or sentence] having a sense that can only be guessed\". These terms were used to identify texts or statements that either did or did not require additional interpretation. A \"nītattha\" text required no explanation, while a \"neyyattha\" one might mislead some people unless properly explained:\n' or ' (Pāli; Sanskrit: \"\", meaning \"common consent, general opinion, convention\", and \"paramattha\" (Pāli; Sanskrit: \"paramārtha\"), meaning \"ultimate\", are used to distinguish conventional or common-sense language, as used in metaphors or for the sake of convenience, from language used to express higher truths directly. The term \"vohāra\" (Pāli; Sanskrit: \"vyavahāra\", \"common practice, convention, custom\" is also used in more or less the same sense as \"samuti\".\n\nThe Theravādin commentators expanded on these categories and began applying them not only to expressions but to the truth then expressed:\nThe Prajñaptivāda school took up the distinction between the conventional and ultimate (\"paramārtha/\"), and extended the concept to metaphysical-phenomenological constituents (\"dharmas\"), distinguishing those that are real (\"tattva\") from those that are purely conceptual, i.e., ultimately nonexistent (\"prajnāpti\").\n\nThe distinction between the two truths (\"satyadvayavibhāga\") was fully developed by Nāgārjuna (c. 150 – c. 250 CE) of the Madhyamaka school. The Madhyamikas distinguish between \"loka-samvriti-satya\", \"world speech truth\" c.q. \"relative truth\" c.q. \"truth that keeps the ultimate truth concealed,\" and \"paramarthika satya\", ultimate truth.\n\n\"Loka-samvriti-satya\" can be further divided in \"tathya-samvrti\" or \"loka-samvrti\", and \"mithya-samvrti\" or \"aloka-samvrti\", \"true samvrti\" and \"false samvrti.\" \"Tathya-samvrti\" or \"true samvrti\" refers to \"things\" which concretely exist and can be perceived as such by the senses, while \"mithya-samvrti\" or \"false samvrti\" refers to false cognitions of \"things\" which do not exist as they are perceived.\n\nNagarjuna's \"Mūlamadhyamakakārikā\" provides a logical defense for the claim that all things are empty (sunyata) of an inherently-existing self-nature. Sunyata, however, is also shown to be \"empty,\" and Nagarjuna's assertion of \"the emptiness of emptiness\" prevents sunyata from constituting a higher or ultimate reality. Nagarjuna's view is that \"the ultimate truth is that there is no ultimate truth\". According to Siderits, Nagarjuna is a \"semantic anti-dualist\" who posits that there are only conventional truths. Jay L. Garfield explains:\nIn Nāgārjuna's \"Mūlamadhyamakakārikā\" the two truths doctrine is used to defend the identification of dependent origination (\"pratītyasamutpāda\") with emptiness (\"śūnyatā\"):\nIn Nagarjuna's own words:\nNāgārjuna based his statement of the two truths on the Kaccāyanagotta Sutta. In the Kaccāyanagotta Sutta, the Buddha, speaking to the monk Kaccayana Gotta on the topic of right view, describes the middle Way between nihilsm and eternalism:\nAccording to Chattopadhyaya, although Nagarjuna presents his understanding of the two truths as a clarification of the teachings of the Buddha, the two truths doctrine as such is not part of the earliest Buddhist tradition.\n\nThe Yogacara school of Buddhism distinguishes the Three Natures and the Trikaya. The Three Natures are:\n\nThe Lankavatara Sutra took an idealistic turn in apprehending reality. D. T. Suzuki writes the following:\nWhen Buddhism came to China from Gandhara (now Afghanistan) and India in the first/second century CE, it was initially adapted to the Chinese culture and understanding. Buddhism was exposed to Confucianist and Taoist influences. Neo-Taoist concepts were taken over in Chinese Buddhism. Concepts such as \"T’i -yung\" (Essence and Function) and \"Li-Shih\" (Noumenon and Phenomenon) were first taken over by Hua-yen Buddhism, which consequently influenced Chán deeply.\n\nThe two truths doctrine was another point of confusion. Chinese thinking took this to refer to two \"ontological truths\": reality exists of two levels, a relative level and an absolute level. Taoists at first misunderstood sunyata to be akin to the Taoist non-being. In Madhyamaka the two truths are two \"epistemological truths\": two different ways to look at reality. Based on their understanding of the Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra the Chinese supposed that the teaching of the Buddha-nature was, as stated by that sutra, the final Buddhist teaching, and that there is an essential truth above sunyata and the two truths.\n\nThe Huayan school or Flower Garland is a tradition of Mahayana Buddhist philosophy that flourished in China during the Tang period. It is based on the Sanskrit Flower Garland Sutra (S. \"Avataṃsaka Sūtra\", C. \"Huayan Jing\") and on a lengthy Chinese interpretation of it, the Huayan Lun. The name Flower Garland is meant to suggest the crowning glory of profound understanding.\n\nThe most important philosophical contributions of the Huayan school were in the area of its metaphysics. It taught the doctrine of the mutual containment and interpenetration of all phenomena, as expressed in Indra's net. One thing contains all other existing things, and all existing things contain that one thing.\n\nDistinctive features of this approach to Buddhist philosophy include:\n\nHuayan teaches the Four Dharmadhatu, four ways to view reality:\n\nThe teachings of Zen are expressed by a set of polarities: Buddha-nature - sunyata, absolute-relative, sudden and gradual enlightenment.\n\nThe Prajnaparamita Sutras and Madhyamaka emphasized the non-duality of form and emptiness: form is emptiness, emptiness is form, as the Heart Sutra says.\nThe idea that the ultimate reality is present in the daily world of relative reality fitted into the Chinese culture which emphasized the mundane world and society. But this does not tell how the absolute is present in the relative world. This question is answered in such schemata as the Five Ranks of Tozan and the Oxherding Pictures.\n\nThe polarity of absolute and relative is also expressed as \"essence-function\". The absolute is essence, the relative is function. They can't be seen as separate realities, but interpenetrate each other. The distinction does not \"exclude any other frameworks such as \"neng-so\" or \"subject-object\" constructions\", though the two \"are completely different from each other in terms of their way of thinking\".\n\nIn Korean Buddhism, essence-function is also expressed as \"body\" and \"the body's functions\":\nA metaphor for essence-function is \"A lamp and its light\", a phrase from the \"Platform Sutra\", where Essence is lamp and Function is light.\n\nThe Nyingma tradition is the oldest of the four major schools of Tibetan Buddhism. It is founded on the first translations of Buddhist scriptures from Sanskrit into Tibetan, in the eighth century. Ju Mipham (1846–1912) in his commentary to the \"Madhyamālaṃkāra\" of Śāntarakṣita (725–788) says:\nThe following sentence from Mipham's exegesis of Śāntarakṣita's\" Madhyamālaṃkāra\" highlights the relationship between the absence of \"the four extremes\" (\"mtha'-bzhi\") and the nondual or \"indivisible two truths\" (\"bden-pa dbyer-med\"):\nDzogchen holds that the two truths are ultimately resolved into non-duality as a lived experience and are non-different.\n\nThe Jain philosopher Kundakunda was influenced by Nagarjuna to develop a Jain version of the theory of two truths. In texts such as Pravacanasāra\n(‘The Essence of the Doctrine’) and Samayasāra (‘The Essence of the Soul’), Kundakunda distinguishes between two perspectives of truth:\n\n\nFor Kundakunda, the mundane realm of truth is also the relative perspective of normal folk, where the workings of karma operate and where things emerge, last for a certain duration and perish. The ultimate perspective meanwhile, is that of the liberated jiva, which is \"blissful, energetic, perceptive, and omniscient\".\n\nAdvaita took over from the Madhyamika the idea of levels of reality. Usually two levels are being mentioned, but Shankara uses sublation as the criterion to postulate an ontological hierarchy of three levels.\n\n\nChattopadhyaya notes that the eighth-century Mīmāṃsā philosopher Kumārila Bhaṭṭa rejected the \"Two Truths Doctrine\" in his \"Shlokavartika\". Bhaṭṭa was highly influential with his defence of the Vedic rituals against medieval Buddhist rejections of these rituals. Some believe that his influence contributed to the decline of Buddhism in India since his lifetime coincides with the period in which Buddhism began to decline. According to Kumarila, the two truths doctrine is an idealist doctrine, which conceals the fact that \"the theory of the nothingness of the objective world\" is absurd:\nMcEvilley (2002) notes a correspondence between Greek Pyrrhonism and Madhyamika doctrines:\n\n"}
{"id": "3980175", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3980175", "title": "Type physicalism", "text": "Type physicalism\n\nType physicalism (also known as reductive materialism, type identity theory, mind–brain identity theory and identity theory of mind) is a physicalist theory, in the philosophy of mind. It asserts that mental events can be grouped into types, and can then be correlated with types of physical events in the brain. For example, one type of mental event, such as \"mental pains\" will, presumably, turn out to be describing one type of physical event (like C-fiber firings).\n\nType physicalism is contrasted by token identity physicalism, which argues that mental events are unlikely to have \"steady\" or categorical biological correlates. These positions make use of the philosophical type–token distinction (e.g., Two persons having the same \"type\" of car need not mean that they share a \"token\", a single vehicle). Type physicalism can now be understood to argue that there is identicalness between types, whereas token identity physicalism says one can only describe a particular, unique, brain event.\n\nThere are other ways a physicalist might criticize type physicalism; eliminative materialism and revisionary materialism question whether science is currently using the best categorisations. In the same way talk of demonic possession was questioned with scientific advance, categorisations like \"pain\" may need to be revised.\n\nAccording to U. T. Place, one of the popularizers of the idea of type-identity in the 1950s and 1960s, the idea of type-identity physicalism originated in the 1930s with the psychologist E. G. Boring and took nearly a quarter of a century to gain acceptance from the philosophical community. Boring, in a book entitled \"The Physical Dimensions of Consciousness\" (1933) wrote that:\n\nTo the author a perfect correlation is identity. Two events that always occur together at the same time in the same place, without any temporal or spatial differentiation at all, are not two events but the same event. The mind-body correlations as formulated at present, do not admit of spatial correlation, so they reduce to matters of simple correlation in time. The need for identification is no less urgent in this case (p. 16, quoted in Place [unpublished]).\n\nThe barrier to the acceptance of any such vision of the mind, according to Place, was that philosophers and logicians had not yet taken a substantial interest in questions of identity and referential identification in general. The dominant epistemology of the logical positivists at that time was phenomenalism, in the guise of the theory of sense-data. Indeed, Boring himself subscribed to the phenomenalist creed, attempting to reconcile it with an identity theory and this resulted in a \"reductio ad absurdum\" of the identity theory, since brain states would have turned out, on this analysis, to be identical to colors, shapes, tones and other sensory experiences.\n\nThe revival of interest in the work of Gottlob Frege and his ideas of sense and reference on the part of Herbert Feigl and J.J.C. Smart, along with the discrediting of phenomenalism through the influence of the later Wittgenstein and J.L. Austin, led to a more tolerant climate toward physicalistic and realist ideas. Logical behaviorism emerged as a serious contender to take the place of the Cartesian \"ghost in the machine\" and, although not lasting very long as a dominant position on the mind/body problem, its elimination of the whole realm of internal mental events was strongly influential in the formation and acceptance of the thesis of type identity.\n\nThere were actually subtle but interesting differences between the three most widely credited formulations of the type-identity thesis, those of Place, Feigl and Smart which were published in several articles in the late 1950s. However, all of the versions share the central idea that the mind is identical to something physical.\n\nU. T. Place's (1956) notion of the relation of identity was derived from Bertrand Russell's distinction among several types of \"is\" statements: the \"is\" of identity, the \"is\" of equality and the \"is\" of composition. Place's version of the relation of identity is more accurately described as a relation of composition. For Place, higher-level mental events are composed out of lower-level physical events and will eventually be analytically reduced to these. So, to the objection that \"sensations\" do not mean the same thing as \"mental processes\", Place could simply reply with the example that \"lightning\" does not mean the same thing as \"electrical discharge\" since we determine that something is lightning by looking and seeing it, whereas we determine that something is an electrical discharge through experimentation and testing. Nevertheless, \"lightning is an electrical discharge\" is true since the one is composed of the other.\n\nFor Feigl (1957) and Smart (1959), on the other hand, the identity was to be interpreted as the identity between the referents of two descriptions (senses) which referred to the same thing, as in \"the morning star\" and \"the evening star\" both referring to Venus, a necessary identity. So to the objection about the lack of equality of meaning between \"sensation\" and \"brain process\", their response was to invoke this Fregean distinction: \"sensations\" and \"brain\" processes do indeed \"mean\" different things but they refer to the same physical phenomenon. Moreover, \"sensations are brain processes\" is a contingent, not a necessary, identity.\n\nOne of the most influential and common objections to the type identity theory is the argument from multiple realizability. The multiple realizability thesis asserts that mental states can be realized in multiple kinds of systems, not just brains, for example. Since the identity theory identifies mental events with certain brain states, it does not allow for mental states to be realized in organisms or computational systems that do not have a brain. This is in effect an argument that the identity theory is too narrow because it does not allow for organisms without brains to have mental states. However, \"token identity\" (where only particular tokens of mental states are identical with particular tokens of physical events) and functionalism both account for multiple realizability.\n\nThe response of type identity theorists, such as Smart, to this objection is that, while it may be true that mental events are multiply realizable, this does not demonstrate the falsity of type identity. As Smart states:\n\nThe fundamental point is that it is extremely difficult to determine where, on the continuum of first order processes, type identity ends and merely token identities begin. Take Quine's example of English country gardens. In such gardens, the tops of hedges are cut into various shapes, for example the shape of an elf. We can make generalizations over the type \"elf-shaped hedge\" only if we abstract away from the concrete details of the individual twigs and branches of each hedge. So, whether we say that two things are of the same type or are tokens of the same type because of subtle differences is just a matter of descriptive abstraction. The type-token distinction is not all or nothing.\n\nHilary Putnam essentially rejects functionalism because, he believes, it is indeed a second-order type identity theory. Putnam uses multiple realizability against functionalism itself, suggesting that mental events (or kinds, in Putnam's terminology) may be diversely implemented by diverse functional/computational kinds; there may be only a token identification between particular mental kinds and particular functional kinds. Putnam, and many others who have followed him, now tend to identify themselves as generically non-reductive physicalists. Putnam's invocation of multiple realizability does not, of course, directly answer the problem raised by Smart with respect to useful generalizations over types and the flexible nature of the type-token distinction in relation to causal taxonomies in science.\n\nAnother frequent objection is that type identity theories fail to account for phenomenal mental states (or qualia), such as having a pain, feeling sad, experiencing nausea. (Qualia are merely the subjective qualities of conscious experience. An example is the way the pain of jarring ones elbow \"feels\" to the individual.) Arguments can be found in Saul Kripke (1972) and David Chalmers (1996), for example, according to which the identity theorist cannot identify phenomenal mental states with brain states (or any other physical state for that matter) because one has a sort of direct awareness of the nature of such qualitative mental states, and their nature is qualitative in a way that brain states are not.\n\nA famous formulation of the qualia objection comes from Frank Jackson (1982) in the form of the Mary's room thought experiment. Let us suppose, Jackson suggests, that a particularly brilliant super-scientist named Mary has been locked away in a completely black-and-white room her entire life. Over the years in her colour-deprived world she has studied (via black-and-white books and television) the sciences of neurophysiology, vision and electromagnetics to their fullest extent; eventually Mary comes to know all the physical facts there are to know about experiencing colour. When Mary is released from her room and experiences colour for the first time, does she learn something new? If we answer \"yes\" (as Jackson suggests we do) to this question, then we have supposedly denied the truth of type physicalism, for if Mary has exhausted all the physical facts about experiencing colour prior to her release, then her subsequently acquiring some new piece of information about colour upon experiencing its quale reveals that there must be something about the experience of colour which is not captured by the physicalist picture. (See Mary's room page for full discussion).\n\nThe type identity theorist, such as Smart, attempts to explain away such phenomena by insisting that the experiential properties of mental events are \"topic-neutral\". The concept of topic-neutral terms and expressions goes back to Gilbert Ryle, who identified such topic-neutral terms as \"if\", \"or\", \"not\", \"because\" and \"and.\" If one were to hear these terms alone in the course of a conversation, it would be impossible to tell whether the topic under discussion concerned geology, physics, history, gardening, or selling pizza. For the identity theorist, sense-data and qualia are not real things in the brain (or the physical world in general) but are more like \"the average electrician.\" The average electrician can be further analyzed and explained in terms of real electricians but is not itself a real electrician.\n\n\n\n"}

The Dervishes were practically indispensable in the early campaigns to liberate Somalia from both the Anglo-Ethiopian and the Anglo-Italian conspiracies by which Somali-lands were surreptitiously divided and transferred.\n\nThere are several books which discuss the political relationship, which had continued between 1899 -1905 after the Warsangeli embraced the Dervish ideals of a united Somali state. Among them are two books authored by Faarax MJ Cawl, including \"Garbaduubkii gumeysiga\" or the \"Shackles of Colonialism\" and \"Ignorance is the enemy Of love.\" Andrzejewski, in his review of the latter book, writes,\n\n\"The plot unfolds against the background of Somali national history in the first quarter of this century, when members of a Muslim Brotherhood, who called themselves “Dervishes”, were fighting against the foreign powers which had partitioned the Somali territories, and against those of their compatriots who had accepted colonial rule. The struggle was led by Maxamed Cabdule Xasan (1898-1921), who was a Muslim revivalist reformed as well as a nationalist leader\"\n\nAs usually presented by contemporary historians, the Warsangeli initially supported the Dervishes from 1899 until 1905. Later, the Warsangeli splintered into several strong factions, only one-third of which supported the reign of Sultan Mohamoud Ali Shire, who took over the sultanate from his ailing father and powerful Garad, Ali Shirreh. He was a Dervish himself but later turned against Sayid Mohammed because:\n\n\"The two could not see eye to eye on many political, religious and social issues, and the Sultan fiercely defended the independence of his Sultanate against the incursions of the Dervish Movement.\" \nAccording to files concerning the Sultan referred to in Ray Beachey's book \"The Warrior Mullah\", the three major fronts of the Dervishes were the\nThe Dervish movement also had a great deal of influence in central (Mudug) and southern Somalia (Jubaland). The joint resistance by the Aulihan (Ogaden) and the Marehan challenged the Italian and British administrations in Jubaland and Mudug.\n\nThe Sultan was indeed an amazing authority figure and a lot of people believed him to be some type of a saint. He survived many battles including the battle in which the Dervishes seized control of Las Qorey. He was said to have marched through the Dervish legion while wearing a white turban—in disguise, according to oral testimonies. The English at the time described him as a \"Man of unusual influence\", \"A man of mercurial image\" and \"A man of unusual strength\".\n\nThe Warsangeli were divided into three groups: The army of the Sultanate in Sanaag, Dervishes with strong bases in Badhan and Buraan, and the army of Gerad Dhahar in the Bari region. The Warsangeli sultanate had had no authority over all the clans of Warsangeli. The man whom the English colony conspired to deport to Mombasa was Dhahar but he escaped and returned as a hero.\n\nTherefore, The largest three army units of the Dervishes were divided into three major sections.\n\nThe largest unit assigned to Jidali and Xiis all the way to Burco. They were given those areas. Maarre is an etymology that stands for \"those equipped with rifles\"(Dhulbahante, mostly Mohamoud Gard, and part of Warsenge;li Reer saalax.)\n\nThe second largest unit. This etymology stands for those with many eyes or \"vigilant ones. They were assigned to Badhan, Laasqorey, Ceelaayo, Qaw and Boosaaso. They were 95% Warsangeli, mostly Dubeys, Bihi door, Reer saalax & Garabsare.\n\nGarbo is the third largest unit. Mostly Bahgeri, Farah Garad,(Adan Madoobe) Subclan if HabarJeclo and other clans. The etymology suggests \"shoulders\" or the backs of pack animals. They carried heavy equipment and large amount of booty. They were assigned to the Ethiopian border and Berbera.\n\nThe Indhabaddan unit succeeded once in capturing the above towns but was defeated by the Sultan of Warsangeli and Boqor Cisman army with the help of Italy and Britain. Without the colonial support, they would not have been defeated. The interest of those sultanates was all about securing their dominion from any outside and direct rule, so they were content with the indirect rule of the colony. This Sayid opposed.\n\n\n"}
