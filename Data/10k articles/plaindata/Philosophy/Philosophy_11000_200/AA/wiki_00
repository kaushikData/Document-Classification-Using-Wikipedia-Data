{"id": "16972944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16972944", "title": "Achievement ideology", "text": "Achievement ideology\n\nAchievement Ideology is the belief that one reaches a socially perceived definition of success through hard work and education. In this view, factors such as gender, race/ethnicity, economic background, social networks, or neighborhoods/geography are secondary to hard work and education or are altogether irrelevant in the pursuit of success.\n\nIn 2002, Sandra L. Barnes, offered that people who believe in the American achievement ideology most likely blame underachievement on attitudinal or moral differences among individuals. For those who disagree with the achievement ideology, this difference in attitude is most likely the result of an oppositional response to negative institutional and structural forces. In her study, Barnes found that those who most benefit from achievement ideology (white males in higher class neighborhoods, for example) are most likely to espouse the achievement ideology. For example, African Americans are more likely than whites to believe that race is an ascribed trait that helps some achieve success more easily than others, and those with higher incomes are more likely to claim that having a strong social network is an unimportant factor for success. All respondent groups, however, believe that education and hard work are most important for success, proving that achievement ideology is alive and well. Ultimately, Barnes argues that success is best reached when one has an achievement-oriented attitude coupled with the actual ability to accomplish one's goals. While most people might have the proper attitude, structural factors can keep them from achieving.\n\nDonna Y. Ford sought to discover the differences in ideologies between male and female and gifted and nongifted African American students. Ford describes four theories related to achievement ideology – need achievement, text anxiety, social learning and attribution theories:\n\nSocial scientists who advocate this theory believe that one's achievement is a product of the motivation to succeed times the motivation to avoid failure. This means that individuals weigh their expectancy of success with the value they place on that success, or, how well an individual thinks s/he can do and how much doing well actually matters.\n\nAs with need achievement theory, social scientists who support test anxiety theory look to how a student evaluates her/his ability to succeed. Students who are preoccupied with the outcome of their performance, who fear failure or humiliation if they do not perform well, might not perform well because this anxiety stifles their performance.\n\nIn this theory, students are socialized from an early age and hold different expectations or values based on their own experience or social situation. According to this theory, students who are raised in an atmosphere of underachievement, who often see previous generations and family members not succeed, will most likely internalize these values and perceive their own success as unlikely.\n\nThis theory explains a lack of motivation in students as a result of the students' belief in achievement ideology. When students attribute their own failure to a lack of ability, they consequently are less likely to expect to do well. If a student fully believes in the achievement ideology, failure can only be a result of lack of ability or lack of effort.\n\nFord claims that, while these four theories may explain underachievement in some students, they only focus on students' lack of motivation to achieve and do not consider a student's failure despite her/his desire to achieve. She describes this as the \"paradox of underachievement,\" a discrepancy between a student's ideology and their actual achievement (i.e., when students do not do well in school despite their support of the achievement ideology). In her study, the majority of both gifted and nongifted African American students claimed that school is \"very important.\" The majority of male and female African American students alike responded that school was important or very important. If this is true that most students are, in fact, motivated and view school as important for success, a student's failure must be explained by some other variable—most likely ascribed variables like race/ethnicity, gender, and so on.\n\nBelief in the American achievement ideology causes employers to look to an individual's educational success as the key factor in hiring potential employees because achievement ideology perpetuates the notion that those who have succeeded educationally are the most hard working. In \"Education and Jobs\", Ivar Berg writes, \"The increase in educational requirements for middle-level jobs…may thus be taking place at some cost to a society that has historically prided itself on its mobility opportunities.\" This process causes America's education system to act more like a \"licensing agency\" rather than promoting education for education's sake. This, in turn, causes many employees to be overqualified for their jobs.\n\nWhen jobs gradually require higher and higher educational attainment as a prerequisite, the effort put into achieving these prerequisites (or, the effort put into school) does not equal the needed effort or skill at one's job. Thus, workers' endorsement of achievement ideology decreases each year that s/he remains in a particular job for which s/he is overqualified. In other words, employees begin to see the effort they put forth in school as unnecessary.\n\nJay MacLeod studied two groups of boys and young men who lived in a low-income neighborhood for his book, \"Ain't No Makin' It\". The \"Hallway Hangers,\" a group of mostly white boys, did not endorse meritocracy, the American achievement ideology. MacLeod found that their skepticism was a result of several factors. First, although the Hallway Hangers' parents wanted their children to do well, they knew from their own experience that encouraging high aspirations would only set them up for failure and disappointment. Both parents and children were affected by the environment of underachievement. \n\nThe Hallway Hangers and their parents rejected the achievement ideology because they did not see job success through hard work to be a likely outcome in their situation, a situation in which few family members ever succeeded financially, where job opportunities were few and where hard work in school rarely influenced employability. Moreover, if the Hallway Hangers were to accept the achievement ideology, this would logically entail the belief that their parents had not succeeded financially because they were lazy or unintelligent. The Hallway Hangers knew this was not true. Ironically, though the caucasian Hallway Hangers understood that the achievement ideology was false in their case, they were not able to understand that it was equally false in the case of African Americans. The Hallway Hangers were kept from this understanding by their belief in another powerful American ideology, that of racism and the intellectual inferiority of Blacks. Whereas the Hallway Hangers recognized that they failed to succeed financially because of their position in the lower class, they could not see that class exploitation was also responsible for the financial failure of African Americans. In addition to attributing inferiority to African Americans, the Hallway Hangers also scapegoated them, blaming them for taking all of the jobs that they, as white, believed they deserved.\n\nMacLeod's analysis is completed by the analysis of a second group that called itself \"The Brothers\". Composed of African-American young men, The Brothers lived in the same housing project as the Hallway Hangers. They, however, did endorse meritocracy, the American ideology of achievement. The Brothers understood the racial situation in America to have been vastly improved since the time of their parents. This led them to the belief that each generation of Blacks had worked harder than the last: if they did the same, they would be able to do well in school and succeed in the workforce. Though The Brothers lived in the same housing project, they had done so for far less time than the Hallway Hangers: some of their families had resided in \"Clarendon Heights\" for three generations. Many of The Brothers had moved to the housing project from far worse situations and even poorer neighborhoods. Their recent arrival caused them to think that they were upwardly mobile. Due to their optimism, they were much more likely than the Hallway Hangers to find viable employment after school. Their belief in meritocracy, and their hard work in school, allowed them to overcome the racism and class structures that defeated their aspirations in the outside world. The Brothers knew that the Hallway Hangers' ideology of racial inferiority was false, and they were themselves saved by the ideology to which the Hallway Hangers were immune, that of meritocracy, equal opportunity for all.\n"}

From 1893 to 1897 he undertook religious studies in four European countries. In 1897 he applied for a position as professor of church history at the Royal Frederick University, but he was rejected as the assessment committee found that he was \"deviating from the faith of our Church\", and hence was \"unfit\" to lecture for priestly candidates.\n\nAfter this he studied philosophy in the United Kingdom and experimental psychology in Germany. He was elected as a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters already in 1898. He published several works, including the 1903 thesis \"Über die Wirkung der Wiederholung eines Elementes bei gleichzeitiger Vorführung mehrerer Schriftzeichen\". He worked as a lecturer at the University of Halle-Wittenberg from 1904 to 1908. He was appointed as a professor of philosophy at the Royal Frederick University in 1908. In addition to researching philosophy, he published works on the history of ideas, and also helped create the Department of Philosophy, which he led until his retirement in 1937.

One will be drawn to another; that star will grow and pull in still more and more. In time, everything must be drawn in. \"According to Newton, each star in the universe ought to be attracted towards every other star. They should not remain motionless, at a constant distance from each other, but should all fall together to some central point. Newton admitted as much in a letter to Richard Bentley, a leading Cambridge philosopher of the time.\" Newton solved the paradox by claiming that God prevented the collapse by making \"constant minute corrections\".

He joined the Faculty of Arts at Exeter University in 1995 where in 2004 he created the Centre for Latin American Studies. In 2009 he was appointed Visiting Professor at Birkbeck College. He is also Associated Researcher at the Université Catholique de Louvain-la-Neuve in Belgium.\n\nIn 2012 he started to supervise and teach within the postgraduate program from the Universidad Nacional de Quilmes and from Universidad Nacional de Buenos Aires, both in Argentina.

In 2014 he started to work within a multinational team of researchers and ONGs in a multidisciplinary project about climate change in relation with colonialism and geo-epistemology. In 2015 he started also to teach philosophy at the Lycée Stendhal (Aiguillon) and at the Lycée George Sand (Nérac), both in France.\n\nA. The principal effort of his work goes to establish the relation between knowledge and conceptual evolution, mainly focused on theories and related concepts about space with peripheral areas of the planet or, more precisely, having the peripheral spaces of the planet as its main intellectual frame. Themes of his works also include sociology of knowledge (Muerte y transfiguración de la cultura rioplatense, 2005), epistemology and colonialism, authorship theory (The Manufacture of an Author, 2000; El mundo Ingaramo, 2015), and science and writing.\n\nCiencia y escritura (2003)\nThe book discusses how the activity of writing determines the notion of knowledge which supports the ‘ideology’ of scientificity. Further more, the book explores how, when and why, the laboratory becomes the center of legitimization of modern science. To illustrate the argument, specific as well as generic leading cases, were explored. An article discussing the so-called ‘two-slit experiment’ is the first leading case, and an exhaustive analysis of the journal Nature constitutes the second leading case.\n\nGeo-epistemology (2009)\nThe idea that we cannot establish a critical way of thinking, at least within peripheral areas of the planet, without having a standing in biosphere terms is the main hypothesis of this book. This work attempts to show how to proceed under these premises.\n\nLa emancipación intelectual (2010-2011) (unpublished)\nA tetralogy about Latin America, which concentrates in the conceptual consequences of language, knowledge, colonialism and what the author calls post-territoriality. This work also this work develops the idea of a second degree of colonialism, which refers to a number of objects, domains and concepts -highly productive in terms of knowledge and understanding- where colonialism is not usually analyzed. The first volume of these analyses on contemporary colonialism within peripheral places, from the point of view of knowledge and diaspora, is entitled ‘Viaje en Egipto. La formulación espacial del colonialismo y sus consecuencias’ [Travel within Egypt. The spatial formulation of colonialism and its consequences]. The second volume, entitled ‘El pensamiento del ojo en las colonias. La formulación espacial del colonialismo y sus visiones’ [The eye’s thought.

The third volume, entitled ‘El autor periférico. La formulación espacial del colonialismo y sus identidades’ [The peripheral author. The spatial formulation of colonialism and its identities], focus on the constitution of a parallel phenomenon: the constitution of the notion of self and the constitution of a narrative entity usually called authorship. Finally, the fourth volume, entitled ‘La negociación del espacio y los sentimientos bajo el colonialism’ [The negotiation of space and feelings under the colonialism], focus on the way the constitution of a sentimental life within individuals in peripheral areas of the planet is dominated by technological set-ups referred to a number of activities, from writing to learning, and from eating to building houses.\n\nEl imaginario Patagonia (2011)\nHow the relation between biosphere spaces and conceptual evolution works, within peripheral areas of the planet, is the main topic of this book. To explore the argument an exhaustive and length argumentation concerning Patagonia has been established as the leading case.\nB. The notion of ‘pensamiento periférico’ emerges as a way to develop the ‘reversal thinking’ and proposed as a first approximation to the geo-epistemology approach. Developed in a four-volumes series between 2015 and 2018 it has one volume dedicated to the relation of peripheral ‘pensamiento’ with the European philosophy and its history; a second volume which attempts to establish a general conceptual framework, a third volume revisiting the notion of anthropology and nature, and a final volume which explores a leading case focusing on the idea of ‘disposal, trash, rubbish, dust’ (basura, residuo) as an epistemic and anthropological problem. \n\nLa cuestión periférica (forthcoming)\nHow, when and under which format the ways of thinking in peripheral areas of the planet have been colonized not only by European philosophy but mainly by the way in which such philosophy has been studied, developed and historiographisized, even locally: such questions are conceptually addressed in this book and constitute its main purpose.\n\nEl mundo de atrás (2018)\nThe book develops the main conceptual frame under which the ‘pensamiento’ as a way to combine a thought about ‘things’ (bodies, apparatuses, objects, mechanisms), technology and a biosphere dimension can be established in peripheral areas of the planet.\n\nEl fin de la naturaleza (forthcoming)\nWhat is the relation between the anthropological concept of human, within peripheral areas of the planet, and a notion of nature is the main question of this book. The increasing relevance of the non-human in the definition of human is one of the phenomena explored within the arguments, as well as the radical change of the idea of ‘viviente’ (living thing).\n\nEl pensamiento basura (2017)\nHow the ‘basura’ (trash, disposals, rubbish) becomes a central component of our daily life is as important as its consequences in material and non-material terms. From this starting point the book explores what and in which way the ‘basura’ determines our way of thinking, our individuality, as well as our material existence in peripheral areas of the planet.\n\nIn 2012, after been successively leaving in Rimini, Bologna, London, Exeter and Brussels, he moved to the countryside in South of France, where he started to rebuild a 12th-century property together with his partner and their three daughters.

Coreference (or coindexation) that is normal and natural when a pronoun follows its antecedent becomes impossible, or at best just marginally possible, when \"crossover\" is deemed to have occurred, e.g. \"?Who do his friends admire __?\" The term itself refers to the traditional transformational analysis of sentences containing leftward movement (e.g. wh-movement, topicalization), whereby it appears as though the fronted constituent crosses over the expression (usually a pronoun) with which it is coindexed on its way to the front of the clause. Crossover effects are divided into strong crossover (SCO) and weak crossover (WCO). The phenomenon occurs in English and related languages, and it may be present in all natural languages that allow fronting.\n\nThe following sentences illustrate crossover phenomena. The a-sentences are questions in which crossover has not occurred and are given here for the sake of comparison, and the b-sentences illustrate crossover. The subscripts mark coindexation (≈coreference); they indicate that the words bearing the subscripts are supposed to refer to the same one person. The gaps in the b-sentences mark the canonical position of the wh-expression (before movement):\n\nThe acceptability contrast here is curious upon first analysis. In both the a- and b-sentences, the order of the wh-expression and the coindexed pronoun is the same, the wh-expression preceding the pronoun. But only the reading indicated with the a-sentences is (fully) possible. The relevant difference is that in the b-sentences, the wh-expression appears to have been moved across the pronoun on its way to the front of the sentence, whereas there is no such crossover in the a-sentences.\n\nAs just indicated by the examples, there are two types of crossover, strong and weak. The following two sections consider each of these types.\n\nStrong crossover occurs when the pronoun is in an argument position, i.e. it is an argument of the relevant verb. This means that it is not contained inside a noun phrase. Instances of strong crossover are clearly impossible, that is, the coreferential reading is strongly unavailable, e.g.\n\nWhile these sentences are actually grammatical, the reading indicated by the subscripts is robustly unavailable. For instance, the first sentence (sentence a) cannot be interpreted to mean that Susan told them to vote for herself (i.e. Susan).\n\nCrossover is \"weak\" when the coreferential reading is marginal, that is, when the coreferential reading is not clearly unacceptable, but rather just quite unlikely. Typical cases of weak crossover occur when the expression that has been \"crossed over\" is a possessor inside a noun phrase, e.g.\n\nThe pronoun that has been crossed over in each of these examples is embedded inside a noun phrase. For some reason that has to do with binding possibilities, such cases of crossover are not impossible, but rather just unlikely. In other words, the coreferential reading can actually occur. Semantics and pragmatics seems to play a major role determining the likelihood of this reading.\n\nCrossover is a particular manifestation of binding, which is one of the most explored and discussed areas of theoretical syntax. The factors that determine when the coreferential reading is possible have been extensively debated. Simple linear order plays a role, but the other key factor might be c-command as associated (primarily) with government and binding, or it might be o-command as associated with head-driven phrase structure grammar. Weak crossover is also interesting with respect to how it interacts with parasitic gaps. A parasitic gap can obviate what would otherwise be an occurrence of weak crossover.\n\n"}

He had the reputation of being one of the most eminent logicians of his time. His knowledge of philosophy was both extensive and profound. He taught philosophy at Orange, at Nismes, and at Geneva. He inclined to the doctrines of Gassendi rather than to those of the Cartesian philosophy. He had frequent discussions with the followers of Descartes. He kept up a close correspondence with many learned men of his time, particularly with Galileo and Descartes.\n\nWe find from his writings, that he admitted the truth of Aristotle's general principles, and made them the foundation of his public lectures on philosophy. Matter and form, the different principles of causation, the division of the soul into the vegetable, the sensitive, and the rational, may all be found in the speculations of Derodon. His great delight lay, however, in argumentation. His agreement with any system was only conditional and formal; he always had innumerable objections to every thing he seemed to acquiesce in. Hence his contention with the predicaments of Aristotle; his attempted refutation of the term universal; and the contrasts he instituted between the whole system of the Stagirite, and the philosophical opinions of Plato, Democritus, Epicurus, and many other distinguished men of antiquity.\n\nDerodon took great delight in discussions on the nature of \"genus\" and \"species\", and on those curious and puzzling questions which go under the name of the \"Cross of Logicians\". The following are some of the debatable points. \"The term genus cannot be defined, for the definition must necessarily involve the thing to be defined. Genus is an individual, for it is numerically \"one\". Genus is a species; but species is not a genus; therefore, species is more general than genus.\"\n\nDerodon enters into long discussions on the nature of being, and the peculiar province of reason. His writings are both ill-arranged and obscure. In the course of his disquisitions on these points, we find the author zealously attached to the old maxim, \"that there is nothing in the understanding which was not first in the senses\". This he considers as a fundamental principle in all rational systems of speculative philosophy.\n\nHis metaphysics were, however, of a scholastic nature, and present a curious compound from the speculations of the Arabian philosophers, the early Scholastic divines, and some of the writers among the Dominicans of Spain.\n\nHe wrote a considerable number of works against the doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church, which had a wide circulation, and were translated into several foreign languages. Among them were \"Quatre raisons pour lesquelles on doit quitter la R. P. R.\" (Paris, 1631); \"Quatre raisons qui traitent de l'eucharistie, du purgatoire, du péché originel et de la prédestination\" (1662), and \"Le Tombeau de la Messe\" (Geneva, 1654), a translation of which was issued at London in 1673, with this rather premature title, \"The Funeral of the Mass, or the Mass Dead and Buried without Hope of Resurrection.\" The latter book was burned on March 6, 1063, by the public executioner, the author exiled, and the bookseller sentenced to a fine of 1000 livres, the loss of his license, and ten years exile. This last work procured his banishment from France, upon which he withdrew to Geneva.\n\nHe is also the author of several works on philosophical subjects, and against the atheists amongst which may be mentioned, \"Dispute de la Messe\", \"La Lumière de la raison opposée aux ténèbres de l'impiété\", \"De Existentia Dei\", \"Logica Restituta\". His complete works were collected into two volumes, and published soon after his death (\"Derodonis Opera Omnia\", Geneva, 1664 and 1669, 2 vols.; the first volume contains the philosophical, and the second the theological writings).\n\nHe died at Geneva in 1664.\n\n\n"}

Pearce calls this the \"abolitionist project\".\n\nIn 1995 Pearce set up BLTC Research, a network of websites publishing texts about transhumanism and related topics in pharmacology and biopsychiatry. (BLTC initially stood for Better Living Through Chemistry.) He published \"The Hedonistic Imperative\" that year, arguing that \"[o]ur post-human successors will rewrite the vertebrate genome, redesign the global ecosystem, and abolish suffering throughout the living world.\"\n\nPearce's ideas inspired an abolitionist school of transhumanism, or \"hedonistic transhumanism\", based on his idea of \"paradise engineering\" and his argument that the abolition of suffering—which he calls the \"abolitionist project\"—is a moral imperative. He defends a version of negative utilitarianism:\nEthical negative-utilitarianism ... attaches value in a distinctively \"moral\" sense of the term only to actions which tend to minimise or eliminate suffering. ... It stems from a deep sense of compassion at the sheer scale and intensity of suffering in the world. No amount of happiness or fun enjoyed by some organisms can notionally justify the indescribable horrors of Auschwitz. Nor can it outweigh the sporadic frightfulness of pain and despair that occurs every second of every day.\n\nOutlining how drugs and technologies, including intracranial self-stimulation (\"wireheading\"), designer drugs and genetic engineering, could end suffering for all sentient life, Pearce believes that \"over the next thousand years or so, the biological substrates of suffering will be eradicated completely.\" Mental suffering will be a relic of the past, just as physical suffering during surgery was eliminated by anaesthesia. The function of pain will be provided by some other signal, without the unpleasant experience. Using paradise engineering, human beings will be \"animated by gradients of genetically preprogrammed bliss orders of magnitude richer than anything physiologically accessible today.\" \n\nA vegan, Pearce argues that humans have a responsibility not only to avoid cruelty to animals within human society but also to redesign the global ecosystem so that animals do not suffer in the wild. He has argued in favour of a \"cross-species global analogue of the welfare state\", suggesting that humanity might eventually \"reprogram predators\" to limit predation, reducing the suffering of prey animals. Fertility regulation could maintain herbivore populations at sustainable levels, \"a more civilised and compassionate policy option than famine, predation, and disease\". The increasing number of vegans and vegetarians in the transhumanism movement has been attributed in part to Pearce's influence.\n\nIn 1998 Pearce co-founded the World Transhumanist Association, known from 2008 as Humanity+, with Nick Bostrom, now the director of the Future of Humanity Institute at the University of Oxford. Humanity+ is an international nonprofit membership organization that \"advocates the ethical use of technology to expand human capacities.\" Pearce is a member of the board of advisors.\n\nPearce is also a fellow of the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies, and sits on the futurist advisory board of the Lifeboat Foundation. Until 2013 he was on the editorial advisory board of \"Medical Hypotheses\". He has been interviewed by \"Vanity Fair\" (Germany) and on BBC Radio 4's \"The Moral Maze\", among others.\n\n"}

Dark matter was postulated by F. Zwicky in 1933 who noticed the failure of the velocity curves of stars to decrease when plotted as functions of their distance from the center of galaxies. Since Einstein's work, our universe is described by four-dimensional spacetime whose metric is calculable by the Einstein field equations:\nHere is the Ricci curvature tensor, the scalar curvature, the metric tensor, Newton's gravitational constant, the speed of light in vacuum, and the stress–energy tensor. The constant is the so-called cosmological constant.\n\nWhile WIMPs would be elementary particles described by the standard model that can in principle be studied by experimentalists in laboratories such as CERN, the proposed particles called GIMPs would follow the Vacuum Solutions of Einstein's equation. They are just singular structures of spacetime in a geometry whose average forms the dark energy that Einstein expressed in his cosmological constant. The identification of \"dark matter\" with GIMPs proposed makes dark matter a form of dark energy filled with singularites, i.e., an entangled dark energy. This would roughly confirm Einstein's hope in 1919 that all particles in the universe would follow the traceless version of his equation. If we identify all matter as the sum of dark energy plus dark matter in the form of GIMPs, his expectation would turn out to have been \"almost\" right. Matter would play a similar role as the point charges in the homogenous Maxwell equation formula_1 in which delta functions are ignored. The sum of dark matter plus dark energy makes up 76% of all matter, which is sufficient to allow computer simulations to produce a good impression of the behavior of all matter.\n"}
{"id": "320033", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=320033", "title": "Habitat conservation", "text": "Habitat conservation\n\nHabitat conservation is a management practice that seeks to conserve, protect and restore habitat areas for wild plants and animals, especially conservation reliant species, and prevent their extinction, fragmentation or reduction in range. It is a priority of many groups that cannot be easily characterized in terms of any one ideology.\n\nFor much of human history, \"nature\" had been seen as a resource, one that could be controlled by the government and used for personal and economic gain. The idea was that plants only existed to feed animals and animals only existed to feed humans. The land itself had limited value only extending to the resources it could provide such as minerals and oil.\n\nThroughout the 18th and 19th centuries social views started to change and scientific conservation principles were first practically applied to the forests of British India. The conservation ethic that began to evolve included three core principles: that human activity damaged the environment, that there was a civic duty to maintain the environment for future generations, and that scientific, empirically based methods should be applied to ensure this duty was carried out. Sir James Ranald Martin was prominent in promoting Pbnjbthis ideology, publishing many medico-topographical reports that demonstrated the scale of damage wrought through large-scale deforestation and desiccation, and lobbying extensively for the institutionalization of forest conservation activities in British India through the establishment of Forest Departments.\n\nThe Madras Board of Revenue started local conservation efforts in 1842, headed by Alexander Gibson, a professional botanist who systematically adopted a forest conservation program based on scientific principles. This was the first case of state conservation management of forests in the world. Governor-General Lord Dalhousie introduced the first permanent and large-scale forest conservation program in the world in 1855, a model that soon spread to other colonies, as well the United States, where Yellowstone National Park was opened in 1872 as the world’s first national park.\n\nRather than focusing on the economic or material benefits associated with nature, humans began to appreciate the value of nature itself and the need to protect pristine wilderness. By the middle of the 20th century countries such as the United States, Canada, and Britain understood this appreciation and instigated laws and legislation in order to ensure that the most fragile and beautiful environments would be protected for generations to come. \nToday with the help of NGO’s, not-for profit organizations and governments worldwide there is a stronger movement taking place, with a deeper understanding of habitat conservation with the aim of protecting delicate habitats and preserving biodiversity on a global scale. The commitment and actions of small volunteering association in villages and towns, that endeavour to emulate the work done by well known Conservation Organisations, is paramount in ensuring generations that follow understand the importance of conserving natural resources. A village conservation group with the mission statement \"We are committed to protecting and enhancing the natural environment in and around the adjoining villages of Ouston and Urpeth.\" may one day inspire a child who becomes the employee of a worldwide conservation organisation.\n\nThe natural environment is a source for a wide range of resources that can be exploited for economic profit, for example timber is harvested from forests and clean water is obtained from natural streams. However, land development from anthropogenic economic growth often causes a decline in the ecological integrity of nearby natural habitat. For instance, this was an issue in the northern rocky mountains of the USA.\n\nHowever, there is also economic value in conserving natural habitats. Financial profit can be made from tourist revenue, for example in the tropics where species diversity is high, or in recreational sports which take place in natural environments such as hiking and mountain biking. The cost of repairing damaged ecosystems is considered to be much higher than the cost of conserving natural ecosystems.\n\nMeasuring the worth of conserving different habitat areas is often criticized as being too utilitarian from a philosophical point of view.\n\nHabitat conservation is important in maintaining biodiversity, an essential part of global food security. There is evidence to support a trend of accelerating erosion of the genetic resources of agricultural plants and animals. An increase in genetic similarity of agricultural plants and animals means an increased risk of food loss from major epidemics. Wild species of agricultural plants have been found to be more resistant to disease, for example the wild corn species Teosinte is resistant to 4 corn diseases that affect human grown crops. A combination of seed banking and habitat conservation has been proposed to maintain plant diversity for food security purposes.\n\nPearce and Moran outlined the following method for classifying environmental uses:\n\nHabitat loss and destruction can occur both naturally and through anthropogenic causes. Events leading to natural habitat loss include climate change, catastrophic events such as volcanic explosions and through the interactions of invasive and non-invasive species. Natural climate change, events have previously been the cause of many widespread and large scale losses in habitat. For example, some of the mass extinction events generally referred to as the \"Big Five\" have coincided with large scale such as the Earth entering an ice age, or alternate warming events. Other events in the big five also have their roots in natural causes, such as volcanic explosions and meteor collisions. The Chicxulub impact is one such example, which has previously caused widespread losses in habitat as the Earth either received less sunlight or grew colder, causing certain fauna and flora to flourish whilst others perished. Previously known warm areas in the tropics, the most sensitive habitats on Earth, grew colder, and areas such as Australia developed radically different flora and fauna to those seen today. The big five mass extinction events have also been linked to sea level changes, indicating that large scale marine species loss was strongly influenced by loss in marine habitats, particularly shelf habitats. Methane-driven oceanic eruptions have also been shown to have caused smaller mass extinction events.\n\nHumans have been the cause of many species’ extinction. Due to humans’ changing and modifying their environment, the habitat of other species often become altered or destroyed as a result of human actions. Even before the modern industrial era, humans were having widespread, and major effects on the environment. A good example of this is found in Aboriginal Australians and Australian megafauna. Aboriginal hunting practices, which included burning large sections of forest at a time, eventually altered and changed Australia’s vegetation so much that many herbivorous megafauna species were left with no habitat and were driven into extinction. Once herbivorous megafauna species became extinct, carnivorous megafauna species soon followed.\nIn the recent past, humans have been responsible for causing more extinctions within a given period of time than ever before. Deforestation, pollution, anthropogenic climate change and human settlements have all been driving forces in altering or destroying habitats. The destruction of ecosystems such as rainforests has resulted in countless habitats being destroyed. These biodiversity hotspots are home to millions of habitat specialists, which do not exist beyond a tiny area. Once their habitat is destroyed, they cease to exist.This destruction has a follow-on effect, as species which coexist or depend upon the existence of other species also become extinct, eventually resulting in the collapse of an entire ecosystem. These time-delayed extinctions are referred to as the extinction debt, which is the result of destroying and fragmenting habitats.\nAs a result of anthropogenic modification of the environment, the extinction rate has climbed to the point where the Earth is now within a sixth mass extinction event, as commonly agreed by biologists. This has been particularly evident, for example, in the rapid decline in the number of amphibian species worldwide.\n\nDetermining the size, type and location of habitat to conserve is a complex area of conservation biology. Although difficult to measure and predict, the conservation value of a habitat is often a reflection of the quality (e.g. species abundance and diversity), endangerment of encompassing ecosystems, and spatial distribution of that habitat.\n\nHabitat conservation is vital for protecting species and ecological processes. It is important to conserve and protect the space/ area in which that species occupies. Therefore, areas classified as ‘biodiversity hotspots’, or those in which a flagship, umbrella, or endangered species inhabits are often the habitats that are given precedence over others. Species that possess an elevated risk of extinction are given the highest priority and as a result of conserving their habitat, other species in that community are protected thus serving as an element of gap analysis. In the United States of America, a Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP) is often developed to conserve the environment in which a specific species inhabits. Under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) the habitat that requires protection in an HCP is referred to as the ‘critical habitat’. Multiple-species HCPs are becoming more favourable than single-species HCPs as they can potentially protect an array of species before they warrant listing under the ESA, as well as being able to conserve broad ecosystem components and processes . As of January 2007, 484 HCPs were permitted across the United States, 40 of which covered 10 or more species.The San Diego Multiple Species Conservation Plan (MSCP) encompasses 85 species in a total area of 26,000-km2. Its aim is to protect the habitats of multiple species and overall biodiversity by minimizing development in sensitive areas. Hi\n\nHCPs require clearly defined goals and objectives, efficient monitoring programs, as well as successful communication and collaboration with stakeholders and land owners in the area. Reserve design is also important and requires a high level of planning and management in order to achieve the goals of the HCP. Successful reserve design often takes the form of a hierarchical system with the most valued habitats requiring high protection being surrounded by buffer habitats that have a lower protection status. Like HCPs, hierarchical reserve design is a method most often used to protect a single species, and as a result habitat corridors are maintained, edge effects are reduced and a broader suite of species are protected.\n\nA range of methods and models currently exist that can be used to determine how much habitat is to be conserved in order to sustain a viable population, including Resource Selection Function and Step Selection models. Modelling tools often rely on the spatial scale of the area as an indicator of conservation value. There has been an increase in emphasis on conserving few large areas of habitat as opposed to many small areas. This idea is often referred to as the \"single large or several small\", SLOSS debate, and is a highly controversial area among conservation biologists and ecologists. The reasons behind the argument that \"larger is better\" include the reduction in the negative impacts of patch edge effects, the general idea that species richness increases with habitat area and the ability of larger habitats to support greater populations with lower extinction probabilities. Noss & Cooperrider support the \"larger is better\" claim and developed a model that implies areas of habitat less than 1000ha are \"tiny\" and of low conservation value. However, Shwartz suggests that although \"larger is better\", this does not imply that \"small is bad\". Shwartz argues that human induced habitat loss leaves no alternative to conserving small areas. Furthermore, he suggests many endangered species which are of high conservation value, may only be restricted to small isolated patches of habitat, and thus would be overlooked if larger areas were given a higher priority. The shift to conserving larger areas is somewhat justified in society by placing more value on larger vertebrate species, which naturally have larger habitat requirements.\n\nSince its formation in 1951 The Nature Conservancy has slowly developed into one of the world’s largest conservation organizations. Currently operating in over 30 countries, across 5 continents worldwide, The Nature Conservancy aims to protect nature and its assets for future generations. The organization purchases land or accepts land donations with the intension of conserving its natural resources. In 1955 The Nature Conservancy purchased its first 60-acre plot near the New York/Connecticut border in the United States of America. Today the Conservancy has expanded to protect over 119 million acres of land, 5,000 river miles as well as participating in over 1000 marine protection programs across the globe .\nSince its beginnings The Nature Conservancy has understood the benefit in taking a scientific approach towards habitat conservation. For the last decade the organization has been using a collaborative, scientific method known as ‘Conservation by Design’. By collecting and analyzing scientific data The Conservancy is able to holistically approach the protection of various ecosystems. This process determines the habitats that need protection, specific elements that should be conserved as well as monitoring progress so more efficient practices can be developed for the future.\n\nThe Nature Conservancy currently has a large number of diverse projects in operation. They work with countries around the world to protect forests, river systems, oceans, deserts and grasslands. In all cases the aim is to provide a sustainable environment for both the plant and animal life forms that depend on them as well as all future generations to come. turtles\n\nThe World Wildlife Fund (WWF) was first formed in after a group of passionate conservationists signed what is now referred to as the Morges Manifesto. WWF is currently operating in over 100 countries across 5 continents with a current listing of over 5 million supporters. \nOne of the first projects of WWF was assisting in the creation of the Charles Darwin Research Foundation which aided in the protection of diverse range of unique species existing on the Galápagos’ Islands, Ecuador. It was also a WWF grant that helped with the formation of the College of African Wildlife Management in Tanzania which today focuses on teaching a wide range of protected area management skills in areas such as ecology, range management and law enforcement.\nThe WWF has since gone on to aid in the protection of land in Spain, creating the Coto Doñana National Park in order to conserve migratory birds and The Democratic Republic of Congo, home to the world’s largest protected wetlands. The WWF also initiated a debt-for-nature concept which allows the country to put funds normally allocated to paying off national debt, into conservation programs that protect its natural landscapes. Countries currently participating include Madagascar, the first country to participate which since 1989 has generated over $US50 million towards preservation, Bolivia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Gabon, the Philippines and Zambia.\n\nRare has been in operation since 1973 with current global partners in over 50 countries and offices in the United States of America, Mexico, the Philippines, China and Indonesia. Rare focuses on the human activity that threatens biodiversity and habitats such as overfishing and unsustainable agriculture. By engaging local communities and changing behaviour Rare has been able to launch campaigns to protect areas in most need of conservation.\nThe key aspect of Rare’s methodology is their \"Pride Campaign’s\". For example, in the Andes in South America, Rare has incentives to develop watershed protection practices. In the Southeast Asia’s \"coral triangle\" Rare is training fishers in local communities to better manage the areas around the coral reefs in order to lessen human impact. Such programs last for three years with the aim of changing community attitudes so as to conserve fragile habitats and provide ecological protection for years to come.\n\nWWF Netherlands, along with ARK Nature, Wild Wonders of Europe and Conservation Capital have started the Rewilding Europe project. This project intents to rewild several areas in Europe.\n\n"}

One well-known version of the dilemma, used in Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development, is stated as follows:\n\nA woman was on her deathbed. There was one drug that the doctors thought might save her. It was a form of radium that a druggist in the same town had recently discovered. The drug was expensive to make, but the druggist was charging ten times what the drug cost him to produce. He paid $200 for the radium and charged $2,000 for a small dose of the drug. The sick woman's husband, Heinz, went to everyone he knew to borrow the money, but he could only get together about $1,000 which is half of what it cost. He told the druggist that his wife was dying and asked him to sell it cheaper or let him pay later. But the druggist said: “No, I discovered the drug and I'm going to make money from it.” So Heinz got desperate and broke into the man's laboratory to steal the drug for his wife. Should Heinz have broken into the laboratory to steal the drug for his wife? Why or why not?\n\nFrom a theoretical point of view, it is not important what the participant thinks that Heinz should \"do\". Kohlberg's theory holds that the justification the participant offers is what is significant, the \"form\" of their response.

The quintessential Japanese leader is a network builder rather than the embodiment of charisma or ideals; more like the crafty and resourceful founder of the Tokugawa bakufu, Tokugawa Ieyasu, than the ruthless but heroic Oda Nobunaga. Such political dynamics are evident, for example, in the workings of the LDP, which has remained the strongest party since 1955 despite their 3-year loss of majority control in the early 1990s.\n\nAs clichés go, the success of Junichiro Koizumi showed that Japan may have just been in waiting for a charismatic, media-savvy politician. In the 2005 House of Representatives election, the personal voter relationship concept was challenged for the first time. So called \"assassin candidates\", with a pro-postal privatization agenda, were set against the \"postal rebels\", critics of postal reform, who were cast out of the LDP but still had local ties in their voting districts. Results were mixed, with some districts taken by the \"rebels\" and some by the \"assassins\".\n\nFurthermore, the pragmatic, personalistic view of politics cannot explain Japan's militaristic past, the political crises of the 1960s, the controversies surrounding the emperor, Article 9, or the unwillingness of many in the Social Democratic Party of Japan, despite a huge political cost, to abandon their antiwar and revolutionary commitment in the early 1990s.\n\nIt also fails to account for the apparently sincerely held ideological beliefs of the wartime period. The \"New Order in Greater East Asia\" was legitimized on the basis of universal principles, such as \"Pan-Asianism,\" \"international justice,\" and \"permanent peace,\" even if the results were quite the opposite. The non-ideological nature of mainstream Japanese politics in the postwar period reflects defeat in war, the failure after 1945 to find a national ideological consensus to replace discredited wartime beliefs, and the commitment of both elite and ordinary Japanese to expanding the economy and raising living standards. As these goals were attained, a complacent, largely apolitical \"middle mass society\" (a term coined by economist Murakami Yasusuke) emerged, in which 90 percent of the people in opinion polls consistently classified themselves as \"middle class.\"\n\nCertain distinctive features of Japanese politics can be identified, although this is not to say that they are unique to Japan. Rather, qualities also found in other political systems, such as the importance of personal connections and consensus building, played an extraordinarily important role in Japanese politics. These features have deep historical roots and reflect values that pervade the society as a whole.\n\nIn both the feudal and the modern eras, a major problem for Japanese political leaders has been reconciling the goals of community survival and the welfare and self-respect of individuals in an environment of extreme scarcity. In recent centuries, Japan lacked the natural resources and space to accommodate its population comfortably. With the exception of Hokkaidō and colonial territories in Asia between 1895 and 1945, there was no \"frontier\" to absorb excess people. One solution was to ignore the welfare of large sectors of the population (peasants and workers) and to use force when they expressed their discontent. Such coercive measures, common during both the Tokugawa and the World War II periods, largely, although not entirely, disappeared in the postwar \"welfare state\" (for example, farmers were evicted from their land to construct the New Tokyo International Airport at Narita Sanrizuka in the 1970s after long negotiations had failed). But non-coercive, or mostly non-coercive, methods of securing popular compliance had developed to an extraordinary degree in social and political life.\n\nThe most important such method is the promotion of a strong sense of community consciousness and group solidarity. Japanese individuals are often characterized as having a strong sense of self-sacrifice and community dedication (see Japanese values). Historians and sociologists note that both traditional and modern Japanese communities—the buraku, the feudal domain with its retinue of samurai, the large commercial houses found in Edo (the future Tokyo), Osaka, and Kyoto before 1868, and modern corporations and bureaucracies with their cohorts of lifetime employees—have striven to be all-inclusive. Such groups serve a variety of functions for the individual, providing not only income and sustenance but also emotional support and individual identity. Japanese called such community inclusiveness the \"octopus-pot way of life\" (\"takotsubo seikatsu\"). Large pots with narrow openings at the top are used by fishermen to capture octopuses, and the term is used to refer to people so wrapped up in their particular social group that they cannot see the world outside its confines.\n\nThe \"group consciousness\" model of Japanese social life, however, has been overstressed at times. A person may often go along with group demands because they serve self-interest in the long run (for example, political contributions may help secure future favors from those in office). Historically, democratic concepts of individual rights and limited government have been deeply appealing because they, too, promise protection of individual autonomy. Despite very different ethical and political traditions, the Japanese people were very receptive to imported liberal ideas both before and after 1945. John Stuart Mill's essay On Liberty, for example, was extremely popular during the Meiji era.\n\nBecause individual, usually passive, resistance to group demands occurs, Japanese leaders have found the creation of a strong community sense to be a difficult and time-consuming task. Harmony (wa), that most prized social value, is not easily attained. One mechanism for achieving wa is the use of rituals to develop a psychological sense of group identity. Political parties and factions, the offices of national and local governments, businesses, university departments, research groups, alumni associations, and other groups sponsor frequent ceremonies and more informal parties for this purpose. A group's history and identity are carefully constructed through the use of songs and symbols (often resembling, in miniature, the Meiji government's creation of symbols of kokutai in the late nineteenth century). Often, an organization's founder, especially if deceased, is regarded as something of a Confucian sage or a Shinto kami (deity). Group members, however, may find that pervasive ritualism allows them to \"go through the motions\" (such as the chanting of banzai! (ten thousand years!) at the end of political rallies, without having to make a deeper commitment to the group.\n\nA second mechanism to promote community solidarity is the building of hierarchical relationships. In this practice, the influence of premodern ethics is readily apparent. In what anthropologist Nakane Chie calls Japan's \"vertical society,\" human relationships are defined in terms of inequality, and people relate to each other as superiors and inferiors along a minutely differentiated gradient of social status, not only within bureaucratic organizations, where it might be expected, but also in academic, artistic, and, especially, political worlds.\n\nHierarchy expresses itself along two dimensions: first, an internal community differentiation of rank by seniority, education, and occupational status; and second, the distinction between \"insiders\" and \"outsiders,\" between members and nonmembers of the community, along with the ranking of whole groups or communities along a vertical continuum. Although internal hierarchy can cause alienation as inferiors chafe under the authority of their superiors, the external kind of hierarchy tends to strengthen group cohesion as individual members work to improve their group's relative ranking. The Japanese nation as a whole has been viewed as a single group by its people in relation to other nations. Intense nationalism has frequently been a manifestation of group members' desire to \"catch up and overtake\" the advanced (\"superior\") nations of the West, while the rights of non-Western nations, like China or Korea, often viewed as \"inferior,\" have been ignored.\n\nLike group consciousness, however, the theme of hierarchy has been overstressed. Contemporary Japanese politics show a strong consciousness of equality, and even traditional communities, such as rural villages, were often egalitarian rather than hierarchical. Citizens' movements of the 1960s and 1970s differed from older political organizations in their commitment to promoting intragroup democracy. In addressing the nation, Emperor Akihito used colloquial Japanese terms that stressed equality, rather than the formal, hierarchy-laden language of his predecessors.\n\nTwo mechanisms for lessening the hierarchy-generated tensions are the seniority principle and early retirement. As men or women grow older, gaining seniority within an organization, they acquire authority and higher status. The seniority principle is reinforced by the traditional reluctance to place younger persons in positions of authority over older ones. The institution of early retirement (top-ranked businesspeople and bureaucrats commonly retired at age fifty-five or sixty) helps to the keep the promotion of others smooth and predictable. The system also helps to enable talented individuals to succeed to the most responsible positions and prevents a small group of older persons (what the Japanese call \"one-man leaders\") from monopolizing leadership positions and imposing increasingly outmoded ideas on the organization. Elite retirees, however, often continue to wield influence as advisers and usually pursue second careers in organizations affiliated with the one from which they retired. (see Elderly people in Japan)\n\nThe circulation of elites that results from the seniority and early retirement principles ensures that everyone within the upper ranks of the hierarchy has a turn at occupying a high-status position, such as a cabinet post in the national government. This principle, in turn, enables people to reward their followers. There has been, for example, a regular turnover of LDP leaders. No individual has served as party president (and prime minister) longer than Sato Eisaku, the incumbent between 1964 and 1972. The average tenure of party presidents / prime ministers between 1964 and 1987 was slightly more than three years. Frequent cabinet reshuffling meant that the average tenure of other cabinet ministers in the same period was a little less than a year. Japan has not been beset with leaders in their seventies and eighties unwilling to give up their powerful positions.\n\nAnother mechanism reducing intragroup tensions is the strong personal, rather than legalistic or ideological, ties between superior and subordinate. These ties are typically characterized in terms of fictive familial relationships, analogous to the bonds between parents and children (the \"oyabun-kobun relationship\"). The ideal leader is viewed as a paternalistic one, with a warm and personal concern for the welfare of his followers. For followers, loyalty is both morally prescribed and emotionally sustained by the system. In the political world, oyabun-kobun relationships are pervasive despite the formal commitment to universalistic, democratic values. At the same time, younger people find such relationships less appealing than their elders. The so-called \"shinjinrui\" (new human beings), born in the affluent 1960s and 1970s, were often criticized by older Japanese for being self-absorbed, egoistic, and \"cool.\" The younger generation is inclined to view with disdain the emotional expression of paternalistic ties, such as in the 1989 television broadcasts of former Prime Minister Tanaka Kakuei's supporters weeping profusely over his political retirement.\n\nThe community is often demanding, but it is also fragile, because social ties are sustained not only through legal norms and common self-interest but also through the affective patron-client relationship. Open conflict poses a danger to the survival of this sort of community, and thus policy making requires elaborate consultation and consensus building, usually involving all the parties concerned in order to maintain wa (和), the notion of harmony within a group. According to political scientist Lewis Austin, \"everyone must be consulted informally, everyone must be heard, but not in such a way that the hearing of different opinions develops into opposition. The leader and his assistants `harmonize opinion'... in advance, using go-betweens to avert the confrontation of opposing forces.\" After a preliminary agreement among all has been reached, a formal meeting is held in which the agreed-upon policy will be proposed and adopted.\n\nThis process is called nemawashi (root trimming or binding), evoking the image of a gardener preparing a tree or shrub for transplanting, that is, a change in policy. Austin points out that a common Japanese verb meaning \"to decide\" (\"matomeru\") literally means to gather or bring together. Decisions are \"the sum of the contributions of all.\" Although consensus building is, for leaders, a time-consuming and emotionally exhausting process, it is necessary not only to promote group goals but also to respect and protect individual autonomy. In fact, the process represents reconciliation of the two. In the political system as a whole, most groups play some role in the \"nemawashi\" process. Exceptions are those groups or individuals, such as Koreans or other minority groups, who are viewed as outsiders.\n\nPolitical leaders have to maintain solidarity and harmony within a single group and also secure the cooperation of different groups who are often in bitter conflict. \"Takotsubo seikatsu\" can promote destructive sectionalism. During World War II, rivalry between the Imperial Army and the Imperial Navy was so intense that it was nearly impossible to coordinate their strategic operations. In the postwar political system, prime ministers have often been unable to persuade different ministries, all self-sufficient and intensely jealous \"kingdoms,\" to go along with reforms in such areas as trade liberalization. Observers such as journalist Karel van Wolferen, have concluded that Japan's political system is empty at the center, lacking real leadership or a locus of responsibility: \"Statecraft in Japan is quite different from that in the rest of Asia, Europe, and the Americas. For centuries it has entailed the preservation of a careful balance of semiautonomous groups that share power… These semiautonomous components, each endowed with great discretionary powers, are not represented in one central ruling body.\" This view is probably exaggerated. Leadership in other countries, including the United States, has been paralyzed from time to time by powerful interest groups, and some policies in Japan requiring decisive leadership, such as the creation of social welfare and energy conservation policies in the 1970s and the privatization of state enterprises in the 1980s, have been reasonably successful.\n\n\n"}

Prior to his current position he taught Philosophy at several Universities and Colleges across Canada including: University of Waterloo, Wilfrid Laurier University, Okanagan University-College, Humber College, Trent University, University of Prince Edward Island, and York University. Groarke's writings in philosophy have focussed upon Ethics, Logic, Political Philosophy and Aesthetics. His work characteristically draws upon his broad knowledge of the history of Western philosophy, especially the thought of Aristotle, with a view to applying this to address problems in contemporary philosophy.\n\nLouis Groarke's first book \"The Good Rebel\" addresses the tendency of contemporary philosophers to overly separate freedom from morality and rationality. On this model, morality and rationality appear to be constraints upon freedom. Through the presentation of a vast array of figures in the philosophical tradition, Groarke shows that this contemporary view is a deviation from a broadly held consensus that far from being at odds with morality and rationality, freedom actually presupposes these goods. According to this view, which Groarke defends, one cannot be authentically free without being both rational and good. Subsequently, Groarke has authored a significant textbook and many academic articles on ethics developing this historical methodology.\n\nHis work in Logic also develops this methodology of applying lessons from the history of philosophy to offer revisionary accounts of philosophical ideas that have come to be taken for granted in much of the current philosophical discourse. In his work \"An Aristotelian Account of Induction: Creating Something from Nothing\" Groarke critiques the orthodox view of Inductive logic that has been widely held since David Hume, according to whom inductive inferences can never be certain as the conclusion always extends beyond the number of observed cases. Drawing on an Aristotelian distinction between knowledge and insight Groarke argues that sense experience can in cases give insight into the fundamental nature of a thing in a way that grounds knowledge of the universal. This alternative highlights that it is Hume's presumption of nominalism that grounds his account of the problem of induction. Defending an Aristotelian form of essentialism Groarke argues for an account of induction that is non-fallacious and in some of its forms capable of rising to genuine knowledge.\n\n\n"}

Lewis argued, that a theory of pain must be able to reflect the most basic intuitions of both functionalism and identity theory. Because of such, he proposes the existence of two beings both in pain – one whose physical explanation of pain differs from ours and one whose reaction to pain differs from ours. Lewis states that any complete theory of the mind should be able to explain how each being is in pain.\n\nThe being with \"mad pain\" is a human being, except when his brain is in a state of pain, his mind turns to mathematics and he begins to snap his fingers. He is not at all inclined to prevent the pain from occurring. Lewis ultimately goes on to explain that pain is relative to a species, implying that the man who exhibits mad pain is essentially an exception. He is in pain because, instantiated in him, it is that physical state which is normally an instantiation of pain in his species (humans). In Lewis' words, \"In short, he feels pain but his pain does not at all occupy the typical causal role of pain.\"\n\nA being with \"Martian pain\" is not human but, when subject to pain, will react in the same way that humans do. He is strongly inclined to prevent whatever stimulus is causing discomfort. However, the physical explanation of Martian pain is different from that of human pain. He has a \"hydraulic mind\" and pain is identical with inflation of cavities in his feet. Lewis suggests that the Martian is indeed in pain, because, instantiated in him is the filler of the relevant physical instantiation of pain in that species: inflation of the cavities in the feet. In Lewis' words, \"In short, he feels pain but lacks the bodily states that either are in pain or else accompany it in us.\"\n\nIn a postscript to \"Mad Pain and Martian Pain\" (published in \"Philosophical Papers\", Volume I), Lewis takes a critical view of qualia. He explicitly identifies pain with qualia, observing that, \"We say to the friend of qualia that, beneath his tendentious jargon, he is just talking pain and various aspects of its functional role.\" (p. 130). He then lays out a response to the knowledge argument of Frank Jackson.\n\nThose who hold that the intuitions behind identity theory need not be respected are free to disagree with Lewis, and to say that \"mad pain\" need not be permitted or explained by a theory of pain. Equally, those who hold that the intuitions behind functionalism need not be respected are free to say that they see no reason why the Martian's 'pain' should be accepted as real pain.\n\n\n"}

A student of the Swiss metaphysician Frithjof Schuon and an authority on the work of William Shakespeare, he is best known as the author of \"\", first published in 1983 and still in print.\n\nLings was born in Burnage, Manchester, in 1909 to a Protestant family. The young Lings gained an introduction to travelling at a young age, spending significant time in the United States because of his father's employment. Lings attended Clifton College and went on to Magdalen College, Oxford, where he gained a BA in English Language and Literature. At Magdalen, he was a student and then a close friend of C. S. Lewis. After graduating from Oxford Lings went to Vytautas Magnus University, in Lithuania, where he taught Anglo-Saxon and Middle English.\n\nFor Lings himself, however, the most important event whilst at Oxford was his discovery of the writings of the René Guénon, a French metaphysician and Muslim convert, and those of Frithjof Schuon, a German spiritual authority, metaphysician and Perennialist. In 1938, Lings went to Basle to make Schuon's acquaintance. This prompted his embracing Islam to embrace the branch of the Alawiyya tariqa led by Schuon. Thereafter, Lings remained Schuon's disciple and expositor for the rest of his life.\n\nIn 1939, Lings went to Cairo, Egypt, to visit a friend who was an assistant of René Guénon. Soon after arriving in Cairo, his friend died and Lings began studying Arabic. Cairo became his home for over a decade; he became an English language teacher at the University of Cairo and produced Shakespeare plays annually. Lings married Lesley Smalley in 1944 and lived with her in a village near the pyramids. Despite having settled comfortably in Egypt, Lings was forced to leave in 1952 after anti-British disturbances.\n\nOn returning to the United Kingdom he continued his education, earning a BA in Arabic and a PhD from the School of Oriental and African Studies (University of London). His doctoral thesis became a well-received book on Algerian Sufi Ahmad al-Alawi. After completing his doctorate in 1959, Lings worked at the British Museum and later the British Library, overseeing eastern manuscripts and other textual works, rising to the position of Keeper of Oriental Printed Books and Manuscripts 1970–73. He was also a frequent contributor to the journal \"Studies in Comparative Religion\".\n\nA writer throughout this period, Lings' output increased in the last quarter of his life. While his thesis work on Ahmad al-Alawi had been well regarded, his most famous work was a , written in 1983, which earned him acclaim in the Muslim world and prizes from the governments of Pakistan and Egypt. His work was hailed as the \"best biography of the prophet in English\" at the National Seerat Conference in Islamabad. He also continued travelling extensively, although he made his home in Kent. He died on 12 May 2005.\n\nIn addition to his writings on Sufism, Lings was a Shakespeare scholar. His contribution to Shakespeare scholarship was to point out the deeper esoteric meanings found in Shakespeare's plays, and the spirituality of Shakespeare himself. More recent editions of Lings's books on Shakespeare include a foreword by Charles, Prince of Wales. Just before his death he gave an interview on this topic, which was posthumously made into the film \"Shakespeare's Spirituality: A Perspective. An Interview With Dr. Martin Lings\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "19456", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19456", "title": "Max Horkheimer", "text": "Max Horkheimer\n\nMax Horkheimer (; ; February 14, 1895 – July 7, 1973) was a German philosopher and sociologist who was famous for his work in critical theory as a member of the 'Frankfurt School' of social research. Horkheimer addressed authoritarianism, militarism, economic disruption, environmental crisis, and the poverty of mass culture using the philosophy of history as a framework. This became the foundation of critical theory. His most important works include \"Eclipse of Reason\" (1947), \"Between Philosophy and Social Science\" (1930–1938) and, in collaboration with Theodor Adorno, \"Dialectic of Enlightenment\" (1947). Through the Frankfurt School, Horkheimer planned, supported and made other significant works possible.\n\nOn February 14, 1895, Horkheimer was born the only son of Moritz and Babetta Horkheimer. Horkheimer was born into a conservative, wealthy Orthodox Jewish family. His father was a successful businessman who owned several textile factories in the Zuffenhausen district of Stuttgart, where Max was born. Moritz expected his son to follow in his footsteps and own the family business. Max was taken out of school in 1910 to work in the family business, where he eventually became a junior manager. During this period he would begin two relationships that would last for the rest of his life. First, he met Friedrich Pollock, who would later become a close academic colleague, and who would remain Max's closest friend. He also met Rose Riekher, who was his father's personal secretary. Eight years Max's senior, a gentile, and of an economically lower class, Riekher (whom Max called \"Maidon\") was not considered a suitable match by Moritz Horkheimer. Despite this, Max and Maidon would marry in 1926 and remain together until her death in 1969. In 1917, his manufacturing career ended and his chances of taking over his family business were interrupted when he was drafted into World War I. However, Horkheimer was denied service on medical grounds.\n\nIn the spring of 1919, after failing an army physical, Horkheimer enrolled at Munich University. While living in Munich, he was mistaken for the revolutionary playwright Ernst Toller and arrested and imprisoned. After being released, Horkheimer moved to Frankfurt am Main, where he studied philosophy and psychology under the respectable Hans Cornelius. There, he met Theodor Adorno, several years his junior, with whom he would strike a lasting friendship and a collaborative relationship. After an abortive attempt at writing a dissertation on gestalt psychology, Horkheimer, with Cornelius's direction, completed his doctorate in philosophy with a 78-page dissertation titled \"The Antinomy of Teleological Judgment\" (\"Zur Antinomie der teleologischen Urteilskraft\"). In 1925, Horkheimer was habilitated with a dissertation entitled \"Kant's Critique of Judgement as Mediation between Practical and Theoretical Philosophy\" (\"Über Kants Kritik der Urteilskraft als Bindeglied zwischen theoretischer und praktischer Philosophie\"). Here, he met Friedrich Pollock who would be his colleague at the Institute of Social Research. The following year, Max was appointed \"Privatdozent.\" Shortly after, in 1926, Horkheimer married Rose Riekher.\n\nIn 1926 Horkheimer was an \"unsalaried lecturer in Frankfurt.\" Shortly after, in 1930, he was promoted to professor of philosophy at Frankfurt University. In the same year, when the Institute for Social Research's (now known as Frankfurt School of Critical Theory) directorship became vacant, after the departure of Carl Grünberg, Horkheimer was elected to the position \"by means of an endowment from a wealthy businessman\". The Institute had had its beginnings in a Marxist study group started by Felix Weil, a one-time student of political science at Frankfurt who used his inheritance to fund the group as a way to support his leftist academic aims. Pollock and Horkheimer were partners with Weil in the early activities of the Institute.\n\nHorkheimer worked to make the Institute a purely academic enterprise. As director, he changed Frankfurt from an orthodox Marxist school to a heterodox school for critical social research . The following year publication of the Institute's \"Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung\" began, with Horkheimer as its editor. Horkheimer intellectually reoriented the Institute, proposing a programme of collective research aimed at specific social groups (specifically the working class) that would highlight the problem of the relationship of history and reason. The Institute focused on integrating the views of Karl Marx and Sigmund Freud. The Frankfurt School attempted this by systematically hitching together the different conceptual structures of historical materialism and psychoanalysis.\n\nDuring the time between Horkheimer's being named Professor of Social Philosophy and director of the Institute in 1930, the Nazis became the second largest party in the Reichstag. In the midst of the violence surrounding the Nazis' rise, Horkheimer and his associates began to prepare for the possibility of moving the Institute out of Germany. Horkheimer's \"venia legendi\" was revoked by the new Nazi government because of the Marxian nature of the Institute's ideas as well as its prominent Jewish association. When Hitler was named the Chancellor in 1933, the Institute was thus forced to close its location in Germany. He emigrated to Geneva, Switzerland and then to New York City the following year, where Horkheimer met with the president of Columbia University to discuss hosting the Institute. To Horkheimer's surprise, the president agreed to host the Institute in exile as well as offer Horkheimer a building for the Institute. In July 1934 Horkheimer accepted an offer from Columbia to relocate the Institute to one of their buildings.\n\nIn 1940, Horkheimer received American citizenship and moved to the Pacific Palisades district of Los Angeles, California, where his collaboration with Adorno would yield the \"Dialectic of Enlightenment.\" In 1942, Horkheimer assumed the directorship of the Scientific Division of the American Jewish Committee. In this capacity, he helped launch and organize a series of five Studies in Prejudice, which were published in 1949 and 1950. The most important of these was the pioneering study in social psychology entitled The Authoritarian Personality, itself a methodologically advanced reworking of some of the themes treated in a collective project produced by the Institute in its first years of exile, Studies in Authority and Family. In the years that followed, Horkheimer did not publish much, although he continued to edit \"Studies in Philosophy and Social Science\" as a continuation of the \"Zeitschrift.\" In 1949, he returned to Frankfurt where the Institute for Social Research reopened in 1950. Between 1951 and 1953 Horkheimer was rector of the University of Frankfurt. In 1953, Horkheimer stepped down from director of the Institute and took on a smaller role in the Institute, while Adorno became director. Horkheimer and Adorno were seen as the fathers of the Institute.\n\nHorkheimer continued to teach at the University until his retirement in the mid-1960s. In 1953, he was awarded the Goethe Plaque of the City of Frankfurt, and was later named honorary citizen of Frankfurt for life. He returned to America in 1954 and 1959 to lecture as a frequent visiting professor at the University of Chicago.\n\nHe remained an important figure until his death in Nuremberg in 1973. Max Horkheimer with the help of Theodor Adorno, Herbert Marcuse, Walter Benjamin, Leo Lowenthal, Otto Kirchheimer, Frederick Pollock and Neumann developed \"Critical Theory\". According to Larry Ray \"Critical Theory\" has \"become one of the most influential social theories of the twentieth century\".\n\nHorkheimer's work is marked by a concern to show the relation between affect (especially suffering) and concepts (understood as action-guiding expressions of reason). In this, he responded critically to what he saw as the one-sidedness of both neo-Kantianism (with its focus on concepts) and \"Lebensphilosophie\" (with its focus on expression and world-disclosure). Horkheimer did not think either was wrong, but insisted that the insights of each school on their own could not adequately contribute to the repair of social problems. Horkheimer focused on the connections between social structures, networks/subcultures, and individual realities, concluding that we are affected and shaped by the proliferation of products on the market place. It is also important to note that Horkheimer collaborated with Herbert Marcuse, Erich Fromm, Theodor Adorno and Walter Benjamin.\n\nThrough critical theory (a social theory focusing on critiquing and changing society), Horkheimer \"attempted to revitalize radical social, and cultural criticism\" and discussed authoritarianism, militarism, economic disruption, environmental crisis and the poverty of mass culture. Horkheimer helped to create Critical Theory through a mix of radical and conservative lenses that stem from radical Marxism and end up in \"pessimistic Jewish transcendentalism\". Horkheimer developed his critical theory by examining his own wealth while witnessing the juxtaposition of the bourgeois and the impoverished. This critical theory embraced the future possibilities of society and was preoccupied with forces which moved society toward rational institutions that would ensure a true, free, and just life. He was convinced of the need to \"examine the entire material and spiritual culture of mankind\" in order to transform society as a whole. Horkheimer sought to enable the working class to reclaim their power in order to resist the lure of fascism. Horkheimer stated himself that \"the rationally organized society that regulates its own existence\" was necessary along with a society that could \"satisfy common needs\". To satisfy these needs, it would need to engage with the social conditions within which people lived and in which their concepts and actions were formed. It reached out for a total understanding of history and knowledge. Through this, critical theory develops a \"critique of bourgeois society through which 'ideology critique' attempted to locate the 'utopian content' of dominant systems of thought\". Above all, critical theory sought to develop a critical perspective in the discussion of all social practices.\n\nHorkheimer's book, \"Eclipse of Reason\", published in 1947, is broken into five sections: Means and Ends, Conflicting Panaceas, The Revolt of Nature, The Rise and Decline of the Individual, and On the Concept of Philosophy. The 'Eclipse of Reason focuses on the concept of reason within the history of western philosophy, which can only be fostered in an environment of free, critical thinking while also linking positivist and instrumental reason with the rise of fascism. He distinguishes between objective, subjective and instrumental reason, and states that we have moved from the former through the center and into the latter (though subjective and instrumental reason are closely connected). Objective reason deals with universal truths that dictate that an action is either right or wrong. It is a concrete concept and a force in the world that requires specific modes of behavior. The focus in the objective faculty of reason is on the ends, rather than the means. Subjective reason is an abstract concept of reason, and focuses primarily on means. Specifically, the reasonable nature of the purpose of action is irrelevant – the ends only serve the purpose of the subject (generally self-advancement or preservation). To be \"reasonable\" in this context is to be suited to a particular purpose, to be \"good for something else\". This aspect of reason is universally conforming, and easily furnishes ideology. In instrumental reason, the sole criterion of reason is its operational value or purposefulness, and with this, the idea of truth becomes contingent on mere subjective preference (hence the relation with subjective reason). Because subjective/instrumental reason rules, the ideals of a society, for example democratic ideals, become dependent on the \"interests\" of the people instead of being dependent on objective truths. In his writing Horkheimer states, \"Social power is today more than ever mediated by power over things. The more intense an individual's concern with power over things, the more will things dominate him, the more will he lack any genuine individual traits, and the more will his mind be transformed into an automation of formalized reason.\" Nevertheless, Horkheimer admits that objective reason has its roots in Reason (\"Logos\" in Greek) of the subject. He concludes, \"If by enlightenment and intellectual progress we mean the freeing of man from superstitious belief in evil forces, in demons and fairies, in blind fate – in short, the emancipation from fear – then denunciation of what is currently called reason is the greatest service we can render.\"\n\nIn 1941, Horkheimer outlined how the Nazis had been able to make their agenda appear \"reasonable\", but also issued a warning about the possibility of a similar occurrence happening again. Horkheimer believed that the illnesses of modern society are caused by misunderstanding reason: if people use true reason to critique their societies, they will be able to solve problems they may have.\n\nDespite the explicit common referrals to \"subjective\" reason in the book, his frequent connecting of it with relativism could be an indication that by \"subjective reason\" Horkheimer also means \"relativist reason\".\n\n\"Between Philosophy and Social Science\" appeared between 1930 and 1938, during the time the Frankfurt school moved from Frankfurt to Geneva to Columbia University. It included: \"Materialism and Morality\", \"The Present Situation of Moral Philosophy and the Tasks of an Institute for Social Research\", \"On the Problem of Truth\", \"Egoism and the Freedom Movement\", \"History and Psychology\", \"A New Concept of Ideology\", \"Remarks on Philosophical Anthropology\", and \"The Rationalism Debate in Contemporary Philosophy\". It also included \"The Present Situation of Social Philosophy and the Tasks for an Institute of Social Research\", \"Egoism and Freedom Movements\" and \"Beginnings of the Bourgeois Philosophy of History\". The essays within \"Between Philosophy and Social Science\" were Horkheimer's attempts to \"remove the individual from mass culture, a function for philosophy from the commodification of everything\". Horkheimer was extremely invested in the individual. In one of his writings, he states, \"When we speak of an individual as a historical entity, we mean not merely the space-time and the sense existence of a particular member of the human race, but in addition, his awareness of his own individuality as a conscious human being, including recognition of his own identity.\". Horkheimer was a strong believer in individuals becoming aware of themselves and their conscious as human beings. This is important to Horkheimer because for workers, he is aware of individuals losing their identity in products, which affects the power an individual may have of him/herself.\n\n\"The Present Situation of Social Philosophy and the Tasks for an Institute of Social Research\" was not only included in this volume, but it was also used as Horkheimer's inaugural speech as director of the Frankfurt School. In this speech he related economic groups to the struggles and challenges of real life. Horkheimer often referenced human struggle and used this example in his speech because it was a topic he understood well.\n\n\"Egoism and Freedom Movements\" and \"Beginnings of the Bourgeois Philosophy of History\" are the longest of the essays. The first is an evaluation of Machiavelli, Hobbes and Vico; the latter discusses the bourgeois control. In Beginnings of the Bourgeois Philosophy of History, Horkheimer explained \"what he learned from the bourgeois rise to power and what of the bourgeois he thought was worth preserving.\n\nThe volume also looks at the individual as the \"troubled center of philosophy.\" Horkheimer expressed that \"there is no formula that defines the relationship among individuals, society and nature for all time\". To understand the problem of the individual further, Horkheimer included two case studies on the individual: one on Montaigne and one on himself.\n\nMax Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno collaborated to publish \"Dialectic of Enlightenment\", which was originally published in 1944. The inspiration for this piece came from when Horkheimer and Adorno had to flee Germany, because of Hitler, and go to New York. They went to America and \"absorbed the popular culture\"; thinking that it was a form of totalitarianism. Nonetheless, Dialectic of Enlightenment's main argument was to serve as a wide-ranging critique of the \"self-destruction of enlightenment\". The work criticized popular culture as \"the product of a culture industry whose goal was to stupefy the masses with endless mass produced copies of the same thing\" (Lembert). Along with that, Horkheimer and Adorno had a few arguments; one being that these mass-produced products only appear to change over time. Horkheimer and Adorno stated that these products were so standardized in order to help consumers comprehend and appreciate the products with little attention given to them. They expressed, \"the result is a constant reproduction of the same thing\" (Adorno and Horkheimer, 1993 [1944]). However, they also explain how pseudo-individuality is encouraged among these products in order to keep the consumers coming back for more. They argue that small differences in products within the same area are acceptable.\n\nThe similar patterns found in the content of popular culture (films, popular songs and radio) have the same central message; \"it's all linked to \"the necessity of obedience of the masses to the social hierarchy in place in advanced capitalist societies\". These products appeal to the masses and encourage conformity to the consumers. In return, capitalism remains in power while buyers continue to consume from the industry. This is dangerous because the consumers' belief that the powers of technology are liberating, starts to increase. To support their claim, Horkheimer and Adorno, \"proposed an antidote: not just thinking the relations of things, but also, as an immediate second step, thinking through that thinking, self-reflectively\". In other words, technology lacks self-reflectivity. Nonetheless, Horkheimer and Adorno believed that art was an exception because it \"is an open-ended system with no fixed rules\"; thus, it could not be an object of the industry.\n\nPerry Anderson sees Horkheimer's attempt to make the Institute purely academic as \"symptomatic of a more universal process, the emergence of a 'Western Marxism' divorced from the working-class movement and dominated by academic philosophers and the 'product of defeat'\" because of the isolation of the Russian Revolution. Rolf Wiggerhaus, author of \"The Frankfurt School\" believed Horkheimer lacked the audacious theoretical construction produced by those like Marx and Lukács and that his main argument was that those living in misery had the right to material egoism. In his book, \"Social Theory\", Alex Callinicos claims that \"Dialectic of Enlightenment\" offers no systematic account of conception of rationality, but rather professes objective reason intransigently to an extent. Charles Lemert discusses in his book \"Social Theory\" that in writing \"Dialectic of Enlightenment\", Horkheimer and Adorno lack sufficient sympathy for the cultural plight of the average working person, unfair to criticize the tastes of ordinary people, and that popular culture does not really buttress social conformity and stabilize capitalism as much as the Frankfurt school thinks.\n\n\n\n\n"}

This philosophy was influenced by the ideas of C. D. Broad. Psychedelic drugs are thought to disable filters which inhibit or quell signals related to mundane functions from reaching the conscious mind. In the aforementioned books, Huxley explores the idea that the human mind filters reality, partly because handling the details of all of the impressions and images coming in would be unbearable, partly because it has been taught to do so. He believes that psychoactive drugs can partly remove this filter, which leaves the drug user exposed to Mind at Large.\n\nDuring an experiment with British psychiatrist, Humphrey Osmond, Huxley was administered mescaline, and was prompted by Osmond to comment on the various stimuli around him, such as books and flowers. The conversation that was recorded in Huxley's book mainly concerned his thoughts on what he said in the recordings. He observed that everyday objects lose their functionality, and suddenly exist \"as such\"; space and dimension become irrelevant, with perceptions seemingly being enlarged, and at times even overwhelming.\n\nAccording to \"The Doors of Perception\" by Aldous Huxley,\nIn \"The Doors of Perception\", Huxley also stated: \"In the final stage of egolessness there is an 'obscure knowledge' that All is in all—that All is actually each. This is as near, I take it, as a finite mind can ever come to 'perceiving everything that is happening everywhere in the universe.'\"\n\nThe Mind at Large is also the name of a psychedelic blues band, from Greater Manchester, who have gained an audience due to their underground free acid parties.\n\n"}

His full name is given as Sayyed Mir Abulqasim Astarabadi (Persian: سید ابولقاسم استرآبادی), and he is famously known as Fendereski. He lived for a while in Isfahan at the same time as Mir Damad spent a great part of his life in India among yogis and Zoroastrians, and learnt certain things from them. He was patronized by both the Safavid and Mughal courts. The famous Persian philosopher Mulla Sadra also studied under him.\n\nMir Fendereski remains a mysterious and enigmatic figure about whom we know very little. He was probably born around 1562-1563 and that he died age eighty.\n\nMir Fendereski was trained in the works of Avicenna as he thought the Avicennian medical and philosophical compendiums of al-Qanun (The Canon) and Al-Shifa (The Cure) in Isfahan.\n\nA number of works are attributed to him, although these have not been studied in detail. He made extensive commentary on the Persian translation of the \"Mahabharata\" (\"Razm-Nama\" in Persian) and the philosophical text of the \"Yoga Vasistha\". \"Resâle Sanaie\", \"Resâleh dar kimiyâ\" and \"Šahre ketabe mahârat\", in Persian language, are some of his most famous works. Also, his criticism of the Persian translation of the \"Yoga Vasistha\" indicates he was familiar with Sanskrit.\n\nHe was also a poet and composed a long philosophical ode (qaṣida ḥekmiya) in imitation of and response to the Persian Ismaʿili thinker Nasir Khusraw. His best-known work is titled \"al-Resāla al-ṣenāʿiya\", an examination of the arts and professions within an ideal society. The importance of this treatise is that it combines a number of genres and subject areas: political and ethical thought, mirrors-for-princes, metaphysics, and the critical subject of the classifications of the sciences.\n\n\n"}

It is actually a spin-off from the Daughters of Mary of the Assumption, which was founded April 1, 1989 by Archbishop Louis Joseph Arthur Melanson in Campbellton, New Brunswick, Canada. The new community started with twenty-nine Sisters from the Daughters of Mary of the Assumption whose main apostolate is education. Upon their arrival in Davao City, the FMA Sisters, as they are popularly called, established schools in many parts of the then Davao Province, presently composed of Davao del Norte, Davao del Sur, Davao Oriental and the newly created Compostela Valley Province.\n\nThe sisters exposure to the harsh realities of the people they serve, many members of the FMA were challenged to discover a new meaning and insight with their charism. These sisters have an increasing desire to respond actively and creatively to the current conditions and needs of the People of God. Thus, they were driven to redefine their presence to the communities refounding an entirely new character to the congregation. \n\nTheir charism articulated their main apostolate: \"We the Missionaries of the Assumption, are called to witness to the incarnate Christ's option for the poor, through active participation in the Church's works of evangelization.

{"id": "3732314", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3732314", "title": "Multiplicity (philosophy)", "text": "Multiplicity (philosophy)\n\nMultiplicity () is an assertion that there is more than one geo-historical trajectory. It is a philosophical concept developed by Edmund Husserl and Henri Bergson from Riemann's description of the mathematical concept. It forms an important part of the philosophy of Gilles Deleuze, particularly in his collaboration with Félix Guattari, \"Capitalism and Schizophrenia\" (1972–80). In his \"Foucault\" (1986), Deleuze describes Michel Foucault's \"The Archaeology of Knowledge\" (1969) as \"the most decisive step yet taken in the theory-practice of multiplicities.\"\n\nThe philosopher Jonathan Roffe describes Deleuze's concept of Multiplicity as follows: \"A multiplicity is, in the most basic sense, a complex structure that does not reference a prior unity. Multiplicities are not parts of a greater whole that have been fragmented, and they cannot be considered manifold expressions of a single concept or transcendent unity. On these grounds, Deleuze opposes the dyad One/Many, in all of its forms, with multiplicity. Further, he insists that the crucial point is to consider multiplicity in its substantive form – a multiplicity – rather than as an adjective – as multiplicity of something. Everything for Deleuze is a multiplicity in this fashion.\"\n\nDeleuze argues in his commentary \"Bergsonism\" (1966) that the notion of multiplicity forms a central part of Bergson's critique of philosophical negativity and the dialectical method. The theory of multiplicities, he explains, must be distinguished from traditional philosophical problems of \"the One and the Multiple.\" By opposing \"the One and the Multiple,\" dialectical philosophy claims \"to reconstruct the real,\" but this claim is false, Bergson argues, since it \"involves abstract concepts that are much too general.\"\n\nInstead of referring to \"the Multiple in general\", Bergson's theory of multiplicities distinguishes between two types of multiplicity: continuous multiplicities and discrete multiplicities (a distinction that he developed from Riemann). The features of this distinction may be tabulated as follows:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "153803", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=153803", "title": "Murray Bookchin", "text": "Murray Bookchin\n\nMurray Bookchin (January 14, 1921 – July 30, 2006) was an American social theorist, author, orator, historian, and political philosopher. A pioneer in the ecology movement, Bookchin formulated and developed the theory of social ecology and urban planning, within anarchist, libertarian socialist, and ecological thought. He was the author of two dozen books covering topics in politics, philosophy, history, urban affairs, and ecology. Among the most important were \"Our Synthetic Environment\" (1962), \"Post-Scarcity Anarchism\" (1971), \"The Ecology of Freedom\" (1982) and \"Urbanization Without Cities\" (1987). In the late-1990s he became disenchanted with the increasingly apolitical lifestylism of the contemporary anarchist movement, stopped referring to himself as an anarchist, and founded his own libertarian socialist ideology called Communalism, which seeks to reconcile Marxist and anarchist thought.\n\nBookchin was a prominent anti-capitalist and advocate of society's decentralisation along ecological and democratic lines. His ideas have influenced social movements since the 1960s, including the New Left, the Anti-Nuclear Movement, the Anti-Globalization Movement, Occupy Wall Street, and more recently, the democratic confederalism of Rojava. He was a central figure in the American Green Movement and the Burlington Greens.\n\nBookchin was born in New York City to Russian Jewish immigrants Nathan Bookchin and Rose (Kaluskaya) Bookchin. He grew up in the Bronx, where his grandmother, Zeitel, a Socialist Revolutionary, imbued him with Russian populist ideas. After her death in 1930, he joined the Young Pioneers, the Communist youth organization (for children 9 to 14) and the Young Communist League (for older children) in 1935. He attended the Workers School near Union Square, where he studied Marxism. In the late 1930s he broke with Stalinism and gravitated toward Trotskyism, joining the Socialist Workers Party (SWP). In the early 1940s he worked in a foundry in Bayonne, New Jersey where he was an organizer and shop steward for the United Electrical Workers as well as a recruiter for the SWP. Within the SWP he adhered to the Goldman-Morrow faction, which broke away after the war ended. He was an auto worker and UAW member at the time of the great General Motors strike of 1945-46. In 1949, while speaking to a Zionist youth organization at City College, Bookchin met a mathematics student, Beatrice Appelstein, whom he married in 1951. They were married for 12 years and lived together for 35, remaining close friends and political allies for the rest of his life. They had two children, Debbie, and Joseph.\n\nFrom 1947, he collaborated with a fellow lapsed Trotskyist, the German expatriate Josef Weber, in New York in the Movement for a Democracy of Content, a group of 20 or so post-Trotskyists who collectively edited the periodical \"Contemporary Issues – A Magazine for a Democracy of Content\". \"Contemporary Issues\" embraced utopianism. The periodical provided a forum for the belief that previous attempts to create utopia had foundered on the necessity of toil and drudgery; but now modern technology had obviated the need for human toil, a liberatory development. To achieve this \"post-scarcity\" society, Bookchin developed a theory of ecological decentralism. The magazine published Bookchin's first articles, including the pathbreaking \"The Problem of Chemicals in Food\" (1952). In 1958, Bookchin defined himself as an anarchist, seeing parallels between anarchism and ecology. His first book, \"Our Synthetic Environment,\" was published under the pseudonym Lewis Herber in 1962, a few months before Rachel Carson's \"Silent Spring\". The book described a broad range of environmental ills but received little attention because of its political radicalism.\n\nIn 1964, Bookchin joined the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), and protested racism at the 1964 World's Fair. During 1964-67, while living on Manhattan's Lower East Side, he cofounded and was the principal figure in the New York Federation of Anarchists. His groundbreaking essay \"Ecology and Revolutionary Thought\" introduced ecology as a concept in radical politics. In 1968, he founded another group that published the influential \"Anarchos\" magazine, which published that and other innovative essays on post-scarcity and on ecological technologies such as solar and wind energy, and on decentralization and miniaturization. Lecturing throughout the United States, he helped popularize the concept of ecology to the counterculture. His widely republished 1969 essay \"Listen, Marxist!\" warned Students for a Democratic Society (in vain) against an impending takeover by a Marxist group. \"Once again the dead are walking in our midst,\" he wrote, \"ironically, draped in the name of Marx, the man who tried to bury the dead of the nineteenth century. So the revolution of our own day can do nothing better than parody, in turn, the October Revolution of 1917 and the civil war of 1918-1920, with its 'class line,' its Bolshevik Party, its 'proletarian dictatorship,' its puritanical morality, and even its slogan, 'Soviet power'\". These and other influential 1960s essays are anthologized in \"Post-Scarcity Anarchism\" (1971)\n\nIn 1969-1970, he taught at Alternate U, a counter-cultural radical school based on 14th Street in Manhattan. In 1971, he moved to Burlington, Vermont with a group of friends, to put into practice his ideas of decentralization. In the fall of 1973, he was hired by Goddard College to lecture on technology; his lectures led to a teaching position and to the creation of the Social Ecology Studies program in 1974 and the Institute for Social Ecology soon thereafter, of which he became the director. In 1974, he was hired by Ramapo College in Mahwah, New Jersey, where he quickly became a full professor. The ISE was a hub for experimentation and study of appropriate technology in the 1970s. In 1977-78 he was a member of the Spruce Mountain Affinity Group of the Clamshell Alliance. Also in 1977, he published \"The Spanish Anarchists\", a history of the Spanish anarchist movement up to the revolution of 1936. During this period, Bookchin forged some ties with the nascent libertarian movement. \"He spoke at a Libertarian Party convention and contributed to a newsletter edited by Karl Hess. In 1976, he told a Libertarian activist that 'If I were a voting man, I'd vote for MacBride' — LP nominee Roger MacBride, that is.\" Bookchin's affiliations to libertarianism during this period reflect his disillusionment with the authoritarianism of Marxist-Leninists, resulting in him stating in a 1979 interview with Jeff Riggenbach that he felt closer to free-market libertarians who defend the rights of the individual at least when compared to the totalitarian Marxist-Leninists. Nevertheless, Bookchin rejected the types of libertarianism that advocated unconstrained individualism.\n\nIn \"From Urbanization to Cities\" (published in 1987 as \"The Rise of Urbanization and the Decline of Citizenship\"), Bookchin traced the democratic traditions that influenced his political philosophy and defined the implementation of the libertarian municipalism concept. A few years later, \"The Politics of Social Ecology\", written by his partner of 19 years, Janet Biehl, briefly summarized these ideas.\n\nIn 1995, Bookchin lamented the decline of American anarchism into primitivism, anti-technologism, neo-situationism, individual self-expression, and \"ad hoc adventurism,\" at the expense of forming a social movement. Arthur Verslius said, \"Bookchin... describes himself as a 'social anarchist' because he looks forward to a (gentle) societal revolution... Bookchin has lit out after those whom he terms 'lifestyle anarchists.'\" The publication of \"Social Anarchism or Lifestyle Anarchism\" in 1995, criticizing this tendency, was startling to anarchists. Thereafter Bookchin concluded that American anarchism was essentially individualistic and broke with anarchism publicly in 1999. He placed his ideas into a new political ideology: Communalism (spelled with a capital \"C\" to differentiate it from other forms of communalism), a form of libertarian socialism that retains his ideas about assembly democracy and the necessity of decentralization of settlement, power/money/influence, agriculture, manufacturing, etc.\n\nIn addition to his political writings, Bookchin wrote extensively on philosophy, calling his ideas dialectical naturalism. The dialectical writings of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, which articulate a developmental philosophy of change and growth, seemed to him to lend themselves to an organic, even ecological approach. Although Hegel \"exercised a considerable influence\" on Bookchin, he was not, in any sense, a Hegelian. His philosophical writings emphasize humanism, rationality, and the ideals of the Enlightenment. His last major published work was \"The Third Revolution\", a four-volume history of the libertarian movements in European and American revolutions.\n\nHe continued to teach at the ISE until 2004. Bookchin died of congestive heart failure on July 30, 2006, at his home in Burlington at the age of 85.\n\nBookchin was critical of class-centered analysis of Marxism and simplistic anti-state forms of libertarianism and liberalism and wished to present what he saw as a more complex view of societies. In \"The Ecology of Freedom: The Emergence and Dissolution of Hierarchy,\" he says that:\nMy use of the word hierarchy in the subtitle of this work is meant to be provocative. There is a strong theoretical need to contrast hierarchy with the more widespread use of the words class and State; careless use of these terms can produce a dangerous simplification of social reality. To use the words hierarchy, class, and State interchangeably, as many social theorists do, is insidious and obscurantist. This practice, in the name of a \"classless\" or \"libertarian\" society, could easily conceal the existence of hierarchical relationships and a hierarchical sensibility, both of which-even in the absence of economic exploitation or political coercion-would serve to perpetuate unfreedom.\nBookchin also points to an accumulation of hierarchical systems throughout history that has occurred up to contemporary societies which tends to determine the human collective and individual psyche:\nThe objective history of the social structure becomes internalized as a subjective history of the psychic structure. Heinous as my view may be to modern Freudians, it is not the discipline of work but the discipline of rule that demands the repression of internal nature. This repression then extends outward to external nature as a mere object of rule and later of exploitation. This mentality permeates our individual psyches in a cumulative form up to the present day-not merely as capitalism but as the vast history of hierarchical society from its inception.\nMurray Bookchin's clarion call about humanity's collision course with the natural world, Our Synthetic Environment, was published six months before Rachel Carson's \"Silent Spring.\"\n\nBookchin rejected Barry Commoner's belief that the environmental crisis could be traced to technological choices, Paul Ehrlich's views that it could be traced to overpopulation, or the even more pessimistic view that traces this crisis to human nature. Rather, Bookchin felt that our environmental predicament is the result of the cancerous logic of capitalism, a system aimed at maximizing profit instead of enriching human lives: \"By the very logic of its grow-or-die imperative, capitalism may well be producing ecological crises that gravely imperil the integrity of life on this planet.\"\n\nThe solution to this crisis is not a return to the xenophobia and constant warfare of hunter-gatherer societies. Bookchin likewise opposed \"a politics of mere protest, lacking programmatic content, a proposed alternative, and a movement to give people direction and continuity.\" We need\"a constant awareness that a given society's irrationality is deep seated, that its serious pathologies are not isolated problems that can be cured piecemeal but must be solved by sweeping changes in the often hidden sources of crisis and suffering—that awareness alone is what can hold a movement together, give it continuity, preserve its message and organization beyond a given generation, and expand its ability to deal with new issues and developments.\"The answer then lies in Communalism, a system encompassing a directly democratic political organization anchored in loosely confederated popular assemblies, decentralization of power, absence of domination of any kind, and replacing capitalism with human-centered forms of production.\n\nIn the history of political ecology, social ecology is not a movement but a theory primarily associated with Bookchin and elaborated over his body of work. He presents a utopian philosophy of human evolution that combines the nature of biology and society into a third \"thinking nature\" beyond biochemistry and physiology, which he argues is a more complete, conscious, ethical, and rational nature. Humanity, by this line of thought, is the latest development from the long history of organic development on Earth. Bookchin's social ecology proposes ethical principles for replacing a society's propensity for hierarchy and domination with that of democracy and freedom.\n\nBookchin wrote about the effects of urbanization on human life in the early 1960s during his participation in the civil rights and related social movements. Bookchin then began to pursue the connection between ecological and social issues, culminating with his best-known book, \"The Ecology of Freedom\", which he had developed over a decade. His argument, that human domination and destruction of nature follows from social domination between humans, was a breakthrough position in the growing field of ecology. Life develops from self-organization and evolutionary cooperation (symbiosis). Bookchin writes of preliterate societies organized around mutual need but ultimately overrun by institutions of hierarchy and domination, such as city-states and capitalist economies, which he attributes uniquely to societies of humans and not communities of animals. He proposes confederation between communities of humans run through democracy rather than through administrative logistics.\n\nStarting in the 1970s, Bookchin argued that the arena for libertarian social change should be the municipal level. In \"The Next Revolution\", Bookchin stresses the link that libertarian municipalism has with his earlier philosophy of social ecology. He writes:\n\n\"Libertarian Municipalism constitutes the politics of social ecology, a revolutionary effort in which freedom is given institutional form in public assemblies that become decision-making bodies.\"\n\nBookchin proposes that these institutional forms must take place within differently scaled local areas. In a 2001 interview he summarized his views this way: \"The overriding problem is to change the structure of society so that people gain power. The best arena to do that is the municipality—the city, town, and village—where we have an opportunity to create a face-to-face democracy.\" In 1980 Bookchin used the term \"libertarian municipalism\", to describe a system in which libertarian institutions of directly democratic assemblies would oppose and replace the state with a confederation of free municipalities. Libertarian municipalism intends to create a situation in which the two powers—the municipal confederations and the nation-state—cannot coexist. Its supporters—Communalists—believe it to be the means to achieve a rational society, and its structure becomes the organization of society.\n\nThough Bookchin, by his own recognition, failed to win over a substantial body of supporters during his own lifetime, his ideas have nonetheless influenced movements and thinkers across the globe.\n\nNotable among these is the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), an organisation in Turkey which has fought the Turkish state since the 1980s to try to secure greater political and cultural rights for the country's Kurds. Though founded on a rigid Marxist–Leninist ideology, the PKK has seen a shift in its thought and aims since the capture and imprisonment of its leader, Abdullah Öcalan, in 1999. Öcalan began reading a variety of post-Marxist political theory while in prison, and found particular currency in Bookchin's works.\n\nÖcalan attempted in early 2004 to arrange a meeting with Bookchin through his lawyers, describing himself as Bookchin's \"student\" eager to adapt his thought to Middle Eastern society. Bookchin was too ill to accept the request. In May 2004 Bookchin conveyed this message \"My hope is that the Kurdish people will one day be able to establish a free, rational society that will allow their brilliance once again to flourish. They are fortunate indeed to have a leader of Mr. Öcalan's talents to guide them\". When Bookchin died in 2006, the PKK hailed the American thinker as \"one of the greatest social scientists of the 20th century\", and vowed to put his theory into practice.\n\n\"Democratic Confederalism\", the variation on Communalism developed by Öcalan in his writings and adopted by the PKK, does not outwardly seek Kurdish rights within the context of the formation of an independent state separate from Turkey. The PKK claims that this project is not envisioned as being only for Kurds, but rather for all peoples of the region, regardless of their ethnic, national, or religious background. Rather, it promulgates the formation of assemblies and organisations beginning at the grassroots level to enact its ideals in a non-state framework beginning at the local level. It also places a particular emphasis on securing and promoting women's rights. The PKK has had some success in implementing its programme, through organisations such as the Democratic Society Congress (DTK), which coordinates political and social activities within Turkey, and the Koma Civakên Kurdistan (KCK), which does so across all countries where Kurds live.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "23519", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23519", "title": "Paul Valéry", "text": "Paul Valéry\n\nAmbroise Paul Toussaint Jules Valéry (; 30 October 1871 – 20 July 1945) was a French poet, essayist, and philosopher. In addition to his poetry and fiction (drama and dialogues), his interests included aphorisms on art, history, letters, music, and current events. Valéry was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 12 different years.\n\nValéry was born to a Corsican father and Genoese-Istrian mother in Sète, a town on the Mediterranean coast of the Hérault, but he was raised in Montpellier, a larger urban center close by. After a traditional Roman Catholic education, he studied law at university and then resided in Paris for most of the remainder of his life, where he was, for a while, part of the circle of Stéphane Mallarmé.\n\nIn 1900, he married Jeannie Gobillard, a friend of Stéphane Mallarmé's family, who was also a niece of the painter Berthe Morisot. The wedding was a double ceremony in which the bride's cousin, Morisot's daughter, Julie Manet, married the painter Ernest Rouart. Valéry and Gobillard had three children: Claude, Agathe and François.\n\nValéry served as a juror with Florence Meyer Blumenthal in awarding the Prix Blumenthal, a grant given between 1919 and 1954 to young French painters, sculptors, decorators, engravers, writers, and musicians.\n\nThough his earliest publications date from his mid-twenties, Valéry did not become a full-time writer until 1920, when the man for whom he worked as private secretary, a former chief executive of the Havas news agency, Edouard Lebey, died of Parkinson's disease. Until then, Valéry had, briefly, earned his living at the Ministry of War before assuming the relatively flexible post as assistant to the increasingly impaired Lebey, a job he held for some twenty years.\n\nAfter his election to the Académie française in 1925, Valéry became a tireless public speaker and intellectual figure in French society, touring Europe and giving lectures on cultural and social issues as well as assuming a number of official positions eagerly offered to him by an admiring French nation. He represented France on cultural matters at the League of Nations, and he served on several of its committees, including the sub-committee on Arts and Letters of the Committee on Intellectual Cooperation. The English-language collection \"The Outlook for Intelligence\" (1989) contains translations of a dozen essays related to these activities. \n\nIn 1931, he founded the Collège International de Cannes, a private institution teaching French language and civilization. The Collège is still operating today, offering professional courses for native speakers (for educational certification, law and business) as well as courses for foreign students.\n\nHe gave the keynote address at the 1932 German national celebration of the 100th anniversary of the death of Johann Wolfgang Goethe. This was a fitting choice, as Valéry shared Goethe's fascination with science (specifically, biology and optics).\n\nIn addition to his activities as a member of the Académie française, he was also a member of the Academy of Sciences of Lisbon, and of the \"Front national des Ecrivains\". In 1937, he was appointed chief executive of what later became the University of Nice. He was the inaugural holder of the Chair of Poetics at the Collège de France.\n\nDuring World War II, the Vichy regime stripped him of some of these jobs and distinctions because of his quiet refusal to collaborate with Vichy and the German occupation, but Valéry continued, throughout these troubled years, to publish and to be active in French cultural life, especially as a member of the Académie française.\n\nValéry died in Paris in 1945. He is buried in the cemetery of his native town, Sète, the same cemetery celebrated in his famous poem \"Le Cimetière marin\".\n\nValéry is best known as a poet, and he is sometimes considered to be the last of the French symbolists. However, he published fewer than a hundred poems, and none of them drew much attention. On the night of 4 October 1892, during a heavy storm, Paul Valéry underwent an existential crisis, an event that made a huge impact on his writing career. Eventually, around 1898, he quit writing altogether, publishing not a word for nearly twenty years. This hiatus was in part due to the death of his mentor, Stéphane Mallarmé. When, in 1917, he finally broke his 'great silence' with the publication of \"La Jeune Parque\"; he was forty-six years of age.\n\nThis obscure, but sublimely musical, masterpiece, of 512 alexandrine lines in rhyming couplets, had taken him four years to complete, and it immediately secured his fame. With \"Le Cimetière marin\" and \"L'Ébauche d'un serpent,\" it is often considered one of the greatest French poems of the twentieth century.\n\nThe title was chosen late in the poem's gestation; it refers to the youngest of the three \"Parcae\" (the minor Roman deities also called \"The Fates\"), though for some readers the connection with that mythological figure is tenuous and problematic.\n\nThe poem is written in the first person, and is the soliloquy of a young woman contemplating life and death, engagement and withdrawal, love and estrangement, in a setting dominated by the sea, the sky, stars, rocky cliffs, and the rising sun. However, it is also possible to read the poem as an allegory on the way fate moves human affairs or as an attempt to comprehend the horrific violence in Europe at the time of the poem's composition. The poem is not about World War I, but it does try to address the relationships between destruction and beauty, and, in this sense, it resonates with ancient Greek meditations on these matters, especially in the plays of Sophocles and Aeschylus. There are, therefore, evident links with \"le Cimetière marin\", which is also a seaside meditation on comparably large themes.\n\nBefore \"la Jeune Parque\", Valéry's only publications of note were dialogues, articles, some poems, and a study of Leonardo da Vinci. In 1920 and 1922, he published two slim collections of verses. The first, \"Album des vers anciens\" (Album of old verses), was a revision of early but beautifully wrought smaller poems, some of which had been published individually before 1900. The second, \"Charmes\" (from the Latin \"carmina\", meaning \"songs\" and also \"incantations\"), further confirmed his reputation as a major French poet. The collection includes \"le Cimetière marin\", and many smaller poems with diverse structures. 'Le Cimetière marin' is mentioned or indirectly implied or referred to in at least four of Iris Murdoch's novels, The Unicorn, The Time of the Angels, The Nice and the Good and The Sea, The Sea.\n\nValéry's technique is quite orthodox in its essentials. His verse rhymes and scans in conventional ways, and it has much in common with the work of Mallarmé. His poem, \"Palme\", inspired James Merrill's celebrated 1974 poem \"Lost in Translation\", and his cerebral lyricism also influenced the American poet, Edgar Bowers.\n\nHis far more ample prose writings, peppered with many aphorisms and \"bons mots\", reveal a skeptical outlook on human nature, verging on the cynical. His view of state power was broadly liberal insofar as he believed that state power and infringements on the individual should be severely limited. Although he had flirted with nationalist ideas during the 1890s, he moved away from them by 1899, and believed that European culture owed its greatness to the ethnic diversity and universalism of the Roman Empire. He denounced the myth of \"racial purity\" and argued that such purity, if it existed, would only lead to stagnation -- thus the mixing of races was necessary for progress and cultural development. In \"America as a Projection of the European Mind\", Valéry remarked that whenever he despaired about Europe's situation, he could \"restore some degree of hope only by thinking of\nthe New World\" and mused on the \"happy variations\" which could result from European \"aesthetic ideas filtering into the powerful character of native Mexican art.\" \n\nRaymond Poincaré, Louis de Broglie, André Gide, Henri Bergson, and Albert Einstein all respected Valéry's thinking and became friendly correspondents. Valéry was often asked to write articles on topics not of his choosing; the resulting intellectual journalism was collected in five volumes titled \"Variétés\".\n\nValéry's most striking achievement is perhaps his monumental intellectual diary, called the \"Cahiers\" (Notebooks). Early every morning of his adult life, he contributed something to the \"Cahiers\", prompting him to write: \"Having dedicated those hours to the life of the mind, I thereby earn the right to be stupid for the rest of the day.\"\n\nThe subjects of his \"Cahiers\" entries often were, surprisingly, reflections on science and mathematics. In fact, arcane topics in these domains appear to have commanded far more of his considered attention than his celebrated poetry. The \"Cahiers\" also contain the first drafts of many aphorisms he later included in his books. To date, the \"Cahiers\" have been published in their entirety only as photostatic reproductions, and only since 1980 have they begun to receive scholarly scrutiny. The \"Cahiers\" have been translated into English in five volumes published by Peter Lang with the title \"Cahiers/Notebooks\".\n\nIn recent decades Valéry's thought has been considered a touchstone in the field of constructivist epistemology, as noted, for instance, by Jean-Louis Le Moigne in his description of constructivist history.\n\nOne of three epigraphs in Cormac McCarthy's novel Blood Meridian is from Valéry's Writing at the Yalu River (1895):\n\n\"Your ideas are terrifying and your hearts are faint. Your acts of pity and cruelty are absurd, committed with no calm, as if they were irresistible. Finally, you fear blood more and more. Blood and time.\"\n\nIn the book \"El laberinto de la soledad\" from Octavio Paz (postdata-third edition), we find three verses of one of Valéry's poems: \n\"Je pense, sur le bord doré de l’univers\nA ce gout de périr qui prend la Pythonisse\nEn qui mugit l’espoir que le monde finisse.\"\nOscar-winning Japanese director Hayao Miyazaki's 2013 film \"The Wind Rises\" and the Japanese novel of the same name (on which the film was partially based) take their title from Valéry's verse \"Le vent se lève... il faut tenter de vivre !\" (\"The wind rises… We must try to live!\") in the poem \"Le Cimetière marin\" (\"The Graveyard by the Sea\"). The same quote is used in the closing sentences of Anthony Burgess's 1962 novel The Wanting Seed.\n\n\" (1888)\n\nIn English translation:\n\n\n\n"}

As he explains it, modern and postmodern individualism and statism have always been connected of the hip, at least since the advent of Rousseau's thought, if not well before that in the work of Hobbes. In a series of articles in both \"The Guardian\" and \"The Independent\" he has argued for a wider recognition of the merits of civic conservatism and an appreciation of the potentially transformative impact of a new Tory settlement. \n\nIn 2010, \"The Daily Telegraph\" called him \"a driving force behind David Cameron's 'Big Society' agenda.\"\n\nBlond is a fellow of the National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "40976066", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40976066", "title": "Proxemic communication strategies", "text": "Proxemic communication strategies\n\nProxemic communication deals with the ways that what is communicated in face-to-face conversations may go beyond the overt information being imparted. The communication may be influenced by degree of proximity and by non-verbal signals including touch, and varies between different cultures. Research in this field has been carried out on cross-cultural differences, and on interaction in counseling and clinical settings.\n\nProxemics is one of several subcategories of the study of nonverbal communication. Proxemics can be defined as \"the interrelated observations and theories of man's use of space as a specialized elaboration of culture\". The term was coined in 1963 by the cultural anthropologist Edward T. Hall.\n\nIn his work on proxemics, Hall separated his theory into two overarching categories: personal space and territory. \"Personal space\" describes the immediate space surrounding a person, while \"territory\" refers to the area which a person may \"lay claim to\" and defend against others.\n\nAccording to Xu Lin’s article on Cultural Dimensions and Conversational Strategies, \"Cultural factors have a great impact on conversational techniques\", and there are two basic elements consisted in all conversations: \"informational\" and \"communicative\". The informational function deals with passing information to another individual; this is known as the information focused element. Whereas, the communicative function deals with the social principle or aim in the conversation, also known as the element that deals with social relationships and drawing closer to people. Xu Lin studies the different classifications of nonverbal communication brought forth by Edward T. Hall (1959). The different dimensions brought forth by Xu Lin and Prabhu include: Intimate, Personal, Social and Public Distances.\n\nOne of the primary methods used among Kim, D., Pan, Y., & Park, H. (1998), Merkin, R. S. (2006), Albas, C. (1991) and Graves, J. R., & Robinson, J. D. included Likert-type measures of sampling. Participants would be given surveys, videotaped and observed while receiving responding to oral questions posed by formally dressed interviewers. Each study consisted of a controlled group and an experimental group and would measure each individual in a specific manner in order to bring forth accurate results. Each method included a sampling base of volunteers with cheap compensation such as a two dollar reward or extra credit in the class taking part in the experiment.\n\nDiBiase describes touch as differentiating depending on various aspects. All people touch and are touched by others, but there are vast differences in the amount of touching that people do. For example, touching appears to vary by gender, culture, and even age. Although these particular differences in touching behavior are not well understood, historically investigators have thought of touch as expressing control and dominance.\n\nNot only does touch vary by culture, but also age and gender. They continue to explain how some researchers have suggested that some cultures, such as Middle Eastern, Latin America and Southern Europe, could be considered high-contact cultures (interact at closer distances and touch more frequently) much more in social conversations than people from non-contact cultures such as the USA and Northern Europe.\n\nResearch by Graves (1976), and Robinson (1976), suggests that an individual's nonverbal behavior is capable of communicating information about the particular individual's feelings and attitudes, regardless of the culture. However, from his research he concluded that the prominent role was in fact played by nonverbal communication in determining the total meaning of the message, and that the message being conveyed could very well differ depending on the context. Among his findings was that within the client-counselor relationship, the consistency or inconsistency between the counselor's verbal and nonverbal behaviors has been found to be an important determinant of the client's impressions of the counselor as well as of the client's proxemics behavior.\n\nAlbas (1991) studied the comfortable proxemic distances assumed by Canadian female students. The cultural group and sex was held constant; however, the comfortable distances seemed to vary from situation to situation. Preston (2005) discusses the proxemics in clinical and administrative settings. He came to the conclusion that the proximity of people to one another when they interact and the configuration of work areas send a message that affects people in different ways. One of his main suggestions was to use observation skills in understanding how and why others interact within or outside their own space. He claims that people choose to rely on their imagination to better receive unspoken messages sent by others through their spatial interactions.\n"}
{"id": "3296395", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3296395", "title": "Sati (Buddhism)", "text": "Sati (Buddhism)\n\nSati (in Pali; Sanskrit: \"smṛti\") is mindfulness or awareness, a spiritual or psychological faculty (\"indriya\") that forms an essential part of Buddhist practice. It is the first factor of the Seven Factors of Enlightenment. \"Correct\" or \"right\" mindfulness (Pali: \"sammā-sati\", Sanskrit \"samyak-smṛti\") is the seventh element of the Noble Eightfold Path.\n\nThe Buddhist term translated into English as \"mindfulness\" originates in the Pali term \"sati\" and in its Sanskrit counterpart smṛti. According to Robert Sharf, the meaning of these terms has been the topic of extensive debate and discussion. \"Smṛti\" originally meant \"to remember\", \"to recollect\", \"to bear in mind\", as in the Vedic tradition of remembering sacred texts. The term \"sati\" also means \"to remember\". In the \"Satipațțhāna-sutta\" the term \"sati\" means to maintain awareness of reality, whereby the true nature of phenomena can be seen. Sharf refers to the Milindapanha, which explained that the arisement of \"sati\" calls to mind the wholesome dhammas such as the four establishments of mindfulness, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven awakening-factors, the Noble Eightfold Path, and the attainment of insight.\nAccording to Rupert Gethin, \nSharf further notes that this has little to do with \"bare attention\", the popular contemporary interpretation of \"sati\", \"since it entails, among other things, the proper discrimination of the moral valence of phenomena as they arise\". According to Paul Williams, referring to Erich Frauwallner, mindfulness provided the way to liberation, \"constantly watching sensory experience in order to prevent the arising of cravings which would power future experience into rebirths\". According to Vetter, \"dhyana\" may have been the original core practice of the Buddha, which aided the maintenance of mindfulness.\n\nThe Buddhist term translated into English as \"mindfulness\" originates in the Pali term \"sati\" and in its Sanskrit counterpart \"smṛti\". Translators rendered the Sanskrit word as \"trenpa\" in Tibetan (wylie: \"dran pa\") and as \"nian\" 念 in Chinese.\n\nThe Pali-language scholar Thomas William Rhys Davids (1843–1922) first translated \"\" in 1881 as English \"\" in \"sammā-sati\" \"Right Mindfulness; the active, watchful mind\". Noting that Daniel John Gogerly (1845) initially rendered \"sammā-sati\" as \"Correct meditation\", Davids explained, \nHenry Alabaster, in \"The Wheel of the Law: Buddhism Illustrated From Siamese Sources by the Modern Buddhist, A Life of Buddha, and an Account of the Phrabat\" (1871), had earlier defined \"Satipatthan/Smrityupasthana\" as \"The act of keeping one's self mindful.\"\n\nThe English term \"mindfulness\" already existed before it came to be used in a (western) Buddhist context. It was first recorded as \"myndfulness\" in 1530 (John Palsgrave translates French \"pensee\"), as \"mindfulnesse\" in 1561, and \"mindfulness\" in 1817. Morphologically earlier terms include \"mindful\" (first recorded in 1340), \"mindfully\" (1382), and the obsolete \"mindiness\" (ca. 1200).\n\nJohn D. Dunne, an associate professor at Emory University whose current research focuses especially on the concept of \"mindfulness\" in both theoretical and practical contexts, asserts that the translation of \"sati\" and \"smṛti\" as mindfulness is confusing and that a number of Buddhist scholars have started trying to establish \"retention\" as the preferred alternative.\n\nBhikkhu Bodhi also points to the meaning of \"sati\" as \"memory\":\nThe Sanskrit word \"smṛti\" स्मृति (also transliterated variously as \"smriti\", \"smRti\", or \"sm'Rti\") literally means \"that which is remembered\", and refers both to \"mindfulness\" in Buddhism and \"a category of metrical texts\" in Hinduism, considered second in authority to the \"Śruti\" scriptures.\n\nMonier Monier-Williams's \"Sanskrit-English Dictionary\" differentiates eight meanings of \"smṛti\" स्मृति, \"remembrance, reminiscence, thinking of or upon, calling to mind, memory\":\n\nBuddhist scholars translated \"smṛti\" with the Chinese word \"nian\" 念 \"study; read aloud; think of; remember; remind\". \"Nian\" is commonly used in Modern Standard Chinese words such as \"guannian\" 觀念 (观念) \"concept; idea\", \"huainian\" 懷念 (怀念) \"cherish the memory of; think of\", \"nianshu\" 念書 (念书) \"read; study\", and \"niantou\" 念頭 (念头) \"thought; idea; intention\". Two specialized Buddhist terms are \"nianfo\" 念佛 \"chant the name of Buddha; pray to Buddha\" and \"nianjing\" 念經 (念经) \"chant/recite sutras\".\n\nThis Chinese character \"nian\" 念 is composed of \"jin\" \"now; this\" and \"xin\" \"heart; mind\". Bernhard Karlgren graphically explains \"nian\" meaning \"reflect, think; to study, learn by heart, remember; recite, read – to have 今 present to 心 the mind\". The Chinese character \"nian\" or \"nien\" 念 is pronounced as Korean \"yeom\" or \"yŏm\" 염, Japanese ネン or \"nen\", and Vietnamese \"niệm\".\n\n\"A Dictionary of Chinese Buddhist Terms\" gives basic translations of \"nian\": \"Recollection, memory; to think on, reflect; repeat, intone; a thought; a moment.\"\n\nThe \"Digital Dictionary of Buddhism\" gives more detailed translations of \"nian\" \"mindfulness, memory\":\n\nThe terms sati/smriti have been translated as:\n\nOriginally, mindfulness provided the way to liberation, by paying attention to sensory experience, preventing the arising of disturbing thoughts and emotions which cause the further chain of reacions leading to rebirth. In the later tradition, especially Theravada, mindfulness is an antidote to delusion (Pali: \"Moha\"), and is considered as such one of the 'powers' (Pali: \"bala\") that contribute to the attainment of nirvana, in particular when it is coupled with clear comprehension of whatever is taking place. Nirvana is a state of being in which greed, hatred and delusion (Pali: \"moha\") have been overcome and abandoned, and are absent from the mind.\n\nThe Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta (Sanskrit: \"Smṛtyupasthāna Sūtra\") is an early text dealing with mindfulness. The Theravada Nikayas prescribe that one should establish mindfulness (\"satipaṭṭhāna\") in one's day-to-day life, maintaining as much as possible a calm awareness of the four \"upassanā\": one's body, feelings, mind, and dharmas.\n\nAccording to Grzegorz Polak, the four \"upassanā\" have been misunderstood by the developing Buddhist tradition, including Theravada, to refer to four different foundations. According to Polak, the four \"upassanā\" do not refer to four different foundations, but to the awareness of four different aspects of raising mindfulness:\n\nRupert Gethin notes that the contemporary Vipassana movement interprets the \"Satipatthana Sutta\" as \"describing a pure form of insight (vipassanā) meditation\" for which \"samatha\" (calm) and \"jhāna\" are not necessary. Yet, in pre-sectarian Buddhism, the establishment of mindfulness was placed before the practice of the \"jhanas\", and associated with the abandonment of the five hindrances and the entry into the first \"jhana\".\n\nAccording to Paul Williams, referring to Erich Frauwallner, mindfulness provided the way to liberation, \"constantly watching sensory experience in order to prevent the arising of cravings which would power future experience into rebirths.\" Buddhadasa also argued that mindfulness provides the means to prevent the arising of disturbing thought and emotions, which cause the further chain of reactions leading to rebirth of the ego and selfish thought and behavior.\n\nAccording to Vetter, \"dhyana\" may have been the original core practice of the Buddha, which aided the maintenance of mindfulness.\n\n\"Satii\" was famously translated as \"bare attention\" by Nyanaponika Thera. Yet, in Buddhist practice, \"mindfulness\" is more than just \"bare attention\"; it has the more comprehensive and active meaning of \"samprajaña\", \"clear comprehension,\" and \"apramāda,\" \"vigilance\". All three terms are sometimes (confusingly) translated as \"mindfulness\", but they all have specific shades of meaning.\n\nIn a publicly available correspondence between Bhikkhu Bodhi and B. Alan Wallace, Bodhi has described Ven. Nyanaponika Thera's views on \"right mindfulness\" and sampajañña as follows:\nIn the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta, sati and sampajañña are combined with \"atappa\" (Pali; Sanskrit: \"ātapaḥ\"), or \"ardency,\" and the three together comprise \"yoniso manisikara\" (Pali; Sanskrit: \"yoniśas manaskāraḥ\"), \"appropriate attention\" or \"wise reflection.\"\n\nĀnāpānasati (Pali; Sanskrit: \"ānāpānasmṛti\"; Chinese: 安那般那; Pīnyīn: \"ānnàbānnà\"; Sinhala: ආනා පානා සති), meaning \"mindfulness of breathing\" (\"sati\" means mindfulness; \"ānāpāna\" refers to inhalation and exhalation), is a form of Buddhist meditation now common to the Tibetan, Zen, Tiantai, and Theravada schools of Buddhism, as well as western-based mindfulness programs. Anapanasati means to feel the sensations caused by the movements of the breath in the body, as is practiced in the context of mindfulness. According to tradition, Anapanasati was originally taught by the Buddha in several sutras including the \"Ānāpānasati Sutta\". (MN 118)\n\nThe Āgamas of early Buddhism discuss ten forms of mindfulness. According to Nan Huaijin, the Ekottara Āgama emphasizes mindfulness of breathing more than any of the other methods, and provides the most specific teachings on this one form of mindfulness.\n\nSatipatthana, as four foundations of mindfulness, c.q. anapanasati, \"mindfulness of breathing,\" is being employed to attain Vipassanā (Pāli), insight into the true nature of reality as impermanent and \"anatta\", c.q. \"sunyata\", lacking any permanent essence.\n\nIn the Theravadin context, this entails insight into the three marks of existence, namely the impermanence of and the unsatisfactoriness of every conditioned thing that exists, and non-self. In Mahayana contexts, it entails insight into what is variously described as sunyata, dharmata, the inseparability of appearance and emptiness (two truths doctrine), clarity and emptiness, or bliss and emptiness.\n\nVipassanā is commonly used as one of two poles for the categorization of types of Buddhist practice, the other being samatha (Pāli; Sanskrit: \"śamatha\"). Though both terms appear in the Sutta Pitaka, Gombrich and Brooks argue that the distinction as two \"separate\" paths originates in the earliest \"interpretations\" of the Sutta Pitaka, not in the suttas themselves. \"Vipassana\" and \"samatha\" are described as qualities which contribute to the development of mind (\"bhāvanā\"). According to Vetter, Bronkhorst and Gombrich, discriminating insight into transiency as a separate path to liberation was a later development, under pressure of developments in Indian religious thinking, which saw \"liberating insight\" as essential to liberation. This may also have been due to an over-literal interpretation by later scholastics of the terminology used by the Buddha, and to the problems involved with the practice of \"dhyana\", and the need to develop an easier method. Accoridng to Wynne, the Buddha combined meditative stabilisation with mindful awareness and \"an insight into the nature of this meditative experience.\"\n\nVarious traditions disagree which techniques belong to which pole. According to the contemporary Theravada orthodoxy, samatha is used as a preparation for vipassanā, pacifying the mind and strengthening the concentration in order to allow the work of insight, which leads to liberation.\n\nVipassanā-meditation has gained popularity in the west through the modern Buddhist vipassana movement, modeled after Theravāda Buddhism meditation practices, which employs vipassanā and ānāpāna (\"anapanasati\", mindfulness of breathing) meditation as its primary techniques and places emphasis on the teachings of the Sutta.\n\nMindfulness practice, inherited from the Buddhist tradition, is being employed in psychology to alleviate a variety of mental and physical conditions, including obsessive-compulsive disorder, anxiety, and in the prevention of relapse in depression and drug addiction.\n\nGeorges Dreyfus has expressed unease with the definition of mindfulness as \"bare attention\" or \"nonelaborative, nonjudgmental, present-centered awareness\", stressing that mindfulness in Buddhist context means also \"remembering\", which indicates that the function of mindfulness also includes the retention of information. Dreyfus concludes his examination by stating:\nRobert H. Sharf notes that Buddhist practice is aimed at the attainment of \"correct view\", not just \"bare attention\":\nJay L. Garfield, quoting Shantideva and other sources, stresses that mindfulness is constituted by the union of two functions, \"calling to mind\" and vigilantly \"retaining in mind\". He demonstrates that there is a direct connection between the practice of mindfulness and the cultivation of morality – at least in the context of Buddhism from which modern interpretations of mindfulness are stemming.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "164126", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=164126", "title": "Strategic lawsuit against public participation", "text": "Strategic lawsuit against public participation\n\nA strategic lawsuit against public participation (SLAPP) is a lawsuit that is intended to censor, intimidate, and silence critics by burdening them with the cost of a legal defense until they abandon their criticism or opposition. Such lawsuits have been made illegal in many jurisdictions on the grounds that they impede freedom of speech.\n\nIn the typical SLAPP, the plaintiff does not normally expect to win the lawsuit. The plaintiff's goals are accomplished if the defendant succumbs to fear, intimidation, mounting legal costs, or simple exhaustion and abandons the criticism. In some cases, repeated frivolous litigation against a defendant may raise the cost of directors and officers liability insurance for that party, interfering with an organization's ability to operate. A SLAPP may also intimidate others from participating in the debate. A SLAPP is often preceded by a legal threat.\n\nThere is a difficulty in that plaintiffs do not present themselves to the court admitting that their intent is to censor, intimidate, or silence their critics. Hence, the difficulty in drafting SLAPP legislation, and in applying it, is to craft an approach which affords an early termination to invalid abusive suits, without denying a legitimate day in court to valid good faith claims. Thus, anti-SLAPP laws target tactics used by SLAPP plaintiffs. Common anti-SLAPP laws include measures such as penalties for plaintiffs who file lawsuits ruled frivolous and special procedures where a defendant may ask a judge to consider that a lawsuit is a SLAPP (and usually subsequently dismiss the suit).\n\nAnti-SLAPP laws occasionally come under criticism from those who believe that there should not be barriers to the right to petition for those who sincerely believe they have been wronged, regardless of ulterior motives. Nonetheless, anti-SLAPP laws are generally considered to have a favorable effect, and many lawyers have fought to enact stronger laws protecting against SLAPPs.\n\nSLAPPs take various forms. The most common used to be a civil suit for defamation, which in the English common law tradition was a tort. The common law of libel dates to the early 17th century and, unlike most English law, is reverse onus, meaning that once someone alleges a statement is libelous, the burden is on the defendant to prove that it is not. In England and Wales, the Defamation Act 2013 removed most of the uses of defamation as a SLAPP by requiring the proof of special damage. Various abusive uses of this law including political libel (criticism of the political actions or views of others) have ceased to exist in most places, but persist in some jurisdictions (notably British Columbia and Ontario) where political views can be held as defamatory.\n\nA common feature of SLAPPs is forum shopping, wherein plaintiffs find courts that are more favourable towards the claims to be brought than the court in which the defendant (or sometimes plaintiffs) live.\n\nOther widely mentioned elements of a SLAPP are the actual effectiveness at silencing critics, the timing of the suit, inclusion of extra or spurious defendants (such as relatives or hosts of legitimate defendants), inclusion of plaintiffs with no real claim (such as corporations that are affiliated with legitimate plaintiffs), making claims that are very difficult to disprove or rely on no written record, ambiguous or deliberately mangled wording that lets plaintiffs make spurious allegations without fear of perjury, refusal to consider any settlement (or none other than cash), characterization of all offers to settle as insincere, extensive and unnecessary demands for discovery, attempts to identify anonymous or pseudonymous critics, appeals on minor points of law, demands for broad rulings when appeal is accepted on such minor points of law, and attempts to run up defendants' costs even if this clearly costs more to the plaintiffs.\n\nSeveral jurisdictions have passed anti-SLAPP laws, designed to quickly remove cases out of court. In many cases, the plaintiff is also required to pay a penalty for bringing the case, known as a SLAPP-back.\n\nThe acronym was coined in the 1980s by University of Denver professors Penelope Canan and George W. Pring. The term was originally defined as \"a lawsuit involving communications made to influence a governmental action or outcome, which resulted in a civil complaint or counterclaim filed against nongovernment individuals or organizations on a substantive issue of some public interest or social significance.\" The concept's originators later dropped the notion that government contact had to be about a public issue to be protected by the Right to Petition the Government, as provided in the First Amendment. It has since been defined less broadly by some states, and more broadly in one state (California) where it includes suits about speech on any public issue.\n\nThe original conceptualization proffered by Canan and Pring emphasized the right to petition as protected in the United States under the US Constitution's specific protection in the First Amendment's fifth clause. It is still definitional: SLAPPs refer to civil lawsuits filed against those who have communicated to government officialdom (in its entire constitutional apparatus). The Right to Petition, granted by Edgar the Peaceful, King of England in the 10th century, antedates the Magna Carta in terms of its significance in the development of democratic institutions. As currently conceived, the right claims that democracy cannot properly function in the presence of barriers between the governed and the governing.\n\nNew York Supreme Court Judge J. Nicholas Colabella, in reference to SLAPPs: \"Short of a gun to the head, a greater threat to First Amendment expression can scarcely be imagined.\" \"Gordon v. Morrone\", 590 N.Y.S.2d 649, 656 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1992). A number of jurisdictions have made such suits illegal, provided that the appropriate standards of journalistic responsibility have been met by the critic.\n\nIn the Australian Capital Territory, the Protection of Public Participation Act 2008 protects conduct intended to influence public opinion or promote or further action in relation to an issue of public interest. A party starting or maintaining a proceeding against a defendant for an improper purpose may be ordered to pay a financial penalty to the Territory.\n\nSome political libel and forum shopping incidents, both common in Canada, have been called SLAPPs, because such suits load defendants with costs of responding in unfamiliar jurisdictions or at times (typically elections) when they are extremely busy and short of funds. Both types of suits are unusual to Canada, so there is little academic concern nor examination of whether political subject matter or remote forums are a clear indicator of SLAPP.\n\nOne of the first cases in Canada to be explicitly ruled a SLAPP was \"Fraser v. Saanich\" (see [1999] B.C.J. No. 3100 (B.C. S.C.)) (QL), where the British Columbia Supreme Court struck out the claim of a hospital director against the District of Saanich, holding that it was a meritless action designed to silence or intimidate the residents who were opposed to the plaintiff's plan to redevelop the hospital facilities.\n\nFollowing the decision in \"Fraser v. Saanich\", the \"Protection of Public Participation Act\" went into effect in British Columbia in April 2001. The legislation was repealed in August 2001. There was extensive debate on its merits and the necessity of having hard criteria for judges and whether this tended to reduce or increase process abuse. The debate was largely formed by the first case to discuss and apply the Protection of Public Participation Act (PPPA), \"Home Equity Development v. Crow\". The defendants' application to dismiss the action against them was dismissed. The defendants failed to meet the burden of proof required by the PPPA, that the plaintiffs had no reasonable prospect of success. While it was not the subject of the case, some felt that the plaintiffs did not bring their action for an improper purpose, and the suit did not inhibit the defendants in their public criticism of the particular project, and that the Act was therefore ineffective in this case.\n\nSince the repeal, BC activists especially the BCCLA have argued repeatedly for a broad understanding of SLAPP and a broad interpretation of judicial powers especially in intervener applications in BC and other common law jurisdictions and when arguing for new legislation to prevent SLAPPs. The activist literature contains extensive research on particular cases and criteria. The West Coast Environmental Law organization agrees and generally considers BC to lag other jurisdictions.\n\nA private member's bill introduced in 2001 by Graham Steele (NDP, Halifax Fairview) proposed a \"Protection of Public Participation Act\" to dismiss proceedings or claims brought or maintained for an improper purpose, awarding punitive or exemplary damages (effectively, a SLAPP back) and protection from liability for communication or conduct which constitutes public participation. The bill did not progress beyond first reading.\n\nIn Ontario, the decision in \"Daishowa v. Friends of the Lubicon\" (see [1996] O.J. No. 3855 Ont. Ct. Gen. Div.) (QL) was also instructive on SLAPPs. A motion brought by the corporate plaintiff Daishowa to impose conditions on the defendant Friends of the Lubicon Indian Band that they would not represent Daishowa's action as a SLAPP was dismissed.\n\nBy 2010, the Ontario Attorney-General issued a major report which identified SLAPP as a major problem but initially little or nothing was done.\n\nIn June 2013, the Attorney General introduced legislation to implement the recommendations of the report; that bill was re-introduced after the 2014 election. , Bill 83, the Protection of Public Participation Act (2014), has been referred to the Standing Committee on Social Policy and is not yet law. The bill proposes a mechanism for an order to dismiss strategic lawsuits which attack free expression on matters of public interest, with full costs (but not punitive damages) and on a relatively short timeframe, if the underlying claims have no reasonable prospect of success. In October 2015, Ontario passed the Protection of Public Participation Act, 2015.\n\nThe bill is supported by a wide range of groups including municipalities, the Canadian Environmental Law Association, EcoJustice, Environmental Defence, Ontario Clean Air Alliance, Ontario Nature, Canadian Civil Liberties Association, Canadian Journalists for Free Expression, Citizens Environment Alliance of Southwestern Ontario, The Council of Canadians, CPAWS Wildlands League, Sierra Club Ontario, Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario and Greenpeace Canada. The Ontario Civil Liberties Association has called upon the Attorney General to go further, as Bill 83 does not correct fundamental flaws with Ontario's defamation law which impose a one-sided burden of proof to force defendants to disprove falsity, malice, and damage within a very limited framework where \"truth\", \"privilege\", \"fair comment\", and \"responsible reporting\" are their only recognised defences.\n\nQuébec's then Justice Minister, Jacques Dupuis, proposed an anti-SLAPP bill on June 13, 2008.\nThe bill was adopted by the National Assembly of Quebec on June 3, 2009. As of September 2013, Quebec's amended Code of Civil Procedure is the only anti-SLAPP mechanism in force in Canada.\n\nThis bill was invoked in Ontario (and then Supreme Court of Canada docket 33819) in the case of Les Éditions Écosociété Inc., Alain Deneault, Delphine Abadie and William Sacher vs. Banro Inc., in which the publisher Écosociété pleaded (supported by the BCCLA) that it should not face Ontario liability for a publication in Quebec, as the suit was a SLAPP and the Quebec law explicitly provided to dismiss these. The court denied the request, ruling that the Ontario court did have jurisdiction. A separate 2011 decision in Quebec Superior Court had ruled that Barrick Gold had to pay $143,000 to the book's three authors and publisher, Les Éditions Écosociété Inc., to prepare their defence in a \"seemingly abusive\" strategic lawsuit against public participation. Despite the Québec ruling, a book \"Noir Canada\" documenting the relationship between Canadian mining corporations, armed conflict and political actors in Africa was never published as part of a settlement which, according to the authors, was only made for the sole purpose of resolving the three-and-a-half-year legal battle.\n\nThe Quebec law is substantially different in structure than that of California or other jurisdictions, however as Quebec's Constitution generally subordinates itself to international law, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights applies. That treaty only permits liability for arbitrary and unlawful speech. The ICCPR has also been cited, in the BC case Crookes v. Newton, as the standard for balancing free speech versus reputation rights. The Supreme Court of Canada in October 2011, ruling in that case, neither reiterated nor rescinded that standard.\n\nTwenty-eight states, the District of Columbia, and Guam have enacted statutory protections against SLAPPs.\nThese states are Arizona, Arkansas, California, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, and Vermont. In Colorado and West Virginia, the courts have adopted protections against SLAPPs. These laws vary dramatically in scope and level of protection, and the remaining states lack specific protections.\n\nThere is no federal anti-SLAPP law, but legislation for one has been previously introduced such as the SPEAK FREE Act of 2015. The extent to which state laws apply in federal courts is unclear, and the circuits are split on the question. The First, Fifth and Ninth circuits have allowed litigants from Maine, Louisiana and California, respectively, to use their state's special motion in federal district courts in diversity actions. The D.C. Circuit has held the reverse for D.C. litigants.\n\nIt has been argued that the lack of uniform protection against SLAPPs has encouraged forum shopping; proponents of federal legislation have argued that the uncertainty about one's level of protection has likely magnified the chilling effect of SLAPPs.\n\nIn December 2009, Rep. Steve Cohen (D–Tennessee) introduced the Citizen Participation Act in the U.S. House. This marks the first time the Congress has considered federal anti-SLAPP legislation, though the Congress enacted the SPEECH Act on the closely related issue of \"libel tourism\". Like many state anti-SLAPP laws, H.R. 4364 would allow the defendant of a SLAPP to have the suit quickly dismissed and to recover fees and costs.\n\nCalifornia has a unique variant of anti-SLAPP legislation. In 1992 California enacted Code of Civil Procedure § 425.16, a statute intended to frustrate SLAPPs by providing a quick and inexpensive defense. It provides for a special motion that a defendant can file at the outset of a lawsuit to strike a complaint when it arises from conduct that falls within the rights of petition or free speech. The statute expressly applies to any writing or speech made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative, executive, or judicial proceeding, or any other official proceeding authorized by law, but there is no requirement that the writing or speech be promulgated directly to the official body. It also applies to speech in a public forum about an issue of public interest and to any other petition or speech conduct about an issue of public interest.\n\nTo win on an anti-SLAPP (special motion to strike) motion, the defendant in the alleged SLAPP action must first show that the lawsuit is based on claims related to constitutionally protected activities, typically First Amendment rights such as free speech, and typically seeks to show that the claim lacks any basis of genuine substance, legal underpinnings, evidence, or prospect of success. If this is demonstrated then the burden shifts to the plaintiff to affirmatively present evidence demonstrating a reasonable probability of succeeding in their case by showing an actual wrong would exist as recognized by law, if the facts claimed were borne out.\n\nThe filing of an anti-SLAPP motion stays all discovery. This feature acts to greatly reduce the cost of litigation to the anti-SLAPP defendant, and can make beating the motion extremely difficult for the plaintiff, because they effectively must prove their case has at least a basis of visible legal merit and is not merely vexatious, prior to discovery.\n\nIf the special motion is denied, the order denying the motion is immediately appealable. Defendants prevailing on an anti-SLAPP motion (including any subsequent appeal) are entitled to a mandatory award of reasonable attorney's fees. After an anti-SLAPP motion has been filed, a plaintiff cannot escape this mandatory fee award by amending its complaint. More than 300 published court opinions have interpreted and applied California's anti-SLAPP law.\n\nCalifornia's Code of Civil Procedure § 425.17 corrects what the Legislature found to be abuse of the anti-SLAPP statute.\nSigned into law on September 6, 2003, this statute prohibits anti-SLAPP motions in response to certain public interest lawsuits and class actions, and actions that arise from commercial statements or conduct. Section 425.18, signed into law on October 6, 2005, was enacted to facilitate SLAPP victims in recovering their damages through a SLAPPback (malicious prosecution action) against the SLAPP filers and their attorneys after the underlying SLAPP has been dismissed.\n\nIn May 2015, the Washington Supreme Court struck down the state’s 2010 anti-SLAPP statute.\n\nThe SLAPP penalty stands as a barrier to access to the courts by providing an early penalty to claimants who seek judicial redress. In recent years, the courts in some states have recognized that enforcement of SLAPP legislation must recognize and balance the constitutional rights of both litigants. It has been said:\nSince Magna Carta, the world has recognized the importance of justice in a free society. \"To no one will we sell, to no one will we refuse or delay, right or justice.\" (Magna Carta, 1215.) This nation's founding fathers knew people would never consent to be governed and surrender their right to decide disputes by force, unless government offered a just forum for resolving those disputes.\nThe right to bring grievances to the courts, in good faith, is protected by state and federal constitutions in a variety of ways. In most states, the right to trial by jury in civil cases is recognized. The right to cross-examine witnesses is considered fundamental to the American judicial system. Moreover, the first amendment protects the right to petition the government for a redress of grievances. The \"right to petition extends to all departments of the Government. The right of access to the courts is indeed but one aspect of the right of petition.\"\nBecause \"the right to petition is 'among the most precious of the liberties safeguarded by the Bill of Rights,' ... the right of access to the courts shares this 'preferred place' in [the United States'] hierarchy of constitutional freedoms and values.\"\nThis balancing question is resolved differently in different states, often with substantial difficulty.\n\nIn \"Palazzo v. Alves\", the Supreme Court of Rhode Island stated:\nBy the nature of their subject matter, anti-SLAPP statutes require meticulous drafting. On the one hand, it is desirable to seek to shield citizens from improper intimidation when exercising their constitutional right to be heard with respect to issues of public concern. On the other hand, it is important that such statutes be limited in scope lest the constitutional right of access to the courts (whether by private figures, public figures, or public officials) be improperly thwarted. There is a genuine double-edged challenge to those who legislate in this area.\n\nThe most challenging balancing problem arises in application to SLAPP claims which do not sound (give rise to a claim) in tort. The common law and constitutional law have developed in the United States to create a high substantive burden to tort and tort-like claims which seek redress for public speech, especially public speech which addresses matters of public concern. The common law in many states requires the pleader to state accurately the content of libelous words. Constitutional law has provided substantive protection which bars recovery against a first amendment defense except upon clear and convincing evidence that there has been deliberate or reckless falsehood. For this reason, ferreting out the bad faith SLAPP claim at an early stage of litigation should be accomplished with relative ease. Extension of the SLAPP penalties to factually complex cases, where the substantive standard of proof at common law is lower presents special challenges.\n\nA Minnesota Supreme Court case, \"Middle-Snake-Tamarac Rivers Watershed Dist. v. Stengrim\", 784 N.W.2d 834 (Minn. 2010) establishes a two-step process to determine whether SLAPP procedure should be applied. The decision arises in the context of an effort to enforce a settlement agreement between a local government and an opponent of a flood control project. The landowner had accepted a significant monetary settlement in settlement of his opposition to land acquisition. The landowner agreed as part of the settlement to address no further challenges to the project. When the local government sued the landowner for breach of settlement, the landowner contended that enforcement of the settlement was a strategic lawsuit against public participation. The Supreme Court rejected that claim and affirmed the District Court's denial of SLAPP relief, holding \"The District Court properly denied a motion to dismiss where the underlying claim involved an alleged breach of a settlement agreement that potentially limited the moving party's rights to public participation.\" The Supreme Court explained:\n\nPreexisting legal relationships, such as those based on a settlement agreement where a party waives certain rights, may legitimately limit a party’s public participation. It would be illogical to read sections 554.01-.05 as providing presumptive immunity to actions that a moving party may have contractually agreed to forgo or limit.\n\nUnder the Minnesota approach, as a preliminary matter, the moving party must meet the burden of showing that the circumstances which bring the case within the purview of SLAPP protection exists. Until that has been accomplished, no clear and convincing burden has been shifted to the responding party.\n\n\n\n\nIn 2016, the real-estate investment company Pro Kapital Ltd sued urbanist Teele Pehk who expressed her opinion about the company's development plans in Kalasadam area in Tallinn, Estonia. The accusations were based on an interview given for the article \"The battle for the Estonian coastline\", published by the monthly newspaper \"The Baltic Times\". Initially, instead of clarifying the questionable quotes in the article with the \"Baltic Times\" editors, Pro Kapital sent a legal demand to Pehk demanding that she publish a pre-written explanation and pay €500 to cover their legal advice expenses. Pehk provided proof to the lawyer that she had not lied to the journalist of \"The Baltic Times\", and the newspaper published a clarification online that Pehk's words were misinterpreted. Few months later Pro Kapital sued Pehk for damaging their reputation by spreading lies about the detailed plan of the Kalasadam area. Teele Pehk had been involved with the detailed plan of Kalasadam since 2011, as a member of the neighbourhood association Telliskivi selts and caretaker of the Kalarand beach, situated on the edge of Kalasadam area.\n\nHalf a year into the court case, Pro Kapital began negotiations and settled with a compromise before the court hearing. Pro Kapital paid for Pehk's legal costs and both parties agreed not to disparage each other in the future. Teele Pehk is still active in Tallinn urban development and continues to spread the word about SLAPP.\n\nThis first SLAPP case in Estonia took place at the end of the 12-year process of planning the Kalasadam area, which over the years had witnessed exceptionally high public interest regarding the planned residential development and most importantly, the public use of the seaside and the beach. The planning system in Estonia allows anyone to express their opinion, present suggestions or objections to any detailed plan. Many Estonian civic organisations were raising concerned voices about the case and the Chancellor for Justice of Estonia condemned that practice many times in public appearances.\n\n\nDuring 2016, Amir Bramly, who at the time was being investigated and subsequently indicted for an alleged ponzi scheme sued for libel Tomer Ganon, a Calcalist reporter, privately for 1 million NIS in damages, due to a news item linking him to Bar Refaeli. In addition Bramly sued Channel-2 News and its reporters and managers for 5 million NIS in damages due to an alleged libel in an in-depth TV news item and interview with the court appointed liquidator of his companies, and has threatened to sue additional bodies. The sued individuals and bodies have claimed that these are SLAPP actions.\n\nIn 2006, Oricon Inc., Japan's music chart provider, sued freelance journalist Hiro Ugaya due to his suggesting in an article for business and culture magazine \"Cyzo\" that the company was fiddling its statistics to benefit certain management companies and labels, specifically Johnny and Associates. The company sought 50 million yen and apology from him. He found allies in the magazine's editor-in-chief Tadashi Ibi, lawyer Kentaro Shirosaki, and Reporters Sans Frontières (RSF).\n\nHe was found guilty in 2008 by the Tokyo District Court and ordered to pay one million yen, but he appealed and won. Oricon did not appeal later. His 33-month struggle against Oricon and his research on SLAPPs through his self-expense trip in the United States was featured on the TBS program \"JNN\" \"Reportage\", titled as \"Legal Intimidation Against Free Speech: What is SLAPP?\"\n\nRSF expressed its support to the journalist and was relieved on the abandonment of the suit.\n\nIn 2018, Lovdata, a foundation which publishes judicial information, sued two people amongst the volunteers in the rettspraksis.no project. Up until 2008, Lovdata was considered a government agency and had unlimited access to the supreme court servers. Based on this access, Lovdata has established a de facto monopoly on Norwegian supreme court rulings. When rettspraksis.no published supreme court decisions, Lovdata sued Håkon Wium Lie and Fredrik Ljone, two of the volunteers. Although court decisions are not protected by copyright in Norway, Lovdata claimed that rettspraksis.no had used advanced crawlers to copy Lovdata's database. In less than 24 hours, Lovdata was able to close the rettspraksis.no site and the judge also ordered the volunteers to pay Lovdata's legal fees.

Born into a family with strong ties with Mughal court, Syed studied the Quran and sciences within the court. He was awarded honorary LLD from the University of Edinburgh.\n\nIn 1838, Syed Ahmad entered the service of East India Company and went on to become a judge at a Small Causes Court in 1867, and retired from service in 1876. During the Indian Rebellion of 1857, he remained, loyal to the British Empire and was noted for his actions in saving European lives. After the rebellion, he penned the booklet \"The Causes of the Indian Mutiny\" – a daring critique, at the time, of British policies that he blamed for causing the revolt. Believing that the future of Muslims was threatened by the rigidity of their orthodox outlook, Sir Syed began promoting Western–style scientific education by founding modern schools and journals and organising Muslim entrepreneurs.\n\nIn 1859, Syed established Gulshan School at Muradabad, Victoria School at Ghazipur in 1863, and a scientific society for Muslims in 1864. In 1875, founded the Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College, the first Muslim university in South Asia. During his career, Syed repeatedly called upon Muslims to loyally serve the British Empire and promoted the adoption of Urdu as the \"lingua franca\" of all Indian Muslims. Syed heavily critiqued the Indian National Congress.\n\nSyed maintains a strong legacy in Pakistan and Indian Muslims. He strongly influenced other Muslim leaders including Allama Iqbal and Jinnah. His advocacy of Islam's rationalist (Muʿtazila) tradition, and at broader, radical reinterpretation of the Quran to make it compatible with science and modernity, continues to influence the global Islamic reformation. Many universities and public buildings in Pakistan bear Sir Syed's name.\n\nAligarh Muslim University celebrated his 200th birth centenary with much enthusiasm on 17 October 2017. Former President of India shri Pranab Mukherjee was the chief guest.\n\nSyed Ahmed Taqvi 'Khan Bahadur' was born on 17 October 1817 to a Syed family in Delhi, which was the capital of the Mughal Empire. His family were descendant of Muhammad and then moved to the Indian subcontinent in the ruling times of Mughal emperor Akbar–I. Many generations of his family had since been highly connected with the administrative position in Mughal Empire. His maternal grandfather Khwaja Fariduddin served as \"Wazir\" (lit. Minister) in the court of Emperor Akbar–II. His paternal grandfather Syed Hadi Jawwad bin Imaduddin held a \"mansab\" (lit. General)– a high-ranking administrative position and honorary name of \"Mir Jawwad Ali Khan\" in the court of Emperor Alamgir II. Sir Syed's father, Syed Muttaqi Muhammad bin Hadi Khan, was personally close to Emperor Akbar–II and served as his personal adviser.\n\nHowever, Syed Ahmad was born at a time when his father was regional insurrections aided and led by the East India Company, and the British Empire had diminished the extent and power of the Mughal state, reducing its monarch to figurehead. With his elder brother Syed Muhammad bin Muttaqi Khan, Sir Syed was raised in a large house in a wealthy area of the city. They were raised in strict accordance with Mughal noble traditions and exposed to politics. Their mother Aziz-un-Nisa played a formative role in Sir Syed's early life, raising him with rigid discipline with a strong emphasis on modern education. Sir Syed was taught to read and understand the Qur'an by a female tutor, which was unusual at the time. He received an education traditional to Muslim nobility in Delhi. Under the charge of Lord Wellesley\n, Sir Syed was trained in Persian, Arabic, Urdu and orthodox religious subjects. He read the works of Muslim scholars and writers such as Sahbai, Rumi and Ghalib. Other tutors instructed him in mathematics, astronomy and Islamic jurisprudence. Sir Syed was also adept at swimming, wrestling and other sports. He took an active part in the Mughal court's cultural activities.\n\nSyed Ahmad's elder brother founded the city's first printing press in the Urdu language along with the journal \"Sayyad-ul-Akbar\". Sir Syed pursued the study of medicine for several years but did not complete the course. Until the death of his father in 1838, Sir Syed had lived a life customary for an affluent young Muslim noble. Upon his father's death, he inherited the titles of his grandfather and father and was awarded the title of \"Arif Jung\" by the emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar. Financial difficulties put an end to Sir Syed's formal education, although he continued to study in private, using books on a variety of subjects. Sir Syed assumed editorship of his brother's journal and rejected offers of employment from the Mughal court.\n\nHaving recognized the steady decline in Mughal political power, Sir Syed decided to enter the service of the East India Company. He could not enter the English civil service because it was only in the 1860s that natives were admitted. He did not attend the East India Company College which did not grant degrees. His first appointment was as a \"Serestadar\" (lit. Clerk) at the courts of law in Agra, responsible for record-keeping and managing court affairs. In 1840, he was promoted to the title of \"munshi\". In 1858, he was appointed to a high-ranking post at the court in Muradabad, where he began working on his most famous literary work.\n\nAcquainted with high-ranking British officials, Sir Syed obtained close knowledge about British colonial politics during his service at the courts. At the outbreak of the Indian rebellion, on 10 May 1857, Sir Syed was serving as the chief assessment officer at the court in Bijnor. Northern India became the scene of the most intense fighting. The conflict had left large numbers of civilians dead. Erstwhile centres of Muslim power such as Delhi, Agra, Lucknow and Kanpur were severely affected. Sir Syed was personally affected by the violence and the ending of the Mughal dynasty amongst many other long-standing kingdoms. Sir Syed and many other Muslims took this as a defeat of Muslim society. He lost several close relatives who died in the violence. Although he succeeded in rescuing his mother from the turmoil, she died in Meerut, owing to the privations she had experienced.\n\nSocial reforms in the Muslim society were initiated by Abdul Latif who founded \"The Mohammedan Literary Society\" in Bengal. Sir Syed Ahmed Khan established the MAO College which eventually became the Aligarh Muslim University. He opposed ignorance, superstitions and evil customs prevalent in Indian Muslim society. He firmly believed that Muslim society would not progress without the acquisition of western education and science. As time passed, Sir Syed began stressing on the idea of pragmatic modernism and started advocating for strong interfaith relations between Islam and Christianity.\n\nSir Syed supported the British during the 1857 uprising, a role which has been criticised by some nationalists such as Jamaluddin Afghani. In 1859 Sir Syed published the booklet \"Asbab-e-Baghawat-e-Hind\" (The Causes of the Indian Revolt) in which he studied the causes of the Indian revolt. In this, his most famous work, he rejected the common notion that the conspiracy was planned by Muslim élites, who resented the diminishing influence of Muslim monarchs. He blamed the British East India Company for its aggressive expansion as well as the ignorance of British politicians regarding Indian culture. Sir Syed advised the British to appoint Muslims to assist in administration, to prevent what he called ‘haramzadgi’ (a vulgar deed) such as the mutiny.\n\nMaulana Altaf Hussain Hali wrote in the biography of Sir Syed that: \"As soon as Sir Syed reached Muradabad, he began to write the pamphlet entitled 'The Causes of the Indian Revolt' (Asbab-e-Baghawat-e-Hind), in which he did his best to clear the people of India, and especially the Muslims, of the charge of Mutiny. In spite of the obvious danger, he made a courageous and thorough report of the accusations people were making against the Government and refused the theory which the British had invented to explain the causes of the Mutiny.\"\n\nWhen the work was finished, without waiting for an English translation, Sir Syed sent the Urdu version to be printed at the Mufassilat Gazette Press in Agra. Within a few weeks, he received 500 copies back from the printers. His friend warned him not to send the pamphlet to Parliament or to the Government of India. Rae Shankar Das, a great friend of Sir Syed, begged him to burn the books rather than put his life in danger. Sir Syed replied that he was bringing these matters to the attention of the British for the good of his own people, of his country, and of the government itself. He said that if he came to any harm while doing something that would greatly benefit the rulers and the subjects of India alike, he would gladly suffer whatever befell him. When Rae Shankar Das saw that Sir Syed's mind was made up and nothing could be done to change it, he wept and remained silent. After performing a supplementary prayer and asking God's blessing, Sir Syed sent almost all the 500 copies of his pamphlet to England, one to the government, and kept the rest himself.\n\nWhen the government of India had the book translated and presented before the Council, Lord Canning, the governor-general, and Sir Bartle Frere accepted it as a sincere and friendly report. The foreign secretary Cecil Beadon, however, severely attacked it, calling it 'an extremely seditious pamphlet'. He wanted a proper inquiry into the matter and said that the author, unless he could give a satisfactory explanation, should be harshly dealt with. Since no other member of the Council agreed with his opinion, his attack did no harm.\n\nLater, Sir Syed was invited to attend Lord Canning's durbar in Farrukhabad and happened to meet the foreign secretary there. He told Sir Syed that he was displeased with the pamphlet and added that if he had really had the government's interests at heart, he would not have made his opinion known in this way throughout the country; he would have communicated it directly to the government. Sir Syed replied that he had only had 500 copies printed, the majority of which he had sent to England, one had been given to the government of India, and the remaining copies were still in his possession. Furthermore, he had the receipt to prove it. He was aware, he added, that the view of the rulers had been distorted by the stress and anxieties of the times, which made it difficult to put even the most straightforward problem in its right perspective. It was for this reason that he had not communicated his thoughts publicly. He promised that for every copy that could be found circulating in India he would personally pay 1,000 rupees. At first, Beadon was not convinced and asked Sir Syed over and over again if he was sure that no other copy had been distributed in India. Sir Syed reassured him on this matter, and Beadon never mentioned it again. Later he became one of Sir Syed's strongest supporters.\n\nMany official translations were made of the Urdu text of \"The Causes of the Indian Revolt\". The one undertaken by the India Office formed the subject of many discussions and debates. The pamphlet was also translated by the government of India and several members of parliament, but no version was offered to the public. A translation which had been started by a government official was finished by Sir Syed's great friend, Colonel G.F.I. Graham, and finally published in 1873.\n\nIn 1855, <nowiki>he finished</nowiki> his scholarly, well researched and illustrated edition of Abul Fazl's \"Ai'n-e Akbari\", itself an extraordinarily difficult book. Having finished the work to his satisfaction, and believing that Mirza Asadullah Khan Ghalib was a person who would appreciate his labours, Syed Ahmad approached the great Ghalib to write a \"taqriz\" (in the convention of the times, a laudatory foreword) for it. Ghalib obliged, but what he did produce was a short Persian poem castigating the Ai'n-e Akbari, and by implication, the imperial, sumptuous, literate and learned Mughal culture of which it was a product. The least that could be said against it was that the book had little value even as an antique document. Ghalib practically reprimanded Syed Ahmad Khan for wasting his talents and time on dead things. Worse, he praised sky-high the \"sahibs of England\" who at that time held all the keys to all the a’ins in this world.\n\nThe poem was unexpected, but it came at the time when Syed Ahmad Khan's thought and feelings themselves were inclining toward change. Ghalib seemed to be acutely aware of a European[English]-sponsored change in world polity, especially Indian polity. Syed Ahmad might well have been piqued at Ghalib's admonitions, but he would also have realized that Ghalib's reading of the situation, though not nuanced enough, was basically accurate. Syed Ahmad Khan may also have felt that he, being better informed about the English and the outside world, should have himself seen the change that now seemed to be just round the corner.\n\nSir Syed Ahmad Khan never again wrote a word in praise of the \"Ai'n-e Akbari\" and in fact gave up taking an active interest in history and archaeology. He did edit another two historical texts over the next few years, but neither of them was anything like the \"Ai'n\": a vast and triumphalist document on the governance of Akbar.\n\nWhile continuing to work as a junior clerk, Sir Syed began focusing on writing, from the age of 23 (in 1840), on various subjects (from mechanics to educational issues), mainly in Urdu, where he wrote, at least, 6000 pages. His career as an author began when he published a series of treatises in Urdu on religious subjects in 1842. He published the book \"Asaar-us-sanadeed\" (\"Great Monuments\") documenting antiquities of Delhi dating from the medieval era. This work earned him the reputation of a cultured scholar. In 1842, he completed the \"Jila-ul-Qulub bi Zikr-il Mahbub\" and the \"Tuhfa-i-Hasan\", along with the \"Tahsil fi jar-i-Saqil\" in 1844. These works focused on religious and cultural subjects. In 1852, he published the two works \"Namiqa dar bayan masala tasawwur-i-Shaikh\" and \"Silsilat ul-Mulk\". He released the second edition of \"Ansar-as-sanadid\" in 1854. He also started work on a commentary on the Bible – the first by a Muslim – in which he argued that Islam was the closest religion to Christianity, with a common lineage from Abrahamic religions. He began with Genesis and Matthew, the first books of the Old and New Testament, but quit his project before even completing those first two. His other writings such as \"Loyal Muhammadans of India\", \"Tabyin-ul-Kalam\" and \"A Series of Essays on the Life of Muhammad and Subjects Subsidiary Therein\" helped to create cordial relations between the British authorities and the Muslim community.\n\nHe was appointed the fellow of the Calcutta University and Allahabad University by the Viceroy in the year 1876 and 1887 respectively.\n\nUykjhuhfPar, Agra. 1889.\n\nThrough the 1850s, Syed Ahmed Khan began developing a strong passion for education. While pursuing studies of different subjects including European jurisprudence, Sir Syed began to realise the advantages of Western-style education, which was being offered at newly established colleges across India. Despite being a devout Muslim, Sir Syed criticised the influence of traditional dogma and religious orthodoxy, which had made most Indian Muslims suspicious of British influences. Sir Syed began feeling increasingly concerned for the future of Muslim communities. A scion of Mughal nobility, Sir Syed had been reared in the finest traditions of Muslim élite culture and was aware of the steady decline of Muslim political power across India. The animosity between the British and Muslims before and after the rebellion (Independence War) of 1857 threatened to marginalise Muslim communities across India for many generations. Sir Syed intensified his work to promote co-operation with British authorities, promoting loyalty to the Empire amongst Indian Muslims. Committed to working for the upliftment of Muslims, Sir Syed founded a modern madrassa in Muradabad in 1859; this was one of the first religious schools to impart scientific education. Sir Syed also worked on social causes, helping to organise relief for the famine-struck people of North-West Province in 1860. He established another modern school in Ghazipur in 1863.\n\nUpon his transfer to Aligarh in 1864, Sir Syed began working wholeheartedly as an educator. He founded the Scientific Society of Aligarh, the first scientific association of its kind in India. Modelling it after the Royal Society and the Royal Asiatic Society, Sir Syed assembled Muslim scholars from different parts of the country. The Society held annual conferences, disbursed funds for educational causes and regularly published a journal on scientific subjects in English and Urdu. Sir Syed felt that the socio-economic future of Muslims was threatened by their orthodox aversions to modern science and technology. He published many writings promoting liberal, rational interpretations of Islamic scriptures. \nOne example was the reaction to his argument – which appeared in his \"tafsir\" (exegesis) of the Quran – that \"riba\" referred to interest charges when lending money to the poor, but not to the rich, nor to borrowers \"in trade or in industry\", since this finance supported \"trade, national welfare and prosperity\". While many jurists declared all interest to be riba, (according to Sir Syed) this was based \"on their own authority and deduction\" rather than the Quran.\n\nMany other orthodox Sunni schools condemned him as out of the fold of Islam i.e. \"kafir\". Many of his own friends, like Nawab Muhsin ul Mulk, expressed their significant reservations at his religious ideas (many of which were expounded in his commentary of Qur'an). According to J.M.S. Baljon his ideas created \"a real hurricane of protests and outbursts of wrath\" among by local clerics \"in every town and village\" in Muslim India, who issued fatawa \"declaring him to be a \"kafir\"\" (unbeliever). He was also accused of having converted to Christianity.\n\nMaulana Qasim Nanautawi, the founder of Darul 'Uloom Deoband, expressed in a letter to an anacquaintance of his and Sir Syed's:\n\n\"No doubt, I greatly admire, as per what I've heard, Syed (Ahmad) Sahab's courage (\"Ūlul Azmi\") and concern for the Muslims (\"Dardmandi e Ahl e Islam\"). For this if I shall express my affection for him, it will be rightful. However, similar to this (or rather more than this), upon hearing about his disturbed (Fāsid) beliefs, I have deep complains and sorrow for him\" \n\nMaulana Qasim Nanautawi wrote directly to Sir Syed as well, explaining him some of his \"noteworthy\" mistakes. This correspondence was published as \"Tasfiyat ul Aqaaid\" in 1887 C.E \n\nThe onset of the Hindi-Urdu controversy of 1867 saw the emergence of Sir Syed as a champion for cause of the Urdu language. He became a leading Muslim voice opposing the adoption of Hindi as a second official language of the United Provinces (now Uttar Pradesh). Sir Syed perceived Urdu as the \"lingua franca\" of the United Provinces. Having been developed by during the Mughal period, Urdu was used as a secondary language to Persian, the official language of the Mughal court. Since the decline of the Mughal dynasty, Sir Syed promoted the use of Urdu through his own writings. Under Sir Syed, the Scientific Society translated Western works only into Urdu. The schools established by Sir Syed imparted education in the Urdu medium. The demand for Hindi, led largely by Hindus, was to Sir Syed an erosion of the centuries-old Muslim cultural domination of India. Testifying before the British-appointed education commission, Sir Syed controversially exclaimed that \"Urdu was the language of gentry and Hindi that of the vulgar.\" His remarks provoked a hostile response from Hindu leaders, who unified across the nation to demand the recognition of Hindi.\n\nThe success of the Hindi movement led Sir Syed to further advocate Urdu as the symbol of Muslim heritage and as the language of all Indian Muslims. His educational and political work grew increasingly centred around and exclusively for Muslim interests. He also sought to persuade the British to give Urdu extensive official use and patronage. His colleagues such as Mohsin-ul-Mulk and Maulvi Abdul Haq developed organisations such as the Urdu Defence Association and the Anjuman Taraqqi-i-Urdu, committed to the perpetuation of Urdu. All these colleagues led efforts that resulted in the adoption of Urdu as the official language of the Hyderabad State and as the medium of instruction in the Osmania University. To Muslims in northern and western India, Urdu had become an integral part of political and cultural identity. However, the division over the use of Hindi or Urdu further provoked communal conflict between Muslims and Hindus in India.\n\nOn 1 April 1869 he went, along with his son Syed Mahmood, to England, where he was awarded the Order of the Star of India from the British government on 6 August. Travelling across England, he visited its colleges and was inspired by the culture of learning established after the Renaissance. Sir Syed returned to India in the following year determined to build a \"Muslim Cambridge.\" Upon his return, he organised the \"Committee for the Better Diffusion and Advancement of Learning among Muhammadans\" (Muslims) on 26 December 1870. Sir Syed described his vision of the institution he proposed to establish in an article written sometime in 1872 and re-printed in the Aligarh Institute Gazette of 5 April 1911:\n\nI may appear to be dreaming and talking like Shaikh Chilli, but we aim to turn this MAO College into a University similar to that of Oxford or Cambridge. Like the churches of Oxford and Cambridge, there will be mosques attached to each College... The College will have a dispensary with a Doctor and a compounder, besides a \"Unani Hakim\". It will be mandatory on boys in residence to join the congregational prayers (namaz) at all the five times. Students of other religions will be exempted from this religious observance. Muslim students will have a uniform consisting of a black alpaca, half-sleeved \"chugha\" and a red \"Fez\" cap... Bad and abusive words which boys generally pick up and get used to, will be strictly prohibited. Even such a word as a \"liar\" will be treated as an abuse to be prohibited. They will have food either on tables of European style or on chaukis in the manner of the Arabs... Smoking of cigarette or \"huqqa\" and the chewing of betels shall be strictly prohibited. No corporal punishment or any such punishment as is likely to injure a student's self-respect will be permissible... It will be strictly enforced that Shia and Sunni boys shall not discuss their religious differences in the College or in the boarding house. At present it is like a day dream. I pray to God that this dream may come true.\"\n\nBy 1873, the committee under Sir Syed issued proposals for the construction of a college in Aligarh. He began publishing the journal \"Tahzib-al-Akhlaq\" (\"Social Reformer\") on 24 December 1870 to spread awareness and knowledge on modern subjects and promote reforms in Muslim society. Sir Syed worked to promote reinterpretation of Muslim ideology in order to reconcile tradition with Western education. He argued in several books on Islam that the Qur'an rested on an appreciation of reason and natural law, making scientific inquiry important to being a good Muslim. Sir Syed established a modern school in Aligarh and, obtaining support from wealthy Muslims and the British, laid the foundation stone of the Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College on 24 May 1875. He retired from his career as a jurist the following year, concentrating entirely on developing the college and on religious reform. Sir Syed's pioneering work received support from the British. Although intensely criticised by orthodox religious leaders hostile to modern influences, Sir Syed's new institution attracted a large student body, mainly drawn from the Muslim gentry and middle classes. The curriculum at the college involved scientific and Western subjects, as well as Oriental subjects and religious education. The first chancellor was Sultan Shah Jahan Begum, a prominent Muslim noblewoman, and Sir Syed invited an Englishman, Theodore Beck, to serve as the first college principal. The college was originally affiliated with Calcutta University but was transferred to the Allahabad University in 1885. Near the turn of the 20th century, it began publishing its own magazine and established a law school. In 1920, the college was transformed into a university.\n\nIn 1878, Sir Syed was nominated to the Viceroy's Legislative Council. He testified before the education commission to promote the establishment of more colleges and schools across India. In the same year, Sir Syed founded the Muhammadan Association to promote political co-operation amongst Indian Muslims from different parts of the country. In 1886, he organised the All India Muhammadan Educational Conference in Aligarh, which promoted his vision of modern education and political unity for Muslims. His works made him the most prominent Muslim politician in 19th century India, often influencing the attitude of Muslims on various national issues. He supported the efforts of Indian political leaders Surendranath Banerjee and Dadabhai Naoroji to obtain representation for Indians in the government and civil services. In 1883, he founded the Muhammadan Civil Service Fund Association to encourage and support the entry of Muslim graduates into the Indian Civil Service (ICS). While fearful of the loss of Muslim political power owing to the community's backwardness, Sir Syed was also averse to the prospect of democratic self-government, which would give control of government to the Hindu-majority population:\n\n\"At this time our nation is in a bad state in regards education and wealth, but God has given us the light of religion and the Quran is present for our guidance, which has ordained them and us to be friends. Now God has made them rulers over us. Therefore we should cultivate friendship with them, and should adopt that method by which their rule may remain permanent and firm in India, and may not pass into the hands of the Bengalis... If we join the political movement of the Bengalis our nation will reap a loss, for we do not want to become subjects of the Hindus instead of the subjects of the \"people of the Book...\"\n\nLater in his life he said, \"Suppose that the English community and the army were to leave India, taking with them all their cannons and their splendid weapons and all else, who then would be the rulers of India?... Is it possible that under these circumstances two nations—the Mohammedans and the Hindus—could sit on the same throne and remain equal in power? Most certainly not. It is necessary that one of them should conquer the other. To hope that both could remain equal is to desire the impossible and the inconceivable. But until one nation has conquered the other and made it obedient, peace cannot reign in the land.\"\n\nSir Syed's educational model and progressive thinking inspired Muslim elites who supported the AIML. Ahmad Khan founded the All India Muhammadan Educational Conference in 1886 in order to promote Western education, especially science and literature, among India's Muslims. The conference, in addition to generating funds for Ahmad Khan's Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College, motivated Muslim elites to propose expansion of educational uplift elsewhere, known as the Aligarh Movement. In turn this new awareness of Muslim needs helped stimulate a political consciousness among Muslim elites that went on to form the AIML.\n\nOverall, Syed Ahmed is hailed as a Muslim social reformer who promoted communal harmony and peaceful coexistence of all communities in India. In an undivided India under the British rule, he was worried about Muslim backwardness and unwillingness to adopt modern education. He worked towards social and educational upliftment of Muslims so as to enable them to walk shoulder to shoulder with all other communities in India.\n\nSyed Ahmad is widely commemorated across South Asia as a great Muslim social reformer and visionary. At the same time, Syed Ahmad sought to politically ally Muslims with the British government. An avowed loyalist of the British Empire, he was nominated as a member of the Civil Service Commission in 1887 by Lord Dufferin. In 1888, he established the United Patriotic Association at Aligarh to promote political co-operation with the British and Muslim participation in the British government.\n\nSyed Ahmed was bestowed with the suffix of 'Khan Bahadur' and was subsequently knighted by the British government in 1888 and was awarded Knight Commander of the order of Star of India (KCSI) for his loyalty to the British crown, through his membership of the Imperial Legislative Council and in the following year he received an LL.D. \"honoris causa\" from the Edinburgh University.\n\nSir Syed Ahmed Khan Bahadur lived the last two decades of his life in Aligarh, regarded widely as the mentor of 19th and 20th century Muslim entrepreneurs and illuminati. Battling illnesses and old age, Sir Syed died on 27 March 1898. He was buried besides Sir Syed Masjid inside the campus of the Aligarh university.\n\nThe university he founded remains one of India's most prominent institutions. Prominent alumni of Aligarh include Muslim political leaders Maulana Mohammad Ali Jouhar, Abdur Rab Nishtar, Maulana Shaukat Ali and Maulvi Abdul Haq, who is hailed in Pakistan as \"Baba-e-Urdu\" (\"Father of Urdu\"). The first two Prime Ministers of Pakistan, Liaquat Ali Khan and Khawaja Nazimuddin, as well as Indian President Dr. Zakir Hussain, are amongst Aligarh's most famous graduates. In India, Sir Syed is commemorated as a pioneer who worked for the socio-political upliftment of Indian Muslims.\n\nIndia Post issued commemorative postage stamps in his honor in 1973 and 1998. Later, Pakistan Postal Services also issued a commemorative postage stamp in his honor in 1990 in its 'Pioneers of Freedom' series.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "45300043", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45300043", "title": "Teletransportation paradox", "text": "Teletransportation paradox\n\nThe teletransportation paradox or teletransport paradox (also known in alternative forms as the duplicates paradox) is a thought experiment on the philosophy of identity that challenges common intuitions on the nature of self and consciousness. It first appeared in full published form presumably in Derek Parfit's 1984 book \"Reasons and Persons\", but similar questions have been raised as early as 1775.\n\nThe Polish science-fiction writer Stanisław Lem discovered the same problem independently in the middle of the twentieth century. He put it in writing in his philosophical text \"Dialogi\", 1957.\n\nIn \"Divided Minds and the Nature of Persons\" (1987), Parfit asks the reader to imagine entering a \"teletransporter\", a machine that puts you to sleep, then destroys you, breaking you down into atoms, copying the information and relaying it to Mars at the speed of light. On Mars, another machine re-creates you (from local stores of carbon, hydrogen, and so on), each atom in exactly the same relative position. Parfit poses the question of whether or not the teletransporter is a method of travel—is the person on Mars the \"same person\" as the person who entered the teletransporter on Earth? Certainly, when waking up on Mars, \"you\" would feel like being \"you\", \"you\" would remember entering the teletransporter in order to travel to Mars, \"you\" would even feel the cut on your upper lip from shaving this morning.\n\nThen the teleporter is upgraded. The teletransporter on Earth is modified to not destroy the person who enters it, but instead it can simply make infinite replicas, all of whom would claim to remember entering the teletransporter on Earth in the first place.\n\nUsing thought experiments such as these, Parfit argues that any criteria we attempt to use to determine sameness of person will be lacking, because there is no further fact. What matters, to Parfit, is simply \"Relation R\", psychological connectedness, including memory, personality, and so on.\n\nParfit continues this logic to establish a new context for morality and social control. He cites that it is morally wrong for one person to harm or interfere with another person and it is incumbent on society to protect individuals from such transgressions. That accepted, it is a short extrapolation to conclude that it is also incumbent on society to protect an individual's \"Future Self\" from such transgressions; tobacco use could be classified as an abuse of a Future Self's right to a healthy existence. Parfit resolves the logic to reach this conclusion, which appears to justify incursion into personal freedoms, but he does not explicitly endorse such invasive control.\n\nParfit's conclusion is similar to David Hume's view and also to the view of the self in Buddhism, though it does not restrict itself to a mere reformulation of them. For besides being \"reductive\", Parfit's view is also \"deflationary\": in the end, \"what matters\" is not personal identity, but rather mental continuity and connectedness.\n\n\n"}

W. Greg, was one of the leading bibliographers and Shakespeare scholars of the 20th century.\n\nGreg was born at Wimbledon Common in 1875. His father, William Rathbone Greg, was an essayist; his mother was the daughter of James Wilson. As a child, Greg was expected one day to assume editorship of \"The Economist\", which his grandfather had founded in 1843; Greg was educated at Wixenford, Harrow and at Trinity College of Cambridge University. At Cambridge he met Ronald McKerrow, whose friendship helped shape Greg's decision to pursue a career in literature. While still in school he compiled a list of Renaissance plays printed before 1700, and he joined the Bibliographical Society the same year. He was President of the Society from 1930 to 1932 and received its Gold Medal in 1935.\n\nAfter school, Greg settled into a life of steady productivity, while living on the proceeds of his shares of \"The Economist\". Working in close association with A. H. Bullen, he produced \"Pastoral Poetry and Pastoral Drama\" (1906), the first edited version of the account books of Philip Henslowe (1906–8) and the papers of Edward Alleyn. The latter two works provided him with a knowledge of Renaissance theatrical conditions perhaps rivaled only by E. K. Chambers, and this knowledge he applied to the publications of the Malone Society, which he served as general editor between 1906 and 1939. He served as Librarian of Trinity College, 1907–13, resigning after his marriage to his cousin Elizabeth Gaskell. As an independent scholar, Greg produced editions of \"The Merry Wives of Windsor\" (1910), Robert Greene's \"Orlando Furioso\" and George Peele's \"The Battle of Alcazar\" (published together, 1923), and \"Sir Thomas More\" (1911). He returned to specific editing with work on \"Doctor Faustus\" (1950). Greg also wrote on the material conditions of Renaissance theater and publishing; his work in this regard includes \"Dramatic Documents from the Elizabethan Playhouses\" (1931) and \"English Literary Autographs, 1550–1650\" (1932). \"The Variants in the First Quarto of King Lear\" (1940) offered a careful examination of this printing. He also wrote hundreds of reviews, including a notably caustic rejection of J. Churton Collins's 1905 Oxford edition of Robert Greene.\n\nAt the beginning of World War II, Greg moved to Sussex, where he spent the war working on his edition of \"Faustus.\" In addition, he began to prepare his great works of the 1950s: \"The Editorial Problem in Shakespeare\" (1951), \"The Shakespeare First Folio: Its Bibliographical and Textual History\" (1955), \"Some Aspects and Problems of London Publishing, 1550–1650\" (1954), and the essay \"The rationale of copy-text\" (1950), which had a significant influence on textual criticism. He was Lyell Reader in Bibliography at Oxford University, 1954–5. Greg was knighted in 1950.\n\nGreg was strongly associated with Alfred W. Pollard in developing a modern understanding of the transmission of Shakespeare's texts. His greatest achievement is \"A Bibliography of the English Printed Drama to the Restoration,\" published in four volumes between 1939 and 1959.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "37121281", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37121281", "title": "Zuowanglun", "text": "Zuowanglun\n\nThe Zuowanglun or Zuowang lun is a Daoist meditation text that was written by the Shangqing School patriarch Sima Chengzhen (647–735). Daoism incorporated many Buddhist practices during the Tang Dynasty (618–907), and the \"Zuowanglun\" combined meditation techniques from Daoism (e.g., \"zuowang\" \"sitting forgetting\" and \"guan\" 觀 \"observation\") and Buddhism (\"samatha\" \"calm abiding\" and \"vipassanā\" \"insight\").\n\nSima Chengzhen (or Si-ma Ch'eng-chen) 司馬承禎 (647–735), also known as Daoyin 道隐 \"Recluse of the Dao\" and Baiyunzi 白雲子 \"Master of the White Cloud\", was a native of Henan. He was a descendent of the Jin Dynasty (265–420) imperial house, and his family included many high-ranking scholar-officials. Although Sima received a traditional education in the Confucian classics, he chose a career in Daoism, and was ordained by the Shangqing \"Highest Clarity\" School in 669. Sima was promoted to Shangqing Grand Master in 684, and became a favorite of the imperial court and aristocracy. Russell Kirkland (2008:911) describes Sima Chengzhen as \"perhaps the most important [D]aoist of Tang times.\"\n\nThere are two received \"Zuowanglun\" editions and a stone inscription on Mount Wangwu.\n\nThe \"Zuowanglun\" text exists in two main editions. One is in Zhang Junfang's (1019) \"Yunji Qiqian\" 雲笈七籤 \"\nSeven Cloudy Satchel\" and Xu Song's (1819) \"Quan Tangwen\" 全唐文 \"Complete Tang Literature\". Another is in the (1444) \"Daozang\" \"Daoist Canon\" and (1796-1820) \"Daozang jiyao\" 道藏輯要 \"Essentials of the Daoist Canon\".\n\nThere are two prefaces with the text, one by the author Sima Chengzhen and another by the otherwise unknown recluse Zhenjing 真靜.\n\nA shorter \"Zuowanglun\" inscription on a stele, dated to the year 829, was placed in front of a temple dedicated to Sima Chengzhen erected in Jiyuan on Mount Wangwu, his last residence. It summarizes the key features of the text. Kohn (2010:9) says it \"is probably an early forerunner\", and translates (2010:159-162) this \"Inscription on Oblivion\".\n\nThe \"Zuowanglun\" elucidates seven steps, involving various practices, \"including Buddhist-inspired concentration, observation, and absorption\" (Kohn 2010:8), that gradually lead one from ordinary consciousness to \"dedao\" 得道 \"attaining the Dao; becoming enlightened\".\n\nThe Zhenjing preface explains.\nAs the author's understanding and viewpoint are extraordinary indeed, he clarifies Dao very well. First he leads the reader to feel \"respect and faith\" so that his mind may be no longer in mad confusion. Then he makes him \"break off his karmic conditions\" and factors, \"tame his mind,\" and \"detach himself from affairs\" so that he can be serene in his physical structure and illuminated within. By the next step of \"perfect observation\" of center and periphery, being and nonbeing, he can then step into the \"stability of cosmic peace,\" where the qi is peaceful and the spirit stable. Thus it is called \"attaining Dao.\" (Kohn 2010:61)\n\nThere are English translations of the \"Zuowanglun\" by Livia Kohn (1987, 1993:235-241, 2010) and Thomas Cleary (2000).\n\nThe title is translated as:\n\nKohn explains choosing \"oblivion\" instead of \"forgetfulness\".\nI translate \"wang\" as \"oblivion\" and \"oblivious\" rather than \"forgetting\" or \"forgetful\" because the connotation of \"forget\" in English is that one \"should\" remember but doesn't do so, or – if used intentionally – that one actively and intentionally does something in the mind. None of these holds true for what ancient and medieval Daoists were about. This is borne out both by the language and the writings: the word \"wang\" in Chinese consists of the character \"xin\" for \"mind-heart,\" usually associated with conscious and emotional reactions to reality and the word \"wang\" for \"obliterate\" or \"perish.\" The implication is – as indeed described in the sources – that one lets go of all kinds of intentional and reactive patterns and comes to rest in oneness with spirit and is ready to merge completely with Dao. (Kohn 2010:1) \n\nThe \"Zuowanglun\" is associated with six contemporaneous texts by Daoist mediation masters from the \"Chongxuan\" 重玄 \"Twofold Mystery\" and Shangqing \"Highest Clarity\" Schools. Sima Chengzhen led an influential school of Buddho-Daoist mediation centered on Mount Tiantai, which was also the headquarters of the Tiantai school of Buddhism.\n\nThe (early 8th century) \"Dingguanjing\" 定觀經 \"Scripture on Concentration and Observation\", or \"Dongxuan lingbao dingguanjing\" 洞玄靈寶定觀經 \"Scripture on Concentration and Observation of the Numinous Treasure from the Cavern Mystery\", appears three times in the Daoist Canon: as an appendix to the \"Zuowanglun\" edition, as a separate text (DZ 400, tr. Kohn 2010:163-173), and in the \"Yunji Qiqian\" anthology. This 49-stanza text outlines the psychological transition from an ordinary perspective with emotions and desires to a mental state of stability and quietude (Kohn 2010:65). The popular \"Dingguanjing\" was summarized under the title \"Guanmiaojing\" 觀妙經 \"Scripture on Concentration on the Mystery\" (DZ 326).\n\nThe \"Cunshen lianqiming\" 存神鍊氣銘 \"Inscription on Visualizing Spirit and Refining Qi\" (DZ 834, tr. Kohn 2010:174-178) is attributed to the Daoist physician and alchemist Sun Simiao (d. 682). This text first records five phases in taming the mind and seven stages in transforming the body into immortality, which the \"Zuowanglun\" appendix and \"Dingguanjing\" repeat.\n\nThe \"Tianyinzi\" 天隱子 \"[Book of the] Master of Heavenly Seclusion\" was allegedly transmitted by Wu Yun 吳筠 (d. 778) and edited by Sima Chengzhen, who wrote the \"Oral Instructions\" postface. This text is contained in the Daoist Canon (DZ 1026, tr, Kohn 2010:188-197), and has been republished many times in non-Daoist collections. The \"Tianyinzi\" emphasizes gradual progress toward the Dao through simplicity, fasting, seclusion, visualization, sitting in forgetfulness, and spirit liberation. Present day \"qigong\" practitioners consider the \"Tianyinzi\" to be a core text (Kohn 2010:68).\n\nThe \"Xinmulun\" 心目論 \"Treatise on Mind and Eyes\", also by Wu Yun, is an imaginary dialogue between the heart-mind and eyes (DZ 1038, tr. Kohn 2010:207-212). The mind accuses the eyes (representing the senses) of causing confusion and agitation, but the eyes argue that the mind is ultimately responsible. The mind resolves to eliminate thoughts with \"zuowang\" in order to achieve liberation. Wu Yun uses various water metaphors (frequently written with the water radical 水 or 氵) to describe mental activities (Kohn 2010:83). He emphasizes the distraught and unhappy state of mind with words like \"luan\"亂 \"chaotic; confused\" and \"Iun\" 淪 \"engulfed; muddled\"; and uses images like \"cheng hundun\" 乘混沌 \"ride on pure chaos\" and become one with the \"hanman\" 汗漫 \"vast expanse of water\" to express the mind's longing for clarity and freedom. Abstract purity and defilement are also expressed in water-terms of \"qing\" 清 \"clarity; standing water that is lucid to the bottom\" and \"zi\" 滓 \"dregs; sediments; defilements\".\n\nThe (late 6th century) \"Neiguanjing\" 內觀經 \"Scripture of Inner Observation\" (DZ 641, tr Kohn 2010:179-187) is written in the words of Laozi (deified as Lord Lao 老君). This treatise describes inner meditations on the human body, Buddho-Daoist psychological terms, and internal purification.\n\nThe \"Wuchujing\" 五廚經 \"Scripture of the Five Kitchens\" (DZ 763, tr. Kohn 2010:198-206) was edited and annotated by Yin Yin 尹愔 and presented to the Tang court in 736. This mystical poem is devoted to the Five \"Zang\" \"Organs\", with \"Kitchens\" figuratively meaning \"qi\" processing in \"neidan\" \"internal alchemy\". The text is also transmitted in a Buddhist version. Modern Daoists consider the \"Wuchujing\" as talismanic and chant it for protection.\n\n\n"}
