He was a great authority on the Arabic language as well as a rationalist theologian.\n\nAl-Zamakhshari was born in Zamakhshar, Khwarezmia, on Wednesday 27 Rajab, 467 AH/ 18 March, 1075 AD. He became a renowned scholar of the Mutazilite school of Islam. He used Persian for some of his work, although he was a strong supporter of the Arabic language as well as an opponent of the Shu'ubiyya movement. After losing one of his feet to frostbite, he carried a notarized declaration that his foot was missing due to accident, rather than a legal amputation for any crime.\n\nHe is best known for \"Al-Kashshaaf\", a seminal commentary on the Qur'an. The commentary is famous for its deep linguistic analysis of the verses, however has been criticised for the inclusion of Mu'tazilite philosophical views.\n\nFor many years he stayed in Mecca, for which he became known as Jar-Allah (\"God's neighbour\"). He later returned to Khwarezm, where he died in 1144 at the capital Gorgan (in the present Gulestan Province, Iran).\n\nHe studied at Bukhara and Samarkand while enjoying the fellowship of jurists of Baghdad.\n\nAl-Zamakhshari died in the Monday night of 8th Zulhijja, 538 AH/ 12 June, 1144 AD.\n\nThe author of more than fifty books, Zamakhshari's fame as a scholar rests upon his commentary on the Qur'an.

He was chairman of the board of the British Library from 1985 to 1990.\n\nIn 1983, he was made a life peer as Baron Quinton, of Holywell in the City of Oxford and County of Oxfordshire.\n\nTo BBC Radio audiences, Quinton became well known as a presenter of the long-running \"Round Britain Quiz\".\n\nIn the debate about philosophical universals, Quinton defended a variety of nominalism that identifies properties with a set of \"natural\" classes. David Malet Armstrong has been strongly critical of natural class nominalism: Armstrong believes that Quinton's 'natural' classes avoid a fairly fundamental flaw with more primitive class nominalisms, namely that it has to assume that for every class you can construct, it must then have an associated property. The problem for the class nominalist according to Armstrong is that one must come up with some criteria to determine classes that back properties and those which just contain a collection of heterogeneous objects.\n\nQuinton's version of class nominalism asserts that determining which are the natural property classes is simply a basic fact that is not open to any further philosophical scrutiny. Armstrong argues that whatever it is which picks out the natural classes is not derived from the membership of that class, but from some fact about the particular itself.\n\nWhile Quinton's theory states that no further analysis of the classes is possible, he also says that some classes may be more or less natural—that is, more or less unified than another class. Armstrong illustrates this intuitive difference Quinton is appealing to by pointing to the difference between the class of coloured objects and the class of crimson objects: the crimson object class is more unified in some intuitive sense (how is not specified) than the class of coloured objects.\n\nIn Quinton's 1957 paper, he sees his theory as a less extreme version of nominalism than that of Willard van Orman Quine, Nelson Goodman and Stuart Hampshire.\n\n\n"}

It is part of the broader field of hermeneutics which involves the study of principles of interpretation for all forms of communication, nonverbal and verbal.\n\nWhile Jewish and Christian Biblical hermeneutics have some overlap and dialogue, they have distinctly separate interpretative traditions.\n\nTalmudical hermeneutics (Hebrew: approximately, מידות שהתורה נדרשת בהן) refers to Jewish methods for the investigation and determination of the meaning of the Hebrew Bible, as well as rules by which Jewish law could be established. One well-known summary of these principles appears in the Baraita of Rabbi Ishmael.\n\nMethods by which the Talmud explores the meaning of scripture:\n\nThe rabbis of the Talmud considered themselves to be the receivers and transmitters of an Oral Torah as to the meaning of the scriptures. They considered this oral tradition to set forth the precise, original meanings of the words, revealed at the same time and by the same means as the original scriptures themselves. Interpretive methods listed above such as word play and letter counting were never used as logical proof of the meaning or teaching of a scripture. Instead they were considered to be an \"asmakhta\", a validation of a meaning that was already set by tradition or a homiletic backing for rabbinic rulings.\n\nUntil the Enlightenment, biblical hermeneutics was usually seen as a form of special hermeneutics (like legal hermeneutics); the status of scripture was thought to necessitate a particular form of understanding and interpretation.\n\nIn the nineteenth century it became increasingly common to read scripture just like any other writing, although the different interpretations were often disputed. Friedrich Schleiermacher argued against a distinction between \"general\" and \"special\" hermeneutics, and for a general theory of hermeneutics applicable to all texts, including the Bible. Various methods of higher criticism sought to understand the Bible purely as a human, historical document.\n\nThe concept of hermeneutics has acquired at least two different but related meanings which are in use today. Firstly, in the older sense, biblical hermeneutics may be understood as the theological principles of exegesis which is often virtually synonymous with 'principles of biblical interpretation' or methodology of biblical exegesis. Secondly, the more recent development is to understand the term 'biblical hermeneutics' as the broader philosophy and linguistic underpinnings of interpretation. The question is posed: \"How is understanding possible?\" The rationale of this approach is that, while Scripture is \"more than just an ordinary text,\" it is certainly \"no less than an ordinary text.\" Scripture is in the first analysis \"text\" which human beings try to understand; in this sense, the principles of understanding any text apply to the Bible as well (regardless of whatever other additional, specifically theological principles are considered).\n\nIn this second sense, all aspects of philosophical and linguistic hermeneutics are considered to be applicable to the biblical texts, as well. There are obvious examples of this in the links between 20th-century philosophy and Christian theology. For example, Rudolf Bultmann's hermeneutical approach was strongly influenced by existentialism, and in particular by the philosophy of Martin Heidegger; and since the 1970s, the philosophical hermeneutics of Hans-Georg Gadamer have had a wide-ranging influence on biblical hermeneutics as developed by a wide range of Christian theologians. The French-American philosopher René Girard follows a similar trail.\n\nBiblical scholars have noted the diversity of interpretations by Protestants and to a lesser extent by Catholics. In his forward to R. C. Sproul’s \"Knowing Scripture\", J. I. Packer observes that Protestant theologians are in conflict about biblical interpretation. To illustrate the diversity of biblical interpretations, William Yarchin pictures a shelf full of religious books saying different things, but all claiming to be faithful interpretations of the Bible. Bernard Ramm observed that such diverse interpretations underlie the doctrinal variations in Christendom. A mid-19th century book on biblical interpretation observed that even those who believe the Bible to be the word of God hold the most discordant views about fundamental doctrines.\n\nThe Catholic Church asserts the capital importance of biblical interpretation and Catholic scholars recognize some diversity in the Bible. This allows for an openness of interpretation as long as it stays within the Catholic Church’s theological Tradition. So it is that theological factors set the parameters for interpreting the Scripture that Catholics believe to be the word of God. Such parameters disallow the widely differing interpretations that make it possible for Protestants to prove almost anything by the Bible.\n\nThis form of theological hermeneutics in the mainstream Protestant tradition considers Christian Biblical hermeneutics in the tradition of explication of the text, or exegesis, to deal with various principles that can be applied to the study of Scripture. If the canon of Scripture is considered as an organic whole, rather than an accumulation of disparate individual texts written and edited in the course of history, then any interpretation that contradicts any other part of scripture is not considered to be sound. Biblical hermeneutics differs from hermeneutics and within traditional Protestant theology, there are a variety of interpretive formulae. Such formulae are generally not mutually exclusive, and interpreters may adhere to several of these approaches at once. These formulae include:\n\nTheological Group of Principles:\n\nSub-divided Context/Mention Principles:\n\nFigures of Speech Group of Principles:\n\nIn the interpretation of a text, hermeneutics considers the original medium as well as what language says, supposes, doesn't say, and implies. The process consists of several steps for best attaining the Scriptural author's intended meaning(s). One such process is taught by Henry A Virkler, in \"Hermeneutics: Principles and Processes of Biblical Interpretation\" (1981):\n\nHoward Hendricks, longtime professor of hermeneutics at Dallas Theological Seminary, set out the method of observing the text, interpreting the text, applying the text in his book, \"Living By the Book\". Other major Christian teachers, such as Charles R. (Chuck) Swindoll, who wrote the foreword, Kay Arthur and David Jeremiah have based their hermeneutics on the principles Hendricks teaches.\n\nIn his book \"God Centered Biblical Interpretation\" (1999), Vern Poythress, Professor of New Testament Interpretation at Westminster Theological Seminary in Philadelphia, presented a hermeneutical technique based on the pattern of \"speaker, discourse, and hearer\". According to Poythress, the study of the Bible must acknowledge all three aspects: God as the speaker, the Bible as His speech, and the people to whom He speaks. Thus, context plays a primary role in Poythress's study of Biblical teachings. He lists three general concepts to understand about any passage of Scripture:\n\nDavid L. Barr states there are three obstacles that stand in the way of correctly interpreting the biblical writings: We speak a different language, we live approximately two millennia later, and we bring different expectations to the text. Additionally, Barr suggests that we approach the reading of the Bible with significantly different literary expectations than those in reading other forms of literature and writing.\n\nThe Catholic Encyclopedia lists a number of principles guiding Roman Catholic hermeneutics in the article on Exegesis (note: the Catholic Encyclopedia was written in 1917 and does not reflect the changes set forth by the encyclical \"Divino afflante Spiritu\" published by Pius XII in 1943, which opened modern Catholic Biblical scholarship) :\n\nPope Benedict XVI has indicated in Verbum Domini, the post-synodal apostolic exhortation on the Word of God, that \"Christianity...perceives in the words the Word himself, the Logos who displays his mystery through this complexity and the reality of human history\". He encourages a “faith-filled interpretation of Sacred Scripture”. He emphasizes that this manner of interpretation, “practiced from antiquity within the Church’s Tradition...recognizes the historical value of the biblical tradition\". It \"seeks to discover the living meaning of the Sacred Scriptures for the lives of believers today while not ignoring the human mediation of the inspired text and its literary genres\". Verbum Domini #44.\n\nTrajectory hermeneutics or redemptive-movement hermeneutics (RMH) is a hermeneutical approach that seeks to locate varying 'voices' in the text and to view these voices as a progressive trajectory through history (or at least through the Biblical witness); often a trajectory that progresses through to the present day. The contemporary reader of Scripture is in some way envisaged by the Biblical text as standing in continuity with a developing theme therein. The reader, then, is left to discern this trajectory and appropriate it accordingly.\n\nWilliam J. Webb employed such a hermeneutic, in his \"Slaves, Women & Homosexuals\". Webb shows how the moral commands of the Old and New Testament were a significant improvement over the surrounding cultural values and practices. Webb identified 18 different ways in which God dealt with his people moving against the current of popular cultural values. While for Webb the use of this hermeneutic moves to highlight the progressive liberation of women and slaves from oppressive male/bourgeois dominance, the prohibition of homosexual acts consistently moves in a more conservative manner than that of the surrounding Ancient Near East or Graeco-Roman societies. While Paul does not explicitly state that slavery should be abolished, the trajectory seen in Scripture is a progressive liberation of slaves. When this is extended to modern times, it implies that the Biblical witness supports the abolition of slavery. The progressive liberation of women from oppressive patriarchalism, traced from Genesis and Exodus through to Paul's own acknowledgement of women as 'co-workers' (), sets a precedent that when applied to modern times suggests that women ought to have the same rights and roles afforded to men. Historically, the Biblical witness has become progressively more stringent in its views of homosexual practice and the implications of this are not commented upon by Webb.\n\n\n"}

Known as an innovative reinterpreter of Buddhist doctrine and Thai folk beliefs, Buddhadasa fostered a reformation in conventional religious perceptions in his home country, Thailand, as well as abroad. Buddhadasa developed a personal view that those who have penetrated the essential nature of religions consider \"all religions to be inwardly the same\", while those who have the highest understanding of \"dhamma\" feel \"there is no religion\".\n\nHe was born Nguam Phanit (; ) in 1906 in Ban Phumriang, Chaiya District, southern Thailand. His father, Sieng Phānit, was a shopkeeper of second generation Thai Chinese (Hokkien) ancestry and his mother, Klaun, was Thai. \n\nBuddhadasa renounced civilian life in 1926. Typical of young monks during the time, he traveled to the capital, Bangkok, for doctrinal training but found the wats there dirty, crowded, and, most troubling to him, the sangha corrupt, \"preoccupied with prestige, position, and comfort with little interest in the highest ideals of Buddhism.\" As a result, he returned to his native rural district and occupied a forest tract near to his village, founding \"Suan Mokkh\" in 1932.\n\nIn later years, Buddhadasa's teachings attracted many international seekers to his hermitage. He held talks with leading scholars and clergy of various faiths. His aim in these discussions was to probe the similarities at the heart of each of the major world religions. Before his death in 1993, he established an International Dhamma Hermitage Center across the highway from his own retreat to aid in the teaching of Buddhism and other yogic practices to international students. The area of \"Suan Mokkh\" was expanded to\napproximately 120 acres of forest. \n\nHowever, Buddhadasa was skeptical of his fame; when reflecting on the busloads of visitors to Suan Mokkh he would say, \"sometimes I think many of these people just stop here because they have to visit the bathroom.\"\n\nBuddhadasa strove for a simple, pristine practice in attempt to emulate Gautama Buddha's core teaching, \"Do good, avoid bad, and purify the mind.\" He therefore avoided the customary ritualism and internal politics that dominated Siamese clerical life. His ability to explain complex philosophical and religious ideas in his native Southern Thai attracted many people to his wooded retreat.\n\nHis primary teaching mainly focused on the quiet awareness of one's breathing pattern called anapanasati. However, his personal practice was very much grounded in advanced research and interpretation of early Pali texts on the one hand and on his radical private experimentation on the other.\n\nBuddhadasa rejected the traditional rebirth and karma doctrine, since he thought it to be incompatible with \"sunyata\", and not conductive to the extinction of \"dukkha\". \n\nBuddhadasa, states John Powers – a professor of Asian Studies and Buddhism, offered a \"rationalist interpretation\" and called \"the whole question of rebirth to be foolish\". According to Buddhadasa, the Buddha taught 'no-self' (Skt \"anatman\", Pali \"anatta\"), which denies any substantial, ongoing entity or soul. Powers quotes Buddhadasa view as, \"because there is no one born, there is no one who dies and is reborn\". Therefore, states Buddhadasa, \"the whole question of rebirth has nothing to do with Buddhism... in the sphere of the Buddhist teachings there is no question of rebirth or reincarnation\". Its goal is \"nibbana\", which Buddhadasa describes as a state \"beyond all suffering that also transcends ordinary conceptions of happiness.\"\n\nBuddhadasa explains paticcasamupadda as the \"birth\" of \"I\" and mine through sense-contact with objects, and the resulting vedana (\"feeling\"), tanha (\"thirst,\" craving) and upadana (clinging). It is by relinquising the notion of \"I\" and \"mine\" that selfish clinging is abandoned, and Nirvana or true emptiness will be reached. This can be done by \"not allow[ing] the dependent arising to take place; to cut it off right at the moment of sense-contact.\"\n\nBuddhadasa's views have been \"strongly criticized\" and rejected by many of his fellow Theravada Buddhism monks with a more orthodox view of the Buddhist Dhamma. For example, Bhikkhu Bodhi states that Buddhadasa's approach of jettisoning the rebirth doctrine \"would virtually reduce the Dhamma to tatters... the conception of rebirth is an essential plank to its ethical theory, providing an incentive for avoiding all evil and doing good\", summarizes Powers.\n\nFrom the earliest period of his religious studies, Buddhadasa utilized a comparative approach and sought to be able to explain \"Buddhist's teachings through other thought systems such as Taoism, Hinduism, Confucianism, Jainism and Natural Science.\" Through such a methodology he came to adopt a religious world-view wherein he stated, \"those who have penetrated to the essential nature of religion will regard all religions as being the same. Although they may say there is Buddhism, Judaism, Taoism, Islam, or whatever, they will also say that all religions are inwardly the same.\"\n\nIn his \"No Religion\" (1993) Buddhadasa he further famously remarked:\n\nBuddhadasa's interpretations of the Buddhist tradition inspired such persons as the French-schooled Pridi Banomyong, leader of the Siamese revolution of 1932, and a group of Thai social activists and artists of the 20th century.\n\nReligious scholar Donald K. Swearer has compared Buddhadasa to the early Indian philosopher Nagarjuna, and the 5th-century south Indian scholar Buddhaghosa who has \"overshadowed the development of Theravada Buddhist thought\" in southeast Asia. According to Swearer, the Thai teacher Buddhadasa \"stands in polar opposition to such normative figures as Buddhaghosa\" in several respects. Buddhadasa's writings, for example, decidedly contrast with the scholastic and highly influential \"Visuddhimagga\" of Buddhaghosa. Buddhadasa has been influential in the \"arannavasi\" (forest tradition) of Thai Buddhism, and his ideas have influenced the radical sectarian movement founder Santi Asoke, according to Swearer.\n\nAccording to scholars such as Peter Jackson and Daniel Lynch, Buddhadasa was heavily influenced by the ideas found in Zen Buddhism. Buddhadasa considered the Zen ideas as a way to reconcile Theravada Buddhism with modern humanism, and thought them to be the reason for Japan's economic strength.\n\nBuddhadasa's works literally take up an entire room in the National Library of Thailand. The following are some of his well-known books in English translation.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5510037", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5510037", "title": "Colarbasians", "text": "Colarbasians\n\nIn Christian Gnostic religious history, the Colarbasians (from Gk. Colarbasus, Hippol., Ps. Tert.; Colorbasus, Iren., Epiph., Theodoret, Philast. cod., Aug.; \"C. Bassus\" Philast. codd.) were a supposed sect of the 2nd century, deemed heretics, so called from their leader Colarbasus, a disciple of Valentinius. Colarbasus, along with Marcus, another disciple of Valentinius, was said to maintain the whole plenitude, and perfection of truth and religion, to be contained in the Greek alphabet; and that it was for this reason that Jesus was called the \"Alpha and Omega\".\n\nThe name occurs first, and that only incidentally, in a solitary passage of Irenaeus (i. 14, 1) which has been the subject of much discussion.\n\nMarcus, Irenaeus seems to say, boasted that he alone was allowed to become the womb and receptacle of the Sigé (\"Silence\") of Colarbasus; the offspring to which he gave birth being the statement and revelation recorded afterwards. There is no previous mention of Colarbasus. Irenaeus has for six pages been speaking of Marcus alone. Eleven pages back he refers briefly to \"a certain other \"Illustrious\" teacher of theirs\" [the Valentinians]; but there is no coincidence of doctrine, and nothing to suggest that the nameless, or obscurely named [Epiphanes], heretic was himself Colarbasus, as some have supposed.\n\nAccording to Philaster (\"Haer\". 43) Colarbasus taught after Marcus and \"in like manner:\" his two lines of description are merely a vague echo of Marcosian doctrine. Pseudo-Tertullian (15) combines the two names indistinguishably in one article. Their common source, the lost Compendium of Hippolytus, can have contained no special information about Colarbasus. When Hippolytus wrote the great later treatise \"Against all Heresies\", he was evidently not better instructed. At the beginning of the sixth book he promises to describe \"the doctrines held by Marcus and Colarbasus;\" he devotes in due course twenty-three pages to a repetition of Irenaeus's account of Marcus; and at the end he considers he has sufficiently shown who [viz., Pythagoreans and astrologers] were the masters of Marcus and Colarbasus, \"the successors in the school of Valentinus:\" yet not a word is given to Colarbasus separately. Once elsewhere (iv. 13) Colarbasus is said to have \"endeavoured to expound theology by measures and numbers;\" but this is simply the Marcosian method.\n\nThe proceeding of Epiphanius of Salamis is more audacious. He has a separate article (\"Haer\", xxxv. 258–262) on Colarbasus, the composition of which has been fully laid bare by R. A. Lipsius (\"Zur Quellengesch. d. Epiph\". 167 f.). The long account of Marcus in Irenaeus is preceded by a series of short notices (mostly without names) of the chief doctrines maintained by different branches of the great Valentinian sect. The passage relating to one group distinguished as \"those who are reputed to be the wiser among them,\" is transferred bodily by Epiphanius to Colarbasus, and with it, stranger still, the next paragraph down to the end of the chapter, though it sets forth in single sentences the doctrines of no less than five sets of Valentinians about the Saviour. The passage about the \"wise\" group immediately follows one on Ptolemaeus; and accordingly Epiphanius makes Colarbasus to spring from \"the root of Ptolemaeus,\" as well as to borrow from Marcus, and attributes to him a purpose of devising a greater and more ingenious scheme than his predecessors.\n\nTheodoret (\"Haer. Fab\". i. 12) merely abbreviates Epiphanius, changing at the same time \"Colorbasus\" into \"the Colorbasians.\" A doubtful conjecture has brought Colarbasus into a single sentence of Tertullian (\"adv. Val.\" 4), where at most no more is said than that a road was marked out for him by Valentinus; Ptolemaeus is named next, then Heracleon, Secundus, and Marcus.\n\nAll these various writers against heresies are known to have learned, directly or indirectly, from Irenaeus; and every statement of theirs about Colarbasus can be at once traced, through transcription or immediate inference, to something in the text of Irenaeus not far distant from the place where the name of Colarbasus occurs. On the other hand, the reports of doctrine have little or nothing in common, Hippolytus and his followers make Colarbasus to have taught only what Marcus taught: Epiphanius and his copyist fathers upon him the discordant views of a miscellaneous cluster of Valentinians.\n\nThe credit of detecting the cause of the confusion belongs to C. A. Heumann (\"Hamburgische Vermischte Bibliothek\", 1743, i. 145). He got rid of the mysterious double of Marcus by pointing out that \"Chol-arba\" (כלארבע) means \"All-Four\" i.e. the divine Tetrad, which in the scheme of Marcus stood at the head of the Pleroma. He was less successful in dealing with the details of the text: and F. C. Baur (\"K.G. d.\" 3 \"erst. Jahrh\". i. 204) has rightly substituted \"Col\" (קול) for \"Chol\" (\"The Voice of Four\" for \"All-Four\"). Volkmar explains the appearance of \"s\" by the Aramaic commutation of ע with צ, and the \"o\" of several authorities by Theodoret's \"Kossianos\" for \"Kassianos\": \"Colassae\" and \"Colossae\" afford a still better illustration.\n\nBoth the Tetrad and Sigé appear in the context as if they made revelations to Marcus, but (what has not been sufficiently observed) in different ways. When Irenaeus is simply recording what he found in his Marcosian authority, he speaks of the Tetrad or Tetractys. Thus (66–69):—\n\nSigé on the other hand, is mentioned only when Irenaeus speaks in his own person, and always with a touch of sarcasm. Thus (68–78):\n\nIt may therefore be questioned whether Marcus ever represented Sigé as herself visiting him. Two passages indeed suggest pretty clearly that he held her to be faithful to her name. Speaking of \"Truth,\" virtually the alphabet, also called Man, he says (69) that she \"is the fountain of every speech, and the beginning of every voice, and the utterance of everything unutterable, and the mouth of the unspoken Sigé (\"tês siôpômenês Sigês\"). Again we hear (64) that Marcosians were taught to offer a prayer for deliverance from \"the Judge\" to a female divinity addressed as \"thou that sittest beside God and the mystic Sigé before the aeons\" (or ages: \"ô paredre theou k. t. l.\"). This address supplies the required clue, for the divinity is called \"the Mother,\" in a passage almost immediately preceding the occurrence of the name Colarbasus; and elsewhere (75: cf. 84) \"the Mother of the Universe\" is identified with \"the first Tetrad.\" Sigé herself then doubtless remains hidden above; but her mysteries are made known to Marcus by the Tetrad, the \"Colarbas\" or \"Voice of Four\", who must be the (nameless) \"most mighty power from the invisible and innominable places,\" to whom he boasted that he owed his \"knowledge,\" as we read in Irenaeus's first paragraph about him (60).\n\nThe difficulty of the primary phrase \"tês Kolarbasou Sigês\" remains. In the absence of a second article, it can only mean \"the Sigé of Colarbas\" (or Colarbasus) instead of \"the Colarbas (or Colarba) of Sigé,\" as the sense above elicited requires. The difficulty would be lightened, and the perplexing termination of \"Kolarbasou\" at the same time removed, by reading \"tês Kolarbas ek Sigês\", \"the Colarba (Voice of Four) proceeding out of Sigé (Silence).\" In round continuous uncials the change would be easy, EK and OY having much resemblance when written. The two names would thus stand in the right relation to each other. The phrase however would still be briefer than we should expect. The sudden appearance of the Hebrew term remains likewise unaccounted for. The obscurity evidently lies in the original text of Irenaeus, if not of the authority whom he followed; and it was found as embarrassing in the 3rd and 4th centuries as now. It was only disguised, not removed, by supposing a heretic named Colarbasus.\n\n"}

Since, following Leibniz, the mind can be given a computational treatment, digital philosophy attempts to consider some main issues in the philosophy of mind. The digital approach attempts to deal with the non-deterministic quantum theory, where it assumes that all information must have finite and discrete means of its representation, and that the evolution of a physical state is governed by local and deterministic rules.\n\nIn digital physics, existence and thought would consist of only computation. (However, not all computation would be thought.) Thus computation is the single substance of a monist metaphysics, while subjectivity arises from computational universality. There are many variants of digital philosophy; however, most of them are Digital data theories that view all of physical realities and cognitive science and so on, in framework of information theory.\n\n\nFredkin takes a radical approach to explaining the EPR paradox and the double-slit experiment in quantum mechanics. While admitting that quantum mechanics yields accurate predictions, Fredkin sides with Einstein in the Bohr-Einstein debates. In \"The Meaning of Relativity\", Einstein writes, \"One can give good reasons why reality cannot at all be represented by a continuous field. From the quantum phenomena it appears to follow with certainty that a finite system of finite energy can be completely described by a finite set of numbers (quantum numbers). This does not seem to be in accordance with a continuum theory, and must lead to attempts to find a purely algebraic theory for the description of reality. However, nobody knows how to find the basis for such a description.\"\n\nEinstein's hope is a purely algebraic theory; however, Fredkin attempts to find a purely informational theory for the description of reality. At the same time, physicists find some vagueness, problems with Bell theorem compatibility, and lack of empirical falsifiability in Fredkin's expression of his ideas. \nIn \"Digital Philosophy (DP)\", Chapter 11, Fredkin raises the question, \"Could physics have a strong law of conservation of information?\" Fredkin answers his own question, \"If so, we have to rethink particle disintegrations, inelastic collisions and Quantum Mechanics to better understand what is happening to the information. The appearance of a single truly random event is absolutely incompatible with a strong law of conservation of information. A great deal of information is obviously associated with the trajectory of every particle and that information must be conserved. This is a very large issue in DP, yet such issues are seldom considered in conventional physics.\"\n\nAccording to Fredkin, \"Digital mechanics predicts that for every continuous symmetry of physics there will be some microscopic process that violates that symmetry.\" Therefore, according to Fredkin, at the Planck scale, ordinary matter could have spin angular momentum that violates the equivalence principle.There might be weird Fredkin forces that cause a torsion in spacetime.\n\nThe Einstein-Cartan theory extends general relativity theory to deal with spin-orbit coupling when matter with spin is present. According to conventional wisdom in physics, torsion is nonpropagating, which means that torsion will appear within a massive body and nowhere else. According to Fredkin, torsion could appear outside and around massive bodies, because alternate universes have anomalous inertial effects.\n\n"}

The word is derived from the comparative form of Greek ἔξω \"eksô\", \"from, out of, outside\". It signifies anything which is public, without limits, or universal. It is distinguished from internal esoteric knowledge. \"Exoteric\" relates to external reality as opposed to a person's thoughts or feelings. It is knowledge that is public as opposed to secret or cabalistic. It is not required that exoteric knowledge come easily or automatically, but it should be referenceable or reproducible.\n\nMost philosophical and religious belief systems presume that reality must be independent of what an individual makes of it. However, even before the days of Plato, a prominent alternate theory of knowledge insisted that the perceived outside reality is merely an internal fabrication of the observer and that it has no existence or substance outside the imagination of the observer. The Buddha's statement: \"All that we are arises with our thoughts\" (Dhammapada 1.1) is reminiscent of this.\n\nIn his book entitled \"The Book of Five Rings\", the Japanese swordsmaster Miyamoto Musashi noted that when he teaches people martial arts, \"since [he] generally makes them learn such things as have actual relevance to addressing [deeper principles], there is no such thing as a distinction between the esoteric and the exoteric.\" \n\nIn the same way as the term \"esoteric\" is often associated with esoteric spirituality, the term \"exoteric\" is mostly used in discussions of religion and spirituality, as when the teachings shift the believer's focus away from an exploration of the inner self and towards an adherence to rules, laws, and an individual God.\n\nThe term \"exoteric\" may also reflect the notion of a divine identity that is outside of, and different from, human identity, whereas the esoteric notion claims that the divine is to be discovered \"within\" the human identity. Going one step further, the pantheistic notion suggests that the divine and the material world are one and the same.\n\nThe exoteric form of government is one where all actions taken by the government must be both publicly disclosed and ratified by the public. This is often referred to as transparency of governance.\n\nMany societies are divided into 2 sections—the \"exoteric\" or \"public face\" and the \"esoteric\" or \"behind closed doors\". Such are many fraternal organizations, such as Freemasonry, which are at some level accessible to the uninitiated but which have higher and higher levels of initiation as one progresses.\n\n\n"}

For example, a species of plant may come in two varieties: one which prefers wetter soil and one which prefers dryer soil. During a period of wet years, the wet variety will be more fit and produce more offspring, and thereby increase the frequency of wet-preferring plants. If this wet period is followed by drought, the dry variety will be selected for and its numbers will increase. As periods of dryness and wetness fluctuate, so too does selection on dry-preferring and wet-preferring plants. Fluctuating selection is also manifest at the genic level. Consider two alleles, A and B, which are found at the same locus. Fluctuating selection dynamics are at play when selection favors A at time t, B at t and A again at t.\n\nFluctuating selection has been characterized by several mathematical models.\nSuch models have led to the identification of fluctuating selection dynamics in evolving populations from a broad range of taxa, including bacteria, eukaryotes and viruses.\n\nFluctuating optimum is the same basis as fluctuating selection but in the context of Personality Theory. It's the idea that hereditary characteristic traits will not always balance, but change in favor of time or environment. Traits can change based on harsh environments and also based on accepted behaviors in certain time periods. \n\nThe Red Queen hypothesis describes coevolutionary 'arms races' between antagonistic species (predators and prey, parasites and hosts, competitors with overlapping niches), emphasizing competition between species and populations rather than within them. Under Red Queen dynamics, a species must adapt to shifting selection pressures of the ever-changing biota which constitute its environment or face extinction. Experiments in Red Queen environments on real and simulated populations have offered strong support for the maintenance of sexual reproduction despite the two-fold cost of sex.\n\nFluctuating selection may also play an important role in host-parasite coevolutionary relationships, specifically in the maintenance of sex. It has been shown that coevolutionary arms race dynamics between host and parasite give way to fluctuating selection dynamics in a minimal environment. Fluctuating selection in Red Queen environments has been suggested as an explanation for the persistence of sex:\n\nThe essence of sex in our theory is that it stores genes that are currently bad but have promise for reuse. It continually tries them in combination, waiting for the time when the focus of disadvantage has moved elsewhere. When this has happened, the genotypes carrying such genes spread by successful reproduction, becoming simultaneously stores for other bad genes and thus onward in continuous succession.\n\nIn this conception of sex, the population is a storehouse of variation and sex is a mechanism for distributing old, minority variants once they become useful. This theory depends on fluctuating selection, as fluctuating selection dynamics make adaptive previously maladaptive variants due to ecological shifts.\n\n"}

He held the first Chair of Philosophy at Lancaster University. Sibley is best known for his 1959 paper \"Aesthetic Concepts\" (\"Philosophical Review\", 68), and for \"Seeking, Scrutinizing and Seeing\" (\"Mind\", 64, 1954). Both papers (and some others) have been anthologized, \"Aesthetic Concepts\" multiple times. \n\nSibley has been considered an important contributor to Aesthetics in the analytical tradition. His collected papers, including some posthumous, were published by Oxford University Press in 2001 as \"Approach To Aesthetics\", together with a companion volume of critical and evaluative essays on his work.\n\nHe was the uncle of the writer and broadcaster Brian Sibley.\n\nMost of Sibley's work in aesthetics is collected in \"Approach to Aesthetics\". He is especially well known for his attempts to distinguish the domains of aesthetic and non-aesthetic. His 1959 paper \"Aesthetic Concepts\" is often referred as one of the landmarks of 20th century aesthetics in the tradition of analytic philosophy. The paper is rich in themes, but the main line of thought suggests that aesthetic concepts cannot be reduced to non-aesthetic concepts, or sufficiently defined in terms of non-aesthetic concepts. This leads Sibley to think that grasping properties of given items requires the capability to exercise taste or aesthetic sensibility. \n\nTopics and problems relating to taste thus became very important to Sibley's approach, and he returned to them through his career. Also, Sibley did not see Aesthetics as remote from philosophy as whole. This is very clear from his brief programmatic note \"About Taste\", published in 1966 in \"British Journal of Aesthetics\". Here Sibley states the situation thus:\n\"The programme that aestheticians must face is thus a large one, the charting of a huge areas neglected by other philosophers working within their customary bonds. Indeed, far from it's(sic) being true that aesthetics is peripheral to philosophy, aestheticians encounter ranges of concepts wider than and inevitably including of those studied by most other branches of philosophy.\"\n\nBeside aesthetics, Sibley worked on the philosophy of perception and the philosophy of mind. His first published paper was a long review of Gilbert Ryle's Concept of Mind in 1950. Later he contributed another piece on Ryle, \"Ryle and Thinking\", to \"Ryle: Collection of Essays\".\n\nHe wrote two papers on the theory of perception, and some papers on the borderline of that field and aesthetics, one paper on colours, and a little piece on applied philosophy. One posthumous paper deals extensively with a certain distinction made by Peter Geach. Other than these, his work was in aesthetics.\n\n\n\nNick Zangwill's article \"Aesthetic Judgment\" in \"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\" discusses Sibley's views, and those of his critics.\n\nProf. Jerrold Levinson \"aesthetic concepts\" The Oxford Companion to Philosophy.

{"id": "12922", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12922", "title": "Gnosis", "text": "Gnosis\n\nGnosis is the common Greek noun for knowledge (γνῶσις, \"gnōsis\", f.). The term is used in various Hellenistic religions and philosophies. It is best known from Gnosticism, where it signifies a knowledge or insight into humanity’s real nature as divine, leading to the deliverance of the divine spark within humanity from the constraints of earthly existence.\n\n\"Gnosis\" is a feminine Greek noun which means \"knowledge\". It is often used for personal knowledge compared with intellectual knowledge (εἶδειν \"eídein\"), as with the French \"connaître\" compared with \"savoir\", the Spanish \"conocer\" compared with \"saber,\" or the German \"kennen\" rather than \"wissen\".\n\nA related term is the adjective \"gnostikos\", \"cognitive\", a reasonably common adjective in Classical Greek. Plato uses the plural adjective γνωστικοί – \"gnostikoi\" and the singular feminine adjective γνωστικὴ ἐπιστήμη – \"gnostike episteme\" in his \"Politikos\" where \"Gnostike episteme\" was also used to indicate one's aptitude. The terms do not appear to indicate any mystic, esoteric or hidden meaning in the works of Plato, but instead expressed a sort of higher intelligence and ability analogous to talent.\n\nIn the Hellenistic era the term became associated with the mystery cults.\n\n\"Gnosis\" is used throughout Greek philosophy as a technical term for experience knowledge (see gnosiology) in contrast to theoretical knowledge or epistemology. The term is also related to the study of knowledge retention or memory (see also cognition), in relation to ontic or ontological, which is how something actually is rather than how something is captured (abstraction) and stored (memory) in the mind.\n\nIrenaeus used the phrase \"knowledge falsely so-called\" (\"pseudonymos gnosis\", from 1 Timothy 6:20) for the title of his book \"On the Detection and Overthrow of False Knowledge\", that contains the adjective \"gnostikos\", which is the source for the 17th-century English term \"Gnosticism\".\n\nThe Greek word \"gnosis\" (knowledge) is used as a standard translation of the Hebrew word \"knowledge\" (דעת da'ath) in the Septuagint, thus:\n\nPhilo also refers to the \"knowledge\" (\"gnosis\") and \"wisdom\" (\"sophia\") of God.\n\nPaul distinguishes \"knowledge\" (\"gnosis\") and \"knowledge falsely so-called\" (\"pseudonymos gnosis\").\n\nThe fathers of early Christianity used the word \"knowledge\" (\"gnosis\") in the New Testament to mean spiritual knowledge or specific knowledge of the divine. This positive usage was to contrast it with how gnostic sectarians used the word. This positive use carried over from Hellenic philosophy into Greek Orthodoxy as a critical characteristic of ascetic practices, through St. Clement of Alexandria, Irenaeus, Hippolytus of Rome, Hegesippus, and Origen.\n\nCardiognosis (\"knowledge of the heart\") from Eastern Christianity related to the tradition of the staretz and in Roman Catholic theology is the view that only God knows the condition of one's relationship with God.\n\nGnosis in Orthodox Christian (primarily Eastern Orthodox) thought is the spiritual knowledge of a saint (one who has obtained theosis) or mystically enlightened human being. Within the cultures of the term's provenance (Byzantine and Hellenic) \"Gnosis\" was a knowledge or insight into the infinite, divine and uncreated in all and above all, rather than knowledge strictly into the finite, natural or material world. Gnosis is transcendental as well as mature understanding. It indicates direct spiritual, experiential knowledge and intuitive knowledge, mystic rather than that from rational or reasoned thinking. Gnosis itself is gained through understanding at which one can arrive via inner experience or contemplation such as an internal epiphany of intuition and external epiphany such as the Theophany.\n\nIn the \"Philokalia,\" it is emphasized that such knowledge is not secret knowledge but rather a maturing, transcendent form of knowledge derived from contemplation (\"theoria\" resulting from practice of \"hesychasm)\", since knowledge cannot truly be derived from knowledge, but rather, knowledge can only be derived from \"theoria\" (to witness, see (vision) or experience). Knowledge, thus plays an important role in relation to \"theosis\" (deification/personal relationship with God) and \"theoria\" (revelation of the divine, vision of God). Gnosis, as the proper use of the spiritual or noetic faculty plays an important role in Orthodox Christian theology. Its importance in the economy of salvation is discussed periodically in the \"Philokalia\" where as direct, personal knowledge of God (noesis; see also Noema) it is distinguished from ordinary epistemological knowledge (episteme—i.e., speculative philosophy).\n\nGnosticism originated in the late first century CE in nonrabbinical Jewish sects and early Christian sects. In the formation of Christianity, various sectarian groups, labeled \"gnostics\" by their opponents, emphasised spiritual knowledge (\"gnosis\") of the Divine spark within, over faith (\"pistis\") in the teachings and traditions of the various communities of Christians. Gnosticism presents a distinction between the highest, unknowable God, and the demiurge “creator” of the material universe. The Gnostics considered the most essential part of the process of salvation to be this personal knowledge, in contrast to faith as an outlook in their world view along with faith in the ecclesiastical authority. They were regarded as heretics by the Fathers of the early church.\n"}
{"id": "22362525", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22362525", "title": "Gunk (mereology)", "text": "Gunk (mereology)\n\nIn mereology, an area of philosophical logic, the term gunk applies to any whole whose parts all have further proper parts. That is, a gunky object is not made of indivisible \"atoms\" or \"simples\". Because parthood is transitive, any part of gunk is itself gunk.\n\nIf point-sized objects are always simple, then a gunky object does not have any point-sized parts. By usual accounts of gunk, such as Alfred Tarski's in 1929, three-dimensional gunky objects also do not have other degenerate parts shaped like one-dimensional curves or two-dimensional surfaces. (See also \"Whitehead's point-free geometry\".)\n\nGunk is an important test case for accounts of the composition of material objects: for instance, Ted Sider has challenged Peter van Inwagen's account of composition because it is inconsistent with the possibility of gunk. Sider's argument also applies to a simpler view than van Inwagen's: mereological \"nihilism\", the view that only material simples exist. If nihilism is necessarily true, then gunk is impossible. But, as Sider argues, because gunk is both conceivable and possible, nihilism is false, or at best a contingent truth.\n\nGunk has also played an important role in the history of topology in recent debates concerning change, contact, and the structure of physical space. The composition of space and the composition of material objects are related by \"receptacles\"—regions of space that could harbour a material object. (The term receptacles was coined by Richard Cartwright (Cartwright 1975).) It seems reasonable to assume that if space is gunky, a receptacle is gunky and then a material object is possibly gunky.\n\nThe term was first used by David Lewis in his work \"Parts of Classes\" (1991). Dean W. Zimmerman defends the possibility of atomless gunk (1996b). See also Hud Hudson (2007).\n\nArguably, discussions of material gunk run all the way back to at least Aristotle and possibly as far back as Anaxagoras, and include such thinkers as William of Ockham, René Descartes, and Alfred Tarski. However, the first contemporary mentionings of gunk is found in the writings of A. N. Whitehead and Bertrand Russell, and later in the writings of David Lewis. Elements of gunk thought are present in Zeno's famous paradoxes of plurality. Zeno argued that if there were such things as discrete instants of time, then objects can never move through time. Aristotle's solution to Zeno's paradoxes involves the idea that time is not made out of durationless instants, but ever smaller temporal intervals. Every interval of time can be divided into smaller and smaller intervals, without ever terminating in some privileged set of durationless instants. In other words, motion is possible because time is gunky. Despite having been a relatively common position in metaphysics, after Cantor's discovery of the distinction between denumerable and non-denumerable infinite cardinalities, and mathematical work by Adolf Grünbaum, gunk theory was no longer seen as a necessary alternative to a topology of space made out of points. Recent mathematical work in the topology of spacetime by scholars such as Peter Roeper and Frank Arntzenius have reopened the question of whether a gunky spacetime is a feasible framework for doing physics.\n\nPossibly the most influential formulation of a theory of gunky spacetime comes from A. N. Whitehead in his seminal work \"Process and Reality\". Whitehead argues that there are no point regions of space and that every region of space has some three dimensional extension. Under a Whiteheadian conception of spacetime, points, lines, planes, and other less-than-three-dimensional objects are constructed out of a method of \"extensive abstraction\", in which points, lines, and planes are identified with infinitely converging abstract sets of nested extended regions.\n\nMany, such as Ted Sider (1993) have argued that even the possibility of gunk undermines another position, that of mereological nihilism. Sider's argument is as follows:\n\n\nThis argument is interesting because all it turns upon is whether or not gunk is even possible, not whether or not the actual world is a gunky one. Sider defends 1) by appealing to the fact that since nihilism is a metaphysical thesis, it must be true or false of necessity. In defense of 2), Sider argues that since a gunk world is conceivable; that is, we can imagine a gunky world without any internal contradiction, the gunk must be possible. 3) Follows from an understanding of necessity and possibility that stems from an understanding of possible world semantics. Simply put, a proposition P is necessarily false if and only if it is false in all possible world, and ff a proposition P is possible, if and only if it is true is at least one possible world. Thus, if a proposition is possible, then it is not necessarily false, as it is not false in all possible worlds. 4) Follows deductively from the other premises.\n\nSider's argument is valid, so most strategies to resist the argument have focused on denying one or more of his premises. Strategies that deny 1) have been called the \"contingency defense\". Deniers of 1) say that the facts that determine the composition of objects are not necessary facts, but can differ in different possible worlds. As such, nihilism is a contingent matter of fact, and the possibility of gunk does not undermine the possibility of nihilism. This is the strategy endorsed by Cameron (2007) and Miller (2010).\n\nAlternatively, one could deny 2) and say that gunk is metaphysically impossible. Most strategies that take this route deny 2) in virtue of denying another relatively common intuition: that conceivability entails metaphysical possibility. Although this metaphysical principle dates back to at least the works of Descartes, recent work by philosophers such as Marcus (2004) and Roca-Royes (2010) have shed some doubt on the reliability of conceivability as a guide to metaphysical possibility.\n\n"}
{"id": "1504912", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1504912", "title": "Hans Sluga", "text": "Hans Sluga\n\nHans D. Sluga (; born April 24, 1937) is a German academic, who has served as a lecturer in philosophy at University College London and is now a professor of philosophy at the University of California, Berkeley, where he has taught since 1970. He teaches and writes on topics in analytic philosophy as well as on political philosophy and has been particularly influenced by the thought of Gottlob Frege, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Martin Heidegger, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Michel Foucault.\n\nHe studied at the University of Bonn and the University of Munich. He subsequently obtained a BPhil at Oxford, where he studied under R. M. Hare, Isaiah Berlin, Gilbert Ryle and Michael Dummett. He describes his philosophical orientation as follows: \"My overall philosophical outlook is radically historicist. I believe that we can understand ourselves only as beings with a particular evolution and history.\"\n\nSluga has worked extensively on the early history of analytic philosophy. In his writings on Gottlob Frege he has sought to establish the influence of Immanuel Kant, Hermann Lotze, and of Neo-Kantians like Cuno Fischer and Wilhelm Windelband on Frege's views on the foundations of mathematics and in the theory of meaning. This historically oriented approach to Frege's thought brought him into sharp conflict with Michael Dummett's \"realist\" interpretation of Frege. Sluga's work in analytic philosophy has been influenced substantially by his engagement with Wittgenstein to whose early and late writings he has devoted a number of studies. His writings on both Frege and Wittgenstein have contributed to the development of the study of the history of analytic philosophy as a field within analytic philosophy.\n\nSince the early 1990s Sluga has become increasingly concerned with political philosophy. In \"Heidegger's Crisis\" he set out to explore the question why philosophers from Plato till the present get so often entangled in dangerous political affairs. Sluga analyzes Heidegger's political engagement by putting it into the larger context of the development of German philosophy in the Nazi period. He seeks to show thereby that many diagnoses of Heidegger's politics are misdirected because of their overly narrow focus on the person and work of Heidegger. He challenges, in particular, the claim that Heidegger's critique of reason is to blame for his political errors by pointing out that committed \"rationalists\" among the German philosophers were prone to the same errors. Sluga's book seeks to show that the willingness to involve themselves politically not only Heidegger, but also of Neo-Kantians like Bruno Bauch, Neo-Fichteans like Max Wundt, and Nietzscheans like Alfred Baeumler was ultimately due to their misconceived belief that they were living through a moment of world-historical crisis in which they were particularly called upon to intervene.\n\nHis book \"Politics and the Search for the Common Good\" seeks to re-think politics in substantially new terms. Sluga distinguishes in it between a long tradition of \"normative political theorizing\" that ranges from Plato and Aristotle through Kant to contemporary writers like John Rawls and a more recent form of \"diagnostic practice\" that emerged in the 19th century and whose first practitioners were Karl Marx and Friedrich Nietzsche. Diagnostic political philosophy, Sluga argues, does not seek to establish political norms through a process of abstract philosophical reasoning but seeks to reach practical conclusions through a careful diagnosis of the political realities. Identifying himself with this strand of political philosophizing, Sluga proceeds to examine the thinking of Carl Schmitt, Hannah Arendt, and Michel Foucault as 20th century exemplars of the diagnostic approach. The book seeks to highlight the promise and the achievements of the diagnostic method as well as its shortcomings so far and its inherent limitations. In doing so, Sluga maps out an understanding of politics that makes use of some of Wittgenstein's methodological concepts. He characterizes politics as a family resemblance phenomenon and argues that the concept of politics does not identify a natural kind. It is therefore also mistaken to assume that there is a single common good at which all politics aims. Similarly, we must forgo the belief that there is a best form of government (as, e.g., democracy). Politics must, rather, be conceived as a continuous search for a common good which can have no final, conclusive answer. It is a sphere of uncertainty in which we operate always with a radically incomplete and unreliable picture of where we are and with only shifting ideas of where we want to go. The institutional forms that this search takes will change over time. Sluga agrees with other diagnostic thinkers that the classical institution of the modern state is now giving way to a new form of political order which he calls \"the corporāte,\" whose challenges are defined by the growth of human populations, rapid technological changes, and an ever more pressing environmental crisis.\n\n\n"}

While few of her letters survive, those that do have been considered a foundational \"monument\" of French literature from the late thirteenth century onwards. Her correspondence, more erudite than it is erotic, is the Latin basis for the \"bildungsroman\" and a model of the classical epistolary genre, and which influenced writers as diverse as Madame de Lafayette, Laclos, Rousseau and Dominique Aury. \n\nHéloïse (variously spelled Helöise, Héloyse, Hélose, Heloisa, Helouisa, Eloise, and Aloysia, among other variations; the name is derived from Proto-Germanic \"*Hailawidis\", \"holy wood\") was a brilliant scholar of Latin, Greek and Hebrew, and had a reputation for intelligence and insight. Abélard writes that she was \"nominatissima\", \"most renowned\" for her gift in reading and writing. Not a great deal is known of her immediate family except that in her letters she implies she is of a lower social standing (probably the Garlande family, who had money and several members in strong positions) than was Abélard, who was originally from the nobility, though he had rejected knighthood to be a philosopher.\n\nWhat is known is that she was the ward of an uncle, a canon in Paris named Fulbert. By some point in her life, she was renowned throughout Western Europe for her scholarship. By the time she became the student of Pierre Abélard (Peter Abelard), who was one of the most popular teachers and philosophers in Paris, she was already a reputed scholar. Educated by Abelard in medicine and other traditional subjects taught in higher education at the time, Héloïse gained quite a reputation as a physician in her role as abbess of Paraclete.\n\nIn his \"Historia Calamitatum\", an autobiographical piece written around 1132, Abélard tells the story of his seduction of Héloïse, whom he met when in 1115 he himself, like Fulbert, became a canon in Paris.\n\nIt is unclear how old Héloïse was at this time. She is described as an \"adolescentula \"(young girl), and so it is often assumed that she was about seventeen at the time and therefore born in 1100–1. More recently, however, Constant Mews has suggested that the age of seventeen is a seventeenth-century fabrication with no supporting contemporary evidence, and that she was probably in her early twenties when she met Abelard. The main support for this is that in a later letter, Peter the Venerable writes to Héloïse that he remembers her when he was a young man and she was a woman. Given that Peter the Venerable was born in 1092, it suggests that Héloïse would have been in her early twenties. Mews proposes that this makes more sense of Abelard's later comment that he sought to seduce Héloïse because she was the most famous woman in France for her studies, because it is unlikely that she would have acquired this reputation or her command of Greek and Hebrew by the age of seventeen. \n\nAbelard tells how he convinced Fulbert to let him move into his house, telling Fulbert that he could not afford to live in his current house while studying, and offering to tutor Héloïse in return. Abelard tells of their subsequent illicit relationship, which they continued until Héloïse became pregnant. Abelard moved Héloïse away from Fulbert and sent her to his own sister in Brittany, where Héloïse gave birth to a boy, whom she called Astrolabe (which is also the name of a navigational device that is used to determine a position on Earth by charting the position of the stars). It is almost unknown what happened to Astrolabe in later life. He is never mentioned by Héloïse in her letters to Abelard, and Abelard's only reference to him outside the \"Historia Calamitatum\" is in the verses of advice addressed to him, and thought to have been written about 1135. His death-day is recorded in the necrology of the Paraclete as 29 or 30 October, but no year is given. He is mentioned only once in a later letter, when Peter the Venerable writes to Héloïse: \"I will gladly do my best to obtain a prebend in one of the great churches for your Astrolabe, who is also ours for your sake\".\n\nAbelard agreed to marry Héloïse to appease Fulbert, although on the condition that the marriage should be kept secret so as not to damage Abélard's career. The reason for wanting the marriage to remain secret is not entirely clear. The most likely explanation is that Abelard must have been in Orders (something on which scholarly opinion is divided), and given that the church was just beginning to forbid marriage to priests and the higher orders of clergy, public marriage would have been a bar to Abelard's advancement in the church. Héloïse was initially reticent to agree to the secret marriage, but was eventually persuaded by Abelard. Héloïse returned from Brittany, and the couple were secretly married in Paris.\n\nFulbert, however, began to spread news of the marriage, in order to punish Abelard for the damage done to his reputation. Héloïse attempted to deny this, but this ongoing situation eventually caused Abélard to place Héloïse for her own safety in the convent of Argenteuil, where Héloïse had been brought up. Fulbert and his friends, however, believed that Abelard had simply found a way of getting rid of Héloïse, by making her a nun. So, to punish Abelard, a group of Fulbert's friends broke into Abelard's room one night and castrated him.\n\nAfter castration, filled with shame at his situation, Abélard became a monk in the Abbey of St Denis in Paris. At the convent in Argenteuil, Héloïse took the habit at Abelard's insistence and much against her own wishes. She eventually became prioress there, but she and the other nuns were turned out in 1129 when the convent was taken over by the Abbey of St Denis. At this point Abélard arranged for them to enter the Oratory of the Paraclete, a deserted building near Nogent-sur-Seine in Champagne which had been established by Abelard himself in 1122 (though he had subsequently moved to become Abbot of Saint-Gildas-de-Rhuys in Lower Brittany). Héloïse became abbess of the new community of nuns there.\n\nAbout this time, correspondence began between the two former lovers. What exists today consists of seven letters (numbered \"Epistolae \"2–8 in Latin volumes, since the \"Historia Calamitatum\" precedes them as \"Epistola\" 1). Four of the letters (\"Epistolae \"2–5) are known as the 'Personal Letters', and contain personal correspondence. The remaining three (\"Epistolae \"6–8) are known as the 'Letters of Direction'.\n\nHéloïse responded, both on the behalf of the Paraclete and herself. In letters which followed, Héloïse expressed dismay at problems that Abélard faced, but scolded him for years of silence following the attack upon him, since Abélard was still wed to Héloïse.\n\nThus began a correspondence both passionate and erudite. Héloïse encouraged Abélard in his philosophical work, and he dedicated his profession of faith to her. Abélard insisted that he had never truly loved her, but only lusted after her, and that their relationship was a sin against God. He then recommended her to turn her attention toward the only one who ever truly loved her, Jesus Christ, and to consecrate herself fully from then on to her religious vocation.\n\nAt this point the tenor of the letters changes. In the 'Letters of Direction', Héloïse writes the fifth letter, declaring that she will no longer speak of the hurt that Abelard has caused her. The sixth is a long letter by Abelard in response to Héloïse's first question in the fifth letter about the origin of nuns. In the long final, seventh letter, Abelard provides a rule for the nuns at the Oratory of the Paraclete, again as requested by Héloïse at the outset of the fifth letter.\n\nThe \"Problemata Heloissae\" (Héloïse's Problems) is a letter from Héloïse to Abélard containing 42 questions about difficult passages in Scripture, interspersed with Abelard's answers to the questions, probably written at the time when she was abbess at the Paraclete.\nBeyond the love story they tell, Héloïse's letters contribute one of the earliest, most radical feminist philosophies of not only the 12th century, but even of today. \n\nHéloïse plainly writes of her disdain for marriage and even feminine life, stating in her first letter, \"I preferred love to wedlock, freedom to a bond.\" \nShe is also later quoted with her famous lines, \"What man, bent on sacred or philosophical thoughts, could endure the crying of children…? And what woman will be able to bear the constant filth and squalor of babies?\"\nShe goes so far as to define marriage as the ultimate form of prostitution, a brash statement for a female in 12th century France. She states, \n\"Assuredly, whomsoever this concupiscence leads into marriage deserves payment rather than affection; for it is evident that she goes after his wealth and not the man, and is willing to prostitute herself, if she can, to a richer.\"\n\nAlthough her exceptional and different \"pure love\" for Peter Abelard provides the contextual backdrop for her brash statements, she is essentially calling marriage contractual prostitution. It is clear that Héloïse meant for this philosophy to be heard because Peter Abelard himself reproduces her arguments in The Story of His Calamities.\n\nHéloïse is accorded an important place in French literary history and in the development of feminist representation. While few of her letters survive, those that do have been considered a foundational \"monument\" of French literature from the late thirteenth century onwards. Her correspondance, more erudite than it is erotic, is the Latin basis for the Bildungsroman and a model of the classical epistolary genre, and which influenced writers as diverse as Madame de Lafayette, Laclos, Rousseau and Dominique Aury. \n\n\n\n\nThe authorship of the writings connected with Héloïse has been a subject of scholarly disagreement for much of their history. \n\nThe most well-established documents, and correspondingly those whose authenticity has been disputed the longest, are the series of letters that begin with Abelard's \"Historia Calamitatum\" (counted as letter 1) and encompass four \"personal letters\" (numbered 2-5) and \"letters of direction\" (numbers 6-8). Most scholars today accept these works as having been written by Héloïse and Abelard themselves, but some continue to disagree. John Benton is the most prominent modern sceptic of these documents. Etienne Gilson and Peter Dronke, on the other hand, have been particularly important proponents the mainstream view that the letters are genuine, both by offering explanations of the problems with the texts themselves and by arguing that the skeptical viewpoint is fueled in large part by its advocates' pre-conceived notions.\n\nMore recently, it has been argued that an anonymous series of letters, the \"Epistolae Duorum Amantium\", were in fact written by Héloïse and Abelard during their initial romance (and, thus, before the later and more broadly known series of letters). This argument has been advanced most forcefully by Constant J. Mews, based on earlier work by Ewad Könsgen. These letters represent a significant expansion to the corpus of surviving writing by Héloïse, and thus open several new directions for further scholarship. However, because the attribution \"is of necessity based on circumstantial rather than on absolute evidence,\" it is not accepted by all scholars.\n\nThere are similar scholarly disputes about other works attributed to Héloïse.\n\nThe great majority of scholars (as well as casual readers) have interpreted the story of Héloïse's relationship with Abelard as a tragic romance. However, in 1989, Mary Ellen Waithe argued that Héloïse was strongly opposed to a sexual relationship with Abelard; according to Waithe, she \"withheld her consent [to sex] and physically and verbally resisted [Abelard's] advances to the best of her ability.\" Thus, in Waithe's view, Abelard's conduct amounted to abuse and rape. Waithe's argument is based primarily on a sentence from the fifth letter, in which Abelard, in the context of arguing to Héloïse that their youthful sexual conduct was sinful and should be repented, not fondly recalled, writes: \"When you objected to [sex] yourself and resisted with all your might, and tried to dissuade me from it, I frequently forced your consent (for after all you were the weaker) by threats and blows.\"\n\nWhile no other scholar has directly responded to Waithe's claim, other academics come to very different conclusions about the nature of Héloïse's relationship with Abelard. Their view is informed in large part by Héloïse's own writings (as opposed to Abelard's letters to her), in which she expresses a much more positive attitude toward their past relationship than does Abelard and does not \"accept that his love for her could die, even by the horrible act of Abelard’s castration.\" A more mainstream interpretation of those parts of Abelard's writing like the sentence Waithe finds so troubling is the one given by David Wulstan: \"Much of what Abelard says in the Historia Calamitatum does not ring true: his arrogation of blame for the cold seduction of his pupil is hardly fortified by the letters of Heloise; this and various supposed violations seem contrived to build a farrago of supposed guilt which he must expiate by his retreat into monasticism and by distancing himself from his former lover.\" In fact, even Waithe herself indicated in a 2009 interview with Karen Warren that she has \"softened the position [she] took earlier\" in light of Mews' subsequent attribution of the \"Epistolae Duorum Amantium\" to Abelard and Héloïse (which Waithe accepts), though she continues to find the passage troubling. According to William Levitan, fellow of the American academy in Rome, \"Readers may be struck by the unattractive figure [the otherwise self praising Abelard] cuts in his own pages...Here the motive [in blaming himself for a cold seduction] is part protective...for Abelard to take all the moral burden on himself and shield, to the extent he can, the now widely respected abbess of the Paraclete--and also in part justificatory--to magnify the crime to the proportions of its punishment.\" Thus Heloise's motive in responding to his letter was to set the record straight, that she had been if anything the instigator of their courtship.\n\nHéloïse's place of burial is uncertain. Abelard's bones were moved to the Oratory of the Paraclete after his death, and after Héloïse's death in 1163/64 her bones were placed alongside his. The bones of the pair were moved more than once afterwards, but they were preserved even through the vicissitudes of the French Revolution, and now are presumed to lie in the well-known tomb in Père Lachaise Cemetery in eastern Paris. The transfer of their remains there in 1817 is considered to have considerably contributed to the popularity of that cemetery, at the time still far outside the built-up area of Paris. By tradition, lovers or lovelorn singles leave letters at the crypt, in tribute to the couple or in hope of finding true love.\n\nThis remains, however, disputed. The Oratory of the Paraclete claims Abélard and Héloïse are buried there and that what exists in Père Lachaise is merely a monument or cenotaph. Others believe that while Abelard is buried in the tomb at Père Lachaise, Heloïse's remains are elsewhere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The book was initially published on January 5, 2010 by Basic Books.\n\nIntellectuals are defined as \"idea workers\" that exercise profound influence on policy makers and public opinion, but are often not directly accountable for the results. \"Intellectuals and Society\" examines the record of these idea workers and the conditions, methods and incentives driving their points of view that, according to Sowell, have often resulted in disaster for societies where intellectuals have been allowed \"undue influence\". \n\nSowell explained undue influence of intellectuals as follows:\n\nSowell argues that intellectuals, whom he defines as people whose occupations deal primarily with ideas (writers, historians, academics, etc.), usually consider themselves as \"anointed\", or as endowed with superior intellect or insight with which to guide the masses and those who have authority over them. Sowell contends that several characteristics mark such intellectuals.\n\nAn intellectual’s work begins and ends with ideas, not the practical application of ideas to real world problems. These purveyors of ideas may be at all points of the political and ideological spectrum, although Sowell generally reserves his sharpest criticisms for those on the left. Certain common patterns in intellectuals, he argues, cut across specific political ideologies. Intellectuals, for example, show a marked preference for third parties, working outside the established power structures and applying what is presumed to be superior insight, to control the resources and decision making processes of the masses and their official leaders. This preference sometimes makes outwardly competing ideologies appear more alike than different. For example both National Socialism and Stalinism attempted to micro-manage the lives of their citizens; both implemented sweeping propaganda campaigns to reframe reality, and both resulted in leadership by an elite outside group. This, apparently, despite the fact that both movements were notoriously anti-intellectual.\n\nThe work of intellectuals is ultimately not subject to external (real world) verifiability, as compared to those engaged in more practical pursuits with readily observable results. An intellectual, for example, can condemn a military operation for \"excessive force\" but has no accountability in regards to the actual outcome of that operation. By contrast, a military commander who fails to deploy sufficient force at the appropriate time can pay with his own life and that of his men. The acclaim given to intellectuals, despite their predictions having failed, is a prime example of the lack of ultimate accountability, Sowell maintains.\n\nIntellectuals usually have thorough knowledge in their areas of expertise. Outside these fields, however, they may be as uninformed as the average person. Too often, Sowell argues, this does not stop them from attempting to influence public opinion in areas where they are not fully qualified. Sowell lists several examples that he argues support his thesis.\n\nSowell states that intellectuals often assume that their specialized knowledge qualifies them to guide others, as do experts in any field of endeavor, practical or otherwise. Sowell argues that what is crucial is their influence on the people who wield decision making power. The presumption of insight often creates a climate that influences the way events are reported by the media, and may make politicians hesitant to take certain approaches to problem-solving. Before World War II, for example, British intellectuals played a large role in the process of creating the opposition to re-armament, which proved to be a deadly mistake.\n\nSowell suggests that intellectuals rely heavily on what he calls \"verbal virtuosity\" (clever phrasing, vague euphemisms, witty quotes, deceptive labeling, name-calling and sneering asides) to substitute for evidence, logic and analysis. Other tactics of \"verbal virtuosity\" include dismissing opposing ideas as simplistic, portraying those making opposing arguments as morally unworthy, invoking \"rights\" which have no legal basis, vague calls for \"change\", reliance on the abstract versus the concrete, and a constant \"filtering of reality\".\n\nThe presumption of wisdom and/or virtue causes intellectuals to personalize situations where contending ideas are involved. This often results in: (a) the demonization of opponents, and (b) personal fulfillment serving as a substitute for debate and evidence. Sowell does not make it clear if intellectuals acquired these traits from politicians, or the other way around.\n\n\n"}

His father, a rōnin, was called and his mother was called . At the age of eight, he was adopted by his maternal grandfather, , a samurai serving under Tokugawa Yorifusa, the \"daimyō\" of Mito, and took from him the surname of Kumazawa.\n\nIn 1634, through the introduction of , a fudai vassal of the Tokugawa, he went to serve as a page under , the daimyo of the Okayama Domain in Bizen Province. He left the Ikeda household for a time, returning to his grandfather's home in Kirihara, Ōmi Province (now Ōmihachiman).\n\nIn 1645, again with the recommendation of the Kyōgoku family, he went to work in the Okayama Domain. As Mitsumasa's thinking leaned towards Yōmeigaku, he made much use of Banzan, valuing him for having studied under Tōju. Banzan worked mainly in the Han school called , whose name means \"Flowerfield Teaching Place\". This school opened in 1641, making it one of the first in Japan. In 1647 Banzan became an aide, with an of 300 koku. In 1649 he went with Mitsumasa to Edo.\n\nIn 1650, he was promoted to be the head of a . In 1651, he drafted the regulations for a , literally \"flower garden club\", a place for the education of common people. This was the initial incarnation of the first school in Japan for educating commoners, which opened in 1670, after Banzan's had left the service of his domain. In 1654, when the Bizen plains were assailed by floods and large-scale famine, he put all his energies into assisting Mitsumasa with relief efforts. Together with , he worked as an aide to Mitsumasa, helping to establish the start of a domain government in Okayama Domain. He worked to produce fully developed strategies on agriculture, including ways of providing relief to small-scale farmers and land engineering projects to manage mountains and rivers. However, his daring reforms of domain government brought him into opposition with the traditionalist . In addition, while Banzan was a follower of Yōmeigaku, the official philosophy of the Edo shogunate was a different form of Neo-Confucianism, . Banzan was criticised by figures such as and . In fact, Banzan was the first in a series of notable neo-Confucianists who would find themselves confronting the evolving critical powers of the Hayashi clan of scholars.\n\nFor this reason, Banzan was left with no choice but to leave the service of Okayama Castle and live in hiding in , Wake District (now Shigeyama, Bizen, Okayama). The name \"Banzan\" derives from the word \"Shigeyama\". The location where his home was is , Okayama-shi.\n\nEventually, in 1657, unable to withstand the pressure from the shogunate and the domain leaders, he left Okayama Domain.\n\nIn 1658, he moved to Kyoto and opened a private juku (school). In 1660, at the request of , he travelled to Tateda, Oita, and gave directions on land management. In 1661, his fame grew, and he again came to be under the surveillance of the shogunate, and was eventually driven out of Kyoto by , aide to the head of the .\n\nIn 1667, he escaped to Yoshinoyama, Yamato Province (now Yoshino, Nara).

In 1683, as Nobuyuki was transferred to Kōriyama Province, he moved to , Yamato Province (now Yamatokōriyama, Nara). In 1683, he received the invitation of the , but refused it. After serving the Okayama District, in his days outside public service, he often wrote, and criticised the policies of the shogunate, particularly , (the policy forbidding those outside the samurai class to arm themselves), and the hereditary system. He was also critical of the government of Okayama Domain.\n\nBanzan's goal was to reform the Japanese government by advocating the adoption of a political system based on merit rather than heredity and the employment of political principles to reinforce the merit system.\n\nIn 1687, he was put under the control of , head of , , and heir to Matsudaira Nobuyuki, and ordered to remain inside <!-- \n"}

He was a philosopher and writer highly acclaimed for his originality, a university professor and a diplomat. He was born on 9 May 1895 in Lancrăm, near Alba Iulia, Austria-Hungary, his father being an Orthodox priest. He later described his early childhood, in the autobiographical \"The Chronicle and the Song of Ages\", as \"under the sign of the incredible absence of the word\".\n\nHis elementary education was in Hungarian at Sebeș (1902–1906), after which he attended the \"Andrei Șaguna\" Highschool in Brașov (1906–1914), under the supervision of a relative, Iosif Blaga (Lucian's father had died when the former was 13), who was the author of the first Romanian treatise on the theory of drama. At the outbreak of the First World War, he began theological studies at Sibiu, where he graduated in 1917. He published his first philosophy article on the Bergson theory of subjective time. From 1917 to 1920, he attended courses at the University of Vienna, where he studied philosophy and obtained his PhD.\n\nUpon returning to Transylvania, now a part of Romania, he contributed to the Romanian press, being the editor of the magazines \"Culture\" in Cluj and \"The Banat\" in Lugoj.\n\nIn 1926, he became involved in Romanian diplomacy, occupying successive posts at Romania's legations in Warsaw, Prague, Lisbon, Bern and Vienna.

{"id": "545839", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=545839", "title": "Madhyamaka", "text": "Madhyamaka\n\nMadhyamaka (\"Middle way\" or \"Centrism\"; , , Tibetan: \"dbu ma pa\") also known as \"Śūnyavāda\" (the emptiness doctrine) and \"Niḥsvabhāvavāda\" (the no \"svabhāva\" doctrine) refers to a tradition of Buddhist philosophy and practice founded by the Indian philosopher Nāgārjuna (c. 150-250 CE). The foundational text of the Mādhyamaka tradition is Nāgārjuna's \"Mūlamadhyamakakārikā\" (Root Verses on the Middle Way). More broadly, Madhyamaka also refers to the ultimate nature of phenomena and the realization of this in meditative equipoise.\n\nMadhyamaka thought had a major influence on the subsequent development of the Mahayana Buddhist tradition. It is the dominant interpretation of Buddhist philosophy in Tibetan Buddhism and has also been influential in East Asian Buddhist thought.\n\nAccording to the classical Madhyamaka thinkers, all phenomena (\"dharmas\") are empty (\"śūnya\") of \"nature,\" a \"substance\" or \"essence\" (\"svabhāva\") which gives them \"solid and independent existence,\" because they are dependently co-arisen. But this \"emptiness\" itself is also \"empty\": it does not have an existence on its own, nor does it refer to a transcendental reality beyond or above phenomenal reality.\n\n\"Madhya\" is a Sanskrit word meaning \"middle\". It is cognate with Latin \"med-iu-s\" and English \"mid\". The \"-ma\" suffix is a superlative, giving \"madhyama\" the meaning of \"mid-most\" or \"medium\". The \"-ka\" suffix is used to form adjectives, thus \"madhyamaka\" means \"middleling\". The \"-ika\" suffix is used to form possessives, with a collective sense, thus \"mādhyamika\" mean \"belonging to the mid-most\" (the \"-ika\" suffix regularly causes a lengthening of the first vowel and elision of the final \"-a\").\n\nIn a Buddhist context these terms refer to the \"middle path\" (\"madhyama pratipada\") between the extremes of annihilationism (\"ucchedavāda\") and eternalism (\"śassatavāda\"), for example:\n\n\"ity etāv ubhāv antāv anupagamya madhyamayā pratipadā tathāgato dharmaṃ deśayati |\" - Kātyāyana Sūtra. \nThus, the Tathāgata teaches the Dharma by a middle path avoiding both these extremes. \n\n\nNote that in both words the stress is on the first syllable.\n\nCentral to Madhyamaka philosophy is \"śūnyatā\", \"emptiness\", and this refers to the central idea that dharmas are empty of \"svabhāva\". This term has been translated variously as essence, intrinsic nature, inherent existence, own being and substance. Furthermore, according to Richard P. Hayes, svabhava can be interpreted as either \"identity\" or as \"causal independence\". Likewise, Westerhoff notes that \"svabhāva\" is a complex concept that has ontological and cognitive aspects. The ontological aspects include \"svabhāva\" as essence, as a property which makes an object what it is, as well as \"svabhāva\" as substance, meaning, as the Madhyamaka thinker Candrakirti defines it, something that does \"not depend on anything else\". It is substance-\"svabhāva\", the objective and independent existence of any object or concept, which Madhyamaka arguments mostly focus on refuting. A common structure which Madhyamaka uses to negate \"svabhāva\" is the \"catuṣkoṭi\" (\"four corners\" or tetralemma), which roughly consists of four alternatives: some proposition is true, it is false, it is both, or it is neither true or false. Some of the major topics discussed by classical Madhyamaka include causality, change, and personal identity.\n\nMadhyamaka's denial of \"svabhāva\" does not mean a nihilistic denial of all things, for in a conventional everyday sense, Madhyamaka does accept that one can speak of \"things\", and yet \"ultimately\" these things are empty of inherent existence. Furthermore, \"emptiness\" itself is also \"empty\": it does not have an existence on its own, nor does it refer to a transcendental reality beyond or above phenomenal reality.\n\n\"Svabhāva\"'s cognitive aspect is merely a superimposition (\"samāropa\") that beings make when they perceive and conceive of things. In this sense then, emptiness does not exist as some kind of primordial reality, but it is simply a corrective to a mistaken conception of how things exist. This idea of \"svabhāva\" that Madhyamaka denies is then not just a conceptual philosophical theory, but it is a cognitive distortion that beings automatically impose on the world, such as when we regard the five aggregates as constituting a single self. Candrakirti compares it to someone who suffers from vitreous floaters that cause the illusion of hairs appearing in their visual field. This cognitive dimension of \"svabhāva\" means that just understanding and assenting to Madhyamaka reasoning is not enough to end the suffering caused by our reification of the world, just like understanding how an optical illusion works does not make it stop functioning. What is required is a kind of cognitive shift (termed \"realization\") in the way the world appears and therefore some kind of practice to lead to this shift. As Candrakirti says:For one on the road of cyclic existence who pursues an inverted view due to ignorance, a mistaken object such as the superimposition (\"samāropa\") on the aggregates appears as real, but it does not appear to one who is close to the view of the real nature of things.Much of Madhyamaka philosophy centers on showing how various essentialist ideas have absurd conclusions through \"reductio ad absurdum\" arguments (known as \"prasanga\" in Sanskrit). Chapter 15 of Nāgārjuna's \"Mūlamadhyamakakārikā\" centers on the words svabhava parabhava bhava and abhava. According to Peter Harvey:\n\nAn important element of Madhyamaka refutation is that the classical Buddhist doctrine of dependent arising (the idea that every phenomena is dependent on other phenomena) cannot be reconciled with \"a conception of self-nature or substance\" and that therefore essence theories are contrary not only to the Buddhist scriptures but to the very ideas of causality and change. Any enduring essential nature would prevent any causal interaction, or any kind of origination. For things would simply always have been, and will always continue to be, without any change. As Nāgārjuna writes in the MMK:\n\nWe state that conditioned origination is emptiness. It is mere designation depending on something, and it is the middle path. (24.18)\n\nSince nothing has arisen without depending on something, there is nothing that is not empty. (24.19) \n\nBeginning with Nāgārjuna, Madhyamaka discerns two levels of truth, conventional truth (everyday commonsense reality) and ultimate truth (emptiness). Ultimately, Madhyamaka argues that all phenomena are empty of \"svabhava\" and only exist in dependence on other causes, conditions and concepts. Conventionally, Madhyamaka holds that beings do perceive concrete objects which they are aware of empirically. In Madhyamaka this phenomenal world is the limited truth - \"samvrti satya,\" which literally means “to completely cover, conceal, or obscure” and arises due to ignorance. This seeming reality does not \"really\" exist as the highest truth realized by wisdom which is \"paramartha satya\" (\"parama\" is literally “supreme or ultimate,” and \"artha\" means “object, purpose, or actuality”)\",\" and yet it has a kind of conventional reality which has its uses for reaching liberation. This limited truth includes everything, including the Buddha himself, the teachings (Dharma), liberation and even Nāgārjuna's own arguments. This two truth schema which did not deny the importance of convention allowed Nāgārjuna to defend himself against charges of nihilism, understanding both correctly meant seeing the middle way:\"Without relying upon convention, the ultimate fruit is not taught. Without understanding the ultimate, nirvana is not attained.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "21032", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21032", "title": "Mohism", "text": "Mohism\n\nMohism or Moism () was an ancient Chinese philosophy of logic, rational thought and science developed by the academic scholars who studied under the ancient Chinese philosopher Mozi (c. 470 BC – c. 391 BC) and embodied in an eponymous book: the \"Mozi\". It evolved at about the same time as Confucianism, Taoism and Legalism, and was one of the four main philosophic schools from around 770–221 BC (during the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods). During that time, Mohism was seen as a major rival to Confucianism. Although its influence endured, Mohism all but disappeared as an independent school of thought.\n\nMohism is best known for the concepts of \"impartial care\" (). This is often translated and popularized as \"Universal Love\", which is misleading as Mozi believed that the essential problem of human ethics was an excess of partiality in compassion, not a deficit in compassion as such. His aim was to re-evaluate behaviour, not emotions or attitudes.\n\nThe Mohists formed a highly structured political organization that tried to realize the ideas they preached, the writings of Mozi. Like Confucians, they hired out their services not only for gain, but also in order to realize their own ethical ideals. This political structure consisted of a network of local units in all the major kingdoms of China at the time, made up of elements from both the scholarly and working classes. Each unit was led by a \"juzi\" (literally, \"chisel\"—an image from craft making). Within the unit, a frugal and ascetic lifestyle was enforced. Each \"juzi\" would appoint his own successor. Mohists developed the sciences of fortification and statecraft, and wrote treatises on government, ranging in topic from efficient agricultural production to the laws of inheritance. They were often hired by the many warring kingdoms as advisers to the state. In this way, they were similar to the other wandering philosophers and knights-errant of the period.\n\nMohism promotes a philosophy of impartial caring; that is, a person should care equally for all other individuals, regardless of their actual relationship to him or her. The expression of this indiscriminate caring is what makes man a righteous being in Mohist thought. This advocacy of impartiality was a target of attack by the other Chinese philosophical schools, most notably the Confucians, who believed that while love should be unconditional, it should not be indiscriminate. For example, children should hold a greater love for their parents than for random strangers.\n\nMozi is known for his insistence that all people are equally deserving of receiving material benefit and being protected from physical harm. In Mohism, morality is defined not by tradition and ritual, but rather by a constant moral guide that parallels utilitarianism. Tradition varies from culture to culture, and human beings need an extra-traditional guide to identify which traditions are morally acceptable. The moral guide must then promote and encourage social behaviours that maximize the general utility of all the people in that society. \n\nThe concept of \"Ai\" (愛) was developed by the Chinese philosopher Mozi in the 4th century BC in reaction to Confucianism's benevolent love. Mozi tried to replace what he considered to be the long-entrenched Chinese over-attachment to family and clan structures with the concept of \"universal love\" (jiān'ài, 兼愛). In this, he argued directly against Confucians who believed that it was natural and correct for people to care about different people in different degrees. Mozi, by contrast, believed people in principle should care for all people equally. Mohism stressed that rather than adopting different attitudes towards different people, love should be unconditional and offered to everyone without regard to reciprocation, not just to friends, family and other Confucian relations. Later in Chinese Buddhism, the term \"Ai\" (愛) was adopted to refer to a passionate caring love and was considered a fundamental desire. In Buddhism, \"Ai\" was seen as capable of being either selfish or selfless, the latter being a key element towards enlightenment.\n\nUnlike hedonistic utilitarianism, which views pleasure as a moral good, \"the basic goods in Mohist consequentialist thinking are... order, material wealth, and increase in population\". During Mozi's era, war and famines were common, and population growth was seen as a moral necessity for a harmonious society. The \"material wealth\" of Mohist consequentialism refers to basic needs like shelter and clothing. Stanford sinologist David Shepherd Nivison, in \"The Cambridge History of Ancient China\", writes that the moral goods of Mohism \"are interrelated: more basic wealth, then more reproduction; more people, then more production and wealth... if people have plenty, they would be good, filial, kind, and so on unproblematically\". In contrast to Bentham's views, state consequentialism is not utilitarian because it is not hedonistic. The importance of outcomes that are good for the state outweigh the importance of individual pleasure and pain.\n\nMozi posited that, when society functions as an organized organism, the wastes and inefficiencies found in the natural state (without organization) are reduced. He believed that conflicts are born from the absence of moral uniformity found in human cultures in the natural state, i.e. the absence of the definition of what is right (是 shì) and what is wrong (非 fēi). According to Mozi, we must therefore choose leaders who will surround themselves with righteous followers, who will then create the hierarchy that harmonizes Shi/Fei. In that sense, the government becomes an authoritative and automated tool. Assuming that the leaders in the social hierarchy are perfectly conformed to the ruler, who is perfectly submissive to Heaven, conformity in speech and behaviour is expected of all people. There is no freedom of speech in this model. However, the potentially repressive element is countered by compulsory communication between the subjects and their leaders. Subjects are required to report all things good or bad to their rulers. Mohism is opposed to any form of aggression, especially war between states. It is, however, permissible for a state to use force in legitimate defense.\n\nMozi believed that the norm of handing out important government responsibilities to one's relatives regardless of capabilities, as opposed to those who were best equipped to handle these responsibilities, restricted social mobility. Mozi taught that as long as a person was qualified for a task, he should keep his position, regardless of blood relations. If an officer were incapable, even if he were a close relative of the ruler, he ought to be demoted, even if it meant poverty.\n\nA ruler should be in close proximity to talented people, treasuring talents and seeking their counsel frequently. Without discovering and understanding talents within the country, the country will be destroyed. History unfortunately saw many people who were murdered, not because of their frailties, but rather because of their strengths. A good bow is difficult to pull, but it shoots high. A good horse is difficult to ride, but it can carry weight and travel far. Talented people are difficult to manage, but they can bring respect to their rulers.\n\nLaw and order was an important aspect of Mozi's philosophy. He compared the carpenter, who uses standard tools to do his work, with the ruler, who might not have \"any\" standards by which to rule at all. The carpenter is always better off when depending on his standard tools, rather than on his emotions. Ironically, as his decisions affect the fate of an entire nation, it is even more important that a ruler maintains a set of standards, and yet he has none. These standards cannot originate from man, since no man is perfect; the only standards that a ruler uses have to originate from Heaven, since only Heaven is perfect. That law of Heaven is Love.\n\nIn a perfect governmental structure where the ruler loves all people benevolently, and officials are selected according to meritocracy, the people should have unity in belief and in speech. His original purpose in this teaching was to unite people and avoid sectarianism. However, in a situation of corruption and tyranny, this teaching might be misused as a tool for oppression.\n\nShould the ruler be unrighteous, seven disasters would result for that nation. These seven disasters are:\nA country facing these seven disasters will be destroyed easily by the enemy.\n\nThe measure of a country's wealth in Mohism is a matter of sufficient provision and a large population. Thriftiness is believed to be key to this end. With contentment with that which suffices, men will be free from excessive labour, long-term war and poverty from income gap disparity. This will enable birth rate to increase. Mozi also encourages early marriage.\n\nRulers of the period often ritually assigned punishments and rewards to their subjects in spiritually important places to garner the attention of these spirits and ensure that justice was done. The respect of these spirits was deemed so important that prehistoric Chinese ancestors had left their instructions on bamboo, plates and stones to ensure the continual obedience of their future descendants to the dictates of heaven. In Mozi's teachings, sacrifices of bulls and rams were mentioned during appointed times during the spring and autumn seasons. Spirits were described to be the preexisting primal spirits of nature, or the souls of humans who had died.\n\nThe Mohists polemicized against elaborate funeral ceremonies and other wasteful rituals, and called for austerity in life and in governance, but did not deem spiritual sacrifices wasteful. Using historical records, Mohists argued that the spirits of innocent men wrongfully murdered had appeared before to enact their vengeance. Spirits had also been recorded to have appeared to carry out other acts of justice. Mohists believed in heaven as a divine force (天 \"Tian\"), the celestial bureaucracy and spirits which knew about the immoral acts of man and punished them, encouraging moral righteousness, and were wary of some of the more atheistic thinkers of the time, such as Han Fei. Due to the vague nature of the records, there is a possibility that the Mohist scribes themselves may not have been clear about this subject.\n\nMozi disagrees with the fatalistic mindset of people, accusing the mindset of bringing about poverty and suffering. To argue against this attitude, Mozi used three criteria (\"San Biao\") to assess the correctness of views. These were:\nIn summary, fatalism, the belief that all outcomes are predestined or fated to occur, is an irresponsible belief espoused by those who refuse to acknowledge that their own sinfulness has caused the hardships of their lives. Prosperity or poverty are directly correlated with either virtue or sinfulness, respectively; not fate. Mozi calls fatalism a heresy which needs to be destroyed.\n\nBy the time of Mozi, Chinese rulers and the wealthier citizens already had the practice of extravagant burial rituals. Much wealth was buried with the dead, and ritualistic mourning could be as extreme as walking on a stick hunchback for three years in a posture of mourning. During such lengthy funerals, people are not able to attend to agriculture or care for their families, leading to poverty. Mozi spoke against such long and lavish funerals and also argued that this would even create resentment among the living.\n\nMozi views aesthetics as nearly useless. Unlike Confucius, he holds a distinctive repulsion to any development in ritual music and the fine arts. Mozi takes some whole chapters named \"Against Music\" (非樂) to discuss this. Though he mentions that he does enjoy and recognize what is pleasant, he sees them of no utilization in terms of governing, or of the benefit of common people. Instead, since development of music involves man's power, it reduces production of food; furthermore, appreciation of music results in less time for administrative works. This overdevelopment eventually results in shortage of food, as well as anarchy. This is because manpower will be diverted from agriculture and other fundamental works towards ostentations. Civilians will eventually imitate the ruler's lusts, making the situation worse. Mozi probably advocated this idea in response to the fact that during the Warring States period, the Zhou king and the aristocrats spent countless time in the development of delicate music while ordinary peasants could hardly meet their subsistence needs. To Mozi, bare necessities are sufficient; resources should be directed to benefit man.\n\nOne of the schools of Mohism that has received some attention is the Logicians school, which was interested in resolving logical puzzles. Not much survives from the writings of this school, since problems of logic were deemed trivial by most subsequent Chinese philosophers. Historians such as Joseph Needham have seen this group as developing a precursor philosophy of science that was never fully developed, but others believe that recognizing the Logicians as proto-scientists reveals too much of a modern bias.\n\nThe Mohist canon of the \"Mo Jing\" described various aspects of many fields associated with physical science, and provided a small wealth of information on mathematics as well. It provided an 'atomic' definition of the geometric point, stating that a line is separated into parts, and the part which has no remaining parts (i.e. cannot be divided into smaller parts) and thus the extreme end of a line is a point. Much like Euclid's first and third definitions and Plato's 'beginning of a line', the \"Mo Jing\" stated that \"a point may stand at the end (of a line) or at its beginning like a head-presentation in childbirth. (As to its invisibility) there is nothing similar to it.\" Similar to the atomists of Democritus, the \"Mo Jing\" stated that a point is the smallest unit, and cannot be cut in half, since 'nothing' cannot be halved. It stated that two lines of equal length will always finish at the same place, while providing definitions for the \"comparison of lengths\" and for \"parallels\", along with principles of space and bounded space. It also described the fact that planes without the quality of thickness cannot be piled up since they cannot mutually touch. The book provided definitions for circumference, diameter, and radius, along with the definition of volume.\n\nOne consequence of Mohist understanding of mathematics and the physical sciences, combined with their anti-militarist philosophy and skills as artisans, was that they became the pre-eminent siege-defense engineers during the period prior to the Qin unification of China. They believed in aiding the defensive warfare of smaller Chinese states against the hostile offensive warfare of larger domineering states.\n\nThe Mohist beliefs were popular for a time in China, and Mohist followers were employed for their ability as negotiators and as defense engineers. This component of Mohism is dramatized in the story of Gongshu, recorded in the Mohist canon. Mozi travels 10 days and nights when he hears that Gongshu Pan has built machines for the king of Chu to use in an invasion of the smaller state of Song. Upon arriving in Chu, Mozi makes a wall out of his belt and sticks to represent machines, and shows Gongshu Pan that he can defend Song against any offensive strategy Chu might use. Mozi then announces that three hundred of his disciples are already on the walls of Song, ready to defend against Chu. The king cancels the invasion.\n\nWith the unification of China under the Qin, China was no longer divided into various states constantly fighting each other: where previously the Mohists proved to be an asset when defending a city against an external threat, without wars, and in particular siege wars, there was no more need for their skills. The \"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\" suggests, in addition to the decline of siege warfare, \"... the major factor is probably that as a social and philosophical movement, Mohism gradually collapsed into irrelevance. By the middle of the former Han dynasty, the more appealing aspects of Mohist thought were all shared with rival schools.\n\nTheir core ethical doctrines had largely been absorbed into Confucianism, though in a modified and unsystematic form. Key features of their political philosophy were probably shared with most other political thinkers, and their trademark opposition to warfare had been rendered effectively redundant by unification. The philosophy of language, epistemology, metaphysics, and science of the later Mohist Canons were recorded in difficult, dense texts that would have been nearly unintelligible to most readers (and that in any case quickly became corrupt). What remained as distinctively Mohist was a package of harsh, unappealing economic and cultural views, such as their obsession with parsimony and their rejection of music and ritual. Compared with the classical learning and rituals of the Confucians, the speculative metaphysics of Yin-Yang thinkers, and the romantic nature mysticism and literary sophistication of the Daoists, Mohism offered little to attract adherents, especially politically powerful ones.\"\n\nJin Guantao, a professor of the Institute of Chinese Studies at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Fan Hongye, a research fellow with the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Science Policy and Managerial Science, and Liu Qingfeng, a professor of the Institute of Chinese Culture at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, have argued that without the influence of proto-scientific precepts in the ancient philosophy of Mohism, Chinese science lacked a definitive structure:\n\nFrom the middle and late Eastern Han to the early Wei and Jin dynasties, the net growth of ancient Chinese science and technology experienced a peak (second only to that of the Northern Song dynasty)... Han studies of the Confucian classics, which for a long time had hindered the socialization of science, were declining. If Mohism, rich in scientific thought, had rapidly grown and strengthened, the situation might have been very favorable to the development of a scientific structure. However, this did not happen because the seeds of the primitive structure of science were never formed. During the late Eastern Han, disastrous upheavals again occurred in the process of social transformation, leading to the greatest social disorder in Chinese history. One can imagine the effect of this calamity on science.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5306494", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5306494", "title": "Old Texts", "text": "Old Texts\n\nIn Chinese philology, the Old Texts () refer to some versions of the Five Classics discovered during the Han Dynasty, written in archaic characters and supposedly produced before the burning of the books, as opposed to the Modern Texts or New Texts (今文經) in the new orthography.\n\nThe last half of the 2nd century BC was the period when new versions of the Confucian classics were discovered. Most of these new versions were found in the walls of Confucius’s old residence in Qufu, the old capital of State of Lu, when Prince Liu Yu (d. 127 BC) attempted to expand it into a palace upon taking the throne there. In the course of taking the old wall apart, the restorers found old versions of the \"Classic of History\", \"Rites of Zhou\", \"Yili\", \"Analects of Confucius\" and \"Classic of Filial Piety\", all written in the old orthography used prior to the reforms of the Clerical script. Hence they were called “old texts”. These newly discovered editions had an effect on later Confucianism.\n\n\nBy the time of 1st century, a new controversy had begun between these two texts. The \"new texts\" are those that had been transliterated into the new orthography back in the beginning of 2nd century BC, either from oral transmissions or from texts that had survived the Qin Dynasty’s burning of the books or were rescued by the Han Dynasty in the provinces. Surviving scholars in the direct line of transmission of these books got hold of surviving copies and transliterated them into the new orthography.\n\nThe \"old texts\" were the ones that off and on since the late 2nd and during the 1st century BC had turned up, some discovered in the walls of Confucius’s residence, or in Warring States period graves. They were called the “old texts” because they were written in the pre-Qin writing. The discoverers of the \"old texts\", such as Liu Xin, claimed that all existing texts suffered from an interrupted pedigree, which was rectified by the newly discovered texts. \"New text\" followers claim the \"old texts\" are forgeries that lack a line of transmission.\n\nIn reality, the burning of the books probably did little more than symbolically burn a few copies of the Confucian books conveniently at hand in the capital. Many other copies survived elsewhere, and these were available for copying into the new orthographic standard set by Qin and its clerical script successor which evolved under Han Dynasty. It was the change in orthography which divided the Warring States and early imperial period textual traditions, and in this respect the newly discovered texts were no different from those used as the basis for the \"new text\" transcriptions soon after the fall of Qin Dynasty.\n\nThe \"new texts\" portray Confucius as a prophet or \"uncrowned king\" that should have received the Mandate of Heaven. He could perform miracles and wrote the Five Classics himself. The New Text school, founded by Dong Zhongshu, believed the texts were sacred and carried hidden clues to the future that they tried to decode. They were also interested in apocryphal writings that were obtuse and esoteric. They believed historical events were caused by cosmic forces beyond the control of man. They also believed officials should disobey the sovereign's decree if it will harm the state or dynasty. To betray the sovereign for the sovereign's own sake will keep the Mandate of Heaven in the dynasty's hand and is an act of greater loyalty.\n\nThe Old Text school was rationalistic. They rejected apocrypha and believed that the classics were only edited by Confucius. They believed history was caused by human actions and viewed the Son of Heaven (the emperor of China) as the axis mundi whose will was absolute. Officials may advise but not disobey as it is the emperor who is ultimately responsible for keeping or losing the Mandate of Heaven.\n\nThe “old texts” had a peculiarly archaist bent. They emphasized the sage-like as opposed to the prophet-like characteristics of Confucius, thereby making him look more like the earlier sages who founded and ruled Zhou Dynasty or even the still more archaic states which preceded it. And yet, these archaic sage-kings are shown ruling China with a bureaucratic apparatus peculiarly like that available to Han Dynasty rulers, and hence by methods which strikingly echoed those of putative enemies of Wang Mang, the modernists. The Former Han (206 BC-AD 8), prior to Wang Mang, had favored New Text. When Wang seized power, he declared the Old Texts to be the state orthodoxy. After the Han restoration, the New Texts became orthodox again.\n\nLater Han (AD 25-220) scholars began favoring the Old Text versions. Old Texter Zheng Xuan synthesized the teachings of both schools. While he was very influential, he was unable to unseat the New Text orthodoxy though the issue became moot when both schools disappeared after the collapse of the Han. Zheng became the mainstream source of interpretation until the appearance of Neo-Confucianism in the Tang and Song dynasties. The controversy was forgotten until it was rediscovered during the Qing dynasty by Han Learning scholars.\n\nSignificance of the old/new text controversy is a debate topic in the modern sinology. Martin Kern claims that the issue itself was an artificial projection of the mid-Han problematic onto the early Han realities. According to him, the issue should be seen in light of the transition from the self-referential ritual tradition (centered on the oral and multimedia practices) to the literary canon.\n\n\n"}

His areas of interest were the history of philosophy, philosophical logic, ethics, philosophy of religion, and the theory of identity.\n\nPeter Geach was born in London on 29 March 1916 to George Hender Geach, a professor of philosophy in Lahore who had studied philosophy at Cambridge, in the days of Russell, Moore, and Mactaggart, and Eleonora Adolfina Sgonina, a poet, and spent his earliest years in Cardiff. He attended Llandaff Cathedral School and Clifton College. He received instruction in logic and philosophy from his father who, as a member of the Indian Educational Service, had been professor of philosophy at Lahore and later principal of a teacher training college in Peshawar. His parents' marriage was unhappy and quickly broke up. Until around the age of four, he lived with his maternal grandparents in Cardiff, after which time he was raised by a guardian, and then sent first to Llandaff Cathedral School and then to Clifton College. Geach never saw his mother again after childhood.\n\nIn 1934 Geach won a scholarship to Balliol College, Oxford, graduating in 1938 with a First in Literae Humaniores.\n\nGeach spent a year (1938–39) as a Gladstone Research Student, based at St Deiniol's Library, Hawarden. Following the end of World War II in 1945, he undertook further research at Cambridge.\n\nIn 1951, Geach was appointed to his first substantive academic post, as assistant lecturer at the University of Birmingham, going on to become Reader in Logic. In 1966 he was appointed Professor of Logic in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Leeds. Geach retired from his chair in 1981 with the title Emeritus Professor of Logic. He also held Visiting Professorships at the universities of Cornell, Chicago, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Warsaw.\n\nGeach was elected a Fellow of the British Academy (FBA) in 1965. He was elected an Honorary Fellow of Balliol College in 1979.\n\nHe was awarded the papal cross \"Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice\" by the Holy See for his philosophical work.\n\nHis early work includes the classic texts \"Mental Acts\" and \"Reference and Generality\", the latter defending an essentially modern conception of reference against medieval theories of supposition. His Catholic perspective was integral to his philosophy. He was perhaps the founder of Analytical Thomism (though the current of thought running through his and Elizabeth Anscombe's work to the present day was only ostensibly so named forty years later by John Haldane), the aim of which is to synthesise Thomistic and Analytic approaches. Geach was a student and an early follower of Ludwig Wittgenstein whilst at Cambridge University.\n\nGeach defends the Thomistic position that human beings are essentially rational animals, each one miraculously created. He dismissed Darwinistic attempts to regard reason as inessential to humanity, as \"mere sophistry, laughable, or pitiable.\" He repudiated any capacity for language in animals as mere \"association of manual signs with things or performances.\" \n\nGeach dismissed both pragmatic and epistemic conceptions of truth, commending a version of the correspondence theory proposed by Aquinas. He argues that there is one reality rooted in God himself, who is the ultimate truthmaker. God, according to Geach, \"is\" truth. While they lived, he saw W. V. Quine and Arthur Prior as his allies, in that they held three truths: that there are no non-existent beings; that a proposition can occur in discourse without being there asserted; and that the sense of a term does not depend on the truth of the proposition in which it occurs. He invented the famous ethical example of the stuck potholer, when arguing against the idea that it might be right to kill a child to save its mother. Jenny Teichman, fellow of New Hall, Cambridge, has characterised Geach's philosophical style as \"deliberately outrageous\".\n\nHis wife and occasional collaborator was the philosopher and Wittgenstein scholar Elizabeth Anscombe. Both converts to Roman Catholicism, they married in 1941 and had seven children. They co-authored the 1961 book \"Three Philosophers\", with Anscombe contributing a section on Aristotle and Geach one each on Aquinas and Gottlob Frege. For a quarter century they were leading figures in the Philosophical Enquiry Group, an annual confluence of Catholic philosophers held at Spode House in Staffordshire that was established by Father Columba Ryan in 1954.\n\nPeter Geach died early in the morning on 21 December 2013 at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge and is buried in what is now the Ascension Parish Burial Ground.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "277983", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=277983", "title": "Pragmaticism", "text": "Pragmaticism\n\n\"Pragmaticism\" is a term used by Charles Sanders Peirce for his pragmatic philosophy starting in 1905, in order to distance himself and it from pragmatism, the original name, which had been used in a manner he did not approve of in the \"literary journals\". Peirce in 1905 announced his coinage \"pragmaticism\", saying that it was \"ugly enough to be safe from kidnappers\" (\"Collected Papers\" (CP) 5.414). Today, outside of philosophy, \"pragmatism\" is often taken to refer to a compromise of aims or principles, even a ruthless search for mercenary advantage. Peirce gave other or more specific reasons for the distinction in a surviving draft letter that year and in later writings. Peirce's pragmatism, that is, pragmaticism, differed in Peirce's view from other pragmatisms by its commitments to the spirit of strict logic, the immutability of truth, the reality of infinity, and the difference between (1) actively willing to control thought, to doubt, to weigh reasons, and (2) willing not to exert the will, willing to believe. In his view his pragmatism is, strictly speaking, not itself a whole philosophy, but instead a general method for the clarification of ideas. He first publicly formulated his pragmatism as an aspect of scientific logic along with principles of statistics and modes of inference in his \"Illustrations of the Logic of Science\" series of articles in 1877-8.\n\nWhether one chooses to call it \"pragmatism\" or \"pragmaticism\"—and Peirce himself was not always consistent about it even after the notorious renaming—his conception of pragmatic philosophy is based on one or another version of the so-called \"pragmatic maxim\". Here is one of his more emphatic statements of it:\n\nPragmaticism was originally enounced in the form of a maxim, as follows: Consider what effects, that might \"conceivably\" have practical bearings, you \"conceive\" the objects of your \"conception\" to have. Then, your \"conception\" of those effects is the whole of your \"conception\" of the object (CP 5.438).\n\nIn the 1909 \"Century Dictionary Supplement\", the entry for pragmaticism, written, it now appears, by John Dewey, was\n\npragmaticism (prag-mat′ i-sizm), \"n.\" [\"pragmatic\" + \"ism\".] A special and limited form of pragmatism, in which the pragmatism is restricted to the determining of the meaning of concepts (particularly of philosophic concepts) by consideration of the experimental differences in the conduct of life which would conceivably result from the affirmation or denial of the meaning in question. He [the writer] framed the theory that a conception, that is, the rational purport of a word or other expression, lies exclusively in its conceivable bearing upon the conduct of life. . . . To serve the precise purpose of expressing the original definition, he begs to announce the birth of the word \"\"pragmaticism\".\"      \"C. S. Peirce\", in The Monist, April, 1905, p. 166. \n\nPragmatism as a philosophical movement originated in 1872 in discussions in The Metaphysical Club among Peirce, William James, Chauncey Wright, John Fiske, Francis Ellingwood Abbot, Nicholas St. John Green, and Joseph Bangs Warner. The first use in print of the name \"pragmatism\" appears to have been in 1898 by James, who credited Peirce with having coined the name during the early 1870s.\n\nJames, among others, regarded Peirce's 1877-8 \"Illustrations of the Logic of Science\" series, especially \"\" (1878) as pragmatism's foundation. Peirce (CP 5.11-12), like James saw pragmatism as embodying familiar attitudes, in philosophy and elsewhere, elaborated into a new deliberate method of thinking and resolving dilemmas. Peirce differed from James and the early John Dewey, in some of their tangential enthusiasms, in being decidedly more rationalistic and realistic, in several senses of those terms, throughout the preponderance of his own philosophical moods.\n\nIn a 1906 manuscript, Peirce wrote that, in the Metaphysical Club decades earlier, Nicholas St. John Greenoften urged the importance of applying Bain's definition of belief, as \"that upon which a man is prepared to act.\" From this definition, pragmatism is scarce more than a corollary; so that I am disposed to think of him as the grandfather of pragmatism. James and Peirce, inspired by crucial links among belief, conduct, and disposition, agreed with Green. John Shook has said, \"Chauncey Wright also deserves considerable credit, for as both Peirce and James recall, it was Wright who demanded a phenomenalist and fallibilist empiricism as a vital alternative to rationalistic speculation.\"\n\nPragmatism is regarded as a distinctively American philosophy. As advocated by James, John Dewey, F. C. S. Schiller, George Herbert Mead, and others, it has proved durable and popular. But Peirce did not seize on this fact to enhance his reputation, and even coined the word \"pragmaticism\" to distinguish his philosophical position.\n\nPragmatism starts with the idea that belief is that upon which one is prepared to act. Peirce's pragmatism is about conceptions of objects. His pragmatism is a method for fruitfully sorting out conceptual confusions caused, for example, by distinctions that make (sometimes needful) formal yet not practical differences. It equates any conception of an object with a conception of that object's effects to a general extent of those conceived effects' conceivable implications for informed practice. Those conceivable practical implications are the conception's meaning. The meaning is the consequent form of conduct or practice that would be implied by accepting the conception as true. Peirce's pragmaticism, in the strict sense, is about the conceptual elucidation of conceptions into such meanings — about how to make our ideas clear. Making them true, in the sense of proving and bearing them out in fruitful practice, goes beyond that. A conception's truth is its correspondence to the real, to that which would be found by investigation taken far enough. A conception's actual confirmation (if it occurs) is neither its meaning nor its truth \"per se\", but an actual upshot.\n\nIn \"\", Peirce discusses three grades of clearness of conception: <br>\n\nBy way of example of how to clarify conceptions, he addressed conceptions about truth and the real as questions of the presuppositions of reasoning in general. To reason is to presuppose (and at least to hope), as a principle of the reasoner's self-regulation, that the truth is independent of our vagaries of opinion and is discoverable. In clearness's second grade (the \"nominal\" grade), he defines truth as the correspondence of a sign (in particular, a proposition) to its object, and the real as the object (be it a possibility or quality, or an actuality or brute fact, or a necessity or norm or law) to which a true sign corresponds, such that truth and the real are independent of that which you or I or any actual, definite community of inquirers think. After that needful but confined step, next in clearness's third grade (the pragmatic, practice-oriented grade) he defines truth — not as actual consensus, such that to inquire would be to poll the experts — but as that which \"would\" be reached, sooner or later but still inevitably, by research taken far enough, such that the real does depend on that ideal final opinion—a dependence to which he appeals in theoretical arguments elsewhere, for instance for the long-run validity of the rule of induction. (Peirce held that one cannot have absolute theoretical assurance of having actually reached the truth, and later said that the confession of inaccuracy and one-sidedness is an essential ingredient of a true abstract statement.) Peirce argues that even to argue against the independence and discoverability of truth and the real is to presuppose that there is, about that very question under argument, a truth with just such independence and discoverability. For more on Peirce's theory of truth, see the Peirce section in Pragmatic theory of truth. Peirce's discussions and definitions of truth have influenced several epistemic truth theorists and been used as foil for deflationary and correspondence theories of truth.\n\nPeirce said that a conception's meaning consists in \"all general modes of rational conduct\" implied by \"acceptance\" of the conception—that is, if one were to accept, first of all, the conception as true, then what could one conceive to be consequent general modes of rational conduct by all who accept the conception as true?—the whole of such consequent general modes is the whole meaning. His pragmatism, since a conception is general, does not equate a conception's meaning, its intellectual purport, with any definite set of actual consequences or upshots corroborating or undermining the conception or its worth, nor does it equate its meaning, much less its truth (if it is true), with the conceived or actual benefit or cost of the conception itself, like a meme (or, say, propaganda), outside the perspective of its being true in what it purports. If it is true, its truth is not transitory but instead immutable and independent of actual trends of opinion. His pragmatism also bears no resemblance to \"vulgar\" pragmatism, which misleadingly connotes a ruthless and Machiavellian search for mercenary or political advantage. Rather, Peirce's pragmatic maxim is the heart of his pragmatism as a method of experimentational mental reflection arriving at conceptions in terms of conceivable confirmatory and disconfirmatory circumstances—a method hospitable to the generation of explanatory hypotheses, and conducive to the employment and improvement of verification to test the truth of putative knowledge.\n\nPeirce's pragmatism, as method and theory of \"definitions and the clearness of ideas\", is a department within his theory of inquiry, which he variously called \"Methodeutic\" and \"Philosophical or Speculative Rhetoric\". He applied his pragmatism as a method throughout his work.\n\nPeirce called his pragmatism \"the logic of abduction\", that is, the logic of inference to explanatory hypotheses. As a method conducive to hypotheses as well as predictions and testing, pragmatism leads beyond the usual duo of foundational alternatives, namely:\n\nHis approach is distinct from foundationalism, empiricist or otherwise, as well as from coherentism, by the following three dimensions:\n\nA theory that proves itself more successful than its rivals in predicting and controlling our world is said to be nearer the truth. This is an operational notion of truth employed by scientists.\n\nIn \"The Fixation of Belief\", Peirce characterized inquiry in general not as the pursuit of truth \"per se\" but as the struggle to settle disturbances or conflicts of belief, irritating, inhibitory doubts, belief being that on which one is willing to act. That let Peirce frame scientific inquiry not only as a special kind of inquiry in a broader spectrum, but also, like inquiry generally, as based on actual doubts, not mere verbal doubts (such as hyperbolic doubt), which he held to be fruitless, and it let him also frame it, by the same stroke, as requiring that proof rest on propositions free from actual doubt, rather than on ultimate and absolutely indubitable propositions. He outlined four methods, ordered from least to most successful in achieving a secure fixation of belief:\n\nPeirce held that, in practical affairs, slow and stumbling ratiocination is often dangerously inferior to instinct and traditional sentiment, and that the scientific method is best suited to theoretical research, which in turn should not be bound to the other methods and to practical ends; reason's \"first rule\" is that, in order to learn, one must desire to learn and, as a corollary, must not block the way of inquiry. What recommends the scientific method of inquiry above all others is that it is deliberately designed to arrive, eventually, at the ultimately most secure beliefs, upon which the most successful practices can eventually be based. Starting from the idea that people seek not truth \"per se\" but instead to subdue irritating, inhibitory doubt, Peirce shows how, through the struggle, some can come to submit to truth, seek as truth the guidance of potential practice correctly to its given goal, and wed themselves to the scientific method.\n\n It is sometimes stated that James' and other philosophers' use of the word \"pragmatism\" so dismayed Peirce that he renamed his own variant \"pragmaticism\". Susan Haack has disagreed, pointing out the context in which Peirce publicly introduced the latter term in 1905. Haack's excerpt of Peirce begins below at the words \"But at present...,\" and continues with some ellipses. The fuller excerpt below supports her case further:\nThen, in a surviving draft letter to Calderoni, dated by the CP editors as \"circa\" that same year 1905, Peirce said regarding his above-quoted discussion:\n\nIndeed in the \"Monist\" article Peirce had said that the coinage \"pragmaticism\" was intended \"to serve the precise purpose of expressing the original definition\". Of course this does not mean that Peirce regarded his fellow pragmatist philosophers as word-kidnappers. To the contrary he had said, regarding James's and Schiller's uses of the word \"pragmatism\": \"So far, all went happily.\" So it would seem that Peirce intended the coinage \"pragmaticism\" for two distinguishable purposes: (1) protection from literary journals and word-kidnappers, and (2) reference strictly to his own form of pragmatism, as opposed even to other pragmatisms that had not moved him to the new name. In the letter to Calderoni, Peirce did not reject all significant affiliation with fellow pragmatists, and instead said \"the rest of us\". Nor did he reject all such affiliation in later discussions.\n\nHowever, in the following year 1906, in a manuscript \"A Sketch of Logical Critics\", Peirce wrote:\n\nThen, in 1908, in his article \"\", mentioning both James and the journalist, pragmatist, and literary author Giovanni Papini, Peirce wrote:\nIn 1871, in a Metaphysical Club in Cambridge, Mass., I used to preach this principle as a sort of logical gospel, representing the unformulated method followed by Berkeley, and in conversation about it I called it \"Pragmatism.\" In December 1877 and January 1878 I set forth the doctrine in the \"Popular Science Monthly\", and the two parts of my essay were printed in French in the \"Revue Philosophique\", volumes vi. and vii. Of course, the doctrine attracted no particular attention, for, as I had remarked in my opening sentence, very few people care for logic. But in 1897 Professor James remodelled the matter, and transmogrified it into a doctrine of philosophy, some parts of which I highly approved, while other and more prominent parts I regarded, and still regard, as opposed to sound logic. About the time Professor Papini discovered, to the delight of the Pragmatist school, that this doctrine was incapable of definition, which would certainly seem to distinguish it from every other doctrine in whatever branch of science, I was coming to the conclusion that my poor little maxim should be called by another name; and accordingly, in April 1905, I renamed it \"Pragmaticism\".\n\nPeirce proceeded in \"A Neglected Argument\" to express both deep satisfaction and deep dismay with his fellow pragmatists. He singled F. C. S. Schiller out by name and was vague about which among the others he most particularly referred to. Peirce wrote \"It seems to me a pity they should allow a philosophy so instinct with life to become infected with seeds of death...\"\n\nThere has been some controversy over Peirce's relation to other pragmatists over the years and over the question of what is owed to Peirce, with visible crests in titles such as literary essayist Edward Dahlberg's \"Cutpurse Philosopher\" about James, in which Dahlberg claimed that Peirce had \"tombstone reticences\" about making accusations, and Kenneth Laine Ketner's and Walker Percy's \"A Thief of Peirce\", in which Percy described himself as \"a thief of Peirce\" (page 130). Meanwhile, Schiller, James's wife Alice, and James's son Henry James III believed that James had a habit of overstating his intellectual debts to others such as Peirce.\n\nIn another manuscript \"A Sketch of Logical Critic\" dated by the CP editors as 1911, Peirce discussed one of Zeno's paradoxes, that of Achilles and the Tortoise, in terms of James's and others' difficulties with it. Peirce therein expressed regret at having used a \"contemptuous\" manner about such difficulties in his 1903 Harvard lectures on pragmatism (which James had arranged), and said of James, who had died in August 1910: \"Nobody has a better right to testify to the morality of his attitude toward his own thoughts than I, who knew and loved him for forty-nine or fifty years. But owing to his almost unexampled incapacity for mathematical thought, combined with intense hatred for logic — probably for its pedantry, its insistence on minute exactitude — the \"gêne\" of its barbarous formulations, etc. rendered him an easy victim to Zeno and the Achilles...\", called James \"about as perfect a lover of truth as it is possible for a man to be...\" and said: \"In speaking, then, of William James as I do, I am saying the most that I could of any man's intellectual morality; and with him this was but one of a whole diadem of virtues.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

Showing respect for persons is a system for interaction in which one entity ensures that another has agency to be able to make a choice.\n\nThis concept is usually discussed in the context of research ethics. It is one of the three basic principles of research ethics stated in the Belmont Report issued by the Office of Human Subject Research; it comprises two essential moral requirements: to recognize the right for autonomy and to protect individuals who are disadvantaged to the extent that they cannot practice this right.\n\nAn autonomous person is defined as an individual who is capable of self-legislation and is able to make judgments and actions based on his/her particular set of values, preferences, and beliefs. Respecting a person’s autonomy thus involves considering his/her choices and decisions without deliberate obstruction. It also requires that subjects be treated in a non-degrading manner out of respect for their dignity. In practice, respect for persons is operationalized by obtaining Informed Consent from all individuals who are going to be research subjects.\n\nThe standard case for applying respect for persons is when the person receiving the health intervention is of sound mind, fit to make personal decisions, and empowered to choose from various options. Other cases involve showing respect to people who for whatever reason are not free to choose among the typical range of options when making a decision.\n\nIn medical research ethics, the term Vulnerable Populations generally refers to individuals whose situations do not allow them to protect their own interests. The categories of individuals that constitute Vulnerable Populations are outlined under The Common Rule (45 CFR 46, Subparts A-D). These include individuals who are minors, prisoners, pregnant, physically handicapped, mentally disabled, old, economically disadvantaged, educationally disadvantaged, or subordinates in hierarchical groups (e.g. a soldier).\n\nThese individuals are entitled to protection, and additional ethical justification is needed to involve such populations in human subject studies. In such cases, a balance should be established between protecting subjects from exploitation and depriving these subjects of access to the potential benefits of research.\n\nReasons justifying the participation of these subjects would include that some studies could not be carried out without a vulnerable population. Another justification would be that the aim of the study is to gain knowledge to improve diagnosis, prevention or treatment of diseases associated specifically with that population.\n"}

Wollheim served as the president of the British Society of Aesthetics from 1992 onwards until his death in 2003.\n\nSon of an actress and a theatre impresario, Wollheim attended Westminster School, London, and Balliol College, Oxford (1941–2, 1945–8), interrupted by active military service in World War II. In 1949 he obtained a congratulatory first in Philosophy, Politics and Economics, and began teaching at University College London, where he became Grote Professor of Mind and Logic and Department Head from 1963 to 1982. He retired from that position to take up professorships, first, at Columbia University (1982–85) and then the University of California at Berkeley (1985–2002). He chaired the Department at UC Berkeley, 1998–2002. On retirement from Berkeley, he served briefly as a guest lecturer at Balliol College. Additionally, he held visiting positions at Harvard University,the University of Minnesota, Graduate Center, CUNY, the University of California at Davis, and elsewhere. Wollheim gave several distinguished lecture series, most notably the Andrew M. Mellon lectures in Fine Arts, National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. (1984), published as \"Painting as an Art\".\n\nIn 1962, he published an article \"A paradox in the theory of democracy\", in which Wollheim argued that a supporter of democracy faces a contradiction when he votes. On the one hand he wants a particular party or candidate to win, but on the other hand he wants whoever wins the most votes to win. This has become known as Wollheim's paradox.\n\nHis \"Art and its Objects\" was one of the twentieth century's most influential texts on philosophical aesthetics in English. In a 1965 essay, 'Minimal Art', he seems to have coined the phrase, although its meaning eventually drifted from his. As well as for his work on the philosophy of art, Wollheim was known for his philosophical treatments of depth psychology, especially Sigmund Freud's. His posthumously-published autobiography of youth, \"Germs: A Memoir of Childhood\", with complementary essays, discloses a good deal about his family background and his life up to early manhood, providing valuable material for understanding his interests and sensibility.\n\nFor an extensive bibliography of Richard Wollheim's publications by a professional bibliographer, see Eddie Yeghiayan's UC-Irvine site. See also the 'Philweb' listing.\n\nNote: given his unique mind, personality, and distinctive writing styles, along with his curiosity and sociability, many of Richard Wollheim's publications are outside academic categories. Besides books, he published many articles, in journals and edited collections, book reviews, and gallery catalogues for shows. He also left writings in manuscript, letters and recordings of his talks.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "293632", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=293632", "title": "Romance novel", "text": "Romance novel\n\nAlthough the genre is very old, the romance novel or romantic novel discussed in this article is the mass-market version. Novels of this type of genre fiction place their primary focus on the relationship and romantic love between two people, and must have an \"emotionally satisfying and optimistic ending.\" There are many subgenres of the romance novel, including fantasy, historical romance, paranormal fiction, and science fiction. \n\nThe term \"romance\" is also applied to a type of novel defined by Walter Scott as \"a fictitious narrative in prose or verse; the interest of which turns upon marvellous and uncommon incidents\". \n\nA thriving genre of works conventionally referred to as \"romance novels\" existed in ancient Greece. Other precursors can be found in the literary fiction of the 18th and 19th centuries, including Samuel Richardson's sentimental novel \"Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded\" (1740) and the novels of Jane Austen. Austen inspired Georgette Heyer, the British author of historical romance set around the time Austen lived, as well as detective fiction. Heyer's first romance novel, \"The Black Moth\" (1921), was set in 1751.\n\nThe British company Mills and Boon began releasing escapist fiction for women in the 1930s. Their books were sold in North America by Harlequin Enterprises Ltd, which began direct marketing to readers and allowing mass-market merchandisers to carry the books.\nAccording to the Romance Writers of America, the main plot of a mass-market romance novel must revolve about the two people as they develop romantic love for each other and work to build a relationship. Both the conflict and the climax of the novel should be directly related to that core theme of developing a romantic relationship, although the novel can also contain subplots that do not specifically relate to the main characters' romantic love. Furthermore, a romance novel must have an \"emotionally satisfying and optimistic ending.\" Others, including Leslie Gelbman, a president of Berkley Books, define the genre more simply, stating only that a romance must make the \"romantic relationship between the hero and the heroine ... the core of the book.\" In general, romance novels reward characters who are good people and penalize those who are evil, and a couple who fights for and believes in their relationship will likely be rewarded with unconditional love. Bestselling author Nora Roberts sums up the genre, saying: \"The books are about the celebration of falling in love and emotion and commitment, and all of those things we really want.\" Women's fiction (including \"chick lit\") is not directly a subcategory of the romance novel genre, because in women's fiction the heroine's relationship with her family or friends may be as important as her relationship with the hero.\n\nSome romance novel authors and readers believe the genre has additional restrictions, from plot considerations (such as the protagonists' meeting early on in the story), to avoiding themes (such as adultery). Other disagreements have centered on the firm requirement for a happy ending; some readers admit stories without a happy ending, if the focus of the story is on the romantic love between the two main characters (e.g., \"Romeo and Juliet\"). While the majority of romance novels meet the stricter criteria, there are also many books widely considered to be romance novels that deviate from these rules. Therefore, the general definition, as embraced by the RWA and publishers, includes only the focus on a developing romantic relationship and an optimistic ending. Escapism is important; an Avon executive observed that \"The phone never rings, the baby never cries and the rent's never overdue in romances\".\n\nAs long as a romance novel meets those twin criteria, it can be set in any time period and in any location. There are no specific restrictions on what can or cannot be included in a romance novel. Even controversial subjects are addressed in romance novels, including topics such as date rape, domestic violence, addiction, and disability. The combination of time frame, location, and plot elements does, however, help a novel to fit into one of several romance subgenres. Despite the numerous possibilities this framework allows, many people in the mainstream press claim that \"all [romance novels] seem to read alike.\" Stereotypes of the romance genre abound. For instance, some believe that all romance novels are similar to those of Danielle Steel, featuring rich, glamorous people traveling to exotic locations. Many romance readers disagree that Steel writes romance at all, considering her novels more mainstream fiction.\n\nMass-market romance novels are sometimes referred to as \"smut\" or female pornography, and are the most popular form of modern erotica for women. While some romance novels do contain more erotic acts, in other romance novels the characters do no more than kiss chastely. The romance genre runs the spectrum between these two extremes. Because women buy 90% of all romance novels, most romance novels are told from a woman's viewpoint, in either first or third person.\n\nAlthough most romance novels are about heterosexual pairings there are romance novels that deal with same-sex relationships, and some participants in the book industry characterize books dealing with same-sex relationships as F/F, and M/M.\n\nWhile this article is about the mass-market form of love romance novels, the genre of works of extended prose fiction dealing with romantic love existed in classical Greece. The titles of over twenty such ancient Greek romance novels are known, but most of them have only survived in an incomplete, fragmentary form. Only five ancient Greek romance novels have survived to the present day in a state of near-completion: \"Chareas and Callirhoe\", \"Leucippe and Clitophon\", \"Daphnis and Chloe\", \"The Ephesian Tale\", and \"The Ethiopian Tale\".\n\nPrecursors of the modern popular love-romance can also be found in the sentimental novel \"Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded,\" by Samuel Richardson, published in 1740. \"Pamela\" was the first popular novel to be based on a courtship as told from the perspective of the heroine. Unlike many of the novels of the time, \"Pamela\" had a happy ending, when after Mr. B attempts unsuccessfully to seduce and rape Pamela multiple times, he eventually rewards her virtue by sincerely proposing an equitable marriage to her. The book was one of the first bestsellers, with five editions printed in the first eleven months of release.\n\nJane Austen is an important influence on romance genre fiction, and \"Pride and Prejudice\", published in 1813, has been called \"the best romance novel ever written\". In the early part of the Victorian era, the Brontë sisters, like Austen, wrote literary fiction that influenced later popular fiction. Charlotte Brontë in \"Jane Eyre\", published in 1847, introduced the orphaned heroine. Brontë's love romance incorporates elements of both the gothic novel and Elizabethan drama, and \"demonstrate[s] the flexibility of the romance novel form.\"\n\nWhile the literary fiction romance continued to develop in the 20th century, the new subgenre of genre fiction, which first developed in the 19th century, started to become more popular after the First World War. In 1919, E.M. Hull's novel \"The Sheik\" was published in the United Kingdom. The novel, which became hugely popular, was adapted into a movie (1921), which established star Rudolph Valentino as the top male actor of the time. The hero of this book was an iconic alpha male who kidnapped the heroine and won her admiration through his forceful actions. The novel was one of the first modern works to introduce the rape fantasy, a theme explored in Samuel Richardson's \"Pamela\" (1740). Although women were gaining more independence in life, publishers believed that readers would only accept premarital sex in the context of rape. In this novel and those that followed, the rape was depicted as more of a fantasy; the heroine is rarely if ever shown experiencing terror, stress, or trauma as a result.\n\nThe popular, mass market version of the historical romance, which Walter Scott developed in the early 19th century, is seen as beginning in 1921, when Georgette Heyer published \"The Black Moth\". This is set in 1751, but many of Heyer's novels were inspired by Jane Austen's novels and are set around the time Austen lived, in the later Regency period. Because Heyer's romances are set more than 100 years earlier, she includes carefully researched historical detail to help her readers understand the period. Unlike other popular love-romance novels of the time, Heyer's novels used the setting as a major plot device. Her characters often exhibit twentieth century sensibilities, and more conventional characters in the novels point out the heroine's eccentricities, such as wanting to marry for love. Heyer was a prolific author, and wrote one to two historical romance novels per year until her death in 1974.\n\nIn the 1930s, the British publishers Mills and Boon began releasing hardback romance novels. The books were sold through weekly two-penny libraries and were known as \"the books in brown\" for their brown binding. In the 1950s, the company began offering the books for sale through newsagents across\nthe United Kingdom.\n\nA Canadian company, Harlequin Enterprises, began distributing in North America in 1957 the category romances published by Mills and Boon. Mary Bonneycastle, wife of Harlequin founder Richard Bonneycastle, and her daughter, Judy Burgess, exercised editorial control over which Mills and Boon novels Harlequin reprinted. They had a \"decency code,\" and rejected more sexually explicit material that Mills and Boon submitted for reprinting. Realizing that the genre was popular, Richard Bonneycastle finally decided to read a romance novel. He chose one of the more explicit novels and enjoyed it. On his orders, the company conducted a market test with the novel he had read and discovered that it outsold a similar, tamer novel. Overall, the novels were short and formulaic, featuring heroines who were sweet, compassionate, pure and innocent. The few heroines who worked did so in traditional female jobs, including as nurses, governesses and secretaries. Intimacy in the novels never extended beyond a chaste kiss between the protagonists.\n\nOn October 1, 1971, Harlequin purchased Mills and Boon. By this point, the romance novel genre \"had been popularized and distributed widely to an enthusiastic audience\" in Great Britain. In an attempt to duplicate Mills and Boon's success in North America, Harlequin improved their distribution and marketing system. By choosing to sell their books \"where the women are,\" they allowed many mass-market merchandisers and even supermarkets to sell the books, all of which were exactly 192 pages. Harlequin then began a reader service, selling directly to readers who agreed to purchase a certain number of books each month.\n\nIn the US, modern romance genre fiction was born in 1972, with Avon's publication of Kathleen Woodiwiss's \"The Flame and the Flower\", which was the first of the modern \"bodice ripper\" romance novels to follow \"the principals into the bedroom.\" Aside from its content, the book was revolutionary in that it was one of the first single-title romance novels to be published as an original paperback, rather than being first published in hardcover, and, like the category romances, was distributed in drug stores and other mass-market merchandising outlets. The novel went on to sell 2.35 million copies. Avon followed its release with the 1974 publication of Woodiwiss's second novel, \"The Wolf and the Dove\" and two more sexually graphic novels by newcomer Rosemary Rogers, \"Sweet Savage Love\" and \"Dark Fires\". The latter sold two million copies in its first three months of release. By 1975, \"Publishers Weekly\" had reported that the \"Avon originals\" had sold a combined . The following year over 150 historical romance novels, many of them paperback originals, were published, selling over .\n\nThe success of these novels prompted a new style of writing romance, concentrating primarily on historical fiction tracking the monogamous relationship between a helpless heroine and the hero who rescued her, even if he had been the one to place her in danger. The covers of these novels tended to feature scantily clad women being grabbed by the hero, and caused the novels to be referred to as bodice-rippers. A \"Wall St. Journal\" article in 1980 referred to these bodice rippers as \"publishing's answer to the Big Mac: They are juicy, cheap, predictable, and devoured in stupefying quantities by legions of loyal fans.\" The term \"bodice-ripper\" is now considered offensive to many in the romance industry.\n\nIn this new style of historical romance, heroines were independent and strong-willed and were often paired with heroes who evolved into caring and compassionate men who truly admired the women they loved. This was in contrast to the contemporary romances published during this time, which were often characterized by weak females who fell in love with overbearing alpha males. Although these heroines had active roles in the plot, they were \"passive in relationships with the heroes.\" Across the genre, heroines during this time were usually aged 16–21, with the heroes slightly older, usually around 30. The women were virgins, while the men were not, and both members of the couple were described as beautiful.\n\nCategory romance lines were slower to react to some of the changes that had swept the historical romance subgenre. Despite the fact that the former Mills & Boon lines were now owned by a North American company, the lines did not have any American writers until 1975, when Harlequin purchased a novel by Janet Dailey. Dailey's novels provided the romance genre's \"first look at heroines, heroes and courtships that take place in America, with American sensibilities, assumptions, history, and most of all, settings.\" Harlequin was unsure how the market would react to this new type of romance, and was unwilling to fully embrace it. In the late 1970s, a Harlequin editor rejected a manuscript by Nora Roberts, who has since become the top-selling romance author, because \"they already had their American writer.\"\n\nHarlequin sold almost $70 million of its paperback romances in 1979 through 100,000 supermarkets and other stores, giving the company almost 10% of the market for paperback books. That year the company began distributing its own books in the United States instead of through Simon & Schuster's Pocket Books. In 1980 Simon & Schuster formed Silhouette Books to publish its own romance novels, beginning what \"The New York Times\" called \"perhaps the most bitter war in American book publishing history\". The company sought to take advantage of the untapped talent of the American writers. They published several lines of category romance, and encouraged their writers to create stronger heroines and less dominant heroes. Authors were also expected to address contemporary issues where appropriate. Silhouette soon saw their market share expand, and in 1984, Harlequin acquired them. Despite the acquisition, Silhouette continued to retain editorial control and to publish various lines under their own imprint.\n\nHarlequin had also failed to adapt quickly to the signs that readers appreciated novels with more explicit sex scenes, and in 1980, several publishers entered the category romance market to fill that gap. That year, Dell launched their Candlelight Ecstasy line with Amii Lorin's \"The Tawny Gold Man\", becoming the first line to waive the requirement that heroines be virgins. By the end of 1983 sales for the Candlelight Ecstasy line totaled $30 million. Silhoeutte also launched similar lines, Desire (sexually explicit) and Special Edition (sexually explicit and longer stories, up to 250 pages), each of which had a 90–100% sellout rate each month.\n\nA 1982 survey of romance readers confirmed that the new styles of writing were attracting new readers to the genre. 35% of the readers surveyed had begun reading romances after 1977. An additional 31% of those surveyed had been readers for between 6 and 10 years, meaning they had become interested in the genre after 1972, when Woodiwiss's revolutionary novel was published. This means that two-thirds of those surveyed joined the genre after it had begun to change.\n\nThe number of category romance lines increased at a rapid pace, and by 1985 there were 16 separate lines producing a total of 80 novels per month. The sudden increase in category romance lines meant an equally sudden increase in demand for writers of the new style of romance novel. This tight market caused a proportionate decrease in the quality of the novels that were being released. By 1984, the market was saturated with category lines and readers had begun to complain of redundancy in plots. The following year, the \"dampening effect of the high level of redundancy associated with series romances was evident in the decreased number of titles being read per month.\" Harlequin's return rate, which had been less than 25% in 1978, when it was the primary provider of category romance, swelled to 60%.\n\nThe genre continued to expand in the mid-to-late 1980s, as publishers realized that the more popular authors were often those who stretched the boundaries of the genre. A 1984 novel by LaVyrle Spencer featured an overweight, middle-aged hero who had to make drastic changes to his lifestyle to win the heroine, while a 1987 Dailey novel involved an ugly hero and a heroine who was searching for her birth mother. Jayne Ann Krentz's 1986 novel \"Sweet Starfire\" became the first futuristic romance, combining elements of traditional romance novels and science fiction. The relationships had also modernized: by the 1990s, it was rare to see a book that featured a man raping his future wife.\nIn the mid-to-late 1980s, contemporary romances began to feature women in more male-dominated jobs, such as offshore oil rigs and the space program. The age range of heroines also began to expand, so that books began to feature women who had already reached 30 and even 40. Heroes also changed, with some authors veering towards a more sensitive man. Despite the broadening of some aspects of the plot, other taboos remained, and publishers discouraged authors from writing about controversial subjects such as terrorism, warfare, and masculine sports. Romance novels began to contain more humor beginning in the 1990s, as Julie Garwood began introducing a great deal of humor into her historical romances.\n\nThe romance novel began to expand in other ways as well. In 1989, author Jude Deveraux became the first romance author to transition from writing original mass market paperbacks to being published in hardcover. Her novel, \"A Knight in Shining Armor\", \"became a natural bestseller.\" Several authors found success writing single-title romances set in contemporary times, and publishing houses began to encourage the growth in the genre. Because the novels were set in modern times, they could include more of the elements that modern women could relate to, and soon began to touch on themes such as single parenthood, adoption, and abuse.\n\nBy 2000, the covers had begun to evolve from featuring a scantily clad couple to instead showing a view of the landscape featured in the novel.\n\nAs women's career options have expanded in real life, so have those of their fictional counterparts. In the earliest Harlequin romance novels, heroines were typically nurses and secretaries. As time has passed and women have entered the workforce in larger numbers, romance heroines have spanned the career spectrum. Modern romance novels now feature more balanced relationships between men and women.\n\nThe romance genre has been popularly derided and critically ignored.\n\nDespite recent rehabilitation and merging of the genre with other genres, the stigma attached to the romance genre continues to be strong, with some dedicated readers embarrassed to admit to buying or even reading the books. The romance genre has over the years generated significant derision, skepticism and criticism. Some critics point to a lack of suspense, as it is obvious that the hero and heroine will eventually resolve their issues, and wonder whether it is beneficial \"for women to be whiling away so many hours reading impossibly glamorized love stories.\" According to fiction author Melissa Pritchard, a romance novel \"perpetuates something slightly dangerous, that there's this notion, that there's this perfect love out there, and it can distract you from the work of loving yourself.\"\n\nRomance novelists attribute the stigma to the fact that romance is the only genre \"written almost exclusively by women for women.\" Romance novelist Jennifer Crusie counters that in the modern romance novel \"a woman is rewarded with unconditional love [only] if she remains true to herself\", while novelist Susan Elizabeth Phillips believes that romance novels are popular because the heroine always wins, sometimes overcoming great odds so that she is no longer a victim.\n\nRomance novels are divided into two sub-sets, category romances, also known as series romances, and single title romances. Many authors write only within one of the formats, but others, including Jennifer Crusie and Jayne Ann Krentz, have achieved success in both formats.\n\nCategory romances are short, usually no more than 200 pages, or about 55,000 words. The books are published in clearly delineated lines, with a certain number of books published in each line every month. In many cases, the books are numbered sequentially within the line. These novels have widespread distribution—often worldwide—and a single U.S. print run, remaining on a bookseller's shelves until they are sold out or until the next month's titles are released and take their place. Writers for the largest publisher of category romance, Harlequin/Mills & Boon, can find their novels translated into 26 languages and sold in over 100 international markets.\n\nTo write a successful novel of this length, the \"author must pare the story down to its essentials. Subplots and minor characters are eliminated or relegated to the backstory.\" Nonetheless, category romance lines each have a distinct identity, which may involve similar settings, characters, time periods, levels of sensuality, or types of conflict. Publishers of category romances usually issue guidelines for each line, specifying the elements necessary for a novel to be included in each line. Depending on the current market and perceived reader preferences, publishers frequently begin new lines or end existing ones. Most recently, erotic and Christian lines have been introduced while traditional Regency romance lines have ended.\n\nSingle-titles novels are romance novels not published as part of a publisher's category. They are longer than category romances, typically between 350 and 400 pages, or 100,000-110,000 words. Publishers may release the novels over a shorter period of time for sales and publicity reasons, but on average authors write 1.5 novels per year and have one each year published. Single-title novels remain on the booksellers' shelves at the discretion of the store.\n\nDespite their name, single-title novels are not always stand alone novels. Some authors prefer to write several interconnected books, ranging in number from trilogies to long-running series, so that they can revisit characters or worlds. Such sets of books often have similar titles, and may be labelled as \"Number 1 in the XXX Series\", but they are not considered series romances because they are not part of a particular line.\n\nBecause the definition of a romance novel does not limit the types of plot devices, time frames, or locations that can be included, the genre has grown to encompass a wide variety of material and spawned multiple subgenres. Subgenres of romance are often closely related to other literature genres, and some books could be considered a romance subgenre novel and another genre novel at the same time. For example, romantic suspense novels are often similar to mysteries, crime fiction and thrillers, and paranormal romances use elements popular in science fiction and fantasy novels.\n\nContemporary romance, which is set after World War II, is often what people mean when they refer to a romance novel. Contemporary romance novels—the largest subgenre—are set in the time when they are written, and usually reflect the mores of that time. Heroines in contemporary romances prior to 1970 usually quit working when they marry or have children—while heroines after 1970 usually have, and keep, a career. As contemporary romance novels have grown to contain more complex plotting and more realistic characters, the line between this subgenre and the genre of women's fiction has blurred.\n\nMost contemporary romance novels contain elements that date the books. The majority of them eventually become irrelevant to more modern readers and go out of print. Those that survive the test of time, such as Jane Austen's work, are often reclassified as historical romances.\n\nOver half of the romantic fiction published in the United States in 2004 (1468 out of 2,285 books) were contemporary romance novels. Contemporary romance novels have twice been chosen by Kelly Ripa to be featured in her Reading with Ripa book club.\n\nHistorical romance, also known as historical novel, is a broad category of fiction which the plot takes place in a setting located in the past, which Walter Scott helped popularize in the early 19th-century, with works such as \"Rob Roy\" and \"Ivanhoe\". Literary fiction historical romances continue to be published, and a notable recent example is \"Wolf Hall\" (2009), a multi-award-winning novel by English historical novelist Hilary Mantel. However, the focus here is on the mass-market genre.\n\nThis subgenre includes a wide variety of other subgenres, including Regency romance. Mass-market historical romance novels are rarely published in hardcover, with fewer than 15 receiving that status each year, less than one-fifth of the number of contemporary romance novels published in that format. Because historical romances are primarily published in mass-market format, their fortunes are tied to a certain extent to the mass-market trends. Booksellers and large merchandisers now sell fewer mass market paperbacks, preferring trade paperbacks or hardcovers, which prevents historical romances from being sold in some price clubs and other mass merchandise outlets.\n\nIn 2001, 778 mass-market historical romances were published, a 10-year high. By 2004, the annual number had dropped to 486, which was still 20% of all romance novels published. Kensington Books says they receive fewer submissions of historical novels, and their previously published authors have switched to contemporary.\n\nRomantic suspense involves an intrigue or mystery for the protagonists to solve. Typically, however, the heroine is the victim of a crime or attempted crime, and works with a hero, who tends to be in a field where he would serve as a protector, such as a police officer, FBI agent, bodyguard, or Navy SEAL. By the end of the novel, the mystery is resolved and the interaction between the hero and heroine has evolved into a solid relationship. These novels primarily take place in contemporary times, but authors such as Amanda Quick have broadened the genre to also include historical timeframes.\n\nLike all romances, romantic suspense novels must place the development of a relationship between the protagonists at the heart of the story. The relationship \"must impact each decision they make and increase the tension of the suspense as it propel the story. In turn, the events of suspense must also directly affect the relationship and move the story forward.\" Romantic suspense novels tend to have more \"clean\" language, without the \"emotional, intimate\" descriptions often used in more traditional romances. Because the mystery is a crucial aspect of the plot, these novels are more plot-driven instead of character-driven.\n\nThis blend of the romance and mystery was perfected by Mary Stewart, who wrote ten romantic suspense novels between 1955 and 1967. Stewart was one of the first to seamlessly combine the two genres, maintaining a full mystery while focusing on the courtship between two people. In her novels, the process of solving the mystery \"helps to illuminate\" the hero's personality, helping the heroine to fall in love with him.\n\nParanormal romance blends the real with the fantastic or science fictional. The fantastic elements may be woven into an alternate version of our own world in an urban fantasy involving vampires, demons, and/or werewolves, or they may be more \"normal\" manifestations of the paranormal—humans with psychic abilities, witches, or ghosts. Time travel, futuristic, and extraterrestrial romances also fall beneath the paranormal umbrella.\n\nThese novels often blend elements of other subgenres—including suspense, mystery, or chick lit—with their fantastic themes. A few paranormal romances are set solely in the past and are structured much like any historical romance novel. Others are set in the future, sometimes on different worlds. Still others have a time-travel element with either the hero or the heroine traveling into the past or the future. Between 2002 and 2004, the number of paranormal romances published in the United States doubled to 170 per year. A popular title in the genre can sell over 500,000 copies.\n\nMany paranormal romances rely on the blend of contemporary American life with the existence of supernatural or magically empowered beings, human or otherwise. Sometimes the larger culture is aware of the magical in its midst; sometimes it is not. Some paranormal romances focus less on the specifics of their alternate worlds than do traditional science fiction or fantasy novels, keeping the attention strongly on the underlying romance. Others develop the alternate reality meticulously, combining well-planned magical systems and inhuman cultures with contemporary reality.\n\nThe first futuristic romance to be marketed by a mainstream romance publisher, Jayne Ann Krentz's \"Sweet Starfire\", was published in 1986 and was a \"classic road trip romance\" that just happened to be set in a separate galaxy. This genre has become more popular since 2000. Krentz attributes the popularity of this romance genre to the fact that the novels \"are, at heart, classic historical romances that just happen to be set on other worlds.\"\n\nFantasy Romance, also known as Romantic Fantasy, is a subgenre of fantasy fiction, describing a fantasy story using many of the elements and conventions of the romance genre. Romantic fantasy has been published by both fantasy and romance lines, with some publishers distinguishing between \"fantasy romance\" being more like a contemporary fantasy novel with romantic elements, and \"romantic fantasy\" with more emphasis on the romance elements of the story.\n\nTime-travel romances are a version of the classic \"fish out of water\" story. In most, the heroine is from the present day and travels into the past to meet the hero. In a smaller subset of these novels, the hero, who lives in the past, travels forward into his future to meet the heroine. A successful time-travel romance must have the characters react logically to their experience and should investigate some of the differences, both physical and mental, between the world the character normally inhabits and the one where they landed. Some writers end their novels with the protagonists trapped in different time periods and unable to be together—to the displeasure of many readers of the genre.\n\nInspirational romance, as the market exists today, combines explicitly Christian themes with the development of a romantic relationship. In 2004, 167 novels were published in the inspirational romance subgenre. These novels typically do not include gratuitous violence or swearing, and the central courtship is chaste. Sex, if it is present at all, occurs after marriage and is not explicitly detailed. Many novels in this genre also focus on the hero or heroine's faith, turning the love story into \"a triangle: the man and the woman and also their relationship with God.\" Themes such as forgiveness, honesty, and fidelity are common.\n\nThe first line of series inspirational romances debuted shortly after the 1980 U.S. presidential election, when Silhouette launched their Silhouette Inspirations line. The books were aimed at born-again Christians and were marketed in religious bookstores. The Silhouette Inspirations line was closed after Harlequin acquired Silhouette in 1984 because it was not profitable. However, other Christian publishers continued to produce romance novels, including historical and contemporary, and Harlequin later rejoined the market with the 1998 launch of its Steeple Hill and Love Inspired lines.\n\nMulticultural romance typically features a hero and/or heroine who is African-American, although some multicultural lines also include Asian or Hispanic heroes or heroines or interracial relationships. The first line of multicultural romance novels, Arabesque, was launched by Kensington books in 1994. BET Books purchased the line in 1998, and the number of new authors that they publish has continued to expand each year. BET has also developed some of the Arabesque novels into made-for-television movies.\n\nIn 1999, Kensington Publishing launched the first line of Latino romance novels - ENCANTO. The ENCANTO novels were originally released in two ways - a bilingual Spanish/English version and a Spanish only version. Two novels were published every month until late 2001, when the line went into hiatus. Despite the demise of the line, several of the ENCANTO authors have continued writing novels with Latino protagonists namely, Sylvia Mendoza, Tracy Montoya, Caridad Pineiro, Berta Platas, Lara Rios and Lynda Sandoval.\n\nAlthough romance novels featuring African-Americans and Hispanic protagonists are becoming more popular, those featuring Asian or Asian-American characters are rare. Author Tess Gerritsen believes this is due to the fact that there are fewer Asian-American women who read romances: \"We read romances because we want to feel good about love...in order to do that, the reader must identify with the heroine.\"\n\nErotic romance is a blend of romance and erotica. Erotic romance novels are characterized by strong sexual content, but can contain elements of any of the other romance subgenres. Erotic romance novels tend to use more frank language, avoiding many of the euphemisms used in books with milder content. These novels also usually include more sex scenes, often focusing more on the sex act rather than being a more traditional love scene, and may include more unusual positions or acts. Despite a greater emphasis on the sex scenes, however, erotic romance is distinguishable from traditional pornography. Pornography concentrates on the sex acts, but erotic novels include well-developed characters and a plot that could exist without the sex acts.\n\nErotic romances' lengths run from short stories to single-title novels. Some of these are published as part of a category, such as Harlequin Blaze, while others are published as part of an anthology and are only novella length. Even single-title erotic romances may be as short as a novella, however.\n\nMany of the publishers of erotic romance are either small press publishers or electronic book publishers. Writers often have more leeway as to what types of erotic acts can be included when working with an electronic publisher than they would have when working with a print publisher. The market for erotic romances has been growing rapidly, leading some publishers to create new lines for these types of books. Some subjects are still considered taboo, even with erotic romance. Themes such as pedophilia, incest, and bestiality are discouraged by all publishers.\n\nThe market for erotic romances has grown rapidly. Ellora's Cave, an electronic publisher that focuses on erotic romance, became the first electronic publisher recognized by the Romance Writers of America as a legitimate publisher.\n\nThe romance fiction market \"has been impervious to the overall economic recession, with faithful readers spending up to $40 a month\" on romance novels in 1982. That year, paperback romances totaled $300 million in sales, and the total audience was estimated at 20 million readers. A survey of 600 regular romance readers the same year \"found that they mirror the general population in age, education, and marital and socioeconomic status.\" Over half of the women had at least some college education, and 40% were employed full-time. 60% of the women surveyed read at least one romance every two days. The women admitted to reading romances as an antidote to stress, for mental escape, and to learn about history and new careers.\n\nBy the 2000s, romance had become the most popular genre in modern literature. In 2008, romantic fiction generated $1.37 billion in sales, with 7,311 romance novels published and making up 13.5% of the consumer book market. Over 74 million people claimed to have read at least one romance novel in 2008, according to a Romance Writers of America study. The study reported that 9.5% of romance readers identified themselves as male, and that romance readers were more likely to be married or living with a partner. According to the RWA 84% of romance buyers were women and 16% were men. Of the entire American population, 24.6% read at least one romance novel in 2008.\n\n74.8 million people read an English-language romance novel in 2008. Harlequin sells more than 4 books per second, half of them internationally. Author Heather Graham attributes this to the fact that \"emotions translate easily.\" In the United Kingdom, over 20% of all fiction books sold each year are romance novels.\n\nAlthough romance novels are translated into over 90 languages, the majority of authors of these works are from Great Britain, the United States, Canada or, to a lesser extent, Australia. In France, where over 12 million romance novels are sold each year, all are translations. and some publishing companies in Germany refuse to allow their romance authors to use their own names, fearing that the German audience will not buy a romance novel that does not have an Anglo-American pseudonym.\n\nThe Anglo-Saxon perspective in the fiction at times can be much less successful in a European market. Although Italy is the strongest foreign market for the chick lit sold by single-title imprint Red Dress Ink, in that country romance readers do not care to read books about cowboys, as this type of occupation was not common in their culture. The paranormal romance genre is not popular in countries such as Poland and Russia, although historical romance tends to be very successful. Inspirational romance does not sell well in Europe, where romances that feature babies are very popular. German readers enjoy reading more erotic romance novels, and some German translations of English romance novels expand or insert love scenes into otherwise tame stories. The alternate scenario also occurs, as other German translators censor the love scenes.\n\nAs of 2014, romance is the most popular literary genre in Russia (chosen 13% of respondents), especially among the younger audience.\n\nIn 2004, sales of romance novels in Australia increased 28% over the year before. Between 1999 and 2004 there was an increase of 40–50% in the number of new titles released. Harlequin received 20,000 unsolicited manuscripts each year.\n\nThe most prestigious and notable awards for romance novels are the RITA Awards, which are presented annually by the Romance Writers of America to the best novels in romantic fiction.\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}

This results in an \"effortless awareness of being\", and by staying with it this \"I-I\" gradually destroys the vasanas \"which cause the 'I'-thought to rise,\" and finally the 'I'-thought never rises again, which is Self-realization or liberation.\n\n Vichāra (Sanskrit: विचार) means deliberation; its root is वि (prefix to verbs and nouns it expresses) – चर् (to move, roam, obtain knowledge of). It is the faculty of discrimination between right and wrong; it is deliberation about cause and effect, and the final analysis; it is also the enquiry into the nature of the Atman, Satya, Ishvara and Brahman. This Sanskrit word, \"Vichāra\", does not have a corresponding word in English. \"Vichāra\" is reflection and contemplation upon the meaning of Vedantic truths, and leads the individual to true knowledge, it leads to Brahman, the Universal Self.\n\n\"Vichara\" is also called \"jnana-vichara\" or \"\" by his devotees.\n\n\"Ātman\" (IAST: ātman, Sanskrit: आत्मन्) is a Sanskrit word that is usually translated as \"self\". The root *ēt-men (breath) is cognate with Old English \"æþm\", Greek \"asthma\", German \"Atem\": \"atmen\" (to breathe). It is derived from Latin \"anima\" (breath,soul), which is cognate to Sanskrit \"ánilaḥ\" (wind). Although \"ánilaḥ\" and \"ātman\" have similar meaning, they are not etymologically related.\n\nIn Hindu philosophy, especially in the Vedanta school of Hinduism, Ātman is the first principle, the \"true\" self of an individual beyond identification with phenomena, the essence of an individual. To attain salvation (liberation), a human being must acquire self-knowledge (atma jnana), which is to realise that one's true self (Ātman) is identical with the transcendent self Brahman (or paramatman).\n\nStrictly speaking, \"self-enquiry\" is not the investigation of the \"Self\", \"atman\", but of the \"I\", \"aham\" (Sanskrit), \"nan\" (Tamil).\n\nRamana's teachings on Self-enquiry originated in his own awakening at age 16, when he became firmly aware of death. It made him aware of the Self. Ramana summarised his insight into \"aham sphurana\" (Self-awareness) to a visitor in 1945:\nAt first, Ramana thought that he was possessed by a spirit, \"which had taken up residence in his body\". This feeling remained for several weeks.\n\nLater in life, he called his death experience \"akrama mukti\", \"sudden liberation\", as opposed to the \"krama mukti\", \"gradual liberation\" as in the Vedanta path of jnana yoga:\nAccording to David Frawley, \"atma-vichara\" is the most important practice in the Advaita Vedanta tradition, predating its popularisation by Ramana Maharshi. It is part of the eighth limb of Patanjali's Yoga Sutras, which describes the various stages of samadhi. Meditation on \"I-am-ness\" is a subtle object of meditation in \"savikalpa samadhi\". It is also described in the \"Yoga Vasistha\", a syncretic work which may date from the 6th or 7th century CE, and shows influences from Yoga, Samkhya, Saiva Siddhanta and Mahayana Buddhism, especially Yogacara.\n\nRamana taught that by paying close attention to the 'I'-thought, this 'I'-thought will disappear and only \"I-I\" or Self-awareness remains. This results in an \"effortless awareness of being\", and by staying with it this \"I-I\" gradually destroys the vasanas \"which cause the 'I'-thought to rise,\" and finally the 'I'-thought never rises again, which is Self-realization or liberation.\n\nRamana gave upadesa, \"instruction or guidance given to a disciple by his Guru\", pointing to the true Self of the devotees and showing them the truth of it. As author and long-time devotee David Godman explains,\nSelf-enquiry can be practised at all times: \nRamana stated that the Self is awareness: \nGiving up awareness of not-self leads to pure awareness:\nRamana's written works contain terse descriptions of self-enquiry. Verse thirty of \"Ulladu Narpadu\":\nVerses nineteen and twenty of \"Upadesa Undiyar\" describe the same process in almost identical terms:\nVichara Sangraham (Self-Enquiry):\nEarly on, Ramana attracted devotees who would sit in his company, and ask him questions. Several devotees recorded the answers to their own specific questions, or kept the sheets of paper on which Ramana answered, and had them later published. Other devotees recorded the talks between Ramana and devotees, a large amount of which have also been published.\n\nRamana \"never felt moved to formulate his teaching of his own accord, either verbally or in writing\". The few writings he's credited with \"came into being as answers to questions asked by his disciples or through their urging\". Only a few hymns were written on his own initiative.\n\nRamana's earliest teachings are documented in the book \"Nan Yar?\"(Who am I?), in which he elaborates on the \"I\" and Self-enquiry. The original book was first written in Tamil, and published by Sri Pillai. The essay version of the book (\"Sri Ramana Nutrirattu\") prepared by Ramana is considered definitive, as unlike the original it had the benefit of his revision and review. \"Nan Yar\" was documented by his disciple M. Sivaprakasam Pillai, who was already heavily influenced by traditional Advaita, and so had added notes about the traditional Advaitic negation method for his own clarification; these additional notes were later removed by Ramana. A careful translation with notes is available in English as 'The Path of Sri Ramana, Part One' by Sri Sadhu Om, one of the direct disciples of Ramana. There is also an edition by Open Sky Press, Nan Yar - Who Am I? with the original text of \"Nan Yar\" set to quotes and digitally remastered photographs of Sri Ramana Maharshi.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "12830846", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12830846", "title": "Semantic view of theories", "text": "Semantic view of theories\n\nThe semantic view of theories is a position in the philosophy of science that holds that a scientific theory can be identified with a collection of models. The semantic view of theories was originally proposed by Patrick Suppes in “A Comparison of the Meaning and Uses of Models in Mathematics and the Empirical Sciences” as a reaction against the received view of theories popular among the logical positivists. Many varieties of the semantic view propose identifying theories with a class of set-theoretic models in the Tarskian sense, while others specify models in the mathematical language stipulated by the field of which the theory is a member.\n\nThe semantic view is typically contrasted with the syntactic view of theories of the logical positivists and logical empiricists, especially Carl Gustav Hempel and Rudolf Carnap. On the contrast between syntactic and semantic views, Bas van Fraassen writes:\n\nThe syntactic picture of a theory identifies it with a body of theorems, stated in one particular language chosen for the expression of that theory. This should be contrasted with the alternative of presenting a theory in the first instance by identifying a class of structures as its models. In this second, semantic, approach the language used to express the theory is neither basic nor unique; the same class of structures could well be described in radically different ways, each with its own limitations. The models occupy central stage.\n\nIn this same book, van Fraassen, a key founder of the semantic view of theories, critiques the syntactic view in very strong terms:\n\nPerhaps the worst consequence of the syntactic approach was the way it focused attention on philosophically irrelevant technical questions. It is hard not to conclude that those discussions of axiomatizability in restricted vocabularies, 'theoretical terms', Craig’s theorem, 'reduction sentences', 'empirical languages', Ramsey and Carnap sentences, were one and all off the mark—solutions to purely self-generated problems, and philosophically irrelevant. (p. 56)\n\nThe semantic view of theories has been extended to other domains, including population genetics.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "36738932", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36738932", "title": "Sentiocentrism", "text": "Sentiocentrism\n\nSentiocentrism or sentio-centrism describes the philosophy that sentient individuals (i.e., basically conscious beings) are the center of moral concern. The philosophy posits that all and only sentient beings have intrinsic value and moral standing, thus moral patients; while the rest of the natural world has instrumental value. Both humans and other sentient animals have rights and/or interests that must be considered.\n\nSentiocentrists consider discrimination between sentient beings of different species to be speciesism, an arbitrary discrimination. Coherent sentiocentrist belief respects all sentient beings.\n\nThe utilitarian criterion of moral standing is, therefore, all and only sentient beings (sentiocentrism). The 18th-century philosopher Jeremy Bentham compiled Enlightenment beliefs in \"Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation\" (second edition, 1823, chapter 17, footnote), and he included his own reasoning in a comparison between slavery and sadism toward animals:\nPeter Singer, in \"A Utilitarian Defense of Animal Liberation\" (pp. 73–82); Tom Regan, in \"The Radical Egalitarian Case for Animal Rights\" (pp. 82–90) and Warren, in \"A Critique of Regan's Animal Rights Theory\" (pp. 90–97) talk about sentiocentrism.\n\nSentiocentrism is a term contained in the \"Encyclopedia of Animal Rights and Animal Welfare\", edited by Marc Bekoff.\n\nIn the animal kingdom, there is a gradation in the nervous complexity, taking examples from the marine sponges that lack neurons, intestinal worms with ~ 300 neurons or humans with ~ 86 billion. While the existence of neurons is not sufficient to demonstrate the existence of sentience in an animal, it is a necessary condition, without neurons there is no place where it can happen (and the fewer the neurons, the lower the maximum capacity of intelligence an organism).\n\nGradualist sentiocentrism states that more complex interests deserve more consideration than less complex moral interests. One implication of this premise is that the best interests of a simple organism does not deserve consideration before the non-best interest in a complex organism (e.g., a dog with intestinal worms should be healed even though this results in the death of the parasites). Note that this does not lead to the rejection of interests of complex animals (such as pigs) versus the human desire to feed on them.\n\nThis is a vision that expands to areas that are not only relevant to other species, but uniquely to human issues, as is the case on the legalization of abortion. Gradualism poses a greater consideration of the mother against the fetus in question, given that the latter does not have the ability to own even remotely complex (at least in the early stages of gestation) interests. An emblematic case in this debate is the evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins, who says that \"a human embryo in early stage, without nervous system and presumably lacking pain and fear, could justifiably be afforded less moral protection than an adult pig, which it is clearly well equipped to suffer\".\n\n"}

The Shamashana Adhiapati literally translates to Lord of Shmashana. The name \"Shmashan Adhipathi\" is given to different deities in Hinduism and Tibetan Buddhism.\n\nAs per Hindu scripts Lord Shiva is considered to be lord of Shmashana or \"Shmashana Adhipati\". One epithet for Shiva is \"inhabitant of the cremation ground\" (Sanskrit: śmaśānavāsin, also spelled Shmashanavasin), referring to this connection. Also Kali, his consort is known by another name Shmashama Kali. Kali's association with blackness stands in contrast to her consort, Shiva, whose body is covered by the white ashes of the cremation ground (Sanskrit: śmaśāna) in which he meditates, and with which Kali is also associated, as śmaśāna-kālī.Shmashana Kali\nis also a protector.She can be used to chase away bad spirits. Thus, together Shiva and Kali are they deity associated with Shamshana as per Hindu religion are called Shmashana Adhipati. Also Bhairava, another manifestation of Shiva and his consort Bhairavi are said to live in Shamshana. Also the famous Mahavidya of Hindu and Tantric cult are said to rule over Smashan.\n\nIn Tantrik cult, Shmashana, emerged to be a main area of their experiments called Shava sadhana. Aghoris and Kapalika are some of the people who indulge in such rituals in Shamshana. They invoke Kali, Tara, Yogini, Chausath Yogini, Dakini, Bhairava, Bhairavi and ghosts like Vetala, Pishacha, Brahm-Rakshasha and worship them, give them sacrifices in Shamshana to have occult powers. They consider these deities as Shmashana Adhipati.\n\nFurther, as per Tibetan Buddhist script a couple known as \"Shmashana Adhipati\" (Standard Tibetan: pal dur tro dag po yab yum. English: the Glorious Lords of the Charnel Ground - Father-Mother) also called \"Chitipati\" is considered lord of Shamshana. They arise from the \"Secret Essence Wheel Tantra\" and is associated with the collection/cycle of Cakrasaṃvara Tantra. Primarily employed as a wealth practice, with emphasis on protecting from thieves, they also serve as the special protector for the Vajrayogini 'Naro Khechari' practice. Shri Shmashana Adhipati is now common, to a greater or lesser extent, in all the New (Sarma) Schools of Himalayan and Tibetan influenced Buddhism. It is important not to confuse the protector deities Shri Shmashana Adhipati, Father & Mother, with the skeleton dancers found in the various systems of Tibetan religious Cham dance. The word \"Chitipati\" again has its origin from word \"Chita\" (funeral pyre as per Hindu rites). \n\nDakini, Shakini and some other tantric deities, associated both with Hinduism and Tibetan Buddhism, are said to roam in Shmashana.\n"}

The document specifically states that it is aimed at bishops, priests, religious and other pastoral workers in hopes of pastoral caregivers paying greater attention to expressions of human mobility. The document derived some of its material from the Old Testament, the New Testament, the American Automobile Association, and statements by Popes Pius XII, John XXIII, Paul VI and John Paul II.\n\nOn its issue this document received a lot of media attention due to its listing of Ten Commandments for Drivers. In essence, the Vatican is pointing out that the act of driving has a moral and ethical component. The Guidelines make note of both the benefits of the use of automobiles as well as its dangerous and negative consequences. The problem is not as pervasive in the Vatican City itself, which has a speed limit of 30 km/h (18-19 mph) and approximately only 1000 cars; but there were over 35 million deaths resulting from car accidents in the 20th century, and the Vatican is responding. In the same section of the document as the Drivers' Ten Commandments are the so-called Christian virtues of drivers, which include prudence, justice and hope.\n\nThe Guidelines not only deal with problems on the road, but also address prostitution, caring for street children and the homeless, found in Parts Two, Three and Four of the Guidelines.\n\nThe Guidelines state that driving can bring out primitive behavior in drivers, which leads to road rage, rude gestures, speeding, drinking behind the wheel, cursing, blasphemy, impoliteness, and intentional violation of the highway code. The Guidelines encourage drivers to obey the highway code, pray behind the wheel and recite the rosary, which the Guidelines insist would not distract the driver's attention.\n\nThe following are the ten commandments for drivers.\n"}

{"id": "48410331", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48410331", "title": "Transcendental whistling", "text": "Transcendental whistling\n\nChángxiào 長嘯 or transcendental whistling was an ancient Daoist technique of long-drawn, resounding whistling that functioned as a yogic or transcendental exercise. A skillful whistler could supposedly summon animals, communicate with supernatural beings, and control weather phenomena. Transcendental whistling is a common theme in Chinese literature, for instance Chenggong Sui's (3rd century) \"Xiaofu\" 嘯賦 \"Rhapsody on Whistling\" and Ge Fei 's (1989) \"Hūshào\" 忽哨 \"Whistling\" short story. The most famous transcendental whistlers lived during the 3rd century, including the last master Sun Deng, and two of the eccentric Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove, Ruan Ji and Ji Kang, all of whom were also talented zitherists.\n\nThe Chinese language has two common words meaning \"to whistle\": \"xiào\" 嘯 or 啸 \"whistle; howl; roar; wail\" and \"shào\" 哨 \"warble; chirp; whistle; sentry\". Word usage of \"xiào\" 嘯 (first occurring in the c. 10th century BCE \"Shijing\", below) is historically older than \"shào\" 哨 (first in the c. 2nd century BCE \"Liji\" describing a pitch-pot's \"wry mouth\", tr. Legge 1885: 397). Both Chinese characters are written with the mouth radical 口 and phonetic indicators of \"sù\" 肅 \"shrivel; contract\" and \"xiāo\" 肖 \"like; similar\". The 16-stroke character 嘯 has graphically simpler versions of 14-stroke 嘨 and 11-stroke 啸, and an ancient variant character \"xiao\" 歗 (with the yawn radical 欠).\n\nThe etymology of Old Chinese *\"siûh\" 嘯 \"to whistle: to croon\" is sound symbolic, with cognates of Proto-Tibeto-Burman language *\"hyu\" or *\"huy\" \"whistle\" and Chepang language \"syu-\" \"blow through (hand, etc.)\" (Schuessler 2007: 422).\n\nThis same onomatopoeic and semantic \"sù\" < *\"siuk\" 肅 \"shrivel; contract\" element is also used to write \"xiāo\" 簫 \"bamboo flute\" (with the bamboo radical ⺮), \"xiāoxiāo\" 蕭蕭 \"rustling sound (of falling leaves); whistling (of wind); whinnying (of horses)\" (with the plant radical 艹), and \"xiāoxiāo\" 瀟瀟 \"whistling (of wind) and pattering (of rain)\" (with the water radical 氵).\n\nThe (121 CE) \"Shuowen Jiezi\" dictionary uses \"chuī\" 吟 \"blow; puff; play (a wind instrument)\" to explicate \"xiao\"; defining \"xiao\" 嘯 as 吹聲也 \"to make sound by blowing\", and \"xiao\" 歗 as 吟也 \"to blow\" (citing the \"Shijing\" 22, below).\n\nThe semantic field of \"xiào\" in Modern Standard Chinese includes human whistling and singing (for instance, \"xiàojiào\" 嘯叫 \"whistle\", \"yínxiào\" 吟嘯 \"sing in freedom; lament; sigh\", \"xiàogē\" 嘯歌 \"sing at full voice\"), whistling sounds (\"hūxiào\" 呼嘯 \"whistle; scream; whiz (arrow)\", \"xiàoshēng\" 嘯聲 \"whistle; squeak; squeal; howl\", \"hǎixiào\" 海嘯 \"tsunami; tidal wave\"), animal sounds (\"hǔxiào\" 虎嘯 \"tiger's roar\", \"yuánxiào\" 猿嘯 \"monkey's cry\", \"xiàodiāo\" 嘯雕 \"whistling kite\"), Daoistic counterculture (\"xiào'ào\" 嘯傲 \"be forthright in speech and action; be leisurely and carefree\", \"xiào'àoshānquán\" 嘯傲山泉 \"lead a hermit's life in the woods and by a stream\", \"xiàojù shānlín\" 嘯聚山林 \"form a band and take to the forests\"), and the present Daoist transcendental whistling (\"chángxiào\" 長嘯 \"utter a long and loud cry; whistle\", \"yǎngtiānchángxiào\" 仰天長嘯 \"cry out at length to heaven; make a long throaty noise in the open air\"). Donald Holzman (2009: 151) says \"xiao\" \"has a distracting range of meanings, clustered around the basic idea of 'producing sound through puckered lips', from the lion's roar to a man's whistling, passing through vocalization, chanting or wailing.\"\n\nThe \"Hanyu Da Cidian\" unabridged Chinese dictionary defines two meanings for \"chángxiào\" 长啸 or 長嘯: 大声呼叫，发出高而长的声音 \"Call out in a loud voice, issue a long, high-pitched sound\", and 撮口发出悠长清越的声音 \"Protrude the lips and issue a long, drawn-out, clear, and far-carrying sound\".\n\nWhile the English lexicon has diverse whistling vocabulary, such as whistled language and whistle register, it lacks a standard translation equivalent for Chinese \"changxiao\", literally \"long whistle/whistling\". Direct translations fail to denote the word's supernatural aspects: \"whistling without a break\" (Giles 1948), \"long whistle\" (Kroll 1983), \"prolonged whistle\" (Egan 1994), and \"long piercing whistle\" (Hegel 1998). Explanatory translations are more meaningful to English readers; the commonly used \"transcendental whistling\" was coined by Victor Mair (1996, 1998) and adopted by other authors (e.g., Minford 2014—\"and\" many famous whistlers were \"xian\" \"transcendents\"). Some less common renderings are \"cosmic 'whistling'\" (Chan 1996), \"Taoist mediative [sic] whistle\" (Hegel 1998), and \"cosmic whistle\" (Varsano 1999).\n\nThe semantic field of \"shào\" includes whistling sounds and whistle instruments (for instance, \"hūshào\" 呼/忽/唿哨 \"to whistle\", \"húshào\" 胡哨 \"a whistle signal\", \"kǒushào(r)\" 口哨 \"a whistle (instrument and sound)\", \"shàozi\" 哨子 \"a whistle\"), birds (\"niǎoshào\" 鳥哨 \"birdcall\", \"shàoyīng\" 哨鷹 \"chanting goshawk\", \"gēshào\" 鴿哨 \"whistle tied to a pigeon\"), and (whistle-signaling) guards (\"shàobīng\" 哨兵 \"sentinel; sentry; guard\", \"fàngshào\" 放哨 \"to stand sentry\", \"liàowàngshào\" 瞭望哨 \"watchtower; lookout post\").\n\nThe common \"whistle\" term \"hūshào\" (for which \"hū\" can be written 呼 \"exhale; shout\", 忽 \"disdainful; sudden\", or 唿 \"sad\") refers to a type of shrill, forceful finger whistling that is often mentioned in traditional Chinese short stories and novels of the Ming and Qing periods as a kind of remote signaling or calling (Mair 1998:43).\n\nThe Chinese classics provide a means of tracing the semantic developments of \"xiao\" from \"wail\", to \"call back\", to \"whistle\". The earliest usages in the Western Zhou dynasty (1046–771 BCE) \"Shijing\" \"Classic of Poetry\" described the sound of women expressing high emotion or grief. The Warring States period (c. 475 – 221 BCE) \"Chuci\" \"Songs of the South\" used \"xiao\" and \"changxiao\" to mean a piercing whistle or call to summon back the spirit or a recently deceased person. The (1st century BCE) \"Liexian Zhuan\" \"Collected Biographies of Transcendents\" first associated transcendental whistling with Daoism, as represented by the Madman of Chu who mocked Confucius.\n\nDuring the Eastern Han (25–220 CE) and Jin dynasty (265–420) \"xiao\" and \"changxiao\" whistling became especially associated with Daoism. For example, the \"Hou Hanshu\" (82, tr. DeWoskin 1983: 77) biography of Xu Deng 徐登 mentions his companion Zhao Bing 趙柄 whistling to call up wind. \"On another occasion, he was seeking passage across a river, but the boat man would not take him. [Bing] spread out a cloth and sat in the middle of it. Then with a long whistle he stirred up winds [長肅呼風] and whipped up wild currents which carried him across.\"\n\nLater texts associated \"(chang)xiao\" transcendental whistling with Daoist inner-breath yoga techniques and \"qi\"-circulation. Daoist meditation and healing use a breathing technique called \"Liuqi fa\" 六氣法 \"Method of the Six Breaths\" that is practiced in various ways. The Six Breaths are \"si\" 嘶 \"hissing with the lips wide and teeth together\", \"he\" 呵 \"guttural rasping with mouth wide open\", \"hu\" 呼 \"blowing out the breath with rounded lips\", \"xu\" 嘘 \"gently whistling with pursed lips\", \"chui\" 吹 \"sharply expelling the air with the lips almost closed\", and \"xi\" 嘻 \"sighing with mouth slightly open\" (Kohn 2012: 233).\n\nSu (2006: 29, 32) calls the Six Dynasties (222-589) the \"golden age of whistling\". \"Xiao\" seems to have permeated all strata of Six Dynasties society, and practitioners included persons from almost all walks of life: recluses, hermit-scholars, generals, Buddhist monks, non-Chinese foreigners, women, high society elite, and Daoist priests. \"In general, poets, hermits, and people of all types in the Six Dynasties utilized whistling to express a sense of untrammeled individual freedom, or an attitude of disobedience to authority or traditional ceremony, or to dispel suppressed feelings and indignation.\"\n\nAncient superstitions about whistling continue in Chinese folklore. In the present day, some Han Chinese consider it taboo to whistle in the house at night for fear of provoking ghosts, and similarly, the minority Maonan people and Kam people (mostly in South Central China) believe that whistling while working in the fields will invoke demons to damage the harvest (Su 2006: 28).\n\nThe earliest recorded textual usage of \"xiao\" 嘯 or 歗 meant \"wail\" not \"whistle\". Three (c. 10th-7th century BCE) \"Shijing\" \"Classic of Poetry\" odes use \"xiao\" to describe heartbroken women expressing sadness. Since the ancient, lyrical language of the \"Shijing\" can be difficult to interpret, the English translations of James Legge (1976), Arthur Waley (1937), and Bernhard Karlgren (1950) are cited.\n\nTwo odes use \"xiao\" 嘯 along with \"gē\" 歌 \"sing; song\". \nOde 22 江有汜 \"The Yangzi Splits and Joins\" is interpreted as concubines who were not allowed to accompany their bride to her new home, [江有沱]之子歸不我過 不我過其嘯也歌, translated as:\nWaley says the last words \"are certainly corrupt\" and suggests 宿也可 \"allow to lodge\". Karlgren explains \"She can do nothing but croon (wail) and resign herself to it.\"\n\nOde 229 \"White Flowers\" uses \"xiaoge\" to describe a wife whose husband is gone, 嘯歌傷懷念彼碩人:\nThese translators agree that \"ge\" means \"sing; song\" but differ over whether \"xiao\" means \"whistle\", \"chant\", and \"croon; wail\".\n\nOde 69 \"In the Midst of the Valley are Motherworts\" uses the graphic variant \"xiao\" 歗, interpreted as \"groan\", \"sob\", or \"weep\", describing another separated couple, 有女仳離條其嘯矣:\nBased on these \"Shijing\" contexts, (Su 2006: 16) says \"xiao\" means \"to whistle\" and is related to singing and chanting in general.\n\nBernhard Karlgren's (1964: 104-105) detailed \"Shijing\" gloss concludes \"xiao\" means \"wail; groan\" instead of \"whistle\". The Han version commentary says \"xiao\" means 歌無章曲 \"to sing without stanzas or (fixed) melody, i.e., \"to croon\", thus \"When she croons she sings\" = \"crooningly she sings\"; Zheng Xuan's commentary to the Mao version says it means 蹙口而出聲 \"to compress the mouth and emit a sound\", i.e., \"to whistle\", \"When she whistles she sings (=) she whistles and sings\". Zhu Xi says \"xiaohu\" 嘯呼 means \"sù\" or \"sòu\" 嗖 \"wail; whiz\". Karlgren notes that \"xiao\" can mean either \"to whistle\" or \"to croon; to wail\"; citing the \"Liji\" 不嘯不指 \"He does not whistle, nor point with the finger\" and \"Huainanzi\" 黃神嘯吟 \"The yellow spirit wails and moans\".\n\nLike the \"Shijing\", Han and Six Dynasties texts frequently associated whistling with women expressing their sorrows. The \"Lienu zhuan\" \"Biographies of Exemplary Women\" (Su 2006: 17) has a story about a secretly wise \"Girl from Qishi 漆室 in Lu\" (modern Zoucheng, Shandong). The girl was leaning against a pillar and whistling [倚柱而嘯]. Her neighbor heard and asked if she was whistling sadly because she longed for a husband, which the neighbor offered to arrange. The girl answered that she was not worried about getting a husband, but was worried because the ruler of Lu was old and but the crown prince was still too young. As the girl feared, Lu fell into chaos and was invaded by neighboring states.\n\nThe (c. 3rd century BCE-2nd century CE) \"Chuci\" \"Songs of Chu\" uses \"xiao\" to mean \"call back (a dead person's soul)\", monkey and tiger \"calls; roars\", and \"whistle; call out\".\n\nThe earliest textual example of \"xiao\" meaning \"to summon a spirit\" is in the \"Zhaohun\" \"Summons of the Soul\", which describes a shamanistic ritual to resuscitate a recently deceased person by calling back their \"hun\" \"spiritual soul that leaves the body after death\", as opposed to their \"po\" \"corporal soul that remains with the deceased corpse\". This poem uses the compound \"xiàohū\" 嘯呼 with \"shout; call\"\nO soul, come back! And enter the gate of the city. Skilled priests are there who call you, walking backwards to lead you in. Qin basket-work, silk cords of Qi, and silken banners of Zheng: All things are there proper for your recall; and with long-drawn, piercing cries they summon the wandering soul [永嘯呼些]. O soul, come back! Return to your old abode. (tr. Hawkes 1985: 105) \nWang Yi’s commentary invokes yin and yang theory. \"\"Xiao\" has \"yin\" characteristics, and \"hu\" has \"yang\" characteristics. \"Yang\" governs the \"hun\" spiritual soul, and \"yin\" governs the \"po\" animal soul. Thus, in order to summon the whole being, one must \"xiaohu\". Karlgren (1964: 104-105) translates \"Long-drawn I (croon:) wail\". David Hawkes (1986: 219-220) notes that the \"Yili\" ritual handbook section on \"zhaohun\" \"soul-summoning\" does not mention the shamanistic \"xiao\" \"whistling\" found in the \"Chuci\", and suggests that the Confucian ritualist who compiled the text \"evidently did not expect this somewhat perfunctory soul-summoning to be successful.\" The \"Yili\" says the soul-summoner should take a suit of clothing formerly worn by the deceased, climb a ladder to the roof, stretch out the clothes, get up on the roof ridge, and \"call out three times in a loud voice, 'Ho, \"Such a One\"! Come back!\" Then he hands the clothing down to an assistant, who puts it on the corpse for viewing, and then the summoner climbs back down.\n\n\"Zhaoyinshi\" \"Summons for a Recluse\" uses \"xiao\" describing the calls of \"yuanyou\" 猿狖 \"gibbons\".\nThe cassia trees grow thick In the mountain's recesses, Their branches interlacing. The mountain mists are high, The rocks are steep. In the sheer ravines The waters' waves run deep. Monkeys in chorus cry; Tigers and leopards roar [猿狖群嘯兮虎豹原]. One has climbed up by the cassia boughs Who wishes to tarry there. (tr. Hawkes 1985: 244) \n\n\"Miujian\" \"Reckless Remonstrance\" uses \"xiao\" for a tiger's \"roar\", among examples of \"ganying\" \"correlative resonance\".\nLike sounds harmonize together; Creatures mate with their own kind. The flying bird cries out to the flock; The deer calls, searching for his friends. If you strike \"gong\", then \"gong\" responds; If you hit \"jue\", then \"jue\" vibrates. The tiger roars, and the wind of the valley comes [虎嘯而谷風至兮]; The dragon soars, and the radiant clouds come flying. (tr. Hawkes 1985: 257) \n\n\"Sigu\" \"Sighing for Olden Times\", which is attributed to the \"Chuci\" editor Liu Xiang, uses \"xiao\" meaning \"whistle; call out\". \nI think how my homeland has been brought to ruin, And the ghosts of my ancestors robbed of their proper service. I grieve that the line of my father's house is broken; My heart is dismayed and laments within me. I shall wander a while upon the sides of the mountain, And walk about upon the river's banks. I shall look down, whistling, on the deep waters [臨深水而長嘯兮], Wander far and wide, looking all about me. (tr. Hawkes 1985: 298) \n\nLiu An's (c. 139 BCE) \"Huainanzi\" \"Masters of Huainan\", which is a compendium of writings from various schools of Chinese philosophy, has two \"xiao\" \"howl; wail; moan\" usages, which clearly exclude \"whistle\" (Karlgren 1964: 105).\n\nThe \"Celestial Patterns\" chapter uses \"xiao\" \"roar\" in a context giving examples of \"yin\"-\"yang\" \"ganying\" resonance, including the Chinese sun and moon mirrors \"yangsui\" 陽燧 \"burning mirror\" and \"fangzhu\" 方諸 \"square receptacle\".\nFire flies upward; water flows downward. Thus, the flight of birds is aloft; the movement of fishes is downward. Things within the same class mutually move one another; root and twig mutually respond to each other. Therefore, when the burning mirror sees the sun, it ignites tinder and produces fire. When the square receptacle sees the moon, it moistens and produces water. When the tiger roars, the valley winds rush [虎嘯而穀風至]; when the dragon arises, the bright clouds accumulate. When \"qilins\" wrangle, the sun or moon is eclipsed; when the leviathan dies, comets appear. When silkworms secrete fragmented silk, the \"shang\" string [of a stringed instrument] snaps. When meteors fall, the Bohai surges upward. (3.2, tr. Major et al. 2010: 116) \n\nThe \"Huainanzi\" \"Surveying Obscurities\" chapter uses \"xiao\" \"moan\" referring to people suffering under the legendary tyrant Jie of Xia.\nThe honorific names \"Xilao\" 西老 \"Western Elder\" and \"Huangshen\" 黃神 \"Yellow God\" refer to the Queen Mother of the West and Yellow Emperor.\n\nThe Daoist \"Liexian Zhuan\" \"Collected Biographies of Transcendents\", edited by Liu Xiang (c. 79-8 BCE), uses \"changxiao\" in the hagiography of Lu Tong 陸通 (better known as Lu Jieyu, or Jie Yu 接輿, the madman of Chu).\n\nThe story of Lu Jieyu meeting Confucius (551-479 BCE) is well known. The first version is in the Confucian \"Lunyu\". \nChieh Yü, the madman of Ch'u, came past Master K'ung, singing as he went: \"Oh phoenix, phoenix How dwindled is your power! As to the past, reproof is idle, But the future may yet be remedied. Desist, desist! Great in these days is the peril of those who fill office.\" Master K'ung got down [from his carriage], desiring to speak with him; but the madman hastened his step and got away, so that Master K'ung did not succeed in speaking with him. (tr. Waley 1938: 219) \nThe Daoist \"Zhuangzi\" gives an anti-Confucian version.\nWhen Confucius went to Ch'u, Chieh Yü, the madman of Ch'u, wandered about before his gate, saying:\n\"Phoenix! Oh, Phoenix! How your virtue has declined! The future you cannot wait for, The past you cannot pursue. When the Way prevails under heaven, The Sage seeks for accomplishment; When the Way is absent from the world, The sage seeks but to preserve his life. In an age like that of today, All he can hope for is to avoid punishment. …\" (tr. Mair 1994: 40-41)\n\nThe \"Liexian zhuan\" entry about the feigned \"madman\" says.\nLu Tong was the madman of Chu, Jieyu. He loved nourishing life, his food was beggarticks, wax-myrtles, and turnips. Lu traveled to famous mountains, and was sighted over many generations on the peak of Mount Emei, where he lived for several hundred years before departing. Jieyu delighted in talking about nourishing the inner nature and concealing one's brilliance. His custom was to mock Confucius, and proclaim a decline in [the virtue of] the phoenix. He matched breaths with harmony and cherished the abstruse. He strode across lofty mountains, and transcendentally whistled on Mount Emei. [陸通者雲楚狂接輿也 好養生食橐廬木實及蕪菁子 游諸名山在蜀峨嵋山上世世見之歷數百年去 接輿樂道養性潛輝 風諷尼父諭以鳳衰 納氣以和存心以微 高步靈岳長嘯峨嵋]\n\nThe \"Xiaofu\" 嘯賦 \"Rhapsody on Whistling\" was written by Chenggong Sui 成公綏 (231-273), a renowned Jin dynasty (265-420) author of \"fu\" \"rhapsody; poetic exposition\" rhymed prose. The Heian period scholar-official Sugawara no Kiyotomo's (814) \"Ryōunshū\" poetry collection includes his Japanese \"Shōfu\" 嘯賦 \"Rhapsody on Whistling\" (Su 2006: 41).\n\nThe (648) \"Book of Jin\" (92) biography of Chenggong Sui is the primary source about his life and writing the prose-poem \"Xiaofu\". Sui, whose courtesy name was Zi'an 子安, was a native of Boma 白馬 in the Eastern Commandery 東郡 (present day Hua County, Henan). As a youth, he read widely in the classics, and had a great talent for writing beautiful \"fu\". Sui especially loved musical temperament [音律]. Once during hot weather, he received instruction/enlightenment from the wind and whistled [承風而嘯], making his tune cool and clear [泠然成曲]. Following this, he composed the \"Hsiao fu\" [… quoting full text]. The poet-official Zhang Hua regarded Chenggong Sui's writings as peerless and recommended him as an official. Sui served as Chancellor to the Minister of Ceremonies and Palace Writer Attendant. He died in 273 at the age of 43.\n\nThe Rhapsody on Whistling begins with an idealized recluse who retires from the world with a group of friends to learn Daoist secrets through techniques of transcendental whistling, with which the whistler expresses his disdain toward the vulgar world, and releases his indignation and suffering (Su 2006: 37).\nThe secluded gentleman, In sympathy with the extraordinary, And in love with the strange, Scorns the world and is unmindful of prestige. He breaks away from human endeavor and leaves it behind. He gazes up at the lofty, longing for the days of old; He ponders lengthily, his thoughts wandering afar. He would Climb Mount Chi, in order to maintain his moral integrity; Or float on the blue sea to wander with his ambition.\n\nSo he invites his trusted friends, Gathering about himself a group of like-minded. He gets at the essence of the ultimate secret of life; He researches the subtle mysteries of Tao and Te. He regrets that the common people are not yet enlightened; He alone, transcending all, has prior awakening. He finds constraining the narrow road of the world – He gazes up at the concourse of heaven, and treads the high vastness. Distancing himself from the exquisite and the common, he abandons his personal concerns; Then, filled with noble emotion, he gives a long-drawn whistle [乃慷慨而長嘯].\n\nThereupon, The dazzling spirit inclines its luminous form, Pouring its brilliance into Vesper's Vale. And his friends, rambling hand in hand, Stumble to a halt, stepping on their toes. He sends forth marvelous tones from his red lips, And stimulates mournful sounds from his gleaming teeth. The sound rises and falls, rolling in his throat. The breath rushes out and is repressed, then flies up like sparks [氣衝鬱而熛起]. He harmonizes [the notes of the Chinese pentatonic scale] 'golden \"kung\"' with 'sharp \"chiao\",' Blending \"shang\" and \"yü\" into 'flowing \"chih\".' The whistle floats like a wandering cloud in the grand empyrean, And gathers a great wind for a myriad miles. When the song is finished, and the echoes die out, It leaves behind a pleasure that lingers on in the mind. Indeed, whistling is the most perfect natural music, Which cannot be imitated by strings or woodwinds.\n\nThus, the Whistler Uses no instrument to play his music, Nor any material borrowed from things. He chooses it from the near-at-hand—his own Self, And with his mind he controls his breath [役心御氣]. (tr. White 1994: 429-430) \nIn this context, Mair (1994: 430) notes that \"shen\" 身 \"body; person\" means \"Self\" in the sense of Daoist meditation. \"The whistler finds the music and the means of producing it within himself … Everything is available within the Self. The breath and the mind are closely linked. By cultivating the flow of his attention, he simultaneously gains control over the flow of his breath.\"\n\nThe Rhapsody then elaborates on transcendental whistling. It spontaneously harmonizes with the world, \"For every category he has a song; To each thing he perceives, he tunes a melody.\"; \"Thus, the Whistler can Create tones based on the forms, Compose melodies in accordance to affairs; Respond without limit to the things of Nature.\" (tr. White 1994: 430, 432). The marvelous sounds affect both the whistler, \"Pure, surpassing both reed and mouth-organ; Richly harmonious with lute and harp. Its mystery is subtle enough to unfold fully pure consciousness and enlighten creative intelligence.\"; and the listener, \"Though you be lost in thoughts, it can bring you back to your Mind; Though you be distressed, it will never break your Heart.\" (tr. White 1994: 431). \nShould he then Imitate gong and drum, or mime clay vessels and gourds; here is a mass of sound like many instruments playing – Like reed pipe and flute of bamboo [\"xiao\" 簫] – Bumping boulders trembling, An horrendous crashing, smashing, breaking. Or should he Sound the tone \"chih\", then severe winter becomes steaming hot; Give free play to \"yü\", then a sharp frost makes summer fade; Move into \"shang\", then a long autumn rain appears to fall in springtime; Strike up the tone \"chiao\", then a vernal breeze soughs in the bare branches. (tr. White 1994: 433) \nChenggong Sui obviously understood the technical aspects of the pentatonic scale and the relationship of musical notes and pitch standards (Goodman 2010: 139).\n\nThe Rhapsody on Whistling concludes by describing famous musicians, singers, and animals all enthralled by hearing the whistler's performance, and uses \"changxiao\" again, \"They understand the magnificent beauty of the long-drawn Whistle [乃知長嘯之奇妙]; Indeed, this is the most perfect of sounds.\" (tr. White 1994: 434).\n\nThis prose-poem has many Daoist elements besides researching \"the subtle mysteries of Tao and Te\" (above). Transcendental whistling is presented as a powerful method of self-cultivation through breath control. The statement that \"with his mind he controls his breath\" uses the Daoist term \"yùqì\" 御氣 \"control the breath; move \"qi\" through the body\", further described as,\nThe [eight] sounds and [five] harmonies constantly fluctuate; The melody follows no strict beat. It runs, but does not run off. It stops, but does not stop up. Following his mouth and lips, he expands forth. Floating on his fragrant breath, he wanders afar [假芳氣而遠逝]. The music is, in essence, subtle with flowing echoes. The sound races impetuously, but with a harsh clarity. Indeed, with its supreme natural beauty, It is quite strange and other-worldly. (tr. White 1994: 434) \n\"Fangqi\" 芳氣 \"fragrant breath\" is a Daoist metaphor for \"meide\" 美德 \"beautiful virtues\".\n\nGe Hong's (c. 4th century) Daoist \"Shenxian zhuan\" \"Biographies of Divine Transcendents\" has two hagiographies that mention supernatural whistling powers; Liu Gen 劉根 could summon ghosts, and Liu Zheng 劉政 could summon powerful winds.\n\nFirst, the hagiography of the Han dynasty (206 BCE-220 CE) \"fangshi\" Liu Gen 劉根 says he saved himself from punishment by \"changxiao\" whistling to summon the prosecutor's family ghosts who insisted on his freedom. \nLiu Gen, styled Jun'an 君安, was a native of the capital at Chang'an. As a youth he understood the Five Classics. During the second year of the \"suihe\" period of Han Emperor Cheng's reign [7 BCE], he was selected as a Filial and lncorrupt and was made a Gentleman of the Interior. Later he left the world behind and practiced the Way. He entered a cave on Mount Songgao that was situated directly above a sheer cliff over fifty thousand feet high. Winter or summer, he wore no clothing. The hair on his body grew one to two feet long. … Commandant Zhang, the new governor, took Liu Gen to be a fake, and he sent lictors to summon him, plotting to have him killed. … The commandant ordered over fifty men brandishing swords and pikes to tie Liu up and stand him at attention. Liu's face showed no change in color. The commandant interrogated Liu as follows: \"So, do you possess any arts of the Dao?\" \"Yes.\" \"Can you summon ghosts?\" \"I can.\" \"Since you can,\" said the commandant, \"you will bring ghosts before this chamber bench at once. If you do not, I will have you tortured and killed.\" Liu replied, \"Causing ghosts to appear is quite easy.\" Liu Gen borrowed a brush and an inkstone and composed a memorial. [In a moment,] a clanging sound like that of bronze or iron could be heard outside, and then came a long whistling sound, extremely plangent [因長嘯嘯音非常清亮]. All who heard it were awestruck [聞者莫不肅然], and the visitors all shook with fear. In another moment, an opening several dozen feet wide appeared in the south wall of the chamber, and four hundred or five hundred armored troops could be seen passing orders down the lines. Several dozen crimson-clad swordsmen then appeared, escorting a carriage straight through the opened wall into the chamber. The opened wall then returned to its former state. Liu Gen ordered the attendants to present the ghosts. With that, the crimson-clad guards flung back the shroud covering the carriage to reveal an old man and an old woman tightly bound inside. They hung their heads before the chamber bench. Upon examining them closely, the commandant saw that they were his deceased father and mother. Shocked and dismayed, he wept and was completely at a loss. The ghosts reprimanded him, saying, \"When we were alive, you had not yet attained office, so we received no nourishment from your salary. Now that we are dead, what do you mean by offending a venerable official among divine transcendents and getting us arrested? After causing such a difficulty as this, aren't you ashamed even to stand among other people?\" The commandant came down the steps and knocked his head on the ground before Liu Gen, saying that he deserved to die and begging that his ancestors be pardoned and released. Liu ordered the five hundred troops to take out the prisoners and release them. As the carriage moved out, the wall opened back up; then, when it was outside, the wall closed again and the carriage was nowhere to be seen. Liu had also disappeared. (tr. Campany 2002: 240-242) \nRobert Ford Campany notes, \"The whistlers may be not the ghosts of the departed but the spirit-officials who are ushering them along. Esoteric techniques of whistling numbered among Daoist arts.\"\n\nIn the \"History of the Latter Han\" version of this story, it is Liu Gen himself who does the \"xiao\" rather than \"changxiao\" whistling. \nLiu Gen was a native of Yingchuan. He dwelt in seclusion on Mount Song. Curiosity seekers came from afar to study the Dao with him. The Governor Shi Qi 史祈 took him for a charlatan and had him arrested and brought in to his offices. He questioned him, saying, \"What arts do you have, that you mislead and deceive the people so? You will perform a confirmatory feat, or else you will die at once.\" Liu said, \"I truly have no unusual powers, except that I have some small ability to cause people to see ghosts.\" \"Summon one right now,\" Shi said, \"so that I can see it with my own eyes, and only then will I take it as clearly established.\" At this, Liu Gen looked to the left and whistled [左顧而嘯]. In a moment, Shi's deceased father, along with several dozen of his departed relatives, appeared before them, bound. They knocked their heads on the ground toward Liu and said, \"Our son has acted wrongly and should be punished!\" Then they turned to Shi Qi and said, \"As a descendant, not only do you bring no benefit to your ancestors, but you bring trouble to us departed spirits! Knock your head on the ground and beg forgiveness for us!\" Shi Qi, stricken with fear and remorse, knocked his head until it ran blood and begged to take the punishment for his crime himself Liu Gen remained silent and made no reply. Suddenly he [and the ghosts] all vanished. (tr. Campany 2002: 249) \n\nSecond, the hagiography of Liu Zheng 劉政, who lived to an age of more than 180 years, uses \"chuīqì\" 吹氣 \"blow one's breath\" to mean \"whistle up (wind)\".\n\nThe (5th century) \"Shishuo Xinyu\" version of this whistling story about Ruan Ji visiting the unnamed Sun Deng, referred to as the \"zhenren\" \"perfected person\" in the Sumen Mountains 蘇門山.\nWhen Juan Chi whistled [嘯], he could be heard several hundred paces away. In the Su-men Mountains (Honan) there appeared from nowhere a Realized Man [真人] about whom the woodcutters were all relaying tales. Juan Chi went to see for himself and spied the man squatting with clasped knees by the edge of a cliff. Chi climbed the ridge to approach him and then squatted opposite him. Chi rehearsed for him briefly matters from antiquity to the present, beginning with an exposition of the Way of Mystical Quiescence [玄寂] of the Yellow Emperor and Shen Nung, and ending with an investigation of the excellence of the Supreme Virtue [盛德] of the Three Ages (Hsia, Shang, and Chou). But when Chi asked his opinion about it he remained aloof and made no reply. Chi then went on to expound that which lies beyond Activism [有為之教], and the techniques of Resting the Spirit [棲神] and Conducting the Vital Force [導氣]. But when Chi looked toward him for a reply, he was still exactly as before, fixedly staring without turning. Chi therefore turned toward him and made a long whistling sound [長嘯]. After a long while the man finally laughed and said, \"Do it again.\" Chi whistled a second time [復嘯], but as his interest was now exhausted, he withdrew. He had returned about half-way down the ridge when he heard above him a shrillness like an orchestra of many instruments, while forests and valleys reechoed with the sound. Turning back to look, he discovered it was the whistling of the man he had just visited [向人嘯]. (49, tr. Mather 1976: 331) \nHolzman (2009: 152) says that when Ruan Ji whistles, Sun Deng realizes that he is \"not merely a pedant, but also an adept of an art that imitates nature, that he is able to control his breath so as to make it resemble that very breath of heaven.\"\n\nThe \"Shishuo xinyu\" commentary by Liu Xiaobiao quotes two texts. First, the (4th century) \"Wei Shi Chunqiu\" 魏氏春秋 version says,\nJuan Chi often went riding alone wherever his fancy led him, not following the roads or byways, to the point where carriage tracks would go no farther, and always he would return weeping bitterly. Once while he was wandering in the Su-men Mountains there was a recluse living there whose name no one knew, and whose only possessions were a few \"hu\"-measures of bamboo fruit, a mortar and pestle, and nothing more. When Juan Chi heard of him he went to see him and began conversing on the Way of Non-action [無為] of high antiquity, and went on to discuss the moral principles [義] of the Five Emperors and Three August Ones. The Master of Su-men remained oblivious and never even looked his way. Chi then with a shrill sound made a long whistling whose echoes reverberated through the empty stillness. The Master of Su-men finally looked pleased and laughed. After Chi bad gone down the hill, the Master gathered his breath and whistled shrilly with a sound like that of the phoenix. Chi had all his life been a connoisseur of music, and he borrowed the theme of his discussion with the Master of Su-men to express what was in his heart in a song, the words of which are: \"The sun sets west of Mt. Pu-chou; The moon comes up from Cinnabar Pool. Essence of Yang is darkened and unseen; While Yin rays take their turn to win. His brilliance lasts but for a moment; her dark will soon again be full. If wealth and honor stay but for a trice must poverty and low estate be evermore?\" (tr. Mather 1976: 331-332) \nSecond, the \"Zhulin Qixian Lun\" 竹林七賢論 (tr. Mather 1976: 332), by Dai Kui 戴逵 (d. 396) explains, \"After Juan Chi returned (from the Su-men Mountains) he proceeded to compose the \"Discourse on Mr. Great Man\" [大人先生論]. What was said in this discourse all represented the basic feelings in his breast and heart. The main point was that Mr. Great Man was none other than Juan himself.\"\n\nIn addition, the \"Shishuo xinyu\" biography of Liu Daozhen 劉道真 says he was \"good at singing and whistling [善歌嘯]\".\n\nTwo chapters in the (648) \"Book of Jin\" record the meeting between Ruan Ji and Sun Deng.\n\nRuan Ji's biography (in chapter , Biographies) uses \"changxiao\" and \"xiao\" to describe his visit with Sun Deng.\nOnce [Juan] Chi met Sun Teng on Su-men Mountain [蘇門山]. [Juan Chi] touched on topics of ancient times, and on the arts of \"posing the spirit\" and \"leading the breath\" [棲神導氣之術]. [Sun] Teng kept silent throughout. As a result, [Juan] Chi expelled a long whistle [籍因長嘯而退], and took his leave. When he had descended halfway down the mountain, he heard a sound like the cry of the phoenix resounding throughout the peaks and valleys. It was the whistling of [Sun] Teng [乃登之嘯也]. (tr. Varsano 1999: 56)\nVarsano (1999: 57) explains this transcendental whistling as a direct representation of the ineffable Dao, \"his superhuman whistle, a primordial sound that does not describe the secrets of the universe, but incarnates it.\"\n\nSun Deng's biography (, Hermits and Recluses) does not mention \"xiao\" whistling, but this chapter uses \"xiao\" in the biography of Tao Qian 陶潛 [登東皋以舒嘯] and \"changxiao\" in that of Xia Tong 夏統 [集氣長嘯]. The \"Jin shu\" account of Sun Deng says,\nSun Teng, whose tzu was Kung-ho [公和], was a man of Kung in Chi commandery. He was homeless, but stayed in the mountains in the north of the commandery where he lived in a cavern in the earth that he had made for himself. In summer he wove grasses to wear as a shirt and in winter he let his hair down to cover himself. He liked to read the \"I ching\" and played a one-stringed zither [一絃琴]. All those who saw him felt friendly towards him and took pleasure in his company. There was not an ounce of hatred or anger in him. He was one thrown into the water to arouse his anger, but he just came out and broke into an enormous guffaw. From time to time he would wander among men and some of the householders he passed would set out food and clothing for him, now of which he would keep: when he had taken his leave he threw them all away. Once when he went to the mountains at I-yang [宜陽山] he was seen by some charcoal burners who knew he was not an ordinary man. But when they talked to him, he did not answer. Wen-ti [Ssu-ma Chao] heard about it and sent Juan Chi to investigate. (tr. Holzman 2009: 149-150) \nThe context goes on to say that after Sun Deng refused to talk with Ruan Ji, Xi Kang followed Sun Deng travelling for three years. Since Sima Zhao became generalissimo in 255, Holzman dates Ruan Ji's visit around 257, and Xi Kang's around 258 to 260. Based on the different mountain names, Chan (1996: 151, 158) says Ruan Ji visited Sun Deng twice, first around 226-230, and then around 255-263; and dates Xi Kang's travels at around 249-251.\n\nThe \"Jinshu\" biography of Liu Kun 劉琨, the Governor of Bingzhou 并州 (modern Shanxi), records that once when the capital Jinyang was under siege by an army of Xiongnu cavalry, Liu supposedly ended the siege by giving a \"qingxiao\" 清嘯 \"clear whistle\" and playing a \"hujia\" \"a Mongolian double-reed instrument\". \"Liu Kun ascended a tall building by moonlight and emitted a clear \"xiao\" [清嘯]. When the Xiongnu soldiers heard it, they sighed sadly. In the middle of the night he played the \"hujia\" [a kind of oboe originating on the steppes, perhaps the predecessor of the \"sona\"]; the Xiongnu became homesick on hearing it. He played again at dawn and he Xiongnu lifted the siege and left.\" (tr. Watt and Harper 2004: 8).\n\nThe anonymous (c. 8th century) \"Xiaozhi\" 嘯旨 \"Principles of Whistling\" is included in several collections of Tang dynasty literature, such as the \"Tangdai congshu\" 唐代叢書. According to the (c. 800) \"Fengshi wenjian ji\" 封氏聞見記, written by Feng Yan 封演, the \"Xiaozhi\" was written in 765 by a judge Sun Guang 孫廣, who is otherwise unknown. The titular word \"zhǐ\" 旨 means \"intention; aim; meaning\", and the translator E. D. Edwards (1957: 218) says the text is about \"How to Whistle\". Paul W. Kroll (1983: 250) translates \"Xiaozhi\" as \"Directives on Whistling\".\n\nThere are two theories regarding the origin of the \"Principles of Whistling\" (Edwards 1957: 217). The first is that during the Six Dynasties (220-589) period, some people opposed to Confucianism went into the mountains and did what they liked, including as, for example whistling, since Confucius looked down on those who whistled (e.g., \"Liji\"). The other is the Daoist theory, which is more probable since the \"Xiaozhi\" frequently mentions Dao. The Daoists believed that breathing the breath of Nature was one means of gaining immortality, and by whistling they were breathing in accord with Nature, and therefore they came nearer to Immortality.\n\nThe \"Xiaozhi\" Preface begins with a definition that semantically expands \"xiao\" from \"moan; call out\" and \"call back (a soul)\" to a new meaning of \"communicating (with the Daoist gods and spirits)\".\nAir forced outwards from the throat and \"low\" in key is termed speech; forced outwards from the tongue and \"high\" in key is termed \"hsiao\" (whistling). The low key of speech is sufficient for the conduct of human affairs, for the expression of our natural feelings; the high key of whistling can move supernatural beings and is everlasting. Indeed, though a good speaker can win response from a thousand \"li\", a good whistler commands the attention of the whole world of spirits. (tr. Edwards 1957: 218-219) \nDonald Holzman (2009: 152) translates this as \"a sound produced by breath striking against the tip of the tongue … a method of communicating with the spirits and achieving immortality\", and comments, \"Whatever whistling did signify, the important thing to note is that it was an unintellectual art, probably a fairly strange kind of sound divorced from speech and reason.\"\n\nThe Preface then outlines a Daoist mytho-history of \"xiao\" transmission. \nLaozi transmitted it to Queen Mother of the West, she to the Perfected Person of the South Polar Star 南極真人 [controller of human longevity], he to Guangchengzi, he to the wind god Feng Bo, and he to Xiaofu 嘯夫 Father of Whistling. Father of Whistling taught it to [7-inch-tall] Wu Guang 務光, he to Emperor Yao, and Yao to Emperor Shun, who invented the zither. Shun transmitted whistling to Yu the Great, after whom the art declined until it was revived by the Jin dynasty (265–420) Daoist transcendent Sun Gong 孫公 of Mt. Taihang who obtained the technique, achieved the Way, and disappeared without teaching it to anyone. Ruan Ji had a smattering knowledge of the art but after him it was lost and no longer heard (adapted from Edwards 1957: 219-220). \nThe \"Shanhaijing\" (tr. Birrell 2000:24) says, \"In appearance, Queen Mother of the West looks like a human, but she has a leopard's tail and the fangs of a tigress, and she is good at whistling. She wears a victory crown on her tangled hair.\" The \"Shanghaijing\" using \"xiao\" for the tiger-like Queen Mother's \"whistling\" parallels the \"Huainanzi\" using it for a tiger's \"howl\" (Su 2006: 19). The \"Liexian Zhuan\" lists the Father of Whistling, who could control fire, but does not mention whistling.\n\nThe \"Xiaozhi\" 嘯旨 has fifteen sections. Section 1 \"First Principles\" tells how to practice whistling, for instance, \"regulate the respiration, correct the relative positions of lips and teeth, compose the sides of the mouth, relax the tongue, practise in some retired spot.\" It also gives twelve specific whistling techniques, such as (tr. Edwards 1957: 220-221), \"Waiji\" 外激— \"Place the tongue in close contact with the inside of the upper teeth. Open wide both lips and force the breath outwards, letting the sound go out.\"; and \"Neiji\" 內激—\"Place the tongue as before; close both lips, compressing them to a point, like the opening of a stalk of wheat. Pass the breath through, making the sound go inwards.\"\n\nTitles of subsequent sections are either poetic descriptions of tunes, e.g., \"Tiger in a Deep Ravine\" (3), \"Night Demons in a Lonely Wood\" (5), and \"Snow Geese and Swans Alighting\" (7); or references to famous historical whistlers, e.g., \"Su Men [Mountains]\" (11) was transmitted by Sun Deng, and \"The Loose Rhymes of Ruan\" was composed by Ruan Ji (both mentioned above). The \"Xiaozhi\" explains and describes each whistling tune. Take, for example, \"Su Men\", which retells the story of Sun Deng and Ruan Ji (above), but with whistling instead of zither playing.\nThe 'Su Men' was composed by the Taoist Immortal Recluse, who lived in the Su Men Mountains (of Honan). The Holy One transmitted, he did not make it. The Immortal transmitted (the music of) Kuang Ch'eng and Wu Kuang 務光 in order to rejoice the spirit and expand the Tao. He did not regard music as the main task. In olden days there were those who roved in Su Men listening to the phoenix' songs. The notes were exquisitely clear, very different from the so-called pretended phoenix. The phoenix makes sounds but humans cannot hear them. How then can the Su Family know the sound of the phoenix? Hereafter, when seeking the sound, bring up the Immortal's whistle. The Immortal's whistle does not stop at fostering the Tao and gratifying the spirits; for indeed, in everyday affairs it brings harmony into the world, and peace in season. In oneself the Tao never dies, in objective matters it assists all that is sacred, and conducts the Five Influences. In the arcana of Nature order prevails. For success in obtaining response (to such efforts) nothing approaches music. The Immortal has evolved the one successful form. As to all wild things whistling is the one thing needful. Yuan Szu-tsung of Chin (Yuan Chi) was a fine whistler. Hearing that the Immortal thought himself his equal, he (Yuan) went to visit him. The Immortal remained seated with his hair in disorder. Yuan bowed repeatedly and inquired after his health. Thrice and again thrice he addressed his (uncivil) host. The Immortal maintained his attitude and made no response. Chi then whistled some score of notes and left. The Immortal, estimating that his guest had not gone far, began to whistle the Ch'ing Chueh [清角] to the extent of four or five movements. But Chi perceived that the mountains and all growing things took on a different sound. Presently came a fierce whirlwind with pelting rain, followed by phoenixes and peacocks in flocks; no one could count them. Chi was alarmed, but also pleased, and he returned home and wrote down the story. He obtained only two-tenths of it, and called it 'Su Men'. This is what they tell there. The motif of the song is lofty mountains and wide marshes, great heights and distances. (tr. Edwards 1957: 226) \n\nThe \"Xiaozhi\" explains the essence of \"xiao\" whistling in the \"Fleeting Cloud\" (section 6, tr. Edwards 1957: 222-223), \"The lute suits southern manners; the reed-organ suits the cry of the phoenix; the fife suits the dragon's drone. Every musical sound has its counterpart (in nature). So, the roar of the tiger and the drone of a dragon all have a proper sequence of notes.\" Transcendental whistling evokes the sounds of nature. Ronald Egan (1994: 248) describes \"changxiao\" as \"a well-known method, associated with Taoist practices, by which the devotee prepares his own mind for the experience of nature and, simultaneously, attempts to elicit a sympathetic reaction\" from nature.\n\n\"Standard Notes\" (14, tr. Edwards 1957: 227) mentions Daoist immortality, \"In comparatively modern days, Sun Kung [Sun Deng] was successful, but people did not listen. As to peaceful notes [平和], they stave off old age and do not allow one to die. These Standard notes are known about, but the notes themselves are lost.\" The last \"Conclusion\" section (15, tr. Edwards 1957: 228) says, \"The conclusion is at the extremities of the [pentatonic] scale, the end of the Great Tao. After the days of Yao and Shun there was some idea of these notes, but the actual notes were lost.\" The Conclusion includes a (1520) colophon written by Ming dynasty scholar Geng Chen, who describes the book as exceedingly rare, and probably written by someone during the Tang dynasty.\nThe preface says, \"the (Western) Queen Mother taught the Fairy of the South Polar Star; he passed it on to Kuang Ch'eng-tzu\". This is extravagant talk, and not usually accepted. But the twelve methods are found in Sun Teng and Yuan Chi [i.e., Ruan Ji], so that we can truly say we have the general purport of Whistling. The Preface also says that Sun Teng did not hand on (the gift) to anyone, and after Yuan Chi it disappeared and was no more heard. … Now the voice of man is the voice of the universe (nature). Man may be ancient or modern, but sound is eternal, never new or old. Now this book is going forth and who knows whether a Sun or Yuan may not appear in some mountains or woods and, that being so, who can say that there is an end to Whistling? (tr. Edwards 1957: 228) \n\nThe \"Xiaozhi houxu\" 肅旨後序 \"Postface to the Principles of Whistling\", written by the Ming dynasty scholar and artist Tang Yin (1470-1524), compares the non-verbal art of \"xiao\" whistling with a Daoist priest's secret incantation and a Buddhist monk's magical formula in Sanskrit (Su 2006: 43).\n\nTang poetry is renowned in history of Chinese literature. Kroll (1983: 250) says many medieval poems mention \"changxiao\" \"long whistling\", but translators generally convert it into a dull \"humming.\"\n\nIn the extensive \"Quan Tangshi\" collection of Tang poetry, \"xiao\" occurs in 385 poems, and \"changxiao\" in 89. For one example, the famous poet Li Bai (701-762) wrote six poems entitled \"Wandering on Mount Tai\", the first of which uses \"changxiao\".\nClimbing to the heights, I gaze afar at P'eng and Ying; The image imagined—the Terrace of Gold and Silver. At Heaven's Gate, one long whistle I give, And from a myriad \"li\" the clear wind comes. Jade maidens, four or five persons, Gliding and whirling descend from the Nine Peripheries. Suppressing smiles, they lead me forward by immaculate hands, And let fall to \"me\" a cup of fluid aurora! I bow my head down, salute them twice, Ashamed for myself not to be of a transcendent's caliber.—But broad-ranging enough now to make the cosmos dwindle, I'll leave this world behind, oh how far away! (tr. Kroll 1983: 249) \n\nThe preeminent Chinese avant-garde author Ge Fei wrote the (1995) \"Hūshào\" 忽哨 \"Whistling\" short story, using the modern \"whistle\" term with \"shào\" 哨 instead of \"xiào\" 嘯 in \"Xiaofu\", \"Xiaozhi\", etc. The two main characters are based on the historical figures Sun Deng and Ruan Ji who were proficient in transcendental whistling. Victor Mair, who translated \"Whistling\" into English, says\nAn old legend of the celebrated encounter between the two men has Ruan Ji visiting Sun Deng in his hermitage but not receiving any responses to his questions. Thereupon, he withdraws and, halfway up a distant mountain, lets out a loud, piercing whistle. This is followed by Sun Deng's magnificent whistled reply, which inspires Ruan Ji to write the \"Biography of Master Great Man,\" an encomium in praise of the Taoist \"true man\" that also satirizes the conventional Confucian \"gentleman\". (1998:43) \n\n\"Whistling\" tells how the famous poet Ruan Ji regularly came to visit the aged hermit Sun Deng on Su \nGate Mountain 蘇門山 in present-day Henan, and play games of \"weiqi\" go. During one go game, Sun was silently pondering how to move a piece, and Ruan surprised him. \"When the whistling sound suddenly arose, Sun Deng was totally unprepared for it. The strange, strident sound, mixed with the sounds of the billowing pines, reverberated through the valleys of Su Gate Mountain for a long while without expiring.\" (tr. Mair 1998:43).\n\nAfter a final game of go, Ruan took his leave from Sun owing to the \"prolonged and profound silence that made him feel bored.\" Sun watches Ruan's silhouette gradually dissolving into the dark green distance,\nWhen the sound of whistling rose beneath the sunny empyrean, Sun Deng shuddered as though it were a bolt out of the blue. Shielding his eyes from the strong light with one hand, he saw Ruan Ji standing on the peak of Su Gate Mountain beneath a solitary tree. Against a backdrop of white clouds like thick cotton fleece, he stood motionless, seeing to wait for Sun Deng's answer. Sun Deng looked all around him, then quietly inserted his thumb and forefinger in his mouth—the extreme frailness of his body and the looseness of his teeth caused him to be unable to produce any sound. The shrill, desolate, plaintive whistle, accompanied by the soughing of the billowing pines, reverberated for a long time in the mountain valleys. It was like the sad wail of the poet who died long ago, penetrating through the barriers of time, continuing up till today, and sinking into the easily awakened dreams of a living person. (tr. Mair 1998: 68) \n\n\n"}
{"id": "1820960", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1820960", "title": "Transpersonal", "text": "Transpersonal\n\nThe transpersonal is a term used by different schools of philosophy and psychology in order to describe experiences and worldviews that extend beyond the personal level of the psyche, and beyond mundane worldly events. \n\nThe transpersonal has been defined as experiences \"in which the sense of identity or self extends beyond (trans) the individual or personal to encompass wider aspects of humankind, life, psyche or cosmos\". The field of Transpersonal Psychiatry has defined the term as \"development beyond conventional, personal or individual levels.\" On the other hand; \"transpersonal practices are those structured activities that focus on inducing transpersonal experiences\".\n\nOne of the founders of the field of transpersonal psychology, Stanislav Grof, has defined transpersonal states of awareness as such: \"The common denominator of this otherwise rich and ramified group of phenomena is the feeling of the individual that his consciousness expanded beyond the usual ego boundaries and the limitations of time and space\". \n\nThe term is related to the terminology of peak experience, altered states of consciousness, and spiritual experiences. The term is also associated with psychedelic work, and psychotechnologies, that includes research with psychedelic plants and chemicals such as LSD, ibogaine, ketamine, peyote, ayahuasca and the vast variety of substances available to all human cultures throughout history.\n\nThe term has an early precedent in the writing of philosopher William James, who used the term \"Trans-personal\" in one of his lectures from 1905. However, this early terminology, introduced by James, had a different meaning than the current one and its context was philosophy, not psychology, which is where the term is mostly used these days.\n\nThere has also been some speculation of an early precedent of the term in the writings of Carl Jung, as a result of the work of Jung's translators. It regards the jungian term \"ueberpersonlich\", used by Jung in a paper from 1917, which in later english translations appeared as \"superpersonal\", and later, \"transpersonal\". In a later, revised, version of the \"Psychology of the Unconscious\" (1942) there was even a chapter heading called \"The Personal and the Collective (or Transpersonal) Unconscious\". \n\nHowever, the origin of the term transpersonal, as it is currently used in academic writing, is mostly associated with the human potential movement of the 1960s and the founders of the field of Transpersonal psychology; Anthony Sutich, Abraham Maslow and Stanislav Grof. According to Vich all three had used the term as early as 1967, in order to describe new ideas in the field of Psychology. In 1968 the term was selected by the founding editors of the Journal of Transpersonal Psychology, Abraham Maslow and Anthony Sutich, in order to represent a new area of psychological inquiry. According to Powers the term “transpersonal” starts to show up in academic journals from 1970 and onwards.\n\nThe collective of people and organizations with an interest in the \"transpersonal\" is called the \"transpersonal movement\". Walsh and Vaughan defines the transpersonal movement as \"the interdisciplinary movement that includes various individual transpersonal disciplines\". \n\nThe philosophy of William James, the school of Psychosynthesis (founded by Roberto Assagioli), and the Analytical school of Carl Jung are often considered to be forerunners to the establishment of transpersonal theory. However, the start of the movement is associated with the emergence and growth of the related field of Humanistic Psychology. Several of the academic profiles of the early transpersonal movement, such as Abraham Maslow and Anthony Sutich, had their background in Humanistic Psychology. \n\nThe formative years of the transpersonal movement can be characterized by the founding of a few key organizations and institutions, such as: the Institute of Noetic Sciences in 1973, \"The International Transpersonal Psychology Association\" in 1973, Naropa Institute in 1974, and the California Institute of Transpersonal Psychology in 1975. The \"California Institute of Transpersonal Psychology\" later emerged as the \"Institute of Transpersonal Psychology\" and is today known as Sofia University. \n\nContemporary transpersonal disciplines include Transpersonal psychology, Transpersonal anthropology, Transpersonal sociology and Transpersonal ecology. Other academic orientations, whose main focus lies elsewhere, but that are associated with a transpersonal perspective, include Humanistic psychology and Near-Death Studies. Contemporary institutions include: the Association for Transpersonal Psychology (ATP), the \"European Transpersonal Psychology Association\" (EPTA), the \"International Transpersonal Association\" (ITA), and the \"European Transpersonal Association\" (Eurotas). Leading publications within the movement include: the Journal of Transpersonal Psychology, the International Journal of Transpersonal Studies, and the \"Journal of Transpersonal Research\".\n\nSeveral commentators note how the transpersonal field, and its vision, moved beyond the perspective of psychology and into other transpersonal domains during the 1980's and 1990's. This expansion of the transpersonal concept resulted in an interdisciplinary situation, and a dialogue with such fields as social work, ecology, art, literature, acting, law, business, entrepreneurship, ecopsychology, feminism and education.\n\nIn this respect, commentators have suggested that there is a difference between the founding field of Transpersonal psychology and a broader field of Transpersonal inquiry, known as \"Transpersonal studies\". This differentiation of the Transpersonal field has to do with the scope of the subjects under study, and the interest of researchers and theorists. \n\nIn their review of transpersonal definitions, published in 1993, Walsh and Vaughan noted that \"Transpersonal studies\" had grown beyond the founding field of Transpersonal psychology. Commenting on the criticisms of Transpersonal psychology in the 1980's, Chinen noted how the criticism did not differentiate between Transpersonal psychology, on the one hand, and a broad range of popularized transpersonal orientations, on the other. The same line of reasoning was picked up by Friedman, who differentiated between a broad domain of inquiry known as Transpersonal studies, and a more narrow field of Transpersonal psychology. Both authors argued that the confounding of the two domains resulted in confusion. In a \"summary of contemporary viewpoints on Transpersonal psychology\" Jorge Ferrer placed Transpersonal psychology within the wider \"umbrella\" known as \"Transpersonal studies\".\n\nThe International Journal of Transpersonal Studies was established in 1981. It is sponsored by the California Institute of Integral Studies, and serves as the official publication of the International Transpersonal Association.\n\n"}

It is used not only as a jurisprudential term but also as a political one.\n\nIt is the opinion of Horst Sendler that an Unrechtsstaat is characterized by a lack of striving for rights and an overall failure to achieve them. At the same time, individual violations of law and constitution do not make a state an Unrechtsstaat, because such violations also occur in a Rechtsstaat. Also, a state should not necessarily be considered an \"Unrechtsstaat,\" even if it does not correspond with the model of a classical civil Rechtsstaat and in particular the German concept of a Rechtsstaat. On the other hand, the term \"Unrechtsstaat\" does not exclude the possibility of instances in which such a state has areas where qualities characteristic of a Rechtsstaat are dominant and where justices is realized in practice. In contrast to this notion of an Unrechtsstaat, Gerd Roellecke holds that the differentiating quality of an Unrechtsstaat is that it does not expect the equality of all people. In contrast with historical \"Nichtrechtstaaten\" (non-Rechstaaten), Unrechtstaaten have the capacity to be Rechstaaten after a period of historical development.\n"}

{"id": "144804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=144804", "title": "Yin and yang", "text": "Yin and yang\n\nIn Chinese philosophy, yin and yang ( and ; \"yīnyáng\", lit. \"dark-bright\", \"negative-positive\") describes how seemingly opposite or contrary forces may actually be complementary, interconnected, and interdependent in the natural world, and how they may give rise to each other as they interrelate to one another. In Chinese cosmology, the universe creates itself out of a primary chaos of material energy, organized into the cycles of Yin and Yang and formed into objects and lives. Yin is the receptive and Yang the active principle, seen in all forms of change and difference such as the annual cycle (winter and summer), the landscape (north-facing shade and south-facing brightness), sexual coupling (female and male), the formation of both men and women as characters, and sociopolitical history (disorder and order).There are various dynamics in Chinese cosmology. In the cosmology pertaining to Yin and Yang, the material energy, which this universe has created itself out of, is also referred to as qi. It is believed that the organization of qi in this cosmology of Yin and Yang has formed many things . Included among these forms are humans. Many tangible dualities (such as light and dark, fire and water, expanding and contracting) are thought of as physical manifestations of the duality symbolized by yin and yang. This duality lies at the origins of many branches of classical Chinese science and philosophy, as well as being a primary guideline of traditional Chinese medicine, and a central principle of different forms of Chinese martial arts and exercise, such as baguazhang, taijiquan (t'ai chi), and qigong (Chi Kung), as well as appearing in the pages of the \"I Ching\".\n\nThe notion of a duality can be found in many areas, such as Communities of Practice, but in this context yin and yang are better viewed as parts of an oneness that is expressed in the Tao. The term \"dualistic-monism\" or dialectical monism has been coined in an attempt to express this fruitful paradox of simultaneous unity and duality. Yin and yang can be thought of as complementary (rather than opposing) forces that interact to form a dynamic system in which the whole is greater than the assembled parts. According to this philosophy, everything has both yin and yang aspects (for instance, shadow cannot exist without light). Either of the two major aspects may manifest more strongly in a particular object, depending on the criterion of the observation. The yin yang (i.e. taijitu symbol) shows a balance between two opposites with a portion of the opposite element in each section.\n\nIn Taoist metaphysics, distinctions between good and bad, along with other dichotomous moral judgments, are perceptual, not real; so, the duality of yin and yang is an indivisible whole. In the ethics of Confucianism on the other hand, most notably in the philosophy of Dong Zhongshu ( 2nd century BC), a moral dimension is attached to the idea of yin and yang.\n\nThese Chinese terms \"yin\" 陰 or 阴 \"shady side\" and \"yang\" 陽 or 阳 \"sunny side\" are linguistically analyzable in terms of Chinese characters, pronunciations and etymology, meanings, topography, and loanwords.\n\nThe Traditional Chinese characters and for the words \"yīn\" and \"yáng\" are both classified as radical- esphonetic characters, combining the semantically significant \"mound; hill\" radical or with the phonetic indicators \"ying\" and \"yang\" . The first phonetic \"yīn\" \"cloudy\" ideographically combines \"jīn\" \"now; present\" and \"yún\" \"cloud\", denoting the \"今 presence of 云 clouds\". The second phonetic \"yáng\" \"bright\" originally pictured the \"sun\" with \"rays coming down\". This phonetic is expanded with the \"sun\" radical into \"yáng\" 暘 \"rising sun; sunshine\". The \"mound; hill\" radical 阝full forms semantically specify \"yīn\" 陰 \"shady/dark side of a hill\" and \"yáng\" 陽 \"sunny/light side of a hill\".\n\nThe Simplified Chinese characters and for \"yīn\" and \"yáng\" combine the same \"hill\" radical 阝 with the non-phonetic \"yuè\" \"moon\" and \"rì\" \"sun\", graphically denoting \"shady side of a hill\" and \"sunny side of a hill\". Compare the Classical Chinese names (which contain \"tài\" \"great\") for these two heavenly bodies: \"Tàiyīn\" \"moon\" and \"Tàiyáng\" \"sun\".\n\nThe Modern Standard Chinese pronunciation of 陰 or 阴 is usually level first tone \"yīn\" \"shady; cloudy\" or sometimes falling fourth tone \"yìn\" \"to shelter; shade\", and 陽 or 阳 \"sunny\" is always pronounced with rising second tone \"yáng\".\n\nSinologists and historical linguists have reconstructed Middle Chinese pronunciations from data in the (7th century CE) \"Qieyun\" rhyme dictionary and later rhyme tables, which was subsequently used to reconstruct Old Chinese phonology from rhymes in the (11th-7th centuries BCE) \"Shijing\" and phonological components of Chinese characters. Reconstructions of Old Chinese have illuminated the etymology of modern Chinese words.\n\nCompare these Middle Chinese and Old Chinese (with asterisk) reconstructions of \"yīn\" 陰 and \"yáng\" 陽:\n\nSchuessler gives probable Sino-Tibetan etymologies for both Chinese words.\n\n\"Yin\" < *\"ʔəm\" compares with Burmese \"ʔum\" \"overcast; cloudy\", Adi \"muk-jum\" \"shade\", and Lepcha \"so'yǔm\" \"shade\"; and is probably cognate with Chinese \"àn\" < *\"ʔə̂mʔ\" \"dim; gloomy\" and \"qīn\" < *\"khəm\" \"blanket\"\n\n\"Yang\" < *\"laŋ\" compares with Lepcha \"a-lóŋ\" \"reflecting light\", Burmese \"laŋ\" \"be bright\" and \"ə-laŋ\" \"light\"; and is perhaps cognate with Chinese \"chāng\" < *\"k-hlaŋ\" \"prosperous; bright\"; \"bǐng\" < *\"braŋʔ\" \"bright\"; \"liàng\" < \"*raŋh\" \"(pale) light\"; \"lǎng\" < \"raŋʔ\" \"brilliant light\"; \"míng\" < \"mraŋ\" \"bright, become light, enlighten\". Schuessler surmises that those items either are areal words (cf. Tai \"plaŋ\" \"bright\") or belong to an Austroasiatic word family (cf. Proto-Viet-Muong \"hlaŋ\"); owing to \"the different OC initial consonant which seems to have no recognizable OC morphological function\".\n\n\"Yin\" and \"yang\" are semantically complex words. \n\nA reliable Chinese-English dictionary gives the following translation equivalents.\nYin 陰 or 阴 Noun ① [philosophy] negative/passive/female principle in nature ② Surname Bound morpheme ① the moon ② shaded orientation ③ covert; concealed; hidden ④ ⑦ negative ⑧ north side of a hill ⑨ south bank of a river ⑩ reverse side of a stele ⑪in intaglio Stative verb ① overcast \nYang 陽 or 阳 Bound morpheme ① [Chinese philosophy] positive/active/male principle in nature ②the sun ④ in relief ⑤ open; overt ⑥ belonging to this world ⑦ [linguistics] masculine ⑧ south side of a hill ⑨ north bank of a river \n\nThe compound \"yin-yang\" 陰陽 or 阴阳 means \"yin and yang; opposites; ancient Chinese astronomy; occult arts; astrologer; geomancer; etc.\".\n\nThe sinologist Rolf Stein etymologically translates Chinese \"yin\" 陰 \"shady side (of a mountain)\" and \"yang\" 陽 \"sunny side (of a mountain)\" with the uncommon English geographic terms \"ubac\" \"shady side of a mountain\" and \"adret\" \"sunny side of a mountain\" (which are of French origin)...\n\nMany Chinese place names or toponyms contain the word \"yang\" \"sunny side\" and a few contain \"yin\" \"shady side\". In China, as elsewhere in the Northern Hemisphere, sunlight comes predominantly from the south, and thus the south face of a mountain or the north bank of a river will receive more direct sunlight than the opposite side.\n\n\"Yang\" refers to the \"south side of a hill\" in Hengyang 衡陽, which is south of Mount Heng 衡山 in Hunan province, and to the \"north bank of a river\" in Luoyang 洛陽, which is located north of the Luo River 洛河 in Henan.\nSimilarly, \"yin\" refers to \"north side of a hill\" in Huayin 華陰, which is north of Mount Hua 華山 in Shaanxi province.\n\nIn Japan, the characters are used in western Honshu to delineate the north-side San'in region 山陰 from the south-side San'yō region 山陽, separated by the Chugoku mountain range 中国山地.\n\nEnglish \"yin\", \"yang\", and \"yin-yang\" are familiar loanwords of Chinese origin.\n\nThe \"Oxford English Dictionary\" defines:\nyin (jɪn) Also Yin, Yn. [Chinese \"yīn\" shade, feminine; the moon.] \na. In Chinese philosophy, the feminine or negative principle (characterized by dark, wetness, cold, passivity, disintegration, etc.) of the two opposing cosmic forces into which creative energy divides and whose fusion in physical matter brings the phenomenal world into being. Also \"attrib\". or as \"adj\"., and \"transf\". Cf. yang. \nb. \"Comb\"., as yin-yang, the combination or fusion of the two cosmic forces; freq. attrib., esp. as yin-yang symbol, a circle divided by an S-shaped line into a dark and a light segment, representing respectively \"yin\" and \"yang\", each containing a 'seed' of the other. \nyang (jæŋ) Also Yang. [Chinese \"yáng\" yang, sun, positive, male genitals.] \na. In Chinese philosophy, the masculine or positive principle (characterized by light, warmth, dryness, activity, etc.) of the two opposing cosmic forces into which creative energy divides and whose fusion in physical matter brings the phenomenal world into being. Also \"attrib.\" or as \"adj.\" Cf. yin.\nb. \"Comb.\": yang-yin = \"yin-yang\" s.v. yin b.\n\nFor the earliest recorded \"yin and yang\" usages, the \"OED\" cites 1671 for \"yin\" and \"yang\", 1850 for \"yin-yang\", and 1959 for \"yang-yin\".\n\nIn English, \"yang-yin\" (like \"ying-yang\") occasionally occurs as a mistake or typographical error for the Chinese loanword \"yin-yang\"— yet they are not equivalents. Chinese does have some \"yangyin\" collocations, such as 洋銀 (lit. \"foreign silver\") \"silver coin/dollar\", but not even the most comprehensive dictionaries (e.g., the \"Hanyu Da Cidian\") enter \"yangyin\" *陽陰. While \"yang\" and \"yin\" can occur together in context, \"yangyin\" is not synonymous with \"yinyang\". The linguistic term \"irreversible binomial\" refers to a collocation of two words A-B that cannot be idiomatically reversed as B-A, for example, English \"cat and mouse\" (not *\"mouse and cat\") and \"friend or foe\" (not *\"foe or friend\"). Similarly, the usual pattern among Chinese binomial compounds is for positive A and negative B, where the A word is dominant or privileged over B, for example, \"tiandi\" 天地 \"heaven and earth\" and \"nannü\" 男女 \"men and women\". \"Yinyang\" meaning \"dark and light; female and male; moon and sun\", however, is an exception. Scholars have proposed various explanations for why \"yinyang\" violates this pattern, including \"linguistic convenience\" (it is easier to say \"yinyang\" than \"yangyin\"), the idea that \"proto-Chinese society was matriarchal\", or perhaps, since \"yinyang\" first became prominent during the late Warring States period, this term was \"purposely directed at challenging persistent cultural assumptions\".\n\nNeedham discusses Yin and Yang together with Five Elements as part of the School of Naturalists. He says that it would be proper to begin with Yin and Yang before Five Elements because the former: \"lay, as it were, at a deeper level in Nature, and were the most ultimate principles of which the ancient Chinese could conceive. But it so happens that we know a good deal more about the historical origin of the Five-Element theory than about that of the Yin and the Yang, and it will therefore be more convenient to deal with it first.\" He then discusses Zou Yan (鄒衍; 305 – 240 BC) who is most associated with these theories. Although Yin and Yang are not mentioned in any of the surviving documents of Zou Yan, his school was known as the Yin Yang Jia (Yin and Yang School) Needham concludes \"There can be very little doubt that the philosophical use of the terms began about the beginning of the -4th century, and that the passages in older texts which mention this use are interpolations made later than that time.\"\n\nIn spite of being used in a modern context to justify egalitarianism under the notion of both yin and yang being \"necessary\", in practise the concept of yin and yang has led to justification for China's patriarchal history. Particularly under Confucianism, yang (as the sun principle) is considered superior to \"yin\" (the dark principle), hence men are afforded rulership positions whereas women are not unless, under some remarkable circumstances, they possess sufficient yang.\n\nThe notion of yin and yang has led to the persecution and extinction of Asian sun goddess cults outside of Korea and Japan.\n\nIn Daoist philosophy, dark and light, yin and yang, arrive in the Tao Te Ching at chapter 42.  It becomes sensible from an initial quiescence or emptiness (wuji, sometimes symbolized by an empty circle), and continues moving until is reached again. For instance, dropping a stone in a calm pool of water will simultaneously raise waves and lower troughs between them, and this alternation of high and low points in the water will radiate outward until the movement dissipates and the pool is calm once more. Yin and yang thus are always opposite and equal qualities. Further, whenever one quality reaches its peak, it will naturally begin to transform into the opposite quality: for example, grain that reaches its full height in summer (fully yang) will produce seeds and die back in winter (fully yin) in an endless cycle.\n\nIt is impossible to talk about yin or yang without some reference to the opposite, since yin and yang are bound together as parts of a mutual whole (for example, there cannot be the bottom of the foot without the top). A way to illustrate this idea is to postulate the notion of a race with only men or only women; this race would disappear in a single generation. Yet, men and women together create new generations that allow the race they mutually create (and mutually come from) to survive. The interaction of the two gives birth to things, like manhood. Yin and yang transform each other: like an undertow in the ocean, every advance is complemented by a retreat, and every rise transforms into a fall. Thus, a seed will sprout from the earth and grow upwards towards the skyan intrinsically yang movement. Then, when it reaches its full potential height, it will fall. Also, the growth of the top seeks light, while roots grow in darkness.\n\nCertain catchphrases have been used to express yin and yang complementarity:\n\nYin is the black side with the white dot in it, and yang is the white side with the black dot in it. The relationship between yin and yang is often described in terms of sunlight playing over a mountain and a valley. Yin (literally the 'shady place' or 'north slope') is the dark area occluded by the mountain's bulk, while yang (literally the \"sunny place' or \"south slope\") is the brightly lit portion. As the sun moves across the sky, yin and yang gradually trade places with each other, revealing what was obscured and obscuring what was revealed.\n\nYin is characterized as slow, soft, yielding, diffuse, cold, wet, and passive; and is associated with water, earth, the moon, femininity, and night time.\n\nYang, by contrast, is fast, hard, solid, focused, hot, dry, and active; and is associated with fire, sky, the sun, masculinity and daytime.\n\nThe yin-yang symbol, having no \"officially standardized\" rendition, has been the basis of much artistic variation, most of it \"frivolous\" (that is, \"merely\" artistic, with no philosophical/mystical meaning, e.g., tattoos). \n\nYin and yang also applies to the human body. In traditional Chinese medicine good health is directly related to the balance between yin and yang qualities within oneself. If yin and yang become unbalanced, one of the qualities is considered deficient or has vacuity.\n\nIn the \"I Ching\", originally a divination manual of the Western Zhou period (c. 1000–750 BC), yin and yang are represented by broken and solid lines: yin is broken (⚋) and yang is solid (⚊). These are then combined into trigrams, which are more yang (\"e.g.\" ☱) or more yin (\"e.g.\" ☵) depending on the number of broken and solid lines (\"e.g.\", ☰ is heavily yang, while ☷ is heavily yin), and trigrams are combined into hexagrams (\"e.g.\" ䷕ and ䷟). The relative positions and numbers of yin and yang lines within the trigrams determines the meaning of a trigram, and in hexagrams the upper trigram is considered yang with respect to the lower trigram, yin, which allows for complex depictions of interrelations.\n\nThe principle of yin and yang is represented in Taoism by the Taijitu (literally \"Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate\"). The term is commonly used to mean the simple \"divided circle\" form, but may refer to any of several schematic diagrams representing these principles, such as the swastika, common to Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. Similar symbols have also appeared in other cultures, such as in Celtic art and Roman shield markings.\n\nTaijiquan (Chinese: 太极拳), a form of martial art, is often described as the principles of yin and yang applied to the human body and an animal body. Wu Jianquan, a famous Chinese martial arts teacher, described Taijiquan as follows:\n\n\nFootnotes\nWorks cited\n\n"}
