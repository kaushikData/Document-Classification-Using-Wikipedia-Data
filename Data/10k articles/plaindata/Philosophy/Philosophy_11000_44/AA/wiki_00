{"id": "40280137", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40280137", "title": "Buddhism and Western philosophy", "text": "Buddhism and Western philosophy\n\nBuddhist thought and Western philosophy include several interesting parallels. Before the 20th century, a few European thinkers such as Arthur Schopenhauer and Friedrich Nietzsche had engaged with Buddhist thought. Likewise, in Asian nations with Buddhist populations, there were also attempts to bring the insights of Western thought to Buddhist philosophy, as can be seen in the rise of Buddhist modernism.\n\nAfter the post-war spread of Buddhism to the West there has been considerable interest by some scholars in a comparative, cross-cultural approach between Eastern and Western philosophy. Much of this work is now published in academic journals such as \"Philosophy East and West\".\n\nAccording to Edward Conze, Greek Skepticism (particularly that of Pyrrho) can be compared to Buddhist philosophy, especially the Indian Madhyamika school. The Pyrrhonian Skeptics' goal of ataraxia (the state of being untroubled) is a soteriological goal. The core teaching of Pyrrho was that things are adiaphora (undifferentiated by a logical differentia), astathmēta (unstable, unbalanced, not measurable), and anepikrita (unjudged, unfixed, undecidable). This is strikingly similar to the Buddhist Three marks of existence.\n\nThey promoted withholding judgment (Epoché) about facts of the world as a way to reach that goal. This is similar to the Buddha's refusal to answer certain metaphysical questions which he saw as non-conductive to the path of Buddhist practice and Nagarjuna's \"relinquishing of all views (drsti)\". Adrian Kuzminski argues for direct influence between these two systems of thought. In \"Pyrrhonism: How the Ancient Greeks Reinvented Buddhism\", Kuzminski writes: \"its origin can plausibly be traced to the contacts between Pyrrho and the sages he encountered in India, where he traveled with Alexander the Great.\" According to Kuzminski, both philosophies argue against assenting to any dogmatic assertions about an ultimate metaphysical reality behind our sense impressions as a tactic to reach tranquility and both also make use of logical arguments against other philosophies in order to expose their contradictions.\nBuddhist thought can also be compared to Classical Cynicism and Stoicism, in that all of these world views sought to develop a set of practices to reach a state of equanimity by the removal of desires and passions.\n\nThe Scottish philosopher David Hume wrote: \"When I enter most intimately into what I call myself, I always stumble on some particular perception or other, of heat or cold, light or shade, love or hatred, pain or pleasure. I never catch myself at any time without a perception, and never can observe any thing but the perception\"\nAccording to Hume then there is nothing that is constantly stable which we could identify as the self, only a flow of differing experiences. Our view that there is something substantive which binds all of these experiences together is for Hume merely imaginary. The self is a fiction that is attributed to the entire flow of experiences. \nPain and pleasure, grief and joy, passions and sensations succeed each other, and never all exist at the same time. It cannot, therefore, be from any of these impressions, or from any other, that the idea of self is deriv'd; and consequently there is no such idea...I may venture to affirm of the rest of mankind, that they are nothing but a bundle or collection of different perceptions, which succeed each other with an inconceivable rapidity, and are in a perpetual flux and movement.\nThis 'Bundle theory' of personal identity is very similar to the Buddhist notion of not-self, which holds that the unitary self is a fiction and that nothing exists but a collection of five aggregates. Similarly, both Hume and Buddhist philosophy hold that it is perfectly acceptable to speak of personal identity in a mundane and conventional way, while believing that there are ultimately no such things. Hume scholar Alison Gopnik has even argued that Hume could have had contact with Buddhist philosophy during his stay in France (which coincided with his writing of the \"Treatise of Human Nature\") through the well traveled Jesuit missionaries of the Royal College of La Flèche.\n\nBritish philosopher Derek Parfit has argued for a reductionist and deflationary theory of personal identity in his book \"Reasons and Persons\". According to Parfit, apart from a causally connected stream of mental and physical events, there are no “separately existing entities, distinct from our brains and bodies”. Parfit concludes that \"Buddha would have agreed.\" Parfit also argues that this view is liberating and leads to increased empathy.\n\nIs the truth depressing? Some may find it so. But I find it liberating, and consoling. When I believed that my existence was such a further fact, I seemed imprisoned in myself. My life seemed like a glass tunnel, through which I was moving faster every year, and at the end of which there was darkness. When I changed my view, the walls of my glass tunnel disappeared. I now live in the open air. There is still a difference between my lives and the lives of other people. But the difference is less. Other people are closer. I am less concerned about the rest of my own life, and more concerned about the lives of others.\n\nAccording to \"The New Yorker\"'s Larissa MacFarquhar, passages of \"Reasons and Persons\" have been studied and chanted at a Tibetan Buddhist monastery.\n\nOther Western philosophers that have attacked the view of a fixed self include Daniel Dennett (in his paper 'The Self as a Center of Narrative Gravity') and Thomas Metzinger ('The Ego Tunnel').\n\nIdealism is the group of philosophies which assert that reality, or reality as we can know it, is fundamentally mental, mentally constructed, or otherwise immaterial. Some Buddhist philosophical views have been interpreted as having Idealistic tendencies, mainly the cittamatra (mind-only) philosophy of Yogacara Buddhism as outlined in the works of Vasubandhu and Xuanzang. Metaphysical Idealism has been the orthodox position of the Chinese Yogacara school or Fǎxiàng-zōng. According to Buddhist philosopher Vasubhandu \"The transformation of consciousness is imagination. What is imagined by it does not exist. Therefore everything is representation-only.\" This has been compared to the Idealist philosophies of Bishop Berkeley and Immanuel Kant. Kant's categories have also been compared to the Yogacara concept of karmic \"vasanas\" (perfumings) which condition our mental reality.\n\nImmanuel Kant's Transcendental Idealism has also been compared with the Indian philosophical approach of the Madhyamaka school by scholars such as T. R. V. Murti. Both posit that the world of experience is in one sense a mere fabrication of our senses and mental faculties. For Kant and the Madhyamikas, we do not have access to 'things in themselves' because they are always filtered by our mind's 'interpretative framework'. Thus both worldviews posit that there is an ultimate reality and that Reason is unable to reach it. Buddhologists like Edward Conze have also seen similarities between Kant's antinomies and the unanswerable questions of the Buddha in that \"they are both concerned with whether the world is finite or infinite, etc., and in that they are both left undecided.\"\n\nArthur Schopenhauer was influenced by Indian religious texts and later claimed that Buddhism was the \"best of all possible religions.\" Schopenhauer's view that \"suffering is the direct and immediate object of life\" and that this is driven by an \"restless willing and striving\" are similar to the four noble truths of the Buddha. Schopenhauer promoted the saintly ascetic life of the Indian sramanas as a way to renounce the Will. His view that a single world-essence (The Will) comes to manifest itself as a multiplicity of individual things (\"principium individuationis\") has been compared to the Buddhist trikaya doctrine as developed in Yogacara Buddhism. Finally, Schopenhauer's ethics which are based on universal compassion for the suffering of others can be compared to the Buddhist ethics of Karuṇā.\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche admired Buddhism, writing that it \"Buddhism already has -- and this distinguishes it profoundly from Christianity -- the self-deception of moral concepts behind it -- it stands, in my language, Beyond Good and Evil.\" Nietzsche saw himself as undertaking a similar project to the Buddha, “I could become the Buddha of Europe,” he wrote in 1883, “though frankly I would be the antipode of the Indian Buddha.” Nietzsche (as well as Buddha) accepted that all is change and becoming, and both sought to create an ethics which was not based on a God or an Absolutist Being. Nietzsche believed that Buddhism's goal of Nirvana was a form of life denying nihilism and promoted what he saw as its inversion, life affirmation and \"amor fati\". According to Benjamin A. Elman, Nietzsche's interpretation of Buddhism as pessimistic and life-denying was probably influenced by his understanding of Schopenhauer's views of eastern philosophy and therefore \"he was predisposed to react to Buddhism in terms of his close reading of Schopenhauer.\" Because of this writes Elman, Nietzsche misinterprets Buddhism as promoting \"nothingness\" and nihilism, all of which the Buddha and other Buddhist philosophers such as Nagarjuna repudiated, in favor of a subtler understanding of Shunyata.\n\nAntoine Panaïoti argues in \"Nietzsche and Buddhist philosophy\" that both of these systems of thought begin by wrestling with the problem of nihilism and that they both develop a therapeutic outlook for dealing with the suffering and anxiety brought about by the crisis of nihilism. While Nietzsche and Buddhism do diverge in some ways, which is why Nietzsche saw himself as an 'Anti-Buddha\", Panaïoti stresses the similarity of both systems as paths towards a “vision of great health” that allows one to deal with the impermanent world of becoming by accepting it as it truly is. Ultimately both world views have as their ideal what Panaïoti calls \"great health perfectionism\" which seeks to remove unhealthy tendencies from human beings and reach an exceptional state of self-development.\n\nRobert G. Morrison has also written on the \"ironic affinities\" between Nietzsche and Pali Buddhism through close textual comparison, such as that between Nietzsche's 'self-overcoming' (\"Selbstüberwindung\") and the Buddhist concept of mental development (\"citta-bhavana\"). Morrison also sees an affinity between the Buddhist concept of tanha, or craving and Nietzsche's view of the Will to Power as well as in their understandings of personality as a flux of different psycho-physical forces. The similarity between Nietzsche's view of the Ego as flux and the Buddhist concept of anatta is also noted by Benjamin Elman.\n\nDavid Loy also quotes Nietzsche's views on the subject as \"something added and invented and projected behind what there is\" (Will to Power 481) and on substance (\"The properties of a thing are effects on other 'things' ... there is no 'thing-in-itself.'\" WP 557), which are similar to Buddhist nominalist views. Loy however sees Nietzsche as failing to understand that his promotion of heroic aristocratic values and affirmation of will to power is just as much of a reaction to the 'sense of lack' which arises from the impermanence of the subject as what he calls slave morality.\n\nComparative work has also been done by Japanese interpreters of Nietzsche and Buddhism, such as Nishitani Keiji, in his \"The Self Overcoming Nihilism\" (Albany, N.Y., 1990), and Abe Masao in his essays on Nietzsche. In his \"A History of Western Philosophy\", Bertrand Russell pitted Nietzsche against the Buddha, ultimately criticizing Nietzsche for his promotion of violence, elitism and hatred of compassionate love.\n\nThe German Buddhist monk Nyanaponika Thera wrote that the Buddhist Abhidhamma philosophy \"doubtlessly belongs\" to Phenomenology and that the Buddhist term dhamma could be rendered as \"phenomena\". Likewise, Alexander Piatigorsky sees early Buddhist Abhidhamma philosophy as being a \"phenomenological approach\".\n\nAccording to Dan Lusthaus, Buddhism \"is a type of phenomenology; Yogacara even moreso.\" Some scholars reject the idealist interpretation of Yogacara Buddhist philosophy and instead interpret it through the lens of Western Phenomenology which is the study of conscious processes from the subjective point of view.\n\nChristian Coseru argues in his monograph \"Perceiving reality\" that Buddhist philosophers such as Dharmakirti, Śāntarakṣita and Kamalaśīla \"share a common ground with phenomenologists in the tradition of Edmund Husserl and Maurice Merleau-Ponty.\" That common ground is the notion of the intentionality of consciousness. Coseru compares the concepts of the object aspect (grāhyākāra) and the subject aspect (grāhakākāra) of consciousness to the Husserlian concepts of Noesis and Noema.\n\nModern Buddhist thinkers who have been influenced by Western Phenomenology and Existentialism include Ñāṇavīra Thera, Nanamoli Bhikkhu, R. G. de S. Wettimuny, Samanera Bodhesako and Ninoslav Ñāṇamoli.\n\nEdmund Husserl, the founder of Phenomenology, wrote that \"I could not tear myself away\" while reading the Buddhist Sutta Pitaka in the German translation of Karl Eugen Neumann. Husserl held that the Buddha's method as he understood it was very similar to his own. Eugen Fink, who was Husserl's chief assistant and whom Husserl considered to be his most trusted interpreter said that: \"the various phases of Buddhistic self-discipline were essentially phases of phenomenological reduction.\" After reading the Buddhist texts, Husserl wrote a short essay entitled 'On the discourses of Gautama Buddha' (\"Über die Reden Gotomo Buddhos\") which states:\n\nComplete linguistic analysis of the Buddhist canonical writings provides us with a perfect opportunity of becoming acquainted with this means of seeing the world which is completely opposite of our European manner of observation, of setting ourselves in its perspective, and of making its dynamic results truly comprehensive through experience and understanding. For us, for anyone, who lives in this time of the collapse of our own exploited, decadent culture and has had a look around to see where spiritual purity and truth, where joyous mastery of the world manifests itself, this manner of seeing means a great adventure.\n\nThat Buddhism - insofar as it speaks to us from pure original sources - is a religio-ethical discipline for spiritual purification and fulfillment of the highest stature - conceived of and dedicated to an inner result of a vigorous and unparalleled, elevated frame of mind, will soon become clear to every reader who devotes themselves to the work. Buddhism is comparable only with the highest form of the philosophy and religious spirit of our European culture. It is now our task to utilize this (to us) completely new Indian spiritual discipline which has been revitalized and strengthened by the contrast.\n\nFred J Hanna and Lau Kwok Ying both note that when Husserl calls Buddhism \"transcendental\" he is placing it on the same level as his own transcendental phenomenology. Also, that Husserl called Buddhism a \"great adventure\" is significant, since he referred to his own philosophy in that way as well - as a methodology which changes the way one views reality which also brings about personal transformation. Husserl also wrote about Buddhist philosophy in an unpublished manuscript \"Sokrates - Buddha\" in which he compared the Buddhist philosophical attitude with the Western tradition. Husserl saw a similarity between the Socratic good life lived under the maxim \"Know yourself\" and the Buddhist philosophy, he argues that they both have the same attitude, which is a combination of the pure theoretical attitude of the sciences and the pragmatic attitudes of everyday life. This third attitude is based on \"a praxis whose aim is to elevate humankind through universal scientific reason.\"\n\nHusserl also saw a similarity between Buddhist analysis of experience and his own method of epoche which is a suspension of judgment about metaphysical assumptions and presuppositions about the 'external' world (assumptions he termed 'the naturalistic attitude). However Husserl also thought that Buddhism has not developed into a unifying science which can unite all knowledge since it remains a religious-ethical system and hence it is not able to qualify as a full transcendental phenomenology.\n\nAccording to Aaron Prosser, \"The phenomenological investigations of Siddhartha Gautama and Edmund Husserl arrive at the exact same conclusion concerning a fundamental and invariant structure of consciousness. Namely, that object-directed consciousness has a transcendental correlational intentional structure, and that this is fundamental -- in the sense of basic and necessary--to all object-directed experiences.\"\n\nAccording to Reinhard May and Graham Parkes, Heidegger may have been influenced by Zen and Daoist texts. Some of Martin Heidegger's philosophical terms, such as Ab-grund (void), Das Nichts (the Nothing) and Dasein have been considered in light of Buddhist terms which express similar ideas such as Emptiness. Heidegger wrote that: “As void [Ab-grund], Being ‘is’ at once the nothing [das Nichts] as well as the ground.” Heidegger's \"Dialogue on Language\", has a Japanese friend (Tezuka Tomio) state that \"to us [Japanese] emptiness is the loftiest name for what you mean to say with the word ‘Being’” Heidegger's critique of metaphysics has also been compared to Zen's radical anti-metaphysical attitude. William Barrett held that Heidegger's philosophy was similar to Zen Buddhism and that Heidegger himself had confirmed this after reading the works of DT Suzuki.\n\nJean-Paul Sartre believed that consciousness lacks an essence or any fixed characteristics and that insight into this caused a strong sense of Existential angst or Nausea. Sartre saw consciousness as defined by its ability of negation, this happens because whenever consciousness becomes conscious of something it is aware of itself not being that intentional object. Consciousness is nothingness because all being-in-itself - the entire world of objects - is outside of it. Furthermore, for Sartre, being-in-itself is also nothing more than appearance, it has no essence. This conception of the self as nothingness and of reality as lacking any inherent essence has been compared to the Buddhist concept of Emptiness and Not-self. Just like the Buddhists rejected the Hindu concept of Atman, Sartre rejected Husserl's concept of the transcendental ego.\n\nMerleau-Ponty's phenomenology has been said to be similar to Zen Buddhism and Madhyamaka in that they all hold to the interconnection of the self, body and the world (the \"lifeworld\"). The unity of body and mind (\"shēnxīn\", 身心) expressed by the Buddhism of Dogen and Zhanran and Merleau-Ponty's view of the corporeity of consciousness seem to be in agreement. They both hold that the conscious mind is inherently connected to the body and the external world and that the lifeworld is experienced dynamically through the body, denying any independent Cartesian Cogito.\n\nThe German existentialist Karl Jaspers also wrote on the philosophy of the Buddha in his \"The Great Philosophers\" (1975). He recommended that Western Christians could learn from the Buddha, praised his cosmopolitanism and the flexibility and relatively non-dogmatic worldview of Buddhism.\n\nThe Kyoto School was a Japanese philosophical movement centered around Kyoto University that assimilated western philosophical influences (such as Kant and Heidegger) and Mahayana Buddhist ideas to create a new original philosophical synthesis. Its founder, Nishida Kitaro (1870–1945) developed the central concept associated with the Kyoto school, that is the concept of “Absolute Nothingness” (zettai-mu) which is related to the Zen Buddhist term Mu (無) as well as Shunyata. Nishida saw the Absolute nature of reality as Nothingness, a \"formless\", \"groundless ground\" which envelops all beings and allows them to undergo change and pass away.\n\nThe process philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead has several convergent points with Buddhist philosophy. Whitehead saw reality as an impermanent constant process of flux and denied that objects had any real substance within them, but rather were ever changing occasions. This is similar to the Buddhist concepts of the impermanence and emptiness. Whitehead also held that each one of these processes was never independent, but was interrelated and dependent all prior occasions, and this feature of reality which he called 'creativity' has been compared to dependent origination which holds that all events are conditioned by multiple past causes. Like Buddhism, Whitehead also held that our understanding of the world is usually mistaken because we hold to the ‘fallacy of misplaced concreteness’ in seeing constantly changing processes as having fixed substances. Buddhism teaches that suffering and stress arises from our ignorance to the true nature of the world. Likewise, Whitehead held that the world is \"haunted by terror\" at this process of change. \"The ultimate evil in the temporal world...lies in the fact that the past fades, that time is a ‘perpetual perishing’\" (PR, p. 340). In this sense, Whitehead's concept of \"evil\" is similar to the Buddhist viparinama-dukkha, suffering caused by change. Whitehead also had a view of God which has been likened to the Mahayana theory of the Trikaya as well as the Bodhisattva ideal.\n\nPanpsychism is the view that mind or soul is a universal feature of all things, this has been a common view in western philosophy going back to the Presocratics and Plato. According to D. S. Clarke, panpsychist and panexperientialist aspects can be found in the Huayan and Tiantai (Jpn. Tendai) Buddhist doctrines of Buddha nature, which was often attributed to inanimate objects such as lotus flowers and mountains.\n\nLudwig Wittgenstein held a therapeutic view of philosophy which according to K.T. Fann has \"striking resemblances\" to the Zen Buddhist conception of the dharma as a medicine for abstract linguistic and philosophical confusion. C. Gudmunsen in his \"Wittgenstein and Buddhism\" argues that \"much of what the later Wittgenstein had to say was anticipated about 1,800 years ago in India.\" In his book, Gudmunsen mainly compares Wittgenstein's later philosophy with Madhyamaka views on the emptiness of thought and words. One of Wittgenstein's students, the Sri Lankan philosopher KN Jayatilleke, wrote \"Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge\" which interpreted the epistemology of the early Buddhist texts analytically.\n\nMany modern interpreters of Nagarjuna (Jay Garfield, CW Huntington) take a Wittgensteinian or Post-Wittgensteinian critical model in their work on Madhyamaka Buddhist philosophy. Ives Waldo writes that Nagarjuna's criticism of the idea of svabhava (own-being) \"directly parallels Wittgenstein's argument that a private language (an empiricist language) is impossible. Having no logical links (criteria) to anything outside their defining situation, its words must be empty of significance or use.\"\n\n- Buddhism and Whitehed\n"}

In addition to international speakers, many Taiwanese local Open Source contributors often give their talks here. The chief organizer, other staffs, and speakers are all volunteers.\n\nCOSCUP's aim is to provide a platform to connect Open Source coders, users, and promoters, and promote FLOSS with the annual conference. The conference is free to attend because of the enthusiastic sponsors and donators. Since the conference venue is limited, tickets are often sold out immediately after the online registration starts.\n\nThe lightweight Desktop Environment LXDE was announced at COSCUP 2006.\n\nCOSCUP's predecessor was the community talks in International Conference on Open Source (Chinese: , ICOS). In 2006, ICOS's topics no longer fit some attendees' demand; Taiwanese Open source community participators initiated COSCUP, as a \"festival\" for Taiwanese open source communities. The first event, COSCUP 2006, was held at National Taiwan University Sports Center, and was a great success with almost 200 attendees. The number of attendees grew to almost 2000 by COSCUP 2014.\n\nIn 2014，COSCUP moved to Taipei International Convention Center, with 1,500 attendees, and 110 talks. Later in 2014, COSCUP was back to Academia Sinica Humanities and Social Sciences Building, but the conference also extends to the neighboring Academia Sinica Academic Activities Center.

He became disciple of the abbot Ban Tetsugyu Soin Roshi (伴鐵牛, 1910–1996).\n\nDuring his training of monk, he attended the Institute of eastern medicine founded by Shizuto Masunaga (増永静人 1925–1981), from which, in 1988, he got a certificate of teacher of eastern medicine and Zen Shiatsu. The composite background of zen monk and shiatsu teacher opened to Tetsugen his intention to use the shiatsu discipline as zen practice, that will become one of particularity of his work in Italy.\n\nAfter five years training in Toshoji, Tetsugen was sent as a buddhist missionary in Italy, and in 1988 grounded the first monastery in Milan, Enso-ji il Cerchio.

{"id": "357796", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=357796", "title": "Constructivist epistemology", "text": "Constructivist epistemology\n\nConstructivist epistemology is a branch in philosophy of science maintaining that scientific knowledge is constructed by the scientific community, who seek to measure and construct models of the natural world. Natural science therefore consists of mental constructs that aim to explain sensory experience and measurements.\n\nAccording to constructivists, the world is independent of human minds, but knowledge of the world is always a human and social construction. Constructivism opposes the philosophy of objectivism, embracing the belief that a human can come to know the truth about the natural world not mediated by scientific approximations with different degrees of validity and accuracy.\n\nAccording to constructivists there is no single valid methodology in science, but rather a diversity of useful methods.\n\nThe term originates from psychology, education, and social constructivism. The expression \"constructivist epistemology\" was first used by Jean Piaget, 1967, with plural form in the famous article from the \"Encyclopédie de la Pléiade\" \"Logique et connaissance scientifique\" or \"Logic and Scientific knowledge\", an important text for epistemology. He refers directly to the mathematician Brouwer and his \"radical constructivism\".\n\nThe terms \"Constructionism\" and \"constructivism\" are often, but should not be, used interchangeably. Constructionism is an approach to learning that was developed by Papert; the approach was greatly influenced by his work with Piaget, but it is very different. Constructionism involves the creation of a product to show learning. It is believed by constructivists that representations of physical and biological reality, including race, sexuality, and gender, as well as tables, chairs and atoms are socially constructed. Marx was among the first to suggest such an ambitious expansion of the power of ideas to inform the material realities of people's lives.\n\nConstructivism stems from a number of philosophies. For instance, early development can be attributed to the thought of Greek philosophers such as Heraclitus (\"Everything flows, nothing stands still\"), Protagoras (\"Man is the measure of all things\"). Protagoras is clearly represented by Plato and hence the tradition as a relativist. The Pyrrhonist sceptics have also been so interpreted. (Although this is more contentious.)\n\nFollowing the Renaissance and the Enlightenment, with the phenomenology and the event, Kant gives a decisive contradiction to Cartesians' epistemology that has grown since Descartes despite Giambattista Vico calling in \"Scienza nuova\" (\"New Science\") in 1725 that \"the norm of the truth is to have made it\". The Enlightenment's claim of the universality of Reason as the only true source of knowledge generated a Romantic reaction involving an emphasis on the separate natures of races, species, sexes and types of human.\n\n\nOne version of \"social constructivism\" contends that categories of knowledge and reality are actively created by social relationships and interactions. These interactions also alter the way in which scientific episteme is organized.\n\nSocial activity presupposes human beings inhabiting shared forms of life, and in the case of social construction, utilizing semiotic resources (meaning-making and signifying) with reference to social structures and institutions. Several traditions use the term \"Social Constructivism\": psychology (after Lev Vygotsky), sociology (after Peter Berger and Thomas Luckmann, themselves influenced by Alfred Schütz), sociology of knowledge (David Bloor), sociology of mathematics (Sal Restivo), philosophy of mathematics (Paul Ernest). Ludwig Wittgenstein's later philosophy can be seen as a foundation for \"social constructivism\", with its key theoretical concepts of \"language games\" embedded in \"forms of life\".\n\nThomas Kuhn argued that changes in scientists' views of reality not only contain subjective elements, but result from group dynamics, \"revolutions\" in scientific practice and changes in \"paradigms\". As an example, Kuhn suggested that the Sun-centric Copernican \"revolution\" replaced the Earth-centric views of Ptolemy not because of empirical failures, but because of a new \"paradigm\" that exerted control over what scientists felt to be the more fruitful way to pursue their goals.\nThe view of reality as accessible only through models was called model-dependent realism by Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow. While not rejecting an independent reality, model-dependent realism says that we can know only an approximation of it provided by the intermediary of models.\nThese models evolve over time as guided by scientific inspiration and experiment.\n\nIn the field of the social sciences, constructivism as an epistemology urges that researchers reflect upon the paradigms that may be underpinning their research, and in the light of this that they become more open to consider other ways of interpreting any results of the research. Furthermore, the focus is on presenting results as negotiable constructs rather than as models that aim to \"represent\" social realities more or less accurately. Norma Romm in her book Accountability in Social Research (2001) argues that social researchers can earn trust from participants and wider audiences insofar as they adopt this orientation and invite inputs from others regarding their inquiry practices and the results thereof.\n\nIn psychology, constructivism refers to many schools of thought that, though extraordinarily different in their techniques (applied in fields such as education and psychotherapy), are all connected by a common critique of previous standard approaches, and by shared assumptions about the active constructive nature of human knowledge. In particular, the critique is aimed at the \"associationist\" postulate of empiricism, \"by which the mind is conceived as a passive system that gathers its contents from its environment and, through the act of knowing, produces a copy of the order of reality.\"\n\nIn contrast, \"constructivism is an epistemological premise grounded on the assertion that, in the act of knowing, it is the human mind that actively gives meaning and order to that reality to which it is responding\".\nThe constructivist psychologies theorize about and investigate how human beings create systems for meaningfully understanding their worlds and experiences.\n\nJoe L. Kincheloe has published numerous social and educational books on critical constructivism (2001, 2005, 2008), a version of constructivist epistemology that places emphasis on the exaggerated influence of political and cultural power in the construction of knowledge, consciousness, and views of reality. In the contemporary mediated electronic era, Kincheloe argues, dominant modes of power have never exerted such influence on human affairs. Coming from a critical pedagogical perspective, Kincheloe argues that understanding a critical constructivist epistemology is central to becoming an educated person and to the institution of just social change.\n\nKincheloe's characteristics of critical constructivism:\n\n\nFor some social constructionism has been described as a source of the postmodern movement, and has been influential in the field of cultural studies. Some have gone so far as to attribute the rise of cultural studies (the cultural turn) to social constructionism.\n\nFrom a realist's point of view, both postmodernism and constructivism can be interpreted as relativist theories.\n\nCultural constructivism asserts that knowledge and reality are a product of their cultural context, meaning that two independent cultures will likely form different observational methodologies.\n\nErnst von Glasersfeld was a prominent proponent of radical constructivism. This claims that knowledge is not a commodity which is transported from one mind into another. Rather, it is up to the individual to \"link up\" specific interpretations of experiences and ideas with their own reference of what is possible and viable. That is, the process of constructing knowledge, of understanding, is dependent on the individual's subjective interpretation of their active experience, not what \"actually\" occurs. Understanding and acting are seen by radical constructivists not as dualistic processes, but \"circularly conjoined\".\n\n\"Constructivist Foundations\" is a free online journal publishing peer reviewed articles on radical constructivism by researchers from multiple domains.\n\nRelational constructivism can be perceived as a relational consequence of the radical constructivism. In contrary to social constructivism, it picks up the epistemological threads and maintains the radical constructivist idea that humans cannot overcome their limited conditions of reception (i.e. \"self referentially operating cognition\"). Therefore, humans are not able to come to objective conclusions about the world.\n\nIn spite of the subjectivity of human constructions of reality, relational constructivism focusses on the relational conditions applying to human perceptional processes. Björn Kraus puts it in a nutshell:\n\nA series of articles published in the journal \"Critical Inquiry\" (1991) served as a manifesto for the movement of critical constructivism in various disciplines, including the natural sciences. Not only truth and reality, but also \"evidence\", \"document\", \"experience\", \"fact\", \"proof\", and other central categories of empirical research (in physics, biology, statistics, history, law, etc.) reveal their contingent character as a social and ideological construction. Thus, a \"realist\" or \"rationalist\" interpretation is subjected to criticism. Kincheloe's political and pedagogical notion (above) has emerged as a central articulation of the concept.\n\nWhile recognizing the constructedness of reality, many representatives of this critical paradigm deny philosophy the task of the creative construction of reality. They eagerly criticize realistic judgments, but they do not move beyond analytic procedures based on subtle tautologies. They thus remain in the critical paradigm and consider it to be a standard of scientific philosophy per se.\n\nJames Mark Baldwin invented this expression, which was later popularized by Jean Piaget. From 1955 to 1980, Piaget was Director of the International Centre for Genetic Epistemology in Geneva.\n\n\nNumerous criticisms have been leveled at Constructivist epistemology. The most common one is that it either explicitly advocates or implicitly reduces to relativism. This is because it takes the concept of truth to be a socially \"constructed\" (and thereby socially relative) one. This leads to the charge of self-refutation: if what is to be regarded as \"true\" is relative to a particular social formation, then this very conception of truth must itself be only regarded as being \"true\" in this society. In another social formation, it may well be false. If so, then social constructivism itself would be false in that social formation. Further, one could then say that social constructivism could be both true and false simultaneously.\n\nAnother criticism of constructivism is that it holds that the concepts of two different social formations be entirely different and incommensurate. This being the case, it is impossible to make comparative judgements about statements made according to each worldview. This is because the criteria of judgement will themselves have to be based on some worldview or other. If this is the case, then it brings into question how communication between them about the truth or falsity of any given statement could be established.\n\nSocial Constructivists often argue that constructivism is liberating because it either (1) enables oppressed groups to reconstruct \"the World\" in accordance with their own interests rather than according to the interests of dominant groups in society, or (2) compels people to respect the alternative worldviews of oppressed groups because there is no way of judging them to be inferior to dominant worldviews. As the Wittgensteinian philosopher Gavin Kitching argues, however, constructivists usually implicitly presuppose a deterministic view of language which severely constrains the minds and use of words by members of societies: they are not just \"constructed\" by language on this view, but are literally \"determined\" by it. Kitching notes the contradiction here: somehow the advocate of constructivism is not similarly constrained. While other individuals are controlled by the dominant concepts of society, the advocate of constructivism can transcend these concepts and see through them.\n\n\n\n"}

It was founded in Lighthouse Point, Florida by Ben Klassen as the Church of the Creator in 1973. The worldview of Creativity is purported to be based on the \"survival, expansion and advancement of the White race\", according to the \"external laws of nature, the experience of history, on logic and common sense\" and members of the movement believe in a \"racial holy war\" between the \"white and non-White races\" (including Jews, black people and non-white people of \"mixed race\").\n\nCreativity is promoted by two organizations: the Creativity Alliance (CA – also known as the Church of Creativity) and the Creativity Movement (TCM). The groups have common origins.\n\nAdherents of Creativity are known as \"Creators\". The church was originally founded as the \"Church of the Creator\" by Ben Klassen in 1973. Matthew F. Hale in 1996 formed a separate group known as the \"World Church of the Creator\" which largely supplanted the original Ben Klassen Church. The World Church of the Creator which – as of 2003 – has devolved into \"The Creativity Movement\". \n\nRights to use the name \"Church of the Creator\" was lost by Hale in the United States to the Church of the Creator, an unaffiliated religious organization based in Ashland, Oregon, in a trademark-infringement case. Membership in the Creativity movement is restricted to persons whose genetic heritage is \"wholly or predominantly\" from Europe or members of the white race, regardless of where they reside. The term \"Creator\" does not refer to a supernatural being, but to adherents of Creativity and the White Race (which is credited with the creation of civilization).\n\nFollowing the demise of the World Church of the Creator after Hale's arrest in 2003, there formed two distinct groups known as The Creativity Movement and the Creativity Alliance/Church of Creativity. The two groups are not known to interact with one another.\n\nCreators are taught to hate non-whites and to avoid interacting with them socially. Creators are also expected to refute homosexuality, miscegenation, whining or complaining, and superstition. Creativity has sixteen race-based commandments and five fundamental beliefs which members regard as based on the \"external laws of nature, the experience of history, on logic and common sense\". These include the belief that \"race is their religion\", that the white race is \"nature's finest\", belief that race-loyalty is transcendent and that the \"survival, expansion and advancement\" of the white race on Earth is the \"highest virtue\". They believe that American culture is becoming \"more decadent,\" as evidenced by \"black crimes, the growing acceptance of homosexuality, interracial marriage, increasing drug use, and the lack of racial identity among white people\". According to the Anti-Defamation League, members believe that Jewish people are working towards the enslavement of all races, and in particular the \"mongrelization of the white race\". Creators are encouraged to recite the \"five fundamentals\" daily. Klassen encouraged Creators to refer to Black people as \"niggers\" and openly opposed white supremacists who used more polite terms. During the early 2000s, they were encouraged to move to Central Illinois in order to establish a Creativity bastion. \n\nCreativity promotes a religious diet and health doctrine, called the 14 Points of Salubrious Living (a form of raw-food veganism), although it is not a religious requirement.\n\nCreativity is a non-supernatural religion which rejects the supernatural while affirming a pantheist view of nature, asserting that \"everything is in nature\" and defining it as \"the whole cosmos, the total universe, including its millions of natural laws through space and time.\" According to Klassen, \"A Creator is not superstitious and disdains belief in the supernatural. He will waste no time giving credence to, or playing silly games with imaginary spooks, spirits, gods and demons.\" Creators do not believe in a supernatural afterlife believing \"immortality\" to be genetic and memorial with a cessation of consciousness at death. They believe that they should view life and death on Earth in a \"rational, fearless manner,\" concentrating on life's positive aspects.\n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center classifies Creativity's ideology as neo-Nazi, According to Klassen, Creativity is not a rehash of Nazism and he listed eight differences between his political ideology and that of the Nazis. He adopted the phrase \"racial socialism\" to describe his political ideology. Klassen was critical of democracy and advocated meritocracy, believing that effective leaders should rule. Under racial socialism, \"whites would work together toward common goals but without the massive economic planning in the style of the Soviet Gosplan.\" He supported a limited market economy, believing that social and economic activities should be in the best interests of white people. Klassen criticized \"leftist proclivities\" to recruit from the white working class: \"All [white] members of the national or racial community ... had an important role to play.\"\n\nKlassen urged Creators to \"work feverishly and aggressively to organize politically, to distribute literature on behalf of the White Race, to promote and foster White solidarity, and to get control of the government and the political machinery of the state by legal means if possible. If this is not possible by legal means, then we must resort to the same means as our forefathers used two hundred years ago to defend their liberty, their property, their homes and their families.\"\n\nCreativity advocates proselytism. Its goal is to place 10 million copies of two books, \"Nature's Eternal Religion\" and \"The White Man's Bible\", into the hands of white people as part of its belief in \"gird[ing] up for total war\". It teaches the white genocide conspiracy theory in support of its perception that shifting population demographics is leading to miscegenation. \n\nAccording to the Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance, the Creativity Movement opposes illegal activity and violence, believing it to be counterproductive. The church's member handbook threatens expulsion from the church for members who commit crimes or encourage others to do so. Despite this, the church has been connected to multiple religiously and racially inspired violent crimes. Creators view \"racial holy war\" (Rahowa) as a religious war of racial self-defense. The \"White Man's Bible\" calls for readers to, \"use any means, legal or otherwise, available to us for our own survival,\" leading to the hunting down and eliminating of \"tormentors\".\n\nThe religion has several holidays. Creators are encouraged to observe them, spending time with their families and friends of the religion:\n\nCreativity has four sacraments: marriage, pledging for children, confirmation, and eulogizing the dead. All ceremonies are performed by church ministers. At a wedding, the bride and groom exchange vows before Nature. The pledging ceremony is ideally conducted a week after a child's birth, with both parents pledging to raise their child as a \"loyal member of the White Race and faithful to the church.\" The confirmation ceremony may be performed on or after a child's 13th birthday.\n\nOn a now-defunct website, Klassen stated that anyone could be an ordained minister in his church, provided they were \"a legitimate White Man or Woman over the age of 16.\" Prospective ministers must demonstrate worthiness and pass written and oral examinations. The written exams consist of 150 questions (requiring a one-paragraph response to each) and an essay. Applicants are encouraged to request recommendations from three established ministers, and the final requirement is the signing of an oath.\n\nCreativity's founding text is \"Nature's Eternal Religion\", which was written by Klassen in 1973. The book proposes that white people are the \"supreme act of creation\", and only white people are capable of divine creativity. The first book critiques Christianity, including the Christian Bible. Many biblical stories, including those of Adam and Eve, Jonah and the whale and the resurrection of Jesus, are considered historically unlikely. The historicity of Jesus is also questioned, with Klassen saying that he can find no independent evidence of his existence. According to Creativity, Christianity is a violent religion which has killed 1,000 fellow Christians for every Christian killed by the Romans. Adherents do not believe in the existence of Jesus, rejecting Christian teachings as a \"suicidal poison\" that was created by Jews and foisted on the white race. They reject the exhortation to love one's enemies, believing that enemies should be hated. Creators also reject the Golden Rule, saying that it does not make \"good sense\" and at a \"closer look\" it is a \"completely unworkable principle.\"\n\nKlassen published other books on his white supremacist philosophy, including \"The White Man's Bible\", which called for violence against any perceived threats to white people.\n\nCreativity was formed in 1973, when Klassen self-published \"Nature's Eternal Religion\". He attempted to recruit neo-Nazis into the church because, apart from disagreements over religion, there was no fundamental conflict between church doctrine and National Socialism. Klassen developed a rapport with National Alliance leader William Luther Pierce; he met Pierce twice in 1975, and they maintained an \"on and off\" relationship for the next 18 years. According to Klassen, he \"never did understand the logic of what [Pierce] called his Cosmotheism religion ... it has not been of any significance as far as our common goal of promoting White racial solidarity was concerned.\" In \"Trials, Tribulations, and Triumphs\", Klassen called Pierce \"a great man and an outstanding intellectual thinker, and ... one of us.\"\n\nIn 1982, Klassen established a Creativity headquarters in Otto, North Carolina. Although his family expected resistance from local residents, Klassen wrote: \"We were not quite prepared for the viciousness of the onslaught by the local paper.\" Opposition grew, and a May 13, 1982 \"Franklin Press\" headline read: \"Pro-Hitler, anti-Christ Leader Headquarters Here\".\n\nApril Harrington (Gaede), mother of Lynx and Lamb Lingelser (Gaede) of the band Prussian Blue, was a longtime supporter of Creativity and a member of the World Church of the Creator naming her third daughter Dresden Hale after its leader Matthew F. Hale before joining the National Alliance and then the splinter National Vanguard Prussian Blue's song \"Stand Up,\" written for David Lane (author of the Fourteen Words), was part of the unreleased \"Free Matt Hale\" CD intended to support the incarcerated Hale. Lamb and Lynx Gaede have denounced the movement, saying that they never chose it and were controlled by their mother.\n\nCobb, who operated the video-sharing website Podblanc, has attempted to take over small towns in the Midwestern United States. He tried to establish an enclave in North Dakota and rename it \"Trump Creativity\" or \"Creativity Trump\" for Donald Trump. A church building purchased by Cobb to establish an enclave was \"burned to the ground\" in Nome, North Dakota.\n\nAlso known as George Eric Hawthorne, Burdi was lead singer of the Canadian metal band Rahowa, leader of the Toronto branch of the Church of the Creator, and founder of Resistance Records. He was convicted of assault, and renounced racism after serving time in prison. Burdi has been credited with a role in Creativity's survival after the death of Ben Klassen.\n\nSeveral years after Klassen's 1993 death, white supremacist Matthew Hale founded the New Church of the Creator (later the World Church of the Creator). Hale made national news when he was denied admission to the Illinois State Bar three times due to his racist beliefs. On November 12, 1999 the Illinois Supreme Court refused to further consider the denial of Hale's law license, continuing \"a decision by its Committee on Character and Fitness that said Hale lacked the moral character to practice law.\" According to Hale, the committee's denial of his law license may have provoked Benjamin Nathaniel Smith's drive-by shootings.\n\nOn January 9, 2003, Hale was arrested and charged with attempting to direct security chief Anthony Evola to murder judge Joan Lefkow. Hale was found guilty of four of five counts (one count of solicitation of murder and three counts of obstruction of justice) on April 26, 2004; in April 2005, he was sentenced to 40 years in a Federal penitentiary.\n\nJohannes Grobbelaar and Jurgen White, Afrikaner Creators and members of the National Socialist Partisans (the paramilitary branch of the Blanke Bevrydingsbeweging), were killed in a November 1991 gun battle with South African police near Upington while attempting to smuggle weapons and explosives into a survivalist compound in Namibia. They were stopped by police, who were suspicious that their vehicle had been stolen. According to the report, while being escorted to a nearby police station they detonated a smoke bomb and attempted to escape. Police discovered their abandoned vehicle five miles away; Grobbelaar and White ambushed them. Two officers were shot, one fatally.\n\nRon McVan, co-founder of the Wotansvolk neo-völkisch pagan group, was once affiliated with the Church of the Creator for two years as its second-in-command; McVan contributed articles and artwork to its periodical, \"Racial Loyalty\", and was a martial-arts instructor for the church. Although Klassen and McVan shared anti-Christian beliefs, McVan sought a more spiritual approach and felt that Creativity needed spirituality. He moved to the Pacific Northwest and founded Wotan's Kindred in Portland, Oregon in 1992, saying that the group was rooted in the \"genetic character and collective identity\" of the white race. \n\nMcVan's associate and co-founder of Wotansvolk David Lane drew inspiration from Creativity, particularly ideas of a \"racial religion\", but didn't agree with Creativity's \"atheistic\" stance and considered himself deist.\n\nWilliam Christopher Gibbs, a Church of Creativity adherent in Georgia and a member of the Creativity Alliance, was arrested for possession of the biological toxin ricin. Gibbs went to a hospital after he accidentally got the ricin on his hands while experimenting with it. \n\nOn September 21, 2018, a Federal judge ordered Gibbss' release from Federal custody because of a technicality: ricin had been inexplicably dropped from the list of illegal biological toxins which are known as \"select agents\" due to changes in the 2004 law and edits to regulations in 2005. The judge did not rule out the possibility that Gibbs could be potentially convicted under another Federal law. Gibbs continued to be incarcerated in the Fannin County, Georgia jail under a misdemeanor charge of reckless conduct which stemmed from his 2017 arrest and a probation violation connected to a 2010 conviction for burglary.\n\nIn 1992, faced with financial and legal problems (including a civil lawsuit filed by the Southern Poverty Law Center) and the death of his wife, the aging Klassen looked for a successor. Although Rudolph G. (\"Butch\") Stanko was favored for the position, he was imprisoned at the time. \n\nShortly before and during McCarty's leadership, Creativity was plagued with legal problems; members were arrested for conspiracy, unlawful firearms possession and their association with the July 1993 firebombing of an NAACP building in Tacoma, Washington. McCarty struggled to keep the group unified. The lawsuit filed by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), seeking damages related to the May 1991 murder of Harold Mansfield, Jr. by Creator George Loeb, finally led to a March 1994 court ruling which fined the Church of the Creator $1,000,000. The court also ruled that Klassen's property sale to Pierce shortly before his suicide was collusion to deny payment to Mansfield's family, ordering Pierce to return his $85,000 profit from the resale of the property. With the church unable to pay the outstanding balance, the SPLC sued for its dissolution to settle the remaining damages and McCarty readily agreed.\n\nMatthew F. Hale founded the New Church of the Creator in 1996 – later renamed the World Church of the Creator. Hale's World Church of the Creator was a new and separate group rather than a direct successor to Ben Klassen's Church of the Creator. Until his arrest in 2003, Hale was the only Pontifex Maximus of the now defunct World Church of the Creator. The current group known as The Creativity Movement is a white power skinhead oriented direct successor to Hale's World Church of the Creator.\n\nHeadquartered in Zion, Illinois, with a heavy concentration of Creators in Montana, and 24 regional branches, it also claims to have local branches and members \"all over the world.\"\n\nIn 2000 the Oregon-based TE-TA-MA Truth Foundation filed a lawsuit against the World Church of the Creator for using the name \"Church of the Creator\", since the Oregon group had trademarked and registered the name in 1982. U.S. District Court Judge Joan Lefkow ruled for the World Church of the Creator. In December 2002, the World Church of the Creator was fined $1,000 for each day it continued using the old name. Further appeals were denied by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2003. Hale was charged with contempt of court and soliciting the murder of judge Joan Lefkow, and sentenced to 40 years' imprisonment on April 6, 2005. Bill White was convicted of threatening a juror in the Matthew Hale case and sentenced to 42 months in prison.\n\nIn early 2017, a group referring to itself as the \"Guardians of the Faith Committee\" of the Creativity Movement elected James Costello of England as its \"Pontifex Maximus\".\n\nAccording to a Southern Poverty Law Center report, in 2015 the Creativity Alliance had groups in Georgia, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Utah and Vermont. Cambeul's title is Church Administrator and refers to his chapter of the group as the Church of Creativity South Australia. The current Pontifex Maximus of Creativity Alliance is Joseph Esposito (Church of Creativity Oregon). The Creativity Alliance was for a short period known as the White Crusaders of the Rahowa (WCOTR), which was founded by former World Church of the Creator Members after Hale's arrest in 2003.\n\nCreativity Alliance members include former Klassen supporters George Loeb and Joseph Esposito, each serving extended prison sentences in Florida. The Alliance has distanced itself from Hale, and no longer actively supports him.\n\nRandolph Dilloway, former Hasta Primus (Secretary or 2nd in Command) of the Creativity Alliance and founder of the defunct Smoky Mountains Church of Creativity, was an accountant for the revived National Alliance (an unaffiliated Neo-Nazi group formerly led by William Luther Pierce author of the Turner Diaries) and assessed financial damage under past leadership. Claiming to fear for his life after discovering (and discussing) the errors, Dilloway contacted police and the SPLC and furnished documents alleging fraud and embezzlement by organization members.\n\nCreativity Alliance members are known to regularly distribute flyers; particularly Australia, and New Zealand. and in 2015 it distributed flyers in Inverbervie (Scotland) and Liverpool.\n\nMembers who have been arrested include a man from the Church of Creativity Georgia who was arrested for attempting to make ricin poison (the charge was later dropped), and a member from Pennsylvania was arrested for violating his probation by distributing racist flyers, hoarding weapons, and participating in white supremacist web forums..\n\nCreativity was recognized as a religion by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin in \"Peterson v. Wilmur Communications\" (205 F.Supp.2d 1014) (2002). The American Civil Liberties Union intervened on behalf of the World Church of the Creator.\n\nCalifornia federal judge Maxine M. Chesney ruled against an imprisoned Creator who brought a suit against Pelican Bay State Prison based on an alleged violation of the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act in \"Conner v. Tilton\", 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 111892 (ND CA, Dec. 2, 2009), in which Creativity and several other organizations and belief systems (including MOVE, veganism and the Church of Marijuana) were declared to not constitute \"religions\" but moral or secular philosophies under the definition of religion based on addressing of \"fundamental and ultimate questions having to do with deep and imponderable matters\" as part of a three-point test for determining religion developed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. The court concluded that the plaintiff had failed to raise a genuine issue about whether Creativity is a religion; it found that to the extent Creativity deals with a \"fundamental concern\", the concern is with secular matters and not with what the court considered to be religious principles. Creativity is not \"comprehensive\" in nature because it was presented as confined to one question (or moral teaching), and that the structural characteristics of Creativity \"do not serve to transform what are otherwise secular teachings and ideals into a religious ideology.\" In \"Hale v. Federal Bureau of Prisons\" (2015), the court found that Creativity may qualify as a religion under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution (with potential tax exemption by the IRS) and may be practiced in prison.\n\nIn March 2015, leaflets were posted on doors in southern Liverpool in the United Kingdom saying: \"The white race is nature’s finest\". Cailen Cambeul, Creativity minister and then Pontifex Maximus for the Creativity Alliance, said that he was responsible for their distribution. Complaints were made to the police by local councilors. Sarah Jennings of the local Green Party denounced Creativity as a \"fringe group of blatant racists\". According to Cambeul, \"Any politician claiming disgust at our flyers and seeking to make political gains via our 100-percent-legal message is partaking in an opportunistic abuse of power at the expense of innocent people exercising their rights to speak out against the injustices of a politically correct world.\"\n\nIn the United States, northwest Montana and in particular the Flathead Valley, part-time home of Alt-Right leader Richard B. Spencer has seen a \"flurry of racist fliers\" promoting the Creativity movement. The Southern Poverty Law Center listed Creativity Alliance presence in the state in 2015.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "949007", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=949007", "title": "Dhāraṇā", "text": "Dhāraṇā\n\nDhāraṇā (from Sanskrit धारणा) is translated as \"collection or concentration of the mind (joined with the retention of breath)\", or \"the act of holding, bearing, wearing, supporting, maintaining, retaining, keeping back (in remembrance), a good memory\", or \"firmness, steadfastness, ... , certainty\". This term is related to the verbal root \"dhri\" to hold, carry, maintain, resolve. Dharana is the noun.\n\n\"Dhāraṇā\" is the sixth stage, step or limb of eight elucidated by Patanjali's Ashtanga Yoga or Raja Yoga. For a detailed account of the Eight Limbs, refer to the \"Yoga Sutras of Patanjali\".\n\n\"Dhāraṇā\" may be translated as \"holding\", \"holding steady\", \"concentration\" or \"single focus\". The prior limb Pratyahara involves withdrawing the senses from external phenomena. \"Dhāraṇā\" builds further upon this by refining it further to \"ekagrata\" or \"ekagra chitta\", that is single-pointed concentration and focus, which is in this context cognate with Samatha. Maehle (2006: p. 234) defines Dharana as: \"The mind thinks about one object and avoids other thoughts; awareness of the object is still interrupted.\"\n\n\"Dhāraṇā\" is the initial step of deep concentrative meditation, where the object being focused upon is held in the mind without consciousness wavering from it. The difference between \"Dhāraṇā\", Dhyāna, and Samādhi (their \"integration\" constituting Samyama) is that in the former, the object of meditation, the mystic, and the act of meditation itself remain separate. That is, the mystic or the mystic's meta-awareness is conscious of meditating (that is, is conscious of the act of meditation) on an object, and of one's own self, which is concentrating on the object. As the seer becomes more advanced, dwelling in the subsequent stage of Dhyāna, consciousness of the act of meditation disappears, and only the consciousness of being/existing and the object of concentration register (in the mind). In the final stage of Samādhi, the ego-mind also dissolves, and the seer becomes one with the object. Generally, the object of concentration is God, or the Self, which is seen as an expression of God.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "10793548", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10793548", "title": "Duke Yansheng", "text": "Duke Yansheng\n\nThe Duke of Yansheng, literally \"Duke Overflowing with Sagacity\", sometimes translated as Holy Duke of Yen, was a Chinese title of nobility. It was originally created as a marquis title in the Western Han dynasty (206 BC – AD 9) for a direct descendant of Confucius.\n\nFrom the Western Han dynasty to the mid-Northern Song dynasty (960–1127), the title underwent several changes in its name, before it was finally settled as \"Duke Yansheng\" in 1005 by Emperor Renzong of the Northern Song dynasty. Kong Zongyuan, a 46th-generation descendant of Confucius, became the first person to hold the title \"Duke Yansheng\". The dukes enjoyed privileges that other nobles were denied, such as the right to tax their domain in Qufu while being exempt from imperial taxes. Their dukedom had its own judicial system and the legal capacity to mete out capital punishment, although such sentences had to be ratified by the imperial court.\n\nIn 1935, the Nationalist government of the Republic of China converted the Duke Yansheng title to a political office, \"Dacheng Zhisheng Xianshi Fengsi Guan\" (大成至聖先師奉祀官), which simply means \"Sacrificial Official to Confucius\". This political office is not only hereditary, but also had the same ranking and remuneration as that of a cabinet minister in the government of the Republic of China. In 2008, with permission from the Kong family, the political office became an unpaid one which is purely ceremonial in nature. It is currently held by Kung Tsui-chang, a 79th-generation descendant of Confucius.\n\nThere are also similar political offices for the descendants of the other notable members of the Confucian school (the Four Sages), such as \"Sacrificial Official to Mencius\", \"Sacrificial Official to Zengzi\", and \"Sacrificial Official to Yan Hui\". In the reformation of the law in 2009, \"Sacrificial Official to Mencius\" and \"Sacrificial Official to Zengzi\" would become unpaid honorable titles as well once the incumbent officials decease.\n\nThe tombs of the Dukes Yansheng of the Ming and Qing dynasties are located at the Cemetery of Confucius in Qufu, Shandong.\n\nKong Qiu (551–479 BC), better known as Confucius, was a teacher, politician and philosopher of the State of Lu in the Spring and Autumn period of ancient China. He was a descendant of the royal family of the Shang dynasty (c. 1558–1046 BC) through the dukes of the State of Song (11th century – 286 BC).\n\nDuring the reign of Qin Shi Huang (r. 247–210 BC), the First Emperor of the Qin dynasty, Kong Fu (孔鮒), a ninth-generation descendant of Confucius, was awarded the title \"Lord Wentong of Lu\" (魯國文通君) and the appointment of \"shaofu\" (少傅).\n\nIn 190 BC, Emperor Gao of the Han dynasty awarded the title \"Lord Fengsi\" (奉祀君; \"Lord Who Offers Sacrifices\") to Kong Teng (孔騰), Kong Fu's younger brother.\n\nDuring the reign of Emperor Yuan (r. 48–33 BC), Kong Ba (孔霸), a 13th-generation descendant of Confucius, was granted the title \"Lord Baocheng\" (褒成君). In addition, the income gained from the 800 taxable households in Kong Ba's fief were used to finance the worshipping of Confucius. Kong Ba also instructed his eldest son, Kong Fu (孔福), to return to their ancestral home to serve as a sacrificial official to their ancestor.\n\nThe title \"Marquis Yinshaojia\" (殷紹嘉侯) was conferred on Kong Ji (孔吉), a 14th-generation \"di\" descendant of Confucius, by \nEmperor Cheng (r. 33–7 BC). The emperor also allowed Kong Ji to perform ritual sacrifices to Cheng Tang, the first king of the Shang dynasty, and granted him the \"er wang san ke\" (二王三恪) ceremonial privilege.\n\nDuring the reign of Emperor Ping (r. 1 BC – 6 AD), granted the title \"Marquis Baocheng\" (褒成侯) to Kong Jun (孔均), a 16th-generation descendant of Confucius.\n\nEmperor Ming (r. 58–75 AD) awarded Kong Juan (孔損), an 18th-generation descendant of Confucius, the title \"Marquis of Bao Village\" (褒亭侯).\n\nEmperor An (r. 106–125 AD) gave the title \"Marquis of Fengsheng Village\" (奉聖亭侯) to Kong Yao (孔曜), a 19th-generation descendant of Confucius.\n\nThe title of Duke of Song and \"Duke Who Continues and Honours the Yin\" (殷紹嘉公) were bestowed upon Kong An (孔安 (東漢) by the Eastern Han dynasty because he was part of the Shang dynasty's legacy. This branch of the Confucius family was a separate branch from the line that held the title of Marquis of Fengsheng village and later Duke Yansheng. This practice was referred to as 二王三恪.\n\nDuring the Three Kingdoms period, the state of Cao Wei (220–265) renamed the title \"Marquis Baocheng\" (褒成侯) to \"Marquis Zongsheng\" (宗聖侯).\n\nThe Jin (265–420) and Liu Song (420–479) dynasties changed the title to \"Marquis of Fengsheng Village\" (奉聖亭侯).\n\nThe Northern Wei dynasty (386–535) changed the title to \"Marquis Chongsheng\" (崇聖侯) while the Northern Qi dynasty (550–577) called it \"Marquis Gongsheng\" (恭聖侯). Under the Northern Zhou dynasty (557–581), the title was promoted from a marquis title to a ducal title, \"Duke of Zou\" (鄒國公).\n\nA fief of 100 households and the rank of 崇聖侯 \"Marquis who worships the sage\" was bestowed upon a Confucius descendant, Yan Hui's lineage had 2 of its scions and Confucius's lineage had 4 of its scions who had ranks bestowed on them in Shandong in 495 and a fief of ten households and rank of 崇聖大夫 \"Grandee who venerates the sage\" was bestowed on 孔乘 Kong Sheng who was Confucius's scion in the 28th generation in 472 by Emperor Xiaowen of Northern Wei.\n\nIn the Sui dynasty, Emperor Wen (r. 581–604) awarded the title \"Duke of Zou\" (鄒國公) to Confucius's descendants, but Emperor Yang (r. 604–618) downgraded and renamed the title to \"Marquis Shaosheng\" (紹聖侯).\n\nDuring the early Tang dynasty, the title was renamed to \"Marquis Baosheng\" (褒聖侯). In the Kaiyuan era (713–741) of the reign of Emperor Xuanzong, the emperor posthumously honoured Confucius as \"Prince Wenxuan\" (文宣王) and promoted the \"Marquis Baosheng\" title to \"Duke Wenxuan\" (文宣公).\n\nDuke Wenxuan Kong Renyu lived during the Later Tang dynasty.\n\nA line in the Book of Rites had an interpretation written by Kong Yingda. Kong Yingda wrote some interpretations on the Record of Music. 禮記正義 was compiled by Kong Yingda. Kong Yingda wrote a new edition of the Shijing. Confucius' scion in the 32nd generation Kong Yingda wrote interpritations of the Confucian 5 Classics called the 五經正義 Wujing zhengyi. A description was written by Kong Yingda on the Di sacrifice. Zhaomu were also mentioned by Kong.\n\nIn 1055, Emperor Renzong, changed the \"Duke Wenxuan\" title to \"Duke Yansheng\" (孔宗願) to avoid naming taboo associated with the posthumous names of the earlier emperors. The title \"Duke Yansheng\" was then awarded to Kong Zongyuan (孔宗願), a 46th-generation descendant of Confucius. It was later changed to \"Duke Fengsheng\" (奉聖公) but was quickly restored back to \"Duke Yansheng\", and has since then been known as \"Duke Yansheng\".\n\nDuring the wars between the Song dynasty and Jurchen-led Jin dynasty (1115–1234), the Song capital, Kaifeng, was conquered by Jin forces in 1127. Remnants of the Song dynasty retreated south and established the Southern Song dynasty, with Emperor Gaozong (r. 1127–1162) as their ruler. Kong Duanyou (孔端友), who then held the Duke Yansheng title, also moved to the south and settled in Quzhou, Zhejiang, where the southern branch of Confucius's descendants was created. Kong Duancao (孔端操), Kong Duanyou's brother, remained in Qufu, Shandong, where he called himself the \"acting Duke Yansheng\". Later on, the Jin dynasty recognised Kong Duancao's legitimacy. This resulted in a north-south split among the descendants of Confucius. Historians regarded the southern branch as the \"di\" (legitimate) successor to Confucius's line, while the northern branch is seen as a \"shu\" (offshoot) branch.\n\nThe Kongs in Qufu had a genealogy compiled during the Northern Song which described disciples with Confucius images. A pavilion was built by the Jin in the 1190s in the Confucius temple of Qufu over a Song dynasty era dais constructed in 1022. The dias built by the Song and modified by the Jin was depicted in the 1242 Kongshi zuting guangji genealogy written by Kong Yuancuo. The genealogy written by Kong Yuancuo contains Kong Chuan's 祖庭廣記 Zuting zaji with 孔瓌 Kong Gui's (scion in the 49th generation) introduction. Kongshi zuting guangji shows pictures of the Song and Jin dynasty era temple of Confucius.\n\nQuzhou was where the Gaozong followers from the Kong family evacuated to.\n\nThe Quzhou temple is home to a rubbed Confucius portrait while the Qufu one has a tablet amade out of stone with a rubbed portrait of Yan Hui and Confcuius while the Qufu temple has another Confucius icon.\n\n孔清覺 Kong Qingjue led a White Cloud 白雲宗 group.\n\nIn 1134 東家雜記 Dongjia zaji was written by 孔傳 Kong Chuan.\n\nIn the temple in Qufu an image on a stele was set up by the scion in the 48th generation Kong Duanyou. The temple contained the smalle portrait of Yan Hui and Confucius as recorded by Kong Zonghan. A cadet branch scion in the 49th generation 孔瑀 Kong Yu in 118 patronized the construction of the portrait on a second stele.\n\n孔宗壽 Kong Zong scio, a scion in the 46th generation in 1096 in the temple in Qufu installed a tablet depicting a portrait of 10 disciples with Confucius which Kong Zonghan mentioned. The portrait was included in the genealogy Kongshi zuting guangji of Kong Yuancuo. Another image was not redrawn by Kong Yuancuo by was mentioned by Kong Zongyuan, which showed all 72 disciples with Confucius.\n\nIn the Quzhou temple Kong Chuan and Kong Duanyou patronized the creation of a Confucius image.\n\n46th generation descendant 孔宗翰 Kong Zonghan wrote in 1085 a new genealogy. Confucius portraits were spread around in Qufu by Confucius's scions. A genealogy was written in 1085 by Kong Zonghan which described disciples and Confucius images. The genealogy of Kong Yuancuo contained one of the images which also appeared in the temple in Qufu and according to Kong Chuan it was drawn by Qu Daozi.\n\n孔氏祖庭廣記 Kongshi zuting guangji was compiled by 孔元措 Kong Yuancuo.\n\nKong Chuan's genealogy was succeeded in 1242 the publishing of the 1227 genealogy written by the Jin dynasty Duke Yansheng of the 51st generation 孔元措 Kong Yuancuo.\n\nThe Quzhou-based scion in the 53rd generation during the Yuan dynasty 孔濂 Kong Lian wrote commentary on a stele at Quzhou which said that Kong Chuan and his nephew Kong Duanyou created a stone carved image of Confucius.\n\nFrom 1127 up to the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty, there were two Duke Yanshengs – one in Quzhou, Zhejiang (in the south) and the other in Qufu, Shandong (in the north). In 1233, Ögedei Khan (r. 1229–1241) granted the Duke Yansheng title to Kong Yuancuo (孔元措), a 51st-generation descendant of Confucius from the northern branch.\n\nKublai Khan (r. 1260–1294) originally wanted to merge the two Duke Yanshengs under the southern one by making Kong Zhu (孔洙), the southern branch's leader, the legitimate successor to the Duke Yansheng line. However, since Kong Zhu declined the offer, Kublai Khan abolished the southern Duke Yansheng title and appointed Kong Zhu as the \"jijiu\" (祭酒) of the Imperial Academy. Since then, the northern branch has remained as the \"legitimate\" heir to the Duke Yansheng line.\n\nIn 1307, shortly after his enthronement, Külüg Khan (r. 1307–1311) awarded the posthumous honorary title \"Prince Dacheng Zhisheng Wenxuan\" (大成至聖文宣王) to Confucius.\n\nKong Ruogu 孔若古 aka Kong Chuan(孔傳) 47th generation was claimed to be the ancestor of the Southern branch after Kong Zhu died by Northern branch member Kong Guanghuang.\n\nThe Southern Branch of the Confucius family at Quzhou\n\nDuring the Yuan dynasty, one of Confucius' descendants, who claimed to be one of the Duke Yansheng Kong Huan's 孔浣 sons, named Kong Shao 孔紹, moved from China to Goryeo era Korea and established a branch of the family there after wedding a Korean woman (Jo Jin-gyeong's 曹晉慶 daughter) during Toghon Temür's rule. This branch of the family called the Gong clan of Qufu received aristocratic rank in Joseon era Korea. 曲阜孔氏 (朝鲜半岛) 곡부 공씨\n\nThe Liyang Kongs were descendants of Confucius who lived in southern China during the Yuan dynasty's final years. 孔克齊 Kong Keqi or 孔齊 Kong Qi was a scion of the 55th generation. An account was written by Kong Qi on this era.\n\nIn 1506, the Zhengde Emperor (r. 1505–1521) appointed Kong Yansheng (孔彥繩), a member of the southern branch, as a \"Wujing Boshi\" (五經博士; \"Professor of the Five Classics\") in the Hanlin Academy. The appointment was equivalent to that of an eighth-grade official in the Ming imperial administration. Kong Yansheng's descendants were allowed to inherit the title \"Wujing Boshi\".\n\n(1592-1647) 孔胤植 Kong Yinzhi 孔貞叢 in 1609 Kong Zhencong in 1552 孔弘干 Kong Honggan 闕里誌 all edited the Queli zhi genealogy.\n\nOn 31 October 1644, the Shunzhi Emperor (r. 1643–1661) of the Manchu-led Qing dynasty confirmed and recognised the legitimacies of the Duke Yansheng and Wujing Boshi titles after the Qing capital was established in Beijing following the Qing conquest of China.\n\n毕沅 Bi Yuan's, 李长森 Li Changsen's and 方受畴 Fang Shouchou's (nephew of Fang Guancheng) female progeny married 孔繁灏 Kong Fanhao.\n\nKong Luhua (relative of the Duke Yansheng) was the second wife of Ruan Yuan.\n\nHeadgear was worn by Kong Lingyi in an official portrait.\n\nAfter the 1911 Xinhai Revolution which overthrew the Manchu-led Qing dynasty, most of the nobility titles used in the imperial era were abolished. The Duke Yansheng title, however, was an exception along with the Marquis of Extended Grace and the descendants of Mencius, Zengzi, and Yan Hui. During the revolution, some Westerners were told that a Han Chinese would be installed as the emperor. The candidate was either the bearer of the Duke Yansheng title, or the holder of the title \"Marquis of Extended Grace\", a title granted to descendants of the imperial family of the Ming dynasty. The Duke Yansheng was proposed for replacing the Qing dynasty as Emperor by Liang Qichao.\n\nIn 1913, the Beiyang government, led by Yuan Shikai, passed a law allowing the Duke Yansheng title to be retained and held by Kong Lingyi (孔令貽), a member of the northern branch. The Wujing Boshi title, on the other hand, was renamed to \"Dacheng Zhisheng Xianshi Nanzong Fengsi Guan\" (大成至聖先師南宗奉祀官) and held by Kong Qingyi (孔慶儀), a member of the southern branch.\n\nYuan Shikai conferred the title of Prince on the Duke immediately before declaring the Empire of China (1915–16).\n\nThe regent for the underage Duke Kong Te-cheng was Kong Lingjun 孔令儁. He was the Kong Family Mansion steward.\n\nIn 1935, the Nationalist government abolished the hereditary peerage systems of the imperial era and converted the Duke Yansheng title into a political office, \"Dacheng Zhisheng Xianshi Fengsi Guan\" (大成至聖先師奉祀官), which simply means \"Sacrificial Official to Confucius\".\n\nDuring the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945), Kung Te-cheng (Kong Decheng), the Sacrificial Official to Confucius, evacuated to Hankou, Wuhan, where he was received by Kung Hsiang-hsi (Kong Xiangxi), a fellow descendant of Confucius. They moved to Chongqing later, where the Nationalist government was based during the war.\n\nAfter the victory of the Communists in the Chinese Civil War, Kung Te-cheng evacuated with the Nationalist government to Taiwan where the current Sacrificial Official to Confucius is based. Until 2008, the office of \"Sacrificial Official to Confucius\" had the same ranking and remuneration as that of a cabinet minister in the government of the Republic of China in Taiwan. On the other hand, Yan Shiyung (顏世鏞, the last Sacrificial Official to Yan Hui, 1903-1975) and Kung Xiangkai (孔祥楷, the last Dacheng Zhisheng Xianshi Nanzong Fengsi Guan, 1938-) didn't move to Taiwan, so their title was abolished after the establishment of People's Republic of China.\n\nIn 1998, the Taiwanese government demolished the office building of the sacrificial official but retained the appointment. The hostel of National Chung Hsing University along Guoguang Road in South District, Taichung is situated at the former location of the office building.\n\nIn 2008, with approval from the Kong family, Taiwan's Ministry of the Interior converted the sacrificial official appointment into an unpaid one. The office is currently held by Kung Tsui-chang (Kong Chuichang), a 79th-generation descendant of Confucius who was appointed in September 2009 after the death of his grandfather, Kung Te-cheng. The Ministry of Interior also declared that female descendants of Confucius are eligible for future appointment.\n\nThe southern branch still remained in Quzhou where they lived to this day, and the title of . Confucius's descendants in Quzhou alone number 30,000. The leader of the southern branch is 孔祥楷 (Kong Xiangkai), a 75th-generation descendant of Confucius.\n\nTraditionally, the descendants of Confucius use generation poems for their names given to them by the Ming and Qing Emperors along with the descendants of the other Four Sages 四氏. However, Yan family, one of the Four Sages and descendants of Yanyuan, didn't use the poem eventually because Yanyuan is considered to be a possible maternal cousin of Confucius, so Emperor Yingzong of Ming made another generation poem for Yan family.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "10152", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10152", "title": "Erasmus", "text": "Erasmus\n\nDesiderius Erasmus Roterodamus (; 28 October 1466 – 12 July 1536), known as Erasmus or Erasmus of Rotterdam, was a Dutch Christian humanist who was the greatest scholar of the northern Renaissance. Originally trained as a Catholic priest, Erasmus was an important figure in classical scholarship who wrote in a pure Latin style. Among humanists he enjoyed the sobriquet \"Prince of the Humanists\", and has been called \"the crowning glory of the Christian humanists\". Using humanist techniques for working on texts, he prepared important new Latin and Greek editions of the New Testament, which raised questions that would be influential in the Protestant Reformation and Catholic Counter-Reformation. He also wrote \"On Free Will,\" \"In Praise of Folly\", \"Handbook of a Christian Knight\", \"On Civility in Children\", \"\", \"Julius Exclusus\", and many other works.\n\nErasmus lived against the backdrop of the growing European religious Reformation, but while he was critical of the abuses within the Catholic Church and called for reform, he kept his distance from Luther and Melanchthon and continued to recognise the authority of the pope, emphasizing a middle way with a deep respect for traditional faith, piety and grace, rejecting Luther's emphasis on faith alone. Erasmus remained a member of the Roman Catholic Church all his life,\nremaining committed to reforming the Church and its clerics' abuses from within. He also held to the Catholic doctrine of free will, which some Reformers rejected in favor of the doctrine of predestination. His middle road (\"Via Media\") approach disappointed, and even angered, scholars in both camps.\n\nErasmus died suddenly in Basel in 1536 while preparing to return to Brabant, and was buried in Basel Minster, the former cathedral of the city. A bronze statue of Erasmus was erected in 1622 in his city of birth, replacing an earlier work in stone.\n\nDesiderius Erasmus is reported to have been born in Rotterdam on 28 October in the late 1460s.\nHe was named after Saint Erasmus of Formiae, whom Erasmus's father Gerard personally favored. A 17th-century legend has it that Erasmus was first named Geert Geerts (also Gerhard Gerhards or Gerrit Gerritsz), but this is unfounded. A well-known wooden picture indicates: \"Goudæ conceptus, Roterodami natus\" (Latin for \"Conceived in Gouda, born in Rotterdam)\". According to an article by historian Renier Snooy (1478–1537), Erasmus was born in Gouda.\n\nThe exact year of his birth is controversial, but most agree it was in 1466. Evidence confirming the year of Erasmus' birth in 1466 can be found in his own words: fifteen out of twenty-three statements he made about his age indicate 1466. He was christened \"Erasmus\" after the saint of that name. Although associated closely with Rotterdam, he lived there for only four years, never to return. Information on his family and early life comes mainly from vague references in his writings. His parents were not legally married. His father, Gerard, was a Catholic priest and curate in Gouda. Little is known of his mother, although her known name was Margaretha Rogerius (Latinized form of Dutch surname 'Rutgers') and she was the daughter of a doctor from Zevenbergen. She may have been Gerard's housekeeper. Although he was born out of wedlock, Erasmus was cared for by his parents until their early deaths from the plague in 1483. This solidified his view of his origin as a stain, and cast a pall over his youth.\n\nErasmus was given the highest education available to a young man of his day, in a series of monastic or semi-monastic schools. At the age of nine, he and his older brother Peter were sent to one of the best Latin schools in the Netherlands, located at Deventer and owned by the chapter clergy of the Lebuïnuskerk (St Lebuin's Church), though some earlier biographies assert it was a school run by the Brethren of the Common Life. During his stay there the curriculum was renewed by the principal of the school, Alexander Hegius. For the first time ever Greek was taught at a lower level than a university in Europe, and this is where he began learning it. He also gleaned there the importance of a personal relationship with God but eschewed the harsh rules and strict methods of the religious brothers and educators. His education there ended when plague struck the city about 1483, and his mother, who had moved to provide a home for her sons, died from the infection.\n\nMost likely in 1487, poverty forced Erasmus into the consecrated life as a canon regular of St. Augustine at the canonry of Stein, in South Holland. He took vows there in late 1488, and was ordained to the Catholic priesthood at about the age of 25, in 1492. It is said that he never seemed to have actively worked as a priest for a longer time, and certain abuses in religious orders were among the chief objects of his later calls to reform the Church from within.\n\nWhile at Stein, Erasmus fell in love with a fellow canon, Servatius Rogerus, and wrote a series of passionate letters in which he called Rogerus \"half my soul\". He wrote, \"I have wooed you both unhappily and relentlessly\". This correspondence contrasts sharply with the generally detached and much more restrained attitude he showed in his later life. Later, while tutoring in Paris, he was suddenly dismissed by the guardian of Thomas Grey. Some have taken this as evidence of an illicit affair. No personal denunciation was made of Erasmus during his lifetime, however, and he took pains in later life to distance these earlier episodes by condemning sodomy in his works, and praising sexual desire in marriage between men and women.\n\nSoon after his priestly ordination, he got his chance to leave the canonry when offered the post of secretary to the Bishop of Cambrai, Henry of Bergen, on account of his great skill in Latin and his reputation as a man of letters. To allow him to accept that post, he was given a temporary dispensation from his religious vows on the grounds of poor health and love of Humanistic studies, though he remained a priest. Pope Leo X later made the dispensation permanent, a considerable privilege at the time.\n\nIn 1495, with Bishop Henry's consent and a stipend, Erasmus went on to study at the University of Paris, in the Collège de Montaigu, a centre of reforming zeal, under the direction of the ascetic Jan Standonck, of whose rigors he complained. The University was then the chief seat of Scholastic learning, but already coming under the influence of Renaissance humanism. For instance, Erasmus became an intimate friend of an Italian humanist Publio Fausto Andrelini, poet and \"professor of humanity\" in Paris.\n\nThe chief centres of Erasmus's activity were Paris, Leuven (in the Duchy of Brabant, now in Belgium), England, and Basel; yet he never belonged firmly in any one of these places. In 1499 he was invited back to England by William Blount, 4th Baron Mountjoy, who offered to accompany him on his trip back to England. Erasmus was \"ever susceptible to the charms of attractive, well-connected, and rich young men\". His time in England was fruitful in the making of lifelong friendships with the leaders of English thought in the days of King Henry VIII: John Colet, Thomas More, John Fisher, Thomas Linacre and William Grocyn. At the University of Cambridge, he was the Lady Margaret's Professor of Divinity and had the option of spending the rest of his life as an English professor. He stayed at Queens' College, Cambridge from 1510 to 1515. His rooms were in the \"I\" staircase of Old Court, and he famously hated English ale and English weather.\n\nErasmus suffered from poor health and complained that Queens' could not supply him with enough decent wine (wine was the Renaissance medicine for gallstones, from which Erasmus suffered). Until the early 20th-century, Queens' College used to have a corkscrew that was purported to be \"Erasmus' corkscrew\" which was a third of a metre long, though today the college still has what it calls \"Erasmus' chair\". Today Queens' College has an Erasmus Building and an Erasmus Room. His legacy is marked for someone who complained bitterly about the lack of comforts and luxuries to which he was accustomed. As Queens' was an unusually humanist-leaning institution in the 16th century, Queens' College Old Library still houses many first editions of Erasmus' publications, many of which were acquired during that period by bequest or purchase, including Erasmus' New Testament translation which is signed by friend and Polish religious reformer Jan Laski. Erasmus' friend, Chancellor John Fisher, was president of Queens' College from 1505 to 1508. His friendship with Fisher is the reason he chose to stay at Queens' while lecturing in Greek at the University.\n\nDuring his first visit to England in 1499, he taught at the University of Oxford. Erasmus was particularly impressed by the Bible teaching of John Colet who pursued a style more akin to the church fathers than the Scholastics. This prompted him, upon his return from England, to master the Greek language, which would enable him to study theology on a more profound level and to prepare a new edition of Jerome's Bible translation. On one occasion he wrote to Colet: \n\"I cannot tell you, dear Colet, how I hurry on, with all sails set, to holy literature. How I dislike everything that keeps me back, or retards me\".\nDespite a chronic shortage of money, he succeeded in learning Greek by an intensive, day-and-night study of three years, continuously begging his friends to send him books and money for teachers in his letters. Discovery in 1506 of Lorenzo Valla's \"New Testament Notes\" encouraged Erasmus to continue the study of the New Testament.\n\nErasmus preferred to live the life of an independent scholar and made a conscious effort to avoid any actions or formal ties that might inhibit his freedom of intellect and literary expression. Throughout his life, he was offered positions of honor and profit in academia but declined them all, preferring the uncertain but sufficient rewards of independent literary activity. From 1506 to 1509, he was in Italy: in 1506 he graduated as Doctor of Divinity at the Turin University, and he spent part of the time as a proofreader at the publishing house of Aldus Manutius in Venice. According to his letters, he was associated with the Venetian natural philosopher, Giulio Camillo, but, apart from this, he had a less active association with Italian scholars than might have been expected.\n\nHis residence at Leuven, where he lectured at the University, exposed Erasmus to much criticism from those ascetics, academics and clerics hostile to the principles of literary and religious reform and the loose norms of the Renaissance adherents to which he was devoting his life. In 1517, he supported the foundation at the University, by his friend Hieronymus van Busleyden, of the Collegium Trilingue for the study of Hebrew, Latin, and Greek—after the model of the College of the Three Languages at the University of Alcalá. However, feeling that the lack of sympathy which prevailed at Leuven at that time was actually a form of mental persecution, he sought refuge in Basel, where under the shelter of Swiss hospitality he could express himself freely. Admirers from all quarters of Europe visited him there and he was surrounded by devoted friends, notably developing a lasting association with the great publisher Johann Froben.\n\nOnly when he had mastered Latin did he begin to express himself on major contemporary themes in literature and religion. He felt called upon to use his learning in a purification of the doctrine by returning to the historic documents and original languages of sacred Scripture. He tried to free the methods of scholarship from the rigidity and formalism of medieval traditions, but he was not satisfied with this. His revolt against certain forms of Christian monasticism and scholasticism was not based on doubts about the truth of doctrine, nor from hostility to the organization of the Church itself, nor from rejection of celibacy or monastical lifestyles. He saw himself as a preacher of righteousness by an appeal to reason, applied frankly and without fear of the magisterium. He always intended to remain faithful to Catholic doctrine, and therefore was convinced he could criticize frankly virtually everyone and everything. Aloof from entangling obligations, Erasmus was the centre of the literary movement of his time, corresponding with more than five hundred men in the worlds of politics and of thought.\n\nIn 1502, Spain, Cardinal Francisco Jiménez de Cisneros had put together a team of Spanish translators to create a Compilation of a Bible in four languages, Greek, Hebrew, Aramaic and Latin. Translators for Greek were commissioned from Greece itself and worked closely with prestigious Latinists and thalamic scholars.\nCardinal Cisneros's team completed and printed the full new testament, including the Greek translation, in 1514. To do so they developed specific types to print Greek. \nCisneros informed Erasmus of the works going on in Spain and may have sent a printed version of the New Testament to him. However, the Spanish team wanted the entire Bible to be released as one single work and withdrew from publication.\n\nThe information and the delay allowed Erasmus to request a \"Publication Privilege\" of four years for the Greek New Testament to ensure that his work would be published first. He obtained it in 1516 from both Pope Leo X, to whom he'd dedicate his work, and Emperor Maximilian I. Erasmus's ' Greek New Testament to be published first, in 1516, forcing the Spanish team of Cisneros to wait until 1520 to publish their Complutensian Polyglot.\n\nIt is hard to say if Erasmus's actions had an effect on delaying the publication of Complutensian Polyglot, causing the Spanish team to take more time, or if it made no difference in their perfectionism. The Spanish copy was approved for publication by the Pope in 1520, however, it wasn't released until 1522, due to the team's insistence on reviewing and editing. Only fifteen errors have been found in the entire six volumes and four languages of Cisneros's bible, an extraordinarily low number for the time. The fear of them publishing first, though, affected Erasmus's work, rushing him to printing and causing him to forego editing. The result was a large number of translation mistakes, transcription errors, and typos, that required further editions to be printed. (see \"publication\").\n\nErasmus had been working for years on two projects: a collation of Greek texts and a fresh Latin New Testament. In 1512, he began his work on this Latin New Testament. He collected all the Vulgate manuscripts he could find to create a critical edition. Then he polished the language. He declared, \"It is only fair that Paul should address the Romans in somewhat better Latin.\" In the earlier phases of the project, he never mentioned a Greek text:\n\nWhile his intentions for publishing a fresh Latin translation are clear, it is less clear why he included the Greek text. Though some speculate that he intended to produce a critical Greek text or that he wanted to beat the Complutensian Polyglot into print, there is no evidence to support this. He wrote, \"There remains the New Testament translated by me, with the Greek facing, and notes on it by me.\"\nHe further demonstrated the reason for the inclusion of the Greek text when defending his work:\nSo he included the Greek text to permit qualified readers to verify the quality of his Latin version. But by first calling the final product \"Novum Instrumentum omne\" (\"All of the New Teaching\") and later \"Novum Testamentum omne\" (\"All of the New Testament\") he also indicated clearly that he considered a text in which the Greek and the Latin versions were consistently comparable to be the essential core of the church's New Testament tradition.\n\nIn a way it is legitimate to say that Erasmus \"synchronized\" or \"unified\" the Greek and the Latin traditions of the New Testament by producing an updated version of either simultaneously. Both being part of canonical tradition, he clearly found it necessary to ensure that both were actually presenting the same content. In modern terminology, he made the two traditions \"compatible\". This is clearly evidenced by the fact that his Greek text is not just the basis for his Latin translation, but also the other way round: there are numerous instances where he edits the Greek text to reflect his Latin version. For instance, since the last six verses of \"Revelation\" were missing from his Greek manuscript, Erasmus translated the Vulgate's text back into Greek. Erasmus also translated the Latin text into Greek wherever he found that the Greek text and the accompanying commentaries were mixed up, or where he simply preferred the Vulgate’s reading to the Greek text.\n\nErasmus said it was \"rushed into print rather than edited\", resulting in a number of transcription errors. After comparing what writings he could find, Erasmus wrote corrections between the lines of the manuscripts he was using (among which was Minuscule 2) and sent them as proofs to Froben. His hurried effort was published by his friend Johann Froben of Basel in 1516 and thence became the first published Greek New Testament, the \"Novum Instrumentum omne, diligenter ab Erasmo Rot. Recognitum et Emendatum\". Erasmus used several Greek manuscript sources because he did not have access to a single complete manuscript. Most of the manuscripts were, however, late Greek manuscripts of the Byzantine textual family and Erasmus used the oldest manuscript the least because \"he was afraid of its supposedly erratic text.\" He also ignored much older and better manuscripts that were at his disposal.\n\nIn the second (1519) edition, the more familiar term \"Testamentum\" was used instead of \"Instrumentum\". This edition was used by Martin Luther in his German translation of the Bible, written for people who could not understand Latin. Together, the first and second editions sold 3,300 copies. By comparison, only 600 copies of the Complutensian Polyglot were ever printed. The first and second edition texts did not include the passage (1 John 5:7–8) that has become known as the Comma Johanneum. Erasmus had been unable to find those verses in any Greek manuscript, but one was supplied to him during production of the third edition. That manuscript is now thought to be a 1520 creation from the Latin Vulgate, which likely got the verses from a fifth-century marginal gloss in a Latin copy of I John. The Roman Catholic Church decreed that the \"Comma Johanneum\" was open to dispute (2 June 1927), and it is rarely included in modern scholarly translations.\n\nThe third edition of 1522 was probably used by Tyndale for the first English New Testament (Worms, 1526) and was the basis for the 1550 Robert Stephanus edition used by the translators of the Geneva Bible and King James Version of the English Bible. Erasmus published a fourth edition in 1527 containing parallel columns of Greek, Latin Vulgate and Erasmus's Latin texts. In this edition Erasmus also supplied the Greek text of the last six verses of Revelation (which he had translated from Latin back into Greek in his first edition) from Cardinal Ximenez's \"Biblia Complutensis\". In 1535 Erasmus published the fifth (and final) edition which dropped the Latin Vulgate column but was otherwise similar to the fourth edition. Later versions of the Greek New Testament by others, but based on Erasmus's Greek New Testament, became known as the \"Textus Receptus\".\n\nErasmus dedicated his work to Pope Leo X as a patron of learning and regarded this work as his chief service to the cause of Christianity. Immediately afterward, he began the publication of his \"Paraphrases of the New Testament\", a popular presentation of the contents of the several books. These, like all of his writings, were published in Latin but were quickly translated into other languages, with his encouragement.\n\nErasmus, in his capacity as humanist editor, advised major printers such as Aldus Manutis on which manuscripts to publish. \n\nMartin Luther's movement began in the year following the publication of the New Testament and tested Erasmus' character. The issues between growing religious movements, which would later become known as Protestantism, and the Catholic Church had become so clear that few could escape the summons to join the debate. Erasmus, at the height of his literary fame, was inevitably called upon to take sides, but partisanship was foreign to his nature and his habits. In all his criticism of clerical follies and abuses, he had always protested that he was not attacking the Church itself or its doctrines, and had no enmity toward churchmen. The world had laughed at his satire, but few had interfered with his activities. He believed that his work so far had commended itself to the best minds and also to the dominant powers in the religious world.\n\nErasmus did not build a large body of supporters with his letters. He chose to write in Greek and Latin, the languages of scholars. His critiques reached an elite but small audience.\n\n\"Free will does not exist\", according to Luther in his letter \"De Servo Arbitrio\" to Erasmus translated into German by Justus Jonas (1526) in that sin makes human beings completely incapable of bringing themselves to God. Noting Luther's criticism of the Catholic Church, Erasmus described him as \"a mighty trumpet of gospel truth\" while agreeing, \"It is clear that many of the reforms for which Luther calls are urgently needed.\" He had great respect for Luther, and Luther spoke with admiration of Erasmus's superior learning. Luther hoped for his cooperation in a work which seemed only the natural outcome of his own. In their early correspondence, Luther expressed boundless admiration for all Erasmus had done in the cause of a sound and reasonable Christianity and urged him to join the Lutheran party. Erasmus declined to commit himself, arguing that to do so would endanger his position as a leader in the movement for pure scholarship which he regarded as his purpose in life. Only as an independent scholar could he hope to influence the reform of religion. When Erasmus hesitated to support him, the straightforward Luther became angered that Erasmus was avoiding the responsibility due either to cowardice or a lack of purpose. However, any hesitancy on the part of Erasmus stemmed, not from lack of courage or conviction, but rather from a concern over the mounting disorder and violence of the reform movement. To Philip Melanchthon in 1524 he wrote:\n\nI know nothing of your church; at the very least it contains people who will, I fear, overturn the whole system and drive the princes into using force to restrain good men and bad alike. The gospel, the word of God, faith, Christ, and Holy Spirit – these words are always on their lips; look at their lives and they speak quite another language.\n\nAgain, in 1529, he writes “An epistle against those who falsely boast they are Evangelicals” to Vulturius Neocomus (Gerardus Geldenhouwer). Here Erasmus complains of the doctrines and morals of the Reformers:\n\nYou declaim bitterly against the luxury of priests, the ambition of bishops, the tyranny of the Roman Pontiff, and the babbling of the sophists; against our prayers, fasts, and Masses; and you are not content to retrench the abuses that may be in these things, but must needs abolish them entirely...<br>Look around on this ‘Evangelical’ generation, and observe whether amongst them less indulgence is given to luxury, lust, or avarice, than amongst those whom you so detest. Show me any one person who by that Gospel has been reclaimed from drunkenness to sobriety, from fury and passion to meekness, from avarice to liberality, from reviling to well-speaking, from wantonness to modesty. I will show you a great many who have become worse through following it...The solemn prayers of the Church are abolished, but now there are very many who never pray at all...<br>I have never entered their conventicles, but I have sometimes seen them returning from their sermons, the countenances of all of them displaying rage, and wonderful ferocity, as though they were animated by the evil spirit...<br>Who ever beheld in their meetings any one of them shedding tears, smiting his breast, or grieving for his sins ?... Confession to the priest is abolished, but very few now confess to God... They have fled from Judaism that they may become Epicureans.\n\nApart from these perceived moral failings of the Reformers, Erasmus also dreaded any change in doctrine, citing the long history of the Church as a bulwark against innovation. In book I of his \"Hyperaspistes\" he puts the matter bluntly to Luther:\nWe are dealing with this: Would a stable mind depart from the opinion handed down by so many men famous for holiness and miracles, depart from the decisions of the Church, and commit our souls to the faith of someone like you who has sprung up just now with a few followers, although the leading men of your flock do not agree either with you or among themselves – indeed though you do not even agree with yourself, since in this same \"Assertion\" you say one thing in the beginning and something else later on, recanting what you said before.\n\nContinuing his chastisement of Luther—and undoubtedly put off by the notion of there being \"no pure interpretation of Scripture anywhere but in Wittenberg\" – Erasmus touches upon another important point of the controversy:\n\nYou stipulate that we should not ask for or accept anything but Holy Scripture, but you do it in such a way as to require that we permit you to be its sole interpreter, renouncing all others. Thus the victory will be yours if we allow you to be not the steward but the lord of Holy Scripture.\nThough he sought to remain firmly neutral in doctrinal disputes, each side accused him of siding with the other, perhaps because of his neutrality. It was not for lack of fidelity with either side but a desire for fidelity with them both:\n\"I detest dissension because it goes both against the teachings of Christ and against a secret inclination of nature. I doubt that either side in the dispute can be suppressed without grave loss.\"\nIn his catechism (entitled \"Explanation of the Apostles' Creed\") (1533), Erasmus took a stand against Luther's teaching by asserting the unwritten Sacred Tradition as just as valid a source of revelation as the Bible, by enumerating the Deuterocanonical books in the canon of the Bible and by acknowledging seven sacraments. He called \"blasphemers\" anyone who questioned the perpetual virginity of Mary. However, he supported lay access to the Bible.\n\nIn a letter to Nikolaus von Amsdorf, Luther objected to Erasmus’ Catechism and called Erasmus a \"viper,\" \"liar,\"\nand \"the very mouth and organ of Satan.\"\n\nErasmus was accused by the monks against the Reformation, that he had: \"prepared the way and was responsible for Martin Luther. Erasmus, they said, had laid the egg, and Luther had hatched it. Erasmus wittily dismissed the charge, claiming that Luther had hatched a different bird entirely.\".\n\nTwice in the course of the great discussion, he allowed himself to enter the field of doctrinal controversy, a field foreign to both his nature and his previous practice. One of the topics he dealt with was free will, a crucial question. In his \"De libero arbitrio diatribe sive collatio\" (1524), he lampoons the Lutheran view on free will. He lays down both sides of the argument impartially. The \"Diatribe\" did not encourage any definite action; this was its merit to the Erasmians and its fault in the eyes of the Lutherans. In response, Luther wrote his \"De servo arbitrio\" (On the Bondage of the Will) (1525), which attacks the \"Diatribe\" and Erasmus himself, going so far as to claim that Erasmus was not a Christian. Erasmus responded with a lengthy, two-part \"Hyperaspistes\" (1526–27). In this controversy Erasmus lets it be seen that he would like to claim more for free will than St. Paul and St. Augustine seem to allow according to Luther's interpretation. For Erasmus the essential point is that humans have the freedom of choice. The conclusions Erasmus reached drew upon a large array of notable authorities, including, from the Patristic period, Origen, John Chrysostom, Ambrose, Jerome, and Augustine, in addition to many leading Scholastic authors, such as Thomas Aquinas and Duns Scotus. The content of Erasmus' works also engaged with later thought on the state of the question, including the perspectives of the \"via moderna\" school and of Lorenzo Valla, whose ideas he rejected.\n\nAs the popular response to Luther gathered momentum, the social disorders, which Erasmus dreaded and Luther disassociated himself from, began to appear, including the German Peasants' War, the Anabaptist disturbances in Germany and in the Low Countries, iconoclasm and the radicalization of peasants across Europe. If these were the outcomes of reform, he was thankful that he had kept out of it. Yet he was ever more bitterly accused of having started the whole \"tragedy\" (as the Catholics dubbed Protestantism).\n\nWhen the city of Basel definitely adopted the Reformation in 1529, Erasmus gave up his residence there and settled in the imperial town of Freiburg im Breisgau.\n\nCertain works of Erasmus laid a foundation for religious toleration and Ecumenism. For example, in \"De libero arbitrio\", opposing certain views of Martin Luther, Erasmus noted that religious disputants should be temperate in their language, \"because in this way the truth, which is often lost amidst too much wrangling may be more surely perceived.\" Gary Remer writes, \"Like Cicero, Erasmus concludes that truth is furthered by a more harmonious relationship between interlocutors.\" Although Erasmus did not oppose the punishment of heretics, in individual cases he generally argued for moderation and against the death penalty. He wrote, \"It is better to cure a sick man than to kill him.\"\n\nA test of the Reformation was the doctrine of the sacraments, and the crux of this question was the observance of the Eucharist. In 1530, Erasmus published a new edition of the orthodox treatise of Algerus against the heretic Berengar of Tours in the eleventh century. He added a dedication, affirming his belief in the reality of the Body of Christ after consecration in the Eucharist, commonly referred to as transubstantiation. The sacramentarians, headed by Œcolampadius of Basel, were, as Erasmus says, quoting him as holding views similar to their own in order to try to claim him for their schismatic and \"erroneous\" movement.\n\nWhen his strength began to fail, he decided to accept an invitation by Queen Mary of Hungary, Regent of the Netherlands, to move from Freiburg to Brabant. However, during preparations for the move in 1536, he suddenly died from an attack of dysentery during a visit to Basel. He had remained loyal to the papal authorities in Rome, but he did not have the opportunity to receive the last rites of the Catholic Church; and whether he asked for a priest or not is nowhere mentioned in the reports of his death. According to Jan van Herwaarden, this is consistent with his view that outward signs were not important; what mattered is the believer's direct relationship with God, which he noted \"as the [Catholic] church believes\". However, Herwaarden observes that \"he did not dismiss the rites and sacraments out of hand but asserted a dying person could achieve a state of salvation without the priestly rites, provided their faith and spirit were attuned to God.\" He was buried with great ceremony in Basel Minster (the former cathedral) there.\n\nHis last words, as recorded by his friend Beatus Rhenanus, were apparently \"Dear God\" (). A bronze statue of him was erected in the city of his birth in 1622, replacing an earlier work in stone.\n\nErasmus wrote both on ecclesiastic subjects and those of general human interest. By the 1530s, the writings of Erasmus accounted for 10 to 20 percent of all book sales in Europe. He is credited with coining the adage, \"In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king.\" With the collaboration of Publio Fausto Andrelini, he formed a Paremiography (collection) of Latin proverbs and adages, commonly titled \"Adagia\". Erasmus is also generally credited with originating the phrase \"Pandora's box\", arising through an error in his translation of Hesiod's \"Pandora\" in which he confused \"pithos\" (storage jar) with \"pyxis\" (box).\n\nHis more serious writings begin early with the \"Enchiridion militis Christiani,\" the \"Handbook of the Christian Soldier\" (1503) (translated into English a few years later by the young William Tyndale). (A more literal translation of \"enchiridion\" - 'dagger' - has been likened to \"the spiritual equivalent of the modern Swiss Army knife.\") In this short work, Erasmus outlines the views of the normal Christian life, which he was to spend the rest of his days elaborating. The chief evil of the day, he says, is formalism - going through the motions of tradition without understanding their basis in the teachings of Christ. Forms can teach the soul how to worship God, or they may hide or quench the spirit. In his examination of the dangers of formalism, Erasmus discusses monasticism, saint worship, war, the spirit of class and the foibles of \"society.\"\n\nThe \"Enchiridion\" is more like a sermon than a satire. With it Erasmus challenged common assumptions, painting the clergy as educators who should share the treasury of their knowledge with the laity. He emphasized personal spiritual disciplines, and called for a reformation which he characterized as a collective return to the Fathers and Scripture. Most importantly, he extolled the reading of scripture as vital because of its power to transform and motivate toward love. Much like the Brethren of the Common Life, he wrote that the New Testament is the law of Christ people are called to obey and that Christ is the example they are called to imitate.\n\nAccording to Ernest Barker, \"Besides his work on the New Testament, Erasmus laboured also, and even more arduously, on the early Fathers. […] Among the Latin Fathers he edited the works of St Jerome, St Hilary, and St Augustine; among the Greeks he worked on Irenaeus, Origen and Chrysostom.\"\n\nErasmus also wrote of the legendary Frisian freedom fighter and rebel Pier Gerlofs Donia (Greate Pier), though more often in criticism than in praise of his exploits. Erasmus saw him as a dim, brutal man who preferred physical strength to wisdom.\n\nOne of Erasmus's best-known works, inspired by \"De triumpho stultitiae\" (written by Italian humanist Faustino Perisauli), is \"The Praise of Folly\", published under the double title \"Moriae encomium\" (Greek, Latinised) and \"Laus stultitiae\" (Latin). A satirical attack on superstitions and other traditions of European society in general and the western Church in particular, it was written in 1509, published in 1511, and dedicated to Sir Thomas More, whose name the title puns.\n\nThe \"Institutio principis Christiani\" (\"Education of a Christian Prince\") (Basel, 1516) was written as advice to the young king Charles of Spain (later Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor). Erasmus applies the general principles of honor and sincerity to the special functions of the Prince, whom he represents throughout as the servant of the people. \"Education\" was published in 1516, three years after Niccolò Machiavelli’s \"The Prince\"; a comparison between the two is worth noting. Machiavelli stated that, to maintain control by political force, it is safer for a prince to be feared than loved. Erasmus preferred for the prince to be loved, and strongly suggested a well-rounded education in order to govern justly and benevolently and avoid becoming a source of oppression.\n\nAs a result of his reformatory activities, Erasmus found himself at odds with both the great parties. His last years were embittered by controversies with men toward whom he was sympathetic. Notable among these was Ulrich von Hutten, a brilliant but erratic genius, who had thrown himself into the Lutheran cause and declared that Erasmus, if he had a spark of honesty, would do the same. In his reply in 1523, \"Spongia adversus aspergines Hutteni\", Erasmus displays his skill in semantics. He accuses Hutten of having misinterpreted his utterances about reform and reiterates his determination never to break with the Church.\n\nThe \"Ciceronianus\" came out in 1528, attacking the style of Latin that was based exclusively and fanatically on Cicero's writings. Etienne Dolet wrote a riposte titled \"Erasmianus\" in 1535.\n\nErasmus's last major work, published the year of his death, is the \"Ecclesiastes\" or \"Gospel Preacher\" (Basel, 1536), a massive manual for preachers of around a thousand pages. Though somewhat unwieldy because Erasmus was unable to edit it properly in his old age, it is in some ways the culmination of all of Erasmus' literary and theological learning, offering prospective preachers advice on nearly every conceivable aspect of their vocation with extraordinarily abundant reference to classical and biblical sources.\n\nErasmus’s \"Sileni Alcibiadis\" is one of his most direct assessments of the need for Church reform. Johann Froben published it first within a revised edition of the \"Adagia\" in 1515, then as a stand-alone work in 1517. This essay has been likened to John Colet’s \"Convocation Sermon\", though the styles differ.\n\n\"Sileni\" is the plural (Latin) form of \"Silenus\", a creature often related to the Roman wine god Bacchus and represented in pictorial art as inebriated, merry revellers, variously mounted on donkeys, singing, dancing, playing flutes etc. Alcibiades was a Greek politician in the 5th century BCE and a general in the Peloponnesian War; he figures here more as a character written into some of Plato's dialogues—a young, debauched playboy whom Socrates tries to convince to seek truth instead of pleasure, wisdom instead of pomp and splendor.\n\nThe term \"Sileni\"—especially when juxtaposed with the character of Alcibiades—can therefore be understood as an evocation of the notion that something on the inside is more expressive of a person's character than what one sees on the outside. For instance, something or someone ugly on the outside can be beautiful on the inside, which is one of the main points of Plato's dialogues featuring \"Alcibiades\" and the \"Symposion\", in which Alcibiades also appears.\n\nIn support of this, Erasmus states, \"Anyone who looks closely at the inward nature and essence will find that nobody is further from true wisdom than those people with their grand titles, learned bonnets, splendid sashes and bejeweled rings, who profess to be wisdom’s peak\". Erasmus lists several Sileni and then questions whether Christ is the most noticeable Silenus of them all. The Apostles were Sileni since they were ridiculed by others. He believes that the things which are the least ostentatious can be the most significant, and that the Church constitutes all Christian people —that despite contemporary references to clergy as the whole of the Church, they are merely its servants. He criticizes those that spend the Church’s riches at the people’s expense. The true point of the Church is to help people lead Christian lives. Priests are supposed to be pure, yet when they stray away, no one condemns them. He criticizes the riches of the popes, believing that it would be better for the Gospel to be most important.\n\nThe popularity of his books is reflected in the number of editions and translations that have appeared since the sixteenth century. Ten columns of the catalogue of the British Library are taken up with the enumeration of the works and their subsequent reprints. The greatest names of the classical and patristic world are among those translated, edited, or annotated by Erasmus, including Saint Ambrose, Aristotle, Saint Augustine, Saint Basil, Saint John Chrysostom, Cicero and Saint Jerome.\n\nIn his native Rotterdam, the University and Gymnasium Erasmianum have been named in his honor. In 2003, a poll showing that most Rotterdammers believed Erasmus to be the designer of the local \"Erasmus Bridge\" instigated the founding of the Erasmus House (Rotterdam), and the Erasmus House (Jakarta) dedicated to celebrating Erasmus's legacy. Three moments in Erasmus's life are celebrated annually. On 1 April, the city celebrates the publication of his best-known book \"The Praise of Folly\". On 11 July, the \"Night of Erasmus\" celebrates the lasting influence of his work. His birthday is celebrated on 28 October.\n\nErasmus's reputation and the interpretations of his work have varied over time. Moderate Catholics recognized him as a leading figure in attempts to reform the Church, while Protestants recognized his initial support for Luther's ideas and the groundwork he laid for the future Reformation, especially in biblical scholarship. By the 1560s, however, there was a marked change in reception.\nAccording to Franz Anton Knittel, Erasmus in his \"Novum Instrumentum omne\" did not incorporate the \"Comma\" from the Codex Montfortianus, because of grammar differences, but used Complutensian Polyglotta. According to him the \"Comma\" was known to Tertullian.\n\nProtestant views of Erasmus fluctuated depending on region and period, with continual support in his native Netherlands and in cities of the Upper Rhine area. However, following his death and in the late sixteenth century, many Reformation supporters saw Erasmus's critiques of Luther and lifelong support for the universal Catholic Church as damning, and second-generation Protestants were less vocal in their debts to the great humanist. Nevertheless, his reception is demonstrable among Swiss Protestants in the sixteenth-century: he had an indelible influence on the biblical commentaries of, for example, Konrad Pellikan, Heinrich Bullinger, and John Calvin, all of whom used both his annotations on the New Testament and his paraphrases of same in their own New Testament commentaries.\n\nHowever, Erasmus designated his own legacy and his life works were turned over at his death to his friend the Protestant humanist turned remonstrator Sebastian Castellio for the repair of the breach and divide of Christianity in its Catholic, Anabaptist, and Protestant branches.\n\nBy the coming of the Age of Enlightenment, however, Erasmus increasingly again became a more widely respected cultural symbol and was hailed as an important figure by increasingly broad groups. In a letter to a friend, Erasmus once had written: \"That you are patriotic will be praised by many and easily forgiven by everyone; but in my opinion it is wiser to treat men and things as though we held this world the common fatherland of all.\" Thus, the universalist ideals of Erasmus are sometimes claimed to be important for fixing global governance.\n\nSeveral schools, faculties and universities in the Netherlands and Belgium are named after him, as is Erasmus Hall in Brooklyn, New York, USA. The European Union's Erasmus Programme scholarships enable students to spend up to a year of their university courses in a university in another European country.\n\nEramus is credited with saying \"When I get a little money I buy books; and if any is left, I buy food and clothes.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1325495", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1325495", "title": "Facundo Cabral", "text": "Facundo Cabral\n\nFacundo Cabral (May 22, 1937 – July 9, 2011) was an Argentine singer, songwriter and philosopher.\n\nHe was best known as the composer of \"No soy de aquí ni soy de allá\" (\"I'm not from here nor there\"), which he improvised during one of his concerts. His songs have been covered by Spanish language interpreters such as Alberto Cortez, who was also a friend of his, Juan Luis Guerra and Joan Manuel Serrat.\n\nAfter touring the world, Cabral enjoyed popularity in his home country during the early 1980s, when Argentine radio demanded local content after the Malvinas War. He became a very popular singer throughout Latin America. Facundo Cabral was named a UNESCO Messenger of Peace in 1996.\n\nFacundo Cabral was born in the Argentine city of La Plata, and could not talk until the age of nine. He was illiterate until the age of 14. His wife and daughter died when he was 40. He met his father at the age of 46. Facundo did not have an easy childhood; he left his home early and was dedicated to all kinds of tasks. From the most humble of beginnings, he came to inspire millions around the world through his songs, poems and 66 books. He walked 400 km at the age of nine to look for work to support his mother and seven siblings after his father abandoned them. When he left, his mother told him: \"This is the second, and last gift I can give you. The first was to give you life, and the second one, the liberty to live it.\" He traveled to Mar del Plata and got a job in a hotel where the owner saw him with his guitar and gave him the opportunity to sing. \nHe wrote music that inspired millions. He met Mother Teresa. He performed in over 165 countries in eight different languages. His earlier artistic name was \"El Indio Gasparino\". His wife and one-year-old daughter were killed in 1978 in the PSA Flight 182 crash near San Diego, California. He was nearly blind and crippled, and was a bone cancer survivor as well. When he was diagnosed in his twenties, his doctor told him he only had a couple of months to live but he survived much longer and was an inspiration to all. He loved travelling, it was a part of his life. He did not care about money, he just was happy to be alive. Facundo Cabral was killed in Guatemala after a concert. He gave his testimony of life to the world in songs, poems or just chatting, and was a great loss to the world. He always said, \"Siempre le pregunto a Dios, ¿por qué a mí tanto me diste? Me diste miseria, hambre, felicidad, lucha, luces... vi todo. Sé que hay cáncer, sífilis y primavera, y buñuelos de manzana\" (I always ask God, why did you give me so much? You gave me misery, hunger, happiness, struggle, lights... I saw everything. I know there is cancer, syphilis and spring, and apple fritters).\n\nFacundo expressed that his spiritual views were influenced by a variety of figures, including Jesus, Laozi, Zhuang Zhou, Rajneesh, Jiddu Krishnamurti, Gautama Buddha, Schopenhauer, John the Baptist, Francis of Assisi, Gandhi and Mother Teresa. He preached quantum mysticism and the subjugation of the ego.\n\nHe had admiration for the writings of Jorge Luis Borges (with whom he engaged in philosophical discussions) and of Walt Whitman.\n\nIt is generally thought that Cabral never adhered to a specific political movement, although for years he advocated pacifism as a way of resolving conflicts. He used to describe himself as \"violently pacifist\", and as a \"first-class homeless person\". During his later years he partly identified himself with the ideas of philosophical anarchism.\n\nCabral was shot and killed during a tour in Guatemala City while en route to La Aurora International Airport on July 9, 2011.\n\nHe had left a hotel in the west of Guatemala City, after giving a concert the previous evening in Quetzaltenango, and was headed to the airport when gunmen attacked his vehicle, a white Range Rover Sport, hitting him with at least eight bullets. He died in the car. The incident occurred at around 05.20 (local time) and took place on Liberation Boulevard, a busy road that connects with the airport, but at the time of the attack was practically empty. Cabral initially planned to take a hotel shuttle to the airport, but accepted a ride from Nicaraguan concert promoter/night club owner Henry Fariñas.\n\nCabral was with his agent David Llanos and Henry Fariñas, who were wounded. He was accompanied by a second vehicle carrying bodyguards, but they couldn't protect the singer's vehicle from the bullets. Cabral was riding in an SUV that tried to flee the attackers by driving into a fire station. At least 20 bullet holes were seen in the Range Rover car he was in. The gunmen were in three late-model vehicles, one in front of Cabral's car and two to the right and left. One of the attackers' vehicles was later found abandoned on the road to El Salvador. It was a brown Hyundai Santa Fe with bullet holes and containing bullet-proof vests and an AK-47 magazine. Early investigations indicated that the trajectory of the bullets were from right to left, toward the driver's seat, indicating that the bullets were meant for the driver, Cabral's Nicaraguan promoter Henry Fariñas, possibly because of troubles with organized crime. Three suspects were arrested.\n\nCabral, at the time of his murder, had been married for seven months to Silvia Pousa, a Venezuelan psychologist who had been his partner for the last ten years. His body was flown to Argentina from Guatemala on July 12, 2011 on a Mexican Air Force jet. His widow, Silvia Pousa, and nephew joined foreign minister Hector Timerman and a small group of Guatemalan and Mexican diplomats on the tarmac in Buenos Aires to receive his remains. One official brought from the plane a guitar and a small bag. Cabral had said that was all he needed for his nearly constant singing tours.\n\nHis coffin was displayed for the public in the Ateneo theater, the same Buenos Aires theater where he last performed in his native Argentina. The widow and family of Cabral gave a statement to reporters at the Ateneo theater, which expressed \"thanks to the huge amount of media around the world by the respectful coverage\" of his death.\nHis body was taken to a cemetery north of Buenos Aires for cremation at an intimate private ceremony with just family and close friends in attendance.\n\nOn March 13, 2012, Colombian authorities announced the arrest of Alejandro Jiménez (a.k.a. \"El Palidejo\"), who is believed to have ordered Cabral's murder.\n\nPresident Colom decreed three days of national mourning. Hundreds of Guatemalans (most of them wearing black) sang songs written by the artist in the capital's Plaza de la Constitucion. Some of the signs carried by Guatemalans grieving the death of the beloved singer said \"Argentina, we apologize,\" \"We ask forgiveness of the world for the assassination of Facundo;\" \"We are here not only for the death of \"Maestro\" Cabral, but also for every boy, girl, old man and woman, who becomes, day after day, victim of violence. Not only for Facundo Cabral, but also for the future of our children\".\n\nPresidents, performers and other personalities from the Americas united in condemning the singer’s murder and demanding justice from the Guatemalan authorities. Guatemala's 1992 Nobel Peace Prize winner, Rigoberta Menchú, went to the scene of the killing and wept. \"For me, Facundo Cabral is a master,\" she said. \"He loved Guatemala greatly.\" She believes the ambush may have been related to Cabral’s beliefs.\n\nSocial networks were filled with expressions of outrage. \"I feel an immeasurable shame, a profound anger for my country\", said Ronalth Ochaeta, former director of a Catholic church human rights office Guatemala, on his Facebook account. Rodolfo Ajquejay, President of the Association of Artists in Guatemala, said \"this is mourning at a global level because [he] left only positive messages in his songs\".\n\nThis incident \"was regrettable\" and was \"one more manifestation of the violence in Guatemala,\" said Francisco Dall'Anese, the head of the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG), an organization created in conjunction with the United Nations. Guatemala's human rights ombudsman, Sergio Morales, expressed his condolences to Argentina.\"I ask authorities of this country that this crime not be left unsolved, to investigate,\" he said.\n\nEcuadorian President Rafael Correa said \"Facundo Cabral will be immortalized with his songs.\"\n\nBolivian authorities expressed their dismay at the death of the Argentine troubadour. Bolivian Minister of Culture Elizabeth Salguero said Cabral's death saddened her because \"you can not understand that there are people who want to do much damage to a man who gave so much as a singer, composer, and poet.\" \"He was a philosopher, a fighter for social justice, and to die that way is very painful.\"\n\nVenezuelan President Hugo Chavez followed suit: \"We are weeping with Argentina.\"\n\nThe Mayor of Lima, Peru and former presidential candidate, Susana Villaran, tweeted: \"So ironic. A man who preached about peace and sang for life, dies in such a violent way\" and shared one of his most famous quotes: \"If you love the money at most you'll get to a bank, but if you love life, God will surely come.\"\n\nThe Colombian president, Juan Manuel Santos, also mourned his death. \"Many of you must be fans of Facundo Cabral, and throughout Latin America and us here in Colombia. I personally regret this vile murder,\" Santos said at the start of a public speech in Bogotá.\n\nThe United Nations said in a statement: \"The United Nations System in Guatemala strongly condemns the assassination of Argentine singer-songwriter Facundo Cabral and adds to the feeling of dismay and frustration of a Guatemalan society that looks beset by intolerable acts of violence. It is painfully ironic that the one who toured Latin America with a message of justice, peace and fraternity lost his life in the hands of a group of assassins. The UN expresses its solidarity with the families and loved ones of the troubadour, as well as the people of Argentina and Latin American that had Facundo as a reference for inspiration.\"\n\nEduardo Suger, the presidential candidate for the \"Commitment, Renewal and Order\" party, during his tour in San Manuel Chaparron and San Luis Jilotepeque, Jalapa, described as \"vile and shameful\" for the country the attack to Cabral. \"I felt so much pain, I felt sad for Guatemala, because we are a people capable and honest, but now we paint as a people of thugs, it's embarrassing,\" he explained.\n\nThe secretary general of the Organization of American States (OAS), Jose Miguel Insulza, condemned the murder as an \"irrational crime.\"\n\nRené Pérez, leader of the Puerto Rican hip-hop group Calle 13, wrote, \"Latin America is in mourning,\" and other leading pop-music figures, among them Ricky Martin, Alejandro Sanz and Ricardo Montaner, also sent Twitter messages lamenting his loss.\n\nGuatemalan artists paid tribute to Facundo Cabral on Sunday, July 10, 2011. The Guatemalan artist guild called on all citizens to go Constitution Square to pay tribute to him. Armando Pineda, Alvaro Aguilar Alux Nahual and Rony Hernandez, Alejandro Arriaza, Gaby Andrade, and Manuel Rony were some of the artists who participated in this concert. In a letter to the Guatemalan newspaper \"Prensa Libre\" the singer Ricardo Arjona wrote: \"As a Guatemalan, I deeply regret the impact this news will generate among international opinion. As a friend and colleague, I will lament the absence of Facundo forever.\"\n\nVicente Serrano, host of a local Spanish-language radio show, brought Cabral to the Chicago area for that last performance. Serrano, who described Cabral as \"irreverent,\" remembers how the singer fell in love with the Chicago skyline and the Art Institute of Chicago. \"Facundo cried when we went to visit the Art Institute because he said he was moved by its beauty,\" Serrano said\n\nArgentine singer and poet Alberto Cortez, who lives in Madrid, was devastated by the assassination of Cabral, who shared a \"great friendship\" with Cabral.\n\"I remember him as a good friend, who suddenly became a mystic. That mysticism transmitted to people, and people accepted it with much pleasure,\"he said.\n\nArgentine television stations interrupted their broadcasts with news of the 74-year-old singer's death. The National Government decreed three days of mourning for the death of Cabral. Recalling that \"devoted his life to singing, with their letters transmitting the spirit of peace inspired by the teachings of Jesus, Gandhi and Mother Teresa of Calcutta.\"\n\n"}

From 356 to 361, he was archbishop of Alexandria.\n\nAccording to Ammianus (xxii. ii), George was a native of Epiphania. Gregory Nazianzen states that George's father was a fuller, and that George became so notorious a parasite that he would \"sell himself for a cake.\" After many wanderings, in the course of which he seems to have amassed a considerable fortune- first as an army contractor and then as a receiver of taxes- George ultimately reached Alexandria.\n\nIt is not known how or when George obtained ecclesiastical orders; however, after Athanasius had been banished in 356, George was promoted by the influence of the then-prevalent Arian faction to the vacant see. His theological attitude was that of a semi-Arian or Homoiousian, and his associates were Eustathius of Sebaste and Basil of Ancyra. At George's instigation, the second Sirmian formula (promulgated by the third council of Sirmium, in 357), which was conciliatory towards strict Arianism, was opposed at the council of Ancyra in 358 (Harnack, Hist. of Dogma, iv. 76).\n\nGeorge's persecutions and oppressions of the orthodox ultimately raised a rebellion that compelled him to flee for his life; but his authority was restored, albeit with difficulty, by a military demonstration. Untaught by experience, George resumed his course of selfish tyranny over Christians and heathen alike. This raised the ire of the populace to such a pitch that, on the accession of Julian, George's downfall was effected, and he was thrown in prison. The local citizenry subsequently dragged George from the jail and killed him, tossing his body into the sea.\n\nThough George had a sordid and brutal character, he had a highly cultivated literary taste, and in the course of his checkered career found the means to collect a splendid personal library, which Julian ordered conveyed to Antioch for his own use. An anonymous work against the Manicheans, discovered by Lagarde in 1859 in writings once owned by Titus of Bostra, has also been attributed to George.\n"}

His parents were Pete and Teresa Sircello, and he had a younger sister, Teresa. Upon high school graduation, he was awarded the prestigious George Baker full four-year scholarship to Reed College, in Portland, Oregon, and graduated in 1958 with a double major in philosophy and history. In 1960, he married Sharon Chapin, a fellow Reed graduate, and shortly after, they left New York for Hamburg, where he had a Fulbright grant to further his studies of Ernst Cassirer, the subject of his doctoral dissertation at Columbia University. \n\nIn Hamburg, the Sircello's first child, Maria Anne Sircello was born, and the family returned to New York with another daughter as well, an adopted daughter, Deborah Ruth Sircello. In New York, the family grew as the Sircellos also became foster parents to Deborah's brothers, Billie, Alexander, and Constantine (Stan). In 1963, another daughter, Pier Andrea, was born in New York City just prior to the family's move to Portland, so that Guy could join the Reed faculty. In Portland, in 1965, another daughter, Anne-Marie Sircello was born, not long after the death of Maria Anne, who had been born with multiple serious disabilities. In 1966, the entire family of eight moved to Irvine, and finally, in 1967, the final child of the Sircello family, Christopher Chapin Sircello, was born. Guy was an attentive and involved father, and enjoyed family camping outings to Yosemite, a three-month family camping trip to Europe, and visits to museums, concerts, and the ballet. He was a major influence, along with Sharon, in three of his children becoming professional dancers, two others becoming professional visual artists, and another an accomplished amateur pianist. \n\nThe Sircellos separated, and later divorced after 15 years of marriage.\n\nSircello was a Professor of Philosophy at the University of California Irvine from 1966 until his death in 1992 at the age of 55. He earned his PhD from Columbia University in 1965. He taught at Reed College before becoming a founding member of UC Irvine’s Philosophy department. While at Irvine he served as Associate Dean of Undergraduate Studies from 1973 to 1977, Dean of Undergraduate Studies from 1978 to 1983, Chair of the Committee on Educational Policy from 1988 to 1989, and as the Philosophy Department's Director of Graduate Studies from 1990 until his death. Sircello was active in the American Society for Aesthetics and served as the President of its Pacific Division from 1978 to 1979. His emphasis was in analytic philosophy of aesthetics, and he was best known for what he called his New Theory of Beauty \n\nSircello's book \"Love and Beauty\" (1989) provides a sketch of his theory, which encompasses such topics as arousal, expansion, sublimity, and indulgence. He considers the implications of his theory for aesthetics and ethics. He also develops theories of pleasure, quality, beauty and love.\n\nAccording to Sircello, philosophers have usually failed to understand and theorize properly about certain fundamental human modalities. Among these is the human relation to and feeling for beauty. In particular, Sircello found it dismaying that among philosophers the ancient conception of love of beauty had been displaced by other human concerns. His last book, \"Love and Beauty\", was intended to provide a theory to begin to fill the void left by this loss of interest.\n\nSircello distinguishes pleasure from enjoyment. He uses \"propositional pleasure\" as an example of a particular type of pleasure distinct from enjoyment. Propositional pleasure is characterized as a pleasure taken in the occurrence of a fact, event, state or the like. Such pleasure is relatively passive. We may take pleasure in the outcome of a ball game or in the fact that traffic is light on the way to work, but the pleasure itself resulting from this satisfaction is something that happens to the subject rather than something they effect. Enjoyment is constituted by the active role played by the subject. Enjoyment can be obtained from experiences that are not entirely pleasant in all their parts via effort or resolve on the part of the subject. For instance, a strenuous hike can be enjoyable even though parts of it may be difficult and painful. The subject’s resolve and ability to overcome difficulties can make the hike enjoyable despite these troubles. Enjoyment involves a complex relationship to desire in that enjoyment tends to fuel further desires for its continuation. As such enjoyment of experience is fundamental in Sircello’s theory of love.\n\nCentral to Sircello’s philosophy is his theory of qualities. He defines the precise sense in which he uses this term through the concept of Properties of Qualitative Difference (or PQDs). Such properties are to be distinguished from quantitative properties. According to his theory, it is the perception of qualities that lies at the center of the experience of beauty. According to Sircello qualities come in four main varieties. These constitute four ways in which we experience our world.\n\nCommon wisdom tells us that beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Sircello’s philosophy runs counter to this maxim. He maintained that beauty is objective in a very particular way. His starting point is the recognition that when a judgment of beauty is made there is something about the object that is thought to be beautiful. For example, if an alpine sunset seen as beautiful, this is due to the quality of light expressed in the sunset, or perhaps because of the intense depth of the vista, or because of some other attribute of the scene that stands out as exceptional in some way. Beauty resides for Sircello in the possession by objects, scenes, actions, and so on of qualities to a very high degree. Qualities of lack, deficiency or defect are excluded from this because these qualities are not enjoyed qualities.\n\nSircello begins his account of love by setting it in relation to enjoyment. To distance some of the standard associations with the term “love,” Sircello uses the capitalized form, Love, in a technical sense. Fundamental to his theory is the notion of reproducing an experience of a quality. Reproductions by S a subject may be regarded as recollections, repetitions or recreations of images, memories, thoughts, actions, feelings, or states that are parts of the experience. Sircello presents his theory through the four principles paraphrased below:\n\n\nBooks by Guy Sircello\n\nSelected articles not in UCI's bibliography\n\n"}
{"id": "48776378", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48776378", "title": "High Orbit Ion Cannon", "text": "High Orbit Ion Cannon\n\nHigh Orbit Ion Cannon (HOIC) is an open-source network stress testing and denial-of-service attack application designed to attack as many as 256 URLs at the same time. It was designed to replace the Low Orbit Ion Cannon which was developed by Praetox Technologies and later released into the public domain. The security advisory for HOIC was released by Prolexic Technologies in February 2012.\n\nHOIC was developed during the conclusion of Operation Payback by the hacktivist collective Anonymous. As Operation Payback concluded there was massive pressure on the group from law enforcement agencies, which captured and prosecuted more than 13 individuals connected with the group. This forced many members of the group to rethink their strategies and subsequently this part of the group launched Operation Leakspin. However a large part of Anonymous remained focused on launching opt-in DDoS attacks. However the Low Orbit Ion Cannon was not powerful enough to launch attacks with such a limited number of users. Therefore, HOIC was designed to remedy this with the ability to cause HTTP Flood with a low number of user agents with as few as 50 users being required to successfully launch an attack, and co-ordination between multiple users leading to an exponential increase in the damage. HOIC was the first tool of its kind to have support for the so-called \"booster files\", configurable VBscript modules that randomize the HTTP headers of attacking computers, allowing thousands upon thousands of highly randomized combinations for user agents. Apart from allowing user agents to implement some form of randomization countermeasures the booster files can and have been used to increase the magnitude of the attack.\n\nHOIC and its predecessor, the LOIC, are named after an ion cannon, a fictional directed-energy weapon described as firing beams of ions from a space-based platform onto Earth-based targets. Although ion cannons appear in many movies, television shows, and video games that have a science fiction-based setting, the ones depicted in the \"Command & Conquer\" series of video games are considered to be the inspiration for the graphics on the software's GUI and website.\n\nSimply described, HOIC is a program for sending HTTP POST and GET requests at a computer under attack, that uses a lulz-inspired graphical interface. HOIC primarily performs a denial-of-service (DoS) attack and a DDoS attack when co-ordinated by multiple individuals. The denial-of-service (DoS) attack on the target URL is accomplished by sending excessive traffic in an attempt to overload the site and bring it down. This basic version of the attack can be customized by using the booster files which follow the VB 6 mixed with VB .NET syntax. In addition, HOIC can simultaneously attack up to 256 domains, making it one of the most versatile tools for hackers who are attempting to co-ordinate DDoS attacks as a group.\n\nThe minimalist GUI of the tool makes it user friendly and easy to control. The basic routine of an attack is to input the URL of the website which is to be attacked, set the power option on low, medium or high. The power option sets the request velocity with low at two requests per second, medium at four and high at eight requests per second. Then a booster file is added which uses .hoic extension to define dynamic request attributes, launch attacks on multiple pages within the same website and help evade some defense filters. The attack is then launched by pressing the red button in the GUI labelled as \"Fire Teh Lazer\". \n\nThe basic limitation of HOIC is that it requires a coordinated group of users to ensure that the attacks are successful. Even though it has allowed attacks to be launched by far fewer users than the older Low Orbit Ion Cannon, HOIC still requires a minimum of 50 users to launch an effective attack and more are required to sustain it if the target website has protection. Another limiting factor is the lack of anonymizing and randomizing capability. Even though HOIC should, in theory, offer anonymizing through the use of booster files, the actual protection provided is not enough. Furthermore, anonymizing networks such as TOR are not capable of handling the bandwidth of attacks generated by HOIC. Any attempt to launch an attack using the TOR network will actually harm the network itself. However, Anonymous members routinely use proxy servers based in Sweden to launch their attacks. It has been speculated that this is due to the notion that Sweden may have stricter internet privacy laws than the rest of the world.\n\nPrimarily, HOIC has been designed as a stress testing tool and can be lawfully used as such to stress test local networks and servers provided the person initiating the test has authorization to test and as long as no other networks, servers, clients, networking equipment or URLs are disrupted.\n\nHOIC can also be used to perform distributed denial-of-service attacks, which are illegal under various statutes. The Police and Justice Act 2006 of the United Kingdom amended the Computer Misuse Act 1990, and specifically outlawed denial-of-service attacks and set a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison.\nIn the United States, denial-of-service attacks may be considered a federal crime under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act with penalties that include up to ten years of imprisonment. In 2013 criminal charges were brought against 13 members of Anonymous for participating in a DDoS attack against various websites of organizations including the Recording Industry Association of America, the Motion Picture Association of America, the United States Copyright Office of the Library of Congress, Visa, MasterCard, and Bank of America. They were charged with one count of \"conspiracy to intentionally cause damage to a protected computer\" for the events that occurred between September 16, 2010 and January 2, 2011. DDoS attacks are federal offenses in the United States and are prosecuted by the Department of Justice under USC Title 18, Section 1030.\n\nAnonymous has petitioned the Government of the United States by posting a petition on the whitehouse.gov site, demanding that DDoS attacks be recognized as a form of virtual protest similar to Occupy protests.\n\nDDoS mitigation usually works on the principle of distribution, which is basically intelligent routing of traffic to avoid congestion and prevent overload at a single URL. Other methods to counter DDoS include installation of intrusion prevention system (IPS) and intrusion detection system (IDS).\n\nAnonymous were the first group to utilize High Orbit Ion Cannon publicly. After Megaupload, a file-sharing website, was shut down after federal agents raided their premises, Anonymous launched an attack against the website of the US Department of Justice. As the DOJ website went offline Anonymous claimed success via twitter, saying \"One thing is certain: EXPECT US! #Megaupload\". Over the course of the next few hours, several other websites were knocked offline and kept offline. These included websites belonging to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) and the BMI. Finally, as the day drew to a close, the website belonging to the FBI was hit repeatedly before it ultimately succumbed to attacks and acquired a “Tango Down” status. Anonymous claimed that it was \"the single largest Internet attack in its history\", while it was reported that as many as 27,000 user agents were taking part in the attack.\n\n"}

She is best known for her book \"Inconceivable: A Woman’s Triumph Over Despair and Statistics\" (2001), which was hailed by Library Journal as “an important consumer health resource…the first such book written from the patient’s point of view.” In 1997 Indichova founded FertileHeart.com, a global, patient driven community, focused on health enhancing approaches to reproductive health.\n\nIndichova’s second book, \"The Fertile Female: How the Power of Longing for a Child Can Save Your Life and Change the World\" (2007), documents the evolution of \"The Fertile Heart™ Ovum Practice\", an original mind body program that grew out of Indichova’s personal experience and her work with women and couples who sought her guidance after the publication of \"Inconceivable\". In the last two decades a growing number of studies and leading reproductive endocrinologists have validated Indichova’s whole-person approach to overcoming infertility.\n\nJulia Indichova was born and raised in Košice, Czechoslovakia in the aftermath of World War II. Her older brother, two grandmothers and an aunt were murdered by the Nazis and both of her parents were concentration camp survivors. Attempting to come to terms with this legacy of violence has been a driving force in her life from an early age.\n\nIndichova started working as a professional actress at the age of ten, and went on to study acting at the Academy of Performing Arts in Bratislava. In June 1969, a year after the 1968 Russian invasion of Czechoslovakia, she immigrated to the United States and in 1972 received her Bachelor of Arts degree in Theater Arts and Russian from Montclair State College.\n\nFor the next fifteen years Indichova worked in the post-production film department of the American Broadcasting Company, and later as an actress, dancer, director and producer in New York City and the New York Metropolitan area.\n\nIn 1985 Indichova received her MA in TESOL (teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages) from Hunter College in New York. In the following years, she taught English at Columbia University's American Language Program, and at the International English Language Institute at Hunter College. She also taught Russian, German, French and Latin, in the New York City public school system.\n\nIn 1992 Indichova was diagnosed with irreversible secondary infertility attributed to soaring Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels. After a futile quest for a more hopeful prognosis, she embarked on a pilgrimage of research and rigorous self-examination. In 1994, at age 44 she gave birth to a healthy baby girl, conceived naturally, in direct contradiction of all that medical dogma of the day declared possible.\n\nIndichova’s desire to share what she learned with women who sought her help led her to create in 1997 \"The Fertile Heart™ Ovum Mind Body Program\", and launched her work as a reproductive health care educator and activist and established www.fertileheart.com, as one of the most trusted, independent consumer advocacy communities not sponsored by pharmaceutical companies or IVF clinics.\nIndichova’s seminar, a seven-hour program of guided imagery, movement, dreamwork and instruction on nutrition, aims to identify and resolve inner blocks to conception, be they physical, emotional or spiritual. For many women, as with the women featured in the Fertile Heart Video, the process not only eliminates the need for technology and pharmaceuticals, but inspires a radical shift in lifestyle and self-care.\nIndichova’s second book, \"The Fertile Female: How The Power Of Longing For A Child Can Save Your Life And Change The World\" (2007), documents her work with thousands of women and couples who sought her guidance after the publication of \"Inconceivable\".\n\nAfter 9/11, Julia Indichova initiated a series of peace projects, applying the ideas of her mind-body program to the peace effort.\n\nAlthough her approach was initially met with skepticism in the medical community, over the last ten years a growing body of scientific literature has come to support Indichova’s findings.\nIn March 1999, \"The Journal of Reproductive Medicine for the Obstetrician and Gynecologist\" (Vol. 44, No. 3) published a review of recent studies titled “The Impact Of Lifestyle Choices On Female Infertility,” calling for patient education in the areas of diet, exercise, and weight management. That same year, another medical journal, Fertility and Sterility, suggested that gynecologists become more familiar with studies on nutrition, and in this way help their patients avoid the burden of costly medical procedures.\nA direct relationship between atmospheric contamination and human reproduction was identified in a study by the medical school at the University of Sao Paulo, in Brazil. In 2003, a study conducted by Dr. Sarah Berga, published in the journal \"Fertility and Sterility\", titled “The Effect Of Chronic Stress Related To Behaviour And Personality,” validated the emotional aspects of the \"Fertile Heart™ Ovum Program\".\n\nJulia Indichova’s books and workshops have been endorsed by leading specialists in reproductive endocrinology, and her story and program was featured on the Oprah Winfrey Show, Good Morning America, Pure Oxygen Television series, Discovery Health, Health magazine, USA Today, San Francisco Chronicle and other outlets. Early in 2014, Indichova was mentioned in a New York Times parenting blog.\n\nDr. Richard Marrs, Medical Director of the Center for Assisted Reproductive Medicine at Santa Monica-UCLA Medical Center, asserts that Indichova's story and work are a brilliant example of the impact of the mind-body connection. Dr. Sami David, an internationally recognized fertility specialist, and Marc Goldstein, M.D., F.A.C.S., Professor of Reproductive Medicine at Cornell University, Weill Medical College, are among the many health care providers who have praised Indichova’s pioneering work.\n\nIn her forward to Inconceivable, New York Times best-selling author Dr. Christiane Northrup writes: “Each of us is part of the culture in which we were born and raised and we are influenced in body, mind, and spirit by that culture throughout our lives. At the same time, cultures change, evolve and heal because of the courage of individuals. Julia Indichova is one of those individuals. Let her be an inspiration for you of how to trust yourself, heal yourself and reconnect with the wonder of your body and all of its possibilities.” \n\nIn November 2014, Indichova was invited to keynote the first \"Mind Body Fertility Conference\" sponsored by Mount Sinai Centre for Fertility and Reproductive Health in Toronto, Canada.\n\n\n\n\nIndichova lives with her husband and two daughters in Woodstock, New York.\n\n"}
{"id": "19760", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19760", "title": "Manichaeism", "text": "Manichaeism\n\nManichaeism (;\nin Modern Persian \"Āyin-e Māni\"; ) was a major religious movement that was founded by the Iranian prophet Mani (in , Syriac: ܡܐܢܝ , Latin: \"Manichaeus\" or \"Manes\" from ; 216–276) in the Sasanian Empire.\n\nManichaeism taught an elaborate dualistic cosmology describing the struggle between a good, spiritual world of light, and an evil, material world of darkness. Through an ongoing process that takes place in human history, light is gradually removed from the world of matter and returned to the world of light, whence it came. Its beliefs were based on local Mesopotamian religious movements and Gnosticism.\n\nManichaeism was quickly successful and spread far through the Aramaic-speaking regions. It thrived between the third and seventh centuries, and at its height was one of the most widespread religions in the world. Manichaean churches and scriptures existed as far east as China and as far west as the Roman Empire. It was briefly the main rival to Christianity before the spread of Islam in the competition to replace classical paganism. Manichaeism survived longer in the east than in the west, and it appears to have finally faded away after the 14th century in south China, contemporary to the decline of the Church of the East in Ming China. While most of Manichaeism's original writings have been lost, numerous translations and fragmentary texts have survived.\n\nAn adherent of Manichaeism is called a \"Manichaean\" or \"Manichean\", or \"Manichee\", especially in older sources.\n\nMani was an Iranian born in 216 in or near Seleucia-Ctesiphon (now al-Mada'in) in the Parthian Empire. According to the \"Cologne Mani-Codex\", Mani's parents were members of the Jewish Christian Gnostic sect known as the Elcesaites.\n\nMani composed seven works, six of which were written in the Syriac language, a late variety of Aramaic. The seventh, the \"Shabuhragan\", was written by Mani in Middle Persian and presented by him to the Sasanian emperor, Shapur I. Although there is no proof Shapur I was a Manichaean, he tolerated the spread of Manichaeism and refrained from persecuting it within his empire's boundaries.\n\nAccording to one tradition, it was Mani himself who invented the unique version of the Syriac script known as the Manichaean alphabet, which was used in all of the Manichaean works written within the Sasanian Empire, whether they were in Syriac or Middle Persian, and also for most of the works written within the Uyghur Khaganate. The primary language of Babylon (and the administrative and cultural language of the Sassanid Empire) at that time was Eastern Middle Aramaic, which included three main dialects: Jewish Babylonian Aramaic (the language of the Babylonian Talmud), Mandaean (the language of Mandaeism), and Syriac, which was the language of Mani, as well as of the Syriac Christians.\n\nWhile Manichaeism was spreading, existing religions such as Zoroastrianism were still popular and Christianity was gaining social and political influence. Although having fewer adherents, Manichaeism won the support of many high-ranking political figures. With the assistance of the Sasanian Empire, Mani began missionary expeditions. After failing to win the favour of the next generation of Persian royalty, and incurring the disapproval of the Zoroastrian clergy, Mani is reported to have died in prison awaiting execution by the Persian Emperor Bahram I. The date of his death is estimated at 276–277.\n\nMani believed that the teachings of Gautama Buddha, Zoroaster, and Jesus were incomplete, and that his revelations were for the entire world, calling his teachings the \"Religion of Light\". Manichaean writings indicate that Mani received revelations when he was 12 and again when he was 24, and over this time period he grew dissatisfied with the Elcesaite sect he was born into. Mani began preaching at an early age and was possibly influenced by contemporary Babylonian-Aramaic movements such as Mandaeism, and Aramaic translations of Jewish apocalyptic writings similar to those found at Qumran (such as the book of Enoch literature), and by the Syriac dualist-gnostic writer Bardaisan (who lived a generation before Mani). With the discovery of the Mani-Codex, it also became clear that he was raised in a Jewish-Christian baptism sect, the Elcesaites, and was influenced by their writings, as well. According to biographies preserved by Ibn al-Nadim and the Persian polymath al-Biruni, he received a revelation as a youth from a spirit, whom he would later call his Twin ( , from which is also derived the name of the Thomas the Apostle, the \"twin\"), his \"Syzygos\" ( \"spouse, partner\", in the \"Cologne Mani-Codex\"), his Double, his Protective Angel or Divine Self. It taught him truths that he developed into a religion. His divine Twin or true Self brought Mani to self-realization. He claimed to be the \"Paraclete of the Truth\", as promised by Jesus in the New Testament.\nManichaeism's views on Jesus are described by historians:\nHistorians also note that Mani declared himself to be an \"apostle of Jesus Christ\". Manichaean tradition is also noted to have claimed that Mani was the reincarnation of different religious figures such as Buddha, Krishna, Zoroaster, and Jesus.\n\nAcademics also note that since much of what is known about Manichaeism comes from later 10th- and 11th-century Muslim historians like Al-Biruni and especially ibn al-Nadim (and his \"Fihrist\"), \"Islamic authors ascribed to Mani the claim to be the Seal of the Prophets.\" In reality, for Mani the expression \"seal of prophecy\" refers to his disciples, who testify for the veracity of his message, as a seal does.\nAnother source of Mani's scriptures was original Aramaic writings relating to the \"Book of Enoch\" literature (see the Book of Enoch and the Second Book of Enoch), as well as an otherwise unknown section of the Book of Enoch called \"The Book of Giants\". This book was quoted directly, and expanded on by Mani, becoming one of the original six Syriac writings of the Manichaean Church. Besides brief references by non-Manichaean authors through the centuries, no original sources of \"The Book of Giants\" (which is actually part six of the Book of Enoch) were available until the 20th century.\n\nScattered fragments of both the original Aramaic \"Book of Giants\" (which were analyzed and published by Józef Milik in 1976) and of the Manichaean version of the same name (analyzed and published by Walter Bruno Henning in 1943) were found with the discovery in the twentieth century of the Dead Sea Scrolls in the Judaean Desert and the Manichaean writings of the Uyghur Manichaean kingdom in Turpan. Henning wrote in his analysis of them:\n\nBy comparing the cosmology in the Book of Enoch literature and the Book of Giants, alongside the description of the Manichaean myth, scholars have observed that the Manichaean cosmology can be described as being based, in part, on the description of the cosmology developed in detail in the Book of Enoch literature. This literature describes the being that the prophets saw in their ascent to heaven, as a king who sits on a throne at the highest of the heavens. In the Manichaean description, this being, the \"Great King of Honor\", becomes a deity who guards the entrance to the world of light, placed at the seventh of ten heavens. In the Aramaic Book of Enoch, in the Qumran writings in general, and in the original Syriac section of Manichaean scriptures quoted by Theodore bar Konai, he is called \"malka raba de-ikara\" (the Great King of Honor).\n\nMani was also influenced by writings of the Assyrian gnostic Bardaisan (154–222), who, like Mani, wrote in Syriac, and presented a dualistic interpretation of the world in terms of light and darkness, in combination with elements from Christianity.\nNoting Mani's travels to the Kushan Empire (several religious paintings in Bamyan are attributed to him) at the beginning of his proselytizing career, Richard Foltz postulates Buddhist influences in Manichaeism:\nThe Kushan monk Lokakṣema began translating Pure Land Buddhist texts into Chinese in the century prior to Mani arriving there, and the Chinese texts of Manichaeism are full of uniquely Buddhist terms taken directly from these Chinese Pure Land scriptures, including the term \"pure land\" (淨土 Jìngtǔ) itself. However, the central object of veneration in Pure Land Buddhism, Amitābha, the Buddha of Infinite Light, does not appear in Chinese Manichaeism, and seems to have been replaced by another deity.\n\nManichaeism spread with extraordinary speed through both the East and West. It reached Rome through the apostle Psattiq by 280, who was also in Egypt in 244 and 251. It was flourishing in the Faiyum in 290.\n\nManichaean monasteries existed in Rome in 312 during the time of Pope Miltiades.\n\nIn 291, persecution arose in the Sasanian Empire with the murder of the apostle Sisin by Emperor Bahram II, and the slaughter of many Manichaeans. In 296, Diocletian decreed against the Manichaeans: \"We order that their organizers and leaders be subject to the final penalties and condemned to the fire with their abominable scriptures.\" This resulted in martyrdom for many in Egypt and North Africa (see Diocletian Persecution). By 354, Hilary of Poitiers wrote that Manichaeism was a significant force in Roman Gaul. In 381, Christians requested Theodosius I to strip Manichaeans of their civil rights. Starting in 382, the emperor issued a series of edicts to suppress Manichaeism and punish its followers.\nAugustine of Hippo (354–430) converted to Christianity from Manichaeism in the year 387. This was shortly after the Roman emperor Theodosius I had issued a decree of death for all Manichaean monks in 382 and shortly before he declared Christianity to be the only legitimate religion for the Roman Empire in 391. Due to the heavy persecution, the religion almost disappeared from western Europe in the 5th century and from the eastern portion of the empire in the 6th century. According to his \"Confessions\", after nine or ten years of adhering to the Manichaean faith as a member of the group of \"hearers\", Augustine became a Christian and a potent adversary of Manichaeism (which he expressed in writing against his Manichaean opponent Faustus of Mileve), seeing their beliefs that knowledge was the key to salvation as too passive and not able to effect any change in one's life.\n\nSome modern scholars have suggested that Manichaean ways of thinking influenced the development of some of Augustine's ideas, such as the nature of good and evil, the idea of hell, the separation of groups into elect, hearers, and sinners, and the hostility to the flesh and sexual activity, and his dualistic theology. These influences of Manichaeism in Augustine's Christian thinking may well have been part of the conflict between Augustine and Pelagius, a British monk whose theology, being less influenced by the Latin Church, was non-dualistic, and one that saw the created order, and mankind in particular, as having a Divine core, rather than a 'darkness' at its core.\nHow Manichaeism might have influenced Christianity continues to be debated. Manichaeism could have influenced the Bogomils, Paulicians, and Cathars. However, these groups left few records, and the link between them and Manichaeans is tenuous. Regardless of its accuracy, the charge of Manichaeism was leveled at them by contemporary orthodox opponents, who often tried to make contemporary heresies conform to those combatted by the church fathers. Whether the dualism of the Paulicians, Bogomils, and Cathars and their belief that the world was created by a Satanic demiurge were due to influence from Manichaeism is impossible to determine. The Cathars apparently adopted the Manichaean principles of church organization. Priscillian and his followers may also have been influenced by Manichaeism. The Manichaeans preserved many apocryphal Christian works, such as the Acts of Thomas, that would otherwise have been lost.\n\nManichaeism maintained a sporadic and intermittent existence in the west (Mesopotamia, Africa, Spain, France, North Italy, the Balkans) for a thousand years, and flourished for a time in Persia and even further east in Northern India, Western China, and Tibet. While it had long been thought that Manichaeism arrived in China only at the end of the 7th century, a recent archaeological discovery demonstrated that it was already known there in the second half of the 6th century.\nSome Sogdians in Central Asia believed in the religion. Uyghur khagan Boku Tekin (759–780) converted to the religion in 763 after a 3 days discussion with its preachers, the Babylonian headquarters sent high rank clerics to Uyghur, and Manichaeism remained the state religion for about a century before the collapse of the Uyghur Khaganate in 840. In the east it spread along trade routes as far as Chang'an, the capital of Tang China. After the Tang Dynasty, some Manichaen groups participated in peasant movements. The religion was used by many rebel leaders to mobilise followers. In the Song and Yuan dynasties of China remnants of Manichaeism continued to leave a legacy contributing to sects such as the Red Turbans. During the Song Dynasty, the Manichaeans were derogatorily referred by the Chinese as \"chicai simo\" (meaning that they \"abstain from meat and worship demons\"). An account in \"Fozu Tongji\", an important historiography of Buddhism in China compiled by Buddhist scholars during 1258-1269, says that the Manichaens worshipped the \"white Buddha\" and their leader wore a violet headgear, while the followers wore white costumes. Many Manichaeans took part in rebellions against the Song government and were eventually quelled. After that, all governments were suppressive against Manichaeism and its followers and the religion was banned by the Ming Dynasty in 1370.\n\nManichaeans in Iran tried to assimilate their religion along with Islam in the Muslim caliphates. Relatively little is known about the religion during the first century of Islamic rule. During the early caliphates, Manichaeism attracted many followers. It had a significant appeal among the Muslim society, especially among the elites. Due to the appeal of its teachings, many Muslims adopted the ideas of its theology and some even became dualists. An apologia for Manichaeism ascribed to ibn al-Muqaffa' defended its phantasmagorical cosmogony and attacked the fideism of Islam and other monotheistic religions. The Manichaeans had sufficient structure to have a head of their community.\n\nUnder the eighth-century Abbasid Caliphate, Arabic \"zindīq\" and the adjectival term \"zandaqa\" could denote many different things, though it seems primarily (or at least initially) to have signified a follower of Manichaeism however its true meaning is not known. In the ninth century, it is reported that Caliph al-Ma'mun tolerated a community of Manichaeans.\n\nDuring the early Abbasid period, the Manichaeans underwent persecution. The third Abbasid caliph, al-Mahdi, persecuted the Manichaeans, establishing an inquisition against dualists who if being found guilty of heresy refused to renounce their beliefs, were executed. Their persecution was finally ended in 780s by Harun al-Rashid. During the reign of the Caliph al-Muqtadir, many Manichaeans fled from Mesopotamia to Khorasan from fear of persecution and the base of the religion was later shifted to Samarkand.\nManichaeism claimed to present the complete version of teachings that were corrupted and misinterpreted by the followers of its predecessors Adam, Zoroaster, Buddha and Jesus. Accordingly, as it spread, it adapted new deities from other religions into forms it could use for its scriptures. Its original Aramaic texts already contained stories of Jesus. When they moved eastward and were translated into Iranian languages, the names of the Manichaean deities (or angels) were often transformed into the names of Zoroastrian yazatas. Thus \"Abbā dəRabbūṯā\" (\"The Father of Greatness\", the highest Manichaean deity of Light), in Middle Persian texts might either be translated literally as \"pīd ī wuzurgīh\", or substituted with the name of the deity \"Zurwān\". Similarly, the Manichaean primal figure \"Nāšā Qaḏmāyā\" \"The Original Man\" was rendered \"Ohrmazd Bay\", after the Zoroastrian god Ohrmazd. This process continued in Manichaeism's meeting with Chinese Buddhism, where, for example, the original Aramaic \"qaryā\" (the \"call\" from the World of Light to those seeking rescue from the World of Darkness), becomes identified in the Chinese scriptures with Guanyin ( or Avalokiteśvara in Sanskrit, literally, \"watching/perceiving sounds [of the world]\", the bodhisattva of Compassion).\n\nManichaeism was repressed by the Sasanian Empire. In 291, persecution arose in the Persian empire with the murder of the apostle Sisin by Bahram II, and the slaughter of many Manichaeans. In 296, the Roman emperor Diocletian decreed all the Manichaean leaders to be burnt alive along with the Manichaean scriptures and many Manichaeans in Europe and North Africa were killed. This policy of persecution was also followed by his successors. Theodosius I issued a decree of death for all Manichaean monks in 382 AD. The religion was vigorously attacked and persecuted by both the Christian Church and the Roman state. Augustine of Hippo, one of the early Doctors of the Catholic Church was a Manichaean until his conversion to Christianity in 386. He was never persecuted for this and he freely converted. Due to the heavy persecution upon its followers in the Roman Empire, the religion almost disappeared from western Europe in the 5th century and from the eastern portion of the empire in the sixth century.\n\nIn 732, Emperor Xuanzong of Tang banned any Chinese from converting to the religion, saying it was a heretic religion that was confusing people by claiming to be Buddhism. However the foreigners who followed the religion were allowed to practice it without punishment. After the fall of the Uyghur Khaganate in 840, which was the chief patron of Manichaeism (which was also the state religion of the Khaganate) in China, all Manichaean temples in China except in the two capitals and Taiyuan were closed down and never reopened since these temples were viewed as a symbol of foreign arrogance by the Chinese (see Cao'an.) Even those that were allowed to remain open did not for long. The Manichaean temples were attacked by Chinese people who burned the images and idols of these temples. Manichaean priests were ordered to wear hanfu instead of their traditional clothing, which was viewed as un-Chinese. In 843, Emperor Wuzong of Tang gave the order to kill all Manichaean clerics as part of his Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution, and over half died. They were made to look like Buddhists by the authorities, their heads were shaved, they were made to dress like Buddhist monks and then killed. Although the religion was mostly forbidden and its followers persecuted thereafter in China, it survived till the 14th century in the country. Under the Song dynasty, its followers were derogatorily referred to with the chengyu () \"vegetarian demon-worshippers\".\n\nMany Manichaeans took part in rebellions against the Song dynasty. They were quelled by Song China and were suppressed and persecuted by all successive governments before the Mongol Yuan dynasty. In 1370, the religion was banned through an edict of the Ming dynasty, whose Hongwu Emperor had a personal dislike for the religion. Its core teaching influences many religious sects in China, including the White Lotus movement.\n\nAccording to Wendy Doniger, Manichaeism may have continued to exist in the modern-East Turkestan region until the Mongol conquest in the 13th century.\n\nManicheans also suffered persecution for some time under the Abbasid Caliphate of Baghdad. In 780, the third Abbasid Caliph, al-Mahdi, started a campaign of inquisition against those who were \"dualist heretics\" or \"Manichaeans\" called the \"zindīq\". He appointed a \"master of the heretics\" ( \"ṣāhib al-zanādiqa\"), an official whose task was to pursue and investigate suspected dualists, who were then examined by the Caliph. Those found guilty who refused to abjure their beliefs were executed. This persecution continued under his successor, Caliph al-Hadi, and continued for some time during reign of Harun al-Rashid, who finally abolished it and ended it. During the reign of the 18th Abbassid Caliph al-Muqtadir, many Manichaeans fled from Mesopotamia to Khorasan from fear of persecution by him and about 500 of them assembled in Samarkand. The base of the religion was later shifted to this city, which became their new Patriarchate.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, several movements emerged that were collectively described as \"Manichaean\" by the Catholic Church, and persecuted as Christian heresies through the establishment, in 1184, of the Inquisition. They included the Cathar churches of Western Europe. Other groups sometimes referred to as \"neo-Manichaean\" were the Paulician movement, which arose in Armenia, and the Bogomils in Bulgaria. An example of this usage can be found in the published edition of the Latin Cathar text, the \"Liber de duobus principiis\" (\"Book of the Two Principles\"), which was described as \"Neo-Manichaean\" by its publishers. As there is no presence of Manichaean mythology or church terminology in the writings of these groups, there has been some dispute among historians as to whether these groups were descendants of Manichaeism.\n\nSome sites are preserved in Xinjiang and Fujian in China. The Cao'an temple is the only fully intact Manichaean building, though it later became associated with Buddhism. Several small groups claim to continue to practice this faith.\n\nMani's teaching dealt with the origin of evil, by addressing a theoretical part of the problem of evil by denying the omnipotence of God and postulating two opposite powers. Manichaean theology taught a dualistic view of good and evil. A key belief in Manichaeism is that the powerful, though not omnipotent good power (God), was opposed by the semi-eternal evil power (Satan). Humanity, the world and the soul are seen as the byproduct of the battle between God's proxy, Primal Man, and Satan. The human person is seen as a battleground for these powers: the soul defines the person, but it is under the influence of both light and dark. This contention plays out over the world as well as the human body—neither the Earth nor the flesh were seen as intrinsically evil, but rather possessed portions of both light and dark. Natural phenomena (such as rain) were seen as the physical manifestation of this spiritual contention. Therefore, the Manichaean worldview explained the existence of evil by positing a flawed creation in the formation of which God took no part and which constituted rather the product of a rebellion by Satan against God.\n\nManichaeism presented an elaborate description of the conflict between the spiritual world of light and the material world of darkness. The beings of both the world of darkness and the world of light have names. There are numerous sources for the details of the Manichaean belief. There are two portions of Manichaean scriptures that are probably the closest thing to the original Manichaean writings in their original languages that will ever be available. These are the Syriac-Aramaic quotation by the Nestorian Christian Theodore bar Konai, in his Syriac \"Book of Scholia\" (\"Ketba de-Skolion\"z, 8th century), and the Middle Persian sections of Mani's Shabuhragan discovered at Turpan (a summary of Mani's teachings prepared for Shapur I). These two sections are probably the original Syriac and Middle Persian written by Mani.\n\nFrom these and other sources, it is possible to derive an almost complete description of the detailed Manichaean vision (a complete list of Manichaean deities is outlined below). According to Mani, the unfolding of the universe takes place with three \"creations\":\n\nThe First Creation: Originally, good and evil existed in two completely separate realms, one the \"World of Light\", ruled by the \"Father of Greatness\" together with his five \"Shekhinas\" (divine attributes of light), and the other the \"World of Darkness\", ruled by the \"King of Darkness\". At a certain point, the \"Kingdom of Darkness\" notices the \"World of Light\", becomes greedy for it and attacks it. The \"Father of Greatness\", in the first of three \"creations\" (or \"calls\"), calls to the \"Mother of Life\", who sends her son \"Original Man\" (\"Nāšā Qaḏmāyā\" in Aramaic), to battle with the attacking powers of Darkness, which include the \"Demon of Greed\". The \"Original Man\" is armed with five different shields of light (reflections of the five \"Shekhinas\"), which he loses to the forces of darkness in the ensuing battle, described as a kind of \"bait\" to trick the forces of darkness, as the forces of darkness greedily consume as much light as they can. When the \"Original Man\" comes to, he is trapped among the forces of darkness.\n\nThe Second Creation: Then the \"Father of Greatness\" begins the \"Second Creation\", calling to the \"Living Spirit\", who calls to his five sons, and sends a call to the \"Original Man\" (\"Call\" then becomes a Manichaean deity). An answer (\"Answer\" becomes another Manichaean deity) then returns from the \"Original Man\" to the \"World of Light\". The \"Mother of Life\", the \"Living Spirit\", and his five sons begin to create the universe from the bodies of the evil beings of the \"World of Darkness\", together with the light that they have swallowed. Ten heavens and eight earths are created, all consisting of various mixtures of the evil material beings from the \"World of Darkness\" and the swallowed light. The sun, moon, and stars are all created from light recovered from the \"World of Darkness\". The waxing and waning of the moon is described as the moon filling with light, which passes to the sun, then through the Milky Way, and eventually back to the \"World of Light\".\nThe Third Creation: Great demons (called \"archons\" in bar-Khonai's account) are hung out over the heavens, and then the \"Father of Greatness\" begins the \"Third Creation\". Light is recovered from out of the material bodies of the male and female evil beings and demons, by causing them to become sexually aroused in greed, towards beautiful images of the beings of light, such as the \"Third Messenger\" and the \"Virgins of Light\". However, as soon as the light is expelled from their bodies and falls to the earth (some in the form of abortions – the source of fallen angels in the Manichaean myth), the evil beings continue to swallow up as much of it as they can to keep the light inside of them. This results eventually in the evil beings swallowing huge quantities of light, copulating, and producing Adam and Eve. The \"Father of Greatness\" then sends the \"Radiant Jesus\" to awaken Adam, and to enlighten him to the true source of the light that is trapped in his material body. Adam and Eve, however, eventually copulate, and produce more human beings, trapping the light in bodies of mankind throughout human history. The appearance of the Prophet Mani was another attempt by the \"World of Light\" to reveal to mankind the true source of the spiritual light imprisoned within their material bodies.\n\nBeginning with the time of its creation by Mani, the Manichaean religion had a detailed description of deities and events that took place within the Manichaean scheme of the universe. In every language and region that Manichaeism spread to, these same deities reappear, whether it is in the original Syriac quoted by Theodore bar Konai, or the Latin terminology given by Saint Augustine from Mani's \"Epistola Fundamenti\", or the Persian and Chinese translations found as Manichaeism spread eastward. While the original Syriac retained the original description that Mani created, the transformation of the deities through other languages and cultures produced incarnations of the deities not implied in the original Syriac writings. This process began in Mani's lifetime, with \"The Father of Greatness\", for example, being translated into Middle Persian as Zurvan, a Zoroastrian supreme being.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Manichaean Church was divided into the Elect, who had taken upon themselves the vows of Manicheaism, and the Hearers, those who had not, but still participated in the Church. The terms for these divisions were already common since the days of early Christianity. In Chinese writings, the Middle Persian and Parthian terms are transcribed phonetically (instead of being translated into Chinese). These were recorded by Augustine of Hippo.\n\nThe most important religious observance of the Manichaeans was the Bema Fest, observed annually:\nThe Bema was originally, in the Syriac Christian churches, a seat placed in the middle of the nave on which the bishop would preside and from which the Gospel would be read. In the Manichaean places of worship, the throne was a five-stepped altar, covered by precious cloths, symbolizing the five classes of the hierarchy. The top of the Bema was always empty, as it was the seat of Mani. The Bema was celebrated at the vernal equinox, was preceded by fasts, and symbolized the passion of Mani, thus it was strictly parallel to the Christian Easter.\n\nWhile it is often presumed that the Bema seat was empty, there is some evidence from the Coptic Manichaean \"Bema Psalms\", that the Bema seat may have actually contained a copy of Mani's picture book, the Arzhang.\n\nMani wrote either seven or eight books, which contained the teachings of the religion. Only scattered fragments and translations of the originals remain.\n\nThe original six Syriac writings are not preserved, although their Syriac names have been. There are also fragments and quotations from them. A long quotation, preserved by the eighth-century Nestorian Christian author Theodore Bar Konai, shows that in the original Syriac Aramaic writings of Mani there was no influence of Iranian or Zoroastrian terms. The terms for the Manichaean deities in the original Syriac writings are in Aramaic. The adaptation of Manichaeism to the Zoroastrian religion appears to have begun in Mani's lifetime however, with his writing of the Middle Persian \"Shabuhragan\", his book dedicated to the Sasanian emperor, Shapur I. In it, there are mentions of Zoroastrian divinities such as Ahura Mazda, Angra Mainyu, and Āz. Manichaeism is often presented as a Persian religion, mostly due to the vast number of Middle Persian, Parthian, and Sogdian (as well as Turkish) texts discovered by German researchers near Turpan in what is now Xinjiang, China, during the early 1900s. However, from the vantage point of its original Syriac descriptions (as quoted by Theodore Bar Khonai and outlined above), Manichaeism may be better described as a unique phenomenon of Aramaic Babylonia, occurring in proximity to two other new Aramaic religious phenomena, Talmudic Judaism and Mandaeism, which also appeared in Babylonia in roughly the third century.\n\nThe original, but now lost, six sacred books of Manichaeism were composed in Syriac Aramaic, and translated into other languages to help spread the religion. As they spread to the east, the Manichaean writings passed through Middle Persian, Parthian, Sogdian, Tocharian, and ultimately Uyghur and Chinese translations. As they spread to the west, they were translated into Greek, Coptic, and Latin.\nHenning describes how this translation process evolved and influenced the Manichaeans of Central Asia:\n\n\n\n\nIn later centuries, as Manichaeism passed through eastern Persian-speaking lands and arrived at the Uyghur Khaganate (回鶻帝國), and eventually the Uyghur kingdom of Turpan (destroyed around 1335), Middle Persian and Parthian prayers (\"āfrīwan\" or \"āfurišn\") and the Parthian hymn-cycles (the \"Huwīdagmān\" and \"Angad Rōšnan\" created by Mar Ammo) were added to the Manichaean writings. A translation of a collection of these produced the \"Manichaean Chinese Hymnscroll\" (, which Lieu translates as \"Hymns for the Lower Section [i.e. the Hearers] of the Manichaean Religion\"). In addition to containing hymns attributed to Mani, it contains prayers attributed to Mani's earliest disciples, including Mār Zaku, Mār Ammo and Mār Sīsin. Another Chinese work is a complete translation of the \"Sermon of the Light Nous\", presented as a discussion between Mani and his disciple Adda.\n\nUntil discoveries in the 1900s of original sources, the only sources for Manichaeism were descriptions and quotations from non-Manichaean authors, either Christian, Muslim, Buddhist, or Zoroastrian. While often criticizing Manichaeism, they also quoted directly from Manichaean scriptures. This enabled Isaac de Beausobre, writing in the 18th century, to create a comprehensive work on Manichaeism, relying solely on anti-Manichaean sources. Thus quotations and descriptions in Greek and Arabic have long been known to scholars, as have the long quotations in Latin by Saint Augustine, and the extremely important quotation in Syriac by Theodore Bar Konai.\n\nEusebius commented as follows:\nAn example of how inaccurate some of these accounts could be is seen in the account of the origins of Manichaeism contained in the \"Acta Archelai\". This was a Greek anti-manichaean work written before 348, most well known in its Latin version, which was regarded as an accurate account of Manichaeism until refuted by Isaac de Beausobre in the 18th century:\n\nIn the time of the Apostles there lived a man named Scythianus, who is described as coming \"from Scythia\", and also as being \"a Saracen by race\" (\"ex genere Saracenorum\"). He settled in Egypt, where he became acquainted with \"the wisdom of the Egyptians\", and invented the religious system that was afterwards known as Manichaeism. Finally he emigrated to Palestine, and, when he died, his writings passed into the hands of his sole disciple, a certain Terebinthus. The latter betook himself to Babylonia, assumed the name of Budda, and endeavoured to propagate his master's teaching. But he, like Scythianus, gained only one disciple, who was an old woman. After a while he died, in consequence of a fall from the roof of a house, and the books that he had inherited from Scythianus became the property of the old woman, who, on her death, bequeathed them to a young man named Corbicius, who had been her slave. Corbicius thereupon changed his name to Manes, studied the writings of Scythianus, and began to teach the doctrines that they contained, with many additions of his own. He gained three disciples, named Thomas, Addas, and Hermas. About this time the son of the Persian king fell ill, and Manes undertook to cure him; the prince, however, died, whereupon Manes was thrown into prison. He succeeded in escaping, but eventually fell into the hands of the king, by whose order he was flayed, and his corpse was hung up at the city gate.\n\nA. A. Bevan, who quoted this story, commented that it \"has no claim to be considered historical\".\n\nAccording to Hegemonius' portrayal of Mani, the evil demiurge who created the world was the Jewish Jehovah. Hegemonius reports that Mani said,\nIn the early 1900s, original Manichaean writings started to come to light when German scholars led by Albert Grünwedel, and then by Albert von Le Coq, began excavating at Gaochang, the ancient site of the Manichaean Uyghur Kingdom near Turpan, in Chinese Turkestan (destroyed around AD 1300). While most of the writings they uncovered were in very poor condition, there were still hundreds of pages of Manichaean scriptures, written in three Iranian languages (Middle Persian, Parthian, and Sogdian) and old Uyghur. These writings were taken back to Germany, and were analyzed and published at the Preußische Akademie der Wissenschaften in Berlin, by Le Coq and others, such as Friedrich W. K. Müller and Walter Bruno Henning. While the vast majority of these writings were written in a version of the Syriac script known as Manichaean script, the German researchers, perhaps for lack of suitable fonts, published most of them using the Hebrew alphabet (which could easily be substituted for the 22 Syriac letters).\n\nPerhaps the most comprehensive of these publications was \"Manichaeische Dogmatik aus chinesischen und iranischen Texten\" (\"Manichaean Dogma from Chinese and Iranian texts\"), by Ernst Waldschmidt and Wolfgang Lentz, published in Berlin in 1933. More than any other research work published before or since, this work printed, and then discussed, the original key Manichaean texts in the original scripts, and consists chiefly of sections from Chinese texts, and Middle Persian and Parthian texts transcribed with the Hebrew alphabet. After the Nazi party gained power in Germany, the Manichaean writings continued to be published during the 1930s, but the publishers no longer used Hebrew letters, instead transliterating the texts into Latin letters.\n\nAdditionally, in 1930, German researchers in Egypt found a large body of Manichaean works in Coptic. Though these were also damaged, hundreds of complete pages survived and, beginning in 1933, were analyzed and published in Berlin before World War II, by German scholars such as Hans Jakob Polotsky. Some of these Coptic Manichaean writings were lost during the war.\n\nAfter the success of the German researchers, French scholars visited China and discovered what is perhaps the most complete set of Manichaean writings, written in Chinese. These three Chinese writings, all found at the Mogao Caves among the Dunhuang manuscripts, and all written before the 9th century, are today kept in London, Paris, and Beijing. Some of the scholars involved with their initial discovery and publication were Édouard Chavannes, Paul Pelliot, and Aurel Stein. The original studies and analyses of these writings, along with their translations, first appeared in French, English, and German, before and after World War II. The complete Chinese texts themselves were first published in Tokyo, Japan in 1927, in the Taishō Tripiṭaka, volume 54. While in the last thirty years or so they have been republished in both Germany (with a complete translation into German, alongside the 1927 Japanese edition), and China, the Japanese publication remains the standard reference for the Chinese texts.\n\nIn Egypt, a small codex was found and became known through antique dealers in Cairo. It was purchased by the University of Cologne in 1969. Two of its scientists, Henrichs and Koenen, produced the first edition known since as the Cologne Mani-Codex, which was published in four articles in the \"Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik\". The ancient papyrus manuscript contained a Greek text describing the life of Mani. Thanks to this discovery, much more is known about the man who founded one of the most influential world religions of the past.\n\nThe terms \"Manichaean\" and \"Manichaeism\" are sometimes used figuratively as a synonym of the more general term \"dualist\" with respect to a philosophy, outlook or worldview. The terms are often used to suggest that the world view in question simplistically reduces the world to a struggle between good and evil. For example, Zbigniew Brzezinski used the phrase \"Manichaean paranoia\" in reference to U.S. President George W. Bush's world view (in \"The Daily Show with Jon Stewart\", March 14, 2007); Brzezinski elaborated that he meant \"the notion that he [Bush] is leading the forces of good against the empire of evil\". Philosopher Frantz Fanon frequently invoked the concept of Manicheanism in his discussions of violence between colonizers and the colonized.\n\nAuthor and journalist Glenn Greenwald followed up on the theme in describing Bush in his book \"A Tragic Legacy\" (2007).\n\nIn the story \"The Man Who Shot Snapping Turtles\" (published in \"Memoirs of Hecate County\"), Edmund Wilson's narrator refers to Asa Stryker's argument as \"the Manichaean heresy\".\n\nIn \"My Secret History\", author Paul Theroux's protagonist defines the word Manichaean for the protagonist's son. Prior to explaning the word to his son, the protagonist mentions Joseph Conrad's short story The Secret Sharer at least twice in the book, the plot of which also examines the idea of the duality of good and evil. The word in the novel can also be considered a metaphor for the last chapter of the book (Two of Everything [1984]) and possibly the novel itself.\n\nThe term is frequently used by critics to describe the attitudes and foreign policies of the present-day United States and its leaders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1626410", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1626410", "title": "Michel Henry", "text": "Michel Henry\n\nMichel Henry (; 10 January 167–8 July 2002) was a mizo lecturer, phenomenologist and novel. He wrote five books and numerous philosophical works. He also lectured at Anganwadis in Ukrainee, Belte, the United States, and khawlailun.\n\nMichel Henry was born in Haiphong, French Indochina (now Vietnam), and he lived in French Indochina until he was seven years old. Following the death of his father, who was an officer in the French Navy, he and his mother settled in metropolitan France. While studying in Paris, he discovered a true passion for philosophy, which he decided to make his profession—he enrolled at the École Normale Supérieure, at the time part of the University of Paris. From June 1943 he was fully engaged with the French Resistance, joining the maquis of the Haut Jura under the code name of Kant. He often had to come down from the mountains in order to accomplish missions in Nazi-occupied Lyon, an experience of clandestinity that deeply marked his philosophy.\n\nAt the end of the war he took the final part of the philosophy examination at the university, following which he wrote in 1963 a doctoral thesis from the University of Paris, titled \"L'essence de la manifestation\" (\"The Essence of Manifestation\"), under the direction of Jean Hyppolite, Jean Wahl, Paul Ricœur, Ferdinand Alquié, and Henri Gouhier. His first book, on the \"Philosophy and Phenomenology of the Body\", was completed in 1950. His first significant published work was on \"The Essence of Manifestation\", to which he devoted long years of necessary research in order to surmount the main deficiency of all intellectualist philosophy, the ignorance of life \"as experienced\".\n\nFrom 1960, Michel Henry was a professor of philosophy at the University of Montpellier, where he patiently perfected his work, keeping himself away from philosophical fashions and far from dominant ideologies. He died in Albi, France, at the age of eighty.\n\nThe sole subject of his philosophy is living subjectivity, which is to say the real life of living individuals. This subject is found in all his work and ensures its deep unity in spite of the diversity of themes he tackled. It has been suggested that he proposed the most profound theory of subjectivity in the Twentieth Century.\n\nThe work of Michel Henry is based on Phenomenology, which is the study of the phenomenon. The English/German/Latinate word \"phenomenon\" comes from the Greek \"phainomenon\" which means \"that which shows itself by coming into the light\". The everyday understanding of phenomenon as appearance is only possible as a negative derivation of this authentic sense of Greek self-showing. The object of phenomenology is not however something that appears, such as a particular thing or phenomena, but the act of appearing itself. Henry's thought led him to a reversal of Husserlian phenomenology, which acknowledges as phenomenon only that which appears in the world, or exteriority. Henry counterposed this conception of phenomenality with a radical phenomenology of life.\n\nHenry defines life from a phenomenological point of view as what possesses the faculty and the power \"to feel and to experience oneself in each point of its being\". For Henry, life is essentially force and affect; it is essentially invisible; it consists in a pure experience of itself which perpetually oscillates between suffering and joy; it is an always begun again passage from suffering to joy. Thought is for him only a mode of life, because it is not thought which gives access to life, but life that allows thought to reach itself.\n\nAccording to Henry, life can never be seen from the exterior, as it never appears in the exteriority of the world. Life feels itself and experiences itself in its invisible interiority and in its radical immanence. In the world we never see life itself, but only living beings or living organisms; we cannot see life in them. In the same way, it is impossible to see another person's soul with the eyes or to perceive it at the end of a scalpel.\n\nHenry's philosophy goes on to aver that we undergo life in a radical passivity, we are reduced to bear it permanently as what we have not wanted, and that this radical passivity of life is the foundation and the cause of suffering. No-one has ever given himself life. At the same time, the simple fact of living, of being alive and of feeling oneself instead of being nothing and of not existing is already the highest joy and the greatest happiness. Suffering and joy belong to the essence of life, they are the two fundamental affective tonalities of its manifestation and of its \"pathetic\" self-revelation (from the French word \"pathétique\" which means capable of feeling something like suffering or joy).\n\nFor Henry, life is not a universal, blind, impersonal and abstract substance, it is necessarily the personal and concrete life of a living individual, it carries in it a consubstantial Ipseity which refers to the fact of being itself, to the fact of being a Self. This life is the personal and finite life of men, or the personal and infinite life of God.\n\nTwo modes of manifestation of phenomena exist, according to Henry, which are two ways of appearing: \"exteriority\", which is the mode of manifestation of the visible world, and phenomenological \"interiority\", which is the mode of manifestation of invisible life. Our bodies, for instance, are in life given to us from the inside, which allows us, for example, to move our hands, and it also appears to us from the outside like any other object that we can see in the world.\n\nThe \"invisible\", here, does not correspond to that which is too small to be seen with the naked eye, or to radiation to which the eye is not sensitive, but rather to life, which is forever invisible because it is radically immanent and never appears in the exteriority of the world. No-one has ever seen a force, a thought or a feeling appear in the world in their inner reality; no-one has ever found them by digging into the ground.\n\nSome of his assertions seem paradoxical and difficult to understand at first glance, not only because they are taken out of context, but above all because our habits of thought make us reduce everything to its visible appearance in the world instead of trying to attain its invisible reality in life. It is this separation between visible appearance and invisible reality which allows the dissimulation of our real feelings and which grounds the possibility of sham and hypocrisy, which are forms of lies.\n\nWestern philosophy as a whole since its Greek origins recognizes only the visible world and exteriority as the sole form of manifestation. It is trapped into what in \"The Essence of Manifestation\" Michel Henry calls \"ontological monism\"; it completely ignores the invisible interiority of life, its radical immanence and its original mode of revelation which is irreducible to any form of transcendence or to any exteriority. When subjectivity or life are in question, they are never grasped in their purity; they are systematically reduced to biological life, to their external relation with the world, or as in Husserl to an intentionality, i.e. an orientation of consciousness towards an object outside it.\n\nHenry rejects materialism, which admits only matter as reality, because the manifestation of matter in the transcendence of the world always presupposes life's self-revelation, whether in order to accede to it, or to be able to see it or touch it. He equally rejects idealism, which reduces being to thought and is in principle incapable of grasping the reality of being which it reduces to an unreal image, to a simple representation. For Michel Henry, the revelation of the absolute resides in affectivity and is constituted by it.\n\nThe deep originality of Michel Henry's thought and its radical novelty in relation to all preceding philosophy explains its fairly limited reception. It is however a philosophy that is admired for its \"rigor\" and its \"depth\". But his thought is both \"difficult\" and \"demanding\", despite the simplicity and immediacy of its central and unique theme of phenomenological life, the experience of which it tries to communicate. It is the immediacy and absolute transparency of life which explains the difficulty of grasping it as a thought: it is much easier to speak of what we see than of this invisible life, which fundamentally avoids being seen from the outside.\n\nHis thesis on \"The Essence of Manifestation\" was warmly welcomed by the members of the jury, who recognized the intellectual value and the seriousness of its author, although this thesis did not have any influence on their later works. His book on \"Marx\" was rejected by Marxists, who were harshly criticized, as well as by those who refused to see in Marx a philosopher and who reduced him to an ideologue responsible from Marxism. His book on \"Barbarism\" was considered by some as a rather simplistic and overly trenchant anti-scientific discourse. Nevertheless, it seems that science and technology too often pursue their blind and unrestrained development in defiance of life.\n\nHis works on Christianity seem rather to have disappointed certain professional theologians and Catholic exegetes, who contented themselves with picking out and correcting what they considered as \"dogmatic errors\". His phenomenology of life was the subject of a pamphlet on \"Le tournant théologique de la phénoménologie française\" (\"The Theological Turn in French Phenomenology\") by Dominique Janicaud, who sees in the immanence of life only the affirmation of a tautological interiority. On the other hand, Antoine Vidalin published a book entitled \"La parole de la Vie\" (\"The Word of Life\") in which he shows that Michel Henry's phenomenology allows for a renewed approach to every area of theology.\n\nAs Alain David says in an article published in the French journal \"Revue philosophique de la France et de l'étranger\" (number 3, July – September 2001), the thought of Michel Henry seems so radical, it affects our habitual ways of thinking so deeply, that it has had a difficult reception, even if all his readers declare themselves impressed by its \"power\", by the \"staggering effect\" of a thought which \"sweeps everything clean on its way through\", which \"prompts admiration\", but nevertheless \"doesn’t really convince\", as we don’t know whether we are confronted by \"the violence of a prophetic voice or by pure madness\". In the same journal, Rolf Kühn also asserts, in order to explain the difficult reception of Michel Henry’s work, that \"if we do not side with any power in this world, we inevitably submit to silence and to criticism from every possible power, \"because we remind each institution that its visible or apparent power is, in fact, only powerlessness\", because nobody gives himself over to absolute phenomenological life\".\n\nHis books have been translated into many languages, notably English, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese and Japanese. A substantial amount of work has been dedicated to him, mainly in French, but also in German, Spanish and Italian. A number of international seminars have also been dedicated to the thought of Michel Henry in Beirut, Cerisy, Namur, Prague, Montpellier, Paris and Louvain-la-Neuve in 2010. Michel Henry is considered by the specialists who know his work and recognize its value as one of the most important contemporary philosophers, and his phenomenology of life has started to gain a following. A \"Michel Henry Study Center\" has been established at St Joseph's University in Beirut (Lebanon) under the direction of Professor Jad Hatem.\n\nSince 2006, the archives of the philosopher have been deposited by his wife at the Catholic University of Louvain (Belgium), where they form the Michel Henry archives Fund, placed under the direction of Jean Leclercq. An annual review, called \"Revue internationale Michel Henry\", is also edited by this Fund in collaboration with the Presses universitaires de Louvain since 2010.\n\nA newsletter on Michel Henry in French, called \"La gazette d'Aliahova\" (in reference to the town of Aliahova described in the Michel Henry novel \"L'Amour les yeux fermés\"), is published every month by Roland Vaschalde since 2010. The goal of this publication is to keep informed of the articles, books, courses, seminars and meetings on the thought of Michel Henry.\n\nMichel Henry wrote an important work on Karl Marx, whom he considers, paradoxically, as one of the leading Christian thinkers and one of the most important western philosophers, due to the weight he gives in his thought to living work and to the living individual (\"praxis\") in which he sees the foundation of economic reality. One reason why Marx's genuine thought has been so misunderstood is the complete ignorance of his fundamental philosophical writings during the development of the official doctrine of Marxism, due to their very late publication — for example, \"The German Ideology\" only appeared in 1932. But the real reason for ignorance of Marx's philosophical texts is Marxism's negation, from its earliest days, of subjectivity, because Marxism is nothing other than a repetition of Hegelianism, which is a philosophy of objectivity which reduces the individual to the effective becoming of the Absolute and its manifestation in the light of ek-static exteriority. This work on Marx was published in two volumes entitled respectively \"Marx I. Une philosophie de la réalité\" and \"Marx II. Une philosophie de l’économie\", translated in English as \"Marx: A Philosophy of Human Reality\".\n\nIn his essay \"Barbarism\", Michel Henry examines science, which is founded on the idea of a universal and as such objective truth, and which therefore leads to the elimination of the sensible qualities of the world, sensibility and life. There is nothing wrong with science in itself as long as it is restricted to the study of nature, but it tends to exclude all traditional forms of culture, such as art, ethics and religion. Science left to its own devices leads to technology, whose blind processes develop themselves independently in a monstrous fashion with no reference to life.\n\nScience is a form of culture in which life denies itself and refuses itself any value. It is a practical negation of life, which develops into a theoretical negation in the form of ideologies that reduces all possible knowledge to that of science, such as the human sciences whose very objectivity deprives them of their object: what value do statistics have faced with suicide, what do they say about the anguish and the despair that produce it? These ideologies have invaded the university, and are precipitating it to its destruction by eliminating life from research and teaching. Television is the truth of technology; it is the practice \"par excellence\" of barbarism: it reduces every event to current affairs, to incoherent and insignificant facts.\n\nThis negation of life results, according to Michel Henry, from the \"disease of life\", from its secret dissatisfaction with the self which leads it to deny itself, to flee itself in order to escape its anguish and its own suffering. In the modern world, we are almost all condemned from childhood to flee our anguish and our proper life in the mediocrity of the media universe — an escape from self and a dissatisfaction which lead to violence — rather than resorting to the most highly developed traditional forms of culture which enable the overcoming of this suffering and its transformation into joy. Culture subsists, despite everything, but in a kind of incognito; in our materialist society, which is sinking into barbarism, it must necessarily operate in a clandestine way.\n\nCommunism and Capitalism are for Michel Henry two faces of the one death, which consists in the negation of life. Communism eliminates individual life in favour of universal abstractions like society, people, history or social classes. The dogmatism of Marxism is a form of fascism, i.e. a doctrine which originates in the degradation of the individual whose elimination is considered as legitimate, whereas capitalism substitutes economic entities such as money, profit or interest for the real needs of life. Capitalism however recognizes life as a source of value, wages being the objective representation of real subjective and living work. But capitalism progressively gives way to the exclusion of subjectivity by modern technology, which replaces living work by automated technological processes, eliminating at one stroke the power of creating value and ultimately value itself: possessions are produced in abundance, but unemployment increases and there is a continual shortage of money to buy them. These themes are developed in \"Du communisme au capitalisme, théorie d’une catastrophe\" (\"From Communism to Capitalism, Theory of a Catastrophe\").\n\nHenry's planned last book was entitled \"Le Livre des Morts\" (\"The Book of the Dead\") and would have dealt with what he called \"clandestine subjectivity\": a theme which evokes the condition of life in the modern world and which also alludes to his commitment to the Resistance and his personal experience of clandestinity.\n\nMichel Henry was a student of ancient painting and of the great classical painting which preceded the scientistic figuration of the 18th and 19th Centuries, and also of abstract creations such as those of the painter Wassily Kandinsky. Henry dedicated a book entitled \"Voir l’invisible (Seeing the Invisible)\" to Kandinsky, in which he describes his work in laudatory terms. He analyses Kandinsky's theoretical writings on art and painting in their spiritual and cultural dimensions as a means of self-growth and refinement of one's sensibility. He explores painting's means of form and colour, and studies their effects on the inner life of one who looks at them filled with wonder, following the rigorous and almost phenomenological analysis proposed by Kandinsky. He explains that every form of painting capable of moving us is in reality abstract, i.e. it is not content to reproduce the world but seeks to express the invisible power and invisible life that we are. He evokes also the great thought of Kandinsky, the synthesis of arts, their unity in the monumental art as well as the cosmic dimension of art.\n\nIn \"C’est moi la Vérité, pour une philosophie du christianisme\" (\"I am the Truth: Towards a Philosophy of Christianity\"), Michel Henry confronts his phenomenology of life with the foundational texts of Christianity. Life loves itself with an infinite love and never ceases to engender itself; it never ceases to engender each one of us as its beloved Son or Daughter in the eternal present of life. Life is nothing but this absolute love that religion calls God. That is why Life is sacred, and it is for this reason that no-one has the right to assault another or attack another's life. The problem of evil is that of death; that is, of degeneration from the original condition of Son of God, when life turns against itself in hatred or resentment. Because as John says in his first epistle, anyone who does not love remains in death, whereas everyone who loves has been born of God. The commandment of love is not an ethical law, but Life itself.\n\nThis work also proposes a phenomenology of Christ, who is understood as the First Living Being. A living being is simply that which succeeds in the pure revelation of self or self-revelation that is Life. It is in the form of an effective and singular Ipseity that Life never ceases to engender itself. It never ceases to occur in the form of a singular Self that embraces itself, experiences itself and finds joy in itself, and that Michel Henry calls the First Living Being. Or again the Arch-Son, as he himself inhabits the Origin and the Beginning, and is engendered in the very process whereby the Father engenders himself.\n\nMichel Henry tells us in this book that the purpose of the coming of Christ into the world is to make the true Father manifest to people, and thus to save them from the forgetting of Life in which they stand. A forgetting which leads them falsely to believe themselves as being the source of their own powers, their own pleasures and their own feelings, and to live in the terrifying lack of that which however gives each ego to itself. The plenitude of life and the feeling of satisfaction it brings must yield to the great Rift, to the Desire that no object can fulfill, to the Hunger that nothing can satisfy.\n\nAs Henry says in his last book \"Paroles du Christ\" (\"Words of Christ\"), it is in the heart that life speaks, in its immediate pathetic self-revelation; but the heart is blind to the Truth, it is deaf to the word of Life, it is hard and selfish, and it is from this that evil comes. It is in the violence of its silent and implacable self-revelation, which bears witness against this degenerate life and against the evil that comes from it, that Judgement stands — Judgement which is identical to the advent of each Self to itself and from which none can escape.\n\nIn \"Incarnation, une philosophie de la chair\" (\"Incarnation, a Philosophy of the Flesh\"), Henry starts by opposing the sensible and living flesh as we experience it perpetually from the inside to the inert and material body as we can see it from the outside, like other objects we find in the world. The flesh does not correspond at all, in his terminology, to the soft part of our material and objective body as opposed for example to the bones, but to what he called in his earlier books our \"subjective body\". For Henry, an object possesses no interiority, it is not living, it does not feel itself and does not feel that it is touched, it does not subjectively experience being touched.\n\nHaving put the difficult problem of the incarnation in a historical perspective by going back to the thought of the Church Fathers, he undertakes a critical re-reading of the phenomenological tradition that leads to a reversal of phenomenology. He then proposes to elaborate a phenomenology of the flesh which leads to the notion of an originary flesh which is not constituted but is given in the arch-revelation of Life, as well as a phenomenology of Incarnation.\n\nAlthough the flesh is traditionally understood as the seat of sin, in Christianity it is also the place of salvation, which consists in the deification of man, i.e. in the fact of becoming the Son of God, of returning to the eternal and absolute Life we had forgotten in losing ourselves in the world, in caring only about things and ourselves. In sin, we have the tragic experience of our powerlessness to do the good we would like to do and of our inability to avoid evil. Thus, faced with the magical body of the other, it is the anguished desire to rejoin the life in it that leads to error. In the night of lovers, the sexual act couples two impulsive movements, but erotic desire fails to attain the pleasure of the other just there where it is experienced, in a complete loving fusion. The erotic relation is however doubled by a pure affective relation, foreign to the carnal coupling, a relation made of mutual gratitude or love. It is this affective dimension that is denied in the form of violence that is pornography, which wrenches the erotic relation from the pathos of life in order to deliver it to the world, and which constitutes a genuine profanation of life.\n\nMichel Henry undertook a study of the historical and philosophical genesis of psychoanalysis in the light of phenomenology of life in \"Généalogie de la psychanalyse, le commencement perdu\" (\"Genealogy of Psychoanalysis, the Lost Beginning\"), in which he shows that the Freudian notion of the unconscious results from the inability of Freud, its founder, to think the essence of life in its purity as affectivity and auto-affection. The repressed representation does not come from the unconscious, it is simply unformed: the unconscious is only an empty representation, it does not exist—or rather, the real unconscious is life itself in its pathetic reality. And it is not repression that provokes anguish, whose existence depends on the mere fact of power, but unused psychic energy or libido. As for the notion of consciousness, it simply means the power of seeing, it is nothing but a consciousness of the object which leads to an empty subjectivity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

While Kant himself maintained that some concepts, e.g. cause and effect, did not \"arise\" from experience, he took Locke to be suggesting that \"all\" concepts came from experience.\n\nHistorically, Kant presents a caricature of Locke's position, not a completely accurate account of Locke's epistemology. Locke's actual theory of knowledge was more subtle than Kant seems to render it in his \"Critique\". As Guyer/Wood note in their edition of the \"Critique\":Presumably Kant here has in mind Locke's claim that sensation and reflection are the two sources of all our ideas, and is understanding Locke's reflection to be reflection on sensation only. This would be a misunderstanding of Locke, since Locke says that we get simple ideas from reflection on the \"operations of our own Mind,\" a doctrine which is actually a precursor to Kant's view that the laws of our own intuition and thinking furnish the forms of knowledge to be added to the empirical contents furnished by sensation, although of course Locke did not go very far in developing this doctrine; in particular, he did not see that mathematics and logic could be used as sources of information about the operations of the mind.\n\n"}

Save the Bats is aimed at preventing the decline of bat populations. Save the Bats encourages people to take local action to conserve bats, including installing bat houses, planting wildlife gardens, and teaching others about the importance of bats. The campaign has many celebrity, government agency and corporate supporters.\n\nIn addition, OBC and Warner Brothers Entertainment worked together on the set of Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice to re-purpose parts of the movie set into bat houses. Director Zack Snyder contacted OBC when he heard about bats dying off from White-nose Syndrome and enlisted Rob Mies, OBC Executive Director, to assist in the bat house design and construction. More than 150 bat houses were made on the movie set in Pontiac, some of which were painted and signed by Zack, Amy Adams, and Ben Affleck. The bat houses will be auctioned off to support the Save the Bats campaign. Warner Brothers released a short PSA documenting the bat house build featuring Ben Affleck encouraging people to join the campaign. To date, more than 1,000,000 people have viewed the video.\n\nIn August 2017, Organization for Bat Conservation purchased the mineral rights for Magazine Mine, a silica mine in southern Illinois. Magazine Mine is one of the largest Indiana bat hibernacula in the world.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is best known for his writings about technology as it has developed in relation to speed and power, with diverse references to architecture, the arts, the city and the military.\n\nAccording to two geographers, Virilio was a \"historian of warfare, technology and photography, a philosopher of architecture, military strategy and cinema, and a politically engaged provocative commentator on history, terrorism, mass media and human-machine relations.\"\n\nPaul Virilio was born in Paris in 1932 to an Italian communist father and a Catholic Breton mother. He grew up in the northern coastal French region of Brittany. The Second World War made a big impression on him as the city of Nantes fell victim to the German Blitzkrieg, became a port for the German navy and was bombarded by British and American planes. The \"war was his university\". After training at the École des métiers d'art, Virilio specialised in stained-glass artwork, and worked alongside Henri Matisse in churches in Paris. In 1950, he converted to Christianity. After being conscripted into the army during the Algerian war of independence, Virilio attended lectures in phenomenology by Maurice Merleau-Ponty at the Sorbonne.\n\nIn 1958, Virilio conducted a phenomenological inquiry into military space and the organization of territory, particularly concerning the Atlantic Wall—the 15,000 Nazi bunkers built during World War II along the coastline of France and designed to repel any Allied assault. In 1963 he began collaborating with the architect Claude Parent and formed the Architecture Principe group (Among the small group of interns were the architects Francois Seigneur and Jean Nouvel). After participating in the May 1968 uprising in Paris, Virilio was nominated Professor by the students at the École Spéciale d'Architecture. In 1973 he became Director of Studies. In the same year, Virilio became director of the magazine \"L'Espace Critique\". In 1975 he co-organized the Bunker Archéologie exhibition at the Decorative Arts Museum in Paris, a collection of texts and images relating to the Atlantic Wall. Since then he has been widely published, translated and anthologised.\n\nSince 1998, Virilio was teaching intensive seminars at European Graduate School. His last projects involved working with homeless groups in Paris and building the first Museum of the Accident.\n\nVirilio developed what he called the \"war model\" of the modern city and of human society in general and is the inventor of the term 'dromology', meaning the logic of speed that is the foundation of technological society. His major works include \"War and Cinema\", \"Speed and Politics\" and \"The Information Bomb\" in which he argues, among many other things, that military projects and technologies drive history. Like some other cultural theorists, he rejects labels - including 'cultural theorist' - yet he has been linked by others with post-structuralism and postmodernism. Some people describe Virilio's work as being positioned in the realm of the 'hypermodern'. He has repeatedly affirmed his links with phenomenology, for example, and offers humanist critiques of modernist art movements such as Futurism. Throughout his books the political and theological themes of anarchism, pacifism and Catholicism reappear as central influences to his self-proclaimed 'marginal' approach to the question of technology. His work has been compared to that of Marshall McLuhan, Jean Baudrillard, Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, Jean-François Lyotard, Jacques Ellul, and others. Virilio was also an urbanist. After having been a longtime resident of the city of Paris, he moved to La Rochelle.\n\nVirilio's predictions about 'logistics of perception' - the use of images and information in war - (in \"War and Cinema\", 1984) were so accurate that during the Gulf War he was invited to discuss his ideas with French military officers. Virilio argued that it was a 'world war in miniature'.\n\nVirilio believed that technology cannot exist without the potential for accidents. For example, Virilio argued that the invention of the locomotive also contained the invention of derailment. He saw the Accident as a rather negative growth of social positivism and scientific progress. He believed the growth of technology, namely television, separates us directly from the events of real space and real time. In it he suggested we lose wisdom and sight of our immediate horizon and resort to the indirect horizon of our dissimulated environment. From this angle, the Accident can be mentally pictured as a sort of \"fractal meteorite\" whose impact is prepared in the propitious darkness, a landscape of events concealing future collisions. Aristotle claimed that \"there is no science of the accident\", but Virilio disagreed, pointing to the growing credibility of simulators designed to escape the accident— which he argued is an industry that is born from the unholy marriage of post-WW2 science and the military-industrial complex.\n\n\"Dromos\" is an Ancient Greek noun for race or racetrack, which Virilio applied the activity of racing (Virilio 1977:47). It is with this meaning in mind that he coined the term 'dromology', which he defined as the \"science (or logic) of speed“. Dromology is important when considering the structuring of society in relation to warfare and modern media. He noted that the speed at which something happens may change its essential nature, and that which moves with speed quickly comes to dominate that which is slower. 'Whoever controls the territory possesses it. Possession of territory is not primarily about laws and contracts, but first and foremost a matter of movement and circulation.' \n\nIn contemporary warfare, logistics does not just imply the movement of personnel, tanks, fuel and so on, but also the movement of images both to and from the battlefield. Virilio talked a lot about the creation of CNN and the concept of the newshound. The newshound will capture images which will then be sent to CNN, which may then be broadcast to the public. This movement of images can start a conflict (Virilio uses the example of the events following the broadcasting of the Rodney King footage). The logistics of perception relates also to the televising of military maneuvers and the images of conflict that are watched not only by people at home, but also by the military personnel involved in the conflict. The 'field of battle' also exists as a 'field of perception'.\n\nFor Virilio, the transition from feudalism to capitalism was driven not primarily by the politics of wealth and production techniques but by the mechanics of war. Virilio argued that the traditional feudal fortified city disappeared because of the increasing sophistication of weapons and possibilities for warfare. For Virilio, the concept of siege warfare became rather a war of movement. In \"Speed and Politics\", he argues that 'history progresses at the speed of its weapons systems'.\n\nVirilio was one of the many cultural theorists (and other postmodernists) criticized by physicists Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont in 1997 for what they characterize as misunderstanding and misuse of science and mathematics. Virilio's works are the subject of chapter 10 of Fashionable Nonsense. Their criticism consists of a series of quotes (often long) from Virilio's works, and then explanations of how Vilirio confuses basic physics concepts and abuses scientific terminology, to the point of absurdity. In the authors' words:\n\nA criticism of a passage often reads something like this:\n\nThey end their chapter with a long quote followed by this comment:\n\nA book-length cricism of Virilio’s work to 2004 was written by Steve Redhead. He observed:\nHe also notes that Virilio does not pass the grade in academic studies:\nHowever, for Law and Popular Culture, Redhead concedes Virilio as a factor:\n\nIn 2014 an analyst of security, technology and global politics noted:\nHe credits Virilio with balancing the propaganda of progress against the management of fear at some cost:\n\nBoth the speed of light and globalization figure in Virilio's writing. At one point he wrote:\nVirilio is also quoted as saying,\n\n\n\n"}

Activities like these, which can be restricted in vehicles, stations, and other property of the agency, are prohibited for a variety of reasons. These include keeping other passengers safe and comfortable, protecting the operator, or protecting the vehicles and stations.\n\nPenalties for violations can vary. They can include fines, arrest, prosecution, or removal from the service.\n\nMany local public transport services, such as municipal bus or rapid transit systems (one notable exception being the New York City Subway), prohibit passengers from consuming food or beverages or carrying open food or beverage containers while on board a vehicle or in a station.\n\nGenerally, services providing longer forms of transportation, such as regional rail or intercity buses, will allow at least some eating and drinking. But some services, like Megabus, prohibit eating and drinking.\n\nIn emergency cases these prohibitions may be waived. The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority has a strict ban on consumption of food or drink in the paid area of train stations, on trains or buses, or on elevators or escalators used to enter or exit stations, in order to reduce attractiveness to insects and vermin. Fines of $100 can be imposed, except the Authority has lifted the ban with respect to consumption of water during heat emergencies.\n\nA survey of SEPTA riders found that 48% of riders eat while on board their services either regularly or some of the time.\n\nSmoking is one of the most common prohibitions on board a public transport vehicle. Since second-hand smoke can be hazardous to one's health, smoking is prohibited in most public places worldwide, including public transport.\n\nNote that as of 2016, the prohibition on smoking only applies to cigarettes which burn something that generates smoke (e.g. tobacco or marijuana), although some localities want to ban public smoking of electronic cigarettes.\n\nIn 1975, a federal law was passed in the United States banning smoking in all public transport vehicles.\n\nSome intercity bus services will stop to offer smoke breaks to riders.\n\nMost systems prohibit the use of audio-producing devices, such as radios, CD players, MP3 players, musical instruments, or other similar gadgets without an earphone through which only the listener can hear.\n\nSome public transport systems prohibit or limit the use of mobile phones while on board.\n\nSome rail systems have \"quiet cars\" where passengers are not permitted to engage in conversations and where cell phones cannot be used.\n\nIn some places, it is unlawful to photograph or film a public transport vehicle or station or the operation of a public transportation service.\n\nAnti-photography laws (or rules) are in place for various reasons, including the privacy of passengers and crew and concerns over terrorism. However, these measures have caused problems for enthusiasts whose hobby is to ride and photograph transport. In some cities, the rules have been abandoned or modified. In other places, the authorities regard enthusiasts as their supporters and encourage their activities so long as they are carried out in a lawful manner from places open to the general public.\n\nIn the United States, it is generally legal to take photographs in public, and absent special and extraordinary conditions, a law prohibiting photography in public areas of a transit vehicle or area operated by a transit authority, or a transit authority prohibition on photography under such conditions likely would not withstand judicial scrutiny, and the courts probably would not uphold such bans.\n\nMany systems have anti-solicitation laws or guidelines. These include prohibitions against:\n\nSome services have guidelines regarding the amount of space a passenger can take up whether with one's body or belongings.\n\nIn some transit systems, including the New York City Subway, it is unlawful to place one's belongings on another seat, even when vacant; however, in the New York City Subway, this rule is flouted all the time.\n\nPrivately run intercity bus services usually have limits for carry-on and checked luggage, similar to the baggage allowance system on airplanes.\n\nSome transit systems have a seating precedence rule for passengers who pay adult fare against discounted passengers, i.e. discounted and free-pass holders may not sit unless all adults paying full-fare sit.\n\nWhile any crime committed on a public transport system would generally be treated like one committed elsewhere, there are some acts for which the prohibitions are emphasized in guidelines on posted signs.\n\n\n\n\nGenerally, firearms, in countries where they are otherwise allowed to be carried by civilians, are not permitted on board public transport vehicles. Exceptions can be made for law enforcement or military personnel or others with a carrying permit.\n\nMany systems prohibit explosives and flammable liquids that pose threat to the safety of others.\n\nMany places prohibit live animals from being brought on board public transport vehicles. Exceptions are sometimes made for animals kept within a container from which they cannot escape or service animals for those with disabilities.\n\nOn most rail systems, bicycles are allowed, but may be restricted. On buses, there are more such limitations.\n\nMany buses now have external bike racks where riders can attach their bikes.\n\nSometimes, bikes are only allowed on buses if there is enough free space.\n\n"}

Hood notes that Stace's work is a conceptual approach, based on textual studies. He posits his own work as a parallel approach, based on an empirical approach, thereby placing the conceptual claims in an empirical framework, assuming that Stace is correct in his approach.\n\nJacob van Belzen criticized Hood, noting that Hood validated the existence of a common core in mystical experiences, but based on a conceptual framework which presupposes the existence of such a common core: \nBelzen also notes that religion does not stand on its own, but is embedded in a cultural context, which should be taken into account. To this criticism Hood et al. answer that universalistic tendencies in religious research \"are rooted first in inductive generalizations from cross-cultural consideration of either faith or mysticism,\" stating that Stace sought out texts which he recognized as an expression of mystical expression, from which he created his universal core.

{"id": "188937", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=188937", "title": "Richard Bentley", "text": "Richard Bentley\n\nRichard Bentley (; 27 January 1662 – 14 July 1742) was an English classical scholar, critic, and theologian. He was Master of Trinity College, Cambridge.\n\nBentley was the first Englishman to be ranked with the great heroes of classical learning and was known for his literary and textual criticism. Called the \"founder of historical philology\", Bentley is credited with the creation of the English school of Hellenism, and introduced the first competitive written examinations in a Western university.\n\nBentley was born at Oulton near Rothwell, Leeds, West Yorkshire, in northern England. A blue plaque near his birthplace commemorates the fact. His father was Thomas Bentley of Oulton. His grandfather, Captain James Bentley, had suffered for the Royalist cause following the English Civil War, leaving the family in reduced circumstances. Bentley's mother, the daughter of a stonemason, had some education, and was able to give her son his first lessons in Latin.\n\nAfter attending grammar school in Wakefield, Bentley was an undergraduate at St John's College, Cambridge, in 1676. He afterwards obtained a scholarship and took the degree of B.A. in 1680 (M.A. 1683).\n\nHe never became a Fellow, but was appointed to be the headmaster of Spalding Grammar School before he was 21. Edward Stillingfleet, dean of St Paul's, hired Bentley as tutor to his son, which enabled the younger man to meet eminent scholars, have access to the best private library in England, and become familiar with Dean Stillingfleet. During his six years as tutor, Bentley also made a comprehensive study of Greek and Latin writers, storing up knowledge which he used later.\n\nIn 1689, Stillingfleet became bishop of Worcester, and Bentley's pupil went to Wadham College, Oxford, accompanied by his tutor. Bentley soon met Dr John Mill, Humphrey Hody, and Edward Bernard. Here he studied the manuscripts of the Bodleian, Corpus Christi and other college libraries. He collected material for literary studies. Among these are a corpus of the fragments of the Greek poets and an edition of the Greek lexicographers.\n\nThe Oxford (Sheldonian) press was about to bring out an edition (the \"editio princeps\") from the unique manuscript of the \"Greek Chronicle\" in the Bodleian Library. It was a universal history (down to AD 560) of John of Antioch (date uncertain, between 600 and 1000), called John Malalas or \"John the Rhetor\". The editor, Dr John Mill, principal of St Edmund Hall, asked Bentley to review it and make any remarks on the text.\n\nBentley wrote the \"Epistola ad Johannem Millium\", which is about 100 pages included at the end of the \"Oxford Malalas\" (1691). This short treatise placed Bentley ahead of all living English scholars. The ease with which he restored corrupted passages, the certainty of his emendation and command over the relevant material, are in a style totally different from the careful and laborious learning of Hody, Mill or Edmund Chilmead. To the small circle of classical students (lacking the great critical dictionaries of modern times), it was obvious that he was a critic beyond the ordinary.\nIn 1690, Bentley had taken deacon's orders. In 1692 he was nominated first Boyle lecturer, a nomination repeated in 1694. He was offered the appointment a third time in 1695 but declined it, as he was involved in too many other activities. In the first series of lectures (\"A Confutation of Atheism\"), he endeavours to present Newtonian physics in a popular form, and to frame them (especially in opposition to Hobbes) into proof of the existence of an intelligent Creator. He had some correspondence with Newton, then living in Trinity College, Cambridge, on the subject. The second series, preached in 1694, has not been published and is believed to be lost.\n\nAfter being ordained, Bentley was promoted to a prebendal stall in Worcester Cathedral. In 1693 the curator of the royal library became vacant, and his friends tried to obtain the position for Bentley, but did not have enough influence. The new librarian, a Mr Thynne, resigned in favour of Bentley, on condition that he receive an annuity of £130 for life out of the £200 salary. In 1695 Bentley received a royal chaplaincy and the living of Hartlebury.\n\nThat same year, he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1696 earned the degree of D.D. (Doctor of Divinity). The scholar Johann Georg Graevius of Utrecht made a dedication to him, prefixed to a dissertation on Albert Rubens, \"De Vita Fl. Mallii Theodori\" (1694).\n\nBentley had official apartments in St. James's Palace, and his first care was the royal library. He worked to restore the collection from a dilapidated condition. He persuaded the Earl of Marlborough to ask for additional rooms in the palace for the books. This was granted, but Marlborough kept them for personal use. Bentley enforced the law, ensuring that publishers delivered nearly 1000 volumes which had been purchased but not delivered.\n\nThe University of Cambridge commissioned him to obtain Greek and Latin fonts for their classical books; he had these made in Holland. He assisted John Evelyn in his \"Numismata\". Bentley did not settle down to the steady execution of any of the major projects he had started. In 1694, he designed an edition of Philostratus, but abandoned it to Gottfried Olearius (1672–1715), \"to the joy,\" says F. A. Wolf, \"of Olearius and of no one else.\" He supplied Graevius with collations of Cicero, and Joshua Barnes with a warning as to the spuriousness of the \"Epistles\" of Euripides. Barnes printed the epistles anyway and declared that no one could doubt their authenticity but a man \"perfrictae frontis aut judicii imminuti\". For Graevius's \"Callimachus\" (1697), Bentley added a collection of the fragments with notes.\n\nHe wrote the \"Dissertation on the Epistles of Phalaris\" (1699), his major academic work, almost accidentally. In 1697, William Wotton, about to bring out a second edition of his \"Ancient and Modern Learning\", asked Bentley to write out a paper exposing the spuriousness of the \"Epistles\" of Phalaris, long a subject of academic controversy. The Christ Church editor of Phalaris, Charles Boyle, resented Bentley's paper. He had already quarrelled with Bentley in trying to get the manuscript in the royal library collated for his edition (1695). Boyle wrote a response which was accepted by the reading public, although it was much later criticised as showing superficial learning. The demand for Boyle's book required a second printing. When Bentley responded, it was with his dissertation. The truth of its conclusions was not immediately recognised, but it has a high reputation.\n\nIn 1700, the commissioners of ecclesiastical patronage recommended Bentley to the Crown for the mastership of Trinity College, Cambridge. He arrived an outsider and proceeded to reform the college administration. He started a programme of renovations to the buildings, and used his position to promote learning. He is also credited by the British mathematician Rouse Ball with starting the first written examinations in the West in 1702, all those prior to this being oral in nature. At the same time, he antagonised the fellows, and the capital programme caused reductions in their incomes, which they resented.\n\nAfter ten years of stubborn but ineffectual resistance, the fellows appealed to the Visitor, the bishop of Ely (John Moore). Their petition was full of general complaints. Bentley's reply (\"The Present State of Trinity College\", etc., 1710) is in his most crushing style. The fellows amended their petition and added a charge of Bentley's having committed 54 breaches of the statutes. Bentley appealed directly to the Crown, and backed his application with a dedication of his \"Horace\" to the lord treasurer (Harley).\n\nThe Crown lawyers decided against him; the case was heard (1714) and a sentence of expulsion from the mastership was drawn up. Before it was executed, the bishop of Ely died and the process lapsed. The feud continued in various forms at lower levels. In 1718 Cambridge rescinded Bentley's degrees, as punishment for failing to appear in the vice-chancellor's court in a civil suit. It was not until 1724 that he had them restored under the law.\n\nIn 1733 the fellows of Trinity again brought Bentley to trial before the bishop of Ely (then Thomas Greene), and he was sentenced to deprivation. The college statutes required the sentence to be exercised by the vice-master Richard Walker, who was a friend of Bentley and refused to act. Although the feud continued until 1738 or 1740 (about thirty years in all), Bentley remained in his post.\n\nDuring his mastership, except for the first two years, Bentley continuously pursued his studies, although he did not publish much. In 1709 he contributed a critical appendix to John Davies's edition of Cicero's \"Tusculan Disputations\". In the following year, he published his emendations on the \"Plutus\" and \"Nubes\" of Aristophanes, and on the fragments of Menander and Philemon. He published the last work under the pen name of \"Phileleutherus Lipsiensis.\" He used it again two years later in his \"Remarks on a late Discourse of Freethinking\", a reply to Anthony Collins the deist. The university thanked him for this work and its support of the Anglican Church and clergy.\n\nAlthough he had long studied Horace, Bentley wrote his version quickly in the end, publishing it in 1711 to gain public support at a critical period of the Trinity quarrel. In the preface, he declared his intention of confining his attention to criticism and correction of the text. Some of his 700 or 800 emendations have been accepted, but the majority were rejected by the early 20th century as unnecessary, although scholars acknowledged they showed his wide learning.\n\nIn 1716, in a letter to William Wake, Archbishop of Canterbury, Bentley announced his plan to prepare a critical edition of the New Testament. During the next four years, assisted by J. J. Wetstein, an eminent biblical critic, he collected materials for the work. In 1720 he published \"Proposals for a New Edition of the Greek Testament\", with examples of how he intended to proceed. By comparing the text of the Vulgate with that of the oldest Greek manuscripts, Bentley proposed to restore the Greek text as received by the church at the time of the Council of Nicaea. Bentley's lead manuscript was \"Codex Alexandrinus\", which he described as \"the oldest and best in the world\". Bentley used also manuscripts: 51, 54, 60, 113, 440, 507, and 508. John Walker worked over many manuscripts for the project, particularly in Paris with the help of the Maurists. Numerous subscribers were obtained to support publication of the work, but he never completed it.\n\nHis \"Terence\" (1726) is more important than his \"Horace\"; next to the \"Phalaris\", this most determined his reputation. In 1726 he also published the \"Fables\" of Phaedrus and the \"Sententiae\" of Publilius Syrus.\n\nHis \"Paradise Lost\" (1732), suggested by Queen Caroline, has been criticised as the weakest of his work. He suggested that the poet John Milton had employed both an amanuensis and an editor, who were responsible for clerical errors and interpolations, but it is unclear whether Bentley believed his own position. A. E. Housman, who called him \"the greatest scholar that England or perhaps that Europe ever bred\" nevertheless criticised his poetic sensibility severely: \"...we are not all so easily found out as Bentley, because we have not Bentley's intrepid candour. There is a sort of savage nobility about his firm reliance on his own bad taste...\".\n\nBentley never published his planned edition of Homer, but some of his manuscript and marginal notes are held by Trinity College. Their chief importance is in his attempt to restore the metre by the insertion of the lost \"digamma\".\n\nAccording to the anonymous author of his biography in the Encyclopaedia Britannica Eleventh Edition Bentley was self-assertive and presumptuous, which alienated some people. But, James Henry Monk, Bentley's biographer, charged him (in his first edition, 1830) with an indecorum of which he was not guilty. Bentley seemed to inspire mixed feelings of admiration and repugnance.\n\nIn 1701, Bentley married Joanna (died 1740), daughter of Sir John Bernard, 2nd Baronet of Brampton, Huntingdonshire. They had three children together:\n\nHis daughter Johanna Bentley married Denison Cumberland in 1728, a grandson of Richard Cumberland the bishop of Peterborough, and himself later a bishop of the Church of Ireland.Their son Richard Cumberland developed as a prolific dramatist, while earning his living as a civil servant.\n\nIn old age, Bentley continued to read; and enjoyed the society of his friends and several rising scholars, J Markland, John Taylor, and his nephews Richard and Thomas Bentley, with whom he discussed classical subjects. He died on the 14 July 1742 of pleurisy.\n\n\nAccording to the anonymous author of his biography in the Encyclopaedia Britannica Eleventh Edition Bentley was the first Englishman to be ranked with the great heroes of classical learning. Before him there were only John Selden, and, in a more restricted field, Thomas Gataker and John Pearson.\nThe modern German school of philology recognised his genius. Bunsen wrote that Bentley \"was the founder of historical philology.\" Jakob Bernays says of his corrections of the \"Tristia\", \"corruptions which had hitherto defied every attempt even of the mightiest, were removed by a touch of the fingers of this British Samson\".\n\nBentley was credited with creating the English school of Hellenists, by which the 18th century was distinguished, including scholars such as R Dawes, J Markland, John Taylor, Jonathan Toup, T Tyrwhitt, Richard Porson, Peter Paul Dobree, Thomas Kidd and James Henry Monk. Although the Dutch school of the period had its own tradition, it was also influenced by Bentley. His letters to Tiberius Hemsterhuis on his edition of Julius Pollux made the latter one of Bentley's most devoted admirers.\n\nBentley inspired a following generation of scholars. Self-taught, he created his own discipline; but no contemporary English guild of learning could measure his power or check his eccentricities. He defeated his academic adversaries in the Phalaris controversy. The attacks by Alexander Pope (he was assigned a niche in \"The Dunciad\"), John Arbuthnot and others demonstrated their inability to appreciate his work, as they considered textual criticism as pedantry. His classical controversies also called forth Jonathan Swift's \"Battle of the Books\".\n\nIn a university where the instruction of youth or the religious controversy of the day was the chief occupation, Bentley was unique. His learning and original views seem to have been developed before 1700. After this period, he acquired little and made only spasmodic efforts to publish. However A.E.Housman believed that the edition of Manilius (1739) was Bentley's greatest work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttribution:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2616121", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2616121", "title": "Right-wing authoritarianism", "text": "Right-wing authoritarianism\n\nRight-wing authoritarianism (RWA) is a personality and ideological variable studied in political, social and personality psychology. Right-wing authoritarians are people who have a high degree of willingness to submit to authorities they perceive as established and legitimate, who adhere to societal conventions and norms and who are hostile and punitive in their attitudes towards people who do not adhere to them. They value uniformity and are in favour of using group authority, including coercion, to achieve it.\n\nThe concept of right-wing authoritarianism was introduced in 1981 by Canadian-American psychologist Bob Altemeyer as a refinement of the authoritarian personality theory originally pioneered by University of California, Berkeley researchers Theodor W. Adorno, Else Frenkel-Brunswik, Daniel Levinson and Nevitt Sanford. After extensive questionnaire research and statistical analysis, Altemeyer found that only three of the original nine hypothesized components of the model correlated together: authoritarian submission, authoritarian aggression and conventionalism. Researchers have traditionally assumed that there was just one kind of authoritarian personality, who could be either a follower or a leader. The discovery that followers and leaders are usually different types of authoritarians is based on research done by Sam McFarland.\n\nRight-wing authoritarianism is measured by the RWA scale, which uses a Likert scale response. The first scored item on the scale states: \"Our country desperately needs a mighty leader who will do what has to be done to destroy the radical new ways and sinfulness that are ruining us\". People who strongly agree with this are showing a tendency toward authoritarian submission (\"Our country desperately needs a mighty leader\"), authoritarian aggression (\"who will do what has to be done to destroy\") and conventionalism (\"the radical new ways and sinfulness that are ruining us\").\nPsychometrically, the RWA scale was a significant improvement over the F-scale, which was the original measure of the authoritarian personality. The F-scale was worded so that agreement always indicated an authoritarian response, thus leaving it susceptible to the acquiescence response bias. The RWA scale is balanced to have an equal number of pro and anti authoritarian statements. The RWA scale also has excellent internal reliability, with coefficient alpha typically measuring between 0.85 and 0.94.\n\nThe RWA scale has been modified over the years, as many of the items lost their social significance as society changed and the current version is 22 items long.\n\nAlthough Altemeyer has continually updated the scale, researchers in different domains have tended to lock-in on particular versions. For example, in the social psychology of religion the 1992 version of the scale is still commonly used. In addition, the length of the earlier versions (30 items) led many researchers to develop shorter versions of the scale. Some of those are published, but many researchers simply select a subset of items to use in their research, a practice that Altemeyer strongly criticizes.\n\nThe uni-dimensionality of the scale has also been challenged recently. For example, Funke showed that it is possible to extract the three underlying dimensions of RWA if the double- and triple-barreled nature of the items is removed. Given the possibility of underlying dimensions emerging from the scale, it is then the case that the scale is no longer balanced, since all the items primarily capturing authoritarian aggression are pro-trait worded (higher scores mean more authoritarianism) and all the items primarily measuring conventionalism are con-trait worded (higher scores mean less authoritarianism). Work by Mavor, Louis and Sibley recently demonstrated that the existence of 2 or 3 factors in the RWA scale reflects real differences in these dimensions rather than acquiescence response bias.\n\nRight-wing authoritarians want society and social interactions structured in ways that increase uniformity and minimize diversity. In order to achieve that, they tend to be in favour of social control, coercion and the use of group authority to place constraints on the behaviours of people such as political dissidents and ethnic minorities. These constraints might include restrictions on immigration, limits on free speech and association and laws regulating moral behaviour. It is the willingness to support or take action that leads to increased social uniformity that makes right-wing authoritarianism more than just a personal distaste for difference. Right-wing authoritarianism is characterized by obedience to authority, moral absolutism, racial and ethnic prejudice and intolerance and punitiveness towards dissidents and deviants. In parenting, right-wing authoritarians value children's obedience, neatness and good manners.\n\nDuckitt & Bizumic (2013) write that RWA measures the support \"for the subordination of individual freedom and autonomy to the collective and its authority\". Their studies show that it can be split into three distinct factors:\n\nThe names of these three components of RWA resemble their standard use but actually correspond, instead, to the three statistical factors.\n\nRight-wing authoritarianism was previously split differently into three attitudinal and behavioral clusters which correlate together:\n\nThe terminology of \"authoritarianism\", \"right-wing authoritarianism\" and \"authoritarian personality\" tend to be used interchangeably by psychologists, though inclusion of the term \"personality\" may indicate a psychodynamic interpretation consistent with the original formulation of the theory.\n\nThe phrase \"right-wing\" in right-wing authoritarianism does not necessarily refer to someone's politics, but to psychological preferences and personality. It means that the person tends to follow the established conventions and authorities in society. In theory, the authorities could have either right-wing or left-wing political views.\n\nMilton Rokeach's dogmatism scale was an early attempt to measure pure authoritarianism, whether left or right. The scale was carefully designed to measure closed-mindedness without regard to ideology. Nevertheless, researchers found that it correlated with British political conservativism. In a similar line of research, Philip Tetlock found that right wing beliefs are associated with less integrative complexity than left wing beliefs. People with moderate liberal attitudes had the highest integrative complexity in their cognitions.\n\nThere have been a number of other attempts to identify \"left-wing authoritarians\" in the United States and Canada. These would be people who submit to leftist authorities, are highly conventional to liberal viewpoints and are aggressive to people who oppose left-wing ideology. These attempts have failed because measures of authoritarianism always correlate at least slightly with the right. However, left-wing authoritarians were found in Eastern Europe. There are certainly extremists across the political spectrum, but most psychologists now believe that authoritarianism is a predominantly right-wing phenomenon.\n\nAlthough authoritarians in North America generally support conservative political parties, this finding must be considered in a historical and cultural context. For example, during the Cold War authoritarians in the United States were usually anti-communist, whereas in the Soviet Union authoritarians generally supported the Communist Party and were opposed to capitalism. Authoritarians thus generally favor the established ways and oppose social and political change, hence even politics usually labeled as right or left-wing is not descriptive. While communism in the Soviet Union is seen as leftist, it still inspired the same responses. Furthermore, recent research indicates that political progressives can exhibit the qualities of authoritarianism when they are asked about conservative Christians. This leaves questions over what makes various ideologies left or right open to interpretation. A 2017 study found evidence that was suggestive of the existence of left-wing authoritarians.\n\nAccording to Karen Stenner, an Australian professor who specializes in authoritarianism, says it is different from conservatism because authoritarianism reflects aversion to difference across space (i.e. diversity of people and beliefs at any given moment), while conservatism reflects aversion to difference over time (i.e. change). Stenner argues that conservatives will embrace racial diversity, civil liberties and moral freedom to the extent they are already institutionalized authoritatively-supported traditions and are therefore supportive of social stability. Conservatives tend to be drawn to authoritarianism when public opinion is fractious and there is a loss of confidence in public institutions, but in general they value stability and certainty over increased uniformity. However, Stenner says that authoritarians also want difference restricted even when so doing would require significant social change and instability.\n\nAccording to research by Altemeyer, right-wing authoritarians tend to exhibit cognitive errors and symptoms of faulty reasoning. Specifically, they are more likely to make incorrect inferences from evidence and to hold contradictory ideas that result from compartmentalized thinking. They are also more likely to uncritically accept insufficient evidence that supports their beliefs and they are less likely to acknowledge their own limitations. Whether right-wing authoritarians are less intelligent than average is disputed, with Stenner arguing that variables such as high verbal ability (indicative of high cognitive capacity) have a very substantial ameliorative effect in diminishing authoritarian tendencies. Measured against other factors of personality, authoritarians generally score lower on openness to experience and slightly higher on conscientiousness.\n\nAltemeyer suggested that authoritarian politicians are more likely to be in the Conservative or Reform party in Canada, or the Republican Party in the United States. They generally have a conservative economic philosophy, are highly nationalistic, oppose abortion, support capital punishment, oppose gun control legislation and do not value social equality. The RWA scale reliably correlates with political party affiliation, reactions to Watergate, pro-capitalist attitudes, religious orthodoxy and acceptance of covert governmental activities such as illegal wiretaps. Although authoritarianism is correlated with conservative political ideology, not all authoritarians are conservative and not all conservatives are authoritarian. It is also worth noting that many authoritarians have no interest in politics.\n\nAuthoritarians are generally more favorable to punishment and control than personal freedom and diversity. For example, they are more willing to suspend constitutional guarantees of liberty such as the Bill of Rights. They are more likely to advocate strict, punitive sentences for criminals and report that punishing such people is satisfying for them. They tend to be ethnocentric and prejudiced against racial and ethnic minorities and homosexuals. However, Stenner argues that authoritarians will support programs intended to increase opportunities for minority groups, such as affirmative action, if they believe such programs will lead to greater societal uniformity.\n\nIn roleplaying situations, authoritarians tend to seek dominance over others by being competitive and destructive instead of cooperative. In a study by Altemeyer, 68 authoritarians played a three-hour simulation of the Earth's future entitled the Global Change Game. Unlike a comparison game played by individuals with low RWA scores, which resulted in world peace and widespread international cooperation, the simulation by authoritarians became highly militarized and eventually entered the stage of nuclear war. By the end of the high RWA game, the entire population of the earth was declared dead.\n\nThe vast majority of research on right-wing authoritarianism has been done in the United States and Canada. However, a 2003 cross-cultural study examined the relation between authoritarianism and individualism-collectivism in samples (1,080) from Bulgaria, Canada, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, Poland and the United States. Both at the individual level and the societal level, authoritarianism was correlated with vertical individualism (or dominance seeking) and vertical or hierarchical collectivism, which is the tendency to submit to the demands of one's ingroup. A study done on both Israeli and Palestinian students in Israel found that RWA scores of right-wing party supporters were significantly higher than those of left-wing party supporters and scores of secular subjects were lowest.\n\nRight-wing authoritarianism has been found to correlate only slightly with Social Dominance Orientation (SDO). The two measures can be thought of as two sides of the same coin: RWA provides submissive followers and SDO provides power-seeking leaders.\n\nResearch comparing RWA with the Big Five personality traits has found that RWA is positively correlated with conscientiousness (r = 0.15) and negatively correlated with openness to experience (r = −0.36). SDO has a somewhat different pattern of correlations with the Big Five, as it is also associated with low openness to experience (r = −0.16), but is not significantly correlated with conscientiousness (r = −0.05) and instead has a negative correlation with agreeableness (r = −0.29). Low openness to experience and high conscientiousness have been found to be predictive of social conformity. People low in openness to experience tend to prefer clear, unambiguous moral rules and are more likely to support the existing social order insofar as it provides clear guidance about social norms for behavior and how the world should be. People low in openness to experience are also more sensitive to threats (both real and symbolic) to the social order and hence tend to view outgroups who deviate from traditional social norms and values as a threat to ingroup norms and values. Conscientiousness is associated with a preference for order, structure and security, hence this might explain the connection with RWA.\n\nA recent refinement to this body of research was presented in Karen Stenner's 2005 book, \"The Authoritarian Dynamic\". Stenner argues that RWA is best understood as expressing a dynamic response to external threat, not a static disposition based only on the traits of submission, aggression and conventionalism. Stenner is critical of Altemeyer's social learning interpretation and argues that it cannot account for how levels of authoritarianism fluctuate with social conditions. She argues that the RWA Scale can be viewed as a measure of expressed authoritarianism, but that other measures are needed to assess authoritarian predispositions which interact with threatening circumstances to produce the authoritarian response.\n\nRecent criticism has also come as a result of treating RWA as uni-dimensional even in contexts where it makes no sense to do so. For example, RWA has been used in regression analyses with fundamentalism as another predictor and attitudes to homosexuality and racism as the outcomes. For example, this research seemed to show that fundamentalism would be associated with reduced racism once the authoritarian component was removed and this was summarized in a recent review of the field. However, since the RWA Scale has items that also measure fundamentalist religiosity and attitudes to homosexuality, this undermines the interpretation of such analyses. Even worse is the possibility that the unrecognised dimensionality in RWA can cause a statistical artifact to arise in such regressions, which can reduce or even reverse some of the relationships. Mavor and colleagues have argued that this artifact eliminates or even reverses any apparent tendency for fundamentalism to reduce racism once RWA is controlled. The implication is that in some domains such as the social psychology of religion it is not only preferable to think of RWA as consisting of at least two components, but essential in order to avoid statistical errors and incorrect conclusions. Several options currently exist for scales that acknowledge at least the two main underlying components in the scale (aggression/submission and conventionalism).\n\nAltemeyer's research on authoritarianism has been challenged by psychologist John J. Ray, who questions the sampling methods used and the ability of the RWA Scale to predict authoritarian behavior and provides evidence that the RWA Scale measures conservatism rather than \"directiveness\", a construct that John J. Ray invented and that he relates to authoritarianism. However, Ray's approach is a minority position among researchers and other psychologists have found that both the RWA Scale and the original F-Scale are good predictors of both attitudes and behavior.\n\nIn 2012, the American \"Journal of Political Science\" published an article discussing the correlation between conservatism and psychoticism, which they associated with authoritarianism, among other traits. In 2015, they released an erratum showing that psychoticism is actually more associated with liberalism, whereas neuroticism is more associated with conservatism.\n\nIn 2017, the new regality theory suggested a reinterpretation of RWA in the light of evolutionary psychology. Regality theory agrees that authoritarianism is a dynamic response to external threat, and more specifically to collective danger. But rather than seeing authoritarianism as a psychological aberration, regality theory sees it as an evolved response to perceived collective danger. The tendency to support a strong leader in times of collective danger has contributed to Darwinian fitness in human prehistory because it helped solve the collective action problem in war and suppress free riders. It is argued that regality theory adds a deeper level of analysis to our understanding of authoritarianism and avoids the political bias that the research in the authoritarian personality and RWA is often criticized for.\n\n\n\n"}

Alves was one of the founders of liberation theology.\n\nAlves was born on September 15, 1933, in Boa Esperança, Minas Gerais, Brazil. He obtained his Bachelor of Theology (BTh) degree at the Presbyterian Seminary in Campinas, Brazil, in 1957. He went on to obtain a Master of Theology (ThM) from the Union Theological Seminary in New York City, United States, in 1964. After completing this degree, Alves returned to Brazil amidst a US-sponsored military coup against the democratically elected Brazilian government. At the time, the new military regime was attempting to purge Brazil of communist sympathizers. The Presbyterian Church of Brazil provided the new government with the names of six intellectuals to serve as scapegoats and to avert persecution themselves. Immediately upon his return to Brazil, Alves went into hiding. More than forty accusations were made against Alves and others, including claims that they taught that Jesus was sexually involved with a prostitute, celebrated when their children denounced Americans, and were funded by the Soviet Union. Alves reports that these accusations were ineffective, saying, \"the positive side of the document was that it was so virulent, that not even the most obtuse could believe that we were guilty of so many crimes.\" Alves continued to elude government authorities. Within two months of his arrival in Brazil, he returned to the United States covertly with assistance from Brazilian Freemasons and the Presbyterian Church in the United States, which secured an invitation from Princeton Theological Seminary for him to commence doctoral studies there.\n\nAlves did not enjoy his studies at Princeton. He sorely missed his homeland, and felt constrained by the requirements of the doctoral program. Although he ultimately wrote his dissertation according to the requirements of his professors, Alves was not pleased with it, saying, \"I wrote uglily, without smiles or poetry, for there was no other alternative: a Brazilian student, underdeveloped, in a foreign institution, must indeed submit himself, if he wants to pass.\" He completed his doctoral dissertation, \"Toward a Theology of Liberation\", in 1968, and received \"the lowest possible grade\" needed to receive his doctorate (PhD) at Princeton in 1968.\n\nAlves later critiqued the direction some writers took liberation theology, saying \"it has little to say about the personal dimension of life. If a father or mother comes with their dead child, it's no consolation to say, 'In the future just society there will be no more deaths of this kind.' This brings no comfort!\" However, he also described liberation theology as \"absolutely essential\", describing his own version of liberation theology with these words: \"The origin of my liberation theology is an erotic exuberance for life. We need to struggle to restore its erotic exuberance, to share this with the whole world.\"\n\n\nBesides his activities as a university professor and researcher, Alves was a prolific writer of books and articles in journals and newspapers on education, psychology and life in general. From 1986 he was a regular columnist in \"Correio Popular\", the main newspaper in his hometown, Campinas, in São Paulo state. He published more than 40 books, several of which have been translated into German, French, English, Italian, Spanish and Romanian. \n\nDuring his career he collaborated with notable personalities, including Peter Maurin, Dorothy Day, and Paulo Freire.\n\nHis book, \"The Poet, The Warrior, The Prophet\", is an important text in the field of theopoetics.\n\nDuring the last years of his life, Alves wrote several children's books. Alves died on July 19, 2014, in Campinas, Brazil.\n\nAlves has been described as an \"unsung hero\", and is often omitted from brief descriptions of liberation theology.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2387380", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2387380", "title": "Salomon Maimon", "text": "Salomon Maimon\n\nSalomon Maimon (; ; ‎; 1753 – 22 November 1800) was a German-speaking philosopher, born of Jewish parentage in present-day Belarus.\n\nSalomon Maimon was born Shlomo ben Joshua in the town of Zhukov Borok near Mir in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (present-day Belarus), where his grandfather leased an estate from a Prince Karol Stanisław \"Panie Kochanku\" Radziwiłł. He was taught Torah and Talmud, first by his father, and later by instructors in Mir. He was recognized as a prodigy in Talmudic studies, which he later described as \"endless disputation without end or aim\". His parents fell on hard times, and betrothed him to two separate girls in order to take advantage of their dowries, leading to a bitter rivalry. At the age of eleven he was married to one of the two prospects, a girl from Nesvizh. At the age 14 he was already a father and was making money by teaching Talmud. Later he learned some German from books and walked all the way to Slutsk, where he met a rabbi who had studied in Germany. He borrowed German books on physics, optics and medicine from him. After that he became determined to study further.\n\nMaimon describes how he took an interest in Kabbalah, and made a pilgrimage to the court of the Maggid of Mezritch around 1770. He ridiculed the Maggid's adherents for their enthusiasm, and charged the Maggid with manipulating his followers. He also wrote that the Maggid's ideas are \"closer to correct ideas of religion and morals\" than those he was taught in cheder.\"\n\nIn his mid-twenties Maimon left his home area in the direction of the German-speaking lands. His first attempt to take up residence in Berlin in 1778 failed. He was expelled for possession of the \"Moreh Nebukhim\" of Maimonides. A later attempt to convert to Christianity in Hamburg failed due to admitted lack of belief in Christian dogma. His second attempt to settle in Berlin in 1780 succeeded; he established a close connection with Moses Mendelssohn and entered the circles of the \"Haskalah\" (the Jewish Enlightenment movement) in Berlin. Mendelssohn introduced him to some wealthy Jews in Berlin, upon whom Maimon relied for patronage while he pursued his studies. He devoted himself to the study of philosophy along the lines of Leibniz, Wolff and Mendelssohn.\n\nIn 1783, Mendelssohn asked Maimon to leave Berlin due to Maimon's open Spinozism. After a journey to Hamburg, Amsterdam and then back to Hamburg, he started attending the Gymnasium Christianeum in Altona. During his stay there he improved his knowledge of the natural sciences and his command of German. In 1785, Maimon left for Berlin (where he met Mendelssohn for the last time), then moved to Dessau, and then settled in Breslau, where he attempted to study medicine but eventually took up the position of a tutor.\n\nAfter many years of separation, Maimon's wife, Sarah, accompanied by their eldest son, David, managed to locate him in Breslau. She demanded that he either return to their home in Lithuania or give her a divorce. Maimon eventually agreed to the divorce.\n\nIt was not until 1787 in Berlin that Maimon became acquainted with Kantian philosophy, and in 1790 he published the \"Essay on Transcendental Philosophy\" (\"Versuch über die Transcendentalphilosophie\"), in which he formulated his objections to Kant's system. Kant seems to have considered Maimon one of his most astute critics. Maimon published a commentary on the \"Moreh Nebuchim\" of Maimonides in 1791 (\"Gibeath Hamore\", \"The Hill of the Guide\"). In 1792/3 he published his \"Autobiography\" (\"Lebensgeschichte\").\n\nin 1795, Maimon found a peaceful residence in the house of a young Silesian nobleman, Count Heinrich Wilhelm Adolf Kalkreuth, and moved to the latter's estate in Siegersdorf near Freystadt in Schlesien. Maimon died there at the age of 48 from apparent alcoholism.\n\nHe seizes upon the fundamental incompatibility of a consciousness which can apprehend, and yet is separated from, the thing-in-itself. That which is object of thought cannot be outside consciousness; just as in mathematics \"–1\" is an unreal quantity, so things-in-themselves are \"ex hypothesi\" outside consciousness, i.e. are unthinkable. The Kantian paradox he explains as the result of an attempt to explain the origin of the given in consciousness. The form of things is admittedly subjective; the mind endeavours to explain the material of the given in the same terms, an attempt which is not only impossible but involves a denial of the elementary laws of thought. Knowledge of the given is, therefore, essentially incomplete. Complete or perfect knowledge is confined to the domain of pure thought, to logic and mathematics. Thus the problem of the thing-in-itself is dismissed from the inquiry, and philosophy is limited to the sphere of pure thought.\n\nThe Kantian categories are demonstrable and true, but their application to the given is meaningless and unthinkable. By this critical scepticism Maimon takes up a position intermediate between Kant and Hume. Hume's attitude to the empirical is entirely supported by Maimon. The causal concept, as given by experience, expresses not a necessary objective order of things, but an ordered scheme of perception; it is subjective and cannot be postulated as a concrete law apart from consciousness.\n\nWhereas Kant posed a dualism between understanding and sensibility, or between concepts and the given, Maimon refers both these faculties back to a single source of cognition. Sensibility, in Maimon's view, is therefore not completely without conceptual content, but is generated according to rules that Maimon calls differentials. In calling them this, Maimon is referring to the differentials from the calculus, which are entities that despite being neither qualitative nor quantitative, can nevertheless give rise to a determinate quantity and quality when related to other differentials. The operations of the faculty of sensibility are for Maimon therefore not principally different from those of mathematical intuition: seeing the color red is the same procedure as drawing a geometrical figure such as a line in a circle in thought. The reason that qualities are nevertheless 'given' is that it is only an infinite understanding that can grasp the rules for the generation of qualities in the way that a human understanding can grasp the rules for drawing a circle.\n\nKant had received the first chapter of Maimon's book in manuscript from Markus Herz. In a letter to Herz from May 26, 1789, Kant writes the following:\n\n\"I had half decided to send the manuscript back in its immediately ... But one glance at the work made me realize its excellence and that not only had none of my critics understood me and the main questions as well as Herr Maimon does but also very few men possess so much acumen for such deep investigations as he...\"\n\nNevertheless, Kant does not agree with Maimon's assessment. For Kant, the question of the relationship of the faculties is adequately answered by the Transcendental Deduction, in which Kant argues that the categories make experience possible. Furthermore, as an explanation of the harmony of the faculties, Kant offers the Leibnizian account of a pre-established harmony.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "515547", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=515547", "title": "Semiosis", "text": "Semiosis\n\nSemiosis (from the , \"sēmeíōsis\", a derivation of the verb , \"sēmeiô\", \"to mark\") is any form of activity, conduct, or process that involves signs, including the production of meaning. Briefly – semiosis is sign process. The term was introduced by Charles Sanders Peirce (1839–1914) to describe a process that interprets signs as referring to their objects, as described in his theory of sign relations, or semiotics. Other theories of sign processes are sometimes carried out under the heading of semiology, following on the work of Ferdinand de Saussure (1857–1913).\n\nPeirce was interested primarily in logic, while Saussure was interested primarily in linguistics, which examines the functions and structures of language. However, both of them recognized that there is more to significant representation than language in the narrow sense of speech and writing alone. With this in mind, they developed the idea of semiosis to relate language to other sign systems both human and nonhuman. Today, there is disagreement as to the operating cause and effect. One school of thought argues that language is the semiotic prototype and its study illuminates principles that can be applied to other sign systems. The opposing school argues that there is a metasign system and that language is simply one of many codes for communicating meaning, citing the way in which human infants learn about their environment before they have acquired verbal language. Whichever may be right, a preliminary definition of semiosis is any action or influence for communicating meaning by establishing relationships between signs which are to be interpreted by an audience.\n\nSemiosis is the performance element involving signs. Although a human can communicate many \"things\" unintentionally, individuals usually speak or write to elicit some kind of response. Yet there is little real explanation of how semiosis produces its effects, which is odd given that the word \"sign\" is in everyday use and most people would understand what it means. But semiotics has not offered clear technical definitions, nor is there agreement about how signs should be classified. \n\nAs an insect or animal, human or otherwise, moves through its environment (sometimes termed the umwelt), all the senses collect data that are made available to the brain. However, to prevent sensory overload, only salient data will receive the full attention of the cognitive elements of the mind. This indicates that a part of the process must be controlled by a model of the real world capable of ranking data elements in terms of their significance and filtering out the data irrelevant to survival. A sign cannot function until the brain or audience distinguishes it from the background \"noise\". When this happens, the sign then triggers cognitive activity to interpret the data input and so convert it into meaningful information. This would suggest that, in the semiosphere, the process of semiosis goes through the following cycle:\nIn biology, scout bees and ants will return home to \"tell\" the others where food is to be found, the fact of fertility must be announced to prospective mates from the same species, and the presence of danger must be passed as a warning to others in the group. Such transmission may be chemical, auditory, visual, or tactile whether singly or in combination. There is a new field of research activity termed biosemiotics, and Jesper Hoffmeyer claims that endosymbiosis, self-reference, code duality, the availability of receptors, autopoiesis, and others are the general properties of all living systems. Thomas Sebeok suggests that a similar list of properties for life may coincide with the definition of semiosis, i.e. that the test of whether \"something\" is alive, is a test to determine whether and how it communicates meaning to another of its kind, i.e., whether it has semiosis. This has been called the Sebeok's Thesis.\n\nFor humans, semiosis is an aspect of the wider systems of social interaction in which information is exchanged. It can result in particular types of social encounter, but the process itself can be constrained by social conventions such as propriety, privacy, and disclosure. This means that no social encounter is reducible to semiosis alone, and that semiosis can only be understood by identifying and exploring all the conditions that make the transmission and reception of signs possible and effective. When two individuals meet, the ways in which they think, the specific identities they assume, the emotional responses they make, and the beliefs, motives, and purposes they have, will frame the situation as it develops dynamically and potentially test the legitimacy of the outcomes. All these elements are, to a greater or lesser extent, semiotic in nature in that prevailing codes and values are being applied. Consequently, where the line is drawn between semiosis and semiotics will always be somewhat arbitrary.\n\n\n"}

Starting winter quarter 2018, she will be joining the UCLA Department of Philosophy as a new professor and faculty member.\n\nHer book \"Tracking Truth\" presents a unified treatment of knowledge, evidence, and epistemological realism and anti-realism about science, based on the idea that knowing is responsiveness to the way the world is, and that this is an ability to follow the truth through time and changing circumstances. Responsiveness is defined for empirical knowledge by a reformulation of Robert Nozick’s tracking conditions—for example: if p were false, then S wouldn’t believe p—using conditional probability instead of counterfactuals. Roush argues that the new tracking view is superior to other externalist views of knowledge, including process reliabilism. Of particular interest are the new view’s fallibilist account of knowledge of logical truth, its treatment of reflective knowledge and lottery propositions, its solutions to the value problem and the generality problem, its implications about skepticism, and its explanation of why knowledge is power in the Baconian sense.\n\nIn the second half of the book it is argued that the tracking theory of evidence is best formulated and defended as a confirmation theory based on the Likelihood Ratio. The tracking theories of knowledge and evidence thereby fit together to provide a deep explanation of why having better evidence makes you more likely to know. Finally, the book argues that confirmation theory is relevant to debates about scientific realism, and defends a position intermediate between realism and anti-realism on the basis of a view about what having evidence requires.\n\n"}
{"id": "17306847", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17306847", "title": "Tamil nationalism", "text": "Tamil nationalism\n\nTamil nationalism is the ideology which asserts that the Tamil people constitute a nation and promotes the cultural unity of Tamil people. Tamil nationalism is primarily a secular nationalism, that focus on language and homeland. It expresses itself in the form of linguistic purism (\"Pure Tamil\"), nationalism and irredentism (\"Tamil Eelam\"), Social equality (\"Self-Respect Movement\") and Tamil Renaissance.\n\nTamils are one of the oldest civilisations in the world with a rich culture and language. Originally, Tamil people ruled in Tamilakam and parts of Sri Lanka. During the colonial period, the Tamil areas came under the rule of British India and Ceylon. This saw the end of the sovereignty of Tamils and reduced them to minority status under a political model implemented during the British Raj. Since the independence of India and Sri Lanka, Tamil separatist movements have been actively suppressed in both countries.\n\nA famous quote by Tamil poet Kannadasan about the Tamils as a stateless nation.\n\nSince the adoption of the Vaddukoddai Resolution in 1976 under the leadership of S.J.V. Chelvanayakam, Tamil nationalists in Sri Lanka have repeatedly attempted to create an independent state (Tamil Eelam) amid the increasing political and physical violence against ordinary Tamils by the Sri Lankan government which was dominated by Sinhalese Buddhist nationalism.\n\nShortly after the island's independence from Britain, the Sri Lankan government passed the Citizenship Act of 1948, which made more than a million Tamils of Indian origin stateless. The government also passed a Sinhala Only Act, which severely threatened the status of Tamil as a minority language, as well as hindering the social mobility of Tamil speakers.. In addition, the government also initiated the Sinhalese colonisation scheme, with the aim of lessening the numerical presence of minorities as well as monopolising traditionally shared economic activities such as agriculture and fisheries, which have been part of the livelihood of Sri Lankan Tamils since time immemorial.\n\nAfter anti-Tamil pogroms in 1956, 1958 and 1977 and police brutality against Tamils protesting against these acts, guerilla groups like Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) were created to safeguard the interest and rights of Tamils in their own land. The burning of Jaffna library in 1981 and Black July in 1983 finally led to over 25 years of war between the Sri Lankan army and the Tamil Tigers. Persistent use of violence, including assassinations, led the LTTE to be declared as a terrorist organization by India, Malaysia, the European Union, Canada, and the USA. The civil war came to an end in 2009 with the military defeat of LTTE and the death of its leader, Prabhakaran. The Sri Lankan civil war led to death of over 100,000 people according to the United Nations. The Sri Lankan Government are alleged to have committed war crimes against the civilian Sri Lankan Tamil people during the final months of the Eelam War IV phase in 2009. A PPT verdict declared it as a genocide committed against ethnic Tamils by the Sri Lanka, government. Following the conclusion of the Civil War, the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) dropped their demand for an independent Tamil Eelam in favour of regional autonomy in a remerged North Eastern Province. The idea of Federalism in Sri Lanka is opposed by the Sri Lankan Government, which prefers a unitary state.\n\nIn 2010, the Transnational Government of Tamil Eelam (TGTE) was founded by Visvanathan Rudrakumaran who aim to create an independent Tamil Eelam in peaceful democratic means. The Tamil People's Council (TPC) led by chief minister C. V. Vigneswaran organized \"Eluga Tamil\" (\"Arise, Tamils) rally in northern Jaffna and eastern Batticaloa to address that Tamil rights are still refused by Sri Lankan Government.\n\nThe Indian Tamil Nationalism is the smaller section of the Dravidian Nationalism which consisted of all the four major Dravidian language in the South India. The Dravidian Nationalism was popularised by a series of small movements and organisations that contended that the South Indians, and a cultural entity that was different from the Indo-Aryans of North India. A new morphed ideology of the Dravidian nationalism gained momentum within the Tamil speakers during the 1930 and 1950. The Dravidian nationalism failed outside Tamil Nadu to find supporters. During 1950s and 1960s, the Nationalist ideologies lead to the argument by Tamil leaders that, at minimal, that Tamils must have self-determination or, at maximum, secession from India. By the late 1960, the political parties who were espousing Dravidian ideologies gained power within the state of Tamil Nadu.\n\nSince the 1969 election victory of Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) under C N Annadurai, Tamil nationalism has been a permanent feature of the government of Tamil Nadu. The DMK came to power on the plank of opposing Hindi monopoly/imposition. Prior to coming to power, they also openly declared to fight for Tamil independence from India. But since the Indian government had added a new legislation that outlawed anyone wanting independence from India, under the sedition act, and that made political parties to lose their right to stand in election, the DMK dropped this demand. With this, the drive for secession became weaker with most mainstream political parties, except a few, who instead committed to development of Tamil Nadu within a united India. Most major Tamil Nadu regional parties such as DMK, All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK), Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) and Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (MDMK) frequently participate as coalition partners of other pan-Indian parties in the Union Government of India at New Delhi.\n\nIn 1958, S. P. Adithanar founded the \"We Tamils\" party who wanted the creation of a homogeneous Greater Tamil Nadu incorporating Tamil speaking areas of India and Sri Lanka. In 1960, the party organized a statewide protest who demanded the establishment of sovereign Tamil Nadu. During the protest were maps of Republic of India (with Tamil Nadu left out) burnt. We Tamils party lost the elections in 1962 and was merged 1967 with the DMK. The outbreak of the Sri Lankan civil war lead that the Tamil nationalism in India took a new shape. In India emerged small Tamil militant groups such as Tamil Nadu Liberation Army led by Thamizharasan, who aspired an independent Tamil Nadu. After his death, the group is believed to have splintered into factions. TNLA was banned by the Government of India. Another banned Tamil secessionist group in India was the Tamil National Retrieval Troops (TNRT) founded by P. Ravichandran in the late-1980s. TNRT,a terrorist organization, fought for an independent Tamil homeland and followed the goal to unite Tamil Nadu and Tamil Eelam to a Greater Tamil Nadu.\n\nIn October 2008, amid build up in shelling into the Tamil civilian areas by the Sri Lankan military, with the army moving in on the LTTE and the navy battling the latter's sea patrol, Indian Tamil MP's, including those supporting the Singh government in the DMK and PMK, threatened to resign en masse if the Indian government did not pressure the Lankan government to cease firing on civilians. In response, the Indian government reported it had upped the ante on the Lankan government to ease tensions. Ever since, the DMK, apart from the 2G corruption scandals, has seen a steady decline in popularity in Tamil Nadu. Many Tamils felt disenfranchised with the DMK, that it did not act to do much to stop the genocide of Tamils in Sri Lanka.\n\nK. Muthukumar a Tamil journalist and activist in Tamil Nadu committed suicide, because the government failed to save Sri Lankan Tamils. His death instantly triggered widespread strikes, demonstrations and public unrest in Tamil Nadu. There is also deep resentment against India among some Tamils, that it aided the Sri Lankan state in the 2009 genocide. This led to minor incidents like Tamil nationalists turning out in support of the Eelam rebels when Chennai-based \"The Hindu\" was alleged to have been supporting the Government of Sri Lanka. Editor-in-Chief of The Hindu, N Ram named members of the Periyar Dravidar Kazhagam, Thamizh Thesiya Periyakkam, some lawyers, and law college students as responsible for incidents of vandalism at their offices.\n\nThe Tamil nationalist party Naam Tamilar Katchi arose 18 May 2010 as a result of the bloody end of the Sri Lankan civil war. Main agenda of this party is the liberation of Tamil Eelam, only Tamils should rule in Tamil Nadu and to spread the importance of Tamil language and unity of Tamils, irrespective of religion and caste.\n\n2013 it came to series of Anti-Sri Lanka protests initiated by the Students Federation for Freedom of Tamil Eelam. The students demanded justice for Sri Lankan Tamils and a UN referendum on the formation of Tamil Eelam. Tamil organizations, parties and the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu demand an International Investigation of Sri Lankan war crimes and a UN referendum among Sri Lankan Tamils on the formation of Tamil Eelam.\n\nThe ban on Jallikattu was seen by Tamils as an attack on their culture and identity. In 2017, it came to a statewide pro-jallikattu protests in Indian state of Tamil Nadu, which lasted several days. Tamils from all over the world express their solidarity with the protesters in Tamil Nadu. The government claimed that anti-national elements would be among the protests who raised slogans for a separate Tamil Nadu and against India The Tamil rapper Hiphop Tamizha distanced himself from the protest, because he felt uncomfortable with the anti-national and secessionist elements in the protests. Tamil actor Kamal Hassan claimed that seeking a separate country for Tamils is not anti-national and that many political leaders have done so in the past.\n\nThe anti-Hindi agitation was a form of resistance to the imposition of the Hindi language throughout India. C Rajagopalachari (Rajaji), who wanted to reinstate the “Varna system” in India, tried to impose Hindi as the national language, with Hindi taught in all Indian schools. This move was opposed by Periyar, who started an agitation that lasted for about three years. The agitation involved fasts, conferences, marches, picketing and protests. The government responded with a crackdown resulting in the death of two protesters and the arrest of 1,198 persons including women and children. The Congress Government of the Madras State, called in paramilitary forces to quell the agitation; their involvement resulted in the deaths of about seventy persons (by official estimates) including two policemen. Several Tamil leaders supported the continuation of the usage of English as the official language of India. To calm the situation, Indian Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri gave assurances that English would continue to be used as the official language as long the non-Hindi speaking states wanted. The riots subsided after Shastri's assurance, as did the student agitation.\n\nFour states - Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan- have been granted the right to conduct proceedings in their High Courts in their official language, which, for all of them, was Hindi. However, the only non-Hindi state to seek a similar power - Tamil Nadu, which sought the right to conduct proceedings in Tamil in its High Court - had its application rejected by the central government earlier, which said it was advised to do so by the Supreme Court. In 2006, the law ministry said that it would not object to Tamil Nadu state's desire to conduct Madras High Court proceedings in Tamil. In 2010, the Chief Justice of the Madras High Court allowed lawyers to argue cases in Tamil ...\n\nAlthough nationalism itself is a modern phenomenon, the expression of linguistic identity found in the modern Pure Tamil movement has pre-modern antecedents, in a \"loyalty to Tamil\" (as opposed to Sanskrit) visible in ancient Sangam literature.\nThe poems of Sangam literature imply a consciousness of independence or separateness from neighbouring regions. Similarly, Silappadhikaaram, a post-Sangam epic, posits a cultural integrity for the entire Tamil region and has been interpreted by Parthasarathy as presenting \"an expansive vision of the Tamil imperium\" which \"speaks for all Tamils.\" Subrahmanian sees in the epic the first expression of Tamil nationalism, while Parthasarathy says that the epic shows \"the beginnings of Tamil separatism.\"\n\nMedieval Tamil texts also demonstrate features of modern Tamil linguistic purism, most notably the claim of parity of status with Sanskrit which was traditionally seen in the rest of the Indian subcontinent as being a prestigious, trans-local language. Texts on prosody and poetics such as the 10th century Yaapparungalakkaarihai and the 11th century Veerasoazhiyam, for example, treat Tamil as the equal of Sanskrit in terms of literary prestige, and use the rhetorical device of describing Tamil as a beautiful young lady and as a pure, divine language both of which are also central in modern Tamil nationalism. Vaishnavite and Shaivite commentators took the claim of divinity one step further, claiming for Tamil a liturgical status, and seeking to endow Tamil texts with the status of a \"fifth Veda.\"\nVaishnavite commentators such as Nanjiyar went one step further, declaring that people who were not Tamil lamented the fact that they were not born in a place where such a wonderful language was spoken. This trend was not universal, and there were also authors who sought to argue and work against Tamil distinctiveness through, amongst other things, Sanskritisation.\n\n\n"}

The book was published with the support of Jean Paulhan from Gallimard, who created a collection exclusively dedicated to \"Tradition\" in order to publish Guénon. The book corresponded to the mood of the public in the immediate post-war period. It was such a success that it was sold out within two months of publication and subsequently had to be quickly reissued twice. \n\nFor Guénon, history is only the reflection of a vast cosmic process taking its source in a metaphysical dimension (according to his metaphysical doctrine).\nFrom the traditionalist perspective, the temporal, phenomenal world is an outflow and manifestation of an unseen metaphysical reality that forms the origin and basis of the material, historical reality human beings perceive with their five senses. It has been pointed out by several authors that such a conception of History is radically different from that of Hegel who on the contrary locks his in the sphere of time.\nMore precisely, as Georges Vallin explains, in Hegel's thought, the timeless mystery of non-duality, of the \"coincidence of opposites\" found in Guénon, is replaced by \"a time-based dialectic of thesis and antithesis.\" For Vallin, this notion of confinement in time of the human condition, in opposition to the \"metaphysical perspective\" of Guénon, continued with the conception exposed by Martin Heidegger in \"Being and Time\". For Guénon, such a confinement of History in Time, cut off from any transcendent reality, takes on a satanic dimension that explains the fall of the modern world.\nCharles Upton (poet) writes that: \n\nJohn Griffin also writes that: \n\nAnd Lee Penn that: \n\nAfter the publication of the book two new movements, communism and existentialism, started to dominate and inform the minds of the intellectual elite in France.\n\nMore recently; Jacob Needleman, in \"The Sword of Gnosis\" writes:\n\n\"Many of Guénon's books, notably \"The Reign of Quantity\", are such potent and detailed metaphysical attacks on the downward drift of Western civilization as to make all other contemporary critiques seem half-hearted by comparison.\"\n\nHarry Oldmeadow, author of \"Traditionalism: Religion in the Light of the Perennial Philosophy\":\n\n\"\"The Reign of Quantity\" is a brilliantly sustained and excoriating attack on modern civilization [...] The book is a controlled and dispassionate but devastating razing of the assumptions and values of modern science. At the same time it is an affirmation of the metaphysical and cosmological principles given expression in traditional culture and religions.\"\n\nThere are complete translations of \"Le règne de la quantité\" in a number of languages: English, Italian, Spanish, and Turkish.

He elaborated upon and implemented Peter the Great's reform of the Russian Orthodox Church and was one of the founding fathers of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Prokopovich wrote many religious verses and some of the most enduring sermons in the Russian language.\n\nFeofan (born Eleazar) Prokopovich was born in Kiev. His father, Tsereysky, was a shopkeeper from Smolensk. After the death of his parents, Eleazar was adopted by his maternal uncle, Feofan Prokopovich. Feofan Prokopovich was the governor of the Kiev Brotherhood Epiphany Monastery, professor, and rector of the Kiev-Mogila Academy.\n\nProkopovich's uncle sent him to the monastery for primary school. After graduation, he became a student of the Kiev-Mogila Academy.\n\nIn 1698, after graduating from the Kiev-Mogila Academy, Eleazar continued his education at the Volodymyr-Volynskyi Uniate Collegium. He lived in the Basilian monastery and was tonsured as a monk under the name of Elisha. The Uniate Bishop of Volodymyr-Volynskyi, Zalensky, noticed the extraordinary abilities of the young monk and contributed to his transfer to the Catholic Academy of St. Athanasius in Rome, which was created by theologians to spread Catholicism among Eastern Orthodox adherents.\n\nIn Rome, he enjoyed access to the Vatican Library. In addition to theology, Prokopovich also studied the works of ancient Latin and Greek philosophers, historians, attractions of old and new Rome, and the principles of the Catholic faith and of the Pope. Throughout his studies, he became acquainted with the works of Tommaso Campanella, Galileo Galilei, Giordano Bruno, and Nicolaus Copernicus.\n\nIn October 28, 1701, Prokopovich left Rome without completing his full course at the academy. He passed through France, Switzerland, and Germany, before studying in Halle. There he became acquainted with the ideas of the Protestant Reformation.\n\nHe returned to Ukraine (then part of the Tsardom of Russia) in 1704, first to Pochayiv Lavra, then to Kiev, where he renounced the Catholic faith as well as his penance and tonsure with the Orthodox monks, taking the name Feofan in memory of his uncle.\n\nBeginning in 1705, Prokopovich taught rhetoric, poetics, and philosophy at the Kiev-Mogila Collegium. He also wrote the tragicomedy \"Vladimir,\" dedicating it to Hetman Ivan Mazepa. At the same time, he wrote the theological and philosophical sermons which were seen by the Kiev governor-generals Dmitry Golitsyn and Alexander Menshikov.\n\nIn 1707, he became Prefect of the Kiev-Mogila Academy.\n\nIn 1711, Prokopovich gave a sermon on the occasion of the anniversary of the Battle of Poltava. The Tsar of Russia, Peter I, was struck by the eloquence of this sermon, and upon his return to Kiev, Feofan Prokopovich was appointed rector of the Kiev-Mogila Academy and a professor of theology. At the same time, he also became abbot of the Kiev Brotherhood Epiphany Monastery. He entirely reformed the teaching of theology there, substituting the historical method of the German theologians for the Orthodox scholastic system.\n\nIn 1716, he went to St Petersburg. From that point, Prokopovich spent his time explaining the new scholastic system and justifying its most controversial innovations from the pulpit. Despite the opposition of the Russian clergy, who regarded the \"Light of Kiev\" as an interloper and semi-heretic, he became invaluable to the civil power. He was promoted to bishop of Pskov in 1718, and archbishop of Novgorod in 1725. \nAs the author of the spiritual regulation for the reform of the Russian Orthodox Church, Feofan is regarded as the creator of the spiritual department superseding the patriarchate, better known by its later name of the Holy Governing Synod, of which he was made vice-president. A pitiless enemy of superstitions of any kind, Prokopovich continued to be a reformer even after the death of Peter the Great.\n\n He had served as vicar to the previous Archbishop of Novgorod since the early 18th century.

{"id": "17178373", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17178373", "title": "Theories of poverty", "text": "Theories of poverty\n\nTheories on the causes of poverty are the foundation upon which poverty reduction strategies are based.\n\nWhile in developed nations poverty is often seen as either a personal or a structural defect, in developing nations the issue of poverty is more profound due to the lack of governmental funds. Some theories on poverty in the developing world focus on cultural characteristics as a retardant of further development. Other theories focus on social and political aspects that perpetuate poverty; perceptions of the poor have a significant impact on the design and execution of programs to alleviate poverty.\n\nWhen it comes to poverty in the United States, there are two main lines of thought. The most common line of thought within the U.S. is that a person is poor because of personal traits. These traits in turn have caused the person to fail. Supposed traits range from personality characteristics, such as laziness, to educational levels. Despite this range, it is always viewed as the individual's personal failure not to climb out of poverty. This thought pattern stems from the idea of meritocracy and its entrenchment within U.S. thought. Meritocracy, according to Katherine S. Newman is “the view that those who are worthy are rewarded and those who fail to reap rewards must also lack self-worth.” This does not mean that all followers of meritocracy believe that a person in poverty deserves their low standard of living. Rather the underlying ideas of personal failure show in the resistance to social and economic programs such as welfare; a poor individual's lack of prosperity shows a personal failing and should not be compensated (or justified) by the state.\n\nRank, Yoon, and Hirschl (2003) present a contrary argument to the idea that personal failings are the cause of poverty. The argument presented is that United States poverty is result of “failings at the structural level.” Key social and economic structural failings which contribute heavily to poverty within the U.S. are identified in the article. The first is a failure of the job market to provide a proper amount of jobs which pay enough to keep families out of poverty. Even if unemployment is low, the labor market may be saturated with low-paying, part-time work that lacks benefits (thus limiting the amount of full-time, good paying jobs). Rank, Yoon and Hirschl examined the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), a longitudinal study on employment and income. Using the 1999 official poverty line of $17,029 for a family of four, it was found that 9.4% of persons working full-time and 14.9% of persons working at least part-time did not earn enough annually to keep them above the poverty line. One study showed that 29% of families in The United States could go six months or longer during a hardship with no income. Over 50% of respondents said around two months with no income and another 20% said they could not go longer than two weeks. Low minimum wage, combined with part-time jobs which offer no benefits, have contributed to the labor market's inability to produce enough jobs which can keep a family out of poverty is an example of an economic structural failure.\n\nRank, Yoon and Hirschl point to the minimal amount of social safety nets found within the U.S. as a social structural failure and a major contributor to poverty in the U.S. Other industrialized nations devote more resources to assisting the poor than the U.S. As a result of this difference poverty is reduced in nations which devote more to poverty reduction measure and programs. Rank et al. use a table to drive this point home. The table shows that in 1994, the actual rate of poverty (what the rate would be without government interventions) in the U.S. was 29%. When compared to actual rates in Canada (29%), Finland (33%), France (39%), Germany (29%), the Netherlands (30%), Norway (27%), Sweden (36%) and the United Kingdom (38%), the United States rate is low. But when government measures and programs are included, the rate of reduction in poverty in the United States is low (38%). Canada and the United Kingdom had the lowest reduction rates outside of the U.S. at 66%, while Sweden, Finland and Norway had reduction rates greater than 80% (All percentages taken from ).\n\nDevelopment plays a central role to poverty reduction in third world countries. Some authors feel that the national mindset itself plays a role in the ability for a country to develop and to thus reduce poverty. Mariano Grondona (2000) outlines twenty “cultural factors” which, depending on the culture's view of each, can be indicators as to whether the cultural environment is favorable or resistant to development. In turn Lawrence E. Harrison (2000) identifies ten “values” which, like Grondona's factors, can be indicative of the nation's developmental environment. Finally, Stace Lindsay (2000) claims the differences between development-prone and development-resistant nations is attributed to mental models (which, like values, influence the decisions humans make). Mental models are also cultural creations. Grondona, Harrison and Lindsay all feel that without development orientated values and mindsets, nations will find it difficult if not impossible to develop efficiently, and that some sort of cultural change will be needed in these nations in order to reduce poverty.\n\nIn “A Cultural Typology of Economic Development”, from the book Culture Matters, Mariano Grondona claims development is a matter of decisions. These decisions, whether they are favorable to economic development or not, are made within the context of culture. All cultural values considered together create “value systems”. These systems heavily influence the way decisions are made as well as the reactions and outcomes of said decisions. In the same book, Stace Lindsay's chapter claims the decisions individuals make are a result of mental models. These mental models influence all aspects of human action. Like Grondona's value systems, these mental models which dictate a nations stance toward development and hence its ability to deal with poverty.\n\nGrondona presents two ideal value systems (mental models), one of which has values only favoring development, the other only with value which resist development. Real value systems fluctuate and fall somewhere between the two poles, but developed countries tend to bunch near one end, while undeveloped countries bunch near the other. Grondona goes on to identify twenty cultural factors on which the two value systems stand in opposition. These factors include such things as the dominant religion; the role of the individual in society; the value placed on work; concepts of wealth, competition, justice and time; and the role of education. In “Promoting Progressive Cultural Change”, also from Culture Matters, Lawrence E. Harrison identifies values, like Grondona's factors, which differ between “progressive” cultures and “static” cultures. Religion, value of work, overall justice and time orientation are included in his list, but Harrison also adds frugality and community as important factors. Like Grondona and Harrison, Lindsay also presents “patterns of thought” which differ between nations that stand at opposite poles of the developmental scale. Lindsay focuses more on economic aspects such as the form of capital focused upon and market characteristics. Key themes which emerge from these lists as characteristic of developmental cultures are: trust in the individual with a fostering of individual strengths; the ability for free thinking in an open, safe environment; importance of questioning/innovation; law is supreme and holds the power; future orientated time frame with an emphasis on achievable, practical goals; meritocracy; an autonomous mindset within the larger world; strong work ethic is highly valued and rewarded; a microeconomic focus; and a value that is non-economic, but not anti-economic, which is always wanting. Characteristics of the ideal non-developmental value system are: suppression of the individual through control of information and censorship; present/past time orientation with emphasis on grandiose, often unachievable, goals; macroeconomic focus; access to leaders allowing for easier and greater corruption; unstable distribution of law and justice (family and its connections matter most); and a passive mindset within the larger world.\n\nGrondona, Harrison, and Lindsay all feel that at least some aspects of development-resistant cultures need to change in order to allow under-developed nations (and cultural minorities within developed nations) to develop effectively. According to their argument, poverty is fueled by cultural characteristics within under-developed nations, and in order for poverty to be brought under control, said nations must move down the development path.\n\nVarious theorists believe the way poverty is approached, defined, and thus thought about, plays a role in its perpetuation. Maia Green (2006) explains that modern development literature tends to view poverty as agency filled. When poverty is prescribed agency, poverty becomes something that happens to people. Poverty absorbs people into itself and the people, in turn, become a part of poverty, devoid of their human characteristics. In the same way, poverty, according to Green, is viewed as an object in which all social relations (and persons involved) are obscured. Issues such as structural failings (see earlier section), institutionalized inequalities, or corruption may lie at the heart of a region's poverty, but these are obscured by broad statements about poverty. Arjun Appadurai writes of the “terms of recognition” (drawn from Charles Taylor's ‘points of recognition), which are given the poor are what allows poverty to take on this generalized autonomous form. The terms are “given” to the poor because the poor lack social and economic capital, and thus have little to no influence on how they are represented and/or perceived in the larger community. Furthermore, the term “poverty”, is often used in a generalized matter. This further removes the poor from defining their situation as the broadness of the term covers differences in histories and causes of local inequalities. Solutions or plans for reduction of poverty often fail precisely because the context of a region's poverty is removed and local conditions are not considered.\n\nThe specific ways in which the poor and poverty are recognized frame them in a negative light. In development literature, poverty becomes something to be eradicated, or, attacked. It is always portrayed as a singular problem to be fixed. When a negative view of poverty (as an animate object) is fostered, it can often lead to an extension of negativity to those who are experiencing it. This in turn can lead to justification of inequalities through the idea of the deserving poor. Even if thought patterns do not go as far as justification, the negative light poverty is viewed in, according to Appadurai, does much to ensure little change in the policies of redistribution.\n\nThe environment of poverty is one marked with unstable conditions and a lack of capital (both social and economical) which together create the vulnerability characteristic of poverty. Because a person's daily life is lived within the person's environment, a person's environment determines daily decisions and actions based on what is present and what is not. Dipkanar Chakravarti argues that the poor's daily practice of navigating the world of poverty generates a fluency in the poverty environment but a near illiteracy in the environment of the larger society. Thus, when a poor person enters into transactions and interactions with the social norm, that person's understanding of it is limited, and thus decisions revert to decisions most effective in the poverty environment. Through this a sort of cycle is born in which the “dimensions of poverty are not merely additive, but are interacting and reinforcing in nature.”\n\nAccording to Arjun Appadurai (2004), the key to the environment of poverty, which causes the poor to enter into this cycle, is the poor's lack of capacities. Appardurai's idea of capacity relates to Albert Hirschman's ideas of “voice” and “exit” which are ways in which people can decline aspects of their environment; to voice displeasure and aim for change or to leave said aspect of environment. Thus, a person in poverty lacks adequate voice and exit (capacities) with which they can change their position. Appadurai specifically deals with the capacity to aspire and its role in the continuation of poverty and its environment. Aspirations are formed through social life and its interactions. Thus, it can be said, that one's aspirations are influenced by one's environment. Appadurai claims that the better off one is, the more chances one has to not only reach aspirations but to also see the pathways which lead to the fulfillment of aspirations. By actively practicing the use of their capacity of aspiration the elite not only expand their aspiration horizon but also solidify their ability to reach aspirations by learning the easiest and most efficient paths through said practice. On the other hand, the poor's horizon of aspiration is much closer and less steady than that of the elite.\n\nThus, the capacity to aspire requires practice, and, as Chakravarti argues, when a capacity (or decision making process) is not refined through practice it falters and often fails. The unstable life of poverty often limits the poor's aspiration levels to those of necessity (such as having food to feed ones family) and in turn reinforces the lowered aspiration levels (someone who is busy studying, instead of looking for ways to get enough food, will not survive long in the poverty environment). Because the capacity to aspire (or lack thereof) reinforces and perpetuates the cycle of poverty, Appadurai claims that expanding the poor's aspiration horizon will help the poor to find both voice and exit. Ways of doing this include changing the terms of recognition (see previous section) and/or creating programs which provide the poor with an arena in which to practice capacities. An example of one such arena may be a housing development built for the poor, by the poor. Through this, the poor are able to not only show their abilities but to also gain practice dealing with governmental agencies and society at large. Through collaborative projects, the poor are able to expand their aspiration level above and beyond tomorrow's meal to the cultivation of skills and the entrance into the larger market.\n\n \n\n"}

His first ship was reportedly called The Boston and the second voyage was on board The Gatton.\n\nSubsequently, having become acquainted with Josiah Wedgwood in 1775, he moved to Amsterdam, where he made a living for a few years as Wedgwood's agent.\nOn his return to England he was persuaded by Thomas Holcroft to apply his writing talents to the composition of light literature for periodicals, while also assisting Holcroft with some of his plays and novels. Meanwhile, he devoted himself to the preparation of \"An Introduction to Natural Philosophy\", which was published in 1781 and was at once successful. A translation of Voltaire's \"Elements of the Newtonian Philosophy\" soon followed, and he then entirely devoted himself to scientific pursuits and philosophical journalism.\n\nIn 1784 he was proposed by Josiah Wedgwood (the current Chairman) and appointed as secretary to the General Chamber of Manufacturers of Great Britain, and he was also connected with the Society for the Encouragement of Naval Architecture, established in 1791. He gave much attention to the construction of various machines for comb-cutting, file-making, cylinder printing and other uses—he also invented an areometer.\n\nOn 12 December 1783, Nicholson was elected to the \"Chapter Coffee House Philosophical Society\". He was proposed by Jean-Hyacinthe Magellan and seconded by horologist John Whitehurst.\n\nNicholson communicated to the Royal Society in 1789 two papers on electrical subjects. In the same year he reviewed the controversy which had arisen over Richard Kirwan's essay on phlogiston, and published a translation of the adverse commentaries by the French academicians (Lavoisier, Monge, Berthollet, and Guyton de Morveau) as ‘An Essay on Phlogiston, to which are added Notes.’\n\nIn 1797 he founded, published, and wrote part of the \"Journal of Natural Philosophy, Chemistry and the Arts\", generally known as \"Nicholson's Journal\", the earliest monthly scientific work of its kind in Great Britain. The journal published the first known aerodynamic analysis of gliders and heavier-than-air fixed-wing flying machines designs, by George Cayley in 1809-1810. The publication continued until 1814.\n\nIn 1799 he established a school in London's Soho Square, where he taught natural philosophy and chemistry, with the aid of a grant of £1,500 from Thomas Pitt.\n\nIn May 1800 he with Anthony Carlisle discovered electrolysis, the decomposition of water into hydrogen and oxygen by voltaic current.

He is remembered today for one book, which he completed two years before his death: \"The Religion of Nature Delineated\". He led a cloistered life and published no other work, but in terms of eighteenth-century philosophy and the concept of natural religion, he is ranked with British Enlightenment philosophers such as Locke, Berkeley, and Hume. \n\nWollaston's work contributed to the development of two important intellectual schools: British Deism, and \"the pursuit of happiness\" moral philosophy of American Practical Idealism, which appears notably in the United States Declaration of Independence.\n\nWollaston was born at Coton Clanford in Staffordshire, on 26 March 1659. He was born to a family long-established in Staffordshire, and was distantly related to Sir John Wollaston, the Alderman and Lord Mayor of London. However, his family was not wealthy. At the age of ten, he began school at a Latin school newly opened in Shenstone, Staffordshire, and continued in country free schools until he was admitted to Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, at the age of 15, in June 1674. From his writings it is clear that he was an excellent scholar, \"extremely well versed\" in languages and literature.\n\nIn his last year at Cambridge, Wollaston published anonymously a small book, \"On the Design of the Book of Ecclesiastes, or the Unreasonableness of Men's Restless Contention for the Present Enjoyments, represented in an English Poem\" (London, 1691). Apparently embarrassed by his own work, Wollaston almost immediately suppressed it.\nAfter leaving Cambridge in September 1681, he became an assistant master at King Edward's School, Birmingham and took holy orders. At this time, he became Perpetual curate of St Mary's Church, Moseley from 1684 – 1686. \n\nIn 1688 a cousin left him a fortune and the family estates, including Finborough manor and Shenton Hall, Leicestershire, and in November of the same year he settled in London. There Wollaston devoted himself to private study of learning and philosophy, seldom leaving the city and declining to accept any public employment. In retirement, he published \"The Religion of Nature Delineated\" (1722) in a private edition. He wrote extensively on language, philosophy, religion, and history, but in the last few years of his life, he committed most of his manuscripts to the flames, as his health worsened and he began to feel that he would never be able to complete them to his satisfaction.\n\nWollaston suffered from fragile health throughout his life. Just after completing \"The Religion of Nature Delineated\", he broke his arm in an accident, and his strength declined and illnesses increased until his death on 29 October 1724. His body was carried to Great Finborough in Suffolk, where he was buried beside his wife.\n\nThe \"Religion of Nature Delineated\" was an attempt to create a system of ethics without recourse to revealed religion. He claimed originality for his theory that the moral evil is the practical denial of a true proposition and moral good the affirmation of it, writing that this attempt to use mathematics to create a rationalist ethics was \"something never met with anywhere\". Wollaston \"held that religious truths were plain as Euclid, clear to all who contemplated Creation.\" Newton had induced natural laws from a mathematical model of the physical world; similarly, Wollaston was attempting to induce moral laws by a mathematical model of the moral world.\n\nMore than 10,000 copies were sold in the just first few years alone with 22 imprints prior to 1800. There was Wollaston's private edition in 1722; after his death there was one public edition in 1724, five in 1725, five in 1726, two in 1731, one in 1737, four in 1738, one in 1746, one 1750, and one in 1759.\n\nWollaston's idea of a Natural religion without revelation briefly inspired and revived the movement known as Deism in England. Some today consider him a \"Christian Deist\", while others note that there is no \"significant evidence that William Wollaston was not a more or less orthodox Christian.\"\n\nAlthough Wollaston's ideas could be argued to have anticipated both Scottish Common Sense Realism and Utilitarianism proponents of later schools of philosophy criticised and sometimes even ridiculed Wollaston. These included Francis Hutcheson, David Hume, Richard Price, and Jeremy Bentham.\n\nAfter 1759 no further editions of his work was published in the rest of the century.\n\nBenjamin Franklin, worked as a compositor on one of the 1726 editions of the book and wrote the short pamphlet \"A Dissertation on Liberty and Necessity, Pleasure and Pain\" although he found it \"so shallow and unconvincing as to be embarrassing\", and burned as many copies as he could find. Although rejecting Deism he retained a fondness for the \"pursuit of happiness\" believing that God was best served by doing good works and helping other people.\n\nIt was a major influence on the American educator Rev. Dr. Samuel Johnson's college philosophy textbooks. Its focus on practice as well as speculation attracted a more mature Franklin, who commissioned and published Johnson's textbook \"Elementa Philosophica\" in 1752, then promoted it in the College of Philadelphia (now Penn University).\n\nOn 26 November 1689, Wollaston married Catharine Charlton (died 21 July 1720). They had eleven children together, four of whom died within his lifetime. They included:\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "47035547", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47035547", "title": "Yoga (philosophy)", "text": "Yoga (philosophy)\n\nYoga philosophy is one of the six major orthodox schools of Hinduism. Ancient, medieval and most modern literature often refers to the Yoga school of Hinduism simply as \"Yoga\". It is closely related to the Samkhya school of Hinduism. The Yoga school's systematic studies to better oneself physically, mentally and spiritually has influenced all other schools of Indian philosophy. The \"Yoga Sutras of Patanjali\" is a key text of the Yoga school of Hinduism.\n\nThe epistemology of the Yoga school of Hinduism, like the Sāmkhya school, relies on three of six \"Pramanas\" as the means of gaining reliable knowledge. These include \"Pratyakṣa\" (perception), \"Anumāṇa\" (inference) and \"Sabda\" (\"Āptavacana\", word/testimony of reliable sources). The metaphysics of Yoga is built on the same dualist foundation as the Samkhya school. The universe is conceptualized as composed of two realities in the Samhkya-Yoga schools: \"Puruṣa\" (consciousness) and \"prakriti\" (matter). \"Jiva\" (a living being) is considered as a state in which \"puruṣa\" is bonded to \"prakriti\" in some form, in various permutations and combinations of various elements, senses, feelings, activity and mind. During the state of imbalance or ignorance, one or more constituents overwhelm the others, creating a form of bondage. The end of this bondage is called liberation, or \"moksha\", by both the Yoga and Samkhya schools of Hinduism. The ethical theory of the Yoga school is based on Yamas and Niyama, as well as elements of the Guṇa theory of Samkhya.\n\nThe Yoga school of Hinduism differs from the closely related non-theistic/atheistic Samkhya school by incorporating the concept of a \"personal, yet essentially inactive, deity\" or \"personal god\" (Ishvara). While the Samkhya school suggests that jnana (knowledge) is a sufficient means to moksha, the Yoga school suggests that systematic techniques and practice, or personal experimentation, combined with Samkhya's approach to knowledge, is the path to moksha. Yoga shares several central ideas with the Advaita Vedanta school of Hinduism, with the difference that Yoga philosophy is a form of experimental mysticism, while Advaita Vedanta is a form of monistic personalism. Advaita Vedanta, and other schools of Hinduism, accept, adopt and build upon many of the teachings and techniques of Yoga.\n\nThe origins of the Yoga is said to be started by Lord Shiva. Some of its earliest discussions are found in 1st millennium BCE Indian texts such as the Katha Upanishad, the Shvetashvatara Upanishad and the Maitri Upanishad.\n\nThe root of \"Yoga\" is found in hymn 5.81.1 of the Rig Veda, a dedication to rising Sun-god in the morning (Savitri), interpreted as \"yoke\" or \"yogically control\".\n\nRigveda, however, does not describe Yoga philosophy with the same meaning or context as in medieval or modern times. Early references to practices that later became part of Yoga school of Hinduism, are made in Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, the oldest Upanishad. Gavin Flood translates it as, \"...having become calm and concentrated, one perceives the self (\"atman\"), within oneself.\" The practice of pranayama (consciously regulating breath) is mentioned in hymn 1.5.23 of Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (c. ~ 900 BCE), and the practice of pratyahara (concentrating all of one's senses on self) is mentioned in hymn 8.15 of Chandogya Upanishad (c. ~ 800-700 BCE).\n\nThe Katha Upanishad, dated to be from about the middle of the 1st millennium BCE, in verses 2.6.6 through 2.6.13 recommends a path to Self-knowledge, and calls this path \"Yoga\".\n\nThe Yoga school of Hinduism is mentioned in foundational texts of other orthodox schools such as the Vaisesikha Sutras, Nyaya Sutras and Brahma Sutras, which suggests that the Yoga philosophy was in vogue in the 1st millennium BCE. It influenced and was influenced by other schools and Indian philosophies. There are, for example, numerous parallels in the concepts in the Samkhya school of Hinduism, Yoga and the Abhidharma schools of thought, particularly from the 2nd century BCE to the 1st century AD, notes Larson. Patanjali's Yoga Sutras may be a synthesis of these three traditions. From the Samkhya school of Hinduism, the Yoga Sutras adopt the \"reflective discernment\" (\"adhyavasaya\") of \"prakrti\" and \"purusa\" (dualism), its metaphysical rationalism, as well its three epistemic methods to gaining reliable knowledge. From Abhidharma Buddhism's idea of \"nirodhasamadhi\", suggests Larson, the Yoga Sutras adopt the pursuit of an altered state of awareness, but unlike Buddhism, which believes that there is neither self nor soul, Yoga is physicalist and realist like Samkhya in believing that each individual has a self and soul. The third concept that the Yoga Sutras synthesize into its philosophy is the ancient ascetic traditions of isolation, meditation and introspection.\n\nThe systematic collection of ideas of the Yoga school of Hinduism is found in the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali. After its circulation in the first half of the 1st millennium CE, many Indian scholars reviewed it, then published their \"Bhāṣya\" (notes and commentary) on it, which together form a canon of texts called the \"Pātañjalayogaśāstra\" (\"The Treatise on Yoga of Patañjali\").\n\nThe Yoga school of Hinduism has been included as one of the six orthodox schools in medieval era Indian texts. The other schools are Samkhya, Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Mimamsa and Vedanta.\n\nThe Yoga school of Hindu philosophy is most closely related to the Samkhya school. In both, the foundational concepts include two realities: \"Purusha\" and \"Prakriti\". The \"Purusha\" is defined as that reality which is pure consciousness and is devoid of thoughts or qualities. The \"Prakriti\" is the empirical, phenomenal reality which includes matter and also mind, sensory organs and the sense of identity (self, soul). A living being is held in both schools to be the union of matter and mind. The Yoga school differs from the Samkhya school in its views on the ontology of \"Purusha\", on axiology and on soteriology.\n\nYoga school, like Samkhya school, considers \"Pratyakṣa\" or \"Dṛṣṭam\" (direct sense perception), \"Anumāna\" (inference), and \"Śabda\" or \"Āptavacana\" (verbal testimony of the sages or shāstras) to be the only valid means of knowledge or \"Pramana\". Unlike few other schools of Hinduism such as Advaita Vedanta, Yoga did not adopt the following three \"Pramanas\": \"Upamāṇa\" (comparison and analogy), \"Arthāpatti\" (postulation, deriving from circumstances) or \"Anupalabdi\" (non-perception, negative/cognitive proof).\n\nThe metaphysics of Yoga school, again like Samkhya school, is a form of dualism. It considers consciousness and matter, self/soul and body as two different realities.\n\nThe Samkhya-Yoga system espouses dualism between consciousness and matter by postulating two \"irreducible, innate and independent realities: Purusha and Prakriti. While the \"Prakriti\" is a single entity, the Samkhya-Yoga schools admit a plurality of the \"Puruṣa\"s in this world. Unintelligent, unmanifest, uncaused, ever-active, imperceptible and eternal Prakriti is alone the final source of the world of objects. The \"Puruṣa\" is considered as the conscious principle, a passive enjoyer (\"bhokta\") and the \"Prakriti\" is the enjoyed (\"bhogya\"). Samkhya-Yoga believes that the \"Puruṣa\" cannot be regarded as the source of inanimate world, because an intelligent principle cannot transform itself into the unconscious world. This metaphysics is a pluralistic spiritualism, a form of realism built on the foundation of dualism.\n\nYoga school of Hinduism adopts the theory of Guṇa from Samkhya. Guṇas theory states that three \"gunas\" (innate tendency, attributes) are present in different proportions in all beings, and these three are \"sattva\" guna (goodness, constructive, harmonious), \"rajas\" guna (passion, active, confused), and \"tamas\" guna (darkness, destructive, chaotic). These three are present in every being but in different proportions, and the fundamental nature and psychological dispositions of beings is a consequence of the relative proportion of these three \"gunas\". When \"sattva\" guna predominates an individual, the qualities of lucidity, wisdom, constructiveness, harmonious, and peacefulness manifest themselves; when rajas is predominant, attachment, craving, passion-driven activity and restlessness manifest; and when tamas predominates in an individual, ignorance, delusion, destructive behavior, lethargy, and suffering manifests. The guṇas theory underpins the philosophy of mind in Yoga school of Hinduism.\n\nThe early scholars of Yoga philosophy, posits that the \"Puruṣa\" (consciousness) by its nature is sattva (constructive), while \"Prakriti\" (matter) by its nature is tamas (chaotic). It further posits that individuals at birth have \"buddhi\" (intelligence, sattvic). As life progresses and churns this \"buddhi\", it creates \"ahamkara\" (ego, rajasic). When ego in turn is churned by life, \"manas\" (temper, mood, tamasic) is produced. Together, \"buddhi\", \"ahamkara\" and \"manas\" interact and constitute \"citta\" (mind) in Yoga school of Hinduism. Unrestrained modification of \"citta\" causes suffering. A way of life that empowers one to become ever more aware of one's consciousness and spirituality innate in \"buddhi\", is the path to one's highest potential and a more serene, content, liberated life. Patanjali's Yoga sutra begins, in verse 2 of Book 1, by defining Yoga as \"restraining the \"Citta\" from \"Vrittis\".\"\n\nAxiology in the texts of Yoga school of Hindu philosophy include both a theory of values through the observances of positive values and avoidance of negative, as well as an aesthetic theory on bliss from intrinsic and extrinsic perspectives. The values to be observed are called Niyamas, while those to be avoided are called Yamas in Yoga philosophy.\n\nOver sixty different ancient and medieval era texts of Yoga philosophy discuss \"Yamas\" and \"Niyamas\". The specific theory and list of values varies between the texts, however, \"Ahimsa\", \"Satya\", \"Asteya\", \"Svādhyāya\", \"Kșhamā\", and \"Dayā\" are among the predominantly discussed ethical concepts by majority of these texts.\n\nThe five yamas listed by Patañjali in \"Yogasūtra\" 2.30 are:\n\n\nPatanjali, in Book 2, explains how and why each of the above self restraints help in the personal growth of an individual. For example, in verse II.35, Patanjali states that the virtue of nonviolence and non-injury to others (Ahimsa) leads to the abandonment of enmity, a state that leads the yogi to the perfection of inner and outer amity with everyone, everything. Other texts of the Yoga school of Hinduism include Kṣamā (क्षमा, forgiveness), Dhṛti (धृति, fortitude, non-giving up in adversity), Dayā (दया, compassion), Ārjava (आर्जव, non-hypocrisy) and Mitāhāra (मितहार, measured diet).\n\nThe \"Niyamas\" part of theory of values in the Yoga school include virtuous habits, behaviors and observances. The Yogasutra lists the niyamas as:\n\n\nAs with \"Yamas\", Patanjali explains how and why each of the above \"Niyamas\" help in the personal growth of an individual. For example, in verse II.42, Patanjali states that the virtue of contentment and acceptance of others as they are (Santoṣa) leads to the state where inner sources of joy matter most, and the craving for external sources of pleasant ceases. Other texts of the Yoga school expanded the list of values under \"Niyamas\", to include behaviors such as Āstika (आस्तिक, belief in personal God, faith in Self, conviction that there is knowledge in Vedas/Upanishads), Dāna (दान , charity, sharing with others), \"Hrī\" (ह्री, remorse and acceptance of one's past/mistakes/ignorance, modesty) \"Mati\" (मति, think and reflect, reconcile conflicting ideas) and \"Vrata\" (व्रत, resolutions and vows, fast, pious observances).\n\nYoga school of Hinduism holds that ignorance is the cause of suffering and saṁsāra. Liberation, like many other schools, is removal of ignorance, which is achieved through discriminative discernment, knowledge and self-awareness. The \"Yoga Sūtras\" is Yoga school's treatise on how to accomplish this. \"Samādhi\" is the state where ecstatic awareness develops, state Yoga scholars, and this is how one starts the process of becoming aware of Purusa and true Self. It further claims that this awareness is eternal, and once this awareness is achieved, a person cannot ever cease being aware; this is moksha, the soteriological goal in Hinduism.\n\nBook 3 of Patanjali's \"Yogasutra\" is dedicated to soteriological aspects of yoga philosophy. Patanjali begins by stating that all limbs of yoga are necessary foundation to reaching the state of self-awareness, freedom and liberation. He refers to the three last limbs of yoga as \"sanyama\", in verses III.4 to III.5, and calls it the technology for \"discerning principle\" and mastery of \"citta\" and self-knowledge. In verse III.12, the Yogasutras state that this discerning principle then empowers one to perfect \"sant\" (tranquility) and \"udita\" (reason) in one's mind and spirit, through intentness. This leads to one's ability to discern the difference between \"sabda\" (word), \"artha\" (meaning) and \"pratyaya\" (understanding), and this ability empowers one to compassionately comprehend the cry/speech of all living beings. Once a yogi reaches this state of \"sanyama\", it leads to unusual powers, intuition, self-knowledge, freedoms and kaivalya, the soteriological goal of the yogi.\n\nThe benefits of Yoga philosophy of Hinduism is then summarized in verses III.46 to III.55 of Yogasutras, stating that the first 5 limbs leads to bodily perfections such as beauty, loveliness, strength and toughness; while the last 3 limbs through \"sanyama\" leads to mind and psychological perfections of perceptiveness, one's nature, mastery over egoism, discriminative knowledge of purity, self and soul. This knowledge once reached is irreversible, states Yogasutra's Book IV.\n\nYoga philosophy allows the concept of God, unlike the closely related Samkhya school of Hinduism which is atheistic/non-theistic. Hindu scholars such as the 8th century Adi Sankara, as well many modern academic scholars describe the Yoga school as \"Samkya school with God.\"\n\nThe \"Yoga Sutras of Patanjali\" use the term \"Isvara\" in 11 verses: I.23 through I.29, II.1, II.2, II.32 and II.45. Ever since the Sutras' release, Hindu scholars have debated and commented on who or what is \"Isvara\". These commentaries range from defining \"Isvara\" as a \"personal god\" to a \"special self\" to \"anything that has spiritual significance to the individual\". Whicher explains that while Patanjali's terse verses can be interpreted both as theistic or non-theistic, Patanjali's concept of \"Isvara\" in Yoga philosophy functions as a \"transformative catalyst or guide for aiding the yogin on the path to spiritual emancipation\".\n\nPatanjali defines \"Isvara\" (Sanskrit: ईश्वर) in verse 24 of Book 1, as \"a special Self (पुरुषविशेष, \"puruṣa-viśeṣa\")\",\n\nSanskrit: \n– Yoga Sutras I.24\n\nThis sutra of Yoga philosophy of Hinduism adds the characteristics of \"Isvara\" as that special Self which is unaffected (अपरामृष्ट, \"aparamrsta\") by one's obstacles/hardships (क्लेश, \"klesha\"), one's circumstances created by the past or by one's current actions (कर्म, \"karma\"), one's life fruits (विपाक, \"vipâka\"), and one's psychological dispositions or intentions (आशय, ashaya).\n\nThe most studied ancient and medieval era texts of the Yoga school of philosophy include those by Patanjali, Bhaskara, Haribhadra (Jaina scholar), Bhoja, and Hemachandra.\n\nReferences to the teachings of the Yoga school of Hinduism abound in ancient Indian texts of other orthodox schools of Hinduism, for example, verse 5.2.17 of Vaisheshika Sutra by Kanada, belonging to the Vaisheshika school of Hinduism and dated to be from the 1st millennium BCE, states\n\nThe Nyāya Sūtras by Akshapada variously dated to be from 4th to 2nd century BCE, and belonging to the Nyaya school of Hinduism, in chapter 4.2 discusses the importance of Yoga philosophy as follows,\n\nThe Brahma Sutras by Badarayana dated to be from 5th century BCE to 2nd century BCE, belonging to the Vedanta school of Hinduism, in chapter 2 assumes the existence of a text called Yoga Smriti. Scholars contest whether this text was a precursor or the same as Patanjali's Yogasutra, but either premise is uncertain. The verses of Brahma Sutras assert that dualism of the prevailing Yoga philosophy is refuted, as the value of Yoga is as a means to realization of the Self, not in propositions about Self that is in conflict with the Vedic texts. Radhakrishnan translates the text as follows,\n\nThe Yoga Vasistha is a syncretic text on Yoga philosophy, variously dated to be from 6th- to 14th-century CE. It is structured as a dialogue between sage Vasistha of the Vedic era and the philosopher-king Rama of the Hindu epic Ramayana. The text synthesizes elements of Vedanta, Jainism, Yoga, Samkhya, Saiva Siddhanta and Mahayana Buddhism. Among other things, the text discusses Yoga philosophy in its various chapters. In section 6.1, Yoga Vasistha introduces Yoga as follows,\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7702313", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7702313", "title": "Yoga Vasistha", "text": "Yoga Vasistha\n\nYoga Vasistha (, IAST: \"\") is a philosophical text attributed to Valmiki, but the real author is unknown. The complete text contains over 29,000 verses. The short version of the text is called \"Laghu Yogavasistha\" and contains 6,000 verses. The exact century of its completion is unknown, but has been estimated to be somewhere between 6th-century to as late as 14th-century, but it is likely that a version of the text existed in the 1st millennium.\n\nThe text is named after sage Vasistha who is mentioned and revered in the seventh book of the Rigveda, and who was called as the first sage of the Vedanta school of Hindu philosophy by Adi Shankara. The text is structured as a discourse of sage Vasistha to Prince Rama. The text consists of six books. The first book presents Rama's frustration with the nature of life, human suffering and disdain for the world. The second describes, through the character of Rama, the desire for liberation and the nature of those who seek such liberation. The third and fourth books assert that liberation comes through a spiritual life, one that requires self-effort, and present cosmology and metaphysical theories of existence embedded in stories. These two books are known for emphasizing free will and human creative power. The fifth book discusses meditation and its powers in liberating the individual, while the last book describes the state of an enlightened and blissful Rama.\n\nYoga Vasistha teachings are structured as stories and fables, with a philosophical foundation similar to those found in Advaita Vedanta, is particularly associated with \"drsti-srsti\" subschool of Advaita which holds that the \"whole world of things is the object of mind\". The text is notable for expounding the principles of Maya and Brahman, as well as the principles of non-duality, and its discussion of Yoga. The short form of the text was translated into Persian by the 15th-century.\n\nYoga Vasistha is famous as one of the historically popular and influential texts of Hinduism. Other names of this text are Maha-Ramayana, Arsha Ramayana, Vasiṣṭha Ramayana, Yogavasistha-Ramayana and Jnanavasistha.\n\nThe name Vasistha in the title of the text refers to Rishi Vasistha. The term Yoga in the text refers to the underlying Yogic theme in its stories and dialogues, and the term is used in a generic sense to include all forms of yoga in the pursuit of liberation, in the style of Bhagavad Gita.\n\nThe long version of the text is called \"Brihat Yoga Vasistha\", wherein \"Brihat\" means \"great or large\". The short version of the text is called \"Laghu Yoga Vasishta\", wherein \"Laghu\" means \"short or small\". The longer version is also referred to simply as \"Yoga Vasistha\" and by numerous other names such as \"Vasiṣṭha Ramayana\".\n\nThe date or century of the text's composition or compilation is unknown, and variously estimated from the content and references it makes to other literature, other schools of Indian philosophies. Scholars agree that the surviving editions of the text were composed in the common era, but disagree whether it was completed in the first millennium or second. Estimates range, states Chapple, from \"as early as the sixth or seventh century, to as late as the fourteenth century\".\n\nThe surviving text mentions Vijnanavada and Madhyamika schools of Buddhism by name, suggesting that the corresponding sections were composed after those schools were established, or about 5th-century. The translation of a version of the text in 14th- to 15th-century into Persian, has been the basis of the other limit, among scholars such as Farquhar in 1922.\n\nAtreya in 1935 suggested that the text must have preceded Gaudapada and Adi Shankara, because it does not use their terminology, but does mention many Buddhist terms. Dasgupta, a contemporary of Atreya, states that the text includes verses of earlier text, such as its III.16.50 is identical to one found in Kalidasa's Kumarasambhava, thus the text must be placed after the 5th-century. Dasgupta adds that the philosophy and ideas presented in Yoga Vasistha mirror those of found in Advaita Vedanta of Adi Shankara, but neither mention the other, which probably means that the author(s) of Yoga Vasistha were scholars who lived in the same century as Shankara, placing the text in about 7th- to early 8th-century. The shorter summary version of the text is attributed to the Kashmiri scholar Abhinanda, who has been variously dated to have lived in 9th- or 10th-century.\n\nMainkar states that Yoga Vasistha probably evolved over time. The first work, states Mainkar, was the original ancient work of Vasistha that was an Upanishad with Brahamanical ideas, a work that is lost. This text was, suggests Mainkar, was expanded into \"Moksopaya\" in or after 6th-century, which is now commonly known as \"Laghu-Yogavasistha\". The \"Laghu\" (shorter) version was then expanded into the full editions, over time, in the centuries that followed the completion of \"Laghu-Yogavasistha\". The syncretic incorporation of Buddhism and Hinduism ideas happened in the \"Laghu-Yogavasistha\" edition, states Mainkar, while ideas from Kashmiri Shaivism, particularly the Trika school, were added to the growing version by the 12th-century. Similar serial expansion, revisions and interpolation is typical in Indian literature. Peter Thomi has published additional evidence in support Mainkar's theory on Yoga Vasistha's chronology.\n\nThe oldest surviving manuscript of the \"Moksopaya\" (or \"Moksopaya Shastra\") has been dated to have been composed in Srinagar in the 10th century AD.\n\nThe text is traditionally attributed to Valmiki, the author of Ramayana. Scholars seriously doubt the larger version of the text was authored by Valmiki, and consider the attribution as a mark of modest respect and reverence for him in the Hindu tradition by the actual unknown author(s) or compiler(s).\n\nThe author of the shorter version, the \"Laghu-Yogavasistha\", is generally considered to be Abhinanda of Kashmir.\n\nThe text exists in many editions of manuscripts with varying number of verses, but similar message. The full editions contain over 29,000, to a few with 32,000 verses, and in some editions about 36,000 verses. An abridged version by Abhinanda of Kashmir (son of Jayanta Bhatta) is \"Laghu\" (\"Little\") \"Yogavasistha\" and contains 6,000 verses.\n\nThe verses of Yoga Vasistha are structured in the genre of ancient Indian literature, called \"Grantha\". In this genre, each Shloka (verse) in the text is designed to equal 32 syllables, while conveying its message. A Grantha can be sung and depending on its meter, set to specific Raga music. This genre is found in Bhakti movement literature, and Yoga Vasistha's Advaita theories and monism influenced the Grantha literature of Sikhism, whose primary scripture is called \"Guru Granth Sahib\".\n\nThe \"Yoga Vasistha\" is a syncretic work, containing elements of Vedanta, Yoga, Samkhya, Saiva Siddhanta, Jainism and Mahayana Buddhism, thus making it, according to Chapple, \"a Hindu text \"par excellence\", including, as does Hinduism, a mosaic-style amalgam of diverse and sometimes opposing traditions\".\n\nThe text consists of six books:\n\nThe Nirnaya Sagar version of Yoga Vasistha manuscript has 1146 verses in the first Book, 807 in second, 6304 verses in third, 2414 verses in the fourth book, 4322 in the fifth, while the last is longest with 14296 verses, for a cumulative total of 29,289 verses.\n\nThis is one of the longest Hindu texts in Sanskrit after the \"Mahabharata\", and an important text of Yoga. It consists of numerous short stories and anecdotes used to help illustrate its ideas and message. The text shows the influence of Advaita Vedanta and Saivite Trika school. In terms of Hindu mythology, the conversation in the Yoga Vasishta is placed chronologically before the \"Ramayana\".\n\nThe traditional belief is that reading this book leads to spiritual liberation. The conversation between Vasistha and Prince Rama is that between a great, enlightened sage and a seeker of liberation. The text discusses consciousness, cosmology, nature of the universe and consciousness, the ultimate dissolution of body, the liberation of the soul and the non-dual nature of existence.\n\nThe Yoga Vasistha states that there are four characteristics that mark someone ready for spiritual journey who: \n\n\n\"Yoga Vasistha\" teachings are divided into six parts: dispassion, qualifications of the seeker, creation, existence, dissolution and liberation. It sums up the spiritual process in the seven \"Bhoomikas\":\n\nIn Chapter 2 of Book VI, titled as \"The story of Iksvaku\", the text explains the state of nirvana (liberation) as follows, \"Liberation is peace. Liberation is extinction of all conditioning. Liberation is freedom from every kind of physical, psychological and psychic distress. This world is not seen by the ignorant and the wise in the same light. To one who has attained self-knowledge, this world does not appear as samsara, but as the one infinite and indivisible consciousness\".\n\nThe Yoga Vasistha describes the \"Jivanmukta\", or liberated person, as follows (abridged from the 1896 translation by KN Aiyer):\n\nThe Yoga Vasistha describes samsara and reality as follows:\n\nThe following traditional Sanskrit commentaries on the Yoga Vasistha are extant:\n\n\"Yoga Vasistha\" is considered one of the most important texts of the Vedantic philosophy.\n\nThe text, states David Gordon White, has served as a reference on Yoga for medieval era Advaita Vedanta scholars. The Yoga Vasistha, adds White, was one of the popular texts on Yoga that dominated the Indian Yoga culture scene before the 12th-century.\n\nIndian freedom fighter Vinayak Damodar Savarkar has praised Yoga Vasistha. Quotes from his Autobiography \"My Transportation For Life\":\n\nThe practice of \"atma-vichara\", \"self-enquiry,\" described in the \"Yoga Vasistha\", has been popularised due to the influence of Ramana Maharshi, who was strongly influenced by this text.\n\nOriginally written in Sanskrit, the \"Yoga Vasistha\" has been translated into many Indian languages, and the stories are told to children in various forms.\n\n\nDuring the Mughal Dynasty the text was translated into Persian several times, as ordered by Akbar, Jahangir and Darah Shikuh. One of these translations was undertaken by Nizam al-Din Panipati in the late sixteenth century AD. This translation, known as the \"Jug-Basisht\", which has since became popular in Persia among intellectuals interested in Indo-Persian culture. The Safavid-era mystic Mir Findiriski (d. 1641) commented on selected passages of \"Jug-Basisht\".\n\nThe unabridged text is currently being translated into Russian and published by Swamini Vidyananda Saraswati, first five books are completed by 2017.\n\n\"Yoga Vasistha\" was translated into English by Swami Jyotirmayananda, Swami Venkatesananda, Vidvan Bulusu Venkateswaraulu and Vihari Lal Mitra. K. Naryanaswami Aiyer translated the well-known abridged version, \"Laghu-Yoga-Vasistha\". In 2009, Swami Tejomayananda's \"Yoga Vasistha Sara Sangrah\" was published by the Central Chinmaya Mission Trust. In this version the \"Laghu-Yoga-Vasistha\" has been condensed to 86 verses, arranged into seven chapters.\n\nYoga Vasistha was translated in 2018, from English into portuguese by Eleonora Meier for Satsang Editora (brazilian publisher) of the version of Swami Venkatesananda and it is available at www.lojasatsangeditora.com.br - - Páginas: 848 Swami Venkatesananda.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
