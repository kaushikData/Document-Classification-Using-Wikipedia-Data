Names for the implementation of this theory in policy include universal basic capital and stakeholding, and are generally synonymous within the equal opportunity egalitarian framework.\n\nThe idea has been around since Thomas Paine (January 29, 1737 – June 8, 1809) in his work \"Agrarian Justice\" 1795, and complemented his other thesis of basic income.\n\nTwo independent schools of thought were developed on the subject, involving individuals from the American Labour Movement and scholars of the Belgian School. However, the same reasoning (given by both schools) behind the basic capital proposal is the redistribution of wealth usually funded by an inheritance tax in order to provide a universal and unconditional sum of money (or capital assets) at the age of majority. From most authors, the intention was to create a nominal grant for everyone based on a deserved natural inheritance of the earth.\n\nIn the policy format, asset-based egalitarianism is usually seen as the opposite policy proposal of Philippe Van Parijs and his thesis of basic income, but asset-based egalitarian proposals have received less academic attention. However, more recently the wave of third way politics has seen much more emphasis placed on responsibility and equality of opportunity and has reopened an old debate.\n\nSome famous recent work on the policy efficaciousness of universal basic capital or asset-based egalitarianism has been conducted by Bruce Ackerman and Anne Alstott in \"The Stakeholder Society\". In this policy proposal, the method of funding the 'stake' was by means of a wealth tax and provides a sum of $80,000 for those reaching the age of majority.\n\nIn actual policy, Gordon Brown and the British Labour Party initiated the United Kingdom Child Trust Fund, while in the United States the idea has been implemented in the form of Individual Development Accounts and argued for by Michael Sherraden. These remain the nearest practical examples.\n\nOne of the motivations of the related policy such as the Child Trust Fund is clear from this excerpt:\n\nAsset-based egalitarian policies, such as the Ackerman and Alstott proposals, are often criticised as not being egalitarian. Due to different people having different abilities and talents to utilise financial wealth, there is always a risk that those without formal financial education would alienate their own freedom by dissipating their capital or \"stakeblowing\". Stuart White argued that unless education corrected for this, there would be an inegalitarian outcome, as people fundamentally have different asset-management capacities.

Metzger\n\nBruce Manning Metzger (February 9, 1914 – February 13, 2007) was an American biblical scholar, Bible translator and textual critic who was a longtime professor at Princeton Theological Seminary and Bible editor who served on the board of the American Bible Society and United Bible Societies. He was a scholar of Greek, New Testament, and New Testament textual criticism, and wrote prolifically on these subjects. Metzger is one of the most influential New Testament scholars of the 20th century.\n\nMetzger was born in Middletown, Pennsylvania, and earned his BA (1935) at Lebanon Valley College. Metzger had strong academic training in Greek before enrolling in Princeton Seminary, and in the summer prior to entering the Seminary, he completed reading through the entire Bible consecutively for the twelfth time. He received his ThB in 1938 at Princeton Theological Seminary, and in the autumn of 1938 began teaching at Princeton as a Teaching Fellow in New Testament Greek. On April 11, 1939, he was ordained in the United Presbyterian Church of North America, which has since merged and is now known as the Presbyterian Church (USA). In 1940, he earned his MA from Princeton University and became an instructor in New Testament. Two years later, he earned his PhD (\"Studies in a Greek Gospel Lectionary (Greg. 303)\"), also from Princeton University.\n\nIn 1944, Metzger married Isobel Elizabeth Mackay, daughter of the third president of the Seminary, John A. Mackay. That year, he was promoted to Assistant Professor. In 1948, he became Associate Professor, and full Professor in 1954. In 1964, Metzger was named the George L. Collord Professor of New Testament Language and Literature. In 1971, he was elected president of both the Studiorum Novi Testamenti Societas and the Society of Biblical Literature. The following year, he became president of the North American Patristic Society. Metzger was visiting fellow at Clare Hall, Cambridge in 1974 and Wolfson College, Oxford in 1979. In 1978 he was elected corresponding fellow of the British Academy, the Academy's highest distinction for persons who are not residents in the United Kingdom. At the age of seventy, after teaching at Princeton Theological Seminary for a period of forty-six years, he retired as Professor Emeritus. In 1994, Bruce Metzger was honoured with the Burkitt Medal for Biblical Studies by the British Academy. He was awarded honorary doctorates from Lebanon Valley College, the Findlay College, the University of St Andrews, the University of Münster and Potchefstroom University. \"Metzger's unrivaled knowledge of the relevant languages, ancient and modern; his balanced judgment; and his painstaking attention to detail won him respect across the theological and academic spectrum.\" Conservative evangelical scholar Daniel B. Wallace described Metzger as \"a fine, godly, conservative scholar, although his view of biblical authority is not quite the same as many other evangelicals.\"\n\nShortly after his 93rd birthday, Metzger died in Princeton, New Jersey. He was survived by his wife Isobel and their two sons, John Mackay Metzger and James Bruce Metzger.\n\nMetzger edited and provided commentary for many Bible translations and wrote dozens of books. He was an editor of the United Bible Societies' standard Greek New Testament, the starting point for nearly all recent New Testament translations. In 1952, he became a contributor to the Revised Standard Version (RSV) of the Bible, and was general editor of the \"Reader's Digest Bible\" (a condensed version of the RSV) in 1982. From 1977 to 1990, he chaired the Committee on Translators for the New Revised Standard Version (NRSV) of the Bible and was \"largely responsible for ... seeing [the NRSV] through the press.\" He considered it a privilege to present the NRSV—which includes the books referred to as Apocrypha by Protestants, though Roman Catholics and Eastern Orthodox consider them deuterocanonical—to Pope John Paul II and Patriarch Demetrius I of Constantinople.\n\nCentral to his scholarly contribution to New Testament studies is his trilogy: \"The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption, and Restoration\" (1964; 2nd ed., 1968; 3d enlarged ed., 1992); \"The Early Versions of the New Testament: Their Origin, Transmission, and Limitations\" (1977); \"The Canon of the New Testament: Its Origin, Development, and Significance\" (1987). The first volume of a series that he founded and edited, \"New Testament Tools and Studies,\" appeared in 1960.\n\nMetzger's commentaries often utilize historical criticism and higher criticism, which attempt to explain the literary and historical origins of the Bible and the biblical canon. For instance, Metzger argues that the early church which assembled the New Testament did not consider divine inspiration to be a sufficient criterion for a book to be placed in the canon. Metzger says that the early church saw it as very important that a work describing Jesus' life be written by a follower of or an eyewitness to Jesus, and considered other works such as \"The Shepherd\" of Hermas and the \"Epistles of Clement\" to be inspired but not canonical.\n\nIn discussing the canon, Metzger identifies three criteria “for acceptance of particular writings as sacred, authoritative, and worthy of being read in services of worship…”, criteria which were “generally adopted during the course of the second century, and were never modified thereafter”, namely, orthodoxy (conformity to the rule of faith), apostolicity, and consensus among the churches. He concludes that, “In the most basic sense neither individuals nor councils created the canon; instead they came to recognize and acknowledge the self-authenticating quality of these writings, which imposed themselves as canonical upon the church.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "37610415", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37610415", "title": "Carlos Cossio", "text": "Carlos Cossio\n\nCarlos Cossio (San Miguel de Tucuman, February 3, 1903 - Buenos Aires, August 24, 1987) was a militant university reformer, jurist, lawyer, legal philosopher and teacher in Argentina. One of his most important works is the concept of the Egological Theory of Law.\n\nCossio had his primary and secondary education in Tucumán, then moved to Buenos Aires to study at the Faculty of Law of the University of Buenos Aires, where he joined the university reform movement, being one of the leaders of the Student Center. He completed his doctoral thesis on the topic of \"The University Reform and the Problem of the New Generation,\" published in 1927.\n\nFrom 1934 to 1948, he taught at the National University of La Plata where he began to develop his theories on egological law. In 1948, he took over the Chair of Philosophy of Law at the University of Buenos Aires, where he finished the definition of his original conception of law. He was surrounded by a large group of followers and disciples, including Ambrose Lucas Gioja, Julio Cesar Cueto Rua, Genaro Carrió, José Vilanova, Daniel Herrendorf, Enrique Aftalion, and Carlos Spini, who formed the \"Argentina Legal School.\" During this time, his recognition and prestige reached a level never imagined before. His definition of law as \"interference intersubjective behaviors\" brought him into a controversy with Hans Kelsen, creator of the Pure Theory of Law, at the same law school in Buenos Aires in 1949.\n\nIn 1956, he had to leave his chair forced by the military government because of his alleged sympathy for the Peronists, and it was only in 1973 when he could return thanks to the efforts of his friend and disciple, Julio Raffo. The military and its supporters largely destroyed the strength of the \"Argentina Law School\" and its potential for expansion. The liberal bourgeoisie and the political right never forgave their fidelity to their independent judgment and the fact that they never belonged to a political party, but ardently defended their ideas and proposals. Cossio did respond to an official survey on the then possible constitutional reform that materialized in 1949. While many of his colleagues avoided to comment by pretending to be distracted during the military dictatorships of General Juan Carlos Ongania and Jorge Rafael Videla, the old professor spoke from the podium and repudiated the human rights crimes.\n\nHis major work is Ideology and Law, developed from the concept of phenomenology of judgment, the judge's process of interpretation and understanding of the law, and the ideological and class backgrounds of liberal capitalist law. In his early thesis in \"The Law\" magazine, Cossio explained that what judges do affects everyone and what they do remains hidden, both for themselves as for who are \"secured\" by their decisions. \"We are all involved in what judges do, good or bad, and not just for what might be perceived at first glance\", Cossio says, \"but much more because all of them, day by day and hour by hour, they do something for the right wing or the left wing, and also for democracy or totalitarianism, gravitating over the social life specifically, as agents of the law\". Those judges often ignore the scope of their duties because the said contribution being something more vivid than a thought, is on the basis of the situation that those agents of the law defend, a situation inevitably referred to the leading social structures\".\n\nCossio accepted the Pure Theory of Law of Hans Kelsen, and made it part of his own theory. However, the tension between the two visions was always present. Cossio accepted positive law, but did not accept the mechanistic normativism as the object of legal science. Cossio distinguished himself by demonstrating that law should be understood and interpreted by a theory of knowledge regarding human behavior in intersubjective interference. It was not just about ideal legal subjects (normativism mechanistic) but about people, real human beings: \"the right as human behavior.\"\n\nCossio's work asserted that, \"The judge looks at the law and not as conclusive as fact, but as something that is constantly making its living character of human life.\"\n\nHis work, unlike his skeptics', was translated into French, Yugoslav, German, Polish, Portuguese, Finnish, Swedish, and other languages. In 1986 he received the Konex Award for his development of the Humanities in Argentina. \n\nThe egological theory of law is one of the most outstanding expressions of the Latin American cultural movement influenced by the university reform. Its main followers are Daniel Herrendorf (Luxemburg), Albert Brimo (Paris) and Julio Cesar Cueto Rua (Buenos Aires).\n\nIts development appeared in his book entitled \"The egological theory of law and the legal concept of freedom,\" whose first edition was published in 1944, and twenty years later, a second edition was published by the printer Abeledo-Perrot, a traditional legal publisher in Buenos Aires, Argentina.\nHis ideas took shape around 1941 and drew from Edmund Husserl, the last great classical philosopher, and delved into Kant, Martin Heidegger and Hans Kelsen. Husserl used the theory of objects (regional ontologies) acts theory and difference, butt, Kantian root, between formal legal logic and transcendental legal logic. Cossio's contribution was a legal philosophy of science that struck alike the religious mood of Thomistic natural law and legal positivism from the nineteenth century, renovated by the technical-legal. Parthian positive law with Cossian construction shelved the mechanistic normativism as an object of legal science to study the right understanding and interpreting by a theory of knowledge about human behavior in intersubjective interference. Cossio said that the philosophy of law should be studied from the dogmatic science of law and that science was a kind of knowledge crucial for philosophical reflection.\nIn this work, he drew back the veil on the ideological background capitalistic conceptions of Hans Kelsen's formal logic. Cossio said: 'Kelsen corresponds to a capitalist world and placed on the defensive from the seats of the State in a bourgeois Europe, undifferentiated, and therefore legal scrutiny should not be discussed political power and so their ideas can spread geographically that of Savigny; finally socially conservative groups are those that have been interpreted by those jurists who, as Gény or Kantorowicz, have spoken and continue to speak of 'a resurrection of the eternal natural law.' Later he added: 'criminal liberalism has proclaimed to all the winds that would offend inability associations. As its specific crime is unspeakable enrichment and as are the capitalists who are associated to enrich, obvious their interest to leave unpunished a crime that only they can practically commit '. Cossio concluded saying: \"In short: the critical history of the legal conceptions, the errors tematizarlas as a criminal ideology Karl Marx. In this case scientific ideologies lead us to thematize them as an epistemology of error.\n\n\"Egologic\" is a word which the author explains in a previous work \"The Theory egological law: Their problem and its problems\", also appeared under the printer Abeledo-Perrot in Buenos Aires in 1963. In his own words: \"It seems appropriate to an illustrious parallel in order to understand our language:\" Phenomenology\", composed voice of phenomenon and logos, meaning knowledge of phenomena. But Hegel, reversing the priority of voices components, used to signify the logos phenomenalization and this logo on your system the absolute spirit. And we know that Husserl investment has remained Hegelian significance, except that the logos for him, is the being of entities. Therefore for Husserl, phenomenology means phenomenalization of the being of entities. Similarly, egology in egological theory of law, is the meaning of egolization of legal logos, ie egolization of being legal (given the phenomenological equivalence between the logos and be). And there is talk that the transcendental ego is the action, \"I act\" of any action in instead of \"I think\" all judgment, \"I act\" of behavior instead of \"I think\" the intellect, with egology phenomenalization We could mean as being legal conduct.\"\n\nThe synthesis of thought can be expressed egological in the following propositions: a) the right to conduct interference is intersubjective; b) the law considers all human actions; c) the right is interested in the human act in its unity, d) the right implies the possibility of acts of force; e) freedom is the right content ineliminable f) legal norms conceptualize interference behavior intersubjective g) legal rules and penalties are charged disjunctive judgments, differing from [Hans Kelsen] understanding that the standard was a hypothetical judgment.\n\nThe relevance of the theory in the field egological the right can be seen the significant fact that the Austrian jurist Hans Kelsen visited in 1949 the University of Buenos Aires in Argentina and engaged in a famous debate with him:\n\nHis controversy with Kelsen was reproduced in the book \"Theory egological and pure theory.\" During Kelsen's visit to Argentina, in 1951, Cossio said the physicalist metaphysics he hid static and dynamic traffic Viennese Professor pretemático who performed at that point, between the representative-level conceptual and intuitive plane-real. Probably not worked the work of French Michel Foucault, by the way of intuition in knowledge, but went ahead with these ideas applied to the philosophy of science of law, to the French. This allowed him to dabble in the activity of the judge and make a phenomenological description of the court judgment. Among the elements of the sentence, Cossio recognized three aspects:\n\na) Legal Structure: the law given a priori;\nb) Representations contingent: no insults circumstances\nand c) Experience of Judge: Legal assessment.\n\nIt was not idealist-metaphysical aspects (normativism mechanistic) but people, real human beings (the right as human behavior). Thus the normative logic was inserted in plenary life without losing its significant role. The first judge's immanence in the law, is 'strictly ontic' as concerns the being of things described. So Cossio says that the judicial creation of the judge's ruling requires meaningful behavior. The judicial creation of the judgment by the judge makes do with evidence that this is not a separate entity and foreign law. 'The judge said Cossio-watching law and not as conclusive as fact, but as something that is constantly making its living character of human life' and added: 'The judicial function is a real analytic a priori within the notion of a logic of what should be '.\nIn the last years of his life, during the years of the military dictatorship (1976 - 1983), participated with Ernesto Giudice in the dissemination activities organized by the University Reform Fundación Juan B. Right.\nSeparation from their chairs Cossio not prevent him from thinking but I felt a great pain for not being able to collaborate in the formation of law students. He received awards, was recognized abroad, served as co-director of the Revue Internationale du Droit of Theorie, managing to form a huge galaxy of legal discípulos.ción.\n\n\n"}

It is a variation of realism (independently proposed by Stanford School philosophers Nancy Cartwright and Ian Hacking in 1983) that restricts warranted belief to only certain entities.\n\nWhereas traditional scientific realism argues that our best scientific theories are true, or approximately true, or closer to the truth than their predecessors, entity realism does not commit itself to judgments concerning the truth of scientific theories. Instead, entity realism claims that the theoretical entities that feature in scientific theories, e.g. 'electrons', should be regarded as real if and only if they refer to phenomena that can be routinely used to create effects in domains that can be investigated independently. 'Manipulative success' thus becomes the criterion by which to judge the reality of (typically unobservable) scientific entities. As Ian Hacking, the main proponent of this formulation of entity realism, puts it (referring to an experiment he observed in a Stanford laboratory, where electrons and positrons were sprayed, one after the other, onto a superconducting metal sphere), \"if you can spray them, then they are real.\"\n\nEntity realism has been an influential position partly because it coincided with a general trend in philosophy of science, and science studies more generally, to downplay the role of theories and put more emphasis on experimentation and scientific practice. Thus, entity realism sometimes is also called instrumental realism or experimental realism.\n\nWhile many philosophers acknowledge the intuitive pull of entity realism, it has also been strongly (some would say: conclusively) criticised, both as being too restrictive (in that it ignores entities that are observable yet do not lend themselves to manipulation) and as being too permissive (to the extent that seemingly successful instances of manipulation may turn out to be spurious).\n\nStathis Psillos remarks that entity realism is indeed a realist position (since it defends the reality of unobservable entities), but it is a selective realist position, since \"it restricts warranted belief to entities only, and suggests to fellow realists that they are wrong in claiming that the theoretical descriptions of these entities are approximately true.\" Psillos also remarks that to a certain extent \"this scepticism about theories is motivated by none other than the argument from the pessimistic induction\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1928686", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1928686", "title": "Etheric body", "text": "Etheric body\n\nThe etheric body, ether-body, æther body, a name given by neo-Theosophy to a vital body or subtle body propounded in esoteric philosophies as the first or lowest layer in the \"human energy field\" or aura. It is said to be in immediate contact with the physical body, to sustain it and connect it with \"higher\" bodies.\n\nThe English term \"etheric\" in this context seems to derive from the Theosophical writings of Madame Blavatsky, but its use was formalised by C.W. Leadbeater and Annie Besant due to the elimination of Hindu terminology from the system of seven planes and bodies. (Adyar School of Theosophy).\n\nThe term gained some general popularity after the 1914-18 war, Walter John Kilner having adopted it for a layer of the \"human atmosphere\" which, as he claimed in a popular book, could be rendered visible to the naked eye by means of certain exercises.\n\nThe classical element Aether of Platonic and Aristotlean physics continued in Victorian scientific proposals of a Luminiferous ether as well as the cognate chemical substance ether. According to Theosophists and Alice Bailey the etheric body inhabits an etheric plane which corresponds to the four higher subplanes of the physical plane. The intended reference is therefore to some extremely rarefied matter, analogous in usage to the word \"spirit\" (originally \"breath\"). In selecting it as the term for a clearly defined concept in an Indian-derived metaphysical system, the Theosophists aligned it with ideas such as the prana-maya-kosha (sheath made of prana, subtle breath or life-force) of Vedantic thought.\n\nIn popular use it is often confounded with the related concept of the astral body as for example in the term astral projection - the early Theosophists had called it the \"astral double\". Others prefer to speak of the \"lower and higher astral\".\n\nLinga sarira is a Sanskrit term for the invisible double of the human body, the etheric body or etheric double (or astral body in some Theosophical concepts). It is one of the seven principles of the human being, according to Theosophical philosophy.\n\nRudolf Steiner, the founder of Anthroposophy, often referred to the etheric body (\"Ätherleib\" or \"Life Body\") in association with the etheric formative forces and the evolution of man and the cosmos. According to him, it can be perceived by a person gifted with clairvoyance as being of \"peach-blossom color\".\n\nSteiner considered the etheric reality or life principle as quite distinct from the physical material reality, being intermediate between the physical world and the astral or soul world.\nThe etheric body can be characterised as the life force also present in the plant kingdom. It maintains the physical body's form until death. At that time, it separates from the physical body and the physical reverts to natural disintegration.\n\nAccording to Max Heindel's Rosicrucian writings, the etheric body, composed of four ethers, is called the \"Vital Body\" since the ether is the way of ingress for vital force from the Sun and the field of agencies in nature which promote such vital activities as assimilation, growth, and propagation. It is an exact counterpart of our physical body, molecule for molecule, and organ for organ, but it is of the opposite polarity. It is slightly larger, extending about one and one-half inches beyond the periphery of the physical body.\n\nSamael Aun Weor teaches that the vital body is the tetra-dimensional part of the physical body and the foundation of organic life. He states that in the second Initiation of Fire, which is reached through working with sexual magic with a spouse, the Kundalini rises in the vital body. Then the initiate learns how to separate the two superior ethers from the others in order for them to serve as a vehicle to travel out of the physical body.\n\nOn the Tree of Life of the Kabbalah, the vital body is often related to the sephirah Yesod.\n\nIn the teachings of Theosophy, Devas are regarded as living either in the atmospheres of the planets of the solar system (\"Planetary Angels\") or inside the Sun (\"Solar Angels\") (presumably other planetary systems and stars have their own angels) and they help to guide the operation of the processes of nature such as the process of evolution and the growth of plants; their appearance is reputedly like colored flames about the size of a human being. It is believed by Theosophists that devas can be observed when the third eye is activated. Some (but not most) devas originally incarnated as human beings.\n\nIt is believed by Theosophists that nature spirits, elementals (gnomes, ondines, sylphs, and salamanders), and fairies can also be observed when the third eye is activated. It is maintained by Theosophists that these less evolutionarily developed beings have never been previously incarnated as human beings; they are regarded as on a separate line of spiritual evolution called the “deva evolution”; eventually, as their souls advance as they reincarnate, it is believed they will incarnate as devas.\n\nIt is asserted by Theosophists that all of the above-mentioned beings possess etheric bodies (but no physical bodies) that are composed of \"etheric matter\", a type of matter finer and more pure that is composed of smaller particles than ordinary physical plane matter.

{"id": "1504970", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1504970", "title": "Exclusionary rule", "text": "Exclusionary rule\n\nIn the United States, the exclusionary rule is a legal rule, based on constitutional law. The rule prevents evidence collected or analyzed in violation of the defendant's constitutional rights from being used in a court of law. This may be considered an example of a prophylactic rule formulated by the judiciary in order to protect a constitutional right. The exclusionary rule may also, in some circumstances at least, be considered to follow directly from the constitutional language, such as the Fifth Amendment's command that no person \"shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself\" and that no person \"shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law\".\n\n\"The exclusionary rule is grounded in the Fourth Amendment and it is intended to protect citizens from illegal searches and seizures.\" The exclusionary rule is also designed to provide a remedy and disincentive, which is short of criminal prosecution in response to prosecutors and police who illegally gather evidence in violation of the Fifth Amendment in the Bill of Rights compelled to self-incrimination. The exclusionary rule also protects against violations of the Sixth Amendment, which guarantees the right to counsel.\n\nMost states also have their own exclusionary remedies for illegally obtained evidence under their state constitutions and/or statutes, some of which predate the federal constitutional guarantees against unlawful searches and seizures and compelled self-incrimination.\n\nThis rule is occasionally referred to as a legal technicality because it allows defendants a defense that does not address whether the crime was actually committed. In this respect, it is similar to the explicit rule in the Fifth Amendment protecting people from double jeopardy.\nIn strict cases, when an illegal action is used by police/prosecution to gain any incriminating result, \"all\" evidence whose recovery stemmed from the illegal action—this evidence is known as \"fruit of the poisonous tree\"—can be thrown out from a jury (or be grounds for a mistrial if too much information has been irrevocably revealed).\n\nThe exclusionary rule applies to all persons within the United States regardless of whether they are citizens, immigrants (legal or illegal), or visitors.\n\nUp until the independence of the United States, the courts of England excluded self-incriminating evidence that was provided as a result of official compulsion, regardless of its reliability. In 1769, Lord Chief Justice Mansfield explained as follows:\n\nChief Justice Mansfield also explained that \"If any evidence or confession has been extorted from her, it will be of no prejudice to her on the trial.\" Additionally, a defendant could sue to suppress and regain possession of at least some types of illegally seized evidence, in a common law action for replevin.\n\nHowever, in the 1783 case of \"Ceglinski v. Orr\", the English courts declined to suppress evidence obtained by illegal coercion. In the \"Warickshall\" case, evidence was gathered as a result of an involuntary confession, and the court held that the evidence (but not the confession itself) could be admitted. It is questionable whether the \"Warickshall\" rule became known in the United States before 1789 (when the U.S. Bill of Rights was written), and whether it applied to confessions obtained by both governmental and private parties. In any event, no decision by the Supreme Court of the United States has ever endorsed the \"Warickshall\" rule as a constitutional matter.\n\nGenerally speaking, English law before 1789 did not provide as strong an exclusionary rule as the one that later developed under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, regarding unlawful searches and seizures. The Fourth Amendment, after all, was partly a reaction against English law including the general warrant and the writs of assistance.\n\nIn the 1886 case of \"Boyd v. United States\", the U.S. Supreme Court addressed compulsory production of business papers, and the Court excluded those papers based on a combination of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments. \"Boyd\" was closely limited to its facts, and several years later the Court stated that the Fourth Amendment does not extend to \"excluding testimony\" about wrongful searches and seizures.\n\nIn 1897, the U.S. Supreme Court held, in \"Bram v. United States\", that involuntary confessions are inadmissible as evidence. The Court in \"Bram\" did not announce a strong version of the exclusionary rule that would apply uniformly to exclude all evidence gathered in violation of the Bill of Rights, but instead announced a weak version that excluded only self-incriminating testimony that was compelled in violation of the Fifth Amendment. The distinction between testimonial versus other self-incriminating evidence is a matter of continuing debate.\n\nBefore a strong version of the exclusionary rule was addressed and adopted by the federal courts, it had already been adopted by at least one state court, namely the Iowa Supreme Court, as that court would later describe:\n\nIn 1914, the U.S. Supreme Court announced a strong version of the exclusionary rule, in the case of \"Weeks v. United States\", under the Fourth Amendment prohibiting unreasonable searches and seizures. This decision, however, created the rule only on the federal level. The \"\"Weeks\" rule,\" which made an exception for cases at the state level, was adopted by numerous states at a time during prohibition. In adopting the rule, actions by states often reflected attitudes towards prohibition, which was enacted by adoption of the Eighteenth Amendment and was enforced through the Volstead Act. Concerns about privacy violations also extended to other instances where criminal sanctions were permitted for \"victimless\" crime, such as illegal gambling or narcotics violations.\n\nIn 1920, the U.S. Supreme Court adopted the \"fruit of the poisonous tree\" doctrine in the case of \"Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States\". The Court stated that allowing evidence gathered as an indirect result of an unconstitutional search and seizure \"reduces the Fourth Amendment to a form of words\".\n\n\"Wolf v. Colorado\" ruled that states were not required to adopt the exclusionary rule. Despite the ruling, some states adopted the exclusionary rule. In 1955, the Supreme Court of California ruled in \"People v. Cahan\" that the exclusionary rule applied for cases in the state of California. By 1960, 22 states had adopted the rule without substantial qualifications: California, Delaware, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Washington, Texas, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming. Michigan also had an exclusionary rule, but with limitations for some narcotics and firearms evidence. In Alabama, Maryland, and South Dakota, the exclusionary rule applied in some situations.\n\nIt was not until \"Mapp v. Ohio\" in 1961 that the exclusionary rule was also held to be binding on the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, which guarantees due process. Up until \"Mapp\", the exclusionary rule had been rejected by most states.\n\nIn 2016, Utah v. Strieff dealt with the exclusionary rule and outstanding warrants and was viewed to be generally favorable towards police.\n\nThe exclusionary rule does not apply in a civil case, in a grand jury proceeding, or in a parole revocation hearing.\n\nEven in a criminal case, the exclusionary rule does not simply bar the introduction of all evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth, Fifth, or Sixth Amendment. In \"Hudson v. Michigan\", Justice Scalia wrote for the U.S. Supreme Court:\n\nLimitations on the exclusionary rule have included the following:\n\nThe exclusionary rule is not applicable to non-U.S. nationals residing outside of U.S. borders. In \"United States v. Alvarez-Machain\", the U.S. Supreme Court decided that property owned by aliens in a foreign country is admissible in court. Certain persons in the U.S. receive limited protections, such as prisoners, probationers, parolees, and persons crossing U.S. borders. Corporations, by virtue of being, also have limited rights under the Fourth Amendment (see corporate personhood).\n\nIn the case of Florida v. Jimeno it was found that the evidence found to convict Jimeno, although at first was not admissible, later was found to in fact be admissible since it passed the test of reasonable standards. The defendant consented to a search of his car, and when the officer searched a package and found drugs, it was not said to be in violation because a reasonable person would expect illegal narcotics to be kept in a package or container.\n\nThe Special Operations Division of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration advises DEA agents to follow a process of \"parallel construction\" when launching criminal investigations of Americans based on SOD tips that may be based on warrantless surveillance.\n\nThe exclusionary rule as it has developed in the United States has been long criticized. Judge Benjamin Cardozo, Chief Judge of the New York Court of Appeals between 1927 and 1932, stated that under the rule, \"The criminal is to go free because the constable has blundered.\" The judge noted that many states had rejected the rule, but suggested that the adoption by the federal courts would affect the practice in the sovereign states.\n\nIn the 1970s, Dallin H. Oaks, Malcolm Wilkey, and others called for the exclusionary rule to be replaced with a comprehensive judicial remedy against all illegal arrests and searches and seizures (e.g., tort remedy). By the 1980s, the exclusionary rule remained controversial and was strongly opposed by President Ronald Reagan. But, some opponents began seeking to have the rule modified, rather than abolished altogether. The case, \"Illinois v. Gates\", before the Supreme Court brought the exclusionary rule for reconsideration. The Supreme Court also considered allowing exceptions for errors made by police in good faith. The Reagan administration also asked Congress to ease the rule. It has been proposed that the exclusionary rule be replaced with restitution to victims of police misconduct.\n\nA major criticism of the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule is that it allegedly defies the original intent of the Constitution. Yale Law Professor Akhil Amar, for example, has argued that \"nothing in the text, history, or structure of the Fourth Amendment\" supports the rule. Critics like Amar, Oaks and Wilkey point to the fact that the text of the Fourth Amendment does not indicate that illegally seized evidence must be excluded. Some legal historians argue that the Constitution's Framers intended only that victims of unreasonable searches or seizures could file civil lawsuits.\n\nIn 2009, Roger Roots presented evidence that the idea of exclusion can be found in the earliest set of law books published in American history. In 2014, Roots elaborated that certain eighteenth-century British law books and pamphlets which discuss the exclusion of illegally seized evidence circulated widely in the American colonies and were owned by numerous prominent Framing-era lawyers and statesmen. Also in 2014, Professor Richard Re proposed that the Due Process Clause provides an ample basis for the Exclusionary Rule.\n\n\n"}

Gilpin\n\nHenry Dilworth Gilpin (April 14, 1801 – January 29, 1860) was an American lawyer and statesman of Quaker extraction who served as Attorney General of the United States under President Martin Van Buren.\n\nHe was the son of Joshua Gilpin and Mary Dilworth, and was born in Lancaster, England, just before his parents returned to America. His father had been on extended tour of Britain and Europe, lasting from 1795 to 1801, during which he obtained information about the new manufacturing methods used in paper-making for his family paper mills on Brandywine Creek in Delaware. His mother was from the Quaker Dilworths of Lancaster, England.\n\nThe family returned to England for another tour in 1812, and returned to the United States in about 1816, during which time Henry attended school near London. After graduating from the University of Pennsylvania, he studied law with Joseph R. Ingersoll and was admitted to the bar in 1822. He served as U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania from 1831 to 1837, and then as Solicitor of the United States Treasury in 1837. During this time he joined the American Philosophical Society and from 1833 to 1835 he was on the board of the Bank of the United States.\n\nPresident Martin Van Buren named him 14th Attorney General of the United States in 1840. He served until 1841, during which time he presented the U.S. government's side of the \"Amistad\" case to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nFrom 7 June 1852 until 13 June 1859 he was president of the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts and a vice president and trustee of the Philadelphia Historical Society, and from 1856 to 1858 he was also a director of Girard College. He was also a secretary and director of the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal. Gilpin died in Philadelphia in 1860.\n"}

The dictum also appears in \"God Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything\", a book by Hitchens published in 2007.\n\nHitchens's razor is actually an English translation of the Latin proverb \"\" (\"What is freely asserted is freely dismissed\"), which was commonly used in the 19th century. It takes a stronger stance than the Sagan standard (\"Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence\"), instead applying to even non-extraordinary claims.\n\n"}
{"id": "15799006", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15799006", "title": "Human rights in Dubai", "text": "Human rights in Dubai\n\nHuman rights in Dubai are based on the Constitution and enacted law, which supposedly promise equitable treatment of all people, regardless of race, nationality or social status, per Article 25 of the Constitution of the United Arab Emirates. Despite this, Freedom House has stated: \"Extreme forms of self-censorship are widely practiced, particularly regarding issues such as local politics, culture, religion, or any other subject the government deems politically or culturally sensitive. The Dubai Media Free Zone (DMFZ), an area in which foreign media outlets produce print and broadcast material intended for foreign audiences, is the only arena in which the press operates with relative freedom.\"\n\nHuman rights organizations have complained about violations of human rights in Dubai. Most notably, some of the 250,000 foreign laborers in the city have been alleged to live in conditions described by Human Rights Watch as being \"less than humane\". The mistreatment of foreign workers was a subject of the disputed 2009 documentary, \"Slaves of Dubai\".\n\nArticle 25 of the Constitution of the UAE provides for the equitable treatment of persons with regard to race, nationality, religious beliefs or social status. However, in reality there are very few anti-discrimination laws in relation to labour issues, with full UAE locals being given preferential treatment when it comes to employment, even though they generally show minimal interest in working. Foreign laborers in Dubai often live in conditions described by Human Rights Watch as being \"less than humane\", and was the subject of the documentary, \"Slaves of Dubai\". A 2006 NPR report quoted Baya Sayid Mubarak, the Indian consul for labor and welfare in Dubai, as saying \"the city's economic miracle would not be possible without armies of poorly paid construction workers from the Indian sub-continent\". The NPR report stated that foreign construction workers lived \"eight and ten to a room in labor camps\" and that \"many are trapped in a cycle of poverty and debt, which amounts to little more than indentured servitude.\"\n\nLabour injustices in Dubai have attracted the attention of various human rights groups, which have tried to persuade the government to become a signatory to two of the International Labour Organization's eight core conventions, which allows for the formation of labour unions. The Dubai government, however, denied any kind of labour injustices and stated that the watchdog's accusations were misguided. Towards the end of March 2006, the government announced steps to allow construction unions. UAE labour minister Ali al-Kaabi said: \"Labourers will be allowed to form unions\".\n\nThe BBC has reported that \"local newspapers often carry stories of construction workers allegedly not being paid for months on end. They are not allowed to move jobs and if they leave the country to go home they will almost certainly lose the money they say they are owed.\" Additionally, some of the workers have allegedly been forced to give up their passports upon entering Dubai, making it difficult to return home. In September 2005, the Minister of Labour ordered one company to pay unpaid salaries within 24 hours after workers protested, and published the name of the offending company.\n\nIn December 2005, the Indian consulate in Dubai submitted a report to the Government of India detailing labor problems faced by Indian expatriates in the emirate. The report highlighted delayed payment of wages, substitution of employment contracts, premature termination of services and excessive working hours as being some of the challenges faced by Indian workers in the city.\n\nOn 21 March 2006, workers at the construction site of Burj Khalifa, upset over bus timings and working conditions, rioted, damaging cars, offices, computers, and construction tools. The global financial crisis has caused the working class of Dubai to be affected especially badly, with many workers not being paid but also being unable to leave the country.\n\nThe city's discriminatory legal system and unequal treatment of foreigners has been brought to light by its attempts to cover up information on the 2007 rape of Alexandre Robert, a 15-year-old French-Swiss national, by three locals, one of whose HIV-positive status was hidden by the authorities for several months and by the recent mass imprisonment of migrant laborers, most of whom were from Asia, on account of their protests against poor wages and living conditions.\nDespite protests by Human Rights Watch and several governments, companies allegedly continue to take the passports of workers and refuse to pay promised salaries. These practices have been labeled as \"modern slavery\" by some organizations. In 2013, a European national by the name of Marte Dalelv, was arrested and jailed on trumped up charges.\n\nThe labour injustices in Dubai - and wider UAE - have attracted the attention of various foreign governments and Human Rights groups, which have tried to persuade the local government to become a signatory to two of the International Labour Organization's 7 core conventions, which allows for the formation of labour unions. The Dubai government has denied any kind of labour injustices and has stated that the watchdog's (Human Rights Watch) accusations were misguided. Towards the end of March 2006, the government announced steps to allow construction unions. UAE labour minister Ali al-Kaabi said: \"Labourers will be allowed to form unions.\"\n\nPrior to the mid 2000s, camel owners made use of child jockeys, most of whom were kids kidnapped from other parts of the world. After international outcry, the country decided to slowly put an end to this practice. There are still, however, some violations of this ban.\n\nThere are various examples of local folk ill-treating people, just on the basis of nationality or race. In one instance, a local taxi passenger caused a serious injury to a foreign driver. The passenger told the driver that he was an Emirati and did not listen to the drivers instructions. \n\nThe problem of stateless people (known as Bidoon) has been around for so many years. Many have languished without proper care, even though many of them are natives of the land. These people have not been able to complete their education, secure jobs and have found it hard to marry. A small number of them have been able to acquire UAE nationality or that of Comoros Island.\n\nHomosexuality is illegal. The death penalty is one of the punishments for homosexuality although in practice this has never been enforced. Kissing in some public places is illegal and can result in deportation. Expats in Dubai have been deported for kissing in public.\n\nDubai has a modest dress code. The dress code is part of Dubai's criminal law. Sleeveless tops and short dresses are not allowed at Dubai's malls. Clothes must be in appropriate lengths. Expats and tourists are not allowed to consume alcohol outside of licensed venues.\n\nApostasy is a crime punishable by death in the UAE; in practice this has never been applied. UAE incorporates hudud crimes of Sharia law into its Penal Code - apostasy being one of them. Article 1 and Article 66 of UAE's Penal Code requires hudud crimes to be punished with the death penalty, therefore apostasy is punishable by death in the UAE.\n\nNon-Muslim expatriates can be liable to Sharia rulings on marriage, divorce and child custody. Emirati women must receive permission from male guardian to marry and remarry. The requirement is derived from Sharia, and has been federal law since 2005. In all emirates, it is illegal for Muslim women to marry non-Muslims. In the UAE, a marriage union between a Muslim woman and non-Muslim man is punishable by law, since it is considered a form of \"fornication\".\n\nDuring the month of Ramadan, it is illegal to publicly eat, drink, or smoke between sunrise and sunset. Exceptions are made for pregnant women and children. The law applies to both Muslims and non-Muslims, and failure to comply may result in arrest. In 2008 a Russian woman was put on trial for drinking juice in public during the month of Ramadan.\n\nIslam is the official religion in Dubai. A policy of religious toleration allows foreigners to practice their faith in a private residence or official place of worship, or they can petition the government for a land grant and permission to build a religious institution to hold religious services, which may be a slow process.\n\nThirteen Christian Churches exist, along with facilities for Hindus, Sikhs, and Bahá'ís. Non-Muslim groups are generally allowed to meet and advertise their events, but the law prohibits and punishes proselytizing.\n\nHuman rights groups have expressed concerns about freedom of expression in Dubai, which is often limited by enacted laws or Ministerial edicts in the name of protecting traditional Islamic morality or the image and reputation of Dubai and its leaders.\n\nIn 2007, the Dubai government shut down two Pakistani television channels, Geo News and ARY One. Their entertainment, but not news and political programming, were eventually permitted to broadcast in Dubai. The Dubai Ministry of Culture and Media banned the exhibition of a play, \"Kholkhal\", just hours before it was scheduled to be performed at the 8th annual Gulf Theater Festival. While journalists can no longer be jailed for doing their job, other legal actions can be taken against them. Several members of the Dubai press remain on a government list as being banned from being published within the Emirate. There is also reportedly a degree of self-censorship that occurs, for fear of governmental sanctions, of certain topics that are critical of government policy, the royal family, or may offend traditional Islamic morality.\n\nIn July 2013, a video was uploaded onto YouTube, which depicted a local driver hitting an expatriate worker, following a road related incident. Using part of his local head gear, the local driver whips the expatriate and also pushes him around, before other passers-by intervene. A few days later, Dubai Police announced that both the local driver and the person who filmed the video have been arrested. It was also revealed that the local driver was a senior UAE government official. The video once again brings into question the way that lower classes of foreign workers are treated. Police in November 2013 also arrested a US citizen and some UAE citizens, in connection with a YouTube parody video which allegedly portrayed Dubai and its youth in a bad light. The video was shot in areas of Satwa, Dubai and featured gangs learning how to fight each other using simple weapons, including shoes, the aghal, etc. Eventually, the US citizen was released; in a later interview with the BBC, the Sheikh of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammad mentioned that his treatment was unfair.\n\nUAE has escaped the Arab Spring; however, more than 100 Emirati activists were jailed and tortured because they sought reforms. Since 2011, the UAE government has increasingly carried out forced disappearances. Many foreign nationals and Emirati citizens have been arrested and abducted by the state, the UAE government denies these people are being held (to conceal their whereabouts), placing these people outside the protection of the law. According to Human Rights Watch, the reports of forced disappearance and torture in the UAE are of grave concern.\n\nThe Arab Organisation of Human Rights has obtained testimonies from many defendants, for its report on \"Forced Disappearance and Torture in the UAE\", who reported that they had been kidnapped, tortured and abused in detention centres. The report included 16 different methods of torture including severe beatings, threats with electrocution and denying access to medical care.\n\nIn 2013, 94 Emirati activists were held in secret detention centres and put on trial for allegedly attempting to overthrow the government. Human rights organizations have spoken out against the secrecy of the trial. An Emirati, whose father is among the defendants, was arrested for tweeting about the trial. In April 2013, he was sentenced to 10 months in jail.\n\nRepressive measures were also used against people in order to justify the UAE government's claim that there is an \"international plot\" in which UAE citizens and foreigners were working together to destabilize the country. Foreign nationals were also subjected to a campaign of deportations. There are many documented cases of Egyptians and other foreign nationals who had spent years working in the UAE and were then given only a few days to leave the country.\n\nForeign nationals subjected to forced disappearance include two Libyans and two Qataris. Amnesty reported that the Qatari men have been abducted by the UAE government and the UAE government has withheld information about the men's fate from their families. Amongst the foreign nationals detained, imprisoned and expelled is Iyad El-Baghdadi, a popular blogger and Twitter personality. He was arrested by UAE authorities, detained, imprisoned and then expelled from the country. Despite his lifetime residence in the UAE, as a Palestinian citizen, El-Baghdadi had no recourse to contest this order. He could not be deported back to the Palestinian territories, therefore he was deported to Malaysia.\n\nIn 2012, Dubai police subjected three British citizens to beatings and electric shocks after arresting them on drugs charges. The British Prime Minister, David Cameron, expressed \"concern\" over the case and raised it with the UAE President, Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, during his 2013 state visit to the UK. The three men were pardoned and released in July 2013.\n\nIn April 2009, a video tape of torture smuggled out of the UAE showed Sheikh Issa bin Zayed Al Nahyan torturing a man with whips, electric cattle prods, wooden planks with protruding nails and running him over repeatedly with a car. In December 2009 Issa appeared in court and proclaimed his innocence. The trial ended on 10 January 2010, when Issa was cleared of the torture of Mohammed Shah Poor. Human Rights Watch criticised the trial and called on the government to establish an independent body to investigate allegations of abuse by UAE security personnel and other persons of authority. The US State Department has expressed concern over the verdict and said all members of Emirati society \"must stand equal before the law\" and called for a careful review of the decision to ensure that the demands of justice are fully met in this case.\n\nIn 2006, less than 20% of Emirati women were part of the national labor force. UAE has the second lowest percentage of local women working in the GCC. In 2008-2009, only 21% of Emirati women were part of the labor force. UAE has the highest percentage of total female labor participation in the GCC (including expatriate women). However, Kuwait has the highest percentage of local female labor participation in the GCC because more than 45% of Kuwaiti women are part of the national labor force. 80% of women in UAE are classified as household workers (maids).\n\nThe UAE's judicial system is derived from the civil law system and Sharia law. The court system consists of civil courts and Sharia courts. According to Human Rights Watch, UAE's civil and criminal courts apply elements of Sharia law, codified into its criminal code and family law, in a way which discriminates against women.\n\nRape victims are not immune for punishment for other crimes they have committed in Dubai. In a small number of cases, the courts of the UAE have jailed women after they reported being raped and it was proven that the accusations were false. A British woman, after she reported being gang raped by three men, was fined AED 1000 after confessing to consuming alcohol without a license; her attackers are currently serving ten years in prison. Another British woman was charged with public intoxication and extramarital sex (with her fiancé, not the accused) after she reported being raped; in one final case, an 18-year-old Emirati woman withdrew her complaint of gang rape inside a car by 6 men when faced with a long jail term when it was found there was no evidence that rape occurred. The woman served one year in jail for having consensual sex outside marriage with one of the men on a separate occasion.\n\nIn July 2013, a Norwegian woman, Marte Dalelv, reported rape to the police and received a prison sentence for \"illicit sex and alcohol consumption\" after she confessed lying about the rape. She later changed her mind and claimed she lied following advice from her manager, so her case was dismissed and she was pardoned. The Emirates Center for Human Rights expressed concern over Dubai's treatment of rape victims.\n\nIn keeping with traditional Islamic morality, both Federal and Emirate law prohibit homosexuality and cross-dressing with punishment ranging from long prison sentences, deportation for foreigners, and the death penalty. No nightclub exists for LGBT explicitly, but spots exist in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, with the details spreading only by word-of-mouth. No political organization is allowed to advocate for LGBT rights.\n\nProstitution, although illegal, exists in Dubai. Research conducted by the American Center for International Policy Studies (AMCIPS) found that Russian and Ethiopian women are the most common prostitutes, as well as women from other African countries, while Indian prostitutes are part of a well-organised trans-Oceanic prostitution network. A 2007 PBS documentary entitled \"Dubai: Night Secrets\" reported that prostitution in clubs is tolerated by authorities and many foreign women work there by choice.\n\nDrugs found in urine or blood testing count as \"possession\" under UAE law. Raymond Bingham, BBC's DJ Grooverider, was sentenced to four years in prison after a pair of jeans in his luggage was found to contain just over 2 grams of marijuana. The Dubai authorities have been known to stop tourists on layovers at the airport and are now using extremely sensitive electronic detection equipment, including urine and blood screening, to search for traces of illegal substances. Keith Brown, a British national, was arrested on September 17, 2007 after authorities claim to have discovered a speck of cannabis on the bottom of one of his shoes. According to an article in the \"Daily Mail\", the alleged illegal substance was smaller than a grain of sugar - weighing approximately .003 grams. He has also been sentenced to four years in prison. Other tourists and residents have been sentenced to execution for selling cannabis. However, there are no reports of anyone being executed in the UAE for solely drug offences, unlike neighboring Saudi Arabia. Another UK citizen, Tracy Wilkinson, was arrested and accused of being a \"drugs baroness\" in 2005 after authorities found codeine in her blood. Wilkinson has a bad back and received an injection of codeine at a Dubai hospital. She ended up spending two months in a cell where she contracted dysentery, head lice and an infestation of fleas before she was eventually released on bail. German television producer Cat Le-Huy was arrested in January 2008 for possessing a bottle of the over-the-counter hormone sleep aid Melatonin. Authorities claimed that some dirt in Mr. Le-Huy's luggage was hashish. A Vancouver resident named Bert Tatham was arrested at Dubai International Airport returning home from Afghanistan (where he was working with farmers to try to convince them not to grow poppies). The anti-narcotics officer was found to have two dead poppy bulbs and a tiny amount of hashish melted into the seams of one of his trouser pockets. After spending more than 10 months in prison, he was eventually pardoned by U.A.E. President H.H. Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan.\n\nOn 16 November 2007 Tecom stopped broadcast of two major Pakistani satellite news channels, uplinked from Dubai Media City, which was initially marketed by Tecom under the tagline \"Freedom to Create.\" The Dubai government had ordered Tecom to shut down the popular independent Pakistani news channels Geo News and ARY One World on the demand of Pakistan's military regime led by General Pervez Musharraf. This was implemented by du Samacom disabling their SDI & ASI streams. Later, policy makers in Dubai permitted these channels to air their entertainment programs, but news, current affairs and political analysis were forbidden. Although subsequently the conditions were removed, marked differences have since been observed in their coverage. This incident has had a serious impact on all organizations in the media city with Geo TV and ARY OneWorld considering relocation.\n\n\n"}

From 2004 to 2017, he worked as a shared employee for Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives. \n\nIn July 2017, he was arrested on bank fraud charges as part of a federal investigation. After an 18-month investigation into alleged misconduct involving congressional computer equipment, during which Awan was subject to conspiracy theories involving espionage, in July 2018 the investigation cleared him of such accusations. On July 3, 2018, Awan pleaded guilty to making a false representation on a home equity line of credit application. On August 21, 2018, U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan said the government's investigation had found these conspiracies to be baseless, and sentenced Awan to time served and three months of supervision.\n\nAwan was born in Pakistan in 1980. He won a green card for himself and his family in the green card lottery when he was 14. After emigrating to the U.S. in 1997, Awan worked at a fast-food restaurant while attending community college, then transferred to Johns Hopkins University where he earned a degree in information technology. He became a U.S. citizen in 2004 and resided in Lorton, Virginia.\n\nAwan started working on Capitol Hill in January 2004 as an information technology director for Robert Wexler. His wife Hina Alvi, his two brothers, a sister-in-law, and two friends also worked as congressional information technology staffers. Awan worked as a shared employee, providing technical support for 25 other House Democrats.\n\nIn March 2016, House auditors noticed some purchases for computer equipment were broken into multiple parts below $500, and left off the House inventory. Some of this equipment was delivered to the Awan brothers' house.\n\nOn February 2, 2017, the Sergeant-at-Arms briefed top staffers for members of Congress that the U.S. Capitol Police were conducting an active criminal investigation into the actions of five House IT employees — four men and a woman — who were being investigated allegations of procurement scam and violating the House IT network rules. Subsequently, it was also revealed to the general public that there was an ongoing investigation. These five employees were barred from the computer networks at the House of Representatives.\n\nLater Awan, his wife, Hina Alvi, his two brothers and his friend were named as the five IT staffers being investigated. Given the suspected violations, most of the congress members terminated Awan's services; Democratic Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz from Florida, however, continued to employ Awan in an advisory role.\n\nOn March 5, 2017, the FBI and Capitol Police stopped Awan's wife, Hina Alvi, at Washington Dulles International Airport. They allowed her and her three children to get on the flight to Lahore.\n\nA government investigation led by U.S. Attorney Jessie K. Liu included forensic analysis of computer equipment and data, as well as interviews with about 40 witnesses. The investigation addressed various right-wing conspiracy theories about Awan, concluding that it had \"found no evidence that [Awan] illegally removed House data from the House network or from House Members' offices, stole the House Democratic Caucus Server, stole or destroyed House information technology equipment, or improperly accessed or transferred government information, including classified or sensitive information.\" The investigation found no evidence of ties between Awan and a foreign intelligence agency targeting Congress, or between Awan and an alleged criminal ring that stole equipment from Democratic lawmakers. The investigators stated, \"the government has uncovered no evidence that [Imran Awan] violated federal law with respect to the House computer system\".\n\nOn July 24, 2017, the FBI and U.S. Capitol Police arrested Awan at Dulles Airport. He had previously purchased a ticket to Lahore, Pakistan, with a return flight in January 2018. Awan was arraigned the following day and pleaded not guilty to one count of bank fraud. He was ordered to surrender his passports, abide by a curfew, and wear a GPS device. Wasserman Schultz fired Awan on July 25 after learning about his arrest.\n\nOn August 17, 2017, a federal grand jury, convened in U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia, indicted Awan and his wife on four counts, including conspiracy, making false statements, bank fraud, and unlawful monetary transactions. They were charged with conspiring to obtain home equity loans for $165,000 and $120,000 from the Wright Patman Congressional Federal Credit Union in Oakton, Virginia and transferring the money to Pakistan. In January 2017 the couple had wired $283,000 from Alvi's credit union checking account to two individuals in Faisalabad. The indictment made no mention of an investigation related to procurement theft.\n\nOn September 1, 2017, Awan pleaded not guilty to all of these charges. The investigation concluded in early July 2018 with Awan pleading guilty to making a false statement on a bank loan application. Awan had filed a loan application in the name of his wife, Hina Alvi, with a property as equity, but falsely claimed that the property in question was Alvi's primary residence when it was in fact being rented out by Alvi. Awan's attorney said that Awan made the false statement in order to obtain the loan quickly so that he could quickly transfer money to relatives in Pakistan to help his father, who was gravely ill and living in Virginia. On August 21, 2018, the U.S. District Judge Tanya S. Chutkan sentenced Awan to his time served, plus three months of supervision.\n\nThroughout the government investigation, some conservative media outlets, most notably investigative reporter Luke Rosiak of the website \"The Daily Caller\", spread allegations and conspiracy theories about Awan. These outlets alleged that Awan had had unauthorized access to classified government data, and that he had provided to the Pakistani government and/or leaked some of that information. This included, but was not limited to, the hacking of the Democratic National Committee server in 2015 and 2016, which the U.S. intelligence community concluded Russia was responsible for. Rosiak stated in April 2018 that the affair was \"straight out of James Bond.\" The coverage often included reports on Awan's personal finances, his business dealings, and family disputes.\n\nPresident Donald Trump called for Awan to be investigated for espionage in several posts on Twitter, including one in April 2018 when he referred to Awan as the \"Pakistani mystery man\", and another in June 2018 when he wrote, \"Our Justice Department must not let Awan & Debbie Wasserman Schultz off the hook.\" Days after Awan was cleared of espionage accusations, Trump mentioned the conspiracy theory during a press conference with Vladimir Putin at a summit in Helsinki, asking \"what happened to the servers of the Pakistani gentleman that worked on the DNC?\" Trump had been asked if he believed Putin or American intelligence regarding 2016 election interference. The judge who sentenced Awan in the bank fraud case criticized these conspiracy theories, calling them \"an unbelievable onslaught of scurrilous media attacks to which he and his family have been subjected,\" adding there had been \"accusations lobbed at him from the highest branches of the government, all of which have been proved to be without foundation by the FBI and the Department of Justice.\"\n\n"}

In other words, it is impossible for a property to exist which is not had by some object.\n\nConsider a chair. Presumably chairs did not exist 150,000 years ago. Thus, according to the principle of instantiation, the property of being a chair did not exist 150,000 years ago either. Similarly, if all red objects were to suddenly go out of existence, then the property of being red would likewise go out of existence.\n\nTo make the principle more plausible in the light of these examples, the existence of properties or universals is not tied to their actual existence now, but to their existence in space-time considered as a whole. Thus, any property which \"is\", \"has been\", or \"will be\" instantiated exists. The property of being red would exist even if all red things were to be destroyed, because it has been instantiated. This broadens the range of properties which exist if the principle is true. \n\nThose who endorse the principle of instantiation are known as \"in re\" (in thing or in reality) realists or 'immanent realists'.\n\n"}

He was one of a staggering 16 children of James Balfour (1681–1737) and his wife, Louisa Hamilton. His father had acquired the estate of Pilrig from the Gilbert family, who lost a fortune in the Darien Expedition. His father built the current Pilrig House around 1705.\n\nAfter studying Law at Edinburgh University and at the University of Leyden, he was called to the Scottish bar as an advocate.\n\nHe held the offices of treasurer to the faculty of Advocates and sheriff-substitute of the county of Edinburgh. In 1754 he was appointed to the chair of Professor of Moral Philosophy in the University of Edinburgh, and in 1764 transferred to that of Professor of Public Law.\n\nIn 1775 he is still listed as living in Pilrig House, having inherited the property on the death of his father.\n\nHe was Secretary to the Edinburgh Company of Golfers, and belonged to both the Edinburgh and Leith Golf Courses. In this role he would have been involved in the establishment of the original rules of golf in 1777.\n\nHe died on 6 March 1795. He is buried in the graveyard of South Leith Parish Church.\n\nHe was the author of three philosophical books:\n\nJames McCosh, in his work on the \"Scottish Philosophy\", says of him:\n\nHe sets out (in his \"Delineation\") with the principle that private happiness must be the chief end and object of every man's pursuit; shows how the good of others affords the greatest happiness; and then, to sanction natural conscience, he calls in the authority of God, who must approve of what promotes the greatest happiness. This theory does not give morality 'a sufficiently deep foundation in the constitution of man on the character of God, and could not have stood against the assaults of Hume. ... In his \"Philosophical Essays\" he wrote against Hume and Lord Kaimes, and in defence of active power and liberty. Like all active opponents of the new scepticism he felt it necessary to oppose the favourite theory of Locke, that all our ideas are derived from sensation and reflexion.\n\nIn 1737 he married Cecilia Helen Elphinstone (1705–1780), daughter of Sir John Elphinstone. They had three sons, James, John, and Lewis, and one daughter, Mary Cecelia. Mary married William Gibson and was mother to James Gibson-Craig who was created a baronet in 1831.\n\nHis brother Robert Balfour (born 1706) was a local entrepreneur, running a soapworks in Leith and operating a stagecoach from Edinburgh to Leith.\n\nBalfour's mother was a Miss Hamilton, of Airdrie, great-grandaunt of the late Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet, professor of logic and metaphysics in the University of Edinburgh 1836–1856. His eldest sister married Gavin Hamilton, bookseller and publisher in Edinburgh (also, it is believed, a member of the Airdrie family), whose eldest son was Robert Hamilton, professor of mathematics in Marischal College and University, Aberdeen, author of a treatise on the national debt. The brothers George William Balfour and James Balfour were great-grandsons, the former a heart specialist in Scotland, and the latter a marine engineer in New Zealand.\n\nHe was grandfather to Rev Lewis Balfour and the great great grandfather of Robert Louis Stevenson. It is noteworthy that Stevenson's christened name was Robert Lewis Balfour Stevenson, in deference to his ancestral family.\n\nHis grandson Elphinstone Balfour was a bookseller on the Royal Mile.\n\n"}

He subsequently studied at Leipzig University under Wilhelm Wundt; in 1874 he received his doctorate there with a thesis \"On Conditions of Consciousness\".\n\nReturning to Warsaw, in 1874-75 he was editor-in-chief of the popular Polish-language periodical, \"Niwa\" (The Field). From 1881 he was assistant professor (\"docent\") of psychology and natural philosophy at Lwów University.\n\nIn 1882 he was sent to Paris, France, where he spent several years. Later, from 1907, he would be co-director of the Institut General Psychologique.\n\nReturning to Warsaw, from 1900 Ochorowicz was president of Kasa Literacka (the Literary Fund). He published his pedagogical papers in \"Encyklopedia Wychowawcza\" (the Encyclopedia of Education).\n\nOchorowicz was a pioneer of empirical research in psychology and conducted studies into occultism, Spiritualism, hypnosis and telepathy. His most popular works included \"Wstęp i pogląd ogólny na filozofię pozytywną\" (An Introduction to and Overview of Positive Philosophy, 1872) and \"Jak należy badać duszę?\" (How Should One Study the Soul?, 1869).\n\nOchorowicz the poet published in \"Przegląd Tygodniowy\" (the Weekly Review) under the pen-name Julian Mohort. He wrote the poem, \"Naprzód\" (\"Forward,\" 1873), regarded as the Polish Positivists' manifesto.\n\nOchorowicz, a trained philosopher with a doctorate from the University of Leipzig, became the leader of the Positivist movement in Poland. In 1872 he wrote: \"We shall call a Positivist, anyone who bases assertions on verifiable evidence; who does not express himself categorically about doubtful things, and does not speak at all about those that are inaccessible.\"\n\nIn 1877 he elaborated the theory for a monochromatic television, to be constructed as a screen comprising bulbs that would convert transmitted images into groups of light points.\n\nIn 1885, on several occasions, he demonstrated his own improved telephone. In Paris, he connected the building of the Ministry of Posts and Telegraph with the Paris Opera, 4 kilometers away. At the Antwerp World's Fair, he set up a connection with Brussels, 45 km distant. He linked St. Petersburg, Russia, with Bologoye, 320 km away.\n\nHe experimented with microphones and with apparatus for sending sound and light over distances, and so is regarded as a precursor of radio and television.\n\nOchorowicz conducted experiments at a psychological laboratory that he established at Wisła.\n\nJulian Ochorowicz was a former Lublin secondary-school and Warsaw University schoolmate of Bolesław Prus, who portrayed him in his 1889 novel, \"The Doll\", as the scientist \"Julian Ochocki.\" Ochorowicz, after returning to Warsaw from Paris, in 1893 delivered several public lectures on ancient Egyptian knowledge. These evidently helped inspire Prus to write (1894–95) his sole historical novel, \"Pharaoh\". Ochorowicz provided Prus books on Egyptology that he had brought back from Paris.\n\nAlso in 1893, Ochorowicz introduced Prus to the Italian Spiritualist, Eusapia Palladino, whom he had brought to Warsaw from her mediumistic tour in St. Petersburg, Russia. Prus attended a number of séances conducted by Palladino and incorporated several prominent spiritualist-inspired scenes into his 1895 novel \"Pharaoh\".\n\nOchorowicz hosted Palladino in Warsaw from November 1893 to January 1894. Regarding the phenomena demonstrated at Palladino's séances, he concluded against the spirit hypothesis and for a hypothesis that these phenomena were caused by a \"fluidic action\" and were performed at the expense of the medium's own powers and those of the other participants in the séances. Ochorowicz, with Frederic William Henry Myers, Charles Richet and Oliver Lodge, investigated Palladino in the summer of 1894 at Richet's house on the Île du Grand Ribaud in the Mediterranean. Myers and Richet claimed that furniture moved during the séances and that some of the phenomena were the result of a supernatural agency. However, Richard Hodgson claimed there was inadequate control during the séances and that the precautions described did not rule out trickery. Hodgson wrote that all the phenomena \"described could be accounted for on the assumption that Eusapia could get a hand or foot free.\" Lodge, Myers and Richet disagreed, but Hodgson was later proven correct in the Cambridge sittings as Palladino was observed to have used tricks exactly the way he had described them.\n\nAfter Ochorowicz's wife left him, he decided to make some changes in his life: he bought a piece of land at Wisła in Poland's mountains, built himself a villa as well as four additional houses for tourists, and proceeded to live on the rentals.\n\nAbout 20 June 1900, Prus and his household arrived to visit. In July Prus traveled to nearby Kraków, where until the beginning of September he underwent treatments for his multifarious medical complaints by an ophthalmologist, a neurologist, and a physician who treated his thyroid. \n\nIn 1908–9, at Wisła, Ochorowicz studied the mediumship of Stanisława Tomczyk. \n\nIn the latter half of the 19th century, Spiritualism was not an unusual subject of study for noted psychologists. A prominent American psychologist who looked favorably on Spiritualism was William James.\n\n\nTranslations:\n\n\n\n"}

In 1961, he and his new American Zen students founded the San Francisco Zen Center. (The early history of Zen Center and Suzuki's life in the U.S. are well documented in his 1999 biography \"Crooked Cucumber\" by David Chadwick.)\n\nIn November, 1964, a \"sitting group\" was set up in Palo Alto. The first morning zazen and lecture was held at 1005 Bryant Street in Palo Alto. An evening group was later established in Redwood City. In 1965, the morning group moved to Marian Derby's home in Los Altos, joined by the evening group a year later. Meditation was followed by a brief lecture and an informal breakfast, with family-like discussions with Suzuki at the breakfast table. In a tradition that continues at Kannon Do, tea and cookies were served following the weekly lecture.\n\nIn 1965, Derby tape-recorded and transcribed Suzuki's morning lectures. From 1968, Trudy Dixon edited the lectures into a book, \"Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind\", published in 1971.\n\nIn 1966, the garage was converted to a meditation hall in the style of Sōtō Zen temples in Japan, to Suzuki's design. Construction, by Sangha members, began in June, 1966. \"Haiku Zendo\", named for its seventeen cushions that matched the number of syllables in a haiku poem, was officially opened on August 4, 1966.\n\nIn 1970, Kobun Chino-sensei became Haiku Zendo's resident teacher.\n\nIn 1979, the Sangha bought a small former Pentecostal church on College Avenue in Mountain View for $40,000.

{"id": "27325470", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27325470", "title": "Lagerordnung", "text": "Lagerordnung\n\nThe Lagerordnung was the \"Disciplinary and Penal Code\", first written for Dachau concentration camp, which became the uniform code at all SS concentration camps in the Third Reich on January 1, 1934. Also known as the \"Strafkatalog\" (Punishment Catalogue), it detailed the regulations for prisoners. SS guards were instructed to report violations of the code to the commandant's office. The Concentration Camps Inspectorate was responsible for execution of the resulting punishment, which was carried out without verification of the allegations or any possibility of vindication (see \"Procedures for punishing violations\").\n\nThe early, temporary concentration camps, such as Kemna concentration camp, did not have unified, coordinated regulations, but rather drew their \"Lagerordnung\" from regulations then in use at various police departments and prisons run by the justice system. Differences were nonetheless minor. Some banned smoking, others allowed prisoners to receive food parcels or visits from family members. The regulations were still based on existing law and the camps were patterned after ordinary detention centers. The early camps had penalties such as denial of privileges, or for more severe cases, solitary confinement, a hard bed, denial of food or solitary confinement in a darkened cell, but there is no corporal punishment. The early camps were primarily controlled by the SA or the \"Gestapo\".\n\nDachau, in contrast, was under the control of the SS. Sometime in May 1933, SS camp commandant Hilmar Wäckerle wrote the first \"Lagerordnung\" for a concentration camp. It gave full jurisdiction to the office of camp commandant, making him the sole legal authority. To impose capital punishment at Dachau, with the \"Lagerordnung\" it would be sufficient to have a judgment from two SS men — appointed by the commandant. A defense of the accused would no longer be recorded. The executive, judicial and legislative were unified; the separation of powers and system of opposing checks and balances abolished. Through the ever-present threat of the death penalty, Dachau would create a constant state of emergency for the inmate.\n\nIn none of the other, earlier concentration camps were there as many political murders as in Dachau's first few months. The first legalized murders took place at Dachau. The first murders, committed under Wäckerle, led to an investigation when Sophie Handschuh, the mother of one of the dead prisoners, filed a formal complaint to find out what had really happened to her son. The resulting prosecution forced Himmler to replace Wäckerle. In his stead, Himmler installed Theodor Eicke, a fanatical \"SS-Oberführer\" whose extreme violence had, only shortly before, in March 1933, caused him to be committed for evaluation at a psychiatric clinic at the University of Würzburg. Himmler arranged for Eicke to be released, asking his doctor, Werner Heyde to talk to Eicke and get him to promise to control himself.\n\nSix months later, on October 1, 1933, Commandant Eicke wrote a second edition of the \"Lagerordnung\", adding the Postenpflicht and introducing corporal punishment (flogging). The \"Lagerordnung\" established a \"state within a state\". The second edition established an orderly system, whereby \"legally\" arrested political opponents could be subjected to torture and execution by the SS.\n\nIn the early years of the Nazi government, the SS barely had any concentration camps. The first SS camp was Dachau, near Munich, which Adolf Hitler called \"the capital of the [Nazi] movement\". The improvised operations of the earlier, smaller concentration camps were under the control of the SA, Gestapo or state authorities. The SS didn't become a separate organization until after the Röhm Putsch, when the SA was disempowered in summer 1934. Once competition from the SA was removed, the SS, under the direction of \"Reichsführer-SS\" Heinrich Himmler, was able to begin the systematic establishment of newly built, large concentration camps.\n\nAll SS concentration camps were to follow the esteemed Dachau model and become a \"state within a state\", shielded centers of terror with their own laws and judges, without legal defense, and with their own executable violence.\n\nAfter January 1, 1934, all subsequent versions of the \"Lagerordnung\" were effective for all SS-run concentration camps.\n\n[Translator's note: The sometimes odd phrasing, inconsistencies of capitalization, and style itself are from the source, not the translator.]\n\nDachau Concentration Camp<br>\nOffice of the Commandant, October 1, 1933\n\nDisciplinary and Penal Code for the Detention Camp\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe following penalties are issued within the scope of existing camp regulations, to maintain order and discipline on the grounds of Dachau concentration camp, \nThese regulations apply to all prisoners of the DCC from the time of admission on, till the hour of discharge.<br>\nThe consummate authority of punishment is in the hands of the camp commandant, who is personally responsible to the political police commander for the implementation of the rules as issued.<br>\nTolerance means weakness.

{"id": "30046841", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30046841", "title": "Nagging", "text": "Nagging\n\nNagging, in interpersonal communication, is repetitious behaviour in the form of pestering, hectoring, or otherwise continuously urging an individual to complete previously discussed requests or act on advice.\n\nReporter Elizabeth Bernstein defined, in a \"Wall Street Journal\" article, nagging as \"the interaction in which one person repeatedly makes a request, the other person repeatedly ignores it and both become increasingly annoyed\". Thus, nagging is a form of persistent persuasion that is more repetitive than aggressive and it is an interaction to which each party contributes. Nagging is a very common form of persuasion used in all aspects of life including domestic and professional. It is also a common practice in order to avoid more aggressive persuasive moves like threats. The word is derived from the Scandinavian \"nagga\", which means \"to gnaw\".\n\nKari P. Soule describes nagging as an \"interpersonal ritual\" but states that the term \"seldom appears in interpersonal communication or conflict textbooks. It appears that 'nagging' is commonly used in everyday conversation but it rarely makes it to academic print\".\n\nNagging as a form of interpersonal communication is considered to be a repetitious form of persuasion that can be employed as an alternative to resorting to more aggressive tactics in order to gain compliance. Martin Kozloff, Ph.D., Professor of Education at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington, identifies four main steps of nagging :\n\nKozloff argues that this interaction cycle continues until either the one who is being nagged complies to the nagger’s request or the nagger gives up the attempt to persuade. Kozloff identifies other important aspects of nagging; for instance, non-compliance is necessary for the persuader to be persistent. In addition, the persuader will often change the initial requests words and paralinguistic cues as a strategic tactic to entice the target into complying with the request.\n\nRegarding compliance, behavioural noncompliance describes the situation that occurs when the person being nagged remains silent or agrees to complete the request, but later does not follow through. This strategy is employed to end the confrontation or interaction quickly without conflict, which is why it is common among spouses or partners. As the nagging interaction that starts out in a calm and polite manner continues and the persuader becomes more repetitive, the interaction is more likely to become aggressive in nature. Verbal noncompliance, on the other hand, describes the situation that occurs when the target tells the persuader through words that he will not comply, and is a more direct tactic than behavioural noncompliance. An example of verbal noncompliance could be a simple no, or I am too busy right now, or an even more elaborate response. This tactic does end the nagging interaction more rapidly; however, it can cause a more aggressive response from the persuader, who may escalate persistent persuasion into a threat or another aggressive form of persuasion.\n\nPsychotherapists such as Edward S. Dean, M.D. have reported that individuals who nag are often \"weak, insecure, and fearful ... their nagging disguises a basic feeling of weakness and provides an illusion of power and superiority\". Nagging is sometimes used by spouses of alcoholics as one of several \"drinking control efforts\", but it is often unproductive. Psychologically, nagging can act to reinforce behavior. A study by the University of Florida found the main factors that lead a person to nag are differences in \"gender, social distance, and social status and power\".\n\nKari P. Soule found that nagging is viewed to be more of a feminine form of interpersonal communication than masculine. An equal number of men and women nag; however, studies have shown that women are more likely to nag both men and women, while men are more likely to nag only men. Meaning women nag all people, which can be attributed to the reason why women are stereotyped as nagging people all the time.\n\nNagging by spouses is a common marital complaint. Nagging can be found between both male and female spouses. An 1897 article in \"Good Housekeeping\" magazine stated that at that time, topics differed by gender; husbands' nagging usually involved finding \"fault with their dinner, with the household bills [and] with the children\", along with \"carry[ing] home the worries of business.\"\n\nA study done at Washington State University and published in 1959 described parental nagging of children as being a \"symptom of the rejection of the child\" in circumstances when children's requirements regarding \"time and energy\" are perceived to interfere with the mother's \"individual needs and aspirations.\" According to James U. McNeal, there are seven classifications of juvenile nagging, wherein children nag their parents to obtain something they desire.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, a scold's bridle, also called a brank, was an instrument of punishment used primarily on women. The device was an iron muzzle in an iron framework that enclosed the head. A bridle-bit (or curb-plate), about 2 inches long and 1 inch broad, projected into the mouth and pressed down on top of the tongue. The curb-plate was frequently studded with spikes, so that if the offender moved her tongue, it inflicted pain and made speaking impossible. Wives who were seen as witches, shrews and scolds, were forced to wear the branks, locked onto their head.\n\n\n"}

Nontheism has generally been used to describe apathy or silence towards the subject of God and differs from an antithetical, explicit atheism. Nontheism does not necessarily describe atheism or disbelief in God; it has been used as an umbrella term for summarizing various distinct and even mutually exclusive positions, such as agnosticism, ignosticism, ietsism, skepticism, pantheism, atheism, strong or positive atheism, implicit atheism, and apatheism. It is in use in the fields of Christian apologetics and general liberal theology.\n\nWithin the scope of nontheistic agnosticism, Philosopher Anthony Kenny distinguishes between agnostics who find the claim \"God exists\" uncertain and theological noncognitivists who consider all discussion of God to be meaningless. Some agnostics, however, are not nontheists but rather agnostic theists.\n\nOther related philosophical opinions about the existence of deities are ignosticism and skepticism. Because of the various definitions of the term \"God\", a person could be an atheist in terms of certain conceptions of gods, while remaining agnostic in terms of others.\n\nThe \"Oxford English Dictionary\" (2007) does not have an entry for \"nontheism\" or \"non-theism\", but it does have an entry for \"non-theist\", defined as \"A person who is not a theist\", and an entry for the adjectival \"non-theistic\".\n\nAn early usage of the hyphenated \"non-theism\" is by George Holyoake in 1852, who introduces it because:\nThis passage is cited by James Buchanan in his 1857 \"Modern Atheism under its forms of Pantheism, Materialism, Secularism, Development, and Natural Laws\", who however goes on to state:\nSpelling without hyphen sees scattered use in the later 20th century, following Harvey Cox's 1966 \"Secular City\": \"Thus the hidden God or deus absconditus of biblical theology may be mistaken for the no-god-at-all of nontheism.\" Usage increased in the 1990s in contexts where association with the terms \"atheism\" or \"antitheism\" was unwanted. The 1998 \"Baker Encyclopedia of Christian Apologetics\" states, \"In the strict sense, all forms of nontheisms are naturalistic, including atheism, pantheism, deism, and agnosticism.\"\n\nPema Chödrön uses the term in the context of Buddhism:\n\nNontheistic traditions of thought have played roles in Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Jainism, Daoism, Creativity, Dudeism, Raëlism Humanistic Judaism,Satanism, Unitarian Universalism, and Ethical Culture.\n\n"}

In May 2012, the advertising agency behind the campaign, McCann, had invited a number of lexicographers, authors, and poets to coin a neologism to describe the behaviour. The word \"phubbing\" was first described by McCann Group Account Director Adrian Mills, who was working with David Astle. The term has appeared in media around the world and was popularized by the Stop Phubbing campaign created by McCann.\n\nThe Stop Phubbing campaign site, and related Facebook page, was part of an elaborate public relations effort designed to promote the \"Macquarie Dictionary\" of Australia. In the media, the website was originally credited by an Australian college student named Alex Haigh, who had been interning at McCann and was subsequently hired. A film, titled \"A Word is Born\", describes the entire process and serves as an advertisement for the dictionary.\n\nThe campaign was picked up by numerous media outlets, notably those in the United Kingdom, Mexico, and Germany. The press reported on surveys showing statistics of the number of the people \"phubbing\", and published etiquette guides.\n\nIn October 2015, media outlets (such as TODAY and Digital Trends) reported on a study by James A.

{"id": "8978155", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8978155", "title": "Richard Shusterman", "text": "Richard Shusterman\n\nRichard Shusterman is an American pragmatist philosopher. Known for his contributions to philosophical aesthetics and the emerging field of somaesthetics, currently he is the Dorothy F. Schmidt Eminent Scholar in the Humanities and Professor of Philosophy at Florida Atlantic University.\n\nRichard Shusterman was born on December 3, 1949, to a Jewish family living in Philadelphia, USA. At the age 16 he left his home and went to Israel, where he continued his education, studying English and philosophy at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. There he received a B.A. degree in English and Philosophy, and later an M.A. degree in philosophy (both degrees awarded magna cum laude). \nAfter teaching at different Israeli academic institutions, and receiving tenure at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev with an episode as a visiting fellow at St. John's College, Oxford University during academic year 1984/85, Shusterman became an Associate Professor of Philosophy at Temple University, Philadelphia, USA in 1986. He was granted tenure in 1988 and promoted to full professor in 1991. He then served as chair of the philosophy department between the years of 1998–2004.\nIn 2004 Richard Shusterman left Temple University to become the Dorothy F. Schmidt Eminent Scholar in the Humanities at Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton, where he also holds the rank of Professor in the departments of Philosophy and English.\nRichard Shusterman has been married twice. From his first marriage in Israel, he has two sons and a daughter. He has one daughter from his second marriage, which ended in 2013.\n\nDuring his years at the University of Jerusalem, Shusterman focused on analytic philosophy. The interest carried over with his doctoral dissertation at Oxford University; \"The Object of Literary Criticism\" which he wrote at St. John's College under the supervision of J. O. Urmson and defended in 1979. It was published under the original title in 1984.\n1988 saw the publication of Shusterman's second book, T. S. Eliot and the Philosophy of Criticism, and with it came a turn in his philosophical focus as well. Influenced by the work that produced the book and personal experiences, Shusterman's attention moved from analytic philosophy to pragmatism. He also began work to develop his own theory of pragmatist aesthetics; based on John Dewey’s aesthetics but augmented by the argumentative methods and tools of analytic philosophy.\nHis third book published, Pragmatist Aesthetics in 1992, brought a big breakthrough in Shusterman’s academic career. The book’s original approach to the problems of definition of art, organic wholes, interpretation, popular art, and the ethics of taste brought him international fame as the book was translated into 14 languages and several editions were published. Shusterman’s position was further strengthened by three subsequent publications: Practicing Philosophy in 1997, Performing Live in 2000, and Surface and Depth in 2002; in which he continued the pragmatist tradition, raising significant interest, provoking numerous critiques and stimulating debates not only among professional philosophers, but in the areas of literary and cultural studies as well.\nIn Practicing Philosophy, Shusterman introduces his concept of ‘somaesthetics’, which he elaborates in greater detail in Performing Live. Somaesthetics is the focus of Shusterman's two subsequent books, Body Consciousness: A Philosophy of Mindfulness and Somaesthetics (2008) and Thinking through the Body: Essays in Somaesthetics (2012). The first of these books, translated into seven languages, helped establish somaesthetics as an international, interdisciplinary project involving scholars from fields beyond philosophy, while the second book consolidated this movement toward the interdisciplinary approach by applying somaesthetics to various arts, and cultural practices.\n\nIn 2007, as a part of his project of developing somaesthetics, Shusterman established the Center for Body, Mind, and Culture at FAU. He is a member of many editorial boards and has been allocated important grants and fellowships for his research; from the National Endowment of the Humanities, the Fulbright Commission, and the Humboldt Foundation.\n\nOne of the important factors influencing Shusterman's philosophy has been his international career. For instance, his work in France with Pierre Bourdieu, the Sorbonne, and the College International de Philosophie has allowed his pragmatism to engage and deploy the contemporary French philosophical tradition. His Fulbright Professorship in Berlin enabled his pragmatism to intersect more closely with contemporary German philosophy. Similarly, his years as a visiting research professor in Hiroshima, Japan and in Beijing and Shandong in China facilitated his study of Asian philosophy and Zen practice.\n\nShusterman philosophy stretches beyond the confines of professional academic life. In 1995, he was a delegate member of the UNESCO project Philosophy and Democracy in the World, and for several years he directed the UNESCO project MUSIC: Music, Urbanism, Social Integration and Culture. In 2012 he prepared a project commissioned by UNESCO that aims to use the internet to stimulate international youth to immerse in dialogue about peace and violence, through the medium of art. Recalling the classical Greek concept of education, the project is named PAIDEIA, an acronym that stands for Peace through Art and Internet Dialog for Education and Intercultural Association. On a more local level, during the years 1998-2004, he organized and hosted a public discussion forum, titled “Dialogues on the Square”, at Philadelphia's main Barnes & Noble bookstore, at Rittenhouse Square. In 2002, he received his professional certification as a Feldenkrais practitioner, and he has worked since as a somatic educator and therapist.\n\nContemporary pragmatism can be divided into two sub-fields; the neo-classical and the neo-analytical. The latter has been well described by Richard Rorty, as an amalgam of the elements of classical pragmatism and analytic philosophy, which is sometimes supplemented, especially in Rorty's case, by the ideas of continental thinkers like Martin Heidegger. The former, represented, among others, by Susan Haack, is more conservative in its development of the classical tradition and adopts a critical stance toward Rorty's interpretation thereof.\n\nAssuming this description is correct, Shusterman's pragmatism lies somewhere in the middle between the above-mentioned positions. Although his analytic background and acceptance of some of Rorty's ideas (he even subsumes his and Rorty's thought under a common category of “reconstructivist genealogical-poetic pragmatism”) seemingly make him a neo-analytic pragmatist, the stress he puts on the importance of the notion of experience, which Rorty would like to substitute with the notion of language, chimes perfectly with the neo-classical stance.\n\nBesides classical pragmatism and analytic philosophy, Shusterman's interests touch varied traditions and disciplines: continental sociology (Pierre Bourdieu) and philosophy (Michel Foucault, Michel de Montaigne, Friedrich Nietzsche), Western body therapy (Moshe Feldenkrais, F. Matthias Alexander) as well as East-Asian thought (Confucius).\n\nThis diversity of interests and inspirations finds its reflection in the scope of Shusterman's philosophical work which embraces not only aesthetics, but also metaphysics, ethics, philosophy of language, political theory as well as metaphilosophy; in which he advocates the idea of philosophy as the art of living.\n\nExperience serves as a basic category in Shusterman's pragmatism, both in terms of methodology (the pragmatist should always work from experience ) as well as ontology or epistemology (experience “is a transactional nexus of interacting energies connecting the embodied self and its environing world”) but contrary to John Dewey, Shusterman does not engage in constructing a general metaphysical conception. He has, however, made significant comments on Dewey's insights and defends Dewey's idea of immediate, nondiscursive experience against the criticism put forward by Richard Rorty.\n\nWhile Rorty shares Dewey's commitment to debunk epistemological foundationalism, he (Rorty) believes that the notion of language is better suited to achieve this goal, than the notion of immediate, non-discursive experience preferred by Dewey. Rorty further says that Dewey's theory itself collapses into a version of foundationalism, where immediate, non-discursive experience serves as evidence for particular knowledge claims.\n\nTo this, Shusterman replies that:\n(b) Dewey never really intended his theory of experience to be a kind of epistemological foundationalism, but rather wanted to celebrate the richness and value of immediate experience, including “the immediate dimension of somatic experience” and to emphasize the positive role such experience can play in improving the quality of human life. (The inspiration of body theorist-therapist F. M. Alexander is important here). Although he argues that Dewey's theory was ultimately spoiled by a kind of foundationalism (not the one Rorty accuses Dewey of but rather one asserting that the specific quality of immediate experience is the glue that makes coherent thought possible),\nShusterman believes that the philosophical value of experience can and should be reaffirmed in an anti-foundationalist form.\n\nIn Shusterman's and, also, Dewey's opinion, the eastern meditation practices repair perception for understanding our dependence on the society's moral order. Shusterman underlines that even if, as Rorty claims, Wilfrid Sellars’s critique of the myth of the given proves that immediate, non-discursive somatic experience cannot be integrated into epistemology, it does not preclude that this experience may be usefully deployed in philosophy as such, because to think otherwise would be to wrongly conflate all philosophy with one of its sub-disciplines, i.e. theory of cognition. And the fact that we can hardly imagine any form of application of the immediate somatic experience in the realm of philosophy is not a proof that this is impossible, but rather indicates that our conception of philosophy is dominated by an idealistic paradigm, naturally hostile to the body as such. The will to change this situation has been one of the reasons why Shusterman developed a philosophical sub-discipline devoted to the body and its experience: Somaesthetics.\n\nShusterman also addresses the philosophical problems of defining art; by presenting both, meta-theoretical insights as well as definitions of his own.\n\nOn the meta-theoretical level he criticizes essentialist, classificatory definitions of art (preferred by the traditional analytic philosophy), which he calls “wrapper definitions” since they aim “at the perfect coverage” of the logical extension of the notion of art. Shusterman finds these definitions problematic, given art's contested value and nature as well as its unpredictable development in the future. He further argues that there is a goal for art definitions, which is more important than the conceptual coverage that is directional/transformational in “illuminating the special point and value of art or [...] improving art’s appreciation”.\n\nHe says that these ideas may converge, but since they may as well not, it is unacceptable to exclude any definitions only on the basis that they do not satisfy the standards of taxonomical validity, like e.g. evaluative definitions which nevertheless can be useful in their own way. Besides discussing the issue of wrapper definitions in general, Shusterman has also criticized particular definitions of that kind invented by George Dickie and Arthur Danto.\n\nShusterman advocates a definition of art; as experience that is influenced by Dewey's definition with significant changes. While he accepts the majority of the elements central to the Dewey's conception of this experience (e.g., that it cannot be reduced to the private mental world of the subject being rather an interaction between the subject and the object), there are some he finds questionable (e.g. Dewey's insistence on the unity and coherence of aesthetic experience which Shusterman would like to supplement with aesthetics of rupture and fragmentation).\nHe says that Dewey was wrong to treat his definition of art as experience as a traditionalist wrapper definition, thus making it vulnerable to the valid charges, that it is both too narrow and too wide (there are some artworks which do not engender aesthetic experiences and, conversely, in some cases aesthetic experience accompanies phenomena which simply cannot be redefined as art, like natural beauty, e.g.). He further says that what Dewey should have done instead was to assign to it the directional and transformational role mentioned above. Conceived this way, Shusterman argues, the definition of art as experience has an undeniable value because even though it cannot embrace the whole extension of the concept of art it “underlines a crucial background condition, direction, and valued goal of art” (i.e. aesthetic experience) and also helps to widen “the realm of art by challenging the rigid division between art and action that is supported by definitions that define art as mimesis, poiesis, or the narrow practice defined by the institutional art world\".\n\nShusterman also advocates a definition of art as dramatization, which supplements the definition he has inherited from Dewey not only by illuminating art's nature from a slightly different angle, but also by serving a different, yet equally important purpose – the reconciliation of two prominent and, at the same time, conflicted aesthetic accounts of art: historicism and naturalism. Since the notion of dramatization involves, and harmonizes two important moments: of putting something into a formalized frame (e.g. “the frame of a theatrical performance”) and of intense experiential content that is framed, it presents itself as a potential synthesizing formula for historicism and naturalism which, Shusterman argues, can be reduced to emphasizing the formal institutional frame of art (historicism) or experiential intensity that characterizes art as such (naturalism).\n\nBoth of Shusterman's definitions have become the subject of many commentaries and criticisms.\n\nOf the many debates that galvanize contemporary humanities, one of the most important one is devoted to the problem of interpretation. Shusterman has participated in it by co-editing a fundamental anthology “The Interpretive Turn”, as well as making his opinions known.\nShusterman's account of interpretation is constructed in opposition to both analytic aesthetics and deconstruction, which are often said to constitute the two opposite poles of contemporary interpretive theory. As he claims, both of them share “a picture of understanding as the recapturing or reproducing of a particular [...] [“separate and autonomous”] meaning-object”, yet they differ as to whether such act is possible. Deconstructionists, assuming their protean vision of language as “systematic play of differences”, claim it is not, and hence deem every reading a “misreading”, while analytic aestheticians think otherwise, usually construing the objective work-meaning as “metaphysically fixed in the artwork” and identifying it with the intention of the artist or “semantic features of the work itself”.\n\nTo avoid both these extremes Shusterman proposes a conception of textual meaning inspired by Wittgenstein(and his notion of language games) in which meaning is thought of as a correlate of understanding, the latter term being conceived as “an ability to handle or respond to [something] in certain accepted ways” which, although shared and legitimized by the community, can be quite different and constitute many diverse “interpretation games”.\nInterpretation, thus, is not an act (be it successful or inherently condemned to failure) of discovering the meaning of text, but rather of constructing it, or, as Shusterman would like to put it, of “making sense’” of text. One of the corollaries of this account is that correctness of interpretation is always relative to the “rules” (typically implicit) of a given interpretation game. Since there are many different incommensurable games existing at the same time and since some of them have undergone some significant changes over history (and some may even have disappeared from use), we can speak of a plurality of correct interpretations of the same text both in synchronic and diachronic dimensions. Another consequence of this theory is Shusterman's logical pluralism which claims not only that there can be different (even contradictory), yet equally true interpretations (that would be only a cognitive pluralism), but also that there are legitimate forms of approaching texts which do not even aim at interpretational truth or plausibility, but rather aim at other useful goals (e.g., providing pleasure or making an old text more relevant to contemporary readers).\n\nAnother of Shusterman's contributions to the theory of interpretation is his critique of a widely held view he calls ‘hermeneutic universalism’, and attributes to Hans-Georg Gadamer, Alexander Nehamas and Stanley Fish, among others. Agreeing with basic anti-foundationalist thrust of the hermeneutic universalists’ position, Shusterman simultaneously rejects their thesis that “to perceive, read, understand, or behave at all intelligently [...] must always be to interpret” and seeks to refute it with many original arguments. He also insists that the notion of interpretation needs a contrasting category to guarantee its own meaningfulness. If everything is interpretation then the concept loses its point. Shusterman argues that immediate, non-interpretive understanding can serve that role of contrast. Inspired by Wittgenstein and Heidegger's theory of hermeneutic circle, Shusterman proposes:\n\n“the immediacy of uninterrupted understandings of language (as when I immediately understand simple and pertinent utterances of a language I know well) and the mediacy of interpretations (as when I encounter an utterance or text that I do not understand in terms of word-meaning or contextual relevance and then have to figure out what is meant)”.\n\nAmong Shusterman's achievements in the theory of interpretation, there are also the accounts of literary criticism he created in his earlier, analytic period, as well as his pragmatist arguments against interpretational intentionalism and his genealogical critique of deconstructionist (Harold Bloom’s, Jonathan Culler’s), analytic (Joseph Margolis’) and neo-pragmatist (Richard Rorty's, Stanley Fish's, Walter Benn Michaels and Steven Knapp’s) literary theories which, as he claims, are all governed at their core by an ideology of professionalism.\n\nAccording to Shusterman, one of the most pressing sociocultural problems of today is the aesthetic legitimization of popular art. He feels that though popular art may now seem to be socially justified, its artistic value is still questioned which leads to the following problems:\nA sincere advocate of popular aesthetics, Shusterman is careful to distinguish his stance from one-sided apologia and would rather characterize it as ‘melorism’ which “recognizes popular art’s flaws and abuses but also its merits [while also holding] that popular art should be improved because it can and often does achieve real aesthetic merits and serve worthy social ends”.\nPutting his meliorism into practice, Shusterman seeks to win aesthetic legitimation for popular art in two ways:\n\n'Somaesthetics’ is a term coined by Shusterman to denote a new philosophical discipline he has invented as a remedy for the following problems:\n\n\nThe above-mentioned conditions have determined the nature of somaesthetics as a grounded-in-philosophical-aesthetics yet interdisciplinary project of theory and practice which can be defined as:\n\nTo clarify the terminological issues, one needs to mention that Shusterman has intentionally put the term ‘soma’ (instead of the more familiar ‘body’) in the name of his disciplinary proposal to emphasize one important feature of his conception of corporeality. For Shusterman, who is a true disciple of Dewey in this regard, bodily and mental (as well as cultural and biological) dimensions of human beings are essentially inseparable, and to signify this unity (this “sentient perceiving «body-mind»”) he prefers to use the term ‘soma’ which, unlike ‘body’, does not automatically connote passive flesh contrasted to dynamic soul or mind.\n\nAlthough Shusterman's project may at first glance seem utterly innovatory and even iconoclastic, its various elements, as Shusterman himself admits, can be traced to many respected traditions: ancient Greek philosophy and the later Western philosophies (Michel de Montaigne, John Dewey, Michel Foucault), but also East-Asian wisdom such as Confucianism.\nSomaesthetics divides into three fundamental branches:\n\n\nShusterman himself works in all three somaesthetic subdisciplines:\n\n\nWhile undeniably a new phenomenon, somaesthetics, which by now forms the center of Shusterman's philosophical inquiries, has already influenced many scholars working in fields as diverse as philosophy, art education, dance theory, health and fitness studies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1010808", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1010808", "title": "Roger Scruton", "text": "Roger Scruton\n\nSir Roger Vernon Scruton (; born 27 February 1944) is an English philosopher and writer who specialises in aesthetics and political philosophy, particularly in the furtherance of traditionalist conservative views.\n\nEditor from 1982 to 2001 of \"The Salisbury Review\", a conservative political journal, Scruton has written over 50 books on philosophy, art, music, politics, literature, culture, sexuality, and religion; he has also written novels and two operas. His most notable publications include \"The Meaning of Conservatism\" (1980), \"Sexual Desire\" (1986), \"The Aesthetics of Music\" (1997), and \"How to Be a Conservative\" (2014). He has been a regular contributor to the popular media, including \"The Times\", \"The Spectator\", and the \"New Statesman\".\n\nScruton embraced conservatism after witnessing the May 1968 student protests in France. From 1971 to 1992 he was a lecturer and professor of aesthetics at Birkbeck College, London, after which he held several part-time academic positions at the University of Oxford, the University of St Andrews, as well as the position of Senior Fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center in the United States. He became known in the 1980s for helping to establish underground academic networks in Soviet-controlled Eastern Europe, for which he was awarded the Czech Republic's Medal of Merit (First Class) by President Václav Havel in 1998.\n\nScruton was knighted in the 2016 Birthday Honours for \"services to philosophy, teaching and public education\".\n\nScruton was born in Buslingthorpe, Lincolnshire to John \"Jack\" Scruton, a teacher from Manchester, and his wife, Beryl Claris Scruton (née Haynes), and was raised with his two sisters in Marlow and High Wycombe. The Scruton surname had been acquired relatively recently. Jack's father's birth certificate showed him as Matthew Lowe, after Matthew's mother, Margaret Lowe (Scruton's great grandmother); the document made no mention of a father. However, Margaret had decided, for reasons unknown, to raise her son as Matthew Scruton instead. Scruton wondered whether she had been employed at the former Scruton Hall in Scruton, Yorkshire, and whether that was where her child had been conceived.\n\nJack was raised in a back-to-back on Upper Cyrus Street, Ancoats, an inner-city area of Manchester, and won a scholarship to Manchester High School, a grammar school. Scruton told \"The Guardian\" that Jack hated the upper classes and loved the countryside, while Beryl was fond of romantic fiction and entertaining \"blue-rinsed friends\". He described his mother as \"cherishing an ideal of gentlemanly conduct and social distinction that ... [his] father set out with considerable relish to destroy\".\n\nScruton lived with his parents, two sisters, and Sam the dog, in a pebbledashed semi-detached house in Hammersley Lane, High Wycombe. Although his parents had been brought up as Christians, they regarded themselves as humanists, so home was a \"religion-free zone\". Scruton's, indeed the whole family's, relationship with his father was difficult. He wrote in \"Gentle Regrets\": \"Friends come and go, hobbies and holidays dabble the soulscape like fleeting sunlight in a summer wind, and the hunger for affection is cut off at every point by the fear of judgement.\"\n\nAfter passing his 11-plus, he attended the Royal Grammar School High Wycombe from 1954 to 1962. He left school with three A-levels, in pure and applied mathematics, physics and chemistry, which he passed with distinction. The results won him an open scholarship in natural sciences to Jesus College, Cambridge, as well as a state scholarship. Scruton writes that he was expelled from the school shortly afterwards, when the headmaster found the school stage on fire, and a half-naked girl putting out the flames, during one of Scruton's plays. When he told his family he had won a place at Cambridge, his father stopped speaking to him.\n\nHaving intended to study natural sciences at Cambridge—where he felt \"although socially estranged (like virtually every grammar-school boy), spiritually at home\"—Scruton switched on the first day to moral sciences (philosophy). He graduated in 1965, then spent time overseas, some of it teaching at the University of Pau and Pays de l'Adour in Pau, France, where he met his first wife, Danielle Laffitte.\n\nIn 1967 he began studying for his PhD at Jesus, then became a research fellow at Peterhouse, Cambridge (1969–1971), where he lived with Laffitte when she was not in France. It was while visiting her during the May 1968 student protests in France that Scruton first embraced conservatism. He was in the Latin Quarter in Paris, watching students overturn cars, smash windows and tear up cobblestones, and for the first time in his life \"felt a surge of political anger\":\n\nScruton was awarded his PhD in January 1973 for a thesis entitled \"Art and imagination, a study in the philosophy of mind\", supervised by Michael Tanner and Elizabeth Anscombe. The thesis was the basis of his first book, \"Art and Imagination\" (1974), which was followed by \"The Aesthetics of Architecture\" (1979). From 1971 he taught philosophy at Birkbeck College, London, a college that specializes in adult education and holds its classes in the evening. Laffitte taught French at Putney High School, and they lived together in a Harley Street apartment previously occupied by Delia Smith. The couple married in 1972 but divorced in 1979.\n\nWorking at Birkbeck left Scruton's days free, so he used the time to study law at the Inns of Court School of Law (1974–1976) and was called to the Bar in 1978; he never practised because he was unable to take a year off work to complete a pupillage.\n\nBirkbeck was known for its embrace of left-wing politics. Scruton has said he was the only conservative there, except for the woman who served meals in the Senior Common Room. In 1974, along with Hugh Fraser, Jonathan Aitken and John Casey, he became a founding member of the Conservative Philosophy Group dining club, which aimed to develop an intellectual basis for conservatism. The historian Hugh Thomas and the philosopher Anthony Quinton attended meetings, as did Margaret Thatcher before she became prime minister. She reportedly said during one meeting in 1975: \"The other side have got an ideology they can test their policies against. We must have one as well.\"\n\nScruton's academic career at Birkbeck was blighted by his conservatism, particularly by his third book, \"The Meaning of Conservatism\" (1980), and later by his editorship of the conservative \"Salisbury Review\". He told \"The Guardian\" that his colleagues at Birkbeck vilified him over the book. The Marxist philosopher Gerald Cohen of University College London reportedly refused to teach a seminar with Scruton, although they later became friends. He continued teaching at Birkbeck until 1992, first as a lecturer, by 1980 as reader, and then as professor of aesthetics.\n\nIn 1982 Scruton became founding editor of \"The Salisbury Review\", a journal championing traditional conservatism in opposition to Thatcherism, which he edited until 2001. The \"Review\" was set up by a group of Tories known as the Salisbury Group—founded in 1978 by Diana Spearman and Robert Gascoyne-Cecil—with the involvement of the Peterhouse Right. The latter were conservatives associated with the Cambridge college, including Maurice Cowling, David Watkin and the mathematician Adrian Mathias.\n\nScruton wrote that editing \"The Salisbury Review\" effectively ended his academic career in the United Kingdom. The magazine sought to provide an intellectual basis for conservatism, and was highly critical of key issues of the period, including the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, egalitarianism, feminism, foreign aid, multiculturalism and modernism. To begin with, Scruton had to write most of the articles himself, using pseudonyms: \"I had to make it look as though there was something there in order that \"there should be something there!\"\" He believes that the \"Review\" \"helped a new generation of conservative intellectuals to emerge. At last it was possible to be a conservative and also to the \"left\" of something, to say 'Of course, the \"Salisbury Review\" is beyond the pale; but ...'\"\n\nIn 1984 the \"Review\" published a controversial article by Ray Honeyford, a headmaster in Bradford, questioning the benefits of multicultural education. Honeyford was forced to retire because of the article and had to live for a time under police protection. The British Association for the Advancement of Science accused the \"Review\" of scientific racism, and the University of Glasgow philosophy department boycotted a talk Scruton had been invited to deliver to its philosophy society. Scruton believed that the incidents made his position as a university professor untenable, although he also maintained that \"it was worth sacrificing your chances of becoming a fellow of the British Academy, a vice-chancellor or an emeritus professor for the sheer relief of uttering the truth\". (Scruton was in fact elected a fellow of the British Academy in 2008). In 2002 he described the effect of the editorship on his life:\n\nThe 1980s established Scruton as a prolific writer. Thirteen of his non-fiction works appeared between 1980 and 1989, as did first novel, \"Fortnight's Anger\" (1981). The most contentious publication was \"Thinkers of the New Left\" (1985), a collection of his essays from \"The Salisbury Review\", which criticized 14 prominent intellectuals, including E. P. Thompson, Michel Foucault and Jean-Paul Sartre. According to \"The Guardian\", the book was remaindered after being greeted with \"derision and outrage\". Scruton said he became very depressed by the criticism. In 1987 he founded his own publisher, The Claridge Press, which he sold to the Continuum International Publishing Group in 2002.\n\nFrom 1983 to 1986 he wrote a weekly column for \"The Times\". Topics included music, wine and motorbike repair, but others were contentious. The features editor, Peter Stothard, said that no one he had ever commissioned had \"provoked more rage\". Scruton made fun of anti-racism and the peace movement, and his support for Margaret Thatcher while she was prime minister was regarded, he wrote, as an \"act of betrayal for a university teacher\". His first column, \"The Virtue of Irrelevance\", argued that universities were destroying education \"by making it relevant\": \"Replace pure by applied mathematics, logic by computer programming, architecture by engineering, history by sociology: the result will be a new generation of well-informed philistines, whose charmlessness will undo every advantage which their learning might otherwise have conferred.\" Scruton was also one of the rare individuals to call for a resumption of covert CIA funding of intellectual and cultural activities, deploring in 1985 the fact that \"the CIA is now utterly intimidated, refusing to engage even in its most honorable occupation--the support of those publications which tell the truth about the modern world.\"\n\nFrom 1979 to 1989, Scruton was an active supporter of dissidents in Czechoslovakia under Communist Party rule, forging links between the country's dissident academics and their counterparts in Western universities. As part of the Jan Hus Educational Foundation, he and other academics visited Prague and Brno, now in the Czech Republic, in support of an underground education network started by the Czech dissident Julius Tomin, smuggling in books, organizing lectures, and eventually arranging for students to study for a Cambridge external degree in theology (the only faculty that responded to the request for help). There were structured courses, \"samizdat\" translations, books were printed, and people sat exams in a cellar with papers smuggled out through the diplomatic bag.\n\nScruton was detained in 1985 in Brno before being expelled from the country. The Czech dissident watched him walk across the border with Austria: \"There was this broad empty space between the two border posts, absolutely empty, not a single human being in sight except for one soldier, and across that broad empty space trudged an English philosopher, Roger Scruton, with his little bag into Austria.\" On 17 June that year, he was placed on the Index of Undesirable Persons. He writes that he was also followed during visits to Poland and Hungary.\n\nFor his work in supporting dissidents, Scruton was awarded the First of June Prize in 1993 by the Czech city of Plzeň, and in 1998 he was awarded the Czech Republic's Medal of Merit (First Class) by President Václav Havel. Scruton has been strongly critical of figures in the West—in particular Eric Hobsbawm—who \"chose to exonerate\" former communist regimes' crimes and atrocities. His experience of dissident intellectual life in 1980s Communist Prague is recorded in fictional form in his novel \"Notes from Underground\" (2014).\n\nScruton took a year's sabbatical from Birkbeck in 1990 and spent it working in Brno in the Czech Republic. That year he registered Central European Consulting, established to offer business advice in post-communist Central Europe. He had been living in an apartment in Notting Hill Gate, which he sold, and when he returned to England rented a cottage in Stanton Fitzwarren, Swindon, from the Moonies and an apartment in the Albany building on Piccadilly, London, from Alan Clark (it had been Clark's servants' quarters).\n\nFrom 1992 to 1995 he lived in Boston, Massachusetts, teaching an elementary philosophy course and a graduate course on the philosophy of music for one semester a year, as professor of philosophy at Boston University. Two of his books grew out of these courses: \"Modern Philosophy: An Introduction and Survey\" (1994) and \"The Aesthetics of Music\" (1997). In 1993 he bought Sunday Hill Farm in Brinkworth, Wiltshire—35 acres, later increased to 100, and a 250-year-old farmhouse—where he lived after returning from the United States.\n\nWhile in Boston, Scruton had flown back to England every weekend to indulge his passion for fox hunting, and it was during a meet of the Beaufort Hunt that he met Sophie Jeffreys, an architectural historian. They married in 1996 and set up home on Sunday Hill Farm. Their two children were born in 1998 and 2000. Scruton set up Horsells Farm Enterprises Ltd in 1999, a PR firm that included Japan Tobacco International and Somerfield Stores as clients. He and his publisher were successfully sued for libel that year by the Pet Shop Boys for suggesting that their songs were in large part the work of sound engineers; the group settled for undisclosed damages.\n\nScruton was criticized in 2002 for having written articles about smoking without disclosing that he was receiving a regular fee from Japan Tobacco International (JTI) (formerly R. J. Reynolds). In 1999 he and his wife—as part of their consultancy work for Horshells Farm Enterprises—began producing a quarterly briefing paper, \"The Risk of Freedom Briefing\" (1999–2007), about the state's control of risk. Distributed to journalists, the paper included discussions about drugs, alcohol and tobacco, and was sponsored by JTI. Scruton wrote several articles in defence of smoking around this time, including one for \"The Times\", three for \"The Wall Street Journal\", one for \"City Journal\", and a 65-page pamphlet for the Institute of Economic Affairs, \"WHO, What, and Why: Trans-national Government, Legitimacy and the World Health Organisation\" (2000). The latter criticized the World Health Organization's campaign against smoking, arguing that transnational bodies should not seek to influence domestic legislation because they are not answerable to the electorate.\n\n\"The Guardian\" reported in 2002 that Scruton had been writing about these issues while failing to disclose that he was receiving £54,000 a year from JTI. The payments came to light when a September 2001 email from the Scrutons to JTI was leaked to \"The Guardian\". Signed by Scruton's wife, it asked the company to increase their £4,500 monthly fee to £5,500, in exchange for which Scruton would \"aim to place an article every two months\" in \"The Wall Street Journal\", \"Times\", \"Telegraph\", \"Spectator\", \"Financial Times\", \"Economist\", \"Independent\" or \"New Statesman\". Scruton, who said the email had been stolen, replied that he had never concealed his connection with JTI. In response to \"The Guardian\" article, \"The Financial Times\" ended his contract as a columnist, \"The Wall Street Journal\" suspended his contributions, and the Institute for Economic Affairs said it would introduce an author-declaration policy. Chatto & Windus withdrew from negotiations for a book, and Birkbeck removed his visiting-professor privileges.\n\nThe tobacco controversy damaged Scruton's consultancy business in England. In part because of that, and because the Hunting Act 2004 had banned fox hunting in England and Wales, the Scrutons considered moving to the United States permanently, and in 2004 they purchased Montpelier, an 18th-century plantation house near Sperryville, Virginia. Scruton set up a company, Montpelier Strategy LLC, to promote the house as a venue for weddings and similar. The couple lived there while retaining Sunday Hill Farm, but decided in 2009 against a permanent move to the United States and sold the house.\n\nScruton held several part-time academic positions during this period. From 2005 to 2009 he was research professor at the Institute for the Psychological Sciences in Arlington, Virginia, a graduate school of Divine Mercy University, and in 2009 he worked at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, D.C., where he wrote his book \"Green Philosophy\" (2011).\n\nFrom 2001 to 2009 Scruton wrote a wine column for the \"New Statesman\", and made contributions to \"The World of Fine Wine\" and \"Questions of Taste: The Philosophy of Wine\" (2007), with his essay \"The Philosophy of Wine\". His book \"I Drink Therefore I am: A Philosopher's Guide to Wine\" (2009) in part comprises material from his \"New Statesman\" column.\n\nScruton has also written three libretti, two set to music. The first is a one-act chamber, \"The Minister\", and the second a two-act opera, \"Violet\". The latter, based on the life of the British harpsichordist Violet Gordon-Woodhouse, was performed twice at the Guildhall School of Music in London in 2005.\n\nThe Scrutons returned from the United States to make their home again at Sunday Hill Farm in Wiltshire. Scruton took an unpaid research professorship at Buckingham University, and in 2010 was awarded an unpaid visiting professorship at the University of Oxford to teach graduate classes on aesthetics. He is a senior research fellow at Blackfriars Hall, Oxford. In 2010 he delivered the Scottish Gifford Lectures at the University of St Andrews on \"The Face of God\", and the following year he took up a quarter-time professorial fellowship at St Andrews in moral philosophy.\n\nTwo novels appeared during this period: \"Notes from Underground\" (2014) is based on his experiences in Czechoslovakia and \"The Disappeared\" (2015) deals with child trafficking in a Yorkshire town. Scruton was knighted in the 2016 Birthday Honours for \"services to philosophy, teaching and public education\". He sits on the editorial board of the \"British Journal of Aesthetics\", and on the board of visitors of Ralston College, and is as well a senior fellow of the Ethics and Public Policy Center.\n\nIn November 2018, Scruton was appointed to head the British Government's new Building Better, Building Beautiful commission. The commission was established to \"promote better design and style of homes, villages, towns and high streets\". Shortly after being appointed to the role, Scruton faced calls to quit because of a number of controversial comments that he had made in the past.\n\nScruton has specialised in aesthetics throughout his career. From 1971 to 1992 he taught aesthetics at Birkbeck College. His PhD thesis formed the basis of his first book, \"Art and Imagination\" (1974), in which he argued that \"what demarcates aesthetic interest from other sorts is that it involves the appreciation of something for its own sake\".\n\nSince then Scruton has published \"The Aesthetics of Architecture\" (1979), \"The Aesthetic Understanding\" (1983 and 1997), \"The Aesthetics of Music\" (1997), and \"Beauty\" (2010). In 2008 a two-day conference was held at Durham University to assess his impact in the field, and in 2012 a collection of essays, \"Scruton's Aesthetics\", was published by Palgrave Macmillan.\n\nIn an Intelligence Squared debate in March 2009, Scruton (seconding historian David Starkey) proposed the motion: \"Britain has become indifferent to beauty\" by holding an image of Botticelli's \"The Birth of Venus\" next to one of the supermodel Kate Moss. Later that year Scruton wrote and presented a BBC Two documentary, \"Why Beauty Matters\", in which he argued that beauty should be restored to its traditional position in art, architecture and music. He wrote that he had received \"more than 500 e-mails from viewers, all but one saying, 'Thank Heavens someone is saying what needs to be said'\".\n\nScruton has argued that a belief in God makes for more beautiful architecture. He wrote \"Who can doubt, on visiting Venice, that this abundant flower of aesthetic endeavour was rooted in faith and watered by penitential tears? Surely, if we want to build settlements today we should heed the lesson of Venice. We should begin with an act of consecration, since we thereby put down the real roots of a community.\"\n\nScruton is best known for his writing in support of conservatism. His second book, \"The Meaning of Conservatism\" (1980)—which he called \"a somewhat Hegelian defence of Tory values in the face of their betrayal by the free marketeers\"—was responsible, he said, for blighting his academic career.\n\nHe wrote in \"Gentle Regrets\" (2005) that he found several of Edmund Burke's arguments in \"Reflections on the Revolution in France\" (1790) persuasive. Although Burke was writing about revolution, not socialism, Scruton was persuaded that, as he put it, the utopian promises of socialism are accompanied by an abstract vision of the mind that bears little relation to the way most people think. Burke also convinced him that there is no direction to history, no moral or spiritual progress; that people think collectively toward a common goal only during crises such as war, and that trying to organize society this way requires a real or imagined enemy; hence, Scruton wrote, the strident tone of socialist literature.\n\nScruton further argued, following Burke, that society is held together by authority and the rule of law, in the sense of the right to obedience, not by the imagined rights of citizens. Obedience, he wrote, is \"the prime virtue of political beings, the disposition that makes it possible to govern them, and without which societies crumble into 'the dust and powder of individuality'\". Real freedom, Scruton wrote, does not stand in conflict with obedience, but is its other side. He was also persuaded by Burke's arguments about the social contract, including that most parties to the contract are either dead or not yet born. To forget this, he wrote—to throw away customs and institutions—is to \"place the present members of society in a dictatorial dominance over those who went before, and those who came after them\".\n\nScruton argued that beliefs that appear to be examples of prejudice may be useful and important: \"our most necessary beliefs may be both unjustified and unjustifiable, from our own perspective, and the attempt to justify them will merely lead to their loss.\" A prejudice in favour of modesty in women and chivalry in men, for example, may aid the stability of sexual relationships and the raising of children, although these are not offered as reasons in support of the prejudice. It may therefore be easy to show the prejudice as irrational, but there will be a loss nonetheless if it is discarded. Scruton has been critical of the contemporary feminist movement, while reserving praise for suffragists such as Mary Wollstonecraft.\nIn \"Arguments for Conservatism\" (2006), he marked out the areas in which philosophical thinking is required if conservatism is to be intellectually persuasive. He argued that human beings are creatures of limited and local affections. Territorial loyalty is at the root of all forms of government where law and liberty reign supreme; every expansion of jurisdiction beyond the frontiers of the nation state leads to a decline in accountability.\n\nHe opposed elevating the \"nation\" above its people, which would threaten rather than facilitate citizenship and peace. \"Conservatism and conservation\" are two aspects of a single policy, that of husbanding resources, including the social capital embodied in laws, customs and institutions, and the material capital contained in the environment. He argued further that the law should not be used as a weapon to advance special interests. People impatient for reform—for example in the areas of euthanasia or abortion—are reluctant to accept what may be \"glaringly obvious to others—that the law exists precisely to impede their ambitions\".\n\nHe defined post-modernism as the claim that there are no grounds for truth, objectivity, and meaning, and therefore conflicts between views are nothing more than contests of power, and argued that, while the West is required to judge other cultures in their own terms, Western culture is adversely judged as ethnocentric and racist. He wrote: \"The very reasoning which sets out to destroy the ideas of objective truth and absolute value imposes political correctness as absolutely binding, and cultural relativism as objectively true.\"\n\nScruton contends, following Immanuel Kant, that human beings have a transcendental dimension, a sacred core exhibited in their capacity for self-reflection. He argues that we are in an era of secularization without precedent in the history of the world; writers and artists such as Rainer Maria Rilke, T. S. Eliot, Edward Hopper and Arnold Schoenberg \"devoted much energy to recuperating the experience of the sacred—but as a private rather than a public form of consciousness.\" Because these thinkers directed their art at the few, he writes, it has never appealed to the many.\n\nHe defines totalitarianism as the absence of any constraint on central authority, with every aspect of life the concern of government. Advocates of totalitarianism feed on resentment, Scruton argues, and having seized power they proceed to abolish institutions—such as the law, property, and religion—that create authorities. Scruton writes, \"To the resentful it is these institutions that are the cause of inequality, and therefore the cause of their humiliations and failures.\" He argues that revolutions are not conducted from below by the people, but from above, in the name of the people, by an aspiring elite.\n\nScruton suggests that the importance of Newspeak in totalitarian societies is that the power of language to describe reality is replaced by language whose purpose is to avoid encounters with realities. He agrees with Alain Besançon that the totalitarian society envisaged by George Orwell in \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" (1949) can be only understood in theological terms, as a society founded on a transcendental negation. In accordance with T. S. Eliot, Scruton believes that true originality is only possible within a tradition, and that it is precisely in modern conditions—conditions of fragmentation, heresy, and unbelief—that the conservative project acquires its sense.\n\nScruton considers that religion plays a basic function in \"endarkening\" human minds. \"Endarkenment\" is Scruton's way of describing the process of socialization through which certain behaviours and choices are closed off and forbidden to the subject, which he considers necessary to curb socially damaging impulses and behaviour. Scruton himself is an Anglican, who authored \"Our Church: A Personal History of the Church of England\", defending the relevance of the Church of England.\n\nOn the matter of evidence of God's existence, Scruton has said, \"Rational argument can get us just so far...It can help us to understand the real difference between a faith that commands us to forgive our enemies, and one that commands us to slaughter them. But the leap of faith itself — this placing of your life at God's service — is a leap over reason's edge. This does not make it irrational, any more than falling in love is irrational.\" However, despite claiming that belief alone is sufficiently rational, he has advocated a form of the argument from beauty: he has said that when we take the beauty in the natural world around us as a gift, we are able to openly understand God. The beauty speaks to us, he claims, and from it we can understand God's presence around us.\n\nScruton's \"Sexual Desire\" (1986) has been described as \"the most interesting and insightful philosophical account of sexual desire\" produced within analytic philosophy, and a challenge to the conventional boundaries of that discipline. The book has influenced subsequent discussions of sexual ethics. The philosopher Martha Nussbaum credited Scruton with providing \"the most interesting philosophical attempt as yet to work through the moral issues involved in our treatment of persons as sex partners. The social theorist Jonathan Dollimore writes that Scruton bases a conservative sexual ethic on the Hegelian proposition that \"the final end of every rational being is the building of the self\", which involves recognizing the other as an end in itself.\n\nIn the essay, \"Sexual morality and the liberal consensus\" (1989), Scruton argues that homosexuality is a perversion because the body of the homosexual's lover belongs to the same category as his own. Scruton argued further that gays have no children and consequently no interest in creating a socially stable future. He therefore considered it justified to \"instil in our children feelings of revulsion\" towards homosexuality, and in 2007 he challenged the idea that gays should have the right to adopt. Scruton told \"The Guardian\" in 2010 that he would no longer defend the view that revulsion against homosexuality can be justified.\n\nScruton argues that rights imply obligations. Every legal privilege, he writes, imposes a burden on the one who does not possess that privilege: that is, \"your right may be my duty.\" Scruton therefore regards the emergence of the animal rights movement as \"the strangest cultural shift within the liberal worldview\", because the idea of rights and responsibilities is, he argues, distinctive to the human condition, and it makes no sense to spread them beyond our own species.\n\nHe accuses animal rights advocates of \"pre-scientific\" anthropomorphism, attributing traits to animals that are, he says, Beatrix Potter-like, where \"only man is vile.\" It is within this fiction that the appeal of animal rights lies, he argues. The world of animals is non-judgmental, filled with dogs who return our affection almost no matter what we do to them, and cats who pretend to be affectionate when, in fact, they care only about themselves. It is, he argues, a fantasy, a world of escape.\n\nScruton singled out Peter Singer, a prominent Australian philosopher and animal-rights activist, for criticism. He wrote that Singer's works, including \"Animal Liberation\" (1975), \"contain little or no philosophical argument. They derive their radical moral conclusions from a vacuous utilitarianism that counts the pain and pleasure of all living things as equally significant and that ignores just about everything that has been said in our philosophical tradition about the real distinction between persons and animals.\"\n\nScruton supports English independence because he believes that it would uphold friendship between England, Scotland, Wales; Northern Ireland and because the English would have a say in all matters.\n\nNonfiction\n\nFiction\n\nOpera\n\nTelevision\n\n\nArticles, books\n"}

{"id": "35740951", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35740951", "title": "Syntactic bootstrapping", "text": "Syntactic bootstrapping\n\nSyntactic bootstrapping is a theory in developmental psycholinguistics and language acquistion which proposes that children learn word meanings by recognizing syntactic categories (such as nouns, adjectives, etc.) and the structure of their language. It is proposed that children have innate knowledge of the links between syntactic and semantic categories and can use these observations to make inferences about word meaning. Learning words in one's native language can be challenging because the extralinguistic context of use does not give specific enough information about word meanings. Therefore, in addition to extralinguistic cues, conclusions about syntactic categories are made which then lead to inferences about a word's meaning. This theory aims to explain the acquisition of lexical categories such as verbs, nouns, etc. and functional categories such as case markers, determiners, etc.\n\nOne of the earliest demonstrations of the existence of syntactic bootstrapping is an experiment done by Roger Brown at Harvard University in 1957. In his research, Brown demonstrated that preschool-aged children could use their knowledge of different parts of speech to distinguish the meaning of nonsense words in English. The results of Brown’s experiment provided the first evidence showing that children could use syntax to infer meaning for newly encountered words and that they acquired grammar and semantics simultaneously. Brown's experiment was the beginning of the framework needed in order for the theory to thrive.\n\nThis led developmental psycholinguists like Lila Gleitman, who coined the term syntactic bootstrapping in 1990, to argue that syntax was pivotal for language learning, as it also gives a learner clues about semantics. According to Gleitman's hypothesis, verbs are learned with a delay compared to other parts of speech because the linguistic information that supports their acquisition is not available during the early stages of language acquisition. The acquisition of verb meaning in children is pivotal to their language development. Syntactic bootstrapping seeks to explain how children acquire these words.\n\nThe syntactic bootstrapping hypothesis is based on the idea that there are universal/innate links between syntactic categories and semantic categories. Learners can therefore use their observations about the syntactic categories of novel words to make inferences about their meanings. This hypothesis is intended to solve the problem that the extralinguistic context is uninformative by itself to make conclusions about a novel word's meaning.\n\nFor example, a child hears the sentence, “The cat meeped the bird.” If the child is familiar with the way arguments of verbs interact with the verb, he will infer that \"the cat\" is the agent and that \"the bird\" is the patient. Then, he can use these syntactic observations to infer that \"meep\" is a behaviour that the cat is doing to the bird.\n\nChildren's ability to identify syntactic categories may be supported by Prosodic bootstrapping. Prosodic bootstrapping is the hypothesis that children use prosodic cues, such as intonation and stress, to identify word boundaries.\n\nLandau and Gleitman (1985) found when studying the acquisition of the verbs \"look\" and \"see\" by blind children that contextual clues appeared to be insufficient to explain their ability to differentiate these verbs \".\" They considered the possibility that perceptual verbs might be used more by the blind child's mother when talking about nearby objects, since the child had to touch objects to perceive them. An analysis of the mother's utterances however, found this not to be the case.\n\nThe solution investigated by Gleitman et al. was that syntactic categories (referred to as 'Sentence Frames' by Gleitman), narrow down the contexts in which verbs are present, allowing children to learn their specific meanings in isolation. This narrowing provided evidence for their original hypothesis. When utterances that selected for \"perception verbs only\" were analyzed, the mother's use of the verbs \"look\" and \"see\" for nearby objects increased significantly. Gleitman concluded that a narrowing of contexts, \"then\" contextual support were required for the blind children to learn verbs (in which they had no direct experience). By proxy, since there are many verbs that sighted children do not have direct experience with, they must use the same mechanism as well.\n\nWaxman and Booth (2001) found that children who heard nouns focused on the object categories and children who focused on adjectives focused on an object's properties and categories. This shows that children are sensitive to different syntactic categories and can use their observations of syntax to infer word meaning.\n\nIn Roger Brown’s 1957 experiment, children between the ages of three and five were shown various pictures depicting nonsense words that represented either singular nouns, mass nouns, count nouns or verbs. When the novel words were positioned in a question format, the children were able to use the placement of the novel word in the sentence to draw conclusions focus on different aspects of the image shown and adjusted their answer. For example, when Brown wanted the child to identify a mass noun, he would ask the children \"do you see any sib\", and the child would point at the pictured mass noun or noun indicating quantity. \n\nWhen children made guesses, they were correct more than half of the time. This shows that children are sensitive to the syntactic position of words, and can correctly associate a novel word with its syntactic category.\n\nHarrigan, Hacquard, and Lidz (2016) —Found that children's interpretation of a new attitude verb depended on the syntactic frame in which it was introduced. In the experiment, children who heard the word 'hope' presented in the same syntactic frame as 'want' (i.e. followed by an infinitival verb) connected the new verb 'hope' with a meaning of desire. On the other hand, those that heard 'hope' presented in the same frame as 'think' (i.e. followed by a finite verb) made no such association between desire and the new verb, instead of associating the novel verb with belief. This provides evidence that children use syntax to some extent in learning the meaning behind these sorts of abstract verbs.\nPapafragou, Cassidy, Gleitman (2007) —Participants were asked to identify verbs within the context of a video. Papafragou et al. had children watch 12 videotaped stories. 4 stories about the subject's desires and 8 stories that varied in the subject's beliefs and the framing of a novel verb. At the end of the tape, they would hear a sentence describing the scene but the sentence's verb was replaced with a novel word. Children were asked to respond with what they thought the word meant. Their responses were categorized 4 ways: Action, Belief, Desire, and Other. They found that action words were easily interpreted by children. However, false belief scenes with the complementizer phrase caused for children to respond with belief words more often. Results showed that participants in the experiment identified the verb most accurately when they could use both the video and sentence contexts. When it comes to attitude verbs, children are sensitive to the syntactic framing of the verb in question.\nWellwood, Gagliardi, and Lidz (2016) — showed that four-year-olds can understand the difference between a quantitative or qualitative word, based on its syntactic position within a sentence. In “Gleebest of the cows are by the barn,” the novel word “gleebest” is in a determiner position, and is inferred to mean “most” or “many.” In “the gleebest cows are by the barn,” “gleebest” is in an adjective position, and children infer it to mean “spotty” or another quality. These results are significant because they show children using syntax to understand word meanings.\n\nIn the Gillette et al. (1999) study—, the researchers tested adults to see what difficulties they would face when asked to identify a word from a muted, videotaped scene. They found that adults had trouble identifying the word, especially verbs, when they could only refer to the scene. Their performance increased once they were given the syntactic context for the mystery word. These results indicate that word learning is aided by the presence of syntactic context.\n\nGillette et al. (1999) performed experiments which found that participants who were provided both environmental and syntactic contexts were better able to infer what muted word was uttered at a particular point in a video than when only the environmental context was provided. In the experiment, participants were shown muted videos of a mother and infant playing. At a particular point in the video, a beep would sound and participants had to guess what word the beep stood for. It was always a verb or noun. Experimental results showed that participants were correct on identifying nouns more often than verbs. This shows that certain contexts are conducive to learning certain categories of words, like nouns, while the same context is not conducive to learning other categories, like verbs. However, when the scene was paired with a sentence containing all novel words, but the same syntactic structure as the original sentence, adults were better able to guess the verb. This shows that syntactic context is useful in the acquisition of verbs.\n\nAn early demonstration by Naigles (1990) of syntactic bootstrapping involved showing 2-year-olds a video of a duck using its left hand to push a rabbit down into a squatting position while both the animals wave their right arms in circles.\n\nDuring the video, children are presented with one of the following two descriptions:\n\nChildren were then presented two distinct follow-up videos.\n\nWhen instructed to \"find kradding\", children looked to the video that illustrated the utterance they heard during the initial video. Children who heard utterance A interpreted \"kradding\" to mean the act of the duck pushing on the rabbit, while children who heard utterance B assumed \"kradding\" was the action of arm waving. This indicates that children arrive at interpretations of a novel verb based on the utterance context and the syntactic structure in which it was embedded.\n\nIn 1990, Lila Gleitman took this idea further by examining the acquisition of verbs in more detail. In her study, she found that children could differentiate between verbs that take one or more arguments and that this knowledge was used to help them narrow down the potential meanings for the verb in question. This discovery explains how children can learn the meaning of verbs that cannot be observed, like ‘think’.\n\nIn later studies, this was exemplified by Fisher as she proposed that children can use the number of noun phrases in a sentence as evidence about a verb's meaning. She argues that children expect the noun phrases in a sentence to map one-to-one with participant roles in the event described by that sentence. For example, if a toddler hears a sentence that contains two noun phrases, she can infer that that sentence describes an event with two participants. This constrains the meaning that the verb in that sentence can have. Fisher presented 3 and 5 year old children a video in which one participant caused a second participant to move. Children who heard that scene described by a transitive clause containing a novel verb, associated the subject of the verb with the agent. Children who heard the scene described by an intransitive clause associated the subject with either the agent or the patient. This shows that children make different inferences about meaning depending on the transitivity of the sentence.\n\nAcquiring the meaning of attitude verbs, which refer to an individual’s mental state, provides a challenge for word learners since these verbs do not correlate with any physical aspects of the environment. Words such as 'think' and 'want' do not have physically observable qualities. Thus, there must be something deeper going on that enables children to learn these verbs referring to abstract mental concepts, such as syntactic frames as described in a study above by Harrigan, Hacquard, and Lidz. Because children have no initial idea about the meaning or usage of the words, syntactic bootstrapping aids them in figuring out when verbs refer to mental concepts. If a child hears the statement, \"Matt thinks his grandmother is under the covers,\" three- to four-year-old children will understand that the sentence is about Matt's belief. Children will understand from the syntactic frame in which it was uttered that the verb for mental state, \"thinks\", refers to Matt's beliefs and not to his grandmother's. In addition, Gillette et al. (1999) show that mental state verbs cannot easily be identified when only visual context is available and that these verbs showed the greatest improvement when syntactic context was provided.\n\nThe acquisition of nouns is related to the acquisition of the mass/count contrast. In 1969, Willard Van Orman Quine claimed that children cannot learn new nouns unless they have already acquired this semantic distinction. Otherwise, the word “apples” might refer to the individual objects in a pile or the pile itself, and the child would have no way to know without already understanding the difference between a mass and a count noun. Nancy N. Soja argues that Quine is mistaken, and that children can learn new nouns without fully understanding the mass/count distinction. She found in her study that 2-year old children were able to learn new nouns (some mass, some count nouns) from inferring meaning from the syntactic structure of the sentence the words were introduced in.\n\nIn a 2010 study, Syrett and Lidz show that children learn the meaning of novel gradable adjectives on the basis of the adverbs that modify them. Gradable adjectives have a scale associated with them: for example, the adjective “large” places the noun that it modifies on a size scale, while the adjective “expensive” places the noun that is modifiers on a price scale. In addition, gradable adjectives (GA's) subdivide into two classes: relative and maximal GA’s.\n\nRelative GA’s are words like “big” in (5), and require a reference point: a big mouse is not the same size as a big elephant. As shown in (6) and (7), while relative GAs can be modified by the adverb \"very\" they cannot be modified by the adverb \"completely\".\n\nMaximal GA’s are words like, “full” in (8); they operate on a close-ended scale. As shown in (9) and (10), while relative GAs cannot be modified by the adverb \"very\" they can be modified by the adverb \"completely\".\n\nIn the 2010 study, Syrett and Lidz showed children pictures of objects that could be described in terms of both relative and maximal GA’s. For example, a picture of a container that could be described as both \"tall\" (a relative GA) and \"clear\" (a maximal GA).\n\nWhen showing these objects to the children, the novel adjective used to describe them was prefaced with either adverb \"very\" (which usually modifies relative GA’s) or the adverb \"completely\" (which modifies maximal GA’s). As a control, in some contexts, no adverb was present. When the novel adjective was presented with the adverb \"very\", the children assigned a relative GA meaning to it, and when it was presented with adverb \"completely\", a maximal GA. When no adverb was present, the children were unable to assign a meaning to the adjective. This shows that, in order for children to learn the meaning of a new adjective, they depend on grammatical information provide by adverbs about the semantic class of the novel adjective.\n\nAn experiment by Wellwood, Gagliardi, and Lidz (2016) showed that four-year-olds associate unknown words with a quality meaning when they are presented with adjective syntax, and with a quantitative meaning when they are presented with determiner syntax. For example, in \"Gleebest of the cows are by the barn,\" \"gleebest\" would be interpreted as \"many\" or \"four,\" a quantity. Yet children associate the same unknown word with a quality interpretation when the word is presented in an adjective position. In the sentence \"The gleebest cows are by the barn,\" \"gleebest\" would be interpreted as \"striped\" or \"purple,\" a quality. This shows that children use syntax to identify whether a word is an adjective or a determiner, and use that category information to infer aspects of the word's meaning.\n\nThere is a basic contrast between lexical categories (which include open-class items such as verbs, nouns, and adjectives), and functional categories (which include closed-class items such auxiliary verbs, case markers, complementizers, conjunctions and determiners. The acquisition functional categories has been studied significantly less than the lexical class, so much remains unknown. A 1998 study led by Rushen Shi shows that, at a very young age, Mandarin and Turkish learners use phonological, acoustic and distributional cues to distinguish between words that are lexical categories from words that are functional categories. 11 to 20-month old children were observed speaking with their mothers to evaluate whether speech directed at the children contained clues that they could then use to categorize words as \"lexical\" or \"function\". Compared to as lexical category words, functional category words were found to have the following properties:\n\n\nSteven Pinker presents his theory of semantic bootstrapping, which hypothesizes that children use the meaning of words to start to learn the syntax of their language. Gleitman (1990) counters Pinker’s ideas by asserting that context is insufficient to supply word meaning, as a single context can allow for multiple interpretations of an uttered sentence. She explains that simply observing objects and events in the world does not provide sufficient information to infer the meanings of words and sentences. Pinker, however, argues that semantic bootstrapping and syntactic bootstrapping aren't conflicting ideas, and that semantic bootstrapping makes no claims about learning word meanings. He argues that since semantic bootstrapping is a hypothesis about how children acquire syntax, while syntactic bootstrapping is a hypothesis about how children acquire word meanings, the opposition between the two theories does not necessarily exist.\n\nPinker agrees that syntactic categories are in fact used by children to learn semantics and accepts syntactic bootstrapping, but argues that Gleitman applies the hypothesis too broadly, and that is insufficient evidence to account for all of Gleitman's claims. Pinker argues that while children can use syntax to learn certain semantic properties within a single frame, like the number of arguments a verb takes or the types of arguments such as agent and patient, there are serious problems with the argument that children pick up on these semantic properties from the syntax when a verb is found in a wide range of syntactic frames. Pinker uses the verb \"sew\" as an example:\n\nPinker argues that the syntax provides information about possible verb frames, but does not help a learner \"zoom in\" on a verb's meaning after hearing it in multiple frames. According to Pinker, the frames presented above for \"sew\" can do nothing for learners other than clue them into the fact that \"sewing\" is some sort of activity. Furthermore, Pinker disagrees with Gleitman's claim that the ambiguities in the situations where a word is used could only be solved by using information about how the word behaves syntactically.\n\nWith all of the studies above supporting or challenging syntactic bootstrapping, how does the theory hold up cross linguistically?\n\nTwo studies focusing on French and German were determining the use of syntactic contexts to classify novel words as nouns or verbs. The German study found that children between 14 and 16 months could use determiners to classify a novel word as a noun, however, they could not show the same ability mapping pronoun environments to verbs. Overall, this exemplifies their ability to determine the categories of function words and shows a sensitivity to syntactic framing. Following this conclusion, Christophe et al. found that children can use this ability along with Prosodic bootstrapping to infer the syntactic category of the neighboring content words; as at 23 months they can classify novel nouns as well as verbs based on their surrounding syntactic envionrment. These studies follow the Syntactic Bootstrapping model of language acquisition, however, the determiner/noun and pronoun/verb environments are also found in English, som, how well does this theory apply to a Language structurally different from English?\n\nLee and Naigles (2005) looked into how Mandarin children use the transitive versus intransitive environments to infer meaning in a language that allows the noun phrase (subject or object) argument to go unpronounced. Following Fisher’s studies where children use the number of NP’s to make conclusions about the causation in the sentence; 1 NP is an intransitive sentence and involves only the agent while 2 NP’s is a transitive environment and involves an action being taken upon something or someone. \n\nThe environment above was presented in the study and then altered to test the change of interpretation the Mandarin children might have. Due to the pervasive ellipsis in Mandarin, the number of NP’s in a phrase is a weaker clue in mapping causation or non-causation of a verb. Presented with an elided transitive environment \"The dog brings,\" the children determined the sentence to be intransitive, meaning they changed their interpretation of the verb based on the number of noun phrases presented. This was shown as the children used toys to act out the scenario they heard; if their interpretation were to be independent of the number of NP's they would have shown the dog bringing the lion, however, they showed the dog going on its own, showing their interpretation of the verb to be non-causative. This follows the syntactic bootstrapping theory as their mapping of verb meaning relied on the syntactic frame and content in the sentence. However, it poses another question about how Mandarin children can go on to map transitive or intransitive environments properly during their development.\n\nA few studies have begun to look at how children learning languages with different word orders represent syntactic structures which are required for children to map word meanings or categories using syntactic bootstrapping. For example, the research on the acquisition of verbs presents English children as using information about the subject and objects to determine if the verb is causative or non-causative, however, will this ability change in a language which has the object occurring before the verb. One could assume this to be a difficult task if both an English child and child leaning an SOV language have the same mental representation of syntactic structure. To address this, a Gervain, et al., looked at an infant’s mental representation of Japanese, which is a complement – head language with an object-verb (OV) word order, and Italian, which like English, is head-complement and therefore has a verb-object (VO) word order. They found that 8-month-olds have a general knowledge of word order specific to their language preceding their acquisition of lexical items or syntactic categories. Their attuning of structural relations of syntactic categories (verbs, nouns, etc.) within their language allows them to then apply this knowledge later in their development, possibly allowing for language-specific syntactic bootstrapping.\n\n"}

Tajalli is a process by which God reveals Himself in concrete forms.\n\nTajalli literally means \"manifestation, disclosure and appearance\". Mystics use the term to mean \"appearance of truth into human heart and universe.\" The concept is used five times in the Quran, notably in the following verse:\n\nWhen Musa arrived at our appointed time and his Lord spoke to him, he said: \"O Lord, reveal Yourself to me that I may behold You.\" \"You cannot behold Me,\" He said. \"But look at the mountain: If it remains firm in its place you may then behold Me.\" But when his Lord appeared on the mountain, making it crumble to a heap of dust, and Musa fell unconscious. When he recovered, he said: \"All glory to You. I turn to You in repentance, and I am the first to believe.\" (7. Al-Araf: 143)\n\nTheologians interpreting the Quran understand tajalli as appearance. They emphasize the concept of seeing God, or \"Ro'ya\". The traditional Ash'aris use the Quranic concept to argue for the possibility of seeing God. To the contrary, Shias and Muta'zilas interpret this verse to prove the impossibility of seeing God.\n\nDivine self-manifestation has an important role in epistemology and ontology for mystics. Two concepts are important to Tajalli; one is \"shams\", the sun of truth, and the other is the mirror of the heart. According to the symbolical language of mysticism, the sun is a password of Truth and the mirror is the key to the universe and the heart.\n\nAccording to epistemological semantics, truth manifests itself in the heart of the human being on a mystical journey. Consequently, by means of divine manifestation within one's self, the mystic could attain to a realization of the truth to such a degree that those attributes he personally embodies shine forth as reflections of The Divine Attributes within his very being. The spiritual wayfarer discovers this through the ascetic or Sufi conduct during his spiritual journey inward to attain to God Consciousness, which he unleashes within himself into the world as a kind of divine charisma. Some mystics of the Sufi path recognize this charisma as a divine presence and regard it as sufficient reason to conclude that the Divine is manifest in the heart of the charismatic. Alternatively, Tajalli is also use to denote a removal of the conceptual veils which occult the truth of The Divine Manifestation - namely every thing that veils Creation's True End, which is to act as a Revelation of God's Divine Attributes.\n\nMystics have many levels to achieve intuitive knowledge of God:\n\nAccording to ontological sense, the absolute truth manifests itself in the universe like the appearing of the sun of truth in the mirror of universe in the heart of the Mystic. The absolute manifests itself in multitude forms in different beings.\n\n\n"}

A tea room may be a room set aside in a hotel especially for serving afternoon tea, or may be an establishment which only serves cream teas. Although the function of a tearoom may vary according to the circumstance or country, teahouses often serve as centers of social interaction, like coffeehouses.\n\nSome cultures have a variety of distinct tea-centered establishments of different types, depending on the national tea culture. For example, the British or American tearoom serves afternoon tea with a variety of small cakes.\n\nIn China, Japan and Nepal, a teahouse (茶館 \"cháguăn\" or 茶屋 \"cháwū\"; Standard Nepali:\"चिया घर\") is traditionally a place which offers tea to its customers. People gather at teahouses to chat, socialize, and enjoy tea, and young people often meet at teahouses for dates. The Guangdong (Cantonese) style teahouse is particularly famous outside of China especially in Nepal's Himalayas. These teahouses, called \"chálou\" (茶樓) serve dim sum (點心), and these small plates of food are enjoyed alongside tea.\n\nBefore tea was used as a social drink, Buddhist Monks drank tea as an aid to their meditation.\n\nDuring the Chinese adaptation of Buddhism between 200 C.E. and 850 C.E., tea was introduced as a medicinal herb. It was then evolved to assist Buddhist monks in their meditation by providing the energy needed to stay awake (likely via the effects of caffeine as a stimulant on the brain). Soon thereafter, tea popularized as a commonplace beverage (replacing the previously consumed milk- and water-based beverages) as Chinese teahouses provided a new kind of social life for the Chinese during the 8th-9th centuries C.E.\n\nIn Japanese tradition a teahouse ordinarily refers to a private structure designed for holding Japanese tea ceremonies. This structure and specifically the room in it where the tea ceremony takes place is called . The architectural space called \"chashitsu\" was created for aesthetic and intellectual fulfillment.\n\nIn Japan during the Edo period, the term \"teahouse\" could also refer to a place of entertainment with geisha or as a place where couples seeking privacy could go. In this case the establishment was referred to as an , which literally meant \"tea house\". However, these establishments only served tea incidentally, and were instead dedicated to geisha entertainment or to providing discreet rooms for visitors. This usage is now archaic. Contemporary Japanese go to modern tearooms called kissaten on main streets to drink black or green tea as well as coffee.\nIn Myanmar (Burma), teahouses, known as \"laphetyay saing\" () and formerly known as \"kaka saing\" (), are a staple of urban centers throughout the country. These teahouses, which first emerged during the British colonial era, serve milk tea and a variety of delicacies ranging from native dishes like mohinga to Indian fritters (e.g., paratha, poori, etc.) or Chinese pastries (e.g., baozi, youtiao, etc.). Tea shops have traditionally served as venues akin to conversational salons.\n\nIn Central Asia the term teahouse could refer to Shayhana in Kazakh, Chaykhana in Kyrgyz and Choyxona in Uzbek, which literally means a tea room. In Tajikistan, the largest teahouses are the Orient Teahouse, Chinese Teahouse, and Orom Teahouse in the city of Isfara. On the 15th anniversary of the independence of Tajikistan, the people of Isfara presented the Isfara Teahouse to the city of Kulyab for its 2700th anniversary on September 2006. Teahouses are present in other parts of Central Asia, notably in Iran and also Turkey. Such teahouses may be referred to, in Persian, as \"Chay-Khaneh\", or in Turkish, \"çayhane\"—literally, the \"house of tea\". These teahouses usually serve several beverages in addition to tea.\n\nIn Arab countries such as Egypt, establishments that serve tea, coffee and herbal teas like karkade are referred to as \"ahwa\" or \"maqha\" () and are more commonly translated into English as coffeehouse.\n\nIn Pakistan, the proniment Pak Tea House is an intellectual tea–café located in Lahore known as the hub of Progressive Writers' Movement.\n\nTea drinking is a pastime closely associated with the English. A female manager of London's Aerated Bread Company is credited with creating the bakery's first public tearoom, which became a thriving chain. Tea rooms were part of the growing opportunities for women in the Victorian era.\n\nIn the UK today, a tea room is a small room or restaurant where beverages and light meals are served, often having a sedate or subdued atmosphere. The food served can range from a cream tea (also known as Devonshire tea), i.e. a scone with jam and clotted cream; to an elaborate afternoon tea featuring tea sandwiches and small cakes; to a high tea, a savoury meal. In Scotland teas are usually served with a variety of scones, pancakes, crumpets and other cakes. There is a long tradition of tea rooms within London hotels, for example, at Brown's Hotel at 33 Albemarle Street, which has been serving tea in its tea room for over 170 years. Part of the charm of the occasion is an attractive tea set, often decorated china.\n\nIn a related usage, a tea room may be a room set aside in a workplace for relaxation and eating during tea breaks. Traditionally this was served by a tea lady, not to be confused with a dinner lady.\n\nTea rooms are popular in Commonwealth countries, particularly Canada, with its harsh winters, when afternoon tea is popular. The menu will generally have similar foods to in the UK, but with the addition sometimes of butter tarts or other small desserts like nanaimo bars or pets de sœurs. Tea is commonly consumed in other Commonwealth countries alone or in the British fashion.\n\nIn France, a tea room is called , and pastries and cakes are also served. It seems that having a separate teahouse was a tradition in many countries in Europe. In Germany, one \"Teehaus\" was particularly famous during the Third Reich era where the German Dictator Adolf Hitler used to have his daily walk and tea on Mooslahnerkopf hill near his residence Berghof, in the Bavarian Alps. Hitler's teahouse was a cylindrical structure built in the woods.\n\nIn the Czech Republic, the tea room culture has been spreading since the Velvet Revolution 1989 and today, there are nearly 400 tea rooms (čajovny) in the country (more than 50 just in Prague), which is according to some sources the largest concentration of tea rooms per capita in Europe.\n\nIn Eastern Europe, countries like Latvia are located at the crossroads of trade routes between Western and Eastern Europe, and tea came both from the East and West. One example of mixed tea is a new type of tea room—Club tea culture. For example, a tea club Goija.\n\nThe popularity of the tea room rose as an alternative to the pub in the UK and US during the temperance movement in the 1830s. The form developed in the late 19th century, as Catherine Cranston opened the first of what became a chain of \"Miss Cranston's Tea Rooms\" in Glasgow, Scotland, and similar establishments became popular throughout Scotland. In the 1880s, fine hotels in both the United States and England began to offer tea service in tea rooms and tea courts, and by 1910 they had begun to host afternoon tea dances as dance crazes swept both the U.S. and the UK. Tea rooms of all kinds were widespread in Britain by the 1950s, but in the following decades cafés became more fashionable, and tea rooms became less common.\n\nThe term \"tea shop\" may also refer to a retail shop selling dry tea to take home. Dry tea (first, as loose leaves, and then in teabags) used to be sold at grocers' shops, and now mainly at supermarkets. One of the oldest shops that still specialises in selling tea for consumption at home is Twinings, which has been operating from the same premises in central London since it opened in 1706.\n\nIn the workplace, the term \"tea room\" (\"break room\" in North America) is a room set aside for employees to relax; specifically, to take refreshment during work breaks. Traditionally, a staff member serving hot drinks and snacks at a factory or office was called a tea lady, although this position is now almost defunct.\n\nTea is a prominent feature of British culture and society. For centuries, Britain has been one of the world's greatest tea consumers, and now consumes an average \"per capita\" of 1.9 kg (4.18 lbs) per year.\n\n\n\n"}

Such a person is said to be one chosen by God to suffer more than most people during life, and who generously accepts the suffering, based on the example of Christ's own Passion. The Catholic Church does not officially designate anyone as a victim soul.\n\nIn the apostolic letter \"Salvifici Doloris\" (1984), which deals with human suffering and redemption, Pope John Paul II noted that: \"The Redeemer suffered in place of man and for man. Every man has his own share in the Redemption. Each one is also called to share in that suffering through which the Redemption was accomplished. ...\"\n\nAn exposition of the tradition of victim soul appears in the autobiography of saint Thérèse of Lisieux, \"The Story of a Soul\". In her view, the victim soul is a chosen one whose suffering is mysteriously joined with the redemptive suffering of Christ and is used for the redemption of others.\n\nThe Catholic Church does not officially designate anyone as a victim soul. The term comes from the testimony of those who have observed Christians who seem to undergo a kind of redemptive suffering. Victim soul status, even when genuine, is a matter of private revelation; therefore individuals are not bound to accept, as part of the Catholic faith, the legitimacy of any particular person for whom such a claim is made, nor the genuineness of any miraculous claims that have been made in connection with such a person.\n\nExamples of alleged victim souls are:\n\nAlthough the notion of a scapegoat has been present within Judeo-Christian teachings for long, the Catholic concept of a victim soul is distinct and different from it, in that in this case the victim soul willingly offers the suffering to God, unlike the unwitting scapegoat scenario.\n"}

Since a boy he was interested in the history of art; when he was 23 he graduated in Jurisprudence, but as he was fond of philosophy, he soon started the philosophical studies and attended the philosophical library of Palermo, where he met Giovanni Gentile.\n\nIn 1910 Allmayer graduated in philosophy and started his career as teacher: in 1914 he moved to the liceo \"Umberto I\" in Palermo, where he started his rich essaystic production that made him famous in Italy.\n\nHis career continued in Rome; soon after the fall of Fascism, in November 1943, Vito Fazio Allmayer was suspended from teaching and reintegrated after the end of war.\n\nAfter a difficult period of his life, in the 1950s he resumed his multifarious activity of essayst and critic, besides teaching.\n\nIn 1915 he had married Concettina Carta, whom he had three children with. After being widowed in 1953 he remarried Bruna Boldrini, who has been among Fazio's greatest critics and promoted a complete edition of his works (I-XXII, Firenze 1969–1991).\n\nAllmayer, who had had a heart stroke three years before, died in Pisa in 1958.\n\n\nThe end of Positivism, and the friendship with Gentile, took him to an ideological engagement in favour of Actual idealism that seemed it would take a cultural and civil renovation; according to Actual idealism it was the act of thinking as perception, and not creative thought as imagination, which defines reality.\n\nTogether with Giovanni Gentile and Guido De Ruggiero, he was one of the supporters of that Actual idealism which \"had all the romantic seduction and all the optimistic confidence of attracting…the best dissatisfied young people, those not moving towards D'Annunzio or Marinetti\", and in 1914–15 he openly sustained, even with lectures, Italy's intervention in the world war, but he was declared unfit at the military visit.\n\nBruna Boldrini, the philosopher's wife, who tried to outline the substantial autonomy of Fazio from Gentile's metaphysics, affirmed that \"Fazio-Allmayer arrives to justify the historical experience as concrete life, in which the manifold and different forms flow into an intersubjective relationship, ethical-aesthetic synthesis, into the specicifity of each one\" (p. 35).\n\nOn the other hand, since 1922 even Benedetto Croce, in a review of the essay \"Contributo alla teoria della storia dell'arte\" (later in Opere, IV, pp. 103–113), put in doubt that we could still speak of actual idealism in Fazio.\n\nIn the second post-war, in a denigratory moment of idealism, and mostly of Actual idealism, accused of connivance with Fascism, Fazio's position was one of open defence of Actual idealism and a faithful development of his own thought.\n\nTeaching is not dying, but entering a life process preceding us and following us over time: on this certainty of Vito and Bruna Fazio-Allmayer, it is based a pedagogic drive of Socratic kind, therefore the master feels a man among men, being more expert, while they are younger, but tending towards the new.\n\nThe educator, in his becoming a person, turns into the historian of himself, in the relationship with his pupils he must acknowledge them in their individuality, rather than level them off.\nOpening to others is the contribution to living: as this sense of solidarity fails with everything, we will have the bother of anguish inside us.\n\nSo the meaning of life is that of hope and love: the other individuals are not antithetical to their ego, but a necessary development of their ego. Each one of us becomes \"compossible\" with others for what he gives and what he take back from others, so the particular results in the universality and this one in the particular.\n\nOwing to Vito Fazio-Allmayer, hope is in the certainty that future is in the present: therefore old teachers are those that, taken from the past, find contemptible everything is produced in the present, and young people are stupid, and all new thoughts are wrong. Old school cannot see the new world and its renovating; the teacher who withdraws in the memories of past, shows the mortal disease called old age.\n\nThe \"Fondazione Nazionale \"Vito Fazio-Allmayer\" was created in Palermo in 1975, by Fanny Giambalvo and Bruna Fazio-Allmayer, who came to Sicily from Tuscany to teach ethics and history of Pedagogy; this institution was founded to honour his husband's memory and arise interest in philosophy by the new generations.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "31580211", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31580211", "title": "Vladimir Bazarov", "text": "Vladimir Bazarov\n\nVladimir Alexandrovich Bazarov (Russian: Влади́мир Алекса́ндрович База́ров; 1874–1939) was a Russian Marxist revolutionary, journalist, philosopher, and economist, born Vladimir Alexandrovich Rudnev. Bazarov is best remembered as a pioneer in the development of economic planning in the Soviet Union. He was one of the Russian Machists.\n\nVladimir Alexandrovich Rudnev was born August 8, 1874 (N.S.) in Tula, Russian Empire.\n\nThe son of a doctor, A. M. Rudnev, he enrolled in the Tula classical gimnaziia (high school) in 1884, and graduated in the spring of 1892.\n\nIn the autumn of 1892, Rudnev enrolled in the faculty of natural sciences of Moscow University. He became involved in revolutionary politics in 1896, activity which would lead to his expulsion from Moscow the following year. He also adopted the surname \"Bazarov\" as an underground revolutionary pseudonym taking it from the Comtean positivist character in Turgenev's \"Fathers and Sons\". Thereafter, Bazarov returned home to Tula where, together with Alexander Bogdanov and Ivan Skvortsov-Stepanov, Bazarov organized a secret school for Tula workers. Bogdanov resided at the house of Bazarov's father, and met his wife who worked for Alexander Rudenev. A guiding principle of this group was that the workers' movement should be led by workers themselves, assisted by educated members of the radical intelligentsia.\n\nBazarov was expelled from Tula in 1899 and emigrated to Germany, settling in Berlin. In the fall of 1900, Bazarov was instrumental in establishing a political organization called the \"Neutral Group of Social-Democrats in Berlin.\" This organization dedicated itself to helping heal the split between the Union of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad, publishers of \"Rabochee Delo\" (The Workers' Cause), and the Emancipation of Labor Group, publishers of \"Iskra\" (The Spark). According to Bazarov, the Berlin group sent representatives to Geneva in an attempt to broker a reconciliation between these two groups of Marxist revolutionary groups. Bazarov's Berlin group issued three or four political proclamations before disbanding in the summer of 1901.\n\nIn the fall of 1901, Bazarov returned to Russia to serve as a member of the Moscow Social Democratic Committee. He was soon again arrested for his political activity, however, this time to be exiled for three years to Siberia.\nIn 1904, Bazarov joined the Bolshevik faction of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party (RSDLP), an organization headed by V.I. Lenin. Over the next several years, Bazarov wrote extensively for the Bolshevik party press, serving on the editorial board of the grouping's primary newspaper, \"Rabochii put\"' (The Workers' Path), and sitting as a member of the party's underground leadership in the country, the so-called \"Bolshevik Center.\"\n\nAlso in this period Bazarov joined with his old Tula comrades Ivan Skvortsov-Stepanov and Alexander Bogdanov in retranslating and publishing a new Russian-language edition of the three volumes of \"Capital\" by Karl Marx. This edition of the book gained recognition as the basic Russian translation and was reissued for decades in the Soviet Union, although for political reasons any mention of the participation of Bazarov and Bogdanov in the translation was later avoided.\n\nBazarov also became interested in philosophy during the first decade of the 20th Century, coming to reject Marx's formulaic dialectical materialism in favor of the use of the scientific method to observe and theorize about human behavior, as espoused by the Austrian Ernst Mach and the German-Swiss philosopher Richard Avenarius. The Bolshevik supporters of the \"empirical-criticism\" of Mach and Avenarius, including Bazarov, Bogdanov, and Nikolai Valentinov, were soon the target of a bitter polemic by Lenin published in 1909, \"Materialism and Empirio-criticism.\" Bazarov subsequently moved away from membership and participation in the Bolshevik organization, while remaining politically radical.\n\nIn 1911, Bazarov was arrested once again and was deported once more, this time a three-year sentence to Astrakhan. In November 1912, Bazarov joined with Bogdanov, Anatoly Lunacharsky, Maxim Gorky, and Lenin, writing for a new paper in St. Petersburg called \"Pravda.\"\n\nDuring the years of World War I, Bazarov wrote for various radical publications, including Gorky's radical daily, \"Novaia zhizn\"' (New Life).\n\nFollowing the October Revolution of 1917, Bazarov moved to Kharkov in the Ukraine, where he wrote for various Menshevik publications. In 1919 he published \"Na puti k sotsializmu\" (Khar'kov, 1919), for which he was attacked by Bukharin, who viewed him and Bogdanov as being part of a combined opposition espousing a theory of a \"bureaucratic degeneration (the technico-intellectual bureaucracy, the 'organizing' caste)\".\n\nIn 1922, Bazarov joined the staff of the State Planning Commission, where he met Vladimir Groman, with whom he would work intimately for the next half decade. Bazarov and Groman worked together developing the basics of Soviet industrial planning, setting the foundation stones for the next half century of the Soviet economy. On November 21, 1923, Groman presented the Presidium of Gosplan with a paper entitled \"Problems of Planning the National Economy as a Whole,\" in which Bazarov argued that the adoption of the mixed economy of the New Economic Policy actually accentuated rather than lessened the need for central economic planning.\n\nTogether with Groman, Bazarov was influential in developing the idea that a diminishing rate of growth was an earmark of economies such as that of the Soviet Union which were in the process of recovery. Although in retrospect the observation seems obvious, the \"theory of the leveling-off curve\" espoused by Groman and Bazarov postulated that an economy with substantial reserves of idle capacity would initially show an inordinately rapid pace of growth as productive capital returned to use, with this rate tapering off as available plant approached full capacity.\n\nIn 1924 Bazarov published a pamphlet entitled \"Towards a Methodology for Strategic Planning\" in which he further expanded his ideas on the development of central planning procedures as the Soviet economy moved from recovery to expansion. Bazarov remained convinced that central direction of economic investment would provide the impetus for accelerated economic growth, speaking in 1926 of the \"hope to overtake and surpass in our development the advanced countries of the capitalist world.\"\n\nBazarov was a staunch advocate of using material incentives to motivate the peasantry to expand agricultural output, declaring early in 1927 that \"only by amply supplying the village with good industrial products at very low prices can we create a real impulse toward the development of our backward agriculture...\" In the wake of weak agricultural marketing by the peasantry in 1927 and 1928, Soviet political leaders moved another direction, however, returning to the coercive requisitioning methods first used during the earlier period of War Communism before moving to a radical drive for complete collectivization of agriculture at the end of the decade.\n\nBazarov was a voice in the Soviet planning apparatus for a rational rate of growth. In response to a draft Five-Year Plan prepared by the Supreme Council of National Economy (VSNKh) which posited industrial growth of 135% over the five economic years 1927/28 to 1932/33, Bazarov deemed the long-term possibilities \"fascinating\" and \"enchanting.\" Such a pace was soon dismissed as inadequate by those holding more extreme views, however, and Bazarov was sharply criticized for pessimism in underestimating \"the advantages inherent in the Soviet system.\" Ultimately, a growth of 179% over the five-year period was approved by Soviet planning authorities, and Bazarov, Groman, and others holding similar views favoring a less drastic rate of capital accumulation were shunted aside.\n\nBazarov was arrested by the Soviet secret police during the summer of 1930. At his interrogation of August 15, 1930, he signed a deposition acknowledging his participation in a group with other economists who had been arrested and interrogated by the GPU, including his friend and co-worker Groman and former Socialist Revolutionary Party member Nikolai Kondratiev.\n\nIn 1931 the Menshevik Trial was held charging \"Mensheviks\" in the state planning apparatus with the \"wrecking\" of Soviet industry through the setting of artificially low planning targets. Although Bazarov was not in the dock among the public defendants in this 1931 Menshevik Trial, his associate Groman was. Groman gave public testimony that he and Bazarov headed a counterrevolutionary group in Gosplan, purportedly organized in 1923, which attempted at \"influencing the economic policy of the Soviet authorities so as to hold the position of 1923-25.\" Historian Naum Jasny has speculated that Bazarov's failure to appear as a defendant at this major public trial was likely a reflection of the fact that \"the GPU did not succeed in breaking him completely enough to make him a desirable member of the trial.\"\n\nGroman, the star figure among the accused, damned himself and his colleagues with testimony that at Gosplan they had spent their time\n\"Putting into the control figures and into the surveys of current business planning ideas and deliberately distorted appraisals antagonistic to the general Party line (lowering the rates of expansion of socialist construction, distorting the class approach, exaggerating the difficulties), stressing the signs of an impending catastrophe (Groman) or, what is close to this, assigning a negligible chance of success to the Party line directed toward the socialist attack (Bazarov, Gukhman)...\"\n\nAlthough excluded from the public trial which besmirched him, Bazarov was tried in secret and sentenced to a term of prison for his alleged wrecking activities. A December 1931 letter from the USSR published in the Menshevik journal \"Sotsialisticheskii vestnik\" (Socialist Herald) reported that Bazarov was being held at that time in a political \"isolator\" at Yaroslavl.\n\nBazarov died September 16, 1939 in Moscow. He was 65 years old at the time of his death.\n\nIn 1999 a two volume collection of documents relating to the 1931 Menshevik Trial was published in Russia. Included were the text of several handwritten depositions collected from Bazarov during the process of his interrogation during the summer of 1930.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "41681462", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41681462", "title": "Von Neumann–Wigner interpretation", "text": "Von Neumann–Wigner interpretation\n\nThe von Neumann–Wigner interpretation, also described as \"consciousness causes collapse [of the wave function]\", is an interpretation of quantum mechanics in which consciousness is postulated to be necessary for the completion of the process of quantum measurement.\n\nIn the orthodox Copenhagen interpretation, quantum mechanics predicts only the probabilities for different outcomes of pre-specified observations. What constitutes an \"observer\" or an \"observation\" is not directly specified by the theory, and the behavior of a system upon observation is completely different than its usual behavior: the wavefunction that describes a system spreads out into an ever-larger superposition of different possible situations. However, during observation, the wavefunction describing the system collapses to one of several options. If there is no observation, this collapse does not occur, and none of the options ever becomes less likely.\n\nIt can be predicted using quantum mechanics, absent a collapse postulate, that an observer observing a quantum superposition will turn into a superposition of different observers seeing different things. The observer will have a wavefunction which describes all the possible outcomes. Still, in actual experience, an observer never senses a superposition, but always senses that one of the outcomes has occurred with certainty. This apparent conflict between a wavefunction description and classical experience is called the problem of observation (see Measurement problem).\n\nIn his 1932 book \"The Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics\", John von Neumann argued that the mathematics of quantum mechanics allows the collapse of the wave function to be placed at any position in the causal chain from the measurement device to the \"subjective perception\" of the human observer. In 1939, Fritz London and Edmond Bauer argued for the latter boundary (consciousness). In the 1960s, Eugene Wigner reformulated the \"Schrödinger's cat\" thought experiment as \"Wigner's friend\" and proposed that the consciousness of an observer is the demarcation line that precipitates collapse of the wave function, independent of any realist interpretation. See Consciousness and measurement. The non-physical mind is postulated to be the only true measurement apparatus. Rudolf Peierls was also a proponent of this interpretation.\n\nThis interpretation has been summarized thus:\n\nThe rules of quantum mechanics are correct but there is only one system which may be treated with quantum mechanics, namely the entire material world. There exist external observers which cannot be treated within quantum mechanics, namely human (and perhaps animal) \"minds\", which perform measurements on the brain causing wave function collapse.\nHenry Stapp has argued for the concept as follows:\n\nFrom the point of view of the mathematics of quantum theory it makes no sense to treat a measuring device as intrinsically different from the collection of atomic constituents that make it up. A device is just another part of the physical universe... Moreover, the conscious thoughts of a human observer ought to be causally connected \"most directly and immediately\" to what is happening in his brain, not to what is happening out at some measuring device... Our bodies and brains thus become ... parts of the quantum mechanically described physical universe. Treating the entire physical universe in this unified way provides a conceptually simple and logically coherent theoretical foundation...\n\nThere are other possible solutions to the \"Wigner's friend\" thought experiment, which do not require consciousness to be different from other physical processes. Moreover, Wigner actually shifted to those interpretations (and away from \"consciousness causes collapse\") in his later years. This was partly because he was embarrassed that \"consciousness causes collapse\" can lead to a kind of solipsism, but also because he decided that he had been wrong to try to apply quantum physics at the scale of everyday life (specifically, he rejected his initial idea of treating macroscopic objects as isolated systems). See Consciousness and Superposition.\n\nTo many scientists this interpretation fails to compete with other interpretations of quantum mechanics because \"consciousness causes collapse\" relies upon an interactionist form of dualism that is inconsistent with the materialism presupposed by many physicists. The measurement problem notwithstanding, they point to a causal closure of physics, suggesting a problem with how consciousness and matter might interact, reminiscent of objections to Descartes' substance dualism.\n\nThe interpretation has also been criticized for not explaining which things have sufficient consciousness to collapse the wave function. Also, it posits an important role for the conscious mind, and it has been questioned how this could be the case for the earlier universe, before consciousness had evolved or emerged. It has been argued that \"[consciousness causes collapse] does not allow sensible discussion of Big Bang cosmology or biological evolution\". For example, Roger Penrose remarked: \"[T]he evolution of conscious life on this planet is due to appropriate mutations having taken place at various times. These, presumably, are quantum events, so they would exist only in linearly superposed form until they finally led to the evolution of a conscious being—whose very existence depends on all the right mutations having 'actually' taken place!\"\n\nOthers further suppose a universal mind (see also panpsychism and panexperientialism). To most physicists, this merely pushes the problem back, which some see as a fatal unparsimonious move in a competition with other theories.\n\nRecently, it has been argued that the results of delayed-choice quantum eraser experiments preclude this interpretation. However, the experiment has also been used to argue for support of this interpretation. Other researchers have expressed similar objections to the introduction of any subjective element in the collapse of the wavefunction.\n\nA poll was conducted at a quantum mechanics conference in 2011 using 33 participants (including physicists, mathematicians, and philosophers). Researchers found that 6% of participants (2 of the 33) indicated that they believed the observer \"plays a distinguished physical role (e.g., wave-function collapse by consciousness)\". This poll also states that 55% (18 of the 33) indicated that they believed the observer \"plays a fundamental role in the application of the formalism but plays no distinguished physical role\". They also mention that \"Popular accounts have sometimes suggested that the Copenhagen interpretation attributes such a role to consciousness. In our view, this is to misunderstand the Copenhagen interpretation.\"\n\nMany of the originators of quantum mechanical theory held that humans can effectively interrogate nature through interacting with it, and that in this regard quantum mechanics is not different from classical mechanics. In addition, Werner Heisenberg maintained that wave function collapse, \"The discontinuous change in the probability function\", takes place when the result of a measurement is registered in the mind of an observer. However, this is because he understood the probability function as an artifact of human knowledge: he also argued that the reality of the material transition from \"possible\" to \"actual\" was mind-independent. Albert Einstein, who believed in realism, and did not accept the theoretical completeness of quantum mechanics, similarly appealed for the merely epistemic conception of the wave function:\n\n“[I advocate] that one conceives of the psi-function [i.e., wavefunction] only as an incomplete description of a real state of affairs, where the incompleteness of the description is forced by the fact that observation of the state is only able to grasp part of the real factual situation. Then one can at least escape the singular conception that observation (conceived as an act of consciousness) influences the real physical state of things; the change in the psi-function through observation then does not correspond essentially to the change in a real matter of fact but rather to the alteration in \"our knowledge\" of this matter of fact.”\n\nHeisenberg and Bohr described quantum mechanics in logical positivist terms. Bohr also took an active interest in the philosophical implications of quantum theories such as his complementarity, for example. He believed quantum theory offers a complete description of nature, albeit one that is simply ill-suited for everyday experiences - which are better described by classical mechanics and probability. Bohr never specified a demarcation line above which objects cease to be quantum and become classical. He believed that it was not a question of physics, but one of philosophy or convenience.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "32724237", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32724237", "title": "Women in Nazi Germany", "text": "Women in Nazi Germany\n\nWomen in Nazi Germany were subject to doctrines of Nazism by the Nazi Party (NSDAP), promoting exclusion of women from political life of Germany along with its executive body as well as its executive committees. While the Nazi party decreed that \"women could be admitted to neither the Party executive nor to the Administrative Committee\", this did not prevent numerous women from becoming party members. The Nazi doctrine elevated the role of German men, emphasizing their combat skills and the brotherhood among male compatriots.\n\nWomen lived within a regime characterized by a policy of confining them to the roles of mother and spouse and excluding them from all positions of responsibility, notably in the political and academic spheres. The policies of Nazism contrasted starkly with the evolution of emancipation under the Weimar Republic, and is equally distinguishable from the patriarchal and conservative attitude under the German Empire. The regimentation of women at the heart of satellite organizations of the Nazi Party, as the or the , had the ultimate goal of encouraging the cohesion of the \"people's community\" .\n\nFirst and foremost in the implied Nazi doctrine concerning women was the notion of motherhood and procreation for those of child-bearing ages. The Nazi model woman did not have a career, but was responsible for the education of her children and for housekeeping. Women only had a limited right to training revolving around domestic tasks, and were, over time, restricted from teaching in universities, from medical professions and from serving in political positions within the NSDAP. Many restrictions were lifted once wartime necessity dictated changes to policy later in the regime's existence. With the exception of \"Reichsführerin\" Gertrud Scholtz-Klink, no women were allowed to carry out official functions, however some exceptions stood out in the regime, either through their proximity to Adolf Hitler, such as Magda Goebbels, or by excelling in particular fields, such as filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl or aviator Hanna Reitsch.\n\nHenceforth, while many women played an influential role at the heart of the Nazi system or filled official posts at the heart of the Nazi concentration camps, a few were engaged in the German resistance and paid with their lives, such as Libertas Schulze-Boysen or Sophie Scholl.\n\nUnder the Weimar Republic, the status of women was one of the most progressive in Europe. The Weimar Constitution of January 19, 1919 proclaimed their right to vote (articles 17 and 22), equality of the sexes in civic matters (art. 109), non-discrimination against female bureaucrats (art. 128), maternity rights (art. 19) and spousal equality within marriage (art. 119). Clara Zetkin, a prominent leader of the German feminist movement, was a Member of Parliament in the Reichstag from 1920 to 1933 and even presided over the assembly in the role of Dean. But Weimar did not represent a huge leap forward for women's liberation. Women remained under-represented in the parliament; motherhood continued to be promoted as women's most important social function; abortion was still prosecutable (§ 218 of the Criminal Code); and female workers did not achieve substantial economic progress such as equal salaries. With the emergence of consumerism, businesses and government had an increasing need for labour; although work became a route to emancipation for women, they were often restricted to clerical work as secretaries or sales staff, where they were generally paid 10 to 20% less than male employees, under various pretexts, such as the claim that their understanding of domestic tasks freed them from certain household expenses.\nWhile most of the other parties under the Weimar Republic ran female candidates during elections (and some were elected), the Nazi party did not. In 1933, Joseph Goebbels justified this position by explaining that \"it is necessary to leave to men that which belongs to men \". Germany went from having 37 female Members of Parliament out of 577, to none, after the election of November 1933.\n\nAdolf Hitler's attaining power as Chancellor marked the end of numerous women's rights, even though Hitler had succeeded in his social rise in part thanks to the protection of influential women. In terms of voting patterns however, a higher proportion of male voters supported the Nazi party compared to female voters. Hitler's socializing within affluent circles, and with socialites such as Princess Elsa Bruckmann, wife of the editor Hugo Bruckmann, and Helene Bechstein, wife of industrialist , early on brought the Nazi party significant new sources of financing. For example, Gertrud von Seidlitz, a widow of a noble family, donated 30,000 marks to the party in 1923; and Helene Bechstein, who had an estate on the Obersalzberg, facilitated Hitler's acquisition of the property Wachenfeld.\n\nIn 1935, during a speech to the National-Socialist Women's Congress, Hitler declared, with regard to women's rights: The fact that Hitler was unmarried and that he represented a masculine ideal for many Germans led to his erotisation in the public imagination. In April 1923, an article appeared in the Münchener Post stating \"women adore Hitler \"; he was described as adapting his speeches to \"the tastes of women who, since the beginning, count among his most fervent admirers\". Women were also sometimes instrumental in bringing their husbands into the Nazi political fold, thus contributing to the recruitment of new NSDAP members.\n\nIn a society that was beginning to consider women as men's equals, Nazi policies constituted a setback, forcing women from political life. The Nazis' policies pertaining to women were one aspect of their efforts to stem what they viewed as the decadence of the Weimar Republic. In their eyes, the Weimar regime, which they perceived as having a Jewish character, in effect appeared as feminized, as well as tolerant of homosexuality – the veritable antithesis of German virility.\n\nHeinrich Himmler declared as much to the SS-Gruppenführer, on February 18, 1937: \n\nOfficially, the status of women changed from \"equal rights\" () to an \"equivalence\" between men and women (). Historian points out that \"this offensive offered the double advantage of pleasing their male colleagues worried by this competition, and returned to private life more than 100,000 people proud of their success, the majority of whom were voters who supported the political left\". This policy created worry among the militants in the NSDAP, who were concerned that it would harm the number of female graduates, a reservoir needed for future party ranks.\n\nIn 1933, school programmes for girls were changed, notably with the goal of discouraging them from pursuing university studies. The five years of Latin classes and three years of science were replaced by courses in German language and domestic skills training. This did not bear productive results; on the one hand, a significant number of girls enrolled in boys' schools, while on the other hand, the \" enrollment restrictions \" of 10% at the university level were generally ignored. Thus, the measures only decreased the enrollment in medical schools from 20% to 17%.\n\nSome women's associations, notably communist and socialist groups were banned, and in some rare cases members were arrested or assassinated. All associations were requested to turn in Jewish members, such as the Union of Protestant Women, the Association of Household and Countryside, the Women's German Colonial Society Union and the Union of Queen Louise. But rapidly, the majority of the associations disbanded or chose among themselves to disappear, such as the BDF (Bund Deutscher Frauenverein), established in 1894 and which disbanded in 1933 to avoid being controlled. Only one women's association persisted under the regime (the association of Gertrud Bäumer, Die Frau, or Woman), until 1944, but placed under the guardianship of the Reich Minister of People's Education and of Propaganda, Joseph Goebbels. Rudolf Hess established the Deutsches Frauenwerk which, with the women's branch of the Nazi party, the NS-Frauenschaft, had the purpose of becoming a mass organization for the regime.\n\nIn 1936, a law was passed banning certain high-level positions in the judicial system to women (notably judge and prosecutor, through Hitler's personal intervention) and the medical field. Female doctors were no longer allowed to practice, until their loss had a harmful effect on health needs and some were recalled to work; also dissolved was the Association of Medical Women, which was absorbed into its male counterpart. Under the Weimar Republic, only 1% of university posts were filled by women. On June 8, 1937, a decree stipulated that only men could be named to these posts, if it was not in a social field. Nonetheless, on February 21, 1938 \" in an individual and exceptional capacity \" following lobbying by Gertrud Scholtz-Klink, one female scientist Margarete Gussow obtained a post in astronomy. Mathematician Ruth Moufang was able to receive her doctorate, but could not obtain the right to teach and was forced to work for national industry. Emmy Noether, another mathematician, was terminated from her post by virtue of the \"German law for the Restoration of the Public Service\" of April 7, 1933, for having been active in the 1920s in the USPD and the SPD. Physics researcher Lise Meitner, who directed the Department of Physics at the Kaiser Wilhelm Society, was able to remain in her post until 1938, but this was only due to her Austrian nationality, which ended with the Anschluss); she then left for the Netherlands, and then Sweden. In the scientific field, there were almost no nominations of women; in 1942, a woman was not permitted to direct a scientific institute, despite the fact that no male candidate had applied. The exile of women from political life was total: they could not sit in either the Reichstag, the regional parliaments or municipal councils.\n\nThere was no substantial resistance to this control. The bourgeois women's associations reasoned, as did many others, that the Nazi government was a vulgar phenomenon that would soon fade, and that through their participation they could still exert some influence. They thus deluded themselves into believing that they were obtaining an \"acceptable arrangement\", as they were accustomed to do under a patriarchal system. With respect to the widespread tendency to underestimate the threat that the regime presented, the historian Claudia Koonz highlights the popular proverb of the era: \"The soup is never eaten as hot as it is cooked\". Women who were the most resolute in their opposition either set their sights on emigration, or, if they took an active stance, risked being arrested and interned, and possibly executed, the same as male opponents of the regime.\n\nNoticing the need for women in certain professions and their usefulness in the country's economy, the anti-emancipation policy in terms of the workforce was rapidly blunted. Women were otherwise invited to adhere to Nazism and reassured with the idea that they could be a mother and be employed, Joseph Goebbels even attacking anti-lipstick propaganda campaigns in Völkischer Beobachter and attacking the most zealous ideologues.\n\nThe Nazi woman had to conform to the German society desired by Adolf Hitler (Volksgemeinschaft), racially pure and physically robust. She did not work, living in the naturalization of motherhood and following the slogan of the former emperor William II of Germany: Kinder, Küche, Kirche, meaning \"Children, kitchen, church\". In a document published in 1934, \"The Nine Commandments of the Workers' Struggle\", Hermann Goering bluntly summarizes the future role of German women: \"Take a pot, a dustpan and a broom and marry a man\". This was anti-feminism in the sense that the Nazis considered political rights granted to women (access to high-level positions for example) as incompatible with the nature of reproduction, the only role within which they could blossom and best serve the interests of the nation. Thus, Magda Goebbels declared in 1933: \"German women were excluded from three professions: the army, as elsewhere in the world; the government; and the judiciary. If a German girl must choose between marriage or a career, she will always be encouraged to marry, because that is what is best for a woman\". It is not possible to make a mental leap to the conservative and patriarchal societies that prevailed for example during the Second Empire; in effect, the totalitarian character of the regime moved away from the concept that had been made of women being put on a shelf by society. On the contrary, they were expected to participate at the ground level in the roles of mother and spouse. The fact that the regimentation of women (Bund Deutscher Mädel then Frauenschaft) being so organized, did not permit relegating women to what they could do in the 19th century. Without a doubt, a conservative electorate and a fringe part of the population very critical of the image of the emancipated woman from the 1920s found a certain satisfaction in the new regime. But the goals were different, asking each woman to take part in the building of the \"Reich of 1000 years\". Female liberation found itself therefore necessarily limited, and Heide Schlüpmann stated conclusively in \"Frauen und Film\", that the films of Leni Riefenstahl (the official film director of the regime) \"value quite a negation of female sexuality and only offer women a deceptive autonomy\".\n\nThe wearing of makeup was generally prohibited, and a certain modesty was demanded of women, contrasting with the Weimar Republic period, which experienced more freedom on a moral level. In 1933, meetings of the NSBO (National Sozialistischer Betriebs Obman, the women's section of the German Workers' Front) proclaimed that women \"painted and powdered were forbidden at all meetings of the NSBO. Women who smoked in public – in hotels, cafés, in the street and so on – will be excluded from NSBO\". Activities considered more or less traditional were limited to recommended places: music, manual labour, gymnastics. Sexuality was banned, unless for a reproductive goal; liberated young women were considered \"depraved\" and \"antisocial\". Mothers were encouraged to have children: thus was created the \"Ehrenkreuz der Deutschen Mutter\" (in English: Cross of Honour of the German Mother) for mothers having brought into the world more than four children. A \"German Mothers' Day\" was also created; during that of 1939, three million mothers were decorated. Concerning abortion, access to services was quickly prohibited, until in 1935, the medical profession became obliged to report stillbirths to the Regional Office for State Health, who would further investigate the natural loss of a child; in 1943 the ministers of the Interior and Justice enacted the law \"Protection of Marriage, Family and Motherhood\", which made provisions for the death penalty for mothers convicted of infanticide.\n\nIn line with Nazi racial theory, the Nazi government promoted the \"Aryan\" (Nordic) archetype as the ideal physical appearance: women were to be blonde, beautiful, tall, thin and robust all at once. This image was spread as much through advertising as through official art, then through ancient art, and more specifically through Greco-Roman statues. Academic Monique Moser-Verrey notes: \"a revival, during the course of the Thirties, of mythological themes such as the Judgement of Paris.\" Moser-Verrey notes however:\nYet it is striking that the image of women projected by women's literature of the 1930s is clearly contrary to traditional views of sweet housewife spread by Rosenberg and Goebbels. The heroines of women's novels during this period are often a strong and tenacious type of woman, while the sons and husbands are quickly delivered to death. Everything happens as if one perceives through these fictions a true antagonism between the sexes generated by the constant mobilisation of these two groups independent of one another.\nFashion for women in Nazi Germany was problematic for Nazi officials. The Nazi government wanted to propagandize the \"Aryan\" woman. In various posters and other forms of media, this ideal Nazi woman was strong, fertile, and wore historically traditional German clothing. However, Nazi officials also did not want to hinder the German clothing or fashion industries from creating profit, as the government also sought to create a consumerist society based for the most part on German domestic products. These differences in goals often led to disparities in what was considered fashionable, nationalistic, and politically correct for women in Nazi Germany.\n\nHowever, although there was disagreement over how to ideally fashion German \"Aryan\" women, anti-Semitic, anti-American, and anti-French Nazi rhetoric played a key part in molding German women's fashion ideology. The Nazis severely criticized the Western fashions of the 1920s, claiming the Jazz Flapper fashion to be \"French-Dominated\" and \"severely Jewish.\" Additionally, the Nazi Party was strictly against the Flapper style because they felt it masculinized women and created an immoral ideal. Since Nazi propaganda was reliant on shunning women to the private sphere as housewives and mother figures, the want to abolish 1920's fashion in Nazi Germany was logical.\n\nYet, while the Nazi government sought to create a maternal ideal for the Aryan woman, they also sought financial gain from the textile industry. While Hitler urged women to consume, he concluded that women must only consume German products. The creation of a German Fashion Institute that sought to create a Western high fashion niche market created varying opinions on how fashion and Nazi politics should interact.\n\nThe compulsory education for girls was not neglected and boys and girls were placed on the same footing at schools. Girls were encouraged to pursue secondary education but university courses were closed to them. Beginning in 1935 they were required to fulfill a work period of six months for the benefit of the service of women's work, the \"Reichsarbeitsdienst\" \"Deutscher Frauenarbeitsdienst\". Adolf Hitler declared, on April 12, 1942, that the schools of the Reich must gather \"boys and girls from all classes\" to meet \"all the youth of the Reich\". The education manual \"Das kommende Deutschland\" notes that: It was also required that they know the geography of Germany, its hymns as well as the clauses of the Treaty of Versailles.\nThe BDM was particularly regarded as instructing females to avoid \"Rassenschande\" (racial defilement), which was treated with particular importance for young females in order to preserve the Aryan race. During the war, repeated efforts were made to propagate Volkstum (\"racial consciousness\"), to prevent sexual relations between Germans and any foreign workers. Nazi propaganda published pamphlets that enjoined all German women to avoid sexual relations with all foreign workers brought to Germany as a danger to their blood. German women accused of racial defilement were paraded through the streets with a shaved head and placard around her neck detailing her crime. Those convicted were sent to a concentration camp. When Himmler reportedly asked Hitler what the punishment should be for German girls and German women who have been found guilty of race defilement with prisoners of war (POWs) he ordered \"every POW who has relations with a German girl or a German would be shot\" and the German woman should be publicly humiliated by \"having her hair shorn and being sent to a concentration camp\".\n\nRobert Gellately in \"The Gestapo and German Society. Enforcing Racial Policy 1933–1945\" writes about such cases of German women being found guilty of sexual relations with prisoners of war and foreigner workers. One case in March 1941 was of a married woman who had an affair with a French prisoner of war had her head shaved and was marched through the town of Bramberg in Lower Franconia carrying a sign which said, \"I have sullied the honour of the German woman.\" Another case was Dora von Calbitz who in September 1940 was found guilty of having sexual relations with a Pole. She had her head shaved and was placed in the pillory of her town of Oschatz near Leipzig, with a sign that proclaimed, \"I have been a dishonourable German woman in that I sought and had relations with Poles. By doing that I excluded myself from the community of the people.\"\n\nThe education of girls also meant political education; there already existed elite schools of political studies, the Napola (Nationalpolitische Anstalten), one for girls opened in 1939 in Vienna and another in 1942 in Luxembourg. These institutions did not have a purpose of enabling women to re-enter political life but of endowing the best with the cultural baggage required to occupy posts related to the management of women's affairs. This concerned a very small minority. However, on June 5, 1942, the MInister of Finance Lutz Schwerin von Krosigk, a conservative politician, threatened to cut grants to the second school, if it did not become a simple internship for adolescents, rejecting all political education for girls. Adolf Hitler decided otherwise on June 24, 1943, promising the construction of three new Napola.\nWhen the Hitler Youth was devoted to organizing the extra-curricular life of male adolescents, the Bund Deutscher Mädel (BDM), occupied female adolescents from 14 to 18 years. Founded in 1934, the movement was needed after the law of December 1, 1936. It was led from 1934 to 1937 by Trude Mohr, then from 1937 to 1945 by the psychologist Jutta Rüdiger. Young girls were trained for certain employment (social work, cleaning) or farming (Ernteeinsatz, helping with harvest) and practised sports ; but shockingly, as the education manual \"Das kommende Deutschland\" shows, the physical performance demanded was sometimes the same as those of the boys (for example, to run 60 meters in less than 12 seconds). Every Wednesday evening, for girls from 15 to 20 years old, the \" home parties \" took place, for discussing art and culture. Vacation camps, held for one week during Summer, in Germany or abroad, were organized. There also existed a required six-month work service, the Reichsarbeitsdienst der weiblichen Jugend (National Young Women's Work Service), completed in 1941 with six extra months in the Kriegshilfsdienst (for the war effort). For young women aged 18 to 25 years old wishing to find work, in 1938 the Pflichtjahr was instituted, one year of obligatory service in farming or domestic work.\n\nWomen could be members of the Nazi Party, but newcomers to the party were only admitted if they were \"useful\" (nurses or cooks for example). They numbered 5% of women in 1933 and 17% in 1937. But since October 1931 the NS-Frauenschaft (NSF) existed, the political organization for Nazi women, that sought above all to promote the ideal of the model woman of Nazi Germany; at its foundation, it was responsible for training in housekeeping. Young women joined when they were 15 years old. On 31 December 1932, the NSF counted 109,320 members. In 1938, it had 2 million, corresponding to 40% of the total number of party members. The NSF was directed by Gertrud Scholtz-Klink, who had the title of Reichsführerin; she called the members \"my daughters\" and acquired a strong influence over them and a certain credibility. Her views on women were obviously in agreement with those of Adolf Hitler, but she still defended access to some positions of responsibility. She did not participate in major meetings of the party but was invited to the party congress.\n\nSchool textbooks were edited beginning in 1934, often under the supervision of the doctor , an author notably for \"The German Mother and Her First Baby\", which was widely published, and promoting the driving role of the German mother in building the regime, or \"Mother, tell me about Adolf Hitler\" (\"Mutter, erzähl von Adolf Hitler\"), to lead women to indoctrinate their children in Nazi values:\nHousekeeping training was promoted through Frauenwerk (German Women's Work), which opened thematic courses for \"ethnically pure\" women. It is notable, however, that although there were numerous courses for domestic training, gymnastics and music, they deserted those oriented towards antireligious teaching.\n\nThe NS-Frauenschaft \"played no political role and did not oppose the loss of hard-won women's rights. It defended the role of the mother of the family at home, conscious of their duties at the heart of the community. Provided, containing women within the private sphere does not hide their responsibilities under the Third Reich ; we know today that the Frauenbewegung (women's movement) thought the place of a woman in society was at the heart of a community that excluded Jews and performed a civilizing mission in occupied Eastern Europe to preserve the race\".\n\nDuring the Second World War, temporarily contradicting their past claims, the National Socialists changed policy and allowed women to join the German army. Adolf Hitler had already affirmed in a speech to activists of the National Socialist Women's League on September 13, 1936: \"We possess a generation of healthy men - and we, National Socialists, are going to watch - Germany will not form any section of women grenade throwers or any corps of women elite snipers.\" Therefore, women were not assigned to combat units during the war, but were regarded as auxiliary military personnel, responsible for logistical and administrative duties in the areas understaffed due to the number of men sent into combat. Other women also worked in factories or in military education. Military members of the \"Reichsbahn\" (National Company of Railways) or the \"Feuerwehr\" (firefighters) wore uniforms appropriate to the era, especially with a skirt. Gertrud Scholtz-Klink, NSDAP member and leader of the National Socialist Women's League stated: \n\nBeginning in 1943, the Reich Minister of the Economy introduced the job training program called \"Berufsausbildungsprogramm Ost\" for farming duty in the East (not to be confused with the ethnic cleansing of Generalplan Ost). He extended the existing laws of the Reich, concerning the protection of minors and of employment standards for the \"League of German Girls\" (\"Bund Deutscher Mädel\") \"Osteinsatz\", for whom such work was compulsory. Adolescent girls were employed in the Brandebourg Market for the agricultural work program. They were active in the resettlement areas of occupied Poland as their assignment. Yet, referring to the decree of January 1943, calling for the mobilization of German women aged 17 to 45, Gertrud Scholtz-Klink from NSDAP said in September of that year at a conference in Bad Schlachen: \n\nThe Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels in his \"Sportspalast\" speech delivered on February 18, 1943 at the Berlin Sports Hall, called on German women to work, and to be sober in their commitment:\n\nThe mobilisation of women in the war economy always remained limited: the number of women practising a professional activity in 1944 was virtually unchanged from 1939, being about 15 million women, in contrast to Great Britain, so that the use of women did not progress and only 1,200,000 of them worked in the arms industry in 1943, in working conditions that were difficult and often poorly treated by their bosses, who deplored their lack of qualification.\n\nIn 1945, there numbered 500,000 women auxiliaries in the Wehrmacht (Wehrmachtshelferinnen), who were at the heart of the Heer, the Luftwaffe and the Kriegsmarine. About half of them were volunteers, the others performing obligatory service connected to the war effort (Kriegshilfsdienst). They took part, under the same authority as prisoners of war (Hiwis), as auxiliary personnel of the army (Behelfspersonal) and they were assigned to duties not only within the heart of the Reich, but to a lesser extent, to the occupied territories, for example in the General government of occupied Poland, in France, and later in Yugoslavia, in Greece and in Romania.\n\nThey essentially participated :\n\nThe was the women's wing of the men's SS, but in contrast it was only confined to voluntary work in Emergency Service (Notdienstverpflichtung). SS Women belonged either to the \"\" or the \"SS-Kriegshelferinnen\". They were in charge of auxiliary transmissions (telephone, radio operators, stenographers) in the SS and sometimes in camps (these were the Aufseherin, see next section). There was an internal hierarchy in the women's wing of the SS, which had no influence on the male troops, although the titles designated to the women sometimes had an influence upon the owners.\n\nThe SS-Helferinnen were trained at the Reichsschule-SS at Oberehnheim in Elsass. The Reichsschule-SS (in full, the Reichsschule für SS Helferinnen Oberenheim) was the training centre for the SS, reserved for women, and opened in Obernai in May 1942 upon the order of Heinrich Himmler. The training was more difficult than that for women enrolled in the German Army. They had to meet certain physical criteria determined by the regime: they must be aged 17 to 30 years and measure more than tall, while over the long term, the enrollment criteria were relaxed (the age limit was raised to 40 years and minimum height dropped to 1.58 metres); they even accepted 15 Muslim students. Having been in a privileged status, war widows were favoured before the admissions were opened up to other social classes. Women enrolled at the Reichsschule-SS came from various economic, class and educational backgrounds and included a member of the aristocracy in the ranks, Princess Ingeborg Alix. The Reichsshule-SS appealed to female Nazi ideologues who foresaw the possibility of social ascent by becoming an SS-Helferin, and candidates were often from families with other SS and NSDAP members. In her review of Jutta Muhlenberg's book, \"Das SS-Helferinnenkorps: Ausbildung, Einsatz und Entnazifizierung der weiblichen Angehörigen der Waffen-SS 1942–1949\", Rachel Century writes: The school closed in 1944 due to the advance of the Allies.\n\nWomen were within the ranks of the Nazis at the Nazi concentration camps : these were the Aufseherin and generally belonged to the SS. They were guards, secretaries or nurses. They arrived before the start of the war, some of them being trained from 1938 in Lichtenburg. This took place due to the need for personnel following the growing number of political prisoners after the Kristallnacht on 8 and 9 November 1938. After 1939, they were trained at Camp Ravensbrück near Berlin. Coming mostly from lower- or middle-class social origins, they previously worked in traditional professions (hairdresser, teacher, for example) but were, in contrast to men who were required to fulfill military serve, the women were driven by a sincere desire to reach the female wing of the SS, the SS-Gefolge. Of the 55,000 total number of guards at all the Nazi camps, there were 3,600 women (approximately 10% of the workforce), however, no woman was allowed to give orders to a man.\n\nThey worked at the Auschwitz and Majdanek camps beginning in 1942. The following year, the Nazis began the conscription of women because of the shortage of guards. Later, during the war, women were also assigned on a smaller scale in the camps Neuengamme Auschwitz (I, II and III), Plaszow Flossenbürg, Gross-Rosen Vught and Stutthof, but never served in the death camps of Bełżec, Sobibór Treblinka or Chełmno. Seven Aufseherinnen served at Vught, 24 were at Buchenwald, 34 at Bergen-Belsen, 19 at Dachau, 20 at Mauthausen, three at Mittelbau-Dora, seven at Natzweiler-Struthof, twenty at Majdanek, 200 at Auschwitz and its sub-camps, 140 at Sachsenhausen, 158 at Neuengamme, 47 at Stutthof, compared with 958 who served at Ravensbrück, 561 at Flossenbürg and 541 at Gross-Rosen. Many supervisors worked in the sub-camps in Germany, some in France, Austria, Czechoslovakia and Poland.\n\nThere was a hierarchy within the \"Aufseherin\" position, including the following higher ranks: the \"Rapportaufseherin\" (head Aufseherin), the \"Erstaufseherin\" (first guard), the \"Lagerführerin\" (head of the camp), and finally, the \"Oberaufseherin\" (senior inspector), a post only occupied by Anna Klein and Luise Brunner.\n\nUnder the same threats as men who were Jews or Romani, women belonging to these communities were equally discriminated against, then deported and for some exterminated. In many concentration camps there were sections for female detainees (notably at Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen) but the camp at Ravensbrück, opened in May 1939, distinguished itself as a camp solely for women, by 1945 numbering about 100,000 prisoners. The first women's concentration camp had been opened in 1933 in Moringen, before being transferred to Lichtenburg in 1938.\n\nIn concentration camps, women were considered weaker than men, and they were generally sent to the gas chambers more quickly, whereas the strength of men was used to work the men to exhaustion. Some women were subjected to medical experiments.\n\nSome took the path of the Resistance, such as the Polish member Haika Grossman, who participated in the organization for aid for the ghetto of Białystok, during the night of August 15 to 16, 1943. On October 7, 1944, members of the Sonderkommando, 250 prisoners responsible for the bodies of persons after gassing, rose up ; they had procured explosives stolen by a Kommando of young Jewish women (Ala Gertner, Regina Safir, Estera Wajsblum and Roza Robota) who worked in the armament factories of the \"Union Werke\". They succeeded in partially destroying Crematorium IV.\n\nIn addition to the resistors forced into their commitment because of their risk of being deported and exterminated because of their race, some were also committed against the German Nazi regime. Women represented approximately 15% of the Resistance. Monique Moser-Verrey notes however: \nThe student Communist Liselotte Herrmann protested in 1933 against the appointment of Adolf Hitler as chancellor and managed to get information to foreign governments about the rearmament of Germany. In 1935 she was arrested, sentenced to death two years later and executed in 1938. She was the first German mother to suffer the death penalty since the beginning of the regime. Twenty women from Düsseldorf, who saw their fathers, brothers and son deported to the camp Börgermoor, managed to smuggle out the famous \"The Song of the deportees\" and make it known. Freya von Moltke, Mildred Harnack-Fish and Libertas Schulze-Boysen participated in the Resistance group Kreisau Circle and Red Orchestra; the last two were arrested and executed. The 20-year-old student Sophie Scholl, a member of The White Rose was executed February 22, 1943 with her brother Hans Scholl and Christoph Probst, for posting leaflets. The resistor Maria Terwiel helped to spread knowledge of the famous sermons condemning the Nazi movement given by Clemens von Galen, Bishop of Munster, as well as helping Jews escape to abroad. She was executed on 5 August 1943. The successful protests of women can also be noted, called the Rosenstraße, racially \"Aryan\" women married to Jews who, in February 1943, obtained the release of their husbands.\n\nWomen also fought for the Resistance from abroad, like Dora Schaul, a Communist who had left Germany in 1934 and involved from July 1942 with clandestine networks, Deutsch Arbeit (German Labour) and Deutsche-Feldpost (My German countryside), from the School of Military Health in Lyon. Hilde Meisel attempted in 1933 to galvanize British public opinion against the Nazi regime. She returned to Germany during the war but was executed at the bend of a road.\n\nA little over half of the Righteous Among the Nations recognized by Yad Vashem are women. While many of them acted in cooperation with other family members, some of these courageous women were the initiators of the rescue and acted independently to save Jews.\n\nAlthough women did not have political power in Nazi Germany, a circle of influence did exist around Adolf Hitler. Within this circle, Hitler became acquainted with the British Unity Mitford and Magda Goebbels, wife of the Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels. Magda Goebbels became known by the nickname \"First Lady of the Third Reich\": she represented the regime during State visits and official events. Her marriage to Goebbels on December 19, 1931 was considered a society event, where Leni Riefenstahl was a notable guest. She posed as the model German mother for Mothers Day. Eleonore Baur, a friend of Hitler since 1920 (she had participated in the Beer Hall putsch) was the only woman to receive the Blood Order; she also participated in official receptions and was close to Heinrich Himmler, who even named her a colonel of the SS and permitted her free access to the concentration camps, which she went to regularly, particularly Dachau. Hitler did not forget that he owed part of his political ascension to women integrated in the society world (aristocrats or industrialists), such as Elsa Bruckmann.\n\nWomen were also able to distinguish themselves in certain domains, but they were the exceptions that proved the rule. Thus Leni Riefenstahl was the official film director of the regime and was given enormous funding for her cinematic productions (\"Triumph of the Will\", and \"Olympia\"). Winifred Wagner directed the highly publicized Bayreuth Festival, and soprano Elisabeth Schwarzkopf was promoted as the \"Nazi diva\", as noted by an American newspaper. Hanna Reitsch, an aviator, distinguished herself with her handling of test aircraft and military projects of the regime, notably the V1 flying bomb.\n\nAfter the collapse of Nazi Germany, many German women nicknamed \"Trümmerfrauen\" (\"Rubble Women\") participated in the rebuilding of Germany by clearing up the ruins resulting from the war. In the Soviet occupation zone, more than two million women were victims of rape. One of them would publish a memoir recalling this experience: \"Eine Frau in Berlin\" (A Woman In Berlin). As the Soviets entered German territory, German women typically had no choice, save suicide, to comply. Age did not matter with victimization crossing the generational strata entirely. Famed Russian author Alexander Solzhenitsyn, outraged by finding the body of a small girl murdered following a gang rape, wrote a scathing poem to mark the moment for posterity \"(right)\".\nWhat Solzhenitsyn's poem also reveals is the penchant for revenge the Red Army exacted upon Germany, a recompense promulgated by Soviet leaders. Soviet troops were given a certain degree of license in the early victories in repulsing the Germans, as even Josef Stalin expressed outright indifference towards rape. An example is discernible in what Stalin once asked Yugoslav's communist leader Milovan Djilas, \"Can’t he understand it if a soldier who has crossed thousands of kilometers through blood and fire and death has fun with a woman or takes some trifle?\" Many German women died in the midst of such trifles, their husbands and families suffering immeasurable grief along with them, and some of them chose to take their own lives in lieu of being raped. Even when not raped, women hid in apartments, cellars, and closets for fear of being violated, experiencing hunger, fear, and loneliness which left psychological scars for years to come. For more background see: Rape during the occupation of Germany.\n\nThe question of the culpability of the German people in their support of Nazism has long overshadowed the women, who had little political power under the regime. Thus, as explained by the German historian Gisela Bock, who was involved with the first historians to highlight this issue, by asking women during the Nazi era. In 1984, in \"When Biology Became Destiny, Women in Weimar and Nazi Germany\", she wrote that women who are enslaved economically and morally, cannot exercise their freedom by being confined in the home and placed under the rule of their husbands. Thus, we associate studies on the subject during the 1980s mainly with perceptions that women were victims of \"machismo\" and a \"misogynist\" fascism. In terms of voting patterns, a higher proportion of male voters supported the Nazi party compared to female voters.\n\nHowever, the simplicity of this analysis tends to disappear with recent studies. In 1987, historian Claudia Koonz, in \"Mothers in Fatherland, Women, the Family and Nazi Politics\" questioned this statement and acknowledged some guilt. She states as follows: \"Far from being impressionable or innocent, women made possible State murder in the name of interests that they defined as maternal.\" For her, the containing of housewives just allowed them to assert themselves and grasp an identity, especially through women's associations led by Nazi Gertrud Scholtz-Klink. They therefore helped to stabilize the system. The women took pleasure in politics and eugenics of the state, which promised financial assistance if the birth rate was high, so they would help to stabilize the system \"by preserving the illusion of love in an environment of hate.\" In addition, if Gisela Bock denounced the work of her colleague as \"anti-feminist\", others as refuse to stop at a strict choice between complicity and oppression and are more interested in how Nazism included women in their project for Germany. Recent work from historian Wendy Lower (consultant to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum), demonstrates that a substantial number of women were accomplices to Nazi atrocities, and sometimes direct participants. Such realities make it abundantly clear that by the time the war ended, German women had traversed the full-circle of being once sheltered incubators for the Aryan future to effectual contributors in the Nazi concentration camp system.\n\nThere are many militant neo-Nazis or defenders of former Nazis, such as the Germans or Gudrun Himmler (daughter of Heinrich Himmler), who are active through the organization Stille Hilfe, and the French citizens Françoise Dior and Savitri Devi.\n\n\n\n"}
