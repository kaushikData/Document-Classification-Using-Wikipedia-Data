For example, in a bank robbery, the person who points the gun at the teller and asks for the money is guilty of armed robbery. Anyone else directly involved in the commission of the crime, such as the lookout or the getaway car driver, is an accomplice, even if in the absence of an underlying offense keeping a lookout or driving a car would not be an offense.\n\nAn accomplice differs from an accessory in that an accomplice is present at the actual crime, and could be prosecuted even if the main criminal (the \"principal\") is not charged or convicted. An accessory is generally not present at the actual crime, and may be subject to lesser penalties than an accomplice or principal.\n\nAt law, an accomplice has lesser guilt than the person he or she is assisting, is subject to lesser prosecution for the same crime, and faces the smaller criminal penalties. As such, the three accomplices to the bank robbery above can also to a degree be found guilty of armed robbery even if only one stole money.\n\nThe fairness of the doctrine that the accomplice is still guilty has been subject to much discussion, particularly in cases of capital crimes. Accomplices have been prosecuted for felony murder even if the actual person who committed the murder died at the crime scene or otherwise did not face capital punishment.\n\nIn jurisdictions based on the common law, the concept of an accomplice has often been heavily modified by statute, or replaced by new concepts entirely.\n\nCriminal law in Canada is governed by the Criminal Code, a federal statute. Parliament has abolished the concepts of accomplice and accessory, and instead created a single statutory concept, namely being party to an offence:\n\nA person can become a party to an offence where they \"encourage\" another (the principal) with words or acts, and intend to encourage.\n\nMere presence at the scene of an offence is not sufficient grounds for liability. More involvement is needed, such as: \n\nHowever, presence at the commission of the offence is \"evidence\" of aiding or abetting if accompanied by other factors.\n\nOne of the most notorious cases of this type was the 1952 case in England involving Derek Bentley, a mentally challenged man who was in police custody when his sixteen-year-old companion, Christopher Craig, shot and killed a police constable during a botched break-in. Craig was sentenced to be detained at Her Majesty's Pleasure, since as a juvenile offender he could not be sentenced to death (he was released after serving ten years), but Bentley was hanged despite popular protest. The incident was dramatized in the film \"Let Him Have It\", which is what Bentley allegedly said to Craig during the incident, which can be interpreted either as telling Craig to shoot the policeman, or to give him the gun. The hanging of Bentley led to public outrage and sparked the MP Sydney Silverman's campaign to abolish capital punishment in the United Kingdom, achieved c. 1965.\n\nAiding and abetting is a provision in United States criminal law, for situations where it cannot be shown the party personally carried out the criminal offense, but where another person may have carried out the illegal act(s) as an agent of the charged, working together with or under the direction of the charged party, who is an accessory to the crime.\n\nIt is derived from the United States Code (U.S.C.), section two of title 18:\nWhere the term \"principal\" refers to any actor who is primarily responsible for a criminal offense.\n\nAn accomplice was often referred to as an abettor. This term is not in active use in the United States, having been replaced by \"accomplice\".\n\n"}

Though very little is known about his life, his collection of hymns about philosophy, devotion and spirituality in vernacular languages are popular and still sung in Jain temples.\n\nThere is no historical information available about life of Anandghan. The majority of information is based in hagiographies and oral history.\n\nHe was born in Rajputana (now Rajasthan, India). His dates differs according to sources. Generally 1603 or 1604 is accepted but he could have born before 1624 according to some estimation. His childhood name was Labhanand. He was initiated as Jain monk and named Labhavijay. He might belonged to Tapa Gaccha branch of Murtipujaka Svetambara Jainism but Jain monastic hierarchy does not mention him. He might have lived as ascetic not associated with any organized ascetic branches. He stayed in the area of present-day north Gujarat and Rajasthan in India. Legends associate him with Mount Abu and Jodhpur. He is associated with Yashovijay also and said to have met him. He could have died in Medata in Rajasthan as a hall is dedicated to him is there. His death dates varies according to sources. Generally accepted dates are 1673 or 1674 but could have died before 1694.\n\nHis language is mix of vernacular languages like Gujarati, Rajasthani and Braj. It follows Rajasthani style of diction but is written in medieval Gujarati. It was the time when Bhakti movement was at peak and majority of devotional poets of time wrote in such vernacular languages. His works are focused bhakti (devotion) as well as internal spirituality.\n\n\"Anandghan Chauvisi\" is the philosophical treatises which supposed to contain twenty four hymns but contains twenty two. Other two hymns were later added by others. Each verse is dedicated to one of twenty four Jain tirthankaras. The legend tells that he composed these hymns in Mount Abu during his meet with Yashovijay who memorised them.\n\n\"Anandghan Bahattari\" is the anthology of hymns which differs in a number of hymns according to different manuscripts. This anthology was formed by 1775 and was transmitted orally as well as the written manuscripts. It contains \"pada\" (verses) with different ragas. Some of these verses drawn from other poets like Kabir, Surdas, Banarasidas and others.\n\nYashovijay, the philosopher Jain monk, was influenced by him. He wrote commentary on \"Chauvisi\" and also wrote eight verse \"Ashtapadi\" dedicated to him.\n\nHis hymns are still popular in followers of Jainism as well as non-Jains because they are nonsectarian in nature and put emphasis on internal spirituality. They are sung in Jain temples. They are found in religious hymn collections especially in the collection of Digambara hymns even though he is associated with Svetambara sects. A religious camp organized by Shrimad Rajchandra Mission of Rakesh Jhaveri in 2006 at Dharampur, Gujarat had lectures on \"Chauvisi\". Mahatma Gandhi included his hymn, \"One may say Rama, Rahman, Krishna or Shiva, then\" in \"Ashram Bhajanavali\", his prayer book.\n\nA Gujarai play \"Apoorava Khela\" (2012) based on his life was produced by Dhanvant Shah and directed by Manoj Shah.\n\n"}

Bach claimed that dew found on flower petals retain imagined healing properties of that plant. Systematic reviews of clinical trials of Bach flower solutions have found no efficacy beyond a placebo effect.\n\nThe solutions, which contain a 50:50 mix of water and brandy, are called mother tincture. Stock remedies—the solutions sold in shops—are dilutions of mother tincture into other liquid. Most often the liquid used is alcohol, so that the alcohol level by volume in most stock Bach remedies is between 25 and 40% (50 to 80 proof). The solutions do not have a characteristic scent or taste of the plant because of dilution. The dilution process results in the statistical likelihood that little more than a single molecule may remain; it is claimed that the remedies contain \"energetic\" or \"vibrational\" nature of the flower and that this can be transmitted to the user. The solutions are described by some as vibrational medicines, which implies they rely on the pseudoscientific concept of water memory. They are often labeled as homeopathic because they are extremely diluted in water, but are not homeopathy as they do not follow other homeopathic ideas such as the law of similars.\n\nIn a 2002 database review of randomized trials Edzard Ernst concluded:\n\nThe hypothesis that flower remedies are associated with effects beyond a placebo response is not supported by data from rigorous clinical trials.\n\nAll randomized double-blind studies, whether finding for or against the solutions, have suffered from small cohort sizes but the studies using the best methods were the ones that found no effect over placebo. The most likely means of action for flower remedies is as placebos, enhanced by introspection on the patient's emotional state, or simply being listened to by the practitioner. The act of selecting and taking a remedy may act as a calming ritual.\n\nA systematic review in 2009 concluded:\nMost of the available evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of BFRs has a high risk of bias. We conclude that, based on the reported adverse events in these six trials, BFRs are probably safe. Few controlled prospective trials of BFRs for psychological problems and pain exist. Our analysis of the four controlled trials of BFRs for examination anxiety and ADHD indicates that there is no evidence of benefit compared with a placebo intervention.\n\nA newer systematic review published in 2010 by Ernst concluded All placebo-controlled trials failed to demonstrate efficacy. It is concluded that the most reliable clinical trials do not show any differences between flower remedies and placebos.\n\nFlower remedies are sometimes promoted as being capable of boosting the immune system, but \"there is no scientific evidence to prove that flower remedies can control, cure or prevent any type of disease, including cancer\".\n\nEach solution is used alone or in conjunction with other solutions, and each flower is said by advocates to impart specific qualities. The solutions are also used on pets and domestic animals. Remedies are usually taken orally.\n\nThe solutions may be recommended by a naturopath or by a trained Bach flower practitioner after an interview. Some vendors recommend dowsing to select a solution.\n\nThe best known solution product is the \"Rescue Remedy\" combination, which contains an equal amount each of rock rose, impatiens, clematis, star of Bethlehem and cherry plum remedies. Rescue Remedy is a trademark and other companies produce the same formula under other names, such as Five Flower Remedy. \"Rescue Cream\" contains the same remedies in a cream form, with the addition of crab apple.\n\nBach believed that illness was the result of a conflict between the purposes of the soul and the personality's actions and outlook. This internal war, according to Bach, leads to negative moods and to \"energy blocking\", thought to cause a lack of \"harmony\", thus leading to physical diseases.\n\nBach derived his solutions intuitively and based on his perceived psychic connections to the plants, rather than using research based on scientific methods. If Bach felt a negative emotion, he would hold his hand over different plants, and if one alleviated the emotion, he would ascribe the power to heal that emotional problem to that plant. He imagined that early-morning sunlight passing through dew-drops on flower petals transferred the healing power of the flower onto the water, so he would collect the dew drops from the plants and preserve the dew with an equal amount of brandy to produce a mother tincture which would be further diluted before use. Later, he found that the amount of dew he could collect was not sufficient, so he would suspend flowers in spring water and allow the sun's rays to pass through them. If this was impractical because of lack of sunlight or other reasons, he wrote that the flowers may be boiled. The result of this process Bach termed the \"mother tincture\", which is then further diluted before sale or use.\n\nBach was satisfied with the method, because of its simplicity, and because it involved a process of combination of the four elements:\n\n\n"}

He received his early education at Cesena and took degrees in Rome. He also frequented the 'studia' of his religious order in Bologna and Naples before assuming the duties of lecturer in Cesena, Perugia and Padua. He died in Meldola in 1673.\n\nHe acquired a profound knowledge of scholastic philosophy and theology, being deeply versed in the writings of Duns Scotus. Nevertheless, he was an open-minded and independent scholar. As a controversialist he was harsh and arrogant towards his opponents, mingling invective with his arguments. His opinions on some philosophical questions were fiercely combatted by many of his contemporaries and especially by Matthew Ferchi and the Irish Franciscan John Punch. When presenting the second volume of his work on the \"Sentences\" to Alexander VII, to whom he had dedicated it, the pope asked him where he had learned to treat his opponent Ferchi in such a rough manner: Mastrius answered,\n\nthe pope smilingly remarked, \"From such masters other things could be learned\".\n\nHe was one of the most prominent writers of his time on philosophy and theology. His \"Philosophy\" in five volumes folio, his \"Commentaries\" on the \"Sentences\" in four volumes, and his Moral Theology \"ad mentem S. Bonaventurae\" in one volume were all published in Venice.\n\nPonce in his treatise on Logic holds that with qualifying explanations God may be included in the Categories. Mastrius in combatting this opinion characteristically says, \"Hic Pontius male tractat Deum sicut et alter\".\n\nMastrius had a well-ordered intellect which is seen in the clearness and precision with which he sets forth the subject-matter of discussion. His arguments for and against a proposition show real critical power and are expressed in accurate and clear language. His numerous quotations from ancient and contemporary authors and various schools of thought are a proof of his extensive reading. His works shed light on some of the difficult questions in Scotistic philosophy and theology.\n\n\n\n"}

This is in contrast to the field of probabilistic programs where humans write new probabilistic (Bayesian) programs.\n\nBayesian probabilities is a strategy to learn distributions over Bayesian programs.\n\nBayesian Program Synthesis can be compared to the work on Bayesian Program Learning by Lake, Salakhutdinov, and Tenenbaum's, where probabilistic program components were hand-written, pre-trained on data, and then hand assembled in order to recognize handwritten characters.\n\nBayesian Program Synthesis (BPS) has been described as a framework related to and utilizing probabilistic programming. In BPS, probabilistic programs are generated that are themselves priors over a space of probabilistic programs. This strategy allows more automatic synthesis of new programs via inference and is achieved by the composition of modular component programs. \n\nThe modularity in BPS allows inference to work on and test smaller probabilistic programs before being integrated into a larger model.\n\nBayesian methods and models are frequently used to incorporate prior knowledge. When good prior knowledge can be incorporated into a Bayesian model, effective inference can often be performed with much less data.\n\nThis framework can be also be contrasted with the family of automated program synthesis fields, including program synthesis, programming by example, and programming by demonstration. The goal in such fields is to find the best program that satisfies some constraint. In program synthesis, for instance, verification of logical constraints reduce the state space of possible programs, allowing more efficient search to find an optimal program. Bayesian Program Synthesis differs both in that the constraints are probabilistic and the output is itself a distribution over programs that can be further refined.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "44158675", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44158675", "title": "Bianhua", "text": "Bianhua\n\nBianhua meaning \"transformation, metamorphosis\" was a keyword in both Daoism and Chinese Buddhism. Daoists used \"bianhua\" describing things transforming from one type to another, such as from a caterpillar to a butterfly. Buddhist translators used \"bianhua\" for Sanskrit \"nirmāṇa\" \"manifest through transformations\", such as the \"nirmāṇa-kaya\" \"transformation body\" of a Buddha's reincarnations.\n\nIn Chinese linguistic morphology, \"biànhuà\" 變化 (lit. \"change change\") \"change (esp. in form or character); variation; transformation; metamorphosis; reincarnation\" is categorized as a \"synonymic compound\" whose parts are synonyms, e.g., \"jiannan\" 艱難 \"difficult; hard\" compounds \"jian\" 艱 \"difficult; arduous\" and \"nan\" 難 \"difficult; troublesome\" (Chao 1968:375).\n\nFor the Old Chinese etymologies, Axel Schuessler (2007: 166, 222) has \"bian\" 變 < *\"prans\" \"to change\" cognate with Tai \"plian\" \"to change\" and perhaps Written Tibetan \"sprul-ba\" or \"ˈpʰrul-ba\" \"juggle; appear; change; transform\"; and \"hua\" < \"hŋrôih \" 化 \"to transform' change\", e.g., from a fish into a bird; people through education; raw food through cooking\", cognate with \"e\" < *\"ŋôi\" 吪 \"to move; act; change\", with possible Tibeto-Burman etymological links to Kinnauri \"skwal\" \"to change\" or Khaling \"kʰwaal\" \"to shift; move\". Walter Simon (1957) proposed the Sino-Tibetan etymological link between Chinese \"bian\" \"change; transform\" and Tibetan language \"sprul\" \"juggle; perform tricks of illusion; change\", and noted that the Chinese and Tibetan Buddhists chose these words to translate the Sanskrit technical vocabulary meaning \"change; illusory transformation\", such as, both \"sprul-sku\" and \"bianhuashen\" 變化身 translate \"nirmāṇa-kaya\" \"transformation body\".\n\nIn Modern Standard Chinese usage, \"biàn\" 變 or 变 means \"change; become, change into; transform; perform (magic/etc.)\"; and \"huà\" 化 means \"change, transform, convert; melt; dissolve, thaw; digest, remove; burn up, incinerate; disguise; [religion] die, pass away\" (DeFrancis 2003: 40, 374). Some common \"chengyu\" \"four-character idioms\" based upon \"bianhua\" are: \"biànhuàduōduān\" 變化多端 (with \"many kinds\") \"changeable\", \"biànhuàmòcè\" 變化莫測 (with \"unmeasurable\") \"changeable; unpredictable\", \"biànhuàwúcháng\" 變化無常 (with \"changeable\") \"constantly changing; unending changes\", and \"qiānbiànwànhuà\" 千變萬化 (with \"1000\" and \"10,000\") \"ever-changing (esp. tides and fortunes)\".\n\nThe modern Chinese character 變 for \"bian\" is classified as a radical-phonetic graph, combining the semantically significant \"strike\" radical or at the bottom with the phonetic indicator \"luan\" (from \"words\" between two \"silk threads\") at the top. \"Bian\" was first recorded on Zhou dynasty bronze script; \"The meaning of the drawing is uncertain, but it contains two hanks of silk, and Xu Shen [in his ca. 100 CE \"Shuowen Jiezi\"] said that it meant 'to bring into order', as in spinning or reeling\" (Mair 1989: 44). The modern character 化 for \"hua\" is classified as a compound-ideograph, combining the \"person\" radical or on the left and \"spoon\" radical on the right. However, in earlier bronze script and oracle script forms of 化, the right side was originally a 人 \"person\" upside-down, depicting \"a person who flips, changes\" (Wenlin 2012).\n\nChinese has a rich lexicon of words meaning \"change\", including \"bian\", \"hua\", \"fan\" 反 \"turn over; return; counter; oppose\", \"huan\" 還 \"go/come back; give back; return; repay\", \"yi\" 易 \"change\" (as in the \"Yijing\"), and \"yi\" 移 \"shift; adapt; modify; adjust\"; and Joseph Needham (1956 : 74) notes, \"the exact meaning of which are sometimes difficult to differentiate\".\n\nSemantically distinguishing between \"bian\" and \"hua\" is multifaceted. Compare these explanations.\nThe exact difference between [\"bian\"] and \"hua\" is perhaps more uncertain [than \"fan\" \"reaction\" and \"huan\" \"return\"]. In modern Chinese usage, [\"bian\"] tends to signify gradual change, transformation or metamorphosis; while \"hua\" tends to mean sudden and profound transmutation or alteration (as in a rapid chemical reaction)—but there is no very strict frontier between the words. [\"Bian\"] could be used of weather changes, insect metamorphosis, or slow personality transformations; \"hua\" may refer to the transition points in dissolving, liquefying, melting, etc., and to profound decay. [\"Bian\"] tends to be associated with form (\"xing\") and \"hua\" with matter ([\"zhi\"]). When a snowman melts, the form changes ([\"bian\"]) as the snow melts (\"hua\") to water. In the Sung dynasty, [Cheng Yi] explained \"bian\" as implying inward change with full or partial conservation of the external Gestalt or form, and \"hua\" as fundamental change in which the outward appearance is also altered. (Needham 1956: 74) \n\"Hua\" 化 denotes a fundamental and essential change—a transformation. However, sometimes one also encounters the word [\"bian\"], denoting external, momentary, or apparent change. A \"locus classicus\" for this distinction is in the [\"Guanzi\"] ...: \"The exemplary man ([\"shengren\"]) changes ([\"bian\"]) in accordance with the times without transforming [the essence of his being]\" ... This in turn permits us to understand the passage in the [\"Huangdi neijing suwen\"] ...: \"When the beings take rise (\"sheng\" 生 ...), this is called \"hua\" (transformation); when the beings have reached their full development [極] ... [and consequently have taken on a different appearance], this is called [\"bian\"] (change). (Porkert 1978: 44, quoted by Mair 1989: 44) \n\"Bian\" has the sense of alteration among states of being (for example, from a \"yin\" to a \"yang\" state, or vice versa) or of variation within defined parameters. It differs from \"hua\" 化, \"transformation\", in implying alternation or variation rather than fundamental and lasting change. The change from a caterpillar to a butterfly, for example, which is both substantive and irreversible, is a frequently cited instance of \"hua\" in the earlier literature. By contrast, a change that involves the realignment of constituent parts in a dynamic system (and that may be or is regularly reversed), such as that from day to night and back again, would be considered an instance of \"bian\". (Major et al. 2010: 871) \n\nWing-Tsit Chan (1952: 166) lists \"bianhua\" \"transfiguration and transformation\" as a basic Chinese philosophical concept. \"Bianhua\" has very diverse meanings, from basic \"change and transformation\" to \"universal life\" or \"creation\", even referring to the Daoist \"science of metamorphosis\" and generically \"supernatural powers obtained by either magical practices or meditation exercises\" (Robinet 1993: 153).\n\nThe (c. 4th century) encyclopedic \"Guanzi\" text uses \"bianhua\" 5 times (3 in the \"Xinshu\" 心術 \"Mind Techniques\" chapters). Where the \"Xingshi\" 形勢 \"Conditions and Circumstances\" chapter says \"The Way brings about the transformation of the self\", the corresponding 形勢解 \"Explanation\" chapter elucidates (tr. Rickett 1998: 82) \"The Way is the means by which the self is transformed so a person will adhere to correct principles.\"\n\nThe ancient \"Yijing\" or \"Book of Changes\" has 12 usages of \"bianhua\" describing the manifestation of everything in heaven and on earth. All occur in the (c. 3rd century BCE) Ten Wings commentaries, and none in the (c. 7th century BCE) core hexagram and line statements.\n\nFor hexagram 1 \"Qian\" 乾 \"The Creative\", the Commentary on the Decision (彖傳傳) says:\nKong Yingda's sub-commentary (from Nielsen 2013: 115) distinguishes \"bian\" and \"hua\": \"'Alternation' refers to afterwards changing from a former state, it has gradually changed. This is called 'alteration'. 'Transformation' refers to existence in one moment and absence of existence in the next, it has suddenly changed. This is called 'transformation'.\"\n\n\"Bianhua\" occurs most often (8 times) in the Appended Judgments Commentary (繫辭傳) or Great Commentary (大傳). Three contexts mention the work of divine sages.\n\nIn written Japanese, 変化 can be pronounced \"henka\" \"change (state)\" (in \"Kan-on\" reading) or the Buddhist \"henge\" 変化 \"incarnation\" (\"Go-on\" reading). The \"Nihon Kokugo Daijiten\" (2001) notes both pronunciations were first recorded during the Nara period; \"henge\" 変化 \"A god, Buddha, spirit, etc. that temporarily appearing in human form, or such a thing. Avatar. Reincarnation\" (神仏, 天人などが仮に人間の姿になって現われること. また, そのもの. 神仏の化身 (けしん). 権化 (ごんげ).; c. 810-824 \"Nihon Ryōiki\"); and \"henka\" 変化 \"A change from one nature, state, etc. to another, or, such changeability\" (ある性質, 状態などが他の性質や状態に変わること, または, 変えること.; 827 \"Keikokushū\").\n\nThe Daoist idea of \"bianhua\" (metamorphosis, or \"change and transformation\"), \"that the certainty that the world is in flux leaves open the possibility that things may transform from one type to another\" (Csikszentmihalyi 2008: 229), can be traced from the \"Zhuangzi\" through the Shangqing School.\n\nThe (c. 3rd century BCE) \"Zhuangzi\" was the first Daoist text to explain \"bianhua\" \"transformation and metamorphosis\". The word occurs five times (all in the Outer Chapters), referring to the ability of things to change from one category to another. For instance, \nSpring and summer precede, autumn and winter come after—such is the sequence of the four seasons. The myriad things evolve and develop; even twisted little shoots have their own special shapes—such are the gradations of fullness and decline, the flow of transformation and evolution [\"bianhua\"]. (13, tr. Mair 1994: 123) \nThe \"Zhuangzi\" text begins with a parable about interspecific metamorphosis.\nIn the darkness of the Northern Ocean, there is a fish named K'un. The K'un is so big that no one knows how many thousands of tricents [three hundred paces] its body extends. After it metamorphoses [\"hua\"] into a bird, its name becomes P'eng. The P'eng is so huge that no one knows how many thousands of tricents its back stretches. Rousing itself to flight, its wings are like clouds suspended in the sky. (1, tr. Mair 1994: 3) \nThe \"Zhuangzi\" uses the closely related word \"wuhua\" 物化 \"transformation of things\" ten times, most famously in the story of Zhuangzi dreaming he was a butterfly.\nOnce upon a time Chuang Chou dreamed that he was a butterfly, a butterfly flitting about happily enjoying himself. He didn't know that he was Chou. Suddenly he awoke and was palpably Chou. He did not know whether he was Chou who had dreamed of being a butterfly or a butterfly dreaming that he was Chou. Now, there must be a difference between Chou and the butterfly. This is called the transformation of things. (2, tr. Mair 1994: 24) \n\nA \"Zhuangzi\" passage explains change in the sense of evolutionary continuity.\nIn seeds there are germs [幾]. When they are found in water they become filaments. When they are found at the border of water and land they become algae. When they germinate in elevated places they become plantain. When the plantain is found in fertile soil it becomes crow's foot. The crow's foot's roots become scarab grubs and its leaves become butterflies. The butterflies soon evolve into insects that are born beneath the stove. They have the appearance of exuviae and are called \"house crickets:\" After a thousand days the house crickets become birds called \"dried surplus bones.\" The spittle of the dried surplus bones becomes a misty spray and the misty spray becomes mother of vinegar. Midges are born from mother of vinegar; yellow whirligigs are born from fetid wine; blindgnats are born from putrid slimebugs. When goat's-queue couples with bamboo that has not shooted for a long time, they produce greenies. The greenies produce panthers; panthers produce horses; horses produce men; and men return to enter the wellsprings of nature [機]. The myriad things all come out from the wellsprings and all reenter the wellsprings. (18, tr. Mair 1994: 172-173) \n\nLiu An's (c. 139 BCE) \"Huainanzi\" uses \"bianhua\" 17 times. For instance, this hunchback story about Ziqiu 子求 \"Master Seek\", adapted from the \"Zhuangzi\" (6, tr. Mair 1994:58) description of Ziyu 子輿 \"Master Chariot\".\nZiqiu had lived for fifty-four years when an injury made him hunchbacked. The arch of his spine was higher than his forehead; his chin pressed down on his chest; his two buttocks were on top; his rectum pointed to the sky. He crawled over to peer at himself in a well: \"Amazing! That which fashions and transforms us! How has it turned me into this crumpled thing?\" This shows that from his viewpoint, alterations and transformation [\"bianhua\"] are the same. (7, tr. Major et al. 2010: 252) \nThe \"Huainanzi\" describes transformations in nature (tr. Major et al. 2010: 399): \"Now the frog becomes a quail, [and] the water scorpion becomes the dragonfly. These give rise to what is not their own kind. Only the sage understands their transformations.\" To know the \"bianhua\" of things is the hallmark of spiritual knowledge (Robinet 1993: 155).\n\nWhile the \"Daodejing\" text does not use \"bianhua\", its (c. 2nd century CE) commentary attributed to Heshang Gong 河上公 (lit. \"Riverbank Elder\") uses the word twice, explaining the transformations of dragons and spirits. The text and commentary for Section 26 (重德) says:\nSection 39 (法本) says:\n\nThe (c. 2nd century CE) \"Laozi bianhua jing\" 老子變化經 \"Scripture of the Transformations of Laozi\", which is preserved in a fragmentary (612 CE) Dunhuang manuscript discovered in the Mogao Caves, uses \"bianhua\" to describe the many historical reincarnations of Laozi 老子, deified as Laojun 老君 \"Lord Lao\". This text (tr. Robinet 1993: 157) says Laozi \"can make himself bright or dark, disappear and then be present, enlarge or diminish himself, coil up or extend himself, put himself above or below, can be vertical or horizontal, (and) can go forward or backward.\" In every generation, this Master of Emperors cosmically \"transforms his own body\" in order to teach humanity, through the incarnate power of the Dao, he assumes numerous identities, and leaves behind adapted writings with his teaching (Kohn 2008: 617). The transformations of Laojun began with the first mythical ruler Fu Xi, included Gautama Buddha, the Yellow Emperor's teacher Guangzhengzi 廣成子 \"Master Broadly Complete\" (mentioned in the \"Zhuangzi\"), and ended with a 155 CE manifestation in the Sichuan region.\n\nMark Csikszentmihalyi distinguishes between early Daoist discussions that tended to emphasize the way in which \"bianhua\" applies to human beings in the same way it does to the natural world (Sivin 1991), and later Daoism that stressed the potential for the adept to harness \"bianhua\", particularly in the eschatological picture of the Shangqing tradition. \nLike Laozi, the diverse spirits of the Shangqing tradition are able to transform themselves, and the adept had to be able to identify their different manifestations. Adepts, in turn, might use \"bianhua\" to transform themselves. The Shangqing text \"Shenzhou qizhuan qibian wutian jing\" 神州七轉七變舞天經 (Scripture of the Divine Continent on the Dance in Heaven in Seven Revolutions and Seven Transformations; CT 1331) describes methods for transforming into clouds, light, fire; water, and dragons. (2008: 229-230) \nIsabelle Robinet (2000: 219) notes that \"the powers of metamorphosis had always been a key characteristic of the immortals, but these powers came to be even more central in Shangqing where they were synonymous with deliverance and salvation.\"\n\n\"Bianhua\" was employed by both Daoist mystics and \"Fangshi\" magicians. The Daoist adept practices metamorphosis both internally through meditation on colored breaths and gods within the body, and externally using magic to change the appearances of things (Robinet 1979: 43-46). Ge Hong's (c. 320 CE) \"Baopuzi\" explains these extraordinary powers of Daoists. Describing the multilocation technique called \"fenxing\" \"divide/multiply the body\", Ge Hong says his uncle Ge Xuan could be in several dozen places at once (18, tr. Ware 1966: 306): \"When guests were present there could be one host speaking with the guests in the house, another host greeting guests beside the stream, and still another host making casts with his fishing line, but the guests were unable to distinguish which was the true one.\" \"Yinxing\" 隱形 \"invisibility\" is another manifestation of \"bianhua\". The \"Baopuzi\" (16, tr. Ware 1966: 262-263) says: \"What is it that the arts of transformation cannot do? May I remind my readers that the human body, which is normally visible, can be made to disappear. Ghosts and gods are normally invisible, but there are ways and means to make them visible. Those capable of operating these methods and prescriptions will be found to abound wherever you go.\"\n\nSeveral centuries after Chinese Buddhists borrowed the Daoist meaning of \"bianhua\" or \"hua\" \"manifest through transformation; incarnate\", early Tang dynasty Daoists elaborated the Buddhist doctrine about a Buddha's \"three bodies\" (see below) into a theory that the True Body of the Dao, the Supreme Truth, assumes different metaphoric \"bodies\" in order to manifest as specific deities, including those in the \"Laozi bianhuajing\". The (late 8th century) Daoist \"Sanlun yuanzhi\" 三論元旨 (tr. Robinet 1993: 157) explains that: \"The saint responds to all things, but his essence is distinct from them. Therefore, since his transcendent root is immobile, he is called the \"true body\" [\"zhenshen\" 真身] and since he propagates the form of the Law, he is called the \"responsive body\" [\"yingshen\" 應身]. This text further contrasts the True Body with the \"transformation body\" [\"huashen\" 化身 or \"bianhuashen\", used for \"nirmāṇa-kāya\"] and the \"trace body\" [\"jishen\" 跡身], in the sense that all teachings are traces of Truth (Robinet 1979: 42).\n\nEarly Buddhist translators chose Chinese \"bianhua\" 變化 as the equivalent for Sanskrit \"nirmāṇa\" \"transformation; supernatural manifestation; reincarnation\".\n\nCharles Muller's \"Digital Dictionary of Buddhism\" (2014) defines \"bianhua\" as basically meaning \"transformation of things\", and distinguishes four senses:\nMonier Monier-Williams's \"Sanskrit-English Dictionary\" (1899) translates \"nirmāṇa\" निर्माण as \"measuring, measure, reach, extent\", \"forming, making, creating\", \"(Buddhist literature) transformation\", \"essence, essential/best part of anything\" (\"sāra\"), and \"unconformity, impropriety, unbecomingness\" (\"asamañjasa\").\n\nThe common Buddhist term \"bianhuashen\" 變化身 or \"huashen\" 化身 (translating \"nirmāṇakāya\") \"transformation-body; manifested-body\" refers to one of the \"sanshen\" 三身 (\"trikāya\") \"three bodies [of a buddha]\" doctrine, along with the \"fashen\" 法身 (\"dharmakāya\") \"dharma-body; truth-body\", and \"baoshen\" 報身 (\"saṃbhogakāya\") \"reward-body; bliss-body\". Contexts describing Buddhas manifesting as animals and humans use the related terms \"bianhuaren\" 變化人 (\"nirmita\") \"magically manifested human body\", \"bianhuatu\" 變化土 (\"nirmāṇa-kṣetra\") \"transformation land where the inhabitants reincarnate\", and *\"bianhuasheng\" 變化生 (\"upapāduka\") \"birth by transformation; miraculous materialization\".\n\nBesides \"bianhua\" 變化, Buddhist translators used other Chinese \"bian\" compounds for Sanskrit words dealing with supernatural manifestations (Mair 1989: 68). This semantic complex includes \"bianxian\" 變現 (with \"appearance\") translating both \"vikurvaṇa\" \"manifestation through transformation\" and \"prātihārya\" \"miraculous\", and \"shenbian\" 神變 (with \"god; divine\") translating \"prātihārya\" \"supernatural/miraculous powers; magical feats\" and \"vikurvana\" \"manifestation; transformation\".\n\nVictor Mair (1989: 43-45) traced the historical semantics of Chinese \"bian\" before and after the (c. 2nd-3rd century) introduction of Buddhism, when it started being used as to translate Sanskrit \"nirmāṇa\" meaning \"discontinuity or break with reality (illusion)\". The pre-Buddhist concept of Chinese \"bian\" referred to \"change (from one state to another)\", through which one thing becomes another thing. The post-Buddhist concept extended \"bian\" to mean \"strange\" in the sense of \"transformation from nothing to something; magically creative power to conjure\". The early \"strange incident; supernatural transformation\" sense of \"bian\" became popular during the early Tang dynasty period, for instance, the (c. 668) \"Fayuan Zhulin\" \"Pearl Grove in the Garden of the Dharma\" used \"bianhua\" \"[miraculous] transformation\" to describe strange incidents.\n\nThe Neo-Confucian philosopher Zhu Xi's interpretations of the Chinese classics, which scholars and officials from the 12th to 19th centuries considered to be canonical, differentiated between two types of \"change\": sudden, transformational \"bian\" and gradual, evolutionary \"hua\".\n\nFor instance, Zhu explained an ambiguous \"Yijing\" statement within the Xici zhuan 繫辭傳 \"Commentary on the Appended Phrases\" (tr. Wilhelm and Baynes 1967: 323), \"That which transforms things and fits them together is called change [化而裁之謂之變]; that which stimulates them and sets them in motion is called continuity\", with a lunar analogy (tr. Kim 2000: 128): \"[The progression] from the first day to the thirtieth day [of a lunar month] is \"hua\" (transformation). Having reached this thirtieth day, concluded and made one month, the next day belongs to the next month. This is \"pien\" (change).\" This \"change\" distinction also applied to lines in the \"Yijing\" hexagrams, which are either unbroken, solid Yang lines or broken, open Yin ones: \"\"Pien\" is from a yin [line] to a yang [line]. [It] changes suddenly. Therefore, it is called \"change\" (\"pien\"). [The change] from yin to yang naturally grows to become sudden. This is called change. From yang to yin, it gradually goes on vanishing and wearing out.\"\n\nZhu Xi used the \"bian\"/\"hua\" distinction to explain a difficult passage in the \"Doctrine of the Mean\" (tr. Kim 2000: 129) – \"When moved, it is change; when changed, it is transformed [動則變，變則化]\" – \"When changed, its old conventions have already been altered, but there still are traces. When transformed, they have completely vanished and transformed, and there are no longer any traces.\"\n\n\"Bianhua\" continues to be a linguistically productive word, as evident in Chinese technical neoloigisms like \"bianhuali\" \"paradigm\", \"bianhuaqiu\" 變化球 \"breaking ball\", \"bianhuayu\" 變化語 \"inflective language\", and \"bianhuamangshi\" 變化盲視 \"change blindness\".\n\n\n\n"}

To do so, HD opens channels of communication and mediates between parties in conflict, as well as facilitates dialogue and provides support to the broader mediation and peacebuilding community. HD will facilitate dialogue in both confidential settings as well as public ones.\n\nIt is headquartered in Geneva, which is also the location of its Middle East and North Africa programme. HD has regional offices in Africa and Asia.\n\nThe initial intention of HD was to explore new concepts of humanitarian innovation by serving as a venue for dialogue on humanitarian issues - where discreet discussions could take place among those who could have a practical impact on humanitarian policy and practice.\nThe organisation evolved this approach to include negotiations in support of humanitarian objectives and aimed to create space for humanitarian activities in conflict environments. It quickly broadened, at the behest of conflicting parties in Aceh, to include the resolution of the conflict through mediation and conflict prevention.\n\nIn July 2015, in recognition of its important role in the mediation of armed conflicts, HD was granted a special status by the Federal Council of Switzerland. Through this status, HD was awarded certain privileges and immunities \nintended to enable its peacemaking efforts worldwide.\n\nThe Founding Executive Director of HD was Martin Griffiths. He led the organization for more than 10 years, from 1999 to July 2010, when he stepped down from his position. Griffiths was replaced for a brief period (July 2010 to March 2011) by Angelo Gnaedinger, former Director General of the ICRC and the then HD Regional Director for the Middle East. Following this transitional period, David Harland was appointed as HD's new Executive Director in April 2011.\n\nHD aims to bring parties together through mediation and dialogue on issues of common concern in conflict zones.\n\nMore specifically, this includes the following activities:\n\n\nHD has been involved in peacemaking activities in the Philippines, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, Kenya, Libya, the Central African Republic, Nigeria, Senegal, Liberia, Somalia, Mali, Indonesia (Aceh), Timor Leste, Burundi, Nepal, and Ukraine, as well as in a large number of confidential operational projects.\n\nIn Tunisia, HD supported an informal dialogue process between the country’s main political parties which culminated in July 2014 with the signing of a Charter of Honour on the fair, transparent and democratic conduct of elections.\n\nIn Libya, HD helped drafting the Humanitarian Appeal for Benghazi, a document signed by 76 “sons and daughters of Benghazi” including tribal leaders, parliamentarians, lawyers, judges and former military commanders who commit themselves and call upon others to improve the access for humanitarian workers, to respect international humanitarian law and establish a system of transitional justice for their hometown.\n\nIn the Philippines, HD is a member of the International Contact Group which has been supporting the Government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front in a peace process which aimed to end decades of conflict in the southern Philippines. This process culminated in signing of historic agreements, the Framework Agreement on the Bangsamoro in 2012 and the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro in 2014.\n\nIn Kenya, HD supported a peace process between local communities in the Rift Valley of Kenya. This area had been the epicentre of post-election violence in 2007-2008. The process culminated in the signing of a peace agreement, the Nakuru County Peace Accord in August 2012.\n\nIn northern Mali, HD facilitated and moderated the meeting which led to the signing of the Ouagadagou Declaration by the six political and military movements of Azawad on August 28, 2014. The purpose of the declaration was to put an end to hostilities in northern Mali and to establish a political and legal status for Azawad.\n\nIn Nigeria, HD supported an inter-communal dialogue process with five local government areas (LGAs) from southern Kaduna State, which culminated in the Kafanchan Peace Declaration in March 2016. It is a commitment to non-violent conflict resolution by communities from five local government areas (LGAs) in southern Kaduna State.\n\nHD seeks to improve the practice of mediation and strengthen capacity within the community of mediators.\n\nSupport activities include:\nHD collaborates with the United Nations, regional organisations such as ECOWAS, governments, and civil society.\nHD has launched a series of publications including the Mediation Practice Series, which seeks to provide mediation practitioners with insight into how challenges have been addressed by others in order to help them prepare for the demands of mediation. The Oslo Forum Papers aim to advance thinking and debate on issues linked to armed conflict mediation and international peacemaking.\n\nHD seeks to promote the sharing of experiences within the community of mediators and peacemakers at The Oslo Forum. Launched in 2003, the Oslo Forum is an initiative led by the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and HD to improve practice in conflict mediation, and to enhance mediation as a profession. The Oslo Forum features an annual global event in Oslo, as well as regional forums in Africa and Asia.\n\nThe organisation was founded to pursue Henry Dunant’s vision of a world more humane. The aim, through mediation and dialogue, is to reduce the suffering caused by armed conflict in the world – where possible, to prevent such conflict; otherwise to help resolve it; or to mitigate its consequences.\n\nHD embraces a set of values that foster integrity, professionalism and respect for diversity in all areas of its work. It subscribes to the core humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and operational independence and are committed to respecting international principles in relation to human rights and humanitarian affairs.\n\nHD receives a combination of project earmarked contributions and unearmarked grants from approximately 25 different governments and multilateral institutions as well as a small number of foundations and private philanthropists. In 2015, HD's annual income was 27 million Swiss Francs.\n\n"}

A particular form of epistemological pluralism is dualism, for example, the separation of methods for investigating mind from those appropriate to matter (see mind–body problem). By contrast, monism is the restriction to a single approach, for example, reductionism, which asserts the study of all phenomena can be seen as finding relations to some few basic entities.\n\nEpistemological pluralism is to be distinguished from ontological pluralism, the study of different modes of being, for example, the contrast in the mode of existence exhibited by \"numbers\" with that of \"people\" or \"cars\".\n\nIn the philosophy of science epistemological pluralism arose in opposition to reductionism to express the contrary view that at least some natural phenomena cannot be fully explained by a single theory or fully investigated using a single approach.\n\nIn mathematics, the variety of possible epistemological approaches includes platonism (\"mathematics as an objective study of abstract reality, no more created by human thought than the galaxies\") radical constructivism (with restriction upon logic, banning the proof by \"reductio ad absurdum\" and other limitations), and many other schools of thought.\n\nIn economics controversy exists between a single epistemological approach to economics and a variety of approaches. \"At midcentury, the neoclassical approach achieved near-hegemonic status (at least in the United States), and its proponents sought to bring all kinds of social phenomena under its uniform explanatory umbrella.

He is best remembered for a large number of anecdotes, jokes and sayings coined by him and about him. \n\nFranciszek Józef Marian Fiszer was born in 1860 in the Ławy manor near Ostrołęka, to Teresa née Glinczanka and Józef Fiszer. His father was from among the German nobility, polonised in the 18th century and a distant relative of General Stanisław Fiszer, while his mother was a member of the Polish gentry and owner of the said manor and village. Very little is known of Fiszer's childhood apart from the fact that he was a late child (both of his parents being over 40 at his birth) and that he became an orphan relatively soon. \n\nIn the 1880s Fiszer moved to Warsaw, where he started spending most of his time in Warsaw's cafes, restaurants and some of the most notable clubs of the era. With time, he became a characteristic part of the Warsaw's social panorama and became friends with most of the contemporary Polish writers, poets, artists and politicians. Renowned for his existential monologues and anecdotes, Fiszer's only pastime was the restaurants. In the interbellum, Fiszer became one of the most notable members of Warsaw's high society. Frequent guest at balls and parties, he became a living legend. His family village became neglected and soon had to be parcellated for debts. However, Fiszer's lifestyle did not suffer, as he barely ever had to pay for his meals, since he was seen by the gastronomers as an advertisement for their restaurants. That is why he often was a guest of \"Udziałowa\", \"Ziemiańska\", \"IPS\", Oaza, Astoria or \"Blikle\". \n\nAmong the closest friends of Franc Fiszer were Bolesław Leśmian (Fiszer is said to have invented his pen-name), Stefan Żeromski, Władysław Reymont, the \"Skamandrites\" Antoni Słonimski and Julian Tuwim, Jan Lechoń, Miriam, Artur Rubinstein and Antoni Lange. Although Fiszer never published any book himself, he is mentioned in nearly all memoirs by Warsaw's artists of the inter-war period. Also, he became the only person never to publish a book to be mentioned in both Stanisław Tatarkiewicz's \"Polish Biographical Dictionary\" and Leszek Kołakowski's \"Philosophy in Poland; Dictionary of Writers\". \n\nIn 1985, most of the memoirs mentioning Franciszek Fiszer were collected by Roman Loth in a book titled \"Na rogu świata i nieskończoności\" (\"At the Crossing of World and Infinity\").\n\n"}

He was the founder of the short-lived Utopian community Brook Farm in West Roxbury, Massachusetts.\n\nBorn in Greenfield, Massachusetts, George Ripley was pushed to attend Harvard College by his father and completed his studies in 1823. He went on graduate from the Harvard Divinity School and the next year married Sophia Dana. Shortly after, he became ordained as the minister of the Purchase Street Church in Boston, Massachusetts, where he began to question traditional Unitarian beliefs. He became one of the founding members of the Transcendental Club and hosted its first official meeting in his home. Shortly after, he resigned from the church to put Transcendental beliefs in practice by founding an experimental commune called Brook Farm. The community later converted to a model based on the work of Charles Fourier, although the community was never financially stable in either format.\n\nAfter Brook Farm's failure, Ripley was hired by Horace Greeley at the \"New York Tribune\". He also published the \"New American Cyclopaedia\", which made him financially successful. He built a national reputation as an arbiter of taste and literature before his death in 1880.\n\nRipley's ancestors had lived in Hingham, Massachusetts for 140 years before Jerome Ripley moved his family to Greenfield, a town in the western part of the state, in 1789. He was moderately successful as the owner of a general store and tavern and was a prominent member of the community. His son George Ripley was born in Greenfield on October 3, 1802, the ninth child in the family.\n\nGeorge Ripley's early life was heavily influenced by women. His nearest brother was thirteen years older than he was and he was raised primarily by his conservative mother, who was distantly related to Benjamin Franklin, and his sisters. He was sent to a private academy run by a Mr. Huntington in Hadley, Massachusetts to prepare for college. Before going to college, he spent three months in Lincoln with Ezra Ripley, a distant relative who was also the stepfather of Ralph Waldo Emerson. Although Ripley wanted to attend the religiously conservative Yale University, his Unitarian father pushed him to attend Harvard College, then known as a hotbed of liberal Unitarianism. Ripley was a good and dedicated student, although he was not popular with students because of his trust of the establishment. Early in his time at Harvard, he had sided with the administration during a student-led protest against poor food, and his attempts at reconciling the two sides prompted ridicule from his peers. Ripley, seeking a socially useful role, found work as a teacher in Fitchburg during winter vacation of his senior year. He graduated in 1823.\n\nDuring his time at the school, Ripley became disenchanted with his father and his home town, admitting \"no particular attachment to Greenfield\". He hoped to enroll at Andover but his father convinced him to stay in Cambridge to attend Harvard Divinity School. There, he was influenced by Levi Frisbie, Professor of Natural Religion, who was largely interested in moral philosophy, which he termed \"the science of the principles and obligations of duty\". Ripley was becoming very interested in more \"liberal\" religious views, what he wrote to his mother as \"so simple, scriptural, and reasonable\". He graduated in 1826. A year later, on August 22, 1827, he married Sophia Dana, a fact which he originally kept a secret from his parents. He asked his sister Marianne to inform them shortly after.\n\nRipley officially became a minister at Boston's Purchase Street Church on November 8, 1826, and became influential in the developing the Unitarian religion. These ten years of his tenure there were quiet and uneventful, until March 1836, when Ripley published a long article titled \"Schleiermacher as a Theologian\" in the \"Christian Examiner\". In it, Ripley praised Schleiermacher's attempt to create a \"religion of the heart\" based on intuition and personal communion with God. Later that year, he published a review of British theologian James Martineau's \"The Rationale of Religious Enquiry\" in the same publication. In the review, Ripley charged Unitarian church elders with religious intolerance because they forced the literal acceptance of miracles as a requirement for membership in their church. Andrews Norton, a leading theologian of the day, responded publicly and insisted that disbelief in miracles ultimately denied the truth of Christianity. Norton, formerly Ripley's teacher at the Divinity School, had been labeled by many as the \"hard-headed Unitarian Pope\", and began his public battle with Ripley in the \"Boston Daily Advertiser\" on November 5, 1836, in an open letter charging Ripley with academic and professional incompetence. Ripley contended that to insist upon the reality of miracles was to demand material proof of spiritual matters, and that faith needed no such external confirmation; but Norton and the mainstream of Unitarianism found this tantamount to heresy. This dispute laid the groundwork for the separation of a more extreme Transcendentalism from its liberal Unitarian roots. The debate between Norton and Ripley, which earned allies on both sides, continued until 1840.\n\nRipley met with Ralph Waldo Emerson, Frederic Henry Hedge, and George Putnam in Cambridge, Massachusetts on September 8, 1836, to discuss the formation of a new club. Ten days later, on September 18, 1836, Ripley hosted their first official meeting at his house. The group at this first meeting of what would become known as the \"Transcendental Club\" included Amos Bronson Alcott, Orestes Brownson, James Freeman Clarke, and Convers Francis as well as Hedge, Emerson, and Ripley. Future members would include Henry David Thoreau, William Henry Channing, Christopher Pearse Cranch, Sylvester Judd, and Jones Very. Female members included Sophia Ripley, Margaret Fuller, and Elizabeth Peabody. The group planned its meetings for times when Hedge was visiting from Bangor, Maine, leading to the early nickname \"Hedge's Club\". The name Transcendental Club was given to the group by the public and not by its participants. Hedge wrote: \"There was no club in the strict sense... only occasional meetings of like-minded men and women\", earning the nickname \"the brotherhood of the 'Like-Minded'\". Beginning in 1839, Ripley edited \"Specimens of Foreign Standard Literature\": fourteen volumes of translations meant to demonstrate the breadth of Transcendental thoughts.\n\nAmid the Panic of 1837, many began to criticize social institutions. That year, Ripley gave a sermon titled \"The Temptations of the Times\", suggesting that the major problem in the country was \"the inordinate pursuit, the extravagant worship of wealth\". Ripley had been asked by church proprietors to avoid controversial topics in his sermons. He said, \"Unless a minister is expected to speak out on all subjects which are uppermost in his mind, with no fear of incurring the charge of heresy or compromising the interests of his congregation, he can never do justice to himself, to his people, or the truth which he is bound to declare\". In May 1840, he offered his resignation from the Purchase Street Church but was convinced to stay. He soon decided he should leave the ministry altogether and, on October 3, 1840, he read a 7,300-word lecture, \"Letter Addressed to the Congregational Church in Purchase Street\", expressing his dissatisfaction with Unitarianism.\n\nBecause of his experience with the \"Specimens\" translations, Ripley was chosen to be the managing editor of the Transcendental publication \"The Dial\" at its inception, working alongside its first editor Margaret Fuller. In addition to overseeing distribution, subscriptions, printing, and finances, Ripley also contributed essays and reviews. In October 1841, he resigned his post with \"The Dial\" as he prepared for an experiment in communal living. As he told Emerson, although he was happy seeing all the Transcendental thoughts in print, he could not be truly happy \"without the attempt to realize them\".\n\nIn the late 1830s Ripley became increasingly engaged in \"Associationism\", an early Fourierist socialist movement. In October 1840 he announced to the Transcendental Club his plan to form an Associationist community based on Fourier's Utopian plans. His goals were lofty. As he wrote, \"If wisely executed, it will be a light over this country and this age. If not the sunrise, it will be the morning star.\"\n\nRipley and his wife formed a joint stock company in 1841 along with 10 other initial investors. Shares of the company were sold for $500 apiece with a promise of five percent of the profits to each investor. The founding membership of the original community included Nathaniel Hawthorne. They chose the Ellis Farm in West Roxbury, Massachusetts as the site of their experiment, which they named Brook Farm. Its were about from Boston; a pamphlet described the land as a \"place of great natural beauty, combining a convenient nearness to the city with a degree of retirement and freedom from unfavorable influences unusual even in the country\". The land, however, turned out to be difficult to farm and the community struggled with financial difficulties as it built greenhouses and craft shops.\n\nBrook Farm was initially based mostly on the ideals of Transcendentalism; its founders believed that by pooling labor they could sustain the community and still have time for literary and scientific pursuits. The experiment meant to serve as an example for the rest of the world, established on the principles of \"industry without drudgery, and true equality without its vulgarity\". Many in the community wrote of how much they enjoyed their experience. One participant, a man named John Codman, joined the community at the age of 27 in 1843. He wrote, \"It was for the meanest a life above humdrum, and for the greatest something far, infinitely far beyond. They looked into the gates of life and saw beyond charming visions, and hopes springing up for all\". In their free time, the members of Brook Farm enjoyed music, dancing, card games, drama, costume parties, sledding, and skating. Hawthorne, eventually elected treasurer of the community, did not enjoy his experience. He wrote to his wife-to-be Sophia Peabody, \"labor is the curse of the world, and nobody can meddle with it without becoming proportionately brutified\".\n\nMany outside the community were also critical, especially in the press. The New York \"Observer\", for example, suggested that, \"The Associationists, under the pretense of a desire to promote order and morals, design to overthrow the marriage institution, and in the place of the divine law, to substitute the 'passions' as the proper regulator of the intercourse of the sexes\", concluding that they were \"secretly and industriously aiming to destroy the foundation of society\".\n\nIn 1844, the community, perpetually struggling financially, drafted an entirely new constitution and committed to following more closely the Fourierist model. Not everyone at the community supported the transition, and many left. Many were disappointed that the new, more structured daily routine de-emphasized the carefree leisure time that had been a trademark. Ripley himself became a celebrity proponent of Fourierism and organized conventions throughout New England to discuss the community.\n\nBy May 1846, troubled by the financial difficulties at Brook Farm, Ripley had made an informal split from the community. By its closure a year later, Brook Farm had amassed a total debt of $17,445. Ripley was devastated at the failure of his experiment and told a friend, \"I can now understand how a man would feel if he could attend his own funeral\". His personal life was also taxed. His wife had converted to Catholicism in 1846, encouraged by Orestes Brownson, and had become doubtful of his Associationist politics; the Ripleys' relationship became strained by the 1850s.\n\nAfter Brook Farm, George Ripley began to work as a freelance journalist. In 1849 he was employed by Horace Greeley at the \"New York Tribune\", taking the role left vacant by Margaret Fuller. Greeley had been a proponent of Brook Farm's conversion to Fourierism. Ripley started his role with the \"Tribune\" at $12 a week and, at this wage, was not able to pay off the debt of Brook Farm until 1862. As a critic, he believed in high moral standards for literature but offered good-natured praise in the majority of his reviews. Greeley took advantage of Ripley's cheerful style of writing to boost circulation amid significant competition. Ripley wrote a \"Gotham Gossip\" column and many articles discussing local personalities and notable public events, including speeches by Henry Clay and Frederick Douglass. He stayed away from philosophy of theology, despite some efforts to persuade him to write on the subject. As he told a friend, he had \"long since lost... immediate interest in that line of speculation\".\n\nRipley then edited \"Harper's Magazine\". Together with Bayard Taylor he compiled a \"Handbook of Literature and the Fine Arts\" (1852).\n\nWith Charles A. Dana, he edited the 16 volume \"The New American Cyclopaedia\" (1857–1863), reissued as \"The American Cyclopaedia\" (1873–1876). It sold in the millions and its immediate earnings amounted to over $100,000.\n\nHe also continued his critical work and in 1860 reviewed \"On the Origin of Species\" by Charles Darwin. He was one of the few contemporary critics to be sympathetic to Darwin, although he was reluctant to show he was convinced of the theories.\n\nIn 1861 Sophia Ripley died. George Ripley remarried, to Louisa Sclossberger, in 1865, and was a part of the Gilded Age New York literary scene for the remainder of his life. Because of his convivial nature, he was careful to avoid the city's rampant literary feuds at the time. He became a public figure with a national reputation and, known as an arbiter of taste, he helped establish the National Institute of Literature, Art, and Science in 1869. In his later years, he began suffering frequent illnesses, including a bout with influenza in 1875 which prevented him from traveling to Germany. He also suffered from gout and rheumatism.\n\nRipley was found dead at his desk on July 4, 1880, slumped over his work. Pallbearers at his funeral included Frederick Augustus Porter Barnard, George William Curtis, and Whitelaw Reid. At the time of his death, Ripley had become financially successful; the \"New American Cyclopaedia\" had earned him royalties of nearly $1.5 million. A biography entitled \"George Ripley\" (Boston: Houghton, Mifflin & Co., 1882) was written by Octavius Brooks Frothingham.\n\nRipley built a wide reputation as a critic. Contemporary publications rated him as one of the most important critics of the day, including the \"Hartford Courant\", the \"Springfield Republican\", the New York \"Evening Gazette\", and the Chicago \"Daily Tribune\". Henry Theodore Tuckerman commended Ripley as \"a scholar and an aesthetic as well as technical critic: [he] knows public taste and the laws of literature\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1547318", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1547318", "title": "Hans Albert", "text": "Hans Albert\n\nHans Albert (born 8 February 1921) is a German philosopher. Born in Cologne, he lives in Heidelberg.\n\nHis fields of research are Social Sciences and General Studies of Methods. He is a critical rationalist, paying special attention to rational heuristics. He is a strong critic of the continental hermeneutic tradition coming from Heidegger and Gadamer.\n\nAlbert held the chair of Social Sciences and General Studies of Methods at the University of Mannheim. He is also a much-cited philosopher. Most importantly, he developed Popper's critical rationalism into a concise, broad-ranging maxim, thereby extending it from a method to progress in science to one equally applicable in day-to-day heuristics.\n\nTo substantiate his approach, he provided evidence for his thesis that there is no field of human activities where one should not be critical. Consequently, he advocated applying critical rationalism to the social sciences, especially to economics, politics, jurisprudence, and religion.\n\nIn his view the attitude of criticism is one of the oldest European traditions (going back to the pre-Socratics) in comparison with other less critical traditions.\n\nBefore his many books were published, Hans Albert was already known to a broader audience for his contributions to the positivism dispute arguing against his opponents of the so-called Frankfurt School (school of Theodor W. Adorno and Max Horkheimer at Frankfurt's Institute of Sociology). His contributions included\n\nAlbert observed that new insights are often difficult to spread or proliferate. He ascribed this phenomenon's cause to ideological obstacles, for which Albert coined the phrase 'immunity against criticism'.\n\nAlbert's well known Münchhausen trilemma is ironically named after Baron Munchausen, who allegedly pulled himself out of a swamp seizing himself by his shock of hair. This trilemma rounds off the classical problem of justification in the theory of knowledge. It concludes that all attempts to rationally justify or rather ultimately verify a thesis must inherently fail. This verdict concerns not only deductive justifications, as many of his critics believe, but also inductive, causal, transcendental, and all otherwise structured justifications. As Albert reasons, they all will be in vain, since a justification inevitably faces one of three flaws:\n\nAlbert stressed repeatedly that there is no limitation of the Münchhausen trilemma to deductive conclusions. Hence, Albert points out, justification is rendered virtually impossible regardless of the specific content of a thesis, justification is impossible at all. From this notion, Albert draws the conclusion that progress in science can only be achieved by means of falsification rather than inductive verification.\n\nTo observe and criticize the endeavors made to escape from the quagmire of certain justification became an instructive part of Hans Albert's philosophy. A prominent example of these efforts his discussion of the ideas of Karl-Otto Apel, one of Germany's leading philosophers (see Albert's \"Transzendentale Träumereien...\" meaning \"Transcendental Reveries. Karl-Otto Apels Language Games and His Hermeneutical God\", which is not yet translated).\n\nStill, Albert argues that critical rationalists have to accept that those attempts of rigorous justification (like Apel's) are not entirely futile, since only as long as alternative methods are without success can critical rationalism be called successful.\n\nAlbert's plea is for critical rationalism. He avoids solemn preaching in favor of serious, serene discussion with people of different faith and thinking. While Popper always warned not to follow one's opponent into the mire, Albert follows them into their favored field of thinking on their own terms. So he criticized Heidegger's \"being in the abyss\" (\"Sein im Ab-Grund\"), Gadamer's \"horizons melting together\", Habermas's \"consensual theoretical truth in the ideal discourse\", Karl-Otto Apel's transcendental arguments, the theologian Hans Küng's \"absolute-relative, this-life-and-hereafter, transcendental-immanent, allconcerning-allcontrolling most real reality in the very heart of things\". Hans Albert meticulously follows their arguments to uncover:\n\nUnderlying suppositions and injunctions of Albert's method are: \n\nIn 1950 Hans Albert earned his first degree as a 'Diplom-Kaufmann', followed by an Academic degree of a Dr. rer.pol. 1952. In the years 1952–1958 he worked as an assistant at the 'Forschungsinstitut für Sozial- und Verwaltungswissenschaften' of the University of Cologne. In 1957 he got the degree of a 'Dr. habil. for Social Politics' at the University of Cologne. As a lecturer he read logic, theory of science and economics of the welfare state. Since 1958 he has been participating the Alpbacher Hochschulwochen (a summer conference in the Austrian alpine village of Alpbach). It was there he made the acquaintance of Karl Popper after having studied Popper's philosophy and having mostly accepted it long ago. After 1955 he had exciting discussions with Paul Feyerabend, who in those times was a critical rationalist and an admirer of Karl Popper. Their letters later were published. In 1963 Albert finally got the chair of 'Social Sciences and General Studies of Methods' (later dubbed 'Sociology and Studies of Economics') at the Wirtschaftshochschule Mannheim (later University of Mannheim).\n\n1961–1969 was the time of the so-called 'Positivismusstreit' (positivism dispute), i.e. the debate between Karl Popper and Theodor W. Adorno concerning positivism within German sociology during the 1960s. Albert participated at this meanwhile famous \"Conference of the German Society of Sociology\" ('Tagung der deutschen Gesellschaft für Soziologie') 1961 in Tübingen. In the beginning there was no dispute on positivism, because Adorno as well as Popper were opposed to positivism. The debate was more about the differences between social sciences and natural sciences and the status of values in the social sciences. 1963 The debate was continued by Jürgen Habermas in the \"Festschrift für Adorno\". 1964 On the \"Soziologentag\" (conference on sociology) in Heidelberg the debate grew up into an excited discussion between Habermas and Albert. The famous dispute culminated in a collection of essays published in 1969, translated into several languages, also into English (1976, see booklist below). This dispute gained a broad audience.\n\nIn 1989 Hans Albert was discharged from active service as Professor Emeritus but continued writing books and giving lectures at many universities, such as the 1990 lectures at the University of Graz on Critical Rationalism, the 1995 'Walter Adolf Lectures' at the Hochschule St. Gallen, and the 1998 Wittgenstein-Lectures at the University of Bayreuth (with Prof. Rainer Hegselmann) about Critical Rationalism.\n\nHe was honored with the 'Vits prize' 1976 and with the 'Arthur Burckhard prize' 1984. He was decorated with the Austrian 'Ehrenkreuz für Kunst und Wissenschaft der Republik Österreich' (1994) and got honorary doctorates of the universities of Linz/Austria (1995), Athens/Greece (1997), Kassel/Germany (2000), Graz/Austria (2006), and Klagenfurt/Austria (2007).\n\n\nHans Albert, 'Autobiographische Einleitung', in: \"Kritische Vernunft und menschliche Praxis\", Stuttgart (Reclam) 1977, pages 5–33.

{"id": "2158190", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2158190", "title": "Harold Arthur Prichard", "text": "Harold Arthur Prichard\n\nHarold Arthur Prichard (1871–1947), usually cited as H. A. Prichard, was an English philosopher. He was born in London in 1871, the eldest child of Walter Stennett Prichard (a solicitor) and his wife Lucy. Harold Prichard was a scholar of Clifton College from where he won a scholarship to New College, Oxford, to study mathematics. But after taking First Class honours in mathematical moderations (preliminary examinations) in 1891, he studied Greats (ancient history and philosophy) taking First Class Honours in 1894. He also played tennis for Oxford against Cambridge. On leaving Oxford he spent a brief period working for a firm of solicitors in London, before returning to Oxford where he spent the rest of his life, first as Fellow of Hertford College (1895–98) and then of Trinity College (1898–1924). He took early retirement from Trinity in 1924 on grounds of ill health, but recovered and was elected White's Professor of Moral Philosophy in 1928 and became a fellow of Corpus Christi College. He retired in 1937.\n\nPrichard gave an influential defence of ethical intuitionism in his \"Does Moral Philosophy Rest on a Mistake?\" (1912), wherein he contended that moral philosophy rested chiefly on the desire to provide arguments, starting from non-normative premises, for the principles of obligation that we pre-philosophically accept, such as the principle that one ought to keep one's promises or that one ought not steal. This is a mistake, he argued, both because it is impossible to derive any statement about what one ought to do from statements not concerning obligation (even statements about what is good), and because there is no need to do so since common sense principles of moral obligation are self-evident. The essay laid a groundwork for ethical intuitionism and provided inspiration for some of the most influential moral philosophers, such as John Rawls.\n\nPrichard attacks Utilitarianism as not being capable of forming obligation. He states that one cannot justify an obligation by pointing to the consequences of the obligated action because pointing to the consequences only shows that the action is desirable or advisable, not that it is obligatory. In other words, he claims that, while Utilitarianism may encourage people to do actions which a moral person would do, it cannot create a moral obligation to do those actions.\n\nH. A. Prichard is an ethical intuitionist, meaning he believed that it is through our moral intuitions that we come to know right and wrong. Further, while he believes that moral obligations are justified by reasons, he does not believe that the reasons are external to the obligation itself. For instance, if a person is asked why he ought not torture chipmunks, the only satisfying answer that could be given is that he ought not torture chipmunks.\n\nPrichard, along with other intuitionists, adopts a foundationalist approach to morality. Foundationalism is a theory of epistemology which states that there are certain fundamental principles which are the basis for all other knowledge. In the case of ethics, foundationalists hold that certain fundamental moral rules are their own justification. Walter Sinnott-Armstrong explains:\n\nThe deepest challenge in moral epistemology, as in general epistemology, is raised by a skeptical regress argument: Someone is justified in believing something only if the believer has a reason that is expressible in an inference with premises that the believer is already justified in believing. This requires a chain of inferences that must continue infinitely, close into a circle, or stop arbitrarily. Academic skeptics reject all three options and conclude that there is no way for anyone to be justified in believing anything. The same regress arises for moral beliefs . . . The simplest way to stop this regress is simply to stop. If a believer can work back to a premise that the believer is justified in believing without being able to infer that premise from anything else, then there is no new premise to justify, so the regress goes no further. That is how foundationalists stop the regress in general epistemology. Moral intuitionists apply foundationalism to moral beliefs as a way to stop the skeptical regress regarding moral beliefs.\n\nTherefore, Prichard concludes that just as observation of other people necessitates that other people exist, the observation of a moral obligation necessitates that the obligation exists. Prichard finishes his essay by answering a few obvious problems. Most notably, he explains how people should guarantee the accuracy of their moral intuitions. Clearly, observations can be misleading. For instance, if someone sees a pencil in water, he may conclude that the object in the water is bent. However, when he pulls the pencil from the water, he sees that it is straight. The same can occur with moral intuition. If one begins to doubt one's intuition, one should try to imagine oneself in the moral dilemma related to the decision. If the intuition persists, then the intuition is accurate. Prichard further supports these claims by pointing out how it is illegitimate to doubt previously believed moral intuitions:\n\nWith these considerations in mind, consider the parallel which, as it seems to me, is presented though with certain differences by Moral Philosophy. The sense that we ought to do certain things arises in our unreflective consciousness, being an activity of moral thinking occasioned by the various situations in which we find ourselves. At this stage our attitude to these obligations is one of unquestioning confidence. But inevitably the appreciation of the degree to which the execution of these obligations is contrary to our interest raises the doubt whether after all these obligations are, really obligatory, i.e., whether our sense that we ought not to do certain things is not illusion. We then want to have it proved to us that we ought to do so, i.e., to be convinced of this by a process which, as an argument, is different in kind from our original and unreflective appreciation of it. This demand IS, as I have argued, illegitimate. Hence in the first place, if, as is almost universally the case, by Moral Philosophy is meant the knowledge which would satisfy this demand, there is no such knowledge, and all attempts to attain it are doomed to failure because they rest on a mistake, the mistake of supposing the possibility of proving what can only be apprehended directly by an act of moral thinking.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "49587966", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49587966", "title": "Humanist photography", "text": "Humanist photography\n\nHumanist Photography, also known as the School of Humanist Photography, manifests the Enlightenment philosophical system in social documentary practice based on a perception of social change. It emerged in the mid-twentieth-century and is associated most strongly with Europe, particularly France, where the upheavals of the two world wars originated, though it was a worldwide movement. It can be distinguished from photojournalism, with which it forms a sub-class of reportage, as it is concerned more broadly with everyday human experience, to witness mannerisms and customs, than with newsworthy events, though practitioners are conscious of conveying particular conditions and social trends, often, but not exclusively, concentrating on the underclasses or those disadvantaged by conflict, economic hardship or prejudice. Humanist photography \"affirms the idea of a universal underlying human nature\". Jean Claude Gautrand describes humanist photography as\na 'lyrical trend, warm, fervent, and responsive to the sufferings of humanity [which] began to assert itself during the 1950s in Europe, particularly in France ... photographers dreamed of a world of mutual succour and compassion, encapsulated ideally in a solicitous vision.\n\nPhotographing on the street or in the bistro primarily in black‐and‐white in available light with the popular small cameras of the day, these image-makers discovered what the writer Pierre Mac Orlan (1882-1970) called the 'fantastique social de la rue' (social fantasticality of the street) and their style of image making rendered romantic and poetic the way of life of ordinary European people, particularly in Paris.\n\nThe preoccupation with everyday life emerged after World War II. As a reaction to the atrocities of the trenches, Paris became a haven for intellectual, cultural and artistic life, attracting artists from the whole Europe and the United States. With the release of the first Leica and Contax range-finder cameras, photographers took to the street and documented life by day and night. Such photographers as André Kertész, Brassaï, Henri Cartier-Bresson emerged during the period between the two world wars thanks to the Illustrated Press (\"Vu\" and \"Regards\"). Having been brought to notice by the Surrealists and Berenice Abbott, the life work of Eugène Atget in the empty streets of Paris also became a reference.\n\nAt the end of World War II, in 1946, French intellectuals Jean-Paul Sartre and André Malraux embraced humanism; Sartre arguing that existentialism was a humanism entailing freedom of choice and a responsibility for defining oneself, while at the Sorbonne in an address sponsored by UNESCO, Malraux depicted human culture as 'humanisme tragique', a battle against biological decay and historical disaster. Emerging from brutal global conflict, survivors desired material and cultural reconstruction and the appeal of humanism was a return to the values of dignity, equality and tolerance symbolised in an international proclamation and adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the General Assembly of the United Nations in Paris on 10 December 1948. That the photographic image could become a universal language in accord with these principles was a notion circulated at a UNESCO conference in 1958 \n\nAs France in particular, but also Belgium and the Netherlands, emerged from the dark period of the Occupation (1940–4), the liberation of Paris in August 1944 released photographers to respond to reconstruction and the Fourth Republic’s (1947–59) drive to redefine a French identity after war, defeat, occupation, and collaboration, and to modernise the country. For photographers the experience had been one in which the Nazi authorities censored all visual expression and the Vichy carefully controlled those who remained; and who eked out a living with portraiture and commercial, officially endorsed editorial photography, though individuals joined the Resistance from 1941, including Robert Capa, Cartier-Bresson, and Jean Dieuzaide, with several forging passes and documents (amongst whom were Robert Doisneau, Hans Bellmer, and Adolfo Kaminsky).\n\nParis was a crossroad of modernist culture and so cosmopolitan influences abound in humanist photography, recruiting emigrés who impressed their stamp on French photography, the earliest being Hungarian Andre Kertesz who arrived on the scene in the mid-1920s; followed by his compatriots Ergy Landau, Brassai (Gyula Halasz), and Robert Capa (Endre Friedmann), and by the Pole \"Chim\" Seymour (Dawid Szymin), among others, in the 1930s. The late 1940s and 50s saw a further influx of foreign photographers sympathetic to this movement, including Ed van der Elsken from the Netherlands who recorded the interactions at the bistrot Chez Moineau, the dirt-cheap refuge of bohemian youths and of Guy Debord, Michele Bernstein, Gil J. Wolman, Ivan Chtcheglov and the other members of the Letterist International and the emerging Situationists whose theory of the \"dérive\" accords with the working method of the humanist street photographer.\n\nThis humanist artistic current continued into the late 1960s and early 70s, after which attention turned to photography as a fine art.\n\nHumanist photography emerged and spread after the rise of the mass circulation picture magazines in the 1920s and as photographers formed fraternities such as Le Groupe des XV (which exhibited annually 1946-1957), or joined agencies which promoted their work and fed the demand of the newspaper and magazine audiences, publishers and editors before the advent of television broadcasting which rapidly displaced these audiences at the close of the 1960s. These publications include the \"Berliner Illustrirte Zeitung\", \"Vu\", \"Point de Vue\", \"Regards\", \"Paris Match\", \"Picture Post\", \"Life\", \"Look\", \"Plaisir de France\" and \"Réalités\" which competed to give ever larger space to photo-stories; extended articles and editorials that were profusely illustrated, or that consisted solely of photographs with captions, often by a single photographer, who would be credited alongside the journalist, or who provided written copy as well as images.\n\nIconic books appeared including Doisneau's \"Banlieue de Paris\" (1949), Izis's \"Paris des rêves\" (1950), Willy Ronis' \"Belleville‐Ménilmontant\" (1954) (see left), and Cartier‐Bresson's \"Images à la sauvette\" (1952); better known by its English title, which defines the photographic orientation of all these photographers, \"The Decisive Moment\").\n\nNational and international exposure of humanist photography was accelerated through exhibitions and of particular importance in this regard is The Family of Man, a vast travelling exhibition curated by Edward Steichen for MoMA, which presented a unifying humanist manifesto in the form of images selected from amongst, literally, a million. Thirty-one French photographs appeared in \"The Family of Man\", a contribution representing almost one-third of the European photography in the show.\n\nSteichen said that based on his experience of meeting photographers in Europe as he sought images of ‘everydayness' which he defined as 'the beauty of the things that fill our lives', for the exhibition, that the French were the only photographers who had thoroughly photographed scenes of daily life. These were practitioners he admired for their conveying 'tender simplicity, a sly humor, a warm enthusiasm ... and convincing aliveness'. In turn, this exposure in \"The Family of Man\" inspired a new generation of humanist photographers.\n\n\nThe movement is in marked contrast to the contemporaneous ‘art’ photography of the USA. However, there too ran a current of humanism in photography first begun in the early 20th century by Jacob Riis, then Lewis Hine, followed by the FSA and the New York Photo League [see the \"Harlem Project\" led by Aaron Siskind] photographers. Books were published such as those by Dorothea Lange and Paul Taylor (\"An American Exodus\", 1939), Walker Evans and James Agee (\"Let Us Now Praise Famous Men\", 1941), Margaret Bourke-White and Erskine Caldwell (\"You Have Seen Their Faces\", 1937), Arthur Rothstein and William Saroyan (\"Look At Us...\", 1967). In spite of the Red Scare and McCarthyism in the 1950s (which banned the Photo League) it was promoted widely by The Family of Man exhibitions, and strongly apparent in W. Eugene Smith's 1950s development of the photo essay, street photography by Helen Levitt, Vivian Meier et al., and work by Bruce Davidson (incl. his \"East\" \"100th Street)\", Eugene Richards, and Mary-Ellen Mark from the 50s to the 90s. The seminal work by Robert Frank, \"The Americans\" published in France in 1958 (Robert Delpire) and the USA the following year (Grove Press), the result of his two Guggenheim grants, can also be considered an extension of the humanist photography current in the USA which had a demonstrable impact on American photography.\n\nTypically humanist photographers harness the photograph's combination of description and emotional affect to both inform and move the viewer, who may identify with the subject; their images are appreciated as continuing the pre-war tradition of photo reportage as social or documentary records of human experience. It is praised for expressing of humanist values such as empathy, solidarity, sometimes humor, and mutual respect in recognition of the photographer, usually an editorial freelancer, as auteur on a par with other artists.\n\nDevelopments in technology supported these characteristics. The Ermanox with its fast and lenses (6 cm x 4.5 cm format, 1924) and the 35mm Leica, 1925) camera, miniaturized and portable, had become available by the end of the 1920s, followed by the medium-format Rolleiflex (1929), and the 35mm Contax (1936). They revolutionized the practice of documentary photography and reportage by enabling the photographer to shoot quickly and unobtrusively in all conditions, to seize the \"decisive moment\" which Cartier-Bresson defined as \"the whole essence, in the confines of one single photograph, of some situation that was in the process of unrolling itself before my eyes\" and thus support Cornell Capa's notion of \"concerned photography\", described as \"work committed to contributing to or understanding humanity's well-being\".\n\nThe list below is not exhaustive, but presents photographers that can be partially or totally attached to this movement:\n"}

{"id": "60315", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60315", "title": "Iris Murdoch", "text": "Iris Murdoch\n\nDame Jean Iris Murdoch (; 15 July 1919 – 8 February 1999) was an Irish-born British novelist and philosopher. Murdoch is best known for her novels about good and evil, sexual relationships, morality, and the power of the unconscious. Her first published novel, \"Under the Net\", was selected in 1998 as one of Modern Library's 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. In 1987, she was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire. Her books include \"The Bell\" (1958), \"A Severed Head\" (1961), \"The Red and the Green\" (1965), \"The Nice and the Good\" (1968), \"The Black Prince\" (1973), \"Henry and Cato\" (1976), \"The Sea, the Sea\" (1978, Booker Prize), \"The Philosopher's Pupil\" (1983), \"The Good Apprentice\" (1985), \"The Book and the Brotherhood\" (1987), \"The Message to the Planet\" (1989), and \"The Green Knight\" (1993). In 2008, \"The Times\" ranked Murdoch twelfth on a list of \"The 50 greatest British writers since 1945\".\n\nMurdoch was born in Phibsborough, Dublin, Ireland, the daughter of Irene Alice (née Richardson, 1899–1985) and Wills John Hughes Murdoch. Her father, a civil servant, came from a mainly Presbyterian sheep farming family from Hillhall, County Down. In 1915, he enlisted as a soldier in King Edward's Horse and served in France during the First World War before being commissioned as a Second lieutenant. Her mother had trained as a singer before Iris was born, and was from a middle-class Church of Ireland family in Dublin. Iris Murdoch's parents first met in Dublin when her father was on leave and were married in 1918. Iris was the couple's only child. When she was a few weeks old the family moved to London, where her father had joined the Ministry of Health as a second-class clerk.\n\nMurdoch was educated in progressive independent schools, entering the Froebel Demonstration School in 1925 and attending Badminton School in Bristol as a boarder from 1932 to 1938. In 1938 she went up to Somerville College, Oxford, with the intention of studying English, but switched to \"Greats\", a course of study combining classics, ancient history, and philosophy. At Oxford she studied philosophy with Donald M. MacKinnon and attended Eduard Fraenkel's seminars on \"Agamemnon\". She was awarded a first-class honours degree in 1942. After leaving Oxford she went to work in London for HM Treasury. In June 1944 she left the Treasury and went to work for the UNRRA. At first she was stationed in London at the agency's European Regional Office. In 1945 she was transferred first to Brussels, then to Innsbruck, and finally to Graz, Austria, where she worked in a refugee camp. She left the UNRRA in 1946.\n\nFrom 1947 to 1948 Iris Murdoch studied philosophy as a postgraduate at Newnham College, Cambridge. She met Wittgenstein at Cambridge but did not hear him lecture, as he had left his Trinity College professorship before she arrived. In 1948 she became a fellow of St Anne's College, Oxford, where she taught philosophy until 1963. \nFrom 1963 to 1967 she taught one day a week in the General Studies department at the Royal College of Art.\n\nIn 1956 Murdoch married John Bayley, a literary critic, novelist, and from 1974 to 1992 Warton Professor of English at Oxford University, whom she had met in Oxford in 1954. The unusual romantic partnership lasted more than forty years until Murdoch's death. Bayley thought that sex was \"inescapably ridiculous.\" Murdoch in contrast had \"multiple affairs with both men and women which, on discomposing occasions, [Bayley] witnessed for himself\".\n\nIris Murdoch's first novel, \"Under the Net\", was published in 1954. She had previously published essays on philosophy, and the first monograph about Jean-Paul Sartre published in English. She went on to produce 25 more novels and additional works of philosophy, as well as poetry and drama. In 1976 she was named to the Commander of Order of the British Empire and in 1987 was made a Dame Commander of Order of the British Empire. She was awarded honorary degrees by the University of Bath (DLitt,1983), University of Cambridge (1993) and Kingston University (1994), among others. She was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1982.\n\nHer last novel, \"Jackson's Dilemma\", was published in 1995. Iris Murdoch was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 1997 and died in 1999 in Oxford. There is a bench dedicated to her in the grounds of Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, where she used to enjoy walking.\n\nFor some time, Murdoch's influence and achievements as a philosopher were eclipsed by her success as a novelist, but recent appraisals have increasingly accorded her a substantial role in postwar Anglo-American philosophy, particularly for her unfashionably prescient work in moral philosophy and her reinterpretation of Aristotle and Plato. Martha Nussbaum has argued for Murdoch's \"transformative impact on the discipline\" of moral philosophy because she directed her analysis not at the once-dominant matters of will and choice, but at those of attention (how people learn to see and conceive of one another) and phenomenal experience (how the sensory \"thinginess\" of life shapes moral sensibility).\n\nIn a recent survey of Murdoch's philosophical work, Justin Broackes points to several distinctive features of Murdoch's moral philosophy, including a \"moral realism or 'naturalism', allowing into the world cases of such properties as humility or generosity; an anti‐scientism; a rejection of Humean moral psychology; a sort of 'particularism'; special attention to the virtues; and emphasis on the metaphor of moral perception or 'seeing' moral facts.\" Broackes also notes that Murdoch's influence on the discipline of philosophy was sometimes indirect, since it impacted both her contemporaries and the following generation of philosophers, particularly Elizabeth Anscombe, Philippa Foot, John McDowell, and Bernard Williams.\n\nHer philosophical work was influenced by Simone Weil (from whom she borrows the concept of 'attention'), and by Plato, under whose banner she claimed to fight. In re-animating Plato, she gives force to the reality of the Good, and to a sense of the moral life as a pilgrimage from illusion to reality. From this perspective, Murdoch's work offers perceptive criticism of Kant, Sartre and Wittgenstein ('early' and 'late'). Her most central parable, which appears in \"The Sovereignty of Good\", asks us (in Nussbaum's succinct account), \"to imagine a mother-in-law, M, who has contempt for D, her daughter-in-law. M sees D as common, cheap, low. Since M is a self-controlled Englishwoman, she behaves (so Murdoch stipulates) with perfect graciousness all the while, and no hint of her real view surfaces in her acts. But she realizes, too, that her feelings and thoughts are unworthy, and likely to be generated by jealousy and an excessively keen desire to hang on to her son. So she sets herself a moral task: she will change her view of D, making it more accurate, less marred by selfishness. She gives herself exercises in vision: where she is inclined to say 'coarse,' she will say, and see, 'spontaneous.' Where she is inclined to say 'common,' she will say, and see, 'fresh and naive.' As time goes on, the new images supplant the old. Eventually M does not have to make such an effort to control her actions: they flow naturally from the way she has come to see D.\" This is how M cultivates a pattern of behavior that leads her to view D \"justly or lovingly\". The parable is partly meant to show (against Oxford contemporaries including R. M. Hare and Stuart Hampshire) the importance of the 'inner' life to moral action. Seeing another aright can depend on overcoming jealousy, and discoveries about the world involve inner work.\n\nHer novels, in their attention and generosity to the inner lives of individuals, follow the tradition of novelists like Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy, George Eliot, and Proust, besides showing an abiding love of Shakespeare. There is however great variety in her achievement, and the richly layered structure and compelling realistic comic imagination of \"The Black Prince\" (1973) is very different from the early comic work \"Under the Net\" (1954) or \"The Unicorn\" (1963). \"The Unicorn\" can be read as a sophisticated Gothic romance, or as a novel with Gothic trappings, or perhaps as a parody of the Gothic mode of writing. \"The Black Prince\", for which Murdoch won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize, is a study of erotic obsession, and the text becomes more complicated, suggesting multiple interpretations, when subordinate characters contradict the narrator and the mysterious \"editor\" of the book in a series of afterwords. Though her novels differ markedly, and her style developed, themes recur. Her novels often include upper-middle-class male intellectuals caught in moral dilemmas, gay characters, refugees, Anglo-Catholics with crises of faith, empathetic pets, curiously \"knowing\" children and sometimes a powerful and almost demonic male \"enchanter\" who imposes his will on the other characters—a type of man Murdoch is said to have modelled on her lover, the Nobel laureate Elias Canetti.\n\nMurdoch was awarded the Booker Prize in 1978 for \"The Sea, the Sea\", a finely detailed novel about the power of love and loss, featuring a retired stage director who is overwhelmed by jealousy when he meets his erstwhile lover after several decades apart. An authorised collection of her poetic writings, \"Poems by Iris Murdoch\", appeared in 1997, edited by Paul Hullah and Yozo Muroya. Several of her works have been adapted for the screen, including the British television series of her novels \"An Unofficial Rose\" and \"The Bell\". J. B. Priestley's dramatisation of her 1961 novel \"A Severed Head\" starred Ian Holm and Richard Attenborough.\n\nIn 1997, she was awarded the Golden PEN Award by English PEN for \"a Lifetime's Distinguished Service to Literature\".\n\nLiterary critics and theorists have given her mixed reviews. Harold Bloom wrote in his 1986 review of \"The Good Apprentice\" that no other contemporary British novelist seemed of her 'eminence', and that she would be remembered for years to come. A. S. Byatt called her 'unmatched in world literature since her death', and listed her as a source of inspiration. Yet James Wood, in his influential work \"How Fiction Works\" said: 'In her literary and philosophical criticism, she again and again stresses that the creation of free and independent characters is the mark of a great novelist; yet her own characters never have this freedom.' He stressed that some authors, 'like Tolstoy, Trollope, Balzac and Dickens', wrote about people different to themselves by choice, whereas others, such as 'James, Flaubert, Lawrence, Woolf', have more interest in the self. Wood called Murdoch 'poignant', because she spent her whole life in writing in the latter category, whilst she struggled to fit herself into the former. Similarly, Sam Jordison, creator of the poll \"Crap Towns\", declared that, though her works had merit, she engaged in 'scenes of absurd melodrama', and moaned of her 'mystical bollocks'. He did, however, praise Murdoch's comic set pieces, and her portrayal of self-deceit. \n\nMurdoch won a scholarship to study at Vassar College in 1946, but was refused a visa to enter the United States because she had joined the Communist Party of Great Britain in 1938, while a student at Oxford. She left the party in 1942, when she went to work at the Treasury, but remained sympathetic to communism for several years. In later years she was allowed to visit the United States, but always had to obtain a waiver from the provisions of the McCarran Act, which barred Communist Party members and former members from entering the country. In a 1990 Paris Review interview she said that her membership of the Communist Party had made her see \"how strong and how awful it [Marxism] is, certainly in its organized form\".\n\nAside from her Communist Party membership, her Irish heritage is the other sensitive aspect of Murdoch's political life that seems to attract interest. Part of the interest revolves around the fact that, although Irish by both birth and traced descent on both sides, Murdoch does not display the full set of political opinions that are sometimes assumed to go with this origin: \"No one ever agrees about who is entitled to lay claim to Irishness. Iris's Belfast cousins today call themselves British, not Irish... [but] with both parents brought up in Ireland, and an ancestry within Ireland both North and South going back three centuries, Iris has as valid a claim to call herself Irish as most North Americans have to call themselves American\". Conradi notes A.N. Wilson's record that Murdoch regretted the sympathetic portrayal of the Irish nationalist cause she had given earlier in \"The Red and the Green\", and a competing defence of the book at Caen in 1978. The novel, while broad of sympathy, is hardly an unambiguous celebration of the 1916 rising, dwelling upon bloodshed, unintended consequences and the evils of romanticism, besides celebrating selfless individuals on both sides. Later, of Ian Paisley, Iris Murdoch stated \"[he] sincerely condemns violence and did not intend to incite the Protestant terrorists. That he is emotional and angry is not surprising, after 12–15 years of murderous IRA activity. All this business is deep in my soul, I'm afraid.\" In private correspondence with her close friend and fellow philosopher Philippa Foot, she remarked in 1978 that she felt \"unsentimental about Ireland to the point of hatred\" and, of a Franco-Irish conference she had attended in Caen in 1982, said that \"the sounds of all those Irish voices made me feel privately sick\".\n\nPeter J. Conradi's 2001 biography was the fruit of long research and authorised access to journals and other papers. It is also a labour of love, and of a friendship with Murdoch that extended from a meeting at her Gifford Lectures to her death. The book was well received. John Updike commented: \"There would be no need to complain of literary biographies [...] if they were all as good\". The text addresses many popular questions about Murdoch, such as how Irish she was, what her politics were, etc. Though not a trained philosopher, Conradi's interest in Murdoch's achievement as a thinker is evident in the biography, and yet more so in his earlier work of literary criticism \"The Saint and the Artist: A Study of Iris Murdoch's Works\" (Macmillan 1986, HarperCollins 2001). He also recalled his personal encounters with Murdoch in \"Going Buddhist: Panic and Emptiness, the Buddha and Me\". (Short Books, 2005). Conradi's archive of material on Murdoch, together with Iris Murdoch's Oxford library, is held at Kingston University.\n\nAn account of Murdoch's life with a different ambition is given by A. N. Wilson in his 2003 book \"Iris Murdoch as I Knew Her\". The work was described by Galen Strawson in \"The Guardian\" as \"mischievously revelatory\" and labelled by Wilson himself as an \"anti-biography\". Wilson eschews objectivity, but is careful to stress his affection for his subject. Wilson remarks that Murdoch \"had clearly been one of those delightful young women... who was prepared to go to bed with almost anyone\". While Murdoch's thought is an inspiration for Conradi, Wilson treats Murdoch's philosophical work as at best a distraction. In a BBC Radio 4 discussion of Murdoch and her work in 2009, Wilson stated his opinion, with which he acknowledged that \"no doctor would agree\", that Murdoch's struggle to complete her late philosophical book, \"Metaphysics as a Guide to Morals\", reduced her to despair and precipitated her into Alzheimer's.\n\nDavid Morgan met Iris Murdoch in 1964, when he was a student at the Royal College of Art. His 2010 memoir \"With Love and Rage: A Friendship with Iris Murdoch\", describes their lifelong friendship.\n\nJohn Bayley wrote two memoirs of his life with Iris Murdoch. \"Iris: A Memoir\" was published in the United Kingdom in 1998, shortly before her death. The American edition, which was published in 1999, was called \"Elegy for Iris\". A sequel entitled \"Iris and the Friends\" was published in 1999, after her death. Murdoch was portrayed by Kate Winslet and Judi Dench in Richard Eyre's film \"Iris\" (2001), based on Bayley's memories of his wife as she developed Alzheimer's disease.\n\nBBC Radio 4 broadcast in 2015 an \"Iris Murdoch season\" with several memoirs by people who knew her, and dramatizations of her novels.\n\nNovels\n\nShort Stories\n\nPhilosophy\n\nPlays\n\nPoetry collections\n\nSource: Centre for Iris Murdoch Studies, Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences Kingston University\n\n"}

{"id": "9903002", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9903002", "title": "Joseph Margolis", "text": "Joseph Margolis\n\nJoseph Zalman Margolis (born May 16, 1924) is an American philosopher. A radical historicist, he has published many books critical of the central assumptions of Western philosophy, and has elaborated a robust form of relativism.\n\nHis philosophical affinities include Protagoras, Hegel, C.S. Peirce, John Dewey, Ludwig Wittgenstein, W.V. Quine.\n\nJoseph Margolis was the son of Jewish immigrants from central Europe. His father, a dentist, read widely in literature and was proficient in four languages.\n\nMargolis served in World War II as a paratrooper and was wounded during the Battle of the Bulge, where he lost his only brother, a twin. He studied at Columbia University, earning the M.A. (1950) and Ph.D (1953) in philosophy. His contemporaries at Columbia have included the art theorist Arthur C. Danto and the philosopher Marx Wartofsky.\n\nMargolis has taught at numerous universities in the United States and Canada and has lectured throughout Europe, in Japan, New Zealand, and South Africa. Since 1991, he has held the Laura H. Carnell Chair of Philosophy at Temple University.\n\nIn 1973 Margolis was one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto II.\n\nAs set out in \"Historied Thought, Constructed World\" (California, 1995), Margolis holds that philosophy is concerned principally with three things:\n\n\nHe sees the history of philosophy concerning these three questions of reality, knowledge and ethics as a gradual movement away from the idea that any of these three realms is changeless and towards an increasing acceptance of real change infecting all three spheres. Margolis emphasizes that legitimation is philosophy's principal task.\n\nMargolis defends the Protagorean dictum that \"man is the measure of all things\", arguing that all changeless first principles must give way to consensual, though not criterial, truth claims. Since \"man\", the measure, is himself a creature of history, no modal claims of invariance can possibly be sustained. Margolis further avers that there need be no fixities either \"de re\" or \"de dicto\" or \"de cogitatione\". The world is a flux and our thought about it is also in flux. Margolis sees the whole history of Western philosophy as a struggle between the advocates of change and those who either, like Parmenides, deny that change is intelligible, or those, like Heraclitus, who find some \"logos\" or law which allegedly governs whatever changes are admitted. He has argued that cognitive privilege of the changeless lingers even in relatively pragmatic philosophy such as the work of W.V. Quine. Nonetheless, Margolis proposes possible modes of legitimation even under the ubiquity of flux. Contrary to postmodern philosophers like Richard Rorty or Jean-François Lyotard, he argues that our lack of cognitive privilege means that the need for philosophical justification becomes more, not less, pressing.\n\nMargolis began close to the so-called analytical school of English-speaking philosophy but his mature work draws freely on both analytic and Continental philosophy. In large part this disciplinary eclecticism reflects his ambition to overcome the apparent opposition between the naturalist tradition of analytic philosophy and the humanistic tradition of Continental philosophy.\n\nTo achieve this, Margolis treats the \"natural\" as ontologically prior to the cultural, while emphasizing that we only know nature via cultural means, hence, that the cultural is epistemologically prior to the natural. This position is developed at length in his \"Selves and Other Texts\" (Penn State, 2001).\n\nHis philosophical pursuits, expressed programmatically, are:\n\n\nMargolis has published more than thirty books, on a variety of topics in philosophy. In \"Historied Thought, Constructed World\" (California, 1995), he argues that philosophy uncritically adopts the Platonic-Aristotelian view that \"necessarily, reality is invariantly structured and, when known, discernibly known to be such\". Beginning with his counterproposal - \"(2.1) It is not in any way conceptually necessary that reality possess invariant structures or an invariant nature\" - Margolis gradually traces out an alternative view. For instance, Margolis argues that Aristotle's discussion of the principle of non-contradiction presupposes the changelessness of individual things rather than providing any proof of the alleged law. In Margolis's view non-contradiction applies to \"sentential formulas\" and not to \"meaningful sentences\", since discourse in use may always offset any seeming contradiction via re-interpretation, as is routinely done in science (for instance, in the case of the wave theory versus the corpuscular theory of light). In other words, there is no conceptual necessity to accept a strictly bivalent logic; our logics depend, in a deep sense, on what we pre-thinkingly take the real world to be like. Hence, there is no reason to disallow relativism at all, for the world may well be the kind of place where incongruent judgments - judgments which on a bivalent reading would be \"true\" or \"false\", but are now no longer so, adhering to a many valued logic, one consisting of more than two exclusive truth-values - are all that creatures such as ourselves may ever hope to legitimate.\n\nMargolis goes on to examine reference and predication as our ability to probe and communicate the results of our probings. Constative discourse – the making of statements of fact — for instance need only rely on identification, and reidentification, of items for it to prove effective in use. Therefore, historical memory and consensus, together with a narratizing ability, are all that are necessary to ensure the stability of what we make reference to, there need be nothing essential at all in things themselves, for our constative discourse to be able to flourish and even thrive. Margolis inveighs against postmodernists of Rorty’s stamp, claiming that they risk disabling constative discourse in their objectivist fears of privilege. There need be, according to Margolis, no conceptual privilege involved in making statements, nor in the justifications proferred for the statements made.\n\nStill, Margolis emphasizes that justifications cannot be dispensed with, as any statement implies a whole set of beliefs about the way the world is and about how we know that. We must legitimize our statements as best we can, else we should never know why we should choose some over others, nor should we know how to proceed to make other statements building upon, but going beyond, our original exemplars.\n\nThe key to how we in fact \"go on\" is to be found in Margolis's major postulate of \"Historied Thought, Constructed World\": \"Thinking is a History\". Making meaningful reference within constative discourse is a thoroughly historical skill. What we predicate - about what is thus referred to - is likewise historical. Margolis argues that the struggle to entrench changelessness either in human thought or human nature or physical nature has, in large part, been a futile struggle against acknowledging the lack of any fixed-kind nature of the human being. It is futile, Margolis claims, in that we have no natures but are histories. Nevertheless, Margolis admits that there are enough man-made would-be stabilities and fixities to go round. There is the habituating weight of the customary, the slow change in human languages, the inertia of institutions.\n\nMargolis acknowledges that the historized \"nature\" of the human—and therefore of truth, of judgment, of reality, and the rest - is not his own discovery, but criticizes most previous versions of historicism as falling victim to some theological or teleological yearning, as in Hegel's \"Geist\", Marx's utopianism, or Heidegger's history of being. In Margolis's view, the truth claims of earlier historical epochs are given their historical weight, from our own historical present, our own truth claims regarding theirs are subject to our own bias and blindness, but ours must still be legitimated as best we can legitimate them, taking into account as far as humanly possible – though never overcoming - our limited horizon via self-critique.\n\nMargolis claims that five philosophical themes have gathered momentum from the time of Kant on. They are:\n\n\nHe embraces all five themes separately and conjointly, defends them all, and concludes that our future investigations of ourselves and of our world risk ignoring them at our own peril. His own investigations into \"ourselves\" have proceeded with a focus on a consideration of the arts as an expression of human being. In \"What, After All, Is a Work of Art\" (1999) and \"Selves and Other Texts\" (2001), he elaborated upon his earlier work on the ontological similarity between human persons and artworks. The latter\n– defined as \"physically embodied, culturally emergent entities\" – he treats as examples of \"human utterance\". Margolis argues that the cultural world is a semantically and semiotically dense domain, filled with self-interpreting texts, acts and artifacts.\n\nMargolis has philosophical affinities with Hegel, Marx, Peirce, John Dewey, the later Wittgenstein, and Michel Foucault. From Hegel and Marx, he takes on their historicism without their teleologisms, or theories of some historical goal. From Peirce, he takes the idea of Secondness, the brute thingness of things which guides our sense of reality. With Dewey, he shares the conviction that philosophy should never exceed \"natural\" bounds. With Wittgenstein, he holds that \"what has to be accepted, the given, is – so one could say - forms of life\" (PI; 226). Finally, Margolis sees Foucault's \"historical a-priori\" as a fair replacement for Kant's transcendental a-priori.\n\nMargolis has extensively criticized what he sees as scientism in philosophy, singling out thinkers such as Noam Chomsky, Paul Churchland, Jerry Fodor, and Daniel Dennett as modern-day defenders of invariance.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The Tayasu was one of the \"gosankyō\", the seniormost of the lesser cadet branches of the Shōgun's family, which still bore the name Tokugawa (instead of the cadet branches which had the Matsudaira surname).\n\nHis father was Tayasu Munetake, the son of the reform-minded eighth shōgun Tokugawa Yoshimune. The Tayasu house stood apart from the other cadet branches resident in Edo Castle, living a more austere lifestyle, following the example set by Yoshimune—in Munetake's words, the praise of manly spirit (\"masuraoburi\") as opposed to feminine spirit (\"taoyameburi\"). It also set itself apart from the other branches due to its history of thwarted political ambition—the founder, Munetake, had hoped to become his father's heir but was passed over for Yoshimune's eldest son, Ieshige. As a result, Sadanobu was brought up from a very young age with the hopes of being placed as the next shogunal heir. His education was very thorough, being done along Confucian lines, and by his teens Sadanobu had already read and memorized much of the Confucian canon. As he matured, there was a further onus on Sadanobu for success as several members of the Tayasu house began to die young. Further attempts were made by the family to place Sadanobu as the next shogunal heir, but they were thwarted by the political clique of Tanuma Okitsugu, who was then in power as the chief rōjū.\n\nFollowing the last failed attempt at adoption by the shōgun, Sadanobu was adopted by Matsudaira Sadakuni, head of one of the Hisamatsu-Matsudaira houses (another Tokugawa cadet branch), which ruled the Shirakawa Domain in southern Mutsu Province (with an assessment of 110,000 \"koku\"), succeeding to headship in late 1783 following his stepfather's protracted illness. He was immediately faced with his domain's economically disastrous position: of 110,000 \"koku\" that it was supposed to be able to produce, 108,600 had been reported \"lost\". Sadanobu worked ceaselessly to fix the economic situation in Shirakawa, finally saving it and bringing its finances and agriculture back to stability. These reforms, coupled with Sadanobu's continued political maneuvering, brought him fame, and he was named chief councilor of the Shogunate in the summer of 1787, and regent to the 11th shōgun Tokugawa Ienari early the following year.\n\nThis period of Sadanobu's strengthening of the already faltering Tokugawa regime is known as the Kansei Reforms. His policies could as well be construed as a reactionary response to the execesses of his predecessor under Shōgun Ieharu. He recovered the finances of the Shogunate to some extent, and had some success in rescuing its reputation. However, following the Title Incident and the visit of Adam Laxman, Sadanobu's credibility and popularity in the Tokugawa bureaucracy became overtaxed, and true to the suggestion in his autobiography that \"one should retire before discontent sets in\", he resigned.\n\nAside from his political reforms, Sadanobu was also known as a writer and a moralist, working under the pen name \"Rakuō\" (楽翁). Some of his notable texts include \"Uge no Hitokoto\", \"Tōzen Manpitsu\", \"Kanko-dōri\", \"Kagetsutei Nikki\", \"Seigo\", and \"Ōmu no Kotoba\", among others. Some time after his death, it was discovered that he had written a satirical text parodying \"daimyō\" life, titled \"Daimyō Katagi\". Scholars have since been somewhat taken aback by this discovery, since the text falls into the category of \"gesaku\", which Sadanobu officially opposed.\n\nThough Sadanobu resigned from his position on the senior council, he continued to keep up with political affairs, especially keeping in close touch with Matsudaira Nobuaki (his successor in the senior council), as well as the rector of the Shogunate's college, Hayashi Jussai, whom he had personally installed in that position. During these last few years of his rule in Shirakawa, he was also involved in matters of national defense, taking up security duties on the Bōsō Peninsula in 1810 together with Matsudaira Katahiro of Aizu. In domainal matters, Sadanobu continued to devote himself to the reforms he had established, as well as to education. He retired from the family headship in 1819, and was succeeded by his son Sadanaga. Sadanobu died in 1829, and according to his will, his son petitioned the Yoshida family in Kyoto to grant him the deified title of \"Shukoku-daimyōjin\". This was granted in three stages, in 1833, 1834, and 1855. Sadanobu was enshrined together with the Hisamatsu founder Sadatsuna, Sugawara no Michizane, and two other figures, in the Chinkoku-Shukoku shrine. This shrine has branches both in Kuwana, where Sadanaga was transferred, and in Sadanobu's former fief of Shirakawa, where the shrine was built in 1918.\n\nOne of Sadanaga's sons, Itakura Katsukiyo, became almost as famous as his grandfather in the late Edo era, due to his attempted reforms of the Shogunate.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "720757", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=720757", "title": "New mysterianism", "text": "New mysterianism\n\nNew mysterianism—or commonly just mysterianism—is a philosophical position proposing that the hard problem of consciousness cannot be resolved by humans. The unresolvable problem is how to explain the existence of qualia (individual instances of subjective, conscious experience). In terms of the various schools of philosophy of mind, mysterianism is a form of nonreductive physicalism. Some \"mysterians\" state their case uncompromisingly (Colin McGinn has said that consciousness is \"a mystery that human intelligence will never unravel\"); others believe merely that consciousness is not within the grasp of present human understanding, but may be comprehensible to future advances of science and technology.\n\nOwen Flanagan noted in his 1991 book \"Science of the Mind\" that some modern thinkers have suggested that consciousness may never be completely explained. Flanagan called them \"the new mysterians\" after the rock group Question Mark and the Mysterians.\n\"But the new mysterianism is a postmodern position designed to drive a railroad spike through the heart of scientism\". The term \"new mysterianism\" has been extended by some writers to encompass the wider philosophical position that humans do not have the intellectual ability to solve (or comprehend the answers to) many hard problems, not just the problem of consciousness, at a scientific level. This position is also known as anti-constructive naturalism.\n\nAccording to Flanagan, \"The 'old mysterians' were dualists who thought that consciousness cannot be understood scientifically because it operates according to nonnatural principles and possesses nonnatural properties.\" Apparently, some apply the terms to thinkers throughout history who suggested some aspect of consciousness may not be knowable or discoverable, including Gottfried Leibniz, Samuel Johnson, and Thomas Huxley. Thomas Huxley wrote, \"[H]ow it is that anything so remarkable as a state of consciousness comes about as a result of irritating nervous tissue, is just as unaccountable as the appearance of the Djinn, when Aladdin rubbed his lamp.\" \n\nIn the view of the new mysterians, their contention that the hard problem of consciousness is unsolvable is not a presupposition, but rather a philosophical conclusion reached by thinking carefully about the issue. The standard argument is as follows:\n\nSubjective experiences by their very nature cannot be shared or compared side-by-side. Therefore it is impossible to know what subjective experiences another person is having.\n\nNoam Chomsky distinguishes between \"problems\", which seem solvable, at least in principle, through scientific methods, and \"mysteries\", which do not seem solvable, even in principle. He notes that the cognitive capabilities of all organisms are limited by biology, e.g. a mouse will never speak like a human. In the same way, certain problems may be beyond our understanding.\n\nIdealists would counter the mysterian view by pointing out that it is unscientific to use phrases such as \"we may never know\", or to try to limit the possibilities of a reflective consciousness, for example in gaining a knowledge of the underlying, pervading principle of consciousness. The apparent paradox that consciousness is \"out there\" and yet subjective to each individual cannot be solved unless the observer is the subject of the study, i.e. the scientist looks within.\n\nHistorical\n\nContemporary\n\n\n"}

Initially inspired by \"Junimea\" leader Titu Maiorescu, he was later a dissident of \"Junimism\", a Positivist and a supporter of literary realism. Politically, Xenopol also moved away from conservatism and was embraced by the liberal current, serving as editor of two liberal newspapers: \"Românul\" and \"Voința Națională\". He had a successful career in electoral politics, which began within the National Liberal Party and later saw him joining the Conservative-Democratic Party. In 1912, he was Minister of Commerce, and helped create an Academy of Economic Studies.\n\nXenopol was the author of two realistic novels criticizing the social environment of his day. His campaign for realism and his positive coverage of urban civilization pitted him against the conservative author Mihai Eminescu. Their violent debate of the 1880s is one of the highlights in Xenopol's career in cultural journalism. His passionate involvement in support of the liberal cause was another topic of controversy, and, on several occasions, he dueled with his colleagues in the press.\n\nLate in his life, N. Xenopol supported Romania's involvement in World War I alongside the Entente Powers. He died while carrying out his final mission, as Romania's first Ambassador to Japan.\n\nThe Xenopol brothers were of foreign origins: their father, known locally as \"Dimitrie\" (and allegedly born \"Xenopoulos\"), was a British and Greek subject of the Protestant faith, who settled in the port of Galați and converted to Romanian Orthodoxy. According to various sources, including \"Junimea\" memoirist Iacob Negruzzi and literary historian George Călinescu, he may have been Greco-Jewish. Dimitrie opened the way for his son's political, literary and diplomatic career: he was a \"Dragoman\" for the Prussian mission to Moldavia, a tutor of the Rosetti family children, a boarding house manager, and ultimately a prison warden. The Xenopols' mother, née Vasiliu, was of Greco-Romanian origins.\n\nNicolae was born in the Moldavian capital, Iași, as one of Dimitrie's six children: he had two brothers (Alexandru and Filip, the future architect) and three sisters. He completed his secondary education in that city. By 1877, he was affiliated with \"Junimea\", a conservative literary society founded by Maiorescu, Petre P. Carp, Iacob Negruzzi and other Moldavian men of letters. The club members responded to his quest for affirmation, and provided him with money to study abroad: after attending the University of Paris, he took his Doctor of Law diploma at the University of Liège. It was during his training period that Xenopol met and befriended other young Romanian students, including the future dramatist and theater manager Alexandru Davila. The grant did not meet all of his needs. He worked during most of college, and, for a while, gave up, trying to enlist in the Romanian Land Forces, or concentrating on writing his novel \"Brazi și putregai\" (\"Fir Trees and Rot\").\n\nXenopol made his debut as a novelist and a realist writer with the humorous work \"Păsurile unui american în România\" (\"The Griefs of an American in Romania\"), serialized by \"Junimea\"s \"Convorbiri Literare\" journal from late 1879 to mid 1880. \"Brazi și putregai\" first saw print as a series in the \"Junimist\" tribune \"Timpul\" (1880).\n\nBy 1882, N. Xenopol had drifted away from \"Junimea\", and, as the \"Junimists\" noted, may have lured Maiorescu's protégé, Ion Luca Caragiale, to join him in anti-Conservative politics. He was at the time involved with the newspaper \"Românul\", a mouthpiece of left-wing liberalism, and became its main editor. Working under liberal chief C. A. Rosetti, he was seconded for a while by Constantin Bacalbașa, who came from the liberal gazette \"Telegraful\". Xenopol's \"Românul\" chronicles there pleaded for a realistic literature, capable of describing class conflict—for Xenopol, the model to follow was a young novelist from Transylvania, Ioan Slavici. Another author highly praised by Xenopol was the \"Junimist\" Nicolae Gane: both Xenopol and his former patron Maiorescu believed that Gane's short story set the standard for a new literary language.\n\nXenopol called for Slavici's novels to be studied by other writers, and then be used in creating an urban-themed, fully modern, literature. The pillar of \"Junimist\" poetics, Mihai Eminescu, responded to this argument with a virulent article, which identified Xenopol's theories with cosmopolitanism and alienation. Initially overwhelmed by Eminescu's tone, Xenopol replied with a mordant piece in \"Telegraful\" (April 1882), where the focus was on Eminescu's own ethnic origins. According to literary historian Constantin Cubleșan: \"Politically, [Xenopol] became noted as a \"Junimea\" adversary, writing unusually violent lampoons against its members, with coarse and demeaning language\".\n\nIn short time, Xenopol affiliated with the National Liberal Party (PNL), whereas \"Junimea\" had become an inner faction of the Conservative group. For a while in 1884, he was Head of the Bucharest Public Library. In 1885, PNL Prime Minister Ion Brătianu made Xenopol his personal secretary. Also then, Xenopol welcomed the Belgian visitor Émile Louis Victor de Laveleye, arranging him a meeting with C. A. Rosetti.\n\nThis period marked the start of another open conflict between Xenopol and the \"Junimists\": the former took over as editor of the PNL mouthpiece \"Voința Națională\", and began publishing essays denouncing the backwardness of \"Junimist\" ideology. By October 1886, Xenopol even sided with \"Junimea\"s Marxist adversaries at \"Contemporanul\", and allowed Marxist leader Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea to publish anti-Maiorescu pieces in \"Voința Națională\". He collected such articles, adding his own, into the brochure \"Contrazicerile d-lui T. Maiorescu\" (\"Mr. T. Maiorescu's Contradictions\"). During 1885, Xenopol also directed the antisemitic campaign against the \"Alliance Israélite Universelle\", with unsigned articles which may or may not have been written by Caragiale.\n\nAnother target for Xenopol's attacks was his former \"Românul\" colleague C. Bacalbașa. The latter demanded satisfaction for claims made about him in \"Voința Națională\", and the two journalists dueled each other at the racecourse in Băneasa. The understanding was that the loser would be the first to shed blood: Bacalbașa's blade touched Xenopol's finger, and Xenopol conceded defeat. Later in the year, \"Voința Națională\" focused its gibes on the Conservative paper \"Epoca\". As a result, Xenopol was visited in his home by two \"Epoca\" men, Nicolae Filipescu and A. A. Balș, who threatened him with physical harm; Xenopol pulled a gun on them, and the authorities were called in—Filipescu and Balș were received prison terms, but were pardoned 3 months into their sentences. Xenopol himself was still a passionate duelist, and, in one other instance, is said to have charged an adversary with a blade after their duel of pistols ended in a draw.\n\nN. Xenopol's activities reached into other fields. He and the Bukovinan composer Ciprian Porumbescu wrote a choral, \"Erna\", published by the \"Armonia\" Music Society in 1885. The same year, he lectured at the Romanian Atheneum in Bucharest. His conference, published as a booklet later in the year, was a satire of Romanian politics, and carried the title \"Hatîrul\" (\"The Favor\").\n\nN. Xenopol married, in 1887, the daughter of Băicoianu (Baycoiano), Prefect of Mehedinți County. In 1891, the young author collected his satirical articles into a single tome, \"Cronici glumețe\" (\"Funny Chronicles\"); \"Păsurile unui american în România\" was first published as a volume the following year. Still a PNL man, Xenopol was first elected to the Assembly of Deputies during the 1895 suffrage, and preserved his seat for several mandates, before moving to a similar position in the Senate. He was a member of all successive Romanian legislatures until 1917.\n\nIn parallel, N. Xenopol carried on with his cultural initiatives. In March 1895, he lectured at the Romanian Atheneum on the topic of \"crowd psychology\", criticizing Scipio Sighele's ideas on the topic. In 1898, he accepted an invitation from art patron Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești, and joined the steering committee of his \"Ileana\" art society, which grouped independent painters reacting against academic art.\n\nN. Xenopol made his return to journalism in 1904, when he founded a French-language magazine, \"Le Mouvement Economique\" (\"The Economic Movement\"), directed by him until 1915. By 1906, he had left the PNL and joined the Conservative Party. The Conservative cabinet of Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino made Xenopol a member of its delegation, which negotiated a new trade agreement between the Kingdom of Romania and the French Republic. Well regarded by his superiors, he was later a Romanian negotiator of economic treaties with the Ottoman Empire and Austria-Hungary.\n\nIn January 1908, Xenopol affiliated with a Conservative splinter group, which became the Conservative-Democratic Party (PCD) and had Take Ionescu for leader. Later that year, his analysis of land reform in Romania was published by the \"Österreichische Rundschau\" in Austria-Hungary. Also then, Xenopol was made Officer of the French Republic's Legion of Honor. His conferencing on Romanian economic subjects earned him international exposure: in May 1910, he lectured in Paris, invited by the \"Revue Générale des Sciences\".\n\nIn 1911, Xenopol joined his brother Alexandru and fellow critic Mihail Dragomirescu in editing the journal \"Țară Nouă\" (\"New Country\"). It hosted contributions by some acclaimed writers, such as I. Dragoslav, Victor Eftimiu, Leon Feraru, Corneliu Moldovan, Cincinat Pavelescu and Elena Văcărescu. Although it received contributions from numerous Romanian academics and made special efforts to reach the Transylvanian public, \"Țară Nouă\" eventually closed down in 1912. In parallel, his merits as an economist were recognized internationally, and he was made a member of France's \"Société d'Economie Politique\".\n\nNicolae and Alexandru Xenopol were both involved in nationalistic agitation for the cause of Romanians in Transylvania and other regions of Austria-Hungary. In 1911, some of their books had been censored in Transylvania, and were subject to confiscation by the Hungarian Gendarmes. The same year, in May, N. Xenopol was called upon as an expert witness in the trial between antisemitic academic A. C. Cuza and lawyer Emil Socor. Xenopol was supposed to testify as to whether Socor had been right to call Cuza a plagiarist, but he recused himself.\n\nN. Xenopol's political career peaked in 1912. That year, after the PNL and the PCD toppled the Conservative-\"Junimist\" Premier Petre P. Carp, and Maiorescu formed a governing alliance with Take Ionescu, Xenopol joined the administration. Ionescu, Constantin Dissescu, Alexandru Bădărău and Xenopol, who took over the Ministry of Commerce, were the four PCD ministers in Maiorescu's cabinet. His time in office saw the adoption of some major labor laws, whereby he structured the professions, regulated trade unions (including the Civil Servants' Chamber) and provided for workers' compensation. His major accomplishment was the establishment of an Academy of Economic Studies, independent from the university system. The irregular character and the staff appointments by government were rather controversial, and Xenopol's policies earned much criticism in the Romanian media of the 1910s.\n\nA protectionist, Xenopol was interested in opening up new markets for Romanian products, but also favored France's economic interests over those of Germany. In May 1913, Xenopol visited the Kingdom of Italy, trying to increase the share of Italian investments in his country (according to his own estimate, Italy was the fifth exporter to Romania). During the last days of 1913, Maiorescu handed in his government's resignation, opening the way for a new National Liberal administration; his had been the last ever Conservative premiership.\n\nThe start of World War I reignited Nicolae Xenopol's career. Like other members of the PCD and PNL, and like his historian brother, he clamored his belief that Romania should renounce her neutrality and join the Entente nations. Their adversity was aimed at Austria-Hungary and the Central Powers, and their hope was that the Entente would help Romania to annex Transylvania. N. Xenopol was a guest speaker at the major pro-Entente rally of early October 1915, where Take Ionescu was also present. He joined a trans-party irredentist group called \"Federația Unionistă\", presided upon by his former Conservative enemy Nicolae Filipescu, with Ionescu as Vice President. One of the regular members, Transylvanian poet-activist Octavian Goga, remembered Xenopol as \"intelligent and industrious\", but of dubious honesty.\n\nIn 1916, Xenopol returned to publishing with a French-language study, \"La Richesse de la Roumanie\" (\"Romania's Wealth\"). It was in effect a condemnation of Romania's attachment to Germany and Austria-Hungary, beginning with the bilateral trade agreements of the 1870s. Xenopol contended that the imports from Austria-Hungary had destroyed branches of the Romanian economy, such as the shoe-making industry, and that Germany had sabotaged the Romanian export of cattle; he also argued that the Austrians were working to force Romania into becoming their vassal, as part of a Balkan \"Zollverein\".\n\nFilipescu's \"Federația\" happily dissolved itself in September 1916, shortly after Romania sealed an agreement with the Entente. In his closing speech, Filipescu welcomed the declaration of war as the dawn of a Greater Romania. In 1917, as Romania made efforts to recover from a German invasion, Xenopol was dispatched to the Empire of Japan (a fellow Entente country). Although fatigued, he took the perilous journey through the Russian Empire, and, as a tribute to the war effort, refused to take money for his services. He was Romania's first Ambassador to Tokyo, but died there, only months after taking over his post. One of his last efforts was helping a stranded group of Romanian Transylvanians sail for the US West Coast. In hindsight, literary historian Dan Mănucă notes that Xenopol, like his World War II successor Gheorghe Bâgulescu, was among the few Romanian diplomats who \"also went earnestly about their duties in propagating our culture\".\n\nAlready as a \"Junimea\" participant, Nicolae Xenopol cut a liberal and rebellious figure. Historian Alex Drace-Francis refers to him as a culture critic \"from the liberal, progressive wing of \"Junimea\"\". Among the \"Junimist\" intellectuals, Xenopol and George Panu stood out for being fully committed to the Positivism of Auguste Comte—the others were more interested in German idealism, evolutionism or metaphysical naturalism. Unlike the elitists and the misanthropists, he believed that \"crowd psychology\" was generally a constructive factor in the course of human civilization. Xenopol's ideas were also more permeated by new trends in literary theory—according to cultural historian Z. Ornea, he was \"exasperated\" by \"the ossification of the \"Junimist\" aesthetic doctrine\". Constantin Cubleșan refers to Xenopol as not just a realist writer, but also \"a fine analyst\" of the realist current, citing his ideas on Ioan Slavici: \"It is enough for a novel to be about national life, whatever the character types [...]. The essential is that those types should be truthful, and, as far as the events are unfolded, never stray from reality\".\n\nOrnea suggests that Xenopol's rebellion against first-generation \"Junimism\" and Maiorescu was first evident in 1878, when the young man came into direct contact with contemporary French literature. The resulting conflict with the \"Junimists\" was bitter and spiteful. Eminescu attacked in him the \"superimposed stratum\" of foreign intruders, calling him \"Mr. N. Xenopoulos\", and cautioning him that the \"defects of one's race\" were showing in Xenopol's praise of urban literature. Xenopol replied in kind. According to his account (also taken up by the liberal poet Alexandru Macedonski at \"Literatorul\" magazine), Eminescu was of Bulgarian origin, and therefore not of pure Romanian stock. His own 1882 portrait of Mihai Eminescu (whom he called by his birth name, \"Eminovici\") was purposefully grotesque and inflammatory, but, as Cubleșan notes, particularly colorful. It reads: \"[Eminescu has] an odd head with four edges, such as Bucharesters have surely seen among Bulgarian laborers [...]. This individual wears purple trousers, a borrowed black frock and a large black hat, exactly like those of Germans who walk about with the street organs on their backs; he is always covered in mud and his face and hands carry countless traces of purple ink\".\n\nIn reply, Eminescu stated that, regardless of the Slavic suffix in \"Eminovici\", his own lineage was Moldavian and aristocratic. Author and psychologist Vlad Mixich cites Eminescu's full answer as a sample of press insult in late 19th-century Romania: \"The things Mr. N. Xenopoulos says are, in my view, the figments of a fomenting imagination, excited by the sting of my putdown. But who do you think you are to be allowed, at your age and with the knowledge you don't have, to give yourself such superior airs?\"\n\nLiterary historian Tudor Vianu writes that, in his beginnings, Xenopol was \"a lyrical poet, swift in his rhymes\". According to Cubleșan, that part of Xenopol's career should be dismissed, as his patriotic poetry, including a piece about Dragoș Vodă, is in general pastiche from better known writers. Instead, Xenopol's prose was directly inspired by what Vianu calls \"the direct observation of local realities\". Vianu classifies Xenopol and the \"Junimist\" Leon C. Negruzzi in the same realist subgroup of \"Junimist\" literature, but adds that Negruzzi had always been a romantic.\n\nIohnson Blackwurst, the Yankee protagonist of \"Păsurile unui american în România\", is the voice through which the paradoxes of Romanian society are evidenced with sincere bemusement. Xenopol noted that his was a satire of Romanian life, intended to show how \"the disgusting reality\" of Romania is perceived in advanced \"bourgeois\" societies. As Vianu suggests, the ultimate inspiration for Xenopol's work was an 18th-century model, Montesquieu's \"Persian Letters\".\n\nWritten as a journalistic parody of Romantic travel literature, Iohnson Blackwurst's story begins with his naive quest to study the Romanians, Europe's \"bravest people\", and ends in bitter disappointment: during his visit to Iași, Blackwurst is humiliated, cheated and confused. The work is sketchy, and the narrated episodes have morals that are largely illustrations of Xenopol's political views. The narrator believes that the Jewish community is parasitical and destructive, that the political class is endemically corrupt, and that the only productive class, on whose backs Romania herself was erected, are the peasants.\n\nBuilding on the conclusions of various other critics, Cubleșan notes that, although \"Păsurile...\" is incomplete as a novel, its biting wit remains interesting. Philologist Ioana Costa suggests that Blackwurst's story is far from being a great novel itself, but that, as a \"mixture of frivolity, localized satire [and] current events\", it contains \"the seeds of that classical literature that has given \"Convorbiri Literare\" its unmistakable imprint\".\n\n\"Brazi și putregai\" is seen by Cubleșan as more ambitious, more rigorous and more meticulous project, in effect \"a faithful mirror of late 19th-century Romanian society\", midway between the proto-realism of Nicolae Filimon and the complex narratives of Duiliu Zamfirescu or Mihail Sadoveanu. At its core, \"Brazi și putregai\" is about the downfall of an aristocratic (boyar) family, unable to maintain its status in a modernized society. The central character, Alecu Negradi, is a sternly patriarchal boyar who has rebuilt his family's fortune, and who attempts to break in his rebellious son Iorgu by forcing him to manage an isolated mountain estate. From this point on, Alecu Nagradi's entire universe falls apart: his son finds new ways to disobey him, his wife commits adultery, and his peasants rise up in revolt; Iorgu's sister, Maria, bequeathed to a much older man, elopes. She escapes the manor just as the buildings go up in flames, without realizing that the peasants have murdered her father.\n\nThe book is foremost noted for its complex descriptions of nature scenes and people interacting. According to an admirer, the historian and writer Nicolae Iorga, Xenopol portrays his characters in such detail as to \"compete with the barbers\". However, Xenopol's use of antiquated Romanian has led some to suggest that \"Brazi și putregai\" is no longer digestible. As early as 1925, novelist Cezar Petrescu concluded that the novel's atmosphere is \"oldish and obsolete\". Writing in 1955, critic Teodor Vârgolici also assessed that \"Brazi și putregai\" \"is mostly of interest as a literary document\" (a verdict seen by Cubleșan as \"too drastic\").\n\nXenopol's criticism of Romania's political system was also given expression in \"Hatîrul\". According to Xenopol, favoritism and corruption were undermining the strength of Romanian society, since they detoured well-meaning projects, allowing one to interfere with the course of justice, or even to talk the Railway Company into servicing one's private residence.\n\nLargely forgotten by the general public, Nicolae Xenopol was better remembered in professional circles: in 1929, he was dedicated a monograph, published by the Academy of Economic Studies, with contributions from Alexandru Averescu, Dimitrie Gusti, Take Ionescu, Mina Minovici, Gheorghe Tașcă, Nicolae Vasilescu-Karpen etc. Tașcă, Henri Cihoski and various Academy graduates collected money for a Xenopol statue, but the project was put on hold and only taken up by the Academy in 2011.\n\nXenopol's dispute with Eminescu was revisited in a 2002 book by critic Alexandru Dobrescu: \"Detractorii lui Eminescu\" (\"Eminescu's Detractors\", second edition 2006). Poet and \"Convorbiri Literare\" book critic Emilian Marcu notes: \"[The detractors] are in fact intellectuals of great amplitude, who express opinions that are somewhat in contraction with those imposed officially. [Dobrescu's] book gives us a chance to rediscover [...] texts by authors who are at least honorable, over which, alas, the dust of oblivion has set. Their return into an intellectual circuit can only be beneficial for all those who truly wish to know more about the great Eminescu\". Similarly, critic Bogdan Crețu notes that Dobrescu managed to overturn the \"poltroonish\" classification of Xenopol and others as \"detractors\": \"the new anthology [is] an honest exercise in the reevaluation of an epoch that is much more nuanced and rich than the books of literary history or the dictionaries will have us know\". Contrarily, other experts routinely list Xenopol as mainly an anti-Eminescian—his has an entry among the \"detractors of Eminescu\" in Săluc Horvat's dictionary of Eminescu exegetes (published in 2010).\n\nN. Xenopol's Bucharest villa, on Arcului Street, was ravaged by neglect during the decades of Romanian communism. According to a 2008 article by critic Dan C. Mihăilescu, it is one of the few well restored period buildings in downtown Bucharest.\n\n"}

{"id": "53828", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53828", "title": "Ontological commitment", "text": "Ontological commitment\n\nAn ontological commitment refers to a relation between a language and certain objects postulated to be extant by that language. The 'existence' referred to need not be 'real', but exist only in a universe of discourse. As an example, legal systems use vocabulary referring to 'legal persons' that are collective entities that have rights. One says the legal doctrine has an \"ontological commitment\" to non-singular individuals. In information systems and artificial intelligence, where an ontology refers to a specific vocabulary and a set of explicit assumptions about the meaning and usage of these words, then an ontological commitment is an agreement to use the shared vocabulary in a coherent and consistent manner within a specific context. In philosophy a \"theory is ontologically committed to an object only if that object occurs in \"all\" the ontologies of that theory\"\n\nThe sentence “Napoleon is one of my ancestors” apparently commits us only to the existence of two individuals (i.e., Napoleon and the speaker) and a line of ancestry between them. The fact that no other people or objects are mentioned seems to limit the “commitment” of the sentence. However, it is well known that sentences of this kind cannot be interpreted in first-order logic, where individual variables stand for individual things. Instead, they must be represented in some second-order form. In ordinary language, such second-order forms use either grammatical plurals or terms such as “set of” or “group of”.\n\nFor example, the sentence involving Napoleon can be rewritten as “any group of people that includes me and the parents of each person in the group must also include Napoleon,” which is easily interpreted as a statement in second-order logic (one would naturally start by assigning a name, such as \"G\", to the group of people under consideration). Formally, collective noun forms such as “a group of people” are represented by second-order variables, or by first-order variables standing for sets (which are well-defined objects in mathematics and logic). Since these variables do not stand for individual objects, it seems we are “ontologically committed” to entities other than individuals — sets, classes, and so on. As Quine puts it,\n\nthe general adoption of class variables of quantification ushers in a theory whose laws were not in general expressible in the antecedent levels of logic. The price paid for this increased power is ontological: objects of a special and abstract kind, viz. classes, are now presupposed. Formally it is precisely in allowing quantification over class variables α, β, etc., that we assume a range of values for these variables to refer to. To be assumed as an entity is to be assumed as a value of a variable. (\"Methods of Logic\" p. 228)\n\nAnother statement about individuals that appears “ontologically innocent” is the well-known Geach–Kaplan sentence: \"Some critics admire only one another.\"\n\nWillard Van Orman Quine provided an early and influential formulation of ontological commitment:\nThe purpose of Quine's strategy is to determine just how the \"ontological commitment\" of a theory is to be found. Quine argued that the only ontologically committing expressions are variables bound by a first-order existential quantifier, and natural language expressions which were formalized using variables bound by first-order existential quantifiers.\n\nAttempts have been made to argue that predicates are also ontologically committing, and thus that subject-predicate sentences bear additional ontological commitment to abstract objects such as universals, sets, or classes. It has been suggested that the use of meaningful names in nonexistence statements such as “Pegasus does not exist” brings with it an ontological commitment to fictional objects like Pegasus, a quandary referred to as Plato's beard and escaped by using quantifiers.\n\nThis discussion has a connection to the Carnap-Quine argument over analytic and synthetic objects. Although Quine refers to 'ontological commitment' in this connection, in his rejection of the analytic/synthetic distinction he does not rely upon the formal translation of any particular theory along the lines he has suggested. Instead, Quine argues by using examples that although there are tautological statements in a formal theory, like \"all squares are rectangles\", a formal theory necessarily contains references to objects that are not tautological, but have external connections. That is, there is an \"ontological commitment\" to such external objects. In addition, the terms used to interpret the application of the theory are not simply descriptions of sensory input, but are statements in a context. That is, inversely, there is an \"ontological commitment\" of these observational objects to the formal theory. As Ryan puts it: \"Rather than being divided between contingent synthetic claims and indubitable analytic propositions, our beliefs constitute a continuous range from a periphery of sense-reports to interior concepts that are comparatively theory-laden and general.\" Thus we end up with Quine's 'flat' ontology that does not see a distinction between analytic and synthetic objects.\n\nWhatever process one uses to determine the ontological commitments of a theory, that does not prescribe what ontological commitments one should have. Quine regarded this as a matter of epistemology, which theory one should accept. \"Appeal is made to [concerns of] explanatory power, parsimony, conservatism, precision, and so on\".\n\nOntological parsimony can be defined in various ways, and often is equated to versions of Occam's razor, a \"rule of thumb, which obliges us to favor theories or hypotheses that make the fewest unwarranted, or \"ad hoc\", assumptions about the data from which they are derived.\" Glock regards 'ontological parsimony' as one of the 'five main points' of Quine's conception of ontology.\n\nFollowing Quine, Baker states that a theory, \"T\", is \"ontologically committed\" to items \"F\" if and only if \"T\" entails that \"F′\"s exist. If two theories, \"T\" and \"T\", have the same ontological commitments except that \"T\" is ontologically committed to \"F′\"s while \"T\" is not, then \"T\" is more parsimonious than \"T\". More generally, a sufficient condition for \"T\" being more parsimonious than \"T\" is for the ontological commitments of \"T\" to be a proper subset of those of \"T\".\n\nThese ideas lead to the following particular formulation of Occam's razor: 'Other things being equal, if \"T\" is more ontologically parsimonious than \"T\" then it is rational to prefer \"T\" to \"T\".' While a common formulation stipulates only that entities should not be multiplied beyond necessity, this version by contrast, states that entities should not be multiplied \"other things being equal\", and this is compatible with parsimony being a comparatively weak theoretical virtue.\n\nThe standard approach to ontological commitment has been that, once a theory has been regimented and/or \"paraphrased\" into an agreed \"canonical\" version, which may indeed be in formal logical notation rather than the original language of the theory, ontological commitments can be read off straightforwardly from the presence of certain ontologically committing expressions (e.g. bound variables of existential quantification). Although there is substantial debate about which expressions are ontologically committing, parties to that debate generally agree that the expressions they prefer are reliable bearers of ontological commitment, imparting ontological commitment to all regimented sentences in which they occur. This assumption has been challenged.\n\nInwagen has taken issue with Quine's methodology, claiming that this process did not lead to a unique set of fundamental objects, but to several possible sets, and one never could be certain that all the possible sets had been found. He also took issue with Quine's notion of a theory, which he felt was tantamount to suggesting a 'theory' was just a collection of sentences. Inwagen suggested that Quine's approach provided useful tools for discovering what entities were ontological commitments, but that he had not been successful. His attempts are comparable to an \"attempt to reach the moon by climbing ever higher trees...\"\n\nIt has been suggested that the ontological commitments of a theory cannot be discerned by analysis of the syntax of sentences, looking for ontologically committing expressions, because the true ontological commitments of a sentence (or theory) are restricted to the entities needed to serve as truthmakers for that sentence, and the syntax of even a regimented or formalized sentence is not a reliable guide to what entities are needed to make it true. However, this view has been attacked by Jonathan Shaffer, who has argued that truthmaking is not an adequate test for ontological commitment: at best, the search for the truthmakers of our theory will tell us what is \"fundamental\", but not what our theory is ontologically committed to, and hence will not serve as a good way of deciding what exists.\n\nIt also has been argued that the syntax of sentences is not a reliable guide to their ontological commitments because English has no form of words which reliably functions to make an existence-claim in every context in which it is used. For example, Jody Azzouni suggests that \"There is\" does not make any kind of genuine existence-claim when it is used in a sentence such as \"There are mice that talk\". Since the meaning of the existential quantifier in formal notation is usually explained in terms of its equivalence to English expressions such as \"there is\" and \"there exist\", and since these English expressions are not reliably ontologically committing, it comes to seem that we cannot be sure of our theory's ontological commitments even after it has been regimented into a canonical formulation. This argument has been attacked by Howard Peacock, who suggests that Azzouni's strategy conflates two different kinds of ontological commitment – one which is intended as a measure of what a theory explicitly claims to exist, and one which is intended as a measure of what is required for the theory to be true; what the ontological costs of the theory are. If ontological commitment is thought of as a matter of the ontological costs of a theory, then it is possible that a sentence may be ontologically committed to an entity even though competent speakers of the language do not recognize the sentence as asserting the existence of that entity. Ontological commitment is not a matter of what commitments one explicitly recognizes, but rather a matter of what commitments are actually incurred.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "188496", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=188496", "title": "Reflective equilibrium", "text": "Reflective equilibrium\n\nReflective equilibrium is a state of balance or coherence among a set of beliefs arrived at by a process of deliberative mutual adjustment among general principles and particular judgments. Although he did not use the term, philosopher Nelson Goodman introduced the method of reflective equilibrium as an approach to justifying the \"principles\" of inductive logic. The term 'reflective equilibrium' was coined by John Rawls and popularized in his \"A Theory of Justice\" as a method for arriving at the content of the principles of justice.\n\nRawls argues that human beings have a \"sense of justice\" which is both a source of moral judgment and moral motivation. In Rawls's theory, we begin with \"considered judgments\" that arise from the sense of justice. These may be judgments about general moral principles (of any level of generality) or specific moral cases. If our judgments conflict in some way, we proceed by adjusting our various beliefs until they are in \"equilibrium\", which is to say that they are stable, not in conflict, and provide consistent practical guidance. Rawls argues that a set of moral beliefs in ideal reflective equilibrium describes or characterizes the underlying principles of the human sense of justice.\n\nAn example of the method of reflective equilibrium may be useful. Suppose Zachary believes in the general principle of always obeying the commands in the Bible, and mistakenly thinks that these are completely encompassed by every Old Testament command. Suppose also that he thinks that it is not ethical to stone people to death merely for being Wiccan. These views may come into conflict (see Exodus 22:18, but see John 8:7). If they do, Zachary will then have several choices. He can discard his general principle in search of a better one (for example, only obeying the Ten Commandments), modify his general principle (for example, choosing a different translation of the Bible, or letting Jesus' teaching from John 8:7 \"If any of you is without sin, let him be the first to cast a stone\" override the Old Testament command), or change his opinions about the point in question to conform with his theory (by deciding that witches really should be killed). Whatever the decision, he has moved toward reflective equilibrium.\n\nReflective equilibrium serves an important justificatory function within Rawls's political theory. The nature of this function, however, is disputed. The dominant view, best exemplified by the work of Norman Daniels and Thomas Scanlon, is that the method of reflective equilibrium is a kind of coherentist method for the epistemic justification of moral beliefs. However, in other writings, Rawls seems to argue that his theory bypasses traditional metaethical questions, including questions of moral epistemology, and is intended instead to serve a practical function. This provides some motivation for a different view of the justificatory role of reflective equilibrium. On this view, the method of reflective equilibrium serves its justificatory function by linking together the cognitive and motivational aspects of the human sense of justice in the appropriate way.\n\nRawls argues that candidate principles of justice cannot be justified unless they are shown to be stable. Principles of justice are stable if, among other things, the members of society regard them as authoritative and reliably compliant with them. The method of reflective equilibrium determines a set of principles rooted in the human sense of justice, which is a capacity that both provides the material for the process of reflective equilibration and our motivation to adhere to principles we judge morally sound. The method of reflective equilibrium serves the aim of defining a realistic and stable social order by determining a practically coherent set of principles that are grounded in the right way in the source of our moral motivation, such that we will be disposed to comply with them. As Fred D'Agostino puts it, stable principles of justice will require considerable \"up-take\" by the members of society. The method of reflective equilibrium provides a way of settling on principles that will achieve the kind of \"up-take\" necessary for stability.\n\nReflective equilibrium is not static, though Rawls allows for provisional fixed points; it will change as the individual considers his opinions about individual issues or explores the consequences of his principles.\n\nRawls applied this technique to his conception of a hypothetical original position from which people would agree to a social contract. He arrived at the conclusion that the optimal theory of justice is the one to which people would agree from behind a veil of ignorance, not knowing their social positions.\n\nWide reflective equilibrium, first introduced by Rawls, has been described by Norman Daniels as \"a method that attempts to produce coherence in ordered triple sets of beliefs held by a particular person, namely: (a) a set of considered moral judgments, (b) a set of moral principles, and (c) a set of relevant (scientific and philosophical) background theories\".\n\nKai Nielsen has asserted that \"philosophers who are defenders of reflective equilibrium are also \"constructivists\"\", in response to what he considered to be the misconception that reflective equilibrium works with some necessarily preexisting coherent system of moral beliefs and practices: \n\nPaul Thagard has criticized the method of reflective equilibrium as \"only like a smokescreen for a relatively sophisticated form of logical and methodological relativism\" and \"at best incidental to the process of developing normative principles\". Among the \"numerous problems\" of reflective equilibrium, Thagard counted \"undue reliance on intuition and the danger of arriving at stable but suboptimal sets of norms\". In place of reflective equilibrium, Thagard recommended what he considered to be a more consequentialist method of justifying norms by identifying a domain of practices, identifying candidate norms for the practices, identifying the appropriate goals of the practices, evaluating the extent to which different practices accomplish these goals, and adopting as domain norms the practices that best accomplish these goals.\n\n\n"}

Together with Longchenpa and Ju Mipham, he is often considered to be one of the three \"omniscient\" writers of the school. His elder contemporary Atiśa (980–1054) considered Rongzompa to be an incarnation of the Indian ācārya Kṛṣṇapāda, the Great.

Barber writes that Rongzom was the first to receive the entire Dzogchen teachings of both Vimalamitra and Vairocana after the time of those two masters.

It originated with the ancient Zhou Dynasty and was founded on the political and spiritual doctrine of the Mandate of Heaven. The secular imperial title of the Son of Heaven was \"Emperor of China\". \n\nThe title, \"Son of Heaven\", was subsequently adopted by other East Asian monarchs to justify their rule. \n\nThe Son of Heaven was the supreme universal emperor, who ruled \"tianxia\" (\"all under heaven\"). His status is rendered in English as \"ruler of the whole universe\" or \"ruler of the whole world.\" The title, \"Son of Heaven\", was interpreted literally only in China and Japan, whose monarchs were referred to as demigods, deities, or \"living gods\", chosen by all the ancient gods and goddesses.\n\nThe title \"Son of Heaven\" stems from the concept of the Mandate of Heaven, created by the Zhou Dynasty monarchs to justify their having deposed the Shang Dynasty. They held that Heaven had revoked its mandate from the Shang and given it to the Zhou in retribution for Shang corruption and misrule. Heaven bestowed the mandate on whomever was most fit to rule. The title held the emperor responsible for the prosperity and security of his people by the threat of taking away his mandate.\n\nThe ancient Han Chinese imperial title, , \"Son of Heaven\", was later adopted by the Emperor of Japan during that country's Asuka period. Japan sent diplomatic missions to China, then ruled by the Sui dynasty, and formed cultural and commercial ties with China. Japan's Yamato state modeled its government after the Chinese Confucian imperial bureaucracy. A Japanese mission of 607 CE delivered a message from \"the Son of Heaven in the land where the sun rises ... to the Son of Heaven in the land where the sun sets.\" But the Japanese emperor's title was less contingent than that of his Chinese counterpart; there was no divine mandate that would punish Japan's emperor for failing to rule justly. The right to rule of the Japanese emperor, descended from the sun goddess Amaterasu, was absolute.\n\nThe Vietnamese also adopted the title, known in Vietnamese as \"Thiên tử\" (Chữ Hán: 天子). A divine mandate gave the Vietnamese emperor the right to rule, based not on his lineage but on his competence to govern. Vietnam's adoption of a Confucian bureaucracy, presided over by Vietnam's Son of Heaven, led to the creation of a Vietnamese tributary system in Southeast Asia, modeled after the Chinese Sinocentric system in East Asia.\n\n\"Son of Heaven\" was often one of several titles adopted by East Asian monarchs. Emperor Taizong of Tang held the Chinese title, \nSon of Heaven\", alongside the Central Asian title, \"Tengeri Qaghan\" (\"Tenger Khan\", or God-like Emperor), which he had gained after defeating the Tujue. Japanese monarchs likewise used a second title, , that, like \"Son of Heaven\", appealed to the emperor's connection to Heaven.\n\nBased on epitaphs dating to the 4th and 5th centuries, Goguryeo had concepts of Son of Heaven (天帝之子) and independent \"tianxia\". The rulers of Goryeo used the titles of emperor and Son of Heaven and positioned Goryeo at the center of the \"Haedong\" \"East of the Sea\" \"tianxia\", which encompassed the historical domain of the \"Samhan\", another name for the Three Kingdoms of Korea.\n\n\n"}

It was criticized by American conservative Jonah Goldberg, who tried to associate it with \"conservative phrenology\".

{"id": "2139040", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2139040", "title": "The World (Descartes)", "text": "The World (Descartes)\n\nThe World, also called Treatise on the Light (French title: \"Traité du monde et de la lumière\"), is a book by René Descartes (1596–1650). Written between 1629 and 1633, it contains a nearly complete version of his philosophy, from method, to metaphysics, to physics and biology.\n\nDescartes espoused mechanical philosophy, a form of natural philosophy popular in the 17th century. He thought everything physical in the universe to be made of tiny \"corpuscles\" of matter. Corpuscularianism is closely related to atomism. The main difference was that Descartes maintained that there could be no vacuum, and all matter was constantly swirling to prevent a void as corpuscles moved through other matter. \"The World\" presents a corpuscularian cosmology in which swirling vortices explain, among other phenomena, the creation of the Solar System and the circular motion of planets around the Sun.\n\n\"The World\" rests on the heliocentric view, first explicated in Western Europe by Copernicus. Descartes delayed the book's release upon news of the Roman Inquisition's conviction of Galileo for \"suspicion of heresy\" and sentencing to house arrest. Descartes discussed his work on the book, and his decision not to release it, in letters with another philosopher, Marin Mersenne.\n\nSome material from \"The World\" was revised for publication as \"Principia philosophiae\" or \"Principles of Philosophy\" (1644), a Latin textbook at first intended by Descartes to replace the Aristotelian textbooks then used in universities. In the \"Principles\" the heliocentric tone was softened slightly with a relativist frame of reference. The last chapter of \"The World\" was published separately as \"De Homine\" (\"On Man\") in 1662. The rest of \"The World\" was finally published in 1664, and the entire text in 1677.\n\nBefore Descartes begins to describe his theories in physics, he introduces the reader to the idea that there is no relationship between our sensations and what creates these sensations, thereby casting doubt on the Aristotelian belief that such a relationship existed. Next he describes how fire is capable of breaking wood apart into its minuscule parts through the rapid motion of the particles of fire within the flames. This rapid motion of particles is what gives fire its heat, since Descartes claims heat is nothing more than just the motion of particles, and what causes it to produce light.\n\nAccording to Descartes, the motion, or agitation, of these particles is what gives substances their properties (i.e. their fluidity and hardness). Fire is the most fluid and has enough energy to render most other bodies fluid whereas the particles of air lack the force necessary to do the same. Hard bodies have particles that are all equally hard to separate from the whole.\n\nBased on his observations of how resistant nature is to a vacuum, Descartes deduced that all particles in nature are packed together such that there is no void or empty space in nature (however, Descartes makes it clear that he does not claim that a void cannot exist in nature, since he lacks the observations necessary to say this with certainty).\n\nDescartes describes substances as consisting only of three elementary elements: fire, air and earth, from which the properties of any substance can be characterized by its composition of these elements, the size and arrangement of the particles in the substance, and the motion of its particles.\n\nThe motion of these particles and all other objects in nature are subject to the laws of motion Descartes had observed:\n\n\nDescartes in \"Principles of Philosophy\" added to these his laws on elastic collision.\n\nDescartes elaborates on how the universe could have started from utter chaos and with these basic laws could have had its particles arranged so as to resemble the universe we observe today. Once the particles in the chaotic universe began to move, the overall motion would have been circular because there is no void in nature, so whenever a single particle moves, another particle must also move to occupy the space where the previous particle once was. This type of circular motion, or vortex, would have created what Descartes observed to be the orbits of the planets about the sun with the heavier objects spinning out towards the outside of the vortex and the lighter objects remaining closer to the center. To explain this, Descartes used the analogy of a river that carried both floating debris (leaves, feathers, etc.) and heavy boats. If the river abruptly arrived at a sharp bend, the boats would follow Descartes third law of motion and hit the shore of the river since the flow of the particles in the river would not have enough force to change the direction of the boat. However, the much lighter floating debris would follow the river since the particles in the river would have sufficient force to change the direction of the debris. In the heavens, it’s the circular flow of celestial particles, or aether, that causes the motion of the planets to be circular.\n\nAs to the reason why heavy objects on Earth fall, Descartes explained this through the agitation of the particles in the atmosphere. The particles of the aether have greater agitation than the particles of air, which in turn have greater agitation than the particles that compose terrestrial objects (e.g. stones). The greater agitation of the aether prevents the particles of air from escaping into the heavens, just as the agitation of air particles forces terrestrial bodies, whose particles have far less agitation than those of air, to descend towards the world.\n\nWith his laws of motion set forth and the universe operating under these laws, Descartes next begins to describe his theory on the nature of light. Descartes believed that light traveled instantaneously - a common belief at the time – as an impulse across all the adjacent particles in nature, since Descartes believed nature was without a void. To illustrate this, Descartes used the example of a stick being pushed against some body. Just as the force which is felt at one end of the stick is instantly transferred and felt at the other end, so is the impulse of light that is sent across the heavens and through the atmosphere from luminous bodies to our eyes. Descartes attributed light to have 12 distinct properties:\n\n\nAlso:\n\n\n"}

It was started in 1879 in Asansol, West Bengal, as a modest 'Saint Joseph’s Seminary'. From 1889 to 1971 it developed in the mountains of Kurseong, near Darjeeling, where it was renamed Saint Mary’s College. From 1972 onwards it has flourished in the neighbourhood of the University of Delhi.\n\nVidyajyoti confers the Degrees of Bachelor of Theology, Master of Theology and Doctor of Theology. It also admits students for certificate courses for one or two years and diploma courses for three years.\n\nVidyajyoti is known for its efforts to develop a contextual method of doing theology. As integral part of its curriculum, each student is assigned to a concrete social context and initiated into socio-cultural analysis of the Indian situation. This enables the student to get a more competent and comprehensive grasp of the issues that affect the lives of ordinary Indians. Theological reflection is thus closely related to questions emerging from the context, thereby equipping each student to understand the Christian faith from within the Indian context and in dialogue with India’s many religions.\n\nVidyajyoti College of Theology is one of the oldest institutions of learning run by the Jesuits in India. It started in Asansol (West Bengal) in 1881, as a house for training in philosophy and theology for expatriate young European missionaries that at that time volunteered for service in India (among whom was the apostle of Chotanagpur, Constant Lievens) and came to the country without having yet done the years of study required for the priesthood.\n\nIn 1889, the Seminary, as it was then called, was transferred to hills of the Himalayas, in Kurseong (Darjeeling District), about 1800 metres above sea level, where for 82 years grew into an important centre of research and teaching of Indian religions and Christian theology, open to Indian and foreign Jesuits working in South Asia.\n\nIn 1932, the Holy See recognized it as a Faculty of Theology directly under its Congregation for Education, authorized to offer degrees of Licentiate and Doctorate in theology recognized in the Catholic Church.\n\nIn 1972, the St Mary's College, as it was then called, was transferred to Delhi where it took the name of Vidyajyoti College. It also opened its doors to any duly qualified students interested in the subjects it offers. As a result of a restructuring of its academic programme from 1978 the College opened extension centres in various parts of the country aimed at greater integration with the various cultures of India and at eventually teaching and studying theology in our rich local languages. At present, the faculty has five such extension centres in Chennai, Patna, Ranchi, Shantiniketan (West-Bengal) and Varanasi. Students do part of their courses in these centres and complete them in the national centre in Delhi.\n\nVidyajyoti is more than an academic institution. It is a way of life designed to form men and women dedicated to the service of others by letting the inner Divine Light shine through them. Many, though not all, of its students prepare for the priesthood. The personal growth in enlightened religious attitudes of bhakti and jñāna are central to the aims of the institution. The main prerequisite is therefore a deep religious faith and a desire for contact with the Divine. But faith needs to be enlightened by objective and valid knowledge. Yet, neither true bhakti nor jñāna will be authentic if they do not emerge from a life of commitment to the good of others, without karma.\n\nThe Faculty aims at:\npersonal religious and human growth of its members\nresearch and publication in the areas of religion, religious history, theology, Indian traditions, sociology of religion, and allied subjects\nteaching courses of theology at the levels of B.Th. and M.Th. and at doctoral research\nfostering and participating in ecumenical discourse and interreligious dialogue\nbeing involved in movements of the people aiming at their liberation from the clutches of poverty, oppression and marginalization.\n\nVidyajyoti College has a residential faculty consisting largely of Jesuits coming from all parts of India and from diverse cultural backgrounds. This diversity is enriched with the presence and support of ‘visiting lecturers’.\n\nThe Faculty is governed by the Academic Council, which consists of: (a) All Professors, Readers, Lecturers and Tutors who are permanent members of the Staff; (b) The Rector of Vidyajyoti; (c) The Registrar; (d) Associate and Visiting teachers during their stay at the centre; (e) Three representatives of the B.Th. students as well as one representative of the postgraduate students for matters especially concerning the order of studies and other matters affecting the academic life and interests of the students. If there is no woman representative among those elected, the Principal in consultation with Executive Council will nominate one. The students of each Regional Centre elect one representative. The Treasurer, Administrator and Librarian, unless they are otherwise members of the Council, may be called whenever found opportune.\n\nSome people are puzzled by the word theology although it is quite a traditional word. Literally it means the study or understanding of God. It is true that by its transcendence the Divine is beyond the scope of human rational study. There are other roads to contact the Mystery at the root of all existence. Religions have somehow given testimony to it. The study of religions and of other ways in which the concept and the reality of the Divine has impacted in human history forms the specific field of the study of theology. It includes the study of the great Scriptures, and the way in which the respective communities have understood their message. For Christians the Bible is primary but not exclude other Scriptures. There is also the study of religious history of humanity and of our own community and of the many expressions for the Divine found in history.\n\nTheology is necessary if religion wants to avoid the pitfalls of irrationality and narrow fundamentalism. It is important to study our own faiths by using the gifts of reason and understanding, and the sense of the higher values, which nature, or rather God, has given us. Theology is not a rationalization of religion or of faith. Rather it helps faith be truly human, flourish and be fruitful within the complexities of life.\n\nThe aim of Vidyajyoti is to do contextual theology. This means that the understanding of God and of the knowledge of God which our faith has given us takes into account the rich historical culture in which we find ourselves and is articulated in ways that make sense within this context. This has been in the past and continues to be the specific theological focus of Vidyajyoti, so much so that already in 1905 it started in Kurseong an ‘Indian Academy’ to facilitate the study of Indian religions at a time when colonialism was still the dominant culture.\n\nVidyajyoti currently has 305 students on its rolls studying at its college in Delhi and its RTCs (regional theology centres). The students are university graduates or postgraduates belonging to some 70 religious congregations, dioceses, secular institutes and lay associations from every part of India and abroad. Although most of the students belong to the Indian subcontinent, there are a few from abroad, as well. While the medium of education is English, Hindi is mostly used for fieldwork.\n\nVidyajyoti seeks to nourish in its students a vibrant spirituality to sustain its theology and praxis. The spiritual life of students is nurtured through regular religious exercises and sacramental life (daily Eucharist, weekly adoration, monthly recollection, yearly retreat, special preparations for diaconate and so on). A Jesuit counselor — assisted by some staff-members with training in psycho-spirituality — provides spiritual guidance. The staff and students also organize and actively participate in various other spiritual, pastoral and ecumenical programmes in and around Delhi.\n\nThe diversity among Vidyajyoti’s students is representative of the diversity in India itself. The students speak some twenty languages and bring their cultural treasures to expression during the yearly festivals that are celebrated. Besides the national festivals of India that are celebrated with appropriate liturgy, three major cultural festivals are celebrated. These are (a) Karam, which is a tribal festival celebrated by the Chotanagpur adivasis (aboriginals), (b) Onam a harvest festival celebrated by the people of Kerala in south India, and (c) Pongal the harvest festival of Tamil Nadu, south India. At these occasions, through creative use of the media, dance, drama, music and other means, the students highlight the meaning of these feasts, their theological relevance and their impact in the lives or ordinary people. Other cultural activities include an annual cultural programme held in the college and in Tihar Jail where the students work, as well as occasional skits and debates on themes of theological interest.\n\nBesides the extracurricular activities of the college, Vidyajyoti’s students offer Extension Services to other academic institutions in Delhi and elsewhere. Groups of students offer their services for conducting self-awareness, personality development, faith formation and social awareness seminars and weekends for students of other colleges and schools. Seminars are also conducted for teachers in various schools and colleges so as to improve teacher-student relationships. The Vidyajyoti students also network with socially committed groups in organizing interfaith initiatives, highlighting social problems and dialoguing on religio-social concerns that affect life in India.\n\nFieldwork is an integral part of the Vidyajyoti curriculum. Every student is required to opt for and be committed to some form of fieldwork since the faculty considers guided socio-pastoral involvement as an essential dimension of doing contextual theology. Each student is put into direct contact with a specific community, especially the marginalized ones to gain direct experience of the negativities of life and the suffering of the poor. This context then becomes a locus theologicus — a site for a deepening reflection on the Christian faith and other faiths, as well.\n\nApart from these regular ministries, orientation programs and spiritual guidance in various schools and parishes are also conducted in and around Delhi for teachers, students and youth. Students are also involved in SAMAG (Social and Media Action Group) that creates awareness among the students of Vidyajyoti on issues of injustice, violation of human rights, exploitation of women, decisions that affect the Dalits, tribals and children. SAMAG also takes initiative to organize and collaborate with other NGOs and agencies fighting for the rights of the oppressed and marginalized in the form of dharna and protests.\n\nRegular pastoral reflection sessions in the College are intended to integrate theology with the experience of the students in their fieldwork and vice versa. In this way, the students are trained to cultivate a deeply human and Christian perspective of life that calls for committed responds to the signs of the times.\n\nFor their pastoral and social ministries the students visit those in prison (Tihal Jail), in hospitals and homes run by the Missionaries of Charity. They organize activities and tuitions for slum, railway stations and neighbourhood children (Bal mela). Some are involved in organizing religious services in Delhi parishes and give guidances to spiritual and youth groups (Small Christian communities, Youth catholic associations, etc.). They help also marginal groups into organizing themselves into self-help units: domestic workers from the tribal areas, rickshaw pullers (Asha ki kiran), etc.\n\nThe library holds nearly 130,000 volumes and has more than 300 reviews. Most of the library has been computerized and the students have access to three points of entry into the computer and to the stacks of the library. The library is particularly rich in the fields of Biblical studies, systematic and pastoral theology, spirituality, Hinduism and Indian culture and Islamics.\n\nThe library has a few hundreds of ancient publications, some of them from the 16th to the 19th century. Its oldest book was printed in 1514, a Latin commentary on the Book of Sentences of Peter Lombard, which was almost a kind of text book of theology in the 16th century university of Paris. The library has also a precious manuscript of a Tamil-French dictionary composed in the 18th century, one of the earliest monuments of Tamil lexicography.\n\nThe library is open to research scholars and staff of Jawaharlal Nehru University, the University of Delhi, Jamia Millia Islamia and other scholars from India and abroad.\n\nFrom 2005 we have started the process of digitalising some rare and ancient books and manuscripts in Vidyajyoti Library as a collaborative venture with the EurIndia Project of Preservation of Rare Books to make these rich resources available to scholars through internet facilities. The Hosten Collections are also in the process of being digitalised.\n\nTheological research being one of the aims of the Vidyajyoti faculty, it endeavours to publish the results of the research of its teachers and students.\n\nSome of Vidyajyoti’s publications are: Vidyajyoti Journal of Theological Research, Ave, Vachan Sudha and Tattvaviveka.\n\nThe Vidyajyoti Journal of Theological Research [VJTR], a monthly journal, reaches nearly 4000 subscribers all over the world, including most theological colleges of English-speaking countries. It covers areas of Christian theology and service, inter-religious dialogue, Indian theology, social concerns, and trends significant for religion in the modern times. The Journal was started in 1938 with the title \"The Clergy Monthly\". In 1975 it assumed the present title. It opens its pages to scholars from all over India that want to publish in the areas of concern for the journal.\n\nWebsite\n"}
