Born in Scotland, he was a playwright and actor before he converted to Islam in 1967 with the Imam of the Qarawiyyin Mosque in Fez, Morocco.\n\nIan Dallas was born in Scotland in 1930 of a Highland family. He travelled extensively in Greece, France and Italy. In 1963 he acted in Federico Fellini's film \"8½\" as \"Il partner della telepata\".\n\nAs-Sufi converted to Islam in 1967 in Fes, Morocco as \"Abdalqadir\", witnessed by Abdalkarim Daudi, the Imam Khatib of the Qarawiyyin Mosque, and Alal al-Fasi. He then joined the Darqawi order as a student of Muhammad ibn al-Habib. He travelled Morocco and Algeria with his Shaykh and was further instructed in Sufism by Sidi Hamud ibn al-Bashir of Blida and Sidi Fudul al-Huwari \"as-Sufi\" of Fes.\n\nAbdalqadir as-Sufi advocates adherence to the original legal school of Islam, the tradition of the people of Medina as recorded by Malik ibn Anas, since he considers this the primal formulation of Islamic society and a necessity for the re-establishment of Islam in the current age.\n\nAbdalqadir has been responsible for the establishment of the Ihsan Mosque in Norwich, England, the Great Mosque of Granada, and the Jumu'a Mosque of Cape Town\n\nAbdalqadir as-Sufi teaches that suicide terrorism is forbidden under Islamic law, that its psychological pattern stems from nihilism, and that it \"draws attention away from the fact that capitalism has failed.\" \nHe has stated that Britain is on \"the edge of terminal decline\" and that only Britain's Muslim population can \"revitalise this ancient realm\". He has written extensively on the importance of monarchy and personal rule.\nHe also regards the face-veil (or Niqab) of Muslim women as unislamic, describing it as an \"evil hinduisation of women\".\n\nIn 2006, he issued a fatwa, following a visit and speech given by then Pope Benedict XVI in Germany. In his \"Fatwa Concerning the Deliberations of Pope Benedict XVI in Germany\", he stated that \"in my opinion, Pope Benedict XVI is guilty of insulting the Messenger of Allah\". He was an early mentor of American Sufi scholar, Hamza Yusuf.\n\nIn February 2014 he distanced himself from the dinar and dirham movement, saying, \"So, I now dis-associate myself from all activity involving the Islamic gold dinar and silver dirham\". The other major condition of a correct Zakat, he argues, is the existence of personal rule, or Amirate, since Zakat is, by Qur'anic injunction, accepted rulings and established practice, taken by the leader, not given as a voluntary sadaqa.\n\nThe books he has written include:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1390280", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1390280", "title": "Aesthetic Realism", "text": "Aesthetic Realism\n\nAesthetic Realism is a philosophy founded by poet and critic Eli Siegel (1902–1978) in 1941. It is based on three core principles. First, the deepest desire of every person is to like the world on an honest or accurate basis. Second, the greatest danger for a person is to have contempt for the world and what is in it—contempt defined as the false importance or glory from the lessening of things not oneself. Third, the study of what makes for beauty in art is a guide for a good life: \"All beauty is a making one of opposites, and the making one of opposites is what we are going after in ourselves.\"\n\nThe philosophy is principally taught at the Aesthetic Realism Foundation, a nonprofit educational foundation based in SoHo, New York City, through a variety of lectures, classes in poetry, anthropology, art, music, and individual consultations.\n\nThe Foundation faced controversy for its assertion that men changed from homosexuality through study of this philosophy. In 1990, it stopped presentations and consultations on this subject, explaining that it did not want to be involved in the atmosphere of anger surrounding the issue, and saying that \"we do not want this matter, which is certainly not fundamental to Aesthetic Realism, to be used to obscure what Aesthetic Realism truly is: education of the largest, most cultural kind.\"\n\nAesthetic Realism is based on the idea that reality, or the world, has a structure that is beautiful. Siegel identified beauty as the making one, or unity, of opposites.\n\nIn Siegel’s critical theory, \"the resolution of conflict in self is like the making one of opposites in art.\" A successful novel, for example, composes opposites that people are trying to put together: oneness and manyness, intensity and calm, sameness and change. His studies led him to conclude that any successful work of art or music combines essential dualities. In the philosophy of Aesthetic Realism, Siegel developed this concept, writing that the arts and sciences all give evidence that reality has an aesthetic nature. He described the world as having a construction like art: it, too, is composed of opposites. In Siegel's eyes, freedom at one with order could be seen in an electron, a tree, or the solar system. Siegel reasoned, \"If...the structure of the world corresponds to the structure [of art], that much the world may be beautiful in the deepest sense of the word; and therefore can be liked.\"\n\nA primary concept of Aesthetic Realism is that the world can be liked honestly by seeing it as an aesthetic oneness of opposites. Further, a core teaching of Aesthetic Realism is that it is \"every person's deepest desire to like the world on an honest or accurate basis.\"\n\nHowever, Siegel recognized another competing desire which drives humans away from such an appreciation—the desire to have contempt for the world and what is in it, in order to make oneself feel more important. Siegel argued that when a person seeks self-esteem through contempt—\"the addition to self through the lessening of something else\"—he or she is unjust to people and things. Contempt, the philosophy maintains, may seem like a triumph, but ultimately results in self-dislike and mental distress, and lessens the capacity of one's mind to perceive and feel in the fullest manner. Siegel held that, in the extreme, contempt causes insanity.\n\nAesthetic Realism attests that one’s attitude to the world governs how all of life's components are seen: a friend, a spouse, a lover, a book, food, people of another skin tone. Accordingly, Aesthetic Realism argues, individuals have an ethical obligation to give full value to things and people, not devalue them in order to make oneself seem more important. Aesthetic Realism states that the conscious intention to be fair to the world and people is not only an ethical obligation, but the means of liking oneself.\n\nThe philosophy identifies contempt as the underlying cause of broader social problems as well: societal evils like racism and war arise from contempt for \"human beings placed differently from ourselves\" in terms of race, economic status, or nationality. Siegel stated that for centuries ill will has been the predominant purpose in humanity’s economic activities. The philosophy asserts that humanity cannot overcome its biggest problems until people cease to feel that \"the world’s failure or the failure of a[nother] person enhances one’s own life.\" Siegel stated that until good will rather than contempt is at the center of economics and in the thoughts of people, \"civilization has yet to begin.\"\n\nThe philosophic basis of Aesthetic Realism was set forth systematically by Siegel in two major texts. The first, \"Self and World: An Explanation of Aesthetic Realism, \" was written from 1941-3. Individual chapters, including \"Psychiatry, Economics, Aesthetics\" and \"The Aesthetic Method in Self-Conflict,\" were printed in 1946. The full text was published in 1981 (NY: Definition Press). His second text, \"Definitions, and Comment: Being a Description of the World,\" completed in 1945, defines 134 terms used in the philosophic thought of Aesthetic Realism, including Existence, Change, Fixity, Freedom, Thought, Will, Wonder, Fear, Hope, Negation, Reality, and Relation. The work was published in 1978-9 as a series in the journal \"The Right of Aesthetic Realism to Be Known.\"\n\nSiegel stated that ideas central to the philosophy of Aesthetic Realism were implicitly present in \"Hot Afternoons Have Been in Montana,\" the poem that brought him widespread fame when it was awarded \"The Nation\"'s esteemed poetry prize in 1925. The philosophic principle that individuality \"is\" relation, \"that the very self of a thing is its relations, its having-to-do-with other things,\" is in this poem. It begins with a hot, quiet afternoon in Montana and travels through time and space, showing that things usually thought of as separate and unrelated \"have a great deal to do with each other.\" These are lines near the end of the poem: <br>\n\nThe search for that which connects all branches of knowledge led Siegel to discover a key concept of Aesthetic Realism: \"The world, art, and self explain each other: each is the aesthetic oneness of opposites.\" Aesthetic Realism classes were scholarly and sought to demonstrate that poetry is related to the problems of everyday life. The viewpoint of Aesthetic Realism is that \"what makes a good poem is like what can make a good life.\" This contradicts the Freudian view of art as sublimation.\n\nSiegel defined poetry as \"the oneness of the permanent opposites in reality as seen by an individual.\" In Aesthetic Realism classes he explained that the greatest desire of a person is to put together opposites, as, in a good poem, \"emotion changes into logic: there is no rift between the two.\" He maintained that music distinguishes true poetry, whatever the language, period or style; the music of a poem shows the poet has honestly perceived opposites as one, and sincerely united personal feelings with the impersonal structure of the world. \"Poetry,\" he wrote, \"arises out of a like of the world so intense and wide that of itself, it is musical.\" Therefore, Aesthetic Realism teaches, even a poem that in substance seems to condemn the world, in its technique and music is praising the world, seeing it truly.\n\nIn thousands of Aesthetic Realism lectures, Siegel demonstrated the centrality of poetry to every aspect of life, including \"Poetry and Anger,\" \"Poetry and Love,\" \"Educational Method Is Poetic,\" \"Poetry and Time,\" \"Poetry, Money, and Good Will,\" \"A Poetic Technique of Parenthood,\" \"Poetry and History,\" and \"Hamlet Revisited; or, The Family Should Be Poetry.\" His students affirm that an important aspect of the philosophy continues to be the study of how a good poem has within it \"the composition, beauty, sanity we want in ourselves.\" This education, they assert, \"makes it possible for poetry to be, as Matthew Arnold said, a \"criticism of life.\"\n\nIn 1946, Siegel began giving weekly lectures at Steinway Hall in New York City, in which he presented what he first called Aesthetic Analysis (later, Aesthetic Realism), \"a philosophic way of seeing conflict in self and making this conflict clear to a person so that a person becomes more integrated and happier.\"\nFrom 1948 through 1977, Siegel continued teaching in his library at 67 Jane Street in Greenwich Village, where he also resided. Individuals studied Aesthetic Realism in classes such as the Ethical Study Conference, the Nevertheless Poetry Class, and classes in which Aesthetic Realism was discussed in relation to the arts and sciences, history, philosophy, national ethics, and world literature.\n\nAmong the earliest students of Aesthetic Realism were Chaim Koppelman (1920–2009), a painter, sculptor, printmaker, and founder of the printmaking department of the School of Visual Arts, and his wife, painter Dorothy Koppelman, who opened the Terrain Gallery in 1955, introducing Aesthetic Realism to the cultural scene of New York City with art exhibitions and public discussions of the Siegel Theory of Opposites in relation to painting, sculpture, photography, poetry, and later, music, theatre, and architecture.\"\n\nChaim Koppelman’s interviews of Roy Lichtenstein, Richard Anuszkiewicz, and Clayton Pond, in which these artists discussed the relevance of Aesthetic Realism and Eli Siegel’s Theory of Opposites to their work, are now part of the Smithsonian Archives of American Art. Artists began using Aesthetic Realism in writings about their fields, including Ralph Hattersley, editor of the photography journal \" Infinity\", and Nat Herz, author of articles in \" Modern Photography\" and of the \"Konica Pocket Handbook: An Introduction to Better Photography.\" \"Aesthetic Realism: We Have Been There\" (NY: Definition Press, 1969), a book of essays by working artists in the fields of painting, printmaking, photography, acting, and poetry, documents how the Siegel Theory of Opposites \"relates life to art and is basically a criterion for all branches of aesthetics\".\n\nSome artistic productions inspired by the philosophy were surrounded by controversy. A theatrical production of Ibsen’s \"Hedda Gabler\" by The Opposites Company of the Theatre, in which the title character was presented as \"essentially good\", in keeping with Siegel’s interpretation of the play, was highly praised in \"Time\" magazine, but severely criticized in \"The New York Times\", which also published Siegel’s response to the critics.\n\nThe Aesthetic Realism Theatre Company, composed of actors, singers and musicians, has appeared throughout the country in both musical performances and dramatic productions based on Siegel's lectures on Shakespeare, Moliere, Richard Brinsley Sheridan, Ibsen, Strindberg, Eugene O’Neill, George Kelly, Susan Glaspell, and others.\n\nThe not-for-profit Aesthetic Realism Foundation was established by Siegel's students in 1973. Located at 141 Greene Street in SoHo, New York, it is the primary location where the philosophy is taught, in public seminars and dramatic presentations, and in consultations for individuals. The Foundation offers classes in poetry, anthropology, art, music, acting, and singing, and classes for children.\n\nIn 1977, Siegel appointed Ellen Reiss chairperson for the teaching of Aesthetic Realism. Since that time, she has conducted professional classes for the Foundation's faculty. Herself an Aesthetic Realism consultant since 1971, Reiss also taught in the English departments of Queens and Hunter Colleges, City University of New York. She is a poet, editor, co-author (with Martha Baird) of \"The Williams-Siegel Documentary\" (Definition Press, 1970), and instructor of the course \"The Aesthetic Realism Explanation of Poetry\".\n\nSiegel died on November 8, 1978. His work is continued by Reiss, whose editorial commentaries on literature, life, and national ethics appear regularly in the periodical \"The Right of Aesthetic Realism to Be Known.\"\n\nA controversial aspect of the philosophy concerns the assertion that men and women could change from homosexuality through studying its principles. In 1946 writer and WW II veteran Sheldon Kranz (1919–1980) was the first man to report that he changed from homosexuality through Aesthetic Realism. Kranz said that as his way of seeing the world changed, his sexual preference also changed: from a homosexual orientation (he was no longer impelled toward men) to a heterosexual one that included love for a woman for the first time in his life. Kranz was married for 25 years (until his death) to Obie award-winning actress Anne Fielding.\n\nIn keeping with its general approach, Aesthetic Realism views homosexuality as a philosophic matter. A fundamental principle of the philosophy is that every person is in a fight between contempt for the world and respect for it. Siegel stated that this fight is present as well in homosexuality. He explained: \"All homosexuality arises from contempt of the world, not liking it sufficiently. This changes into a contempt for women.\"\nAccording to the philosophy, in the field of love and sex, a homosexual man prefers the sameness of another man while undervaluing the difference of the world that a woman represents. This undervaluing of difference is a form of contempt for the world; therefore, as a man learns how to like the world honestly, his attitude towards difference changes and this affects every area of his life, including sexual preference.\n\nBeginning in 1965 supporters of the philosophy began an effort to have press and media report on the change from homosexuality through Aesthetic Realism. In 1971 men (including Kranz) who said they changed through Aesthetic Realism were interviewed on New York City’s WNET Channel 13 \"Free Time\" show and the \"David Susskind Show\", which had a national syndication. The book \"The H Persuasion\", published that year, contained writing by Siegel detailing his premise about the cause of homosexuality, transcripts of Aesthetic Realism lessons, and narratives by men who said they changed, describing both why they changed and how. In response to requests from men and women wanting to study Aesthetic Realism, Siegel designated four consultation trios, one of which, Consultation With Three, was for the purpose of teaching men who wanted to change from homosexuality. In 1983, five other men who said they had changed from homosexuality were interviewed on the \"David Susskind Show.\" The transcript of this interview was published in the 1986 book \"The Aesthetic Realism of Eli Siegel and the Change from Homosexuality.\"\n\nWith the exception of a brief 1971 review calling \"The H Persuasion\" \"less a book than a collection of pietistic snippets by Believers,\" the \"New York Times\" never reported that men said they changed from homosexuality through Aesthetic Realism. Students of the philosophy who said they changed from homosexuality or in other large ways accused the press of unfairly withholding information valuable to the lives of people. In the 1970s they mounted an aggressive campaign of telephone calls, letters, ads, and vigils in front of various media offices and at the homes of editors. Many wore lapel buttons that read \"Victim of the Press\".\n\nIn 1973 the American Psychiatric Association declassified homosexuality as a mental disorder. In 1978, ads were placed in three major newspapers stating \"we have changed from homosexuality through our study of the Aesthetic Realism of Eli Siegel.\" They were signed by 50 men and women. With few exceptions, the press in general either ignored or dismissed the assertion of persons who said they changed.\n\nThe gay press and gay reporters were generally hostile to Aesthetic Realism. A 1982 \"Boston Globe\" article written by \"the first openly gay reporter\" on its staff, interviewed primarily gay therapists and then reported that the \"assertion\" of change through Aesthetic Realism was \"a claim staggering to psychiatrists and psychologists.\" About 250 people protested the article on the Boston Common. The \"Globe’s\" ombudsman later wrote in his column that the article was biased against Aesthetic Realism and that it contained \"strong, negative words without attribution\" and \"inaccuracies\".\n\nSome gay advocacy groups and gay activists presented Aesthetic Realism as \"anti-gay\", accusing the philosophy of offering a \"gay cure\" and expressing skepticism that homosexuality could or should change. Persons within the gay pride movement associated the desire of a man to change from homosexuality with a lack of pride in a gay identity, and saw Aesthetic Realism as biased against those living a gay lifestyle. The Aesthetic Realism Foundation stated unequivocally that it supported full, completely equal civil rights for homosexuals, including the right of a man or woman to live their life in the way they chose.\n\nIn one of his earliest essays, \"The Equality of Man\" (1923), Siegel criticized writers who were promoting eugenics. He argued that thus far in the history of the world, people have not had equal conditions of life, to bring out their potential abilities, and he asserted that if all men and women had \"an equal chance to use all the powers they had at birth, they would be equal.\"\n\nAccording to Aesthetic Realism, racism and prejudice of all kinds begin with the human inclination towards contempt, \"the addition to self through the lessening of something else.\" Students of the philosophy assert that the racist attitude is not inevitable, but can change if one learns to recognize and criticize contempt. In public forums, individuals of diverse nationalities and cultural backgrounds have described how, through study of Aesthetic Realism, their racism and prejudice changed, not into mere \"tolerance\" but into a respectful desire to know and to see that the feelings of another are \"as real, and as deep, as one’s own.\"\n\nOn an international level, proponents advocated the study of contempt and good will, as described by Aesthetic Realism, as \"The Only Answer to the Mideast Crisis,\" in a 1990 advertisement on the op-ed page of \"The New York Times.\" To oppose prejudice they recommend that persons of nations who are in conflict \"write a soliloquy of 500 words\" describing the feelings of a person in the opposing land.\n\nThe UN commissioned filmmaker Ken Kimmelman, a consultant on the faculty of the Aesthetic Realism Foundation, to make two anti-prejudice films: \"Asimbonanga,\" and \"Brushstrokes.\" Kimmelman credits Aesthetic Realism as his inspiration for these films, as well as his 1995 Emmy-award winning anti-prejudice public service film, \"The Heart Knows Better,\" based on, and including, a statement by Eli Siegel.\n\nAnother noted speaker on the subject of Aesthetic Realism and how it opposes prejudice and racism is Alice Bernstein, whose articles on the subject have been published in hundreds of papers throughout the country, including in her serialized column, \"Alice Bernstein & Friends.\" Mrs. Bernstein is the editor of \"The People of Clarendon County\" (Chicago: Third World Press, 2007), a book that includes a play by Ossie Davis re-discovered by Bernstein, together with historical documents, photographs, and essays about Aesthetic Realism, which she describes as \"the education that can end racism.\" The late Ossie Davis, noted actor and civil rights activist, stated: \"Alice Bernstein has dedicated her life to ending racism in this country. ...[She] is writing an introduction [to my play] based on what she has learned about people and history from Aesthetic Realism which she has studied for decades.\"\n\nA production of \"The People of Clarendon County—a Play by Ossie Davis, & the Answer to Racism,\" presenting Aesthetic Realism as the educational method that explains and changes prejudice and racism, was staged in the Congressional Auditorium of the US Capitol Visitor Center in Washington, DC on October 21, 2009, with introductory remarks given by House Majority Whip James E. Clyburn.\n\nThe organization has also been accused by some ex-students and cult researchers for operating as a cult. Some former and current students of the philosophy have responded in a website titled \"Countering the Lies,\" saying that the technique of the persons who want to discredit Aesthetic Realism is \"1) to find out what characteristics a cult is supposed to have and, 2) then say Aesthetic Realism has them (though of course it doesn't).\"\n\n\n"}

In particular, his research has focused on the development of neurotransmitter tracers for the evaluation of religiosity as well as neurological and psychiatric disorders including clinical depression, head injury, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease.\n\nHis book Principles of Neurotheology gives a basic understanding on the research done so far on Neurotheology.\n\nNewberg graduated from Haverford College in 1988 with a degree in chemistry and then received his medical degree in 1993 from the University of Pennsylvania. He then completed postgraduate training in Internal Medicine with a Residency at the Graduate Hospital from 1993 to 1996, and then did a Fellowship in Nuclear Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania Department of Radiology from 1996 to 1998. He was certified in Internal Medicine by the American Board of Internal Medicine in 1997 and certified in Nuclear Medicine by the American Board of Nuclear Medicine in 1998.\n\nBecause of his work in the intersection between religion and the brain, he has become an adjunct assistant professor in the Department of Religious Studies at the University of Pennsylvania. From 2005 to 2010 he was also the Director of the Center for Spirituality and the Mind.\n\nIn the early 1990s, he began to research the intersection between the brain and religious and spiritual experiences. In this work, also sometimes referred to as “neurotheology”, Newberg described the possible neurophysiological mechanisms associated with religious and spiritual experiences. His initial research included the use of functional brain imaging to study Buddhist meditators and Franciscan nuns in prayer. This work was eventually published in three books, \"The Mystical Mind\", \"Why God Won’t Go Away\", and \"Why We Believe What We Believe\".\n\nNewberg's research has been featured in \"Newsweek,\" the \"Los Angeles Times,\" and the \"New Scientist.\" He has been a guest speaker at the Forum at Grace Cathedral and appeared in the films \"What the Bleep Do We Know!?\" and \"Religulous\". He has continued to study religious and spiritual phenomena including topics related to forgiveness, meditation, prayer, spiritual development, morality, and belief. This work has been incorporated more recently into a new Center for Spirituality and the Mind at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nNewberg is the author of six books, and numerous articles on neuroimaging in neuropsychiatric disorders and also on neuroscience and religion. His book, \"Why God Won’t Go Away\", is a popularized account of this topic which describes some of the brain imaging studies and his theories regarding the nature of religious and spiritual experiences. \"Why We Believe What We Believe\", co-authored with Mark Robert Waldman (Executive MBA Faculty, Loyola Marymount University) describes the relationship between the brain and beliefs and also describes brain imaging studies of an atheist and individuals speaking in tongues (or glossolalia). A more recent book, \"How Enlightenment Changes Your Brain\", also co-authored with Waldman, is a scientific and practical look at how faith and meditation can enhance brain function. Steering away from the topic of faith, his latest book, co-authored with Mark Waldman, \"Words Can Change Your Brain\" describes how a research-based communication practice, \"compassionate communication\", can be used to improve brain health and interpersonal communication. The book and communication strategies are now part of the NeuroLeadership course offered in the EMBA program at Loyola Marymount University. The communication strategies have been documented and published in the \"Journal of Executive Education\".\n\nNewberg’s research has been criticized from two main perspectives. From the religious perspective, concerns have been raised that the study of practices such as meditation does not necessarily extrapolate to the broader array of religious and spiritual phenomena. However, Newberg tends to agree with this concern and has argued that future studies are needed to elucidate the more complex elements of religious and spiritual phenomena. Newberg has maintained that science and brain imaging studies are only tools to evaluate the brain during such experiences but do not necessarily negate such experiences. Newberg has argued that the integration of science and religion is critical for a better understanding of how human beings think and behave in a global context.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "40098152", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40098152", "title": "Anna Brackett", "text": "Anna Brackett\n\nAnna Brackett (1836–1911) was a female philosopher known for being a translator, feminist, and an educator. She is known for being one of the most important educators among women, but her philosophical achievements are oftentimes overlooked. She translated Karl Rosenkranz's \"Pedagogics as a System\" and wrote \"The Education of American Girls\", a response to arguments against the coeducation of males and females.\n\nAnna Callender Brackett was born May 21, 1836 to Samuel and Caroline Brackett and the oldest of five children. Her father was a dry goods merchant on Milk Street in Boston, Massachusetts, and the family lived in Somerville. Brackett attended private and public schools in Boston and Somerville and Abbot Academy. In 1856 she graduated from the state teaching school in Framingham, Massachusetts, now known at Framingham State University. She served as a teacher in East Brookfield, Massachusetts and then as an assistant principal in the teaching school in Framingham. In 1861, Anna became vice principal in Charleston, South Carolina. At the start of the Civil War, she was forced to leave for New Orleans and then St. Louis where she met with the St. Louis Hegelians and later published the first English translation of several philosophical works. After briefly returning to Cambridge, Massachusetts and teaching at the high school there, she then went back to St. Louis.\n\nOne of her biggest accomplishments came in 1863 when she was appointed principal of the St. Louis Normal School (Harris-Stowe State College), the first female principal of secondary school in the United States. During her tenure, Brackett worked to ensure female students had access to higher education and liberal studies as preparation for professional teaching. She made two proposals to the Board of Education that were eventually adopted. The first proposal was an age requirement for entrance to the school. Second, there should be an entrance exam for admission to the St. Louis Normal School. In 1872 Anna Brackett resigned as principal after there were changes in the curriculum that went against her beliefs. She moved to New York City with her domestic partner, Ida M. Eliot, the daughter of Congressman Thomas D. Eliot. The pair adopted their first daughter, Hope, in 1873 and their second daughter, Bertha, in 1875. In New York, Brackett started The Brackett School for Girls, located at 9 West 39th Street, and she hired notable female teachers such as Mary Mitchell Birchall, the first woman to receive a bachelor's degree from a New England college. Among Brackett's pupils was Ruth Sawyer, in whose Newbery Award-winning semi-autobiographical children's novel, \"Roller Skates\", Brackett is remembered fondly as an imposing but beloved educator. Anna Brackett retired from teaching in 1894 and died in 1911. Brackett's brother, George, a Harvard graduate, and her two sisters ran a school in Brooklyn, New York. A biography of Brackett was published upon her death, entitled: Anna C. Brackett, in Memoriam, MDCCCXXXVI-MDCCCCXI: An Appreciation (1915).\n\nIn 1874, Brackett published \"The Education of American Girls\", an essay that applied Rosenkranz's theory of education to girls. In this essay, Brackett observes that a young woman must be guided through two steps of the learning process, the \"perceptive stage\" and \"conceptual stage.\" In her opinion, no girl can excel in life without attaining both of these steps. Her thoughts were that an education which merely stops at the conceptual stage is not adequate. If undereducated and untrained in abstract thinking, women are at risk to becoming arbitrary if they were to become active in public affairs. Brackett made the point that if women are confined only to the family circle and taking care of the home, they will not be able to fully develop morally and intellectually. This would cause girls to lose their chance at asserting their independence or compete with others and gain the confidence needed to be successful in the public realm. Men, however, automatically enter into the public realm where they become independent persons, separate from the family. Brackett makes the argument that without being able to grow outside their homes, women face two dangers. The first danger is they grow to be ineffective in the public realm and perpetuate the stereotype of the \"incompetent woman.\" The second danger is to a woman's well-being, risking becoming vulnerable to exploitation by men. This essay was the foundation to Brackett's belief that coeducation is important and necessary in the American education system.\n\nBrackett wrote extensively regarding education and philosophy and published writings in Harper's Magazine and other well known publications. She also published \"The Education of American Girls\" and served as an editor of New England Journal of Education.\n\n"}

A political figure of May 1968 in France, he was the disciple and last personal secretary of Jean-Paul Sartre from 1974 to 1980.\nAlong with him, he helped founding the French newspaper \"Libération\" in 1972.\n\nAfter having encountered the Jewish philosophy of Emmanuel Levinas in 1978, he operated a return to tradition. He then founded the Institut d'études lévinassiennes in Jerusalem with Alain Finkielkraut and Bernard-Henri Lévy.\n\nBenny Lévy is known for his unusual itinerary from Maoism to Judaism, or \"from Mao to Moses\", which was also followed by a few other philosophers of his generation.\n\nBorn in Egypt, Benny Lévy grew up without experiencing Judaism as a faith. He left Egypt after the Suez Crisis of 1956 and immigrated to Belgium then France with his family. His elder half-brother, Eddy Lévy, stayed in Egypt, converted to Islam in 1956 and changed his name to Adil Rifaat. The historian of mathematics Tony Lévy is his brother.\n\nBenny Lévy soon proved to be a brilliant student and completed his studies at the École Normale Supérieure, learning under such key intellectual figures as Marxist philosopher Louis Althusser and Jacques Derrida, founder of deconstruction. He entered the Union des étudiants communistes (UEC), a student communist group, and then at his foundation in 1966 the Maoist Union des jeunesses communistes marxistes-léninistes (UJC - ml). He became one of the main leader of this latter organization after Robert Linhart. Benny Lévy was an important figure during the May 68 Student Revolt. After these events, the direction of the UJC-ml was put in minority, and founded the Maoist Gauche prolétarienne (GP, Proletarian Left). Taking the pseudonym of Pierre Victor, Benny Lévy was one of its main leaders, along with Alain Geismar.\n\nAs editor of the Maoist newspaper \"La Cause du Peuple\" (The Cause of the People), he was arrested repeatedly by the French police, who were determined to suppress the unrest. By 1970, with arrests occurring more frequently, Lévy and the other editors decided to turn to Jean-Paul Sartre, whom they knew benefited from protection to police harassment. Sartre responded by adding his name to the list of editors, and the arrests indeed stopped. It was then discovered by the government that the proletarian leftwing leader Pierre Victor was, in fact, a stateless refugee. The passport given to him by the United Nations was confiscated, and he was ordered to appear at the local police station once every two weeks with his relatives and a lawyer. \nThe organisation was outlawed in 1970. As stateless and leader of an outlawed organisation, Benni Lévy was forced to clandestinity until 1973, date of the auto-dissolving of the GP. By this point, however, Lévy had developed a very amicable relationship with Sartre, who decided to make him his protégé and asked him to serve as his personal secretary, which he remained from September 1974 till Sartre's death in 1980. Sartre interceded to President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, and Lévy was naturalized.\n\nDuring these six years, Lévy worked with Sartre, and the two men produced four books until Sartre's death. While working with Sartre, Lévy began to discover Judaism, initially through his research into the Kabbalah, which he conducted with his mentor. Their work together created a stir among the circle that surrounded Sartre, because Sartre had begun introducing new ideas and terms that evoked religious and, more specifically, Jewish concepts, such as Redemption and Messianism. Some, including Simone de Beauvoir began accusing Lévy of brainwashing Sartre and faking his writings. After this Ms de Beauvoir and Mr Levy were no longer on speaking terms. Two months before his death, Sartre responded to these critics, claiming that he had indeed abandoned some of his earlier ideas. In 1978, Lévy encountered Levinas, and started learning Hebrew and beginning Talmudic studies.\n\nStarting in 1975, he taught at the University of Paris-VII, founded in the wake of May 68, before obtaining a doctorate in philosophy at the Sorbonne in 1985, and a habilitation to direct researches (HDR) in philosophy in 1998, under the direction of Dominique Lecourt at Paris-VII.\n\nBenny Lévy embraced Jewish Orthodoxy, and began to study in a yeshiva in Strasbourg. He finally immigrated to Israel in 1997, where he established the Institut d'études lévinassiennes in Jerusalem along with Bernard-Henri Lévy and Alain Finkielkraut, and learned with Rabbi Moshe Shapira. He died suddenly during the holiday of Sukkot in 2003. In \"Etre Juif\", he wrote:\n\nTo be Jewish. To be, in an absolutely singular manner... a thought of the Return. The Return to the Sinaï... The thought of the Return (\"la pensée du Retour\") requires a critique of the atheology of the modern jew . Theology of the silence of God after Auschwitz, critique of theodicy, finally return to the notion of absolute Evil, these are the points through which one must pass in a critical manner. In this sense, this book addresses itself at any man, insofar as he is still sensible to the question of the origin of evil.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "160660", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=160660", "title": "Bogomilism", "text": "Bogomilism\n\nBogomilism (, ) was a Christian neo-Gnostic or dualist sect founded in the First Bulgarian Empire by the priest Bogomil during the reign of Tsar Peter I in the 10th century. It most probably arose in what is today the region of Macedonia as a response to the social stratification that occurred with the introduction of feudalism and as a form of political movement and opposition to the Bulgarian state and the church.\n\nThe Bogomils called for a return to what they considered to be early spiritual teaching, rejecting the ecclesiastical hierarchy, and their primary political tendencies were resistance to the state and church authorities. This helped the movement spread quickly in the Balkans, gradually expanding throughout the Byzantine Empire and later reaching Kievan Rus', Bosnia (Bosnian Church), Dalmatia, Serbia, Italy, and France (Cathars).\n\nThe Bogomils were dualists or Gnostics in that they believed in a world within the body and a world outside the body. They did not use the Christian cross, nor build churches, as they revered their gifted form and considered their body to be the temple. This gave rise to many forms of practice to cleanse oneself through purging, fasting, celebrating and dancing.\n\nThe term \"Bogomil\" in free translation means \"dear to God\", and is a compound of the Slavic words for \"god\" (Common Slavic: *bogъ) and \"dear\" (Common Slavic: *milъ). It may be also a translation of the Greek name \"Theophilos\", literally \"dear to God; loved by the gods,\" from \"theos\" \"god\" + \"philos\" \"loved, beloved\". It is difficult to ascertain whether the name was taken from the reputed founder of that movement, the priest Bogomil (Bulgarian: Богомил), or whether he assumed that name after it had been given to the sect itself. The word is an Old Church Slavonic calque of \"Massaliani\", the Syriac name of the sect corresponding to the Greek Euchites. The Bogomils are identified with the Messalians in Slavonic documents from the 13th century.\n\nThe members are referred to as \"Babuni\" in Church Slavonic documents, which originally meant \"superstition; superstitious person\" (Common Slavic \"*babonъ, *babunъ *babona\"). Toponyms which retain the name include the river Babuna, the mountain Babuna, the Bogomila Waterfall and village Bogomila, all in the region of Azot today in central Republic of Macedonia, suggesting that the movement was very active in the region.\n\nMuch of their literature has been lost or destroyed by the contemporary Christian Churches. The earliest description of the Bogomils is in a letter from Patriarch Theophylact of Bulgaria to Tsar Peter of Bulgaria, and the main source of doctrinal information is the work of Euthymius Zigabenus, who says that they believe that God created man's soul but matter was the invention of Satan, God's older son, who in seducing Eve lost his creative power. Concerning the Bogomils, something can be gathered from the polemic \"Against the Newly-Appeared Heresy of the Bogomils\" written in Slavonic by Cosmas the Priest, a 10th-century Bulgarian official. The old Slavonic lists of forbidden books of the 15th and 16th century also give us a clue to the discovery of this heretical literature and of the means the Bogomils employed to carry on their teachings. Much may also be learned from the doctrines of the numerous variations of Bogomilism which spread in Medieval Kievan Rus' after the 11th century.\n\nOne of the earliest Christian dualist \"heresies\", Marcionism, originated in eastern Anatolia. The church Marcion himself established, appeared to die out around the 5th century, although similarities between Marcionism and Paulicianism, a sect in the same geographical area, indicate that Marcionist elements may have survived. Paulicianism began in the mid-7th century, when Constantine of Mananalis, basing his message solely on the New Testament, began to teach that there were two gods: a good god who had made men's souls, and an evil god who had created the entire physical universe including the human body. His followers, who became known as Paulicians, were not marked by extreme deviance in lifestyle compared to contemporaries, despite their belief that the world was evil, and were renowned as good fighting men.\n\nIn 970 the Byzantine emperor John I Tzimiskes transplanted 200,000 Armenian Paulicians to Europe and settled them in the neighbourhood of Philippopolis (today's Plovdiv in Thrace). Under Byzantine and then later Ottoman rule, the Armenian Paulicians lived in relative safety in their ancient stronghold near Philippopolis, and further northward. Linguistically, they were assimilated into the Bulgarians, by whom they were called \"pavlikiani\" (the Byzantine Greek word for Paulician). In 1650, the Roman Catholic Church gathered them into its fold. Fourteen villages near Nicopolis, in Moesia, embraced Catholicism, as well as the villages around Philippopolis. A colony of Paulicians in the Wallachian village of near Bucharest also followed the example of their brethren across the Danube.\n\nThe Gnostic social-religious movement and doctrine originated in the time of Peter I of Bulgaria (927–969), alleged in the modern day to be a reaction against state and clerical oppression of the Byzantine church. In spite of all measures of repression, it remained strong and popular until the fall of the Second Bulgarian Empire in the end of the 14th century. Bogomilism was an outcome of many factors that had arisen in the beginning of the 10th century, most probably in the region of Macedonia. It was also strongly influenced by the Paulicians who had been driven out of Armenia.\n\nThe Slavonic sources are unanimous on the point that Bogomil's teaching was Manichaean. A \"Synodikon\" from the year 1210 adds the names of his pupils or \"apostles\", Mihail, Todur, Dobri, Stefan, Vasilie and Peter. Zealous missionaries carried their doctrines far and wide. In 1004, scarcely 25 years after the introduction of Christianity into Kievan Rus, we hear of a priest Adrian teaching the same doctrines as the Bogomils. He was imprisoned by Leontius, Bishop of Kiev. In 1125, the Church in the south of Rus had to combat another heresiarch named Dmitri. The Church in Bulgaria also tried to extirpate Bogomilism. Several thousand went in the army of Alexios I Komnenos against the Norman, Robert Guiscard; but, deserting the emperor, many of them (1085) were thrown into prison. Efforts were again put forth for their conversion; and for the converts the new city of Alexiopolis was built, opposite Philippopolis. When the Crusaders took Constantinople (1204), they found some Paulicians, whom the historian Geoffrey of Villehardouin calls Popelicans.\n\nThe Legend of Saint Gerard discloses that followers of Bulgarian Bogomilism were present during the early 11th century in Ahtum's realm, which comprised present day Banat. They invoked Archangel Uriel, whose name is common in amulets and magic rituals.\n\nThe Bogomils spread westwards and settled in Serbia, where they were to be known as Babuns (\"Babuni\"). At the end of the 12th century Serbian Grand Prince Stefan Nemanja and the Serbian council deemed Bogomilism a heresy, and expelled them from the country. Large numbers took refuge in Bosnia and Dalmatia where they were known under the name of Patarenes (\"Patareni\").\n\nProviding refuge to heretics, including bogomils, was a recurrent pretext for Hungarian rulers to declare crusades against Bosnia and extend their influence in the region. A first Hungarian complaint to the Pope was averted by the public abjuration of the Bosnian ruler Ban Kulin in 1203. A second Hungarian crusade against Bosnia on bogomil heresy pretext was launched in 1225, but failed. In 1254, rebelling against the Papal order to accept a Hungarian bishop, the Bosnian Church chose the schism. In the following centuries, the Bosnian Church (autonomous from Rome but mainly following Catholic doctrine) and the heretic sect of the bogomils came to be identified with each other, due to the scarcity of documents after the Ottoman conquest.\n\nIn 1203, Pope Innocent III, with the aid of the King of Hungary, forced an agreement of Kulin to acknowledge Papal authority and religion: in practice this was ignored. On the death of Kulin in 1216 a mission was sent to convert Bosnia to Rome but failed. In 1234, the Catholic Bishop of Bosnia was removed by Pope Gregory IX for allowing heretical practices. In addition, Gregory called on the Hungarian king to crusade against the heretics. However, Bosnian nobles were able to expel the Hungarians.\n\nIn 1252, Pope Innocent IV decided to put Bosnia's bishop under the Hungarian Kalocsa jurisdiction. Such decision provoked the schism of the Bosnian Christians, who refused to submit to the Hungarians and broke off their relations with Rome. In that way, an autonomous Bosnian Church came into being, in which some later saw a Bogomil or Cathar Church, while in reality no trace of bogomilism, Catharism or dualism can be found in the original documents of the Bosnian Christians.\n\nIt was not until Pope Nicholas' Bull \"Prae cunctis\" in 1291 that the Franciscans-led inquisition was imposed on Bosnia. The Inquisition reported of the existence of a dualist sect in Bosnia in the late 15th century and called them \"Bosnian heretics\", but this sect was most likely not the same as the Bosnian Church.\n\nBogomilism was eradicated in Bulgaria and Byzantium in the 13th century, but survived in Bosnia and Herzegovina until the Ottoman Empire gained control of the region in 1463. Both Catholics and Orthodox persecuted the Bogomils as heretics. The early pressures by its Catholic and Orthodox neighbours drew Bosnia to Bogomilism. Later, with the introduction of Ottoman rule, Bosnians were often more likely to convert to Islam since they were not friends of either the Roman Catholic or Serb Orthodox churches.\n\nFrom Bosnia, their influence extended into Italy (Piedmont). The Hungarians undertook many crusades against the heretics in Bosnia, but towards the close of the 15th century, the conquest of that country by the Turks put an end to their persecution. Few or no remnants of Bogomilism have survived in Bosnia. The Ritual in Slavonic written by the Bosnian Radoslav, and published in vol. xv. of the \"Starine of the South Slavonic Academy at Agram\", shows great resemblance to the Cathar ritual published by Cunitz, 1853.\n\nIn the 18th century, the Paulician people from around Nicopolis were persecuted by the Turks, presumably on religious grounds, and a good part of them fled across the Danube and settled in the Banat region that was part of the Kingdom of Hungary at the time, and became known as Banat Bulgarians. There are still over ten thousand Banat Bulgarians in Banat today in the villages of Dudeştii Vechi, Vinga, Breştea and also in the city of Timişoara, with a few in Arad; however, they no longer practice Bogomilism, having converted to Roman Catholicism. There are also a few villages of Paulicians in the Serbian part of Banat, especially the villages of Ivanovo and Belo Blato, near Pančevo.\n\nThe gradual Christianization of the Bulgarian population, the fact that the service was initially practiced in Greek, which only the elite knew, resulted in a low level of understanding of the religion among the peasantry. Due to the constant wars during the time of Simeon I, the lands near the Byzantine border (Thrace) were devastated, and the people living there were left without occupation. The constant change of authority over these lands, and the higher taxes during the time of Tsar Peter I, gave birth to a great social discontent at the beginning of the 10th century. Moreover, the corruption of the church as an institution, led to grave disappointment among its recently converted flock.\n\nThe existence of older Christian heresies in the Bulgarian lands (Manichaeism and Paulicianism), which were considered very dualistic, influenced the Bogomil movement. Manichaeism's origin is related to Zoroastrianism; that is why Bogomilism is sometimes indirectly connected to Zoroastrianism in the sense of its duality.\n\nSome historians claim that tsar Samuil of Bulgaria and in particular his son Gavril Radomir supported the movement. The core of Bulgarian empire then corresponded to the region where the Bogomils were most active. Most probably, as Samuil revolted against the Byzantine Empire, he relied on the popular support of the movement. There are no sources of Bogomil persecution during his reign (976–1014).\n\nPossible source texts for Bogomil doctrine include:\n\nThe possible Bogomil use of pseudepigraphic texts:\n\nThe Bogomils had a system of altered traditional orthodox beliefs and rituals. The essence behind their teaching was a dualistic doctrine that the world is divided by God and Satan (good and evil). God rules the spiritual part of the world, and Satan the material. They regarded every material being to be the work of Satan. They also opposed established forms of government and church as alike to anarchism (see Christian anarchism).\n\nFrom the imperfect and conflicting data that is available, one positive result can be gathered that the Bogomils were both Adoptionists and Manichaeans. They had accepted the teaching of Paul of Samosata, though at a later period the name of Paul was believed to be that of the Apostle; and they were not quite free from the Dualistic principle of the Gnostics, at a later period too much identified with the teaching of Mani, by Photius, Petrus Siculus, and other authors. They rejected the Christianity of the Orthodox churches and did not accept the docetic teaching of some of the other sects.\n\nThe Bogomils taught that God had two sons, the elder Satanail and the younger Michael. The elder son rebelled against the father and became the evil spirit. After his fall, he created the lower heavens and the Earth and tried in vain to create man; in the end, he had to appeal to God for the Spirit. After creation, Adam was allowed to till the ground on condition that he sold himself and his posterity to the owner of the Earth. Then, Michael was sent in the form of a man; he became identified with Jesus and was \"elected\" by God after the baptism in the Jordan. When the Holy Ghost (again Michael) appeared in the shape of the dove, Jesus received power to break the covenant in the form of a clay tablet (\"hierographon\") held by Satanail from Adam. He had now become the angel Michael in a human form; as such he vanquished Satanail, and deprived him of the termination -\"il\" = God, in which his power resided. Satanail was thus transformed into Satan. Through his machinations the crucifixion took place, and Satan was the originator of the whole Orthodox community with its churches, vestments, ceremonies, sacraments and fasts, with its monks and priests. This world being the work of Satan, the perfect must eschew any and every excess of its pleasure. But the Bogomils did not go so far as to recommend asceticism.\n\nThey held the \"Lord's Prayer\" in high respect as the most potent weapon against Satan, and had a number of conjurations against \"evil spirits\". Each community had its own twelve \"apostles\", and women could be raised to the rank of \"elect\". The Bogomils wore garments like mendicant friars and were known as keen missionaries, travelling far and wide to propagate their doctrines. Healing the sick and exorcising the evil spirit, they traversed different countries and spread their apocryphal literature along with some of the books of the Old Testament, deeply influencing the religious spirit of the nations and preparing them for the Reformation. They accepted the four Gospels, fourteen Epistles of Paul, the three Epistles of John, James, Jude, and an Epistle to the Laodiceans, which they professed to have. They sowed the seeds of a rich, popular religious literature in the East as well as the West. The Historiated Bible, the Letter from Heaven, the Wanderings through Heaven and Hell, the numerous Adam and Cross legends, the religious poems of the \"Kalēki perehozhie\" and other similar productions owe their dissemination to a large extent to the activity of the Bogomils of Bulgaria, and their successors in other lands.\n\nFor Bogomils \"the Logos was not the Second Person of the Blessed Trinity, the Eternal Word incarnate, but merely the spoken word of God, shown in the oral teaching of Christ\". Although Bogomils regarded themselves as \"Trinitarian\", anathemas against Bogomils (circa 1027) charge Bogomils with rejection of the Trinity.\n\nThe essence of Bogomilism is the duality in the creation of the world. This is why it is considered a heresy by the Catholic Church. Bogomils explained the earthly sinful corporeal life as a creation of Satan, an angel that was sent to Earth. Due to this duality, the church believes that their doctrine undervalues everything that is created with materialistic and governmental goals and further claims that the doctrine does not come from the soul, the only divine possession of the human. Its followers refused to pay taxes, to work in serfdom, or to fight in conquering wars. They ignored the feudal social system, which was interpreted by their enemies as suggesting disorder if not the destruction of the state and church.\n\nKarp Strigolnik, who in the 14th century preached the doctrine in Novgorod, explained that St. Paul had taught that simpleminded men should instruct one another; therefore they elected their \"teachers\" from among themselves to be their spiritual guides, and had no special priests. There is a tradition that the Bogomils taught that prayers were to be said in private houses, not in separate buildings such as churches. Ordination was conferred by the congregation and not by any specially appointed minister. The congregation were the \"elect\", and each member could obtain the perfection of Christ and become a Christ or \"Chlist\". Marriage was not a sacrament. Bogomils refused to fast on Mondays and Fridays, and they rejected monasticism. They declared Christ to be the Son of God only through grace like other prophets, and that the bread and wine of the eucharist were not physically transformed into flesh and blood; that the last judgement would be executed by God and not by Jesus; that the images and the cross were idols and the veneration of saints and relics idolatry.\n\nThese doctrines have survived in the great Russian sects, and can be traced back to the teachings and practice of the Bogomils. But in addition to these doctrines of an adoptionist origin, they held the Manichaean dualistic conception of the origin of the world. This has been partly preserved in some of their literary remains, and has taken deep root in the beliefs and traditions of Balkan nations with substantial Bogomil followings. The chief literature of all the heretical sects throughout the ages has been that of apocryphal Biblical narratives, and the popes Jeremiah or Bogumil are directly mentioned as authors of such forbidden books \"which no orthodox dare read\". Though these writings are mostly of the same origin as those from the older lists of apocryphal books, they underwent a modification at the hands of their Bogomil editors, so as to be useful for the propagation of their own specific doctrines.\n\nIn its most simple and attractive form—invested with the authority of the reputed holy author—their account of the creation of the world and of man, the origin of sin and redemption, the history of the Cross, and the disputes between body and soul, right and wrong, heaven and hell, were embodied either in \"Historiated Bibles\" (Paleya) or in special dialogues held between Christ and his disciples, or between renowned Fathers of the Church who expounded these views in a simple manner adapted to the understanding of the people (Lucidaria).\n\nThe Bogomils were the connecting link between the so-called heretical sects of the East and those of the West. They were, moreover, the most active agents in disseminating such teachings in Kievan Rus' and among all the nations of Europe. In the 12th and 13th century, the Bogomils were already known in the West as \"Cathars\" or in other places as \"Bulgari\", i.e. Bulgarians (българи). In 1207 the \"Bulgarorum heresis\" is mentioned. In 1223 the Albigenses are declared to be the local Bougres, and in the same period mention is made of the \"Pope of the Albigenses who resided within the confines of Bulgaria\" (see also Nicetas, Bogomil bishop). The Cathars and Patarenes, the Waldenses, the Anabaptists, and in Russia the Strigolniki, and Spiritual Christians, have all at different times been either identified with the Bogomils or closely connected with them, even though several of these are unrelated and are not dualist.\n\nConsiderable scholarly debate has arisen about the exact relationship between dualist heresies that arose in different places and centuries across medieval Europe, questioning whether it was indeed a single movement or belief system which was spread from one region to the next, or if multiple heretical movements arose independently in different parts of Europe. Furthering the confusion is that the medieval sources themselves, such as the 13th century papal Inquisition in France, would often simply assume that dualistic heresies were directly connected to previous heretical movements in different regions. Inquistors often described 13th century Cathars as a direct outgrowth of surviving Manichean dualists from previous centuries—though by the same logic, Inquisitors who encountered pagan religions in the fringes of Europe (Celtic lands, or in the Baltic Crusades) would directly accuse non-Christians of worshiping \"Apollo and Mercury\", simply applying previous terms and rhetoric to new contexts in which they didn't accurately apply. Thus medieval scholarship is divided over whether the \"Cathars\" actually were an offshoot of the \"Bogomils\", or if the 13th century Inquisition itself simply mistook \"Cathars\" for \"Bogomils\".\n\nIn \"Foucault's Pendulum\", a novel by the Italian philosopher and writer Umberto Eco, the plot concerning a widespread secret and mystic conspiracy has its ground in the disappearance of the Bogomils after the fall of the Second Bulgarian Empire under the rule of the Ottoman Empire.\n\n\"The Secret Book\" is a Macedonian feature film combining the detective, thriller and conspiracy fiction genres, based on a fictional story of the quest for the original Slavic language \"Secret Book\", written by the Bogomils in Bulgaria and carried to Western Europe during the Middle Ages.\n\nA French and consequently an English word emerged based on twisted perceptions of the Bogomils by the Catholic Church. The words \"bouguer\" and \"buggery\" emerged, by way of the word \"bougre\" in French, from the Latin \"Bulgarus\" (Bulgarian). \"Buggery\" first appears in English in 1330 with the sense \"abominable heresy\", though \"bugger\" in a sexual sense is not recorded until 1555.\nThe \"Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology\" quotes a similar form—\"bowgard\" (and \"bouguer\"), but claims that the Bulgarians were heretics \"as belonging to the Greek Church, sp. Albigensian\". Webster's Third New International Dictionary, gives the only meaning of the word \"bugger\" as sodomite, \"from the adherence of the Bulgarians to the Eastern Church considered heretical\"..\n\nBogomil Cove on Rugged Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named after Priest Bogomil.\n\nThe Bogomils make a significant part in the Thomas Pynchon novel, Against the Day, when Cyprian Lakewood becomes a postulate and gives up his life of sodomitic servitude as a spy.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Washington had a background in environmental science prior to authoring the work, and Cook was educated in physics and founded the website Skeptical Science which compiles peer-reviewed evidence of global warming. The book was first published in hardcover and paperback formats in 2011 by Earthscan, a division of Routledge.\n\nThe book presents an in-depth analysis and refutation of climate change denial, going over several arguments point-by-point and disproving them with peer-reviewed evidence from the scientific consensus for climate change. The authors assert that those denying climate change engage in tactics including cherry picking data purported to support their specific viewpoints, and attacking the integrity of climate scientists. They use social science theory to examine the phenomenon of climate change denial in the wider public, and call this phenomenon a form of pathology.\n\nThe book traces financial support for climate change denial to the fossil fuel industry, asserting these companies have attempted to influence public opinion on the matter. Washington and Cook write that politicians have a tendency to use weasel words as part of a propaganda tactic through use of spin, as a way to deflect public interest away from climate change and remain passive on the issue. The authors conclude that if the public ceased engaging in denial, the problem of climate change could be realistically addressed.\n\nFor his research on the book, and efforts in communicating the essence of climate change science to the general public, John Cook won the 2011 Australian Museum Eureka Prize for Advancement of Climate Change Knowledge. \"Climate Change Denial\" received a positive reception in reviews from publications including: \"The Ecologist\", \"ECOS\" magazine, academic journal \"Natures Sciences Sociétés\", the journal \"Education\" published by the New South Wales Teachers Federation. An article in \"The New American\" was critical, describing the labels of \"deniers\" and \"denialists\" as cruel and forms of character assassination.\n\nThe book was coauthored by Australian environmental science researchers Haydn Washington and John Cook. Washington worked for over 30 years as an environmental scientist prior to writing the book. His previously published books on the subject of environmental science include: \"Ecosolutions\" (1991), \"A Sense of Wonder\" (2002), and \"The Wilderness Knot\" (2009).

Prior to his work on the book, Cook founded the website Skeptical Science, which compiles peer-reviewed evidence of climate change. He placed on the site the most common assertions made by individuals arguing against the scientific consensus for climate change, with evidence to refute each point they made. After the publication of \"Climate Change Denial: Heads in the Sand\", Cook coauthored another book on the subject, \"Climate Change Science: A Modern Synthesis: Volume 1 – The Physical Climate\" (2013). In 2015, Cook served as the climate communication fellow at the University of Queensland.\n\n\"Climate Change Denial: Heads in the Sand\" was first published in 2011 by Earthscan, a division of Routledge.

The book was made available via Kindle by Amazon.com in May 2013.\n\n\"Climate Change Denial: Heads in the Sand\" presents a detailed analysis and refutation of climate change denial. In her foreword to the book, Naomi Oreskes writes that people fall victim to the phenomenon of denial due to feeling frightened. The book examines several arguments against global warming, and uses peer-reviewed evidence from the scientific consensus to back-up rationale for disputing the validity of each argument. The methodology of those denying climate change is assessed, including: cherry picking data purporting to support their specific viewpoints, maintaining a high bar for evidence of climate change by those denying it, and criticism of the values of climate scientists themselves. The book puts forth an explanation why certain individuals, and the wider public, have a tendency to deny the scientific consensus for climate change.\n\nThe authors discuss the broader concept of denial using social science theory, noting its occurrence appears in society when individuals are frightened or ashamed of their actions. They write that these motivations, when expanded from an individual to wider society, present themselves as a form of disease. The book identifies climate change denial itself as a pathology afflicting the culture of the planet. The authors lament that an inverse relationship exists between an increasing scientific consensus regarding climate change, and a simultaneous increase in denial within the greater public about the same issue.\n\nThe book identifies a corporate underpinning influencing public opinion by way of companies which derive profit from the fossil fuel industry. Washington and Cook write that politicians often use weasel words as a form of spin and propaganda, in order to act as if they are going to do something about climate change, while in actuality remaining passive on the issue. The authors go on to identify a greater level of denial — within the wider public itself. They argue that society enables denial of climate science through inaction and resistance to the scientific consensus. The authors conclude that if the public stopped denying climate change, the problem itself could realistically be significantly addressed.\n\nThe book's coauthor John Cook won the 2011 Eureka Prize for Advancement of Climate Change Knowledge, awarded by the New South Wales Government as part of the Australian Museum Eureka Prizes, and was honoured for his role in communicating the essence of climate change science to the general public. Director of the University of Queensland Global Change Institute, Professor Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, cited Cook's research and authorship of \"Climate Change Denial: Heads in the Sand\" as the rationale behind him winning the award.\n\n\"The Ecologist\" reviewed the book and described it as: \"well researched and painstakingly footnoted\". The review concluded: \"Climate Change Denial\" is a wise and timely book. ... It deserves an audience\". Writing for \"ECOS\" magazine, Mary-Lou Considine wrote that the book \"dissects objections to the peer-reviewed science\" in \"forensic detail\". Considine recommended the book for those who had previously visited the website Skeptical Science and subsequently wanted to learn more about the wider topic discussed on the site.\n\nIn a review of the book by the academic journal \"Natures Sciences Sociétés\", the authors' thesis was praised for its ability to bring reason to their analysis: \"This book shows how we can break through denial, accept reality, and thus solve the climate crisis\". \"Natures Sciences Sociétés\" recommended the work for multiple stakeholders, concluding: \"It will engage scientists, university students, climate change activists as well as the general public seeking to roll back denial and act\".\n\nJanine Kitson reviewed the book for the journal \"Education\", a publication of the New South Wales Teachers Federation. Kitson described the work as timely and important within the context of a need for the public to act before a point of no return: \"This is a crucial book to read before runaway climate change is truly beyond our control\". Her review concluded: \"One can only hope that this book will be read by climate deniers so we can start the challenging journey to an ecologically sustainable future\".\n\nIn \"The New American\", contributor William F. Jasper criticised the book's authors' characterization of those who engage in climate change denial as character assassination. He wrote that the labels \"deniers\" and \"denialists\" were non-constructive and cruel. Jasper disputed the book's thesis that individuals who disagreed with anthropogenic global warming were organised and financed by the fossil fuel industry.\n\n\n\n"}

It was first released in 2013 and is developed by Docker, Inc.\n\nDocker is used to run software packages called \"containers\". Containers are isolated from each other and bundle their own application, tools, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels. All containers are run by a single operating system kernel and are thus more lightweight than virtual machines. Containers are created from \"images\" that specify their precise contents. Images are often created by combining and modifying standard images downloaded from public repositories.\n\nSolomon Hykes started Docker in France as an internal project within dotCloud, a platform-as-a-service company, with initial contributions by other dotCloud engineers including Andrea Luzzardi and Francois-Xavier Bourlet. Jeff Lindsay also became involved as an independent collaborator. Docker represents an evolution of dotCloud's proprietary technology, which is itself built on earlier open-source projects such as Cloudlets.\n\nThe software debuted to the public in Santa Clara at PyCon in 2013.\n\nDocker was released as open source in March 2013. On March 13, 2014, with the release of version 0.9, Docker dropped LXC as the default execution environment and replaced it with its own library written in the Go programming language.\n\n\nDocker is developed primarily for Linux, where it uses the resource isolation features of the Linux kernel such as cgroups and kernel namespaces, and a union-capable file system such as OverlayFS and others to allow independent \"containers\" to run within a single Linux instance, avoiding the overhead of starting and maintaining virtual machines (VMs). The Linux kernel's support for namespaces mostly isolates an application's view of the operating environment, including process trees, network, user IDs and mounted file systems, while the kernel's cgroups provide resource limiting for memory and CPU. Since version 0.9, Docker includes the library as its own way to directly use virtualization facilities provided by the Linux kernel, in addition to using abstracted virtualization interfaces via libvirt, LXC and systemd-nspawn.\n\nBuilding on top of facilities provided by the Linux kernel (primarily cgroups and namespaces), a Docker container, unlike a virtual machine, does not require or include a separate operating system. Instead, it relies on the kernel's functionality and uses resource isolation for CPU and memory, and separate namespaces to isolate the application's view of the operating system. Docker accesses the Linux kernel's virtualization features either directly using the library, which is available as of Docker 0.9, or indirectly via , (Linux Containers) or .\n\nThe Docker software is a service consisting of three components:\n\n\nDocker implements a high-level API to provide lightweight containers that run processes in isolation.\n\nAccording to a Linux.com article,\n\nBecause Docker containers are lightweight, a single server or virtual machine can run several containers simultaneously. A 2016 analysis found that a typical Docker use case involves running five containers per host, but that many organizations run 10 or more.\n\nUsing containers may simplify the creation of highly distributed systems by allowing multiple applications, worker tasks and other processes to run autonomously on a single physical machine or across multiple virtual machines. This allows the deployment of nodes to be performed as the resources become available or when more nodes are needed, allowing a platform as a service (PaaS)-style of deployment and scaling for systems such as Apache Cassandra, MongoDB and Riak.\n\nDocker can be integrated into various infrastructure tools, including Amazon Web Services, Ansible, CFEngine, Chef, Google Cloud Platform, IBM Bluemix, HPE Helion Stackato, Jelastic, Jenkins, Kubernetes, Microsoft Azure, OpenStack Nova, OpenSVC, Oracle Container Cloud Service, Puppet, ProGet, Salt, Vagrant, and VMware vSphere Integrated Containers.\n\nThe Cloud Foundry Diego project integrates Docker into the Cloud Foundry PaaS.\n\nNanobox uses Docker (natively and with VirtualBox) containers as a core part of its software development platform.\n\nRed Hat's OpenShift PaaS integrates Docker with related projects (Kubernetes, Geard, Project Atomic and others) since v3 (June 2015).\n\nThe Apprenda PaaS integrates Docker containers in version 6.0 of its product.\n\nJelastic PaaS provides managed multi-tenant Docker containers with full compatibility to the native ecosystem.\n\nThe Tsuru PaaS integrates Docker containers in its product in 2013, the first PaaS to use Docker in a production environment.\n\nOn October 15, 2014, Microsoft announced integration of the Docker engine into the next Windows Server release, and native support for the Docker client role in Windows. On June 8, 2016, Microsoft announced that Docker now could be used natively on Windows 10 with Hyper-V Containers, to build, ship and run containers utilizing the Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview 5 Nano Server container OS image.\n\nSince then, a feature known as Windows Containers was made available for Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016. There are two types of Windows Containers: \"Windows Server Containers\" and \"Hyper-V Isolation\". The former has nothing to do with Docker. The latter, however, is a form of hardware virtualization (as opposed to OS-level virtualization) and uses Docker to deliver the guest OS image. The guest OS image is a Windows Nano Server image, which is 652 MB in size and has the same limitations of Nano Server, as well as a separate end-user license agreement.\n\n\n"}

In the United States, platform positions offer important clues as to the policies that U.S. parties will enact. Over the past 30 years, Democratic and Republican congresspeople voted in line with their respective party platforms 74% and 89% of the time, respectively.\n\nA 2017 study in the \"American Journal of Political Science\" found that for 12 countries (Austria, Bulgaria, Canada, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States) found that political parties fulfill their promises to voters to a considerable extent:\nParties that hold executive office after elections generally fulfill substantial percentages, sometimes very high percentages, of their election pledges, whereas parties that do not hold executive office generally find that lower percentages of their pledges are fulfilled. The fulfillment of pledges by governing executive parties varies across governments in ways that reflect power-sharing arrangements. The main power-sharing arrangement that impacts pledge fulfillment distinguishes between single-party governments and coalitions, not between governments with and without legislative majorities. We found the highest percentages of pledge fulfillment for governing parties in the United Kingdom, Sweden, Portugal, Spain, and Canada, most of which governed in single-party executives. We found lower percentages for governing parties in Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, Bulgaria, Ireland, and Italy, most of which governed in coalitions. Pledge fulfillment by U.S. presidential parties lies at the higher end of coalition governments, which suggests that U.S. presidents are more constrained than governing parties in single-party parliamentary systems, but less constrained than most governing parties in multiparty coalitions.Other research on the United States suggests that Democratic and Republican congresspeople voted in line with their respective party platforms 74% and 89% of the time, respectively.\n\n\n\n"}

Master Teacher's teachings also incorporate elements from the New Testament, and from other various spiritual and religious leaders. \nThe community lists itself as an \"international school of enlightenment\", and also as a seminary.\n\nThe stated purpose of the community was to provide its members with a \"universal experience of oneness that is ideally the goal of every spiritual tradition.\" The Academy Journal promises \"an intensive encounter with Singular Reality and a forum for the complete transformation to enlightenment that is the inevitable destiny of mankind.\" Standard teaching sessions were provided for students on a daily basis, and an introductory session for the public was given each Sunday. \nThe organization, was headquartered in Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, USA and had affiliate centers in Poland, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela, and Mexico.\n\nEndeavor Academy, was founded in 1992 by Charles Buell Anderson (b. ca. 1926, d. 2008). Anderson described his 'Spiritual Awakening' as a spontaneous experience he had in 1979. A certain pair of earlier extraordinary experiences Anderson had, may offer some insight into Anderson's later experience of 'Spiritual Awakening'.\n\nThe \"first\" of these two earlier extraordinary experiences was Anderson's World War II experience in Nagasaki, Japan. Anderson's Nagasaki experience appears to have made a deeply profound and formative impression upon him. In a letter to the \"Atomic Veteran's History Project,\" Anderson described how, with the Marines 6th Regiment, he was one of the first to land at Nagasaki after the atomic bombing of that city in 1945, where he was faced with a vast and overwhelming feeling of the devastation he was witnessing:\n\nAnderson wrote that his second such experience came 26 years later in 1971, during a 'Near Death Experience' he had. Anderson wrote that during this second such experience, he had a certain \"space of peace and happiness\" while lying on what he presumed would be his deathbed, and that also during this second event, he received a spontaneous healing from cirrhosis of the liver.\n\nIn an interview with \"CBS News\", Anderson denied having followers, teaching that \"the Light is in everyone\" and that \"You are the light of the world.\" He claimed to be \"returning to heaven\" \"shortly\", and said that \"everybody\" will be going with him. \"There's nothing dangerous about me,\" Anderson explained, \"I am the danger of eternal love.\"\n\nSince Anderson's passing in 2008, the Academy and its affiliates have so far continued to remain active, and have continued to produce and disseminate instructional materials.\n\nFollowing Anderson's passing, the nature of, and names of, the ongoing leadership of the Academy is unknown.\n\nAt the end of 2006 film director Jubi Onyeama and producer Cameron Kennedy, both students of Endeavor Academy, started to interview approximately 120 fellow students. In April 2007 Endeavor Academy sent a film crew to Edinburgh, Scotland to interview additional students and teachers from affiliated centers in Europe. The film was shot over an approximately 2-year period and required more than 200 hours of shooting for the 4-part documentary. The movie, \"A Course in Miracles Unleashed\" was released on Labor Day 2008. The movie was first screened at Sundance Cinema Madison, WI and received much attention on the internet, IMDb. Within the first year of release, the documentary has been subtitled in Dutch, German, Polish, Spanish and Swedish. The documentary about the individual awakening of the students from Endeavor Academy was also screened at the Parliament of World Religions 2009 in Melbourne, Australia. Teachers from Endeavor Academy also represented \"A Course in Miracles\" at the 2004 Parliament of World Religions in Barcelona, Spain and at the 2000 Millennium World Peace Summit at the United Nations in New York City.\n\nAnderson received a copy of \"A Course in Miracles\" ca. 1982. In 1991 he first registered the organization in Reedsburg, Wisconsin, USA under its original name, which was \"God’s Country Place\" (GCP). This organization was based on many of the teachings of \"ACIM\", as well as some Biblical and AA (Alcoholics Anonymous) materials. By 1999, Endeavor Academy had grown to accommodate 500 residents.\n\nIn 1992 the organization was registered to operate under the names Endeavor Academy and New Christian Church of Full Endeavor. Around this time, the use of the GCP name was discontinued.\n\nEndeavor Academy's headquarters was a converted summer resort facility located in a diverse area of water parks and tourist attractions in the middle of Wisconsin Dells. The original facility of 1991 was a large main house, but in 1992 a summer resort motel complex was acquired and converted to meet its needs.\n\nIn 1994 they opened the doors of the Miracles Healing Center for the first time. A lot with the Miracles Healing Center in the middle. The lot holds also the Revelation Hall where big International events where held and four houses for the residential community are located.\n\nEvery Sunday,\"Bible Alive\" services are held in their Miracles Healing Center building on Highway 23 in Wisconsin Dells. On the roadside they have a billboard promoting their Miracles Healing Center with \"Always Open, Everyone Welcome\". On their website is an email address and phone number for prayer requests that can be reached 24/7. In that same building twice a week, 12-step and AA-meetings are hosted by Academy teachers and students as a service to the community.\n\nFor several years now, students have participated in helping inmates by offering them the 12-step program through their Miracles Prisoner Ministry.\nThe Miracles Prisoner Ministry is supporting the Christian Association for Prison Aftercare, Wisconsin Network for Peace & Justice, Madison-area Urban Ministry, Inc.\n\nEndeavor Academy's primary text, \"A Course in Miracles\", was published and distributed between 1995 and 2000 by Penguin Books. As a result of litigation with Endeavor Academy the Foundation for Inner Peace (FIP) copyright claims were largely voided in 2003 on the grounds of general distribution prior to obtaining copyright, thus placing the majority of the material previously claimed by FIP as under copyright protection in the public domain.\nAs a result of the copyright litigation, three earlier limited editions or drafts of \"A Course in Miracles\" surfaced (the Urtext draft, \"Hugh Lynn Cayce\" edition, and the \"Criswell\" edition), which also fell into the public domain. The US Trademark Office canceled both the Servicemark on \"A Course in Miracles\" and the Trademark on the acronym, \"ACIM\" in 2005. EA publishes their own edition of ACIM, called \"The Advent of a Great Awakening\" edition. This EA edition is currently available in print through many major book retailers. Meanwhile, the Foundation for Inner Peace continues to also publish its version of the \"ACIM\" text, which also includes the smaller sections for which the copyright was upheld, and which the FIP claims to still be the only unabridged and complete version of the \"ACIM\" text available.\n\n"}

Describing himself as an \"extreme conservative arch-liberal\" or \"liberal of the extreme right\", Kuehnelt-Leddihn often argued that majority rule in democracies is a threat to individual liberties, and declared himself a monarchist and an enemy of all forms of totalitarianism, although he also supported what he defined as \"non-democratic republics,\" such as Switzerland and the United States. \n\nDescribed as \"A Walking Book of Knowledge\", Kuehnelt-Leddihn had an encyclopedic knowledge of the humanities and was a polyglot, able to speak eight languages and read seventeen others. \nHis early books \"The Menace of the Herd\" and \"Liberty or Equality\" were influential within the American conservative movement. An associate of William F. Buckley Jr., his best-known writings appeared in \"National Review\", where he was a columnist for 35 years.\n\nAt 16, he became the Vienna correspondent of \"The Spectator\". From then on, he wrote for the rest of his life. He studied civil and canon law at the University of Vienna at 18. Then, he went to the University of Budapest, from which he received an M.A. in economics and his doctorate in political science. Moving back to Vienna, he took up studies in theology. In 1935, Kuehnelt-Leddihn travelled to England to become a schoolmaster at Beaumont College, a Jesuit public school. Subsequently, he moved to the United States, where he taught at Georgetown University (1937–1938), Saint Peter's College, New Jersey (head of the History and Sociology Department, 1938–1943), Fordham University (Japanese, 1942–1943), and Chestnut Hill College, Philadelphia (1943–1947).\n\nIn a 1939 letter to the editor of \"The New York Times\", Kuehnelt-Leddihn critiqued the design of every American coin then in circulation except for the Washington quarter, which he allowed was \"so far the most satisfactory coin\" and judged the Mercury dime to be \"the most deplorable.\"\n\nAfter publishing books like \"Jesuiten, Spießer und Bolschewiken\" in 1933 (published in German by Pustet, Salzburg) and \"The Menace of the Herd\" in 1943, in which he criticised the National Socialists as well as the Socialists directly OE indirectly, as he could not return to the Austria that had been incorporated into the Third Reich.\n\nAfter the Second World War, he resettled in Lans, where he lived until his death. He was an avid traveler: he had visited the Soviet Union in 1930–1931, and he eventually visited each of the United States.\n\nKuehnelt-Leddihn wrote for a variety of publications, including \"Chronicles\", \"\", the \"Rothbard-Rockwell Report\", \"Catholic World\", and the Norwegian business magazine \"Farmand\". He also worked with the Acton Institute, which declared him after his death \"a great friend and supporter.\" He was an adjunct scholar of the Ludwig von Mises Institute. For much of his life, Kuehnelt was also a painter; he illustrated some of his own books.\n\nAccording to his friend William F. Buckley, Dr. Kuehnelt-Leddihn was \"the world's most fascinating man.\"\n\nHis socio-political writings dealt with the origins and the philosophical and cultural currents that formed Nazism. He endeavored to explain the intricacies of monarchist concepts and the systems of Europe, cultural movements such as Hussitism and Protestantism, and the disastrous effects of an American policy derived from antimonarchical feelings and ignorance of European culture and history.\n\nKuehnelt-Leddihn directed some of his most significant critiques towards Wilsonian foreign policy activism. Traces of Wilsonianism could be detected in the foreign policies of Franklin Roosevelt; specifically, the assumption that democracy is the ideal political system in any context. Kuehnelt-Leddihn believed that Americans misunderstood much of Central European culture such as the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which Kuehnelt-Leddihn claimed as one of the contributing factors to the rise of Nazism. He also highlighted characteristics of the German society and culture (especially the influences of both Protestant and Catholic mentalities) and attempted to explain the sociological undercurrents of Nazism. Thus, he concludes that sound Catholicism, sound Protestantism, or even, probably, sound popular sovereignty (German-Austrian unification in 1919) all three would have prevented National Socialism although Kuehnelt-Leddihn rather dislikes the latter two.\n\nContrary to the prevailing view that the Nazi Party was a radical right-wing movement with only superficial and minimal leftist elements, Kuehnelt-Leddihn asserted that Nazism (National Socialism) was a strongly leftist, democratic movement ultimately rooted in the French Revolution that unleashed forces of egalitarianism, conformity, materialism and centralization. He argued that Nazism, fascism, radical-liberalism, and communism were essentially democratic movements, based upon inciting the masses to revolution and intent upon destroying the old forms of society. Furthermore, Kuehnelt-Leddihn claimed that all democracy is basically totalitarian and that all democracies eventually degenerate into dictatorships. He said that it was not the case for \"republics\" (the word, for Kuehnelt-Leddihn, has the meaning of what Aristotle calls πολιτεία), such as Switzerland, or the United States as it was originally intended in its constitution. However, he considered the United States to have been to a certain extent subject to a silent democratic revolution in the late 1820s.\n\nIn \"Liberty or Equality\", his magnum opus, Kuehnelt-Leddihn contrasted monarchy with democracy and presented his arguments for the superiority of monarchy: diversity is upheld better in monarchical countries than in democracies. Monarchism is not based on party rule and \"fits organically into the ecclesiastic and familistic pattern of Christian society.\" After insisting that the demand for liberty is about \"how\" to govern and by no means \"by whom\" to govern a given country, he draws arguments for his view that monarchical government is genuinely more liberal in this sense, but democracy naturally advocates for equality, even by enforcement, and thus becomes anti-liberal. As modern life becomes increasingly complicated across many different sociopolitical levels, Kuehnelt-Leddihn submits that the Scita (the political, economic, technological, scientific, military, geographical, psychological knowledge of the masses and of their representatives) and the Scienda (the knowledge in these matters that is necessary to reach logical-rational-moral conclusions) are separated by an incessantly and cruelly widening gap and that democratic governments are totally inadequate for such undertakings.\n\nIn February 1969, Kuehnelt-Leddihn wrote an article arguing against seeking a peace deal to end the\nVietnam War. Instead, he argued that the two options proposed, a reunification scheme and\nthe creation of a coalition Vietnamese government, were unacceptable \nconcessions to the Marxist North Vietnam. Kuehnelt-Leddihn urged the US to continue the war. until the Marxists were defeated.\n\nKuehnelt-Leddihn also denounced the US Bishops' 1982 pastoral \n\n\"The Bishops' letter breathes idealism... moral imperialism, the attempt to inject\ntheology into politics, ought to be avoided except in extreme cases, of which abolition and slavery are examples.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was born is a city known at the time as Yizhou, which is the present-day city of Linyi in the southern part of Shandong Province. Along with his fellow student Dahong Baoen, Daokai is considered to have returned the Caodong/Sōtō Zen lineage to prominence after its near extinction a generation earlier. He was so prominent, in fact, that an extensive biography appeared in the \"Xudeng lu\", a compendium of biographies of prominent monks, in 1101, before he had even reached the height of his career, which was quite unusual for such biographies. The earliest full account of his life appears in Juefan Huihong's biographical compilation of 1119, the \"Chanlin sengbao zhuan\" (Chronicle of the Sangha Treasure in the Groves of Chan). This source speaks very highly of Daokai, despite the fact that its author was a member of the competing Rinzai school. According to his funerary inscription of 1127, he ordained 93 students during his life, and many of these went on to become prominent teachers themselves.\n\nAccording to the \"Chanlin sengbao zhuan\" (Chronicle of the Sangha Treasure in the Groves of Chan) of 1119, Daokai's first spiritual practices were centered on Daoism, specifically those aimed at achieving immortality. To this end, he did not eat grain and went to live in the mountains as a hermit. Eventually, he gave this up and began practicing Zen at Shutai Temple outside the old capital city of Kaifeng, in modern Henan Province. He later became a student of Touzi Yiqing and received dharma transmission from him. He left Touzi in 1082 and took a position at a public monastery, but was later assigned to the well-known White Horse Temple and Longmen Temple. After this he served at Dayang Jingxuan's former monastery on Mount Dayang in Yingzhou. He again moved, this time to Dahong in Suizhou around 1103. In 1104, the Emperor Huizong ordered Daokai to become the abbot of Shifang Jingyin Temple in the capital, Kaifeng. In 1107 he moved to a different temple, Tianning Wanshou, in the same city. This temple was known as a Chongning temple, which were set up by the Emperor so that its residents would pray for his long life. While Daokai did not have a choice in the matter, he later refused to accept a purple robe given to him by the emperor in protest of this system, and he was exiled as a result to Zizhou near modern Jinan in his home province. Huihong's biography claims that crowds of people mourned as he left the city. The following year, however, the emperor ceased his punishment after Daokai sent a poem explaining his thoughts on the matter to an individual named Wang Songnian, who was in contact with the emperor. At this point, Daokai apparently wished to go to Zhejiang to spread his teaching, but decided to stay in his hometown after finding his father in old age. A wealthy government official named Liu Fengshi patronized the construction of a small monastery for Daokai at Lake Furong near his home village. In 1117, this monastery was give a plaque by the emperor giving it the name Huayan Chan Monastery, indicating the emperor's complete change of heart regarding him by that time. In 1118 Daokai died on the fourteenth day of the fifth month.\n"}

In the book, Varner defended a form of biocentric individualism, according to which all living entities have morally considerable interests.\n\nFrom 2001, Varner embarked on a research project exploring animals in Hare's two-level utilitarianism. \"Personhood, Ethics, and Animal Cognition\", published by Oxford University Press in 2012, was the first monograph arising from this project. In the book, Varner moved away from his biocentrism, instead endorsing a developed version of Hare's ethics. Varner draws a distinction between persons, near-persons and merely sentient beings; although all are morally considerable, the lives of persons are of the most significance, and the lives of merely sentient beings are of the least. The practical consequences of this view, though initial comments were offered in \"Personhood, Ethics, and Animal Cognition\", will be explored in \"Sustaining Animals\", forthcoming with Oxford University Press.\n\nVarner completed a Bachelor of Arts in philosophy at Arizona State University in 1980, before studying for a Master of Arts in philosophy at the University of Georgia, which he completed in 1983. He read for a PhD at University of Wisconsin–Madison, writing a thesis on environmental ethics; this was one of the first on the topic. Developed versions of some of the thesis's chapters were later published as chapters 2, 3 and 4 Varner's first book, \"In Nature's Interests?\". His doctoral research was supervised by Jon Morline, who continued as a supervisor even after leaving Madison to work at St. Olaf College. Graduating from Madison in 1988, Varner had a number of short-term jobs in the late 1980s; he lectured in philosophy at the University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point from 1987 to 1988, acted as a visiting assistant professor at Madison's Institute of Environmental Studies in the Summer of 1988, and took up the same role, this time in philosophy, at Washington University in St. Louis from 1988 to 1990.\n\nVarner joined Texas A&M University in 1990, becoming an assistant professor in 1991. He became Director of Graduate Studies in 1994, a post he kept until 2010. Varner was promoted to associate professor in 1996, and, in 1998, published his first book: \"In Nature's Interests? Interests, Animal Rights, and Environmental Ethics\", which was a part of Oxford University Press's Environmental Ethics and Science Policy Series, edited by Kristin Schrader-Frechette. Varner was promoted to full professor in 2010, and acted as department head from 2011 to 2014.\n\nVarner's second monograph, \"Personhood, Ethics, and Animal Cognition: Situating Animals in the Two-Level Utilitarianism of R. M. Hare\", was published in 2012 by Oxford University Press. Varner had been working on questions about R. M. Hare and animals since 2001, when he taught a graduate class exploring the subject; given that Peter Singer was a student of Hare, Varner was interested in exploring whether Hare's philosophy endorsed Singer's conclusions about animal liberation. A project entitled \"Harey Animals: Situating Animals in the Two-Level Utilitarianism of R. M. Hare\" was submitted to Oxford University Press, but this was subsequently split into two books; \"Personhood, Ethics, and Animal Cognition\" was the first, while the second, the forthcoming \"Sustaining Animals: Envisioning Humane, Sustainable Communities\", in under contract with the publisher. While \"Personhood, Ethics, and Animal Cognition\" addresses theoretical issues in Hare's philosophy, \"Sustaining Animals\" is more practically focussed, exploring the applicability of the Harean philosophy developed in \"Personhood, Ethics, and Animal Cognition\" to real-world issues concerning human-animal relationships. In 2017, Varner's \"Defending Biodiversity: Environmental Science and Ethics\", co-authored with the University of Guelph ecologist Jonathan Newman and the Guelph philosopher Stefan Linquist, was published by Cambridge University Press.\n\nVarner's \"In Nature's Interests?\" offers a resolution of the debate between individualistic approaches to animal rights and holistic accounts of environmental ethics. Varner defends an interest-based biocentric individualism according to which all living beings—including plants—have morally significant interests that ground \"prima facie\" (though overridable) duties. The approach follows in the tradition of the work of Kenneth Goodpaster and Paul Taylor, though Varner's approach differs from Taylor's in its focus on interests rather than duties, with Varner showing clear utilitarian commitments.\n\nVarner begins by critiquing holistic approaches to environmental ethics, using J. Baird Callicott's as his example. He argues that the burden of proof is with holists to defend the claim that ecosystems have interests or have value for some other reason. He next considers desires as the paradigmatic basis of interests, exploring which beings have desires. Nonetheless, he argues that desires cannot be the sole basis of interests; 19th-century mariners, for instance, had an interest in using ascorbic acid to avoid scurvy, though they could not have desired the acid, as they did not know about it. Instead, such people had a \"biological\" interest in the acid. It is, Varner argues, the presence of biological interests that separates living beings from artifacts. This grounds Varner's argument for biocentrism, which Mark Rowlands summarises as follows:\n\n\nRowlands argues that the problem with the book's central approach is that it assumes that all interests have a clear relation to welfare and thus moral considerability; an assumption which, he argues, is partially undermined by the introduction of biological interests. Jon Jensen, who reviewed the book for \"Ethics and the Environment\", raised a similar worry, arguing that Varner did not sufficiently justify his claim that biological interests are inherently morally significant.\n\nA distinctive aspect of Varner's theory as presented in \"In Nature's Interests?\" is the hierarchy of interests that he proposes; biological interests are the least important, with desire-based interests of greater significance and \"ground projects\"—possessed only by humans, these are \"a nexus of [an individual's] most important desires\"—of the most weight. Thus, Varner defends a kind of \"axiological anthropocentrism\"; this can be distinguished from \"valuational anthropocentrism\", according to which only humans have inherent value.\n\nThe book also has a practical dimension, presenting debates between anthropocentric and non-anthropocentric approaches to environmental ethics as of little practical consequence, and suggesting that animal rights goals can be consistent with holistic environmentalist goals. Jensen argues that Varner's own discussion of the reconciliation of environmentalism and animal advocacy is too narrow, but that, nonetheless, Varner's own biocentric individualism offers potential in this area, even despite the limited engagement in the book with practical animal-related issues.\n\nHare's philosophy of two-level utilitarianism has been a focus of Varner's since the early 2000s, and was the subject of his \"Personhood, Ethics, and Animal Cognition\". In the book, Varner breaks with his previous biocentrism, instead endorsing sentientism (the idea that sentience is necessary and sufficient for moral considerability), prescriptivism, and two-level utilitarianism. The book is split into three parts: \"Hare's Two-Level Utilitarianism\", \"Persons, Near-Persons, and the Merely Sentient\", and \"Formulating ILS [Intuitive-Level System] Rules for Persons, Near-Persons, and the Merely Sentient\". The first part offers a reconstruction and analysis of Hare's philosophy, while the latter two offer an original position on animal ethics and personhood.\n\nIn Part I, Varner offers considerable endorsement of Harean philosophy. Varner interprets Hare as understanding that utilitarianism derives from prescriptivism, and affirms Hare's argument on this point. He goes on to discuss the utility of Intuitive-Level System (ILS) rules; these are the rules that one lives by in day-to-day life, which, though ultimately justified by it, do not derive their content from utilitarian calculation. There are, for Varner, four key kinds of ILSs: \"common morality, personal morality, professional ethics, and laws\". Though these are deontological in \"flavor\", following the precepts of these ILSs is generally justified under two-level utilitarianism. Further arguments—these are original, rather than being derived from Hare's own—are then offered for Hare's prescriptivism.\n\nIn Part II, Varner adopts a higher-order thought theory of consciousness and reviews evidence for animal consciousness. He argues that, according to contemporary science, vertebrates are conscious (i.e., sentient, able to feel pain), but few invertebrates are; cephalopods are an exception. He goes on to argue that most animals lack a biographical sense of self, something possessed by paradigmatic humans. A good life for human persons, consequently, \"consists in living a good story\", meaning that persons can be harmed in ways that non-persons cannot. Varner denies that nonhuman animals lack the psychological sophistication necessary for personhood, but argues that some, nonetheless, may be \"near-persons\"; this means that they lack a biographical sense of self, but possess autonoetic consciousness. Possible candidates include nonhuman primates, as well as Corvidae, Cetacea and Elephantidae, and rats and parrots. Varner frames the lives of near-persons as of less significance than the lives of persons, but of greater significance than the lives of other animals who are nonetheless sentient. The distinctions drawn in Part II are logically independent of any commitment to utilitarianism, Harean or otherwise.\n\nIn Part III, Varner explores the replaceability argument (the idea that it would be ethically acceptable to painlessly kill beings if it was immediately replaced with a new equally happy being) in the context of two-level utilitarianism. At the critical level, he argues that both humans and animals are replaceable. However, he argues that the intuitive-level idea that humans are not replaceable should be respected. Animals typically kept on farms are, for Varner, replaceable, meaning that certain forms of animal agriculture are permissible. Varner's also claims that there is a \"prima facie\" good in creating more happy animals and more happy humans, the latter meaning that there is a \"prima facie\" good in human procreation, and a \"prima facie\" wrong in abortion. This, however, applies only to critical-level thinking, and good intuitive-level theorising, he argues, would typically leave these decisions up to individuals. Varner also explores the issue of \"marginal\" cases. Given that he holds that the lives of nonhuman non-persons and nonhuman near-persons are of lesser value than those of human persons, it may seem that Varner has to accept that the lives of human non-persons and human near-persons are of less value than the lives of human persons or else face the charge of speciesism or inconsistency. However, Varner argues that human non- and near-persons should be given equal rights to life as human persons on the basis that, first, human persons have strong relationships with human non-persons, and, second, human persons may fear becoming human non-persons.\n\nVarner then considers a range of proposals for sustainable, humane agriculture, including replacing cattle with buffalo and engineering blind chickens. Varner defends demi-vegetarianism, holding that humans should eat less meat and be more selective about where their meat comes from; factory farming, for example, is likely unacceptable. The book closes with a consideration of the relationship between a Harean approach to animal ethics and Singer's approach; Varner argues that Singer has employed two-level utilitarianism, and implicitly supports the idea of near-persons. Varmer also argues that Singer, despite the latter's advocacy for vegetarianism, presents a theory that supports certain forms of humane agriculture.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "72016", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72016", "title": "Genetic drift", "text": "Genetic drift\n\nGenetic drift (also known as allelic drift or the Sewall Wright effect) is the change in the frequency of an existing gene variant (allele) in a population due to random sampling of organisms. The alleles in the offspring are a sample of those in the parents, and chance has a role in determining whether a given individual survives and reproduces. A population's allele frequency is the fraction of the copies of one gene that share a particular form. Genetic drift may cause gene variants to disappear completely and thereby reduce genetic variation. It can also cause initially rare alleles to become much more frequent and even fixed. \n\nWhen there are few copies of an allele, the effect of genetic drift is larger, and when there are many copies the effect is smaller. In the early 20th century, vigorous debates occurred over the relative importance of natural selection versus neutral processes, including genetic drift. Ronald Fisher, who explained natural selection using Mendelian genetics, held the view that genetic drift plays at the most a minor role in evolution, and this remained the dominant view for several decades. In 1968, population geneticist Motoo Kimura rekindled the debate with his neutral theory of molecular evolution, which claims that most instances where a genetic change spreads across a population (although not necessarily changes in phenotypes) are caused by genetic drift acting on neutral mutations.\n\nThe process of genetic drift can be illustrated using 20 marbles in a jar to represent 20 organisms in a population. Consider this jar of marbles as the starting population. Half of the marbles in the jar are red and half are blue, with each colour corresponding to a different allele of one gene in the population. In each new generation the organisms reproduce at random. To represent this reproduction, randomly select a marble from the original jar and deposit a new marble with the same colour into a new jar. This is the \"offspring\" of the original marble, meaning that the original marble remains in its jar. Repeat this process until there are 20 new marbles in the second jar. The second jar will now contain 20 \"offspring\", or marbles of various colours. Unless the second jar contains exactly 10 red marbles and 10 blue marbles, a random shift has occurred in the allele frequencies.\n\nIf this process is repeated a number of times, the numbers of red and blue marbles picked each generation will fluctuate. Sometimes a jar will have more red marbles than its \"parent\" jar and sometimes more blue. This fluctuation is analogous to genetic drift – a change in the population's allele frequency resulting from a random variation in the distribution of alleles from one generation to the next.\n\nIt is even possible that in any one generation no marbles of a particular colour are chosen, meaning they have no offspring. In this example, if no red marbles are selected, the jar representing the new generation contains only blue offspring. If this happens, the red allele has been lost permanently in the population, while the remaining blue allele has become fixed: all future generations are entirely blue. In small populations, fixation can occur in just a few generations.\n\nThe mechanisms of genetic drift can be illustrated with a simplified example. Consider a very large colony of bacteria isolated in a drop of solution. The bacteria are genetically identical except for a single gene with two alleles labeled A and B. A and B are neutral alleles meaning that they do not affect the bacteria's ability to survive and reproduce; all bacteria in this colony are equally likely to survive and reproduce. Suppose that half the bacteria have allele A and the other half have allele B. Thus A and B each have allele frequency 1/2.\n\nThe drop of solution then shrinks until it has only enough food to sustain four bacteria. All other bacteria die without reproducing. Among the four who survive, there are sixteen possible combinations for the A and B alleles:\n\n(A-A-A-A), (B-A-A-A), (A-B-A-A), (B-B-A-A), (A-A-B-A), (B-A-B-A), (A-B-B-A), (B-B-B-A), (A-A-A-B), (B-A-A-B), (A-B-A-B), (B-B-A-B), (A-A-B-B), (B-A-B-B), (A-B-B-B), (B-B-B-B).\n\nSince all bacteria in the original solution are equally likely to survive when the solution shrinks, the four survivors are a random sample from the original colony. The probability that each of the four survivors has a given allele is 1/2, and so the probability that any particular allele combination occurs when the solution shrinks is\n\n(The original population size is so large that the sampling effectively happens without replacement). In other words, each of the sixteen possible allele combinations is equally likely to occur, with probability 1/16.\n\nCounting the combinations with the same number of A and B, we get the following table.\nAs shown in the table, the total number of combinations that have the same number of A alleles as of B alleles is six, and the probability of this combination is 6/16. The total number of other combinations is ten, so the probability of unequal number of A and B alleles is 10/16. Thus, although the original colony began with an equal number of A and B alleles, it is very possible that the number of alleles in the remaining population of four members will not be equal. Equal numbers is actually less likely than unequal numbers. In the latter case, genetic drift has occurred because the population's allele frequencies have changed due to random sampling. In this example the population contracted to just four random survivors, a phenomenon known as population bottleneck.\n\nThe probabilities for the number of copies of allele A (or B) that survive (given in the last column of the above table) can be calculated directly from the binomial distribution where the \"success\" probability (probability of a given allele being present) is 1/2 (i.e., the probability that there are \"k\" copies of A (or B) alleles in the combination) is given by\n\nwhere \"n=4\" is the number of surviving bacteria.\n\nMathematical models of genetic drift can be designed using either branching processes or a diffusion equation describing changes in allele frequency in an idealised population.\n\nConsider a gene with two alleles, A or B. In diploid populations consisting of \"N\" individuals there are 2\"N\" copies of each gene. An individual can have two copies of the same allele or two different alleles. We can call the frequency of one allele \"p\" and the frequency of the other \"q\". The Wright–Fisher model (named after Sewall Wright and Ronald Fisher) assumes that generations do not overlap (for example, annual plants have exactly one generation per year) and that each copy of the gene found in the new generation is drawn independently at random from all copies of the gene in the old generation. The formula to calculate the probability of obtaining \"k\" copies of an allele that had frequency \"p\" in the last generation is then\n\nwhere the symbol \"!\" signifies the factorial function. This expression can also be formulated using the binomial coefficient,\n\nThe Moran model assumes overlapping generations. At each time step, one individual is chosen to reproduce and one individual is chosen to die. So in each timestep, the number of copies of a given allele can go up by one, go down by one, or can stay the same. This means that the transition matrix is tridiagonal, which means that mathematical solutions are easier for the Moran model than for the Wright–Fisher model. On the other hand, computer simulations are usually easier to perform using the Wright–Fisher model, because fewer time steps need to be calculated. In the Moran model, it takes \"N\" timesteps to get through one generation, where \"N\" is the effective population size. In the Wright–Fisher model, it takes just one.\n\nIn practice, the Moran and Wright–Fisher models give qualitatively similar results, but genetic drift runs twice as fast in the Moran model.\n\nIf the variance in the number of offspring is much greater than that given by the binomial distribution assumed by the Wright–Fisher model, then given the same overall speed of genetic drift (the variance effective population size), genetic drift is a less powerful force compared to selection. Even for the same variance, if higher moments of the offspring number distribution exceed those of the binomial distribution then again the force of genetic drift is substantially weakened.\n\nRandom changes in allele frequencies can also be caused by effects other than sampling error, for example random changes in selection pressure.\n\nOne important alternative source of stochasticity, perhaps more important than genetic drift, is genetic draft. Genetic draft is the effect on a locus by selection on linked loci. The mathematical properties of genetic draft are different from those of genetic drift. The direction of the random change in allele frequency is autocorrelated across generations.\n\nThe Hardy–Weinberg principle states that within sufficiently large populations, the allele frequencies remain constant from one generation to the next unless the equilibrium is disturbed by migration, genetic mutations, or selection.\n\nHowever, in finite populations, no new alleles are gained from the random sampling of alleles passed to the next generation, but the sampling can cause an existing allele to disappear. Because random sampling can remove, but not replace, an allele, and because random declines or increases in allele frequency influence expected allele distributions for the next generation, genetic drift drives a population towards genetic uniformity over time. When an allele reaches a frequency of 1 (100%) it is said to be \"fixed\" in the population and when an allele reaches a frequency of 0 (0%) it is lost. Smaller populations achieve fixation faster, whereas in the limit of an infinite population, fixation is not achieved. Once an allele becomes fixed, genetic drift comes to a halt, and the allele frequency cannot change unless a new allele is introduced in the population via mutation or gene flow. Thus even while genetic drift is a random, directionless process, it acts to eliminate genetic variation over time.\n\nAssuming genetic drift is the only evolutionary force acting on an allele, after \"t\" generations in many replicated populations, starting with allele frequencies of \"p\" and \"q\", the variance in allele frequency across those populations is\n\nAssuming genetic drift is the only evolutionary force acting on an allele, at any given time the probability that an allele will eventually become fixed in the population is simply its frequency in the population at that time. For example, if the frequency \"p\" for allele A is 75% and the frequency \"q\" for allele B is 25%, then given unlimited time the probability A will ultimately become fixed in the population is 75% and the probability that B will become fixed is 25%.\n\nThe expected number of generations for fixation to occur is proportional to the population size, such that fixation is predicted to occur much more rapidly in smaller populations. Normally the effective population size, which is smaller than the total population, is used to determine these probabilities. The effective population (\"N\") takes into account factors such as the level of inbreeding, the stage of the lifecycle in which the population is the smallest, and the fact that some neutral genes are genetically linked to others that are under selection. The effective population size may not be the same for every gene in the same population.\n\nOne forward-looking formula used for approximating the expected time before a neutral allele becomes fixed through genetic drift, according to the Wright–Fisher model, is\n\nwhere \"T\" is the number of generations, \"N\" is the effective population size, and \"p\" is the initial frequency for the given allele. The result is the number of generations expected to pass before fixation occurs for a given allele in a population with given size (\"N\") and allele frequency (\"p\").\n\nThe expected time for the neutral allele to be lost through genetic drift can be calculated as\n\nWhen a mutation appears only once in a population large enough for the initial frequency to be negligible, the formulas can be simplified to\n\nfor average number of generations expected before fixation of a neutral mutation, and\n\nfor the average number of generations expected before the loss of a neutral mutation.\n\nThe formulae above apply to an allele that is already present in a population, and which is subject to neither mutation nor natural selection. If an allele is lost by mutation much more often than it is gained by mutation, then mutation, as well as drift, may influence the time to loss. If the allele prone to mutational loss begins as fixed in the population, and is lost by mutation at rate m per replication, then the expected time in generations until its loss in a haploid population is given by\n\nwhere formula_11 is Euler's constant. The first approximation represents the waiting time until the first mutant destined for loss, with loss then occurring relatively rapidly by genetic drift, taking time \"N\" ≪ 1/\"m\". The second approximation represents the time needed for deterministic loss by mutation accumulation. In both cases, the time to fixation is dominated by mutation via the term 1/\"m\", and is less affected by the effective population size.\n\nIn natural populations, genetic drift and natural selection do not act in isolation; both forces are always at play, together with mutation and migration. Neutral evolution is the product of both mutation and drift, not of drift alone. Similarly, even when selection overwhelms genetic drift, it can only act on variation that mutation provides.\n\nWhile natural selection has a direction, guiding evolution towards heritable adaptations to the current environment, genetic drift has no direction and is guided only by the mathematics of chance. As a result, drift acts upon the genotypic frequencies within a population without regard to their phenotypic effects. In contrast, selection favors the spread of alleles whose phenotypic effects increase survival and/or reproduction of their carriers, lowers the frequencies of alleles that cause unfavorable traits, and ignores those that are neutral.\n\nThe law of large numbers predicts that when the absolute number of copies of the allele is small (e.g., in small populations), the magnitude of drift on allele frequencies per generation is larger. The magnitude of drift is large enough to overwhelm selection at any allele frequency when the selection coefficient is less than 1 divided by the effective population size. Non-adaptive evolution resulting from the product of mutation and genetic drift is therefore considered to be a consequential mechanism of evolutionary change primarily within small, isolated populations. The mathematics of genetic drift depend on the effective population size, but it is not clear how this is related to the actual number of individuals in a population. Genetic linkage to other genes that are under selection can reduce the effective population size experienced by a neutral allele. With a higher recombination rate, linkage decreases and with it this local effect on effective population size. This effect is visible in molecular data as a correlation between local recombination rate and genetic diversity, and negative correlation between gene density and diversity at noncoding DNA regions. Stochasticity associated with linkage to other genes that are under selection is not the same as sampling error, and is sometimes known as genetic draft in order to distinguish it from genetic drift.\n\nWhen the allele frequency is very small, drift can also overpower selection even in large populations. For example, while disadvantageous mutations are usually eliminated quickly in large populations, new advantageous mutations are almost as vulnerable to loss through genetic drift as are neutral mutations. Not until the allele frequency for the advantageous mutation reaches a certain threshold will genetic drift have no effect.\n\nA population bottleneck is when a population contracts to a significantly smaller size over a short period of time due to some random environmental event. In a true population bottleneck, the odds for survival of any member of the population are purely random, and are not improved by any particular inherent genetic advantage. The bottleneck can result in radical changes in allele frequencies, completely independent of selection.\n\nThe impact of a population bottleneck can be sustained, even when the bottleneck is caused by a one-time event such as a natural catastrophe.\nAn interesting example of a bottleneck causing unusual genetic distribution is the relatively high proportion of individuals with total rod cell color blindness (achromatopsia) on Pingelap atoll in Micronesia. After a bottleneck, inbreeding increases. This increases the damage done by recessive deleterious mutations, in a process known as inbreeding depression. The worst of these mutations are selected against, leading to the loss of other alleles that are genetically linked to them, in a process of background selection. For recessive harmful mutations, this selection can be enhanced as a consequence of the bottleneck, due to genetic purging. This leads to a further loss of genetic diversity. In addition, a sustained reduction in population size increases the likelihood of further allele fluctuations from drift in generations to come.\n\nA population's genetic variation can be greatly reduced by a bottleneck, and even beneficial adaptations may be permanently eliminated. The loss of variation leaves the surviving population vulnerable to any new selection pressures such as disease, climate change or shift in the available food source, because adapting in response to environmental changes requires sufficient genetic variation in the population for natural selection to take place.\n\nThere have been many known cases of population bottleneck in the recent past. Prior to the arrival of Europeans, North American prairies were habitat for millions of greater prairie chickens. In Illinois alone, their numbers plummeted from about 100 million birds in 1900 to about 50 birds in the 1990s. The declines in population resulted from hunting and habitat destruction, but a consequence has been a loss of most of the species' genetic diversity. DNA analysis comparing birds from the mid century to birds in the 1990s documents a steep decline in the genetic variation in just the latter few decades. Currently the greater prairie chicken is experiencing low reproductive success.\n\nHowever, the genetic loss caused by bottleneck and genetic drift can increase fitness, as in \"Ehrlichia\".\n\nOver-hunting also caused a severe population bottleneck in the northern elephant seal in the 19th century. Their resulting decline in genetic variation can be deduced by comparing it to that of the southern elephant seal, which were not so aggressively hunted.\n\nThe founder effect is a special case of a population bottleneck, occurring when a small group in a population splinters off from the original population and forms a new one. The random sample of alleles in the just formed new colony is expected to grossly misrepresent the original population in at least some respects. It is even possible that the number of alleles for some genes in the original population is larger than the number of gene copies in the founders, making complete representation impossible. When a newly formed colony is small, its founders can strongly affect the population's genetic make-up far into the future.\n\nA well-documented example is found in the Amish migration to Pennsylvania in 1744. Two members of the new colony shared the recessive allele for Ellis–van Creveld syndrome. Members of the colony and their descendants tend to be religious isolates and remain relatively insular. As a result of many generations of inbreeding, Ellis-van Creveld syndrome is now much more prevalent among the Amish than in the general population.\n\nThe difference in gene frequencies between the original population and colony may also trigger the two groups to diverge significantly over the course of many generations. As the difference, or genetic distance, increases, the two separated populations may become distinct, both genetically and phenetically, although not only genetic drift but also natural selection, gene flow, and mutation contribute to this divergence. This potential for relatively rapid changes in the colony's gene frequency led most scientists to consider the founder effect (and by extension, genetic drift) a significant driving force in the evolution of new species. Sewall Wright was the first to attach this significance to random drift and small, newly isolated populations with his shifting balance theory of speciation. Following after Wright, Ernst Mayr created many persuasive models to show that the decline in genetic variation and small population size following the founder effect were critically important for new species to develop. However, there is much less support for this view today since the hypothesis has been tested repeatedly through experimental research and the results have been equivocal at best.\n\nThe concept of genetic drift was introduced by a founder of population genetics, Sewall Wright. His first use of the term \"drift\" was in 1929, though at the time he was using it in the sense of a directed process of change, or natural selection. Random drift by means of sampling error came to be known as the \"Sewall–Wright effect,\" though he was never entirely comfortable to see his name given to it. Wright referred to all changes in allele frequency as either \"steady drift\" (e.g., selection) or \"random drift\" (e.g., sampling error). \"Drift\" came to be adopted as a technical term in the stochastic sense exclusively. Today it is usually defined still more narrowly, in terms of sampling error, although this narrow definition is not universal. Wright wrote that the \"restriction of \"random drift\" or even \"drift\" to only one component, the effects of accidents of sampling, tends to lead to confusion.\" Sewall Wright considered the process of random genetic drift by means of sampling error equivalent to that by means of inbreeding, but later work has shown them to be distinct.\n\nIn the early days of the modern evolutionary synthesis, scientists were beginning to blend the new science of population genetics with Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection. Within this framework, Wright focused on the effects of inbreeding on small relatively isolated populations. He introduced the concept of an adaptive landscape in which phenomena such as cross breeding and genetic drift in small populations could push them away from adaptive peaks, which in turn allow natural selection to push them towards new adaptive peaks. Wright thought smaller populations were more suited for natural selection because \"inbreeding was sufficiently intense to create new interaction systems through random drift but not intense enough to cause random nonadaptive fixation of genes.\"\n\nWright's views on the role of genetic drift in the evolutionary scheme were controversial almost from the very beginning. One of the most vociferous and influential critics was colleague Ronald Fisher. Fisher conceded genetic drift played some role in evolution, but an insignificant one. Fisher has been accused of misunderstanding Wright's views because in his criticisms Fisher seemed to argue Wright had rejected selection almost entirely. To Fisher, viewing the process of evolution as a long, steady, adaptive progression was the only way to explain the ever-increasing complexity from simpler forms. But the debates have continued between the \"gradualists\" and those who lean more toward the Wright model of evolution where selection and drift together play an important role.\n\nIn 1968, Motoo Kimura rekindled the debate with his neutral theory of molecular evolution, which claims that most of the genetic changes are caused by genetic drift acting on neutral mutations.\n\nThe role of genetic drift by means of sampling error in evolution has been criticized by John H. Gillespie and William B. Provine, who argue that selection on linked sites is a more important stochastic force.\n\n\n"}

The name Harambee is Swahili for \"Let's Pull Together.\" \n\nBy April, 1969, the newspaper had returned to its roots as an exclusive publication of Karenga's US organization. \n\n"}

{"id": "10129212", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10129212", "title": "Irenaean theodicy", "text": "Irenaean theodicy\n\nThe Irenaean theodicy is a Christian theodicy (a response to the problem of evil). It defends the probability of an omnipotent and omnibenevolent (all-powerful and perfectly loving) God in the face of evidence of evil in the world. Numerous variations of theodicy have been proposed which all maintain that, while evil exists, God is either not responsible for creating evil, or he is not guilty for creating evil. Typically, the Irenaean theodicy asserts that the world is the best of all possible worlds because it allows humans to fully develop. Most versions of the Irenaean theodicy propose that creation is incomplete, as humans are not yet fully developed, and experiencing evil and suffering is necessary for such development.\n\nSecond-century philosopher and theologian Irenaeus, after whom the theodicy is named, proposed a two-stage creation process in which humans require free will and the experience of evil to develop. Another early Christian theologian, Origen, presented a response to the problem of evil which cast the world as a schoolroom or hospital for the soul; theologian Mark Scott has argued that Origen, rather than Irenaeus, ought to be considered the father of this kind of theodicy. Friedrich Schleiermacher argued in the nineteenth century that God must necessarily create flawlessly, so this world must be the best possible world because it allows God's purposes to be naturally fulfilled. In 1966, philosopher John Hick discussed the similarities of the preceding theodicies, calling them all \"Irenaean\". He supported the view that creation is incomplete and argued that the world is best placed for the full moral development of humans, as it presents genuine moral choices. British philosopher Richard Swinburne proposed that, to make a free moral choice, humans must have experience of the consequences of their own actions and that natural evil must exist to provide such choices.\n\nThe development of process theology has challenged the Irenaean tradition by teaching that God's power is limited and that he cannot be responsible for evil. Twentieth-century philosopher Alvin Plantinga supported the idea that this world is the best possible world, arguing that the good in the world (including God's infinite goodness) outweighs the evil and proposing that the ultimate good of God's sacrifice when Jesus was crucified necessitated the existence of evil. His free will defence was not a theodicy because he was trying to show the logical compatibility of evil and the existence of God, rather than the probability of God. D. Z. Phillips and Fyodor Dostoyevsky challenged the instrumental use of suffering, suggesting that love cannot be expressed through suffering. However, Dostoyevsky also states that the beauty of love is evident, in that love can continue to grow, withstand and overcome even the most evil acts. Michael Tooley argued that the magnitude of suffering is excessive and that, in some cases, cannot lead to moral development. French theologian Henri Blocher criticised Hick's universalism, arguing that such a view negates free will, which was similarly important to the theodicy.\n\nThe Irenaean theodicy was first identified as a form of theodicy by John Hick in \"Evil and the God of Love\", written in 1966. Hick distinguished between the Augustinian theodicy, which is based on free will, and the Irenaean theodicy, which casts God as responsible for evil but justified in it. The Irenaean theodicy is distinguished by its acceptance that God is responsible for evil, but that he is not at fault.\n\nThe Irenaean theodicy is a response to the evidential problem of evil which raises the problem that, if an omnipotent and omnibenevolent (all-powerful and perfectly loving) God exists, there should be no evil in the world. Evidence of evil in the world would make the existence of God improbable. The theodicy attempts to demonstrate that the existence of God remains probable, despite the occurrence of evil.\n\nAccording to the Irenaean tradition, humans are not created perfectly, but in a state of imperfection. The theodicy teaches that creation has two stages: humans were first created in the image of God, and will then be created in the likeness of God. Humans are imperfect because the second stage is incomplete, entailing the potential, not yet actualised, for humans to reach perfection. To achieve this likeness of God, humans must be refined and developed. The theodicy proposes that evil and suffering exists in the world because this is the best way for humans to develop. As such, the Irenaean theodicy is sometimes referred to as the \"soul-making theodicy\", a phrase taken from the poet John Keats.\n\nTypical to variations of the Irenaean theodicy is the notion that the present world is the greatest possible world, or the best of all possible worlds. This is based on the Irenaean idea of human development, suggesting that the best possible world would be best suited to human development: a world containing evil and suffering would allow development better than one which does not, so the world is considered the best possible world.\n\nSecond-century philosopher Irenaeus developed a theodicy based on the idea that the creation of humans is still in progress. He proposed that creation consists of two distinct parts: first in the image of God, then in the likeness of God. Irenaeus believed the first stage is complete, but the second stage requires humans to develop and grow into the likeness of God, a stage which Irenaeus believed is still in progress. He believed that, in order to achieve moral perfection, humans must be given free choice, with the actual possibility of choosing to do evil. Irenaeus argued that for humans to have free will, God must be at an epistemic distance (or intellectual distance) from humans, far enough that belief in God remains a free choice.\n\nBecause Irenaeus saw the purpose of the world to be the development of the moral character of humans, he believed that a good world would be best suited to that purpose. Irenaeaus believed that this world would include some suffering and evil to help people draw closer to God. He perceived God's declaration in the Book of Genesis that his creation was good to mean that the world is fit for purpose, rather than being free from suffering. To illustrate the benefits of suffering, Irenaeus cited the Biblical example of Jonah, from the Book of Jonah. His suffering, being swallowed by a whale, both enabled God's plan to be fulfilled and also brought Jonah closer to God: Jonah ended up repenting for his sin and the people of Nineveh turn to God.\n\nIrenaeus' eschatology was based on a literal interpretation of the Bible, especially the Book of Revelation. He believed that there would be 6000 years of suffering before the world ends in a fiery purge. This fire would purify believers ahead of a new human community existing in the New Jerusalem. The afterlife, Irenaeus proposed, focuses more on time than space; he looked forward to a time in which humans are fully developed and live the life of God.\n\nEarly Christian theologian Origen also presented suffering as necessary for the development of human beings. Theologian Mark Scott has argued that John Hick's theodicy is more closely aligned with Origen's beliefs than Irenaeus' and ought to be called an \"Origenian theodicy\". Origen used two metaphors for the world: it is a school and a hospital for souls, with God as Teacher and Physician, in which suffering plays both an educative and healing role. Through an allegorical reading of Exodus and the books of Solomon, Origen casts human development as a progression though a series of stages which take place in this life and after death. Origen believed that all humans will eventually reach heaven as the logical conclusion of God being 'all in all'. Hell is a metaphor for the purification of our souls: our sinful nature goes to 'Hell' and our original nature, created by God, goes to heaven. Scott argues that significant aspects of Origen's theology mean that there is a stronger continuation between it and Hick's theodicy. These aspects are Origen's allegorical treatment of Adam and Eve, the presentation of the world as a hospital or schoolroom, the progression he advocates of the human soul, and his universalism.\n\nIn the early 19th century, Friedrich Schleiermacher wrote \"Speeches\" and \"The Christian Faith\", proposing a theodicy which John Hick later identified as Irenaean in nature. Schleiermacher began his theodicy by asserting that God is omnipotent and benevolent and concluded that, because of this, \"God would create flawlessly\". He proposed that it would be illogical for a perfect creation to go wrong (as Augustine had suggested) and that evil must have been created by God for a good reason. Schleiermacher conceived a perfect world to be one in which God's purposes can naturally be achieved, and will ultimately lead to dependence on God. He conceived sin as being an obstruction to humanity's dependence on God, arguing that it is almost inevitable, but citing Jesus as an example of a sinless man, whose consciousness of God was unobstructed. This theology led Schleiermacher to universalism, arguing that it is God's will for everyone to be saved and that no person could alter this. \n\nJohn Wick published \"Evil and the God of Love\" in 1966, in which he developed a theodicy based on the work of Irenaeus. Hick distinguished between the Augustinian theodicy, based on free will, and the Irenaean theodicy, based on human development. Hick framed his theodicy as an attempt to respond to the problem of evil in light of scientific development, such as Darwin's theory of evolution, and as an alternative to the traditionally accepted Augustinian theodicy. Rejecting the idea that humans were created perfectly and then fell away from perfection, Hick instead argued that humans are still in the process of creation. He interpreted the fall of man, described in the book of Genesis, as a mythological description of the current state of humans.\n\nHick used Irenaeus' notion of two-stage creation and supported the belief that the second stage, being created into the likeness of God, is still in progress. He argued that to be created in the image of God means to have the potential for knowledge of and a relationship with God; this is fulfilled when creation in the likeness of God is complete. Humanity currently exists in the image of God and is being developed into spiritual maturity. Hick proposed that human morality is developed through the experience of evil and argued that it is possible for humans to know God, but only if they choose to out of their own free will. Hick acknowledges that some suffering seems to serve no constructive purpose and instead just damages the individual. Hick justifies this by appealing to the concept of mystery. He argues that, if suffering was always beneficial to humans, it would be impossible for humans to develop compassion or sympathy because we would know that someone who is suffering will certainly benefit from it. However, if there is an element of mystery to suffering, to the effect that some people suffer without benefit, it allows feelings of compassion and sympathy to emerge.\n\nThe value Hick placed on free will was the result of his belief that it is necessary for genuine love: he believed that love which is not freely chosen is valueless. A genuinely loving God, he argued, would have created humans with free will. Hick held that it would be possible for God to create beings that would always freely choose to do good, but argued that a genuine relationship requires the possibility of rejection. Irenaeus' notion of humans existing at an \"epistemic distance\" from God also influenced Hick, as it would ensure a free choice in belief in God. Hick argued that a world without pain or suffering would prevent moral development; such a world would have no fixed structure, or have a structure subject to divine intervention, preventing humans from coming to any harm. Hick argued that this would leave humans unable to help or harm one another, allowing them no moral choices and so preventing moral development.\n\nThe nature of his theodicy required Hick to propose an eschatology in which humans are fully morally developed. He proposed a universalist theory, arguing that all humans would eventually reach heaven. Hick believed that there would be no benefit or purpose to an eternal Hell, as it would render any moral development inconsequential. The eternal suffering of Hell could not be explained in terms of human development, so Hick rejected it. Despite this, he did not reject the existence of Hell outright, as to do so could make living morally in this life irrelevant. Rather, he argued that Hell exists as a mythological concept and as a warning of the importance of this life.\n\nBritish philosopher Richard Swinburne proposed a version of the Irenaean theodicy based on his libertarian view of free will, a view that one's free actions are not caused by any outside agent. He argued that, in order for people to make free moral decisions, they must be aware of the consequences of such decisions. Knowledge of these consequences must be based on experience—Swinburne rejected the idea that God could implant such knowledge, arguing that humans would question its reliability. Swinburne argued that humans must have first hand experience of natural evil in order to understand the consequences of moral evil and that for God to give humans moral free will, he must allow human suffering. Swinburne conceived Hell as being a separation from God, rejecting the notion of eternal physical punishment, and argued that people who had chosen to reject God throughout their lives would continue to do so after death.\n\nThe development of process theology has presented a challenge to the Irenaean theodicy. The doctrine proposes that God is benevolent but suggests that his power is restricted to persuasion, rather than coercion and so is unable to prevent certain evil events from occurring. Process theology accepts God's indirect responsibility for evil, but maintains that he is blameless, and does everything in his power to bring about good. In his introduction to process theology, C. Robert Melse argued that, although suffering does sometimes bring about good, not all suffering is valuable and that most does more harm than good. Process theologian David Griffin contested \"the utility of soul making\". He argued that the Irenaean theodicy supposes that God inflicts pain for his own ends, which Griffin regarded as immoral.\n\nPhilosopher Dewi Zephaniah Phillips published \"The Problem of Evil and the Problem of God\" in 2004, presenting a challenge to the Irenaean theodicy. Phillips maintained throughout his work that humans are incapable of fully understanding God, and presented an understanding of the moral diversity of human existence. With reference to the suffering of the Holocaust, he rejected any theodicy which presents suffering as instrumental, arguing that such suffering cannot be justified, regardless of any good that comes of it.\n\nRussian novelist Fyodor Dostoyevsky presented a similar argument in his novel, \"The Brothers Karamazov\". This is however not a final argument, given the nature of Dostoyevsky's work as polyphonic. In the novel, the character Ivan Karamazov presents an account of incredible cruelty to innocent people and children to his theist brother, Alyosha. Following this, Ivan asks his brother if he would, hypothetically, choose to be the architect of the eternal happiness of mankind, which would come into existence, if, and only if he would torture an innocent child, a necessary evil, after which this eternal happiness would \ncome into existence. \nBut Dostoyevsky's work, polyphonic in nature, also states that the love Christ showed to all people and for all people, which is Alyosha's final stance in the novel, is the only good, and in the face of evil, the beauty that will save the world.\n\nWriting in the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Michael Tooley rejected the Irenaean theodicy as unsatisfactory. He argued that the magnitude of suffering experienced by some people is excessive, supporting Eleanor Stump's view that the suffering endured by those with terminal illnesses cannot be for moral development, and that such illnesses do not fall more often upon those seemingly immoral or in need of development. He also challenged the suffering both of animals and of young children. Neither of these instances of suffering serve any useful purpose, as they cannot lead to moral development. Finally, he questioned whether the current universe is the best possible world for the moral development of humans. Citing the examples of those who die young and those who experience too great a pain to learn from it, as well as people who suffer too little to learn anything, he suggested that this world is not ideally suited to human development.\n\nFrench theologian Henri Blocher criticised the universalism of John Hick's theory. Blocher argued that universalism contradicts free will, which is vital to the Irenaean theodicy, because, if everyone will receive salvation, humans cannot choose to reject God. Hick did attempt to address this issue: he argued that a free action is one which reflects that character of a person, and that humans were created with a \"Godward bias\", so would choose salvation. Blocher proposed that Hick must then accept a level of determinism, though not going all the way.\n\n"}
{"id": "829899", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=829899", "title": "Julien Offray de La Mettrie", "text": "Julien Offray de La Mettrie\n\nJulien Offray de La Mettrie (; November 23, 1709 – November 11, 1751) was a French physician and philosopher, and one of the earliest of the French materialists of the Enlightenment. He is best known for his work \"L'homme machine\" (\"Machine Man\").\n\nLa Mettrie was born at Saint-Malo in Brittany on November 23, 1709, and was the son of a prosperous textile merchant. His initial schooling took place in the colleges of Coutances and Caen. After attending the Collège du Plessis in Paris, he seemed to have acquired a vocational interest in becoming a clergyman, but after studying theology in the Jansenist schools for some years, his interests turned away from the Church. In 1725, La Mettrie entered the College d'Harcourt to study philosophy and natural science, probably graduating around 1728. At this time, D'Harcourt was pioneering the teaching of Cartesianism in France. In 1734, he went on to study under Hermann Boerhaave, a renowned physician who, similarly, had originally intended on becoming a clergyman. It was under Boerhaave that La Mettrie was influenced to try to bring changes to medical education in France.\n\nAfter his studies at D'Harcourt, La Mettrie decided to take up the profession of medicine. A friend of the La Mettrie family, François-Joseph Hunauld, who was about to take the chair of anatomy at the Jardin du Roi, seems to have influenced him in this decision. For five years, La Mettrie studied at faculty of medicine in Paris, and enjoyed the mentorship of Hunauld.\n\nIn 1733, however, he departed for Leiden to study under the famous Herman Boerhaave. His stay in Holland proved to be short but influential. In the following years, La Mettrie settled down to professional medical practice in his home region of Saint-Malo, disseminating the works and theories of Boerhaave through the publication and translation of several works. He married in 1739 but the marriage, which produced two children, proved an unhappy one. In 1742 La Mettrie left his family and travelled to Paris, where he obtained the appointment of surgeon to the Gardes Françaises regiment, taking part in several battles during the War of the Austrian Succession. This experience would instill in him a deep aversion to violence which is evident in his philosophical writings. Much of his time, however, was spent in Paris, and it is likely that during this time he made the acquaintance of Maupertuis and the Marquise de Châtelet.\n\nIt was in these years, during an attack of fever, that he made observations on himself with reference to the action of quickened blood circulation upon thought, which led him to the conclusion that mental processes were to be accounted for as the effects of organic changes in the brain and nervous system. This conclusion he worked out in his earliest philosophical work, the \"Histoire naturelle de l'âme\" (1745). So great was the outcry caused by its publication that La Mettrie was forced to quit his position with the French Guards, taking refuge in Leiden. There he developed his doctrines still more boldly and completely in \"L'Homme machine\", a hastily written treatise based upon consistently materialistic and quasi-atheistic principles. La Mettrie's materialism was in many ways the product of his medical concerns, drawing on the work of 17th-century predecessors such as the Epicurean physician Guillaume Lamy.\n\nThe ethical implications of these principles would later be worked out in his \"Discours sur le bonheur\"; La Mettrie considered it his \"magnum opus\". Here he developed his \"theory of remorse\", i.e. his view about the inauspicious effects of the feelings of guilt acquired at early age during the process of enculturation. This was the idea which brought him the enmity of virtually all thinkers of the French Enlightenment, and a \"damnatio memoriae\" which was lifted only a century later by Friedrich Albert Lange in his \"Geschichte des Materialismus\".\n\nJulien de La Mettrie is considered one of the most influential determinists of the eighteenth century. Along with aiding the furthering of determinism he considered himself a mechanistic materialist.\n\nHe believed that mental processes were caused by the body. He expressed these thoughts in his most important work \"Man a Machine\". There he also expressed his belief that humans worked like a machine. This theory can be considered to build off the work of Descartes and his approach to the human body working as a machine. La Mettrie believed that man, body and mind, worked like a machine. Although he helped further Descartes' view of mechanization in explaining human bodily behavior, he argued against Descartes' dualistic view on the mind. His opinions were so strong that he stated that Descartes was actually a materialist in regards to the mind.\n\nPrior to \"Man a Machine\" he published \"The Natural History of the Soul\" in 1745. He argued that humans were just complex animals. A great deal of controversy emerged due to his belief that \"from animals to man there is no abrupt transition\". He later built of that idea claiming that humans and animals were composed of organized matter. He believed that humans and animals were only different in regards to the complexity that matter was organized. He compared the differences between man and animal to those of high quality pendulum clocks and watches stating: \"[Man] is to the ape, and to the most intelligent animals, as the planetary pendulum of Huygens is to a watch of Julien Le Roy\". The idea that essentially no real difference between humans and animals existed was based on his findings that sensory feelings were present in animals and plants. While he did recognize that only humans spoke a language, he thought that animals were capable of learning a language. He used apes as an example, stating that if they were trained they would be \"perfect [men]\". He further expressed his ideas that man was not very different from animals by suggesting that we learn through imitation as do animals.\n\nHis beliefs about humans and animals were based on two types of continuity. The first being weak continuity, suggesting that humans and animals are made of the same things but are organized differently. His main emphasis however was on strong continuity, the idea that the psychology and behavior between humans and animals was not all that different.\n\nLa Mettrie believed that man worked like a machine due to mental thoughts depending on bodily actions. He then argued that the organization of matter at a high and complex level resulted in human thought. He did not believe in the existence of God. He rather chose to argue that the organization of humans was done to provide the best use of complex matter as possible.\n\nLa Mettrie arrived at this belief after finding that his bodily and mental illnesses were associated with each other. After gathering enough evidence, in medical and psychological fields, he published the book.\n\nSome of the evidence La Mettrie presented was disregarded due to the nature of it. He argued that events such as a beheaded chicken running around or a recently removed heart of an animal still working proved the connection between the brain and the body. While theories did build off La Mettrie's, his works were not necessarily scientific. Rather, his writings were controversial and defiant.\n\nHe further expressed his radical beliefs by asserting himself as a determinist, dismissing the use of judges. He disagreed with Christian beliefs and emphasized the importance of going after sensual pleasure, a hedonistic approach to human behavior. He further looked at human behavior by questioning the belief that humans have a higher sense of morality than animals. He noted that animals rarely tortured each other and argued that some animals were capable of some level of morality. He believed that as machines, humans would follow the law of nature and ignore their own interests for those of others.\n\nLa Mettrie most directly influenced Pierre Jean Georges Cabanis, a prominent French physician. He worked off La Mettrie's materialistic views but modified them to not be as extreme. La Mettrie's extreme beliefs, were rejected strongly, but his work did help influence psychology, specifically behaviorism. His influence is seen in the reductionist approach of behavioral psychologists. However, the backlash he received was so strong that many behaviorists knew very little to nothing about La Mettrie and rather built off other materialists with similar arguments.\n\n La Mettrie's hedonistic and materialistic principles caused outrage even in the relatively tolerant Netherlands. So strong was the feeling against him that in 1748 he was compelled to leave for Berlin, where, thanks in part to the offices of Maupertuis, the Prussian king Frederick the Great not only allowed him to practice as a physician, but appointed him court reader. There La Mettrie wrote the \"Discours sur le bonheur\" (1748), which appalled leading Enlightenment thinkers such as Voltaire, Diderot and D'Holbach due to its explicitly hedonistic sensualist principles which prioritised the unbridled pursuit of pleasure above all other things.\n\nLa Mettrie's celebration of sensual pleasure was said to have resulted in his early death. The French ambassador to Prussia, Tirconnel, grateful to La Mettrie for curing him of an illness, held a feast in his honour. It was claimed that La Mettrie wanted to show either his power of gluttony or his strong constitution by devouring a large quantity of \"pâté de faisan aux truffes\". As a result, he developed a gastric illness of some sort. Soon after he began suffering from a severe fever and eventually died.\n\nFrederick the Great gave the funeral oration, which remains the major biographical source on La Mettrie's life. He declared: \"La Mettrie died in the house of Milord Tirconnel, the French plenipotentiary, whom he had restored to life. It seems that the disease, knowing with whom it had to deal, was cunning enough to attack him first by the brain, in order to destroy him the more surely. A violent fever with fierce delirium came on. The invalid was obliged to have recourse to the science of his colleagues, but he failed to find the succor that his own skill had so often afforded as well to himself as to the public\".\" Frederick further described him as a good devil and medic but a very bad author. He was survived by his wife and a 5-year-old daughter.\n\nLa Mettrie's collected \"Œuvres philosophiques\" appeared after his death in several editions, published in London, Berlin and Amsterdam.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2730395", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2730395", "title": "Latihan", "text": "Latihan\n\nLatihan (from Indonesian \"latihan kejiwaan\"; \"spiritual exercise\") is a form of spiritual practice. It is the principal practice of the Subud organization.\n\nThe origin of the practice is associated with Javanese \"kebatinan\" or \"kejawen\" tradition.\n\n\"Latihan kejiwaan\" (or simply \"latihan\") means \"spiritual exercise\", or \"training of the spirit\". This exercise is not thought about, learned or trained for; it is unique for each person and the ability to 'receive' it is passed on by being in the presence of another person who aready practises it at the 'opening'. About twice a week, Subud members go to a local center to participate in a group latihan, men and women separately. The experience takes place in a room or a hall with open space. After a period of sitting quietly, the members are typically asked to stand and relax by a 'helper', who then announces the start of the exercise.\n\nPractitioners are advised to surrender to the Divine and follow 'what arises from within', not expecting anything in advance. One is recommended not to focus on any image or recite any mantra, nor to mix the exercise with other activities like meditation or use of drugs, but simply to intend to surrender to the Divine or the will of God. (The term \"God\" is used here with a broad and inclusive intention. An individual is at liberty to substitute interpretations that they feel more in tune with.) One is not to pay attention to others in the room, each of whom is doing his or her own latihan. During the exercise, practitioners may find that, in terms of physical and emotional expression, they involuntarily move, make sounds, walk around, dance, jump, skip, laugh, cry or whatever. The experience varies greatly for different people, but the practitioner is always wholly conscious throughout and free to stop the exercise at any time.\n\nOutwardly the exercise often manifests as physical movement and vocal activity that vary greatly both over time and between individuals. It proceeds spontaneously, involving neither teacher nor method, being unstructured except for basic rules relating to group practice.\n\nPersonal capacity to engage in \"latihan\" the first time, in what is called the \"opening\", is said to be transmitted by the presence of experienced practitioners. It usually entails an attitude of patience and trust, typically with some preparatory relaxation of thoughts and feelings, and involves the whole human being, not just body, emotions, mind or any other single facet.\n\nIt is regarded by practitioners as being of spiritual or psychological benefit, depending on personal interpretation and individual experience though apparently it does not affect all practitioners and may affect some detrimentally. Many practitioners see \"latihan\" as a way of direct access to a mystical experience that is compatible with a busy modern lifestyle.\n\nWhile the opinions of Subud's founder are often cited among its members, the organization officially endorses no doctrine regarding latihan's nature or benefits. Practitioners tend to agree that the exercise is best experienced with minimal theorizing or mental imagery.\n\nAlthough \"latihan\" can be practiced alone, Subud arranges regular practice in group settings. Normally sessions are held two or three times a week and last thirty minutes, with the two sexes segregated. Subud offers formal pragmatic, preliminary advice in relation to commencing the practice. Non-members are not allowed to witness Subud \"latihan\" sessions as they are considered private.\n\nSubud's founder speculated that the spontaneous movements which characterise \"latihan\" are similar in character to early meetings of the Religious Society of Friends which gave rise to the name Quakers.\n\nThe use of \"latihan\" is also included by Vladimir Antonov in his program of raja yoga. He states that raja yoga is a stage of spiritual work aimed at, among other things, purifying the body from coarse energies, and refining oneself as a consciousness to the level of being able to experience samadhi (the bliss of contact with God).\n\nThe method of \"latihan\" consists in feeling the Holy Spirit (Te, Brahmin, etc.) above oneself as Living Light—and asking It to flow through one's body from above. By surrendering to this flow, the body can start making spontaneous movements with the arms, hands, etc. \"Latihan\" is sometimes referred to by the name 'spontaneous dance', due to the movements of the body that can happen while surrendering to the flow of light.\n\n\"Latihan\" can also be classified as a meditation of the 'Laya' type, i.e. as a means of dissolving oneself in Living God.\n\nThe method was later adopted by Osho (Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh), who made use of many spiritual methods. He viewed \"latihan\" as potentially beneficial, capable of cleansing the mind, yet incomplete and potentially dangerous to mental health since it involved surrender of self-control. He therefore incorporated it as a stage of longer \"active meditations\", advocating the maintenance of a \"witnessing consciousness\", following \"latihan\" with a period of complete rest and preceding it with one of several techniques intended to promote an autohypnotic trance, and further recommended that, when practising in groups, both sexes should practise together. Preliminary methods used include listening to quiet music, or else a breathing exercise intended to increase blood carbon dioxide levels followed by fifteen minutes looking at a strobe light while listening to music, both of these running at seven times the rate of the heart-beat in order to create an entrainment to alpha wave brain-state. It may also be followed by a form of wordless prayer. He agreed that it was easiest to learn in the presence of someone already experienced in the method.\n\n"}

Her PhD thesis - of which the whole content had been elaborated beforehand in Bucharest and sent to Louis de Broglie - contains the first and very elaborated invalidation of von Neumann's famous proof asserting the impossibility of hidden parameters compatible with the quantum mechanical formalism. This work was published in a volume prefaced by Louis de Broglie and published in the collection \"Les grands problèmes des sciences\", Gauthiers Villars, Paris, 1964.Since that time, a professor of theoretical physics in France\n\nAccording to the terms of Mugur-Schächter, this method is \"a new discipline: a representation of the process of conceptualization rooted directly into the a-conceptual physical reality – far beneath languages – and the character of which is resolutely methodological and formalizing. The whole qualitative essence of the descriptions of microstates, wherefrom nowadays microphysics draws its remarkable powers, is incorporated in this method. Inside the framework of this method, the processes of conceptualization are represented by qualitative constructive algorithms, which exclude a priori any vagueness and illusory problems\".\n\nThe method of Relativized Conceptualization (as it is best exposed in \"Sur le tissage des connaissance\") leads to a unification between the MRC-(genetic and relativized) logic and the MRC concept of (genetic relativized) probabilities.\n\nThe method furthermore leads to an algorithm for constructing a relativized concept of a factual probability law (Mathematical Structures in Computer Science /June 2014 - Volume 24, Special Issue 03, Developments of the Concepts of Randomness, Statistic and Probability, Mioara Mugur-Schächter invited editor, Preface, article \"On the Concept of Probability\", organizer of a common final debate). \nThe general method of relativized conceptualization also elucidates where and how meaning is involved inside Shannon’s theory of communication of information ( ). And it allows yields a definition of relativized mathematical measures of complexity that preserve the involved semantic contents ( chapter 8).\n\nThe infra-quantum mechanics (in French) offers a strictly qualitative description of microstates constructed quite independently of the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics, under – exclusively – the constraints imposed by: (a) the cognitive situation in which is placed a human being who wants to create knowledge concerning non-perceivable “microstates”, and (b) the general requirements of the human ways of conceptualizing. Those who know the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics can clearly discern the general features of the quantum mechanical algorithms inside the qualitative descriptional structure obtained in the above-mentioned way. But they will also discern features that are occulted by these algorithms, even though they are endowed with major semantic importance. \nThe epistemological/operational/methodological discipline called infra-quantum mechanics offers from now on \"a reference structure\" for a face-à-face with the quantum mechanical formalism, that is elaborated outside this formalism and permits to dissolve in one single block, in a mutually coherent way, -----all the problems of “interpretation” raised by the formalism since nearly 80 years.\n\nThe work titled \"Principles of a 2nd Quantum Mechanics ( still in French only) effectively realizes the above-mentioned face-à-face. (\"A thoroughly improved version containing a long abstract in English is now available on http://www.mugur-schachter.net/\" and http://www.admiroutes.asso.fr/larevue/2014/149/mq2.htm).\n\nPRINCIPLES OF A SECOND QUANTUM MECHANICS rooted in factuality via computational assistance : , a very concise and notably improved English reformulation of all the preceding versions.\n\nThis new version of QM2 suggests the possibility of a quite general way of constructing for any physical entity consensual and verifiable scientific probabilistic descriptions mathematically representable in a conveniently chosen Hilbert space.\n\n\n"}

It tends to arise only in governments that feature a strong separation of powers, such as in the United States, and is much rarer in governments where such powers are partly or wholly fused. In the context of lawsuits, executive nonacquiescence in judicial decisions can lead to bizarre Kafkaesque situations where parties discover to their chagrin that their legal victory over the government is an empty one. Nonacquiescence can also possibly lead to a constitutional crisis, given certain critical situations and decisions.\n\nIn the United States, certain federal agencies are notorious for practicing nonacquiescence (essentially, ignoring court decisions that go against them and refusing to accept their validity as binding precedent). The Social Security Administration and the Internal Revenue Service are particularly well known for such conduct. Although executive nonacquiescence has been heavily criticized by the federal courts, as well as the American Bar Association, the U.S. Congress has not yet been able to pass a bill formally prohibiting or punishing such behavior.\n\nThe U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) uses the term \"nonacquiescence\" in its actions on decision to indicate that the IRS disagrees with a court ruling and will not follow its precedent nationwide. This does not necessarily mean that the IRS will refuse to follow the ruling of the court on that particular case; rather it means that the IRS will not apply the ruling to \"other\" cases. In some cases of nonacquiesence, the IRS may follow the decision's precedent within the jurisdiction of the case in question, but not apply it in other jurisdictions.\n\n"}

John Eliot of Roxbury, Massachusetts, known as the “Apostle to the Indians.”\n\nHe was born October 17, 1626, in Framlingham, Suffolk, England, the sixth of seven children of Nicholas Danforth (1589–1639) and Elizabeth Symmes Danforth (c.1596–1629). Six surviving children— Elizabeth (1619–1673), Anna (1622–1704), Thomas (1623–1699), Lydia (1625–1686), Samuel, and Jonathan (1628–1712) —emigrated with their father to Massachusetts in 1634. After their father died in 1639, Samuel lived with Thomas Shepard, pastor of the church in Cambridge, and later attended Harvard College, where he graduated in 1643 and remained as a tutor until 1650, whereupon he became one of the five founding Fellows of Harvard.\n\nDanforth's studies included astronomy, and during this time he published three almanacs (for 1647, 1648, and 1649), which are the earliest surviving American examples of the form. A fourth (for the year 1646) is also attributed to him, although the single surviving copy is missing the first several pages and any attribution. These almanacs included his own original poetry (some in the form of enigmas or word puzzles), and are among the earliest examples of secular verse published in New England. They also contained—in addition to celestial tables, tide tables, calendars, and dates of court sessions—brief chronologies of significant events in New England's history. In 1650 he became pastor at The First Church in Roxbury, where Rev. John Eliot was Teaching Elder, and was ordained on September 24, 1650. In 1651, he married Mary Wilson (1633–1713), daughter of the Rev. John Wilson of Boston, with whom he had twelve children in 24 years. He died November 19, 1674.\n\nNo copies of his \"Catechism\" (published in 1650 or 1651) are known to have survived (see Roden, \"The Cambridge Press 1638-1692\"). He published An Astronomical Description of the Late Comet in 1665 (reprinted in London the following year). In 1670, he was invited to give the annual election sermon to the General Assembly, which was afterwards printed as A Brief Recognition Recognition of New-Englands Errand into the Wilderness and is regarded as one of the finest examples of the “jeremiad” form. In April 1674, he delivered what is regarded as the first published “execution sermon”:The Cry of Sodom Enquired Into, on the occasion of the sentencing to death by hanging of Benjamin Goad, a young man from his congregation convicted of bestiality upon being discovered in a compromised position with a lady-horse. This work was published shortly after his death.\n\nWilliam Sprague, in his \"Annals of the American Pulpit\" (I, 139), describes him as follows: “As a preacher, he was remarkable for sustaining all his positions by arguments from Scripture; for adhering closely to the main object before him; for a free, clear and rapid utterance; and for a depth and power of feeling which in almost every sermon manifested itself in tears. ... He was particularly watchful against the inroads of immorality among the young. He used his influence to prevent any, except persons of correct moral habits, from keeping houses of public entertainment; and when he saw from his study window any of the people of the town tippling at the tavern, he made conscience to go directly to them and administer a pointed rebuke.”\n\nThree of Danforth’s children died in infancy—Samuel (aged 7 months) in 1653, Thomas (aged 10 days) in 1672, and Elizabeth (aged 2 weeks) in 1673). Three others—Mary (aged 5 years), Elizabeth (aged 3), and Sarah (aged 1)—died in December 1659. His funeral remarks on this occasion were reprinted by Cotton Mather in his \"Magnalia\". Two more children—Elizabeth (aged 7) and Sarah (aged 2)—died in October 1672. His son John (1660–1730) graduated from Harvard College in 1677 and was minister at Dorchester from 1682 until his death. The other surviving son, Samuel (1666–1727), graduated from Harvard College in 1683, and served as the minister at Taunton from 1687 until his death. Daughter Mary (1663–1734) married Edward Bromfield (1649–1734) in 1683. Daughter Abiel, born two months after her father’s death, married Thomas Fitch in 1694, and, after his death, John Osborn in 1741; she died in or before 1745.\n\nHis widow Mary was married in 1682 to Joseph Rock of Boston, who died the next year.\n\nHis older brother Thomas Danforth (1623–1699) was treasurer of Harvard College, deputy governor, and justice of the colony’s superior court. His younger brother Jonathan was a resident and founder of Billerica, Massachusetts. Sister Elizabeth married Andrew Belcher (1639–1673) of Cambridge; sister Anna married Matthew Bridge (1615–1700) of Lexington; sister Lydia married William Beamont (1608–1698) of Saybrook, Connecticut; and sister Mary Danforth, who also came over to the Americas with Samuel, married John Parish.

It is an evolving practice in which Christians, Jews, Muslims, and sometimes members of other faiths, meet to study their sacred scriptures together, and to explore the ways in which such study can help them understand and respond to particular contemporary issues. Originally developed by theologians and religious philosophers as a means of fostering post-critical and postliberal corrections to patterns of modern reasoning, it has now spread beyond academic circles.\n\nScriptural Reasoning involves participants from multiple religious traditions meeting, very often in small groups, to read and discuss passages from their sacred texts (e.g., Tanakh, the New Testament, and the Qur'an). The texts will often relate to a common topic - say, the figure of Abraham, or consideration of legal and moral issues of property-holding. Participants discuss the content of the texts, and will often explore the variety of ways in which their religious communities have worked with them and continue to work with them, and the ways in which those texts might shape their understanding of and engagement with a range of contemporary issues.\n\nA participant from any one religious tradition might therefore:\n\n\nScriptural Reasoning has sometimes been described as a \"tent of meeting\" - a Biblical \"mishkan\" (Heb. משׁכן Ara. مسكن) - a reference to the story of Genesis 18. Steven Kepnes, a Jewish philosopher, writes:\n\nParticipants in SR practice come to it as both representatives of academic institutions and particular \"houses\" (churches, mosques, synagogues) of worship. SR meets, however, outside of these institutions and houses in special times and in separate spaces that are likened to Biblical \"tents of meeting\". Practitioners come together in these tents of meeting to read and reason with scriptures. They then return to their academic and religious institutions and to the world with renewed energy and wisdom for these institutions and the world.\n\nAs originally conceived, SR was an academic practice involving theologians, religious philosophers, and text scholars, and was said to be aimed at 'repairing' or 'correcting' patterns of modern philosophical and theological reasoning. That is, it was seen not only as a form of interfaith dialogue, but also as a form of philosophical or theological reasoning. It has often been described as a 'postliberal' or 'postcritical' theological or philosophical movement. Its purpose is sometimes described more simply as that of promoting the growth of 'wisdom', or, more simply still, as 'humbling and creative' interfaith encounter or 'deeper mutual understanding'.\n\nMost forms of SR exhibit the following basic features:\n\n\nThe term \"Scriptural Reasoning\" was coined by Peter Ochs to name a group who now form the Society for Scriptural Reasoning (SSR) The founders of this international group, formed in 1995, include Ochs himself, David F. Ford and Daniel W. Hardy Its origins lie in a related practice, \"Textual Reasoning\" (\"TR\"), which involved Jewish philosophers reading Talmud in conversation with scholars of rabbinics. Peter Ochs was one of the leading participants in Textual Reasoning.\n\nThe core practice of interfaith biblical study resembles already existing practices, such as that of the International Theology Conference at the Shalom Hartman Institute in Jerusalem.\n\nThe Scriptural Reasoning Society is an independent network of SR activity in the UK, not affiliated to the international Society for Scriptural Reasoning described above.\n\nIn 2007, independent Islamic authorities in London issued a fatwa advising Muslims about participation in the practice of Scriptural Reasoning.\n\nScriptural Reasoning began as an academic practice. Examples of academic SR include the Scriptural Reasoning Group of the American Academy of Religion, the Scriptural Reasoning in the University group (which evolved from the Scriptural Reasoning Theory Group ), Scriptural Reasoning project at the Center for Theological Inquiry in Princeton, the Scriptures in Dialogue project founded by Leo Baeck College, and the SR Oxford group of the Scriptural Reasoning Society (\"Oxford School\") founded by the Centre for Muslim-Christian Studies, Oxford and the Interfaith Alliance UK.\n\nScriptural Reasoning has also become a \"civic practice\" in the community, examples of which include the Central Virginia Scriptural Reasoning Group sponsored by Eastern Mennonite University, at St Ethelburga's Centre for Reconciliation and Peace at St Ethelburga's Bishopsgate, the SR Camden and SR Westminster groups of the Scriptural Reasoning Society sponsored by Camden Faith Communities Partnership, Liberal Judaism (United Kingdom) and different places of worship in London.\n\nCivic developments from Scriptural Reasoning carrying different names, include the Faith and Citizenship programme of London Metropolitan University, and Tools for Trialogue, a youth project of the Three Faiths Forum, which develops modes of scriptural study for young people in schools and local communities.\n\nTheologian Adrian Thatcher has questioned whether Scriptural Reasoning flattens theological differences in the way the three traditions approach their respective Scriptures, noting especially \"the paucity of references to Jesus Christ\" in the essays in \"The Promise of Scriptural Reasoning\" (see, e.g., Ford and Pecknold 2006), and asking whether this \"may indicate … the further erosion of Christocentric biblical interpretation.\"\n\nAnother theologian, James M. Gustafson, questions the claim he believes implied by Peter Ochs' descriptions of Scriptural Reasoning that it \"has not only the capacity, but also the authority to correct 'modernist reason'\" – and asking whether Scriptural Reasoning has been sufficiently open to the critical discourses fostered in modernity. His claims have been responded to directly by S. Mark Heim.\n\nChristina Grenholm and Daniel Patte ask whether SR \"presupposes a view of Christianity as a separate nation with clear borders and set markers\" and whether it lacks a \"critical perspective that would reveal that there are different kinds of 'scriptural reasonings.'\"\n\n\n"}

Sundaranand lived with Swami Tapovan in the then inaccessible area of Gangotri, at the source of the Ganges, which is considered one of India's most sacred places.\n\nSince 1948, he has lived by the Ganges in Gangotri, at 10,400 feet, in a modest hut (\"kuti\") which his master Swami Tapovan Maharaj later bequeathed to him on his death in 1957. There, Swami Sundaranand has lived in solitude and through the severest of winters without any comforts or conveniences. He has witnessed up close the gradual shrinking of the Gangotri Glacier from which the Ganges springs forth, and has chronicled his devotion to the natural beauty of the Indian Himalayas as an accomplished photographer. A museum devoted to environmental protection and spiritual guidance, containing Swami Sundaranand's Himalayan photography, is now in the planning stages. It will be located in Gangotri on the property of Sundaranand and his master.\n\nAs an ascetic, he took the brahmacharya sadhu vow over 59 years ago and daily devotes his life to rigorous meditation and other spiritual practices. He continues to be a principal advocate for the ecological preservation of the Himalayas, the Ganges and its source at Gangotri.\n\nHe has taken more than 100,000 photos, over a 50-year period, of the shrinking Gangotri glacier in the Indian Himalayas. He now travels India raising awareness of the Gangotri's rapid decline.\n\nNicknamed \"the \"Sadhu\" Who Clicks\" because of his photography, he is also a noted mountain climber, having scaled over 25 Himalayan peaks, and climbing twice with Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay. Sir Edmund Hillary paid his respects to Swami Sundaranad in the 1980s at his Gangotri hut. Of the Gangotri glacier, Swami Sundaranand says:\n\nIn 1949, when I first saw the glacier, I felt as if all my sins were washed away and I had truly attained rebirth. But now, it is impossible to experience that Ganga of the past.\n\nSwami Sundaranand is the author of the book \"Himalaya: Through the Lens of a Sadhu\" with over 425 photographs spanning 60 years of his work. The book also contains a letter of endorsement from the former Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. He sought to capture the Eternal in Nature and to document the region as it once was with a special emphasis on planting the seeds of hope and inspiration to solve the environmental concerns of the area. A lookout point and plaque have been built downriver from Gangotri and dedicated to the Swami's work and efforts.\n\nSwami Sundaranand is the subject of a feature documentary shot at his home in Gangotri titled \"Personal Time with Swamiji\". The film was produced by The Center for Healing Arts and directed by Victor Demko.\n\nOver the past six decades, Swami Sundaranand has used his combined interests to raise awareness about the Ganga. \"When I first came to this region, it was one of the most beautiful part of the Himalayas,\" he says. \"It is difficult to imagine the purity of the Ganga and the abundance of Himalayan vegetation and fauna that was prevalent then. We don't know what we have cruelly destroyed.\"\n\nSwami Sundaranand has lived in Gangotri since 1948, when he became a renunciate, and arrived there from Andhra Pradesh. In his words: \"A lot has changed since then. Although the air is cold here, the sun is harsh. It's becoming hotter every year. People say it is global warming. I say it is a global warning.\"\n\nThe pollution of Ganga in the plains has been an oft-repeated refrain, but, according to Sundaranand, a graver threat is its pollution at the source. He attributes this to the unchecked construction of hotels and \"ashrams\" in Gangotri and the dumping of waste from these locations, such as faecal matter and garbage, into the Ganga. According to him, \"there are no environment lovers left here, only money lovers\". Every year, while the temple town closes during the harsh winter months, unchecked construction and felling of trees is at its peak. According to the sadhu, \"many bhoj trees in Bhojbasa, en route Gaumukh have been cut down. Earlier, on my treks to the Gaumukh glacier, I could spot rare animals like the snow leopard and musk deer. They are rarely visible now\".\n\nThe sadhu is also an avid mountaineer — it was during his treks to the glacier over the last 10–15 years that he saw the glacier retreat more rapidly than ever before. According to him, Gaumukh was barely 1 km away from Bhojbasa, but today, it is 4 km away and that every year, the glacier was retreating by at least 10 metres. He has expreseed the view that the pollution of Ganga at its source and melting Himalayan glaciers were the real issues that environmentalists needed to urgently take up, rather than opposing the construction of dams.\n\nSwami Sundaranand has a strong connection with the Himalayas that few others have. He has climbed dozens of its peaks, several of them over 21,000 feet above sea level, and has lectured at Tensing's Himalayan Institute (a famous mountaineering school). He is also a skilled naturalist that is familiar with thousands of Himalayan plants and he knows the lore and medicinal uses of these species.\n\nHe engages in 3 hours of meditation during the day, and may meditate at night into the early hours of the morning. The most important parts of his life are meditation, \"japa\" and \"pranayama\". As a younger man he was an accomplished \"hatha\" yogi, mastering 300 postures, and he continues to practice it daily. He is very devoted to the ecosystem in which he has lived for forty years and believes that \"God does not reside in temples or mosques - he is scattered everywhere in the courtyard of nature.\"\n\n"}

He credited Nagel with consolidating the rival insights of logical positivism and pragmatism, demonstrating how four different kinds of explanation function in different types of inquiry, refuting the view that science does nothing more than describe \"sequences of phenomena\", and convincingly criticizing Berlin. However, he argued that Nagel's account of science was strained and that some of Nagel's views were unclear. He believed that Nagel was less successful in discussing sociology and history than he was in discussing the natural sciences. He also charged Nagel with vacillating between the \"mechanistic\" view of social knowledge and that of \"pragmatic pluralism\", arguing that each of these perspectives has merit, but only when adopted with full commitment.\n\n\"The Structure of Science\" was reviewed by G. B. Keene in \"Philosophy\" and the philosopher Paul Feyerabend in the \"British Journal for the Philosophy of Science\". The book was also discussed by Colin Klein in \"The Philosophical Quarterly\", Grażyna Musiał in the \"Journal of Economics & Management\", and the philosopher Kenneth F. Schaffner in \"The Journal of Philosophy\".\n\nKlein wrote that discussions of the role of reduction in scientific explanation published after the book moved away from Nagel's views, because of \"perceived shortcomings in Nagel’s theory of reduction.\" He argued that the trend away from Nagel's views has been a mistake. In his view, while \"Nagel’s account of reduction has a number of flaws\" Nagel's \"account of intertheoretic connection is largely correct.\" Musiał wrote that the book is \"a source of inspiring conclusions\" and is regarded as one of the \"fundamental works on the contemporary methodology of science.\" She added that Nagel's conception of scientific theories is \"considered classical and as such, worth of detailed analysis\" and that Nagel's \"position left numerous opened questions that were further developed\" by other authors, and concluded that Nagel's book is \"still a valuable reading for junior\nresearch workers in economics who wish to reinforce their knowledge.\" Schaffner noted that \"Nagel's theory is based on the reduction of classical thermodynamics to statistical mechanics\" and that criticisms of his theory \"are based on the application of the reductionist mode of thinking to genetics, statistics and the concept of multiple realizability\".\n\nThe philosopher Adolf Grünbaum criticized Nagel for misinterpreting the philosopher of science Henri Poincaré in \"Philosophical Problems of Space and Time\" (1973). The philosopher Douglas Hofstadter described Nagel's book as a classic in the philosophy of science in \"Gödel, Escher, Bach\" (1979). He praised it for Nagel's discussions of reductionism and holism and teleological and non-telological explanations. The historian Peter Gay praised \"The Structure of Science\" as an important book and a clear exposition of positivism in \"Style in History\" (1974). He credited Nagel with refuting opposing points of view. Gay wrote in \"Reading Freud\" (1990) that Nagel's work is a book on which \"many of us grew up\", and that it \"remains valuable\". He noted that while Nagel was \"no Freudian\", the closing sentence of \"The Structure of Science\" paraphrases the famous last paragraph of Sigmund Freud's \"The Future of an Illusion\" (1927).\n\nThe philosopher Roger Scruton praised Nagel's discussion of the \"dispute over the nature of theories and theoretical terms\" in \"Modern Philosophy: An Introduction and Survey\" (1994). The philosopher Isaac Levi described \"The Structure of Science\" as a well-known classic in its field in \"The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy\" (1999). The philosopher Michael Ruse described \"The Structure of Science\" as Nagel's \"definitive work\" in \"The Oxford Companion to Philosophy\" (2005). However, he maintained that Thomas S. Kuhn's \"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\" (1962) discredited Nagel's approach to the philosophy of science.\n\n"}
{"id": "1181844", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1181844", "title": "Thomas Pogge", "text": "Thomas Pogge\n\nThomas Winfried Menko Pogge (; born 13 August 1953) is a German philosopher and is the Director of the Global Justice Program and Leitner Professor of Philosophy and International Affairs at Yale University. In addition to his Yale appointment, he is the Research Director of the Centre for the Study of the Mind in Nature at the University of Oslo, a Professorial Research Fellow at the Centre for Applied Philosophy and Public Ethics at Charles Sturt University and Professor of Political Philosophy at the University of Central Lancashire's Centre for Professional Ethics. Pogge is also an editor for social and political philosophy for the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy and a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters.\n\nPogge received his Ph.D. from Harvard University with a dissertation supervised by John Rawls. Since then, he has published widely on Immanuel Kant and in moral and political philosophy, including various books on Rawls and global justice.\n\nIn this book, Thomas Pogge and Aidan Hollis argue in favour of establishing the Health Impact Fund (HIF). The HIF is a new proposal for stimulating research and development of life-saving pharmaceuticals that make substantial reductions in the global burden of disease.\n\nThe HIF will provide pharmaceutical companies with a new choice. Pharmaceutical companies can sell a new medicine in the usual manner at patent-protected high prices, or they can choose to register their new medicine with the HIF and sell it globally at the cost of production. If they choose to register their medicine with the HIF, the pharmaceutical company will receive additional payments from the fund that are proportionate to health improvements that are brought about by the registered medicines. The more effective the medicine is in improving global health, the bigger the payout. Because malaria kills millions, the firm that finds and develops a cure can expect a significant return.\n\nPogge’s \"World Poverty and Human Rights\" (2002) includes a number of original and substantial theses, the most notable being that people in wealthy Western liberal democracies (such as Western Europeans) are currently harming the world’s poor (like those in sub-Saharan Africa). In particular, without denying that much blame should be directed at domestic kleptocrats, Pogge urges us to recognize the ways in which international institutions facilitate and exacerbate the corruption perpetuated by national institutions. Pogge is especially critical of the “resource” and “borrowing” privileges, which allow illegitimate political leaders to sell natural resources and to borrow money in the name of the country and its people. In Pogge’s analysis, these resource and borrowing privileges that international society extends to oppressive rulers of impoverished states play a crucial causal role in perpetuating absolute poverty. What is more, Pogge maintains that these privileges are no accident; they persist because they are in the interest of the wealthy states. The resource privilege helps guarantee a reliable supply of raw materials for the goods enjoyed by the members of wealthy states, and the borrowing privilege allows the financial institutions of wealthy states to issue lucrative loans. It may seem that such loans are good for developing states too, but Pogge argues that, in practice, they typically work quite to the contrary:\n\nLocal elites can afford to be oppressive and corrupt, because, with foreign loans and military aid, they can stay in power even without popular support. And they are often so oppressive and corrupt, because it is, in light of the prevailing extreme international inequalities, far more lucrative for them to cater to the interests of foreign governments and firms than to those of their impoverished compatriots.\n\nIn \"Realizing Rawls\", Pogge defends, criticizes and extends John Rawls’s \"A Theory of Justice\" (1971). Pogge insists that Rawls has been importantly misunderstood by his most influential critics, including the libertarian Robert Nozick and the communitarian Michael Sandel. According to Pogge, Rawls’ reluctance to disagree sharply with his critics has helped these (mis)understandings to become widespread, and has also induced Rawls in his more recent work to dilute the moral statement of his central Rawlsian ideas: first, that moral deliberation must begin from reflection upon the justice of our basic social institutions; and second, that the justice of an institutional scheme is to be assessed by how well its least advantaged participants fare. From these starting points, Pogge develops his own specification of Rawls’s principles of justice, discussing the relative importance of different fundamental rights and liberties, the ideal constitution of the political process, and the just organization of educational, health-care, and economic institutions. In the last part of the book, Pogge argues for extending the Rawlsian criterion of justice to the international arena, and identifies those features of the present global order that this criterion would single out as principal targets for institutional reform.\n\nGiving What We Can is an international society for the promotion of poverty relief, in particular in the developing world. The aims of the organisation are to encourage people to commit to long-term donation to those charities that provide the most cost-effective poverty relief. Giving What We Can conducts extensive research into the relative effectiveness of charities, and provides a list of those it most highly recommends. Currently this includes charities that work to treat neglected diseases (NTDs), malaria and micronutrient deficiency.\n\nIGH is a non-profit organization dedicated to developing market-based, systemic solutions to health challenges faced by the world’s poor. Its flagship proposal is the Health Impact Fund.\n\nAcademics Stand Against Poverty is an organization meant to help academics have a greater impact on world poverty. “The group lies between academia and activism. Like the latter, it aims primarily at persuading and motivating people to change their behavior. Like the former, it does so by moral and political argument, using the distinctive skills of academics.”\n\nThis project is still in its beginning stages. It has three central aims:\n\nVarious indices - the United Nations Development Programme's Human and Gender‐Related Development Indices, and the World Bank’s Poverty Index - are used to track poverty, development, and gender equity at the population level. Pogge argues that these prominent indices are deeply flawed and therefore distort our moral judgments and misguide resource allocations by governments, international agencies, and non-governmental organizations.\n\n“This project will work toward new indices ‘of poverty and of gender equity’ applicable both at the national and supranational levels, and to smaller groups affected by specific policies and programs. Both indices will draw on a holistic measure of individual (dis)advantage that reflects all relevant aspects of a person’s situation.”\n\nPogge has pursued similar themes in \"Politics as Usual: What Lies Behind the Pro-Poor Rhetoric\" (2010).\n\nThis project focuses on the illicit financial flows out of developing countries, the lack of transparency in the global financial system, and the impact these conditions have on human rights. The driving idea behind this project is that “‘human rights and international financial integrity are intimately linked’” and that poverty increases when money flows out of nations illicitly instead of being invested in the basic needs of people in their countries.”\n\nThe Forced Labor and Human Trafficking project aims “to bring public, official, and mainstream media attention to the global crisis of human trafficking and labor abuse towards children and adults.” The non-profit organization Art Works Projects is a contributor to this project.\n\nIn 2010, Pogge was accused in a high-profile sexual harassment case by a recent Yale graduate student. As a professor at Columbia University in the mid-1990s, Pogge had been disciplined by the school following allegations of sexual harassment. In 2016, after new allegations were made by a graduate of Yale University, an internal review concluded only that Pogge had \"inappropriately used Yale stationery in vouching for [the accuser's] employment.\" After articles appeared on several websites, hundreds of professors, including the chair of Pogge's department at Yale, signed an open letter criticizing Pogge. Pogge wrote a detailed defense.\n\n\n\n"}

Brandsma was vehemently opposed to Nazi ideology and spoke out against it many times before the Second World War. He was imprisoned in the infamous Dachau concentration camp, where he died. He has been beatified by the Roman Catholic Church as a martyr of the faith.\n\nHe was born Anno Sjoerd Brandsma to Titus Brandsma (died 1920) and his wife Tjitsje Postma (died 1933) at Oegeklooster, near Hartwerd, in the Province of Friesland, in 1881. His parents, who ran a small dairy farm, were devout and committed Catholics, a minority in a predominantly-Calvinist region. With the exception of one daughter, all of their children entered religious orders.\nAs a young boy, Brandsma did his secondary studies in the town of Megen, at a Franciscan-run minor seminary for boys considering a priestly or religious vocation.\n\nBrandsma entered the novitiate of the Carmelite friars in Boxmeer on 17 September 1898, where he took the religious name Titus (in honor of his father) by which he is now known. He professed his first vows in October 1899.\n\nOrdained a priest in 1905, Brandsma was knowledgeable in Carmelite mysticism and was awarded a doctorate of philosophy at Rome in 1909. He then taught in various schools in the Netherlands. From 1916 on, he initiated and led a project to translate the works of St. Teresa of Ávila into Dutch.\n\nIn 1921 Brandsma worked to resolve a controversy concerning Belgian artist Albert Servaes' depiction of the Stations of the Cross. From this came his series of meditations on each of the 14 stations.\n\nOne of the founders of the Catholic University of Nijmegen (now Radboud University), Brandsma became a professor of philosophy and the history of mysticism at the school in 1923. He later served as \"Rector Magnificus\". He was noted for his constant availability to everyone, rather than for his scholarly work as a professor.\n\nBrandsma also worked as a journalist and was the ecclesiastical adviser to Catholic journalists by 1935. That same year he did a lecture tour of the United States, speaking at various institutions of his Order.\n\nAfter the invasion of the Netherlands by the Third Reich in May 1940, it was Brandsma's fight against the spread of Nazi ideology and for educational and press freedom that brought him to the attention of the Nazis. In January 1942 he undertook to deliver by hand a letter from the Conference of Dutch Bishops to the editors of Catholic newspapers in which the bishops ordered them not to print official Nazi documents, as was required under a new law by the German occupiers. He had visited 14 editors before being arrested on the 19th of that month at the Boxmeer monastery.\n\nAfter being held prisoner in Scheveningen, Amersfoort, and Cleves, Brandsma was transferred to the Dachau concentration camp, arriving there on 19 June. His health quickly gave way, and he was transferred to the camp hospital. He died on 26 July 1942, from a lethal injection administered by a nurse of the Allgemeine SS, as part of their program of medical experimentation on the prisoners.\n\nBrandsma is honored as a martyr within the Roman Catholic Church. He was beatified in November 1985 by Pope John Paul II. His feast day is observed within the Carmelite Order on 27 July.\n\nIn 2005 Brandsma was chosen by the inhabitants of Nijmegen as the greatest citizen to have lived there. A memorial church now stands in the city dedicated to him.\n\nBrandsma's studies on mysticism was the basis for the establishment in 1968 of the Titus Brandsma Institute in Nijmegen, dedicated to the study of spirituality. It is a collaboration between the Dutch Carmelite friars and Radboud University Nijmegen.\n\nIn his biography of Brandsma, \"The Man behind the Myth\", Dutch journalist Ton Crijnen claims that Brandsma combined some vanity, a short tempered character, extreme energy, political simpleness, true charity, unpretentious piety, thorough decisiveness and great personal courage. His ideas were very much those of his own age and modern as well. He offset contemporary Catholicism's negative theological opinion about Judaism with a strong disaffection for any kind of Antisemitism in Hitler's Germany.\nBrandsma was honoured by the city of Dachau with a street adjoining the former camp, albeit one of the narrowest streets in the town.\n\n"}
{"id": "50340216", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50340216", "title": "Transactionalism", "text": "Transactionalism\n\nTransactionalism is a philosophical approach that addresses the fundamental nature of social exchange or human transaction; that all human exchange is best understood as a set of transactions within a reciprocal and co-constitutive whole. A transactionalist demands that all human exchange, including learning, is best understood as a transactional whole shaped and defined by a set of experiences in an ecology that are all-at-once biological, socio-linguistic, and intellectual; \"man is an information-processing, organizing, open-energy system.\" Attention must be paid to organizing acts within, and as-if always, a reciprocal and co-constitutive, exchange whether it be in buying and selling, teaching and learning, in a marital contract, or a social situation in-person or online.\n\nStemming from the Latin \"transigere\" (\"˜to drive through\", \"to accomplish\"), the root word \"transaction\" is not restricted to the economic sense of \"buying and selling\" or merely a financial transaction. A much larger field of exchange is employed such as, \"any sort of social interaction, such as verbal communication, eye contact, or touch. A 'stroke' [of one's hand] is an act of recognition of a transaction\" as employed in psychology with transactional analysis It not only examines exchanges, or \"transactions,\" between borrower and lender, but encompasses any transaction involving people and objects whether it involves \"borrowing-lending, buying-selling, writing-reading, parent-child, and husband-wife.\" A transaction, then is \"a creative act, engaged in by one who, by virtue of his participation in the act – of which he is always an \"aspect\", never an \"entity\" – together with the other participants, be they human or otherwise environmental, becomes [,] in the process [,] modified.\"\n\nWhile John Dewey is viewed by many transactionalists as a principal architect, social anthropologist Fredrik Barth was among the first to articulate the concept as it is understood in contemporary study. Political scientists Karl W. Deutsch and Ben Rosamond have also written on the subject. Transactionalist analysis is a core paradigm advanced by social psychologist Eric Berne in his book \"Games People Play\". A transactionalist view of psychology, for instance, views an individual as \"embedded and integrated\" in an ever-evolving world of situations, actors, and exchange.\n\nThe discourse of transactionalist problem-solving is applied to a vast array of academic and professional discourses including educational philosophy in the humanities; social psychology, political science, and political anthropology in the social sciences; and occupational science in the health sciences; cognitive science, zoology, and quantum mechanics in the natural sciences; and transactional competence and leadership-as-practice in business.\n\nJohn Dewey offered a sophisticated, yet pragmatic approach to understanding man as an organism-environment purposefully designed to correct the \"fragmentation of experience\" often found in other philosophical approaches found in Subjectivism, Objectivism, Constructivism and Skepticism.\n\nHe asserted that human life is not organized into separate entities, as if the mind (emotions, feelings, creativity, imagination) and the world outside it (raw and manufactured goods as well as social roles and institutions such as family, school, and media) are irreconcilable, leading to the question \"How does the mind know the world?\"\nGalileo refused to seek the causes of the behavior of physical phenomena in the phenomena alone and sought the causes in the conditions under which the phenomena occur.The writing of John Dewey and Arthur Bentley in \"Knowing and the Known\" offers a deep dive into transactionalism but its historical antecedents date back to Polybius and Galileo. Trevor J. Phillips (1927–2016), American professor emeritus in educational foundations and inquiry at Bowling Green State University from 1963 to 1996, wrote a comprehensive review of the historical, philosophical, psychological, and educational development of transactionalism in his 1966 dissertation \"Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study\" republished in 2013 by Influence Ecology. Phillips traced transactionalism's philosophical roots to Greek historians Polybius and Plato, 17th century polymath and architect of the scientific revolution Galileo, as well as the architect of modern western philosophy, René Descartes.\n\nGalileo's contributions to the scientific revolution rested on an understanding of transactionalism from which he argued Aristotelian physics was wrong, as he wrote in \"Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems\" (1632):\"In that case, if it is denied that circular motion is peculiar to celestial bodies, and affirmed to belong to all naturally movable bodies, then one must choose one of two necessary consequences. Either the attributes of generable-ingenerable, alterable-inalterable, divisibleindivisible, etc., suit equally and commonly all world bodies – as much the celestial as the elemental – or Aristotle has wrongly and erroneously deduced, from circular motion, those attributes which he has assigned to celestial bodiesThe philosophy abandons self-actional and interaction-al beliefs or suppositions as problem-solving in an objective world where co-operative exchange creates value in learning, and the foundation of transactional competence, how objects including people behave. Galileo deviated from the then current Aristotelian thinking, which was defined by mere interactions rather than co-constituetive transacting among people with different interests who may be solving competing intentions or conditions of life.\n\nTrevor Phillips also outlined the philosophy's more recent developments found in the American philosophical works of Charles Sanders Peirce, sociologist George Herbert Mead (symbolic interactionism), pragmatist William James, educational philosopher John Dewey, and political scientist Arthur Bentley.\n\nSeveral sources credit anthropologist Fredrik Barth as the scholar first to apply the term 'transactionalism\" in 1959. In a critique of structural functionalism, Barth offered a new interpretation of culture that did not portray an overly cohesive picture of society without attending to the \"roles, relationships, decisions, and innovations of the individual.\" Humans are transacting with one another at multiple levels of individual, group, and environment. Barth's study appears to not fully articulate how this is happening all-at-once as opposed to as if separate entities interacting (interactional):[T]he \"environment\" of any ethnic group is not only defined by natural conditions, but also by the presence and activities of other ethnic groups on which it depends. Each group exploits only a section of the total environment [perhaps in keeping with the idea of a \"transactional whole\"], and leaves large parts of it open for other groups to exploit (p. 1079).Using examples from the people of the Swat district of North Pakistan and, later, in 1966, organization among Norwegian fishermen, Barth set out to demonstrate that social forms like kinship groups, economic institutions, and political alliances are generated by the actions and strategies of the individuals who deploy organized acts against a context of social constraints. \"By observing how people interact with each other [through experience], an insight could be gained into the [interactional] nature of the competition, values and principles that govern individuals' choices.\"\n\nThis insight would be interactional at best and not transactional—reciprocal and co-constituetive transactions at the levels of individual, group, and environment (including man-as-organism and its ecological situations).\n\nSome scholars argue transactionalism is a theory rather than philosophical approach. Barth's contribution was initially criticized for paying insufficient attention to cultural constraints on individualism though it influenced the qualitative method known as symbolic interactionism used in the social sciences. As a pragmatic and philosophical approach, transactionalism is recognizable in the theory of the \"sociological imagination\" by American sociologist C. Wright Mills (1959), in which personal troubles are linked to public issues. In other words, the \"transactional whole\" is not readily apparent at the level of individuals who at that level operate in a self-actional manner when larger forces of sociality, history, biology, and culture are all-at-once at work as part of a global dynamic. Humans are never outside this dynamic current; operating the system in some self-actional or even interactional way.\n\nModern architects of the philosophy are John Patterson and Kirkland Tibbels, co-founders of Influence Ecology, acquired, edited, and published, Phillips' dissertation (as is) in 2013. With a foreword written by Tibbels, a hardback and Kindle version was published under the title \"Transactionalism: An Historical and Interpretive Study\" (2013). The monograph is an account of how human phenomena came to be viewed less as the behavior of static and/or mutually isolated entities, and more as dynamic aspects of events in the process of problem-solving, and thereby becoming or satisfying, the unavoidable and inescapable conditions of human life.\n\nIn a new model of organizational management known as the \"leadership-as-practice\" Dewey and Bentley's Knowing and the Known categories of action—self-action, inter-action, and trans-action brings transactionalism into the C-suite. A transactional leadership practice is defined by its \"trans-actors\" who \"enact new and unfolding meanings in on-going trans-actions\" situated in contrast to an older model leadership defined by self-actional (self-actors) and inter-actional (inter-actors) practices. In the latter, actors and situations often remain unchanged. In Leadership-as-Practice, Joseph A. Raelin distinguishes between a \"practice\" that extends and amplifies the meaning of work and its value vs. \"practices\" that are habitual and sequential activities evoked to simplify everyday routines. A transactional approach—leadership-as-practice—focuses attention on \"existing entanglements, complexities, processes, [while also] distinguishing problems in order to coordinate roles, acts, and practices within a group or organization.\" Said another way, \"trans-action attends to emergent becoming\"—a kind of seeing together--\"rather than substantive being (Tsoukas and Chia 2002)\" among the actors involved.\n\nThe transactional view of metaphysics—studying the nature of reality or what is real—deals with the inseparability of what is known and how humans inquire into what is known—both \"knowing and the known\". Since the age of Aristotle, humans have shifted from one paradigm or system of \"logic\" to another before a transactional metaphysics evolved with a focus that examines and inquires into solving problems first and foremost based on the relationship of man as a biological organism (with a brain and a body) shaped by its environment. In the book \"Transactionalism\" (2015), the nature of reality is traced historically from \"self-action\" to \"interaction\" to \"transactional\" competence each as its own \"age of knowing\" or episteme\".\"\n\nThe pre-Galilean age of knowing is defined by \"self-action\" \"where things [and thereby people] are viewed as acting on their own powers.\" In \"Knowing and the Known\", Dewey and Bentley wrote, \"The epistemologies, logics, psychologies and sociologies [of our day] are still largely [understood] on a self-actional basis.\"\n\nThe result of Newtonian physics\", interaction\" marks the second age of knowing; a system marked especially by the \"third 'law of motion'—that action and reaction are equal and opposite\".\n\nThe third episteme is \"transactional\" competence\".\" With origins in the contributions of Darwin, \"man's understandings are finite as opposed to infinite. In the same way, his views, goals, commitments, and beliefs have relative status as opposed to absolute.\" John Dewey and Arthur Bentley asserted this competence as \"the right to see together, extensionally and durationally, much that is talked about conventionally as if it were composed of irreconcilable separates.\" We tend to avoid considering our actions as part of a dynamic and transactional whole, whether in mundane or complex activities; whether in making an invitation, request, or offer or in the complex management of a program or company. We tend to avoid studying, thinking, and planning our moves and moods for a comprehensive, reciprocal, and co-constitutive—in other words, \"transactional\"—whole.\n\nA transactional whole includes the organized acts including ideas, narratives, people as resources implementing ideas, services, and products, the things involved, settings, and personalities, all considered in and over time. With this competence, that which \"acts\" and is \"acted upon\" become united for a moment in a mutual or ethical exchange, where both are reciprocally transformed contradicting \"any absolute separation or isolation\" often found in the dualistic thinking and categorization of Western thought.\n\nDualistic thinking and categorization often lead to over-simplification of the transactional whole found in the convenient but ineffective resorting to \"exclusive classifications.\" Such classifications tend to exclude and reify man as if he has dominion over his nature or the environment.\n\nIn his seminal 20th century work \"Physics and Philosophy\", Warner Heisenberg reflects this kind of transactionalist thinking: \"What we observe is not nature itself, but nature exposed to our method of questioning.” The together-at-once reality of man as organism-environment is often overlooked in the dualistic thinking of even major philosophers like Descartes who is often referenced for his \"I think, therefore I am\" philosophy. Of a transactionalist approach, Heisenberg writes, \"This was a possibility of which Descartes could not have thought, but it makes the sharp separation of the world and I impossible.\"\n\nDualistic thinking prevents man from thinking. \"In the spirit of [Charles Sanders] Peirce, transactionalism substitutes continuity for discontinuity, change and interdependence for separateness.\"\n\nFor example, in problem solving, whenever we \"insert a name instead of a problem,\" when words like \"soul,\" \"mind,\" \"need,\" \"I.Q.\" or \"trait\" are expressed as if real, they have the power to block and distort free inquiry into what is known in fact or as fact in the transactional whole.\n\nIn the nature of change and being, \"that which \"acts\" and that which is \"acted upon\"\" always undergo a reciprocal relationship that is affected by the presence and influence of the other. We as human beings, as part of nature as an organism \"integral to (as opposed to separate from, above or outside of) any investigation and inquiry may use a transactionalist approach to expand our personal knowledge so as to solve life's complex problems.\n\nThe purpose of \"transactionalism\" is not to discover what is already there, but for a person to seek and interpret senses, objects, places, positions, or any aspect of transactions between one's Self and one's environment (including objects, other people, and their symbolic interactions) in terms of the aims and desires each one needs and wants to satisfy and fulfill. It is essential that one simultaneously take into account the needs and desires of others in one's environment or ecology to avoid the self-actional or self-empowerment ideology of a rugged and competitive individualism. While other philosophies may discuss similar ethical concerns, this co-constitutive and reciprocal element of problem-solving is central to transactionalism.\n\nTo put it simply, \"to experience is to transact; in point of fact, experience is a transaction of organism-environment.\" In other words, what is \"known\" by the knower (or organism) is always filtered and shaped by both internal and external moods and narratives, mirrored in and through our relationships to the physical affordances and constraints in our environment or in specific ecologies.\n\nThe metaphysics of transactional inquiry is characterized in the pragmatic writing of William James who insists that \"single barreled terms,\" terms like \"thought\" and \"thing,\" actually stop or block inquiries into what is known and how we know it. Instead, a transactional orientation of ‘double-barreledness’ or the \"interdependence of aspects of experience\" must always be considered. James offers his readers insight into the \"double-barreledness\" of experience with an apt proposition:Is the preciousness of a diamond a quality of the gem [the thing] or is it a feeling in our mind [the thought]? Practically we treat it as both or as either, according to the temporary direction of our thought. The ‘experienced’ and the ‘experiencing,’ the ‘seen’ and the ‘seeing,’ are, in actuality, only names for a single fact.\n\nWhat is real then, from a transactionist perspective, must be constantly reevaluated relative to man as organism-environment in a co-constituitive and reciprocal dynamic with people, personalities, situations, aims, and given the needs each party seeks to satisfy.\n\nTransactionalists are firmly intolerant of \"anything resembling an 'ultimate' truth -- or 'absolute' knowledge.\" Due to the evolution of psychology about the nature of man, transactionalists reject the notion of a mind-body split or anything resembling the bifurcation of what they perceive as the circuitry in which our biological stimulus-response exists. Examples transactionalists reject include the self-acting notions of Aristotle who posited that \"the soul -- the psyche -- realized itself in and through the body, and that matter and form were two aspects involved in all existence.\" Later, the claims of French philosopher René Descartes, recognized as the father of modern Western philosophy, were examined and defined as \"interactional\". Descartes suggested stimulus-response as the realm where the mind controls the body and the body may influence the rational mind out of the passion of our emotions.\n\nTransactionalists recognize Cartesian dualism as a form of disintegrating the transactional whole of man \"into two complete substances, joined to another no one knows how.\" The body as a physical entity, on the one hand, and the soul or thought, on the other, was regarded in a Cartesian mindset as \"an angel inhabiting a machine and directing it by means of the pineal gland\" This tranactionalists reject.\n\nMan has the propensity to treat the mind and thought or the mind and body as abstractions and this tendency to deny the interrelatedness or coordinated continuity results in misconceptions in learning and inaccurate thinking as humans move and thrive with an ecology. Accurate thinking and learning begins and is constantly developed through action resulting from thought as a repetitive circuit of experience known in psychology as deliberate practice. Educational philosopher Trevor Phillips, now deceased, frames this tendency to falsely organize our perception: \"[W]e fail to realize that we can know nothing about things [or ourselves] beyond their significance to us,\" otherwise we distort our \"reality\" and treat things we perceive within it, including our bodies or mind, as if concrete thereby \"denying the interconnectedness of realities\" (plural). Transactionalists suggest that accurate (or inaccurate) thinking is rarely considered an unintended consequence of our propensity for abstractions.\n\nWhen an individual transacts through intelligent or consequential actions circumscribed within the constraints and conditions of her/his environment in a reflexive, repetitive arc of learned experience, there is a \"transaction between means and ends\" (see reference below). This transactional approach features twin aspects of a larger event rather than merely manipulating the means to an end in our circumstances and situations. For instance, a goal can never be produced by abstraction, by simply thinking about or declaring a promise to produce a result. Nor can it be anticipated or foreseen (an abstraction at best) without a significant \"pattern of inquiry,\" as John Dewey later defined and articulated, into the constraints and conditions that happen and are happening given the interdependence of all the people and objects involved in a simple or complex transaction. The nature of our environment affects all these entities within a transaction. Thus, revealing the limiting and reductive notion of manipulating a psychology around stimulus and response found in Aristotilian or Cartesian thought.\n\nA transaction is recognized here as one that occurs between the \"means and ends;\" in other words, transactional competence is derived from the \"distinctions between the how, the what (or subject-matter), and the why (or what for).\" This transactional whole constitutes a reciprocal connection and a reflexive arc of learned and lived experience. From a transactional approach one can derive a certain kind of value from one's social exchange. Value in knowing how, what, and why the work done with your mind and body fulfill on the kinds of transactions needed to live a good and satisfying life that functions well with others. Truth from actual inquiry is foundational for organism-environment to define and live by a set of workable ethical values that functions with others.\n\nWhile \"self-interest\" governs the ethical principles of Objectivism, here the principle is that man as an organism is in a \"reciprocal, constitutive\" relationship with her/his environment. Disabusing the psychological supposition of our \"skin-boundedness\" (discussed further below), transactionalism rejects the notion that we are apart from our environment or that man has dominion over it. Man, woman, and child must view life and be viewed in the undifferentiated whole of \"organism-environment\". This reciprocal and co-constitutive relationship is what sets Transactionalism apart from other philosophies.\n\nWhat John Dewey meant by \"reciprocal\" was that:... consequences have to be determined on the grounds of what is selected and handled as means in exactly the same sense in which the converse holds and demands constant attention if activities are to be intelligently conducted.In order for a human being to \"know\", in order for a human being to \"acquire\" intelligence, it must learn to relate to its Self as part of, not separate from the internal and/or external environments in which it lives as an \"organism-environment\". Whether the environment is natural or man-made, whether discussing biology, sociology, culture, linguistics, history and memory, or economics and physics, every \"organism-environment\" is \"reciprocal, constitutive, socially-conditioned and\" constantly in flux demanding our ethical attention to conditions and consequences as we live life. John Dewey and Arthur Bentley, like Charles Sanders Peirce before them, were out to distinguish an ethical \"living\" logic rather than a static one. Both rejected the supposition that man had dominion over or governed behavior in his/her environment embracing a presupposition of transactionalism; we are \"reciprocal, co-constitutive, socially-conditioned, and motivated\" \"together-at-once\" as we seek solutions to living a good life.\n\nTransactionalists reject the \"localization\" of our psychology as if \"skin-bound.\" Bentley wrote, \"No creature lives merely under its skin.\" In other words, we should not define and distinguish experience in and from the subjective mind and feelings. Conversely, we cannot rely solely on external circumstances or some static or inherited logic. Galileo said of followers of Aristotle in seeking ethical knowledge that one should \"come with arguments and demonstrations of your own...but bring us no more texts and naked authorities, for our disputes are about the sensible world and not a paper one.\" Humans are always transacting, \"together-at-once,\" part of, shaped by, and shap-ing the experience we call \"knowledge\" as an \"organism-environment\".\n\nDewey and Bentley were intrigued by, and ultimately questioned, \"the significance of the concept ‘skin’ and its role in philosophical and psychological thought.\" They offered a biological or natural justification that came to define a transactionalist approach. The known and what is known are both a function of man having \"evolved among other organisms\" within natural selection or evolution.\n\nMan's most intellectual and advanced \"knowings\" are not merely outgrowths of his own doing or being. The natural evolution of things outside our knowingness creates the very context in which our known and knowings arise. We are not inventing what is known outside or, in a vacuum beyond, who we are and who we are is an organism-environment together-at-once. We are not creatures separated by skin with an internal world of the mind and body \"in here\" separate from an environment of objects and people \"out there\". Human beings intelligently live, adapt to, and organize life in a reciprocal, co-constitutive experience that is what Dewey and Bentley term \"trans-dermal\".\n\nA \"trans-dermal\" experience demands knowledgeable and accurate inquiry into the conditions and consequences of each transaction where the organizing of ideas and acts (knowledge), is itself a transaction which grows out of the problem-solving and creative exploring within the universe of social situations in which we exist. Dewey and Bentley wrote, \"truth, or for that matter falsity, is a function of the deliberately striven for consequences arising out of inquiry.\"\n\nOur behavior and acts in knowing, or transacting, must be considered \"together\" and \"at-once\" with its conditions and consequences for any ambitious movement or fulfillment to occur alone and among other people in any setting with objects and constructd inherited from others known and unknown over time. Transacting demands study, a slowing down of our movement, and the development of a transactional competence in order to fulfill certain needs or solve problems while functioning among others.\n\nIn Dewey's final days, wrote Phillips, he emphasized the twin aspects of attending to both the means and the ends of any transaction: \"It is…impossible to have an end-in-view or to anticipate the consequences of any proposed line of action.\" A \"trans-dermal\" consciousness is, therefore, key to moving ethically. To move, experience life, or transact in a principled manner, considering the reciprocal and co-constituitive nature of organism-environment becomes an object lesson governing both social behavior as well as in transacting from a trans-dermal view with objects or other bodies.\n\nThe work of Australian educational philosopher Vicki L. Lee further elucidates and breaks down what is \"trans-dermal\" experience—how it works and why it matters—based on her work in the philosophy of cognitive science, educational philosophy, and radical behaviorism about which she has published extensively. This complex paradigm is clearly evidenced by Lee in this thickly described example: Acts are more than movements. ...Our discriminations depend on movements and their contexts seen together-at-once or as an undifferentiated whole. In discriminating watering the garden from hosing the driveway, we see the bodily movements and their occasion and results. We see the garden, the watering implement, and so forth, as much as we see the body's activities. The notion of together-at-once emphasizes that we do not see movements and contexts separately and then infer the action. Rather the context is internal to the action, because without the context, the action would not be the action it is.A basic presupposition of the philosophy of transactionalism is to always consider that that which is known about the world (extra-dermal) is \"directly concerned with the activity of the knower\" which is merely from some sense of \"skin-boundedness\" (intra-dermal). The known and the knower, as Dewey and Bentley examined in detail in their collaborative publication, must always be considered \"'twin aspects of common fact.\"\n\nBehavior, movement, and acts are not merely a function of the mind, of wishful or positive thinking or belief in external forces, nor can it be determined ethically from the philosophers of the past or knowledge written in a book. It is our ability to transact trans-dermally—to be and become ecologically-fit as an organism-environment—that begets truthful inquiry into living a good and satisying life, functioning well among others.\n\nPhilosophy and Women's Studies Professor Shannon Sullivan explores and applies \"transactional knowing through embodied and relational lived experience\" as a feminist epistemology developed out of the pragmatist tradition. See “pragmatist-feminist standpoint theory”.\n\nThe branch of philosophy recognized as \"politics\" concerns the governance of community and group interaction, not merely that of the state as conceived when thinking of a local or national government.\n\nIn \"Laws of Motion\" (1920), physicist James Clerk Maxwell articulated the modern conception of \"transaction\" used here—one that is not exclusive to an economic context limited to only the opposition of a buyer-seller in a trade or other analougous uses. Unlike its use in commercial affairs, there is a radical departure from any tendency to perceive buyer-seller (as well as organism-environment) as opposing or separate forces. In a transactionalist approach, Maxwell (as well as others) view the former and latter as \"two parts of the same phenomenon.\"\n\nDewey and Bentley apply this notion of 'transactional' to learning more than any other context. In the educative process, acting without knowing is a separation of the same phenomenon enjoined in inquiry. Without inquiry acting does not work. Acting and knowing cooperate to provide knowledge to an organism-environment which must essentially involve inquiry into things that have happened and are happening: Knowledge – if the term is to be employed at all – is a name for the product of competent inquiries, and is constituted only as the outcome of a particular inquiry.It is not \"a process taking place, or as a status located in or at an animal organism.\" Knowledge arises from inquiry and the testing of that inquiry to insure the fitness of not only the solution but the organism-environment. While a human being is central or \"nuclear\" to its organism-environment, it must abdicate any sense of dominion over the socio-biological cosmos of which human being is part and never outside of. Each situation—and this transactionalists assert is radical—must be examined and determined by a construction of moves and action based on the capacity of that organism to fulfill its intentions and thrive (or not). Dewey and Bentley later insisted that knowing \"as inquiry, [is therefore] a way, or distinct form, of behavior.\"\n\nTransactionalists define politics in this philosophy as a cooperative, genuine interaction between all participating parties whether buyer-seller, student-teacher, or worker-boss given that we are biological and social subjects involved not merely in \"transacting\" for our own advantage or gain. \"[S]ocial phenomena cannot be understood except as there is prior understanding of physical conditions and the laws of their [socio-biological] interactions,\" wrote John Dewey in \"\". He added further, \"Inquiry into [social phenomena], with respect both to data that are significant and to their relations or proper ordering, is conditioned upon extensive prior knowledge of physical phenomena and their laws. This fact accounts in part for the retarded and immature state of social subjects.\" Thus, cooperation and knowing as inquiry is foundational to governing communal affairs of any kind including economic trade and the educative process.\n\nIn our existing models of formal education, we bifurcate what Dewey viewed as indispensable. We, as a rule, segregate \"utility and culture, absorption and expression, theory and practice...in any educational scheme\" In 1952, progressive educator Elsie Ripley Clapp distinguished a similar commitment to \"cooperative transaction of inquiry\" in her vision that enjoined community and school.\n\nIntelligence, meaning that which is acquired through inquiry and testing, allows man to foresee consequences and take control of his actions without dogma or beliefs (that might be wrong) derived from past experience or expectations. If the study of politics in philosophy is a \"study of force,\" of knowing \"what actions are permissible\" given that man is an organism-environment, then transactionalists assert that cooperation and knowing-as-inquiry are vital to functioning among others.\n\n\"The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\" noted that Dewey was critical of the classical neoliberal stance that the asbtract individual precedes a conception of society or social institutions. Dewey maintained that social institutions were not a \"means for obtaining something for individuals. They are means for 'creating' individuals\" (\"Reconstruction in Philosophy\", \"MW\"12, 190-192). In this way, classical liberalism seems to exemplify ‘the most pervasive fallacy of philosophical thinking’ (‘Context and Thought’, \"LW\"5, 5). Transactionalism is a radical form of governing that resists the tendency to \"divide up experienced phenomena, and to take the distinct analysed elements to be separate existences, independent both of the analysis and of each other.\"\n\nIntelligent thinking is anti-dualistic, accurate, forethought taking into account other people, communities, and cultures that stems from a \"deliberate control of what is done with reference to making what happens to us and what we do to things as fertile as possible of suggestions (of suggested meanings).\" Furthermore, intelligent thinking is a means for trying out the validity of those suggestions. The political governing of thinking towards dualisms and bifurcation as well as the \"false conception of the individual\" is what Dewey argued limited man's free, meaning \"liberal\", thought and action. All of this served as the core reasoning behind Dewey's development of an experimental philosophy that offset elite distortions regarding a public and transactional interest in education and learning.\n\nTransationalist psychologists and educational philosophers reject the ideologies precipitated from Western ideologies of \"do-it-yourself\" or the \"if it's up to me, it will be\" mentality that leads to entitlement and the naiveté of slogans like \"follow your passion\" that deny any consideration of our trans-dermal condition. Transactionalists assert that the \"advancing conformity and coercive competition so characteristic of our times\" demands reassessment. A new \"philosophical-psychological complex\" is offered that confronts the \"ever increasing growth of bureaucratic rule and the attendant rise of a complacent citizenry.\" Given the intensification of globalization and migration, a trans-dermal consciousness allows for a transactional emphasis on \"human dignity and uniqueness\" despite \"a matrix of anxiety and despair [and] feelings of alienation.\"\n\nTransactionalist psychologists and philosophers replace once sought-after Existentialism as a remedy to feelings of alienation with a trans-dermal orientation to living. Rather than applying a theory or approach that emphasizes the individual as a \"free and responsible agent determining their own development through acts of the will,\" subjects are invited to co-create as an organism-environment functioning among all other organism-environments, including the conditions and consequences of objects and personalities, in order to intelligently structure existence in and amongst it all. The very act of participating in co-creation, according to transactionalists, gives and allows each person her/his unique status and dignity in their environment.\n\nDistinct from an aesthetic theory of taste or a rationale for the beauty in an object of art, a transactionalist theory of aesthetics concerns the perceptual judgments we use to define value, purposeful activity or satisfaction in any experience. Based on studies by transactionalist psychologists Adelbert Ames, Jr. (known for The Ames Demonstrations), William Howard Ittelson, Hadley Cantril, along with John Dewey, the biological role of perception is key to understanding transactionalism. Perceiving is viewed as \"part of the process of living by which each one of us, from his own particular point of view, creates for himself the world within which he has his life’s experiences and through which he strives to gain his satisfactions.\" The sum total of these assumptions was recognized as the \"assumptive world.\"\n\nThe assumptive world stems from all that we experience, all the things and events we assess and assign meaning to, which function as a \"contextual whole\" also known as a \"transactional whole\". Dewey also referred to the assumptive world as a \"situation\" (where organism and environment are inseparable) or as a \"field\" in which behavior, stimulus, and response are framed as if a \"reflexive circuit\". \"To the modern transactionalist, experiences alter perceptual processes, and in the act of altering them, the purposing aspect of perception is either furthered or its fulfillment interfered with.\" It is through action, through movement, that man is capable of bringing forth a value-satisfaction to his or her experience. Man's capacity to \"sense value in the quality of his experience\" was registered through his serial expectations and standards stemming from previous transactions throughout life.\n\nA theory of value is therefore derived from one's behavioral inquiry within an assumptive world. \"Knowledge is a transaction that develops out of man's explorations within [that] cosmos.\" Transactionalists reject the notion that any truth is inherently settled or beyond question. The consequences of any inquiry will be dependent on the \"situation\" or transactional whole in which man as an organism-environment finds him- or her-self.\n\nTo clarify the theory of valuation for man, John Dewey wrote:\nTo declare something \"satisfactory\" [vs. satisfying] is to assert that it meets specifiable conditions. It is, in effect, a judgment that the thing 'will do'. It involves a prediction; it contemplates a future in which the thing will continue to serve; it \"will\" do. It asserts a consequence the thing will actively institute, it \"will\" do.\"\nUltimately, transactionalism is a move away from the conclusion that knowledge depends on an independent knower and something to be known. The reality of a particular situation depends, transactionally speaking, on the interpretation place[d] upon the situation by a particular person. Interpretation is possible only through the accumulation of experience which, in effect, is what is meant by “assumptions”. Without the hitches and mistakes one encounters in the welter of daily living, the nature of the assumptive world would never arise into consciousness. The assumptive world, initially highlighted in the 25 experiments in perception known as The Ames demonstrations, becomes the seeming reality of our world. Man’s transactions of living involve, in sum, capacities, and aspects of his nature operating together. To transact is to participate in the process of translating the ongoing energies of the environment into one’s own perceptual awareness, and to transform the environment through the perceptual act. Value-satisfaction arises when the inadequacies of man's assumptive world are revealed or invalidated. Thereby, the consequences of any transactional experience determines what is valuable or what will do vs. that which is satisfying but will not do. The good life, for the transactionalist, consists of a unity of values, achieved by means of reflective thought, and accepted in the full light of their conditions and consequences.\n\nTo transact is to act intelligently with an aim in mind while avoiding the tendency to surrender one's awareness to complacency or indifference that stems from mere information or untested knowledge. Without action, a person can fool herself, distort her sense of satisfaction or value on behalf of consequences she or others prefer. Through action, the individual perceptions and the shared perceptual common sense of an assumptive world are validated and modified. We predict and refine our conditions of life yet \"any standard set for these value qualities is influenced by the individual’s personal biological and life history.\" Transactionalism is a creativee process that takes into account the unique biology and biography of persons involved.\n\nThe importance of the study of transactionalism arose in the late 1960s in response to an \"alienation syndrome\" among youth of that generation. As the counter-culture challenged and reassessed society's \"philosophical-psychological complex, its \"Weltanschauung\",\" their political and social alienation sparked protests against the war and the draft as well as historic racial rebellions in various U.S. cities. The Long hot summer of 1967 and the counterculture movement named the Summer of Love also in 1967 reflected the antipathy of young people who questioned everything. American society's norms and values were perceived as denying dignity to all. Riots of the period were studied in a report by the U.S. Kerner Commission and scholars began to study the patterns of alienation expressed by youth in the sixties. Youth sought a kind of existentialism expressed by a need to be \"true to oneself.\" This current of alienation unfortunately veered away from a relevant understanding of the transactional whole taking into account the reciprocal and co-constitutive nature of man as an organism-environment fulfilling important conditions of life with others all the time. It resembles the famous line from \"Devotions upon Emergent Occasions\", written by English poet John Donne -- \"No man is an island\". Transactionalism presented an alternative to the limitation and unintended outcomes of the alienation syndrome.\n\nDesigned to account for all aspects of experience—subjective and objective—transactionalism requires a slowing down in assessing all the facts involved with the how, what, when, where, and why as we move to transact with others. It demands and requires always considering how a transaction with another and one's self (e.g., a parent or spouse spending additional hours socializing at the gym) is or is not beneficial to all involved in a transaction (e.g., other members of the family). The costs may be in time, attention, or money or in a condition of life (e.g., family, career, sleep). Transactionalism requires an interdependence of thought, study, and action.\n\nA transactionalist must account for one's biology and cognition (metaphysics); the ways knowing reality (epistemology); the reciprocal, co-constitutive, relationship (or ethics) between our social self and the interactions constrained by both our natural and man-made environment. We as human beings live in distinct sociological patterns with people, material and immaterial culture shaped by specific and ever-changing times and places further articulated by increasing migration and globalization. Transactionalism insists that one attend to the political distribution of goods and services along with the ways its value has and is exchanged and changing among people and groups (politics) as well as how persons are socialized to understand what it means to live a good life as well as fulfill those conditions over time (aesthetics).\n\nTransactionalism offers more than existentialism offered with its aim of being \"true to oneself.\" The alienation that results from its orientation to the self at the expense of societal norms and values, even in small groups, often leads to naiveté, despair, frustration, agitation, and even indifference, at the expense of consciously organizing one's acts, while functioning among others, to fulfill one's unique and necessary interests in living a good and satisfying life. Transactionalism counters the naive \"do as I see fit\" mentality of authenticity regardless of other's needs and concerns, which inevitably leads to negative consequences and outcomes over time. Transactionalism depends upon the \"integration of man and his surroundings.\"\n\nPhillips' dissertation documented the evolution of a \"transactional approach;\" one that rests on the fact that we are biological, linguistic, and that we must transact considering a trans-dermal experience of our thoughts, behavior, and exchange on every level imagined while ethically functioning with others well.\n\nA series of podcasts exemplify the application of a transactional approach to a diverse array of professionals from various countries .\n\n"}
{"id": "5457582", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5457582", "title": "Tullia d'Aragona", "text": "Tullia d'Aragona\n\nTullia d'Aragona (c. 1510 – 1556) was a 16th-century Italian poet, author and philosopher. Born in Rome in 1510, Tullia traveled throughout Venice, Ferrara, Siena, and Florence before returning to Rome. Throughout her life Tullia was esteemed one of the best female writers, poets, philosophers, and charmers of her time. Influencing many of the most famous male philosophers, Tullia’s work raised the status (in literature) of women to be on an equal footing as men. Her fame and success made her into the most celebrated of Renaissance poet-courtesans. With her intellect, literary abilities and social graces, she entertained powerful men and famous poets.\n\nTullia was born in Rome around 1510, to Giulia Campana, a courtesan of the time. Also known as Giulia Ferrarese, her mother was lauded as \"the most famous beauty of her day\". Her father was thought to be Cardinal Luigi d'Aragona, who was himself the illegitimate grandson of Ferdinand I of Naples. Allegedly in order to cover up the scandal, Campana married Constanzo Palmieri d’Aragona. While it is not confirmed, many researches predict that this was a way for the family to save face, while also allowing Ferdinand to continue to see Campana. The Cardinal provided for Tullia her classical education in the humanities; young Tullia proved to be a child prodigy who amazed even her mother's 'guests.' Because Tullia's mother was not married to her father, Tullia's life was marked by the stigma of her illegitimate birth to a courtesan mother.\n\nEntering into the world as courtesan at age 18, Tullia became successful as a writer and an intellectual. She was often seen in the company of poets, such as Sperone Speroni. After the Cardinal's death in 1519, Tullia spent seven years in Siena, before she returned to Rome in 1526. Available evidence suggests that she was highly mobile and stayed in Bologna in 1529, where Pope Clement VII and Holy Roman Emperor Charles V were engaged in negotiations after the Sack of Rome in 1527.\n\nIn 1531, she became involved with Filippo Strozzi, a Florentine banking magnate who had been famous for a short-lived affair with Italy's most beautiful courtesan, Camilla Pisana. Strozzi became so enamored with d'Aragona that he shared state secrets with her and had to be recalled to Florence. Other lovers included Emilio Orsini, who founded a Tullia Society of six cavaliers who protected her honor.\n\nIn 1535, Penelope d’Aragona was born in Rome. Scholars debate whether Penelope d'Aragona was Tullia's daughter (Tullia at the time was 25 years old), or her sister, as the family claimed.\n\nAt age 30, Tullia moved to Venice, where she became involved with poet Bernardo Tasso.\n\nIn 1537, Battista Stambellino's correspondence to Isabella D'Este suggests she was living in Ferrara. Ferrara was a capital for arts and culture, and d'Aragona made full use of her skills for singing and sharp-tongued entertainment. Two of Italy's literary giants, Girolamo Muzio and Ercole Bentivoglio, both fell in love with her. Muzio wrote five ardent eclogues to her, naming her as \"Thalia\", while Bentivoglio went so far as to carve her name on every tree on the Po River. When she left Ferrara four years later, reportedly more than one man had attempted suicide for her.\n\nIn 1543, she is recorded to have married Silvestro Guiccardi of Ferrara, whom we do not know anything about. The only evidence of their relationship is a malicious comment that was made by Agnolo Firenzuola who claimed that Tullia let her husband die of hunger. For Tullia, this marriage acted as a way for her to “exempt herself from living in the neighborhood designated for prostitues,” and allowed her to wear clothing that distinguished her as a noble woman. Tullia did, however, have a confirmend son Celio, who is mentioned in her will, but it is unconfirmed whether or not Guiccardi was the father.\n\nIn 1545/6, she was again in Siena, but fled civic unrest there and arrived in Florence, where she became an attendant at the court of Cosimo I de Medici, then Grand Duke of Tuscany.\n\nWhile there, she composed \"Dialogues on the Infinity of Love\" (1547), which is a Neo-Platonist assertion of women's sexual and emotional autonomy within exchanges of romantic love. \"Initially published in Venice, Italy in 1547 (in Italian), the novel has been translated in recent years in English for the first time by Rinaldina Russell and Bruce Merry in 1997. This book of philosophy was the first of its kind, for it cast a female rather than a male as the main commentator/ knowledge holder on the ethics of love. During Tullia's life, all forms of sensual experiences were considered sacrilegious, but Tulia argues in her work that all sexual drives are uncontrollable and blameless, and that they combined with spiritual needs create the only moral form of love. The only way for love to be honorable, according to this piece, is if both males and females accept and acknowledge their sexual and spiritual desires (of their body and soul). This concept not only validated the importance of sexual desires within a society that choose to repress such things, but also vindicated the role and power of women in a society that viewed women as less than. Tullia brings women to an equal level with men in regards to both their sexual nature and their intellect.\"\n\nDuring the preceding century, the Medici court had sponsored considerable revival of Neo-Platonist scholarship, particularly Marsilio Ficino, who had also written on the nature of sexual desire and love from this perspective. At the same time, she wrote a series of sonnets that praised the attributes of prominent Florentine noblemen of her era, or celebrated contemporary literary figures. Her last known work, \"Il Meschino\", is an epic poem, which related the experiences of a captive youth, Giarrino, who was enslaved and journeyed across Europe, Africa and Asia, as well as Purgatory and Hell, trying to find his lost parents.\n\nAs an aging forty-year-old, d'Aragona continued writing sonnets, especially to historian and poet Benedetto Varchi, who inspired her. With his patronage and her intellect, she turned her house into a philosophical academy for the \"cognoscenti\", and she continued to thrive as a writer.\n\nAfter this, d'Aragona returned to Rome from Florence, and little further is known about her life. She died in 1556 in Rome. After her death, there were posthumous editions of her work in Italian, in 1552, 1694, 1864, 1912, 1974, 1975 and 1980. Her work has been discussed in the University of Chicago's \"The Other Voice in Early Modern Europe\" series, which deals with texts from Renaissance era female authors, as well as male advocates of women's emancipation from that era.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "31902", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31902", "title": "Universalism", "text": "Universalism\n\nUniversalism is a theological and philosophical concept that some ideas have universal application or applicability. A community that calls itself \"universalist\" may emphasize the universal principles of most religions, and accept others in an inclusive manner. It is centered around the belief in a universal reconciliation between humanity and the divine. For example, some forms of Abrahamic religions claim the universal value of their doctrine and moral principles, and \"feel inclusive\".\n\nChristian Universalism is focused around the idea of universal reconciliation. Also known as universal salvation, it is a doctrine stating that every human soul will ultimately be reconciled to God because of divine love and mercy.\n\nA belief in one fundamental truth is another important tenet in Universalism. The living truth is seen as more far-reaching than the national, cultural, or religious boundaries or interpretations of that one truth. As the Rig Veda states, \"Truth is one; sages call it by various names.\"\n\nUniversalism has had an influence on modern day Hinduism, in turn influencing western modern spirituality.\n\nUnitarian Universalism emphasizes that religion is a universal human quality, and also focuses on the universal principles of most religions. They accept all religions in an inclusive manner.\n\nIn philosophy, universality is the notion that universal facts can be discovered and is therefore understood as being in opposition to relativism.\n\nIn certain religions, universalism is the quality ascribed to an entity whose existence is consistent throughout the universe.\n\nMoral universalism (also called \"moral objectivism\" or \"universal morality\") is the meta-ethical position that some system of ethics are applied universally. That system is inclusive of all individuals, regardless of culture, race, sex, religion, nationality, sexual orientation, or any other distinguishing feature. Moral universalism is opposed to moral nihilism and moral relativism. However, not all forms of moral universalism are absolutist, nor do they necessarily value monism. Many forms of universalism, such as utilitarianism, are non-absolutist. Other forms such as those theorized by Isaiah Berlin, may value pluralist ideals.\n\nIn Bahá'í belief, a single God has sent all the historic founders of the world religions in a process of progressive revelation. As a result, the major world religions are seen as divine in origin and are continuous in their purpose. In this view, there is unity among the founders of world religions, but each revelation brings a more advanced set of teachings in human history and none are syncretic.\n\nWithin this universal view, the unity of humanity is one of the central teachings of the Bahá'í Faith. The Bahá'í teachings state that since all humans have been created in the image of God, God does not make any distinction between people with regard to race, colour or religion. Thus, because all humans have been created equal, they all require equal opportunities and treatment. Hence the Bahá'í view promotes the unity of humanity, and that people's vision should be world-embracing and that people should love the whole world rather than just their nation.\n\nThe teaching, however, does not equate unity with uniformity; instead the Bahá'í writings advocate the principle of \"unity in diversity\" where the variety in the human race is valued. Operating on a worldwide basis this cooperative view of the peoples and nations of the planet culminates in a vision of the practicality of the progression in world affairs towards, and the inevitability of, world peace.\n\nThe fundamental idea of Christian Universalism is universal reconciliation – that all humans will eventually be saved. They will eventually enter God's kingdom in Heaven, through the grace and works of the lord Jesus Christ. Christian Universalism teaches that an eternal Hell does not exist, and that it was not what Jesus had taught. They point to historical evidence showing that some early fathers of the church were universalists, and attribute the perpetuating idea of hell to eternal mistranslation.\n\nUniversalists cite numerous Biblical passages which reference the salvation of all beings. In addition, they argue that an eternal hell is both unjust, and against the nature and attributes of a loving God.\n\nThe remaining beliefs of Christian Universalism are generally compatible with the fundamentals of Christianity\n\nIn 1899 the Universalist General Convention, later called the Universalist Church of America, adopted the Five Principles: the belief in God, Jesus Christ, the immortality of the human soul, the reality of sin and universal reconciliation.\n\nUniversalist writers such as George T. Knight have claimed that Universalism was a widely held view among theologians in Early Christianity. These included such important figures such as Alexandrian scholar Origen as well as Clement of Alexandria, a Christian theologian. Origen and Clement both included the existence of a non-eternal Hell in their teachings. Hell was remedial, in that it was a place one went to purge one's sins before entering into Heaven.\n\nThe first undisputed documentations of Christian Universalist ideas occurred in 17th-century England and 18th-century Europe as well as in colonial America. Between 1648-1697 English activist Gerrard Winstanley, writer Richard Coppin, and dissenter Jane Leade, each taught that God would grant all human beings salvation. The same teachings were later spread throughout 18th-century France and America by George de Benneville. People who taught this doctrine in America would later become known as the Universalist Church of America.\n\nThe Greek term \"apocatastas\" came to be related by some to the beliefs of Christian Universalism, but central to the doctrine was the restitution, or restoration of all sinful beings to God, and to His state of blessedness. In early Patristics, usage of the term is distinct.\n\nUniversalist theology is grounded in history, scripture and assumptions about the nature of God. Thomas Whittemore wrote the book \"100 Scriptural Proofs that Jesus Christ Will Save All Mankind\" quoting both Old and New Testament verses which support the Universalist viewpoint.\n\nSome Bible verses he cites and are cited by other Christian Universalists are:\n\nChristian Universalists point towards the mistranslations of the Greek word αιών (Lit. aion), as giving rise to the idea of Eternal Hell, and the idea that some people will not be saved.\n\nThis Greek word is the origin of the modern English word aeon, which refers to a period of time or an epoch.\n\nThe 19th century theologian Marvin Vincent wrote about the word \"aion\", and the supposed connotations of \"eternal\" or \"temporal\":\nAion, transliterated aeon, is a period of longer or shorter duration, having a beginning and an end, and complete in itself. [...] Neither the noun nor the adjective, in themselves, carry the sense of \"endless\" or \"everlasting\".\"\n\nDr. Ken Vincent writes that \"When it (aion) was translated into Latin Vulgate, \"aion\" became \"aeternam\" which means \"eternal\".\n\nUnity Church, Religious Science, and Divine Science are denominations within the New Thought movement. Each teaches that there is a common thread of truth at the heart of all religions. New Thought is an ever-evolving belief system which will incorporate \"Truth\" where ever it is found, hence the name \"New Thought\". \"All is God, But God transcends all\".\n\nUnitarian Universalism (UU) is a theologically liberal religion characterized by a \"free and responsible search for truth and meaning\". Unitarian Universalists do not share a creed; rather, they are unified by their shared search for spiritual growth and by the understanding that an individual's theology is a result of that search and not a result of obedience to an authoritarian requirement. Unitarian Universalists draw from all major world religions and many different theological sources and have a wide range of beliefs and practices.\n\nWhile having its origins in Christianity, UU is no longer a Christian church. As of 2006, fewer than about 20% of Unitarian Universalists identified themselves as Christian. Contemporary Unitarian Universalism espouses a pluralist approach to religious belief, whereby members may describe themselves as humanist, agnostic, deist, atheist, pagan, Christian, monotheist, pantheist, polytheist, or assume no label at all.\n\nThe Unitarian Universalist Association (UUA) was formed in 1961, a consolidation of the American Unitarian Association, established in 1825, and the Universalist Church of America, established in 1866. It is headquartered in Boston, and mainly serves churches in the United States. The Canadian Unitarian Council became an independent body in 2002.\n\nUniversalism is not only a set of values, but a worldview to which any can subscribe if they observe and believe in the universality of the human experience—and that of all sentient life—and work to uphold the principles, ethics, and actions that safeguard these fundamental things.\n\nIndeed, many Universalists may be attracted to the logic of universally applicable principles, rather than any belief or dogma. Human unity, solidarity, and the perceived need for a sustainable and socially conscious global order are among the tendencies of non-religious Universalist thought.\n\nAuthor David Frawley says that Hinduism has a \"background universalism\" and its teachings contain a \"universal relevance.\" Hinduism is also naturally religiously pluralistic. A well-known \"Rig Vedic\" hymn says: \"Truth is One, though the sages know it variously.\" Similarly, in the \"Bhagavad Gītā\" (4:11), God, manifesting as an incarnation, states: \"As people approach me, so I receive them. All paths lead to me.\" The Hindu religion has no theological difficulties in accepting degrees of truth in other religions. Hinduism emphasizes that everyone actually worships the same God, whether one knows it or not.\n\nWhile Hinduism has an openness and tolerance towards other religions, it also has a wide range of diversity within it. There are considered to be six orthodox Hindu schools of philosophy/theology, as well as multiple unorthodox or \"hetrodox\" traditions called darshanas.\n\n\"Hindu Universalism\", also called \"Neo-Vedanta\" and \"neo-Hinduism\", is a modern interpretation of Hinduism which developed in response to western colonialism and orientalism. It denotes the ideology that all religions are true and therefore worthy of toleration and respect.\n\nIt is a modern interpretation that aims to present Hinduism as a \"homogenized ideal of Hinduism\" with Advaita Vedanta as its central doctrine. For example, it presents that:\nHinduism embraces universalism by conceiving the whole world as a single family that deifies the one truth, and therefore it accepts all forms of beliefs and dismisses labels of distinct religions which would imply a division of identity.\n\nThis modernised re-interpretation has become a broad current in Indian culture, extending far beyond the Dashanami Sampradaya, the Advaita Vedanta Sampradaya founded by Adi Shankara. An early exponent of Hindu Universalism was Ram Mohan Roy, who established the Brahmo Samaj. Hindu Universalism was popularised in the 20th century in both India and the west by Vivekananda and Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan. Veneration for all other religions was articulated by Gandhi:\nWestern orientalists played an important role in this popularisation, regarding Vedanta to be the \"central theology of Hinduism\". Oriental scholarship portrayed Hinduism as a \"single world religion\", and denigrated the heterogeneousity of Hindu beliefs and practices as 'distortions' of the basic teachings of Vedanta.\n\nIslam recognizes to a certain extent the validity of the Abrahamic religions, the Quran identifying Jews, Christians, and \"Sabi'un\" (usually taken as a reference to the Mandaeans) as \"people of the Book\" (\"ahl al-kitab\"). Later Islamic theologians expanded this definition to include Zoroastrians, and later even Hindus, as the early Islamic empire brought many people professing these religions under its dominion, but the Qur'an explicitly identifies only Jews, Christians, and Sabians as People of the Book. The relation between Islam and universalism has assumed crucial importance in the context of political Islam or Islamism, particularly in reference to Sayyid Qutb, a leading member of the Muslim Brotherhood movement, and one of the key contemporary philosophers of Islam.\n\nThere are several views within Islam with respect to Universalism. According to the most inclusive teachings, common among the liberal Muslim movements, all monotheistic religions or people of the book have a chance of salvation. For example, Surah 2:62,256 states that: \n\nHowever, the most exclusive teachings disagree. For example, the Salafi refer to Surah 9:5,29: \n\nThe interpretation of all of these passages are hotly contested amongst various schools of thought, traditionalist and reform-minded, and branches of Islam, from the reforming Quranism and Ahmadiyya to the ultra-traditionalist Salafi, as is the doctrine of abrogation (\"naskh\") which is used to determine which verses take precedence, based on reconstructed chronology, with later verses superseding earlier ones. The traditional chronology places Surah 9 as the last or second-to-last surah revealed, thus, in traditional exegesis, it gains a large power of abrogation, and verses 9:5,29,73 are held to have abrogated 2:256 The ahadith also play a major role in this, and different schools of thought assign different weightings and rulings of authenticity to different hadith, with the four schools of Sunni thought accepting the Six Authentic Collections, generally along with the Muwatta Imam Malik. Depending on the level of acceptance of rejection of certain traditions, the interpretation of the Koran can be changed immensely, from the Qur'anists and Ahmadiyya who reject the ahadith, to the Salafi, or \"ahl al-hadith\", who hold the entirety of the traditional collections in great reverence.\n\nTraditional Islam views the world as bipartite, consisting of the House of Islam, that is, where people live under the Sharia; and the House of War, that is, where the people do not live under Sharia, which must be proselytized using whatever resources available, including, in some traditionalist and conservative interpretations, the use of violence, as holy struggle in the path of God, to either convert its inhabitants to Islam, or to rule them under the Shariah (cf. dhimmi).\n\nJudaism teaches that God chose the Jewish people to be in a unique covenant with God, and one of their beliefs is that Jewish people were charged by the Torah with a specific mission—to be a light unto the nations, and to exemplify the covenant with God as described in the Torah to other nations. This view does not preclude a belief that God also has a relationship with other peoples—rather, Judaism holds that God had entered into a covenant with all humanity as Noachides, and that Jews and non-Jews alike have a relationship with God, as well as being universal in the sense that it is open to all mankind.\n\nAn on-line organization, the Jewish Spiritual Leaders Institute founded and led by Steven Blane, who calls himself an \"American Jewish Universalist Rabbi\", believes in a more inclusive version of Jewish Universalism, stating that \"God equally chose all nations to be lights unto the world, and we have much to learn and share with each other. We can only accomplish Tikkun Olam by our unconditional acceptance of each other's peaceful doctrines.\"\n\nManichaeism, like Christian Gnosticism and Zurvanism, was inherently universalist.\n\nIn Sikhism, all the religions of the world are compared to rivers flowing into a single ocean. Although the Sikh gurus did not agree with the practices of fasting, idolatry and pilgrimage during their times, they stressed that all religions should be tolerated and considered on equal footing. The Sikh scripture, the Guru Granth Sahib, contains the writings of not just the Sikh guru themselves, but the writings of several Hindu and Muslim saints, known as the \"Bhagats\". \n\nThe very first word of the Sikh scripture is \"Ik\", followed by \"Oh-ang-kar\". This literally means that there is only one god, and that one is wholesome, inclusive of the whole universe. It further goes on to state that all of creation, and all energy is part of this primordial being. As such, it is described in scripture over and over again, that all that occurs is part of the divine will, and as such, has to be accepted. It occurs for a reason, even if its beyond the grasp of one person to understand.\n\nAlthough Sikhism does not teach that men are created as an image of God, it states that the essence of the One is to be found throughout all of its creation. As was said by Yogi Bhajan, the man who is credited with having brought Sikhism to the West:\n\"If you can't see God in all, you can't see God at all\". (Sri Singh Sahib, Yogi Bhajan)\n\nThe First Sikh Guru, Guru Nanak said himself:\n\"There is no Hindu, there is no Muslim\".\n\nBy this, Guru Nanak meant that there is no distinction between religion in God's eyes, whether polytheist, monotheist, pantheist, or even atheist, all that one needs to gain salvation is purity of heart, tolerance of all beings, compassion and kindness. Unlike many of the major world religions, Sikhism does not have missionaries, instead it believes men have the freedom to find their own path to salvation.\n\nSome varieties of Zoroastrian (such as Zurvanism) are universalistic in application to all races, but not necessarily universalist in the sense of universal salvation.\n\nIn his book \"The Miracle of Theism: Arguments for and against the Existence of God\", the Australian philosopher J. L. Mackie noted that whilst in the past a miracle performed by Jesus had served as proof to Christians that he was the 'one true God', and that a miracle performed by another religion's deity had served as a (contradictory) proof to its own adherents, the universalist approach resulted in any such miracle being accepted as a validation of all religions, a situation that he characterised as \"Miracle-workers of the world, unite!\"\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "31130713", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31130713", "title": "Warm-glow giving", "text": "Warm-glow giving\n\nWarm-glow giving is an economic theory describing the emotional reward of giving to others. According to the original warm-glow model developed by Andreoni (1989, 1990), people experience a sense of joy and satisfaction for \"doing their part\" to help others. This satisfaction - or \"warm glow\" - represents the selfish pleasure derived from \"doing good\", regardless of the actual impact of one's generosity. Within the warm-glow framework, people may be \"impurely altruistic\", meaning they simultaneously maintain both altruistic and egoistic (selfish) motivations for giving. Whereas \"pure altruists\" (sometimes referred to as \"perfect altruists\") are motivated solely by the desire to provide for a recipient, impure altruists are also motivated by the joy of giving (warm glow). Importantly, warm glow is distinctly non-pecuniary, meaning it arises independent of the possibility of financial reward. Therefore, the warm glow phenomenon is distinct from reciprocal altruism, which may imply a direct financial incentive. Warm-glow giving is a useful economic framework to consider public good provision, collective action problems, charitable giving, and gifting behavior. The existence of a warm glow helps to explain the absence of complete crowding-out of private giving by public grants, as predicted by classical economic models under the neutrality hypothesis. Outside of economics, warm glow has been applied to sociology, political science, environmental policy, healthcare, and business. Conceptually, warm-glow giving is related to the notion of a \"helper's high\" and appears to be resilient across cultures. \n\nWarm glow is built upon the idea of impure altruism: the blend of both altruistic and egoistic desires to help others. Philosophers have debated this idea since the time of the ancient Greeks. In the Socratic \"dialogues\", motivation may be traced to an egotistic concern for one's own welfare, thus denying the plausibility of pure altruism. Similarly, Plato's organization of motivations as responses to hunger-based desires highlights the foundational importance of egoism in all social interactions. However, in Nichomachean Ethicsand Eudemian Ethics, Aristotle considers both the possibility and necessity of altruism to fulfill high-order eudaimonic goals, thus setting the stage for an ongoing philosophical debate. Hobbes, Kant, Nietzsche, Bentham, J.S. Millargued against the possibility of pure altruismand advanced the doctrine of psychological egoism, while others (Butler, Hume, Rousseau, Adam Smith, Nagel) argued for the existence of altruistic motives. Conceptually, the warm-glow model represents a stylized compromise between these two perspectives, allowing for individuals to be purely altruistic, purely egoistic, or impurely altruistic. Warm glow is at least tangentially related to the topic of free will, as people should only reap the psychological reward of helping if they freely choose to do so.\n\nThe normative theory of Ricardian equivalence suggests that private spending should be unresponsive to fiscal policy because forward-looking individuals smooth their consumption, consistent with Modigliani's life-cycle hypothesis. Applied to the provision of charities or public goods, Ricardian equivalence and the classical assumption of pure altruism together support the neutrality hypothesis, implying perfect substitutability between private and public contributions. The neutrality hypothesis assumes rational economic agents are indifferent to whether a cause is funded by the private or public sector; only the level of funding is relevant. A consequence of neutrality under perfect altruism is that government grants should completely crowd-out private donations. That is, a dollar given by the government takes the place of a dollar that would have been given by a private citizen. To illustrate, economic agents operating under the neutrality hypothesis would give to a cause until complete provision, beyond which they would contribute nothing. This is consistent with Andreoni's conceptualization of \"pure altruism\"; however it is inconsistent with impure altruism or pure egoism. Thus, warm glow and the failure to act as purely altruistic present fundamental challenges to the neutrality hypothesis and Ricardian equivalence. In economics, violations to the neutrality hypothesis pose serious concerns for macroeconomic policies involving taxation and redistribution; and microeconomic theories for collective actionand public good provision. Several of Andreoni's contemporaries simultaneously provided evidence against neutrality-driven crowding-out effects, including Kingma (1989) and Khanna et al. (1995). Taken together, these findings offered a strong rebuke of the assumption that public grants crowd-out private donations to public goods.\nAndreoni's economic model of impure altruism considers a simplistic world with only two goods: a private good and a public good. A given individual, endowed with wealth formula_1faces the budget constraint: formula_2where formula_3represents consumption of a private good, and formula_4represents the contribution to the public good. To the extent that formula_5positively contributes to utility, it may be interpreted as the degree of warm glow.It follows that the total provision of the public good, G, is simply: formula_6and the total contributions to the public good from all other individuals is denoted as: formula_7Thus, the public good is the sum of the formula_8person's contribution formula_9along with the total contributions of all other individuals formula_10\n\n(1) formula_11where formula_12\n\nAll individuals in this naïve economy face the same utility functions, given by:\n\n(2)formula_13\n\nwhere the utility functions represent the utility for private, egoistic consumption formula_14the utility derived from the public good formula_15and the warm-glow utility of the contribution towards the public good formula_16An altruist should derive no additional utility from the act of giving: formula_17whereas a pure egoist derives pleasure only from the warm glow of giving, without care for the public good itself, hence formula_18\n\nFrom the budget constraint and utility function, one can derive the utility maximization function, formula_19which is the original utility function (2) transformed using the definition of the public good (1).\n\nAssuming a strategy of utility maximization, the model of warm glow offers many important economic predictions. Specifically, it presents three contrarian insights to those of classical economics under Ricardian equivalence. \n\nFirst, warm-glow theory predicts that income transfers will increase net giving only when income is transferred to more altruistic individuals. Second, it suggests that the provision of a public good is dependent upon the distribution of income within a population. Third, it suggests that public fund of public goods through lump-sum taxes will be more effective than relying upon altruism in the private sector. Individually and collectively, these propositions are in stark contrast to the laissez-faire doctrine of Ricardian economics. Following this original model, warm glow has conceptually evolved with new applications across disciplines to explain and encourage prosocial behavior.\nMany of the advances in warm glow research stem not from economics, but from psychology. In particular, research on motivations and affect have played a key role in defining and operationalizing warm glow for broad application. \n\n\"\"...a millionaire does not really care whether his money does good or not, provided he finds his conscience eased and his social status improved by giving it away...\" -George Bernard Shaw.\" \n\nAs illustrated in Shaw's quote, both intrinsic desires of conscience and extrinsic desires of social status may motivate giving. Warm glow has traditionally been restricted to intrinsic motivation, however this distinction is often murky. \n\nThere has been considerable inconsistency in the literature as to whether a warm glow refers to intrinsic or extrinsic motivation. According to Andreoni (2006), \"putting warm-glow into the model is, while intuitively appealing, an admittedly \"ad hoc\" fix\". Further elaborating on the topic, he and colleagues wrote that the concept was \"originally a placeholder for more specific models of individual and social motivations\". From this initial ambiguity, different authors have at times referred to the phenomenon as solely intrinsic, both intrinsic and extrinsic, or solely extrinsic. Some authors have made deliberate distinctions between prestige-seeking (extrinsic) and the intrinsic components of warm glow, but many have not. Conceptualization of warm glow as either intrinsic or extrinsic has implications for motivational crowding out, satiation effects, and expected magnitude.\nThe most common and classically \"correct\" interpretation of warm glow is as a solely intrinsic phenomenon. Language referring to the \"joy of giving\", \"the positive emotional experience from the act of helping others\", \"the moral satisfaction of helping others\" and the \"internal satisfaction of giving\" suggests an intrinsic drive. The intrinsic component of warm glow is the private emotional benefit to giving.\n\nMuch of the ambiguity surrounding the motivational processes of warm glow has arisen from the misclassification of extrinsic rewards to intrinsic processes. While intrinsic desires center upon emotional gains, extrinsic rewards may include recognition, identity signaling, and prestige. Extrinsic motivation may also take the form of punishment (negative warm glow), in the form of censure or blame. Some research has explicitly focused on extrinsic warm glow, such as \"relational warm glow\".\n\nOne area that has been frequently confused in the literature involves the classification of guilt, which is an introjected form of extrinsic motivation.\n\nThe classification of warm glow as either intrinsic or extrinsic has important ramifications for policy makers. The extensive body of literature on motivational crowding out suggests the efficacy of policies promoting altruistic behavior may be a function of whether pre-existing behavior is intrinsically or extrinsically motivated. The extent to which extrinsic incentives may be substitutes for intrinsic motivations depends upon the motivational classification of the warm glow model. Furthermore, intrinsic warm glow may be more resilient to satiation effects than extrinsic warm glow. Finally, the expected magnitude of a warm glow will be a function of how it is characterized. Models assuming a purely intrinsic warm glow should report lesser warm glows than models also including extrinsic components.\n\nThe phenomenon of warm-glow giving was originally introduced as an economic model. It its original form, the warm-glow model lacked a satisfactory explanation for the underlying psychological processes. Early studies of warm glow were deliberately vague in attributing the experience to a cause. A more recent body of research has identified several important determinants of warm glow, including social distance, vividness to the beneficiary, and guilt avoidance. Taken together, these observations suggest the warm glow may be best described as the visceral manifestation of empathy. This is consistent with the moral psychological literature of empathy, most notably as advanced by Batson. In his \"empathy-altruism hypothesis\", Batson claims that empathy (\"feeling sympathetic, compassionate, warm, softhearted, tender\") evokes a desire for other-regarding behavior.\n\nSocial distance is an important determinant of warm glow, particularly in the framework of empathy. Prior research has examined the link between emotional arousal and social distance, finding that mutual suffering and shared joy both increase as a function of social similarity. Consistent with the \"identifiable victim effect\", research has shown that people express a greater willingness to help when others are known, as opposed to statistical.\nWhile the vividness of the beneficiary is captured in social distance, the vividness to the beneficiary refers to a beneficiary's ability to perceive that kindness has been done upon them. As a determinant of warm glow, vividness to the beneficiary operates on two levels. The primary level concerns whether a beneficiary is aware that kindness has been given to them, absent any attribution of the source. The secondary level involves the identifiability of the benefactor. Warm glow should be positively impacted by both levels for vividness. \n\nRecent work has identified guilt avoidance as an important component of warm glow. Some have even compared guilt as the \"flip side\" of warm glow. Parameterizing guilt as a component of warm glow allows for deficit values of warm glow, which was originally constrained to strictly positive values in Andreoni (1989, 1990). In a recent publication, Andreoni and colleagues explain this by writing: \"Psychologists posit that giving is initiated by a stimulus that elevates sympathy or empathy in the mind of the potential giver, much as the smell of freshly baked bread can pique appetite. Resolving this feeling comes either by giving and feeling good or by not giving and feeling guilt.\" In other notable overviews of warm glow, this phenomenon has been characterized as \"personal distress\". In surveys of self-reported guilt, people experience roughly as much interpersonal and societal guilt as they do personal guilt. Furthermore, half of the survey respondents prefer to directly address and resolve their feelings of guilt. Taken together, these findings suggest a substantial component of guilt aversion.\n\nEvidence from neural imaging supports the warm-glow effect. Recent research using functional magnetic resonance imaging of subjects making donation decisions identifies the subgeneal area and the ventral striatum as regions associated with social giving. The mesolimbic rewards of giving are neurologically similar to receiving material rewards. While there is some evidence for a \"literal warm glow\" - in which an individual's perceived thermal state is elevated by the act of giving due to activation in the insula - the more general consensus across the psychological and neurobiological fields is that helping others makes people happy through the release of the oxytocin and endorphins.\n\nOne of the earliest attempts to formally model the warm glow phenomenon can be found in \"A Theory of the Calculus of Voting\" by Riker and Ordeshook (1968). Resolving the paradox by which rational individuals would never expend the effort to vote due to the statistical near-improbability of \"having their vote count\" (casting the decisive vote), Riker and Ordeshook highlighted the psychological utility of voting for one's preferred candidate. Just as an economic warm glow motivates people to willingly forego their scarce resources, the psychological utility described in early voting models serves to explain otherwise irrational behavior. The warm glow of voting continues to be an important consideration in ethical voter models.\n\nIn efforts to design effective, enduring, and efficient environmental interventions, many scholars and policy makers have focused on warm-glow effects. Because many forms of extrinsic rewards and punishments have failed to promote long-term improvements in environmentally conscious behavior, there is a growing emphasis on intrinsic warm glow. Intervention experiments offer promising results in areas such as supporting green energy, recycling and waste reduction, energy consumption, carpooling initiatives. \n\nSupporting businesses engaged in corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives may give consumers a vicarious warm glow. However, recent research suggests that consumers may expect to overpay when companies engage in CSR due to perceptions of price fairness. The implication that \"doing good\" carries a financial burden for businesses leads consumers to infer general price markups. This body of research cautions that corporate warm glows may be coupled with \"cold prickles\" of extra costs.\nWarm glow can be a central element of cause marketing, in which products are paired with donations. When consumers are exposed to products with a direct cause marketing association, their appraisal of both the product and the company may improve due to warm glow. There is also evidence that product warm glows may play a role in a process called \"hedonic licensing\", in which consumers who perceive a moral surplus subsequently allow themselves more leeway to make selfish purchases.\n\nCommon phenomena such as avoiding eye contact with beggars or adjusting one's route to avoid a solicitor may be explained using the warm glow model.\n\nOne behavioral consequence of warm glow is strategic avoidance of giving opportunities. According to this hypothesis, individuals anticipate their warm glow upon identifying a future giving opportunity. Assuming a functional form that allows warm glow to be negative (driven by a \"guilt\" of not giving), people may strategically and effortfully avoid giving situations. The strategic incentive is easily understood through the utility function formula_20where the warm glow formula_21is positive for a donation (joy of giving) and negative for not giving (guilt). For an agent who would suffer a disutility of giving at their desired level formula_22because the marginal utility of private expenditure formula_23exceeds the marginal utility of warm-glow giving, they should prefer to give nothing formula_24Because giving nothing may be associated with guilt, the utility of formula_25will be negative. Therefore, for a rational agent who cannot justify giving, formula_26, can maximize their utility through avoiding a giving situation, effectively dropping the warm glow argument from their utility functions. Thus, formula_27suggests avoidance of giving opportunities is a preferred strategy for individuals who experience guilt as a negative warm glow. Economic models assign a cost of effort to avoidance, and predict that people will incur such effort whenever formula_28where formula_29is the utility of not giving, formula_30is the cost of avoidance, and formula_31is the utility of giving to a solicitor, conditional upon not avoiding. \n\nThrough this lens, avoidance can be viewed as an economic commitment device, where a person commits to avoiding a situation (being asked to give) in which they are likely to surrender to temptation (giving). Central to this avoidance hypothesis is that individuals can anticipate their behavior in high-empathy \"hot states\", while in low-empathy \"cold states\". While this model assumes a high degree of sophistication on the part of the individual, research by Andreoni, Rao, and Trachtman explores this very phenomenon by observing avoidance and donation behavior of customers entering a supermarket during the holidays. Customers often walked to a further entrance to avoid solicitors for the Salvation Army. According to their model, \"empathetically vulnerable\" individuals who are not be able to give (for budgetary reasons), faced the greatest incentive to avoid collectors because of the guilt they would experience upon saying \"no\". \n\nCharities may strategically employ categorical donor recognition. For example, a charitable organization may distinguish any gift between $500-$999.99 by a title distinct from that awarded for gifts above $1,000. As a consequence, the social signaling component of the warm-glow effect (in extrinsic operationalizations of warm glow) suggests individuals should be motivated to make the minimum donation to acquire their desired categorical status. Consistent with this hypothesis, research has indicated significant grouping behavior of donors around category minimums. \n\nA majority of those who choose to give some portion of their wealth to charity support multiple different causes. Rather than giving 100% of their cumulative donations to the same source, there exists a widespread preference to distribute funds across charities. The warm glow model explains this be recognizing that givers receive multiple warm glows by giving to multiple causes, thus supporting the preference to make many smaller contributions. As a consequence, some scholars suggest an efficiency loss due to high volumes of small donations - which are less efficient to process - rather than fewer large donations. Moral philosopher Peter Singermentions warm-glow givers in his 2015 book, \"The Most Good You Can Do\". Singer states that these types of donors \"give small amounts to many charities [and] are not so interested in whether what they are doing helps others.\" He references \"empathetic concern\" and \"personal distress\" as two distinct components of warm-glow givers.\n\nWarm glow may offer an explanation for some of the observed inefficiencies in charitable giving. For example, United States citizens directed more than 60% of their total charitable contributions to religious groups, education institutions, art organizations, and foundations in 2017; compared to under 7% in foreign aid. According to models of social justice and economic QALYs, in which human lives are treated with equal dignity and equal respect - regardless of race, gender, or place of origin - the goal of charity should be to fight global poverty. Similarly, economic models, which attempt to place a monetary value on the human life, highlight the inefficiency of all philanthropy not used to combat global poverty, which offers the highest marginal return. The warm-glow model accounts for such inefficiency because impure altruists may be insensitive to the actual cause, and more sensitive to the act of giving or size of the gift. Thus, warm-glow may generate philanthropic inefficiencies to the extent that it desensitizes potential donors to the marginal impact of a given charity. In response to this concern, Willian MacAskill and colleagues have advanced a process of philanthropic allocation called \"effective altruism\". This methodology seeks to leverage logic and responsibility to identify effective charitable opportunities, thus minimizing the effect of warm-glow in the decision-making process.\n\nA common criticism of the warm-glow paradigm is that it seems ad-hoc. Indeed, Andreoni, the father of the original model, stated that \"putting warm-glow into the model is, while intuitively appealing, an admittedly \"ad hoc\" fix\". As the body of research has evolved over nearly 30 years - incorporating philosophical, psychological, and physiological insights - it has become a better descriptive model of behavior. \n\nAn obscure criticism of the warm-glow paradigm is that it necessitates self-deception. This argument states that in order to reap the emotional reward of helping others, one must believe his actions to be motivated altruistically. Yet, the mere existence of a warm glow should then contradict the belief of pure altruism. A question arises as to whether prolonged self-delusion is sustainable and impervious to learning through self-perception. \n\nSome research has investigated the link between warm glow and the phenomenon of mere exposure, leading researchers to consider warm glow as a heuristic.\n\n"}

Named for its traditional author, \"Master Zhuang\" (Zhuangzi), the \"Zhuangzi\" isalong with the \"Tao Te Ching\"one of the two foundational texts of Daoism, and is generally considered the most important of all Daoist writings.\n\nThe \"Zhuangzi\" consists of a large collection of anecdotes, allegories, parables, and fables, which are often humorous or irreverent in nature.

The fables and anecdotes in the text attempt to illustrate the falseness of human distinctions between good and bad, large and small, life and death, and human and nature. While other ancient Chinese philosophers focused on moral and personal duty, Zhuangzi promoted carefree wandering and becoming one with \"the Way\" (\"Dào\" 道) by following nature.\n\nThough primarily known as a philosophical work, the \"Zhuangzi\" is regarded as one of the greatest literary works in all of Chinese history, and has been called \"the most important pre-Qin text for the study of Chinese literature.\" A masterpiece of both philosophical and literary skill, it has significantly influenced writers for more than 2000 years from the Han dynasty (206AD220) to the present. Many major Chinese writers and poets in history—such as Sima Xiangru and Sima Qian during the Han dynasty, Ruan Ji and Tao Yuanming during the Six Dynasties (222589), Li Bai during the Tang dynasty (618907), and Su Shi and Lu You in the Song dynasty (9601279)—were heavily influenced by the \"Zhuangzi\".\n\nThe \"Zhuangzi\" is named for and attributed to Zhuang Zhouusually known as \"Master Zhuang\" (Chinese: \"Zhuangzi\" 莊子)a man generally said to have been born around 369 at a place called Meng () in the state of Song (around modern Shangqiu, Henan Province), and to have died around 301, 295, or 286. Almost nothing is concretely known of Zhuangzi's life. He is thought to have spent time in the southern state of Chu, as well as in Linzi, the capital of the state of Qi. Sima Qian's \"Records of the Grand Historian\" (\"Shiji\" 史記), the first of China's 24 dynastic histories, has a biography of Zhuangzi, but most of it seems to have simply been drawn from anecdotes in the \"Zhuangzi\" itself. The American scholar and \"Zhuangzi\" translator Burton Watson noted, \"Whoever Zhuang Zhou was, the writings attributed to him bear the stamp of a brilliant and original mind.\"\n\nScholars have recognized since at least the Song dynasty (9601279) that some parts of the book could not have been written by Zhuangzi himself. Since ancient times, however, its first seven chaptersthe \"nèi piān\" 內篇 \"inner chapters\"have been considered to be the actual work of Zhuangzi, and most modern scholars agree with this view. How many, if any, of the remaining 26 chaptersthe \"wài piān\" 外篇 \"outer chapters\" and \"zá piān\" 雜篇 \"miscellaneous chapters\"were written by Zhuangzi has long been debated. It is generally accepted that the middle and later \"Zhuangzi\" chapters are the result of a subsequent process of \"accretion and redaction\" by later authors \"responding to the scintillating brilliance\" of the inner chapters. All of the 33 surviving chapters are accepted as compositions from the 4th to 2nd centuries BC.\n\nDetails of the \"Zhuangzi\"s textual history prior to the Han dynasty (206AD220) are largely unknown. Traces of its influence in late Warring States period (475221) philosophical texts such as the \"Guanzi\", \"Han Feizi\", \"Huainanzi\", and \"Lüshi Chunqiu\" suggest that Zhuangzi's intellectual lineage was already fairly influential in the states of Qi and Chu in the 3rd century. The \"Records of the Grand Historian\" refers to a 100,000-word \"Zhuangzi\" work and references several chapters that are still in the text. The \"Book of Han\" (\"Han shu\" 漢書), finished in AD 111, lists a \"Zhuangzi\" in 52 chapters, which many scholars believe to be the original form of the work. A number of different forms of the \"Zhuangzi\" survived into the Tang dynasty (618907), but a shorter and more popular 33-chapter form of the book prepared by the philosopher and writer Guo Xiang around AD 300 is the source of all surviving editions. In 742, the \"Zhuangzi\" was canonized as one of the Chinese Classics by an imperial proclamation from Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, which awarded it the honorific title \"True Scripture of Southern Florescence\" (\"Nanhua zhenjing\" 南華真經), though most orthodox scholars did not consider the \"Zhuangzi\" to be a true \"classic\" (\"jing\" ) due to its non-Confucian nature.\n\nPortions of the \"Zhuangzi\" have been discovered among bamboo slip texts from Warring States period and Han dynasty tombs, particularly at the Shuanggudui and Zhangjiashan Han bamboo texts sites. One of the slips from the Guodian bamboo texts, which date to around 300 BC, contains what appears to be a short fragment from the \"Ransacking Coffers\" (\"Qu qie\" 胠篋) chapter.\n\nA large number of \"Zhuangzi\" fragments dating from the early Tang dynasty were discovered among the Dunhuang manuscripts in the early 20th century by the expeditions of Hungarian-British explorer Aurel Stein and French Sinologist Paul Pelliot. They collectively form about twelve chapters of Guo Xiang's version of the \"Zhuangzi\", and are preserved mostly at the British Library and the Bibliothèque Nationale de France. \n\nAmong the Japanese national treasures preserved in the Kōzan-ji temple in Kyoto is a \"Zhuangzi\" manuscript from the Muromachi period (13381573). The manuscript has seven complete chapters from the \"outer\" and \"miscellaneous\" chapters, and is believed to be a close copy of an annotated edition written in the 7th century by the Chinese Daoist master Cheng Xuanying (成玄英; fl. 630–660).\n\nAlmost all of the 33 surviving \"Zhuangzi\" chapters contain fables and allegories. Most \"Zhuangzi\" stories are fairly short and simple, such as \"Lickety\" and \"Split\" drilling seven holes in \"Wonton\" (chapter 7) or Zhuangzi being discovered sitting and drumming on a basin after his wife dies (chapter 18), although a few are longer and more complex, like the story of Master Lie and the magus (chapter 14) and the account of the Yellow Emperor's music (chapter 14). Unlike the other stories and allegories in other pre-Qin texts, the \"Zhuangzi\" is unique in that the allegories form the bulk of the text, rather than occasional features, and are always witty, emotional, and are not limited to reality.\n\nUnlike other ancient Chinese works, whose allegories were usually based on historical legends and proverbs, most \"Zhuangzi\" stories seem to have been invented by Zhuangzi himself. Some are completely whimsical, such as the strange description of evolution from \"misty spray\" through a series of substances and insects to horses and humans (chapter 18), while a few other passages seem to be \"sheer playful nonsense\" which read like Lewis Carroll's \"Jabberwocky\". The \"Zhuangzi\" is full of quirky and fantastic characters, such as \"Mad Stammerer\", \"Fancypants Scholar\", \"Sir Plow\", and a man who believes his left arm will turn into a rooster, his right arm will turn into a crossbow, and his buttocks will become cartwheels.\n\nA master of language, Zhuangzi sometimes engages in logic and reasoning, but then turns it upside down or carries the arguments to absurdity to demonstrate the limitations of human knowledge and the rational world. Some of Zhuangzi's reasoning, such as his renowned argument with his philosopher friend Huizi (Master Hui) about the joy of fish (chapter 17), have been compared to the Socratic and Platonic dialogue traditions, and Huizi's paradoxes near the end of the book have been termed \"strikingly like those of Zeno of Elea.\"\n\nThe most famous of all \"Zhuangzi\" stories—\"Zhuang Zhou Dreams of Being a Butterfly\"—appears at the end of the second chapter, \"On the Equality of Things\".\n\nThe well-known image of Zhuangzi wondering if he was a man who dreamed of being a butterfly or a butterfly dreaming of being a man is so striking that whole dramas have been written on its theme. In it Zhuangzi \"[plays] with the theme of transformation\", illustrating that \"the distinction between waking and dreaming is another false dichotomy. If [one] distinguishes them, how can [one] tell if [one] is now dreaming or awake?\"\n\nAnother well known Zhuangzi story\"The Death of Wonton\"illustrates the dangers Zhuangzi saw in going against the innate nature of things.\n\nZhuangzi believed that the greatest of all human happiness could be achieved through a higher understanding of the nature of things, and that in order to develop oneself fully one needed to express one's innate ability. In this anecdote, Mair suggests that Zhuangzi humorously and absurdly uses \"Wonton\"a name for both the Chinese conception of primordial chaos and by physical analogy, wonton soupto demonstrate what he believed were the disastrous consequences of going against things' innate natures. In drawing a connection between wonton soup and primordial chaos, however, Eberhard notes that the earliest mention of wonton soup is attested in sources dating to the Tang dynasty, and possibly the Han dynasty, postdating Zhuangzi by at least a century.\n\nThe story of \"The Debate on the Joy of Fish\" is a well-known anecdote that has been compared to the Socratic dialogue tradition of ancient Greece.\nThe exact point made by Zhuangzi in this debate is not entirely clear. The story seems to make the point that \"knowing\" a thing is simply a state of mind, and that it is not possible to determine if that knowing has any objective validity. This story has been cited as an example of Zhuangzi's linguistic mastery, as he subtly uses reason to make an anti-rationalist point.\n\nAnother well-known Zhuangzi story—\"Drumming On a Tub and Singing\"—describes how Zhuangzi did not view death as something to be feared.\n\nZhuangzi seems to have viewed death as a natural process or transformation, where one gives up one form of existence and assumes another. In the second chapter, he makes the point that, for all humans know, death may in fact be better than life: \"How do I know that loving life is not a delusion? How do I know that in hating death I am not like a man who, having left home in his youth, has forgotten the way back?\" His writings teach that \"the wise man or woman accepts death with equanimity and thereby achieves absolute happiness.\"\n\nThe story of Zhuangzi's death, contained in chapter 32 of the text, exemplifies the colorful lore that grew up around Zhuangzi in the decades after his death, as well as the elaboration of the core philosophical ideas contained in the \"inner chapters\" that appears in the \"outer\" and \"miscellaneous chapters\".\n\nThe stories and anecdotes of the \"Zhuangzi\" embody a unique set of principles and attitudes, including living one's life with natural spontaneity, uniting one's inner self with the cosmic \"Way\" (\"Dao\"), keeping oneself distant from politics and social obligations, accepting death as a natural transformation, showing appreciation and praise for things others view as useless or aimless, and stridently rejecting social values and conventional reasoning. These principles form the core ideas of philosophical Daoism. The other major philosophical schools of ancient Chinasuch as Confucianism, Legalism, and Mohismwere all concerned with concrete social, political, or ethical reforms designed to reform people and society and thereby alleviate the problems and suffering of the world. However, Zhuangzi believed that the key to true happiness was to free oneself from the world and its standards through the Daoist principle of \"inaction\" (\"wúwéi\" 無為)action that is not based on any purposeful striving or motives for gainand was fundamentally opposed to systems that impose order on individuals.\n\nThe \"Zhuangzi\" interprets the universe as a thing that changes spontaneously without a conscious God or will driving it, and argues that humans can achieve ultimate happiness by living equally spontaneously. It argues that because of humans' advanced cognitive abilities, they have a tendency to create artificial distinctionssuch as good versus bad, large versus small, usefulness versus uselessness, and social systems like Confucianismthat remove themselves from the natural spontaneity of the universe. In order to illustrate the mindlessness and spontaneity he felt should characterize human action, Zhuangzi most frequently uses the analogy of craftsmen or artisans. As Burton Watson described, \"the skilled woodcarver, the skilled butcher, the skilled swimmer does not ponder or ratiocinate on the course of action he should take; his skill has become so much a part of him that he merely acts instinctively and spontaneously and, without knowing why, achieves success.\" The term \"wandering\" (\"yóu\"遊) is used throughout the stories of the \"Zhuangzi\" to describe how an enlightened person \"wanders through all of creation, enjoying its delights without ever becoming attached to any one part of it.\"\n\nThe \"Zhuangzi\" vigorously opposes formal government, which Zhuangzi seems to have felt was problematic at its foundation \"because of the opposition between man and nature.\" The text tries to show that \"as soon as government intervenes in natural affairs, it destroys all possibility of genuine happiness.\" It is unclear if Zhuangzi's positions were \"tantamount to anarchy, and he was by no means in favor of violence.\" The political references in the \"Zhuangzi\" are more concerned with what government should not do rather than what kind of government should exist.\n\nWestern scholars have long noticed that the \"Zhuangzi\" is often strongly anti-rationalist. Mohism, deriving from Zhuangzi's possible contemporary Mozi, was the most logically sophisticated school in ancient China. Whereas reason and logic became the hallmark of Greek philosophy and then the entire Western philosophical tradition, in China philosophers preferred to rely on moral persuasion and intuition. The \"Zhuangzi\" played a significant role in the traditional Chinese skepticism toward rationalism, as Zhuangzi frequently turns logical arguments upside-down to satirize and discredit them. However, Zhuangzi did not entirely abandon language and reason, but \"only wished to point out that overdependence on them could limit the flexibility of thought.\"\n\nThe \"Zhuangzi\" is by far the most influential purely-literary work dating from before China's imperial unification in 221. Its literary quality, imagination and creativity, and linguistic prowess were entirely unprecedented in the period of its creation. Virtually every major Chinese writer or poet in history, from Sima Xiangru and Sima Qian during the Han dynasty, Ruan Ji and Tao Yuanming during the Six Dynasties, Li Bai during the Tang dynasty, to Su Shi and Lu You in the Song dynasty were \"deeply imbued with the ideas and artistry of the \"Zhuangzi\".\"\n\nTraces of the \"Zhuangzi\"s influence in late Warring States period philosophical texts such as the \"Guanzi\", \"Han Feizi\", \"Huainanzi\", and \"Lüshi Chunqiu\" suggest that Zhuangzi's intellectual lineage was already fairly influential in the states of Qi and Chu in the 3rd century. However, during the Qin and Han dynastieswith their state-sponsored Legalist and Confucian ideologies, respectivelythe \"Zhuangzi\" does not seem to have been highly regarded. One exception is Han dynasty scholar Jia Yi's 170 work \"\"Fu\" on the Owl\" (\"Fúniǎo fù\" ), the earliest definitively known \"fu\" rhapsody, which does not reference the \"Zhuangzi\" by name but cites it for one-sixth of the poem.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Han dynasty in AD 207 and the subsequent chaos of the Three Kingdoms period, both the \"Zhuangzi\" and Zhuang Zhou began to rise in popularity and acclaim. The 3rd century AD poets Ruan Ji and Xi Kang, both members of the famous Seven Worthies of the Bamboo Grove, were ardent \"Zhuangzi\" admirers, and one of Ruan's essays, entitled \"Discourse on Summing Up the \"Zhuangzi\"\" (\"Dá Zhuāng lùn\" 達莊論), is still extant. This period saw Confucianism temporarily surpassed by a revival of Daoism and old divination texts, such as the \"Classic of Changes\" (\"I Ching\" 易經), and many early medieval Chinese poets, artists, and calligraphers were deeply influenced by the \"Zhuangzi\".\n\nThe \"Zhuangzi\" has been called \"the most important of all the Daoist writings\", and its \"inner chapters\" embody the core ideas of philosophical Daoism. In the 4th century AD, the \"Zhuangzi\" became a major source of imagery and terminology for a new form of Daoism known as the \"Highest Clarity\" (\"Shangqing\" 上清) school that was popular among the aristocracy of the Jin dynasty (AD 265420). Highest Clarity Daoism borrowed notable \"Zhuangzi\" terms, such as \"perfected man\" (\"zhēn rén\" ), \"Great Clarity\" (\"Tài Qīng\" ), and \"fasting the mind\" (\"xīn zhāi\" ), and though they are used somewhat differently than in the \"Zhuangzi\" itself, they still show the important role the \"Zhuangzi\" played at the time.\n\nThe \"Zhuangzi\" was very influential in the adaptation of Buddhism to Chinese culture after Buddhism was first brought to China from India in the 1st century AD. Zhi Dun, China's first aristocratic Buddhist monk, wrote a prominent commentary to the \"Zhuangzi\" in the mid-4th century. The \"Zhuangzi\" also played a significant role in the formation of Chan (\"Zen\") Buddhism, which grew out of \"a fusion of Buddhist ideology and ancient Daoist thought.\" Among the traits Chan/Zen Buddhism borrowed from the \"Zhuangzi\" are a distrust of language and logic, an insistence that \"the Dao\" can be found in everything, even dung and urine, and a fondness for dialogues based on riddles or paradigm-challenging statements known as \"gōng'àn\" (; Japanese \"kōan\").\n\nThe \"Zhuangzi\" retained prominence throughout Chinese history as the preeminent example of core Daoist philosophical ideals. The 17th century scholar Gu Yanwu lamented his government's flippant use of the \"Zhuangzi\" on the imperial examination essays as representative of a decline in traditional morals at the end of the Ming dynasty (1368–1644). In the great Chinese novel \"Dream of the Red Chamber\" (\"Hong lou meng\" 紅樓夢), the main protagonist, Jia Baoyu, often turns to the \"Zhuangzi\" for comfort amidst his despair over conflicting love interests and relationships. The story of Zhuangzi drumming on a tub and singing after the death of his wife inspired an entire tradition of folk music called \"funeral drumming\" (\"sàng-gǔ\" ) in central China's Hubei and Hunan Provinces that survived into the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nOutside of China and the traditional \"Sinosphere\", the \"Zhuangzi\" lags far behind the \"Tao Te Ching\" in general popularity, and is rarely known by non-scholars. A number of prominent scholars have attempted to bring the \"Zhuangzi\" to wider attention among Western readers. In 1939, the British translator and Sinologist Arthur Waley described the \"Zhuangzi\" as \"one of the most entertaining as well as one of the profoundest books in the world.\" In the introduction to his 1994 translation of the \"Zhuangzi\", the American Sinologist Victor H. Mair wrote: \"I feel a sense of injustice that the \"Dao De Jing\" is so well known to my fellow citizens while the \"Zhuangzi\" is so thoroughly ignored, because I firmly believe that the latter is in every respect a superior work.\"\n\n\n\n"}
