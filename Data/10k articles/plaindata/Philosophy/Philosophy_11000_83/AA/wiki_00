{"id": "27954947", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27954947", "title": "Apeiron", "text": "Apeiron\n\nApeiron (; ) is a Greek word meaning \"(that which is) unlimited,\" \"boundless\", \"infinite\", or \"indefinite\" from \"a-\", \"without\" and \"peirar\", \"end, limit\", \"boundary\", the Ionic Greek form of \"peras\", \"end, limit, boundary\". It is akin to Persian \"piramon\", meaning \"boundary, circumference, surrounding\".\n\nThe \"apeiron\" is central to the cosmological theory created by Anaximander, a 6th-century BC pre-Socratic Greek philosopher whose work is mostly lost. From the few existing fragments, we learn that he believed the beginning or ultimate reality (\"arche\") is eternal and infinite, or boundless (\"apeiron\"), subject to neither old age nor decay, which perpetually yields fresh materials from which everything we can perceive is derived. \"Apeiron\" generated the opposites (hot–cold, wet–dry, etc.) which acted on the creation of the world (cf. Heraclitus). Everything is generated from \"apeiron\" and then it is destroyed by going back to \"apeiron\", according to necessity. He believed that infinite worlds are generated from \"apeiron\" and then they are destroyed there again.\n\nHis ideas were influenced by the Greek mythical tradition and by his teacher Thales (7th to 6th century BC). Searching for some universal principle, Anaximander retained the traditional religious assumption that there was a cosmic order and tried to explain it rationally, using the old mythical language which ascribed divine control on various spheres of reality. This language was more suitable for a society which could see gods everywhere; therefore the first glimmerings of laws of nature were themselves derived from divine laws. The Greeks believed that the universal principles could also be applied to human societies. The word \"nomos\" (law) may originally have meant \"natural law\" and used later to mean man-made law.\n\nGreek philosophy entered a high level of abstraction. It adopted \"apeiron\" as the origin of all things, because it is completely indefinite. This is a further transition from the previous existing mythical way of thought to the newer rational way of thought which is the main characteristic of the archaic period (8th to 6th century BC). This shift in thought is correlated with the new political conditions in the Greek city states during the 6th century BC.\n\nIn the mythical Greek cosmogony of Hesiod (8th to 7th century BC) the first primordial god is Chaos, which is a void or gap. Chaos is described as a gap either between Tartarus and the earth's surface (Miller's interpretation) or between earth's surface and the sky (Cornford's interpretation). One can name it also abyss (having no bottom).\n\nAlternately, Greek philosopher Thales believed that the origin or first principle was water. Pherecydes of Syros (6th century BC) probably called the water also \"Chaos\" and this is not placed at the very beginning.\n\nIn the creation stories of Near East the primordial world is described formless and empty. The only existing thing prior to creation was the water abyss. The Babylonian cosmology Enuma Elish describes the earliest stage of the universe as one of watery chaos and something similar is described in Genesis.\nIn the Hindu cosmogony which is similar to the Vedic (Hiranyagarbha) the initial state of the universe was an absolute darkness.\n\nHesiod made an abstraction, because his original \"chaos\" is a void, something completely indefinite. In his opinion the origin should be indefinite and indeterminate. The indefiniteness is spatial in early usages as in Homer (indefinite sea). A fragment from Xenophanes (6th century BC) shows the transition from \"chaos\" to \"apeiron\": \"The upper limit of earth borders on air. The lower limit reaches down to the unlimited. (i.e. the Apeiron)\". Either \"apeiron\" meant the \"spatial indefinite\" and was implied to be indefinite in kind, or Anaximander intended it primarily 'that which is indefinite in kind' but assumed it also to be of unlimited extent and duration. His ideas may have been influenced by the Pythagoreans:\nGreek philosophy entered a high level of abstraction making \"apeiron\" the principle of all things and some scholars saw a gap between the existing \"mythical\" and the new \"rational\" way of thought (\"rationalism\"). But if we follow the course, we will see that there is not such an abrupt break with the previous thought. The basic elements of nature, water, air, fire, earth, which the first Greek philosophers believed that composed the world, represent in fact the mythical primordial forces. The collision of these forces produced the cosmic harmony according to the Greek cosmogony (Hesiod). Anaximander noticed the mutual changes between these elements, therefore he chose something else (indefinite in kind) which could generate the others without experiencing any decay.\n\nThere is also a fragment attributed to his teacher Thales: \"What is divine? What has no origin, nor end.\" This probably led his student to his final decision for \"apeiron\", because the divinity applied to it implies that it always existed. The notion of the temporal infinity was familiar to the Greek mind from remote antiquity in the religious conception of immortality and Anaximander's description was in terms appropriate to this conception. This \"arche\" is called \"eternal and ageless\" (Hippolitus I,6,I;DK B2).\n\nThe \"apeiron\" has generally been understood as a sort of primal chaos. It acts as the substratum supporting opposites such as hot and cold, wet and dry, and directed the movement of things, by which there grew up all of the host of shapes and differences which are found in the world.\nOut of the vague and limitless body there sprang a central mass—this earth of ours—cylindrical in shape. A sphere of fire surrounded the air around the earth and had originally clung to it like the bark round a tree. When it broke, it created the sun, the moon and the stars. The first animals were generated in the water. When they came to earth they were transmuted by the effect of the sun. The human being sprung from some other animal, which originally was similar to a fish. The blazing orbs, which have drawn off from the cold earth and water, are the temporary gods of the world clustering around the earth, which to the ancient thinker is the central figure.\n\nIn the commentary of Simplicius on Aristotle's \"Physics\" the following fragment is attributed direct to Anaximander:\n\nThis fragment remains a mystery because it can be translated in different ways. Simplicius comments that Anaximander noticed the mutual changes between the four elements (earth, air, water, fire), therefore he did not choose one of them as an origin, but something else which generates the opposites without experiencing any decay. He mentions also that Anaximander said all these in poetic terms, meaning that he used the old mythical language. The Goddess \"Justice\" (Dike), appears to keep the order. The quotation is close to the original meanings of the relevant Greek words. The word \"dike\" (justice) was probably originally derived from the boundaries of a man's land and transmits metaphorically the notion that somebody must remain in his own sphere, respecting the one of his neighbour. The word \"adikia\" (injustice) means that someone has operated outside of his own sphere, something that could disturb \"law and order\" (\"eunomia\"). In Homer's \"Odyssey\" \"eunomia\" is contrasted with \"hubris\" (arrogance). Arrogance was considered very dangerous because it could break the balance and lead to political instability and finally to the destruction of a \"city-state\".\n\nAetius (1st century BC) transmits a different quotation:\n\nTherefore, it seems that Anaximander argued about \"apeiron\" and this is also noticed by Aristotle:\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche claimed that Anaximander was a pessimist and that he viewed all coming to be as an illegitimate emancipation from the eternal being, a wrong for which destruction is the only penance. In accordance to this the world of the individual definite objects should perish into the indefinite since anything definite has to eventually return to the indefinite. His ideas had a great influence on many scholars including Martin Heidegger.\n\nWerner Heisenberg, noted for the creation of quantum mechanics, arrived at the idea that the elementary particles are to be seen as different manifestations, different quantum states, of one and the same \"primordial substance\". Because of its similarity to the primordial substance hypothesized by Anaximander, his colleague Max Born called this substance \"apeiron\".\n\nScholars in other fields, e.g. Bertrand Russell and Maurice Bowra, didn't deny that Anaximander was the first who used the term \"apeiron\", but claimed that the mysterious fragment is dealing with the balance of opposite forces as central to reality being closer to the quotation transmitted by Simplicius.\n\nThere are also other interpretations which try to match both the previous aspects. \"Apeiron\" is an abstract, void, something that cannot be described according to the Greek pessimistic belief for death. Death indeed meant \"nothingless\". The dead live like shadows and there is no return to the real world. Everything generated from \"apeiron\" must return there according to the principle genesis-decay. There is a polar attraction between the opposites genesis-decay, arrogance-justice. The existence itself carries a guilt.\n\nJustice has to destroy everything which is born. There is no external limit that can restrict the activities of men, except the destruction. Arrogance is an expression of the chaotic element of human existence and in a way a part of the rebounding mechanism of order, because pushing it to exertions causes destruction which is also a reestablishment.\n\nWe may assume that the contradiction in the different interpretations is because Anaximander combined two different ways of thought. The first one dealing with \"apeiron\" is metaphysical (and can lead to monism), while the second one dealing with mutual changes and the balance of the opposites as central to reality is physical. The same paradox existed in the Greek way of thought. The Greeks believed that each individual had unlimitable potentialities both in brain and in heart, an outlook which called a man to live at the top of his powers. But that there was a limit to his most violent ambitions, that arrogance-injustice (\"hubris\" or \"adikia\") could disturb the harmony and balance. In that case justice (\"dike\") would destroy him to reestablish the order. These ideas are obvious in later Greek philosophers. Philolaus (5th century BC) mentions that nature constituted and is organized with the world from unlimitable ( \"apeira\", plural of \"apeiron\") and limitable. Everything which exists in the world contains the unlimited (\"apeiron\") and the limited. Something similar is mentioned by Plato: Nothing can exist if it doesn't contain continually and simultaneously the limited and the unlimited, the definite and the indefinite.\n\nSome doctrines existing in Western thought, still transmit some of the original ideas: \"God ordained that all men shall die\", \"Death is a common debt\". The Greek word \"adikia\" (injustice) transmits the notion that someone has operated outside of his own sphere, without respecting the one of his neighbour. Therefore, he commits hubris. The relative English word \"arrogance\" (claim as one's own without justification; ), is very close to the original meaning of the aphorism: \"Nothing in excess.\"\n\nOther pre-Socratic philosophers had different theories of the \"apeiron\". For the Pythagoreans (in particular, Philolaus), the universe had begun as an \"apeiron\", but at some point it inhaled the void from outside, filling the cosmos with vacuous bubbles that split the world into many different parts. For Anaxagoras, the initial \"apeiron\" had begun to rotate rapidly under the control of a godlike \"Nous\" (Mind), and the great speed of the rotation caused the universe to break up into many fragments. However, since all individual things had originated from the same \"apeiron\", all things must contain parts of all other things—for instance, a tree must also contain tiny pieces of sharks, moons, and grains of sand. This alone explains how one object can be transformed into another, since each thing already contains all other things in germ.\n\n\n"}

The group claims ideological continuity with the original Black Panther Party for Self-Defense and, according to its official website, organizes gang members to \"stop commiting genocide against each other and to stand up against white supremacy and capitalist oppression.\"\n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center classifies the Black Riders as a black separatist hate group and notes that its members hold black supremacist views.\n\nThe Black Riders Liberation Party traces its origins back to a class conducted at the Youth Training School in Chino, California, conducted by the California Youth Authority for prisoners in the California state penal system. Among these was Mischa Culton, an individual also using the noms de guerre \"General T.A.C.O.,\" an acronym for Taking All Capitalists Out, and \"Wolverine Shakur.\" Inspired by the historic example of the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense, upon his release from prison in 1996 Culton sought to build a new political organization by gathering others from the predominately African-American ghettos of South Central Los Angeles and Watts.\n\nThe fledgling organization started by Culton was energized by a November 17, 1997 police shooting of a mentally troubled black man in the Jordan Downs housing complex in Watts, a suicidal individual who had lunged at officers with a butter knife. The result was a vigilance program given the provocative moniker \"Watch a Pig,\" which encouraged citizens \"standing a legal distance from the pigs and making sure they don't brutalize the people,\" in the words of the group's \"Minister of Public Relations.\"\n\nOriginally limited to Southern California, in 2010 a section of the organization based in Oakland, California was initiated.\n\nIn November 2012 the BRLP launched a mass organization called the Inter-Communal Solidarity Committee in Los Angeles, attempting to build broader support for a common program. The new front group was inspired by the National Committee to Combat Fascism (NCCF) of the Black Panther Party, according to a representative of the organization.\n\nIn March 2015 the BRLP decided to take advantage of the open gun carrying law in Texas, traveling to Austin to conduct an armed march to the Texas state capitol together with the Huey P. Newton Gun Club. Held in conjunction with the heavily attended South by Southwest conference, the joint march was conducted in an effort to \"raise the cry for armed self-defense\" by the black community, according to the marchers.\n\nThe group styles itself as an organization of \"black revolutionaries\" engaged in a \"people's war\" against a white-dominated \"oppressive capitalistic system.\" The group advocates on behalf of civil rights and social justice and actively seeks to end gang violence so as to \"change gang mentality into revolutionary mentality.\"\n\nThe BRLP professes a belief in the ideas of revolutionary socialism, and on May Day 2012 were part of a small and ineffectual \"General Strike\" effort in Los Angeles. The group claimed that their May 1 participation was met with retaliation by government authorities, who are said to have burst into the home of party leader Mischa Culton two days later with automatic rifles during what was later explained as a routine \"compliance check\" by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.\n\nThe Black Riders have adopted a party manifesto known as the Black Commune program which put forward many of the demands of the original 1966 Ten-Point Program, with the addition of new demands (for the proper medical care of AIDS sufferers and an end to the trade in crack cocaine in the black community).\n\nThe group's founder and chief theoretician, Mischa Culton, has called Barack Obama, the first African-American President of the United States, the \"ultimate neocolonial puppet\" and \"the grand house negro\" and declared that the American government and political system was \"designed to enslave, massacre, and genocide our people out of this country.\"\n\nCulton advocates for an autonomous, black-directed movement, encouraging sympathetic whites to fight against police abuse and the ideology of white supremacy. In a 2015 interview with \"Vice\" magazine, he declared:\n\"It's important that black people are allowed to define themselves and their struggle, for outsiders not to come in and co-opt or water down our righteous revolutionary rage. The main way is to ride on the pigs, to go against the pigs. You've gotta study the history of John Brown, 'cause if you're not John Brown, you might as well get out of town.\"\n\nIn addition to its \"Watch a Pig\" police monitoring campaign, the BRLP conducts ideological training under the slogan \"Educate 2 Liberate\" and maintains what it calls the \"Break the Lock Prisoner Support\" program.\n\nThe BRLP launched its own newspaper in 2012, the eponymous \"Black Riders Liberation Party.\"\n\nThe group was the subject of a 2013 documentary film, \"Let Um Hear Ya Coming.\"\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4254233", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4254233", "title": "Classical theism", "text": "Classical theism\n\nClassical theism is a form of theism in which God is characterized as the absolutely metaphysically ultimate being, in contrast to other conceptions such as pantheism, panentheism, polytheism and process theism.\n\nClassical theism is a form of monotheism. Whereas most monotheists agree that God is, at minimum, all-knowing, all-powerful, and completely good, classical theism asserts that God is both immanent (encompassing or manifested in the material world) and simultaneously transcendent (independent of the material universe); simple, and having such attributes as immutability, impassibility, and timelessness. A key concept in classical theism is that \"created beings\" (ie, material phenomena, whether sentient biological organisms or insentient matter) are dependent for their existence on the one supreme divine Being. Also, although God is wholly transcendent, he not only creates the material universe but also acts upon the material universe in imposing (or organizing) a Higher Order upon that material reality. This order was called by the ancient Greeks \"logos\".\n\nClassical theism is associated with the tradition of writers like Plato, Aristotle, Plotinus, Augustine, St. Anselm, Maimonides, Averroes and Thomas Aquinas. In opposition to this tradition, there are, today, philosophers like Alvin Plantinga (who rejects divine simplicity), Richard Swinburne (who rejects divine timelessness) and William Lane Craig (who rejects both divine simplicity and timelessness), who can be viewed as theistic personalists. Philosophers like David Bentley Hart have defended classical theism itself in recent times.\n\nClassical theism was almost universal among Christian theologians prior to the twentieth century. However, some of its recent critics argue that it is taken from pre-Christian philosophers and incompatible with the occasions in the Bible that describe God as emotional or changing. In defence of classical theism's compatibility with the Bible, these passages can be read in an analogous or allegorical sense as containing poetic elements, just as many other passages have also long been read. For example, Exodus 31:18 describes \"the finger of God\", and Genesis 3:8 describes God as noisily walking in the garden of Eden. It is inconsistent that most Christian critics of classical theism would read these latter verses in an allegorical sense, but insist that instances which describe change or passion in God are extremely literal in meaning. Moreover, whereas critics of classical theism charge that it has infiltrated Christian theology from pre-Christian roots such as Neoplatonism, in fact the term \"classical theism\" belies crucial differences between a traditional Christian and Neoplatonic conception of God. For example, whereas Arius followed the neo-Platonist Plotinus in asserting that God could not become a physical man, Athanasius defended the doctrine of God's incarnation as the man Jesus, while nevertheless defending the immutability and impassibility of Jesus' divine nature. According to a traditional Christian understanding of the \"communicatio idiomatum\", it can be rightly said that God suffered and died on the cross, but only by virtue of the hypostatic union of the impassible divine word with Jesus' passible human soul and body. Hence, while the church fathers made sure to correct the classical theism of pagan sources where it was incompatible with Christianity, it can be argued that many of the modern Christian critics of classical theism are in fact themselves influenced by an overly uncritical adoption of trends within process theology, which itself has non-Christian philosophical roots in the thought of Charles Hartshorne.\n\n"}
{"id": "46399294", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46399294", "title": "Collectivist anarchism", "text": "Collectivist anarchism\n\nCollectivist anarchism (also known as anarcho-collectivism) is a revolutionary anarchist doctrine that advocates the abolition of both the state and private ownership of the means of production as it instead envisions the means of production being owned collectively and controlled and managed by the producers themselves.\n\nFor the collectivization of the means of production, it was originally envisaged that workers will revolt and forcibly collectivize the means of production. Once collectivization takes place, money would be abolished to be replaced with labour notes and workers' salaries would be determined in democratic organizations of voluntary membership based on job difficulty and the amount of time they contributed to production. These salaries would be used to purchase goods in a communal market. This contrasts with anarcho-communism where wages would be abolished and where individuals would take freely from a storehouse of goods \"to each according to his need\". Thus notwithstanding the title, Mikhail Bakunin's \"collectivist anarchism\" is seen as a blend of individualism and collectivism.\n\nCollectivist anarchism is most commonly associated with Bakunin, the anti-authoritarian sections of the First International and the early Spanish anarchist movement.\n\nGiuseppe Fanelli met Bakunin at Ischia in 1866. In October 1868, Bakunin sponsored Fanelli to travel to Barcelona to share his libertarian visions and recruit revolutionists to the International Workingmen's Association. Fanelli's trip and the meeting he organised during his travels provided the catalyst for the Spanish exiles, the largest workers' and peasants' movement in modern Spain and the largest Anarchist movement in modern Europe. Fanelli's tour took him first to Barcelona, where he met and stayed with Elie Recluse. Recluse and Fanelli were at odds over Recluse's friendships with Spanish republicans and Fanelli soon left Barcelona for Madrid. Fanelli stayed in Madrid until the end of January 1869, conducting meetings to introduce Spanish workers, including Anselmo Lorenzo, to the First National. In February 1869, Fanelli left Madrid, journeying home via Barcelona. While in Barcelona again, he met with painter Josep Lluís Pellicer and his cousin Rafael Farga Pellicer along with others who were to play an important role establishing the International in Barcelona as well as the Alliance section.\n\nIn 1870, Bakunin led a failed uprising in Lyon on the principles later exemplified by the Paris Commune, calling for a general uprising in response to the collapse of the French government during the Franco-Prussian War, seeking to transform an imperialist conflict into social revolution. In his \"Letters to A Frenchman on the Present Crisis\", he argued for a revolutionary alliance between the working class and the peasantry, advocated a system of militias with elected officers as part of a system of self-governing communes and workplaces and argued the time was ripe for revolutionary action: \n\nThese ideas and corresponded strikingly closely with the program of the Paris Commune of 1871, much of which was developed by followers of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon as Marxists were almost entirely absent from the Commune. Bakunin was a strong supporter of the Commune, which was brutally suppressed by the French government. He saw the Commune as above all a \"rebellion against the State\" and commended the Communards for rejecting not only the state, but also revolutionary dictatorship. In a series of powerful pamphlets, he defended the Commune and the First International against the Italian nationalist Giuseppe Mazzini, thereby winning over many Italian republicans to the International and the cause of revolutionary socialism. The collectivist anarchists at first used the term \"collectivism\" to distinguish themselves from the mutualism of the followers of Proudhon and the state socialists associated with Karl Marx. Bakunin wrote that \"we shall always protest against anything that may in any way resemble communism or state socialism\", which Bakunin regarded as fundamentally authoritarian (\"Federalism, Socialism, and Anti-Theologism\", 1867).\n\nBakunin's disagreements with Marx, which led to the attempt by the Marx party to expel him at the Hague Congress (see below), illustrated the growing divergence between the anti-authoritarian sections of the International, which advocated the direct revolutionary action and organization of the workers and peasants in order to abolish the state and capitalism; and the sections allied with Marx, which advocated the conquest of political power by the working class. Bakunin was \"Marx’s flamboyant chief opponent\" and \"presciently warned against the emergence of a communist authoritarianism that would take power over working people\".\n\nThe anti-authoritarian majority, which included most sections of the International, created their own First International at the St. Imier Congress, adopted a revolutionary anarchist program and repudiated the Hague resolutions, rescinding Bakunin's alleged expulsion. Although Bakunin accepted elements of Marx’s class analysis and theories regarding capitalism, acknowledging \"Marx’s genius\", he thought Marx's analysis was one-sided and that Marx's methods would compromise the social revolution. More importantly, Bakunin criticized \"authoritarian socialism\" (which he associated with Marxism) and the concept of dictatorship of the proletariat which he adamantly refused.\n\nThe anti-authoritarian sections of the First International proclaimed at the St. Imier Congress (1872) that \"the aspirations of the proletariat can have no purpose other than the establishment of an absolutely free economic organization and federation, founded upon the labour and equality of all and absolutely independent of all political government\", in which each worker will have the \"right to the enjoyment of the gross product of his labours and thereby the means of developing his full intellectual, material and moral powers in a collective setting\". This revolutionary transformation could \"only be the outcome of the spontaneous action of the proletariat itself, its trades bodies and the autonomous communes\". A similar position was adopted by the Workers' Federation of the Spanish Region in 1882 as articulated by an anarchist veteran of the First International, Jose Llunas Pujols, in his essay \"Collectivism\".\n\nBy the early 1880s, most of the European anarchist movement had adopted an anarchist communist position, advocating the abolition of wage labour and distribution according to need. Ironically, the \"collectivist\" label then became more commonly associated with Marxist state socialists who advocated the retention of some sort of wage system during the transition to full communism. The anarchist communist Peter Kropotkin attacked this position in his essay \"The Collectivist Wages System\", which was reprinted in his book \"The Conquest of Bread\" in 1892.\n\nBakunin's socialism was known as \"collectivist anarchism\", where \"socially: it seeks the confirmation of political equality by economic equality. This is not the removal of natural individual differences, but equality in the social rights of every individual from birth; in particular, equal means of subsistence, support, education and opportunity for every child, boy or girl, until maturity and equal resources, and facilities in adulthood to create his own well-being by his own labor\".\n\nCollectivist anarchism advocates the abolition of both the state and private ownership of the means of production. It instead envisions the means of production being owned collectively and controlled and managed by the producers themselves. For the collectivization of the means of production, it was originally envisaged that workers will revolt and forcibly collectivize the means of production. Once collectivization takes place, money would be abolished to be replaced with labour notes and workers' salaries would be determined in democratic organizations based on job difficulty and the amount of time they contributed to production. These salaries would be used to purchase goods in a communal market.\n\nThe dispute between Mikhail Bakunin and Karl Marx highlighted the differences between anarchism and Marxism. Bakunin argued—against certain ideas of a number of Marxists—that not all revolutions need to be violent. He also strongly rejected Marx's concept of the \"dictatorship of the proletariat\", a concept that vanguardist socialism including Marxist–Leninism would use to justify one-party rule from above by a party representing the proletariat. Bakunin insisted that revolutions must be led by the people directly while any \"enlightened elite\" must only exert influence by remaining \"invisible...not imposed on anyone...[and] deprived of all official rights and significance\". He held that the state should be immediately abolished because all forms of government eventually lead to oppression. Libertarian Marxists argue Marx used the phrase to mean the worker control at the point of production, not a party, would still be a state until society is reorganized according to socialist principles.\nWhile both social anarchists and Marxists share the same final goal, the creation of a free, egalitarian society without social classes and government, they strongly disagree on how to achieve this goal. Anarchists believe that the classless, stateless society should be established by the direct action of the masses, culminating in social revolution; and refuse any intermediate stage such as the dictatorship of the proletariat on the basis that such a dictatorship will become a self-perpetuating fundament. For Bakunin, the fundamental contradiction is that for the Marxists \"anarchism or freedom is the aim, while the state and dictatorship is the means, and so, in order to free the masses, they have first to be enslaved\".\n\nHowever, Bakunin also wrote of meeting Marx in 1844: \n\nBakunin found Marx's economic analysis very useful and began the job of translating \"Das Kapital\" into Russian. In turn, Marx wrote of the rebels in the Dresden insurrection of 1848 that \"[i]n the Russian refugee Michael Bakunin they found a capable and cool headed leader\". Marx wrote to Friedrich Engels of meeting Bakunin in 1864 after his escape to Siberia, saying: \"On the whole he is one of the few people whom I find not to have retrogressed after 16 years, but to have developed further\".\n\nBakunin has sometimes been called the first theorist of the \"new class\", meaning that a class of intellectuals and bureaucrats running the state in the name of the people or the proletariat—but in reality in their own interests alone. Bakunin argued that the \"[s]tate has always been the patrimony of some privileged class: a priestly class, an aristocratic class, a bourgeois class. And finally, when all the other classes have exhausted themselves, the State then becomes the patrimony of the bureaucratic class and then falls—or, if you will, rises—to the position of a machine\".\n\nBakunin also had a different view as compared to Marx's on the revolutionary potential of the lumpenproletariat and the proletariat. As such, \"[b]oth agreed that the proletariat would play a key role, but for Marx the proletariat was the exclusive, leading revolutionary agent while Bakunin entertained the possibility that the peasants and even the lumpenproletariat (the unemployed, common criminals, etc.) could rise to the occasion\". Bakunin \"considers workers' integration in capital as destructive of more primary revolutionary forces. For Bakunin, the revolutionary archetype is found in a peasant milieu (which is presented as having longstanding insurrectionary traditions, as well as a communist archetype in its current social form—the peasant commune) and amongst educated unemployed youth, assorted marginals from all classes, brigands, robbers, the impoverished masses, and those on the margins of society who have escaped, been excluded from, or not yet subsumed in the discipline of emerging industrial work...in short, all those whom Marx sought to include in the category of the lumpenproletariat\".\n\nThe difference between collectivist anarchism and anarcho-communism is that under the former a wage system is retained based on the amount of labor performed. Anarchist communism, like collectivist anarchism, also advocates for the socialization of production, but the distribution of goods as well. Instead of \"to each according to his labor\", in anarcho-communism the community would supply the subsistence requirements to each member free of charge according to the maxim \"to each according to his needs\".\n\nCollectivist anarchism stresses collective ownership of productive, subsistence and distributary property while communist anarchism negates the concept of ownership in favor of usage or possession with productive means being a possession not owned by any individual or particular group. Anarcho-communists believe that subsistence, productive and distributive property should be common or social possessions while personal property should be private possessions. Collectivist anarchists agree with this, but disagree on the subject of remuneration as some collectivist anarchists, such as Mikhail Bakunin, believe in the remuneration of labor while anarcho-communists, such as Peter Kropotkin, believe that such remuneration would lead to the recreation of currency and that this would need a state. It could thus be said that collectivist anarchists believe in freedom through collective ownership of production and a communal market of sorts to distribute goods and services and compensate workers in the form of remuneration. Collectivist anarchism could thus be seen as a combination of communism and mutualism.\n\nCollectivist anarchists are not necessarily opposed to the use of currency, but some while opposing the retaining of money—propose the adoption of labour vouchers or \"personal credit\" (such as participatory economists). Most collectivist anarchists see their philosophy as a carryover to anarcho-communist, but some see the system and the use of a labour voucher system as permanent rather than a transition. Collectivist anarchist James Guillaume argued that such a society would \"guarantee the mutual use of the tools of production which are the property of each of these groups and which will by a reciprocal contract become the collective property of the whole [...] federation. In this way, the federation of groups will be able to [...] regulate the rate of production to meet the fluctuating needs of society\". They argue for workplace autonomy and self-management \"the workers in the various factories have not the slightest intention of handing over their hard-won control of the tools of production to a superior power calling itself the 'corporation'\".\n\n\"An Anarchist FAQ\" compares and contrasts collectivist anarchism with anarcho-communism this way: \n\nApplication of many collectivist anarchists projects have been successful as sources during the Spanish Revolution noted in the Catalan region: \n\nTom Wetzel describes another collectivization: \n\n\n"}

Perdue describes Myatt as \"[a] British iconoclast who has lived a somewhat itinerant life and has undertaken an equally desultory intellectual quest” and is \"emblematic of the modern syncretism of radical ideologies\". He is regarded as an \"example of the axis between right-wing extremists and Islamists\", and has been described as an \"extremely violent, intelligent, dark, and complex individual\", as a martial arts expert, and as one of the more interesting figures on the British neo-Nazi scene since the 1970s.\n\nBefore his conversion to Islam in 1998, Myatt was the first leader of the British National Socialist Movement (NSM), and was identified by the British newspaper \"The Observer\", as the \"ideological heavyweight\" behind Combat 18.\n\nMyatt came to public attention in 1999, a year after his Islamic conversion, when a pamphlet he wrote many years earlier, \"A Practical Guide to Aryan Revolution\", described as a \"detailed step-by-step guide for terrorist insurrection\", was said to have inspired David Copeland, who left nailbombs in areas frequented by London's black, South Asian, and gay communities. Three people died and 129 were injured in the explosions, several of them losing limbs. It has also been suggested that Myatt's \"A Practical Guide to Aryan Revolution\" might have influenced the German National Socialist Underground.\n\nSince 2010, Myatt has written extensively about his rejection of his extremist past and about his rejection of extremism in general.\n\nMyatt has translated works of ancient Greek literature, translated and written a commentary on the Greek text of eight tractates of the Corpus Hermeticum, and written several collections of poems. He is currently translating and writing a commentary on the Greek text of the Gospel of John.\n\nDavid Wulstan Myatt grew up in Tanganyika, where his father worked as a civil servant for the British government, and later in the Far East, where he studied martial arts. He moved to England in 1967 to complete his schooling, and has said that he began a degree in physics but did not complete it, leaving his studies to focus on his political activism. He is reported to live in the Midlands and to have been married three times.\n\nAccording to Jeffrey Kaplan, Myatt has undertaken \"a global odyssey which took him on extended stays in the Middle East and East Asia, accompanied by studies of religions ranging from Christianity to Islam in the Western tradition and Taoism and Buddhism in the Eastern path. In the course of this Siddhartha-like search for truth, Myatt sampled the life of the monastery in both its Christian and Buddhist forms.\"\n\nPolitical scientist George Michael writes that Myatt has \"arguably done more than any other theorist to develop a synthesis of the extreme right and Islam,\" and is \"arguably England’s principal proponent of contemporary neo-Nazi ideology and theoretician of revolution.\"\n\nHe described Myatt as an \"intriguing theorist\" whose \"Faustian quests\" not only involved studying Taoism and spending time in a Buddhist and later a Christian monastery, but also allegedly involved exploring the occult, and Paganism and what Michael calls \"quasi-Satanic\" secret societies, while remaining a committed National Socialist.\n\nMyatt is also alleged to have been the founder of the occult group the Order of Nine Angles (ONA/O9A) or to have taken it over, written the publicly available teachings of the ONA under the pseudonym Anton Long, with his role being \"paramount to the whole creation and existence of the ONA\". According to Senholt, \"ONA-inspired activities, led by protagonist David Myatt, managed to enter the scene of grand politics and the global 'War On Terror', because of several foiled terror plots in Europe that can be linked to Myatt's writings\". David Myatt has always denied such allegations about involvement with the ONA, and using the pseudonym Anton Long, and has repeatedly challenged his accusers to provide evidence of such allegations, which so far they have failed to do. George Sieg expressed doubts regarding Myatt being Long, writing that he considered it to be \"implausible and untenable based on the extent of variance in writing style, personality, and tone\" between Myatt and Long's writings. Jeffrey Kaplan also suggested that Myatt and Long are separate people, as did the religious studies scholar Connell R. Monette who wrote that it was quite possible that 'Anton Long' was a pseudonym used by multiple individuals over the last 30 years.\n\nIn 2000, British anti-fascist magazine \"Searchlight\" wrote that: \"[Myatt] does not have the appearance of a Nazi ideologue ... [S]porting a long ginger beard, Barbour jacket, cords and a tweed flat cap, he resembles an eccentric country gentleman out for a Sunday ramble. But Myatt is anything but the country squire, for beneath this seemingly innocuous exterior is a man of extreme and calculated hatred. Over the past ten years, Myatt has emerged as the most ideologically driven nazi in Britain, preaching race war and terrorism [...] Myatt is believed to have been behind a 15-page document which called for race war, under the imprint White Wolves.\"\n\nAt a 2003 UNESCO conference in Paris, which concerned the growth of anti-Semitism, it was stated that \"David Myatt, the leading hardline Nazi intellectual in Britain since the 1960s [...] has converted to Islam, praises bin Laden and al Qaeda, calls the 9/11 attacks 'acts of heroism,' and urges the killing of Jews. Myatt, under the name Abdul Aziz Ibn Myatt supports suicide missions and urges young Muslims to take up Jihad. Observers warn that Myatt is a dangerous man...\" This view of Myatt as a radical Muslim, or Jihadi, is supported by Professor Robert S. Wistrich, who writes that Myatt, when a Muslim, was a staunch advocate of \"Jihad, suicide missions and killing Jews...\" and also \"an ardent defender of bin Laden\". One of Myatt's writings justifying suicide attacks was, for several years, on the \"Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades\" (the military wing) section of the Hamas website.\n\nSince 2010, Myatt has written extensively about his rejection of both Islam and his extremist past, writing that: \"What I [...] came to understand, via pathei-mathos, was the importance - the human necessity, the virtue - of love, and how love expresses or can express the numinous in the most sublime, the most human, way. Of how extremism (of whatever political or religious or ideological kind) places some abstraction, some ideation, some notion of duty to some ideation, before a personal love, before a knowing and an appreciation of the numinous.\"\n\nIn addition to writing about Islam and National Socialism, Myatt has translated works by Sophocles, Sappho, Aeschylus, Homer, translated and written a commentary on the Greek texts of the Poimandres, Ιερός Λόγος, κρατῆρ ἡ μονάς, and five other sections of the \"Corpus Hermeticum\", and written several collections of poems. He has also developed a mystical philosophy which he calls both \"The Numinous Way\" and the \"Way of Pathei-Mathos\", and invented a three-dimensional board-game, the Star Game. He is currently translating and writing a commentary on the Greek text of the Gospel of John and has so far made publicly available Chapters 1 to 4.\n\nMyatt joined Colin Jordan's British Movement, a neo-Nazi group, in 1968, where he sometimes acted as Jordan's bodyguard at meetings and rallies. Myatt would later become Leeds Branch Secretary and a member of British Movement's National Council. From the 1970s until the 1990s, he remained involved with paramilitary and neo-Nazi organisations such as Column 88 and Combat 18, and was imprisoned twice for violent offences in connection with his political activism.\n\nMyatt was the founder and first leader of the National Socialist Movement of which David Copeland was a member. He also co-founded, with Eddy Morrison, the neo-Nazi organization the NDFM (National Democratic Freedom Movement) which was active in Leeds, England, in the early 1970s, and the neo-Nazi Reichsfolk group, and which Reichsfolk organization \"aimed to create a new Aryan elite, The Legion of Adolf Hitler, and so prepare the way for a golden age in place of 'the disgusting, decadent present with its dishonourable values and dis-honourable weak individuals'\".\n\nOf the NDFM, John Tyndall wrote (in a polemic against NDFM co-founder Eddy Morrison): \"The National Democratic Freedom Movement made little attempt to engage in serious politics but concentrated its activities mainly upon acts of violence against its opponents. [...] Before very long the NDFM had degenerated into nothing more than a criminal gang.\" Myatt, writing in his autobiography \"Myngath\", admits that during this time he did organize a small gang \"whose aim was to liberate goods, fence them, and make some money with the initial intent of aiding our political struggle.\" Myatt was subsequently arrested in a raid by the Yorkshire Regional Crime Squad, and imprisoned for leading this gang.\n\nIt is also alleged that in the early 1980s Myatt tried to establish a Nazi-occultist commune in Shropshire, although Myatt denies this allegation, claiming that his aim was to establish an agrarian community solely based on the Nazi principles of Blood and Soil and which project was advertised in Colin Jordan's \"Gothic Ripples\" newsletter, with Goodrick-Clark writing that \"after marrying and settling in Church Stretton in Shropshire, [Myatt] attempted in 1983 to set up a rural commune within the framework of Colin Jordan's Vanguard Project for neo-nazi utopias publicized in \"Gothic Ripples\"\".\n\nMichael writes that Myatt took over the leadership of Combat 18 in 1998, when Charlie Sargent, the previous leader, was jailed for murder.\n\nIn November 1997, Myatt allegedly posted a racist and anti-Semitic pamphlet he had written called \"Practical Guide to Aryan Revolution\" on a website run out of British Columbia, Canada by Bernard Klatt. The pamphlet included chapter titles such as \"Assassination\", \"Terror Bombing\", and \"Racial War\". According to Michael Whine of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, \"[t]he contents provided a detailed step-by-step guide for terrorist insurrection with advice on assassination targets, rationale for bombing and sabotage campaigns, and rules of engagement.\"\n\nIn February 1998, detectives from S012 Scotland Yard raided Myatt's home in Worcestershire and removed his computers and files. He was arrested on suspicion of incitement to murder and incitement to racial hatred, but the case later dropped, after a three-year investigation, because the evidence supplied by the Canadian authorities was not enough to secure a conviction.\n\nIt was a copy of the \"Practical Guide to Aryan Revolution\" pamphlet that, in 1999, was discovered by police in the flat of David Copeland, the London nailbomber – who was also a member of Myatt's National Socialist Movement – and thus which allegedly influenced him to plant homemade bombs targeting immigrants in Brixton, Brick Lane, and inside the Admiral Duncan pub on Old Compton Street in London, frequented by the black, Asian, and gay communities respectively. Friends John Light, Nick Moore, and Andrea Dykes and her unborn child died in the Admiral Duncan pub. Copeland told police he had been trying to spark a \"racial war.\"\n\nFollowing the conviction of Copeland for murder on June 30, 2000, after a trial at the Old Bailey, one newspaper wrote of Myatt: \"This is the man who shaped mind of a bomber; Cycling the lanes around Malvern, the mentor who drove David Copeland to kill [...] Riding a bicycle around his Worcestershire home town sporting a wizard-like beard and quirky dress-sense, the former monk could easily pass as a country eccentric or off-beat intellectual. But behind David Myatt's studious exterior lies a more sinister character that has been at the forefront of extreme right-wing ideology in Britain since the mid-1960s.\"\n\nAccording to the \"BBC's\" \"Panorama\", in 1998 when Myatt was leader of the NSM, he called for \"the creation of racial terror with bombs\". Myatt is also quoted by \"Searchlight\" as having stated that \"[t]he primary duty of all National Socialists is to change the world. National Socialism means revolution: the overthrow of the existing System and its replacement with a National-Socialist society. Revolution means struggle: it means war. It means certain tactics have to be employed, and a great revolutionary movement organised which is primarily composed of those prepared to fight, prepared to get their hands dirty and perhaps spill some blood\".\n\nMyatt converted to Islam in 1998. He told Professor George Michael that his decision to convert began when he took a job on a farm in England. He was working long hours in the fields and felt an affinity with nature, concluding that the sense of harmony he felt had not come about by chance. He told Michael that he was also impressed by the militancy of Islamist groups, and believed that he shared common enemies with Islam, namely \"the capitalist-consumer West and international finance.\"\n\nWhile, initially, some critics – specifically the anti-fascist \"Searchlight\" organization – suggested that Myatt's conversion \"may be just a political ploy to advance his own failing anti-establishment agenda\", it is now generally accepted that his conversion was genuine.\n\nFollowing his conversion to Islam, Myatt dissociated himself from nationalism and racialism, openly stating that racism is wrong.\n\nAs a Muslim, he traveled and spoke in several Arab countries, and wrote one of the most detailed defenses in the English language of Islamic suicide attacks – having become an advocate of such attacks and defended the killing of civilians in such attacks. He also expressed support for Osama bin Laden, and the Taliban, and referred to the Holocaust as a \"hoax\". An April 2005 NATO workshop heard that Myatt had called on \"all enemies of the Zionists to embrace the Jihad\" against Jews and the United States.\n\nAccording to an article in \"The Times\" published on 24 April 2006, Myatt then believed that: \"The pure authentic Islam of the revival, which recognises practical jihad as a duty, is the only force that is capable of fighting and destroying the dishonour, the arrogance, the materialism of the West ... For the West, nothing is sacred, except perhaps Zionists, Zionism, the hoax of the so-called Holocaust, and the idols which the West and its lackeys worship, or pretend to worship, such as democracy... Jihad is our duty. If nationalists, or some of them, desire to aid us, to help us, they can do the right thing, the honourable thing, and convert, revert, to Islam — accepting the superiority of Islam over and above each and every way of the West.\"\n\nIn 2010, Myatt publicly announced that he had rejected Islam, having developed his own \"Weltanschauung\", writing that \"the Way of Pathei-Mathos is an ethical, an interior, a personal, a non-political, a non-interfering, a non-religious but spiritual, way of individual reflexion, individual change, and empathic living, where there is an awareness of the importance of virtues such as compassion, humility, tolerance, gentleness, and love\", and that \"living according to the way of pathei-mathos [...] means being compassionate or inclining toward compassion by trying to avoid causing, or contributing, to suffering\".\n\nMyatt describes \"the Numinous Way\" as \"the result of a four-decade long \"pathei-mathos\" and [...] the often difficult process of acknowledging my many personal mistakes\", and writes that it is an apolitical, and individual, way of life, based on empathy and \"πάθει μάθος, \"pathei-mathos, where race and the concept of the folk not only have no place but are regarded as unethical abstractions.\n\nHe defines \"pathei-mathos\" by saying: \"The Greek term πάθει μάθος derives from the \"Agamemnon\" of Aeschylus (written c. 458 BCE), and can be interpreted, or translated, as meaning learning from adversary, or wisdom arises from (personal) suffering; or personal experience is the genesis of true learning.\" Pathei-Mathos is thus an aspect of or element in \"the Numinous Way\", although the former term comes to predominate over the latter in Myatt's writings beginning 2012.\n\nMyatt writes that \"the numinous sympathy – συμπάθεια (sympatheia, benignity) – with another living being that empathy provides naturally inclines us to treat other living beings as we ourselves would wish to be treated: with fairness, compassion, honour, and dignity. It also inclines us not to judge those whom we do not know; those beyond the purveu – beyond the range of – our faculty of empathy\".\n\nMyatt links his \"Numinous Way\" to Hellenistic philosophy and places it in the Western philosophical tradition.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "38179127", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38179127", "title": "Democratized transactional giving", "text": "Democratized transactional giving\n\nDemocratized transactional giving is a form of corporate philanthropy and the latest evolution in cause marketing, (defined as when for-profit companies join forces with nonprofits to promote a cause) where consumers, and not the brand in question, have maximum control over the causes they choose to support. Augmenting traditional corporate philanthropy and participatory cause marketing, democratized transactional giving empowers consumers to become better brand and cause advocates while promoting a strong behavioral influence that seeks to yield greater loyalty and brand commitment.\n\nSuccessful democratized transactional giving is the outgrowth or result of a fully realized cause-related loyalty marketing campaign which not only links nonprofits and for-profits together, but does so in the context of an existing company’s loyalty program. The result is that consumers can convert any unused rewards issued by the company in the form of points, miles or other units to causes and nonprofits of their own choosing.\n\nAccording to KULA Causes, Inc., of Boulder, Colorado, which in 2010 designed and launched the Cause-Related Loyalty Marketing (CLM) software solution for companies looking to improve their loyalty and philanthropic efforts, corporate philanthropy/cause marketing has evolved in three phases.\n\nPhase one was an autocratic approach where the brand selected the cause in question, the brand told the “cause story,” and the result was low customer behavioral influence. Phase two witnessed the growth of participatory cause marketing. Under this improvement, the brand still selects a number of causes (and tells the cause story) while customers choose causes from among that limited selection. The result is growing customer behavioral influence. In democratized transactional giving decisions and brand advocacy responsibility has been passed on to the consumer – a level of control that inspires a strong behavioral influence.\n\nWhen companies allow customers to donate unused rewards to causes of the customer’s choosing, the customer develops a greater appreciation for the company. Edelman PR found in its 2012 Goodpurpose Study that \"72% of consumers would recommend a brand that supports a good cause over one that doesn’t, a 39% increase since 2008.\" By facilitating democratized transactional giving, companies can see that benefit as deepened customer loyalty.\n\nHumans’ hard-wired capacity for empathy fuels the desire to help those in need, because people can imagine themselves in the same situation. Consumers who act on this impulse benefit from the positive feelings associated with spending money on a good cause.\n\nNonprofits as a whole benefit when consumers rather than companies dictate where donations, including donations of unredeemed loyalty-program rewards, will go. This is because increasing numbers of consumers participating in democratized transactional giving also mean a wider diversity of nonprofits being helped according to each individual consumer’s cause affinities – the types of causes they tend to support.\n\n"}
{"id": "8539", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8539", "title": "Devil", "text": "Devil\n\nA devil is the personification of evil as it is conceived in many and various cultures and religious traditions. It is seen as the objectification of a hostile and destructive force.\n\nIt is difficult to specify a particular definition of any complexity that will cover all of the traditions, beyond that it is a manifestation of evil. It is meaningful to consider the devil through the lens of each of the cultures and religions that have the devil as part of their mythos. \n\nThe history of this concept intertwines with theology, mythology, psychiatry, art and literature, maintaining a validity, and developing independently within each of the traditions. It occurs historically in many contexts and cultures, and is given many different names — Satan, Lucifer, Beelzebub, Mephistopheles — and attributes: It is portrayed as blue, black, or red; It is portrayed as having horns on its head, and without horns, and so on. The idea of the devil has been taken seriously often, but not always, for example when devil figures are used in advertising and on candy wrappers.\n\nThe Modern English word \"devil\" derives from the Middle English \"devel\", from Old English \"dēofol\", that in turn represents an early Germanic borrowing of Latin \"diabolus\". This in turn was borrowed from \"diábolos\", \"slanderer\", from \"diabállein\", \"to slander\" from διά \"diá\", \"across, through\" and βάλλειν \"bállein\", \"to hurl\", probably akin to the Sanskrit \"gurate\", \"he lifts up\".\n\nIn his book \"The Devil: Perceptions of Evil from Antiquity to Primitive Christianity\" Jeffrey Burton Russell discusses various meanings, and difficulties that are encountered when using the term \"Devil\". He doesn’t claim to define the word in a general sense, but he describes the limited use that he intends for the word in his book — limited in order to “minimize this difficulty” and “for the sake of clarity”. In this book Russel uses the word \"Devil\" as \"the personification of evil found in a variety of cultures\", as opposed the word \"Satan\", which he reserves specifically for the figure in the Abrahamic religions.\n\nIn the introduction to his book, \"Satan: A Biography\", Henry Ansgar Kelly discusses various considerations and meanings that he has encountered in using terms such as \"devil\" and \"Satan\", etc. While not offering a general definition, he describes that in his book \"whenever \"diabolos\" is used as the proper name of Satan\", he signals it by using \"small caps.\"\n\nThe \"Oxford English Dictionary\" has a variety of definitions for the meaning of \"devil\", supported by a range of citations: \"Devil\" may refer to Satan, the supreme spirit of evil, or one of the Satan's emissaries or demons that populate Hell, or to one of the spirits that possess a demonic person; \"devil\" may refer to one of the \"malignant deities\" feared and worshiped by \"heathen people\", a demon, a malignant being of superhuman powers; figuratively “devil\" may be applied to a wicked person, or playfully to a rogue or rascal, or in empathy often accompanied by the word “poor\" to a person — \"poor devil\".\n\nThe earliest Hindu texts do not offer further explanations for evil, regarding evil as something natural. However, later texts offer various explanations for evil. According to an explanation given by the Brahmins, both demons and gods spoke truth and untruth, but the demons relinquished the truth and the gods relinquished the untruth. But both spirits are regarded as different aspects of one supreme god. Even some fierce deities like Kali are not thought of as devils but just as darker aspects of God and may even manifest benevolence.\n\nApep () or Apophis (; ; also spelled Apepi or Aapep) was the ancient Egyptian deity who embodied chaos (\"ı͗zft\" in Egyptian) and was thus the opponent of light and Ma'at (order/truth). He appears in art as a giant serpent. His name is reconstructed by Egyptologists as *ʻAʼpāpī, as it was written \"ꜥꜣpp(y)\" and survived in later Coptic as \"Aphōph\".\n\nThe deity Set was originally associated with both positive and negative roles: a protector of Ra on the solar boat from the Serpent of Chaos, and a usurper who killed and mutilated his brother in order to assume the throne. However, he was later demonized and he became quite unpopular. According to Herman te Velde, the demonization of Set took place after Egypt's conquest by several foreign nations in the Third Intermediate and Late Periods. Set, who had traditionally been the god of foreigners, thus also became associated with foreign oppressors, including the Assyrian and Persian empires. It was during this time that Set was particularly vilified, and his defeat by Horus widely celebrated. Set's negative aspects were emphasized during this period. Set was the killer of Osiris, having hacked Osiris' body into pieces and dispersed it so that he could not be resurrected. The Greeks later linked Set with Typhon because both were evil forces, storm deities, and sons of the Earth that attacked the main gods.\n\nNevertheless, throughout this period, in some outlying regions of Egypt Set was still regarded as the heroic chief deity.\n\nSet has also been classed as a Trickster deity who, as a god of disorder, resorts to deception to achieve bad ends.\n\nZoroastrianism probably introduced the first idea of the conceptual \"devil\"; a principle of evil independently existing apart from God. In Zoroastrianism, good and evil derive from two ultimately opposed forces. The force of good is called Ahura Mazda and the \"destructive spirit\" in Avestan-language called Angra Mainyu. The Middle Persian equivalent is Ahriman. They are in eternal struggle and neither is all-powerful, especially Angra Mainyu is limited to space and time: in the end of time, he will be finally defeated. While Ahura Mazda creates what is good, Angra Mainyu is responsible for every evil and suffering in the world, such as toads and scorpions.\n\nBuddhism contains a devil-like figure called Mara (Sanskrit: \"māra\"; ; Tibetan Wylie: \"bdud\"; ; ; ; ), who is a tempter figure in Buddhism, distracting humans from practicing the spiritual life by making mundane things alluring, or the negative seem positive. He tempted Gautama Buddha by trying to seduce him with the vision of beautiful women who, in various legends, are often said to be Mara's daughters. In Buddhist cosmology, Mara personifies unwholesome impulses, unskillfulness, the \"death\" of the spiritual life.\n\nAmong the Tengristic myths, Erlik refers to a devil-like figure as the ruler of hell, who is also the first human. According to one narrative, Erlik and God swam together over the primordial waters. When God was about to create the earth, he send Erlik to dive into the waters and collect some mud. Erlik hid inside his mouth to later create his own world. But when God commanded earth to expand Erlik got troubled by the earth in his mouth. God aided Erlik to spit it out. The earth carried by Erlik gave place to the unpleasant areas of the world. Because of his sin, he was assigned to evil. In another cariant, the creator-god is identified with Ulgen. Again, Erlik appears to be the first human. He desired to create a human just as Ulgen did, thereupon Ulgen reacted by punishing Erlik, casting him into the underworld there he becomes its ruler.\n\nAccording to Tengrism, there is no death by meaning that life comes to an end, it is merely a transition into the invisible world. As the ruler of hell, Erlik enslaves the souls, who are damned to hell. Further he lurks on the souls of those humans living on earth, by causing death, disease and illnesses. At time of birth, Erlik sends a Kormos to seize the soul of the new-born, following him the rest of his life in an attempt to seize his soul by hampering, misguide and injure him. When Erlik succeeds in destroying the a humans body, the Kormos sent by Erlik will try take him down into the underworld. However a good soul will be brought to paradise, by a \"Yayutshi\" sent by Ulgen. Some shamans also made sacrifices to Erlik, for gaining a higher rank in the underworld, if they should be damned to hell.\n\nAccording to Yazidism there is no entity that represents evil in opposition to God; such dualism is rejected by Yazidis, and evil is regarded as non-existent. Yazidis adhere to strict monism and are prohibited from uttering the word \"devil\" and from speaking of anything related to hell.\n\nYahweh, the god in pre-exilic Judaism, created both good and evil, as stated in Isaiah 45:7: \"I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the Lord do all these things.\" The Devil did not exist in early Jewish scriptures. However, the influence of Zoroastrianism during the Achaemenid Empire introduced evil as a separate principle into the Jewish belief-system, which gradually externalized the opposition until the Hebrew term \"satan\" developed into a specific type of supernatural entity, changing the monistic view of Judaism into a dualistic one. Later Rabbinic Judaism rejected the Enochian books (written during the Second Temple period under Persian influence), which depicted the Devil as an independent force of evil besides God. After the apocalyptic period, references to Satan in the Tanakh are thought to be allegorical.\n\nIn Christianity, evil is incarnate in the Devil or Satan, a fallen angel who is the primary opponent of God.\n\nChristians considered the Roman and Greek deities devils. \n\nChristianity identifies the Devil with the serpent who tempted Adam and Eve to eat the forbidden fruit, and describes him as a fallen angel who terrorizes the world through evil, is the antithesis of Truth, and shall be condemned, together with the fallen angels who follow him, to eternal fire at the Last Judgement. In mainstream Christianity the devil is usually referred to as Satan. Some modern Christians consider the devil to be an angel who, along with one-third of the angelic host (the demons) rebelled against God and has consequently been condemned to the Lake of Fire. He is described as hating all humanity (or more accurately creation), opposing God, spreading lies and wreaking havoc on their souls.\n\nSatan is often identified as the serpent who convinced Eve to eat the forbidden fruit; thus, Satan has often been depicted as a serpent. Although this identification is not present in the Adam and Eve narrative, this interpretation goes back at least as far as the time of the writing of the Book of Revelation, which specifically identifies Satan as being the serpent (Rev. 20:2).\n\nIn the Bible, the devil is identified with \"the dragon\" and \"the old serpent\" in the Book of Revelation 12:9, 20:2 have also been identified with Satan, as has \"the prince of this world\" in the Gospel of John 12:31, 14:30; and \"the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience\" in the Epistle to the Ephesians 2:2; and \"the god of this world\" in 2 Corinthians 4:4. He is also identified as the dragon in the Book of Revelation (e.g.), and the tempter of the Gospels (e.g.).\n\nThe devil is sometimes called Lucifer, particularly when describing him as an angel before his fall, although the reference in Isaiah 14:12 to Lucifer, or the Son of the Morning, is a reference to a Babylonian king.\n\nBeelzebub is originally the name of a Philistine god (more specifically a certain type of Baal, from \"Ba‘al Zebûb\", lit. \"Lord of Flies\") but is also used in the New Testament as a synonym for Satan. A corrupted version, \"Belzeboub\", appears in The Divine Comedy (Inferno XXXIV).\n\nIn other, non-mainstream, Christian beliefs (e.g. the beliefs of the Christadelphians) the word \"satan\" in the Bible is not regarded as referring to a supernatural, personal being but to any 'adversary' and figuratively refers to human sin and temptation.\n\nIn the Book of Wisdom, the devil is represented as the one who brought death into the world. The Second Book of Enoch contains references to a Watcher angel called Satanael, describing him as the prince of the \"Grigori\" who was cast out of heaven and an evil spirit who knew the difference between what was \"righteous\" and \"sinful\".\n\nIn the Book of Jubilees, Satan rules over a host of angels. Mastema, who induced God to test Abraham through the sacrifice of Isaac, is identical with Satan in both name and nature. The Book of Enoch contains references to Sathariel, thought also to be Sataniel and Satan'el. The similar spellings mirror that of his angelic brethren Michael, Raphael, Uriel and Gabriel, previous to his expulsion from Heaven.\n\nGnostic and Gnostic influenced religions repeatedly addressed the idea, that the material world is inherently evil. The \"One true God\" is far remote, beyond the material universe, therefore this universe must be gouverned by an inferior imposter deity. This deity was identified by some sects, such as the Sethians or the Marcions, with the deity of the Old testament. Tertullian accuses Marcion of Sinope, that he John Arendzen (1909) in the Catholic Encyclopedia (1913) mentions that Eusebius accused Apelles, the 2nd-century AD Gnostic, of considering the Inspirer of Old-Testament prophecies to be not a god, but an evil angel. These writings commonly refer to the Creator of the material world as \"a demiurgus\". to distinguish him from the \"One true God\". Some texts, such as the \"Apocryphon of John\" and \"On the Origin of the World\" not only demonized the Creator God but also called him by the name of the devil in some Jewish writings, \"Samael\".\n\nAccording to Mandaean mythology, \"Ruha Qadishta\" fell apart from the \"world of light\" and gave birth to the \"Lord of Darkness\" (\"malka dhshuka\") named \"Ur\". According to one tradition, Ur is an androgyne lion-headed dragon with the wings of an eagle. Together they create several evil demons, liliths and vampires. Ruha Qadishta is described as a liar and sorcerer. Several Abrahamitic prophets are regarded as servants of these devils or their subordinates such as Adonai, including Moses. Jesus appears as another son of Ruha Qadishta and Ur, who distorted the Baptism-ritual thought by John the Baptist. Eventually Ruha will be rehabilitated and return to the world of light.\n\nIn the 12th century in Europe the Cathars, who were rooted in Gnosticism, dealt with the problem of evil, and developed ideas of dualism and demonology. The Cathars were seen as a serious potential challenge to the Catholic church of the time. The Cathars split into two camps. The first is \"absolute\" dualism, which held that evil was completely separate from the good God, and that God and the devil each had power. The second camp is \"mitigated\" dualism, which considers Lucifer to be a son of God, and a brother to Christ. To explain this they used the parable of the prodigal son, with Christ as the good soon, and Lucifer as the son that strayed into evilness. The Catholic church responded to dualism in 1215 AD in the Fourth Lateran Council, saying that God created everything from nothing, and the Devil was good when he was created, but he made himself bad by his own free will. In the \"Gospel of the secret supper\", Lucifer, just as in prior Gnostic systems, appears as a demiurge, who created the material world.\n\nIn Manichaeism, God and the Devil are two unrelated principles. God created \"good\" and inhabits the realm of light, while the devil (also called \"prince of darkness\") created evil and inhabits the kingdom of darkness. The existing came into existence, when the kingdom of darkness assaulted the kingdom of light and mingled with the spiritual world. At the end, the devil and his followers will be sealed forever and the kingdom of light and the kingdom of darkness will continue to co-exist eternally never commingle again.\n\nHegemonius (4th century) accuses the Persian prophet Mani, founder of the Manichaean sect in the 3rd century AD, identified Jehovah as \"the devil god which created the world\" and said that \"he who spoke with Moses, the Jews, and the priests … is the [Prince] of Darkness, … not the god of truth.\"\n\nIn Islam, the principle of evil is expressed by two terms referring to the same entity: \"Shaitan\" (meaning \"astray\", \"distant\" or \"devil\") and Iblis. Iblis is the proper name of the Devil representing the characteristics of evil. Iblis is mentioned in the Quranic narrative about the creation of humanity. When God created Adam, he ordered the angels to prostrate themselves before him. All did, but Iblis refused and claimed to be superior to Adam out of pride. Therefore, pride but also envy became a sign of \"unbelief\" in Islam. Thereafter Iblis was condemned to hell, but God granted him a request to lead humanity astray, knowing the righteous will resist Iblis' attempts to misguide them. In Islam, both good and evil are ultimately created by God. But since God's will is good, the evil in the world must be part of God's plan. Actually, God allowed the Devil to seduce humanity. Evil and suffering are regarded as a test or a chance to proof confidence in God. Some philosophers and mystics emphasized Iblis himself as a role model of confidence in God, because God ordered the angels to prostrate themselves, Iblis was forced to choose between God's command and God's will (not to praise someone else than God). He successfully passed the test, yet his disobedience caused his punishment and therefore suffering. However, he stays patient and is rewarded in the end.\n\nMuslims held that the pre-Islamic Jinn, tutelary deities, became subject under Islam to the judgment of God, and that those who did not submit to the law of God are demons.\n\nLike in Christianity, Iblis was once a pious creature of God, but later cast out of heaven, due to his pride. However, to maintain God's absolute sovereignty, Islam adopts the line taken by Irenaeus, instead of the later Christian consensus, that the Devil did not rebel against God, but against humanity. Further, although Iblis is generally regarded as a real bodily entity, he plays a less significant role as the personification of evil than in Christianity. Iblis is merely a tempter, notable for inciting humans into sin by \"whispering\" into humans minds (waswās), akin to the Jewish idea of the Devil as \"yetzer hara\".\n\nOn the other hand, \"Shaitan\" refers unilaterally to forces of evil, including the Devil Iblis, then he causes mischief. Shaitan is also linked to humans psychological nature, appearing in dreams, causing anger or interrupting the mental preparation for prayer. Furthermore, the term \"Shaitan\" also refers to beings, who follow the evil suggestions of Iblis. Furthermore, the principle of \"Shaitan\" is in many ways a symbol of spiritual impurity, representing humans own deficits, in contrast to a \"true Muslim\", who is free from anger, lust and other devilish desires.\n\nIn contrast to \"Occidental philosophy\", the Sufi idea of seeing \"Many as One\" and considering the creation in their essence as the Absolute, leads to the idea of the dissolution of any dualism between the ego substance and the \"external\" substinantial objects. The rebellion against God, mentioned in the Quran, takes place on the level of the psyche, that must be trained and disciplined for its union with the spirit that is pure. Since psyche drives the body, \"flesh\" is not the obstacle to human, but an unawarness that allowed the impulsive forces to cause rebellion against God on the level of the psyche. Yet, it is not a dualism between body, psyche and spirit, since the spirit embraces both psyche and corperal aspects of human. Since the world is hold as the mirror in which God's attributes are reflected, participation in worldly affairs is not necessarily seen as opposed to God. The Devil activates the selfish desires of the psyche, leading him astray from the Divine. Thus it is the \"I\" that is regarded as evil, and both Iblis as well as \"Pharao\" are present as symbols for uttering \"I\" in ones own behavior. Therefore it is recommanded, to use the term \"I\" as rare as possible. It is only God who has the right to say \"I\", since it is only God, who is self-subsistent. Uttering \"I\" is therefore a way to compare oneselves to God, regarded as \"shirk\".\n\nSalafi strands of Islam commonly emphasize a dualistic worldview between the believers and the unbelievers, with the Devil as the enemy of God's path. Even though the Devil will be finally defeated by God, he is a serious and dangerous opponent of humans. While in classical hadiths, the demons (\"Shayateen\") and the jinn are responsible for impurity and possibly endanger people, in Salafi thought, it is the Devil himself, who lurks on the believers, always striving to lead them astray from God. The Devil is regarded as an omnipresent entity, permanently inciting humans into sin, but can be \"pushed away\" by remembering the name God. The Devil is regarded as an external entity, threatening the everyday life of the believer, even in social aspects of life. Thus for example, it is the Devil, who is responsible for Western emancipation.\n\nIn the Bahá'í Faith, a malevolent, superhuman entity such as a \"devil\" or \"satan\" is not believed to exist. These terms do, however, appear in the Bahá'í writings, where they are used as metaphors for the lower nature of man. Human beings are seen to have free will, and are thus able to turn towards God and develop spiritual qualities or turn away from God and become immersed in their self-centered desires. Individuals who follow the temptations of the self and do not develop spiritual virtues are often described in the Bahá'í writings with the word \"satanic\". The Bahá'í writings also state that the devil is a metaphor for the \"insistent self\" or \"lower self\" which is a self-serving inclination within each individual. Those who follow their lower nature are also described as followers of \"the Evil One\".\n\nIn some traditions, divinities can become demons. The Teutonic gods demonized the Giants.\n\nIn some religions and traditions, these titles are separate demons; others identify these names as guises of the devil. Even when thought of as individual demons, some are often thought of being under the Devil's direct control. This identifies only those thought of as the devil; List of demons has a more general listing.\n\nThese are titles that almost always refer to devil-figures.\n\n\n"}

One example is Breyer State University an online unaccredited University that offers a Phd in Hypnotherapy PhD Program. The program at Breyer State University, is composed of, listening to audio tapes, online distance education, a required Dissertation, the practice of actually practicing hypnotizing subjects, interacting with other Hypnotherapy students and class professors. There are also existing hypnotherapy certification programs. Because the majority of hypnotherapy degrees are offered through programs that are unaccredited in nature, they do not have to meet any requirements established by national licensing standards.\n\nThe DCH was an unaccredited doctoral degree offered in the United States, which provided in-depth theory and training in applied clinical hypnotherapy. Individual programs offered by institutions in the US vary but generally combine distance learning with local practicum training. Because some hypnotherapy degrees are offered through programs that are unaccredited in nature, they do not have to meet any requirements established by national licensing standards. However, the American Institute of Hypnotherapy (AIH) was approved by the California Bureau for Private Postsecondary & Vocational Education but a former FBI consultant, John Bear, has said that there is much difference between having \"approval\" and \"accreditation\". The BPPVE do not accredit programs. According to the BPPVE database (as of 25 May 2010), the American Institute of Hypnotherapy is now located in Carmel, California, but indicate that they no longer offer degree training in clinical hypnotherapy.\n\nOriginally approved by the State of California to grant degrees in early 1980s, the American Institute of Hypnotherapy offered unaccredited bachelors and doctorate degrees in clinical hypnotherapy which served a way point as there were no accredited programs available in the specialization at the time. AIH sought to establish hypnotherapy as a separate field. The program could be completed by distance learning and directed independent study (DIS) but required attendance at seminars, practicals, workshops, studying a range of relevant texts and developing a 20-30 page academic paper on each course/text. These were graded by faculty for content and analysis of the topic. The program modeled a Psy.D program, offering the opportunity to study many diverse authors, researchers and applications in hypnosis including pain control.\n\nAccredited doctorate degrees in mental health, such as M.D., Ph.D., Psy.D., and Ed.D., are tightly controlled by state and federal laws. The D.C.H. degree is largely unregulated. There is a growing concern among these professionals that hypnotists are misleading consumers. Some have illegally attempted to offer psychotherapy under generic titles such as \"doctor\" or \"psychotherapist\", without proper training or background.\n\nThere are several professional membership organizations in the United States that require minimum standards in specialized hypnotherapy education to become members as well as certified as a hypnotherapist (C.Ht.). Most of these organizations certify vocational hypnotherapists, and do not require health care training or experience for certification. Four of these professional membership organizations in the U.S. are The National Guild of Hypnotists, the American Board of Clinical Hypnotherapy, The American Counsel of Hypnotist Examiners (A.C.H.E) and International Medical and Dental Hypnotherapy Association (IMDHA). These are educational membership organizations dedicated to standards and practice efforts in understanding and extending applications in hypnotherapy. In addition, the Hypnosis Society of Pennsylvania has a process of recognition of training programs in conjunction with the Hypnotist Union as a Service Employee Union credential in the USA. Other good organizations with high standards in the field of hypnosis and hypnotherapy include The National Association for Transpersonal Psychology, The International Association of Counselors and Therapists and the American Association of Hypnotic Anesthesiology. All above-mentioned organizations are excellent vocational certifying agencies with high standards for membership to their associations.\n\nHowever, the American Society of Clinical Hypnosis (ASCH) has long claimed to be the \"gold-standard\" of organizations which train and certify health care professionals in the art of hypnotherapy. Health care professionals (doctors, nurses, psychologists, etc.) with a master's degree or higher can receive certification through a rigorous application process and training.While A.S.C.H, has a high standard of training in clinical applications of hypnosis, it largely accommodates certification for professionals already in other field of the healing and helping professions. The hypnotherapy training itself, in general holds no more requirements than those required by other less \"official\" certifying bodies. The National Board for Certified Clinical Hypnotherapists, also offers a certifications for healthcare professionals with rigorous requirements for such recognition it is another organization that certifies mental health and medical professionals who meet the rigorous qualifications of the board, have advanced degrees from accredited colleges or universities and are licensed to practice in their respective states. But again, these rigorous requirements have less to do with the demand for excellence of education in hypnosis, over other more vocational certifying agencies and more to do with the applicants already obtained past academic achievements. The vocational requirements for hynotherapuetic certifications are set no lower over all in of training in hypnosis standards than those of other well known The ASCH, BCCH or similar certifying boards. Within the community of hypnotherapists, hypnosis and hypnotherapy are seen as a unique and specialized field, a profession in its own right independent to other professions.To the average hypnotherapist, though medical men, psychologists, counselors and others may unitize hypnosis as a part of what they do in their own profession, they only employ hypnosis as one of several tools and are not experts since they do not specialize in clinical hypnosis, but rather uses the modality in conjunction with their field of clinical expertise. Some Doctorate degrees in the past have also been conferred by various certifying bodies and schools based on minimum requirements of 300 hours or more classroom hours, 100 hours externships under the guidance of clinical hypnotherapist's already well established and life experience as a practicing hypnotherapist. Some hypnotherapists who have met these requirements have been conferred doctorate degrees based on years of clinical experience and practice in the field. The College of Medical and Dental Hypnotherapy in the USA is one such school that used to confer a Doctorate in this manner, Though, at present it is no longer offered, its last official conferred degree being in the year 2004.\n\nThe Hypnosis Motivation Institute (HMI), based in Tarzana, California, is a nationally, not regionally, accredited college dedicated exclusively to teaching hypnosis and hypnotic techniques. HMI offers both local classes on its campus in Tarzana, as well as a comprehensive distance learning based program. HMI is accredited by the Accrediting Council for Continuing Education and Training (ACCET) and the Distance Education and Training Council (DETC) (both accrediting agencies recognized by the U.S. Department of Education) and is approved by the California Board of Behavioral Sciences (BBS), the Dental Board of California (DBC) and the California Board of Registered Nursing (BRN) to provide continuing education credits for ongoing licensing requirements.\n\nThe National College of Hypnosis and Psychotherapy (Est 1977) has had its courses recognised by the Open University since 1997. The National College was the first hypnosis/hypno-psychotherapy institute to apply for and receive formal approval for its programmes from a UK University. For a number of years the National College also had a partnership with Manchester Metropolitan University whereby Diploma holders (DHP(NC)) would be eligible to complete an MSc in Practitioner Research through completion of a research methods course and a dissertation. Since 2012 The National College's Advanced Diploma in Hypno-Psychotherapy grants APL for the Bath Spa University master's degree in Counselling and Psychotherapy Practice.\n\nIn 2008 the London College of Clinical Hypnosis partnered with Thames Valley University (TVU) (now the University of West London (UWL)) to provide UWL validated Post Graduate Diploma and MSc in Clinical Hypnosis qualifications.\n\nIn 2007 The UK College of Hypnosis and Hypnotherapy worked with NCFE (a government regulated national examining and awarding body) to develop an externally verified Level 4 qualification also linked to the National Vocational Qualification based on National Qualifications Framework but on an evidence-based, cognitive behavioural approach. The Dip CBH is accepted to be equivalent to the HPD (see above).\n\nThe Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Government of India, with its letter no. R.14015/25/96-U&H(R) (Pt.) dated 25 November 2003, has stated that hypnotherapy is a recommended mode of therapy in India to be practiced by registered medical practitioner who appropriately trained .\n\nMaharaja Sayajirao University (M.S. University 4 star) at Vadodara is conducting one-year Post Graduate Diploma in Clinical Applied Hypnosis (P.G.D.C.A.H.) from 2000.\n\nClinical hypnosis is included in the syllabus of Master of Philosophy (Clinical Psychology), a pre-doctorate course conducted by The Rehabilitation Council of India which is followed by all universities in India.\n\nIndian Board of Clinical Hypnotherapy, an independent and non government institution is one of the prominent player spreading awareness and education of hypnotherapy in India.\n\nHypnotherapy is the part of syllabus in M.

ERSP is a program of the Electronic Retailing Association http://www.retailing.org in conjunction with the National Advertising Review Council (NARC) and administered by the Council of Better Business Bureaus. The mission of the program is to enhance consumer confidence in electronic retailing, by providing a forum to self-regulate direct response advertising.\n\nERSP was created for several reasons, to: improve consumer confidence in electronic retailing; demonstrate the strong commitment of this industry to effective self-regulation; provide a quick and efficient mechanism for review of high-profile advertising (such as weight-loss advertising) and affecting the discontinuance of advertising containing egregious claims. ERSP investigates the truth and accuracy of claims in direct response advertising from inquiries brought to ERSP’s attention through competitor’s challenges, consumer’s concerns, or through ERSP’s ongoing monitoring program. Working as a voluntary program, ERSP is an efficient and useful tool to assist direct response marketers with timely and cost effective measures to minimize government interference and increase consumer confidence. \n\nThe direct response industry includes long-form (infomercial) productions, short-form commercials, live home shopping channels, print advertising, Internet marketing, cell phone advertising, broadband channels, and radio advertising. Anything that has a direct link to the marketer: either a 1-800 number, email, or website is within ERSP’s purview.\n\nERSP inquires about the evidentiary support that a marketer possesses for product claims communicated through any form of direct-response advertising. Advertising claims come to ERSP’s attention through competitive challenges and ERSP’s ongoing monitoring program. \n\nAmong the most significant benefits afforded by this program are:<br>\n• speed – the ERSP mandate is to resolve all inquiries within 60 calendar days<br>\n• cost –low cost alternative to litigation <br>\n• burden of proof – ERSP does not require that injury to a consumer be proven as may be required by law and<br> \n• confidentiality – a company may bring cases anonymously to ERSP and, conversely, any proprietary information submitted confidentially will remain so in an ERSP challenge.<br>\nThe 60-day structure of this program is vital in limiting marketer inconvenience, but comprehensive enough to provide a thorough review. The success of the program lies in the voluntary participation by direct response marketers and the nature of the self-regulatory format. With the beneficial nature of this format for the electronic retailing industry, ERSP looks forward to not only continuing its monitoring program but to addressing the challenges brought by both consumers and competitors of electronic marketing.\n\nCore claims at issue in an ERSP inquiry might include:\n\n• Establishment Claims (“Clinically proven”)<br>\n• Performance Claims (how well a product performs)<br>\n• Testimonials (Anecdotal tales from consumers about their results with the product)<br>\n• Weight Loss Claims<br>\n• Health and Safety<br>\n• Disclosures<br>\n• Before and After Photographs<br>\n• Puffery<br>\n• Comparative Claims\n\nERSP opened its first case in August 2004.\n\nERSP details its concerns in an initial letter of inquiry and the marketer is given 15 calendar days to respond to ERSP with substantiation for the issues raised. ERSP then has 15 calendar days to ask the marketer for more information regarding its submission. Upon receipt of that request the marketer has 10 days to answer ERSP’s questions, and upon receipt of that, ERSP has 15 calendar days to reach a decision. \n\nIf a marketer does not respond to the initial inquiry letter by ERSP, a press release summarizing the claims at issue and announcing a 10-calendar-day response for the marketer is released.\n\nParticipants in an ERSP review can anticipate one of three results:\n\n• ERSP determines that the core claims at issue are supported by reasonable evidence. <br>\n• ERSP recommends the marketer modify core claims.<br>\n• ERSP determines there is no support for the claims at issue and recommends that the advertiser pull the advertisement.\n\nERSP also refers marketers to the appropriate regulatory agency if they fail to respond or refuse to comply with ERSP’s findings. Compliance inquiries are also conducted to confirm compliance with ERSP recommendations.<br>\n\nIn January 2012, the Electronic Retailing Self-Regulation Program (ERSP) expanded its purview to monitor and review advertising of the coaching and mentoring and live seminar industry. The program is called the “ERSP Review Program.” The ERSP Review Program has two fundamental components: 1) review of telemarketing practices and free live seminar events which include telesales phone calls, scripts and recordings of free, live seminar events ; 2) monitoring of lead generation advertising applicable to the coaching and mentoring industry including print, broadcast and online advertising.\n\nIn 2014 ERSP introduced its Copy Reviewservice which is offered to members of the direct response industry and provides a review of advertising and the reasonable messages being communicated in the advertisement (usually conducted before the advertising is nationally disseminated). The review is focused on the legal, regulatory, self-regulatory and/or statutory provisions that should be considered and/or adhered to with respect to representations (express or implied) disseminated in an advertisement. Unlike a preclearance service which entails a comprehensive review of a marketer’s substantiation, a copy review evaluation is a “\"non evidentiary\"” review and is limited to “\"primary\"” and “\"core\"” claims communicated in an advertisement. Consumer complaints can be sent into ERSP via this complaint form.<br>\n\nCopies of previous ERSP case reports are located here.\n\n"}

In the 1960s he formed the Institute of Ability where he and his wife Ava promoted “holistic health techniques such as fasting and massage, communication exercises like those used in encounter groups, emotional release therapies, past life regression, and a host of other modalities popular among the 1960’s counterculture.” \n\nBerner was known for his skills in helping people improve their life. He taught that honest communication and understanding between one’s self and others was the path to improved relationships, enlightenment and fulfilling the purpose of Life.\n\nCharles Berner had observed that those who were most identified with their self-image, ego or personality tended not to make much progress in personal therapy, which may require flexibility.\n\nMystics who practise insight or jnana yoga report a momentary change of consciousness bringing a direct experience of the reality or truth of self or of others, or of existence, such as is known in various traditions as kensho, satori or samadhi. But traditional techniques for this realisation depend upon a monastic or eremitic life difficult to attain for the average Westerner.\n\nIn spring 1968 it \"just suddenly occurred\" to Charles Berner - \"what source it came from I know not but it wasn't a process of sitting down and figuring it out\" - to combine meditation methods with the structure of an interpersonal workshop.\n\nThe first experimental Enlightenment Intensive was held soon afterwards in the Californian desert with Charles and Ava Berner. Bill Savoie, in an unpublished book, The Bridge to One, writes that “in May 1968 Charles announced we would have a 5 day Enlightenment Intensive. We would just go for it and see what would happen. Charles had a community of about 150 people who would stay connected with his teachings. At that first Enlightenment Intensive there were 26 people. Both Peggy and I were there.\"\n\n“The Enlightenment Intensive retreat that Berner created in 1968 grew out of his interest and research with using interpersonal communication to facilitate the enlightened state and personal growth. Berner wondered if there were more effective ways to accelerate spiritual development and personal growth for his students and clients.” \n\nBerner combined “the 10,000 year old self inquiry meditation, ‘Who Am I,’ with a 20th Century western communication technique developed by Ava Berner called the relating dyad. The result that Berner and his students discovered was that this combination increased consciousness and quickened the process of enlightenment.\n\n“Presentation is the technique used by us,” writes Berner in a booklet titled, Enlightenment. “By continual interaction with another, by presenting continually to another the results of contemplation of the nature of one’s self, the process of enlightenment is accelerated. One maintains his state of increased consciousness because it is achieved while in contact with another, and so one is in Life and the enlightenment is useful.”(5) This was a major discovery in the history enlightenment techniques.\n\nBerner ran dozens over the next few years, gradually refining the format and method, optimising the retreat for the \"weekend truth-seeker\". He also trained others to lead groups. His 99th and last Enlightenment Intensive was held in Berkeley in 1975.\n\nThe typical intensive is three days long: there are also longer Enlightenment Intensives (e.g., seven days, two weeks, six weeks) using essentially the same format as a three-day. It is led by a \"master\" or \"facilitator\" whose role is to set up the retreat, ensure it runs smoothly and provide participants with information, support and encouragement, both as a whole and individually. It has a set of rules designed to ensure a single-minded focus on the purpose of the retreat.\n\nA typical day starts early in the morning and lasts until late in the evening and usually consists of a single structure interspersed with eating, washing, exercise, work and meditation. Each day there are ten to twelve 40-minute periods where participants work in dyads, rotating partners, giving an instruction, chosen by the participant or the master/facilitator, often called a \"koan\". The most usual instructions are \"tell me who you are\", tell me what you are\", \"tell me what life is\" or \"tell me what another is\".\n\nOne partner gives the instruction to the other and listens intently without any response. The \"talking\" partner looks for a direct experiential answer and reports it to their partner. This continues for 5 minutes when, in response to a bell or chime, the \"talking\" partner becomes the \"listening\" partner for 5 minutes. After 40 minutes there is a break before resuming with another partner.\n\nWhen participants have a direct experience of great clarity they may present an answer to the master/facilitator. The participant then continues, either with another instruction or the same instruction.\n\nThere may be a period on the last day to support integration of the experience into daily life. There may also be a follow-up meeting after some days.\n\nEnlightenment Intensives are now held in many countries around the world. They may be offered as a \"stand-alone\" process outside any tradition, movement or organization. There are also numerous derivative processes going by different names, perhaps involving some alteration of the format.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "543420", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=543420", "title": "Hugh Everett III", "text": "Hugh Everett III\n\nHugh Everett III (; November 11, 1930 – July 19, 1982) was an American physicist who first proposed the many-worlds interpretation (MWI) of quantum physics, which he termed his \"relative state\" formulation.\n\nDiscouraged by the scorn of other physicists for MWI, Everett ended his physics career after completing his Ph.D. Afterwards, he developed the use of generalized Lagrange multipliers for operations research and applied this commercially as a defense analyst and a consultant. He was married to Nancy Everett née Gore. They had two children: Elizabeth Everett and Mark Oliver Everett, who became frontman of the musical band Eels.\n\nBorn in 1930, Everett was born and raised in the Washington, D.C. area. Everett's parents separated when he was young. Initially raised by his mother (Katherine Lucille Everett née Kennedy), he was raised by his father (Hugh Everett Jr) and stepmother (Sarah Everett née Thrift) from the age of seven.\n\nEverett won a half scholarship to St. John's College High School in Washington, D.C. From there, he moved to the nearby Catholic University of America to study chemical engineering as an undergraduate. While there, he read about Dianetics in \"Astounding Science Fiction\". Although he never exhibited any interest in Scientology (as Dianetics became), he did retain a distrust of conventional medicine throughout his life.\n\nDuring World War II his father was away fighting in Europe as a lieutenant colonel on the general staff. After World War II, Everett's father was stationed in West Germany, and Hugh joined him, during 1949, taking a year out from his undergraduate studies. Father and son were both keen photographers and took hundreds of pictures of West Germany being rebuilt. Reflecting their technical interests, the pictures were \"almost devoid of people\".\n\nEverett graduated from the Catholic University of America in 1953 with a degree in chemical engineering, although he had completed sufficient courses for a mathematics degree as well. He received a National Science Foundation fellowship that allowed him to attend Princeton University for graduate studies. He started his studies at Princeton in the mathematics department, where he worked on the then-new field of game theory under Albert W. Tucker, but slowly drifted into physics. In 1953 he started taking his first physics courses, notably Introductory Quantum Mechanics with Robert Dicke.\n\nDuring 1954, he attended Methods of Mathematical Physics with Eugene Wigner, although he remained active with mathematics and presented a paper on military game theory in December. He passed his general examinations in the spring of 1955, thereby gaining his master's degree, and then started work on his dissertation that would (much) later make him famous. He switched thesis advisor to John Archibald Wheeler some time in 1955, wrote a couple of short papers on quantum theory and completed his long paper, \"Wave Mechanics Without Probability\" in April 1956.\n\nIn his third year at Princeton, Everett moved into an apartment which he shared with three friends he had made during his first year, Hale Trotter, Harvey Arnold and Charles Misner. Arnold later described Everett as follows: It was during this time that he met Nancy Gore, who typed up his \"Wave Mechanics Without Probability\" paper. Everett married Nancy Gore the next year. The long paper was later retitled as \"The Theory of the Universal Wave Function\".\n\nWheeler himself had traveled to Copenhagen in May 1956 with the goal of getting a favorable reception for at least part of Everett's work, but in vain. In June 1956 Everett started defense work in the Pentagon's Weapons Systems Evaluation Group, returning briefly to Princeton to defend his thesis after some delay in the spring of 1957. A short article, which was a compromise between Everett and Wheeler about how to present the concept and almost identical to the final version of his thesis, was published in \"Reviews of Modern Physics\" Vol 29 #3 454-462, (July 1957), accompanied by an approving review by Wheeler. Everett was not happy with the final form of the article.\n\nUpon graduation in September 1956, Everett was invited to join the Pentagon's newly-forming Weapons Systems Evaluation Group (WSEG), managed by the Institute for Defense Analyses. Between 23–26 October 1956 he attended a weapons orientation course managed by Sandia National Laboratories at Albuquerque, New Mexico to learn about nuclear weapons and became a fan of computer modeling while there. In 1957, he became director of the WSEG's Department of Physical and Mathematical Sciences. After a brief intermission to defend his thesis on quantum theory at Princeton, Everett returned to WSEG and recommenced his research, much of which, but by no means all, remains classified. He worked on various studies of the Minuteman missile project, which was then starting, as well as the influential study \"The Distribution and Effects of Fallout in Large Nuclear Weapon Campaigns\".\n\nDuring March and April 1959, at Wheeler's request, Everett visited Copenhagen, on vacation with his wife and baby daughter, in order to meet with Niels Bohr, the \"father of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics\". The visit was a complete disaster; Everett was unable to communicate the main idea that the universe is describable, in theory, by an objectively existing universal wave function (which does not \"collapse\"); this was simply heresy to Bohr and the others at Copenhagen. The conceptual gulf between their positions was too wide to allow any meeting of minds; Léon Rosenfeld, one of Bohr's devotees, talking about Everett's visit, described Everett as being \"undescribably [sic] stupid and could not understand the simplest things in quantum mechanics\". Everett later described this experience as \"hell...doomed from the beginning\".\n\nHowever, whilst in Copenhagen, in his hotel, he started work on a new idea to use generalized Lagrange multipliers for mathematical optimization. Everett's theorem, published in 1963, relates the Lagrangian bidual to the primal problem.\n\nIn 1962 Everett accepted an invitation to present the relative-state formulation (as it was still called) at a conference on the foundations of quantum mechanics held at Xavier University in Cincinnati. In his exposition Everett presented his derivation of probability and also stated explicitly that observers in all branches of the wavefunction were equally \"real.\" He also agreed with an observation from the floor that the number of branches of the universal wavefunction was an uncountable infinity.\n\nIn August 1964, Everett and several WSEG colleagues started Lambda Corp. to apply military modeling solutions to various civilian problems. During the early 1970s, defense budgets were curtailed and most money went to operational duties in the Vietnam War, resulting in Lambda eventually being absorbed by the General Research Corp.\n\nIn 1973, Everett and Donald Reisler (a Lambda colleague and fellow physicist) left the firm to establish DBS Corporation in Arlington, Virginia. Although the company researched United States Navy ship maintenance optimization and weapons applications, it \"specialized in analyzing the socioeconomic effects of government affirmative action programs\" as a contractor under the auspices of the Department of Justice and the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. For a period of time, the company was partially supported by American Management Systems, a business consulting firm that drew upon algorithms developed by Everett. He concurrently held a non-administrative vice presidency at AMS and was frequently consulted by the firm's founders. \n\nEverett cultivated an early aptitude for computer programming at IDA and favored the TRS-80 at DBS, where he primarily worked for the rest of his life.\n\nIn 1970 Bryce DeWitt wrote an article for \"Physics Today\" on Everett's relative-state theory, which evoked a number of letters from physicists. These letters, and DeWitt's responses to the technical objections raised, were also published. Meanwhile DeWitt, who had corresponded with Everett on the many-worlds / relative state interpretation when originally published in 1957, started editing an anthology on the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. In addition to the original articles by Everett and Wheeler, the anthology was dominated by the inclusion of Everett's 1956 paper \"The Theory of the Universal Wavefunction\", which had never been published before. The book was published late in 1973, sold out completely, and it was not long before an article on Everett's work appeared in the science fiction magazine, \"Analog\".\n\nIn 1977, Everett was invited to give a talk at a conference Wheeler had organised at Wheeler's new location at the University of Texas at Austin. As with the Copenhagen visit, Everett vacationed from his defense work and traveled with his family. Everett met DeWitt there for the first and only time. Everett's talk was quite well received and influenced a number of physicists in the audience, including Wheeler’s graduate student, David Deutsch, who later promoted the many-worlds interpretation to a wider audience. Everett, who \"never wavered in his belief in his many-worlds theory\", enjoyed the presentation; it was the first time for years he had talked about his quantum work in public. Wheeler started the process of returning Everett to a physics career by establishing a new research institute in California, but nothing came of this proposal. Wheeler, although happy to introduce Everett's ideas to a wider audience, was not happy to have his own name associated with Everett's ideas. Eventually, after Everett's death, he formally renounced the theory.\n\nAt the age of 51, Everett died suddenly of a heart attack at home in his bed on the night of July 18–19, 1982. Everett's obesity, frequent chain-smoking and alcohol drinking almost certainly contributed to this, although he seemed healthy at the time. A committed atheist, he had asked that his remains be disposed of in the trash after his death. His wife kept his ashes in an urn for a few years, before complying with his wishes. About Hugh's death his son, Mark Oliver Everett, later said: \n\nOf the companies Everett initiated, only Monowave Corporation still exists (in Seattle as of March 2015). It is managed by co-founder Elaine Tsiang, who received a Ph.D. in physics under Bryce DeWitt at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill before working for DBS as a programmer.\n\nEverett's daughter, Elizabeth, committed suicide in 1996 (saying in her suicide note that she wished her ashes to be thrown out with the garbage so that she might \"end up in the correct parallel universe to meet up w[ith] Daddy\"), and in 1998, his wife, Nancy, died of cancer. Everett's son, Mark Oliver Everett, who found Everett dead, is also known as \"E\" and is the main singer and songwriter for the band Eels. The Eels album \"Electro-Shock Blues\", which was written during this time period, is representative of these deaths. \n\nMark explored his father's work in the hour-long BBC television documentary \"Parallel Worlds, Parallel Lives\". The program was edited and shown on the Public Broadcasting Service's Nova series in the USA during October 2008.\n\nIn the program, Mark mentions how he wasn't aware of his fathers' status as a brilliant and influential physicist until his death in 1982.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The masses are presented as the ideal form of resistance to the social.\n\nThe first edition of the book was published in the final issue of the magazine \"Les Cahiers d'Utopie\" in 1978. It was translated to English by Paul Foss, John Johnston and Paul Patton, and published by the Foreign Agents imprint of Semiotext(e) in 1983. A second edition was published in 2007.\n\nIn the 1970s, magazines such as \"Utopie\", \"Noir et rouge\", \"ICO\", \"Socialisme ou Barbarie\", \"Pouvoir ouvrier\", and the Situationists were unconditionally opposed to the official culture. They saw the masses as hypnotized into submission by a \"society of the spectacle.\" However, Baudrillard interpreted the passivity of the masses in a different way.\n\nThe work starts with the idea that meaning has been devalued. \"For a long time, capital had only to produce goods; consumption ran by itself... Today it is necessary to produce consumers, to produce demand, and this production is infinitely more costly than that of goods.\" The same applies to meaning. \"Today, everything has changed; no longer is meaning in short supply, it is produced everywhere, in ever increasing quantities – it is demand which is weakening... Everywhere the masses are encouraged to speak... They are urged to live socially, electorally, organizationally, sexually, in participation, in festival, in free speech, etc.\"\n\nThe central point of the book is that the masses actively refuse meaning. It is an explicit break with sociology. While modernity laments the ignorance of the docile masses, Baudrillard argues that the indifference of the masses to political events, history, art, and culture, is actually \"a collective retaliation\" and \"a refusal to participate in the recommended ideals, however enlightened.\" All the masses can do - and all they will do - is enjoy the spectacle.\n\nSince \"their representation is no longer possible,\" the masses are probed by means of surveys, polls, and tests. Politics is forced to rely on simulations of the people as a substitute. Masses are \"far too conforming to every solicitation and with a hyperreal conformity which is the extreme form of non-participation.\" As Baudrillard stated in a later interview: \"People do in fact defend themselves, they have their defensive and even offensive strategies; but this time, through indifference.\"\n"}

Ahmed wrote and published 60 books on different aspects of Islam and religion, nine of which were translated into English.\n\nIsrar Ahmed was born in Hisar, a province of East Punjab of British Indian Empire, on 26 April 1932. His father was a civil servant in the British Government who relocated his family from Hisar to Montgomery, now Sahiwal, Punjab Province of Pakistan.\n\nAfter graduating from a local high school, Ahmed moved to Lahore to attend the King Edward Medical University in 1950. He received his MBBS from King Edward Medical University in 1954 and began practising medicine.\n\nIn 1950, he joined Jamaat-e-Islami led by Abul Ala Maududi, but left the party when the latter opted for participating in electoral politics in 1957. Ahmed resigned from the Jamaat-e-Islami in April 1957 because of its involvement in national politics, which he believed was irreconcilable with the revolutionary methodology adopted by the Jama'at in the pre-1947 period. His interest in Islam and philosophy grew further and he subsequently moved to Karachi, Sindh Province in the 1960s where he enrolled in Karachi University. After submitting his thesis in 1965, he earned his MA degree in Islamic Studies from Karachi University.\n\nIn 1967, Ahmed wrote and published the important philosophy book, \"Islamic Renaissance: The Real Task Ahead\", in which he briefly explained the abstract idea of the caliphate system. He maintained that only by revitalising Iman and importance of faith among the Muslims in general and intelligentsia in particular. His solution was to teach Qur'an in contemporary idiom backed by the highest level of scholarship. Commenting on scientific aspects, Ahmed wrote that \"this undertaking would remove the existing dichotomy between modern physical and social sciences on the one hand, and Islamic revealed knowledge on the other.\"\n\nHe criticised modern democracy and the prevalent electoral system and argued that the head of an Islamic state could reject the majority decisions of an elected assembly. Ahmed was awarded the Sitara-i-Imtiaz in 1981. He has authored over 60 books in Urdu on topics related to Islam and Pakistan, nine of which have been translated into English and other languages.\n\nAhmed relinquished the leadership of Tanzeem-e-Islami in October 2002 because of bad health. Hafiz Akif Saeed is the present Amir of the Tanzeem to whom all rufaqaa of Tanzeem renewed their pledge of Baiyah.\n\nLike Wahiduddin Khan, Naeem Siddiqui and Javed Ahmad Ghamidi, Ahmed also worked closely with Syed Abul A'la Maududi (alternative spelling Syed Maudoodi; often referred to as Maulana Maududi) (1903–1979) and Amin Ahsan Islahi. Supporters describe his vision of Islam as having been synthesised from the diverse sources. He has also acknowledged the \"deep influence\" of Shah Waliullah Dehlawi, the 18th century Indian Islamic leader, anti-colonial activist, jurist, and scholar. \n\n\"In the context of Qur'anic exegesis and understanding, Ahmed was a firm traditionalist of the genre of Mehmood Hassan Deobandi and Allama Shabbir Ahmed Usmani; yet he presented Qur'anic teachings in a scientific and enlightened way\".\nAhmed believed in what he called \"Islamic revolutionary thought,\" which consists of the idea that Islam – the teachings of the Qur'an and the Sunnah – must be implemented in the social, cultural, juristic, political, and economic spheres of life. In this he is said to follow Mohammad Rafiuddin and Muhammad Iqbal. The first attempt towards the actualisation of this concept was reportedly made by Abul Kalam Azad through his short-lived party, the Hizbullah. Another attempt was made by Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi through his Jamaat-e-Islami party. Although the Jamaat-e-Islami has reached some influence, Ahmed resigned from the party in 1956 when it entered the electoral process and believed that such an involvement led to \"degeneration from a pure Islamic revolutionary party to a mere political one\".\n\nOriginally a member of Jamaat-e-Islami, Ahmed became disappointed with its electoral activity, \"significant policy matters\", and what he saw as the \"lack of effort to create an Islamic renaissance through the revolutionary process.\" He and some other individuals resigned from JI and in 1956 founded the nucleus of Tanzeem-e-Islami, an attempt to create a \"disciplined organization.\" \"A resolution was passed which subsequently became the Mission Statement of Tanzeem-e-Islami.\"\n\nAlong with his work to revive \"the Qur'an-centered Islamic perennial philosophy and world-view\" Ahmed aimed with his party to \"reform the society in a practical way with the ultimate objective of establishing a true Islamic State, or the System of Khilafah\".\n\nAccording to Tanzeem-e-Islami's FAQ, while both Hizb ut-Tahrir and Tanzeem-e-Islami share belief in reviving the Caliphate as a means of implementing Islam in all spheres of life, Tanzeem-e-Islami does not believe in involvement in electoral politics, armed struggle, coup d'état to establish a caliphate, and has no set plan of detailed workings for the future Caliphate. Tanzeem-e-Islami emphasises that iman (faith) among Muslims must be revived in \"a significant portion of the Muslim society\" before there can be an Islamic revival.\n\nWhile Ahmed \"considers himself a product\" of the teachings of \"comprehensive and holistic concept of the Islamic obligations\" of Abul Ala Maududi, he opposes Jamaat-e-Islami's \"plunge\" into \"the arena of power politics,\" which he considered to have been \"disastrous.\"\n\nIn response to the state of emergency in 2007, Ahmed called for lifting the emergency, reinstatement of Supreme Court justices, and withdrawal of all actions taken in pursuance of the proclamation of emergency and the PCO law besides resignation of President Pervez Musharraf.\n\nIn a televised press conference, Ahmed called for resignation of Pervez Musharraf from both president and chief of army staff. Ahmed appealed to President General Musharraf to lift the state emergency and step down for the nation's greater interests. At the television news channels, Ahmed also predicted and warned the nation that, \"If the situation worsens, the NATO forces are waiting on the western front to move into Pakistan and may deprive the country of its nuclear assets while on the eastern front, India is ready to stage an action replay of 1971 events and has alerted its armed forces to intervene in to check threats to peace in the region.\"\n\nIn 2006 Canada's \"National Post\" newspapers quoted Ahmed as saying that \"Islam's renaissance will begin in Pakistan... because the Arab world is living under subjugation. Only the Pakistan region has the potential for standing up against the nefarious designs of the global power-brokers and to resist the rising tides of the Jewish/Zionist hegemony.\n\n\"Asia Times\" reports that in September 1995 Ahmed told the annual convention of the Islamic Society of North America: \"The process of the revival of Islam in different parts of the world is real. A final showdown between the Muslim world and the non-Muslim world, which has been captured by the Jews, would soon take place. The Gulf War was just a rehearsal for the coming conflict.\" He appealed to the Muslims of the world, including those in the US, to prepare themselves for the coming conflict.\n\nAhmed died of cardiac arrest at his home in Lahore on the morning of 14 April 2010. According to his son, his health deteriorated at around 1:30 am with pain in the back. He was a long time heart patient.\n\n\n"}

He was also involved in the sequel publications to the \"Encyclopédie\", took on Diderot's editorial role, and was a translator of numerous works to the French language.\n\nRobinet was born in Rennes on 23 June 1735, and died there on 24 March 1820. Early in life he was educated by the Jesuits and embraced the rule of St. Ignatius, but soon regretted his loss of freedom and entered the world of letters. He traveled to Holland to publish his book \"De la nature\" which in time gained notoriety due to the peculiar opinions presented in the book. Upon his return to Paris in 1778 he was appointed royal censor and private secretary to Antoine-Jean Amelot de Chaillou. During the French revolution he lost all employment and retired to his home, where he lived in relative seclusion, occupied only with family duties. He had been a disciple of encyclopédistes, but was also committed to the principles of the church. He eventually returned to the church and signed a recantation of his errors.\n\nRobinet is one of the many precursors in the history of evolutionary thought who contributed to the process which later crystallized in the work of Charles Darwin. Jean-Baptiste was led from observations into the idea of the transmutation of species and so into a theory of evolution, which in some important respects anticipated modern ideas. In \"De la nature\", published in 1761, Nature was not God, but necessarily and eternally evolved from Divine essence. Creation is the everlasting work of the Deity, who from eternity has been working and smoothly progressing in the manner of Nature. There are no leaps. All things must have come from unity, which has been infinitely diversified. Kingdoms, classes and species are artificial works of man, of which Nature knows nothing. The orangutan was next to man in the scale of being. All the links of Nature's chain may not yet have been discovered, but they would be discovered before long.\n\nRobinet represented a teleological point of view in his discussions on evolution. All was produced from a divine, pre-existing, and static master-plan. He wrote that in diverse lower animals, Nature advances, groping towards the excellence of the human being. Some imperceptible progress is made at each step, each new production a variation of the primitive design, becoming very responsive after a number of metamorphoses. The development of the human machine had taken a long succession of arrangements, compositions and dissolutions, additions and deletions, alterations, cancellations, and changes of all kinds.\n\nRobinet, in collaboration with Charles-Joseph Panckoucke were exponents of the \"Encyclopédie\", and published a supplement to it in four volumes (1776-1777). He also participated in the publication of one of the first works of its kind, the thirty volume social science distionary \"Dictionnaire universel des sciences morales, économique, politique et diplomatique; ou bibliothèque de l’homme d’État et du citoyen\" (1777–83) created as a \"library of statesmen and citizens”. Robinet also published numerous translations into French, in particular, works by David Hume and Johann Joachim Winckelmann. He was probably the translator of Hume's \"Essays Moral and Political\" and drew heavily upon it in his \"Considerations sur l'état présent de la littérature en Europe\".\n\n"}

She currently has a loose affiliation with the Center for Bioethics and Humanities, University of Colorado Denver, but considers herself mostly independent. She has previously worked variously at the University of Colorado Boulder, the University of Nebraska Medical Center, and Randolph-Macon Women's College, having studied at the University of Virginia, Harvard Divinity School and Scripps College.\n\nEarly in her career, she focused on questions of human health and the environment, co-authoring \"Environmentalism and the New Logic of Business\" (Oxford, 2000) and \"The Ethics of Environmentally Responsible Health Care\" (Oxford, 2004). Since the 2000s, much of her work has focused on human relationships with animals. She collaborated with Marc Bekoff for \"Wild Justice\" (Chicago, 2010), and authored \"The Last Walk\" (Chicago, 2012) and \"Run, Spot, Run\" (Chicago, 2016).\n\nPierce completed her Bachelor of Arts at Scripps College, before studying for a Master of Divinity at Divinity School of Harvard University. She then received a PhD in religious studies (specialising in religious ethics) at the University of Virginia. In 1993, she briefly worked as an assistant professor in the Randolph-Macon Women's College Department of Religion. From 1993 to 2000, she was an assistant professor at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in the Humanities and Law section of the Department of Preventive and Societal Medicine. Pierce's first book, \"Environmentalism and the New Logic of Business\", co-written with R. Edward Freeman and Richard H. Dodd, was published by Oxford University Press in 2000. She was a visiting fellow at the University of Pittsburgh Center for Bioethics and Health Law from 1990 to 2000, and then, from 2001 to 2006, she lectured at the University of Colorado Boulder, working in departments focussed respectively on philosophy, religious studies and environmental studies. During her time at Colorado, her second book, \"The Ethics of Environmentally Responsible Health Care\" (co-written with Andrew Jameton) was published by Oxford, and her third, \"Morality Play: Case Studies in Ethics\", was published by McGraw-Hill in 2005 (with a second edition published by Waveland Press in 2013). Pierce co-edited the reader \"Contemporary Bioethics\" with George Rendels, which was published by Oxford in 2009.\n\nHaving previously focussed her research on human health, including her early research interests in the connections between health and the environment, Pierce began to focus her research on animals in the 2000s. She co-authored \"Wild Justice: The Moral Lives of Animals\" with the ecologist and ethologist Marc Bekoff, and this was published in 2010 by the University of Chicago Press. In the book, the authors draw upon evolutionary theory and ethology to argue that many animals display evidence of consciousness, as well as a range of behaviours which they categorise under the categories of \"cooperation\", \"empathy\" and \"justice\". These observations are used to make a case that animals may have a sense of morality. Subsequently, her sole-authored books \"The Last Walk: Reflections on our Pets at the End of Their Lives\" and \"Run, Spot, Run: The Ethics of Keeping Pets\" were published by Chicago in 2012 and 2016 respectively. \"The Last Walk\" explores the ethics of companion death, with a focus on Pierce's own relationship with Ody, a Hungarian vizsla who was at one time her companion. \"Run, Spot, Run\" explores the ethical ambiguity of pet ownership in general.\n\n, she is a faculty affiliate at the Center for Bioethics and Humanities, University of Colorado Denver. However, this connection is a loose one; she no longer teaches, and considers herself an \"independent entity\", focusing on writing instead of the administration and bureaucracy of university work. She has two books forthcoming; with Bekoff, she has written a book entitled \"Freedoms for Animals: Compassion and Coexistence in the Anthropocene\", which is to published by Beacon Press, and with the veterinarians Amir Shanan and Tami Shearer, she has written \"Hospice and Palliative Care for Companion Animals: Principles and Practice\", which is to be published by Wiley.\n\nPierce has authored or co-authored over 30 articles in peer reviewed journals and chapters in scholarly edited collections.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "147079", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=147079", "title": "John Searle", "text": "John Searle\n\nJohn Rogers Searle (; born 31 July 1932) is an American philosopher. He is currently Willis S. and Marion Slusser Professor Emeritus of the Philosophy of Mind and Language and Professor of the Graduate School at the University of California, Berkeley. Widely noted for his contributions to the philosophy of language, philosophy of mind, and social philosophy, he began teaching at UC Berkeley in 1959.\n\nAs an undergraduate at the University of Wisconsin, Searle was secretary of \"Students against Joseph McCarthy\". He received all his university degrees, BA, MA, and DPhil, from the University of Oxford, where he held his first faculty positions. Later, at UC Berkeley, he became the first tenured professor to join the 1964–1965 Free Speech Movement. In the late 1980s, Searle challenged the restrictions of Berkeley's 1980 rent stabilization ordinance. Following what came to be known as the California Supreme Court's \"Searle Decision\" of 1990, Berkeley changed its rent control policy, leading to large rent increases between 1991 and 1994.\n\nIn 2000 Searle received the Jean Nicod Prize; in 2004, the National Humanities Medal; and in 2006, the Mind & Brain Prize. Searle's early work on speech acts, influenced by J. L. Austin and Ludwig Wittgenstein, helped establish his reputation. His notable concepts include the \"Chinese room\" argument against \"strong\" artificial intelligence. In March 2017, Searle was accused of sexual assault.\n\nSearle's father, G. W. Searle, an electrical engineer, was employed by AT&T Corporation; his mother, Hester Beck Searle, was a physician.\n\nSearle began his college education at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and in his junior year became a Rhodes Scholar at the University of Oxford, where he obtained all his university degrees, BA, MA, and DPhil.\n\nHis first two faculty positions were at Oxford as Research Lecturer, and Lecturer and Tutor at Christ Church.\n\nWhile an undergraduate at the University of Wisconsin, Searle became the secretary of \"Students against Joseph McCarthy\". (McCarthy at that time served as the junior senator from Wisconsin.) In 1959 Searle began teaching at Berkeley, and he was the first tenured professor to join the 1964–65 Free Speech Movement.\nIn 1969, while serving as chairman of the Academic Freedom Committee of the Academic Senate of the University of California, he supported the university in its dispute with students over the People's Park.\nIn \"The Campus War: A Sympathetic Look at the University in Agony\" (1971), Searle investigates the causes behind the campus protests of the era. In it he declares: \"I have been attacked by both the House Un-American Activities Committee and ... several radical polemicists ... Stylistically, the attacks are interestingly similar. Both rely heavily on insinuation and innuendo, and both display a hatredone might almost say terrorof close analysis and dissection of argument.\" He asserts that \"My wife was threatened that I (and other members of the administration) would be assassinated or violently attacked.\"\n\nIn the late 1980s, Searle, along with other landlords, petitioned Berkeley's rental board to raise the limits on how much he could charge tenants under the city's 1980 rent-stabilization ordinance. The rental board refused to consider Searle's petition and Searle filed suit, charging a violation of due process. In 1990, in what came to be known as the \"Searle Decision\", the California Supreme Court upheld Searle's argument in part and Berkeley changed its rent-control policy, leading to large rent-increases between 1991 and 1994. Searle was reported to see the issue as one of fundamental rights, being quoted as saying \"The treatment of landlords in Berkeley is comparable to the treatment of blacks in the South...our rights have been massively violated and we are here to correct that injustice.\" The court described the debate as a \"morass of political invective, ad hominem attack, and policy argument\".\n\nShortly after the September 11 attacks, Searle wrote an article arguing that the attacks were a particular event in a long-term struggle against forces that are intractably opposed to the United States, and signaled support for a more aggressive neoconservative interventionist foreign policy. He called for the realization that the United States is in a more-or-less permanent state of war with these forces. Moreover, a probable course of action would be to deny terrorists the use of foreign territory from which to stage their attacks. Finally, he alluded to the long-term nature of the conflict and blamed the attacks on the lack of American resolve to deal forcefully with America's enemies over the past several decades.\n\nIn March 2017, Searle became the subject of sexual assault allegations. The \"Los Angeles Times\" reported: \"A new lawsuit alleges that university officials failed to properly respond to complaints that John Searle, an 84-year-old renowned philosophy professor, sexually assaulted his 24-year-old research associate last July and cut her pay when she rejected his advances.\" The case brought to light several earlier complaints against Searle, on which Berkeley allegedly had failed to act.\nThe lawsuit, filed in a California court on March 21, 2017, sought damages both from Searle and from the Regents of the University of California as his employers. It also claims that Jennifer Hudin, the director of the John Searle Center for Social Ontology, where the complainant had been employed as an assistant to Searle, has stated that Searle \"has had sexual relationships with his students and others in the past in exchange for academic, monetary or other benefits\".\nAfter news of the lawsuit became public, several previous allegations of sexual harassment by Searle were also revealed.\n\nSearle has five honorary-doctorate degrees from four different countries and is an honorary visiting professor at Tsing Hua University and at East China Normal University.\n\nIn 2000 Searle received the Jean Nicod Prize; in 2004, the National Humanities Medal; and in 2006, the Mind & Brain Prize.\n\nSearle's early work, which did a great deal to establish his reputation, was on speech acts. He attempted to synthesize ideas from many colleaguesincluding J. L. Austin (the \"illocutionary act\", from \"How To Do Things with Words\"), Ludwig Wittgenstein and G.C.J. Midgley (the distinction between regulative and constitutive rules)with his own thesis that such acts are constituted by the rules of language. He also drew on the work of Paul Grice (the analysis of meaning as an attempt at being understood), Hare and Stenius (the distinction, concerning meaning, between illocutionary force and propositional content), P. F. Strawson, John Rawls and William Alston, who maintained that sentence meaning consists in sets of regulative rules requiring the speaker to perform the illocutionary act indicated by the sentence and that such acts involve the utterance of a sentence which (a) indicates that one performs the act; (b) means what one says; and (c) addresses an audience in the vicinity.\n\nIn his 1969 book \"Speech Acts\", Searle sets out to combine all these elements to give his account of illocutionary acts. There he provides an analysis of what he considers the prototypical illocutionary act of promising and offers sets of semantical rules intended to represent the linguistic meaning of devices indicating further illocutionary act types. Among the concepts presented in the book is the distinction between the \"illocutionary force\" and the \"propositional content\" of an utterance. Searle does not precisely define the former as such, but rather introduces several possible illocutionary forces by example. According to Searle, the sentences...\n\n...each indicate the same propositional content (Sam smoking habitually) but differ in the illocutionary force indicated (respectively, a statement, a question, a command and an expression of desire).\n\nAccording to a later account, which Searle presents in \"Intentionality\" (1983) and which differs in important ways from the one suggested in \"Speech Acts\", illocutionary acts are characterised by their having \"conditions of satisfaction\" (an idea adopted from Strawson's 1971 paper \"Meaning and Truth\") and a \"direction of fit\" (an idea adopted from Elizabeth Anscombe). For example, the statement \"John bought two candy bars\" is satisfied if and only if it is true, i.e. John did buy two candy bars. By contrast, the command \"John, buy two candy bars!\" is satisfied if and only if John carries out the action of purchasing two candy bars. Searle refers to the first as having the \"word-to-world\" direction of fit, since the words are supposed to change to accurately represent the world, and the second as having the \"world-to-word\" direction of fit, since the world is supposed to change to match the words. (There is also the double direction of fit, in which the relationship goes both ways, and the null or zero direction of fit, in which it goes neither way because the propositional content is presupposed, as in \"I'm sorry I ate John's candy bars.\")\n\nIn \"Foundations of Illocutionary Logic\" (1985, with Daniel Vanderveken), Searle prominently uses the notion of the \"illocutionary point\".\n\nSearle's speech-act theory has been challenged by several thinkers in a variety of ways. Collections of articles referring to Searle's account are found in Burkhardt 1990 and Lepore / van Gulick 1991.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Searle had a brief exchange with Jacques Derrida regarding speech-act theory. The exchange was characterized by a degree of mutual hostility between the philosophers, each of whom accused the other of having misunderstood his basic points. Searle was particularly hostile to Derrida's deconstructionist framework and much later refused to let his response to Derrida be printed along with Derrida's papers in the 1988 collection \"Limited Inc\". Searle did not consider Derrida's approach to be legitimate philosophy or even intelligible writing and argued that he did not want to legitimize the deconstructionist point of view by dedicating any attention to it. Consequently, some critics have considered the exchange to be a series of elaborate misunderstandings rather than a debate, while others have seen either Derrida or Searle gaining the upper hand. The level of hostility can be seen from Searle's statement that \"It would be a mistake to regard Derrida's discussion of Austin as a confrontation between two prominent philosophical traditions\", to which Derrida replied that that sentence was \"the only sentence of the 'reply' to which I can subscribe\". Commentators have frequently interpreted the exchange as a prominent example of a confrontation between analytical and continental philosophy.\n\nThe Searle–Derrida debate began in 1972, when, in his paper \"Signature Event Context\", Derrida analyzed J. L. Austin's theory of the illocutionary act. While sympathetic to Austin's departure from a purely denotational account of language to one that includes \"force\", Derrida was sceptical of the framework of normativity employed by Austin. He argued that Austin had missed the fact that any speech event is framed by a \"structure of absence\" (the words that are left unsaid due to contextual constraints) and by \"iterability\" (the repeatability of linguistic elements outside of their context). Derrida argued that the focus on intentionality in speech-act theory was misguided because intentionality is restricted to that which is already established as a possible intention. He also took issue with the way Austin had excluded the study of fiction, non-serious or \"parasitic\" speech, wondering whether this exclusion was because Austin had considered these speech genres governed by different structures of meaning, or simply due to a lack of interest.\n\nIn his brief reply to Derrida, \"Reiterating the Differences: A Reply to Derrida\", Searle argued that Derrida's critique was unwarranted because it assumed that Austin's theory attempted to give a full account of language and meaning when its aim was much narrower. Searle considered the omission of parasitic discourse forms to be justified by the narrow scope of Austin's inquiry. Searle agreed with Derrida's proposal that intentionality presupposes iterability, but did not apply the same concept of intentionality used by Derrida, being unable or unwilling to engage with the continental conceptual apparatus. This, in turn, caused Derrida to criticize Searle for not being sufficiently familiar with phenomenological perspectives on intentionality. Searle also argued that Derrida's disagreement with Austin turned on his having misunderstood Austin's (and Peirce's) type–token distinction and his failure to understand Austin's concept of failure in relation to performativity. Some critics have suggested that Searle, by being so grounded in the analytical tradition, was unable to engage with Derrida's continental phenomenological tradition and was at fault for the unsuccessful nature of the exchange.\n\nDerrida, in his response to Searle ( in \"Limited Inc\"), ridiculed Searle's positions. Arguing that a clear sender of Searle's message could not be established, he suggested that Searle had formed with Austin a \"société à responsabilité limitée\" (a \"limited liability company\") due to the ways in which the ambiguities of authorship within Searle's reply circumvented the very speech act of his reply. Searle did not respond. Later in 1988, Derrida tried to review his position and his critiques of Austin and Searle, reiterating that he found the constant appeal to \"normality\" in the analytical tradition to be problematic.\n\nIn the debate, Derrida praises Austin's work, but argues that he is wrong to banish what Austin calls \"infelicities\" from the \"normal\" operation of language. One \"infelicity,\" for instance, occurs when it cannot be known whether a given speech act is \"sincere\" or \"merely citational\" (and therefore possibly ironic, etc.). Derrida argues that every iteration is necessarily \"citational\", due to the graphematic nature of speech and writing, and that language could not work at all without the ever-present and ineradicable possibility of such alternate readings. Derrida takes Searle to task for his attempt to get around this issue by grounding final authority in the speaker's inaccessible \"intention\". Derrida argues that intention cannot possibly govern how an iteration signifies, once it becomes hearable or readable. All speech acts borrow a language whose significance is determined by historical-linguistic context, and by the alternate possibilities that this context makes possible. This significance, Derrida argues, cannot be altered or governed by the whims of intention.\n\nIn 1995, Searle gave a brief reply to Derrida in \"The Construction of Social Reality\". \"Derrida, as far as I can tell, does not have an argument. He simply declares that there is nothing outside of texts (\"Il n'y a pas de 'hors-texte\"').\" Then, in \"Limited Inc.\", Derrida \"apparently takes it all back\", claiming that he meant only \"the banality that everything exists in some \"context\" or other!\" Derrida and others like him present \"an array of weak or even nonexistent arguments for a conclusion that seems preposterous\". In \"Of Grammatology\" (1967), Derrida claims that a text must not be interpreted by reference to anything \"outside of language\", which for him means \"outside of writing in general\". He adds: \"\"There is nothing outside of the text\" [there is no outside-text; \"il n'y a pas de hors-texte\"]\" (brackets in the translation). This is a metaphor: \"un hors-texte\" is a bookbinding term, referring to a 'plate' bound among pages of text. Searle cites Derrida's supplementary metaphor rather than his initial contention. However, whether Searle's objection is good against that contention is the point in debate.\n\nSearle defines intentionality as the power of minds to be about, to represent (see Correspondence theory of truth), or to stand for, things, properties and states of affairs in the world. The nature of intentionality is an important part of discussions of Searle's \"Philosophy of Mind\". Searle emphasizes that the word 'intentionality, (the part of the mind directed to/from/about objects and relations in the world independent of mind) should not be confused with the word 'intensionality' (the logical property of some sentences that do not pass the test of 'extensionality'). In \"Intentionality: An Essay in the Philosophy of Mind\" (1983), Searle applies certain elements of his account(s) of \"illocutionary acts\" to the investigation of intentionality. Searle also introduces a technical term \"the Background\", which, according to him, has been the source of much philosophical discussion (\"though I have been arguing for this thesis for almost twenty years,\" Searle writes, \"many people whose opinions I respect still disagree with me about it\"). He calls \"Background\" the set of abilities, capacities, tendencies, and dispositions that humans have and that are not themselves intentional states. Thus, when someone asks us to \"cut the cake\" we know to use a knife and when someone asks us to \"cut the grass\" we know to use a lawnmower (and not vice versa), even though the actual request did not include this detail. Searle sometimes supplements his reference to the \"Background\" with the concept of \"the Network\", one's network of other beliefs, desires, and other intentional states necessary for any particular intentional state to make sense. Searle argues that the concept of a Background is similar to the concepts provided by several other thinkers, including Wittgenstein's private language argument (\"the work of the later Wittgenstein is in large part about the Background\") and Pierre Bourdieu's \"habitus\".\n\nTo give an example, two chess players might be engaged in a bitter struggle at the board, but they share all sorts of Background presuppositions: that they will take turns to move, that no one else will intervene, that they are both playing to the same rules, that the fire alarm won't go off, that the board won't suddenly disintegrate, that their opponent won't magically turn into a grapefruit, and so on indefinitely. As most of these possibilities won't have occurred to either player, Searle thinks the Background must be unconscious, though elements of it can be called to consciousness (if the fire alarm does go off, say).\n\nIn his debate with Derrida, Searle argued against Derrida's view that a statement can be disjoined from the original intentionality of its author, for example when no longer connected to the original author, while still being able to produce meaning. Searle maintained that even if one was to see a written statement with no knowledge of authorship it would still be impossible to escape the question of intentionality, because \"a meaningful sentence is just a standing possibility of the (intentional) speech act\". For Searle ascribing intentionality to a statement was a basic requirement for attributing it any meaning at all.\n\nBuilding upon his views about intentionality, Searle presents a view concerning consciousness in his book \"The Rediscovery of the Mind\" (1992). He argues that, starting with behaviorism (an early but influential scientific view, succeeded by many later accounts that Searle also dismisses), much of modern philosophy has tried to deny the existence of consciousness, with little success. In \"Intentionality\", he parodies several alternative theories of consciousness by replacing their accounts of intentionality with comparable accounts of the hand:\n\nSearle argues that philosophy has been trapped by a false dichotomy: that, on the one hand, the world consists of nothing but objective particles in fields of force, but that yet, on the other hand, consciousness is clearly a subjective first-person experience.\n\nSearle says simply that both are true: consciousness is a real subjective experience, caused by the physical processes of the brain. (A view which he suggests might be called \"biological naturalism\".)\n\nSearle has argued that critics like Daniel Dennett, who (he claims) insist that discussing subjectivity is unscientific because science presupposes objectivity, are making a category error. Perhaps the goal of science is to establish and validate statements which are \"epistemically\" objective, (i.e., whose truth can be discovered and evaluated by any interested party), but are not necessarily \"ontologically\" objective.\n\nSearle calls any value judgment epistemically \"subjective\". Thus, \"McKinley is prettier than Everest\" is \"epistemically subjective\", whereas \"McKinley is higher than Everest\" is \"epistemically objective.\" In other words, the latter statement is evaluable (in fact, falsifiable) by an understood ('background') criterion for mountain height, like 'the summit is so many meters above sea level'. No such criteria exist for prettiness.\n\nBeyond this distinction, Searle thinks there are certain phenomena (including all conscious experiences) that are \"ontologically\" subjective, i.e. can only exist as subjective experience. For example, although it might be subjective or objective in the epistemic sense, a doctor's note that a patient suffers from back pain is an ontologically \"objective\" claim: it counts as a medical diagnosis only because the existence of back pain is \"an objective fact of medical science\". The pain itself, however, is \"ontologically subjective\": it is only experienced by the person having it.\n\nSearle goes on to affirm that \"where consciousness is concerned, the existence of the appearance \"is\" the reality\". His view that the epistemic and ontological senses of objective/subjective are cleanly separable is crucial to his self-proclaimed biological naturalism.\n\nA consequence of biological naturalism is that if we want to create a conscious being, we will have to duplicate whatever physical processes the brain goes through to cause consciousness. Searle thereby means to contradict what he calls \"Strong AI\", defined by the assumption that as soon as a certain kind of software is running on a computer, a conscious being is thereby created.\n\nIn 1980, Searle presented the \"Chinese room\" argument, which purports to prove the falsity of strong AI. Assume you do not speak Chinese and imagine yourself in a room with two slits, a book, and some scratch paper. Someone slides you some Chinese characters through the first slit, you follow the instructions in the book, transcribing characters as instructed onto the scratch paper, and slide the resulting sheet out the second slit. To people on the outside world, it appears the room speaks Chinese—they slide Chinese statements in one slit and get valid responses in return—yet you do not understand a word of Chinese. This suggests, according to Searle, that no computer can ever understand Chinese or English, because, as the thought experiment suggests, being able to 'translate' Chinese into English does not entail 'understanding' either Chinese or English: all which the person in the thought experiment, and hence a computer, is able to do is to execute certain syntactic manipulations.\n\nStevan Harnad argues that Searle's \"Strong AI\" is really just another name for functionalism and computationalism, and that these positions are the real targets of his critique. Functionalists argue that consciousness can be defined as a set of informational processes inside the brain. It follows that anything that carries out the same informational processes as a human is also conscious. Thus, if we wrote a computer program that was conscious, we could run that computer program on, say, a system of ping-pong balls and beer cups and the system would be equally conscious, because it was running the same information processes.\n\nSearle argues that this is impossible, since consciousness is a physical property, like digestion or fire. No matter how good a simulation of digestion you build on the computer, it will not digest anything; no matter how well you simulate fire, nothing will get burnt. By contrast, informational processes are \"observer-relative\": observers pick out certain patterns in the world and consider them information processes, but information processes are not things-in-the-world themselves. Since they do not exist at a physical level, Searle argues, they cannot have \"causal efficacy\" and thus cannot cause consciousness. There is no physical law, Searle insists, that can see the equivalence between a personal computer, a series of ping-pong balls and beer cans, and a pipe-and-water system all implementing the same program.\n\nSearle extended his inquiries into observer-relative phenomena by trying to understand social reality. Searle begins by arguing collective intentionality (e.g. \"we're going for a walk\") is a distinct form of intentionality, not simply reducible to individual intentionality (e.g. \"I'm going for a walk with him and I think he thinks he's going for a walk with me and he thinks I think I'm going for a walk with him and ...\").\n\nIn \"The Construction of Social Reality\" (1995), Searle addresses the mystery of how social constructs like \"baseball\" or \"money\" can exist in a world consisting only of physical particles in fields of force. Adapting an idea by Elizabeth Anscombe in \"On Brute Facts,\" Searle distinguishes between \"brute facts\", like the height of a mountain, and \"institutional facts\", like the score of a baseball game. Aiming at an explanation of social phenomena in terms of Anscombe's notion, he argues that society can be explained in terms of institutional facts, and institutional facts arise out of collective intentionality through constitutive rules with the logical form \"X counts as Y in C\". Thus, for instance, filling out a ballot counts as a vote in a polling place, getting so many votes counts as a victory in an election, getting a victory counts as being elected president in the presidential race, etc.\n\nMany sociologists, however, do not see Searle's contributions to social theory as very significant. Neil Gross, for example, argues that Searle's views on society are more or less a reconstitution of the sociologist Émile Durkheim's theories of social facts, social institutions, collective representations, and the like. Searle's ideas are thus open to the same criticisms as Durkheim's. Searle responded that Durkheim's work was worse than he had originally believed and, admitting he had not read much of Durkheim's work, said that, \"Because Durkheim's account seemed so impoverished I did not read any further in his work.\" Steven Lukes, however, responded to Searle's response to Gross and argued point by point against the allegations that Searle makes against Durkheim, essentially upholding Gross' argument that Searle's work bears great resemblance to Durkheim's. Lukes attributes Searle's miscomprehension of Durkheim's work to the fact that Searle never read Durkheim.\n\nIn recent years, Searle's main interlocutor on issues of social ontology has been Tony Lawson. Although their accounts of social reality are similar, there are important differences. Lawson places emphasis on the notion of social totality whereas Searle prefers to refer to institutional facts. Furthermore, Searle believes that emergence implies causal reduction whereas Lawson argues that social totalities cannot be completed explained by the causal powers of their components. Searle also places language at the foundation of the construction of social reality while Lawson believes that community formation necessarily precedes the development of language and therefore there must be the possibility for non-linguistic social structure formation. The debate is ongoing and takes place additionally through regular meetings of the Centre for Social Ontology at the University of California, Berkeley and the Cambridge Social Ontology Group at the University of Cambridge.\n\nIn \"Rationality in Action\" (2001), Searle argues that standard notions of rationality are badly flawed. According to what he calls the Classical Model, rationality is seen as something like a train track: you get on at one point with your beliefs and desires and the rules of rationality compel you all the way to a conclusion. Searle doubts this picture of rationality holds generally.\n\nSearle briefly critiques one particular set of these rules: those of mathematical decision theory. He points out that its axioms require that anyone who valued a quarter and their life would, at some odds, bet their life for a quarter. Searle insists he would never take such a bet and believes that this stance is perfectly rational.\n\nMost of his attack is directed against the common conception of rationality, which he believes is badly flawed. First, he argues that reasons don't cause you to do anything, because having sufficient reason \"wills\" (but doesn't \"force\") you to do that thing. So in any decision situation we experience a gap between our reasons and our actions. For example, when we decide to vote, we do not simply determine that we care most about economic policy and that we prefer candidate Jones's economic policy. We also have to make an effort to cast our vote. Similarly, every time a guilty smoker lights a cigarette they are aware of succumbing to their craving, not merely of acting automatically as they do when they exhale. It is this gap that makes us think we have \"freedom of the will\". Searle thinks whether we really have free will or not is an open question, but considers its absence highly unappealing because it makes the feeling of freedom of will an epiphenomenon, which is highly unlikely from the evolutionary point of view given its biological cost. He also says: \" \"All rational activity presupposes free will\" \".\n\nSecond, Searle believes we can rationally do things that don't result from our own desires. It is widely believed that one cannot derive an \"ought\" from an \"is\", i.e. that facts about how the world is can never tell you what you should do ('Hume's Law'). By contrast, in so far as a fact is understood as relating to an institution (marriage, promises, commitments, etc.), which is to be understood as a system of constitutive rules, then what one should do can be understood as following from the institutional fact of what one has done; institutional fact, then, can be understood as opposed to the \"brute facts\" related to Hume's Law. For example, Searle believes the fact that you promised to do something means you should do it, because by making the promise you are participating in the constitutive rules that arrange the system of promise making itself, and therefore understand a \"shouldness\" as implicit in the mere factual action of promising. Furthermore, he believes that this provides a desire-independent reason for an action—if you order a drink at a bar, you should pay for it even if you have no desire to. This argument, which he first made in his paper, \"How to Derive 'Ought' from 'Is'\" (1964), remains highly controversial, but even three decades later Searle continued to defend his view that \"..the traditional metaphysical distinction between fact and value cannot be captured by the linguistic distinction between 'evaluative' and 'descriptive' because all such speech act notions are already normative.\"\n\nThird, Searle argues that much of rational deliberation involves adjusting our (often inconsistent) patterns of desires to decide between outcomes, not the other way around. While in the Classical Model, one would start from a desire to go to Paris greater than that of saving money and calculate the cheapest way to get there, in reality people balance the niceness of Paris against the costs of travel to decide which desire (visiting Paris or saving money) they value more. Hence, he believes rationality is not a system of rules, but more of an adverb. We see certain behavior as rational, no matter what its source, and our system of rules derives from finding patterns in what we see as rational.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Lipsius wrote a series of works designed to revive ancient Stoicism in a form that would be compatible with Christianity. The most famous of these is \"De Constantia\" (\"On Constancy\"). His form of Stoicism influenced a number of contemporary thinkers, creating the intellectual movement of Neostoicism. He taught at the universities in Jena, Leiden and Leuven.\n\nLipsius was born in Overijse, Brabant (in modern Belgium). His parents sent him early to the Jesuit college in Cologne, but they feared that he might become a member of the Society of Jesus, so when he was sixteen they removed him to the University of Louvain in Leuven.\n\nThe publication of his \"Variarum Lectionum Libri Tres\" (1567), which he dedicated to Cardinal Granvelle, earned him an appointment as a Latin secretary, and a visit to Rome in the retinue of the cardinal. Here Lipsius remained for two years, devoting his spare time to the study of the Latin classics, collecting inscriptions and examining manuscripts in the Vatican. After he returned from Rome, he published a second volume of miscellaneous criticism (\"Antiquarum Lectionum Libri Quinque\", 1575); compared with the \"Variae Lectiones\" of eight years earlier, it shows that he had advanced from the notion of purely conjectural emendation to that of emending by collation.\n\nIn 1570 he travelled through Burgundy, Germany, Austria, and Bohemia, where the University of Jena engaged him as a teacher for more than a year, a position which implied conformity to the Lutheran Church. On his way back to Leuven, he stopped some time in Cologne, where he must have comported himself as a Catholic.\n\nHe then returned to Leuven, but the Eighty Years' War soon drove him to take refuge via Antwerp to the Northern Netherlands, where, in 1579, the newly founded University of Leiden appointed him professor of history. He held the position of rector of the university for four terms and was a driving force behind the growth and innovation in the early years.\n\nThe eleven years that Lipsius spent in Leiden were the period of his greatest productivity. It was during this time that he prepared his Seneca, and perfected, in successive editions, his Tacitus, and brought out a series of other works. Some were pure scholarship, some were collections from classical authors, and others were of general interest. One of this latter class was a treatise on politics (\"Politicorum Libri Sex\", 1589), in which he showed that, though a public teacher in a country which professed toleration, he had not departed from the state maxims of Alva and Philip II. He wrote that a government should recognize only one religion, and extirpate dissent by fire and sword. This avowal exposed him to attacks, but the prudent authorities of Leiden saved him, by prevailing upon him to publish a declaration that his expression \"Ure, seca\" (\"Burn and carve\") was a metaphor for a vigorous treatment.\n\nIn the spring of 1590, leaving Leiden under pretext of taking the waters in Spa, he went to Mainz, where he reconciled with the Roman Catholic Church. This event deeply interested the Catholic world, and invitations from the courts and universities of Italy, Austria and Spain poured in on Lipsius. But he preferred to remain in his own country, and he finally settled in Leuven, as professor of Latin in the Collegium Buslidianum.\n\nHe was not expected to teach, and appointments as privy councillor and historiographer royal to King Philip II of Spain eked out his trifling stipend. He continued to publish dissertations as before, the chief being his \"De militia romana\" (1595) and his \"Lovanium\" (1605), intended as an introduction to a general history of Brabant.\n\nLipsius died in Leuven.\n\nThe former headquarters of the European Council (2004-2017) and the Council of the European Union (1995-2017), the Justus Lipsius building, bears his name, having been constructed over the site of \"Rue Juste Lipse\", which linked \"Rue Belliard\" to \"Rue de la Loi\" in the European Quarter of Brussels. The building is still used by both institutions for offices and low-level meetings and so \"Justus Lipsius\" features heavily in the EU-lexicon.\n\nIn 2006, he was selected to appear on the 10 euro Justus Lipsius Silver commemorative Coin, minted by Belgium. The reverse side of the coin shows his portrait together with the years of his life (1547–1606).\n\nThe German historian Gerhard Oestreich has argued that Lipsius's ideas about the ideal citizen, a man who acts according to reason, is answerable to himself, is in control of his emotions, and is ready to fight, had found wide acceptance in the turbulent times of the Reformation. The Lipsian view, translated to politics, would have been at the basis of rationalisation of the state and its apparatus of government, autocratic rule by the prince, discipline dispensed to subjects, and strong military defence. The principles would have laid the foundation for military revolution that transformed first European warfare and then the internal organisation of the European states themselves. These conclusions of Oestreich have met with some scepticism in the academic community, and the notion that Lipsius' political ideas had a decisive influence on political developments and military reforms in the Dutch Republic has been challenged.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1180592", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1180592", "title": "Lectures on the Philosophy of History", "text": "Lectures on the Philosophy of History\n\nLectures on the Philosophy of History, also translated as Lectures on the Philosophy of World History (LPH; , VPW), is a major work by Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770–1831), originally given as lectures at the University of Berlin in 1822, 1828, and 1830. It presents world history in terms of the Hegelian philosophy in order to show that history follows the dictates of reason and that the natural progress of history is due to the outworking of absolute spirit.\n\nThe text was originally published in 1837 by the editor Eduard Gans, six years after Hegel's death, utilizing Hegel's own lecture notes as well as those found that were written by his students. A second German edition was compiled by Hegel's son, Karl, in 1840. A third German edition, edited by Georg Lasson, was published in 1917.\n\nHegel begins by distinguishing three methods or modes of doing history: Original History, Reflective History and Philosophical History.\n\nOriginal history is like that of Herodotus and Thucydides, these are almost contemporaneous writings limited to deeds, events and states of society which they had before their very eyes and whose culture they shared.\n\nReflective history is written at some temporal distance from the events or history considered. However, for Hegel, this form of history has a tendency to impose the cultural prejudices and ideas of the historians' era upon the past history over which the historian reflects.\n\nPhilosophical history for Hegel, is the true way. Hegel maintains that with philosophical history the historian must bracket his own preconceptions and go and find the overall sense and the driving ideas out of the very matter of the history considered.\n\nHegel's lectures on the philosophy of world history are often used to introduce students to Hegel's philosophy, in part because Hegel's sometimes difficult style is muted in the lectures, and he discourses on accessible themes such as world events in order to explain his philosophy. Much of the work is spent defining and characterizing \"Geist\" or spirit. The \"Geist\" is similar to the culture of people, and is constantly reworking itself to keep up with the changes of society, while at the same time working to produce those changes through what Hegel called the \"cunning of reason\" (\"List der Vernunft\"). In the lectures, Hegel claims that cultural awareness of \"Geist\" originated in ancient Judaism; he thus ties his history of \"Geist\" to a narrative of disenchantment and a decline in pagan polytheism. Another important theme of the text is the focus on world history, rather than regional or state history. Thinkers such as Johann Gottfried Herder (1744–1803) and Johann Gottlieb Fichte (1762–1814) had written on the concept and importance of world history and nationalism, and Hegel's philosophy continues this trend, while breaking away from an emphasis on nationalism and striving rather to grasp the full sweep of human cultural and intellectual history as a manifestation of spirit.\n\nHegel explicitly presents his lectures on the philosophy of history as a theodicy, or a reconciliation of divine providence with the evils of history. This leads Hegel to consider the events of history in terms of universal reason: \"That world history is governed by an ultimate design, that it is a rational process... this is a proposition whose truth we must assume; its proof lies in the study of world history itself, which is the image and enactment of reason.\" The ultimate design of the world is such that absolute spirit, here understood as God, comes to know itself and fully become itself in and through the triumphs and tragedies of history. Hegel is clear that history does not produce happiness - \"history is not the soil in which happiness grows. The periods of happiness in it are the blank pages of history\"; \"History as the slaughter-bench\" (\"Geschichte Als Schlachtbank\") - and yet the aims of reason are accomplished. Hegel writes: \"we must first of all know what the ultimate design of the world really is, and secondly, we must see that this design has been realized and that evil has not been able to maintain a position of equality beside it.\" To see the reason in history is to be able to account for the evil within it. He argued against the 'professional historians' of the day such as Ranke. Hegel points out that the understanding and consequently writing of history always relies on a framework. Hegel chose to openly admit and explain his framework rather than hide it as many historians choose to do.\n\nAccording to Hegel, \"World history... represents the development of the spirit's consciousness of its own freedom and of the consequent realization of this freedom.\". This realization is seen by studying the various cultures that have developed over the millennia, and trying to understand the way that freedom has worked itself out through them. Hegel's account of history begins with ancient cultures as he understood them. His account of the civilizations relied upon 19th century European scholarship, and contains an unavoidable Eurocentric bias. At the same time, the developmental nature of Hegel's philosophy meant that rather than simply deprecating ancient civilizations and non-European cultures, he saw them as necessary (if incomplete or underdeveloped) steps in the outworking of absolute spirit. Hegel's lectures on the philosophy of history contain one of his most well-known and controversial claims about the notion of freedom:\n\nWorld history is the record of the spirit's efforts to attain knowledge of what it is in itself. The Orientals do not know that the spirit or man as such are free in themselves. And because they do not know that, they are not themselves free. They only know that One is free... The consciousness of freedom first awoke among the Greeks, and they were accordingly free; but, like the Romans, they only knew that Some, and not all men as such, are free... The Germanic nations, with the rise of Christianity, were the first to realize that All men are by nature free, and that freedom of spirit is his very essence.\nIn other words, Hegel maintains that the consciousness of freedom in history moves from despotism, to a sense that freedom is a privilege of a few, to a robust notion that humanity is free in and of itself. Hegel believes that the spirit of human freedom is best nurtured within a constitutional monarchy in which the monarch embodies the spirit and desires of the governed, and his reading of history locates the rise of such forms of government in the Germanic nations of, for example, the United Kingdom and Prussia after the Protestant Reformation. Hegel's \"one, some, and all\" proposition follows the basic geographical metaphor Hegel takes throughout his philosophy of history, namely, \"World history travels from east to west; for Europe is the absolute end of history, just as Asia is the beginning.\" When referring to the east, Hegel generally has in mind the historical cultures of Persia, though at times he does reference China and spends a great deal of space discussing India and Indian religions. \nHowever he also said that the view of history (including his own) should be open to change based on the 'empirical facts' available.\n\nBecause of the nature of the text (collections of edited lecture notes), critical editions were slow in forthcoming. The standard German edition for many years was the manuscript of Hegel's son Karl Hegel, published in 1840. The German edition produced by Eva Moldenhauer and Karl Michel (1986) essentially follows Karl Hegel's edition. The only critical edition in German of the text of the lectures is Georg Lasson's 4 vol. edition (1917–1920). This edition was published repeatedly (last in two volumes in 1980) by Felix Meiner Verlag, Hamburg. The long introduction was re-edited on the basis of Lasson's publication in 1955, by Johannes Hoffmeister.\n\nNo full English translation of the complete lectures has ever been produced. The first English translation was made from Karl Hegel's edition, which lacked much material discovered later. This translation, made by John Sibree (1857), is still the only English version which contains not only the Introduction, but the shorter body of the lectures according to Karl Hegel's 1840 manuscript. Though it is incomplete, this translation is often used by English speaking scholars and is prevalent in university classrooms in the English-speaking world.\n\nAn English translation of the Introduction to the lectures was produced by Robert S. Hartman (1953) which included an introduction and additional editorial footnotes. Hartman produced this translation before Hoffmeister's critical edition was published, and it is quite short, only 95 pages.\n\nAn English translation of Hoffmeister's critical edition of the Introduction was produced in 1974 by H. B. Nisbet. This edition presents the full text of the Introduction to Karl Hegel manuscript, as well as all later additions included in the Hoffmeister edition of the Introduction. As such, it is the only critical edition of any portion of the lectures available in English. No translation of the full edition of the lectures following Lasson has yet been produced.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "612650", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=612650", "title": "Luce Irigaray", "text": "Luce Irigaray\n\nLuce Irigaray (; ; born 3 May 1930) is a Belgian-born French feminist, philosopher, linguist, psycholinguist, psychoanalyst and cultural theorist. She is best known for her works \"Speculum of the Other Woman\" (1974) and \"This Sex Which Is Not One\" (1977). Presently, she is active in the Women's Movements in both France and Italy.\n\nLuce Irigaray received a bachelor's degree from the University of Louvain in 1954 and a master's degree from the same university in 1956 and taught at a high school in Brussels from 1956 to 1959.\n\nIn 1960 she moved to Paris to pursue a master's degree in Psychology from the University of Paris, which she earned in 1961, she also received a specialist diploma in Psychopathology from the school in 1962. In 1968, she received a doctorate in Linguistics from Paris X Nanterre. Her thesis was titled \"Approche psycholinguistique du langage des déments\".\n\nShe completed a PhD in Linguistics in 1968 from the University of Vincennes in Saint-Denis (University of Paris VIII). Her dissertation on speech patterns of subjects suffering from dementia became her first book, \"Le langage des déments\", published in 1973. In 1974, she earned a second PhD in Philosophy.\n\nIn the 1960s, Irigaray started attending the psychoanalytic seminars of Jacques Lacan and joined the École Freudienne de Paris (Freudian School of Paris), directed by Lacan. She was expelled from this school in 1974 after the publication of her second doctoral thesis (doctorat d'État), \"Speculum of the Other Woman\" (\"Speculum: La fonction de la femme dans le discours philosophique\", later retitled as \"Speculum: De l'autre femme\"), which received much criticism from both the Lacanian and Freudian schools of psychoanalysis. This criticism brought her recognition. But she was removed from her position as an instructor at the University of Vincennes as well as ostracized from the Lacanian community.\n\nShe held a research post at the Centre national de la recherche scientifique since 1964, where she is now a Director of Research in Philosophy. Her initial research focused on dementia patients, about whom she produced a study of the differences between the language of male and female patients.\n\nNoted also is that in her writings, Irigaray has stated a concern that an interest in her biography would affect the interpretation of her ideas as the entrance of women into intellectual discussions has often also included the challenging of women's point of view based on biographical material. Her most extensive autobiographical statements thus far are gathered in Through Vegetal Being (co-authored with Michael Marder). Overall, she maintains the belief that biographical details pertaining to her personal life hold the possibility to be used against her within the male dominated educational establishment as a tool to discredit her work.\n\nHer first major book \"Speculum of the Other Woman,\" based on her second dissertation, was published in 1974, In \"Speculum,\" Irigaray engages in close analyses of phallocentrism in Western philosophy and psychoanalytic theory, analyzing texts by Freud, Hegel, Plato, Aristotle, Descartes, and Kant. The book's most cited essay, \"The Blind Spot of an Old Dream,\" critiques Freud's lecture on femininity.\n\nIn 1977, Irigaray published \"This Sex Which is Not One\" (\"Ce sexe qui n'en est pas un\") which was subsequently translated into English with that title and published in 1985, along with \"Speculum\". In addition to more commentary on psychoanalysis, including discussions of Lacan's work, \"This Sex Which is Not One\" also comments on political economy, drawing on structuralist writers such as Lévi-Strauss. For example, Irigaray argues that the phallic economy places women alongside signs and currency, since all forms of exchange are conducted exclusively between men. (See the essay \"Women on the Market\", which is Chapter Eight of \"This Sex Which Is Not One\".)\n\nIrigaray draws upon Karl Marx’s theory of capital and commodities to claim that women are exchanged between men in the same way as any other commodity is. She argues that our entire society is predicated on this exchange of women. Her exchange value is determined by society, while her use value is her natural qualities. Thus, a woman’s self is divided between her use and exchange values, and she is only desired for the exchange value. This system creates three types of women: the mother, who is all use value; the virgin, who is all exchange value; and the prostitute, who embodies both use and exchange value.\n\nWithin the same essay, \"Women on the Market,\" Irigaray uses additional Marxist foundations to argue that women are in demand due to their perceived shortage and as a result, males seek \"to have them all,\" or seek a surplus like the excess of commodity buying power, capital, that capitalists seek constantly.\n\nIrigaray speculates thus that perhaps, \"the way women are used matter less than their number.\" In this further analogy of women \"on the market,\" understood through Marxist terms, Irigaray points out that women, like commodities, are moved between men based on their exchange value rather than just their use value, and the desire will always be surplus – making women almost seem like capital, in this case, to be accumulated. \"As commodities, women are thus two things at once: utilitarian objects and bearers of value.\"\n\nSome of Irigaray's books are imaginary dialogues with significant contributors to Western philosophy, such as Nietzsche and Heidegger. However Irigaray also writes a significant body of work on Hegel, Descartes, Plato, Aristotle and Levinas, as well as Merleau-Ponty. She continued to conduct empirical studies about language in a variety of settings, researching the differences between the way men and women speak. This focus on sexual difference is the key characteristic of Irigaray's oeuvre, since she is seeking to provide a site from which a feminine language can eventuate.\n\nMany feminists criticize the perceived essentialist positions of Luce Irigaray. However, there is much debate among scholars as to whether or not Irigaray's theory of sexual difference is, indeed, an essentialist one. The perception that Luce Irigaray's work is essentialist concentrates on her attention to sexual difference, taking this to constitute a rehearsal of heteronormative sexuality. As Helen Fielding states, the uneasiness among feminists about Irigaray’s discussion of masculinity and femininity does not so much reveal Irigaray’s heteronormative bias, but \"arises out of an inherited cultural understanding [on the part of her critics] that posits nature as either unchanging organism or as matter that can be ordered, manipulated and inscribed upon. Hence the concern over essentialism is itself grounded in the binary thinking that preserves a hierarchy of...culture over nature.\"\nW. A. Borody has criticised Luce Irigaray's phallogocentric argument as misrepresenting the history of philosophies of \"indeterminateness\" in the West. Luce Irigaray's \"black and white\" claims that the masculine=determinateness and that the feminine=indeterminateness contain a degree of cultural and historical validity, but not when it is deployed to self-replicate a similar form of the gender-othering it originally sought to overcome.\n\nAlan Sokal and Jean Bricmont, in their book critiquing postmodern thought (\"Fashionable Nonsense\", 1997), criticize Luce Irigaray on several grounds. They say she regards E=mc as a \"sexed equation\" because of their interpretation of her response to a question on the subject, for instance when she says \"Is E=Mc a sexed equation? Perhaps it is. Let us make the hypothesis that it is insofar as it privileges the speed of light over other speeds that are vitally necessary to us. What seems to me to indicate the possible sexed nature of the equation is not directly its uses by nuclear weapons, rather it is having privileged what goes the fastest.\" They also take issue with the assertion that fluid mechanics is unfairly neglected because it deals with \"feminine\" fluids in contrast to \"masculine\" rigid mechanics. In a review of Sokal and Bricmont's book, Richard Dawkins wrote that, \"You don't have to be a physicist to smell out the daffy absurdity of this kind of argument (...), but it helps to have Sokal and Bricmont on hand to tell us the real reason why turbulent flow is a hard problem (the Navier–Stokes equations are difficult to solve).\"\n\n\n"}

Scientists explain phenomena by describing mechanisms that could produce the phenomena. For example, natural selection is a mechanism of biological evolution; other mechanisms of evolution include genetic drift, mutation, and gene flow. In ecology, mechanisms such as predation and host-parasite interactions produce change in ecological systems. In practice, no description of a mechanism is ever complete because not all details of the parts and processes of a mechanism are fully known. For example, natural selection is a mechanism of evolution that includes countless, inter-individual interactions with other individuals, components, and processes of the environment in which natural selection operates.\n\nMany characterizations/definitions of mechanisms in the philosophy of science/biology have been provided in the past decades. For example, one influential characterization of neuro- and molecular biological mechanisms is as follows: mechanisms are entities and activities organized such that they are productive of regular changes from start to termination conditions (Peter Machamer, Lindley Darden, & Carl Craver 2000; 'MDC' hereafter). Other characterizations have been proposed by Stuart Glennan (1996, 2002), who articulates an interactionist account of mechanisms, and William Bechtel (1993, 2006), who emphasizes parts and operations (cf. MDC).\n\nThe MDC characterization is as follows: mechanisms are entities and activities organized such that they are productive of changes from start conditions to termination conditions. There are three distinguishable aspects of this characterization:\n\n\n\n\nMechanisms in science/biology have reappeared as a subject of philosophical analysis and discussion in the last several decades because of a variety of factors, many of which relate to metascientific issues such as explanation and causation. For example, the decline of Covering Law (CL) models of explanation, e.g., Hempel's deductive-nomological model, has stimulated interest how mechanisms might play an explanatory role in certain domains of science, especially higher-level disciplines such as biology (i.e., neurobiology, molecular biology, neuroscience, and so on). This is not just because of the philosophical problem of giving some account of what \"laws of nature,\" which CL models encounter, but also the incontrovertible fact that most biological phenomena are not characterizable in nomological terms (i.e., in terms of lawful relationships). For example, protein biosynthesis does not occur according to any law, and therefore, on the DN model, no explanation for the biosynthesis phenomenon could be given.\n\nMechanistic explanations come in many forms. Wesley Salmon proposed what he called the \"ontic\" conception of explanation, which states that explanations are mechanisms and causal processes \"in the world\". There are two such kinds of explanation: \"etiological\" and \"constitutive\". Salmon focused primarily on etiological explanation, with respect to which one explains some phenomenon \"P\" by identifying its causes (and, thus, locating it within the causal structure of the world). Constitutive (or componential) explanation, on the other hand, involves describing the components of a mechanism \"M\" that is productive of (or causes) \"P.\" Indeed, whereas (a) Noam Chomsky differentiates between descriptive and explanatory adequacy, where the former is defined as the adequacy of a theory to account for at least all the items in the domain (which need explaining), and the latter as the adequacy of a theory to account for no more than those domain items, and (b) past philosophies of science differentiate between descriptions of phenomena and explanations of those phenomena, in the non-ontic context of mechanism literature, descriptions and explanations seem to be identical. This is to say, to explain a mechanism \"M\" is to describe it (specify its components, as well as background, enabling, and so on, conditions that constitute, in the case of a linear mechanism, its \"start conditions\").\n\n"}

He remained active in the management of his parish, but also worked as a high-school teacher and was a prominent figure in the circles of Catholic Action. He was a youth pastor in the church of The Most Holy Saviour in 1950. He was arrested in May 1951 and sentenced to life imprisonment for alleged espionage for the Vatican and organization of illegal religious activity, in a miscarriage of justice.\n\nAfter release on probation in 1966, he worked in various blue-collar jobs. He returned briefly in 1968 to the Charles University School of Theology and was fully rehabilitated in 1970 (his rehabilitation was cancelled in 1975, and renewed in 1990). He was sent away to a parish in the border areas in 1970 (Dolní Žandov near Cheb), and he returned to Prague only as a pensioner in 1978.\n\nHowever, he did not retire from his theological work, and was one of the main organizers of the Catholic samizdat. He continued in his collaboration with exiles, maintained relationships with foreign visitors, and participated in the preparation of secretly ordained priests and in the organization of theological colloquia at home. He was one of the main advisers to František Tomášek (from 1968), writing a couple of fundamental texts for him, which Tomášek published under his name.\n\nMádr published the journal \"Theological Texts\" () from 1978, first as samizdat, then after the Velvet Revolution as a normal revue. He published tens of books in samizdat, mainly translations.\n\nHe returned to the Charles University School of Theology with his friend Josef Zvěřina in 1990, but after Zvěřina's death the same year he was again removed, returning permanently only after a change in the leadership of the school in 2002. He received an honorary degree in 1991 from the University of Bonn and was awarded the Order of Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk III. class in 1997. He was a canon of the Vyšehrad chapter from 1999.\n\nAside from hundreds of articles, reviews and specialized essays in journals and compilations in the Czech Republic as well as abroad, he published these books:\n\n\n"}

His father, Juan Ciriaco Murillo, was from one of its elite families, whereas his mother Mary Ascencia Carasco was of native pedigree. Juan Ciriaco had been training for priesthood in the catholic church, becoming a priest soon after Pedro's birth. Juan took charge of his education. It is thought Pedro may have attended the Colegio Seminario de San Carlos, in La Paz. At the St Francis Xavier University of Chuquisaca (later renamed Sucre), Pedro then studied law, but left before completing. By age 21, he had married Olmedo Manuel de la Concha in Potosí, the high-altitude silver mining city at the foot of \"Cerro de Potosí.\" Within 3 years the family, with at least two children, had moved to Irupana.\n\nFrom the earliest colonial days, the control of upper Peru by the Spanish crown had been firm. Late 1780 saw the Rebellion of Túpac Amaru II. In helping to vanquish this Murillo distinguished himself, and was appointed Lieutenant of the Militia.\n\nWithin 5 years, Juan Ciriaco Murillo had died, leaving most of his fortune to Pedro's children. His paternal aunt, Catalina Felipe, filed a lawsuit disputing this. At first, this was defeated. However, in papers submitted to court, Murillo falsely claimed a degree in law.\n\nThis deception had been achieved with some cunning. First, Pedro abused the goodwill of a rector at St Francis Xavier University of Chuquisaca. The date set to take the examination is known only to the Attorney General of the colonial government, Real Audiencia. Murillo claimed his submission had been via the Notary Sebastian del Toro, who worked regularly for members of the Real Audiencia. The certificate had been submitted days ago, the day \"forgotten.\" Though with no certificate, Murillo asserted he had performed brilliantly in the examination, and had obtained his law degree. A year later in La Paz, Murillo was denounced as having forged his licence to practice law. Challenged by Judge Sebastian Segurola, a friend, to present the original certificate, Murillo simply disappeared. A search at his home revealed documents falsified in Murillo's handwriting. Forged by him had been the signatures of as many as four notaries, as they each subsequently attested.\n\nIn the case against his aunt, the truth surfaced. Murillo not only lost the case, but his falsely attested profession had also been in contempt of court. He had to flee the authorities. Pardoned by early 1789, he tried his hand in mining.\n\nConcern arose throughout Spanish South America when French forces back in Spain, led by Bonaparte, forced the fall of Ferdinand VII; what seemed the usurping of the Spanish crown by Napoleon's brother Joseph. Memories also smoldered of the violent suppression 30 years earlier of grievances from indigenous communities in upper Peru. In 1805, Murillo was part of a group conspiring against the Spanish government, but was discovered and brought to trial.\n\nUpper Peru regional government in Chuquisaca, the Real Audiencia of Charcas, became uneasy about the loyalties of the local governor. Supported by the faculty of the St Francis Xavier University of Chuquisaca, they deposed him and formed a junta on 25 May 1809. With the King impeded from reigning, logic suggested the Indies should govern themselves. A self-determination movement kicked off with the incessant ringing of the bell of the St Francis Xavier Basilica in Chuquisaca (nowadays Sucre). Meanwhile, Murillo was plotting back in La Paz, leading outright rebellion 16 July. At a self-appointed Junta Tuitiva (\"protecting junta\") there a few days later, Murillo demanded nothing less than the secession of upper Peru from the Spanish Empire. He is said to have claimed the revolution was 'igniting a lamp that nobody would be able to extinguish'. This touches on an unresolved point (see historiography at Chuquisaca Revolution). By some in Bolivia (but not in Ecuador) the moment is claimed as the spark that lit the Liberation of South America from Spain (\"Primer grito libertario\").\n\nTo suppress what had become a serious insurrection, royalist troops were despatched, some from the Viceroyalty of Peru and others from Buenos Aires. Though some regiments comprising natives refused to intervene against an avowedly patriotic movement, the uprising was repressed. Murillo had to flee, but was captured. He was hanged, along with others, on 29 January 1810, where he made the following statement:\n\nEvery 16 July in La Paz, the local populace honours what are regarded as patriotic deeds of 1809. A regional celebration begins when the various national and local authorities collaborate to light the Torch of Liberty at what is dubbed the house of the martyr. There follows a parade through central La Paz. Their own torches symbolising the one Murillo claimed to have ignited, citizens form the \"Parade of Torches.\"\n"}

After graduating from Vanderbilt University, Hackney earned his Ph.D. in American History at Yale University, where he worked with eminent Southern historian C. Vann Woodward. He subsequently served in the Navy for five years.\n\nHackney began his career as a lecturer in history at Princeton University. There, he taught in an Upward Bound program for disadvantaged students and played a role in the creation of the university's African American Studies program. While at Princeton, he moved into administration, serving as the provost from 1972 to 1975. \n\nFrom 1975 to 1980, Hackney was the president of Tulane University. At Tulane, Hackney was best known for approving the November 1979 decision to tear down Tulane Stadium, the on-campus home of the Green Wave football team from 1926 through 1974. The Wave moved to the Louisiana Superdome upon its completion in August 1975. Tulane Stadium stood vacant for nearly five years after Tulane and the NFL's New Orleans Saints played their final games there, hosting high school football games and an ill-fated ZZ Top concert in 1976.\n\nHackney was president of the University of Pennsylvania from 1981 to 1993. He was also the Chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) from 1993 to 1997, appointed by President Clinton. His defining initiative in the job was his first: \"A National Conversation on American Pluralism and Identity,\" a project that helped finance and shape about 1,400 public meetings from 1994 to 1997.\n\nHackney specialized in the history of the American South since the Civil War. He had in an interest in American utopias and other social movements with an emphasis on the Civil Rights Movement and the 1960s.

Towards the end of his tenure, there was the so-called Water buffalo incident, a controversial affair involving a student charged with racial harassment that raised issues involving free speech and university judicial procedures nationally. In particular, Hackney's role in the incident was a subject of his 1993 Senate confirmation hearings for the NEH appointment. Hackney's memoir about the turmoil of his confirmation, \"The Politics of Presidential Appointment: A Memoir of the Culture War\" , was published in 2002. During his confirmation, critics derided him as the \"pope of political correctness.\" \"I resent bitterly being slandered by slogan\", Dr. Hackney told the Senate committee. \"I am not just a cardboard figure. I am someone who has spent years defending free speech, and I will do that at NEH as well.\" He was confirmed, 76 to 23, and assumed the job previously held by Lynne Cheney.\n\nHackney was the son-in-law of Virginia and Clifford Durr.\n\nHackney died at Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts in 2013, aged 79.

{"id": "614337", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=614337", "title": "Summum", "text": "Summum\n\nSummum is a religion and philosophy that began in 1975 as a result of American citizen Claude \"Corky\" Nowell's claimed encounter with beings he described as \"Summa Individuals\". According to Nowell, these beings presented him with concepts regarding the nature of creation, concepts that have always existed and are continually re-introduced to humankind by advanced beings who work along the pathways of creation. As a result of his experience, Nowell founded Summum in order to share the \"gift\" he received with others.\nIn 1980, as a reflection of his newfound path, he changed his name to Summum Bonum Amon Ra,\nbut news stories indicate he went by Corky Ra.\nSummum religious practices draw upon both Ancient Egyptian religion and the Hebrew prophet Moses.\n\nSummum's philosophy stems from what it considers to be principles of nature that cannot be attributed to any person.\nThese principles flower in different forms and were outlined before in the writings of \"The Kybalion\" first published in 1908.\nBut Summum, considering \"The Kybalion\" incomplete and antiquated, rewrote the book after it entered the public domain.\nThe new derivative work utilized a more modern language and incorporated the new information said to have been presented by Ra to the Summa Individuals. Included in that information is an explanation and description of how creation came about. The rewrite resulted in a book published by Summum entitled \"SUMMUM: Sealed Except to the Open Mind\", and it provides an outline of the group's philosophy. The basis of the philosophy is the \"Grand Principle of Creation\" that states, \"Nothing and Possibility come in and out of bond infinite times in a finite moment\". The principle of creation generates the totality of existence which the Summum philosophy refers to as \"SUMMUM\", and from this master principle emanate \"Seven Summum Principles\" known as Psychokinesis, Correspondence, Vibration, Opposition, Rhythm, Cause and Effect, and Gender.\n\nSummum states that its teachings are the same as the teachings of Gnostic Christianity and maintains that knowledge does not come from things such as the intellect or obedience or faith, but from revelatory experience.\nSummum teaches the \"Systematic Law of Learning\" which explains that knowledge is attained through questioning and experience.\nAccording to Summum, devotion and spiritual practice leads to revelatory experience, and that was the basis of the authentic teachings of Jesus.\n\nThe word \"summum\" is Latin and is the neuter form of \"summus\" which means \"highest\".\n\nIn the context of the Summum philosophy, \"summum\" means \"the sum total of all creation\".\nSummum appears to distinguish between \"Summum\" and \"SUMMUM\" in that \"Summum\" is the name of an organization and philosophy while \"SUMMUM\" is a name given to the totality of existence.\n\nPractice of the religion involves meditation upon the aspect of creation that is within one's self. Summum believes that within all created things is an essence which is the spirit of the creator, and that the more one directs his or her attention to this indwelling spirit, the more one realizes its existence and moves along the lines of spiritual progression, developing \"spiritual Psychokinesis\". It appears that there is no recognized deity per se in the philosophy, but rather that people are all part of the mind of the universe and that the universe collectively constitutes something great and worthy of study and meditation.\n\nAccording to Summum, our mental states dictate our sense of harmony and disharmony, and the resulting experiences become part of our memories that then hold us captive.\n\nSummum produces \"Nectar Publications\", which are wines used in the meditation practices that Summum teaches. The nectars are made inside the Summum Pyramid, and according to Summum are imbued with resonations that contain spiritual concepts. Summum has made a number of different types of nectars, each containing its own \"message\". A small amount of nectar is consumed prior to meditation, and the alcohol is said to carry the resonations across the blood–brain barrier where they are released in the brain. Perception of the nectars' effects is said to depend upon the awareness of the person using them.\n\nGovernmental authorities consider the nectars to be wine and required that Summum obtain a winery license in order to make them. Summum is Utah's first federally bonded winery.\n\nSummum practices \"Modern Mummification\" and \"Transference\" as a means to guide one's essence to a greater destination following the death of the body.\nSummum is a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation sole that was granted a religious exemption from the IRS for its mummification service. The service is available to anyone for spiritual reasons and is also offered for pets. Summum does request and accept donations.\nThe process has been featured in programs produced by \"National Geographic\" and the British Broadcasting Corporation.\n\nThe first person to undergo the mummification process was Nowell himself, who died in January 2008. His body is encased inside a bronze mummiform casket that is covered in gold and stands inside the group's pyramid.\n\nAccording to its founder, over 250,000 people worldwide have \"received\" Summum instruction. As the organization does not keep formal membership records, this figure is based on the number of bottles of wine it has distributed.\n\nSummum contends that the principles and nature of creation are continuously re-introduced to humankind by evolved beings. The group holds that in one such case, Moses in the Old Testament was given both a \"lower\" and \"higher\" knowledge from a divine being. The lower knowledge was embodied in the more widely known Ten Commandments, while the higher was expressed in what Summum refers to as the \"Seven Aphorisms\".\nAccording to Summum, when Moses first descended from Mount Sinai, he had with him the higher law inscribed on stone tablets. However, the undeveloped condition of the Israelites prevented them from understanding. Moses returned to Mount Sinai and returned with another set of tablets containing the lower law that was much easier for the people to comprehend. The higher law was only shared with a few capable of understanding its meaning.\nThis appears to coincide with one of Summum's precepts that states, \"The voice of wisdom is silent, except to the OPEN MIND\", and in this aspect, Summum resembles an esoteric religious movement.\n\nAccording to the group, the \"Seven Aphorisms\" are:\n\nSummum followers have gained attention as of late in that they have proposed that their Seven Aphorisms be placed in public places alongside the Ten Commandments, specifically in several locations in Utah.\nChristians and town fathers have objected, claiming that the Ten Commandments are of great historic significance to the United States, and as such are not solely a religious statement, whereas the seven aphorisms are a modern philosophy. Summum has prevailed in other litigation where the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Summum was denied its right to free speech and governments had engaged in discrimination.\nThe governments in those cases elected to remove their Ten Commandments monument rather than allow Summum to erect its Seven Aphorisms monument. However, Pleasant Grove, Utah, was successful in getting the United States Supreme Court to hear their case. Their argument is that the acceptance of a monument is not an instance of a public forum where speakers may not be discriminated against, but rather a form of government speech that does not require neutral viewpoints.\n\nOn February 25, 2009, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously against Summum in the \"Pleasant Grove\" case. Justice Samuel Alito, in his opinion for the court, asserted that a municipality's acceptance and acquisition of a privately funded permanent monument erected in a public park while refusing to accept other privately funded permanent memorials is a valid expression of governmental speech, which is permissible and not an unconstitutional interference with the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech. According to Alito, \"the display of a permanent monument in a public park\" is perceived by an ordinary and reasonable observer to be an expression of values and ideas of the government, the owner of the park and the monument, even though the particular idea expressed by the monument is left to the interpretation of the individual observer. Alito made a clear distinction between forms of private speech in public parks, such as rallies and temporary holiday displays (Christmas trees and menorahs), and the government speech represented by permanent monuments. He opined that even long-winded speakers eventually go home with their leaflets and holiday displays are taken down; but permanent monuments endure and are obviously associated with their owners. Alito wrote, \"cities and other jurisdictions take some care in accepting donated monuments.\" While Summum and its supporters attempted to persuade the Court that preventing governments from selecting monuments on the basis of content would be tenable, Justice Alito noted that such a situation would put government in the position of having to choose between accepting permanent monuments with conflicting messages that do not represent the values and ideals of the community, and removing all monuments from public space. As described by Alito, if the law accorded with Summum and its supporters, New York would have been required to accept a Statue of Autocracy from the German Empire or Imperial Russia when it accepted the Statue of Liberty from France.\n\nIn a companion case, Summum requested a monument of its Seven Aphorisms be placed next to a Ten Commandments monument in Roy Park, a public park in the city of Duchesne, Utah. Following the Supreme Court's ruling in \"Pleasant Grove v. Summum\", Summum claimed the ruling opened the door for a new challenge based on church-state separation claims. Unlike Pleasant Grove, the Duchesne Ten Commandments monument was the only one in the park. Duchesne decided to move the monument to the city cemetery to avoid continuing litigation, citing counsel from their attorney who said the solitary monument would establish a religion for the city. As a result of the monument's removal from the city park, Summum's lawsuit became moot and was dismissed.\n\nThe Summum Pyramid is a sanctuary and temple used by the organization of Summum for instruction in the Summum philosophy. It is located in Salt Lake City, Utah, and was built during 1977 to 1979. The pyramid is 40 feet long at the base, 26 feet high, and is oriented towards true north of the Earth. The structure also incorporates the Divine Proportion, or Golden Ratio, in its design.\n\n"}

It is one of ten short stories in the collection \"Tsutsumi Chūnagon Monogatari\".\n\nThe protagonist befriends insects, names her attendants after them, and engages in poetic exchanges involving furry caterpillars, leading to laughter on the part of others. Portrayed as even more eccentric is her disregard for her physical appearance: she leaves her hair untrimmed; has unplucked eyebrows; neglects to blacken her teeth; and allows herself to be seen by men. 'Oh, how regrettable! Why does she have such a weird mind'. When an incipient love affair comes to an end along with the tale it is of little surprise to any of the observers.\n\nDonald Keene has suggested that, while the reader may be attracted by her independence of mind, the author was probably trying to satirize those with eccentric behaviour and unconventional tastes. Robert Backus argues that the modern reader may prefer her independence and naturalness to the \"excessive artificiality of the Heian conception of feminine beauty\". He also draws parallels with the vernacular setsuwa tradition and anecdotes told of Fujiwara Munesuke (1077–1162), the 'Bee-Keeping Minister', who gave his favourites names such as \"Long Legs\", \"Short Horns\", and \"Speckled Wings\".

It was later included in the collection, \"The Will to Believe and other Essays in Popular Philosophy.\" \n\nHe drew a distinction between three questions in ethics: psychological, metaphysical, casuistic. \n\n\"The psychological question asks after the historical origin of our moral ideas and judgments; the metaphysical question asks what the very meaning of the words 'good,' 'ill,' and 'obligation' are; the casuistic question asks what is the measure of the various goods and ills which men recognize, so that the philosopher may settle the true order of human obligations.\"\n\nAs James sees it, the psychological question is whether human ideas of good and evil arise from \"the association of [certain ideals] with act of simple bodily pleasures and reliefs from pain.\" He believes that some elements of our moral sentiment do have such a source, and that Jeremy Bentham and his followers have done the world a lasting service by pointing that out. \n\nBut he doesn't believe that association and pleasure/pain calculus are adequate to account for the psychology of morality. One must also admit innate, brain-born ideas or tendencies.\n\nIn a famous passage that recalls some of Dostoyevsky's work, James wrote that \"if the hypothesis were offered of a world in which Messrs Fourier's and Bellamy's and Morris' utopias should all be outdone, and millions kept permanently happy on the one simple condition that a certain lost soul on the far-off edge of things should lead a life of lonely torture,\" most people would feel that the enjoyment of such a utopia would be a \"hideous thing\" at such a cost. That feeling, he infers, must be brain born. The passage was the inspiration for Ursula K. Le Guin's short story \"The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas (Variations on a theme by William James)\".\n\nThe gist of this section is the contention that to be good, something has to be desired, by some sentient being. \n\nA world of only rocks would have no good or bad. A world with one thinking being in it would have plenty of good and bad—some things would work out as that being wanted them, others wouldn't. It could even have moral conflict of a sort, as that one thinker may have trouble rendering his own ideals consistent with one another. \n\nFrom such considerations, James concludes that \"claim\" and \"obligation\" are two sides of the same coin. Without a claim actually made by some concrete person there can be no obligation, but there is obligation wherever there is a claim.\n\nBut this resolution of the metaphysical question only makes the casuistic question (settling the true order of human obligations) seem hopelessly difficult. If everything that anyone could want of me, or that I could want from myself, be considered an obligation, then my obligations are hopelessly in conflict with one another. \n\n\"The various ideals [operating in the world] have no common character apart from the fact that they are ideals. No single abstract principle can be so used as to yield to the philosopher anything like a scientifically accurate and genuinely useful casuistic scale.\" How, then, shall I make choices? how shall I live?\n\nJames' answer is that history is resolving this problem for us, and our task is to co-operate in the process by which it does so, by which apparently irreconciliable demands are reconciled over time. One might say, although the terminology would be foreign to him, that he found his ethics within a pluralist meta-ethics.\n\nJames, William: \"The Moral Philosopher and the Moral Life\" -- \"International Journal of Ethics\", volume 1, number 3 (April 1891), pp. 330–354 (Available via JSTOR)\n\nThe essay was also featured in:\n\n"}

Competing paradigms are frequently incommensurable; that is, they are competing and irreconcilable accounts of reality. Thus, our comprehension of science can never rely wholly upon \"objectivity\" alone. Science must account for subjective perspectives as well, since all objective conclusions are ultimately founded upon the subjective conditioning/worldview of its researchers and participants.\n\nKuhn was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, to Samuel L. Kuhn, an industrial engineer, and Minette Stroock Kuhn, both Jewish. He graduated from The Taft School in Watertown, CT, in 1940, where he became aware of his serious interest in mathematics and physics. He obtained his BS degree in physics from Harvard University in 1943, where he also obtained MS and PhD degrees in physics in 1946 and 1949, respectively, under the supervision of John Van Vleck. As he states in the first few pages of the preface to the second edition of \"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\", his three years of total academic freedom as a Harvard Junior Fellow were crucial in allowing him to switch from physics to the history and philosophy of science. He later taught a course in the history of science at Harvard from 1948 until 1956, at the suggestion of university president James Conant. After leaving Harvard, Kuhn taught at the University of California, Berkeley, in both the philosophy department and the history department, being named Professor of the History of science in 1961. Kuhn interviewed and tape recorded Danish physicist Niels Bohr the day before Bohr's death. At Berkeley, he wrote and published (in 1962) his best known and most influential work: \"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\". In 1964, he joined Princeton University as the M. Taylor Pyne Professor of Philosophy and History of Science. He served as the president of the History of Science Society from 1969–70. In 1979 he joined the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) as the Laurance S. Rockefeller Professor of Philosophy, remaining there until 1991. In 1994 Kuhn was diagnosed with lung cancer. He died in 1996.\n\nThomas Kuhn was married twice, first to Kathryn Muhs with whom he had three children, then to Jehane Barton Burns (Jehane R. Kuhn).\n\n\"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\" (\"SSR\") was originally printed as an article in the \"International Encyclopedia of Unified Science\", published by the logical positivists of the Vienna Circle. In this book, Kuhn argued that science does not progress via a linear accumulation of new knowledge, but undergoes periodic revolutions, also called \"paradigm shifts\" (although he did not coin the phrase), in which the nature of scientific inquiry within a particular field is abruptly transformed. In general, science is broken up into three distinct stages. Prescience, which lacks a central paradigm, comes first. This is followed by \"normal science\", when scientists attempt to enlarge the central paradigm by \"puzzle-solving\". Guided by the paradigm, normal science is extremely productive: \"when the paradigm is successful, the profession will have solved problems that its members could scarcely have imagined and would never have undertaken without commitment to the paradigm\".\n\nIn regard to experimentation and collection of data with a view toward solving problems through the commitment to a paradigm, Kuhn states: \"The operations and measurements that a scientist undertakes in the laboratory are not 'the given' of experience but rather 'the collected with diffculty.' They are not what the scientist sees—at least not before his research is well advanced and his attention focused. Rather, they are concrete indices to the content of more elementary perceptions, and as such they are selected for the close scrutiny of normal research only because they promise opportunity for the fruitful elaboration of an accepted paradigm. Far more clearly than the immediate experience from which they in part derive, operations and measurements are paradigm-determined. Science does not deal in all possible laboratory manipulations. Instead, it selects those relevant to the juxtaposition of a paradigm with the immediate experience that that paradigm has partially determined. As a result, scientists with different paradigms engage in different concrete laboratory manipulations.\"\n\nDuring the period of normal science, the failure of a result to conform to the paradigm is seen not as refuting the paradigm, but as the mistake of the researcher, contra Popper's falsifiability criterion. As anomalous results build up, science reaches a \"crisis\", at which point a new paradigm, which subsumes the old results along with the anomalous results into one framework, is accepted. This is termed \"revolutionary science\".\n\nIn \"SSR\", Kuhn also argues that rival paradigms are incommensurable—that is, it is not possible to understand one paradigm through the conceptual framework and terminology of another rival paradigm. For many critics, for example David Stove (\"Popper and After\", 1982), this thesis seemed to entail that theory choice is fundamentally irrational: if rival theories cannot be directly compared, then one cannot make a rational choice as to which one is better. Whether Kuhn's views had such relativistic consequences is the subject of much debate; Kuhn himself denied the accusation of relativism in the third edition of \"SSR\", and sought to clarify his views to avoid further misinterpretation. Freeman Dyson has quoted Kuhn as saying \"I am not a Kuhnian!\", referring to the relativism that some philosophers have developed based on his work.\n\nThe enormous impact of Kuhn's work can be measured in the changes it brought about in the vocabulary of the philosophy of science: besides \"paradigm shift\", Kuhn popularized the word \"paradigm\" itself from a term used in certain forms of linguistics and the work of Georg Lichtenberg to its current broader meaning, coined the term \"normal science\" to refer to the relatively routine, day-to-day work of scientists working within a paradigm, and was largely responsible for the use of the term \"scientific revolutions\" in the plural, taking place at widely different periods of time and in different disciplines, as opposed to a single scientific revolution in the late Renaissance. The frequent use of the phrase \"paradigm shift\" has made scientists more aware of and in many cases more receptive to paradigm changes, so that Kuhn's analysis of the evolution of scientific views has by itself influenced that evolution.\n\nKuhn's work has been extensively used in social science; for instance, in the post-positivist/positivist debate within International Relations. Kuhn is credited as a foundational force behind the post-Mertonian sociology of scientific knowledge. Kuhn's work has also been used in the Arts and Humanities, such as by Matthew Edward Harris to distinguish between scientific and historical communities (such as political or religious groups): 'political-religious beliefs and opinions are not epistemologically the same as those pertaining to scientific theories'. This is because would-be scientists' worldviews are changed through rigorous training, through the engagement between what Kuhn calls 'exemplars' and the Global Paradigm. Kuhn's notions of paradigms and paradigm shifts have been influential in understanding the history of economic thought, for example the Keynesian revolution, and in debates in political science.\n\nA defense Kuhn gives against the objection that his account of science from \"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\" results in relativism can be found in an essay by Kuhn called \"Objectivity, Value Judgment, and Theory Choice.\" In this essay, he reiterates five criteria from the penultimate chapter of \"SSR\" that determine (or help determine, more properly) theory choice:\n\nHe then goes on to show how, although these criteria admittedly determine theory choice, they are imprecise in practice and relative to individual scientists. According to Kuhn, \"When scientists must choose between competing theories, two men fully committed to the same list of criteria for choice may nevertheless reach different conclusions.\" For this reason, the criteria still are not \"objective\" in the usual sense of the word because individual scientists reach different conclusions with the same criteria due to valuing one criterion over another or even adding additional criteria for selfish or other subjective reasons. Kuhn then goes on to say, \"I am suggesting, of course, that the criteria of choice with which I began function not as rules, which determine choice, but as values, which influence it.\" Because Kuhn utilizes the history of science in his account of science, his criteria or values for theory choice are often understood as descriptive normative rules (or more properly, values) of theory choice for the scientific community rather than prescriptive normative rules in the usual sense of the word \"criteria\", although there are many varied interpretations of Kuhn's account of science.\n\nAlthough they used different terminologies, both Kuhn and Michael Polanyi believed that scientists' subjective experiences made science a relativized discipline. Polanyi lectured on this topic for decades before Kuhn published \"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\".\n\nSupporters of Polanyi charged Kuhn with plagiarism, as it was known that Kuhn attended several of Polanyi's lectures, and that the two men had debated endlessly over epistemology before either had achieved fame. The charge of plagiarism is peculiar, for Kuhn had generously acknowledged Polanyi in the first edition of \"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\". Despite this intellectual alliance, Polanyi's work was constantly interpreted by others within the framework of Kuhn's paradigm shifts, much to Polanyi's (and Kuhn's) dismay.\n\nIn honor of his legacy, the \"Thomas Kuhn Paradigm Shift Award\" is awarded by the American Chemical Society to speakers who present original views that are at odds with mainstream scientific understanding. The winner is selected based in the novelty of the viewpoint and its potential impact if it were to be widely accepted.\n\nKuhn was named a Guggenheim Fellow in 1954, and in 1982 was awarded the George Sarton Medal by the History of Science Society. He also received numerous honorary doctorates.\n\n\n\n"}

Its core function is to provide interpretation from and into Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish for meetings held at United Nations Headquarters, and those at other locations which the department is responsible for servicing. Interpretation is essential to the inter-governmental bodies for the proper conduct and smooth functioning of their deliberations.\n\nThe creation of the conference interpreting service – and the interpreting profession itself – at the United Nations has a direct connection with the evolution of international diplomatic relations, the League of Nations, the Nuremberg trials, the founding of the United Nations, and the birth of multilingualism within the United Nations itself.\n\nMost of the early interpreters of the United Nations were natural polyglots who were uprooted by wars and revolutions. For years, the only criterion used to select potential interpreters was the knowledge of two international languages the interpreters had to communicate in. Polyglots were found mainly in privileged social groups, government employees and professionals in colonial empires, in militarily and diplomatically powerful nations, in political or ideological exiles, in those who leave their countries temporarily for academic purposes, and in children of couples who speak different languages.\n\nAfter the 1960s, there was change in the sociological make-up of UN interpreters. The United Nations began recruiting and training potential interpreters who were monolingual from birth but had learned and specialized in languages. This generation of interpreters did not come from privileged groups or complex migratory backgrounds.\n\nIn contrast with the early beginnings of the profession, there was also a progressive addition of women in the field of conference interpreting.\n\nAt the League of Nations and during the San Francisco Conference (1945) before the formal founding of the United Nations, the interpreters played a vital and visible role in meetings. In consecutive interpretation, conference interpreters spoke from the same dais as the original speakers, and the speaker stops periodically so that the interpreter can interpret what has just been said while the participants in the meeting viewed and listened to the consecutive interpreter. The conference interpreters were often exposed to selected or large audiences and the media.\nIn the late 1940s and the early 1950s, United Nations officials introduced simultaneous interpretation as a preferred method for the majority of UN meetings because it saved time and improved the quality of the output. Simultaneous interpreting – a mode that confined the interpreters in glass-encased booths aided with earpieces and microphones – arose in the 1920s and 1930s when American businessman Edward Filene and British engineer A. Gordon-Finlay developed simultaneous interpretation equipment with IBM, and was also used in the post-World War II Nazi war crime trials held in Nuremberg, Germany.\n\n\nThe UN Interpretation Service is composed of the following staff:.\n\nThe UN Interpretation Service is divided into the following sections:.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Klykov's bronze statues did not conform to the precepts of Socialist Realism. His playful sculptural decor for the Central Musical Theatre for Children (1979) made him famous. In the late 1980s Klykov turned to the Russian Orthodox Church for inspiration and support. His public statue of Sergius of Radonezh in Radonezh (1987) was the first memorial installed in the Soviet Union without permission from the authorities.\n\nKlykov's other high-profile commissions include the memorial and church on the Field of Prokhorovka (1995), the public statues of Sts. Cyril and Methodius on Slavyanskaya Square (1991) and Marshal Zhukov on Manege Square (1995). He was also responsible for the statue of St. Vladimir in Kherson (1993) and several monuments to Nicholas II, including the first one erected in Russia, in 1996, which was blown up by anti-monarchists on several occasions.\n\nIn the 1990s, Klykov created and ran the International Fund of Slavonic Literature and Culture, a nationalist organization with close connections to the \"Pamyat\", and (later) \"Rodina\". In July 1991, Klykov signed the open letter A Word to the People, an anti-Perestroika publication. In 1990s, Klykov was close to the CPRF; on 21 November 2005, he was elected the chairman of the re-founded Union of the Russian People. In 2005, he signed the \"letter of 500\", a controversial appeal to the Prosecutor General to review all Jewish organizations in Russia for extremism. In 2005, a reports circulated that Klykov had unveiled a statue in the village of Kholki that depicted Sviatoslav I of Kiev trampling a Khazar warrior with a prominently displayed Star of David. The Press Center of the Belgorod Regional Administration issued a response stating that while plans for a monument were underway, none had yet been erected in the region thus far, and that the design of the monument would show \"respect towards representatives of all nationalities and religions.\" The statue was eventually unveiled and the response by the Press Center has been confirmed. The statue is in the village of Kholki, near Belgorod.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "37338128", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37338128", "title": "Zhongfeng Mingben", "text": "Zhongfeng Mingben\n\nZhongfeng Mingben ( , 1263–1323) was a Chan Buddhist master who lived at the beginning of Yuan China. He adhered to the rigorous style of the Linji school and influenced Zen through several Japanese teachers who studied under him.\n\nZhongfeng Mingben's family name was Sun. He was the youngest of seven children. His mother died when he was nine years old. Already in his teenage years he wanted to become a monk. From fifteen he observed the layman's Five Precepts. His left hand became mutilated when, in his youth he burned the little finger as a sacrifice to the Buddha. This may have been inspired by chapter 23 of the \"Lotus Sutra\":\nIn 1287 Zhongfeng Mingben received tonsure at Shiziyuan Monastery on Tianmu Mountain. In 1288 he was ordained as a monk. Contrary to the norm, he grew long hair in (presumed) accordance with his teacher, Gaofeng Yuanmai.\n\nAs a young man he was appointed to succeed the abbot of the monastery on Tianmu Mountain, but fled the monastery in a search for solitude.\n\nAs an adult he had an \"overpowering physical build\". He was called \"The old Buddha south of the sea\", an allusion to Mazu Daoyi, (709–788) one of the most influential teachers of Chan Buddhism, who lived during the Tang dynasty (618–907), the \"golden age of Zen\". Zhongfeng Mingben declined a number of titles, appointments and positions, temporarily choosing instead a life of wandering and solitary meditation. He turned down an invitation of Ayurbarwada Buyantu Khan to come to the Yuan court.\n\nIn Zhongfeng Mingben's \"Huanzhu Jiaxun\", \"Family instructions of Illusory Abiding\", he describes himself as \"the illusionary man\", alluding to the play of Maya and the ability of tricksters to create an illusionary world. Zhongfeng Mingben states that this world is illusory, but that there is no alternative to this illusion. Students have to realize the pervasiveness of this illusion, and learn to act within it. The alternative for this illusionary or relative world, the absolute truth, is not to be regarded as an enduring phenomenon.\n\nZhongfeng Mingben relies on the \"Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment\" in his teachings on how to overcome this illusion. This sutra gives metaphors connected to illusion to explain the insubstantial nature of ignorance, such as dreams or flowers in the sky. Illusory phenomena emerge from an intrinsically pure ground. Since the illusions are not real in themselves, their disappearance will not change this pure ground. But the disappearance itself is also illusionary since the mind is enlightened or pure from the beginning. This makes it impossible to speak of either being enlightened or unenlightened, a position which is clearly at odds with basic Buddhist teachings. This is \"cured\" by overcoming \"the discriminating thought processes that posit terms like \"illusion\" and \"real\"\".\n\nIllusion is also created by relying on words. There are alternative, non-discursive ways of relating to words, one of them being \"k'an-hua\", \"observing the key phrase\", the method of kōan study introduced by Dahui Zonggao (1089–1163). Insight must be based in bodily experience rather than mere intellectual discrimination.\n\nAnother physical practice is calligraphy, the writing of characters. This writing is a bodily act. The writing of a character is not an intellectual inquiry, but \"a performance of it\". Zhongfeng Mingben was a celebrated calligraphy artist.\n\nZhongfeng Mingben merged Chán with Pure Land teachings. Together with Yongming Yanshou (904–975), who lived three centuries earlier, he was an influential proponent of this dual practice.\n\nZhongfeng Mingben lived after the \"golden age of Chán\" of the Tang and the proliferation of Chán during the Tang. His age was regarded as an age of \"mofa\" (\"Degenerate age of the Law\"). Zhongfeng Mingben attributed this to a lack of monastic discipline and a lack of personal dedication by monks, and tried to counter this by writing a monastic code, the \"Huan-chu ch'ing-kuei\" (Jpn. \"Genju shingi\"), in 1317. This work influenced Musō Soseki, a contemporary of Zhongfeng Mingben, when he wrote his guidelines for monasteries and monks, the \"Rinsen kakun\".\n\nZhongfeng Mingben was the first to compare the sayings and teachings of the 'masters of the old' with the public cases of the court, the \"gong-an\".\n\nAccording to Zhongfeng Mingben \"gōng'àn\" abbreviates \"gōngfǔ zhī àndú\" (公府之案牘, Japanese \"kōfu no antoku\" – literally the \"andu\" \"official correspondence; documents; files\" of a \"gongfu\" \"government post\"), which referred to a \"public record\" or the \"case records of a public law court\" in Tang-dynasty China. \"Kōan/gong'an\" thus serves as a metaphor for principles of reality beyond the private opinion of one person, and a teacher may test the student's ability to recognize and understand that principle.\n\nSeveral Japanese Buddhists came to China to study with Zhongfeng Mingben on Mount T'ien-mu. They formed the Genjū line of the Rinka monasteries, the more independent monasteries outside the cities and the Five Mountain System of government-approved temples. Kosen Ingen was the most important of these Japanese students. Other students include Kohō Kakumyō, a teacher of Bassui Tokushō, and Jakushitsu Genkō (1290–1367), the founder of Eigen-ji.\n\nAlthough they never met, Zhongfeng Mingben had a close affinity with Musō Soseki, via the Japanese students who studied with him.\n\nHakuin's warning against \"wild fox slobber\" can be traced back to Zhongfeng Mingben. The term \"wild fox\" points to teachers who lead students astray by giving wrong information. The term wild fox is also the name of the Wild fox koan. Whereas Zhongfeng Mingben warns against the impossible attempt of totally silencing the mind, Hakuin uses the term in a more positive sense, to denote the workings of koans, which \"possess the power to cause sudden death in students, raising the great doubt in their minds that will lead them to the 'great death' and the rebirth of satori and enlightenment\".\n\nZhongfeng Mingben's teachings mark the beginning of a development in Chinese Chán which made it vulnerable in the competition with other teachings:\nThis development left Chinese Chán vulnerable for criticisms by neo-Confucianism, which developed after the Song dynasty. Its anti-intellectual rhetoric was no match for the intellectual discourse of the neo-Confucianists.\n\n\n\n"}
