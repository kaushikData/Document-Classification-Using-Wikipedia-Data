{"id": "42597133", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42597133", "title": "Adrishta", "text": "Adrishta\n\nThe Fifth Chapter of the Vaisheshika Sutras of Kanada deals with the notion of action and the connected concept of effort; and also deals with the various special phenomenon of nature to the supersensible force, called Adrishta.\n\nThe Sanskrit term, Adrishta (Sanskrit: अदृष्ट), as an adjective means - not seen, unseen, unobserved, unforeseen, unknown, invisible, unexpected, not experienced, destiny, fate, luck, not permitted or sanctioned, illegal, virtue or vice as the eventual cause of pleasure or pain. In Hindu philosophy it refers to the unseen force, and the invisible results of works which accrue to a person; it refers to the Doctrine of Apurva.\n\nAdrishta, literally meaning unseen, in the Mimamsa context refers to the invisible result of a ritual that accrues to a person, and in the Vaisheshika context, synonymous with Adharma, to the equally invisible negative karmic accrual, as the unknown quality of things and of the soul, and brings about the cosmic order and arranges for soul according to their merits or demerits. Adrishta is all the elements which are not known and verified with the help of the five senses, and which can be realized through mind, intelligence and soul.\n\nEach successive birth or incarnation and its possibilities are determined by the Adrishta and Samskara acquired in the previous incarnations – Adrishta and Samskara, without which the Atman has never been, because its series of incarnations never began. Adrishta is Potential worth which must have been acquired in a human state to relate to a human state; it gives unity to the multiplicity and infinite variety of beings, and of the things under their control, it binds them into a single system and an organic whole. Prashasta hints that the existence of the Universe itself though not due to Brahma’s Adrishta is not free from Adrishta (Moral merit). All current actions and planned future actions get planted in Adrishta.\n\nThe term Vaisheshika, appearing only once in Vaisheshika Sutra X.ii.7 and meaning characteristic or distinguishing, according to Pāṇini (Sutra IV.iii.87) is derived from the word Vishesha meaning species, distinction, difference, excellence or superiority. Uluka, who was before the birth of Gautama Buddha and is commonly known as Kanada, compiled the Vaisheshika sutras. Gautama who founded the Nyaya School came later. The term Adrishta appears in Vaisheshika Sutra V.i.15:\n\nThe reason of the movement of the jewel is not a particular volition but the efficient cause is the merit of the former possessor or the demerit of the thief. The non-combative cause is its conjunction with soul possessing adrishta (or results of actions in previous states of existence) and the combinative cause is the jewel. Adrishta is also the cause of attraction of the needle towards a loadstone (magnet). Owing to adrishta is the upwards flaming of fire, the sideward motion of air and the actions of atoms at the beginning of creation. Kanada, later on, tells us that even action in earth results from impulse, impact, and conjunction with the conjunct and is caused by Adrishta (Vaisheshika Sutra V.ii.1-2).\nThe fruits or rewards of yajnas or sacrifice are not dispensed by any beneficent God. Apurva bestows the reward on the sacrificer. Apurva is the essential link between work and its result; it is a positive and unseen force created by an act that leads to the attainment of the fruit of action. This is the view of Jaimini though not implicitly mentioned by him but accepted by Prabhakara and Kumarila as one the fundamental tenets of their respective schools. Later on, it came to be said that Apurva is the function of God. Kumarila insists that fruits of karmas accrue in this very life and not in some future life. Bharat Mitra, who lived long before Sabara who lived long before Kumarila, does not accept Apurva. However, Patanjali tells us –\n\nthat obstacles are the breeding ground for tendencies that give rise to actions and the consequences thereof; such obstacles are experienced as visible and invisible obstacles. Swami Prabhavananda translates this sutra as – \"A man’s latent tendencies have been created by his past thoughts and actions; these tendencies will bear fruits, both in this life and in lives to come.\" \n\nApurva is an epistemic mechanism that indicates knowledge of causal links between acts and their consequences. Sabara discusses this concept in his commentary on the Vaisheshika Sutras, and even claims that by the word \"codana\" (Sanskrit: चोदन -meaning precept or rule -the performative element of an injunction) Jaimini really meant Apurva; it is mentioned by Jaimini in passing, as part of purvapaksha argument in Mimamasa Sutra I.ii.9.\n\nThe early Mimamsakas believed in an adrishta that was the result of performing karmas and saw no need for an Ishvara in their system. However, the Atomic Theory which teaches that the world is produced by the successive formation of compounds due to the aggregation of atoms resulting from the motion of atoms, the primary motion brought about by the unseen the Adrishta residing in the primary atoms and residing in the individual souls is rejected by the followers of the Vedanta (Uttara Mimamsa) schools:\n\"In either case (viz the Adrishta, the unseen principle, inhering either in the atoms or in the soul) the activity (of the atoms) is not (possible), therefore the negation of that (viz of creation through the combination of atoms).\"\n\nThe Nyaya-Vaisheshika systems of philosophy derive the conception of moksha from the Upanishads but require a highly developed stage of logical thought, and care more for the instrument of knowledge than for knowledge itself. The Mimamsa system by the very nature of its ritualistic problems does not have much in common with Upanishadic philosophy.\n"}
{"id": "10399772", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10399772", "title": "Agnotology", "text": "Agnotology\n\nAgnotology (formerly agnatology) is the study of culturally induced ignorance or doubt, particularly the publication of inaccurate or misleading scientific data. In 1995 Robert N. Proctor, a Stanford University professor specializing in the history of science and technology, and linguist Iain Boal coined the neologism\non the basis of the Neoclassical Greek word , \"agnōsis\", \"not knowing\" (cf. Attic Greek ἄγνωτος \"unknown\"), and , \"-logia\". More generally, the term also highlights the increasingly common condition where more knowledge of a subject leaves one more uncertain than before. David Dunning of Cornell University is another academic who studies the spread of ignorance. \"Dunning warns that the internet is helping propagate ignorance – it is a place where everyone has a chance to be their own expert, he says, which makes them prey for powerful interests wishing to deliberately spread ignorance\".\n\nIn his 1999 book \"The Erotic Margin\", Irvin C. Schick referred to \"unknowledge\" \"to distinguish it from ignorance, and to denote socially constructed lack of knowledge, that is, a conscious absence of socially pertinent knowledge\". As an example, he offered the labeling \"terra incognita\" in early maps, noting that \"The reconstruction of parts of the globe as uncharted territory is ... the \"production of unknowledge\", the transformation of those parts into potential objects of Western political and economic attention. It is the enabling of colonialism.\"\n\nThere are many causes of culturally induced ignorance. These include the influence of the media, either through neglect or as a result of deliberate misrepresentation and manipulation. Corporations and governmental agencies can contribute to the subject matter studied by agnotology through secrecy and suppression of information, document destruction, and myriad forms of inherent or avoidable culturopolitical selectivity, inattention, and forgetfulness.\n\nProctor cites as a prime example of the deliberate production of ignorance the tobacco industry's advertising campaign to manufacture doubt about the cancerous and other health effects of tobacco use. Under the banner of science, the industry produced research about everything except tobacco hazards to exploit public uncertainty.\n\nAgnotology also focuses on how and why diverse forms of knowledge do \"not\" \"come to be\", or are ignored or delayed. For example, knowledge about plate tectonics was censored and delayed for at least a decade because some evidence remained classified military information related to undersea warfare.\n\nThe term \"agnotology\" was first coined in a footnote in Proctor's 1995 book, \"The Cancer Wars: How Politics Shapes What We Know and Don't Know About Cancer\": \"Historians and philosophers of science have tended to treat ignorance as an ever-expanding vacuum into which knowledge is sucked – or even, as Johannes Kepler once put it, as the mother who must die for science to be born. Ignorance, though, is more complex than this. It has a distinct and changing political geography that is often an excellent indicator of the politics of knowledge. We need a political agnotology to complement our political epistemologies\".\n\nProctor was quoted using the term to describe his research \"only half jokingly\", as \"agnotology\" in a 2001 interview about his lapidary work with the colorful rock agate. He connected the two seemingly unrelated topics by noting the lack of geologic knowledge and study of agate since its first known description by Theophrastus in 300 BC, relative to the extensive research on other rocks and minerals such as diamonds, asbestos, granite, and coal, all of which have much higher commercial value. He said agate was a \"victim of scientific disinterest\", the same \"structured apathy\" he called \"the social construction of ignorance\".\n\nHe was later quoted as calling it \"agnotology, the study of ignorance\", in a 2003 \"The New York Times\" story on medical historians testifying as expert witnesses.\n\nProctor co-organized a pair of events with Londa Schiebinger, his wife, who is also a science history professor: the first was a workshop at the Pennsylvania State University in 2003 titled \"Agnatology: The Cultural Production of Ignorance\", and later a conference at Stanford University in 2005 titled \"Agnotology: The Cultural Production of Ignorance\".\n\nIn 2004, Londa Schiebinger\ngave a more precise definition of agnotology in a paper on 18th-century voyages of scientific discovery and gender relations, and contrasted it with epistemology, the theory of knowledge, saying that the latter questions how we know while the former questions why we do not know: \"Ignorance is often not merely the absence of knowledge but an outcome of cultural and political struggle\".\n\nIts use as a critical description of the political economy has been expanded upon by Michael Betancourt in a 2010 article titled \"Immaterial Value and Scarcity in Digital Capitalism\" and expanded in the book \"The Critique of Digital Capitalism\". His analysis is focused on the housing bubble as well as the bubble economy of the period from 1980 to 2008. Betancourt argues that this political economy should be termed \"agnotologic capitalism\" because the systemic production and maintenance of ignorance is a major feature that enables the economy to function as it allows the creation of a \"bubble economy\".\n\nBetancourt's argument is posed in relation to the idea of affective labor. He states that The creation of systemic unknowns where any potential \"fact\" is always already countered by an alternative of apparently equal weight and value renders engagement with the conditions of reality – the very situations affective labor seeks to assuage – contentious and a source of confusion, reflected by the inability of participants in bubbles to be aware of the imminent collapse until after it has happened. The biopolitical paradigm of distraction, what [Juan Martin] Prada calls \"life to enjoy\", can only be maintained if the underlying strictures remain hidden from view. If affective labor works to reduce alienation, agnotology works to eliminate the potential for dissent.\nIn his view, the role of affective labor is to enable the continuation of the agnotologic effects that enable the maintenance of the capitalist status quo.\n\nA similar word from the same Greek roots, \"agnoiology\", meaning \"the science or study of ignorance, which determines its quality and conditions\" or \"the doctrine concerning those things of which we are necessarily ignorant\" describes a branch of philosophy studied by James Frederick Ferrier in the 19th century.\n\nAnthropologist Glenn Stone points out that most of the examples of agnotology (such as work promoting tobacco use) do not actually create a lack of knowledge so much as they create confusion. A more accurate term for such writing would be \"ainigmology\", from the root \"ainigma\" (as in \"enigma\"); in Greek this refers to riddles or to language that obscures the true meaning of a story.\n\nThe availability of such large amounts of knowledge in this information age may not necessarily be producing a knowledgeable citizenry. Instead it may be allowing many people to cherry-pick information in blogs or news that reinforces their existing beliefs.\nand to be distracted from new knowledge by repetitive or base entertainments. There is conflicting evidence on how television viewing affects intelligence as well as values formation.\n\nAn emerging new scientific discipline that has connections to agnotology is cognitronics:\nThe field of cognitronics appears to be growing as international conferences have centered on the topic. The 2013 conference will be in Slovenia.\n\n\n\n"}

He received his doctorate in 1971 for the dissertation \"On the theory of literary narrative\". He earned his habilitation in Saarbrücken as an assistant of Kuno Lorenz. The title of his habilitation thesis was \"Philosophy as a methodological critique of meaning\". In subsequent years, Ros was a visiting professor in Hamburg, Saarbrücken and Campinas (Brazil).\n\nSince 1994 he is professor for Theoretical Philosophy at the Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg. His main focus is concentrated on systematic and historical problems of argumentation theory with special attention to the theory of concepts (the concept of concept) as well as systematic and historical questions of philosophy of biology and psychology, with particular reference to the philosophical aspects of the mind-matter problem.\n\nAmong his students, he is best known and appreciated for his conceptually accurate argumentation and teaching. In his lectures he takes particular care to examine complicated problems by clearly distinguishing between their logical-methodological and historical components.\n\nRos is known (also because of his activities as a former assistant of Kuno Lorenz) as an expert in argumentation theory and in this field he has researched the concepts of concept, of foundation, of explanation as well as of a typology of explanations (which are distinguished by the different types of causes that they provide). From 1989 to 1990, Ros published \"Foundation and Concept\", a three volume monograph on the concept of concept that spans the history of philosophy from its beginnings in ancient Greece to contemporary Analytical Philosophy.\n\nThe term 'concept' is understood by Ros along lines suggested by Ludwig Wittgenstein's later work, that is, as a linguistic classificatory ability or habit. The epistemological starting point is that we as subjects can only acquire knowledge about parts of the world by classifying objects (entities), that is, by making use of our classificatory abilities. The problem lies in the fact that our classificatory abilities may be learned, dependent on culture, or biologically conditioned, whereby the possibility of objective justification can be called into question. From this arises the task of philosophy, which, unlike the sciences, does not use or apply our classificatory abilities to interpret reality, but rather reflects upon these very conceptual abilities, that is, investigates whether they are meaningful or reasonable.\n\nAs an argumentation theorist, Ros especially emphasizes that within the philosophy of mind it is critical to first of all specify the problem as exactly as possible. Physical processes have to be distinguished from biological processes because the latter, in contrast to the former, when related to the activities of an organism, are purposeful and are meant as a response to a stimulus. From the concept of organism Ros progresses to the concept of the agent or acting subject, and from this to the concept of person, which is characterized by the criterion of possessing psychological phenomena. In the case of humans, an additional stage is reached, because they are also able to guide themselves by rules.\n\nIn \"Matter and Spirit\" (2005), Ros presented a thorough analysis of the mind-matter problem. In 2008, he published the essay \"Mental Causation and Mereological Explanations\", in which he tries to solve the problem of mental causation by means of mereological explanations.\n\nIn addition, he has recently published the following papers on the philosophy of mind:\n\nRos speaks in the philosophy of mind expressly of psychological (German, \"psychische\") phenomena instead of mental (German, \"mentale\") or spiritual (German, \"geistige\") states (as is common in the current debate). For him, only higher cognitive functions (such as problem solving, use of abstract concepts, etc.) qualify as mental or spiritual, while psychological phenomena must include states such as temper tantrums. Ros therefore avoids using the terms mental and spiritual. After all, the German word \"Geist\" is merely a corresponding term for the Greek concept of \"psyche\".\n\nThis is a selection of the works of Arno Ros.

{"id": "26221613", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26221613", "title": "Burden of proof (philosophy)", "text": "Burden of proof (philosophy)\n\nThe burden of proof (Latin: onus probandi, shortened from \"Onus probandi incumbit ei qui dicit, non ei qui negat\") is the obligation on a party in a dispute to provide sufficient warrant for their position.\n\nWhen two parties are in a discussion and one makes a claim that the other disputes, the one who makes the claim typically has a \"burden of proof\" to justify or substantiate that claim especially when it challenges a perceived status quo. This is also stated in Hitchens's razor. Carl Sagan proposed a related criterion, the Sagan standard, \"extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence\".\n\nWhile certain kinds of arguments, such as logical syllogisms, require mathematical or strictly logical proofs, the standard for evidence to meet the burden of proof is usually determined by context and community standards and conventions.\n\nPhilosophical debate can devolve into arguing about who has the burden of proof about a particular claim. This has been described as \"burden tennis\" or the \"onus game\".\n\nOne way in which one would attempt to shift the burden of proof is by committing a logical fallacy known as the argument from ignorance. It occurs when either a proposition is assumed to be true because it has not yet been proved false or a proposition is assumed to be false because it has not yet been proved true.\n\nA negative claim is a colloquialism for an affirmative claim that asserts the non-existence or exclusion of something. Saying \"You cannot prove a negative\" has been called pseudologic because there are many proofs that substantiate negative claims in mathematics, science, and economics including Arrow's impossibility theorem. There can be multiple claims within a debate. Nevertheless, it has been said whoever makes a claim carries the burden of proof regardless of positive or negative content in the claim.\n\nA negative claim may or may not exist as a counterpoint to a previous claim. A proof of impossibility or an evidence of absence argument are typical methods to fulfill the burden of proof for a negative claim.\n\nBurden of proof is also an important concept in the public arena of ideas. Once participants in discourse establish common assumptions, the mechanism of burden of proof helps to ensure that all parties contribute productively, using relevant arguments.\n\nThe legal burden of proof () is the obligation of a party in a trial to produce the evidence that will prove the claims they have made against the other party. In a legal dispute, one party is initially presumed to be correct and gets the benefit of the doubt, while the other side bears the burden of proof. When a party bearing the burden of proof meets their burden, the burden of proof switches to the other side. Burdens may be of different kinds for each party, in different phases of litigation. The burden of production is a minimal burden to produce at least enough evidence for the trier of fact to \"consider\" a disputed claim. After litigants have met the burden of production and their claim is being considered by a trier of fact, they have the burden of persuasion, that enough evidence has been presented to persuade the trier of fact that their side is correct. There are different \"standards\" of persuasiveness ranging from a preponderance of the evidence, where there is just enough evidence to tip the balance, to proof beyond a reasonable doubt, as in United States criminal courts.\n\nThe burden of proof is usually on the person who brings a claim in a dispute. It is often associated with the Latin maxim \"semper necessitas probandi incumbit ei qui agit\", a translation of which in this context is: \"the necessity of proof always lies with the person who lays charges.\"\n\nThe party that does not carry the burden of proof carries the benefit of assumption of being correct, they are presumed to be correct, until the burden shifts after presentation of evidence by the party bringing the action. An example is in an American criminal case, where there is a presumption of innocence by the defendant. Fulfilling the burden of proof effectively captures the benefit of assumption, passing the burden of proof off to another party.\n\nIn inferential statistics, the null hypothesis is a general statement or default position that there is no relationship between two measured phenomena, or no association among groups. Rejecting or disproving the null hypothesis—and thus concluding that there are grounds for believing that there \"is\" a relationship between two phenomena (e.g. that a potential treatment has a measurable effect)—is a central task in the modern practice of science; the field of statistics gives precise criteria for rejecting a null hypothesis.\n\nThe null hypothesis is generally assumed to be true until evidence indicates otherwise. In statistics, it is often denoted \"H\" (read “H-nought”, \"H-null\", \"H-oh\", or \"H-zero\").\n\nThe concept of a null hypothesis is used differently in two approaches to statistical inference. In the significance testing approach of Ronald Fisher, a null hypothesis is rejected if the observed data are significantly unlikely to have occurred if the null hypothesis were true. In this case the null hypothesis is rejected and an alternative hypothesis is accepted in its place. If the data are consistent with the null hypothesis, then the null hypothesis is not rejected. In neither case is the null hypothesis or its alternative proven; the null hypothesis is tested with data and a decision is made based on how likely or unlikely the data are. This is analogous to the legal principle of presumption of innocence, in which a suspect or defendant is assumed to be innocent (null is not rejected) until proven guilty (null is rejected) beyond a reasonable doubt (to a statistically significant degree).\n\nIn the hypothesis testing approach of Jerzy Neyman and Egon Pearson, a null hypothesis is contrasted with an alternative hypothesis and the two hypotheses are distinguished on the basis of data, with certain error rates.\n\nProponents of each approach criticize the other approach. Nowadays, though, a hybrid approach is widely practiced and presented in textbooks. The hybrid is in turn criticized as incorrect and incoherent—for details, see Statistical hypothesis testing.\n\nStatistical inference can be done without a null hypothesis, by specifying a statistical model corresponding to each candidate hypothesis and using model selection techniques to choose the most appropriate model. (The most common selection techniques are based on either Akaike information criterion or Bayes factor.)\n\nInternet personality Matt Dillahunty gives the example of a large jar full of gumballs to illustrate the burden of proof. The number of whole gumballs in the jar is either even or odd, but the degree of personal acceptance or rejection of claims about that characteristic may vary. We can choose to consider two claims about the situation, given as:\nEither claim could be explored separately; however, both claims tautologically take bearing on the same question. Odd in this case means \"not even\" and could be described as a negative claim. Before we have any information about the number of gumballs, we have no means of checking either of the two claims. When we have no evidence to resolve the proposition, we may suspend judgment. From a cognitive sense, when no personal preference toward opposing claims exists, one may be either skeptical about both claims or ambivalent about both claims. If there is a dispute, the burden of proof falls onto the challenger of the status quo from the perspective of any given social narrative. If there is no agreeable and adequate proof of evidence to support a claim, the claim is considered an argument from ignorance.\n"}
{"id": "34044035", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34044035", "title": "Chan Buddhism", "text": "Chan Buddhism\n\nChan (; of ), from Sanskrit \"dhyāna\" (meaning \"meditation\" or \"meditative state\"), is a Chinese school of Mahāyāna Buddhism. It developed in China from the 6th century CE onwards, becoming dominant during the Tang and Song dynasties. After the Yuan, Chan more or less fused with Pure Land Buddhism.\n\nChan spread south to Vietnam as Thiền and north to Korea as Seon, and, in the 13th century, east to Japan as Zen.\n\nThe historical records required for a complete, accurate account of early Chan history no longer exist.\n\nThe history of Chan in China can be divided into several periods. Chan as we know it today is the result of a long history, with many changes and contingent factors. Each period had different types of Chan, some of which have remained influential, while others vanished.\n\nFerguson distinguishes three periods from the fifth century into the thirteenth century:\n\nAlthough McRae has reservations about the division of Chan's history in phases or periods, he nevertheless distinguishes four phases in the history of Chan:\n\nNeither Ferguson nor McRae gives a periodisation for Chinese Chan after the Song Dynasty, though McRae mentions \"at least a post-classical phase or perhaps multiple phases\".\n\nWhen Buddhism came to China, it was adapted to the Chinese culture and understanding. Theories about the influence of other schools in the evolution of Chan vary widely and heavily reliant upon speculative correlation rather than on written records or histories. Some scholars have argued that Chan developed from the interaction between Mahāyāna Buddhism and Taoism, while others insist that Chan has roots in yogic practices, specifically ', the consideration of objects, and ', total fixation of the mind. A number of other conflicting theories exist.\n\nBuddhism was exposed to Confucian and Taoist influences when it came to China. Goddard quotes D.T. Suzuki, calling Chan a \"natural evolution of Buddhism under Taoist conditions\". Buddhism was first identified to be \"a barbarian variant of Taoism\", and Taoist terminology was used to express Buddhist doctrines in the oldest translations of Buddhist texts, a practice termed \"matching the concepts\".\nThe first Buddhist recruits in China were Taoists. They developed high esteem for the newly introduced Buddhist meditational techniques, and blended them with Taoist meditation. Representatives of early Chinese Buddhism like Sengzhao and Tao Sheng were deeply influenced by the Taoist keystone works of Laozi and Zhuangzi. Against this background, especially the Taoist concept of \"naturalness\" was inherited by the early Chan disciples: they equated – to some extent – the ineffable Tao and Buddha-nature, and thus, rather than feeling bound to the abstract \"wisdom of the sūtras\", emphasized Buddha-nature to be found in \"everyday\" human life, just as the Tao.\n\nNeo-Taoist concepts were taken over in Chinese Buddhism as well. Concepts such as \"T'i-yung\" (體用 Essence and Function) and \"Li-shih\" (理事 Noumenon and Phenomenon, or Principle and Practice) were first taken over by Hua-yen Buddhism, which consequently influenced Chan deeply. On the other hand, Taoists at first misunderstood sunyata to be akin to the Taoist non-being.\n\nThe emerging Chinese Buddhism nevertheless had to compete with Taoism and Confucianism:\nWhen Buddhism came to China, there were three divisions of training:\n\nIt was in this context that Buddhism entered into Chinese culture. Three types of teachers with expertise in each training practice developed:\n\nMonasteries and practice centers were created that tended to focus on either the Vinaya and training of monks or the teachings focused on one scripture or a small group of texts. Dhyāna (\"Chan\") masters tended to practice in solitary hermitages, or to be associated with vinaya training monasteries or the dharma teaching centers. The later naming of the Zen school has its origins in this view of the threefold division of training.\n\nMcRae goes so far as to say:\n\nThe Chan tradition ascribes the origins of Chan in India to the Flower Sermon, the earliest source for which comes from the 14th century. It is said that Gautama Buddha gathered his disciples one day for a Dharma talk. When they gathered together, the Buddha was completely silent and some speculated that perhaps the Buddha was tired or ill. The Buddha silently held up and twirled a flower and his eyes twinkled; several of his disciples tried to interpret what this meant, though none of them were correct. One of the Buddha's disciples, Mahākāśyapa, gazed at the flower and broke into laugher. The Buddha then acknowledged Mahākāśyapa's insight by saying the following:\n\nTraditionally the origin of Chan in China is credited to the Indian monk Bodhidharma. Only scarce historical information is available about him, but his hagiography developed when the Chan tradition grew stronger and gained prominence in the early 8th century. By this time a lineage of the six ancestral founders of Chan in China was developed. In the late 8th century, under the influence of Huineng's student Shenhui, the traditional form of this lineage had been established:\n\nIn later writings this lineage was extended to include 28 Indian patriarchs. In the \"Song of Enlightenment\" (證道歌 \"Zhèngdào gē\") of Yongjia Xuanjue (永嘉玄覺, 665–713), one of the chief disciples of Huìnéng, it is written that Bodhidharma was the 28th patriarch in a line of descent from Mahākāśyapa, a disciple of Śākyamuni Buddha, and the first patriarch of Chan Buddhism.\nIn its beginnings in China, Chan primarily referred to the Mahāyāna sūtras and especially to the \"Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra\". As a result, early masters of the Chan tradition were referred to as \"Laṅkāvatāra masters\". As the \"Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra\" teaches the doctrine of the Ekayāna \"One Vehicle\", the early Chan school was sometimes referred to as the \"One Vehicle School\". In other early texts, the school that would later become known as Chan is sometimes even referred to as simply the \"Laṅkāvatāra school\" (Ch. 楞伽宗, \"Léngqié Zōng\"). Accounts recording the history of this early period are to be found in the \"Records of the Laṅkāvatāra Masters\" (\").\n\nThe establishment of Chan in China is traditionally credited to the Buddhist monk Bodhidharma, who is recorded as having come to China during the time of Southern and Northern Dynasties to teach a \"special transmission outside scriptures\" which \"did not stand upon words\".\n\nLittle contemporary biographical information on Bodhidharma is extant, and subsequent accounts became layered with legend. There are three principal sources for Bodhidharma's biography: \"The Record of the Buddhist Monasteries of Luoyang\" by Yáng Xuànzhī's (楊衒之, 547), Tan Lin's preface to the \"Long Scroll of the Treatise on the Two Entrances and Four Practices\" (6th century CE), and Dayi Daoxin's \"Further Biographies of Eminent Monks\" (7th century CE).\n\nThese sources vary in their account of Bodhidharma being either \"from Persia\" (547 CE), \"a Brahman monk from South India\" (645 CE), \"the third son of a Brahman king of South India\" (c. 715 CE). Some traditions specifically describe Bodhidharma to be the third son of a Pallava king from Kanchipuram.\n\nThe \"Long Scroll of the Treatise on the Two Entrances and Four Practices\" written by Tan Lin (曇林; 506–574), contains teachings which are attributed to Bodhidharma. The text is known from the Dunhuang manuscripts. The two entrances to enlightenment are the entrance of principle and the entrance of practice:\n\nThis text was used and studied by Huike and his students. The True Nature refers to the Buddha-nature.\n\nBodhidharma settled in Northern Wei China. Shortly before his death, Bodhidharma appointed his disciple Dazu Huike to succeed him, making Huike the first Chinese-born ancestral founder and the second ancestral founder of Chan in China. Bodhidharma is said to have passed three items to Huike as a sign of transmission of the Dharma: a robe, a bowl, and a copy of the \"Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra\". The transmission then passed to the second ancestral founder Dazu Huike, the third Sengcan, the fourth ancestral founder Dayi Daoxin, and the fifth ancestral founder Daman Hongren.\n\nThe period of Dayi Daoxin (580–651) and Daman Hongren ( 601–674) came to be called the East Mountain Teaching due to the location of the residence of Daman Hongren in Huangmei County, modern Anhui. The term was used by Yuquan Shenxiu, the most important successor to Hongren. The East Mountain community was a specialized meditation training centre. Hongren was a plain meditation teacher, who taught students of \"various religious interests\", including \"practitioners of the Lotus Sutra, students of Madhyamaka philosophy, or specialists in the monastic regulations of Buddhist Vinaya\". The establishment of a community in one location was a change from the wandering lives of Bodhiharma and Huike and their followers. It fitted better into the Chinese society, which highly valued community-oriented behaviour, instead of solitary practice.\n\nYuquan Shenxiu (神秀, 606?–706) was the most important successor to Hongren. In 701 he was invited to the Imperial Court by Zhou Empress Wu Zetian, who paid him due imperial reverence. The first lineage documents were produced in this period:\nThe transition from the East Mountain to the two capitals changed the character of Chan:\nAccording to tradition, the sixth and last ancestral founder, Huineng (惠能; 638–713), was one of the giants of Chan history, and all surviving schools regard him as their ancestor. The dramatic story of Huineng's life tells that there was a controversy over his claim to the title of patriarch. After being chosen by Hongren, the fifth ancestral founder, Huineng had to flee by night to Nanhua Temple in the south to avoid the wrath of Hongren's jealous senior disciples.\n\nModern scholarship, however, has questioned this narrative. Historic research reveals that this story was created around the middle of the 8th century, beginning in 731 by Shenhui, a successor to Huineng, to win influence at the Imperial Court. He claimed Huineng to be the successor of Hongren instead of Shenxiu, the recognized successor. In 745 Shenhui was invited to take up residence in the Heze Temple in the capital, Dongdu (modern Luoyang) In 753, he fell out of grace and had to leave Dongdu to go into exile.\n\nThe most prominent of the successors of Shenhui's lineage was Guifeng Zongmi. According to Zongmi, Shenhui's approach was officially sanctioned in 796, when \"an imperial commission determined that the Southern line of Ch'an represented the orthodox transmission and established Shen-hui as the seventh patriarch, placing an inscription to that effect in the Shen-lung temple\".\n\nDoctrinally, Shenhui's \"Southern School\" is associated with the teaching that enlightenment is sudden while the \"Northern\" or East Mountain school is associated with the teaching that enlightenment is gradual. This was a polemical exaggeration since both schools were derived from the same tradition, and the so-called Southern School incorporated many teachings of the more influential Northern School. Eventually both schools died out, but the influence of Shenhui was so immense that all later Chan schools traced their origin to Huineng, and \"sudden enlightenment\" became a standard doctrine of Chan.\n\nShenhui's influence is traceable in the \"Platform Sutra\", which gives a popular account of the story of Huineng but also reconciles the antagonism created by Shenhui. Salient is that Shenhui himself does not figure in the \"Platform Sutra\"; he was effectively written out of Chan history. The \"Platform Sutra\" also reflects the growing popularity of the \"Diamond Sūtra\" (\"Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra\") in 8th-century Chinese Buddhism. Thereafter, the essential texts of the Chan school were often considered to be both the \"Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra\" and the \"Diamond Sūtra\". The \"Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra\", which endorses the Buddha-nature, emphasized purity of mind, which can be attained in gradations. The Diamond-sutra emphasizes sunyata, which \"must be realized totally or not at all\". David Kalupahana associates the later Caodong school (Japanese Sōtō, gradual) and Linji school (Japanese Rinzai school, sudden) schools with the Yogacara and Madhyamaka philosophies respectively. The same comparison has been made by McRae. The Madhyamaka school elaborated on the theme of śūnyatā, which was set forth in the prajnaparamita sutras, to which the \"Diamond Sutra\" also belongs. The shift from the \"Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra\" to the \"Diamond Sutra\" also signifies a tension between Buddha-nature teachings, which imply a transcendental reality, versus śūnyatā, which denies such a transcendental reality.\n\nChinese Chan Buddhist teachers such as Moheyan first went to Tibet in the eighth century during the height of the Tibetan Empire. There seems to have been disputes between them and Indian Buddhists, as exemplified by the Samye debate. Many Tibetan Chan texts have been recovered from the caves at Dunhuang, where Chan and Tantric Buddhists lived side by side and this led to religious syncretism in some cases. Chan Buddhism survived in Tibet for several centuries, but had mostly been replaced by the 10th century developments in Tibetan Buddhism. According to Sam Van Schaik:\n\nAfter the 'dark period', all visible influences of Chan were eliminated from Tibetan Buddhism, and Mahayoga and Chan were carefully distinguished from each other. This trend\ncan already be observed in the tenth-century Lamp for the Eyes in Contemplation by the great central Tibetan scholar Gnubs chen Sangs rgyas ye shes. This influential work represented a crucial step in the codification of Chan, Mahayoga and the Great Perfection as distinct vehicles to enlightenment. In comparison, our group of [Dunhuang] manuscripts exhibits a remarkable freedom, blurring the lines between meditation systems which were elsewhere kept quite distinct. The system of practice set out in these manuscripts did not survive into the later Tibetan tradition. Indeed, this creative integration of meditation practices derived from both Indic and Chinese traditions could only have been possible during the earliest years of Tibetan Buddhism, when doctrinal categories were still forming, and in this sense it represents an important stage in the Tibetan assimilation of Buddhism.\n\nDaoxin, Hongren, Shenxiu, Huineng and Shenhui all lived during the early Tang. The later period of the Tang Dynasty is traditionally regarded as the \"golden age\" of Chan. This proliferation is described in a famous saying:\nThe An Lushan Rebellion (755–763) led to a loss of control by the Tang dynasty, and changed the Chan scene again. Metropolitan Chan began to lose its status, while \"other schools were arising in outlying areas controlled by warlords. These are the forerunners of the Chan we know today. Their origins are obscure; the power of Shen-hui's preaching is shown by the fact that they all trace themselves to Hui-neng.\"\n\nThe most important of these schools is the Hongzhou school (洪州宗) of Mazu, to which also belong Shitou, Baizhang Huaihai, Huangbo and Linji (Rinzai). Linji is also regarded as the founder of one of the Five Houses.\n\nThis school developed \"shock techniques such as shouting, beating, and using irrational retorts to startle their students into realization\". Some of these are common today, while others are found mostly in anecdotes. It is common in many Chan traditions today for Chan teachers to have a stick with them during formal ceremonies which is a symbol of authority and which can be also used to strike on the table during a talk.\n\nThese shock techniques became part of the traditional and still popular image of Chan masters displaying irrational and strange behaviour to aid their students. Part of this image was due to later misinterpretations and translation errors, such as the loud belly shout known as \"katsu\". \"Katsu\" means \"to shout\", which has traditionally been translated as \"yelled 'katsu'\" – which should mean \"yelled a yell\".\n\nA well-known story depicts Mazu practicing dhyana, but being rebuked by his teacher Nanyue Huairang, comparing seated meditation with polishing a tile. According to Faure, the criticism is not about dhyana as such, but \"the idea of \"becoming a Buddha\" by means of any practice, lowered to the standing of a \"means\" to achieve an \"end\"\". The criticism of seated dhyana reflects a change in the role and position of monks in Tang society, who \"undertook only pious works, reciting sacred texts and remaining seated in \"dhyana\"\". Nevertheless, seated dhyana remained an important part of the Chan tradition, also due to the influence of Guifeng Zongmi, who tried to balance dhyana and insight.\n\nThe Hung-chou school has been criticised for its radical subitism. Guifeng Zongmi (圭峰 宗密) (780–841), an influential teacher-scholar and patriarch of both the Chan and the Huayan school, claimed that the Hongzhou school teaching led to a radical nondualism that denies the need for spiritual cultivation and moral discipline. While Zongmi acknowledged that the essence of Buddha-nature and its functioning in the day-to-day reality are but difference aspects of the same reality, he insisted that there is a difference.\n\nTraditionally Shítóu Xīqiān (Ch. 石頭希遷, c. 700 – c.790) is seen as the other great figure of this period. In the Chan lineages he is regarded as the predecessor of the Caodong (Sōtō) school. He is also regarded as the author of the Sandokai, a poem which formed the basis for the Song of the Precious Mirror Samadhi of Dongshan Liangjie (Jp. Tōzan Ryōkan) and the teaching of the Five Ranks.\n\nDuring 845–846 Emperor Wuzong persecuted the Buddhist schools in China:\nThis persecution was devastating for metropolitan Chan, but the Chan school of Ma-tsu and his likes survived, and took a leading role in the Chan of the later Tang.\n\nAfter the fall of the Tang Dynasty, China was without effective central control during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period. China was divided into several autonomous regions. Support for Buddhism was limited to a few areas. The Hua-yen and T'ient-tai schools suffered from the changing circumstances, since they had depended on imperial support. The collapse of T'ang society also deprived the aristocratic classes of wealth and influence, which meant a further drawback for Buddhism. Shenxiu's Northern School and Henshui's Southern School didn't survive the changing circumstances. Nevertheless, Chan emerged as the dominant stream within Chinese Buddhism, but with various schools developing various emphasises in their teachings, due to the regional orientation of the period. The Fayan school, named after Fa-yen Wen-i (885–958) became the dominant school in the southern kingdoms of Nan-T'ang (Jiangxi, Chiang-hsi) and Wuyue (Che-chiang).\n\nThe Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period was followed by the Song Dynasty, which established a strong central government. During the Song Dynasty, Chan (禪) was used by the government to strengthen its control over the country, and Chan grew to become the largest sect in Chinese Buddhism. An ideal picture of the Chan of the Tang period was produced, which served the legacy of this newly acquired status:\nDuring the Song the \"Five Houses (Ch. 五家) of Chan\", or five \"schools\", were recognized. These were not originally regarded as \"schools\" or \"sects\", but based on the various Chan-genealogies. Historically they have come to be understood as \"schools\".\n\nThe Five Houses of Chan are:\n\nThe Linji-school became the dominant school within Chan, due to support from literati and the court. Before the Song Dynasty, the Linji-school is rather obscure, and very little is known about its early history. The first mention of Linji is in the \"Zutang ji\", compiled in 952, 86 years after Linji's death. But the \"Zutang ji\" pictures the Xuefeng Yicun lineage as heir to the legacy of Mazu and the Hongzhou-school.\n\nAccording to Welter, the real founder of the Linji-school was Shoushan (or Baoying) Shengnian (首山省念) (926–993), a fourth generation dharma-heir of Linji. The \"Tiansheng Guangdeng lu\" (天聖廣燈錄), \"Tiansheng Era Expanded Lamp Record\", compiled by the official Li Zunxu (李遵勗) (988–1038) confirms the status of Shoushan Shengnian, but also pictures Linji as a major Chan patriarch and heir to the Mazu, displacing the prominence of the Fayan-lineage. It also established the slogan of \"a special transmission outside the teaching\", supporting the Linji-school claim of \"Chan as separate from and superior to all other Buddhist teachings\".\n\nOver the course of Song Dynasty (960–1279), the Guiyang, Fayan, and Yunmen schools were gradually absorbed into the Linji. Song Chan was dominated by the Linji school of Dahui Zonggao, which in turn became strongly affiliated to the Imperial Court:\nThe Gozan system was a system of state-controlled temples, which were established by the Song government in all provinces.\n\nThe teaching styles and words of the classical masters were recorded in the so-called \"encounter dialogues\". Snippets of these encounter dialogues were collected in texts as the \"Blue Cliff Record\" (1125) of Yuanwu, \"The Gateless Gate\" (1228) of Wumen, both of the Linji lineage, and the \"Book of Equanimity\" (1223) by Wansong Xingxiu of the Caodong lineage.\n\nThese texts became classic gōng'àn cases, together with verse and prose commentaries, which crystallized into the systematized gōng'àn (koan) practice. According to Miura and Sasaki, \"[I]t was during the lifetime of Yüan-wu's successor, Dahui Zonggao (大慧宗杲; 1089–1163) that Koan Chan entered its determinative stage.\"\nGōng'àn practice was prevalent in the Linji school, to which Yuanwu and Dahui belonged, but it was also employed on a more limited basis by the Caodong school.\n\nThe recorded encounter dialogues, and the koan collections which derived from this genre, mark a shift from solitary practice to interaction between master and student:\n\nThis mutual enquiry of the meaning of the encounters of masters and students of the past gave students a role model:\n\nThe Caodong was the other school to survive into the Song period. Its main protagonist was Hung-chih Cheng-chueh, a contemporary of Dahui Zonggao. It put emphasis on \"silent illumination\", or \"just sitting\". This approach was attacked by Dahui as being mere passivity, and lacking emphasis on gaining insight into one's true nature. Cheng-chueh in his turn criticized the emphasis on koan study.\n\nThe Yuan dynasty was the empire established by Kublai Khan, the leader of the Borjigin clan, after the Mongol Empire conquered the Jin dynasty (1115–1234) and the Southern Song Dynasty. Chan began to be mixed with Pure Land Buddhism as in the teachings of Zhongfeng Mingben (1263–1323).\n\nChan Buddhism enjoyed something of a revival in the Ming dynasty, with teachers such as Hanshan Deqing (憨山德清), who wrote and taught extensively on both Chan and Pure Land Buddhism; Miyun Yuanwu (密雲圓悟), who came to be seen posthumously as the first patriarch of the Ōbaku school of Zen; and as Yunqi Zhuhong (雲棲祩宏) and Ouyi Zhixu (蕅益智旭).\n\nChan was taught alongside Pure Land Buddhism in many monasteries. In time much of the distinction between them was lost, and many masters taught both Chan and Pure Land.\n\nWith the downfall of the Ming, several Chan masters fled to Japan, founding the Ōbaku school.\n\nIn the beginning of the Qing dynasty, Chan was \"reinvented\", by the \"revival of beating and shouting practices\" by Miyun Yuanwu (1566–1642), and the publication of the \"Wudeng yantong\" (\"The strict transmission of the five Chan schools\") by Feiyin Tongrong's (1593–1662), a dharma heir of Miyun Yuanwu. The book placed self-proclaimed Chan monks without proper Dharma transmission in the category of \"lineage unknown\" (\"sifa weixiang\"), thereby excluding several prominent Caodong monks.\n\nAround 1900, Buddhists from other Asian countries showed a growing interest in Chinese Buddhism. Anagarika Dharmapala visited Shaghai in 1893, intending \"to make a tour of China, to arouse the Chinese Buddhists to send missionaries to India to restore Buddhism there, and then to start a propaganda throughout the whole world\", but eventually limiting his stay to Shanghai. Japanese Buddhist missionaries were active in China in the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nThe modernisation of China led to the end of the Chinese Empire, and the installation of the Republic of China, which lasted on the mainland until the Communist Revolution and the installation of the People's Republic of China in 1949.\n\nAfter further centuries of decline during the Qing, Chan was revived again in the early 20th century by Hsu Yun (虛雲), a well-known figure of 20th-century Chinese Buddhism. Many Chan teachers today trace their lineage to Hsu Yun, including Sheng-yen (聖嚴) and Hsuan Hua (宣化), who have propagated Chan in the West where it has grown steadily through the 20th and 21st century.\n\nThe Buddhist reformist Taixu propagated a Chan-influenced humanistic Buddhism, which is endorsed by Jing Hui, former abbott of Bailin Monastery.\n\nUntil 1949, monasteries were built in the Southeast Asian countries, for example by monks of Guanghua Monastery, to spread Chinese Buddhism. Presently, Guanghua Monastery has seven branches in the Malay Peninsula and Indonesia.\n\nChan was repressed in China during the recent modern era in the early periods of the People's Republic, but subsequently had been re-asserting itself on the mainland, and has a significant following in Taiwan and Hong Kong as well as among Overseas Chinese.\n\nSince the Chinese economic reform of the 1970s, a new revival of Chinese Buddhism is going on. Ancient Buddhist temples, such as Bailin Monastery and Guanghua Monastery have been refurbished.\n\nBailin Monastery was ruined long before 1949. In 1988, Jing Hui was persuaded to take over the Hebei Buddhist Association, and start rebuilding the Monastery. Jing Hui is a student and dharma successor of Hsu Yun, but has also adopted the Humanistic Buddhism of Taixu.\n\nGuanghua Monastery was restored beginning in 1979, when a six-year restoration program began under the supervision of then 70-year-old Venerable Master Yuanzhou (圆拙老法师). In 1983 the temple became one of the Chinese Buddhism Regional Temples (汉族地区全国重点寺院) whilst 36-year-old Master Yiran (毅然法師) became abbot. The same year, Venerable Master Yuanzhou funded the establishment of the new Fujian Buddhism Academy (福建佛学院) on the site.\n\nSeveral Chinese Buddhist teachers left China during the Communist Revolution, and settled in Hong Kong and Taiwan.\n\nSheng Yen (1930–2009) was the founder of the Dharma Drum Mountain, a Buddhist organization based in Taiwan. During his time in Taiwan, Sheng Yen was well known as one of the progressive Buddhist teachers who sought to teach Buddhism in a modern and Western-influenced world.\n\nWei Chueh (1928–2016) was born in Sichuan, China, and ordained in Taiwan. In 1982, he founded Lin Quan Temple in Taipei County and became known for his teaching on Ch'an practices by offering many lectures and seven-day Ch'an retreats. His order is called Chung Tai Shan.\n\nTwo additional traditions emerged in the 1960s, based their teaching on Ch'an practices.\n\nCheng Yen (born 1937), a Buddhist nun, founded the Tzu Chi Foundation as a charity organization with Buddhist origins on 14 May 1966 in Hualien, Taiwan. She was inspired by her master and mentor, the late Venerable Master Yin Shun (印順導師, Yìn Shùn dǎoshī) a proponent of Humanistic Buddhism, who exhorted her to \"work for Buddhism and for all sentient beings\". The organisation began with a motto of \"instructing the rich and saving the poor\" as a group of thirty housewives who donated a small amount of money each day to care for needy families.\n\nHsing Yun (born 1927), founded the Fo Guang Shan an international Chinese Buddhist new religious movement based in Taiwan in 1967. The order promotes Humanistic Buddhism. Fo Guang Shan also calls itself the International Buddhist Progress Society. The headquarters of Fo Guang Shan, located in Dashu District, Kaohsiung, is the largest Buddhist monastery in Taiwan. Hsing Yun's stated position within Fo Guang Shan is that it is an \"amalgam of all Eight Schools of Chinese Buddhism\" (), including Chan. Fo Guang Shan is the most comprehensive of the major Buddhist organizations of Taiwan, focusing extensively on both social works and religious engagement.\n\nIn Taiwan, these four masters are popularly referred to as the \"Four Heavenly Kings\" of Taiwanese Buddhism, with their respective organizations Dharma Drum Mountain, Chung Tai Shan, Tzu Chi, and Fo Guang Shan being referred to as the \"Four Great Mountains\".\n\nAccording to traditional accounts of Vietnam, in 580 an Indian monk named Vinītaruci () travelled to Vietnam after completing his studies with Sengcan, the third patriarch of Chinese Chan. This, then, would be the first appearance of Thiền Buddhism. Other early Thiền schools included that of Wu Yantong (), which was associated with the teachings of Mazu Daoyi, and the Thảo Đường (Caodong), which incorporated nianfo chanting techniques; both were founded by Chinese monks.\n\nSeon was gradually transmitted into Korea during the late Silla period (7th through 9th centuries) as Korean monks of predominantly Hwaeom () and East Asian Yogācāra () background began to travel to China to learn the newly developing tradition. Seon received its most significant impetus and consolidation from the Goryeo monk Jinul (知訥) (1158–1210), who established a reform movement and introduced kōan practice to Korea. Jinul established the Songgwangsa (松廣寺) as a new center of pure practice.\n\nZen was not introduced as a separate school in Japan until the 12th century when Eisai traveled to China and returned to establish a Linji lineage, which is known in Japan as the Rinzai. In 1215, Dōgen, a younger contemporary of Eisai's, journeyed to China himself, where he became a disciple of the Caodong master Rujing. After his return, Dōgen established the Sōtō school, the Japanese branch of Caodong.\n\nThe schools of Zen that currently exist in Japan are the Sōtō, Rinzai and Ōbaku. Of these, Sōtō is the largest and Ōbaku the smallest. Rinzai is itself divided into several subschools based on temple affiliation, including Myōshin-ji, Nanzen-ji, Tenryū-ji, Daitoku-ji, and Tōfuku-ji.\n\nIn the 20th century, during the First Buddhist revival, missionaries were sent to Indonesia and Malaysia. Ashin Jinarakkhita, who played a central role in the revival of Indonesian Buddhism, received ordination as a Chan śrāmaṇera on July 29, 1953 and received the name Ti Zheng (Te Cheng) from bhikṣu Ben Qing.\n\nChan has become especially popular in its Japanese form. Although it is difficult to trace when the West first became aware of Chan as a distinct form of Buddhism, the visit of Soyen Shaku, a Japanese Zen monk, to Chicago during the 1893 Parliament of the World's Religions is often pointed to as an event that enhanced its profile in the Western world. It was during the late 1950s and the early 1960s that the number of Westerners pursuing a serious interest in Zen, other than the descendants of Asian immigrants, reached a significant level.\n\nThe first Chinese master to teach Westerners in North America was Hsuan Hua, who taught Chan and other traditions of Chinese Buddhism in San Francisco during the early 1960s. He went on to found the City Of Ten Thousand Buddhas, a monastery and retreat center located on a 237-acre (959,000 m²) property near Ukiah, California, founding the Dharma Realm Buddhist Association. Another Chinese Chan teacher with a Western following is Sheng-yen, a master trained in both the Caodong and Linji schools. He first visited the United States in 1978 under the sponsorship of the Buddhist Association of the United States, and subsequently founded the CMC Chan Meditation Center in Queens, New York and the Dharma Drum Retreat Center in Pine Bush, New York.\n\nFo Guang Shan is a Taiwan-based new religious movement with branches worldwide. It belongs to the Chan school; its founder, Hsing Yun, is a Linji lineage holder.\n\nThough Zen-narrative states that it is a \"special transmission outside scriptures\" which \"did not stand upon words\", Zen does have a rich doctrinal background.\n\nClassical Chinese Chan is characterised by a set of polarities: absolute-relative, Buddha-nature – sunyata, sudden and gradual enlightenment, esoteric and exoteric transmission.\n\nThe Prajnaparamita sutras and Madhyamaka emphasize the non-duality of form and emptiness: \"form is emptiness, emptiness is form\", as the \"Heart sutra\" says. This was understood to mean that ultimate reality is not a transcendental realm, but equal to the daily world of relative reality. This idea fitted into the Chinese culture, which emphasized the mundane world and society. But this does not tell how the absolute is present in the relative world. This question is answered in such schemata as the Five Ranks of Tozan, the Ten Bulls (\"the Oxherding Pictures\"), and Hakuin's Four ways of knowing.\n\nThe Madhyamaka two truths doctrine and the Yogacara three natures and Trikaya doctrines also give depictions of the interplay between the absolute and the relative.\n\nWhen Buddhism was introduced in China it was understood in native terms. Various sects struggled to attain an understanding of the Indian texts. The \"Tathāgatagarbha sūtras\" and the idea of the Buddha-nature were endorsed because of the perceived similarities with the Tao, which was understood as a transcendental reality underlying the world of appearances. Śūnyatā at first was understood as pointing to the Taoist \"wu\".\n\nThe doctrine of the Buddha-nature asserts that all sentient beings have Buddha-nature (Skt. \"Buddhadhātu\", \"Buddha Element\", \"Buddha-Principle\"), the element from which awakening springs. The \"Tathāgatagarbha sutras\" state that every living being has the potential to realize awakening. Hence Buddhism offers salvation to every-one, not only to monks or those who have freed themselves almost completely from karma in previous lives. The Yogacara theory of the Eight Consciousnesses explains how sensory input and the mind create the world we experience, and obscure the alaya-vijnana, which is equated to the Buddha-nature.\n\nWhen this potential is realized, and the defilements have been eliminated, the Buddha-nature manifests as the Dharmakaya, the absolute reality which pervades everything in the world. In this way, it is also the primordial reality from which phenomenal reality springs. When this understanding is idealized, it becomes a transcendental reality beneath the world of appearances.\n\nSunyata points to the \"emptiness\" or no-\"thing\"-ness of all \"things\". Though we perceive a world of concrete and discrete objects, designated by names, on close analysis the \"thingness\" dissolves, leaving them \"empty\" of inherent existence. The \"Heart sutra\", a text from the prajñaparamita sutras, articulates this in the following saying in which the five skandhas are said to be \"empty\":\n\nYogacara explains this \"emptiness\" in an analysis of the way we perceive \"things\". Everything we conceive of is the result of the working of the five skandhas—results of perception, feeling, volition, and discrimination. The five skandhas together compose consciousness. The \"things\" we are conscious of are \"mere concepts\", not noumenon.\n\nIt took Chinese Buddhism several centuries to recognize that śūnyatā is not identical to \"wu\", nor does Buddhism postulate a permanent soul. The influence of those various doctrinal and textual backgrounds is still discernible in Zen. Zen teachers still refer to Buddha-nature, but the Zen tradition also emphasizes that Buddha-nature \"is\" śūnyatā, the absence of an independent and substantial self.\n\nIn Zen Buddhism two main views on the way to enlightenment are discernible, namely sudden and gradual enlightenment.\n\nEarly Chan recognized the \"transcendence of the body and mind\", followed by \"non-defilement [of] knowledge and perception\", or sudden insight into the true nature (\"jiànxìng\") followed by gradual purification of intentions.\n\nIn the 8th century Chan history was effectively refashioned by Shenhui, who created a dichotomy between the so-called East Mountain Teaching or \"Northern School\", led by Yuquan Shenxiu, and his own line of teaching, which he called the \"Southern school\". Shenhui placed Huineng into prominence as the sixth Chan-patriarch, and emphasized \"sudden enlightenment\", as opposed to the concurrent Northern School's alleged \"gradual enlightenment\". According to the \"sudden enlightenment\" propagated by Shenhui, insight into true nature is sudden; thereafter there can be no misunderstanding anymore about this true nature.\n\nIn the \"Platform Sutra\", the dichotomy between sudden and gradual is reconciled. Guifeng Zongmi, fifth-generation successor to Shenhui, also softened the edge between sudden and gradual. In his analysis, sudden awakening points to seeing into one's true nature, but is to be followed by a gradual cultivation to attain Buddhahood.\n\nThis gradual cultivation is also recognized by Dongshan Liangjie (Japanese \"Tōzan\"), who described the five ranks of enlightenment.\n\nAccording to Borup the emphasis on 'mind to mind transmission' is a form of esoteric transmission, in which \"the tradition and the enlightened mind is transmitted face to face\". Metaphorically this can be described as the transmission from a flame from one candle to another candle, or the transmission from one vein to another. In exoteric transmission requires \"direct access to the teaching through a personal discovery of one's self. This type of transmission and identification is symbolized by the discovery of a shining lantern, or a mirror.\"\n\nChan is deeply rooted in the teachings and doctrines of Mahāyāna Buddhism. What the Chan tradition emphasizes is that enlightenment of the Buddha came not through intellectual reasoning, but rather through self-realization in Dharma practice and meditation. Therefore, it is held that it is primarily through Dharma practice and meditation that others may attain enlightenment and become Buddhas as well.\n\nA review of the early historical documents and literature of early Chan masters clearly reveals that they were all well versed in numerous Mahāyāna Buddhist sūtras. For example, in the \"Platform Sūtra of the Sixth Patriarch\", Huineng cites and explains the \"Diamond Sūtra\", the \"Lotus Sūtra\" (\"Saddharma Puṇḍarīka Sūtra\"), the \"Vimalakīrti Nirdeśa Sūtra\", the \"Śūraṅgama Sūtra\", and the \"Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra\".\n\nThe Chan school had to develop a doctrinal tradition of its own to establish its position. Subsequently, the Chan tradition produced a rich corpus of written literature which has become a part of its practice and teaching. Among the earliest and most widely studied of the specifically Chan texts, dating to at least the 9th century CE, is the \"Platform Sūtra of the Sixth Patriarch\", attributed to Huineng. The most important Chan texts belong to the \"encounter dialogue\" genre, which developed into various collections of \"kōans\".\n\nAs a school of Mahāyāna Buddhism, Chan draws many of its basic driving concepts from that tradition, such as the Bodhisattva ideal. Karuṇā is the counterpart of prajna. Avalokiteśvara embodies the striving for Karuna, compassion.\n\nCentral to Chan practice is dhyana or meditation. In the Lin-ji (Rinzai) school this is supplemented with koan study.\n\nIn meditation practice, the Chan tradition holds that the very notions of doctrine and teachings create various other notions and appearances (Skt. \"saṃjñā\"; Ch. 相, \"xiāng\") that obscure the transcendent wisdom of each being's Buddha-nature. The process of rediscovery goes under various terms such as \"introspection\", \"a backward step\", \"turning-about\" or \"turning the eye inward\".\n\nSitting meditation is called \"zuòchán\" (坐禅), \"zazen\" in Japanese, both simply meaning \"sitting dhyāna\". During this sitting meditation, practitioners usually assume a position such as the lotus position, half-lotus, Burmese, or seiza postures. To regulate the mind, awareness is directed towards counting or watching the breath, or put in the energy center below the navel (see also anapanasati). Often, a square or round cushion placed on a padded mat is used to sit on; in some other cases, a chair may be used.\n\nAt the beginning of the Song Dynasty, practice with the koan method became popular, whereas others practiced \"silent illumination.\" This became the source of some differences in practice between the Linji and Caodong traditions.\n\nA koan (literally \"public case\") is a story or dialogue, generally related to Chan or other Buddhist history; the most typical form is an anecdote involving early Chinese Chan masters. These anecdotes involving famous Chan teachers are a practical demonstration of their wisdom, and can be used to test a student's progress in Chan practice. Koans often appear to be paradoxical or linguistically meaningless dialogues or questions. But to Chan Buddhists the koan is \"the place and the time and the event where truth reveals itself\" unobstructed by the oppositions and differentiations of language. Answering a koan requires a student to let go of conceptual thinking and of the logical way we order the world, so that, like creativity in art, the appropriate insight and response arises naturally and spontaneously in the mind.\n\nChan developed a distinct monastic system.\n\nAs the Chan school grew in China, the monastic discipline also became distinct, focusing on practice through all aspects of life. Temples began emphasizing labor and humility, expanding the training of Chan to include the mundane tasks of daily life. D.T. Suzuki wrote that aspects of this life are: a life of humility; a life of labor; a life of service; a life of prayer and gratitude; and a life of meditation. The Chinese Chan master Baizhang (720–814 CE) left behind a famous saying which had been the guiding principle of his life, \"A day without work is a day without food\".\n\nIt was scholar D.T. Suzuki's contention that a spiritual awakening was always the goal of Chan's training, but that part of what distinguished the tradition as it developed through the centuries in China was a way of life radically different from that of Indian Buddhists. In Indian Buddhism, the tradition of the mendicant prevailed, but Suzuki explained that in China social circumstances led to the development of a temple and training-center system in which the abbot and the monks all performed mundane tasks. These included food gardening or farming, carpentry, architecture, housekeeping, administration (or community direction), and the practice of Traditional Chinese medicine. Consequently, the enlightenment sought in Chan had to stand up well to the demands and potential frustrations of everyday life.\n\n\n\nModern classics\n\nClassic history\n\nCritical Zen-studies\n\nOversight\n\nOverview of Chan centers\n\nSpecific Chan centers\n\nTexts\n\nHistory\n\nCritical Chan Research\n"}

Zilberman (Russian: ; May 25, 1938, Odessa – July 25, 1977, Boston) was a Russian-American philosopher and sociologist, scholar of Indian philosophy and culture.\nWell-versed in the study of language, he knew Russian, Sanskrit, English, French, Slavic languages, German.\n\nDavid Zilberman was born in Odessa, Ukraine on May 25, 1938, to Benjamin Zilberman, an engineer-economist, and Riva Timaner, a doctor. He graduated high school in 1955. In 1962, Zilberman was awarded an engineering and meteorology degree from The Odessa State College of Meteorology. From 1962 until 1966, Zilberman was employed as a meteorologist at the local airport in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan, in Central Asia.\n\nZilberman began his Indological studies in 1962. He met and became friends with the academician , a medical doctor, a Sanskritist, and a leading theosopher in Russia. Zilberman studied Sanskrit under Smirnov while pursuing Indological investigations in logic, Indian yoga, and ritual. In Turkmenistan he also studied a number of languages in addition to Sanskrit, including Greek, Latin, basic Romano-Germanic languages, and some Slavic languages, and he began writing philosophical essays.\n\nIn 1966 Zilberman returned to Odessa. He continued with his philosophical investigations on his own and participated in the Colloquium for Philosophy & History at Odessa State University (organized by Professor Director of the Department of Philosophy). In 1968 he completed a two-year program at the State Institute of Patent Service. During that period, Zilberman worked at the Odessa State College of Meteorology performing research. And he worked for a time at a Construction & Development firm for the Black Sea Fleet as a Patent Lawyer.\n\nIn 1968 Zilberman was introduced to Professor Georgy Schedrovitsky who headed the Moscow School of Methodology. Schedrovitsky recommended Zilberman to one of Russia's leading sociologists, Professor Yuri Levada, for the post-graduate program at the Institute for Concrete Sociological Research (IKSI) in Moscow. Zilberman participated in the organized by Levada Methodological seminar which united supporters of many different scientific areas and was for a long time considered a semi-legal institution. Zilberman was also a participating member of the Moscow School of Methodology. Participants in the Moscow School seminars included: Alexander Zinoviev, Evald Ilyenkov, Georgy Schedrovitsky, Alexander Piatigorsky, Merab Mamardashvili, Lefebvre, Boris Grushin, Oleg Genisaretsky and others. The School was believed by some to be the source of the most important developments in philosophy in the post-War period, rivaling anything done in the Western analytical tradition. The Moscow School of Methodology remains virtually unknown in the West.\n\nDuring these years Zilberman translated numerous Hindu and Buddhist texts, poetic abstracts from \"The Mahabharata\", and part of the Tattva-Cintamani tetralogy from Sanskrit. He wrote articles on Indian philosophy, on sociology and anthropology, and on the sociological theory of tradition, a largely overlooked topic in modern social science.\n\nZilberman worked closely with Alexander Piatigorsky, writing a number of articles for \"The Great Soviet Encyclopedia\". After leaving the USSR they remained close friends and continued their collaborative research and publication efforts until Zilberman's death in July 1977.\n\nZilberman's dissertation, \"A Study of Tradition\", became a major project and the focus of his efforts during his final years in the Soviet Union. Completed in 1972, the work was accepted but remained unpublished due to the unexpected and sudden Soviet suppression of sociological and related research (an event described in Zilberman's \"Post-Sociological Society\"). The IKSI was closed and it essentially disappeared. Its members were forced to operate behind the Iron Curtain in a context of severely limited public visibility and without proper scientific recognition under conditions of heightened Soviet-style repression.\n\nIn 1972, as he completed his research and wrote his thesis, Zilberman discovered a new type of methodological-philosophical thinking \"unlike the known types\" which became his central preoccupation for the rest of his life. He called the new method \"Modal Methodology.\"\n\nIn 1972, due to an offer accepted by Zilberman to publish an article about Kabbalah abroad, he reportedly became a target of KGB surveillance. Leaving Moscow, Zilberman returned again to Odessa. To earn a living he undertook numerous translations for the Moscow Patriarchy, translating much of the \"Oxford Theological Dictionary\" from English to Russian, as well as the \"History of French Royal Court\" from French.\n\nZilberman translated into Russian the book by D. Ingalls \"Navya-Nyāya Logic\" and wrote an introductory section to the work dealing with some epistemological aspects of Indian formal logic. The book was published in 1974 in Moscow but without his name.\n\nIn 1973, David Zilberman and his family emigrated to the United States. In 1973 Zilberman received a position as a Visiting Assistant Professor in the Department of Anthropology at Hunter College in New York. In September 1974, Zilberman accepted a position as Post-doctoral Fellow with the Committee on South Asian Studies at the University of Chicago.\n\nFor the last two years of his life Zilberman taught at Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts, first in the Department of Anthropology, and later in the Department of Philosophy and History of Ideas. Zilberman taught a variety of courses in Indian and Western philosophy, and related disciplines.\n\nMeanwhile, Zilberman started a book dedicated to thorough research and analysis of the Russian Soviet Philosophy (the manuscript titled \"Moscow School of Methodology\" was left unfinished).\n\nDavid Zilberman died on July 1977 in a car-bicycle collision while returning home from his last seminar with his students at Brandeis.\n\nHis wife Elena Michnik-Zilberman lives in Florida, the younger daughter Alexandra Curtis lives in New York, the older daughter Natalya Carney lives in Boston. His sister Rachel Zilberman lives in Chicago.\n\nDavid Zilberman created a distinctive type of methodological-philosophical thinking, which he called \"Modal Methodology\" or \"Modal Metaphysics\", and through this practice defined the \"Sum of the Metaphysics\".\n\nZilberman attempted to develop the Philosophia Universalis from classical Hindu philosophies and applied it as a new synthesis to Western philosophy.\n\nSome contemporary Russian philosophers consider themselves to be David Zilberman followers.\n\nZilberman's archive is saved in the Special Collections of the Mugar Memorial Library.

The Pagoda was inaugurated by Pratibha Patil, then President of India on 8 February 2009. It is built on donated land on a peninsula between Gorai creek and the Arabian Sea. The pagoda is to serve as a monument of peace and harmony. The Global Vipassana Pagoda has been built out of gratitude to Sayagyi U Ba Khin (1899 - 1971), Vipassana teacher and the first Accountant-General of Independent Burma, who was instrumental in Vipassana returning to India, the country of its origin.\n\nBuilt entirely through voluntary donations, the purpose of the Global Vipassana Pagoda is to: 1) share information about Vipassana, and 2) remove misconceptions about the Gotama the Buddha and his teachings. \"The Buddha did not teach Buddhism. During his lifetime, he did not convert a single person to Buddhism\", said the late Principal Vipassana Teacher S.N.Goenka (whose idea it was to build the Global Vipassana Pagoda), in his article 'Why the Vipassana Pagoda'.\"One will be surprised to hear this and will not want to believe it, because we have been hearing, speaking, reading and writing contrary to this fact for such a long time. But the historical truth is that the Buddha neither taught Buddhism nor made any person a Buddhist.\" Vipassana is the practical quintessence of the universal, non-sectarian teachings of the Buddha.\n\nIts traditional Burmese design is an expression of gratitude towards the country of Myanmar for preserving the practice of Vipassana. The shape of the pagoda is a copy of the Shwedagon Pagoda (Golden Pagoda) in Yangon, Myanmar. It was built combining ancient Indian and modern technology to enable it to last for a thousand years.\n\nThe center of the Global Vipassana Pagoda contains the world's largest stone dome built without any supporting pillars. The height of the dome is approximately 29 metres, while the height of the building is 96.12 meters, which is twice the size of the previously largest hollow stone monument in the world, the Gol Gumbaz Dome in Bijapur, India. The external diameter of the largest section of the dome is 97.46 m and the shorter sections is 94.82m. The internal diameter is 85.15 m. The inside of the pagoda is hollow and serves as a very large meditation hall with an area covering more than 6000 m (65,000 ft). The massive inner dome seats over 8000 people enabling them to practice the non-sectarian Vipassana meditation as taught by S. N. Goenka and now being practiced in over 100 countries. An inaugural one-day meditation course was held at the pagoda on 21 December 2008, with Goenka in attendance as the teacher.\n\nTen-day vipassana meditation courses are held free of charge at the Dhamma Pattana meditation centre that is part of the Global Vipassana Pagoda complex.\n\nPlanning for the construction of the Global Vipassana Pagoda began in 1997, while actual building work started in 2000.\nThe pagoda consists of three sub-domes. The first and largest dome was completed in October 2006 when bone relics of Gotama Buddha were enshrined in the central locking stone of the dome on 29 October 2006, making it the world's largest structure containing relics of the Buddha. The relics were originally found in the stupa at Bhattiprolu, Guntur district, Andhra Pradesh, South India. They have been donated by the Mahabodhi Society of India and the prime minister of Sri Lanka to be kept at the Global Vipassana Pagoda. The second and third domes sit atop the first dome. Construction of the third dome was structurally completed on 21 November 2008.\n\nThe Global Vipassana Pagoda complex is an evolving construction. A museum depicts the historical life and non-sectarian teaching of Gotama the Buddha. The Global Vipassana Pagoda's educational displays communicate the Buddha's teaching of the universal practice of Vipassana as a path towards real happiness.\n\nThe Global Vipassana Pagoda complex consists of the following structures:\n\nThe south pagoda contains 108 meditation cells for use by Vipassana students taking a meditation course at the adjoining meditation centre.\n\nThe foundation of the dome consists of basalt, while the dome itself is made from sandstone brought from Rajasthan. The individual blocks of sandstone weigh 600–700 kg each and are kept in place due to the unique design of the bricks. Each of the bricks interlock with the ones adjacent to it and lime mortar is used to fill in any remaining gaps. The circumambulation path is laid in marble.\n\nThe pinnacle of the pagoda is adorned with a large crystal. The spire is covered in real gold, while the rest of the pagoda is covered in gold paint. The spire is topped with a special ornamental umbrella piece donated by the Burmese. The main doors to the pagoda are wooden and hand-carved in Myanmar (Burma).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "40937008", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40937008", "title": "History of Tibetan Buddhism", "text": "History of Tibetan Buddhism\n\nBuddhism was first actively disseminated in Tibet from the 7th to the 9th century CE, predominantly from India, but also influenced by Chinese Buddhism. During the \"Era of Fragmentation\" (9th–10th centuries), Buddhism waned in Tibet, only to rise again in the 11th century. With the Mongol invasion of Tibet in the 13th century and the establishment of the Mongol Yuan dynasty, Tibetan Buddhism spread beyond Tibet to Mongolia and China. From the 14th to the 20th Tibetan Buddhism was patronized by the Chinese Ming dynasty (1368–1644) and the Qing dynasty (1644–1912).\n\nThe Gelugpa school, founded by Je Tsongkhapa (1357–1419), rose to (political) prominence under Ngawang Lobsang Gyatso (1617–1682), the 5th Dalai Lama, who invited the Mongols to intervene in the Tibetan civil war. The Mongols invested him with the political power of Tibet, leading to the dominanance of the Gelugpa until the 20th century. In the 19th century the Rimé movement provided a counter-weight against this dominance, trying to preserve the teachings of the Nyingma, Kagyu and Sakya schools.\n\nIn the early 20th century Tibet acquired \"de facto\" independence from China, which ended again with the Chinese invasion of 1950 and the ensuing exodus of Tibetans. Today, Tibetan Buddhism is still adhered to in the Tibetan Plateau and surrounding regions, while it has also attracted a considerable interest in the western world.\nAccording to tradition, in the reign of King Thothori Nyantsen (5th century), a basket of Buddhist scriptures arrived in Tibet from India.\n\nSanskrit Buddhist scriptures from Nepal & India were first translated into Tibetan under the reign of the Tibetan king Songtsän Gampo (618-649), who established the Tibetan Empire. While there is doubt about the level of Songtsän Gampo's interest in Buddhism, it is known that he married a Chinese Tang Dynasty Buddhist princess, Wencheng, who came to Tibet with a statue of Shakyamuni Buddha. It is clear from Tibetan sources that some of his successors became ardent Buddhists. The records show that Chinese Buddhists were actively involved in missionary activity in Tibet, but they did not have the same level of imperial support as Indian Buddhists, with tantric lineages from Bihar and Bengal.\n\nAccording to a Tibetan legendary tradition, Songtsän Gampo also married a Nepalese Buddhist princess, Bhrikuti. By the second half of the 8th century he was already regarded as an embodiment of the Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara.\n\nIn the 8th century Buddhism really took hold in Tibet. The successors of Songtsän Gampo were less enthusiastic about the propagation of Buddhism, but in the 8th century King Trisong Detsen (755–797) established it as the official religion of the state.\n\nTrisong Detsen invited Indian Buddhist scholars to his court, and Tibetan Buddhists today trace their oldest spiritual roots to the Indian masters Padmasambhāva (8th century) and Śāntarakṣita (725–788), who founded the Nyingma, \"The Ancient Ones\", the oldest school of Tibetan Buddhism. According to Tibetan tradition, Padmasambhāva wrote a number of important scriptures, some of which he hid for future \"tertons\" to find; these Terma \"treasures\" (revealed texts) are of particular significance to the Nyingma school.\n\nAt this early time also, from the south came the influence of scholars under the Pāla dynasty in the Indian state of Magadha. They had achieved a blend of Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna that has come to characterize all forms of Tibetan Buddhism. Their teaching in sutra centered on the \"Abhisamayālankāra\", a 4th-century Yogācārin text, but prominent among them were the Mādhyamika scholars Śāntarakṣita and Kamalaśīla.\n\nA third influence was that of the Sarvāstivādins from Kashmir to the southwest and Khotan to the northwest. Although they did not succeed in maintaining a presence in Tibet, their texts found their way into the Tibetan Buddhist canon, providing the Tibetans with almost all of their primary sources about what they regarded to be the Hinayana. A subsect of this school, Mūlasarvāstivāda was the source of the Tibetan vinaya.\n\nThe Chinese princess Jincheng Gongzhu () (?–739), known in Tibet as Kim-sheng, and a devout Buddhist, was sent to Tibet in 710 where she married Mes-ag-tshoms. Buddhist monks from Khotan (Li), fleeing the persecutions of an anti-Buddhist king, were given refuge by Kim-sheng about 737. Kim-sheng died during an outbreak of smallpox sometime between 739 and 741, and anti-Buddhist factions in Tibet began to blame the epidemic on the support of Buddhism by the king and queen. This forced the monks to flee once again; first to Gandhara, and then to Kosambi in central India where the monks apparently ended up quarrelling and slaughtering each other.\n\nTibetan king \"Trisong Detsen\" (742–797) invited the Chan master Moheyan to transmit the Dharma at Samye Monastery. According to Tibetan sources, Moheyan lost the socalled council of Lhasa (793), a debate sponsored by Trisong Detsen on the nature of emptiness with the Indian master Kamalaśīla, and the king declared Kamalaśīlas philosophy should form the basis for Tibetan Buddhism. However, a Chinese source found in Dunhuang written by Mo-ho-yen says their side won, and some scholars conclude that the entire episode is fictitious.\n\nPioneering Buddhologist Giuseppe Tucci speculated that Mohayen's ideas were preserved by the Nyingmapas in the form of dzogchen teachings. John Myrdhin Reynolds and Sam van Schaik reject this possibility. According to Reynolds, \"Except for a brief flirtation with Ch'an in the early days of Buddhism in Tibet in the eighth century, the Tibetans exhibited almost no interest at all in Chinese Buddhism, except for translating a few Sutras from Chinese for which they did not possess Indian originals.\"\nFrom the outset Buddhism was opposed by the native shamanistic Bön religion, which had the support of the aristocracy, but it thrived under royal patronage, reaching a peak under King Rälpachän (r. 817–836). Terminology in translation was standardised around 825, enabling a highly literal translation methodology.\n\nA reversal in Buddhist influence began under King Langdarma (r. 836–842), and his death was followed by the socalled \"Era of Fragmentation\", a period of Tibetan history in the 9th and 10th centuries. During this era, the political centralization of the earlier Tibetan Empire collapsed. The period was dominated by rebellions against the remnants of imperial Tibet and the rise of regional warlords. Upon the death of Langdarma, the last emperor of a unified Tibetan empire, a civil war ensued, which effectively ended centralized Tibetan administration until the Sa-skya period. Ösung's allies managed to keep control of Lhasa, and Yumtän was forced to go to Yalung, where he established a separate line of kings.\n\nThe late 10th and 11th century saw a revival of Buddhism in Tibet. Coinciding with the early discoveries of \"hidden treasures\" (\"terma\"), the 11th century saw a revival of Buddhist influence originating in the far east and far west of Tibet. In the west, Rinchen Zangpo (958-1055) was active as a translator and founded temples and monasteries. Prominent scholars and teachers were again invited from India.\n\nIn 1042 Atiśa (982–1054 CE) arrived in Tibet at the invitation of a west Tibetan king. This renowned exponent of the Pāla form of Buddhism from the Indian university of Vikramashila later moved to central Tibet. There his chief disciple, Dromtonpa founded the Kadampa school of Tibetan Buddhism, under whose influence the New Translation schools of today evolved.\n\nThe Sakya, the \"Grey Earth\" school, was founded by Khön Könchok Gyelpo (, 1034–1102), a disciple of the great Lotsawa, Drogmi Shākya (). It is headed by the Sakya Trizin, traces its lineage to the mahasiddha Virūpa, and represents the scholarly tradition. A renowned exponent, Sakya Pandita (1182–1251CE), was the great-grandson of Khön Könchok Gyelpo.\n\nOther seminal Indian teachers were Tilopa (988–1069) and his student Naropa (probably died ca. 1040 CE).The Kagyu, the \"Lineage of the (Buddha's) Word\", is an oral tradition which is very much concerned with the experiential dimension of meditation. Its most famous exponent was Milarepa, an 11th-century mystic. It contains one major and one minor subsect. The first, the Dagpo Kagyu, encompasses those Kagyu schools that trace back to the Indian master Naropa via Marpa Lotsawa, Milarepa and Gampopa\n\nTibetan Buddhism exerted a strong influence from the 11th century CE among the peoples of Inner Asia, especially the Mongols. Tantric-style Tibetan Buddhism was possibly first spread to the Mongols via the Tangut state of Western Xia (1038–1227). Buddhists entered the service of the Mongol Empire in the early 13th century. Buddhist monasteries established in Karakorum were granted tax exempt status, though the religion was not given official status by the Mongols until later.\n\nThe Mongols invaded Tibet in 1240. The Mongols withdrew their soldiers from Tibet in 1241, and returned to the region in 1244, when Köten delivered an ultimatum, summoning the abbot of Sakya (\"Kun-dga' rGyal-mtshan\") to be his personal chaplain, on pains of a larger invasion were he to refuse. Sakya Paṇḍita took almost 3 years to obey the summons and arrive in Kokonor in 1246, and met Prince Köten in Lanzhou the following year. The Mongols had annexed Amdo and Kham to the east, and appointed Sakya Paṇḍita Viceroy of Central Tibet by the Mongol court in 1249. \n\nTibet was incorporated into the Mongol Empire, retaining nominal power over religious and regional political affairs, while the Mongols managed a structural and administrative rule over the region, reinforced by the rare military intervention.\n\nTibetan Buddhism was adopted as the \"de facto\" state religion by the Mongol Yuan dynasty (1271–1368), founded by Kublai Khan, that also ruled China.\n\nAll variants of Buddhism, such as Chinese, Tibetan and Indian Buddhism flourished, though Tibetan Buddhism was eventually favored at the imperial level under emperor Möngke (1209-1259), who appointed Namo from Kashmir as chief of all Buddhist monks. The top-level department and government agency known as the Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs (Xuanzheng Yuan) was set up in Khanbaliq (modern-day Beijing) to supervise Buddhist monks throughout the empire. The Sakya Imperial Preceptors were active at the Yuan court and enjoyed special power. During this period Tibetan Buddhism was practiced not only within the capital Beijing and the Tibetan Plateau, but throughout the country. For instance, Hangzhou, capital of the former Southern Song dynasty and the largest city in the Yuan realm, became an important hub of the activities of Tibetan Buddhism, which took public or official precedence over Han Chinese Buddhism. Similarly, Mount Wutai, the sacred site of Bodhisattva Manjusri and the holy mountain of Chinese Buddhist pilgrims, was greatly influenced by Tibetan Buddhism.\n\nAmong the ruling class of the Mongol khanates of the Golden Horde (1240s–1502) and the Ilkhanate (1256–1335/1353), the two western khanates of the Mongol Empire, Shamanism and Buddhism were once the dominant religions, as in the Yuan dynasty. In the early days, the rulers of both khanates increasingly adopted Tibetan Buddhism, like the Yuan dynasty at that time. However, the Mongol rulers Ghazan of the Ilkhanate and Uzbeg of the Golden Horde converted to Islam in AD 1295 and AD 1313 respectively. The Yuan dynasty based in China and Mongolia became the only division of the Mongol Empire not to embrace Islam, instead favoring Tibetan Buddhism until its demise.\n\nWith the decline of the Yuan dymansty, Central Tibet was to ruled by successive families from the 14th to the 17th century, and Tibet would be de facto independent from the mid-14th century on, for nearly 400 years.\n\nJangchub Gyaltsän (Byang chub rgyal mtshan, 1302–1364) became the strongest political family in the mid 14th century. Military hostilities ended in 1354 with Jangchub Gyaltsän as the unquestioned victor, who established the Phagmodrupa Dynasty in that year. He continued to rule central Tibet until his death in 1364, although he left all Mongol institutions in place as hollow formalities. Power remained in the hands of the Phagmodru family until 1434.\n\nThe rule of Jangchub Gyaltsän and his successors implied a new cultural self-awareness where models were sought in the age of the ancient Tibetan Kingdom. The relatively peaceful conditions favoured the literary and artistic development. During this period the reformist scholar Je Tsongkhapa (1357–1419) founded the Gelug sect which would have a decisive influence on Tibet's history.\n\nInternal strife within the Phagmodrupa dynasty, and the strong localism of the various fiefs and political-religious factions, led to a long series of internal conflicts. The minister family Rinpungpa, based in Tsang (West Central Tibet), dominated politics after 1435.\n\nIn 1565 the Rinpungpa family was overthrown by the Tsangpa Dynasty of Shigatse which expanded its power in different directions of Tibet in the following decades and favoured the Karma Kagyu sect. They would play a pivotal role in the events which led to the rise of power of the Dalai Lama's in the 1640s.\n\nIn spite of the weakening of central authority, the neighbouring Ming Dynasty of China (1368–1644) made little effort to impose direct rule, although it had nominal claims of the Tibetan territory by establishing the U-Tsang Regional Military Commission and Do-Kham Regional Military Commission in the 1370s. Tibetan Buddhism was patronized by the ethnic-Chinese Ming dynasty that succeeded the Yuan, and kept friendly relations with some of the Buddhism religious leaders known as Princes of Dharma and granted some other titles to local leaders including the Grand Imperial Tutor.\n\nThe Ming dynasty (1368–1644) rulers deliberately helped propagate Tibetan Buddhism instead of Chinese Buddhism among the Mongols. During the early period of the Northern Yuan dynasty (1368-ca.1636), shamanism once again became the sole dominant religion in Mongolia, but the last sixty years before the death of the last khan Ligdan Khan (1588-1643) were marked by intensive penetration of Tibetan Buddhism into Mongolian society. In 1578, Sonam Gyatso was invited to Mongolia and converted Altan Khan to Buddhism along with his tribe (the first Mongol tribe to be so converted). Altan Khan conferred the title \"Dalai\" on him, \"Dalai\" being the Mongolian translation of his Tibetan name \"Gyatso\", which means \"sea\" or \"ocean\". This is the origin of the title Dalai Lama. The Ming assisted Altan Khan (1507–1582), King of the Tümed Mongols, when he requested aid in propagating Lamaism. Within 50 years nearly all the Mongols had become Buddhists, including tens of thousands of monks, almost all followers of the Gelug school and loyal to the Dalai Lama. Since then Tibetan Buddhism has played a very important role among the Mongols.\n\nTibetan Buddhism was the most important religion among the Mongols under Qing rule (1635–1912), as well as the state religion of the Kalmyk Khanate (1630–1771), the Dzungar Khanate (1634–1758) and the Khoshut Khanate (1642–1717). Tibetan Buddhism was also adored by the Qing court (1644–1912) since both Mongols and Tibetans believed in Tibetan Buddhism.\n\nSome historians view the promotion of Lamaist Buddhism among the Mongols by the Ming and Qing as a deliberate plot to weaken the Mongol's military prowess, but others reject the theory.\n\nThe \"Ganden Phodrang\" was the Tibetan regime or government that was established by the 5th Dalai Lama with the help of the Güshi Khan of the Khoshut in 1642. After the civil war in the 17th century and the Mongol intervention, the Gelugpa school dominated Tibetan Buddhism, and successive Dalai Lamas ruled Tibet from the mid-17th to mid-20th centuries.\n\nThe rise of the Dalai Lama's was intimately connected with the military power of Mongolian clans. Altan Khan, the king of the Tümed Mongols, first invited Sonam Gyatso, the head of the Gelugpa school of Tibetan Buddhism (later known as the third Dalai Lama), to Mongolia in 1569 and again in 1578, during the reign of the Tsangpa family. Gyatso accepted the second invitation. They met at the site of Altan Khan's new capital, Koko Khotan (Hohhot), and the Dalai Lama taught a huge crowd there.\n\nSonam Gyatso publicly announced that he was a reincarnation of the Tibetan Sakya monk Drogön Chögyal Phagpa (1235–1280) who converted Kublai Khan, while Altan Khan was a reincarnation of Kublai Khan (1215–1294), the famous ruler of the Mongols and Emperor of China, and that they had come together again to cooperate in propagating the Buddhist religion. While this did not immediately lead to a massive conversion of Mongols to Buddhism (this would only happen in the 1630s), it did lead to the widespread use of Buddhist ideology for the legitimation of power among the Mongol nobility. Last but not least, Yonten Gyatso, the fourth Dalai Lama, was a grandson of Altan Khan.\n\nSonam Choephel (1595–1657 CE), the first regent of the fifth Dalai Lama, was \"the prime architect of the Gelug's rise to power\". Sonam Choephel requested the aid of Güshi Khan, a powerful Dzungar military leader to end decades of clan-wars in Dbus and Gtsang privinces, and the Tibetan civil war of 1639-1642. Güshi Khan (who was head of the Khoshut tribe) conquered Kham in 1640 bringing the Sakyas and the lords of Kham and Amdo under their control. His victory over Karma Tenkyong, the prince of Tsang in Shigatse, in 1642, completed the military unification of the country and the establishment of the Khoshut Khanate. By this feat the Phagmodrupa Dynasty, which was associated with a variant of the Kagyu school, was technically replaced; in actual fact it had been powerless for many years. By subsequently formally recognizing the Fifth Dalai Lama's authority in 1642, Güshi Khan effectively made Gyatso the temporal ruler of all Tibet.\n\nThe Qing dynasty (1644–1912) established their rule over Tibet after a Qing expedition force defeated the Dzungars in 1720, and lasted until the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1912. The Qing emperors appointed imperial residents known as the Ambans to Tibet, who commanded over 2,000 troops stationed in Lhasa and reported to the Lifan Yuan, a Qing government agency that oversaw the region during this period. The rulers of the Manchu Qing dynasty supported Tibetan Buddhism, especially the Gelug sect, for most of their dynasty.\n\nThe Rimé movement was a movement involving the Sakya, Kagyu and Nyingma schools of Tibetan Buddhism, along with some Bon scholars. Having seen how the Gelug institutions pushed the other traditions into the corners of Tibet's cultural life, Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo (1820–1892) and Jamgön Kongtrül (1813–1899) compiled together the teachings of the Sakya, Kagyu and Nyingma, including many near-extinct teachings. Without Khyentse and Kongtrul's collecting and printing of rare works, the suppression of Buddhism by the Communists would have been much more final. The Rimé movement is responsible for a number of scriptural compilations, such as the \"Rinchen Terdzod\" and the \"Sheja Dzö\".\n\nIn 1912 Tibet became de facto independent again, but was annexed by the Chinese People's republic in 1950. In 1959 the 14th Dalai Lama and a great number of clergy fled the country, to settle in India and other neighbouring countries. This also started the spread of Tibetan Buddhism to western countries, resulting in worldwide communities of Tibetan Buddhism.\n\nToday, Tibetan Buddhism is adhered to widely in the Tibetan Plateau, Mongolia, northern Nepal, Kalmykia (on the north-west shore of the Caspian), Siberia (Tuva and Buryatia), the Russian Far East and northeast China. It is the state religion of Bhutan. The Indian regions of Sikkim and Ladakh, both formerly independent kingdoms, are also home to significant Tibetan Buddhist populations, as are the Indian states of Himachal Pradesh (which includes Dharamshala and the district of Lahaul-Spiti), West Bengal (the hill stations of Darjeeling and Kalimpong) and Arunachal Pradesh.\n\nIn the wake of the Tibetan diaspora, Tibetan Buddhism has gained adherents in the West and throughout the world. Fully ordained Tibetan Buddhist Monks now work in academia (for example Ven. Alex Bruce ('Tenpa')). The 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, has traveled the world and spoken about the welfare of Tibetans, environment, economics, women's rights, non-violence, interfaith dialogue, physics, astronomy, Buddhism and science, cognitive neuroscience, reproductive health, and sexuality, along with various Mahayana and Vajrayana topics. He received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "894495", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=894495", "title": "Holy door", "text": "Holy door\n\nA Holy Door () is traditionally an entrance portal located within the Papal major basilicas in Rome. The doors are normally sealed by mortar and cement from the inside so that they cannot be opened. They are ceremoniously opened during Jubilee years designated by the Pope, for pilgrims who enter through those doors may piously gain the plenary indulgences attached with the Jubilee year celebrations.\n\nIn October 2015, Pope Francis broke with tradition in having each Roman Catholic diocese throughout the world designate one or more local Holy Doors during the Extraordinary Jubilee of Mercy, so that Catholics could gain the plenary indulgences granted during the Jubilee year without having to travel to Rome.\n\nPope Boniface VIII began the tradition of the Holy Year, known as a Jubilee, in 1300 and the Catholic Church has celebrated them every 25 years or so ever since. A major part of the Holy Year for Catholics is a pilgrimage to Rome and the ritual passing over the threshold of the holy door to symbolise the passing into the presence of God. At the same time, remission of the temporal punishment for the pilgrims' sins is granted, known as an indulgence.\n\nOne of the earliest accounts of the Holy Year dates back to a Spanish historian, traveler and pilgrim called Pedro Tafur in 1437. Tafur connects the Jubilee indulgence with the right of sanctuary for those who had escaped persecution. He also noted its existence in pagan times for all who crossed the threshold of the \"Puerta Tarpea\" previously upon the site of the Archbasilica of St. John Lateran. Accordingly, at the request of Emperor Constantine I, Pope Sylvester I published a Papal Bull proclaiming the same immunity from punishment for Christian sinners who took sanctuary there. The privilege, however, was quickly abused and at some point was even commercialised resulting in popes consequently ordering the door to be sealed with a wall, only to be unsealed during Jubilee years. The wall was destroyed and the door opened once in a hundred years. This was later reduced to fifty years and now \"opened at the will of the Pope.\" \n\nIn 1450, the Florentine merchant Giovanni Rucellai of Viterbo cites that the first Jubilee door was opened in 1423 under the pontificate of Pope Martin V.\n\nRucellai, who lived at the time also speaks of the five doors of the Lateran basilica:\n\nPope Alexander VI expanded the rite of the Jubilee year of 1500 by opening other doors in Saint Peter's Basilica, Basilica of Saint Mary Major and the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls. This jubilee year began on Christmas day and ended on the Feast of the Epiphany 1501. During the reign of Pope John VII the holy doors were opened every 33 years, reflecting the number of years attributed to the lifespan of Jesus Christ. This was later amended to 50 years in commemoration of the Hebrew custom of Jubilees and later changed to a centenary or at any time at the will of the reigning Pontiff.\n\nBetween 1500 and 1974, the entrance portal was barricaded by a solid wall, not an actual door. The popes themselves began the ritual destruction of these walls followed by masons who completed the actual task demolishing it. This describes a rite that has nearly always supplied the principal subject depicted upon the long series of Jubilee medals issued by the numerous Popes who have opened and closed the holy door at the beginning and end of each Jubilee year. Each of the four basilicas has its own holy door.\n\nAfter closing the Holy Year on Christmas day 1950 Pope Pius XII replaced the wooden doors installed by Pope Benedict XIV in 1748, which had begun to fall into disrepair, with the 16-panelled bronze doors (carved by Vico Consorti and cast by Ferdinando Marinelli Artistic Foundry) that are seen today.\n\nIn John 10:9, Jesus is quoted as saying, \"I am the gate. Whoever enters through me will be saved.\" In Luke 11:9 is found, \"\"And I tell you, ask and you will receive; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.\" Revelations 3:20 says, \"Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, (then) I will enter his house and dine with him, and he with me.\" Dom Albert Hammenstede O.S.B. noted that Porter was one of the minor orders. Herbert Thurston suggests that \"the symbolism of this ceremony may also have been influenced by the old idea of seeking sanctuary.\"\n\nIn the papal bull, \"Incarnationis mysterium\" of November 29, 1998 Pope John Paul II formally announced the Great Jubilee of 2000 saying that the Holy Door \"\"evokes the passage from sin to grace\". The Holy Door represents \"a ritual expression of conversion\".\n\n\"A Holy Door ...is a visual symbol of internal renewal, which begins with the willing desire to make peace with God, reconcile with your neighbors, restore in yourself everything that has been damaged in the past, and reshape your heart through conversion.\"\n\nIn 1975, Pope Paul VI, in light of the modernising changes of the Second Vatican Council revised the rite by removing the use of trowel and ornate bricks at the closing rite.\n\nPope John Paul II further simplified the ceremony for the Great Jubilee of 2000 for safety reasons; previously, debris had fallen on Pope Paul VI while striking down the door. Workers had removed the concrete before the ceremony of the opening of the door so that the Pope only had to push on the doors with his hands. The holy door of St. Peter's Basilica was opened by the Pope on 24 December 1999 while the doors of St. John Lateran and St. Mary Major were opened on 25 December and 1 January, respectively. Breaking with tradition, the Pope opened both of these personally, rather than delegating this to a cardinal. The doors of Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls were opened in an ecumenical ceremony on 18 January, first day of the World Week of Prayer for Christian Unity by the Pope, the Archbishop of Canterbury and a representative of the Ecumenical Patriarch. The door in St. Peter's was closed on 6 January 2001, with the others being closed one day earlier.\n\nUntil the Great Jubilee of 2000, the Pope knocked upon the door three times with a silver hammer, singing the versicle \"Open unto me the gates of justice\". Above the holy door in St. Peter's are marble memorial plates commemorating the last two times that the door has been opened. Since John Paul II held the last two Jubilees, both plates indicate that he opened and closed the door.\n\nIn announcing the Extraordinary Jubilee of Mercy Pope Francis declared, \"The Holy Door will become a Door of Mercy through which anyone who enters will experience the love of God who consoles, pardons, and instills hope.\" On December 8, 2015, Pope Francis opened the Holy Door of Mercy in the Basilica of St. Peter, marking the official start of the Jubilee Year of Mercy. A few days later, he presided at the opening of the Holy Door at the Archbasilica of St John Lateran. The Holy Door at St Paul’s “Outside-the-Walls” was opened by the Archpriest of that Basilica, Cardinal James Harvey. Pope Francis later opened the Holy Door at St Mary Major and at the Caritas center near Rome’s central train station.\n\nFrancis broke with tradition in removing the necessity of traveling to Rome. In October 2015, a temporal privilege was extended by Pope Francis through the Papal bull of Indiction, \"Misericordiae Vultus\" for an ordinary bishop to designate his own Holy Door for the purpose of the \"Jubilee Year of Mercy\". Holy Doors were to be designated in every diocese throughout the world, and could be located at the diocesan Cathedral or at other popular church shrines. On November 29, 2015, prior to the official December 8 start of the Jubilee Year of Mercy, Pope Francis opened the Holy Door at the Cathédrale Notre-Dame in Bangui, Central African Republic. Holy Doors were subsequently opened in 40 different countries around the world, including locations such as Westminster Cathedral, Prinknash Abbey in Gloucestershire, and St. Paul's Basilica in Toronto.\n\nThe following is a list of Holy Doors designated in perpetuity by the Holy See. \n\n\n\n"}

Adelman was the recipient of numerous awards and grants, and presented the inaugural lecture in a series named in his honor at York University in 2008.\n\nHoward Adelman was born January 7, 1938, in Toronto, Ontario. He earned a B.A. (1960), M.A. (1963), and Ph.D. (1971) in philosophy from the University of Toronto, and was a member of the faculty at York University in Toronto from 1966 until his retirement in 2003. As a nineteen-year-old philosophy student, Adelman was hired in 1958 by the Campus Co-operative to meet a growing need for student housing at the University of Toronto. With Adelman's advice, Campus Co-op acquired additional properties and formed Co-operative College Residences Inc., a non-profit offshoot. Later, while a lecturer in philosophy at the University of Toronto (1963–1964) and assistant professor at York University (1966–1970), Adelman was one of the principal founders of Rochdale College, an experimental \"free university\" organized on the cooperative principle of its British namesake. After obtaining federal mortgages at well below market rates, Campus Co-op incorporated Rochdale College in 1964. An energetic and entrepreneurial spirit with boundless imagination and a playful sense of humor, at that time Adelman was prone to saying he \"teaches at the University of Toronto and studies at Rochdale.\"\n\nAdelman was the founder and director of York's Centre for Refugee Studies (1988–1993) and for ten years he was editor of Canada's periodical on refugees, \"Refuge\" until 1993.\n\nAdelman served in many university positions at York University, including acting dean of Atkinson College, two terms as director of the graduate program in philosophy, and chair of the Department of Philosophy at York University.

Whereas the Japanese concept of \"haragei\" denotes a deliberate form of nonverbal communication, \"ishin-denshin\" refers to a passive form of shared understanding. \"Ishin-denshin\" is traditionally perceived by the Japanese as sincere, silent communication via the heart or belly (i.e. symbolically from the inside, \"uchi\"), as distinct from overt communication via the face and mouth (the outside, \"soto\"), which is seen as being more susceptible to insincerities. The introduction of this concept to Japan (via China) is related to the traditions of Zen Buddhism, where the term \"ishin-denshin\" refers to direct mind transmission. Zen Buddhism tradition, in turn, draws the concept of \"ishin-denshin\" from the first Dharma transmission between Gautama Buddha and Mahākāśyapa in the Flower Sermon.\n\n\"Ishin-denshin\", or non-verbal communication, continues to influence aspects of contemporary Japanese culture and ethics, ranging from business practices to end-of-life care.\n\n"}

{"id": "768209", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=768209", "title": "King Wen sequence", "text": "King Wen sequence\n\nThe King Wen sequence () is an arrangement of the sixty-four divination figures in 易經 Yì Jīng, the I Ching or Book of Changes. They are called \"hexagrams\" in English because each figure is composed of six 爻 yáo—broken or unbroken lines, that represent 陰 yin or 陽 yang respectively.\n\nThe King Wen sequence is also known as the \"received\" or \"classical\" sequence because it is the oldest surviving arrangement of the hexagrams. Its true age and authorship are unknown. Traditionally, it is said that 周文王 Zhōu Wén Wáng (King Wen) arranged the hexagrams in this sequence while imprisoned by 商紂王 Shāng Zhòu Wáng in the 12th century BC. A different arrangement, the \"binary sequence\" named in honor of the mythic culture hero 伏羲 Fú Xī, originated in the Song Dynasty. It is believed to be the work of scholar 邵雍 Shào Yōng (1011–1077 AD). As mirrored by the 先天 Earlier Heaven and 後天 Later Heaven arrangements of the eight trigrams, or 八卦 bā guà, it was customary to attribute authorship to these legendary figures. Of the two hexagram arrangements, the King Wen sequence is, however, of much greater antiquity than the Fu Xi sequence.\n\nThe 64 hexagrams are grouped into 32 pairs. For 28 of the pairs, the second hexagram is created by turning the first upside down (i.e. 180° rotation). The exception to this rule is for the 8 symmetrical hexagrams that are the same after rotation (1 & 2, 27 & 28, 29 & 30, 61 & 62). Partners for these are given by inverting each line: solid becomes broken and broken becomes solid. These are indicated with icons in the table below.\n\nGiven the mathematical constraints of these simple rules, the number of lines that change within pair partners will always be even (either 2, 4, or 6). Whereas the number of lines that change \"between\" pairs depends on how the pairs are arranged, and the King Wen Sequence has notable characteristics in this regard. Of the 64 transitions, exactly 48 of them are even changes (32 within-pairs plus 16 between-pairs) and 16 are odd changes (all between-pairs). This is a precise 3 to 1 ratio of even to odd transitions. Of the odd transitions, 14 are changes of three lines and 2 are changes of one line. Changes of five are absent. Each transition within a pair appears to be the correlating opposite of the other transition within the pair.\n\nThe I Ching book was traditionally split up in two parts with the first part covering the first 30 hexagrams of the King Wen sequence and the second part with the remaining 34. The reason for this was not mentioned in the classic commentaries but was explained in later Yuan dynasty commentaries: 8 hexagrams are the same when turned upside down and the other 56 present a different hexagram if inverted. This allows the hexagrams to be displayed succinctly in two equal columns or rows of 18 unique hexagrams each; half of the 56 invertible hexagrams plus the 8 non-invertible.\n\nOver the centuries there were many attempts to explain this sequence. Some basic elements are obvious: each symbol is paired with an \"upside-down\" neighbor, except for 1, 27, 29, and 61 which are \"vertically\" symmetrical and paired with \"inversed\" neighbors.\n\nA combinatorial mathematical basis was explained for the first time in 2006.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "342912", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=342912", "title": "Meditations on First Philosophy", "text": "Meditations on First Philosophy\n\nMeditations on First Philosophy in which the existence of God and the immortality of the soul are demonstrated () is a philosophical treatise by René Descartes first published in Latin in 1641. The French translation (by the Duke of Luynes with Descartes' supervision) was published in 1647 as \"Méditations Métaphysiques\". The title may contain a misreading by the printer, mistaking \"animae immortalitas\" for \"animae immaterialitas\", as suspected by A. Baillet.\n\nThe book is made up of six meditations, in which Descartes first discards all belief in things that are not absolutely certain, and then tries to establish what can be known for sure. He wrote the meditations as if he had meditated for six days: each meditation refers to the last one as \"yesterday\". (In fact, Descartes began work on the \"Meditations\" in 1639.) One of the most influential philosophical texts ever written, it is widely read to this day.\n\nThe book consists of the presentation of Descartes' metaphysical system in its most detailed level and in the expanding of his philosophical system, first introduced in the fourth part of his \"Discourse on Method\" (1637). Descartes' metaphysical thought is also found in the \"Principles of Philosophy\" (1644), which the author intended to be a philosophy guidebook.\n\nLetter of dedication\n\n\"To the most wise and illustrious the Dean and Doctors of the Sacred Faculty of Theology in Paris\"\n\nDescartes says that he is asking the protection of the Faculty for his work, and to this end he writes the present dedication.\n\nHis first consideration is that the existence of God has to be demonstrated philosophically, besides the theological reasons for belief, particularly if we consider to make a demonstration for the non-believers. Moreover, the believers could be accused of making a circular reasoning, when saying that we must believe in God because of the Scriptures, and in the authority of the Scriptures because they have been inspired by God. He further indicates how the very Scriptures say that the mind of man is sufficient to discover God.\n\nHis aim is to apply a method to demonstrate these two truths, in a so clear and evident manner that result to be evident. This method he has developed for the Sciences.\n\nPreface to the reader\n\nDescartes explains how he made a mention of the two questions, the existence of God, and the soul, in his \"Discourse on Method\". Following this, he received objections, and two of them he considers are of importance. The first is how he concludes that the essence of the soul is a thing that thinks, excluding all other nature. To this he says that he has a clear perception that he is a thinking thing, and has no other clear perception, and from this he concludes that there is nothing else in the essence of the self.\n\nThe second is that from the idea I have of something that is more perfect than myself, it cannot be concluded that it exists. In the treatise we will see that in fact from the idea that there is something more perfect than myself, it follows that this exists.\n\nIt goes on to comment that on a general level the reasoning used by the atheists for denying the existence of God is based in the fact that \"we ascribe to God affections that are human, or we attribute so much strength and wisdom to our minds\" that we presume to understand that which God can and ought to do. He says that we have to consider God as incomprehensible and infinite, and our minds as limited and finite.\n\nFinally says that the treatise was submitted to some men of learning to know their difficulties and objections, and are answered at the end of it.\n\nThe First Meditation, subtitled \"What can be called into doubt\", opens with the Meditator reflecting on the number of falsehoods he has believed during his life and on the subsequent faultiness of the body of knowledge he has built up from these falsehoods. He has resolved to sweep away all he thinks he knows and to start again from the foundations, building up his knowledge once more on more certain grounds. He has seated himself alone, by the fire, free of all worries so that he can demolish his former opinions with care.\n\nThe Meditator reasons that he need only find some reason to doubt his present opinions in order to prompt him to seek sturdier foundations for knowledge. Rather than doubt every one of his opinions individually, he reasons that he might cast them all into doubt if he can doubt the foundations and basic principles on which the opinions are founded.\n\nEverything that the Meditator has accepted as most true he has come to learn from or through his senses. He acknowledges that sometimes the senses can deceive, but only with respect to objects that are very small or far away, and that our sensory knowledge on the whole is quite sturdy. The Meditator acknowledges that insane people might be more deceived, but that he is clearly not one of them and needn't worry himself about that.\n\nHowever, the Meditator realizes that he is often convinced when he is dreaming that he is sensing real objects. He feels certain that he is awake and sitting by the fire, but reflects that often he has dreamed this very sort of thing and been wholly convinced by it. Though his present sensations may be dream images, he suggests that even dream images are drawn from waking experience, much like paintings in that respect. Even when a painter creates an imaginary creature, like a mermaid, the composite parts are drawn from real things—women and fish, in the case of a mermaid. And even when a painter creates something entirely new, at least the colors in the painting are drawn from real experience. Thus, the Meditator concludes, though he can doubt composite things, he cannot doubt the simple and universal parts from which they are constructed like shape, quantity, size, time, etc. While we can doubt studies based on composite things, like medicine, astronomy, or physics, he concludes that we cannot doubt studies based on simple things, like arithmetic and geometry.\n\nOn further reflection, the Meditator realizes that even simple things can be doubted. Omnipotent God could make even our conception of mathematics false. One might argue that God is supremely good and would not lead him to believe falsely all these things. But by this reasoning we should think that God would not deceive him with regard to anything, and yet this is clearly not true. If we suppose there is no God, then there is even greater likelihood of being deceived, since our imperfect senses would not have been created by a perfect being.\n\nThe Meditator finds it almost impossible to keep his habitual opinions and assumptions out of his head, try as he might. He resolves to pretend that these opinions are totally false and imaginary in order to counterbalance his habitual way of thinking. The Meditator wishes to avoid an excess of skepticism and instead uses a skeptical method, an important distinction. He supposes that not God, but some evil demon has committed itself to deceiving him so that everything he thinks he knows is false. By doubting everything, he can at least be sure not to be misled into falsehood by this demon.\n\nBefore retiring for the night, the Meditator indulges in his old beliefs, afraid to awake to a life of confusion. As a result he allows for the tempting falsehoods to continue unabridged. \n\nDescartes saw his Meditations as providing the metaphysical underpinning of his new physics. Like Galileo, he sought to overturn what he saw as two-thousand-year-old prejudices injected into the Western tradition by Aristotle. The Aristotelian thought of Descartes' day placed a great weight on the testimony of the senses, suggesting that all knowledge comes from the senses. The Meditator's suggestion that all one's most certain knowledge comes from the senses is meant to appeal directly to the Aristotelian philosophers who will be reading the Meditations. The motivation, then, behind the First Meditation is to start in a position the Aristotelian philosophers would agree with and then, subtly, to seduce them away from it. Descartes is aware of how revolutionary his ideas are, and must pay lip service to the orthodox opinions of the day in order to be heeded.\n\nReading the First Meditation as an effort to coax Aristotelians away from their customary opinions allows us to read different interpretations into the different stages of doubt. For instance, there is some debate as to whether Descartes intended his famous \"Dream Argument\" to suggest the universal possibility of dreaming—that though there is waking experience, I can never know which moments are dreams and which are waking—or the possibility of a universal dream—that my whole life is a dream and that there is no waking world. If we read Descartes as suggesting the universal possibility of dreaming, we can explain an important distinction between the Dream Argument and the later \"Evil Demon Argument\". The latter suggests that all we know is false and that we cannot trust the senses one bit. The Dream Argument, if meant to suggest the universal possibility of dreaming, suggests only that the senses are not always and wholly reliable. The Dream Argument questions Aristotelian epistemology, while the Evil Demon Argument does away with it altogether. The \"Painter's Analogy\", which draws on the Dream Argument, concludes that mathematics and other purely cerebral studies are far more certain than astronomy or physics, which is an important step away from the Aristotelian reliance on the senses and toward Cartesian rationalism.\n\nRead on its own, the First Meditation can be seen as presenting skeptical doubts as a subject of study in their own right. Certainly, skepticism is a much discussed and hotly debated topic in philosophy, even today. Descartes raised the mystifying question of how we can claim to know with certainty anything about the world around us. The idea is not that these doubts are probable, but that their possibility can never be entirely ruled out. And if we can never be certain, how can we claim to know anything? Skepticism cuts straight to the heart of the Western philosophical enterprise and its attempt to provide a certain foundation for our knowledge and understanding of the world. It can even be pushed so far as to be read as a challenge to our very notion of rationality.\n\nIt is difficult to justify a dismissal of skepticism. Western philosophy since Descartes has been largely marked and motivated by an effort to overcome this problem. \nDescartes' doubt is a methodological and rational doubt. That is, the Meditator is not just doubting everything at random, but is providing solid reasons for his doubt at each stage. For instance, he rejects the possibility that he might be mad, since that would undercut the rationality that motivates his doubt. Descartes is trying to set up this doubt within a rational framework, and needs to maintain a claim to rationality for his arguments to proceed.\nHe goes on to suggest more powerful reasons to doubt that his beliefs are true. In general, his method is that of forming skeptical hypotheses — methodic doubt. In the first meditation, he considers whether he is mad, dreaming, or deceived by an evil demon.\n\nThe general form of these arguments is:\n\nDescartes' goal — as stated at the beginning of the meditation — is to suspend judgment about any belief that is even slightly doubtful. The skeptical scenarios show that all of the beliefs he considers in the first meditation—including, at the very least, all his beliefs about the physical world, are doubtful. So he decides to suspend judgment. He will henceforth give up all of his beliefs about the physical world. He also decides to continually remind himself to avoid habitually falling into accepting beliefs without support, a habit to which he is susceptible.\n\nIn \"Meditation II\", Descartes lays out a pattern of thought, sometimes called representationalism, in response to the doubts forwarded in \"Meditation I\". He identifies five steps in this theory:\n\nDescartes argues that this representational theory disconnects the world from the mind, leading to the need for some sort of bridge to span the separation and provide \"good reasons\" to believe that the ideas accurately represent the outside world. The first plank he uses in constructing this bridge can be found in the following excerpt:\nI have convinced myself that there is nothing in the world — no sky, no earth, no minds, no bodies. Doesn't it follow that I don't exist? No, surely I must exist if it's me who is convinced of something. But there is a deceiver, supremely powerful and cunning whose aim is to see that I am always deceived. But surely I exist, if I am deceived. Let him deceive me all he can, he will never make it the case that I am nothing while I think that I am something. Thus having fully weighed every consideration, I must finally conclude that the statement \"I am, I exist\" must be true whenever I state it or mentally consider it. (Descartes, Meditation II: On the Nature of the Human Mind, Which Is Better Known Than the Body).\nIn other words, one's consciousness implies one's existence. In one of Descartes' replies to objections to the book, he summed this up in the phrase, \"I think therefore I am\".\n\nOnce he secures his existence, however, Descartes seeks to find out what \"I\" is. He rejects the typical method, which looks for a definition (e.g., Rational Animal), because the words used in the definition would then need to be defined. He seeks \"simple terms\" that do not need to be defined in this way, but whose meaning can just be \"seen\". From these \"self-evident\" truths, \"complex terms\" can be built up.\n\nThe first of these self-evident truths is Descartes' proof of existence turned on its head:\nBut what then am I? A thinking thing. And what is that? Something that doubts, understands, affirms, denies, wills, refuses, and also senses and has mental images. (Descartes, Meditation II: On the Nature of the Human Mind, Which Is Better Known Than the Body).\nTo define himself further, Descartes turns to the example of wax. He determines that wax isn't wax because of its color, texture or shape, as all of these things can change and the substance still be wax. He believes that wax is perceived \"by the intellect alone\" (Meditation II: On the Nature of the Human Mind, Which Is Better Known Than the Body). Therefore, he distinguishes between \"ordinary perception\" and \"judgment\". When one understands the mathematical principles of the substance, such as its expansion under heat, figure and motion, the knowledge of the wax can be \"clear and distinct\".\n\nIf a substance such as wax can be known in this fashion, then the same must be of ourselves. The self, then, is not determined by what we sense of ourselves — these hands, this head, these eyes — but by simply the things one thinks. Thus, one \"can't grasp anything more easily or plainly than [his] mind\".\n\nDescartes concludes that he exists because he is a \"thinking thing\". If he is the thing that can be deceived and can think and have thoughts, then he must exist.\n\nDescartes proposed that there are three types of ideas: Innate, Fictitious, and Adventitious. Innate ideas are and have always been within us, fictitious or invented ideas come from our imagination, and Adventitious ideas come from experiences of the world. He argues that the idea of God is Innate and placed in us by God, and he rejected the possibility that the idea of God is Invented or Adventitious.\n\nArgument 1\n\n\nArgument 2\n\nDescartes argued that he had a clear and distinct idea of God. In the same way that the cogito was self-evident, so too is the existence of God, as his perfect idea of a perfect being could not have been caused by anything less than a perfect being.\n\nThe conclusions of the previous Meditations that \"I\" and \"God\" both exist lead to another problem: If God is perfectly good and the source of all that is, how is there room for error or falsehood? Descartes attempts to answer this question in \"Meditation IV: On Truth and Falsity\".\nIf I've got everything in me from God and He hasn't given me the ability to make errors, it doesn't seem possible for me ever to be in error. (Descartes, Meditation IV: On Truth and Falsity).\nThe framework of his arguments center on the Great Chain of Being, in which God's perfect goodness is relative to His perfect being. On the extreme opposite end of the scale is complete nothingness, which is also the most evil state possible. Thus, humans are an intermediary between these two extremes, being less \"real\" or \"good\" than God, but more \"real\" and \"good\" than nothingness. Thus, error (as a part of evil) is not a positive reality, it is only the absence of what is correct. In this way, its existence is allowed within the context of a perfectly inerrant God.\nI find that I am \"intermediate\" between God and nothingness, between the supreme entity and nonentity. Insofar as I am the creation of the supreme entity, there's nothing in me to account for my being deceived or led into error, but, inasmuch as I somehow participate in nothing or nonentity — that is, insofar as I am distinct from the supreme entity itself and lack many things — it's not surprising that I go wrong. I thus understand that, in itself, error is a lack, rather than a real thing dependent on God. Hence, I understand that I can err without God's having given me a special ability to do so. Rather, I fall into error because my God-given ability to judge the truth is not infinite. (Descartes, Meditation IV: On Truth and Falsity).\nDescartes also concedes two points that might allow for the possibility of his ability to make errors. First, he notes that it is very possible that his limited knowledge prevents him from understanding \"why\" God chose to create him so he could make mistakes. If he could see the things that God could see, with a complete and infinite scope, perhaps he would judge his ability to err as the best option. He uses this point to attack the Aristotelian structure of causes. The final cause described by Aristotle are the \"what for\" of an object, but Descartes claims that because he is unable to comprehend completely the mind of God, it is impossible to understand completely the \"why\" through science — only the \"how\".\nI realize that I shouldn't be surprised at God's doing things that I can't explain. I shouldn't doubt His existence just because I find that I sometimes can't understand why or how He has made something. I know that my nature is weak and limited and that God's is limitless, incomprehensible, and infinite, and, from this, I can infer that He can do innumerable things whose reasons are unknown to me. On this ground alone, I regard the common practice of explaining things in terms of their purposes to be useless in physics: it would be foolhardy of me to think that I can discover God's purposes. (Descartes, Meditation IV: On Truth and Falsity).\nSecondly, he considers the possibility that an apparent error at the individual level could be understood within the totality of creation as error free.\nWhen asking whether God's works are perfect, I ought to look at all of them together, not at one isolation. For something that seems imperfect when viewed alone might seem completely perfect when regarded as having a place in the world. Of course, since calling everything into doubt, I haven't established that anything exists besides me and God. But, when I consider God's immense power, I can't deny that He has made — or, in any case, that He could have made — many other things, and I must therefore view myself as having a place in a universe. (Descartes, Meditation IV: On Truth and Falsity).\nLastly, \"Meditation IV\" attributes the source of error to a discrepancy between two divine gifts: understanding and free will. Understanding is given in an incomplete form, while will (by nature) can only be either completely given or not given at all. When he is presented with a certain amount of understanding and then \"chooses\" to act outside of that, he is in error. Thus, the gifts of God (understanding and will) both remain good and only the incorrect usage by him remains as error.\nIf I suspend judgement when I don't clearly and distinctly grasp what is true, I obviously do right and am not deceived. But, if I either affirm or deny in a case of this sort, I misuse my freedom of choice. If I affirm what is false, I clearly err, and, if I stumble onto the truth, I'm still blameworthy since the light of nature reveals that a perception of the understanding should always precede a decision of the will. In these misuses of freedom of choice lies the deprivation that accounts for error. And this deprivation, I maintain, lies in the working of the will insofar as it comes from me — not in my God-given ability to will, or even in the will's operation insofar as it derives from Him. (Descartes, Meditation IV: On Truth and Falsity).\n\"Meditation V: Concerning the Essence of Material Things, and Again Concerning God, That He Exists\" begins with the stated purpose of expanding the \"known items\" of God and self to include outside material objects; but Descartes saves that for \"Meditation VI\" in lieu of something he deems more fundamental but in the same direction: a discussion concerning the \"ideas\" of those external items. Along the way, he advances another logical proof of God's existence.\nBefore asking whether any such objects exist outside me, I ought to consider the ideas of these objects as they exist in my thoughts and see which are clear and which confused. (Descartes, Meditation V: On the Essence of Material Objects and More on God's Existence).\nDescartes separates external objects into those that are clear and distinct and those that are confused and obscure. The former group consists of the ideas of extension, duration and movement. These geometrical ideas cannot be misconstrued or combined in a way that makes them false. For example, if the idea of a creature with the head of a giraffe, the body of a lion and tail of a beaver was constructed and the question asked if the creature had a large intestine, the answer would have to be invented. But, no mathematical re-arrangement of a triangle could allow its three internal angles to sum to anything but 180 degrees. Thus, Descartes perceived that truths may have a nature or essence of themselves, independent of the thinker. (In Descartes' formulation, this is a \"mathematical\" truth only pragmatically related to nature; the properties of triangles in Euclidean geometry remain mathematically certain)\nI find in myself innumerable ideas of things which, though they may not exist outside me, can't be said to be nothing. While I have some control over my thoughts of these things, I do not make the things up: they have their own real and immutable natures. Suppose, for example, that I have a mental image of a triangle. While it may be that no figure of this sort does exist or ever has existed outside my thought, the figure has a fixed nature (essence or form), immutable and eternal, which hasn't been produced by me and isn't dependent of my mind. (Descartes, Meditation V: On the Essence of Material Objects and More on God's Existence).\nWhile thinking about the independence of these ideas of external objects, Descartes realizes that he is just as certain about God as he is about these mathematical ideas. He asserts that this is natural as the ideas of God are the only ideas that imply God's existence. He uses the example of a mountain and a valley. While one cannot picture a mountain without a valley, it's possible that these do not exist. However, the fact that one cannot conceive of God without existence inherently rules out the possibility of God's non-existence. Simply put, the argument is framed as follows:\n\nThis ontological argument originated in the work of St. Anselm, the medieval Scholastic philosopher and theologian. While Descartes had already claimed to have confirmed God's existence through previous arguments, this one allows him to put to rest any discontent he might have had with his \"distinct and clear\" criteria for truth. With a confirmed existence of God, all doubt that what one previously thought was real and not a dream can be removed. Having made this realization, Descartes asserts that without this sure knowledge in the existence of a supreme and perfect being, assurance of any truth is impossible.\n\nIn \"Meditation VI: Concerning the Existence of Material Things, and the Real Distinction between Mind and Body\", Descartes addresses the potential existence of material outside of the self and God. First, he asserts that such objects \"can\" exist simply because God is able to make them. Therefore, our assumption of the physical world outside of ourselves in non theoretical sense.\nInsofar as they are the subject of pure mathematics, I now know at least that they can exist, because I grasp them clearly and distinctly. For God can undoubtedly make whatever I can grasp in this way, and I never judge that something is impossible for Him to make unless there would be a contradiction in my grasping the thing distinctly. (Descartes, Meditation VI: On the Existence of Material Objects from Body).\nKnowing that the existence of such objects is possible, Descartes then turns to the prevalence of mental images as proof. To do this, he draws a distinction between imagination and understanding—imagination being a non-linguistic \"faculty of knowledge to the body which is immediately present to it [...] without intellection or conception,\" which therefore exists like a mental photograph; and understanding (or apprehending) being something that is not necessarily pictured. He uses an example of this to clarify:\nWhen I have a mental image of a triangle, for example, I don't just understand that it is a figure bounded by three lines; I also \"look at\" the lines as though they were present to my mind's eye. And this is what I call having a mental image. When I want to think of a chiliagon, I understand that it is a figure with a thousand sides as well as I understand that a triangle is a figure with three, but I can't imagine its sides or \"look\" at them as though they were present (...) Thus I observe that a special effort of mind is necessary to the act of imagination, which is not required to conceiving or understanding (ad intelligendum); and this special exertion of mind clearly shows the difference between imagination and pure intellection (imaginatio et intellectio pura). (Descartes, Meditation VI: On the Existence of Material Objects and the Real Distinction of Mind from Body).\nDescartes has still not given proof that such external objects exist. At this point, he has only shown that their existence could conveniently explain this mental process. To obtain this proof, he first reviews his premises for the \"Meditations\" — that the senses cannot be trusted and what he is taught \"by nature\" does not have much credence. However, he views these arguments within a new context; after writing \"Meditation I\", he has proved the existence of himself and of a perfect God. Thus, Descartes jumps quickly to proofs of the division between the body and mind and that material things exist:\n\nProof for the body being distinct from the mind\n\nProof of the reality of external material things\n\nAfter using these two arguments to dispel solipsism and skepticism, Descartes seems to have succeeded in defining reality as being in three parts: God (infinite), minds, and material things (both finite). He closes by addressing natural phenomena that might appear to challenge his philosophy, such as phantom limbs, dreams, and dropsy.\n\nDescartes submitted his manuscript to many philosophers, theologians and a logician before publishing the \"Meditations\". Their objections and his replies (many of which are quite extensive) were included in the first publication of the \"Meditations\". In the Preface to the Meditations, Descartes asks the reader \"not to pass judgment on the Meditations until they have been kind enough to read through all these objections and my replies to them.” Thus, this dialogue could be seen as an integral part of Descartes' views expressed in the \"Meditations\".\n\nThe seven objectors were, in order (of the sets as they were published):\n\nThey make many objections to Descartes’ arguments and method. Some of the objections show that the objector has misunderstood the text, or wilfully misquoted it, as in the last set of objections by the Jesuit. Descartes’ response to these is often dismissive and curt. Other objections are more powerful, and in some cases it is controversial whether Descartes responds to them successfully (refer to Hobbes' objections). At times Descartes' demeanor suggests that he expected no criticisms would be forthcoming.\n\nSome of the most powerful objections include the following:\n\nObjections to proof(s) of God’s existence:\n\nA. We have no (clear) idea of an infinite Being (1st, 2nd, and 5th objections).\n\nB. From the fact that I can think of a perfect being, it doesn’t follow that the perfect being exists (1st, 2nd, and 5th).\n\nC. We could get the idea of God without God’s causing the idea (2nd, 3rd).\n\nD. Nothing can cause itself to exist (4th), so God can’t cause himself to exist unless God is composed of some essence that in and of itself has the property of timelessness.\n\nObjections to the epistemology:\n\nA. How can we be sure that what we think is a clear and distinct perception really is clear and distinct (3rd, 5th)?\n\nB. Circle objection 1: if we aren’t certain that judgments based on clear and distinct ideas are true before we prove God’s existence, then we can’t be certain that we are a thinking thing (2nd). Circle objection 2: if we aren’t certain that clear and distinct ideas are true before we prove God’s existence, then we can’t be certain that God exists, since we use clear and distinct ideas to prove God’s existence (4th).\n\nC. Contrary to what Descartes argues, we \"are\" certain that bodies exist/that perception coincides with reality (5th, 6th), but we are not certain that the bodies of our perception are actual bodies in an existent external world.\n\nObjections to philosophy of mind:\n\nA. Ideas are always imagistic (3rd), so we have no idea of thinking substance (non-image idea).\n\nB. We can’t conclude that the mind (thinking thing) is not also a corporeal thing, unless we know that we know everything about the mind. But we don’t know that we know everything about the mind. So we don’t know that the mind isn’t corporeal. (2nd, 4th, 5th, 7th).\n\nElisabeth of Bohemia also corresponded with Descartes on the \"Meditations\". She objected both to his description of the union between mind and body, and that virtue and moral truths seem to need to be grasped by something other than the intellect (despite Descartes's assertion that all truths must be grasped intellectually).\n\nThe historical impact of the six meditations has been divided. The first two meditations, which employed the skeptical methodic doubt and concluded that only the ego and its thoughts are indubitable, have had a huge impact in the history of philosophy. They are often considered as epoch-making for modernity, and an unavoidable first step for any modern philosophical thinking.\n\nArthur David Smith, author of the \"Routledge Philosophy Guidebook to Husserl\", claims that since Edmund Husserl usually refers only to \"the first two\" of the Meditations, therefore Husserl must have thought that they are the only part of Descartes' work with any philosophical importance at all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "40433876", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40433876", "title": "Oliva Sabuco", "text": "Oliva Sabuco\n\nOliva Sabuco de Nantes Barrera (1562–1622) was a Spanish writer in holistic medical philosophy in the late 16th – early 17th century. She was interested in the interaction between the physical and psychological phenomena; therefore she wrote a collection of medical and psychological treatises that target human nature and explain the effects of emotions on the body and soul. She analyzed theoretical claims of ancient philosophers and wrote an early theory of what is now considered applied psychology.\n\nShe was born in Alcaraz, Spain in 1562 and was baptized in the Holy Trinity church on December 2 of that same year. Her mother was Francisca de Cozar and her father was Don Miguel Sabuco y Alvarez. By 1580, at the age of 18, she was married to Don Acacio de Buedo. Although not much is known about her formal education it is evident that Oliva Sabuco was taught medicine by her father. She was well acquainted with classical and contemporary philosophy and was knowledgeable about medical theory. By age 25 she already published a novel far ahead of her time.\n\nSabuco combined ancient Greek and Christian philosophies, along with Aristotelian views in order to explain how the mind and body interact in a holistic manner. She believed human nature to be a single concept, where the rational soul and spiritual soul must co-occur for a human being to exist. A human being would be considered a corpse with no potential for living when it lacked either of the two souls. Sabuco agreed with Atristotle's vision of form and matter in relation to the body: they both believed the interaction between the mind and body was the formal organization of a whole living human being. Her theory differed in the sense that the human being could not exist until the divine soul/mind coexisted with the body/matter.\n\nHer approach to the mind–body interaction mirrored that of Plato’s. The mind was in charge of moral judgments and reasons which caused the body to react in certain ways. Therefore, the body carried out the moral judgments that were processed. Sabuco placed emphasis on self-knowledge and the capacity of the mind to exercise free will. Self-knowledge and ethical decisions allowed hope, health, strength and a natural life span to be placed on the human body while free will directed the passions and emotions.\n\nAccording to Sabuco, the soul was divided into three parts: the sensitive, the biological, and the intellectual soul, all which would be in a harmonic balance with one another. The balance between the four humors, hot, cold, wet, and dry must also be in harmony in order for the human organ system to be in a healthy state. Sabuco used a temperature-humidity schema, derived from Hippocrates, to evaluate illnesses and individuals’ state of health. Although her ideas originated from Hippocrates’s four bodily humors, Sabuco denied the importance of his theory and insisted the focus lie on the severity of temperature and humidity. For example, illnesses, disabilities and premature death were results of disharmony among the three parts of the soul or the temperature-humidity schema. Sabuco also coined the term chilo, which was a white liquid energizing force that traveled through a complex network of anatomical channels from one organ system to another. Chilo maintained the proper temperature and humidity within the body; nonetheless, an imbalance could lead to negative states of health. The purpose of chilo was to communicate movement to the bodily organs and orient them to carry out the goal meant to be accomplished.\n\nSabuco’s theory of moral philosophy incorporated traditional views of virtue ethics. Good and evil were intertwined in the world and could banish each other. Her theory stated how something good could be present in evil and something evil could be present in good. There was never such a concept as pure evil or pure good. Within her theory of human nature only two evils existed, avoidable diseases and premature aging. Sabuco promoted moderation and temperance to control emotions and passions; her theory originated from Plato’s concept of sophrosyne, where self-understanding is used to obtain wisdom and virtue. However, she referenced temperance as the most important virtue that was obtained through self-knowledge. Temperance and wisdom were then labeled as the answers to evil because they sustained human life and provided peace, happiness, and content between emotions and the soul.\n\nThe second part of her work described astronomical and geological events and how they support the theory of human nature. It was important to learn how the macrocosm functions because humans were a microcosm within the board world. Understanding how the world came to be would teach humans how to live in that world. A person's condition, whether improving or declining was related to cosmology. Such topics included the moon, the magnitude of the Earth and its atmosphere, solar and lunar eclipses and the magnitude of the cosmos. An individual's life cycle would improve or decline just like a moon's cycle would be waxing or waning. Within macrocosm, the moon was defined as the brain of the world which provided moisture and growth to its waters. Microcosm, on the other hand, described the sun as the heart of the world which gave warmth and life to the world. The emphasis was placed on the brain, making it more significant than the heart, as the moon was more vital than the sun.\n\nSabuco introduced smaller systems of reformation into her idea of human nature. Sabuco advocated for the creation of legislative, judicial and social reforms in the welfare rights of the powerless, people such as peasants, workers and householders. The powerless were the ones whose health was severely impacted the most by the misery and despair of everyday life. Excess and greed should be avoided because they were bad for the social and individual body.\n\nShe argued for a legal reformation of judicial laws, doctrines of appeals and better protection under the law. She reasoned that the individuals who created the laws would be the only ones who would comprehend them. Therefore, the laws would not be applicable or fair to lower socioeconomic classes who did not partake in the creation of them. Laws must be clear, written in simple language and precise so proper justice could be granted to the poor. Sabuco also argued against juridical doctrines of appeal to authority figures of Roman law. Authoritarian power was passed down through generations and individuals' verdicts had varying interpretations from previous generations of authorities who lacked knowledge about the present case. As a result, she believed protection under the law was unequal for most of the public and most did not receive proper justice.\n\nLegislative reformation should include protection for farmers and peasants because their labor and production was essential in the survival of others within the nation. She was a strong proponent of preventing the authority from confiscating land, livestock, and crops.\n\nSabuco criticized university policies and the objectives of the education system. She mentioned the lack of proper criteria for an individual regarding admissions and recommended examiners evaluate potential candidates' abilities when granting admission. She also denounced the importance of charging students tuition because students were admitted who could afford tuition but lacked the proper aptitude to succeed.\n\nSabuco disagreed with the traditional medical theory and thought its failure to control medicine was due to people's ignorance on the impact of emotions on physical health. Emotions such as anger, sadness, love, excessive joy, hatred, shame and distrust caused imbalances in the bodily humors which squeezed the humor and humidity out of the brain where the soul was located. The only true appropriate medicine would comfort the brain and be in accordance between the body and the soul. Words and deeds that generated joy and hope and taking care of the stomach were the three pillars of health that could comfort the brain. If optimism, contented happiness and abdominal temperature were left unattended they could lead to sorrow, discontent and melancholy. Another general remedy mentioned was the diversion of humor through bodily openings so it would not reach internal organs.\n\nThe book, published in Madrid in 1587, was called \"Nueva Filosofia de la Naturaleza del Hombre (New Philosophy of Human Nature)\". It consisted of seven separately titled treatises. The first five, \"Knowledge of One’s Self\",\"Composition of the World as It Is\", \"Things That Will Improve This World and Its Nations\", \"Treatments and Remedies of Proper Medicine\", and \"Proper Medicine Derived from Human Nature\"' are written in the Castilian language. While the last two, \"Brief Exposition on Human Nature: The Foundations of the Art of Medicine\", and \"Proper Philosophy of the Nature of Composite Things, of Humans, and of the World, Unknown to the Ancients\", are written in Latin. This book, in its entirety, was dedicated to Philip II of Spain.\n\nThe first treatise within Sabuco’s most famous book, \"New Philosophy of Human Nature\", introduces a discussion between three peasants, whom she identified as shepherds and who critique the views of others. These three shepherds continue as the main characters throughout the remaining six treatises and their discussions cover various topics of human nature. The identity of her characters represents the significance of remaining in close contact with nature and staying isolated from society so societal views will not sully the mind. She purposely included peasants as characters in order to demonstrate how philosophy and medicine are relevant regardless of social class. Sabuco believed her theory should be relevant to simple folks and applicable to their lives. The treatises emphasized the universe by describing the theory on mutual interdependence of the soul, body, and cosmos.\nIn the pages of her treatise she explored many ideas amongst which are the comparison of a human body to an upside down tree. It is in the brain, like in the root of a tree, that all diseases begin and it is possible to cure them through various methods amongst which are words of cheerfulness, sound thought, and even to the hearing of music. The process of using wise words against violent emotions such as anger, she called \"Rhetorical Insinuation\" because it explored the idea of being able to persuade the will through words. She explored how emotions have an effect on the human body and how one can control their effects by focusing on the chief organ of the body, the brain. According to Father Feyjoo, much of the research she did contributed to the ability of physicians following her to develop some of the first theories around nervous diseases.\n\nGoing back to the idea of the brain as King, she wrote how during sleep the brain was feed all its necessary nutrients, which have been, throughout the day, collected in the stomach. Once the nutrients were taken to the brain and nervous fluid was created, it was allocated throughout the body by a fluid aside from red blood. Some have postulated that she was referring to a concept similar to white blood cells when she wrote this for she makes mention of a fluid white in color nourishing the body with information.\n\nHer work has sometimes been compared with Descartes' \"The Passion of the Soul\", for like him she imagined the seat of the soul to be in the brain. We know that she was famous in her day because in 1604, while she was still alive, Franciscio Lopez de Uveda, a physician and poet from Toledo, expressed that a character he was working on would out fame people like Oliva Sabuco and Don Quixote, thus implying her name to be one associated with fame. In addition to this, the famous French physician Charles le Pois cited Sabuco’s influence on his own views regarding diseases such as hysteria.\n\nWithout definitively solving the mind body problem, Sabuco moves philosophy a step in that direction by providing both a new chemical explanation, with white fluid as a vehicle of mind body interaction, and an explanation of the role of emotions on physical health.\n\nCredit for her work was sometimes given to her father, Don Miguel Sabuco y Alvarez, because of a powerful letter written by him claiming the work as his own. His letter and a promissory note written by Sabuco's husband and brother were implemented a year following the publication of the book. The letter claimed Don Miguel Sabuco as the true author of \"New Philosophy of Human Nature\" and an explanation stating that her name was included in an attempt to honor her but she had no legal interest in the volume nor authority over it. However, recent scholarship has defended her case, claiming that she was the writer. Because of the nature of her material, she incurred the attention of the inquisitors and had all her books burned. She lived out her days in the convent of Dominican nuns in Alcaraz and took on a monastic habit. There, she eventually died around the year 1622.\n\nA crater on the planet Venus was named \"Barrera\" in her honour, see List of craters on Venus.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1445265", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1445265", "title": "Paul Otlet", "text": "Paul Otlet\n\nPaul Marie Ghislain Otlet (; ; 23 August 1868 – 10 December 1944) was a Belgian author, entrepreneur, visionary, lawyer and peace activist; he is one of several people who have been considered the father of information science, a field he called \"documentation\". Otlet created the Universal Decimal Classification, one of the most prominent examples of faceted classification. Otlet was responsible for the widespread adoption in Europe of the standard American 3x5 inch index card used until recently in most library catalogs around the world (by now largely displaced by the advent of the online public access catalog (OPAC)). Otlet wrote numerous essays on how to collect and organize the world's knowledge, culminating in two books, the ' (1934) and ' (1935).\n\nIn 1907, following a huge international conference, Otlet and Henri La Fontaine created the Central Office of International Associations, which was renamed to the Union of International Associations in 1910, and which is still located in Brussels. They also created a great international center called at first (World Palace), later, the Mundaneum to house the collections and activities of their various organizations and institutes.\n\nOtlet and La Fontaine were peace activists who endorsed the internationalist politics of the League of Nations and its International Institute of Intellectual Cooperation (the forerunner of UNESCO). Otlet and La Fontaine witnessed an unprecedented proliferation of information, resulting in the creation of new kinds of international organization. They saw in this organization an emerging global polity, and wished to help solidify it. La Fontaine won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1913.\n\nOtlet was born in Brussels, Belgium on 23 August 1868, the oldest child of Édouard Otlet (Brussels 13 June 1842-Blanquefort, France, 20 October 1907) and Maria (née Van Mons). His father, Édouard, was a wealthy businessman who made his fortune selling trams around the world. His mother died in 1871 at the age of 24, when Otlet was three. Through his mother, he was related to the \"Van Mons\" family, a prosperous family, and to the Verhaeren family, of which Emile Verhaeren was one of the most important Belgian poets.\n\nHis father kept him out of school, hiring tutors instead, until he was 11, believing that classrooms were a stifling environment. Otlet, as a child, had few friends, and played regularly only with his younger brother Maurice. He soon developed a love of reading and books.\n\nAt the age of six, a temporary decline in his father's wealth caused the family to move to Paris. At the age of 11, Paul went to school for the first time, a Jesuit school in Paris, where he stayed for the next three years. The family then returned to Brussels, and Paul studied at the prestigious Collège Saint-Michel in Brussels. In 1894, his father became a senator in the Belgian Senate for the Catholic Party (until 1900). His father remarried to Valerie Linden, daughter of famed botanist Jean Jules Linden; the two eventually had five additional children. The family travelled often during this time, going on holidays and business trips to Italy, France and Russia.\n\nOtlet was educated at the Catholic University of Leuven and at the , where he earned a law degree on 15 July 1890. He married his step-cousin, Fernande Gloner, soon afterward, on 9 December 1890. He then clerked with famed lawyer Edmond Picard, a friend of his father's.\n\nOtlet soon became dissatisfied with his legal career, and began to take an interest in bibliography. His first published work on the subject was the essay \"Something about bibliography\", written in 1892. In it he expressed the belief that books were an inadequate way to store information, because the arrangement of facts contained within them was an arbitrary decision on the part of the author, making individual facts difficult to locate. A better storage system, Otlet wrote in his essay, would be cards containing individual \"chunks\" of information, that would allow \"all the manipulations of classification and continuous interfiling.\" In addition would be needed \"a very detailed synoptic outline of knowledge\" that could allow classification of all of these chunks of data.\n\nIn 1891, Otlet met Henri La Fontaine, a fellow lawyer with shared interests in bibliography and international relations, and the two became good friends. They were commissioned in 1892 by Belgium's Societé des Sciences sociales et politiques (Society of social and political sciences) to create bibliographies for various of the social sciences; they spent three years doing this. In 1895, they discovered the Dewey Decimal Classification, a library classification system that had been invented in 1876. They decided to try to expand this system to cover the classification of facts that Otlet had previously imagined. They wrote to the system's creator, Melvil Dewey, asking for permission to modify his system in this way; he agreed, so long as their system was not translated into English. They began work on this expansion soon afterwards and thus created the Universal Decimal Classification.\n\nDuring this time, Otlet and his wife then had two sons, Marcel and Jean, in quick succession.\n\nOtlet founded the (IIB) in 1895, later renamed as (in English) the International Federation for Information and Documentation (FID).\n\nIn 1895, Otlet and La Fontaine also began the creation of a collection of index cards, meant to catalog facts, that came to be known as the \"\" (RBU), or the \"Universal Bibliographic Repertory\". By the end of 1895 it had grown to 400,000 entries; later it would reach more than 15 million entries.\n\nIn 1896, Otlet set up a fee-based service to answer questions by mail, by sending the requesters copies of the relevant index cards for each query; scholar Charles van den Heuvel has referred to the service as an \"analog search engine\". By 1912, this service responded to over 1,500 queries a year. Users of this service were even warned if their query was likely to produce more than 50 results per search.\n\nOtlet envisioned a copy of the RBU in each major city around the world, with Brussels holding the master copy. At various times between 1900 and 1914, attempts were made to send full copies of the RBU to cities such as Paris, Washington, D.C. and Rio de Janeiro; however, difficulties in copying and transportation meant that no city received more than a few hundred thousand cards.\n\nIn 1904, Otlet and La Fontaine began to publish their classification scheme, which they termed the Universal Decimal Classification. The UDC was originally based on Melvil Dewey's Decimal classification system. Otlet and La Fontaine contacted Melvil Dewey to inquire if they could modify the Dewey Decimal System to suit the perimeters of their bibliographic project, namely, organizing information in the social and natural sciences. Dewey granted them permission as long as it substantially differed from his original version. They worked with numerous subject experts, for example with Herbert Haviland Field at the Concilium Bibliographicum for Zoology, and completed this initial publication in 1907. The system defines not only detailed subject classifications, but also an algebraic notation for referring to the intersection of several subjects; for example, the notation <nowiki>\"31:[622+669](485)\"</nowiki> refers to the statistics of mining and metallurgy in Sweden. The UDC is an example of an analytico-synthetic classification, i.e., it permits the linking of one concept to another. Although some have described it as faceted, it is not, though there are some faceted elements in it. A truly faceted classification consists solely of simple concepts; there are many compound concepts listed in the UDC. It is still used by many libraries and bibliographic services outside the English-speaking world, and in some non-traditional contexts such as the BBC Archives.\n\nIn 1906, with his father Édouard near death and his businesses falling apart, Paul and his brother and five step-siblings formed a company, (\"Otlet Brothers\") to try to manage these businesses, which included mines and railways. Paul, though he was consumed with his bibliographic work, became president of the company. In 1907, Édouard died, and the family struggled to maintain all parts of the business. In April 1908, Paul Otlet and his wife began divorce proceedings. Otlet remarried in 1912, to Cato Van Nederhesselt.\n\nIn 1913, La Fontaine won the Nobel Peace Prize, and invested his winnings into Otlet and La Fontaine's bibliographic ventures, which were suffering from lack of funding. Otlet journeyed to the United States in early 1914 to try to get additional funding from the U.S. Government, but his efforts soon came to a halt due to the outbreak of World War I. Otlet returned to Belgium, but quickly fled after it became occupied by the Germans; he spent the majority of the war in Paris and various cities in Switzerland. Both his sons fought in the Belgian army, and one of them, Jean, died during the war in the Battle of the Yser.\n\nOtlet spent much of the war trying to bring about peace, and the creation of multinational institutions that he felt could avert future wars. In 1914, he published a book, \"\" (\"The End of War\") that defined a \"World Charter of Human Rights\" as the basis for an international federation.\n\nIn 1910, Otlet and La Fontaine first envisioned a \"city of knowledge\", which Otlet originally named the \"\" (\"World Palace\"), that would serve as a central repository for the world's information. In 1919, soon after the end of World War I, they convinced the government of Belgium to give them the space and funding for this project, arguing that it would help Belgium bolster its bid to house the League of Nations headquarters. They were given space in the left wing of the , a government building in Brussels. They then hired staff to help add to their Universal Bibliographic Repertory. \n\nIn 1921 Otlet wrote to W. E. B. Du Bois offering the use of the Palais Mondial for the 2nd Pan-African Congress. Although both Otlet and Fontaine offered a warm welcome to the Congress, these sentiments were not shared across all of Belgian society. The Brussels based paper \"Neptune\" stated that the organisers – particularly the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People were funded by the Bolsheviks and raised concern that it might lead to difficulties in the Belgian Congo by drawing together \"all the ne’er-do-wells of the various tribes of the Colony, aside from some hundreds of labourers.”\n\nThe Palais Mondial was briefly shuttered in 1922, due to lack of support from the government of Prime Minister Georges Theunis, but was reopened after lobbying from Otlet and La Fontaine. Otlet renamed the Palais Mondial to the Mundaneum in 1924. The RBU steadily grew to 13 million index cards in 1927; by its final year, 1934, it had reached more than 15 million. Index cards were stored in custom-designed cabinets, and indexed according to the Universal Decimal Classification. The collection also grew to include files (including letters, reports, newspaper articles, etc.) and images, contained in separate rooms; the index cards were meant to catalog all of these as well. The Mundaneum eventually contained 100,000 files and millions of images.\n\nIn 1934, the Belgian government again cut off funding for the project, and the offices were closed. (Otlet protested by keeping vigil outside the locked offices, but to no avail.) The collection remained untouched within those offices, however, until 1940, when Germany invaded Belgium. Requisitioning the Mundaneum's quarters to hold a collection of Third Reich art and destroying substantial amounts of its collections in the process, the Germans forced Otlet and his colleagues to find a new home for the Mundaneum. In a large but decrepit building in Leopold Park they reconstituted the Mundaneum as best as they could, and there it remained until it was forced to move again in 1972, well after Otlet's death.\n\nThe World City or Cité Mondiale is a utopian vision by Paul Otlet of a city which like a universal exhibition brings together all the leading institutions of the world. The World City would radiate knowledge to the rest of the world and construct peace and universal cooperation. Otlet’s idea to design a utopian city dedicated to international institutions was largely inspired by the contemporary publication in 1913 by the Norwegian-American sculptor Hendrik Christian Andersen and the French architect Ernest Hébrard of an impressive series of Beaux-Arts plans for a World Centre of Communication (1913). For the design of his World City, Otlet collaborated with several architects. In this way a whole series of designs for the World City was developed. The most elaborated plans were: the design of a Mundaneum (1928) and a World City (1929) by Le Corbusier in Geneva next to the palace of the League of Nations, by Victor Bourgeois in Tervuren (1931) next to the Congo Museum, again by Le Corbusier (in collaboration with Huib Hoste) on the left bank in Antwerp (1933), by Maurice Heymans in Chesapeake Bay near Washington (1935), and by Stanislas Jassinski and Raphaël Delville on the left bank in Antwerp (1941). In these different designs the program of the World City stayed more or less fixed, containing a World Museum, a World University, a World Library and Documentation Centre, Offices for the International Associations, Offices or Embassies for the Nations, an Olympic Centre, a residential area, and a park.\n\nOtlet integrated new media, as they were invented, into his vision of the networked knowledge-base of the future. In the early 1900s, Otlet worked with engineer Robert Goldschmidt on storing bibliographic data on microfilm (then known as \"micro-photography\"). These experiments continued into the 1920s, and by the late 1920s he attempted along with colleagues to create an encyclopedia printed entirely on microfilm, known as the ', which was housed in the Mundaneum. In the 1920s and 1930s, he wrote about radio and television as other forms of conveying information, writing in the 1934 ' that \"one after another, marvellous inventions have immensely extended the possibilities of documentation.\" In the same book, he predicted that media that would convey feel, taste and smell would also eventually be invented, and that an ideal information-conveyance system should be able to handle all of what he called \"sense-perception documents\".\n\nOtlet was a firm believer in international cooperation to promote both the spread of knowledge and peace between nations. The Union of International Associations, which he had founded in 1907 with Henri La Fontaine, later participated to the development of both the League of Nations and the International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation, which was later merged into UNESCO.\n\nIn 1933, Otlet proposed building in Belgium near Antwerp a \"gigantic neutral World City\" to employ a massive number of workers, in order to alleviate the unemployment generated by the Great Depression.\n\nOtlet died in 1944, not long before the end of World War II, having seen his major project, the Mundaneum, shuttered, and having lost all his funding sources. According to Otlet scholar W. Boyd Rayward:\n\nAnd:\n\nIn the wake of World War II, the contributions of Otlet to the field of information science were lost sight of in the rising popularity of the ideas of American information scientists such as Vannevar Bush, Douglas Engelbart, Ted Nelson and by such theorists of information organization as Seymour Lubetzky.\n\nBeginning in the 1980s, and especially after the advent of the World Wide Web in the early 1990s, new interest arose in Otlet's speculations and theories about the organization of knowledge, the use of information technologies, and globalization. His 1934 masterpiece, the \"Traité de documentation\", was reprinted in 1989 by the Centre de Lecture publique de la Communauté française in Belgium. (Neither the Traité nor its companion work, \"Monde\" (World) has been translated into English so far.) In 1990 Professor W. Boyd Rayward published an English translation of some of Otlet's writings. He also published a biography of Otlet (1975) that was translated into Russian (1976) and Spanish (1996, 1999, and 2005).\n\nIn 1985, Belgian academic André Canonne raised the possibility of recreating the Mundaneum as an archive and museum devoted to Otlet and others associated with them; his idea initially was to house it in the Belgian city of Liège. Cannone, with substantial help from others, eventually managed to open the new Mundaneum in Mons, Belgium in 1998. This museum is still in operation, and contains the personal papers of Otlet and La Fontaine and the archives of the various organizations they created along with other collections important to the modern history of Belgium.\n\nOtlet scholar W. Boyd Rayward has written that Otlet's thinking is a product of the 19th century and the philosophy of positivism, which holds that, through careful study and the scientific method, an objective view of the world can be gained. According to W. Boyd Rayward, his ideas placed him culturally and intellectually in the Belle Époque period of pre–World War I Europe, a period of great \"cultural certitude\".\n\nOtlet's writings have sometimes been called prescient of the current World Wide Web. His vision of a great network of knowledge was centered on documents and included the notions of hyperlinks, search engines, remote access, and social networks—although these notions were described by different names. In 1934, Otlet laid out this vision of the computer and internet in what he called “Radiated Library” vision.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4398827", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4398827", "title": "Practical idealism", "text": "Practical idealism\n\nPractical idealism is a term first used by John Dewey in 1917 and subsequently adopted by Mahatma Gandhi (\"Gandhi Marg\" 2002). It describes a philosophy that holds it to be an ethical imperative to implement ideals of virtue or good. It further holds it to be equally immoral to either refuse to make the compromises necessary to realise high ideals, or to discard ideals in the name of expediency. Practical idealism in its broadest sense may be compared to utilitarianism in its emphasis on outcomes, and to political economy and enlightened self-interest in its emphasis on the alignment of what is right with what is possible.\nIn foreign policy and international relations, the phrase \"practical idealism\" has come to be taken as a theory or set of principles that diplomats or politicians use to describe or publicize their outlook on foreign policy. It purports to be a pragmatic compromise between realism, which stresses the promotion of a state's \"narrow\" and amoral self-interest, and idealism, which aims to use the state's influence and power to promote higher liberal ideals such as peace, justice, and co-operation between nations. In this view, realism is seen as a prescription for Machiavellian selfishness and ruthlessness in international relations. Machiavelli recommended political strategies for reigning, or potential, princes; the infamous teachings gravitate around his vision of the overarching and ultimate goal of any Prince, remaining in power. These strategies range from those that, today, might be called moderate or liberal political advice to those that, today, might be called illegal, immoral or, in the U.S., unconstitutional. For better or worse, Machiavelli is by name, like novelist George Orwell, modernly associated with manipulative acts and philosophies that disregard civil rights and basic human dignity in favor of deception, intimidation, and coercion. This extreme form of realism is sometimes considered both unbecoming of nations' aspirations and, ultimately, morally and spiritually unsatisfying for their individual people. Extreme idealism, on the other hand, is associated with moralist naiveté and the failure to prioritize the interests of one's state above other goals.\n\nMore recently, practical idealism has been advocated by United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Philip D. Zelikow, in the position of counselor to the department. The latter has defended the foreign policy of the George W. Bush administration as being \"motivated in good part by ideals that transcend narrow conceptions of material self-interest.\" Zelikow also assesses former U.S. presidents Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin Roosevelt as practitioners of practical idealism.\nSECRETARY RICE: Well, American foreign policy has always had, and I think rightfully had, a streak of idealism, which means that we care about values, we care about principle. It's not just getting to whatever solution is available, but it's doing that within the context of principles and values. And at a time like this, when the world is changing very rapidly and when we have the kind of existential challenge that we have with terrorism and extremism, it's especially important to lead from values. And I don't think we've had a president in recent memory who has been so able to keep his policies centered in values.\nThe responsibility, then, of all of us is to take policies that are rooted in those values and make them work on a day-to-day basis so that you're always moving forward toward a goal, because nobody believes that the kinds of monumental changes that are going on in the world or that we are indeed seeking are going to happen in a week's time frame or a month's time frame or maybe even a year's time frame. So it's the connection, the day-to-day operational policy connection between those ideals and policy outcomes. - Condoleezza Rice, \"Washington Post\" interview\nSingaporean diplomat and former ambassador to the United Nations Dr. Tommy Koh quoted UN Secretary-General U Thant when he described himself as a practical idealist:\nIf I am neither a Realist nor a Moralist, what am I? If I have to stick a label on myself, I would quote U Thant and call myself a practical Idealist. I believe that as a Singaporean diplomat, my primary purpose is to protect the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and economic well-being of the state of Singapore. I believe that I ought to pursue these objectives by means which are lawful and moral. On the rare occasions when the pursuit of my country's vital national interest compels me to do things which are legally or morally dubious, I ought to have a bad conscience and be aware of the damage which I have done to the principle I have violated and to the reputation of my country. I believe that I must always consider the interests of other states and have a decent regard for the opinion of others. I believe that it is in Singapore's long-term interest to strengthen international law and morality, the international system for curbing the use of force and the institutions for the pacific settlement of disputes. Finally, I believe that it is in the interests of all nations to strengthen international co-operation and to make the world's political and economic order more stable, effective and equitable. — \"Can Any Country Afford a Moral Foreign Policy?\"\nCritics have questioned whether practical idealism is merely a slogan with no substantive policy implications. (Gude 2005)\n\nThe phrase practical idealism also was used as a slogan by John Kusumi who ran as an independent candidate in the 1984 presidential elections. This was the first introduction of the phrase in U.S. presidential politics. (United Press International 1984) (New Haven Journal Courier 1984) (New Haven Register 1984)\n\nFormer Democratic Vice President Al Gore also used the phrase in the 1990s, as did Republican Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in the 2000s.\n\nAmerican political scientist Jack Godwin elaborates on the doctrine of practical idealism in \"The Arrow and the Olive Branch: Practical Idealism in US Foreign Policy\".\n\n\n"}

This may or may not be accompanied by the 'rainbow body phenomenon'. The rainbow body phenomenon is a religious topic which has been treated fairly seriously for centuries, including in the modern era. Other Vajrayana teachings also mention rainbow body phenomena.\n\nThe rainbow body phenomenon is a third person perspective of someone else attaining complete knowledge (). Knowledge is the absence of delusion regarding the display of the basis.\n\nRigpa has three wisdoms, which are \"kadag\", \"lhun grub\" and \"thugs rje\". Kadag deals with \"tregchöd\". The \"lhun grub\" aspect has to do with esoteric practices, such as (but not limited to) Thödgal, that self-liberate the human body into a Sambhogakāya (rainbow body phenomenon). The symbol of Dzogchen is a Tibetan \"A\" wrapped in a \"thigle\". The \"A\" represents \"kadag\" while the \"thigle\" represents \"lhun grub\". The third wisdom, \"thugs rje\" (compassion), is the inseparability of the previous two wisdoms.\n\nIn Dzogchen, a fundamental point of practice is to distinguish \"rigpa\" from \"sems\" (mind).\n\nThe ultimate fruition of the thodgal practices is a body of pure light, called a rainbow body (Wylie \" 'ja' lus\", pronounced ja lü.) If the four visions of thogal are not completed before death, then during death, from the point of view of an external observer, the dying person starts to shrink until he or she disappears. Usually fingernails, toenails and hair are left behind (see e.g. Togden Ugyen Tendzin, Ayu Khandro, Changchub Dorje). The attainment of the rainbow body is typically accompanied by the appearance of lights and rainbows.\n\nExceptional practitioners are held to realize a higher type of rainbow body without dying. Having completed the four visions before death, the individual focuses on the lights that surround the fingers. His or her physical body self-liberates into a nonmaterial body of light (a \"Sambhogakāya\") with the ability to exist and abide wherever and whenever as pointed by one's compassion.\n\nShardza Tashi Gyaltsen's \"Heart Drops of Dharmakaya\", a Kunzang Nyingtic Dzogchen meditation manual commentated on by Lopon Tenzin Namdak, contains an eyewitness account of his main students' bodies shrinking and rainbows appearing in the sky at death.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The word derives from the , meaning red ochre or red chalk, and originates in Medieval illuminated manuscripts from the 13th century or earlier. In these, red letters were used to highlight initial capitals (particularly of psalms), section headings and names of religious significance, a practice known as rubrication, which was a separate stage in the production of a manuscript.\n\nRubric can also mean the red ink or paint used to make rubrics, or the pigment used to make it. Although red was most often used, other colours came into use from the late Middle Ages onwards, and the word rubric was used for these also.\n\nVarious figurative senses of the word have been extended from its original meaning. Usually these senses are used within the set phrase \"under [whatever] rubric,\" for example, \"under this rubric, [X is true],\" or \"[X was done] under the rubric of Y.\" These senses are defined in part by \"Merriam-Webster's Collegiate\" as follows: \"an authoritative rule\"; \"the title of a statute\"; \"something under which a thing is classed: CATEGORY\"; \"an explanatory or introductory commentary: GLOSS\"; \"an established rule, tradition, or custom\"; \"a guide listing specific criteria for grading or scoring academic [assignments].\" (See \"Merriam-Webster's Collegiate\" for the full listing.)\n\nInstructions for a priest explaining what he must do during a liturgy were also rubricated in missals and the other liturgical books, and the texts to be spoken aloud were in black. From this, \"rubric\" has a secondary denotation of an instruction in a text, regardless of how it is actually inscribed. This is the oldest recorded definition in English, found in 1375. Less formally, \"rubrics\" may refer to any liturgical action customarily performed, whether or not pursuant to a written instruction. The history, status, and authority of the content of rubrics are significant, and sometimes controversial, among liturgical scholars. In the past, some theologians distinguished between rubrics they considered of Divine origin and those merely of human origin. Rubrics were probably originally verbal, and then written in separate volumes. The earliest extant liturgical books do not contain them, but from references in texts of the first millennium it appears that written versions existed. Full rubrics regarding matters such as vesture, appearance of the altar, timing of specific liturgies, and similar matters still may be published separately. In modern liturgical books, e. g. the Catholic \"Roman Missal\", lengthy general rubrics, probably printed in black, pertain to such matters and preface the actual order of liturgies, which contain shorter, specific rubrics that still are usually rubricated. Red is also often used to distinguish words spoken by the celebrant and those by the congregation, or by other specific persons involved in the liturgy, e. g. those marrying.\n\nWith the arrival of printing, other typographic effects such as italic type, bolded type, or different sizes of type, were used to emphasize a section of text, and as printing in two colours is more expensive and time consuming, rubrication has tended to be reserved for sacred and liturgical books or luxury editions of other works.\n\nWilliam Morris's medievally inspired typography for the Kelmscott Press at the end of the 19th century included chapter titles and other accents in red, or rarely blue, ink, and was influential on small press art typography associated with the Arts and Crafts movement in both England and the United States, particularly the work of the Ashendene, Doves, and Roycroft Presses.\n\nAround 1900, rubrication was incorporated into a Red letter edition of the King James Version of the Bible to distinguish the Dominical words, i. e., those spoken by Jesus Christ during His corporeal life on Earth, because that translation lacked quotation marks. Other versions of the Bible have since adopted the popular practice.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "52545", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52545", "title": "Semiology (Gregorian Chant)", "text": "Semiology (Gregorian Chant)\n\nSemiology (from Greek σημεῖον \"sēmeion\", \"a sign, a mark\") is a branch of Gregorian Chant research. Semiology refers specifically to the study of the neumes as found in the earliest fully notated manuscripts of Gregorian Chant, the oldest of which have been dated to the 9th century. The first application of the term 'semiology' (which first appeared in the 1960s) for the study of Latin chant was made by Dom Eugène Cardine (1905–1988), a monk of the Abbey of Solesmes. In this context, 'semiology' is understood as 'the study of musical signs'. Text and neumatic notation, together with significative letters adjoined to the neumes, presents an effective and integrated mnemonic for the rhythmical interpretation and the melody. While Gregorian palaeography offers a description of the various neumes and their rhythmical and melodic values, Gregorian semiology explains their meaning for practical interpretation. \n\nIn the 19th century, palaeographical work relating to chant was done in various places in Europe against the background of a performance style based on proportional durational values that were assigned to various deteriorated forms of chant used in various locales.\n\nThe main player in the history of Gregorian chant semiology in the 19th century is the Benedictine community of the Abbey of St Peter in Solesmes, which was established in 1833 by Fr Prosper Guéranger, who wished to create single authoritative editions of chant via paleographical study. This led to the scholarly monks of the abbey, chief among whom was Dom Paul Jausions, spending over half a century finding and copying the most ancient chant manuscripts. Under Guéranger, the monks of Solesmes advocated singing Gregorian chant in a free musical metre giving the majority of sung notes the same durational length. This interpretation was contrary to much contemporary practice elsewhere and at odds with scholars who backed the use of long and short notes related in strict durational proportion as per polyphonic singing.\n\nThe publication of Gontiér's \"Méthode Raisonée de plain-chant\" (1859) was followed by Dom Pothier's \"Mélodie Grégorienne d'après la tradition\" (1880) in which he advocated singing the chant in 'rythme oratoire' (oratorical rhythm), which still involved giving the majority of sung notes the same durational length. In 1889, Dom André Mocquereau initiated the \"Paleographie Musicale\" periodicals which saw the publication of \"facsimiles\" of most ancient chant manuscripts to make them more accessible to scholars. Dom Pothier disapproved of this initiative.\n\nIn his third volume of \"Études de science musicale\", published in 1898, Antoine Dechevrens laid out a comprehensive system of interpreting the neumes of Sankt Gallen style in proportional note lengths. Peter Wagner's \"Neumenkunde\" (1905) volume set out the various musical signs of all the most ancient notational styles historically and paleographically, including Jewish and Byzantine neumes, while providing a number of facsimile illustrations, giving rhythmically proportional values for the musical signs along with a few examples of proportional interpretations of certain chants in modern Western European notation.\n\nThe Holy See set up a commission which ran from 1904 till 1913, headed by Pothier, and an editorial team, run by Mocquereau, to create official chant editions for the Vatican. Mocquereau's editorial team only lasted a year: owing to editorial disagreements with Mocquereau, Pothier ended up in charge of the editing which, amongst other things, led to the production of a revised Graduale Romanum in 1908. Mocquereau published \"Le nombre musical grégorienne ou rhythmique grégorienne\" (two volumes) in 1908 & 1927, in which he presented his own understanding of Gregorian rhythm, several elements of which have since been generally discredited. Two elements which have not been discredited are the recognition of the existence of note lengthening, and the notion of 'nuancing', i.e., altering note durations by very small, non-proportional values. One-note syllables were declared to be normally short in duration, their written length being interpreted as 'graphic licence'.\n\nIn 1934, Dom Gregory Murray's anti-proportionalist \"A Pilgrim's Progress\" was published. In the same year, a series of articles on the subject of the rhythmic quantities of Gregorian musical signs began to be published, entitled 'La Question Rhythmique Grégorienne' by the Abbé G Delorme. This work concluded that certain notational styles contained two distinct signs for any single note and that this difference must be related to rhythm rather than pitch.\n\nThe next person to work out a comprehensively coherent analysis of the various neumes and their rhythmic durations was Dr Jan Vollaerts. Using comparative analysis of all the material available to him, Vollaerts was able to show the internal logic and coherence in the neumatic notation with regard to a proper articulation of the verbal-melodic line. In his posthumously published book, 'Rhythmic Proportions in Early Medieval Ecclesiastical Chant' (Brill, 1958), where the term 'semiotic' is used, tables are presented of neumes of different notational styles once used in various parts of Europe (e.g., Nonantola, Laon, Brittany, Aquitaine, Switzerland). One-note, two-note, three-note neumes as found in the various notations are dealt with chapter by chapter. The neumes of one-note syllables were declared to be generally long in duration, as marked in Nonantola and Laon notation.\n\nIn the book, singing chant to proportional durations is advocated. This is supported in the book by the evidence of Latin medieval theoretical writings which overwhelmingly advocate singing note lengths according to long and short notes bearing durations defined by simple ratios. Certain of the same writings criticise any lengthening or shortening of these ratios, although certain writings also recognise that such practice existed.\n\nIn a volte face, Dom Gregory Murray published two booklets, presenting the same views as Vollaerts. In 1957, he published \"Gregorian Rhythm in the Gregorian Centuries; the Literary Evidence\" which presented excerpts from the medieval theoretical writings in English and Latin. In 1959, he published \"The Authentic Rhythm of Gregorian Chant\" which statedly presented, in edited fashion,\nDelorme's and Vollaerts' arguments.\n\nThis work was followed in 1968 by the book 'Semiologia Gregoriana' by Dom Eugène Cardine. In this book, a fairly comprehensive table of the neumes used by the school of Sankt Gallen is presented. Unlike Fr. Vollaerts, Dom Cardine did not view the musical signs as representing proportional note values, and he viewed one-note syllables in Sankt Gallen notation as normally representing a short duration. Unlike Vollaerts, Cardine did not present all the styles of notation to the reader for examination, which means that the reader had no access to certain notations, such as those of Nonantola and Laon, which mark most one-note syllables with a sign indicating a lengthening of duration.\n\nVertical, from top to bottom, in the first column, Cardine starts off with neumes representing a single note, then two-, three- and four-note groups and many compound neumes and ornamental neumes. Horizontally, Cardine enters all the variations of the main neume. The system of neumes used in most of the earliest notational styles is rhythmically complex and sophisticated, particularly the styles of Laon and Einsiedeln Abbey.\n\nCardine states that natural speech-rhythms provide a rhythmic basis for the declamation of Gregorian chant. He divides syllabic time into three categories: \"normal\" \"enlarged, more heavy\" and \"light, more liquid\". Under this interpretation, a one-note syllable would not be considered usually \"long\" or \"longer\".\n\nCardine was employed as a teacher of palaeography and semiology by the Vatican from 1952 to 1984 at the Pontifical Institute of Sacred Music in Rome. His work in the field of semiology was recognized and supported by commissions and led to the publication of the 'Graduale Triplex' in 1979, which was based on Cardine's personal Roman Gradual in which, over the years, he had copied many neumes from Sankt Gallen school manuscripts. Two students of Cardine, Rupert Fischer and M.C. Billecocq, undertook the strenuous task to manually copy the neumes of two schools of generally concordant rhythmic manuscripts (Einsiedeln/Sankt Gallen and Laon) into the new type-set Roman Gradual of 1974. In hindsight, the 'Graduale Triplex' proved a great stimulus for self-study as it made important material available in a handy book. The momentum of its publication has created a demand for a new Gradual as the 1974 Gradual contains many incidental or structural melodic errors. As a response to this need and following the Holy See's invitation to edit a more critical edition, in 2011the first volume \"De Dominicis et Festis\" of the \"Graduale Novum Editio Magis Critica Iuxta SC 117\"was published by Libreria Editrice Vatican and ConBrio Verlagsgesellschaft, Regensburg. \n\nThe growing number of choirs or scholae that perform Gregorian Chant according to these developments are thus said to follow the 'semiological approach'. The International Society for the Study of Gregorian Chant (Associazione Internazionale Studi di Canto Gregoriano) carries on the legacy of Eugène Cardine, putting special emphasis on bridging the gap between Gregorian research and praxis. The Society has some 500 members in 30 countries worldwide.\n\nOther students of Cardine, who, like Fischer and Billecocg, held a professorate at the Pontifical Institute of Sacred Music in Rome or other church music institutes, include Marie-Noel Colette, Luigi Agustoni, Johannes Berchmans Göschl and Godehard Joppich.\n\nA smaller school of singing chant using proportional durations, as per Fr Vollaerts, has continued in the hands of Jan van Biezen in the Netherlands, R John Blackley in Maine, USA, and Luca Ricossa in Switzerland.\n\nIn the 1983 \"Liber Hymnarius\" from Solesmes, it is stated that, \"When an ordinary syllable is set to one note, this represents the fundamental rhythmic value used in Gregorian chant (i.e. valor syllabicus medius).\" This implies that the one-note syllable (and thus the fundamental rhythmic value of chant) is no longer interpreted by Solesmes as being normally short in duration.\n\n\n"}

It is usually attended by monks and nuns between their early teen years and early twenties. Not all young monastics enter a shedra; some study ritual practices instead. Shedra is variously described as a university, monastic college, or philosophy school. The age range of students typically corresponds to both secondary school and college. After completing a shedra, some monks continue with further scholastic training toward a Khenpo or Geshe degree, and other monks pursue training in ritual practices.\n\nThe curriculum varies with the lineage and monastery but most cover the main foundational texts in the Tibetan Buddhist canon, such as the \"Mūlamadhyamakakārikā\" (\"The Fundamental Verses on the Middle Way\") by Nagarjuna and the \"Madhyamakāvatāra\" (\"Entering the Middle Way\") by Candrakīrti. Some non-Buddhist courses, such as grammar, poetry, history, and arts may be included. The initial years focus on the Buddhist \"sutras\" and the remaining years on \"tantras.\" Care is taken to introduce foundational topics first, building key concepts and vocabulary for later study.\n\nCompared to western educational systems, the shedra places much greater emphasis on memorization by students. Some traditions require monks memorize complete texts before studying them. They may be required to recite in class the new sections they've memorized each day. In some lineages, debate becomes a major focus and practice for refining one's understanding. In those lineages students may spend a major portion of the day in debate with each other.\n\nThere are differing views on the importance of shedra. Gelug, Sakya and Jonang lineages consider the shedra training essential, whereas in the Nyingma and Kagyu lineages, this is less the case.\n\nJe Tsongkhapa standardized the Tibetan Buddhist curriculum into five major topics, and this was later adopted by many other schools.\n\nThe shedra system at Sera Monastery, now relocated to southern India from Tibet, has a twelve- to twenty-year curriculum organized in the five topics. The first five years are foundational and cover logic, epistemology, vinaya, and the terms and distinctions built upon in later philosophic study. The next four years are devoted to studying specific texts, including Candrakīrti's \"Madhyamakavatara\", Maitreya's \"Abhisamayalankara\", and Dharmakīrti's \"Pramanavarttika\". The remaining four to eight years continue with Vasubandhu's \"Treasury of Manifest Knowledge\" and Gunaprabha's \"Vinayamula Sutra\", and, for some students, study of Guhyasamāja tantra.\n\nThe shedra at Namdroling Monastery includes specific phases of study with particular texts used in each phase. Commentaries by Ju Mipham or Khenpo Shenga may be used with each text. The phases and texts include:\n\nThe following texts were recommended by the 16th Karmapa as the basis for study in the shedra at Rumtek Monastery:\n\nMonastic education and a tradition of scholarship was not unique to Tibet, but was imported when Buddhism was brought from India initially by Shantarakshita. Major Buddhist universities such as Nalanda University existed as places for advanced studies in India up until the twelfth century.\n\n\n"}

Vaidarbhi Amma and Sri Varadarajulu. Sri Bhagvan’s father was the head of the accounts department of Indian Railways and his mother was a simple village woman. In 1955, when Sri Bhagavan was 6 years of age, the family moved to Chennai.\n\nSri Bhagavan attended Don Bosco School in Chennai. Later, he graduated from DG Vaishnav College in Chennai, majoring in mathematics.\n\nSri Bhagavan married Smt. Padmavathi on 9 June 1977. This was an arranged marriage following the prevalent customary practice in India for marriages decided by elders in the family. Padmavathi, who is addressed as Amma by their students, takes an interest and participation in building the spiritual organization Oneness.\n\nJeevashram School located in Chittoor District, Andhra Pradesh was founded by Sri Bhagavan, in July 1984 to provide an alternative form of education. The land for the school was taken on a lease, with the support provided by Hari Khoday, an Indian philanthropist. As director of the school, Sri Bhagavan's focus was to develop an environment for children to truly flower and discover themselves. The school had 180 residential students and 200 day students from nearby villages. It was at this school that his spiritual work began. In the summer of 1989, one of the students reported a mystical experience of divine silence. Soon, many other students reported similar experiences, and they were also able to pass their experiences to one another. During these experiences, children had vision of various Gods and would converse with them. Sri Bhagavan explained that the children had got in touch with Antaryamin, \"the inner guide who dwells in your heart\" that guides all beings towards greater truth. In 1991, Sri Bhagawan decided to close the school and start the spiritual work for the larger community. The school was closed a few years later in 1994, after the senior students had all graduated from high school and the remaining students were moved to other schools.\n\nOnce the decision was made to close Jeevashram School, work started in developing the spiritual programs for the public. The principal of the Jeevashram School with a small group of teachers started the spiritual programs for public. The workshops were conducted as residential retreat programs conducted over 7 days or 21 days.\n\nThe workshop focused on helping the participant \"accept themselves as they are\", and connect with their \"own inner divine self\" the Antaryamin\n\nStudents also reported various spiritual experiences including mystical visions of their own personal God riding a white horse, similar to the Kalki form of Vishnu from traditional Hindu beliefs. Based on this shared spiritual experiences, the students and public would address Sri Bhagavan with the title \"Kalki\".\n\nA second campus was set up in 1992 near Chennai city a place called Somangalam. In 1994, the campus of Jeevashram School was renamed as Satyaloka. Advance retreat programs for public were conducted at this campus. By 1995, Sri Bhagavan's workshops were being conducted in all major cities in India. In 1995, the first major public event was held at Chennai city, attracting more than 100,000 students from across India. In 1999, the work on building the Oneness University at Varadaiahpalem, Chittoor district Andhra Pradesh India started. Oneness University, located 70 km from Chennai, is accessible by the National Highway 5 and is on Tirupati Road leading to the ancient temple town of Kalahasthi. In 2000, the first campus was completed and Sri Bhagavan and his team of teachers moved to the campus. Over the next few years, various campuses, including the Oneness Temple in 2008 were built. In 2004, the first international program was started.\n\nAnna Hazare the Indian social reformer, states \"All over India, oneness is the only University providing the values which have not been provided by any other University\".\n\nErvin Laszlo of the Budapest Club, avers that the 'Oneness experience' are as real as any human sense perceptions of light, colour and sound, but conveyed via different neural process within the brain.\n\nIn 2006, Tony Robbins, the well known American businessman and coach, discovered meditation through his visit to Oneness University, and has since incorporated teachings of Sri Bhagavan as part of his own programs.\n\nIn 2009, about 600 delegates from India and 36 others converged at Sri Bhagavan's Oneness University campus for the international convention of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad. This program was attended by various well-known figures, such as Ashok Singhal, Praveen Togadia, and Giriraj Kishore.\n\nWell-known visitors to Sri Bhagavan's Oneness University campus include Bollywood stars Shilpa Shetty, Manisha Koirala, Hrithik Roshan,\nRakesh Roshan designer Donna Karan, Deff Leppard musician Rick Allen, NBA coach Pat Riley, spiritual leader Sri Sri Ravi Shankar.\n\nIn 2011 he was included in \"Watkins Mind Body Spirit\" list of influential spiritual leaders for that year.\n\nThe movement started in the early 1980s and by 2008 was reported to have more than 14 million followers worldwide. Its stated mission is to \"create oneness for all for lasting spiritual transformation\". Its rites include the practice of deeksha.\n\nSri Bhagavan's movement has various names, such as Golden Age Foundation, Bhagavad Dharma, Kalki Dharma and the Oneness Organisation.\n\nThe headquarters and main campus for the movement is in Varadaiahpalem, Andhra Pradesh, India. Within the campus is the Oneness Temple.\n\n\n"}

The history of \"suiseki\" in Japan begins during the reign of Empress Suiko. The small objects were brought to Japan as gifts from the Chinese Imperial court.\n\n\"Suiseki\" are usually presented in two different ways:\n\n\nThese stones are not just any stones which can be found in nature; they must be expressive stones and have a special shape, color and texture to be categorized as \"suiseki\". There is a distinction between landscape and object stones. The former reflect landscapes such as mountains, lakes or rivers, while other stones have object shapes that resemble animals or sculptures.\n\nThe stones are of natural origin and are found in rivers, oceans and karst areas. They are not allowed to be reshaped. An exception is the cutting of stones to have a flat base, so they can be placed stably on a Daiza, suiban or Doban, to be displayed properly. This diminishes their value, in the eyes of purists.\n\nThe evaluation of \"suiseki\" recognizes subtlety of color, shape, markings and surface. According to in ,\nIt is not a silly thing at all to enjoy a stone in a tray. I see the whole world in a tiny stone. Some objects in this world are huge, and others are small, and they come in all shapes, but they are not that different when you look at their essence.\nPopular types of \"suiseki\" suggest a mountain, a waterfall, an island, a thatched hut or an animal.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "48546728", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48546728", "title": "Sun Deng (recluse)", "text": "Sun Deng (recluse)\n\nSun Deng 孫登 (f. 230-260 CE) was a Daoist sage-recluse, a zitherist, and allegedly the last master of transcendental whistling. Chinese literature has various anecdotes about Sun Deng refusing to teach the musicians Ji Kang (223-262) and Ruan Ji (210-263), two of the iconoclastic Seven Worthies of the Bamboo Grove.\n\nThe moral of the story about Ruan Ji visiting Sun Deng, who preferred supernatural whistling over traditional master-disciple dialog, is the ineffability of the Dao (as explained in the opening of the \"Daodejing\"). The Chinese poetry of the Six Dynasties and Tang dynasty developed this narrative into the \"absent recluse\" genre, expressing the unfulfilled desire to obtain wisdom by entering into conversation with a sage-recluse dwelling in the mountains (Varsano 1999: 56).\n\nJi Kang or Xi Kang (223-262) was a prominent intellectual of the Cao Wei (220-265) period, Daoist philosopher, author, poet, and musician. He was leader of the Seven Worthies/Sages of the Bamboo Grove, a group of intellectuals and artists who met occasionally at his estate to drink wines, take drugs, play music, and engage in witty \"qingtan\" \"pure conversation\".\n\nJi Kang's polymathic interests ranged from \"xian\" \"transcendence; immortality\" techniques to music theory. His essay \"Yangsheng lun\" \"On Nourishing Life\" contends that one can achieve longevity through Daoist breathing exercises, diets (e.g., \"bigu\"), and drugs (Cold-Food Powder). Drug use was widespread among the literati in early medieval China, and Ji Kang was \"reputed to have been a connoisseur in this field\" (Chan 2014). Ji's writings on music include the famous \"Qin fu\" \"A Rhapsody on the Qin\" zither, \"Shengwu aile lun\" \"Essay on the Absence of Sorrow or Joy in Music\", and a number of solo pieces for \"qin\".\n\nThe classical Chinese stringed instrument \"qin\" 琴 \"zither; [sometimes translated] lute\" is called \"guqin\" 古琴 \"old zither\" in Modern Standard Chinese, owing to the common use of \"qin\" in names for instrumental loanwords (such as \"kouqin\" 口琴 \"mouth organ; harmonica\"). Sun Deng was renowned for playing a one-string version of the qin (一弦琴); the 499 \"Zhen'gao\" 真誥 (tr. Campany 2002: 516) says Sun Deng could \"derive eight notes by plucking a single string.\"\n\nJi/Xi Kang and Ruan Ji were close friends, famous for their skills in poetry, music, and \"qingtan\" ripostes. They helped to develop \"xuanxue\" \"Neo-Daoism\" and emphasized the importance of \"ziran\" \"naturalness; spontaneity\". Ji and Ruan were in a homosexual relationship with Shan Tao, another one of the Seven Worthies, who described their friendship as \"stronger than metal and fragrant as orchids\" (tr. Hinsch 1990: 69). Ji Kang and Ruan Ji were such close friends that \"Jiruan\" 嵇阮 was a popular portmanteau for the pair. Ji and Ruan both tried unsuccessfully to study zither and transcendental whistling with Sun Deng.\n\nGe Hong's (4th century) Daoist \"Shenxian zhuan\" \"Biographies of Divine Transcendents\" hagiography of Sun Deng 孙登 has the earliest version of the story about his refusal to teach Ji Kang about zither playing.\n\nSun Deng's origin is not known. He stayed in the mountains, sitting in caves, strumming the zither and studying the \"Changes\". Winter or summer he wore only a single-layer garment, but when the weather grew extremely cold, someone observed him loosen his hair and use it to cover his body. It was over ten feet in length. When the Grand Mentor Yang Jun 楊駿 sent a messenger to invite Sun Deng to converse with him, Sun made no reply. Yang Jun then sent him a lined cloth robe as a gift. Upon its delivery, Sun came out from his gate, borrowed someone's knife, and cut the robe in two; he then placed the upper and lower halves in separate places outside Yang's gate. He also made a loud sound as if he were being cut in two. At the time, people thought him mad. Only later did they realize that Yang would be executed that way and that Sun was doing this as a symbolic prediction. Yang had him arrested and would not release him, so Sun died. Yang furnished a coffin and had him buried near Zhen Bridge. Several days later someone spotted him at Dongma Hill, so this person sent a letter to a friend of his in Luoxia. Ji Shuye [i.e., Ji Kang], who had ambitions to outstrip his era, once visited Sun Deng. Sun would not speak with him. When Ji raised objections, Sun calmly strummed his zither, until, after a long time, Ji finally stepped back. Sun then said, \"Young man, you have excellent talent, but you lack knowledge of how to preserve the body. How will you avoid [harm]?\" (It was not long after this that Ji was destroyed by implication in a grave affair.) Now Ji was skilled at playing the zither. At this point, Sun, using only one string, played a whole tune, and Ji, hearing it, sighed and became lost in thought. (tr. Campany 2002: 336) \nYang Jun (d. 291) was a Jin Dynasty (265-420) official during the reign of Emperor Wu and regent for Emperor Hui. Sun Deng's \"death\" and reappearance is typical for Daoist \"shijie\" 尸解 \"release from corpse\" fake burial, the lowest level of \"xian\" \"transcendence\". This \"grave affair\" refers to Ji Kang getting involved in Cao Wei court politics, and sentenced to death by regent Sima Zhao for testifying to help a friend.\n\nThe \"Shishuo Xinyu\" \"A New Account of Tales of the World\" (tr. Mather 1976: 332) says, \"While Hsi K'ang was wandering among the mountains of Chi Commandery (Honan), he met the Taoist adept [道士], Sun Teng, and thereafter continued his wanderings in his company. As K'ang was on the eve of departing, Teng said, 'As far as your ability is concerned, it's high enough, but your way of preserving your own life is inadequate'.\"\n\nThe \"Shishuo xinyu\" commentary by the Liang dynasty scholar Liu Xiaobiao 劉孝標 or Liu Jun劉峻 (462-521) quotes four texts. First, the anonymous \"Xi Kang Jishu\" 嵇康集序 (tr. Mather 1976: 333) says, \"In the summer Sun Teng wove garments out of grass, and in the winter he covered himself with his unbound hair. He was fond of reading the \"Book of Changes\" and playing a one-stringed zither. All who saw him were attracted and delighted by him.\" Second, the \"Wei Shi Chunqiu\" 魏氏春秋 \"Chronicles of the Clans of Wei\", by Sun Sheng (ca. 302-373), says (tr. Mather 1976: 333), \"Sun Teng was by nature free of both joy and anger. If anyone doused him under water and then brought him out to look at him, Teng would just laugh aloud. Whatever items of clothing or food were provided him by households where he stayed he would never decline, but when he left he would leave them behind.\" Third, the (4th century) \"Wenshi zhuan\" 文士傳 \"Biographies of Scholars\" (tr. Mather 1976: 333), by Zhang Yin 張隱, gives this version of the story. \nDuring the Chia-p'ing era (249-253) some people of Chi Prefecture had gone into the mountains, where they saw a man. The place where he lived was an overhanging cliff rising a hundred \"jen\" (about 700 feet), where dense woods grew in shady luxuriance, yet his spirit and intelligence were extremely bright. He said of himself that his surname was Sun and his name, Teng, with the courtesy name, Kung-ho. When he heard of him, Hsi K'ang followed him about for three years. K'ang asked for his prognosis concerning his own future, but Teng never answered. However, K'ang always sighed in respectful admiration over the fine subtlety contained in his godlike counsels. When K'ang was about to take his leave, he said to the man, \"Sir, have you nothing, after all, to say?\" Teng finally answered, \"Do you know anything about fire? When it is lit it gives light. Yet knowing when not to use the light is, after all, included in knowing when to use it. When a man is born he is endowed with ability. Yet knowing when not to use his ability is, after all, included in knowing when to use it. Thus, knowing when to use light is included in getting enough fuel to keep it burning, and knowing when to use ability is included in understanding things well enough to complete one's allotted years. Now your ability is abundant, but your understanding slight. You'll have difficulty avoiding trouble in today's world. Don't ask me anything more.\" K'ang was unable to use his advice, and when he became involved in the Lü An affair and was cast into prison, he composed a poem reproaching himself, as follows: \"In the past I used to blush before Liu-hsia Hui, But now I am ashamed before Sun Teng.\" \nLiu-hsia Hui or Liuxia Hui is the loyal politician Zhan Huo (720-621 BCE).\nFourth, Wang Yin's 王隱 (4th century) \"Jinshu\" (tr. Mather 1976: 333) explains, \"Sun Teng was the one interviewed by Juan Chi. Hsi K'ang treated him as his teacher, with all the ceremony expected of a disciple. During the transition between Wei and Chin (ca. 260-265) it was easy to fall prey to jealousy and suspicion; both noble and base were engulfed together. For this reason Sun Teng was silent on some points.\"\n\nThe Yuan dynasty (c. 14th century) \"Zengxiang liexian zhuan\" 增像列仙傳 \"Enlarged and Illustrated Collected Biographies of Transcendents\" elaborates on Ji/Xi Kang meeting Sun Deng, and mentions transcendental whistling in addition to zither playing.\nSun Teng dwelt in a cave on the North Mountain in the prefecture of Chi [in Honan]. In summer, he made himself garments of plaited straw; in winter he covered himself only with his long hair. He was an expert in the art of whistling without a break, and he loved to read the Canon of Changes and to thrum a one-stringed lute. By temperament he was prone neither to joy nor to anger. Once, we are told, in the hope of seeing him angry, a man pitched him into the river, but when Sun Teng had scrambled out, he only burst into fits of laughter. The high-born statesman Hsi K'ang accompanied him in his wanderings for three years, yet whenever he questioned his Master about his aims, he could get no reply. When about to leave him, Hsi K'ang said: \"After all this time, Sir, have you no word for me?\" Sun Teng replied: \"You know what fire is, don't you? It has the natural property of giving light, but not of using that light; yet its importance depends on the use made of its light. In man, intellectual capacity is a natural gift, but not the use made of that capacity; yet his worth depends on the use he makes of it. The use of light is contingent on a supply of fuel wherewith to preserve its radiance; and the use of intellect consists in acquiring a knowledge of Pure Truth so as to keep one's life immune from harm.\" Hsi K'ang also asked for instruction in playing the lute, but Sun Teng would not teach him. \"Your intellectual capacity is great,\" he said, \"but your knowledge is small. It will be difficult for you to pass unscathed through the world of to-day.\" … In the end, Sun Teng rose up to heaven in broad daylight (tr. Giles 1948: 94-95) \n\nRuan Ji (210-263) was a skillful poet, essayist, and musician, who rebelled against orthodox Confucian rituals and conventions. He loved drinking wine, and his \"Jinshu\" biography says he avoided an arranged marriage into the Sima family by staying drunk for 60 days. The famous \"guqin\"-zither melody, \"Jiukuang\" \"Drunken Ecstasy\" is attributed to him.\n\nRuan wrote philosophical essays about the \"Yijing\", \"Daodejing\", and \"Zhuangzi\", his masterful \"Yonghuai shi\" \"Songs of My Soul\", and \"Yue lun\" \"Disquisition on Music\". Among recluse poets who practiced transcendental whistling as a way to absorb themselves into nature, Ruan Ji was the most famous whistler of the Jin dynasty (Su 2006: 32). After meeting Sun Deng, Ruan Ji immortalized him in \"Daren xiansheng zhuan\" \"Biography of Master Great Man\", which praises Daoist transcendence over the mundane world.\n\nIn the (5th century) \"Shishuo xinyu\" version of this transcendental whistling story about Ruan Ji, Sun Deng is referred to as the \"zhenren\" \"perfected person\" in the Sumen Mountains 蘇門山.\nWhen Juan Chi whistled [嘯], he could be heard several hundred paces away. In the Su-men Mountains (Honan) there appeared from nowhere a Realized Man [真人] about whom the woodcutters were all relaying tales. Juan Chi went to see for himself and spied the man squatting with clasped knees by the edge of a cliff. Chi climbed the ridge to approach him and then squatted opposite him. Chi rehearsed for him briefly matters from antiquity to the present, beginning with an exposition of the Way of Mystical Quiescence [玄寂] of the Yellow Emperor and Shen Nung, and ending with an investigation of the excellence of the Supreme Virtue [盛德] of the Three Ages (Hsia, Shang, and Chou). But when Chi asked his opinion about it he remained aloof and made no reply. Chi then went on to expound that which lies beyond Activism [有為之教], and the techniques of Resting the Spirit [棲神] and Conducting the Vital Force [導氣]. But when Chi looked toward him for a reply, he was still exactly as before, fixedly staring without turning. Chi therefore turned toward him and made a long whistling sound [長嘯]. After a long while the man finally laughed and said, \"Do it again.\" Chi whistled a second time [復嘯], but as his interest was now exhausted, he withdrew. He had returned about half-way down the ridge when he heard above him a shrillness like an orchestra of many instruments, while forests and valleys reechoed with the sound. Turning back to look, he discovered it was the whistling of the man he had just visited [向人嘯]. (49, tr. Mather 1976: 331) \n\nDonald Holzman (2009: 154) comments on their meeting: \"It (\"xiao\") was an unintellectual art, probably a fairly strange kind of sound that is divorced from speech and reason...When Ruan Ji whistles Sun Teng sees that he is not merely a pedant, but also an adept of an art that imitates nature, that he is able to control his breath so as to make it resemble that very breath of heaven.\"\n\nThe \"Shishuo xinyu\" commentary by Liu Xiaobiao quotes two texts. First, the (4th century) \"Wei Shi Chunqiu\" 魏氏春秋 version says,\nJuan Chi often went riding alone wherever his fancy led him, not following the roads or byways, to the point where carriage tracks would go no farther, and always he would return weeping bitterly. Once while he was wandering in the Su-men Mountains there was a recluse living there whose name no one knew, and whose only possessions were a few \"hu\"-measures of bamboo fruit, a mortar and pestle, and nothing more. When Juan Chi heard of him he went to see him and began conversing on the Way of Non-action [無為] of high antiquity, and went on to discuss the moral principles [義] of the Five Emperors and Three August Ones. The Master of Su-men remained oblivious and never even looked his way. Chi then with a shrill sound made a long whistling whose echoes reverberated through the empty stillness. The Master of Su-men finally looked pleased and laughed. After Chi bad gone down the hill, the Master gathered his breath and whistled shrilly with a sound like that of the phoenix. Chi had all his life been a connoisseur of music, and he borrowed the theme of his discussion with the Master of Su-men to express what was in his heart in a song, the words of which are: \"The sun sets west of Mt. Pu-chou; The moon comes up from Cinnabar Pool. Essence of Yang is darkened and unseen; While Yin rays take their turn to win. His brilliance lasts but for a moment; her dark will soon again be full. If wealth and honor stay but for a trice must poverty and low estate be evermore?\" (tr. Mather 1976: 331-332) \nSecond, the \"Zhulin Qixian Lun\" 竹林七賢論 (tr. Mather 1976: 332), by Dai Kui 戴逵 (d. 396) explains, \"After Juan Chi returned (from the Su-men Mountains) he proceeded to compose the \"Discourse on Mr. Great Man\" [大人先生論]. What was said in this discourse all represented the basic feelings in his breast and heart. The main point was that Mr. Great Man was none other than Juan himself.\"\n\nThe (648) \"Book of Jin\" () biography of Ruan Ji uses \"changxiao\" and \"xiao\" to describe his meeting with Sun Deng.\nOnce [Juan] Chi met Sun Teng on Su-men Mountain. [Juan Chi] touched on topics of ancient times, and on the arts of \"posing the spirit\" and \"leading the breath.\" [Sun] Teng kept silent throughout. As a result, [Juan] Chi expelled a long whistle [籍因長嘯而退], and took his leave. When he had descended halfway down the mountain, he heard a sound like the cry of the phoenix resounding throughout the peaks and valleys. It was the whistling of [Sun] Teng [乃登之嘯也]. (tr. Varsano 1999: 56)\nVarsano (1999: 57) explains transcendental whistling as a direct representation of the ineffable Dao, \"his superhuman whistle, a primordial sound that does not describe the secrets of the universe, but incarnates it.\"\n\nThe context goes on to say that after Sun Deng refused to talk with Ruan Ji, Xi Kang followed Sun Deng travelling for three years. Since Sima Zhao became generalissimo in 255, Holzman dates Ruan Ji's visit around 257, and Xi Kang's around 258 to 260. Based on the different mountain names, Chan (1996: 151, 158) says Ruan Ji visited Sun Deng twice, first around 226-230, and then around 255-263; and dates Xi Kang's travels at around 249-251.\n\nThe anonymous (c. 8th century) \"Xiaozhi\" 嘯旨 \"Principles of Whistling\" mentions Sun Deng and Ruan Ji—honorifically called Sun Gong 孫公 \"Master Sung\" and Ruan Sizong 阮嗣宗 (his courtesy name)—as the last transcendental whistlers, and describes whistling tunes attributed to them, \"Sumen Mountains\" retells the story of Ruan's visit to Sun, and \"Loose Rhymes of Ruan\" is an easy-whistling melody.\n\nThe \"Xiaozhi\" Preface gives a transmission history of \"xiao\"-whistling that goes from mythological sages to the historical whistlers of Sun Deng and Ruan Ji (adapted from Edwards 1957: 219-220). Laozi transmitted the technique to Queen Mother of the West, up through Emperor Shun, who transmitted whistling to Yu the Great, \"after whom the art declined. It revived with the Immortal of the Jin dynasty Sun Gong of Taihang Mountains. Sun found the Way (adopted the Daoist rule of life) and disappeared. Ruan Sizong had a smattering of the art but after him it was quite lost, and whistling was no longer heard.\"\n\nTwo \"Xiaozhi\" sections describe whistling tunes attributed to Sun Deng and Ruan Ji, \"Sumen Mountain\" (11) and \"The Loose Rhymes of Ruan\" (13). \"Sumen [Mountain]\" 蘇門 retells the story of Ruan Ji visiting Sun Deng, referred to as the Daoist master living on Sumen, like the \"Shishuo xinyu\" above.\nThe 'Su Men' was composed by the Taoist Immortal Recluse, who lived in the Su Men Mountains (of Honan). The Holy One transmitted, he did not make it. The Immortal transmitted (the music of) Kuang Ch'eng and Wu Kuang 務光 in order to rejoice the spirit and expand the Tao. He did not regard music as the main task. In olden days there were those who roved in Su Men listening to the phoenix' songs. The notes were exquisitely clear, very different from the so-called pretended phoenix. The phoenix makes sounds but humans cannot hear them. How then can the Su Family know the sound of the phoenix? Hereafter, when seeking the sound, bring up the Immortal's whistle. The Immortal's whistle does not stop at fostering the Tao and gratifying the spirits; for indeed, in everyday affairs it brings harmony into the world, and peace in season. In oneself the Tao never dies, in objective matters it assists all that is sacred, and conducts the Five Influences. In the arcana of Nature order prevails. For success in obtaining response (to such efforts) nothing approaches music. The Immortal has evolved the one successful form. As to all wild things whistling is the one thing needful. Yuan Szu-tsung of Chin (Yuan Chi) was a fine whistler. Hearing that the Immortal thought himself his equal, he (Yuan) went to visit him. The Immortal remained seated with his hair in disorder. Yuan bowed repeatedly and inquired after his health. Thrice and again thrice he addressed his (uncivil) host. The Immortal maintained his attitude and made no response. Chi then whistled some score of notes and left. The Immortal, estimating that his guest had not gone far, began to whistle the Ch'ing Chueh [清角] to the extent of four or five movements. But Chi perceived that the mountains and all growing things took on a different sound. Presently came a fierce whirlwind with pelting rain, followed by phoenixes and peacocks in flocks; no one could count them. Chi was alarmed, but also pleased, and he returned home and wrote down the story. He obtained only two-tenths of it, and called it 'Su Men'. This is what they tell there. The motif of the song is lofty mountains and wide marshes, great heights and distances. (tr. Edwards 1957: 226) \nThe \"Loose Rhymes of Ruan\" section says,\nThe 'Loose Rhymes of the Yuan' were really composed by Yuan Chi. The rhymes are free and easy; hence the title. … Both persons of refinement and culture and commonplace and mean folk can listen with appreciation. The majesty of the heavenly principle, purged from all miasmic influence, may mingle with the ordinary music of the Hsuan and the Ch'ih, and the music of Cheng and Yueh enter the ear. Most good whistlers can perform this air. Whenever persons retired in the woods and by springs puff out wind and by accident produce a rhymed sound, if their attempt misses success, it is simply a misfire; if it is completely successful then it remains. The above gives a general idea of the 'Loose Rhymes of the Yuan'. (tr. Edwards 1957: 227) \nThese ancient instruments are the \"xun\" 塤 \"a globular ocarina\" and \"chi\" 篪 \"a transverse bamboo flute\", and these Zhou dynasty states were Zheng and Yue.\n\nThe \"Standard Notes\" section (14, tr. Edwards 1957: 227) mentions Sun Deng and Daoist immortality, \"In comparatively modern days, Sun Kung was successful, but people did not listen. As to peaceful notes [平和], they stave off old age and do not allow one to die. These Standard notes are known about, but the notes themselves are lost.\"\n\nThe \"Xiaozhi\" \"Conclusion\" section (15, tr. Edwards 1957: 228) says, \"The conclusion is at the extremities of the [pentatonic] scale, the end of the Great Tao. After the days of Yao and Shun there was some idea of these notes, but the actual notes were lost.\" It also dismisses the preface history with mythic whistlers like Queen Mother of the West and accepts the historicity of Sun Deng's and Ruan Ji's whistling.\nis extravagant talk, and not usually accepted. But the twelve methods are found in Sun Teng and Yuan Chi, so that we can truly say we have the general purport of Whistling. The Preface also says that Sun Teng did not hand on (the gift) to anyone, and after Yuan Chi it disappeared and was no more heard. … Now the voice of man is the voice of the universe (nature). Man may be ancient or modern, but sound is eternal, never new or old. Now this book is going forth and who knows whether a Sun or Yuan may not appear in some mountains or woods and, that being so, who can say that there is an end to Whistling? (tr. Edwards 1957: 228) \n\nThe preeminent Chinese avant-garde author Ge Fei wrote the (1995) \"Hūshào\" 忽哨 \"Whistling\" short story, which is a modern update on the story about Sun and Ruan. Victor Mair, who translated \"Whistling\" into English, says\nAn old legend of the celebrated encounter between the two men has Ruan Ji visiting Sun Deng in his hermitage but not receiving any responses to his questions. Thereupon, he withdraws and, halfway up a distant mountain, lets out a loud, piercing whistle. This is followed by Sun Deng's magnificent whistled reply, which inspires Ruan Ji to write the \"Biography of Master Great Man,\" an encomium in praise of the Taoist \"true man\" that also satirizes the conventional Confucian \"gentleman\". (1998:43) \n\nGe Fei's \"Whistling\" tells how the young, famous poet Ruan Ji regularly came to visit the aged hermit Sun Deng on Su \nGate Mountain 蘇門山 in present-day Henan, and play games of \"weiqi\" \"go\". During one go game, Sun was silently pondering how to move a piece, and Ruan surprised him. \"When the whistling sound suddenly arose, Sun Deng was totally unprepared for it. The strange, strident sound, mixed with the sounds of the billowing pines, reverberated through the valleys of Su Gate Mountain for a long while without expiring.\" (tr. Mair 1998:43).\n\nAfter a final game of go, Ruan took his leave from Sun owing to the \"prolonged and profound silence that made him feel bored.\" Sun watches Ruan's silhouette gradually dissolving into the dark green distance,\nWhen the sound of whistling rose beneath the sunny empyrean, Sun Deng shuddered as though it were a bolt out of the blue. Shielding his eyes from the strong light with one hand, he saw Ruan Ji standing on the peak of Su Gate Mountain beneath a solitary tree. Against a backdrop of white clouds like thick cotton fleece, he stood motionless, seeing to wait for Sun Deng's answer. Sun Deng looked all around him, then quietly inserted his thumb and forefinger in his mouth—the extreme frailness of his body and the looseness of his teeth caused him to be unable to produce any sound. The shrill, desolate, plaintive whistle, accompanied by the soughing of the billowing pines, reverberated for a long time in the mountain valleys. It was like the sad wail of the poet who died long ago, penetrating through the barriers of time, continuing up till today, and sinking into the easily awakened dreams of a living person. (tr. Mair 1998: 68) \n\n\n"}

{"id": "443855", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=443855", "title": "William K. Wimsatt", "text": "William K. Wimsatt\n\nWilliam Kurtz Wimsatt Jr. (November 17, 1907 – December 17, 1975) was an American professor of English, literary theorist, and critic. Wimsatt is often associated with the concept of the intentional fallacy, which he developed with Monroe Beardsley in order to discuss the importance of an author's intentions for the creation of a work of art.\n\nWimsatt was born in Washington D.C., attended Georgetown University and, later, Yale University, where he received his Ph.D. In 1939, Wimsatt joined the English department at Yale, where he taught until his death in 1975. During his lifetime, Wimsatt became known for his studies of eighteenth-century literature (Leitch et al. 1372). He wrote many works of literary theory and criticism such as \"The Prose Style of Samuel Johnson\" (1941) and \"Philosophic Words: A Study of Style and Meaning in the \"Rambler\" and \"Dictionary\" of Samuel Johnson\" (1948; Leitch et al. 1372). His major works include \"The Verbal Icon: Studies in the Meaning of Poetry\" (1954); \"Hateful Contraries\" (1965) and \"Literary Criticism: A Short History\" (1957, with Cleanth Brooks). Wimsatt was considered crucial to New Criticism (particularly New Formalist Criticism; 1372). He was a member of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences.\n\nWimsatt was influenced by Monroe Beardsley, with whom he wrote some of his most important pieces. Wimsatt also drew on the work of both ancient critics, such as Longinus and Aristotle, and some of his own contemporaries, such as T. S. Eliot and the writers of the Chicago School, to formulate his theories, often by highlighting key ideas in those authors' works in order to refute them.\n\nWimsatt's ideas have affected the development of reader-response criticism, and his influence has been noted in the works of writers such as Stanley Fish, and in works such as Walter Benn Michaels' and Steven Knapp’s “Against Theory” (Leitch et al. 1373-1374).\n\nWimsatt was interviewed, along with Walter J. Ong, S.J., of Saint Louis University, by Sheila Hough on the 327th edition of the radio talk-show Yale Reports, broadcast on May 24, 1964, by WTIC-Hartford. (Professor Wimsatt had received an honorary doctorate from Saint Louis University in 1963.) Ms. Hough asked Professor Wimsatt a question that still resonates today: \"Is literature taught in complete isolation from its author, Mr. Wimsatt -- don't you consider the person who wrote it?\"\n\nWimsatt replied: \"I do, of course. Your question, I think, was prompted by that very fine essay of Father Ong's, 'The Jinnee in the Well-Wrought Urn,' which you read in his book \"The Barbarian Within\" [1962: 15-25]. It first appeared in \"Essays in Criticism\" at Oxford some years ago [1954], and was in part, I believe, an answer to an essay written many years ago, about twenty at least, by a friend of mine, Monroe Beardsley, and myself, called 'The Intentional Fallacy.' I would like to pay Father Ong the compliment of saying that I think that his essay 'The Jinnee in the Well-Wrought Urn' is the only sensible response that has ever been written to that essay of ours.\"\n\nAs a staunch formalist critic, Wimsatt believed in the authority of the poem: any analysis of a poem must centre on the text itself (Leitch et al. 1371-1372). He outlines and advocates (particularly in his two influential essays written with Monroe Beardsley, “The Intentional Fallacy” and “The Affective Fallacy”) an “objective criticism” in which the critic essentially disregards the intentions of the poet and the effect of the poem on the audience as the sole (or even the major) factors in analyzing and evaluating a poem (Davis and Schleifer 43).\n\nWimsatt does allow for a certain degree of variation in the analysis of poetry and does not necessarily contend that there is only one possible reading for any given poem. He allows, for example, for what he calls the “literary sense” of meaning, saying that “no two different words or different phrases ever mean fully the same” (Verbal Icon xii).\n\nMuch of his theory, however, appears to stem from an ambivalence towards \"impressionism, subjectivism, and relativism” (Leitch et al. 1373) in criticism. In \"Hateful Contraries\", Wimsatt refers to a “New Amateurism,” an “anti-criticism” emerging in works such as Leslie Fiedler’s “Credo,” which appeared in the \"Kenyon Review\". “The only reservation the theorist need have about such critical impressionism or expressionism,” says Wimsatt, “is that, after all, it does not carry on very far in our cogitation about the nature and value of literature…it is not a very mature form of cognitive discourse” (\"Hateful Contraries\" xvi).\n\nIndeed, Wimsatt is concerned with ensuring a level of legitimacy in English studies and he sets about doing so by favouring a scientific approach to criticism—even, for example, decrying affective theory as “less a scientific view of literature than a prerogative -- that of a soul adventuring among masterpieces” (\"Verbal Icon\" 29).\n\nWimsatt contributed several theories to the critical landscape, particularly through his major work, \"The Verbal Icon\" (of which some of the ideas are discussed below). His ideas generally centre around the same questions tackled by many critics: what is poetry and how does one evaluate it?\n\nPerhaps Wimsatt’s most influential theories come from the essays “The Intentional Fallacy” and “The Affective Fallacy” (both are published in \"Verbal Icon\") which he wrote with Monroe Beardsley. Each of these texts “codifies a crucial tenet of New Critical formalist orthodoxy,” making them both very important to twentieth-century criticism (Leitch et al. 1371).\n\nThe Intentional Fallacy, according to Wimsatt, derives from “confusion between the poem and its origins” (\"Verbal Icon\" 21) – essentially, it occurs when a critic puts too much emphasis on personal, biographical, or what he calls “external” information when analyzing a work (they note that this is essentially the same as the “Genetic fallacy” in philosophical studies; 21). Wimsatt and Beardsley consider this strategy a fallacy partly because it is impossible to determine the intention of the author — indeed, authors themselves are often unable to determine the “intention” of a poem — and partly because a poem, as an act that takes place between a poet and an audience, has an existence outside of both and thus its meaning can not be evaluated simply based on the intentions of or the effect on either the writer or the audience(see the section of this article entitled “The Affective Fallacy\" for a discussion of the latter; 5). For Wimsatt and Beardsley, intentional criticism becomes subjective criticism, and so ceases to be criticism at all. For them, critical inquiries are resolved through evidence in and of the text — not “by consulting the oracle” (18).\n\nThe Affective fallacy (identified in the essay of the same name, which Wimsatt co-authored with Monroe Beardsley, as above) refers to “confusion between the poem and its \"results\"” (\"Verbal Icon 21\"; italics in original). It refers to the error of placing too much emphasis on the effect that a poem has on its audience when analyzing it.\n\nWimsatt and Beardsley argue that the effect of poetic language alone is an unreliable way to analyze poetry because, they contend, words have no effect in and of themselves, independent of their meaning. It is impossible, then, for a poem to be “pure emotion” (38), which means that a poem’s meaning is not “equivalent to its effects, especially its emotional impact, on the reader” (Leitch et al. 1371).\n\nAs with the Intentional fallacy, engaging in affective criticism is too subjective an exercise to really warrant the label “criticism” at all — thus, for Wimsatt and Beardsley, it is a fallacy of analysis.\n\nIn “The Concrete Universal,” Wimsatt attempts to determine how specific or general (i.e., concrete or universal) a verbal representation must be in order to achieve a particular effect. What is the difference, for example, between referring to a “purple cow” and a “tan cow with a broken horn” (\"Verbal Icon\" 74)? In addressing such questions, Wimsatt attempts to resolve what it is that makes poetry different from other forms of communication, concluding that “what distinguishes poetry from scientific or logical discourse is a degree of concreteness which does not contribute anything to the argument but is somehow enjoyable or valuable for its own sake.” For Wimsatt, poetry is “the vehicle of a metaphor which one boards heedless of where it runs, whether cross-town or downtown — just for the ride” (76).\n\nIn “The Domain of Criticism,” Wimsatt “[defends] the domain of poetry and poetics from the encircling (if friendly) arm of the general aesthetician\" (\"Verbal Icon\" 221) – that is, he discusses the problems with discussing poetry in purely aesthetic terms. Wimsatt questions the ability of a poem to function aesthetically in the same way as a painting or sculpture. For one, visual modes such as sculpture or painting are undertaken using materials that directly correlate with the object they represent — at least in terms of their “beauty.” A beautiful painting of an apple, for example, is done with beautiful paint.\n\nVerbal expression, however, does not function this way — as Wimsatt points out, there is no such thing as a “beautiful” or “ugly” word (or, at least, there is no general consensus as to how to apply such concepts in such a context; 228). There is no correlation between words and their subject, at least in terms of aesthetics — “the example of the dunghill (or equivalent object) beautifully described is one of the oldest in literary discussion” (228).\n\nMore importantly, language does not function merely on the level of its effects on the senses, as (for example) visual modes do. A poem does not just derive its meaning from its rhyme and meter, but these are the domains of aesthetics (231) — to analyse poetry on the basis of its aesthetics, then, is insufficient in one is to adequately explore its meaning.\n\nWritten as a series of independent essays between 1941 and 1952, \"The Verbal Icon\" was finally published as a cohesive work (after Wimsatt revised some of the original versions) in 1954. Probably his most influential work, \"The Verbal Icon\" contains two of Wimsatt's most important essays, “The Intentional Fallacy” and “The Affective Fallacy” (co-authored with Monroe Beardsley). Paul de Man offers a significant critique of Wimsatt's text, taken as an example of the understanding of the notion of 'autonomy' in New Criticism, in \"Blindness and Insight\".\n\nApparently concerned with the (admittedly lessened) influence of what he calls “Amateur Criticism,” Wimsatt published \"Hateful Contraries\" in 1965 as a way to “distinguish what [he] consider[s] an inevitable and proper literary interest in the contraries” (Hateful Contraries xviii). Through studies of works by T. S. Eliot as well as discussions of topics such as “The Augustan Mode in English Poetry” and “The Criticism of Comedy” (xi), Wimsatt attempts to add to the efforts to justify and improve literary criticism (xix).\n\nWritten with Cleanth Brooks in 1957, \"Literary Criticism: A Short History\" is intended as “a history of ideas about verbal art and about its elucidation and criticism” (Wimsatt and Brooks ix). The authors attempt to contribute to the “intelligibility in the history of literary argument” as well as “contributes to a distinct point of view,” which, they argue, is a necessary part of any historical literary studies (vii).\n\n\n"}

He is the author of the international bestsellers \"\" (2014), \"\" (2016), and \"21 Lessons for the 21st Century\" (2018). His writings examine free will, consciousness and intelligence.\n\nHarari's early publications are concerned with what he describes as the \"cognitive revolution\" occurring roughly 50,000 years ago, when Homo sapiens supplanted the rival Neanderthals, developed language skills and structured societies, and ascended as apex predators, aided by the agricultural revolution and more recently accelerated by scientific methodology and rationale which have allowed humans to approach near mastery over their environment.\n\nHis recent books are more cautionary, and work through the consequences of a futuristic biotechnological world where intelligent biological organisms are surpassed by their own creations; he has said \"Homo sapiens as we know them will disappear in a century or so\".\n\nHarari was born in Kiryat Ata, Israel, in 1976 and grew up in a secular Jewish family with Lebanese and Eastern European roots in Haifa, Israel. In 2002 he met his husband Itzik Yahav, whom he calls \"my internet of all things\". Yahav is also Harari's personal manager. They married in a civil ceremony in Toronto in Canada. The couple lives in a moshav (a type of cooperative agricultural community of individual farms), Mesilat Zion, near Jerusalem.\n\nHarari says Vipassana meditation, which he began whilst in Oxford in 2000, has \"transformed my life\". He practises for two hours every day (one hour at the start and end of his work day), every year undertakes a meditation retreat of 30 days or longer, in silence and with no books or social media, and is an assistant meditation teacher. He dedicated \"\" to \"my teacher, S. N. Goenka, who lovingly taught me important things,\" and said \"I could not have written this book without the focus, peace and insight gained from practising Vipassana for fifteen years.\" He also regards meditation as a way to research.\n\nHarari is a vegan, and says this resulted from his research, including his view that the foundation of the dairy industry is breaking the bond between mother and calf cows. As of September 2017, he does not have a smartphone.\n\nHarari first specialized in medieval history and military history in his studies from 1993 to 1998 at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He completed his DPhil (doctorate) degree at Jesus College, Oxford, in 2002 under the supervision of Steven J. Gunn. From 2003 to 2005 he pursued postdoctoral studies in history as a Yad Hanadiv Fellow.\n\nHe has published numerous books and articles, including \"Special Operations in the Age of Chivalry, 1100–1550\";\n\"The Ultimate Experience: Battlefield Revelations and the Making of Modern War Culture, 1450–2000\"; \"The Concept of 'Decisive Battles' in World History\"; and \"Armchairs, Coffee and Authority: Eye-witnesses and Flesh-witnesses Speak about War, 1100–2000\". He now specializes in world history and macro-historical processes.\n\nHis book \"\" was published in Hebrew in 2011 and then in English in 2014; it has since been translated into some 30 additional languages. The book surveys the entire length of human history, from the evolution of Homo sapiens in the Stone Age up to the political and technological revolutions of the 21st century. The Hebrew edition became a bestseller in Israel, and generated much interest both in the academic community and among the general public, turning Harari into a celebrity.\nYouTube video clips of Harari's Hebrew lectures on the history of the world have been viewed by tens of thousands of Israelis.\n\nHarari also gives a free online course in English titled \"A Brief History of Humankind\".\n\nHis book \"\" was published in 2016, examining possibilities of the future of \"Homo sapiens\". The book's premise outlines that in the future, humanity is likely to make a significant attempt to gain happiness, immortality and God-like powers. The book goes on to openly speculate various ways this ambition might be realised for \"Homo sapiens\" in the future based on the past and present. Among several possibilities for the future, Harari develops a term for a philosophy or mindset that worships big data.\n\nHarari's most recent book is called \"21 Lessons for the 21st Century\" and focuses more on present-day concerns. It was published on 30 August 2018. In Chapter Two he addresses the increasing number of people made unemployable by advances in automation and AI. As an alternative to food stamps, welfare, etc. he proposes a Universal Basic Income for every citizen regardless of their employment status.\n\nHarari is interested in how \"Homo sapiens\" reached their current condition, and in their future. His research focuses on macro-historical questions such as: What is the relation between history and biology? What is the essential difference between \"Homo sapiens\" and other animals? Is there justice in history? Does history have a direction? Did people become happier as history unfolded?\n\nHarari regards dissatisfaction as the \"deep root\" of human reality, and as related to evolution.\n\nIn a 2017 article Harari has argued that through continuing technological progress and advances in the field of artificial intelligence, \"by 2050 a new class of people might emerge – the useless class. People who are not just unemployed, but unemployable.\" He put forward the case that dealing with this new social class economically, socially and politically will be a central challenge for humanity in the coming decades.\n\nHarari has commented on the plight of animals, particularly domesticated animals since the agricultural revolution, and is a vegan. In a 2015 \"Guardian\" article under the title \"Industrial farming is one of the worst crimes in history\" he called \"[t]he fate of industrially farmed animals (...) one of the most pressing ethical questions of our time.\"\n\nHarari twice won the Polonsky Prize for \"Creativity and Originality\", in 2009 and 2012. In 2011 he won the Society for Military History's Moncado Award for outstanding articles in military history. In 2012 he was elected to the Young Israeli Academy of Sciences.\n\n\n\n"}
