After receiving his early education at the Caroline academy of Stuttgart, he entered the University of Tübingen, where he was given the degree of doctor of medicine. He practised for some time as a physician at Sulz, and then at Kirchheim, and in 1811 he was chosen extraordinary professor of philosophy and medicine at Tübingen. In 1818 he became ordinary professor of practical philosophy, but in 1836 he resigned and took up his residence at Kirchheim, where he devoted his whole attention to philosophical studies.\n\nEschenmayer's views are largely identical with those of Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling, but he differed from him in regard to the knowledge of the absolute. He believed that in order to complete the arc of truth, philosophy must be supplemented by what he called \"non-philosophy\" (), a kind of mystical illumination by which was obtained a belief in God that could not be reached by mere intellectual effort. He carried this tendency to mysticism into his physical researches, and was led by it to take a deep interest in the phenomena of animal magnetism. He ultimately became a devout believer in demoniacal and spiritual possession; and his later writings are all strongly impregnated with supernaturalism.\n\n\n\n"}

There he married Margaret Dongan, a judge's daughter, whom he portrayed lovingly in his book \"The Character of a Truly Virtuous and Pious Woman\". He was the brother of Gerard Boate, author of \"The Natural History of Ireland\", for which Arnold supplied much of the material. Both Gerard and Arnold were members of the Hartlib circle.\n\nBorn Arnold de Boot in Gorinchem in the Netherlands, he was a younger son of the knight Godfried de Boot (c.1570-1625) and his wife Christine van Loon. Like his brother he attended the University of Leiden and qualified as a doctor of medicine. He also developed a deep interest in Hebrew studies and in particular the correct reading of the Old Testament. His first book, co-written with Francis Taylor and entitled \"Examen Praefationis Morini in Biblia Graeca de Textus Ebraici et Graeci authoritate\" was published in Leiden in 1630.\n\nHe and his brother Gerard moved to London about 1630 to practice medicine. It was said that they became involved in a dispute with the Royal College of Physicians, but Arnold was lucky enough to become personal physician to Robert Sidney, 2nd Earl of Leicester. Leicester was later appointed Lord Deputy of Ireland and, though he never actually went to Ireland, he may have recommended Arnold to his Irish friends. Arnold's writings had already brought him to the attention of James Ussher, Archbishop of Armagh, and it was Ussher who invited Arnold to Ireland in 1636. He became Ussher's personal physician, and was later appointed Surgeon-General to the Irish Army. He also built up a flourishing private practice among the Dutch community in Dublin.\n\nIn 1641 Gerard and Arnold co-wrote \"Philosophia Naturalis Reformata\", an attack upon Aristotelianism. Arnold's experience as an army doctor also led him to write \"Diverse remarkable passages .. of our Army in Ireland (1642) \"and\" Observationes medicae de affectibus a veteribus omissis (1649).\n\nHis marriage, which was a love match, to Margaret Dongan, daughter of Thomas Dongan, judge of the Court of King's Bench (Ireland) and his first wife Grace Palmer strengthened his ties with the Irish Protestant ruling class, although his father-in-law, according to Elrington Ball, was not much respected, partly because he was known to be a Roman Catholic who conformed to the Protestant faith only for the purpose of his career. Arnold however wrote of Dongan in his memoir of Margaret with affection and respect. Dongan was a wealthy man, but suffered heavy losses during the Irish Rebellion of 1641. In 1644 Arnold decided to quit Ireland. He moved briefly to stay with his brother in London but then settled permanently in Paris. Much of his later career was spent in scholarly dispute with Louis Capel who had\nquestioned his Biblical readings and the result was a lengthy pamphlet war, involving several scholars on both sides, including Ussher.\n\nLike his brother he was a member of the Hartlib Circle, the circle of scholars who corresponded with Samuel Hartlib on scientific, religious and political issues, and he is credited with having established the Irish branch of the circle; even after he left Ireland he acted as a conduit between Hartlib and Ussher. Gerard's most famous work \"The Natural History of Ireland\" was written at Hartlib's suggestion from material collected by Arnold. After Gerard's death in 1650 Hartlib suggested that Arnold continue the work, but Arnold himself died in Paris in 1653.\n\nOn Christmas Day 1642 Arnold married Margaret Dongan (1626-1651). Of their three children two died young. Mariana, their only surviving daughter, married Marcus Beyerman. Margaret died in April 1651 from complications during pregnancy.\n\nArnold was devoted to his wife and shortly after her death published a remarkable tribute, \"The Character of a Truly Virtuous and Pious Woman as it has been acted by Mistress Margaret Dongan\", which was dedicated to Thomas Sydserf, Bishop of Galloway\n. It paints a picture of a young woman notable for beauty, religious fervour, kindness, peaceful nature, charity and family loyalty\n\n"}

The order is closely tied to the Ba'Alawi sadah family.\n\nIt was founded by al-Faqih Muqaddam As-Sayyid Muhammad bin Ali Ba'Alawi al-Husaini, who died in the year 653 AH (1232 CE). He received his ijazah from Abu Madyan in Morocco via two of his students. Abu Madyan was a student of Abdul Qadir Jilani, as well as one of the shaikhs in the Shadhiliya tariqa chain of spiritual transmitters from Muhammad. The members of this Sufi way are mainly sayyids whose ancestors hail from the valley of Hadramaut, in the southern part of Yemen, although it is not limited to them.\n\nThe chain of ijazah of spiritual Sufi transmission from al-Faqih Muqaddam Sayyid Muhammad traces back to the Islamic prophet Muhammad via his cousin Ali and from him, his son Husain. \n\nThe name Ba'Alawi itself is a Hadhrami contraction of the terms Bani 'Alawi or the Clan of 'Alawi.\n\nIn the early 4th Century Hijri at 318 H, Sayyid Ahmad al-Muhaajir bin Isa ar-Rumi bin Muhammad al-Naqib bin Ali al-Uraidhi ibn Ja'far al-Sadiq migrated from Basrah, Iraq first to Mecca and Medina, and then to Hadhramout, to avoid the chaos then prevalent in the Abbassid Caliphate, where descendants of Muhammad were continuously being suspected of arson and revolt against the caliph. Most descendants of Muhammad known as sayyids enjoyed much followings due to their steep knowledge in Islam and its teachings, both esoteric and exoteric. Although such personalities may not have political ambitions, having huge followings means that they always attract the suspicions of the caliphate.\n\nThe name 'Alawi refers to the grandson of Sayyid Ahmad al-Muhajir, who was the first descendant of Husain, Muhammad's grandson, to be born in Hadramaut and the first to bear such a name.\n\nThus all the 'Alawi sayyids of Hadramaut are his progeny, and his descendants has since spread far and wide to the Arabian Peninsula, India especially in northern states of Surat and Ahmadebad and along the Malabar Coasts, North and West Coast of Africa, India, and the countries of the Malay Archipelago spreading Sunni Islam of the Shafii school and the Ba'Alawi Tariqah brand of Sufism.\n\nBa 'Alawiyya Sufi order, according to historians, is linked to Madyaniyya Sufi order. It is also influenced by Qadiriyya, all because the founder, Muhammad al-Faqih al-Muqaddam received the spiritual transmissions from them. Hadhramaut during his life was torn by constant tribal fights. al-Muqaddam advised the descendants of the Sayyid to abandon arms and wars and instead to pursue religious and moral values. As the founding father of the Sufism in Hadhramaut, he received the title of the \"Qutb al-Irshad wa Ghausil al-'Ibad Wa al-Bilad\" () of the Ba 'Alawiyya Sufi order, which is the highest rank in Sufism (see also Abdal). Initially, the followers of Ba 'Alawiyya functioned secretly for about five centuries.\n\nLike many other Sufi orders, Ba 'Alawi order supports the doctrine of outward (\"zahir\") and inward (\"batin\"). The outward aspect of this tariqa consists of pursuing religious sciences and ritual practices while its inward aspect is the attainment of Sufi stations (\"maqamat\") and states (\"ahwal\"). The virtues of the order is that its adherents never disclose their secrets (\"sawn al-asrar\") and they preserve them from uninitiated. The outward aspect follows Al-Ghazali's practices as described in his \"Ihya Ulum al-Deen\", while the inward aspect is similar to Shadiliyya Sufi order.\n\nThe basic doctrine of Ba 'Alawiyya is the purification of heart through saintly life. Even Though it is a Sufism and an offshoot of Qadiriyya, but it does not have \"Khalwah\" (seclusion for purposes of spiritual exercise) and does not renounce worldly activities. It also emphasizes the teaching and practicing \"Akhlaq\" as exemplified by the Prophet Muhammad.\n\nImam Ahmad bin Isa al-Muhajir and his son, according to majority of historians, spread the legal school of Shafi'i and Ash'ari for theology. A few historians had pointed out that Ba 'Alawis incline to Shiism because many of the Shiites had followed some of the order of Ba Alawis in certain regions In fact, some of the practices done in Ba'Alawiyya are similar to Shiah's practices, such as Ziyarat or building Shrines.\n\nR.B. Serjeant summarizes the main points of Ba 'Alawiyya tariqa: The Sayyids affirm it is the best \"Tariqa\" based on al-Qur'an and Sunnah and the beliefs of pious ancestors (\"al-Aslaf Shalihin\"), but act with humility, piety and lofty motive. The follower must love obscurity, dislike manifestation, withdraw from madding crowd, but he still has to warn and advice in matters of religious duty. He must also show kindness to his family, relatives, neighbors, friends, acquaintances, tribes and to all other Muslims.\n\nThe tradition was transmitted orally in its first generation, so no books were written. Later on, transmission through writing became more important to clarify some obscurity. Books such as \"al-Burqa\", \"al-Ma'arij\", \"al-Kibrit al-Ahmar\", \"al-Juz al-Latif\" were then written to preserve the gradual disappearance of the tariqa. The tariqa also teaches the adherents to give da'wah and disseminate Islam peacefully without violence. This explains why Islam could have spread easily in South East Asian countries and was accepted by the indigenous people, where the followers brought Islam peacefully and mostly through trading and marriage (this because the men did not bring their wives abroad).\n\nBa 'Alawiyya followers also practice other outward-aspect traditions not taught in \"Ihya Ulum al-Deen\". For example, it is common for the Ba 'Alawiyya followers in the past, mainly in Hadhramaut and Malay Archipelago, to perform Taqbil, especially to respected Habibs. Annual spiritual activities such as Mawlid, \"Khaul\" (anniversary commemoration of the death of a family member or to highly respected persons in the community), or practices performed routinely such as \"Majlis Dhikr\" (Dhikr assemblies, usually by reciting or such as \"Wird al-Latif\" or \"Ratib\" by Habib Abdullah bin Alwi al-Haddad after every Fajr and Maghrib time), \"Tahlil\" (another form of Dhikr assembly, but usually is performed if somebody dies), Reading of classical Islamic books, and Ziyarat are practices followed by Ba 'Alawiyya. During these events it is not uncommon to see Haḍras and Qasidas also recited and sometimes accompanied with Rebanas. Some of the above practices (such as mawlid or qasida) even performed in wedding ceremonies by Ba 'Alawi communities.\n\nThe influences of Ba 'Alawi tariqa can be found also in a few large Islamic organizations. For example, the rituals performed by members of Nahdlatul Ulama such as \"Tahlil\", mawlid or ziyarat are all influenced by and can be traced back to the Ba 'Alawiyya teachings, where Hadhrami of Ba 'Alawiyya migrated and taught the tariqa in Java since 18th centuries.\n\nSome of the prominent figures of this tariqa are:\nIn Hadhramaut, the teaching of this tariqa is done in several Ribath, such as \"Ribath Tarim\" or at Dar al-Mustafa founded by Habib Umar bin Hafiz.\n\n\n\n"}

Brahmvidya is the knowledge and spiritual knowledge of divine faith/God/existence. Put together, it means knowledge of the mantra/absolute. Brahmavidya is considered to be the highest ideal of classical. Brahmvidya does not pertain to hinduism, many other faiths practice and learn brahmvidya through different means, the Sikhs practice and learn brahmvidya through their Guru, the eternal Guru of the Sikhs, Guru Granth Sahib Ji. Each faith teaches about the divine through different studies, yet the brahmvidya is one and the same - Truth itself.\n\nIn the Puranas, this is divided into two branches, the first one dealing with the vedic mantras and is called para vidya or former knowledge, and the latter dealing with the study of the upanishads and is called the apara vidya or latter knowledge. Both para and apara vidya constitute brahma vidya.\n\nBrahma - The word \"brahma\" is used in modern Hinduism to refer to the name of a god who is a part of the Hindu trinity, for more information see Brahman (disambiguation). However, in the context of traditional Vedic study, it holds two meanings. In the Pūrva Mimamsa philosophy, which is based on a study of the samhita and brahmana sections of the vedas, the word brahma refers to the vedic mantras. In the uttara Mimamsa i.e. Vedanta philosophy, which is based on a study of the Aranyaka and the Upanishad sections of the vedas, the word \"Brahma\" means the absolute universal reality called Brahman.\n\nVidya - The word \"vidyā\" (विद्या) means \"knowledge,\" and is derived from the Sanskrit verbal root -\"vid\"- (\"to know\"), also seen in the word Veda. Its cognates in other Indo-European languages are: \n\nIn modern Hinduism, Brahmavidya is used to mean a spiritual study of Hindu scriptures with the aim of realizing the ultimate reality. Different modern Hindu leaders have defined it in the context of their own systems of philosophy.\n\nSwami Sivananda, the founder of the Divine Life Society opines that Brahmavidya is the \"Science of sciences\" or the \"Science of the Absolute\".\n"}
{"id": "26105774", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26105774", "title": "Climatic Research Unit documents", "text": "Climatic Research Unit documents\n\nClimatic Research Unit documents including thousands of e-mails and other computer files were stolen from a server at the Climatic Research Unit of the University of East Anglia in a hacking incident in November 2009. The documents were redistributed first through several blogs of global warming skeptics, who alleged that the documents indicated misconduct by leading climate scientists. A series of investigations rejected these allegations, while concluding that CRU scientists should have been more open with distributing data and methods on request. Precisely six committees investigated the allegations and published reports, finding no evidence of fraud or scientific misconduct. The scientific consensus that global warming is occurring as a result of human activity remained unchanged by the end of the investigations.\n\nThe incident occurred shortly before the opening December 2009 Copenhagen global climate summit. It has prompted general discussion about increasing the openness of scientific data (though the majority of climate data have always been freely available). Scientists, scientific organisations, and government officials have stated that the incident does not affect the overall scientific case for climate change. Andrew Revkin reported in \"The New York Times\" that \"The evidence pointing to a growing human contribution to global warming is so widely accepted that the hacked material is unlikely to erode the overall argument.\"\n\nThe material comprised more than 1,000 e-mails, 2,000 documents, as well as commented source code, pertaining to climate change research covering a period from 1996 until 2009. Some of the e-mails which have been widely publicised included discussions of how to combat the arguments of climate change sceptics, unflattering comments about sceptics, queries from journalists, and drafts of scientific papers. There have been assertions that these discussions indicated efforts to shut out dissenters and their points of view, and included discussions about destroying files in order to prevent them from being revealed under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000.\nA review by the Associated Press of all the e-mails found that they did not support claims of faking of science, but did show disdain for sceptical critics. Scientists had discussed avoiding sharing information with critics, but the documents showed no evidence that any data was destroyed. Researchers also discussed in e-mails how information they had released on request was used by critics to make personal attacks on researchers. In an interview with \"The Guardian\", Phil Jones said \"Some of the emails probably had poorly chosen words and were sent in the heat of the moment, when I was frustrated. I do regret sending some of them. We've not deleted any emails or data here at CRU.\" He confirmed that the e-mails that had sparked the most controversy appeared to be genuine.\n\nMost of the e-mails concerned technical and mundane aspects of climate research, such as data analysis and details of scientific conferences. The controversy has focused on a small number of e-mails, particularly those sent to or from climatologists Phil Jones, the head of the CRU, and Michael E. Mann of Pennsylvania State University (PSU), one of the originators of the graph of temperature trends dubbed the \"hockey stick graph\".\n\nClimate change sceptics gained wide publicity for allegations that the hacked e-mails showed climate scientists colluded in manipulating data, withheld scientific information, and tried to prevent dissenting scientific papers from being published in peer reviewed journals. Academics and climate change researchers said that nothing in the emails proved wrongdoing, and dismissed the allegations. Independent reports said that the e-mails did not affect evidence that man made global warming is a real threat, and e-mails were being misrepresented to support unfounded claims of scientific misconduct, but there were disturbing suggestions that scientists had avoided sharing scientific data with sceptical critics.\n\nThe Information Commissioner's Office stated that \"the \"prima facie\" evidence from the published e-mails indicate an attempt to defeat disclosure by deleting information. It is hard to imagine more cogent \"prima facie\" evidence. ... The fact that the elements of a [FOIA] section 77 offence may have been found here, but cannot be acted on because of the elapsed time, is a very serious matter.\" The Science and Technology Select Committee criticised the ICO for making \"a statement to the press that went beyond that which it could substantiate\", but also blamed the university for mishandling Freedom of Information requests and called for a full investigation to resolve the questions raised.\n\nThe Associated Press conducted a review of the e-mails and concluded that they showed scientists fending off sceptics, but did not support claims that global warming science had been faked. They stated that \"One of the most disturbing elements suggests an effort to avoid sharing scientific data with critics skeptical of global warming\", and mentioned ethical problems with this action due to the fact that \"free access to data is important so others can repeat experiments as part of the scientific method\". They cited a science policy expert as stating that it was \"normal science politics, but on the extreme end, though still within bounds\". The AP sent the emails to three climate scientists they selected as moderates, who did not change their view that man-made global warming is a real threat. The three scientists are on the record elsewhere supporting an outside, independent review of the allegations of misconduct at both the CRU and Pennsylvania State University.\n\nSummarising its own analysis, FactCheck stated that claims by climate sceptics that the emails demonstrated scientific misconduct amounting to fabrication of global warming were unfounded, and emails were being misrepresented to support these claims. While the emails showed a few scientists being rude or dismissive, this did not negate evidence that human activities were largely responsible for global warming, or the conclusions of the 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report which used the CRU as just one of many sources of data.\n\nAn editorial in the scientific journal \"Nature\" stated that the e-mails had not shown anything that undermined the scientific case on human caused global warming, or raised any substantive reasons for concern about the researchers' own papers. Scientific openness requires public availability of data used to reach conclusions, but researchers had been hampered in this by contractual restrictions on some data, and in certain countries national meteorological services were too slow to provide data sets on request. The e-mail theft highlighted \"the harassment that denialists inflict on some climate-change researchers, often in the form of endless, time-consuming demands for information under the US and UK Freedom of Information Acts. Governments and institutions need to provide tangible assistance for researchers facing such a burden.\" While scientists are human and \"unrelenting opposition to their work can goad them to the limits of tolerance\", they \"should strive to act and communicate professionally, and make their data and methods available to others, lest they provide their worst critics with ammunition.\"\n\nThe IPCC's chairman, Rajendra Pachauri, described the CRU's scientists \"as highly reputed professionals, whose contributions over the years to scientific knowledge are unquestionable\" and described their datasets as \"totally consistent with those from other institutions, on the basis of which far-reaching and meaningful conclusions were reached in the [2007 IPCC report].\"\n\nOn 24 November the University of East Anglia issued a statement on the contents of the e-mails: \"There is nothing in the stolen material which indicates that peer-reviewed publications by CRU, and others, on the nature of global warming and related climate change are not of the highest quality of scientific investigation and interpretation.\"\n\nIn its report to the Science and Technology Select Committee of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, the Institute of Physics stated that the emails reveal evidence of \"determined and coordinated refusals\" to comply with scientific traditions through \"manipulation of the publication and peer-review system\" and \"intolerance to challenge\". This report was used by climate sceptics to bolster claims that the problem of global warming is exaggerated. This forced the Institute of Physics to confirm that its position was that \"the basic science is well enough understood to be sure that our climate is changing, and that we need to take action now to mitigate that change.\" Many experts considered that the correction was still inadequate, with climatologist Andy Russell describing the allegation of data suppression as \"incorrect and irresponsible\". The institute said that the statement had been prepared by their energy subcommittee, but would not reveal who had produced it. It did say that the subcommittee included an IOP official named Peter Gill, whose company provides services to the energy industry and who has written that for many people, the subject of anthropogenic global warming \"has become a religion, so facts and analysis have become largely irrelevant\". The institute said that Gill was not the main source of information and that other members of the sub-committee were also critical of CRU. Evan Harris, a Liberal Democrat member of the Science and Technology Select Committee, said \"Members of the Institute of Physics ... may be concerned that the IOP is not as transparent as those it wishes to criticise.\" However the institute told the Guardian that the submission was \"approved by three members of its science board\" and supplied comments from an anonymous board member stating \"The institute should feel relaxed about the process by which it generated what is, anyway, a statement of the obvious... the points [the submission] makes are ones which we continue to support, that science should be practiced openly and in an unbiased way.\"\n\nThe most quoted phrase took words from an e-mail of 16 November 1999 written by Phil Jones which referred to a graph he was preparing as a diagram for the cover of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) statement on the status of global climate in 1999. Jones wrote:\n\nThe \"trick\" was a technique to combine data series, and \"the decline\" was a well known issue with Keith Briffa's reconstruction using certain tree ring proxies which appeared to decline after 1950, when measured temperatures were rising. The email was widely misquoted as a \"trick\" to \"hide the decline\" as though it referred to a decline in measured global temperatures, but this was obviously untrue as when the email was written temperatures were far from declining: 1998 had been the warmest year recorded. On 9 December 2009 Sarah Palin said the truncated phrase showed a \"highly politicised scientific circle\" had \"manipulated data to 'hide the decline' in global temperatures\", and at the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, senator Senator Jim Inhofe quoted Jones, and said \"Of course he means hide the decline in temperatures\".\n\nThe graph showed three series of paleoclimate reconstructions, based on records of tree rings, corals, ice cores, lake sediments, etc., along with historical and instrumental records. \"Mike's Nature trick\" referred to Michael E. Mann's paper on temperature trends published by Michael Mann in \"Nature\" in 1998, which combined various proxy records and related them to actual temperature records: it included a figure later dubbed the \"\"hockey stick\" graph, which clearly distinguished between the proxy and instrumental data. Mann described the \"trick\" as simply a concise way of showing the two kinds of data together while still clearly indicating which was which. He said that there was nothing \"hidden or inappropriate\" about it, and that his method of combining proxy data had been corroborated by numerous statistical tests and matched thermometer readings taken over the past 150 years. A press release by the University of East Anglia said that the \"trick\" was using instrumental data to meet a requirement of showing temperatures more recent than those covered by the proxy based temperature reconstructions, and that the use of the word \"trick\" was not intended to imply any deception. An editorial in \"Nature\" said that 'trick' was slang for a clever (and legitimate) technique.\n\nThe phrase \"hide the decline\" referred specifically to the divergence problem in which some post 1960 tree ring proxy data indicates a decline while measured temperatures rise. The reconstruction by Briffa \"et al.\" was based solely on tree ring data, which shows a strong correlation with temperature from the 19th century to the mid 20th century. They had published a statement on the divergence problem in 1998, and had recommended that the post 1960 part of their reconstruction should not be used. Jones stated that the email was \"written in haste\" and that, far from seeking to hide the decline, CRU had published a number of articles on the problem. The implications of the decline are discussed in Chapter 2 of the IPCC Third Assessment Report, and in Chapter 6 of the 2007 IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) which describes discussion of various possible reasons for the divergence which does not affect all the trees, and says that there is no consensus about the cause. It notes that Briffa \"et al.\" specifically excluded the post 1960 data, which is therefore not shown in the graph of their tree ring reconstruction in the AR4 report.\n\nJohn Tierney wrote in \"The New York Times\" that \"the graph adorned the cover of a report intended for policy makers and journalists. The nonexperts wouldn’t have realized that the scariest part of that graph — the recent temperatures soaring far above anything in the previous millennium — was based on a completely different measurement from the earlier portion. It looked like one smooth, continuous line leading straight upward to certain doom.\" Tierney quotes Michael E. Mann replying to a skeptic who raised this very issue about tree-ring data at the RealClimate blog, \"No researchers in this field have ever, to our knowledge, ‘grafted the thermometer record onto’ any reconstruction. It is somewhat disappointing to find this specious claim (which we usually find originating from industry-funded climate disinformation Web sites) appearing in this forum.\" Tierney continued, \"Dr. Mann now tells me that he was unaware, when he wrote the response, that such grafting had in fact been done in the earlier cover chart, and I take him at his word. But I don’t see why the question was dismissed so readily, with the implication that only a tool of the fossil-fuel industry would raise it.\" \n\nIn December 2009, most scientists interviewed by \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\" considered there was ample other evidence supporting the original graph and they had not changed their views on the issues. In an exception, Richard Lindzen of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology alleged that the emails \"explicitly refer to falsification and rigging of data\" in covering up the divergence problem of tree ring proxies for the 1960s, which he said called earlier periods into question, and said \"The trick here is replacing the kind of data you're using with something to make it look different.\". Other climatologists disputed Lindzen's accusations. Thomas Peterson of the National Climatic Data Center said he had seen nothing in the emails that called the fundamental science into question, and Andrew Solow of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution agreed that there was no trickery, saying he would use the word trick to describe some methodological step, but expressed the view that the basis of reconstructions had been unclear. Several scientific sources state that the decline being referred to is a decline in tree ring climate proxy metrics, not temperature. Andrew Watson, Royal Society Research Professor at the UEA, said that the scientists had drawn the line to follow the tree-ring reconstruction up to 1960 and the measured temperature after that.\"\nBefore the incident, Mann and others had presented reconstructions based on more proxies, and found similar results with or without the tree ring records.\nThe United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) had issued an \"endangerment finding\" in 2009 in preparation for climate regulations on excessive greenhouse gases. Petitions to reconsider this citing the email were raised by the state of Texas and conservative activists and business groups the Coalition for Responsible Regulation, the Southeastern Legal Foundation, the Competitive Enterprise Institute and the coal company Peabody Energy. They said the email \"evidences CRU staff’s effort to deliberately manipulate data to yield desired results\", and highlighted the word \"trick\". The Southeastern Legal Foundation said it showed \"an attempt to cook the books to conceal the fact that the famous ‘hockey stick’ is a manipulated, misleading barrel of scientific nonsense.\" The EPA rejected these allegations as both irrelevant and inaccurate, noting that the WMO cover illustration by Jones bore no relationship to the IPCC assessment reports, and used different methods. The issues with tree rings had not been hidden, but were extensively discussed in scientific literature and in IPCC reports. The EPA agreed with the UK Science & Technology Committee conclusion that \"We are content that the phrases such as 'trick' or 'hiding the decline' were colloquial terms used in private e-mails, and the balance of evidence is that they were not part of a systematic attempt to mislead.\"\n\nIn response to an e-mail mentioning a recent paper in the scientific journal \"Climate Research\" that questioned assertions that the 20th century was abnormally warm, Mann wrote in an e-mail of 11 March 2003:\n\nMann told the \"Wall Street Journal\" that he didn't feel there was anything wrong in saying \"we shouldn't be publishing in a journal that's activist.\"\n\nMann was not alone in expressing concern about the peer review process of the journal. Half of the journal's editorial board, including editor-in-chief Hans von Storch, resigned in the wake of controversy surrounding the article's publication. The publisher later admitted that the paper's major findings could not \"be concluded convincingly from the evidence provided in the paper. [\"Climate Research\"] should have requested appropriate revisions of the manuscript prior to publication.\"\n\nIn an 18 December 2009 column in \"The Wall Street Journal\" (WSJ), Pat Michaels alleged that pressure from Jones and Mann was responsible for the resignations at \"Climate Research\". In a response also published in the WSJ, von Storch said that he left the post as chief editor of \"Climate Research\" \"with no outside pressure, because of insufficient quality control on a bad paper – a skeptic's paper, at that.\" Michaels said the incident demonstrated how peer reviewed literature had been biased to prevent himself and others of like mind from publishing. In a response published by the WSJ, Mann said the only bias was for \"well-reasoned writing that is buttressed by facts\" and climate skeptics such as Richard Lindzen and John Christy had no problems with publishing their work in mainstream journals. He pointed to presidential science adviser John Holdren's 2003 statement that Michaels had \"published little if anything of distinction in the professional literature, being noted rather for his shrill op-ed pieces and indiscriminate denunciations of virtually every finding of mainstream climate science.\"\n\nThe independent review commissioned by the University of East Anglia found that the strong reaction of the scientists to the Soon and Baliunas paper \"was understandable, and did not amount to undue pressure on Climate Research.\"\n\nThe United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was petitioned about this issue by the Coalition for Responsible Regulation, the Ohio Coal Association, Peabody Energy, the Southeastern Legal Foundation, and the State of Texas The EPA concluded that the emails expressed displeasure but did not show that any action was in fact taken, and it is \"expected and appropriate that researchers choose in which journals to publish, as well as recommend to their peers journals in which to publish or not publish. In this case, the bottom line is that the underlying science at issue has been shown to be flawed. The scientists’ actions were focused on this lack of scientific merit and the process that lead to it, and not an attempt to distort the science or the scientific literature.\" The EPA considered that \"If anything, their actions aimed to police the peer review process and rectify a problem that threatened its scientific integrity.\"\n\nIn July 2004, referring to \"Climate Research\" having published a paper by \"MM\", thought to be Ross McKitrick and Pat Michaels, and another paper by Eugenia Kalnay and Ming Cai, Jones emailed his colleagues saying, \"I can't see either of these papers being in the next IPCC report. Kevin [Trenberth] and I will keep them out somehow – even if we have to redefine what the peer-review literature is!\" At that time, Jones and Kevin E. Trenberth were lead authors on a chapter in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report. Trenberth told the investigating journalist \"I had no role in this whatsoever. I did not make and was not complicit in that statement of Phil's. I am a veteran of three other IPCC assessments. I am well aware that we do not keep any papers out, and none were kept out. We assessed everything [though] we cannot possibly refer to all literature... Both of the papers referred to were in fact cited and discussed in the IPCC.\" He also made a statement agreed with Jones, that \"AR4 was the first time Jones was on the writing team of an IPCC assessment. The comment was naive and sent before he understood the process.\" Jones could have been expected to be aware of the rules as he had been a contributing author for more than ten years, but this was his first time as a lead author with a responsibility for content of the complete chapter.\n\nThe IPCC has stated that its procedures mean there is \"no possibility of exclusion of any contrarian views, if they have been published in established journals or other publications which are peer reviewed.\" Its chairman, Rajendra Pachauri, stated that the papers that had been criticised \"were actually discussed in detail in chapter six of the Working Group I report of the AR4 (IPCC Fourth Assessment Report). Furthermore, articles from the journal \"Climate Research\", which was also decried in the emails, have been cited 47 times in the Working Group I report.\"\n\nA \"Nature\" editorial stated that the UEA scientists had been sharply critical of the quality of the two papers, but \"neither they nor the IPCC suppressed anything: when the assessment report was published in 2007 it referenced and discussed both papers.\" Peter Kelemen, a professor of geochemistry at Columbia University's Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, said that \"If scientists attempted to exclude critics' peer-reviewed papers from IPCC reports, this was unethical in my view.\" Rajendra Pachauri responded that the IPCC has \"a very transparent, a very comprehensive process which ensures that even if someone wants to leave out a piece of peer reviewed literature there is virtually no possibility of that happening.\"\n\nSeveral e-mails relating to freedom of information issues were the focus of controversy. In a 2 February 2005 e-mail, Phil Jones advised Michael Mann:\n\nIn another e-mail sent in May 2008, Jones asked Mann:\n\nBefore the emails were published, Jones had already announced in Nature News (on 12 August 2009) that he was working to release the raw data in a systematic way, and was writing to all the National Meteorological Organisations requesting their agreement to waive confidentiality. On 24 November 2009, four days after the start of the email controversy, the university stated that over 95% of the CRU climate data set had already been available for several years, and the remainder would be released when permissions were given.\n\nCritics asserted that the e-mails showed that scientists were conspiring to delete e-mails and documents to prevent them from being released. George Monbiot, a supporter of the scientific consensus, wrote that Jones' resignation was warranted on the basis of his statement in this email alone, a statement Monbiot later retracted.\n\nPro-Vice Chancellor of Research at the University of East Anglia, Trevor Davies, said that no data were deleted or \"otherwise dealt with in any fashion with the intent of preventing the disclosure\". In response to allegations that CRU avoided obligations under the UK Freedom of Information Act, independent investigator Muir Russell plans to review CRU's \"policies and practices regarding requests under the Freedom of Information Act\".\n\nThe UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) oversees the application of the Freedom of Information Act 2000. The Deputy Information Commissioner, Graham Smith, issued a statement which was published on 27 January 2010 and said that the e-mails showed that an FOI request made by David Holland, a climate sceptic from Northampton, had \"not [been] dealt with as they should have been under the legislation.\" Section 77 of the FOI Act prohibited public authorities from intentionally preventing the disclosure of restricted information, but it was too late to impose sanctions as there was a six-month statutory time limit. He was advising the university of East Anglia on its legal obligations, and the ICO would be considering whether to take regulatory action once reports of the independent and police investigations were available. The university said it had not been made aware of the statement by Smith.\n\nIn its submission to the Science and Technology Select Committee, the university denied allegations that it had refused to release raw data in breach of the FOIA. It subsequently released an exchange of correspondence with the Information Commissioner's Office to clarify that, in their opinion, the University had not been found in breach of any part of the FOI Act. UEA stated that the ICO had not completed its investigations and had not established any breach of the law, and that it had not sought any further evidence on the matter. It said that the ICO statement only referred to \"prima facie\" evidence, and that Mr. Holland's request at issue concerned private e-mails. The letter from the ICO had stated that \"the \"prima facie\" evidence from the published e-mails indicate an attempt to defeat disclosure by deleting information. It is hard to imagine more cogent \"prima facie\" evidence. ... The fact that the elements of a [FOIA] section 77 offence may have been found here, but cannot be acted on because of the elapsed time, is a very serious matter.\" Evan Harris, a Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament, told \"The Times\" that it would be unwise for the university to attempt to portray the ICO's letter in a positive light, as the correspondence would be examined by the Committee. The UEA told the newspaper that the point being made in their submission was that \"there has been no investigation so no decision, as was widely reported. The ICO read e-mails and came to assumptions but has not investigated or demonstrated any evidence that what may have been said in emails was actually carried out.\" The university said that the point being made in their submission was that \"there has been no investigation so no decision, as was widely reported. The ICO read e-mails and came to assumptions but has not investigated or demonstrated any evidence that what may have been said in emails was actually carried out.\" The Science and Technology Select Committee report blamed the university for mishandling Freedom of Information requests and said it had \"found ways to support the culture at CRU of resisting disclosure of information to climate change sceptics\". The committee also criticised the ICO, and said that it made \"a statement to the press that went beyond that which it could substantiate\", but accepted that the six month statute of limitations restriction was insufficient, and said that this should be reviewed. It called for a full investigation by the Muir Russell inquiry or by the Information Commissioner, to resolve the question of whether there had been a breach of Section 77 of the FOIA.\n\nIn an e-mail of 12 November 2009, climate scientist Benjamin Santer of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory commented on an FOI request for data and correspondence from climate sceptic blogger Stephen McIntyre:\n\nIn an Associated Press interview, McIntyre disagreed with his portrayal in emails, and said \"Everything that I've done in this, I've done in good faith.\"\n\nFactCheck stated that the great majority of CRU's data is already freely available, and the scientists were reluctant to supply their own correspondence, code and data to people whose motives seemed questionable to them. It is not clear that any deliberate obstruction happened, and emails show the scientists discussing with university officials and lawyers their obligations under the new legislation, informing critics that data is already freely available, or that the information has been sent to them. This question is to form part of the East Anglia investigation.\n\nThe University of East Anglia stated that the great majority of CRU climate data was already freely available, but the remainder was mainly owned by National Meteorological Services around the globe and subject to non-publication agreements. The Met Office was requesting new agreements to allow it to republish the raw data. CRU has a web page describing the progress that had previously been made in releasing this data, and giving details of non-publication agreements including the restrictions placed by the Met office on use of its data for bona fide research programmes. In a later BBC interview, Phil Jones said that the land station records developed at CRU show close agreement with the independent NCDC and GISS official records, which are based on raw data freely available from the Global Historical Climatology Network.\n\nIn response to the Met Office requests, some National Meteorological Services gave full or conditional agreement, others failed to respond, and the request was explicitly refused by Trinidad and Tobago and Poland. In discussions with the ICO about FOIA requests which had been made before the email controversy had begun, the university argued that the data was publicly available from the Met organisations, and the lack of agreement exempted the remaining data. In its decision released on 23 June 2011, the ICO stated that the data was not easily available and there was insufficient evidence that disclosure would have an adverse effect on international relations. The ICO required the university to release the data covered by the FOIA request within 35 calendar days. On 27 July 2011 CRU announced release of the raw instrumental data not already in the public domain, with the exception of Poland which was outside the area covered by the FOIA request. The data are available for download from Met Office website and from CRU. The university remained concerned \"that the forced release of material from a source which has explicitly refused to give permission for release could have some damaging consequences for the UK in international research collaborations.\"\n\nCritics also highlighted a passage in an e-mail sent by Kevin Trenberth on 12 October 2009 that discussed gaps in scientific understanding of recent temperature variations, in which Trenberth wrote:\n\nTrenberth told the Associated Press that the email referred to an article he authored calling for improvement in measuring global warming to describe unusual data, such as rising sea surface temperatures. The word \"travesty\" refers to what Trenberth sees as an inadequate observing system that, were it more adequate, would be able to track the warming he believes is there.\n\nIn a statement on his NCAR webpage Trenberth states that,\n\nThe CRU files also included programs written in Fortran, programmer comments and a readme file, which attracted considerable attention from programmers. The log covered more than four years work by a programmer, who had been frustrated by problems in relating climate data from numerous international sources. In a BBC Newsnight report, software engineer John Graham-Cumming said the code was \"below the standard you'd expect in any commercial software\" because it lacked clear documentation or an audit history. Graham-Cumming also reported finding a bug in the code's error handling which, if it occurred, would ignore data without warning.\n\nMyles Allen, head of the Climate Dynamics group at the University of Oxford, said that the code investigated by Newsnight had nothing at all to do with the HadCRUT temperature record used for climate reconstructions, which is maintained at the Met Office and not at CRU. When he challenged Newsnight on this, they responded that \"Our expert's opinion is that this is climate change code\" and declined to retract the story. He commented that on the same basis \"the quality of the code I use to put together problems for our physics undergraduates shows that we should not trust results from my colleagues who work on the Large Hadron Collider on the grounds that \"it is all physics code\".\"\n\nThe United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) investigation established that the programming notes recorded the process of updating the CRU TS2.1 dataset product to TS3.0. This product includes multiple climate variables, including temperatures, rainfall and cloud cover, and has nothing to do with the HadCRUT temperature record which uses the separate CRUTEM land temperature dataset. The CRU programmer had the difficult task of merging datasets at the same time as migrating code to a new computer system, finding ways of dealing with inconsistencies in data from disparate organisations, improving quality control and debugging.\n\n\n"}

The theory became important in the seventeenth century; amongst the leading corpuscularians were Thomas Hobbes, René Descartes, Pierre Gassendi, Robert Boyle, Isaac Newton, and John Locke.\n\nCorpuscularianism is similar to the theory of atomism, except that where atoms were supposed to be indivisible, corpuscles could in principle be divided. In this manner, for example, it was theorized that mercury could penetrate into metals and modify their inner structure, a step on the way towards the production of gold by transmutation. Corpuscularianism was associated by its leading proponents with the idea that some of the properties that objects appear to have are artifacts of the perceiving mind: \"secondary\" qualities as distinguished from \"primary\" qualities. Corpuscularianism stayed a dominant theory for centuries and was blended with alchemy by early scientists such as Robert Boyle and Isaac Newton in the 17th century.\n\nIn his work \"The Sceptical Chymist\" (1661), Boyle abandoned the Aristotelian ideas of the classical elements—earth, water, air, and fire in favor of corpuscularianism. In his later work, \"The Origin of Forms and Qualities\" (1666), Boyle used corpuscularianism to explain all of the major Aristotelian concepts, marking a departure from traditional Aristotelianism.\n\nThe philosopher Thomas Hobbes used corpuscularianism to justify his political theories in \"Leviathan\". It was used by Newton in his development of the corpuscular theory of light, while Boyle used it to develop his mechanical corpuscular philosophy, which laid the foundations for the Chemical Revolution.\n\nWilliam R. Newman traces the origins from the fourth book of Aristotle, \"Meteorology\". The \"dry\" and \"moist\" exhalations of Aristotle became the alchemical 'sulfur' and 'mercury' of the eighth-century Islamic alchemist, Jābir ibn Hayyān (721–815). Pseudo-Geber's \"Summa perfectionis\" contains an alchemical theory where unified sulfur and mercury corpuscles, differing in purity, size, and relative proportions, form the basis of a much more complicated process.\n\nSeveral of the principles which corpuscularianism proposed became tenets of modern chemistry.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "17343132", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17343132", "title": "Fernando González (writer)", "text": "Fernando González (writer)\n\nFernando González Ochoa (April 24, 1895 – February 16, 1964), was a Colombian writer and existentialist philosopher known as \"\"el filósofo de Otraparte\" (\"The Philosopher from somewhere else\"). He wrote about sociology, history, art, morality, economics, epistemology and theology in a magisterial and creative way, using different genres of literature. González is considered one of the most original writers of Colombia during the 20th century. His ideas were controversial and had a great influence in the Colombian society at his time and today. The González work was the inspiration of Nadaism, a literary movement founded by one of his disciples, Gonzalo Arango. The \"Otraparte\" Villa, his house in Envigado, is today a museum and the headquarters of the cultural foundation to preserve and promote his legacy. The place was declared a National Patrimony of Colombia in 2006.\n\nGonzález lived during the beginning of the 20th century (1895–1964), a time of change, political turbulence and revolutions in industry. He was born seven years after the new political agreement of a more conservative constitution (1888) that gave great influence to the Catholic Church in Colombian society, especially in the education of future generations. Four years after, when he was 4 years old, the nation fell in a bloody civil war, the 1899 - 1902 Thousand Days War. The other important event that happened during his life was in 1903 when Colombia lost Panama. In 1926 the Banana massacre gave evidence of the labor problems of the different growing Colombian industries. He lived also in one of the first industrialist trade centers of the country, the Metropolitan Area of Medellín and the first to start an industrial revolution in Colombia during the 1930s. González was also a witness of the emerging of Fascism in Italy when he was consul of Colombia in that country. In 1948 the killing of the presidential candidate Jorge Eliecer Gaitán opened the doors of a new political instability with El Bogotazo. All these events are reflected in the works and thoughts of Fernando González Ochoa.\n\nFernando González Ochoa was born in Envigado, a city in the Aburrá Valley (Antioquia State). He was the second of seven children. His parents were Daniel González and Pastora Ochoa. His father was a school teacher, the inspiration of one of his books (\"El Maestro de Escuela\"). He was expelled from the school of the Presentation Sisters of Envigado because he insulted a sister after being punished.\n\nSomething similar would happen soon after he joined the Jesuit College of Medellín, but this time because he was caught reading Nietzsche. The young González faced his teacher of philosophy, Rev. Quiroz, saying that nothing can be and can not be at the same time. He was a sophomore in high school when the Jesuits asked him to leave the school.\n\nIn 1915 he became a member of Los Panidas, a group of sceptics, with León de Greiff, Ricardo Rendón, Félix Mejía Arango, Libardo Parra Toro, José Manuel Mora Vásquez and Eduardo Vasco, among other young intellectuals. In 1916 González published his first book, \"Pensamientos de un viejo\" (Thoughts of an Oldman), which presentation was written by Fidel Cano, the founder of El Espectador newspaper. In 1919 González got his diploma in law by University of Antioquia, however his thesis, \"El derecho a no obedecer\"\" (The Right Not To Obey) was not welcome by the Academic Council of the University. González had to do some modifications to the text and published it under the title of \"Una tesis\" (A Thesis).\n\nIn 1921 he became Judge of the Superior Tribunal of Manizales. In 1922 he married in Medellín Margarita Restrepo Gaviria, the daughter of former president Carlos E. Restrepo. In 1928 he is nominated Second Judge of the Medellín Tribunals where he knew Benjamín Correa who was to be one of his best friends. With Correa he visited several towns in the states of Antioquia, Caldas and Valle del Cauca. From those visits he got the inspiration to one of his most popular books, \"Viaje a pie\" (Journey on Foot), published in 1929, but forbidden by the Archbishop of Medellín under the penalty of mortal sin.\n\nGonzález went to Venezuela in 1931 to meet dictator Juan Vicente Gómez. He considered Gómez a sprout of Libertador Simón Bolívar and they became friends. The dictator was the godfather of one of the sons of González and this one dedicated a work to him, \"Mi compadre\".\n\nGonzález was nominated by President Enrique Olaya Herrera a consul of Colombia in Genoa, Italy in 1932. He went with his family to the European country and that same year \"Le Libre Libre\", a publishing house of Paris, published his book \"Don Mirocletes\". About that work Manuel Ugarte wrote a letter to him from Nice saying:\n\nFrom Spain he received two letters of José Vasconcelos on December 14 and 30, 1932. Vasconcelos wrote:\n\nHe received other letter of the Colombian writer José María Vargas Vila, who was exiled in Madrid. Vargas wrote to him:\n\nIn 1933 the Italian police found a book notes with critics to the regimen of Benito Mussolini and the Fascism. He was transferred to Marsella due to a petition of the Italian government. That book notes were the origin of his work \"El hermafrodita dormido\" (The Asleep Hermaphrodite), a book with his experiences in the classic art museums of Italy. The book was published in Spain in 1934.\n\nIn 1934 González returned to Colombia establishing in his town, Envigado, to live in a finca he called \"Bucarest Villa\". There he started to publish the \"Antioquia Magazine\" until 1945. In 1935 the \"Arturo Zapata\" Printing Press of Manizales published his \"El Remordimiento\" (The Remorse), an essay in theology written in Marsella (France) and \"Letters to Estanislao Zuleta\".\n\nThe former president of Ecuador, José María Velasco Ibarra, who was exiled in Colombia, visited González in Bucarest Villa in 1936 and they became very good friends. To Velasco he dedicated some chapters of \"Los negroides\" (The Negroid People) where González called Velasco the first \"Politician-Thinker\" of the Americas. By his part, Velasco called González in his work \"Conciencia o Barbarie: Exégesis de la Conciencia Política Americana\" (Conscience or Barbarism: Exegesis of the American Political Conscience), published first by the \"Atlántida\" Printing Press of Medellín, \"the most original and deep of the South American sociologists\".\n\nIn that year died in Madrid the Venezuelan novelist Teresa de la Parra with whom González had a good friendship since 1930 when she visited him in Envigado. It was also the year of \"Los negroides\" publication, an essay on New Granada (Colombia, Venezuela and Ecuador), saying that it is the only American region where the merger of races will create an original culture for a man unified. Such merger is a principle of promises and appalling realities at the same time.\n\nHe started in 1940 the construction of his villa in Envigado that at that time he called \"La Huerta del Alemán\" (The Garden of the German), but the World War II would make him to change the name for \"Otraparte\" (Other Place). The villa was designed with architect Carlos Obregón, engineer Félix Mejía Arango and painter Pedro Nel Gómez. That year he published \"Santander\", an essay about General Francisco de Paula Santander. The writer Tomás Carrasquilla, his friend and the most admired by him Colombian novelist, died.\n\nIn \"Otraparte\" he received the American playwright Thornton Wilder to whom he dedicated his work \"El maestro de escuela\" (The School Teacher). Wilder was in Colombia as a cultural ambassador of his country in South America and wrote about the \"Garden of the German\": \"It is more delightful than all Chapinero\".\n\nOn April 9, 1949, Colombia shuddered with the killing of presidential candidate Jorge Eliecer Gaitán in Bogotá. González dedicated to him some thoughts in 1936 in \"Los negroides\":\n\nIn June 1949 of that year, after El Bogotazo, González wrote in the edition of his \"Antioquia Magazine\":\n\nIn 1953 he was nominated consul of Colombia in Europe, but he stayed most of the time in Bilbao where he studied Simon Bolívar and Ignatius of Loyola. His friend Thornton Wilder and Jean-Paul Sartre asked to include his name in the list of candidates to the Nobel Prize in Literature of 1955 and for two times he was in nominated. The writers Gabriela Mistral, Jacinto Benavente and Miguel de Unamuno admired his work.\n\nIn September 1957 González returned to Colombia, to his \"Otraparte\" villa, until his death in 1964. In 2006 President Álvaro Uribe approved Law 1068 to exalt the memory, life and work of the Antioquean philosopher Fernando González and declared \"Otraparte\" Home Museum in Envigado as a national patrimony.\n\nFernando González is called the \"Philosopher of Authenticity\" and his thought is related to the experience of his life as a man. He used to say that we must live in the simple but bringing awareness of the essentials.\n\nHe thought about the Colombian man and, thus, the Latin American, their personality, fights and expressions. He called himself the \"Philosopher of the Personality of South America\". He wrote that the Latin American man might develop the individuality to arise from their anonymity. He criticized what he called the \"Latin American vanity\" that was without substance and invited to express the personality with energy, giving to life the highest value.\n\nGonzález thought his time as the decadence of the principle of freedom and individualism for an action of flocks following calves to worship (Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini). He missed the man of the ancient Egypt, Greece and the Renaissance man.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "324262", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=324262", "title": "Fideism", "text": "Fideism\n\nFideism () is an epistemological theory which maintains that faith is independent of reason, or that reason and faith are hostile to each other and faith is superior at arriving at particular truths (see natural theology). The word \"fideism\" comes from \"fides\", the Latin word for faith, and literally means \"faith-ism\".\n\nTheologians and philosophers have responded in various ways to the place of faith and reason in determining the truth of metaphysical ideas, morality, and religious beliefs. A fideist is one who argues for fideism. Historically, fideism is most commonly ascribed to four philosophers: Pascal, Kierkegaard, William James, and Wittgenstein; with fideism being a label applied in a negative sense by their opponents, but which is not always supported by their own ideas and works or followers. There are a number of different forms of fideism.\n\nAlvin Plantinga defines \"fideism\" as \"the exclusive or basic reliance upon faith alone, accompanied by a consequent disparagement of reason and utilized especially in the pursuit of philosophical or religious truth\". The fideist therefore \"urges reliance on faith rather than reason, in matters philosophical and religious\", and therefore may go on to disparage the claims of reason. The fideist seeks truth, above all: and affirms that reason cannot achieve certain kinds of truth, which must instead be accepted only by faith. Plantinga's definition might be revised to say that what the fideist objects to is not so much \"reason\" per se—it seems excessive to call Blaise Pascal anti-rational—but \"evidentialism\": the notion that no belief should be held unless it is supported by evidence.\n\nThe doctrine of fideism is consistent with some, and radically contrary to other theories of truth:\n\nSome forms of fideism outright reject the correspondence theory of truth, which has major philosophical implications. Some only claim a few religious details to be axiomatic.\n\nTertullian's \"De Carne Christi\" (On the Flesh of Christ]) says \"the Son of God died; it is by all means to be believed, because it is absurd.\" The statement \"Credo quia absurdum\" (\"I believe because it is absurd\") is sometimes cited as an example of views of the Church Fathers, but this appears to be a misquotation of Tertullian.\n\nTertullian's statement, however, is not a fideist position; Tertullian was critiquing intellectual arrogance and the misuse of philosophy, but he remained committed to reason and its usefulness in defending the faith.\n\nMartin Luther taught that faith informs the Christian's use of reason. Regarding the mysteries of Christian faith, he wrote, \"All the articles of our Christian faith, which God has revealed to us in His Word, are in presence of reason sheerly impossible, absurd, and false.\" And \"Reason is the greatest enemy that faith has.\" However, Luther conceded that, grounded upon faith in Christ, reason can be used in its proper realm, as he wrote, \"Before faith and the knowledge of God reason is darkness in divine matters, but through faith it is turned into a light in the believer and serves piety as an excellent instrument. For just as all natural endowments serve to further impiety in the godless, so they serve to further salvation in the godly. An eloquent tongue promotes faith; reason makes speech clear, and everything helps faith forward. Reason receives life from faith; it is killed by it and brought back to life.\"\n\nAnother form of fideism is assumed by Pascal's Wager. Blaise Pascal invites the atheist considering faith to see faith in God as a cost-free choice that carries a potential reward. He does not attempt to argue that God indeed exists, only that it might be valuable to assume that it is true. Of course, the problem with Pascal's Wager is that it does not restrict itself to a specific God, although Pascal did have in mind the Christian God as is mentioned in the following quote. In his \"Pensées\", Pascal writes:\nPascal moreover contests the various proposed proofs of the existence of God as irrelevant. Even if the proofs were valid, the beings they propose to demonstrate are not congruent with the deity worshiped by historical faiths, and can easily lead to deism instead of revealed religion: \"The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob—not the god of the philosophers!\"\n\nConsidered to be the father of modern antirationalism, Johann Georg Hamann promoted a view that elevated faith alone as the only guide to human conduct. Using the work of David Hume he argued that everything people do is ultimately based on faith. Without faith (for it can never be proven) in the existence of an external world, human affairs could not continue; therefore, he argued, all reasoning comes from this faith: it is fundamental to the human condition. Thus all attempts to base belief in God using reason are in vain. He attacks systems like Spinozism that try to confine what he feels is the infinite majesty of God into a finite human creation.\n\nNatural theologians may argue that Kierkegaard was a fideist of this general sort: the argument that God's existence cannot be certainly known, and that the decision to accept faith is neither founded on, nor needs, rational justification, may be found in the writings of Søren Kierkegaard and his followers in Christian existentialism. Many of Kierkegaard's works, including \"Fear and Trembling\", are under pseudonyms; they may represent the work of fictional authors whose views correspond to hypothetical positions, not necessarily those held by Kierkegaard himself.\n\nIn \"Fear and Trembling\", Kierkegaard focused on Abraham's willingness to sacrifice Isaac. The New Testament apostles repeatedly argued that Abraham's act was an admirable display of faith. To the eyes of a non-believer, however, it must necessarily have appeared to be an unjustifiable attempted murder, perhaps the fruit of an insane delusion. Kierkegaard used this example to focus attention on the problem of faith in general. He ultimately affirmed that to believe in the incarnation of Christ, in God made flesh, was to believe in the \"absolute paradox\", since it implies that an eternal, perfect being would become a simple human. Reason cannot possibly comprehend such a phenomenon; therefore, one can only believe in it by taking a \"leap of faith\".\n\nAmerican pragmatic philosopher and psychologist William James introduced his concept of the \"will to believe\" in 1896. Following upon his earlier theories of truth, James argued that some religious questions can only be answered by believing in the first place: one cannot know if religious doctrines are true without seeing if they work, but they cannot be said to work unless one believes them in the first place.\n\nWilliam James published many works on the subject of religious experience. His four key characteristics of religious experience are: 'passivity', 'ineffability', 'a noetic quality', and 'transiency'. Due to the fact that religious experience is fundamentally ineffable, it is impossible to hold a coherent discussion of it using public language. This means that religious belief cannot be discussed effectively, and so reason does not affect faith. Instead, faith is found through experience of the spiritual, and so understanding of belief is only gained through the practice of it.\n\nThe philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein did not write systematically about religion, though he did lecture on the topic. Some of his students' notes have been collected and published. On the other hand, it has been asserted that religion as a \"form of life\" is something that intrigued Wittgenstein to a great degree. In his 1967 article, entitled \"Wittgensteinian Fideism\", Kai Nielsen argues that certain aspects of Wittgenstein's thought have been interpreted by Wittgensteinians in a \"fideistic\" manner. According to this position, religion is a self-contained—and primarily expressive—enterprise, governed by its own internal logic or \"grammar\". This view—commonly called Wittgensteinian fideism—states: (1) that religion is logically cut off from other aspects of life; (2) that religious concepts and discourse are essentially self-referential; and (3) that religion cannot be criticized from an external (i.e., non-religious) point of view. Although there are other aspects that are often associated with the phenomena of Wittgensteinian fideism, Kai Nielsen has argued that such interpretations are implausible misrepresentations of the position. It is worth noting, however, that no self-proclaimed Wittgensteinian actually takes Nielsen's analysis to be at all representative of either Wittgenstein's view, or their own. This is especially true of the best-known Wittgensteinian philosopher of religion, D. Z. Phillips, who is also the best-known \"Wittgensteinan fideist\". In their book \"Wittgensteinian Fideism?\" (SCM Press, 2005), D. Z. Phillips and Kai Nielsen debate the status of Wittgensteinian fideism. Both agree that the position \"collapses\", though they think it fails for different reasons. For Nielsen, the position is socially and politically irresponsible since it ignores prudential, practical, and pragmatic considerations as a basis for criticizing different language games. For Phillips, the position fails because it is not Wittgensteinian, and thus is a caricature of his position. Amongst other charges, Nielsen argues most forcefully in an article entitled \"On Obstacles of the Will\" that Phillips' Wittgensteinian view is relevantly fideistic and that it, therefore, fails on the grounds that it cannot account for the possibility of external, cultural criticism. Phillips, in turn, in the last article in the book, entitled \"Wittgenstein: Contemplation and Cultural Criticism\", argues that the position is not Wittgensteinian at all, and that Wittgenstein's considered view not only allows for the possibility of external, cultural criticism, but also \"advances\" philosophical discussion concerning it.\n\nPresuppositional apologetics is a Christian system of apologetics associated mainly with Calvinist Protestantism; it attempts to distinguish itself from fideism. It holds that all human thought must begin with the proposition that the revelation contained in the Bible is axiomatic, rather than transcendentally necessary, else one would not be able to make sense of any human experience (see also epistemic foundationalism). To a non-believer who rejects the notion that the truth about God, the world, and themselves can be found within the Bible, the presuppositional apologist attempts to demonstrate the incoherence of the epistemic foundations of the logical alternative by the use of what has come to be known as the \"Transcendental Argument for God's existence\" (TAG). On the other hand, some presuppositional apologists, such as Cornelius Van Til, believe that such a condition of true unbelief is impossible, claiming that all people actually believe in God (even if only on a subconscious level), whether they admit or deny it.\n\nPresuppositional apologetics could be seen as being more closely allied with foundationalism than fideism, though it has sometimes been critical of both.\n\nCatholic doctrine rejects fideism. The \"Catechism of the Catholic Church\", representing Catholicism's great regard for Thomism, the teachings of St. Thomas Aquinas, affirms that it is a Catholic doctrine that God's existence can indeed be demonstrated by reason. Aquinas' position, which is to be distinguished from rationalism, has deep roots in Western Christianity; it goes back to St. Anselm of Canterbury's observation that the role of reason was to explain faith more fully: \"fides quaerens intellectum\", \"faith seeking understanding\", is his formula.\n\nThe official position of the Catholic Church is that while the existence of the one God can in fact be demonstrated by reason, nevertheless on account of the distortion of human nature caused by the first sin, humans can be deluded to deny the claims of reason that demonstrate God's existence. The Anti-Modernist oath promulgated by Pope Pius X required Catholics to affirm that:\nSimilarly, the \"Catechism of the Catholic Church\" teaches that:\nPope John Paul II's encyclical \"Fides et Ratio\" also affirms that God's existence is in fact demonstrable by reason, and that attempts to reason otherwise are the results of sin. In the encyclical, John Paul II warned against \"a resurgence of fideism, which fails to recognize the importance of rational knowledge and philosophical discourse for the understanding of faith, indeed for the very possibility of belief in God\".\n\nHistorically, there have been a number of fideist strains within the Catholic orbit. Catholic traditionalism, exemplified in the nineteenth century by Joseph de Maistre, emphasized faith in tradition as the means of divine revelation. The claims of reason are multiple, and various people have argued rationally for several contradictory things: in this environment, the safest course is to hold true to the faith that has been preserved through tradition, and to resolve to accept what the Church has historically taught. In his essay \"Du pape\" (\"On the Pope\"), de Maistre argued that it was historically inevitable that all of the Protestant churches would eventually seek reunification and refuge in the Catholic Church: science was the greater threat, it threatened all religious faith, and \"no religion can resist science, except one\".\n\nAnother refuge of fideist thinking within the Catholic Church is the concept of \"signs of contradiction\". According to this belief, the holiness of certain people and institutions is confirmed by the fact that other people contest their claims: this opposition is held to be worthy of comparison to the opposition met by Jesus Christ himself. This opposition and contradiction does not inherently prove something is true in Catholic thought, but only acts an additional possible indication of its truth. The idea of the sign of contradiction is related to the conviction that, while human reason is still operative, the distortion of fallen human nature causes concrete instances of reasoning to grope and often to go astray.\n\nFideism has received criticism from theologians who argue that fideism is not a proper way to worship God. According to this position, if one does not attempt to understand what one believes, one is not really believing. \"Blind faith\" is not true faith. Notable articulations of this position include:\n\nFideism can lead to relativism. The existence of other religions puts a fundamental question to fideists—if faith is the only way to know the truth of God, how are we to know which God to have faith in? Fideism alone is not considered an adequate guide to distinguish true or morally valuable revelations from false ones. An apparent consequence of fideism is that all religious thinking becomes equal. The major monotheistic religions become on par with obscure fringe religions, as neither can be advocated or disputed.\n\nThese critics note that people successfully use reason in their daily lives to solve problems and that reason has led to progressive increase of knowledge in the sphere of science. This gives credibility to reason and argumentative thinking as a proper method for seeking truth. Galileo Galilei, for example, said that \"I do not feel obliged to believe that the same God who has endowed us with sense, reason and intellect has intended us to forgo their use.\"\n\nOn the other hand, according to these critics, there is no evidence that a religious faith that rejects reason would also serve us while seeking truth.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2226118", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2226118", "title": "Free and open-source graphics device driver", "text": "Free and open-source graphics device driver\n\nA free and open-source graphics device driver is a software stack which controls computer-graphics hardware and supports graphics-rendering application programming interfaces (APIs) and is released under a free and open-source software license. Graphics device drivers are written for specific hardware to work within a specific operating system kernel and to support a range of APIs used by applications to access the graphics hardware. They may also control output to the display if the display driver is part of the graphics hardware. Most free and open-source graphics device drivers are developed by the Mesa project. The driver is made up of a compiler, a rendering API, and software which manages access to the graphics hardware.\n\nDrivers without freely (and legally) -available source code are commonly known as \"binary drivers\". Binary drivers used in the context of operating systems that are prone to ongoing development and change (such as Linux) create problems for end users and package maintainers. These problems, which affect system stability, security and performance, are the main reason for the independent development of free and open-source drivers. When no technical documentation is available, an understanding of the underlying hardware is often gained by clean-room reverse engineering. Based on this understanding, device drivers may be written and legally published under any software license.\n\nIn rare cases, a manufacturer's driver source code is available on the Internet without a free license. This means that the code can be studied and altered for personal use, but the altered (and usually the original) source code cannot be freely distributed. Solutions to bugs in the driver cannot be shared, significantly reducing the utility of such drivers in comparison to free and open-source drivers.\n\nThere are objections to binary-only drivers based on copyright, security, reliability and development concerns. As part of a wider campaign against binary blobs, OpenBSD lead developer Theo de Raadt said that with a binary driver there is \"no way to fix it when it breaks (and it will break)\"; when a product which relies on binary drivers is declared to be end-of-life by the manufacturer, it is effectively \"broken forever.\" The project has also stated that binary drivers \"hide bugs and workarounds for bugs\", an observation which has been somewhat vindicated by flaws found in binary drivers (including an exploitable bug in Nvidia's 3D drivers discovered in October 2006 by Rapid7). It is speculated that the bug has existed since 2004; Nvidia have denied this, asserting that the issue was only communicated to them in July 2006 and the 2004 bug was a bug in X.Org (not in Nvidia's driver).\n\nBinary drivers often do not work with current versions of open-source software, and almost never support development snapshots of open-source software; it is usually not directly possible for a developer to use Nvidia's or ATI's proprietary drivers with a development snapshot of an X server or a development snapshot of the Linux kernel. Features like kernel mode-setting cannot be added to binary drivers by anyone but the vendors, which prevents their inclusion if the vendor lacks capacity or interest.\n\nIn the Linux kernel development community, Linus Torvalds has made strong statements on the issue of binary-only modules: \"I \"refuse\" to even consider tying my hands over some binary-only module ... I want people to know that when they use binary-only modules, it's \"their\" problem\". Another kernel developer, Greg Kroah-Hartman, has said that a binary-only kernel module does not comply with the kernel's license (the GNU General Public License); it \"just violates the GPL due to fun things like derivative works and linking and other stuff.\" Writer and computer scientist Peter Gutmann has expressed concern that the digital rights management scheme in Microsoft's Windows Vista operating system may limit the availability of the documentation required to write open drivers, since it \"requires that the operational details of the device be kept confidential.\"\n\nIn the case of binary drivers, there are objections due to free software philosophy, software quality and security concerns. There are also concerns that the redistribution of closed-source Linux kernel modules may be illegal. The Linux kernel has never maintained a stable in-kernel application binary interface. There are also concerns that proprietary drivers may contain backdoors, like the one found in Samsung Galaxy-series modem drivers.\n\nWhen applications such as a 3D game engine or a 3D computer graphics software shunt calculations from the CPU to the GPU, they usually use a special-purpose API like OpenGL or Direct3D and do not address the hardware directly. Because all translation (from API calls to GPU opcodes) is done by the device driver, it contains specialized knowledge and is an object of optimization. This takes time and money. Leakage of device-driver source code (whether published under a free license or not) can give competitors an advantage — especially newcomers to graphic acceleration, who would gain considerable knowledge without bearing the costs of developing the knowledge.\n\nThe desktop computer market was long dominated by PC hardware using the x86/x86-64 instruction set and GPUs available for the PC. With three major competitors (Nvidia, AMD and Intel). The main competing factor was the price of hardware and raw performance in 3D computer games, which is greatly affected by the efficient translation of API calls into GPU opcodes. The display driver and the video decoder are inherent parts of the graphics card: hardware designed to assist in the calculations necessary for the decoding of video streams. As the market for PC hardware has dwindled, it seems unlikely that new competitors will enter this market and it is unclear how much more knowledge one company could gain by seeing the source code of other companies' drivers.\n\nThe mobile sector presents a different situation. The functional blocks (the application-specific integrated circuit display driver, 2- and 3D acceleration and video decoding and encoding) are separate semiconductor intellectual property (SIP) blocks on the chip, since hardware devices vary substantially; some portable media players require a display driver that accelerates video decoding, but do not require 3D acceleration. The development goal is not only raw 3D performance, but system integration, power consumption and 2D capabilities. There is also an approach which abandons the traditional method (Vsync) of updating the display and makes better use of sample and hold technology to lower power consumption.\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2013 79.3 percent of smartphones sold worldwide were running a version of Android, and the Linux kernel dominates smartphones. Hardware developers have an incentive to deliver Linux drivers for their hardware but, due to competition, no incentive to make these drivers free and open-source. Additional problems are the Android-specific augmentations to the Linux kernel which have not been accepted in mainline, such as the Atomic Display Framework (ADF). ADF is a feature of 3.10 AOSP kernels which provides a dma-buf-centric framework between Android's hwcomposer HAL and the kernel driver. ADF significantly overlaps with the DRM-KMS framework. ADF has not been accepted into mainline, but a different set of solutions addressing the same problems (known as atomic mode setting) is under development. Projects such as libhybris harness Android device drivers to run on Linux platforms other than Android.\n\nDevice drivers are the abstraction layer between software concepts and hardware circuitry. They are a standard interface to peripherals, hiding the details of how the circuitry solves things from the programmer. Almost any system operation eventually maps to a physical device. The kernel embeds device drivers for every peripheral in the computer system.\n\nPhoronix, which compares free drivers, is a source for real-world testing:\n\nIt is uncommon for video-game magazines to report benchmark testing on Linux. Benchmarks on Phoronix are limited in scope, primarily testing games which are available on Linux and support automated benchmarking.\n\nFree and open-source drivers are primarily developed on and for Linux by Linux kernel developers, third-party programming enthusiasts and employees of companies such as Advanced Micro Devices. Each driver has five parts:\n\nThe DRM is kernel-specific. A VESA driver is generally available for any operating system. The VESA driver supports most graphics cards without acceleration and at display resolutions limited to a set programmed in the video BIOS by the manufacturer.\n\nThe Linux graphics stack has evolved, detoured by the X Window System core protocol.\nAMD's proprietary driver, AMD Catalyst for their Radeon, is available for Microsoft Windows and Linux (formerly fglrx). A current version can be downloaded from AMD's site, and some Linux distributions contain it in their repositories. It is in the process of being replaced with an AMDGPU-PRO hybrid driver combining the open-source kernel, X and Mesa multimedia drivers with closed-source OpenGL, OpenCL and Vulkan drivers derived from Catalyst.\n\nThe FOSS drivers for ATI-AMD GPUs are being developed under the name Radeon (xf86-video-ati or xserver-xorg-video-radeon). They still must load proprietary microcode into the GPU to enable hardware acceleration.\n\nRadeon 3D code is split into six drivers, according to GPU technology: the radeon, r200 and r300 classic drivers and r300g, r600g and radeonsi Gallium3D drivers:\n\nAn up-to-date feature matrix is available, and there is support for Video Coding Engine and Unified Video Decoder. The free and open-source Radeon graphics device drivers are not reverse-engineered, but are based on documentation released by AMD without the requirement to sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA). Documentation began to be gradually released in 2007. This is in contrast to AMD's main competitor in the graphics field, Nvidia, which has a proprietary driver similar to AMD Catalyst but provides no support to free-graphics initiatives.\n\nIn addition to providing the necessary documentation, AMD employees contribute code to support their hardware and features. At the 2014 Game Developers Conference, The company announced that they were exploring a strategy change to re-base the user-space part of Catalyst on a free and open-source DRM kernel module instead of their proprietary kernel blob.\n\nAll components of the Radeon graphics device driver are developed by core contributors and interested parties worldwide. In 2011, the r300g outperformed Catalyst in some cases.\n\nThe release of the amdgpu stack was announced on the dri-devel mailing list in April 2015. Although the driver is developed on GCN 1.1 graphics cards, it is enabled only for GCN 1.2 graphics cards; GCN 1.0 and 1.1 graphics cards are supported by the Radeon driver. Regarding the naming of the involved microarchitectures consult Graphics Core Next. A separate libdrm, libdrm-amdgpu, has been included since libdrm 2.4.63.\n\nNvidia's proprietary driver, Nvidia GeForce driver for GeForce, is available for Windows XP x86-x86-64 and later, Linux x86-x86-64-ARMv7-A, OS X 10.5 and later, Solaris x86-x86-64 and FreeBSD x86/x86-64. A current version can be downloaded from the Internet, and some Linux distributions contain it in their repositories. The beta Nvidia GeForce driver 331.13 supports the EGL interface, enabling support for Wayland in conjunction with this driver.\n\nNvidia's free and open-source driver is named nv. It is limited (supporting only 2D acceleration), and Matthew Garrett, Dirk Hohndel and others have called its source code confusing. Nvidia decided to deprecate nv, not adding support for Fermi or later GPUs and DisplayPort, in March 2010.\n\nIn December 2009, Nvidia announced they would not support free graphics initiatives. On The company announced that they would release some documentation of their GPUs.\n\nNouveau is based almost entirely on information gained through reverse engineering. This project aims to produce 3D acceleration for X.Org/Wayland using Gallium3D. On March 26, 2012, Nouveau's DRM component was marked stable and promoted from the staging area of the Linux kernel. Nouveau supports Tesla- (and earlier), Fermi-, Kepler- and Maxwell-based GPUs. On , Nvidia employee Alexandre Courbot committed an extensive patch set which adds initial support for the GK20A (Tegra K1) to Nouveau. In June 2014, Codethink reportedly ran a Wayland-based Weston compositor with Linux kernel 3.15, using EGL and a \"100% open-source graphics driver stack\" on a Tegra K1. A feature matrix is available. In July 2014, Nouveau was unable to outperform the Nvidia GeForce driver due to missing re-clocking support. Tegra-re is a project which is working to reverse-engineer nVidia's VLIW-based Tegra series of GPUs that predate Tegra K1.\n\nNvidia distributes proprietary device drivers for Tegra through OEMs and as part of its Linux for Tegra (formerly L4T) development kit. Nvidia and a partner, Avionic Design, were working on submitting Grate (free and open-source drivers for Tegra) upstream of the mainline Linux kernel in April 2012.\nThe company's co-founder and CEO laid out the Tegra processor roadmap with Ubuntu Unity at the 2013 GPU Technology Conference.\n\nNvidia's Unified Memory driver (nvidia-uvm.ko), which implements memory management for Pascal and Volta GPUs on Linux, is MIT licensed. The source code is available in the Nvidia Linux driver downloads on systems that support nvidia-uvm.ko.\n\nIntel has a history of producing (or commissioning) open-source drivers for its graphics chips, with the exception of their PowerVR-based chips. Their 2D X.Org driver is called xf86-video-intel. The kernel mode-setting driver in the Linux kernel does not use the video BIOS for switching video modes; since some BIOSes have a limited range of modes, this provides more reliable access to those supported by Intel video cards.\n\nUnlike the Radeon and Nouveau drivers, Intel does not intend to utilize the Gallium3D framework for its graphics drivers. The company worked on optimizing their free Linux drivers for performance approaching their Windows counterparts, especially on Sandy Bridge and newer hardware (where performance optimizations have allowed the Intel driver to outperform their proprietary Windows drivers in certain tasks, in 2011. Some of the performance enhancements may also benefit users of older hardware.\n\nSupport for Intel's LLC (Last Level Cache, L4-Cache, Crystalwell and Iris Pro) was added in Linux kernel 3.12, and the company has 20 to 30 full-time Linux graphics developers.\n\nMatrox develops and manufactures the Matrox Mystique, Parhelia, G200, G400 and G550. Although the company provides free and open-source drivers for their chipsets which are older than the G550; chipsets newer than the G550 are supported by a closed-source driver.\n\nS3 Graphics develops the S3 Trio, ViRGE, Savage and Chrome, supported by OpenChrome.\n\nArm Holdings is a fabless semiconductor company which licenses semiconductor intellectual property cores. Although they are known for the licensing the ARM instruction set and CPUs based on it, they also develop and license the Mali series of GPUs. On January 21, 2012, Phoronix reported that Luc Verhaegen was driving a reverse-engineering attempt aimed at the Arm Holdings Mali series of GPUs (specifically, the Mali-200 and Mali-400 versions). The reverse-engineering project, known as Lima, was presented at FOSDEM on February 4, 2012. On February 2, 2013, Verhaegen demonstrated Quake III Arena in timedemo mode, running on top of the Lima driver. In May 2018, a Lima developer posted the driver for inclusion in the Linux kernel.\n\nARM has indicated no intention of providing support for their graphics acceleration hardware licensed under a free and open-source license. However, ARM employees sent patches for the Linux kernel to support their ARM HDLCD display controller and Mali DP500, DP550 and DP650 SIP blocks in December 2015 and April 2016.\n\nImagination Technologies is a fabless semiconductor company which develops and licenses semiconductor intellectual property cores, among which are the PowerVR GPUs. Intel has manufactured a number of PowerVR-based GPUs. PowerVR GPUs are widely used in mobile SoCs. The company does not provide a FOSS driver or public documentation for the PowerVR. Due to its wide use in embedded devices, the Free Software Foundation has put reverse-engineering of the PowerVR driver on its high-priority project list.\n\nVivante Corporation is a fabless semiconductor company which licenses semiconductor intellectual property cores and develops the GCxxxx series of GPUs. A Vivante proprietary, closed-source Linux driver consists of kernel- and user-space parts. Although the kernel component is open-source (GPL), the user-space components—consisting of the GLES(2) implementations and a HAL library—are not; these contain the bulk of the driver logic.\n\nWladimir J. van der Laan found and documented the state bits, command stream and shader ISA by studying how the blobs work, examining and manipulating command-stream dumps. The Etnaviv Gallium3D driver is being written based on this documentation. Van der Laan's work was inspired by the Lima driver, and the project has produced a functional-but-unoptimized Gallium3D LLVM driver. The Etnaviv driver has performed better than Vivante's proprietary code in some benchmarks, and it supports Vivante's GC400, GC800, GC1000, GC2000, and GC3000 series. In January 2017, Etnaviv was added to Mesa with both OpenGL ES 2.0 and Desktop OpenGL 2.0 support.\n\nQualcomm develops the Adreno (formerly ATI Imageon) GPU series, and includes it as part of their Snapdragon system. Phoronix and Slashdot reported in 2012 that Rob Clark, inspired by the Lima driver, was working on reverse-engineering drivers for the Adreno GPU series. In a referenced blog post, Clark wrote that he was doing the project in his spare time and that the Qualcomm platform was his only viable target for working on open 3D graphics. His employers (Texas Instruments and Linaro) were affiliated with the Imagination PowerVR and ARM Mali cores, which would have been his primary targets; he had working command streams for 2D support, and 3D commands seemed to have the same characteristics. The driver code was published on Gitorious \"freedreno\",\nand has been moved to Mesa. In 2012, a working shader assembler was completed;\ndemonstration versions were developed for texture mapping and phong shading, using the reverse-engineered shader compiler.\nClark demonstrated Freedreno running desktop compositing, the XBMC media player and Quake III Arena at FOSDEM on February 2, 2013.\n\nIn August 2013, the kernel component of freedreno (MSM driver) was accepted into mainline and is available in Linux kernel 3.12 and later. The DDX driver gained support for server-managed file descriptors requiring X.Org Server version 1.16 and above in July 2014. In January 2016, the Mesa Gallium3D-style driver gained support for Adreno 430; in November of that year, the driver added support for the Adreno 500 series. Freedreno can be used on devices such as 96Boards Dragonboard 410c and Nexus 7 (2013) in traditional Linux distributions (like Debian and Fedora) and on Android.\n\nBroadcom develops and designs the VideoCore GPU series as part of their SoCs. Since it is used by the Raspberry Pi, there has been considerable interest in a FOSS driver for VideoCore. The Raspberry Pi Foundation, in co-operation with Broadcom, announced on October 24, 2012 that they open-sourced \"all the ARM (CPU) code that drives the GPU\". However, the announcement was misleading; according to the author of the reverse-engineered Lima driver, the newly open-sourced components only allowed message-passing between the ARM CPU and VideoCore but offered little insight into Videocore and little additional programability. The Videocore GPU runs an RTOS which handles the processing; video acceleration is done with RTOS firmware coded for its proprietary GPU, and the firmware was not open-sourced on that date. Since there was neither a toolchain targeting the proprietary GPU nor a documented instruction set, no advantage could be taken if the firmware source code became available. The Videocoreiv project attempted to document the VideoCore GPUs.\n\nOn February 28, 2014 (the Raspberry Pi's second anniversary), Broadcom and the Raspberry Pi Foundation announced the release of full documentation for the VideoCore IV graphics core and a complete source release of the graphics stack under a 3-clause BSD license. The free-license 3D graphics code was committed to Mesa on 29 August 2014, and first appeared on Mesa's 10.3 release.\n\nAlthough Silicon Integrated Systems and VIA Technologies have expressed limited interest in open-source drivers, both have released source code which has been integrated into X.Org by FOSS developers. In July 2008, VIA opened documentation of their products to improve its image in the Linux and open-source communities. The company has failed to work with the open-source community to provide documentation and a working DRM driver, leaving expectations of Linux support unfulfilled. On January 6, 2011, it was announced that VIA was no longer interested in supporting free graphics initiatives.\n\nDisplayLink announced an open-source project, Libdlo, with the goal of bringing support for their USB graphics technology to Linux and other platforms. Its code is available under the LGPL license, but it has not been integrated into an X.Org driver. DisplayLink graphics support is available through the kernel udlfb driver (with fbdev) in mainline and udl/drm driver, which in March 2012 was only available in the drm-next tree.\n\nNon-hardware-related vendors may also assist free graphics initiatives. Red Hat has two full-time employees (David Airlie and Jérôme Glisse) working on Radeon software, and the Fedora Project sponsors a Fedora Graphics Test Week event before the launch of their new Linux distribution versions to test free graphics drivers. Other companies which have provided development or support include Novell and VMware.\n\nProject VGA aims to create a low-budget, open-source VGA-compatible video card.\nThe Open Graphics Project aims to create an open-hardware GPU. The Open Graphics Device v1 has dual DVI-I outputs and a 100-pin IDC connector. In September 2010, the first 25 OGD1 boards were made available for grant application and purchase. The Milkymist system on a chip, targeted at embedded graphics instead of desktop computers, supports a VGA output, a limited vertex shader and a 2D texturing unit.\n\nThe Nyuzi, an experimental GPGPU processor, includes a synthesizable hardware design written in System Verilog, an instruction set emulator, an LLVM-based C-C++ compiler, software libraries and tests and explores parallel software and hardware. It can run on a Terasic DE2-115 field-programmable gate array board.\n\nIf a project uses FPGAs, it generally has a partially (or completely) closed-source toolchain. There are relatively few FPGAs with completely open-source toolchains.\n\n\nATI Mobility™ and Integrated Mobility™ Product Family\nSupport\nThe ATI Catalyst™ Linux software suite is designed to support the following ATI Mobility™\nproducts:\nAMD Mobility Product Family Support\nATI Mobility Radeon™ X3870 ATI Mobility Radeon™ X3430\nATI Mobility Radeon™ X3850 ATI Mobility Radeon™ X3400\nATI Mobility Radeon™ X3830 ATI Mobility Radeon™ X2600\nATI Mobility Radeon™ X3670 ATI Mobility Radeon™ X2400\nATI Mobility Radeon™ X3650 ATI Mobility Radeon™ X2300\n\n"}

Advocates of this view claim that since we live as part of one planet's photosynthesis chain and are trapped within its gravity well, we are effectively components of one large body—that being the global ecology of Earth itself.\n\nAnother name for this value theory is \"radical values environmentalism,\" which holds that individuals and societies are ways to create such a thriving ecosystem, but cannot be considered as being ends in themselves.\n\nAn early advocate of this view was Buckminster Fuller, who developed the Dymaxion Map of the world, the first world projection to show the continents on a flat surface without visible distortion—and the earth as being essentially one island in one ocean. In \"Critical Path\", 1981, he claimed to prove that \"gravity is love.\" Critics say this view makes humans \"slaves of the Earth\" and argue that human destiny is to spread out to find or form many living worlds. In contrast, some \"Gaians\" see such colonists as locusts or a disease, and may see all human beings as elements of a single Earth-wide ecology, if not organism. They are often hard to differentiate from members of the New Age movement, with which they share the goal of deep spiritual integration.\n\nPolitical Gaians are a relatively recent offshoot of the ecology movement—and get their name from the Gaia hypothesis, a postulate first devised by James Lovelock holding that the biosphere tends to homeorhetic balance or even homeostasis (with the implication that human beings should be working toward such balances or states.) \n\n"}
{"id": "98394", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=98394", "title": "Gorgias", "text": "Gorgias\n\nGorgias ( 485 – 380 BC) was an ancient Greek sophist, pre-Socratic philosopher, and rhetorician who was a native of Leontinoi in Sicily. Along with Protagoras, he forms the first generation of Sophists. Several doxographers report that he was a pupil of Empedocles, although he would only have been a few years younger. \"Like other Sophists, he was an itinerant that practiced in various cities and giving public exhibitions of his skill at the great pan-Hellenic centers of Olympia and Delphi, and charged fees for his instruction and performances. A special feature of his displays was to ask miscellaneous questions from the audience and give impromptu replies.\" He has been called \"Gorgias the Nihilist\" although the degree to which this epithet adequately describes his philosophy is controversial.\n\nHis chief claim to recognition is that he transplanted rhetoric from his native Sicily to Attica, and contributed to the diffusion of the Attic dialect as the language of literary prose.\n\nGorgias was born sometime between 490 and 480 BC in Leontinoi, a Chalcidian colony in eastern Sicily that was allied with Athens. His father's name was Charmantides. He had a brother named Herodicus, who was a physician, and sometimes accompanied him during his travels. He also had a sister, whose name is not known, but whose grandson dedicated a golden statue to his great uncle at Delphi. It not known whether Gorgias married or had children. Gorgias is said to have studied under the Sicilian philosopher Empedocles of Acragas ( 490 –  430 BC), but it is not known when, where, for how long, or in what capacity. He may have also studied under the rhetoricians Corax of Syracuse and Tisias, but very little is known about either of these men, nor is anything known about their relationship with Gorgias.\n\nIt is not known what kind of role Gorgias may have played in the politics in his native Leontinoi, but it is known that, in 427 BC, when he was around sixty years old, he was sent to Athens by his fellow-citizens as the head of an embassy to ask for Athenian protection against the aggression of the Syracusans. After 427 BC, Gorgias appears to have settled in mainland Greece, living at various points in a number of city-states, including Athens and Larisa. He was well-known for delivering orations at Panhellenic Festivals and is described as having been \"conspicuous\" at Olympia. There is no surviving record of any role he might have played in organizing the festivals themselves.\n\nGorgias's primary occupation was as a teacher of rhetoric. According to Aristotle, his students included Isocrates. (Other students are named in later traditions; the \"Suda\" adds Pericles, Polus, and Alcidamas, Diogenes Laërtius mentions Antisthenes, and according to Philostratus, \"I understand that he attracted the attention of the most admired men, Critias and Alcibiades who were young, and Thucydides and Pericles who were already old. Agathon too, the tragic poet, whom Comedy regards as wise and eloquent, often Gorgianizes in his iambic verse\"). Additionally, although they are not described as his students, Gorgias is widely thought to have influenced the styles of the historian Thucydides, the tragic playwright Agathon, the doctor Hippocrates, the rhetorician Alcidamas, and the poet and commentator Lycophron.\n\nGorgias is reputed to have lived to be one hundred and eight\nyears old (Matsen, Rollinson and Sousa, 33). He won admiration for his ability to speak on any subject (Matsen, Rollinson and Sousa, 33). He accumulated considerable wealth; enough to commission a gold statue of himself for a public temple. After his Pythian Oration, the Greeks installed a solid gold statue of him in the temple of Apollo at Delphi (Matsen, Rollinson and Sousa, 33). He died at Larissa in Thessaly.\n\nThe philosophies of the pre-Socratic Greek Sophists are controversial among scholars in general, due to their highly subtle and ambiguous writings and also to the fact that they are best known as characters in Plato's dialogues. Gorgias, however, is particularly frustrating for modern scholars to attempt to understand. While scholars debate the precise subtleties of the teachings of Protagoras, Hippias, and Prodicus, they generally agree on the basic frameworks of what these thinkers believed. With Gorgias, however, scholars widely disagree on even the most basic framework of his ideas, including over whether or not that framework even existed at all. The greatest hindrance to scholarly understanding of Gorgias's philosophy is that the vast majority of his writings have been lost and those that have survived have suffered considerable alteration by later copyists.\n\nThese difficulties are further compounded by the fact that Gorgias's rhetoric is frequently elusive and confusing; he makes many of his most important points using elaborate, but highly ambiguous, metaphors, similes, and puns. Many of Gorgias's propositions are also thought to be sarcastic, playful, or satirical. In his treatise \"On Rhetoric\", Aristotle characterizes Gorgias's style of oratory as \"pervasively ironic\" and states that Gorgias recommended responding to seriousness with jests and to jests with seriousness. Gorgias frequently blurs the lines between serious philosophical discourse and satire, which makes it extremely difficult for scholars to tell when he is being serious and when he is merely joking. Gorgias frequently contradicts his own statements and adopts inconsistent perspectives on different issues. As a result of all these factors, Scott Porter Consigny calls him \"perhaps the most elusive of the polytropic quarry hunted in Plato's \"Sophist\".\n\nGorgias has been labelled \"The Nihilist\" because some scholars have interpreted his thesis on \"the non-existent\" to be an argument against the existence of anything that is straightforwardly endorsed by Gorgias himself. Nihilism is the belief that all values are baseless and that nothing can be known or communicated. It is associated with pessimism and a radical skepticism that condemns existence. \n\nGorgias presented his nihilist arguments in \"On Non-Existence\"; however, the original text is no longer extant. We only know his arguments through commentary by Sextus Empiricus and Pseudo-Aristotle’s \"De Melisso, Xenophane, Gorgia.\" Ostensibly Gorgias developed three sequential arguments: first, that nothing exists; second, that even if existence exists, it is inapprehensible to humans; and third, that even if existence is apprehensible, it certainly cannot be communicated or interpreted to one’s neighbors. \n\nThat being said, there is consensus in late 20th century and early 21st century scholarship that the label 'nihilist' is misleading, in part because if his argument were genuinely meant to support nihilism it would be self-undermining. The argument, of course, \"is\" itself something, and has pretensions to communicate knowledge, in conflict with its explicit pronouncement that there is nothing and that it can't be known or communicated. Gisela Striker argues: \"I find it hard to believe that anyone should ever have thought that Gorgias seriously advocated the view that nothing is and that he was, therefore, a 'nihilist.' Similarly Caston states: \"Gorgias would have to be not merely disconsolate, but quite dull-witted, to have missed the conflict between his presentation and its content\" Finally, Wardy says, \"This sadly mistaken reading overlooks the most obvious consequence of Gorgias' \"paradoxologia\" (παραδοξολογία): his message refutes itself, and in consequence, so far from constituting a theory of \"logos\", it confronts us with a picture of what language cannot be, with what it cannot be assumed to aspire to be.\" Gigon and Newiger make similar points.\n\nGorgias ushered in rhetorical innovations involving structure and ornamentation, and the introduced \"paradoxologia\" – the idea of paradoxical thought and paradoxical expression. For these advancements, Gorgias has been labeled the \"father of sophistry\" (Wardy 6). Gorgias is also known for contributing to the diffusion of the Attic Greek dialect as the language of literary prose. Gorgias was the first orator known to develop and teach a \"distinctive style of speaking\" (Matsen, Rollinson and Sousa, 33).\n\nGorgias’ extant rhetorical works—\"Encomium of Helen\" (Ἑλένης ἐγκώμιον), \"Defense of Palamedes\" (Ὑπέρ Παλαμήδους ἀπολογία), \"On Non-Existence\" (Περὶ τοῦ μὴ ὄντος ἢ Περὶ φύσεως), and \"Epitaphios\" (Επιτάφιος) —come to us via a work entitled \"Technai\" (Τέχναι), a manual of rhetorical instruction, which may have consisted of models to be memorized and demonstrate various principles of rhetorical practice (Leitch, et al. 29). Although some scholars claim that each work presents opposing statements, the four texts can be read as interrelated contributions to the up-and-coming theory and art (\"technē\") of rhetoric (McComiskey 32). Of Gorgias’ surviving works, only the \"Encomium\" and the \"Defense\" are believed to exist in their entirety. Meanwhile, there are his own speeches, rhetorical, political, or other. A number of these are referred to and quoted by Aristotle, including a speech on Hellenic unity, a funeral oration for Athenians fallen in war, and a brief quotation from an \"Encomium on the Eleans.\" Apart from the speeches, there are paraphrases of the treatise \"On Nature or the Non-Existent.\" These works are each part of the Diels-Kranz collection, and although academics consider this source reliable, many of the works included are fragmentary and corrupt. Questions have also been raised as to the authenticity and accuracy of the texts attributed to Gorgias (Consigny 4).\n\nGorgias’ writings are intended to be both rhetorical (persuasive) and performative. He goes to great lengths to exhibit his ability of making an absurd, argumentative position appear stronger. Consequently, each of his works defend positions that are unpopular, paradoxical and even absurd. The performative nature of Gorgias’ writings is exemplified by the way that he playfully approaches each argument with stylistic devices such as parody, artificial figuration and theatricality (Consigny 149). Gorgias’ style of argumentation can be described as poetics-minus-the-meter (\"poiêsis-minus-meter\"). Gorgias argues that persuasive words have power (\"dunamis\") that is equivalent to that of the gods and as strong as physical force. In the \"Encomium\", Gorgias likens the effect of speech on the soul to the effect of drugs on the body: \"Just as different drugs draw forth different humors from the body – some putting a stop to disease, others to life – so too with words: some cause pain, others joy, some strike fear, some stir the audience to boldness, some benumb and bewitch the soul with evil persuasion\" (Gorgias 32). The \"Encomium\" \"argues for the totalizing power of language.\"\n\nGorgias also believed that his \"magical incantations\" would bring healing to the human psyche by controlling powerful emotions. He paid particular attention to the sounds of words, which, like poetry, could captivate audiences. His florid, rhyming style seemed to hypnotize his audiences (Herrick 42). \n\nUnlike other Sophists, such as Protagoras, Gorgias did not profess to teach \"arete\" (excellence, or, virtue). He believed that there was no absolute form of \"arete\", but that it was relative to each situation. For example, virtue in a slave was not the same as virtue in a statesman. He believed that rhetoric, the art of persuasion, was the king of all sciences, since he saw it as a techné with which one could persuade an audience toward any course of action. While rhetoric existed in the curriculum of every Sophist, Gorgias placed more prominence upon it than any of the others.\n\nMuch debate over both the nature and value of rhetoric begins with Gorgias. Plato's dialogue \"Gorgias\" presents a counter-argument to Gorgias’ embrace of rhetoric, its elegant form, and performative nature (Wardy 2). The dialogue tells the story of a debate about rhetoric, politics and justice that occurred at a dinner gathering between Socrates and a small group of Sophists. Plato attempts to show that rhetoric does not meet the requirements to actually be considered a \"technê\" but rather is a somewhat dangerous \"knack\" to possess, both for the orator and for his audience, because it gives the ignorant the power to seem more knowledgeable than an expert to a group.\n\nGorgias is the author of a lost work: \"On Nature or the Non-Existent\" (also \"On Non-Existence\"). Rather than being one of his rhetorical works, it presented a theory of being that at the same time refuted and parodied the Eleatic thesis. The original text was lost and today there remain just two paraphrases of it. The first is preserved by the philosopher Sextus Empiricus in \"Against the Professors\" and the other by the anonymous author of \"On Melissus, Xenophanes, and Gorgias\". Each work, however, excludes material that is discussed in the other, which suggests that each version may represent intermediary sources (Consigny 4). It is clear, however, that the work developed a skeptical argument, which has been extracted from the sources and translated as below:\n\nThe argument has largely been seen as an ironic refutation of Parmenides' thesis on Being. Gorgias set out to prove that it is as easy to demonstrate that being is one, unchanging and timeless as it is to prove that being has no existence at all. Regardless of how it \"has largely been seen\" it seems clear that Gorgias was focused instead on the notion that true objectivity is impossible since the human mind can never be separated from its possessor.\n\n\"How can anyone communicate the idea of color by means of words since the ear does not hear colors but only sounds?\" This quote, written by the Sicilian philosopher Gorgias, was used to show his theory that ‘there is nothing’, ‘if there were anything no one would know it’, ‘and if anyone did know it, no one could communicate it’. This theory, thought of in the late 5th century BC, is still being contemplated by many philosophers throughout the world. This argument has led some to label Gorgias a nihilist (one who believes nothing exists, or that the world is incomprehensible, and that the concept of truth is fictitious).\n\nFor the first main argument where Gorgias says, \"there is no-thing\", he tries to persuade the reader that thought and existence are not the same. By claiming that if thought and existence truly were the same, then everything that anyone thought would suddenly exist. He also attempted to prove that words and sensations couldn’t be measured by the same standards, for even though words and sensations are both derived from the mind, they are essentially different. This is where his second idea comes into place.\n\nThe Encomium of Helen is considered to be a good example of epideictic oratory and was supposed to have been Gorgias' \"show piece or demonstration piece,\" which was used to attract students (Matsen, Rollinson and Sousa, 33). In their writings, Gorgias and other sophists speculated \"about the structure and function of language\" as a framework for expressing the implications of action and the ways decisions about such actions were made\" (Jarratt 103). And this is exactly the purpose of Gorgias’ \"Encomium of Helen\". Of the three divisions of rhetoric discussed by Aristotle in his \"Rhetoric\" (forensic, deliberative, and epideictic), the \"Encomium\" can be classified as an epideictic speech, expressing praise for Helen of Troy and ridding her of the blame she faced for leaving Sparta with Paris (Wardy 26).\n\nHelen – the proverbial \"Helen of Troy\" – exemplified both sexual passion and tremendous beauty for the Greeks. She was the daughter of Zeus and Leda, the Queen of Sparta, and her beauty was seen by the Trojans as the direct cause of the decade long Trojan War between Greece and Troy. The war began after the goddesses Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite asked Paris (a Trojan prince) to select who was the most beautiful of the three. Each goddess tried to influence Paris’ decision, but he ultimately chose Aphrodite who then promised Paris the most beautiful woman. Paris then traveled to Greece where he was greeted by Helen and her husband Menelaus. Under the influence of Aphrodite, Helen allowed Paris to persuade her to elope with him. Together they traveled to Troy, not only sparking the war, but also a popular and literary tradition of blaming Helen for her wrongdoing. It is this tradition which Gorgias confronts in the \"Encomium\".\n\nThe \"Encomium\" opens with Gorgias explaining that \"a man, woman, speech, deed, city or action that is worthy of praise should be honored with acclaim, but the unworthy should be branded with blame\" (Gorgias 30). In the speech Gorgias discusses the possible reasons for Helen’s journey to Troy. He explains that Helen could have been persuaded in one of four ways: by the gods, by physical force, by love, or by speech (\"logos\"). If it were indeed the plan of the gods that caused Helen to depart for Troy, Gorgias argues that those who blame her should face blame themselves, \"for a human’s anticipation cannot restrain a god’s inclination\" (Gorgias 31). Gorgias explains that, by nature, the weak are ruled by the strong, and, since the gods are stronger than humans in all respects, Helen should be freed from her undesirable reputation. If, however, Helen was abducted by force, it is clear that the aggressor committed a crime. Thus, it should be he, not Helen, who should be blamed. And if Helen was persuaded by love, she should also be rid of ill repute because \"if love is a god, with the divine power of the gods, how could a weaker person refuse and reject him? But if love is a human sickness and a mental weakness, it must not be blamed as mistake, but claimed as misfortune\" (Gorgias 32). Finally, if speech persuaded Helen, Gorgias claims he can easily clear her of blame. Gorgias explains: \"Speech is a powerful master and achieves the most divine feats with the smallest and least evident body. It can stop fear, relieve pain, create joy, and increase pity\" (Gorgias 31). It is here that Gorgias compares the effect of speech on the mind with the effect of drugs on the body. He states that Helen has the power to \"lead\" many bodies in competition by using her body as a weapon (Gumpert, 74). This image of \"bodies led and misled, brought together and led apart, is of paramount importance in Gorgias' speech,\" (Gumpert, 74).\n\nWhile Gorgias primarily used metaphors and paradox, he famously used \"figures of speech, or schemata,\" (Matsen, Rollinson and Sousa). This included balanced clauses (isocolon), the joining of contrasting ideas (antithesis), the structure of successive clauses (parison), and the repetition of word endings (homoeoteleuton) (Matsen, Rollinson and Sousa, 33). The \"Encomium\" shows Gorgias' interest in argumentation, as he makes his point by \"systematically refuting a series of possible alternatives,\" (Matsen, Rollinson and Sousa, 33). It is an encomium of the \"rhetorical craft itself, and a demonstration of its power over us,\" (Gumpert, 73). According to Van Hook, \"The Encomium of Helen\" abounds in \"amplification and brevity, a rhythm making prose akin to poetry, bold metaphors and poetic or unusual epithets\" (122).\n\nIn the \"Defense of Palamedes\" Gorgias describes logos as a positive instrument for creating ethical arguments (McComiskey 38). The \"Defense\", an oration that deals with issues of morality and political commitment (Consigny 38), defends Palamedes who, in Greek mythology, is credited with the invention of the alphabet, written laws, numbers, armor, and measures and weights (McComiskey 47).\n\nIn the speech Palamedes defends himself against the charge of treason. In Greek mythology, Odysseus – in order to avoid going to Troy with Agamemnon and Menelaus to bring Helen back to Sparta – pretended to have gone mad and began sowing the fields with salt. When Palamedes threw Odysseus' son, Telemachus, in front of the plow, Odysseus avoided him, demonstrating that he was sane. Odysseus, who never forgave Palamedes for making him reveal himself, later accused Palamedes of betraying the Greeks to the Trojans. Soon after, Palamedes was condemned and killed (Jarratt 58).\n\nIn this epideictic speech, like the \"Encomium\", Gorgias is concerned with experimenting with how plausible arguments can cause conventional truths to be doubted (Jarratt 59). Throughout the text, Gorgias presents a method for composing logical (\"logos\"), ethical (\"ethos\") and emotional (\"pathos\") arguments from possibility, which are similar to those described by Aristotle in \"Rhetoric\". These types of arguments about motive and capability presented in the \"Defense\" are later described by Aristotle as forensic \"topoi\". Gorgias demonstrates that in order to prove that treason had been committed, a set of possible occurrences also need to be established. In the \"Defense\" these occurrences are as follows: communication between Palamedes and the enemy, exchange of a pledge in the form of hostages or money, and not being detected by guards or citizens. In his defense, Palamedes claims that a small sum of money would not have warranted such a large undertaking and reasons that a large sum of money, if indeed such a transaction had been made, would require the aid of many confederates in order for it to be transported. Palamedes reasons further that such an exchange could neither have occurred at night because the guards would be watching, nor in the day because everyone would be able to see. Palamedes continues, explaining that if the aforementioned conditions were, in fact, arranged then action would need to follow. Such action needed to take place either with or without confederates; however, if these confederates were free men then they were free to disclose any information they desired, but if they were slaves there was a risk of their voluntarily accusing to earn freedom, or accusing by force when tortured. Slaves, Palamedes says, are untrustworthy. Palamedes goes on to list a variety of possible motives, all of which he proves false.\n\nThrough the \"Defense\" Gorgias demonstrates that a motive requires an advantage such as status, wealth, honour, and security, and insists that Palamedes lacked a motive (McComiskey 47-49).\n\nThis text is considered to be an important contribution to the genre of epitaphios. During the 5th and 4th centuries BC, such funeral orations were delivered by well-known orators during public burial ceremonies in Athens, whereby those who died in wars were honoured. Gorgias’ text provides a clever critique of 5th century propagandist rhetoric in imperial Athens and is the basis for Plato’s parody, \"Menexenus\" (Consigny 2).\n\nPlato was one of Gorgias’ greatest critics and a student of Socrates. Plato’s dislike for sophistic doctrines is well known, and it is in his eponymous dialogue that both Gorgias himself as well as his rhetorical beliefs are ridiculed (McComiskey 17).\n\nIn his dialogue \"Gorgias\", Plato distinguishes between philosophy and rhetoric, characterizing Gorgias as a shallow, opportunistic orator who entertains his audience with his eloquent words and who believes that it is unnecessary to learn the truth about actual matters when one has discovered the art of persuasion. In the dialogue, Gorgias responds to one of Socrates’ statements as follows: \"Rhetoric is the only area of expertise you need to learn. You can ignore all the rest and still get the better of the professionals!\" (Plato 24).\n\nGorgias, whose \"On Non-Existence\" is taken to be critical of the Eleatic tradition and its founder Parmenides, describes philosophy as a type of seduction, but he does not deny philosophy entirely, giving some respect to philosophers.\n\nPlato answers Gorgias by reaffirming the Parmenidean ideal that being is the basic substance and reality of which all things are composed, insisting that philosophy is a dialectic distinct from and superior to rhetoric (Wardy 52).\n\nAristotle also criticizes Gorgias, labeling him a mere Sophist whose primary goal is to make money by appearing wise and clever, thus deceiving the public by means of misleading or sophistic arguments.\n\nDespite these negative portrayals, Gorgias's style of rhetoric was highly influential. Gorgias's \"Defense of Helen\" influenced Euripides's \"Helen\" and his \"Defense of Palamedes\" influenced the development of western dicanic argument, including possibly even Plato's version of the \"Apology of Socrates\".\n\nFor almost all of western history, Gorgias has been a marginalized and obscure figure in both philosophical thought and culture at large. In the nineteenth century, however, writers such as the German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770 – 1831) and the English classicist George Grote (1794 – 1871) began to work to \"rehabilitate\" Gorgias and the other Sophists from their longstanding reputation as unscrupulous charlatans who taught people how to persuade others using rhetoric for unjust causes. As early as 1872, the English philosopher Henry Sidgwick (1838 – 1900) was already calling this the \"old view\". Modern sources continue to affirm that the old stereotype of the Sophists is not accurate.\n\nSince the late twentieth century, scholarly interest in Gorgias has increased dramatically and the amount of research conducted on him is even beginning to rival the research on his more traditionally popular contemporary Parmenides. Gorgias's distinctive writing style, filled with antithesis and figurative language, has been seen as foreshadowing the later development of Menippean satire, as well as, in more recent times, the mannerist, grotesque, and carnivalesque genres. Several scholars have even argued that Gorgias's thoughts on the nature of knowledge, language, and truth foreshadow the views of modern philosophers such as Martin Heidigger, Jacques Derrida, Ludwig Wittgenstein, A. J. Ayer, Amélie Rorty, and Stanley Fish. Nonetheless, many academic philosophers still ridicule any efforts to portray Gorgias as a serious thinker.\n\n\n\n"}

Various Islamic commentaries describe hikmah as \"to know the best of things by way of the best of sciences ...\", having experience, using \"justice in judging\", \"knowledge of the reality of things\", \"that which prevents ignorance,\" putting \"things in their proper places, assigning them to their proper status\", etc. According to Ibn al-Qayyim, the highest and most exclusive of the three levels of hikmah are \"reserved for the Companions over the rest of the Ummah, and it is the highest level that the [Islamic] scholars can reach.\"\n\nAs a term of \"fiqh\" (Islamic jurisprudence), Taqi Usmani describes it as meaning \"the wisdom and the philosophy taken into account by the legislator while framing the [Islamic] law or the benefit intended to be drawn by [the law's] enforcement\".

{"id": "24008546", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24008546", "title": "Iatrogenesis", "text": "Iatrogenesis\n\nIatrogenesis (from the Greek for \"brought forth by the healer\") refers to any effect on a person resulting from any activity of one or more other persons acting as healthcare professionals or promoting products or services as beneficial to health which does not support a goal of the person affected.\n\nWhile some have advocated using the term to refer to all \"events caused by the health care delivery team\", whether \"positive or negative\", consensus limits use of iatrogenesis to adverse effects, including (in the broadest sense) all adverse unforeseen outcomes resulting from medication or other medical treatment or intervention. Some iatrogenic effects are clearly defined and easily recognized, such as a complication following a surgical procedure (\"e.g.\", lymphedema as a result of breast cancer surgery); less obvious ones, such as complex drug interactions, may require significant investigation to identify.\n\nCases of iatrogenesis may include:\n\nUnlike an adverse event, an iatrogenic effect is not always harmful. For example, a scar created by surgery is said to be iatrogenic even though it does not represent improper care and may not be troublesome.\n\nProfessionals who may cause iatrogenic harm to patients include physicians, pharmacists, nurses, dentists, psychologists, psychiatrists, medical laboratory scientists and therapists. Iatrogenesis can also result from complementary and alternative medicine treatments. Globally, as of 2013, an estimated 20 million negative effects from treatment occurred. It is estimated that 142,000 people died in 2013 from adverse effects of medical treatment, up from 94,000 in 1990.\n\n\nIatrogenic conditions do not necessarily result from medical errors, such as mistakes made in surgery, or the prescription or dispensing of the wrong therapy, such as a drug. In fact, intrinsic and sometimes adverse effects of a medical treatment are iatrogenic. For example, radiation therapy and chemotherapy — necessarily aggressive for therapeutic effect — frequently produce such iatrogenic effects as hair loss, hemolytic anemia, diabetes insipidus, vomiting, nausea, brain damage, lymphedema, infertility, etc. The loss of function resulting from the required removal of a diseased organ is iatrogenic, as in the case of diabetes consequential to the removal of all or part of the pancreas.\n\nThe incidence of iatrogenesis may be misleading in some cases. For example, ruptured aortic aneurysm is fatal in most cases; the survival rate for a ruptured aortic aneurysm is under 25%. Patients who die during or after an operation will still be considered iatrogenic deaths, but the procedure itself remains a better bet than the 100% probability of death if left untreated.\n\nOther situations may involve actual negligence or faulty procedures, such as when pharmacotherapists produce handwritten prescriptions for drugs.\n\nA very common iatrogenic effect is caused by drug interaction, i.e., when pharmacotherapists fail to check for all medications a patient is taking and prescribe new ones that interact agonistically or antagonistically (thereby potentiating or attenuating the intended therapeutic effect). Such situations can cause significant morbidity and mortality. Adverse reactions, such as allergic reactions to drugs, even when unexpected by pharmacotherapists, are also classified as iatrogenic.\n\nThe evolution of antibiotic resistance in bacteria is iatrogenic as well. Bacteria strains resistant to antibiotics have evolved in response to the overprescription of antibiotic drugs.\n\nCertain drugs are toxic in their own right in therapeutic doses because of their mechanism of action. Alkylating antineoplastic agents, for example, cause DNA damage, which is more harmful to cancer cells than regular cells. However, alkylation causes severe side-effects and is actually carcinogenic in its own right, with potential to lead to the development of secondary tumors. In a similar manner, arsenic-based medications like melarsoprol, used to treat trypanosomiasis, can cause arsenic poisoning.\n\nAdverse effects can appear mechanically. The design of some surgical instruments may be decades old, hence certain adverse effects (such as tissue trauma) may never have been properly cauterized.\n\nIn psychiatry, iatrogenesis can occur due to misdiagnosis (including diagnosis with a false condition, as was the case of hystero-epilepsy). An example of a partially iatrogenic condition due to common misdiagnosis is bipolar disorder, especially in pediatric patients. Other conditions such as somatoform disorder and chronic fatigue syndrome are theorized to have significant sociocultural and iatrogenic components. Posttraumatic stress disorder is hypothesized to be prone to iatrogenic complications based on treatment modality.\n\nThe psychiatric treatment of some conditions and populations, such as substance abuse, and antisocial youths are regarded as carrying significant risks for iatrogenesis. At the other end of the spectrum, dissociative identity disorder is considered by a minority of theorists to be a wholly iatrogenic disorder with the bulk of diagnoses arising from a tiny fraction of practitioners.\n\nThe degree of association of any particular condition with iatrogenesis is unclear and in some cases controversial. The over-diagnosis of psychiatric conditions (with the assignment of mental illness terminology) may relate primarily to clinician dependence on subjective criteria. The assignment of pathological nomenclature is rarely a benign process and can easily rise to the level of emotional iatrogenesis, especially when no alternatives outside of the diagnostic naming process have been considered. Many former patients come to the conclusion that their difficulties are largely the result of the power relationships inherent in psychiatric treatment, which has led to the rise of the anti-psychiatry movement.\n\nMeessen et al. used the term \"iatrogenic poverty\" to describe impoverishment induced by medical care. Impoverishment is described for households exposed to catastrophic health expenditure or to hardship financing. Every year, worldwide, over 100,000 households fall into poverty due to health care expenses. A study reported that in the United States in 2001, illness and medical debt caused half of all personal bankruptcies. Especially in countries in economic transition, the willingness to pay for health care is increasing, and the supply side does not stay behind and develops very fast. But the regulatory and protective capacity in those countries is often lagging behind. Patients easily fall into a vicious cycle of illness, ineffective therapies, consumption of savings, indebtedness, sale of productive assets, and eventually poverty.\n\nThe 20th-century social critic Ivan Illich broadened the concept of medical iatrogenesis in his 1974 book \"Medical Nemesis: The Expropriation of Health\" by defining it at three levels.\n\nGlobally it is estimated that 142,000 people died in 2013 from adverse effects of medical treatment, an increase of 51 percent from 94,000 in 1990. In the United States, estimated deaths per year include:\n\nBased on these figures, iatrogenesis may cause as many as 225,000 deaths per year in the United States (excluding recognizable error). An earlier Institute of Medicine report estimated 230,000 to 284,000 iatrogenic deaths annually.\n\nThe term iatrogenesis means \"brought forth by a healer\", from the Greek ἰατρός (\"iatros\", \"healer\") and γένεσις (\"genesis\", \"origin\"); as such, in its earlier forms, it could refer to good or bad effects.\n\nSince at least the time of Hippocrates, people have recognized the potentially damaging effects of medical intervention. \"First do no harm\" (\"primum non nocere\") is a primary Hippocratic mandate in modern medical ethics. Iatrogenic illness or death caused purposefully or by avoidable error or negligence on the healer's part became a punishable offense in many civilizations.\n\nThe transfer of pathogens from the autopsy room to maternity patients, leading to shocking historical mortality rates of puerperal fever (also known as \"childbed fever\") at maternity institutions in the 19th century, was a major iatrogenic catastrophe of the era. The infection mechanism was first identified by Ignaz Semmelweis.\n\nWith the development of scientific medicine in the 20th century, it could be expected that iatrogenic illness or death might be more easily avoided. Antiseptics, anesthesia, antibiotics, better surgical techniques, evidence-based protocols and best practices continue to be developed to decrease iatrogenic side effects and mortality.\n\n"}

When an innocent person is wrongly convicted of a crime, legal systems which need the individual to admit guilt, for example as a prerequisite step leading to parole, punish an innocent person for his integrity, and reward a person lacking in integrity. There have been many cases where innocent prisoners were given the choice between freedom, in exchange for claiming guilt, and remaining imprisoned and telling the truth. Individuals have died in prison rather than admit to crimes which they did not commit.\n\nIt has been demonstrated in Britain that prisoners who freely admit their guilt are more likely to re-offend than prisoners who maintain their innocence. Other research, however, has found no clear link between denial of guilt and recidivism.\n\nUnited States law professor Daniel Medwed says convicts who go before a parole board maintaining their innocence are caught in a Catch-22 which he calls \"the innocent prisoner’s dilemma\". A false admission of guilt and remorse by an innocent person at a parole hearing may prevent a later investigation proving their innocence.\n\nMichael Naughton, founder of the Innocence Network UK (INUK), says work carried out by the INUK includes research and public awareness on wrongful convictions, which can effect policy reforms. Most important is the development of a system to assess prisoners maintaining innocence, to distinguish potentially innocent prisoners from the prisoners who claim innocence for other reasons like \"ignorance, misunderstanding or disagreement with criminal law; to protect another person or group from criminal conviction; or on 'abuse of process' or technical grounds in the hope of achieving an appeal.\" The system, he says, is being adopted by the prison parole board and prison service, for prisoners serving \"indeterminate sentences (where the prisoner has no release date and does not get out until a parole board decides he or she is no longer a risk to the public). Previously, such prisoners were treated as 'deniers' with no account taken of the various reasons for maintaining innocence, nor the fact that some may actually be innocent.\" Those prisoners are unable to achieve parole unless they undertake offence-behaviour courses that require the admission of guilt as a prerequisite. This was represented in the \"Porridge\" episode \"Pardon Me\". However, in recent years, this has diminished in significance; at the time Simon Hall ended his denials to murder in 2012, the Ministry of Justice denied that this would have any impact on his tariff, and his last online posting had concerned being released from prison in spite of his denials.\n\nThe murder of Linda Cook was committed in Portsmouth on 9 December 1986. The subsequent trial led to a miscarriage of justice when Michael Shirley, an 18-year-old Royal Navy sailor, was wrongly convicted of the crime and sentenced to life imprisonment. After serving the minimum 15 years, Shirley would have been released from prison had he confessed the killing to the parole board, but he refused to do so and said: \"I would have died in prison rather than admit something I didn't do. I was prepared to stay in forever if necessary to prove my innocence.\" (Shirley's conviction was eventually quashed by the Court of Appeal in 2003, on the basis of exculpatory DNA evidence.)\n\nThe Stephen Downing case involved the conviction and imprisonment in 1974 of a 17-year-old council worker, Stephen Downing, for the murder of a 32-year-old legal secretary, Wendy Sewell. His conviction was overturned in 2002, after Downing had served 27 years in prison. The case is thought to be the longest miscarriage of justice in British legal history, and attracted worldwide media attention. The case was featured in the 2004 BBC drama \"In Denial of Murder\" Downing claimed that had he falsely confessed he would have been released over a decade earlier. Because he did not admit to the crime he was classified as \"IDOM\" (In Denial of Murder) and ineligible for parole under English Law.\n\nIn the United States the reality of a person being innocent, called \"actual innocence\", is not sufficient reason for the justice system to release a prisoner. Once a verdict has been made, it is rare for a court to reconsider evidence of innocence which could have been presented at the time of the original trial. Decisions by the State Board of Pardons and Paroles regarding its treatment of prisoners who may be actually innocent have been criticized by the international community.\n\nHerbert Murray, who was convicted of murder in 1979, said, \"When the judge asked me did I have anything to say, I couldn't say, because tears were coming down and I couldn’t communicate. I couldn't turn around and tell the family that they got the wrong man.\" The judge said he believed the defense’s alibi witnesses; however, the judge was required by law to respect the jury’s decision. After being locked up for 19 years, his parole officer said \"Nineteen years is a long time. [...] But you’re no closer to the rehabilitative process than when you first walked into prison. The first step in that process is the internalization of guilt. You need to do some serious introspection, Mr. Murray, and come to grips with your behavior.\" Murray agreed with the parole officer, but maintained his innocence: \"I agree! But again, I just didn't do it.\"\n\nIn a news interview, Murray says he went before a parole board four times, maintaining his innocence until the fifth: \"I said what the hell, let me tell these people what they want to hear.\" He admitted to the parole board that he committed the crime and was taking responsibility. \"I felt like I sold my soul to the devil. Because before, I had that strength, because I stood on the truth. [...] I became so desperate to get out, I had to say something. I had to say something because what I said before didn't work.\" His parole was denied. After 29 years in prison, Medwed's Second Look clinic, a group dedicated to the release of innocent prisoners, assisted lawyers in his eighth parole board hearing which was successful, releasing him onto indefinite parole. Overturning the original conviction would be hampered by his admissions of guilt at his parole hearings.\n\nTimothy Brian Cole (1960–99) was an African American military veteran and a student wrongly convicted of raping a fellow student in 1985. Cole was convicted by a jury of rape, primarily based on the testimony of the victim, Michele Mallin. He was sentenced to 25 years in prison. While incarcerated, Cole was offered parole if he would admit guilt, but he refused. \"His greatest wish was to be exonerated and completely vindicated\", his mother stated in a press interview. Cole died after serving 14 years in prison.\n\nAnother man, Jerry Wayne Johnson, confessed to the rape in 1995. Further, Mallin later admitted that she was mistaken as to the identity of her attacker. She stated that investigators botched the gathering of evidence and withheld information from her, causing her to believe that Cole was the perpetrator. Mallin told police that the rapist smoked during the rape. However, Cole never smoked because of his severe asthma. DNA evidence later showed him to be innocent. Cole died in prison on December 2, 1999; ten years later, a district court judge announced \"to a 100 percent moral, factual and legal certainty\" that Timothy Cole did not commit the rape. He was posthumously pardoned.\n\nThe dilemma can occur even before conviction. Kalief Browder was arrested in May 2010 for allegedly stealing a backpack. He spent the next three years on Rikers Island awaiting trial, much of it in solitary. During court appearances, prosecutors routinely asked for a short delay which would turn into a much lengthier wait. At times, Browder was offered plea bargains, and at one point, he was encouraged to plead guilty to misdemeanors, for which he would be sentenced to time already served and released. When he refused the plea deal, insisting on his innocence, the judge noted \"If you go to trial and lose, you could get up to fifteen [years].\" Eventually, in May 2013, the case was dismissed because prosecutors had lost contact with the only witness they had to the alleged crime.\n\nGabe Tan reported a British conference in 2011, \"the dilemma of maintaining innocence\", concluded \"Denial is not a valid measure of risk. In fact, research has shown that prisoners who openly admit to their crimes have the highest risk of re-offending.\"\n\nIn 2011, Michael Naughton suggested the focus on new evidence by the Criminal Cases Review Commission, rather than an examination of serious problems with evidence at original trials, meant in many cases “that the dangerous criminals who committed these crimes remain at liberty with the potential to commit further serious crimes.”\n\nRobert A. Forde cited two studies at the conference. One, a ten-year study of 180 sex offenders by Harkins, Beech and Goodwill found prisoners who claimed to be innocent were the least likely to be re-convicted, and that those who 'admitted everything', claiming to be guilty, were most likely to re-offend. He also told the conference research by Hanson \"et al.\" in 2002, the denial by the prisoner of their offences had no bearing on their likelihood of re-offending.\n\n"}
{"id": "32833924", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32833924", "title": "Joseph Demarco", "text": "Joseph Demarco\n\nJoseph Demarco (1718–1793) was a Maltese medical practitioner, a scientist, and a major philosopher. His areas of specialisation in philosophy were mostly philosophical psychology and physiology.\n\nDemarco's extensive interests make him quite unique. Indeed, though his main concern was human health, in his case this must be understood in the widest of meanings. Certainly, he was fascinated by the mechanisms of the human body, but also with its infirmities, especially within their psychological and social contexts. This brought him to be very much attracted to the philosophical underpinnings of the human condition in all of its aspects. Both his life and his writings are proof enough of this.\n\nDemarco was born on January 2, 1718, at Cospicua, Malta. This seaport and dry-dock hub was also a place where many different peoples congregated. More so since the then Grand Master of the Knights Hospitallers, António Manoel de Vilhena, had given free entry to the harbours to all nations.\n\nFortunate enough to be born within a well-off family, Demarco was given a good education (including a solid knowledge of Latin), probably at the Collegium Melitense of the Jesuits in Valletta, Malta. From an early age, his eyes were set on the medical profession, one highly regarded and very much encouraged by the Knights Hospitallers. Already as a young boy, his medical intellectual curiosity drew him to speculate about the effect of atmospheric conditions on the human body, as his writing from 1933 (\"De Aere\"), at only fifteen years of age, attests. Of course, he was also very much interested in understanding physical illnesses, as his writing from 1741 (\"De Tumoribus Humoralibus\"), on swellings caused by liquid retention, shows. In addition, he was from an early age piqued by instances of pathological madness, common to congested urban areas as his home-town, Cospicua, was, and made some particular observations about the phenomenon (especially that caused by rabies) around 1742 (\"Tractatus de Rabie\").\n\nHowever, during this formative time Demarco also entertained interests in other scientific areas. Still in his early twenties, around 1742 he engaged himself in speculations on standard trigonometry (\"Trattato della Trigonometria Piana\") and elementary arithmetic (\"Vulgaris Arithmeticæ Elementaris Theoria\"), giving them also some philosophical depth. During the same period, he wrote short studies on hydrostatics in general (\"Breve Compendio dell’Idrostatica\") and on hydrostatic sources and technology (\"Trattato de Fonti e Machine Adrostiche\").\n\nAt just 24 years of age, in 1742, Demarco went to France to pursue a medical degree. Naturally, this was made possible by his parents’ financial resources. He studied at the University of Montpellier Languedoc-Roussillon région of the south of France. In particular, he studied under the renowned physician and botanist, François Boissier de Sauvages de Lacroix. This is also attested by a document written by Demarco, \"Physiologie Cursus: Anatomico – meccanico – experimentalis\" (A Course in Physiology: Anatomical – mechanical – experimental; 1765) which originates from De Sauvages’ course on the subject.\n\nDemarco's writings during this period bear out to his professional and proficient stance in medical matters. In particular, one may note his investigations dealing with chest (\"Tractatus De Morbis Pectoris\") and abdominal ailments (\"De Morbis Abdominis\"). In all probability, it was this dexterity and expertise which convinced his lecturers to trust him, from amongst his peers, with a course on physics (as his \"Traité de Physique\" attests). This must have been highly prestigious for the young freshman.\n\nHaving completed his two-year course in medicine, Demarco defended his thesis in 1743. It was entitled \"Dissertatio Physiologica de Respiratione, ejusque Uso Primario\" (Physiological Aspects of Respiration and its Primary Significance\"). The work was published a year later, in 1744, at Montpellier.\n\nDemarco returned to Malta as Doctor of Medicine, but also with a keen eye on social affairs. It seems that his acquaintance with Illuminist philosophy while in France enhanced his sensitivity towards communal needs and societal acclimatisation. Nevertheless, throughout his long career he never directly involved himself in any political activity, not even when the French Revolution erupted on the European scene.\n\nHis commitment was of a purely medical nature. And if every now and then he reached out into philosophical spheres, he always did this in strict relationship to his medical speculations. Demarco, in fact, did not seem sympathetic towards any revolutionary beliefs or objectives. On the contrary, he was a close collaborator and a personal friend of the Grand Master of the Knights Hospitallers, Manuel Pinto da Fonseca, who immediately, on Demarco's return to Malta, chose him as Principle Medical Officer for the Maltese Islands. His loyalty to the Knights Hospitallers went unblemished throughout his entire life.\n\nDemarco's main professional asset was his sharp eye for observation. This is amply attested by the thirty-four works we have from his forty-two-year career in Malta after his return from Paris. All of his speculative reflections, including his philosophical ones, squarely rest on the authority of concrete experience and on pure sense data.\n\nThough highly proficient from a professional point of view, Demarco was consistently appealed by the theoretical foundations of the medical art and by the intellectual and academic relationships which particular illnesses suggested. As seen from his various works, he inquired into philosophy in general, social philosophy, physics, pathology (as he had in his youth), mechanical physics, experimental philosophy, philosophical physiology, science in general, and various other fields of an academic and rational nature.\n\nIn 1788, when Demarco was 70 years of age (and already in poor health himself), the Grand Master of the Knights Hospitallers, Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc, requested that he went to Tripoli, then an Ottoman province, to see to the health of the pasha there, who was gravely ill. This incident demonstrates the high esteem in which Demarco was held. Not only was the matter complicated from medical point of view, but also politically sensitive (having a Christian medic treated a Muslim leader). Fortunately, the mission was a success, and Demarco's standing was never as strong. While in Tripoli he continued to indulge his scientific and philosophical curiosity by making copiousness notes about the quality of the soil, the atmosphere, and also about local customs. He even took down observations about various illnesses and diseases, particularly (as was his passion) on the types of pathological madness he encountered there.\n\nOn his return to Malta, Demarco showed serious signs of physical decline. The Order of Knights Hospitallers which he loved was fatally in trouble, not only because of the revolution in France, but also for its internal bankruptcy, corruption, and loose morals. It seemed that Demarco was passing away together with a whole age.\n\nHe died at Cospicua, his home-town, on August 13, 1793, and was buried at the parish church at Cospicua.\n\nDemarco's published works are just a handful. They are the following. While the latter three are of some interest to philosophy, the first is of a medical interest only.\n\n\nAll of Demarco's manuscripts are held at the National Library of Malta in Valletta, and still in their manuscript form. Though some interest in the man's activities and intellectual endeavours had always been kept alive amongst academics, little serious effort had ever been made to bring his scientific and philosophical accomplishments fully out in the open. The ones commented upon here are solely those which retain some philosophical interest. Of course, from a medical point of view all of his works would be relevant and worthy of thorough comprehension.\n\nAll manuscripts are written in Demarco's typical minuscule, crammed and barely legible handwriting, which of course makes reading, transliteration, translation and study immensely difficult. This is one of the most pertinent reasons, amongst others, for which Demarco's intellectual enterprise remains unexplored completely unto this day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following manuscripts are not considered to have any philosophical purport. Of course, they might have significant medical relevance. Nevertheless, as such they do not concern the main interest of this page. They are thus remained without comment or analysis.\n\n\n\nAs those immediately above, these manuscripts do not command any direct philosophical interest. Despite their medical relevance, they are left without comment here since they do not concern the objective of this page.\n\n\n\nJoseph Demarco has rarely been considered holistically. Medical academics have concentrated on some of his works which deal with health issues, philosophers have focused on works which have philosophical significance, and classicists have directed their attention to one or two of his works which offer interesting Latin features. Notwithstanding, no comprehensive and wide-ranging study of the man, his times and his accomplishments has ever been made. This is direly wanting.\n\nAs seen above, the larger part of Demarco's works are still in manuscript form, and this makes them impossible to be studied. Though the outlines of some of his work are generally identified and acknowledged, the greater number of his compositions remain unfamiliar and shrouded in obscurity.\n\nWith regard to philosophy in particular, a systematic and critical study of Demarco is still to be done. In general, it cannot be said that his philosophy is known at all, not even in general. This must necessarily entail arduous of transliteration and translation which might well be daunting. Nevertheless, it seems that Demarco certainly merits such attention and consideration.\n\n\n\nPhilosophy in Malta\n"}

The concept is put forward and explored by philosopher and media critic Pierre Lévy in his 1997 book \"Collective Intelligence\".\n\nLevy's notion of the \"knowledge space\" relies on his conception of anthropological spaces, which he defines as \"a system of proximity (space) unique to the world of humanity (anthropological), and thus dependent on human technologies, significations, language, culture, conventions, representations, and emotions\" (5). Building on the language of the philosophers Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, he states that \"anthropological spaces in themselves are neither infrastructures nor superstructures but planes of existence, frequencies, velocities, determined within the social spectrum\" (147). Each space contains \"worlds of signification\" (149) by which humans come to understand and make sense of the world. Furthermore, although one space may dominate, many spaces can and do exist simultaneously.\n\nLevy describes three existing anthropological spaces. They are:\n\nThe knowledge space is an emerging anthropological space which, while it has always existed (139), is only now coming into fruition as a guiding space of humanity. In this space, singularities (individuals) are recognized as singularities and knowledge becomes the guiding value for humanity. Since all human experience represents unique knowledge, within the knowledge space all individuals are valued for their unique knowledge regardless of race (earth space), nationality (territorial space), or economic status (commodity space). Within this space static identity gives way to the \"quantum identities\" as individuals become participates and the distinction between of \"us\" and \"them\" disappears (159). Instead, humanity forms \"collective intelligences\" in which knowledge is valued and freely traded. What is \"real\" becomes \"that which implies the practical activity, intellectual and imaginary, of living subjects\" (168). Life, experiences, and knowledge become the underlying and ever changing guiding path for human societies.\n\nLevy's theories rely heavily on the technological developments of the 1990s, particularly the rise of biotechnology, nanotechnology, the Internet, new media and information technologies. In chapter 3, he describes how technologies have made a shift from the molar to the molecular (a move which makes literal a distinction by Delueze and Guattari) in that technologies now handle units as individuals (his term is \"singularities\") rather than in mass. He suggests that this mirrors our rising recognition of the individuals as singularities rather than massive conglomerated groups.\n"}
{"id": "1411623", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1411623", "title": "Lev Shestov", "text": "Lev Shestov\n\nLev Isaakovich Shestov (, 1866 – 1938), born Yeguda Leib Shvartsman (), was a Russian existentialist philosopher, known for his \"philosophy of despair\". Born in Kyiv (Russian Empire) on , he emigrated to France in 1921, fleeing from the aftermath of the October Revolution. He lived in Paris until his death on November 19, 1938.\n\nShestov was born Lev Isaakovich Schwarzmann in Kiev into a Jewish family. He obtained an education at various places, due to fractious clashes with authority. He went on to study law and mathematics at the Moscow State University but after a clash with the Inspector of Students he was told to return to Kiev, where he completed his studies.\n\nShestov's dissertation prevented him from becoming a doctor of law, as it was dismissed on account of its revolutionary tendencies. In 1898 he entered a circle of prominent Russian intellectuals and artists which included Nikolai Berdyaev, Sergei Diaghilev, Dmitri Merezhkovsky and Vasily Rozanov. Shestov contributed articles to a journal the circle had established. During this time he completed his first major philosophical work, \"Good in the Teaching of Tolstoy and Nietzsche: Philosophy and Preaching\"; two authors profoundly impacting Shestov's thought.\n\nHe developed his thinking in a second book on Fyodor Dostoyevsky and Frederich Nietzsche, which increased Shestov's reputation as an original and incisive thinker. In \"All Things Are Possible\" (published in 1905) Shestov adopted the aphoristic style of Friedrich Nietzsche to investigate the difference between Russian and European Literature. Although on the surface it is an exploration of numerous intellectual topics, at its base it is a sardonic work of Existentialist philosophy which both criticizes and satirizes our fundamental attitudes towards life situations. D.H. Lawrence, who wrote the Foreword to S.S. Koteliansky's literary translation of the work, summarized Shestov's philosophy with the words: \" 'Everything is possible' - this is his really central cry. It is not nihilism. It is only a shaking free of the human psyche from old bonds. The positive central idea is that the human psyche, or soul, really believes in itself, and in nothing else\". Shestov deals with key issues such as religion, rationalism, and science in this highly approachable work, topics he would also examine in later writings such as \"In Job's Balances\". Shestov's own key quote from this work is probably the following: \"...we need to think that only one assertion has or can have any objective reality: that nothing on earth is impossible. Every time someone wants to force us to admit that there are other, more limited and limiting truths, we must resist with every means we can lay hands on\".\n\nShestov's works were not met with approval even by some of his closest Russian friends. Many saw in Shestov's work a renunciation of reason and metaphysics, and even an espousal of nihilism. Nevertheless, he would find admirers in such writers as D. H. Lawrence and his friend Georges Bataille.\n\nIn 1908 Shestov moved to Freiburg, Germany, and he stayed there until 1910, when he moved to a small Swiss village named Coppet. During this time the author worked prolifically. One of the fruits of these labours was the publication of \"Great Vigils\" and \"Penultimate Words\". He returned to Moscow in 1915, and in this year his son Sergei died in combat against the Germans. During the Moscow period, his work became more influenced by matters of religion and theology. The seizure of government by the Bolsheviks in 1917 made life difficult for Shestov, and the Marxists pressured him to write a defence of Marxist doctrine as an introduction to his new work, \"Potestas Clavium\"; otherwise it would not be published. Shestov refused this, yet with the permission of the authorities he lectured at the University of Kiev on Greek philosophy.\n\nShestov's dislike of the Soviet regime led him to undertake a long journey out of Russia, and he eventually ended up in France. The author was a popular figure in France, where his originality was quickly recognized. In Paris, he soon befriended, and much influenced, the young Georges Bataille. That this Russian was newly appreciated is attested by his having been asked to contribute to a prestigious French philosophy journal. In the interwar years, Shestov continued to develop into a thinker of great prominence. During this time he had become totally immersed in the study of such great theologians as Blaise Pascal and Plotinus, whilst at the same time lecturing at the Sorbonne in 1925. In 1926 he was introduced to Edmund Husserl, with whom he maintained a cordial relationship despite radical differences in their philosophical outlook. In 1929, during a return to Freiburg he met with Edmund Husserl, and was urged to study Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard.\n\nThe discovery of Kierkegaard prompted Shestov to realise that his philosophy shared great similarities, such as his rejection of idealism, and his belief that man can gain ultimate knowledge through ungrounded subjective thought rather than objective reason and verifiability. However, Shestov maintained that Kierkegaard did not pursue this line of thought far enough, and continued where he thought the Dane left off. The results of this tendency are seen in his work \"Kierkegaard and Existential Philosophy: Vox Clamantis in Deserto\", published in 1936, a fundamental work of Christian existentialism.\n\nDespite his weakening condition Shestov continued to write at a quick pace, and finally completed his magnum opus, \"Athens and Jerusalem\". This work examines the dichotomy between freedom and reason, and argues that reason be rejected in the discipline of philosophy. Furthermore, it adumbrates the means by which the scientific method has made philosophy and science irreconcilable, since science concerns itself with empirical observation, whereas (so Shestov argues) philosophy must be concerned with freedom, God and immortality, issues that cannot be solved by science.\n\nIn 1938, Shestov contracted a serious illness whilst at his vacation home. During this final period, he continued his studies, concentrating in particular on Indian philosophy as well as the works of his contemporary Edmund Husserl, who had died recently. Shestov himself died at a clinic in Paris.\n\nShestov's philosophy is, at first sight, not a philosophy at all: it offers no systematic unity, no coherent set of propositions, no theoretical explanation of philosophical problems. Most of Shestov's work is fragmentary. With regard to the form (he often used aphorisms) the style may be deemed more web-like than linear, and more explosive than argumentative. The author seems to contradict himself on every page, and even seeks out paradoxes. This is because he believes that life itself is, in the last analysis, deeply paradoxical, and not comprehensible through logical or rational inquiry. Shestov maintains that no theory can solve the mysteries of life. Fundamentally, his philosophy is not 'problem-solving', but problem-generating, with a pronounced emphasis on life's enigmatic qualities.\nHis point of departure is not a theory, or an idea, but an experience, the experience of despair, which Shestov describes as the loss of certainties, the loss of freedom, the loss of the meaning of life. The root of this despair is what he frequently calls 'Necessity', but also 'Reason', 'Idealism' or 'Fate': a certain way of thinking (but at the same time also a very real aspect of the world) that subordinates life to ideas, abstractions, generalisations and thereby kills it, through an ignoring of the uniqueness and livingness of reality.\n\n'Reason' is the obedience to and the acceptance of Certainties that tell us that certain things are eternal and unchangeable and other things are impossible and can never be attained. This accounts for Shestov's philosophy being a form of irrationalism, though it is important to note that the thinker does not oppose reason, or science in general, but only rationalism and scientism: the tendency to consider reason as a sort of omniscient, omnipotent God that is good for its own sake. It may also be considered a form of personalism: people cannot be reduced to ideas, social structures, or mystical oneness. Shestov rejects any mention of \"omnitudes\", \"collective\", \"all-unity.\" As he explains in his masterpiece \"Athens and Jerusalem\":\n\n\"\"But why attribute to God, the God whom neither time nor space limits, the same respect and love for order? Why forever speak of \"total unity\"? If God loves men, what need has He to subordinate men to His divine will and to deprive them of their own will, the most precious of the things He has bestowed upon them? There is no need at all. Consequently, the idea of total unity is an absolutely false idea...It is not forbidden for reason to speak of unity and even of unities, but it must renounce total unity - and other things besides. And what a sigh of relief men will breathe when they suddenly discover that the living God, the true God, in no way resembles Him whom reason has shown them until now!\"\"\n\nThrough this attack on the \"self-evident\", Shestov implies that we are all seemingly alone with our suffering, and can be helped neither by others, nor by philosophy. This explains his lack of a systematic philosophical framework.\n\nBut despair is not the last word, it is only the 'penultimate word'. The last word cannot be said in human language, can't be captured in theory. His philosophy begins with despair, his whole thinking \"is\" desperate, but Shestov tries to point to something \"beyond\" despair - and beyond philosophy.\n\nThis is what he calls 'faith': not a belief, not a certainty, but another way of thinking that arises in the midst of the deepest doubt and insecurity. It is the experience that \"everything is possible\" (Dostoevsky), that the opposite of Necessity is not chance or accident, but possibility, that there does exist a god-given freedom without boundaries, without walls or borders. Shestov maintains that we should continue to struggle, to fight against Fate and Necessity, even when a successful outcome is not guaranteed. Exactly at the moment that all the oracles remain silent, we should give ourselves over to God, who alone can comfort the sick and suffering soul. In some of his most famous words he explains:\n\n\"\"Faith, only the faith that looks to the Creator and that He inspires, radiates from itself the supreme and decisive truths condemning what is and what is not. Reality is transfigured. The heavens glorify the Lord. The prophets and apostles cry in ecstasy, \"O death, where is thy sting? Hell, where is thy victory?\" And all announce: \"Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love Him.\"\" (Quoting 1 Corinthians 15:55, 2:9)\n\nFurthermore, although a Jewish philosopher, Shestov saw in the resurrection of Christ this victory over necessity. He described the incarnation and resurrection of Jesus as a transfiguring spectacle by which it is demonstrated that the purpose of life is not \"mystical\" surrender to the \"absolute\", but ascetical struggle:\n\n\"Cur Deus homo? Why, to what purpose, did He become man, expose himself to injurious mistreatment, ignominious and painful death on the cross? Was it not in order to show man, through His example, that no decision is too hard, that it is worth while bearing anything in order not to remain in the womb of the One? That any torture whatever to the living being is better than the 'bliss' of the rest-satiate 'ideal' being?\"\n\nLikewise, the final words of his last and greatest work, \"Athens and Jerusalem\", are: \"Philosophy is not Besinnen [think over] but struggle. And this struggle has no end and will have no end. The kingdom of God, as it is written, is attained through violence.\" (cf Matthew 11:12)\n\nShestov was highly admired and honored by Nikolai Berdyaev and Sergei Bulgakov in Russia, Jules de Gaultier, Georges Bataille, Lucien Lévy-Bruhl, Paul Celan and Albert Camus in France, and D. H. Lawrence, Isaiah Berlin and John Middleton Murry in England. Among Jewish thinkers, he influenced Hillel Zeitlin.\n\nToday, Shestov is little known in the English-speaking world. This is partly because his works have not been readily available. Partly the specific themes he discusses are unfashionable and \"foreign\". A sombre and yet ecstatic atmosphere permeates his writings. And his quasi-nihilistic position and religious outlook are an unsettling and incongruous combination, at first sight.\n\nHe did however influence writers such as Albert Camus (who wrote about him in \"Le Mythe de Sisyphe\"), Benjamin Fondane (his 'pupil'), the poet Paul Celan, and notably Emil Cioran, who writes about Shestov:\n\nShestov also appears in the work of Gilles Deleuze; he is referred to sporadically in \"Nietzsche and Philosophy\" and also appears in \"Difference and Repetition\".\n\nMore recently, alongside Dostoyevsky's philosophy, many have found solace in Shestov's battle against the rational self-consistent and self-evident; for example Bernard Martin of Case Western Reserve University, who translated his works now found online [external link below]; and the scholar Liza Knapp, who wrote \"The Annihilation of Inertia: Dostoevsky and Metaphysics\". This book was an evaluation of Dostoyevsky's struggle against the self-evident \"wall\", and refers to Shestov on several occasions.\n\nAccording to Michael Richardson's research on Georges Bataille, Shestov was an early influence on Bataille and was responsible for exposing him to Nietzsche. He argues that Shestov's radical views on theology and an interest in extreme human behavior probably coloured Bataille's own thoughts.\n\nThese are Shestov's most important works, in their English translations, and with their date of \"writing\":\n\n\n\n"}

She worked in the areas of philosophy of language, political philosophy and aesthetics.\n\nMargaret MacDonald was born in London and abandoned as a child. She was educated at Birkbeck College, London and was awarded a first class degree in philosophy in 1932, followed by a PhD in 1934. Her PhD supervisor was Susan Stebbing and she provided MacDonald with financial assistance during her research.\n\nMacDonald joined Girton College, Cambridge, as a Pfeiffer Research Fellow in Moral Sciences between 1934–37. While at Cambridge, she studied under G.E. Moore and was part of the inner circle of students that Ludwig Wittgenstein taught. Along with fellow student Alice Ambrose she secretly (since he did not allow this) made notes during Wittgenstein's lectures, which were later published. They later convinced Wittgenstein to allow them continue to write his lectures down.\n\nFrom 1937–41 MacDonald taught philosophy at St Hilda's, Oxford, where she was also librarian. During the war she was temporary principal in the Board of Trade. This was followed by a lectureship at Bedford College, London. At this time, she was one of a very small number of women teaching philosophy outside of Oxford University. From 1947 she was also a lecturer on Ethics to staff at the Home Office. She became reader in philosophy at Bedford College in 1955.\n\nMacDonald's early articles were criticisms of the work of contemporary philosophers, however she later concentrated on aesthetics, particularly how language relates to art. She was also interested in political philosophy and published a significant article 'Natural Rights'. In this paper she argues against the idea that natural rights are founded on the natural law. Her view is summarised by Jonathan Wolf as: \"...statements of natural rights are akin to decisions, declaring ‘here I stand’, and...uses an analogy with another area of critical judgement—in her case literary appreciation—to point out the possibility of rational argument through the presentation of reasons\".\n\nHer work attracted substantial attention at the time. Two of her articles were reprinted in the Logic and Language (1951) series which included articles that were representative of current philosophical trends.\n\nMacDonald helped to found the philosophy journal \"Analysis\" together with Susan Stebbing, C.A. Mace and Gilbert Ryle in 1933. She was also the journal's editor from 1948 until 1956.\n\nShe died in London in 1956, following heart surgery, aged just 48.\n\n"}

{"id": "9521887", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9521887", "title": "Moral turpitude", "text": "Moral turpitude\n\nMoral turpitude is a legal concept in the United States and some other countries that refers to \"an act or behavior that gravely violates the sentiment or accepted standard of the community\". This term appears in U.S. immigration law beginning in the 19th century.\n\nThe concept of \"moral turpitude\" might escape precise definition, but it has been described as an \"act of baseness, vileness, or depravity in the private and social duties which a man owes to his fellowmen, or to society in general, contrary to the accepted and customary rule of right and duty between man and man.\"\n\nThe classification of a crime or other conduct as constituting moral turpitude has significance in several areas of law. First, prior conviction of a crime of moral turpitude (or in some jurisdictions, \"moral turpitude conduct\", even without a conviction) is considered to have a bearing on the honesty of a witness and might be used for purposes of the impeachment of witnesses. Second, offenses involving moral turpitude may be grounds to deny or revoke state professional licenses such as teaching credentials, licenses to practice law, or other licensed profession. Third, this concept is of great importance for immigration purposes in the United States, Canada (prior to 1976), and some other countries, since offenses which are defined as involving moral turpitude are considered bars to immigration into the U.S.\n\nA conviction for a crime involving moral turpitude (CIMT) causes a person to be inadmissible to the United States under section 212(a)(2)(a)(i) of the INA (Immigration and Nationality Act). There are petty offense exceptions to this rule, but these exceptions do not change the meaning of the question on the Visa Waiver Program or on the visa application form, and cannot be self-certified. A controlled substance violation causes the alien to be inadmissible to the United States under section 212(a)(2)(i)(II) of the INA. They are two different sections of the law. A controlled substance violation is a CIMT. The immigration administrative proceeding does not use a controlled substance violation as a CIMT. A visa waiver program applicant admissibility is determined at the port of entry and they are subject to section 212(a) and 217 of the INA.\n\nThe second question on document I-94W for those visiting the U.S. on the Visa Waiver Program asks:\n\nHave you ever been arrested or convicted for an offense or crime involving moral turpitude or a violation related to a controlled substance; or been arrested or convicted for two or more offenses for which the aggregate sentence to confinement was five years or more; or been controlled substance trafficker; or are you seeking entry to engage in criminal or immoral activities?\n\nLittle guidance is provided to the traveler as to which offenses are included in the definition. However, the Web site of the U.S. embassy in London states that:Travelers who have been arrested, even if the arrest did not result in a criminal conviction, those with criminal records, (the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act does not apply to U.S. visa law), certain serious communicable illnesses, those who have been refused admission into, or have been deported from, the United States, or have previously overstayed on the VWP are not eligible to travel visa free under the Visa Waiver Program.This appears to be at variance with the question on form I-94W and information supplied by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, as there are many offenses that are not considered to involve moral turpitude.\n\nA definition of moral turpitude is available for immigration purposes from the Foreign Affairs Manual, available on the United States Department of State website. and the government publishing office website (8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(2)(A)(i)).\n\nFor offenses (or arrests on suspicion of such offenses) occurring outside the U.S., the locally defined offense must be considered against the U.S. definitions, and in such cases it is the definition of the offense (as defined in the appropriate country) which is considered for immigration purposes, and not the circumstances of the individual's actual case.\n\nWhether a state law offense constitutes a crime involving moral turpitude for federal immigration purposes is decided on a statute by statute basis, because each state statute might cover a different range of behaviors, some of which may not necessarily involve moral turpitude under the Federal definition. For an example of a criminal statute that seems like it would categorically involve moral turpitude, but actually does not because the statute covers some behavior that does not involve moral turpitude, see the Ninth Circuit case Castrijon-Garcia v. Holder, No. 09-73756 (9th Cir. 2013) (simple kidnapping under California Penal Code § 207(a) is not a categorical crime involving moral turpitude).\n\n"}

Birner\", \"Mathias Palme\", \"Anton Skart\", \"Theodor Schwarz\", and \"Pantarhei\"; 16 May 1864 – 2 April 1937) was an Austrian writer and journalist, Jewish thinker and nationalist. His life had three main phases, representing a progression in his thinking: a Zionist phase (c. 1883 – c. 1900); a Jewish cultural autonomy phase (c. 1900 – c. 1914) which included the promotion of the Yiddish language; and religious phase (c. 1914–1937) when he turned to Orthodox Judaism and became staunchly anti-Zionist.\n\nHe married Rosa Korngut (1869–1934) and they had three sons: Solomon (Salomo) Birnbaum (1891–1989), Menachem Birnbaum (1893–1944), and Uriel Birnbaum (1894–1956).\n\nBirnbaum was born in Vienna into an Eastern European Jewish family with roots in Austrian Galicia and Hungary. His father, Menachem Mendel Birnbaum, a merchant, hailed from Ropshitz, Galicia, and his mother, Miriam Birnbaum (née Seelenfreund), who was born in northern Hungary (in a region sometimes called the Carpathian Rus), of a family with illustrious rabbinic lineage, had moved as a child to Tarnow, Galicia, where the two met and married.\n\nFrom 1882 to 1886, Birnbaum studied law, philosophy and Near Eastern studies at the University of Vienna.\n\nIn 1883, at the age of 19, he founded Kadimah, the first Jewish (Zionist) student association in Vienna, many years before Theodor Herzl became the leading spokesman of the Zionist movement. While still a student, he founded and published the periodical \"Selbstemanzipation!\", often written in large part by Birnbaum himself. In it he coined the terms \"Zionistic\", \"Zionist\", \"Zionism\" (1890), and \"political Zionism\" (1892).\n\nBirnbaum played a prominent part in the First Zionist Congress (1897) where he was elected Secretary-General of the Zionist Organization. He was associated with and was one of the most important representatives of the cultural, rather than political, side of Zionism. However, he left the Zionist Organization not long after the Congress. He was unhappy with its negative view of Diaspora Jewry and the transformation of the Zionist ideals into a party machine.\n\nHis next phase was to advocate Jewish cultural autonomy, or Golus nationalism, concentrating in particular on the Jews of eastern Europe. He advocated for the Jews to be recognized as a people among the other peoples of the empire, with Yiddish as their official language. He ran (in Buczacz, eastern Galicia) on behalf of the Jews (and with the support of the local Ukrainians) as candidate for the Austrian parliament. Although he had a majority of the votes, his election was thwarted by corruption of the electoral process by the local Polish faction.\n\nHe was chief convener of the Conference for the Yiddish Language held in Czernowitz, August 30 –September 3, 1908. It was the first Yiddish-language conference ever to take place. At the conference, he took the place of his colleague and fellow Yiddish activist Sholem Aleichem who was critically ill.\n\nFrom about 1912 onwards, Birnbaum became increasingly interested in Orthodox Judaism, and he became a fully observant Orthodox Jew in about 1916. He continued to act particularly as an advocate for the Jews of eastern Europe and the Yiddish language. From 1919 to 1922, he was General Secretary of the Agudas Yisroel, a widely-spread and influential Orthodox Jewish organization. He founded the society of the \"Olim\" (Hebrew for the \"Ascenders\"), a society with a specific program of action dedicated to the spiritual ascent of the Jewish people.\n\nBirnbaum, decrying political Zionism, 1919:\nAnd is it at all possible that we, who regard Judaism as our one and only treasure, should ever be able to compete with such expert demagogues and loud self-advertisers as they [the Zionists]? It is surely not necessary that we should. We are, after all, still the mountains and they the grain, and all we need to do is to gather all our forces in a world organization of religious Jews, and it will follow of itself, and without the application of any great political cunning on our part, that we shall have it in our power to prevent what must needs be prevented and to carry out what we have to carry out. But there is no need first to create this world organization of religious Jews. It is already in existence. The world knows its name, it is Agudas Yisroel [The Union of Israel].\n\nHe continued to write and lecture. His most well-known publication of this period of his life was \"Gottes Volk\", 1918 (German), \"God's Folk\", 1921 (Yiddish), translated into Hebrew as \"Am Hashem\" (1948), and translated into English under the title \"Confession\" (1946), slightly abridged.\n\nIn 1933, at the time of the Nazi rise to power, Birnbaum and his wife, together with their son Menachem (an artist) and family, who at that time were all living in Berlin, fled to Scheveningen, Netherlands, with the help of businessman and diplomat Henri B. van Leeuwen (1888-1973). There, Birnbaum, van Leeuwen, and banker Daniel Wolfe published the anti-Zionist newspaper \"Der Ruf\" (\"The Call\"). (Menachem and his family were murdered by the Nazis in 1944.) At the same time, their son Solomon (Professor of Yiddish and Hebrew paleography) and his family fled from Hamburg to England. Their other son, Uriel, an artist and poet, and his family fled from Vienna to the Netherlands in 1939. Van Leeuwen, also an Orthodox Jew, became a Dutch anti-Zionist leader and Bergen-Belsen survivor.\n\nBirnbaum died in Scheveningen in 1937 after a period of severe illness.\n\n\n\n\nAn essay on Nathan Birnbaum's activities within Orthodox Judaism - including information on the Olim (\"Ascenders\") - may be found at: \"Der Aufstieg\": Dr. Nathan Birnbaum ZT\"L, Ascent and Agudah By Rabbi Yosef Gavriel Bechhofer.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "677909", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=677909", "title": "New Life Movement", "text": "New Life Movement\n\nThe New Life Movement () was a government-led civic movement in 1930s China to promote cultural reform and Neo-Confucian social morality and to ultimately unite China under a centralised ideology following the emergence of ideological challenges to the status quo. Chiang Kai-shek as head of the government and the Chinese Nationalist Party launched the initiative on 19 February 1934 as part of an anti-Communist campaign, and soon enlarged the campaign to target the whole nation.\n\nChiang and his wife, Soong Mei-ling, who played a major role in the campaign, advocated a life guided by four virtues, \"lǐ\" (禮/礼, proper rite), \"yì\" (義/义, righteousness or justice), \"lián\" (廉, honesty and cleanness) and \"chǐ\" (恥/耻, shame; sense of right and wrong). The campaign proceeded with help of the Blue Shirts Society and the CC Clique within the Nationalist Party, and Christian missionaries in China.\n\nThe New Life Movement was founded at a time when China, already weakened by Western imperialism, faced the threats of rising Japanese militarism, domestic factionalism and communism. The launch of the New Life Movement was set in the context the Chiangs' growing concern with corruption, and moral decadence that they blamed on foreign influences. Historian Colin Mackerras writes that “Corruption was an abiding feature of Chiang Kai-shek’s rule\" and that nepotism and bribery were rife among the bureaucracy. Chiang charged that “If we do not weed the present body of corruption, bribery, perfunctoriness, and ignorance, and establish instead a clean, effective administration, the day will soon come when the revolution will be started against us as we did the Manchus”.\n\nChiang further claimed that the life of a Chinese man could be summarised with words such as “hedonism”, to signify his unprincipled and controlled pursuit of pleasure; “laziness” to represent his negligence and carelessness; as well as “unbearable filthiness” in every aspect of his life. Chiang's political rival, Wang Ching-wei described Chinese life as a life of \"smoking,\" \"sickness,\" \"gambling,\" \"filth,\" \"ghosts\" (i.e., superstition), and \"indolence”. Wang argued the fundamental psychological basis of such behaviour was \"lackadaisicalness\" (\"suibian zhuyi\") and \"self seekingness\" (\"zili zhuyi\"). He contended that “lackadaisicalness” led to lives without a sense of right or wrong, and hence with no distinctions or purpose. \"Self-seekingness,\" he argued, led to the rejection of all outside interference with this kind of behaviour as encroachment on \"freedom\". There was no consideration for others and their rights, only of one's own comfort, inevitably obstructing social life and group solidarity.\n\nIn Chiang's mind, these concerns were compounded by the influx of foreign ideas following the New Culture Movement and May Fourth Movement which fostered Western concepts such as liberalism, pragmatism and nationalism as well as more radical ideas including Marxism respectively. The Movement attempted to counter such threats through a resurrection of traditional Chinese morality, which it held to be superior to modern Western values. As such the Movement was based upon Confucianism, mixed with Christianity, nationalism and authoritarianism that have some similarities to fascism. It rejected individualism and liberalism, while also opposing socialism and communism.\n\nSoong Mei-ling called for a program of spiritual enlightenment. She wrote in\"Forum\", an American magazine, in 1935, that \"the mere accumulation of great wealth is not sufficient to enable China to resume her position as a great nation.\" There must be, she continued, \"also revival of the spirit, since spiritual values transcend mere material riches. She played a major role both in launching the Movement and in representing its public face.\n\nChiang Kai-shek used the Confucian and Methodist notion of self-cultivation and correct living for the Movement; to this end it prescribed proper etiquette on every aspect of daily life. He considered the New Life Movement a key part of the program to carry out the \"principle of the people's livelihood\" in Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People. However implementing the Movement was suspended indefinitely in the approach to the Second Sino-Japanese War.\n\nChiang Kai-shek’s September 1934 speech stated that the New Life Movement aimed at the \"promotion of a regular life guided by the four virtues,\" – 'Lǐ' (proper rite), \"Yì' (righteousness or justice), \"lián \"(honesty and cleanness) \"and chǐ\" (shame; sense of right and wrong)\". These virtues, he went on,\n\nChiang later extended the four virtues to eight by the addition of “Promptness”, “Precision,” “Harmoniousness,” and “Dignity”. These elements were summarized in two basic forms: “cleanliness” and “discipline” and were viewed as the first step in achieving a “new life”. People were encouraged to engage in modern polite behaviour, such as not to spit, urinate or sneeze in public. They were encouraged to adopt good table manners such as not making noises when eating.\n\nThe ideological strictness of the New Life Movement had many similarities with Neo-Confucianism, which had been the dominating moral philosophy of the previous centuries. The New life Movement “four virtues” were taken from Confucian school of thought. Paul Linebarger had stated that “its [the New Life Movement’s] principles consist of a simple restatement of the cardinal Confucian personal virtues, interpreted to suit modern conditions.”\n\nThe historian Lloyd Eastman saw Chiang’s goal as unifying China under a singular ideology, a fascist one at that, with the resulting New Life Movement being a popularized or a “sloganized Confucianism”. According to Keith Schoppa, the new set of beliefs was seen to be easy to execute, with four main virtues backed by 95 further sub-rules that regulated the everyday life of the regular Chinese  citizen.\n\nThe Movement was also shaped by Chiang's Christianity. According to Elmer Clark, the new doctrine was “an ambitious moral and ethical enterprise which proposed nothing less than a Chinese renaissance, a complete reformation of the habits, customs and manners of one fourth of the human race, to bring them more in line with the accepted morals of Christian civilisation”. Overlapping moral guidelines exist between Confucianism and Christianity. The 95 rules placed in the New Life movement often blur the lines between the influence of the two on the Movement, such as “do not gamble” or “be polite and courteous to women and children”.\n\nThere is a totalitarian aspect to the Movement. Dirlik sees the movement as a \"modern counterrevolution\" opposed to an \"anti-revolutionary conservatism\" due to the fact that it instrumentalised traditional moral codes and societal constructs. Other historians regard this movement as imitating German Fascism and being a neo-nationalistic movement used to elevate Chiang's control of everyday lives. Frederic Wakeman suggested that the New Life Movement was \"Confucian fascism\".\n\nDespite the grandiose goal of revitalising and revolutionising China, the New Life Movement ultimately ended in failure as both domestic and foreign reception remained paltry throughout the duration of the movement. The combination of the movement’s inability to formulate a systematic ideology and the seeming banality of its concerns caused both Chinese and foreign commentators to ignore the significance of New Life ideology and intentions and instead to stress the more superficial aspects of the movement. Consequently, the movement was approached variously as a joke, or to those taking it more seriously, a shallow and antiquated regression to Chinese tradition when tradition had already proved incapable of solving China’s problems.\n\nThe Movement’s inability to formulate a systematic ideology and abstract code of ethics contrasted sharply with the promises of the Communists, who spoke sharply and to the point on taxation, distribution of land and the disposition of overlords. From the perspective of a Chinese citizen, the policies of Marxists are far more practical and coherent, leading to the lack of significance attributed to the New Life Movement. On a Western perspective, Chiang’s complex code of ethics was far too abstract and lacking in action to be useful or pragmatic, perceived as being superficial and inordinately idealistic.  \n\nThe lack of popular domestic reception is exacerbated by the behaviour of the Blue Shirts, a far-right fascist group that enforced the rules of the New Life Movement. Historian Sterling Seagrave writes “by 1936, the Blue Shirts were running amok, driven by excesses of zeal and brutality, giving the New Life Movement a bad name. The Literary Digest observed that year, ‘Most likely to upset the teacups were Chiang’s own civilian, anti-foreign, bombing, stabbing, shooting ‘Blue Shirt’ terrorists, who once useful, now unmanageable, have become something of a Frankenstein monster.” The association of the violent and repressive behaviour of the Blue Shirts compounded the less than enthusiastic reception of the Movement, further attributing to it a negative reputation as well.\n\nThe New Life Movement aimed to control Chinese lifestyles. Some measures and moral codes included: opposition to littering and spitting at random; opposition to opium use; opposition to conspicuous consumption; rejection of immoral entertainment in favour of artistic and athletic pursuits; courteous behaviour; saluting the flag. Chiang urged citizens to bathe with cold water, since the (supposed) Japanese habit of washing their faces with cold water was a sign of their military strength.\n\nChiang relied on government law enforcement to reinforce moral behaviour. Task forces were created in different regions to implement the movement, yet, in reports from some districts on the implementation, the movement was seen to be severely underfunded, understaffed and poorly understood by law enforcement officials.\n\nThe Blue Shirts were also instrumental in the implementation of the New Life movement. The neo-right wing group at first, was useful to Chiang, correcting the behaviour of those not following the four virtues and the further 95 rules placed. However, they soon turned to force to reinforce Chiang's ideals, giving bad publicity and views on the movement. The excessive violence used by the Blue Shirts encompassed the movement, leading to a reluctant public in following the new dogma in place by the KMT.\n\nIn the words of Soong Mei-ling's biographer, the New Life Movement was a \"curious East-West ideological fusion of neo-Confucian precepts, thinly disguised, New Testament Christianity, YMCA-Style social activism, elements of Bushido—the samurai code—and European fascism, along with a generous dose of New England Puritanism.\" Arif Dirlik explains the Movement as motivated by the need to counter Communist success in both ideological appeal and political organization. \n\nXinsheng Road, a major arterial road in Taipei is named after the movement.\n\n\n"}

Schreck is also the lead singer of the musical duo Kingdom of Heaven, whose album \"XXIII\" was released in April 2015. He has collaborated musically with his wife, American singer and musician Zeena Schreck, Australian percussionist John Murphy, NON, Death in June, and the British actor Christopher Lee whose first album Schreck conceived of and produced. As a solo artist, his song \"Lord Sutekh's Dream\" was released by German record label The Epicurean in conjunction with Schreck's May 28, 2016 concert at the Epicurean Escapism Festival in Berlin. Since that concert Schreck has recorded and performed with his band consisting of Winfried Strauss (keyboards), Ohnesorg (bass), and Heathen Rae (drums and percussion.) After a performance at Wave-Gotik-Treffen in Leipzig noted as one of the best concerts at the WGT by German music site der Schwarze Welt , Schreck and his band released the vinyl EP The Futura Model on The Epicurean label .

He directed the documentary \"Charles Manson Superstar\" and has appeared in several other documentaries and films. \n\nBefore his 2003 conversion to Tantric Buddhism, and his earlier renunciation of Satanism, Schreck was a prominent black magician who co-led the magical school The Werewolf Order with Zeena from 1988-1999. He worked closely in the late 1980s with Church of Satan founder Anton LaVey, although he was not a member of the Church. Schreck was a Master of the Temple of Set before resigning with several others in 2002 due to religious and administrative differences. In 2002, Schreck was one of the founding members of the Sethian Liberation Movement (formerly the Storm) which is currently located in Berlin.\n\nAccording to his Facebook page, Nikolas Schreck's band Kingdom of Heaven will perform a concert at the Wave-Gotik-Treffen music festival in Leipzig, Germany on May 22, 2015. Kingdom of Heaven's first album \"XXIII\" was released on iTunes and Amazon on 10 April 2015.\n\nNikolas Schreck performed live in Germany for the first time since 1992 in a sonic ritual concert entitled In Her Thrall: Evokation des Ewig-Weiblichen at Tower Transmissions Music Festival IV in Dresden on 27 September 2014, collaborating with noted percussionist John Murphy. A documentary concert film of the concert, also entitled \"In Her Thrall\" was photographed by Boa Thor and released via Schreck's World Operations. Schreck's song \"O, A Weird Flower!\" from this concert was released on the Epicurean label CD \"All My Sins Remembered - The Sonic Worlds of John Murphy\" in June 2016. Since then, he has recorded and performed with his band consisting of Winfried Strauss (keyboards), Ohnesorg (bass) and Heathen Rae (drums and percussion) with whom he recorded the vinyl EP The Futura Model, released in October 2017. \n\nIn 2014, Schreck taught a public class \"Sonic Magic in Theory and Praxis: A Two-Day Workshop for Magicians and Musicians\" at the NK Projekt in Berlin, Germany, which was described as \"a rare two-day course in the magical art of applying ritual magic, consciousness alteration and spiritual initiation to music\". He has taught subsequent lectures on sonic magic in Leipzig's Black Whitsun event in June 2017 and in Berlin in October 2017 \n\nOn January 17 2018 Schreck is scheduled to deliver a LDN lecture in London entitled \"The Charles Manson Conspiracy\" \n\nIn 2012, Nikolas Schreck (vocalist/lyricist) and James Collord (bassist/multi-instrumentalist) founded their musical collaboration Kingdom of Heaven (KOH) whose songs \"In Dreamland\" and \"Midnight in Cairo\" were premiered on a Nightwatch Radio interview in November 2013.\n\nKingdom of Heaven's first single \"The Ballad of Lurleen Tyler\" was made available via iTunes in December 2013, followed in March 2014 by a video for the song on the Kingdom of Heaven YouTube channel.\n\nIn May 2014, Nikolas Schreck was interviewed on the Green Tea Berlin radio program broadcast by Alex Radio and 88.4 Berlin which featured the European radio premiere of Kingdom of Heaven's song \"Enemy on Both Sides\", which Schreck introduced as the \"theme to a non-existent James Bond movie\"\n\nIn March 2015, Schreck's Facebook page announced that Kingdom of Heaven would perform a concert at the Wave-Gotik-Treffen music festival in Leipzig Germany on May 22, 2015.\n\nHe has since then recorded and performed with his band consisting of Winfried Strauss (keyboards), Ohnesorg (bass) and Heathen Rae (drums and percussion) with whom he recorded the vinyl EP The Futura Model, released in October 2017. \n\nSchreck founded the band Radio Werewolf in 1984. His theatrical ritual performances as the group's lead singer, billed as Rallies of the Radio Werewolf Youth Party, provoked controversy, as did provocative appearances on several television programs. Tension over the contentious nature of the band's music led to the departure of co-founder Evil Wilhelm from Radio Werewolf shortly after their participation in the notorious 8-8-88 Rally in San Francisco. Although there was hostility during the breakup, the band members later reconciled. Schreck's 1989 LP \"The Fiery Summons\" was the first Radio Werewolf album, although the previous formation recorded a still unreleased album in 1987.\n\nKey to the bands beliefs about themselves was the existence of what they termed the \"dominant frequency\" or \"alpha frequency.\" Schreck explained the band by saying \"Radio Werewolf is a sound, a vibration, a certain frequency from another world. I just transmitted it. The bodies and minds of all the people who tuned into that frequency were the mediums that broadcast came through on. I only get credit for ”creating” it because I have a big mouth, I was in the front of the stage, and I was the one the media paid the most attention to.\"\n\nZeena Schreck served as Radio Werewolf co-director from 1988-1993, the group's most prolific period, which saw the release of their recordings \"Songs for the End of the World\", \"The Lightning and the Sun\", \"Bring Me the Head of Geraldo Rivera!\", \"Witchcraft-Boots: A Tribute to the Sinatras \" and \"Love Conquers All\".\n\nIn 2012, Radio Werewolf's \"The Vinyl Solution - Analog Artifacts, Ritual Instrumentals and Undercover Versions\" was released by World Operations. The compact disc, the first official Radio Werewolf release since 1992, compiles newly remastered re-releases of 12 ambient sonic magic tracks from Zeena and Nikolas Schreck's rare Radio Werewolf vinyl recordings between 1989-1992 as well as 2 bonus tracks never previously released to the public.\n\nSchreck's 1989 documentary, \"Charles Manson Superstar\", told the story of Charles Manson's life as well as interviewing him in San Quentin Prison. The documentary featured parts of an originally hour and a half long interview of Manson, as well as many photographs and video footage, of the Manson Family, Spahn Ranch, and other related topics. Also discussed were Manson's alleged ties to Nazi movements (which he denied) and to various Satanic movements. Other Video Werewolf releases include \"The Zurich Experiment\", which documented Radio Werewolf's last public concert.\n\nSchreck's \"The Manson File\" (1988) is a thorough study of the philosophy, music and spiritual ideas of Charles Manson. The book brings Manson's previously obscure ATWA ecology concept and his religious devotion to the Gnostic god Abraxas to public attention. Schreck posited that the demonization of Manson (and perhaps the martyrdom of Manson by other groups) is the result of media sensationalism.\n\nIn April 2011, Schreck's \"The Manson File: Myth and Reality of an Outlaw Shaman\", a new and greatly expanded edition of over 900 pages was released in France as \"Le Dossier Manson : Mythe Et Réalité D’un Chaman Hors-La-Loi\". Schreck delves deeply into previously unknown aspects of Manson's life and the Tate-La Bianca murders to present evidence that the \"Helter Skelter\" theory put forth by prosecuting attorney Vincent Bugliosi had little if anything to do with the reality of the crimes. According to Schreck, the murders of Sharon Tate and the others actually resulted from conventional underworld rivalries between drug dealer associates Charles Watson and Jay Sebring, who Schreck contends was linked to the Mafia.\n\nAs of August 2011, the new version of Schreck's book became available in English format, on his personal website. A mass market edition was published in December 2011. Leading alternative culture source \"Metal Impact\" praised \"The Manson File\", congratulating it on its comprehensive view of the subject, and for taking an academic stance, rather than the sensationalism of Vincent Bugliosi's \"Helter Skelter\".\n\nSchreck's \"Flowers From Hell: A Satanic Reader\" was released in 2001. The book detailed the history of the use of Satan as a symbol, archetype, and deity in fiction throughout history, from ancient to modern times, and through several different cultures.\n\n\"The Satanic Screen: An Illustrated Guide to the Devil in Cinema\" was also released in 2001. The book revealed a detailed study of the use of the devil (in all his various forms) in film media throughout its existence. In an interview with American Movie Classics, Schreck noted that: \"I think people's ideas of the devil and of Satan in the 20th century have largely been shaped and dictated by imagery from the cinema. I've studied the black arts in history and practice for many decades, and I found that Satanism had been looked at in terms of literature and music but never in terms of cinema.\"\n\nIn \"Demons of the Flesh: The Complete Guide to Left Hand Path Sex Magic\", released in 2002, Schreck and his wife Zeena explored the theory, history and practice of erotic sorcery and worship of the feminine in all of the world's religions. Presented as a ritual fusing of male and female, the book refutes common Western Satanic misconceptions of the left hand path by tracing its origins in Tantric Hinduism and Buddhism, and presents a crash course of magical exercises based on the Schrecks' own experiences as practitioners of what they term the sinister current.\n\nSchreck was interviewed for the book \"Mythos Wewelsburg: Fakten und Legenden,\" about his relation to the Wewelsburg castle.\n\n"}

{"id": "39838047", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39838047", "title": "Padamu Jua", "text": "Padamu Jua\n\n\"Padamoe Djoea\" (Republican Spelling: \"Padamu Djua\"; Perfected Spelling: \"Padamu Jua\"; Indonesian for \"To You Alone\") is a 28-line poem by Amir Hamzah which was included in his 1937 collection \"Nyanyi Sunyi\". Hamzah's best-praised work, readings have generally focused on religious themes – mainly from an Islamic perspective, although Christian influences have been suggested.\n\n\"Padamu Jua\" was written by Amir Hamzah, a Langkat-born Malay writer who studied in Dutch schools. The poem is not dated (indeed, none of Hamzah's works are) Poet Laurens Koster Bohang considers \"Padamu Jua\" to have been written between 1933 and 1937, while Dutch scholar of Indonesian literature A. Teeuw dates it to 1936/1937. The time was one of great emotional turmoil for Hamzah, who was required to marry the daughter of the Sultan of Langkat, who had funded his studies in Java. At the time Hamzah had reportedly fallen in love with a Javanese woman while studying, and was forced to leave her.\n\nThe 28-line poem consists of 84 words. It is dominated by the vowels \"a\" and \"u\", which are often repeated either as the diphthong \"au\" or the hiatus \"ua\"; such combinations occur in 35 per cent of the words and 64 per cent of the lines. Consonants are often repeated, emphasising the interconnection between different words in a line.\n\nIndonesian literary critic Zuber Usman writes that the poem describes a meeting between Amir Hamzah and God, depicted either as a meeting between lovers or between a servant and his Lord. He writes that the first two lines depict Hamzah's feelings after he was told that he was to be married, how all his hopes for the future were destroyed by the announcement. The next couplet depicts a return to God and Islam, a religion which Hamzah had followed devoutly as a child. The following four lines Usman reads as depicting the light of God, an answer to the emptiness which Hamzah faces. Hamzah diverts his physical love and disappointment over worldly issues, but soon feels disappointed, as if God is toying with him, as if in a fit of jealousy God will not allow him to have his true love. Ultimately he is unable to abandon God, and returns, surrendering himself to a God who hovers \"between clarity and fogginess\" However, he must wait – alone – for God to return. Australian critic of Indonesian literature Keith Foulcher gives a similar reading, while Jassin reads the poem as a statement that Hamzah would like to meet God.\n\nDocumentarian HB Jassin writes that critics, such as Bakri Siregar, have seen an influence of the Christian God, as depicted in the Bible. He indicates several aspects of the poem that would seem to support such a view, including the depiction of an anthropomorphic God (not allowed in orthodox Islam) and the idea of a jealous God. He writes that the concept of a jealous God is not found in Islam, but is in the Bible, citing and . Jassin, however, attributes this to artistic license, while Foulcher attributes it to a dynamic and unstable God.\n\n\"Padamu Jua\" was first published in the November 1937 issue of \"Poedjangga Baroe\", a literary magazine which Hamzah had helped establish, together with the rest of \"Nyanyi Sunyi\". It was later published as the first titled poem in a standalone book; the collection had seen its third printing by 1949. An English translation by Sutan Takdir Alisjahbana, Sabina Thornton, and Burton Raffel was published in 1967. \"Padamu Jua\" has been used in several school books for teaching Indonesian at senior high school levels.\n\n\"Padamu Jua\" is Hamzah's best-praised work. Dutch scholar of Indonesian literature A. Teeuw described the poem as most valuable, with \"the most direct, most powerful, most exact, and most period-appropriate formulation of the relationship between God and humans\".\n\n"}
{"id": "12857474", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12857474", "title": "Paradoxes of material implication", "text": "Paradoxes of material implication\n\nThe paradoxes of material implication are a group of formulae that are truths of classical logic but are intuitively problematic.\n\nThe root of the paradoxes lies in a mismatch between the interpretation of the validity of logical implication in natural language, and its formal interpretation in classical logic, dating back to George Boole's algebraic logic. In classical logic, implication describes conditional if-then statements using a truth-functional interpretation, i.e. \"p implies q\" is defined to be \"it is not the case that p is true and q false\". Also, \"p implies q\" is equivalent to \"p is false or q is true\". For example, \"if it is raining, then I will bring an umbrella\", is equivalent to \"it is not raining, or I will bring an umbrella, or both\". This truth-functional interpretation of implication is called material implication or material conditional.\n\nThe paradoxes are logical statements which are true but whose truth is intuitively surprising to people who are not familiar with them. If the terms 'p', 'q' and 'r' stand for arbitrary propositions then the main paradoxes are given formally as follows:\n\nThe paradoxes of material implication arise because of the truth-functional definition of material implication, which is said to be true merely because the antecedent is false or the consequent is true. By this criterion, \"If the moon is made of green cheese, then the world is coming to an end,\" is true merely because the moon isn't made of green cheese. By extension, any contradiction implies anything whatsoever, since a contradiction is never true. (All paraconsistent logics must, by definition, reject (1) as invalid.) Also, any tautology is implied by anything whatsoever, since a tautology is always true.\n\nTo sum up, although it is deceptively similar to what we mean by \"logically follows\" in ordinary usage, material implication does not capture the meaning of \"if... then\".\n\nAs the best known of the paradoxes, and most formally simple, the paradox of entailment makes the best introduction.\n\nIn natural language, an instance of the paradox of entailment arises:\nAnd\nTherefore\n\nThis arises from the principle of explosion, a law of classical logic stating that inconsistent premises always make an argument valid; that is, inconsistent premises imply any conclusion at all. This seems paradoxical because although the above is a logically valid argument, it is not sound (not all of its premises are true).\n\nValidity is defined in classical logic as follows: \n\nFor example a valid argument might run:\n\nIn this example there is no possible situation in which the premises are true while the conclusion is false. Since there is no counterexample, the argument is valid.\n\nBut one could construct an argument in which the premises are inconsistent. This would satisfy the test for a valid argument since there would be \"no possible situation in which all the premises are true\" and therefore \"no possible situation in which all the premises are true and the conclusion is false\".\n\nFor example an argument with inconsistent premises might run:\n\nAs there is no possible situation where both premises could be true, then there is certainly no possible situation in which the premises could be true while the conclusion was false. So the argument is valid whatever the conclusion is; inconsistent premises imply all conclusions.\n\nThe strangeness of the paradox of entailment comes from the fact that the definition of validity in classical logic does not always agree with the use of the term in ordinary language. In everyday use \"validity\" suggests that the premises are consistent. In classical logic, the additional notion of \"soundness\" is introduced. A sound argument is a valid argument with all true premises. Hence a valid argument with an inconsistent set of premises can never be sound. A suggested improvement to the notion of logical validity to eliminate this paradox is relevant logic.\n\nThe classical paradox formulae are closely tied to the formula,\n\n\nthe principle of Simplification, which can be derived from the paradox formulae rather easily (e.g. from (1) by Importation). \nIn addition, there are serious problems with trying to use material implication as representing the English \"if ... then ...\". For example, the following are valid inferences:\n\n\nbut mapping these back to English sentences using \"if\" gives paradoxes. The first might be read \"If John is in London then he is in England, and if he is in Paris then he is in France. Therefore, it is either true that (a) if John is in London then he is in France, or (b) that if he is in Paris then he is in England.\" Using material implication, if John really is in London, then (since he is not in Paris) (b) is true; whereas if he is in Paris, then (a) is true. Since he cannot be in both places, the conclusion that at least one of (a) or (b) is true is valid.\n\nBut this does not match how \"if ... then ...\" is used in natural language: the most likely scenario in which one would say \"If John is in London then he is in England\" is if one \"does not know\" where John is, but nonetheless knows that \"if\" he is in London, he is in England. Under this interpretation, both premises are true, but both clauses of the conclusion are false.\n\nThe second example can be read \"If both switch A and switch B are closed, then the light is on. Therefore, it is either true that if switch A is closed, the light is on, or that if switch B is closed, the light is on.\" Here, the most likely natural-language interpretation of the \"if ... then ...\" statements would be \"\"whenever\" switch A is closed, the light is on\", and \"\"whenever\" switch B is closed, the light is on\". Again, under this interpretation both clauses of the conclusion may be false (for instance in a series circuit, with a light that only comes on when \"both\" switches are closed).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "19495521", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19495521", "title": "Principle of individuation", "text": "Principle of individuation\n\nThe principle of individuation is a criterion that individuates or numerically distinguishes the members of the kind for which it is given, that is by which we can supposedly determine, regarding any kind of thing, when we have more than one of them or not. It is also known as a 'criterion of identity' or 'indiscernibility principle'. The history of the consideration of such a principle begins with Aristotle. It was much discussed by the medieval philosopher Duns Scotus (c. 1266–1308) with his \"haecceity\" and later, during Renaissance, by Francisco Suárez (1548–1617), Bonaventure Baron (1610–1696) and Leibniz (1646–1716). \n\nTaking issue with the view expressed in certain Platonic dialogues that universal Forms (such as the Good, the Just, the Triangular and so on) constitute reality, Aristotle (384–322 BC) regarded an individual as something real in itself. An individual therefore has two kinds of unity: specific and numerical. Specific unity (that is unity of the species to which an individual belongs) is a unity of nature which the individual shares with other individuals. For example, twin daughters are both human females, and share a unity of nature. This specific unity, according to Aristotle, is derived from Form, for it is form (which the medieval philosophers called quiddity) which makes an individual substance the kind of thing it is. But two individuals (such as the twins) can share exactly the same form, yet not be one in number. What is the principle by which two individuals differ in number alone? This cannot be a common property. As Bonaventure later argued, there is no form of which we cannot imagine a similar one, thus there can be 'identical' twins, triplets, quadruplets and so on. For any such form would then be common to several things, and therefore not an individual at all. What is the criterion for a thing being an individual?\n\nIn a passage much-quoted by the medievals, Aristotle attributes the cause of individuation to matter:\n\nThe late Roman philosopher Boethius (480–524) touches upon the subject in his Isagoge, where he says that things which are individuals and are discrete only in number, differ only by accidental properties. The Persian philosopher Avicenna (980-1037) first introduced a term which was later translated into Latin as \"signatum\", meaning 'determinate individual'. Avicenna argues that a nature is not of itself individual, the relation between it and individuality is an accidental one, and we must look for its source not in its essence, but among accidental attributes such as quantity, quality, space and time. However, he did not work out any definite or detailed theory of individuation. His successor Averroes (1126–1198) argued that matter is numerically one, since it is undetermined in itself and has no definite boundaries. However, since it is divisible, this must be caused by quantity, and matter must therefore have the potential for determination in three dimensions (in the same way a rough and unhewn lump of marble has the potential to be sculpted into a statue).\n\nThe theories of Averroes and Avicenna had a great influence on the later theory of Thomas Aquinas (1224–1274). Aquinas never doubted the Aristotelian theory of individuation by matter, but was uncertain which of the theories of Avicenna or Averroes are correct. He first accepted the theory of Avicenna that the principle of individuation is matter designated (\"signata\") by determinate dimensions, but later abandoned this in favour of the Averroist theory that it is matter affected by unterminated dimension which is the principle. Later still, he seems to have returned to the first theory when he wrote the \"Quodlibeta\".\n\nGiles of Rome (1243–1316) believed that individuation happens by the quantity in the matter.\n\nDuns Scotus held that individuation comes from the numerical determination of form and matter whereby they become \"this\" form and \"this\" matter. Individuation is distinguished from a nature by means of a formal distinction on the side of the thing. Later followers of Scotus called this principle haecceity or 'thisness'. The nominalist philosopher William of Ockham (1287–1347) regarded the principle as unnecessary and indeed meaningless, since there are no realities independent of individual things. An individual is distinct of itself, not multiplied in a species, since species are not real (they correspond only to concepts in our mind). His contemporary Durandus held that individuation comes about through actual existence. Thus the common nature and the individual nature differ only as one conceived and one existing.\n\nThe late scholastic philosopher Francisco Suárez held, in opposition to Scotus, that the principle of individuation can only be logically distinguished from the individual being. Every being, even an incomplete one, is individual of itself, by reason of its being a thing. Suárez maintained that, although the humanity of Socrates does not differ from that of Plato, yet they do not constitute \"in reality\" one and the same humanity; there are as many \"formal unities\" (in this case, humanities) as there are individuals, and these individuals do not constitute a factual, but only an essential or ideal unity. The formal unity, however, is not an arbitrary creation of the mind, but exists in the nature of the thing before any operation of the understanding.\n\n\n\n"}

The term \"riḍā\" literally means 'the fact of being pleased or contented; contentment, approval'. In religious context, this term is interpreted as \"satisfaction\" or \"\"perfect contentment\" with God's will or decree\". It is also frequently given as a male first name in Shīʻa Muslim communities, however is it also a male name given in the Arab Christian community, and in the Druze community. Sometimes alternately spelled: \"Ridha\", after the eighth Shīʻa Imām, ʻAlī ibn Mūsā al-Riḍā (Ali ar-Ridha).\n\n\"Riḍā\" is often found rather vaguely within the English translation of the Qur'an, and in the life accounts of Sufi saints such as Rābiʻa al-ʻAdawiyya al-Qaysiyya (Rabia al-Adawiyya). According to Annemarie Schimmel, author of \"Mystical Dimensions of Islam\", \"riḍā is closely related to shukr, or gratitude\", another virtue within Islam.

She fell and broke her hand. She put her face on the ground and said,'I am a stranger without mother or father. I am captive and my hand is broken. None of this saddens me.

Tomorrow a grandeur will be yours such that the closes of the heavenly company will take pride in you.'\"\n\n\"She said, 'When he is as thankful for tribulation as he is for bliss.' \"\n\"They asked, 'When a sinner repents, does He accept him or not?' \"\n\"She said, 'How can he repent, unless the Lord gives him repentance and accepts him?

Carroll (born September 17, 1960) is an American evolutionary developmental biologist, author, educator and executive producer. He is the Allan Wilson Professor of Molecular Biology and Genetics at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. His studies focus on the evolution of cis-regulatory elements in the regulation of gene expression in the context of biological development, using \"Drosophila\" as a model system. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, of the American Philosophical Society (2007), of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Association for Advancement of Science, as well as a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator.\n\nCarroll was born in Toledo, Ohio. He has stated that, as a kid, he would flip over rocks looking for snakes, and at age 11 or 12, he started keeping snakes. This activity led him to notice the patterns on the snakes and wonder how those form. Carroll got his B.A. in Biology at Washington University in St. Louis, his Ph.D. in immunology from Tufts University and did post-doctoral work at the University of Colorado Boulder.\n\nCarroll is at the forefront of a field known as evolutionary developmental biology (also known as \"evo-devo\"), studying how gene changes control the evolution of body parts and patterns. He is the Allan Wilson Professor of Molecular Biology and Genetics at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, and an investigator for the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.\n\nIn 1987, Carroll set up a laboratory at the University of Wisconsin-Madison \"focused on understanding how genes get used in different ways to generate the diversity of form that we see\". The Laboratory of Cell and Molecular Biology lists Carroll's interests as \"Genetic control of body pattern in fruit flies, butterflies, and other animals\".\n\nCarroll's team has shown, in a series of papers, how the activation of genes during the embryonic stages of the \"Drosophila\" fruit fly control the development of its wings, and has been searching for the butterfly's counterparts of these genes.\n\nIn 1989, he received the Shaw Scientist Award from the Greater Milwaukee Foundation.\n\nIn 2006, Carroll was interviewed by PBS as part of the NOVA documentary \"The Family That Walks on All Fours\", about a family in Turkey that has members who walk on their hands and feet. In this interview, he discusses the possible genetic underpinnings of this family's condition.\n\nFrom September 2009 to March 2013, he wrote a column for \"The New York Times\" called \"Remarkable Creatures\", where he would discuss findings in animal evolution.\n\nIn 2010, he was named vice-president for science education of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. In 2011, the HHMI launched a documentary film initiative to produce science features for television, to which Carroll was appointed as one of the executive producers. In 2012, one such film, called \"The Day the Mesozoic Died\", retracing the investigation that led to the discovery of the asteroid collision that triggered the mass extinction at the end of that Era, was introduced by Carroll at a National Teacher's Conference.\n\nIn 2010, Carroll received the \"Stephen Jay Gould Prize\" from the Society for the Study of Evolution. In 2012, he was awarded the Benjamin Franklin Medal in Life Science from the Franklin Institute \"for proposing and demonstrating that the diversity and multiplicity of animal life is largely due to the different ways that the same genes are regulated rather than to mutation of the genes themselves.\" \nIn 2016, he was awarded the Lewis Thomas Prize at the Rockefeller University.\n\nCarroll is a proponent of the extended evolutionary synthesis.\n\nSince 2013, Carroll has been listed on the Advisory Council of the National Center for Science Education.\n\n\n\nScience writer Peter Forbes, writing in \"The Guardian\", calls \"Endless Forms Most Beautiful\" an \"essential book\" and its author \"both a distinguished scientist ... and one of our great science writers.\" In Forbes's view, in \"The Serengeti Rules\" Carroll \"manages to unite natural history with the hard science of genomics.\"\n\nLouise S. Mead, reviewing \"The Making of the Fittest\" for the National Center for Science Education, notes that Carroll provides \"some of the overwhelming evidence for evolution provided in DNA\", using different lines of inquiry such as DNA sequences that code for genes no longer in use, and evidence of evolutionary change. Mead notes that evolutionary theory has predictive power, as with icefish whose ancestors had haemoglobin, but no longer needing it in icy water, they have lost it.\n\nDouglas H. Erwin, reviewing \"Endless Forms Most Beautiful\" for \"Artificial Life\", remarks that life forms from \"Drosophila\" to man have far fewer genes than many biologists expected – in man's case, only some 20,000, which is about the same as a fly. He notes the \"astonishing morphological diversity\" of animals coming from \"such a limited number of genes\". He praises Carroll's \"insightful and enthusiastic\" style, writing in a \"witty and engaging\" way, pulling the reader into the complexities of Hox and PAX-6, as well as celebrating the Cambrian explosion of life forms, and much else.\n\n\n \n"}

Conspiracy arguments, though related to, are distinct from constitutional, statutory, and administrative arguments. Proponents of such arguments contend that all three branches of the United States government are working covertly to defraud the taxpayers of the United States through the illegal imposition, assessment and collection of a federal income tax.\n\nTax protester Irwin Schiff, following his criminal conviction for tax fraud that resulted in the imposition of a 13-year prison sentence, released a statement asserting in part that \"the entire federal judiciary is involved in a monumental, criminal conspiracy to collect income taxes in violation of law\". Schiff's web site continues to state: \"Since the income tax was repealed in 1954 when Congress adopted the 1954 Code, it is clear that for 50 years federal judges in conspiracy with U. S. Department of Injustice prosecutors have been illegally and criminally prosecuting people for crimes that do not exist in connection with a tax that nobody owes.\"\n\nOne tax protester web site, called www.tax-freedom.com, quotes from an article by William Cooper titled \"BATF/IRS - Criminal Fraud\", from the publication \"Veritas\" (issue no. 6, September 1995), as follows:\nClaims made in support of the income tax conspiracy include:\nSome tax protesters (and occasionally persons brought before courts) have argued that because the titles of court cases identify the parties in all capital letters, the persons thus identified are \"fictitious entities\". In other words, a court hearing a case titled \"STATE v. JOHN Q. SMITH\" has no authority over the defendant, \"John Q. Smith\", because the capitalization of the name means the court is addressing a person who does not exist. Such an argument was made by Eddie Ray Kahn, a co-defendant of Wesley Snipes in the latter's high-profile tax evasion case. Kahn \"made several missteps and peculiar motions. For example, he sought to be immediately freed because the indictment lists his name in all capital letters, and he claimed U.S. attorneys have no jurisdiction because Florida supposedly was never ceded to the federal government\". The court denied these motions.\n\nNo court has ever upheld such an argument. See, e.g. \"United States v. Frech\" (\"Defendants' assertion that the capitalization of their names in court documents constitutes constructive fraud, thereby depriving the district court of jurisdiction and venue, is without any basis in law or fact\"); \"United States v. Washington\" (\"defendant contends that the Indictment must be dismissed because 'KURT WASHINGTON,' spelled out in capital letters, is a fictitious name used by the Government to tax him improperly as a business, and that the correct spelling and presentation of his name is 'Kurt Washington.' This contention is baseless\"). See also \"United States v. Ford\" (taxpayer's argument—that an IRS summons was invalid because the IRS capitalized all the letters in the taxpayer's name in the caption of a petition—was ruled to be frivolous). Similar arguments have been raised unsuccessfully about things such as the presence or absence of punctuation, or of a middle name or middle initial.\n\nOne group, calling itself \"We the People\", has stated that government personnel are engaged in a conspiracy in connection with Federal tax forms and \"OMB [Office of Management and Budget] control numbers\" in connection with a criminal tax case involving a tax protester:\n\nOne convicted tax protester, Edward Lewis Brown, has charged that law enforcement officials who surrounded his property in a standoff over his refusal to surrender after his conviction were part of a \"Zionist, Illuminati, Free Mason movement,\" and that the federal government had no jurisdiction in New Hampshire. The \"New Hampshire Union Leader\" also reported that \"the Browns believe the IRS and the federal income tax are part of a deliberate plot perpetrated by Freemasons to control the American people and eventually the world.\"\n\nIn an interview on February 2, 2007, on the radio show \"Constitution for the Defense,\" Ed Brown said:\nThe standoff between Brown and law enforcement officials ended with his imprisonment after his arrest in October 2007.\n\nSome protesters have argued that Federal Reserve notes (better known as dollar bills) are not actually money, because the Constitution only permits the government to \"coin\" money, and requires that such money be exchangeable for gold or silver; therefore, printed bills are instead symbols for use in bartering, and being paid in dollars is not the receipt of taxable income. This argument was brought before a court in \"Wilson v. United States\". The court responded:\nOther occasionally encountered arguments from tax protesters include the notion that U.S. currency is valueless or unauthorized by the Constitution because the currency is fiat money untied to the gold standard. No court has upheld the validity of that argument.\n\nThe argument that Federal reserve notes are not taxable income when paid to a taxpayer because the notes are not gold and silver and may not be redeemed for gold and silver, and variations of this argument, have been officially identified as legally frivolous Federal tax return positions for purposes of the $5,000 frivolous tax return penalty imposed under Internal Revenue Code section 6702(a).\n\nArguments have been made asserting that members of certain historically disadvantaged minority groups are not obliged to pay taxes. Such arguments have been made, and rejected, with respect to African Americans, Native Americans, and native Hawaiians. Similar arguments have been made in countries other than the United States. For example, such an argument was rejected in the case of a Māori citizen seeking to avoid payment of taxes in New Zealand.\n\nWith respect to the failure to pay U.S. federal income tax, some tax protesters miss the distinction between civil and criminal liability. A verdict of acquittal in a criminal trial for non-payment of income tax does not relieve a defendant of civil liability (i.e., the legal obligation to pay the tax). After a criminal acquittal, the IRS can continue to seek money through levy or other lawful means. Generally, the amount of money due to the IRS is determined administratively by the IRS, and not in a criminal trial. (The amount of tax may, however, be calculated after the guilty verdict is reached in a criminal case—for purposes of determining the severity of the sentence.) Although there have been several well-publicized cases of acquittal in a criminal tax case, the IRS continues collection efforts, with many defendants finally seeking refuge in bankruptcy court.\n\nA related concept is that under American jurisprudence, different standards of proof are required in civil and criminal proceedings. Normally, to be convicted of a crime, the defendant must have had a specific mens rea, or guilty mental state. For criminal violations of the income tax law, this generally means that the prohibited conduct (whether failure to file, failure to pay, or engaging in some affirmative act to evade the tax), must have been accompanied by an intentional violation of a legal duty of which the defendant was aware. By contrast, to establish civil liability to pay the tax, no \"mens rea\" on the part of the defendant is required to be proven.\n\n"}

Most official data collections differentiate travel as being for either leisure, business, or VFR purposes. In many destinations, VFR is the largest or second-largest form of travel by size. Definitions have been traditionally lacking due to the complexities involved in understanding VFR travel.

But [contrary to popular belief] if you look at it, you will notice that every fifth sentence or so simply does not make sense…the fact is that a fifth of the Qur’anic text is just incomprehensible. If the Qur’an is not comprehensible, if it can’t even be understood in Arabic, then it’s not translatable into any language. That is why Muslims are afraid.
