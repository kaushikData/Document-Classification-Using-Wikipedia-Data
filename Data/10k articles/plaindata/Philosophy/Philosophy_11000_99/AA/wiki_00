This principle is relevant to the determination of liability and is applicable when plaintiffs/claimants have, through their own negligence, contributed to the harm they suffered. In some jurisdictions it may be applied by the court in a tort matter irrespective of whether it was pleaded as a defense.\n\nThe contributory negligence defense can potentially eliminate the defendant's responsibility to pay damages to an injured plaintiff. For example, a pedestrian crosses a road negligently and is hit by a driver who was driving negligently. Since the pedestrian has also contributed to the accident, they may be barred from complete and full recovery of damages from the driver (or their insurer) because the accident was less likely to occur if it hadn't been for their failure to keep a proper lookout. Another example of contributory negligence is where a plaintiff actively disregards warnings or fails to take reasonable steps for his or her safety, then assumes a certain level of risk in a given activity; such as diving in shallow water without checking the depth first.\n\nThe doctrine of contributory negligence was dominant in U.S. jurisprudence in the 19th and 20th century. The English case Butterfield v. Forrester is generally recognized as the first appearance, although in this case the judge found the victim to be the sole proximate cause of the injury.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, in order to successfully raise an contributory negligence defense, the defendant must prove the negligence of a plaintiff or claimant. In others, the burden of proof is on a plaintiff to disprove his or her own negligence.\n\nEven if the plaintiff was negligent, the tortfeasor may still be held liable if he or she had the last clear chance to prevent the injury, meaning that even though the plaintiff was negligent the defendant was the last person with a clear opportunity to take action that would have prevented the plaintiff's injury from occurring.\n\nContributory negligence is generally a defense to a tort of negligence. The defense is not available if the tortfeasor's conduct amounts to malicious or intentional wrongdoing, rather than to ordinary negligence.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, the doctrine states that a victim who is at fault to any degree, including only 1% at fault, may be denied compensation entirely. This is known as pure contributory negligence.\n\nIn Australia, particularly New South Wales, the award of damages is reduced by the same percentage as the plaintiff's own negligence. For example, if the plaintiff was 50% negligent in causing his or her own accident, but would otherwise be entitled to $100,000 in damages, a court will award only $50,000. A court may also find that 100% contributory negligence is applicable in which case the plaintiff is not entitled to any damages. Determining the extent of the contributory negligence is subjective and heavily dependent on the evidence available. Parties will often work to negotiate a mutually satisfactory percentage figure when engaging in alternative dispute resolution (such as mediation). If the matter does not settle, a percentage figure is ultimately assigned by the court at the hearing.\n\nIn Australia, contributory negligence is available when the plaintiff's own negligence contributed to its own injuries. Also refer to \"Pennington v Norris\" for second test.\n\nIn the United States, the pure contributory negligence only applies in Alabama, Maryland, North Carolina, and Virginia. Indiana applies pure contributory negligence to medical malpractice cases and tort claims against governmental entities. In the other 45 states in the U.S., plaintiff's recovery is simply diminished by the extent to which he or she contributed to the harm under principles of comparative negligence, with some states using a mixed model of comparative and contributory negligence. A state with a mixed model may, for example, prevent a plaintiff from recovering damages if the plaintiff is determined to bear more than 50% of the responsibility for his or her own injury.\n\nIn England and Wales, it is not possible to defeat a claim under contributory negligence and therefore completely deny the victim compensation. It does however allow for a reduction in damages recoverable to the extent that the court sees fit.\n\nIn England and Wales, it is not a defense to the tort of conversion or trespass to chattels. In the United States, it is not a defense to any intentional tort. \n\nIn India compensation in favour of victim gets reduced in proportion with his negligence.\n\n\n"}

It is one of the few texts presenting in a consistent form the earlier philosophy of Leibniz.\n\nThe \"Discourse\" is closely connected to the epistolary discussion which he carried with Antoine Arnauld. However Leibniz refrained from sending the full text and it remained unpublished until the mid 19th century. Arnauld received only an abridged version in 37 points which resumed whole paragraphs and steered their discussion.\n\nThe metaphysical considerations proceed from God to the substantial world and back to the spiritual realm. The starting point for the work is the conception of God as \"an absolutely perfect being\" (I), that God is good but goodness exists independently of God (a rejection of divine command theory) (II), and that God has created the world in an ordered and perfect fashion (III–VII).\n\nAt the time of its writing \"Discourse\" made the controversial claim \"That the opinions of... scholastic philosophers are not to be wholly despised\" (XI). Early work in modern philosophy during the 17th century were based on a rejection of many of the precepts of medieval philosophy. Leibniz saw the failures of scholasticism merely as one of rigor. \"[If] some careful and meditative mind were to take the trouble to clarify and direct their thoughts in the manner of analytic geometers, he would find a great treasure of important truths, wholly demonstrable.\"\n\nLeibniz claimed that God's omnipotence was in no way impugned by the thought of evil, but was rather solidified. He endorsed the view that God chose the best of all possible worlds. In other words, Leibniz believed this world (or reality) to be the best there possibly could be — taking all facts into account, no better world could be imagined, even if we believed that we could think of something more perfect.\n\nLeibniz's conception of physical substance is expanded upon in \"The Monadology\".\n\n\n\n"}

The doctrine was founded upon the policy concern that a defendant alleged to have infringed a single work might find himself facing claims from multiple plaintiffs, all claiming copyright in that same work. Despite the indivisibility doctrine, a copyright holder could still effectively assign certain rights. The assignees of those rights were held to be \"mere licensees.\"\n\nThis doctrine could yield a harsh result for an exclusive licensee in a work. If a third party infringed the work, the copyright holder had no motivation to file suit---the work was no longer marketable. So courts allowed exclusive licensees to compulsively join the copyright holder as a plaintiff in such suits. Non-exclusive licensees could not forcefully join copyright holders, on the theory that in those cases, the work was still marketable and the copyright holder therefore had an interest in protecting his rights.\n\nIn the case \"Goodis v. United Artists Television, Inc.\", 425 F.2d 397, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that the doctrine of indivisibility could not operate to wholly deprive an author of his copyright when a \"mere licensee\" secured a copyright in a collective work but the author never secured a separate copyright on his own.\n\nThe doctrine of indivisibility was expressly eliminated in the Copyright Act of 1976. Assignees of rights in a copyrighted work now have standing to directly file suit against infringers.\n"}

Forest genetic resources are essential for forest-depending communities who rely for a substantial part of their livelihoods on timber and non-timber forest products (for example fruits, gums and resins) for food security, domestic use and income generation. These resources are also the basis for large-scale wood production in planted forests to satisfy the worldwide need for timber and paper. Genetic resources of several important timber, fruit and other non-timber tree species are conserved ex situ in genebanks or maintained in field collections. Nevertheless, in situ conservation in forests and on farms is in the case of most tree species the most important measure to protect their genetic resources.\n\nA better understanding of the diversity of these species is crucial for their sustainable use and conservation. Monitoring ol patterns of distribution and genetic diversity of these species allows the prioritization of populations for in situ conservation, identification of populations and species most at risk and existing gaps in genebank collections. This is vital information which helps tackle global challenges such as food security and climate change.\n\nIn 2014, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations published the first State of the World's Forest Genetic Resources. The publication addressed the conservation, management and sustainable use of forest tree and other woody plant genetic resources of actual and potential value for human well-being in the broad range of management systems. It was prepared based on information provided by 86 countries, outcomes from regional and subregional consultations, and commissioned thematic studies. Amongst the ten key findings, half of the forest species reported as regularly utilized by countries are threatened by the conversion of forests to pastures and farmland, overexploitation, and the impacts of climate change.\n\nOn the basis of the information and knowledge compiled by FAO for The State of World’s Forest Genetic Resources, the Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture developed the Global Plan of Action for the Conservation, Sustainable Use and Development of Forest Genetic Resources. This Global Plan of Action identifies 27 strategic priorities grouped into 4 areas: 1) improving the availability of, and access to, information on forest genetic resources; 2) conservation of forest genetic resources (in situ and ex situ); 3) sustainable use, development and management of forest genetic resources; 4) policies, institutions and capacity-building.\n\nEven though this is a field with many uncertainties, it is evident that during the next 50–100 years climate changes will have an effect on the distribution of forest tree species and the composition of forests. Diversity of forest genetic resources enables the potential for a species (or a population) to adapt to climatic changes and related future challenges such as temperature changes, drought, pests, diseases and forest fires. Though forest trees are known for showing great plasticity in their response to climate changes, not all species are naturally capable to adapt at the pace necessary. For that reason human interventions, such as transfer of forest reproductive material, may be needed. This is particular important for rare and scattered distributed species and species found on the edge of its distribution range.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "63742", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=63742", "title": "Friedrich Schiller", "text": "Friedrich Schiller\n\nJohann Christoph Friedrich von Schiller (; 10 November 17599 May 1805) was a German poet, philosopher, physician, historian, and playwright. During the last seventeen years of his life (1788–1805), Schiller struck up a productive, if complicated, friendship with the already famous and influential Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. They frequently discussed issues concerning aesthetics, and Schiller encouraged Goethe to finish works he left as sketches. This relationship and these discussions led to a period now referred to as Weimar Classicism. They also worked together on \"Xenien\", a collection of short satirical poems in which both Schiller and Goethe challenge opponents of their philosophical vision.\n\nFriedrich Schiller was born on 10 November 1759, in Marbach, Württemberg, as the only son of military doctor (1733–1796) and (1732–1802). They also had five daughters, including Christophine, the eldest. Schiller grew up in a very religious family and spent much of his youth studying the Bible, which would later influence his writing for the theatre. His father was away in the Seven Years' War when Friedrich was born. He was named after king Frederick the Great, but he was called Fritz by nearly everyone. Kaspar Schiller was rarely home during the war, but he did manage to visit the family once in a while. His wife and children also visited him occasionally wherever he happened to be stationed. When the war ended in 1763, Schiller's father became a recruiting officer and was stationed in Schwäbisch Gmünd. The family moved with him. Due to the high cost of living—especially the rent—the family moved to the nearby Lorch.\n\nAlthough the family was happy in Lorch, Schiller's father found his work unsatisfying. He sometimes took his son with him. In Lorch, Schiller received his primary education. The quality of the lessons was fairly bad, and Friedrich regularly cut class with his older sister. Because his parents wanted Schiller to become a pastor, they had the pastor of the village instruct the boy in Latin and Greek. Pastor Moser was a good teacher, and later Schiller named the cleric in his first play \"Die Räuber\" (\"The Robbers\") after him. As a boy, Schiller was excited by the idea of becoming a cleric and often put on black robes and pretended to preach.\n\nIn 1766, the family left Lorch for the Duke of Württemberg's principal residence, Ludwigsburg. Schiller's father had not been paid for three years, and the family had been living on their savings but could no longer afford to do so. So Kaspar Schiller took an assignment to the garrison in Ludwigsburg.\n\nThere the boy Schiller came to the attention of Karl Eugen, Duke of Württemberg. He entered the Karlsschule Stuttgart (an elite military academy founded by the Duke), in 1773, where he eventually studied medicine. During most of his short life, he suffered from illnesses that he tried to cure himself.\n\nWhile at the Karlsschule, Schiller read Rousseau and Goethe and discussed Classical ideals with his classmates. At school, he wrote his first play, \"The Robbers\", which dramatizes the conflict between two aristocratic brothers: the elder, Karl Moor, leads a group of rebellious students into the Bohemian forest where they become Robin Hood-like bandits, while Franz Moor, the younger brother, schemes to inherit his father's considerable estate. The play's critique of social corruption and its affirmation of proto-revolutionary republican ideals astounded its original audience. Schiller became an overnight sensation. Later, Schiller would be made an honorary member of the French Republic because of this play. The play was inspired by Leisewitz' earlier play \"Julius of Tarent\", a favourite of the young Schiller.\n\nIn 1780, he obtained a post as regimental doctor in Stuttgart, a job he disliked. In order to attend the first performance of \"The Robbers\" in Mannheim, Schiller left his regiment without permission. As a result, he was arrested, sentenced to 14 days of imprisonment, and forbidden by Karl Eugen from publishing any further works.\n\nHe fled Stuttgart in 1782, going via Frankfurt, Mannheim, Leipzig, and Dresden to Weimar. Along this journey he had an affair with an army officer's wife Charlotte von Kalb. She was at the centre of an intellectual circle, and she was known for her cleverness and instability. Schiller needed help from his family and friends to extricate himself from his financial situation and attachment to a married woman. Schiller settled in Weimar in 1787. In 1789, he was appointed professor of History and Philosophy in Jena, where he wrote only historical works. He was ennobled in 1802, thereby adding the honorific \"von\" to his name.\n\nOn 22 February 1790, Schiller married Charlotte von Lengefeld (1766–1826). Two sons (Karl Friedrich Ludwig and Ernst Friedrich Wilhelm) and two daughters (Karoline Luise Henriette and Luise Henriette Emilie) were born between 1793 and 1804. The last living descendant of Schiller was a grandchild of Emilie, Baron Alexander von Gleichen-Rußwurm, who died at Baden-Baden, Germany, in 1947.\n\nSchiller returned with his family to Weimar from Jena in 1799. Goethe convinced him to return to playwriting. He and Goethe founded the Weimar Theater, which became the leading theater in Germany. Their collaboration helped lead to a renaissance of drama in Germany.\n\nFor his achievements, Schiller was ennobled in 1802 by the Duke of Saxe-Weimar, adding the nobiliary particle \"von\" to his name. He remained in Weimar, Saxe-Weimar until his death at 45 from tuberculosis in 1805.\n\nThe first authoritative biography of Schiller was by his sister-in-law Caroline von Wolzogen in 1830, \"\" (Schiller's Life).\n\nThe coffin containing what was purportedly Schiller's skeleton was brought in 1827 into the Weimarer Fürstengruft (Weimar's Ducal Vault), the burial place of the house of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach in the Historical Cemetery of Weimar and later also Goethe's resting place. On 3 May 2008, scientists announced that DNA tests have shown that the skull of this skeleton is not Schiller's, and his tomb is now vacant. The physical resemblance between this skull and the extant death mask as well as to portraits of Schiller, had led many experts to believe that the skull was Schiller's.\nThe city of Stuttgart erected in 1839 a statue in his memory on a square renamed Schillerplatz. A Schiller monument was unveiled on Berlin's Gendarmenmarkt in 1871.\n\nFriedrich Schiller, the German poet, philosopher, historian, and dramatist, statue on Belle Isle in Detroit Michigan. This statue of the German poet and playwright was commissioned by Detroit's German-American community in 1908 at a cost of $12,000; the designer was Herman Matzen.\n\nHis image appeared on the German Democratic Republic 10 Mark banknotes of the 1964 emission.\n\nIn September 2008, Schiller was voted by the audience of the TV channel Arte as the second most important playwright in Europe after William Shakespeare.\n\nSome Freemasons speculate that Schiller was a Freemason, but this has not been proven.\n\nIn 1787, in his tenth letter about \"Don Carlos\", Schiller wrote:\nIn a letter from 1829, two Freemasons from Rudolstadt complain about the dissolving of their Lodge \"Günther zum stehenden Löwen\" that was honoured by the initiation of Schiller. According to Schiller's great-grandson Alexander von Gleichen-Rußwurm, Schiller was brought to the Lodge by \"Wilhelm Heinrich Karl von Gleichen-Rußwurm\". No membership document has been found.\n\nSchiller wrote many philosophical papers on ethics and aesthetics. He synthesized the thought of Immanuel Kant with the thought of the German Idealist philosopher, Karl Leonhard Reinhold. He elaborated Christoph Martin Wieland's concept of ' (the beautiful soul), a human being whose emotions have been educated by reason, so that ' (duty and inclination) are no longer in conflict with one another; thus beauty, for Schiller, is not merely an aesthetic experience, but a moral one as well: the Good is the Beautiful. The link between morality and aesthetics also occurs in Schiller's controversial poem, \"Die Götter Griechenlandes (The Gods of Greece).\" The \"gods\" in Schiller's poem are thought by modern scholars to represent moral and aesthetic values, which Schiller tied to Paganism and an idea of enchanted nature. In this respect, Schiller's aesthetic doctrine shows the influence of Christian Theosophy.\n\nThere is general consensus among scholars that it makes sense to think of Schiller as a liberal, and he is frequently cited as a cosmopolitan thinker. Schiller's philosophical work was particularly concerned with the question of human freedom, a preoccupation which also guided his historical researches, such as the Thirty Years' War and the Dutch Revolt, and then found its way as well into his dramas (the \"Wallenstein\" trilogy concerns the Thirty Years' War, while \"Don Carlos\" addresses the revolt of the Netherlands against Spain.) Schiller wrote two important essays on the question of the sublime (\"), entitled \" and \"\"; these essays address one aspect of human freedom—the ability to defy one's animal instincts, such as the drive for self-preservation, when, for example, someone willingly sacrifices themselves for conceptual ideals.\n\nSchiller is considered by most Germans to be Germany's most important classical playwright. Critics like F.J. Lamport and Eric Auerbach have noted his innovative use of dramatic structure and his creation of new forms, such as the melodrama and the bourgeois tragedy. What follows is a brief, chronological description of the plays.\n\nA pivotal work by Schiller was \"On the Aesthetic Education of Man in a Series of Letters\" (\"Über die ästhetische Erziehung des Menschen in einer Reihe von Briefen\"), first published 1794, which was inspired by the great disenchantment Schiller felt about the French Revolution, its degeneration into violence and the failure of successive governments to put its ideals into practice. Schiller wrote that \"a great moment has found a little people\"; he wrote the \"Letters\" as a philosophical inquiry into what had gone wrong, and how to prevent such tragedies in the future. In the \"Letters\" he asserts that it is possible to elevate the moral character of a people, by first touching their souls with beauty, an idea that is also found in his poem \"Die Künstler\" (\"The Artists\"): \"Only through Beauty's morning-gate, dost thou penetrate the land of knowledge.\"\n\nOn the philosophical side, \"Letters\" put forth the notion of \"der sinnliche Trieb / Sinnestrieb\" (\"the sensuous drive\") and \"Formtrieb\" (\"the formal drive\"). In a comment to Immanuel Kant's philosophy, Schiller transcends the dualism between \"Formtrieb\" and \"Sinnestrieb\" with the notion of \"Spieltrieb\" (\"the play drive\"), derived from, as are a number of other terms, Kant's \"Critique of the Faculty of Judgment\". The conflict between man's material, sensuous nature and his capacity for reason (\"Formtrieb\" being the drive to impose conceptual and moral order on the world), Schiller resolves with the happy union of \"Formtrieb\" and \"Sinnestrieb\", the \"play drive,\" which for him is synonymous with artistic beauty, or \"living form.\" On the basis of \"Spieltrieb\", Schiller sketches in \"Letters\" a future \"ideal state\" (a eutopia), where everyone will be content, and everything will be beautiful, thanks to the free play of \"Spieltrieb\". Schiller's focus on the dialectical interplay between \"Formtrieb\" and \"Sinnestrieb\" has inspired a wide range of succeeding aesthetic philosophical theory, including notably Jacques Rancière's conception of the \"aesthetic regime of art,\" as well as social philosophy in Herbert Marcuse. In the second part of his important work \"Eros and Civilization\", Marcuse finds Schiller's notion of \"Spieltrieb\" useful in thinking a social situation without the condition of modern social alienation. He writes, \"Schiller's \"Letters\" ... aim at remaking of civilization by virtue of the liberating force of the aesthetic function: it is envisaged as containing the possibility of a new reality principle.\"\n\nLudwig van Beethoven said that a great poem is more difficult to set to music than a merely good one because the composer must rise higher than the poet – \"who can do that in the case of Schiller? In this respect Goethe is much easier,\" wrote Beethoven.\n\nThere are relatively few famous musical settings of Schiller's poems. Notable exceptions are Beethoven's setting of \"An die Freude\" (\"Ode to Joy\") in the final movement of his Ninth Symphony, Johannes Brahms' choral setting of \"Nänie\" and \"Des Mädchens Klage\" by Franz Schubert, who set 44 of Schiller's poems as Lieder, mostly for voice and piano, also including \"Die Bürgschaft\".

{"id": "14952655", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14952655", "title": "Fundamental ontology", "text": "Fundamental ontology\n\nIn \"Being and Time\", Martin Heidegger made the distinction between ontical and ontological. Ontical refers to a particular area of Being, whereas ontological ought to refer to Being as such. The history of ontology in Western Philosophy is, in Heidegger's terms, properly speaking, ontical, and ontology ought to designate fundamental ontology. He says \"Ontological inquiry is indeed more primordial, as over against the ontical inquiry of the positive sciences\". It is from this distinction he developed his project of fundamental ontology (German: \"Fundamental ontologie\")\nThe project of fundamental ontology appeared as a result of Heidegger's decision to re-interpret phenomenology, which he had developed earlier in collaboration with his mentor Edmund Husserl, using a neat set of ontological categories.\n\nFor this project Heidegger had to look for new terminologies by means of which it would become possible for him adequately to represent the structure of his new brand of phenomenology. The significantly large change in terminology Heidegger made in the project also resulted in a reconsideration and redefinition of many traditional concepts. For instance, the thesis that a phenomenon is the essence of a thing could not be articulated by using traditional concepts alone; in fact, Heidegger consistently refused to use these concepts in their original (i.e. Husserl's) senses. He re-interpreted such basic philosophical categories as \"subject\", \"object\", \"spirit\", \"body\", \"consciousness\", \"reality\" and others with a new emphasis on Being (German: \"Sein\"), showing their inadequacy for his new philosophical explorations.\n\nMoreover, Heidegger went on to separate his pursuit of \"ontology\" from the kinds of inquiry that previous researches of \"essence\" had conducted under the same label, which henceforth, according to Heidegger, should be engaged only in particular fields of science. For Heidegger, the ontical forms of research conducted by scientists presuppose the regional-ontological, which in turn presupposes the fundamental-ontological. As he expresses it:\n\nThe question of Being aims… at ascertaining the \"a priori\" conditions not only for the possibility of the sciences which examine beings as beings of such and such a type, and, in doing so, already operate with an understanding of Being, but also for the possibility of those ontologies themselves which are prior to the ontical sciences and which provide their foundations. \"Basically, all ontology, no matter how rich and firmly compacted a system of categories it has at its disposal, remains blind and perverted from its ownmost aim, if it has not first adequately clarified the meaning of Being, and conceived this clarification as its fundamental task\".\nEarlier philosophers, namely ancient ones, have stated that only in phenomenon was it possible to posit the essence of things. Thus the phenomenon was opposed to essence, and it was the moment of opposition of the subject and object. Husserl had differentiated his new notion of phenomenon from the traditionally accepted notion of phenomenon as \"occurrence\". The notion of \"phenomenon\" as introduced by Husserl in his phenomenology carries in itself the two faces of things: phenomenon as \"representation of the world as it is reflected in consciousness\" and the essence of a thing \"as it is in itself\". In Husserl's belief, 'phenomenon' as he defined it appeared comprehensive and sufficient for his philosophical ventures. Husserl's perspective, as Heidegger saw it, left some room for new development in phenomenology: bringing \"ontology\" into \"phenomenology\" with a new force. For Heidegger, Husserl's ideas were \"in exile\" with their transcendental tendency, because they were exclusively concerned with consciousness, and they had to be \"thrown\" back into the historical, external world. From the Heidegger's point of view the attempt of his mentor to design and save life only inside human consciousness, i.e. \"the world above\" of the transcendental ego, was not sufficient. Thus, the first task that Heidegger took on was to work out how to refute Husserl's immanence of consciousness while preserving all the achievements of his mentor's phenomenology.\n\nOn the other hand, why did Heidegger want to base his \"new phenomenology\" only on the category of Being, and to set as his task a formulation and proof of it? Answering this question, he again refers to the phenomenological maxim: without any intention to address directly \"things\" (German: \"zur Sache selbst\"), then what kind of intellectual outlook will be at all possible? To Heidegger the necessary focus is clear: Being in its various forms. Really, I exist, things surrounding me exist, and people surrounding me exist. Here it is important to understand that being is primary; things, I, and people, for instance, are all forms of being. Being reveals itself first of all in its multiplicity, in the form of separate essences (German: \"Seiendes\").\n\nToday there are only two ontological alternatives in philosophy: the \"objectivistic\" variant of philosophy which was carefully developed by Nicolai Hartmann, - and the \"subjectivistic\" fundamental ontology of Heidegger. For a variety of reasons, recently, the majority of philosophers give preference to the second, to Heidegger's alternative.\n\nHeidegger argues “Dasein is an entity which does not just occur among other entities. Rather it is ontically distinguished by the fact that, in its very Being, that Being is an issue for it”. Human beings are in a privileged position to understand Fundamental Ontology.\n\n\n"}

He also claims that Paul the Apostle condemned extramarital sex out of apocalyptic fears (he thought that the world was going to end soon) and that Jesus does not say anything about this, except regulating divorce between a man and one of his wives. Coogan does use therein the singular (\"wife\"), but does not say that a man could have only one wife, since Jesus was therein discussing the Law of Moses, which allowed for polygamy.\n\nInterviewed by \"Time\" magazine about this book, he also says that words often translated in the Bible as \"sodomy\" have often nothing to do with anal intercourse between men, and that according to Sola Scriptura, the Mormons were right about polygamy.\n\nThe book was well received by Jessica Warner, from the University of Toronto, but was criticized by Prof. Phyllis Trible, from Wake Forest University School of Divinity in North Carolina. Trible asserts that patriarchy was not decreed by God but only described by him, it being specific for humans after the fall, and claims that Saint Paul made the same mistake as Coogan in this respect. The Catholic apologist Robert Sungenis strongly denounced both the book and the author on numerous other grounds.\n\nThe book was reviewed by ABC Radio National which claimed that \"Michael Coogan is one of the leading Biblical scholars in the US, and in his book \"God and Sex: What the Bible Really Says\", he reveals all, including whether David loved Jonathan in that way.\"\n\nCNN gave Coogan the chance to present his book on its website.

The word refers to an environment, like a biosphere, that is populated by informational entities called inforgs. While an example of the sphere of information is cyberspace, infospheres are not limited to purely online environments.\n\nThe first documented use of the word \"InfoSphere\" was a 1971 Time Magazine book review by R.Z. Sheppard in which he writes \"In much the way that fish cannot conceptualize water or birds the air, man barely understands his infosphere, that encircling layer of electronic and typographical smog composed of cliches from journalism, entertainment, advertising and government.\"\n\nIn 1980 it was used by Alvin Toffler in his book \"The Third Wave\" in which he writes \"What is inescapably clear, whatever we choose to believe, is that we are altering our infosphere fundamentally...we are adding a whole new strata of communication to the social system. The emerging Third Wave infosphere makes that of the Second Wave era - dominated by its mass media, the post office, and the telephone - seem hopelessly primitive by contrast\".\n\nThe Toffler definition proved prophetic as the use of \"Infosphere\" in the 1990s expanded beyond media to speculate about the common evolution of the Internet, society and culture. \n\nIn his book \"Digital Dharma\", Steven Vedro writes, \"Emerging from what French philosopher-priest Pierre Teilhard de Chardin called the shared noosphere of collective human thought, invention and spiritual seeking, the Infosphere is sometimes used to conceptualize a field that engulfs our physical, mental and etheric bodies; it affects our dreaming and our cultural life. Our evolving nervous system has been extended, as media sage Marshall McLuhan predicted in the early 1960s, into a global embrace.\"\n\nThe term has also been used by Luciano Floridi, on the basis of biosphere, to denote the whole informational environment constituted by all informational entities (thus including informational agents as well), their properties, interactions, processes and mutual relations. It is an environment comparable to, but different from cyberspace (which is only one of its sub-regions, as it were), since it also includes off-line and analogue spaces of information. According to Floridi, it is possible to equate the Infosphere to the totality of Being. This equation leads him to an informational ontology.\n\nThe manipulation of the infosphere is subject to metaphysics and its rules. Information is considered to be Shannon information and is treated in a physical sense separate from energy and matter. The manipulations to the infosphere include the erasing, transfer, duplication, and destruction of information.\n\nThe term was used by Dan Simmons in the science-fiction saga Hyperion (published 1989) to indicate what the Internet could become in the future: a place parallel, virtual, formed of billions of networks, with \"artificial life\" on various scales, from what is equivalent to an insect (small programs) to what is equivalent to a god (artificial intelligences), whose motivations are diverse, seeking to both help mankind and harm it.\n\nIn the animated sitcom \"Futurama\", the Infosphere is a huge sphere floating in space, in which a species of giant, talking, floating brains attempts to store all of the information known in the universe.\n\nThe IBM Software Group created the InfoSphere brand in 2008 for its Information Management software products.\n\n\n"}

In adult life he travelled extensively, helping create a utopian colony in Topolobampo, Mexico, and editing the Topolobampo periodical from his New Jersey home.\n\nJames settled in Los Angeles, California, in 1886. He joined the Los Angeles branch of the Theosophical Society on July 28, 1887. His brother John was already a member at that time. John later dropped out of the Theosophical Society and founded the Gnostic Society in 1928. The original headquarters of the Gnostic Society was in John's home in Los Angeles (address: 919 South Bernal Avenue, Los Angeles, California).\n\nIn July 1888 the Pryse brothers arrived in New York City. In 1889, members of the Theosophical Society from New York City and Chicago purchased a printing press and type, for the purpose of setting up a publishing company which would handle the publishing needs of the various branches of the Theosophical Society located in the United States. This theosophical publishing company, named the Aryan Press, was located at 144 Madison Avenue in Manhattan, New York City. James was recruited to set up and operate the Aryan Press, which was in full operation by December 1889.\n\nDue to the success of the Aryan Press, a larger printing press was purchased and shipped to London, England. In August 1890, James was contacted by Helena Blavatsky (1831-1891) (co-founder of the Theosophical Society) and summoned to London, for the purpose of setting up and operating this new publishing company, known as the H. P. B. Press (Printers to the Theosophical Society). This printing press was also referred to as the \"Blavatsky Press.\" James left New York City for London in September 1890, at which time his brother John took over operation of the Aryan Press. The H. P. B. Press (Blavatsky Press) was installed in London ( at 42 Henry Street, Regent's Park, London, N. W.) about November 1890.\n\nBlavatsky had asked James to publish her \"Esoteric Instructions\" in the United States, so the work would be accessible to members of the American branches of the Theosophical Society. Blavatsky's \"Esoteric Instructions\" was duly published by the Aryan Press in 1890.\n\nIn \"The Apocalypse Unsealed\" (1910) Pryse published the secret key to decoding the esoteric meaning of the Biblical \"Book of Revelation\". His \"The Restored New Testament\" (1914) also shows esoteric meaning.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1334117", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1334117", "title": "Kīla (Buddhism)", "text": "Kīla (Buddhism)\n\nThe kīla or phurba (Sanskrit Devanagari: कील; IAST: kīla; , alternate transliterations and English orthographies: \"phurpa\", \"phurbu\", \"purbha\", or \"phurpu\") is a three-sided peg, stake, knife, or nail-like ritual implement traditionally associated with Indo-Tibetan Buddhism, Bön, and Indian Vedic traditions. \n\nThe \"kīla\" is associated with the meditational deity (Sanskrit: \"ishtadevata\", Tibetan \"yidam\") Vajrakīla (वज्रकील) or Vajrakīlaya (Tibetan \"Dorje Phurba\") \n\nMost of what is known of the Indian kīla lore has come by way of Tibetan culture. Scholars such as F. A. Bischoff, Charles Hartman and Martin Boord have shown that the Tibetan literature widely asserts that the Sanskrit for their term \"phurba\" is \"kīlaya\" (with or without the long \"i\"). However, as Boord describes it, \"all dictionaries and Sanskrit works agree the word to be \"kīla\" (or \"kīlaka\"). I suppose this [discrepancy] to result from an indiscriminate use by Tibetans of the dative singular \"kīlaya\". This form would have been familiar to them in the simple salutation \"namo vajrakīlaya\" (homage to Vajrakīla) from which it could easily be assumed by those unfamiliar with the technicalities of Sanskrit that the name of the deity is Vajrakīlaya instead of Vajrakīla. It should also be noted that the term \"(vajra)kīlaya\" is frequently found in Sanskrit texts (as well as in virtually every \"kīlamantra\") legitimately used as the denominative verb 'to spike,' 'transfix,' 'nail down,' etc.\"\n\nMayer (1996) contests Boord's assertion, pointing out that eminent Sanskritists such as Sakya Pandita employed Vajrakīlaya. Further, he argues:\n\nit is possible, on the other hand, that the name Vajrakīlaya as favoured by the Tibetans could in fact have been the form that was actually used in the original Indic sources, and that there is no need to hypothesize a correct form \"Vajrakīla\". \"Vajrakīlaya\" could have come from the second person singular active, causative imperative, of the verb \"Kīl\". Indigenous grammar (Pāṇini Dhātupāṭha I.557) gives to \"Kīl\" the meaning of \"bandha\", i.e. \"to bind\", while Monier-Williams (285) gives the meanings \"to bind, fasten, stake, pin\". Hence the form kīlaya could mean \"you cause to bind/transfix!\", or \"bind/transfix!\". This, taken from mantras urging \"bind/transfix\", or \"may you cause to bind/transfix\", might have come to be treated as a noun; and the noun might then have become deified; hence Kīlaya might have started out as a deified imperative, in some ways comparable to the famous example of the deified vocative in the name Hevajra, and a not unheard of phenomenon in Sanskrit tantric literature. This suggestion is supported by Alexis Sanderson, a specialist in Sanskrit tantric manuscripts whom I consulted on this problem.Both the above suggestions are ungrammatical and incorrect from the point of view of Sanskrit grammar. Regarding the suggestion of Boord et al., the Sanskrit dative of \"kīla\" is \"kīlāya\", not \"kīlaya\". Mayer's suggestion would require compounding a noun (\"vajra\") and a nominal verb (\"kīlayati\") which is not a licit formation in Sanskrit. \"Vajraṃ kīlaya\" is a possible expression, but that is not the form under discussion. It seems possible to me that the Tibetan \"kīlaya\" is borrowed not from Sanskrit but from a Prakrit word \"kīlaya\" (<Skt. \"kīlaka\").\n\nThe fabrication of kīla is quite diverse. Having pommel, handle, and blade, kīla are often segmented into suites of triunes on both the horizontal and vertical axes, though there are notable exceptions. This compositional arrangement highlights the numerological importance and spiritual energy of the integers three (3) and nine (9). Kīla may be constituted and constructed of different materials and material components, such as wood, metal, clay, bone, gems, horn or crystal.\n\nLike the majority of traditional Tibetan metal instruments, the kīla is often made from brass and iron (terrestrial and/or meteoric iron. 'Thokcha' () means \"sky-iron\" in Tibetan and denote tektites and meteorites which are often high in iron content. Meteoric iron was highly prized throughout the Himalaya where it was included in sophisticated polymetallic alloys such as Panchaloha for ritual implements. The pommel of the kīla often bears three faces of Vajrakīla, one joyful, one peaceful, one wrathful, but may bear the umbrella of the ashtamangala or mushroom cap, ishtadevata (like Hayagriva), snow lion, or stupa, among other possibilities. The handle is often of a vajra, weaving or knotwork design. The handle generally has a triune form as is common to the pommel and blade. The blade is usually composed of three triangular facets or faces, meeting at the tip. These represent, respectively, the blade's power to transform the negative energies known as the \"three poisons\" or \"root poisons\" (Sanskrit: \"mula klesha\") of attachment/craving/desire, delusion/ignorance/misconception, and aversion/fear/hate.\n\nCantwell and Mayer (2008) have studied a number of texts recovered from the cache of the Dunhuang manuscripts that discuss the phurba and its ritual usage.\n\nThe kīla is one of many iconographic representations of divine \"symbolic attributes\" (Tibetan: \"phyag mtshan\")of Vajrayana and Hindu deities. When consecrated and bound for usage, the kīla are a nirmanakaya manifestation of Vajrakīlaya.\n\nChandra, \"et al.\" (1902: p. 37) in their Dictionary entry 'korkor' () \"coiled\" (English) relates that the text titled the 'Vaidūry Ngonpo' () has the passage: ཐག་བ་ཕུར་བ་ལ་ཀོར་ཀོར་བྱམ \"a string was wound round the (exorcist's) dagger [phurba].\"\n\nOne of the principal methods of working with the kīla and to actualize its essence-quality is to pierce the earth with it; sheath it; or as is common with Himalayan shamanic traditions, to penetrate it vertically, point down into a basket, bowl or cache of rice (or other soft grain if the kīla is wooden). The terms employed for the deity and the tool are interchangeable in Western scholarship. In the Himalayan shamanic tradition the kīla may be considered as axis mundi. Müller-Ebelling, \"et al.\" (2002) affirm that for the majority of Nepalese shaman, the kīla is cognate with the \"world tree\", either in their visualisations or in initiatory rites or other rituals.\n\nThe kīla is used as a ritual implement to signify stability on a prayer ground during ceremonies, and only those initiated in its use, or otherwise empowered, may wield it. The energy of the kīla is fierce, wrathful, piercing, affixing, transfixing. The kīla affixes the elemental process of 'Space' (Sanskrit: Ākāśa) to the Earth, thereby establishing an energetic continuum. The kīla, particularly those that are wooden are for shamanic healing, harmonizing and energy work and often have two nāgas (Sanskrit for snake, serpent and/or dragon, also refers to a class of supernatural entities or deities) entwined on the blade, reminiscent of the Staff of Asclepius and the Caduceus of Hermes. Kīla often also bear the ashtamangala, swastika, sauwastika and/or other Himalayan, Tantric or Hindu iconography or motifs.\n\nAs a tool of exorcism, the kīla may be employed to hold demons or thoughtforms in place (once they have been expelled from their human hosts, for example) in order that their mindstream may be re-directed and their inherent obscurations transmuted. More esoterically, the kīla may serve to bind and pin down negative energies or obscurations from the mindstream of an entity, person or thoughtform, including the thoughtform generated by a group, project and so on, to administer purification.\n\nThe kīla as an iconographical implement is also directly related to Vajrakilaya, a wrathful deity of Tibetan Buddhism who is often seen with his consort Diptacakra (Tib. 'khor lo rgyas 'debs ma). He is embodied in the kīla as a means of destroying (in the sense of finalising and then freeing) violence, hatred, and aggression by tying them to the blade of the kīla and then transmuting them with its tip. The pommel may be employed in blessings. It is therefore that the kīla is not a physical weapon, but a spiritual implement, and should be regarded as such. The kīla often bears the epithet Diamantine Dagger of Emptiness (see shunyata).\n\nAs Müller-Ebeling, \"et al.\" (2002: p. 55) states:\n\nThe magic of the Magical Dagger comes from the effect that the material object has on the realm of the spirit. The art of tantric magicians or lamas lies in their visionary ability to comprehend the spiritual energy of the material object and to willfully focus it in a determined direction. . . The tantric use of the phurba encompasses the curing of disease, exorcism, killing demons, meditation, consecrations (puja), and weather-making. The blade of the phurba is used for the destruction of demonic powers. The top end of the phurba is used by the tantrikas for blessings.\nAs Beer (1999: p. 277-278) states, transfixing kīla , charnel ground, scorpion and Padmasambhava:\n\nThe sting of the scorpion's whip-like tail transfixes and poisons its prey, and in this respect it is identified with the wrathful activity of the ritual dagger or kīla. Padmasambhava's biography relates how he received the siddhi of the kīla transmission at the great charnel ground of Rajgriha from a gigantic scorpion with nine heads, eighteen pincers and twenty-seven eyes. This scorpion reveals the kīla texts from a triangular stone box hidden beneath a rock in the cemetery. As Padmasambhava reads this terma text spontaneous understanding arises, and the heads, pincers, and eyes of the scorpion are 'revealed' as different vehicles or \"yanas\" of spiritual attainment. Here, at Rajgriha, Padmasambhava is given the title of 'the scorpion guru', and in one of his eight forms as Guru Dragpo or Pema Drago ('wrathful lotus'), he is depicted with a scorpion in his left hand. As an emblem of the wrathful kīla transmission the image of the scorpion took on a strong symbolic meaning in the early development of the Nyingma or 'ancient school' of Tibetan Buddhism...\".\nTo work with the spirits and deities of the earth, land and place, people of India, the Himalayas and the Mongolian Steppe pegged, nailed and/or pinned down the land. The nailing of the kīla is comparable to the idea of breaking the earth (turning the sod) in other traditions and the rite of laying the foundation stone. It is an ancient shamanic idea that has common currency throughout the region; it is prevalent in the Bön tradition and is also evident in the Vajrayana tradition. According to shamanic folklore current throughout the region, \"...the mountains were giant pegs that kept the Earth in place and prevented it from moving.\" (Kerrigan, \"et al.\", 1998: p27) Mountains such as Amnye Machen, according to folklore were held to have been brought from other lands just for this purpose. Stupa (compare cairn) are a development of this tradition and akin to kīla.\n\n(Kerrigan, \"et al.\", 1998: p27) states that:\n\n\"Prayer flags and stone pillars throughout the country also pierce the land. Even the pegs of the nomads’ yak wool tents are thought of as sanctifying the ground that lies beneath...\".\n\nTraditions such as that of the kīla may be considered a human cultural universal in light of foundation stone rites and other comparable rites documented in the disciplines of anthropology and ethnography; e.g., turning of the soil as a placation and votive offering to spirits of place and to preparation of the land as a rite to ensure fertility and bountiful yield.\n\nIn the Kathmandu Valley, the kīla is still in usage by shamans, magicians, tantrikas and lamas of different ethnic backgrounds. The kīla is used particularly intensively by the Tamang, Gurung and Newari Tibeto-Burmese tribes. The kīla is also employed by the Tibetans native to Nepal (the Bhotyas), the Sherpas, and the Tibetans living in Dharamasala.\n\nMüller-Ebelling, \"et al.\" (2002: p. 29) chart the difference of the kīla traditions between the \"jhankris\" and the \"gubajus\":\n\nThe phurbas of the gubajus are different from those of the jhankris. As a rule, they have only one head on which there is a double vajra as shown here. Gubajus focus on the head as a mirror image of themselves in order to meditatively connect with the power of the phurba. The three or more heads of the upper area of the phurba indicate the collection of energies that the jhankris use.\n\nA \"Bhairab kīla\" is an important healing tool of the tantric Newari gubajus. As Müller-Ebelling, \"et al.\" (2002: p. 55) state:\n\nTantric priests (guruju) use Bhairab phurbas for the curing of disease and especially for curing children's diseases. For these cases the point of the phurba blade is dipped into a glass or a bowl of water, turned and stirred. The sick child is then given the magically charged water as medicine to drink.\nMüller-Ebelling, \"et al.\" (2002: p. ?) interviewed Mohan Rai. (Mohan Rai is a shaman from the border area of Nepal and Bhutan and belongs to the Mongolian people of the Rai and/or Kirati. Mohan Rai is the founder of the Shamanistic Studies and Research Centre, Baniya Goun, Naikap, Kathmandu, Nepal) who in an interview is directly quoted as saying:\n'Without the phurba inside himself, the shaman has no consciousness'...'The shaman himself is the phurba; he assumes its form in order to fly into other worlds and realities.'\n\nTherefore to extrapolate, the kīla is identified with consciousness and the root of sentience, the buddha-nature.\n\nMüller-Ebelling \"et al.\" (2002) affirm that some Kukri may be considered kīla, as ultimately, everything that approximates a vertical form. The kīla then is a phallic polysemy and cognate with lingam ~ the generative instrument of Shiva that is metonymic of the primordial energy of the Universe. The kīla as lingam, actualizes the yoni essence-quality of whatever it penetrates.\n\nThe wrathful heruka Vajrakilaya is a meditation deity who embodies the energetic 'activity' (Wylie: phrin las) of all the buddhas, manifesting in a powerful and wrathful yet compassionate form in order to subjugate the delusion and negativity that can arise as obstacles to the practice of Dharma.\n\nDzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche on the practice of Vajrakilaya states that:\n\n\"Vajrakilaya, or kīla, means something sharp, and something that pierces – a dagger. A dagger that is so sharp it can pierce anything, while at the same time nothing can pierce it. That is the quality. This sharp and piercing energy is what is used to practice and out of the many infinite, endless Vajrayana methods this happens to be one of most important methods.\"\n\nVajrakilaya is a significant Vajrayana deity who transmutes and transcends obstacles and obscurations. Vajrakila is the divine 'thoughtform' () that governs the kīla. Padmasambhava achieved realisation through practicing 'Yangdag Heruka' (Tibetan: \"yang dag he ru ka\") but only after combining it with the practice of Vajrakilaya to clean and clear obstacles and obscurations.\n\nVajrakilaya is also understood as the embodiment of activities of the Buddha mind. Sometimes Vajrakilaya is perceived as the wrathful vajrayana form of Vajrapani, according to Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche. Many great masters both in India and Tibet, but especially in Tibet, have practiced Vajrakilaya (especially in the Nyingma lineage, and among the Kagyu and also within the Sakyapas). The Sakyapa's main deity, besides Hevajra is Vajrakumara or Vajrakilaya.\n\nJamyang Khyentse Wangpo, Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, Dudjom Rinpoche and a significant number of lamas within the Kagyu and Nyingma engaged Vajrakilaya sadhana.\n\nVajrakilaya (also known as \"Vajrakumara\") is the deity of the magic thundernail, the kīla, a tool of the sharp adamantine point of dharmakaya, a wisdom forded through the power of one-pointed concentration. This 'one-pointed' (Sanskrit: \"eka graha\") focus is a concerted mindfulness on the unity and interdependence of all dharmas. This one-pointed focus is understood as 'applying oneself fully' (Tibetan: \"sgrim pa\"). The three pointed blade represents delusion, attachment and aversion transformation. Vajrakilaya is a favoured tantric archetypal deity embraced by the Nyingmapa. The awesome and wrathful manifestation of this empty yet apparent deity assists practitioners in clearing the obstructions to realisation.\n\nA common manifestation of Vajrakilla has three heads, six arms, and four legs. Vajrakilaya's three right hands except for the right front one held vajras with five and nine prongs. The right front one makes a mudra as granting boons with open palm. Vajrakilaya's three left hands hold a flaming triple wishfulfilling jewel or triratna, a trident and the kilaya. Vajrakilaya's back is covered by the freshly flayed skin of the elephant representing 'ignorance' (Sanskrit: avidya; Wylie: marigpa), with the legs tied in front. A human skin is tied diagonally across his chest with the hands lying flat on Vajrakilaya's stomach and solar plexus representing the flailed ego that has released its powerful grip obscuring the 'qualities' of the Sadhaka. Qualities are represented iconographically by the 'vortex' (Sanrkit: chakra; Wylie: Khorlo) of the Manipura (Sanskrit: Maṇipūra). A rope ripples over his body with severed heads hanging by their hair representing the Akshamala or 'garland of bija' (Sanskrit: Varnamala). A knee length loin cloth winds around his belly belted with a tiger skin complete with tail, claws and head. This deity wears manifold nāga adornments and jewellery: naga earrings, naga bracelets, naga anklets and a naga cord over his chest, sometimes referred to as a naga gurdle and a naga hairpiece or hair ornament. Vajrakilaya's faces are round and small compared to the tall body. Despite the large fangs and bulging eyes and his wrathful appearance, Vajrakilaya is perceived as having a benevolent demeanor.\n\nAlthough at one point the Indic origin of kīla practice was widely questioned, Boord claims that \"the existence of a Kīla cult among the Buddhists in eighth century India...must now surely be accepted as established\" and further claims that it has been \"conclusively demonstrated that all the basic doctrines and rituals of Vajrakīla had their origin in India.\" Robert Mayer, one of the leading scholars of the kīla literature, shares the same view, writing that prior research had been plagued by \"elementary misunderstandings\" based on a lack of familiarity with crucial Indic primary sources. Mayer says of Boord's work, \"our understandings of the deity are quite similar\" insofar as both do not doubt that \"the phur-pa and the deity are Indic.\" \n\nTibetan tradition, which Boord credits as generally credible, holds that the entire corpus of Indian kīla lore was systematized by\nPadmasambhava, Vimalamitra, and the Nepali Śīlamañju, while on retreat together at \"Yang-le-shod\" (present-day Pharping, Nepal). According to Boord, \"it was precisely during this retreat that the many strands of kila lore were finally woven together into a coherent masterpiece of tantric Buddhism and thus it helps to illuminate the process by which tantric methods were being related to soteriology at this time. Beautifully codified in terms of both theory and practice, this divine scheme of meditation and magic was subsequently transmitted to Tibet and became established there as one of the major modes of religious engagement. So much so, in fact, that many previous writers on Tibet have actually assumed the kila cult to be of Tibetan origin.\" Renowned Tibetologist and Buddhologist Herbert Guenther concurred in a review of Boord's work, concluding that his \"careful research of all available texts relevant to the study of this figure\" was \"much needed and long overdue\" in correcting longstanding \"misrepresentation of historical facts.\"\n\nBeer (1999: p. 246) conveys the entwined relationship of Vajrakilaya with Samye, the propagation of Secret Mantra in Tibet, and the importance of the sadhana to both Padmasambhava's enlightenment, and his twenty-five 'heart disciples', who are of the mindstreams of the principal terton (according to Nyingma tradition):\n\nIn the biography of Padmasambhava it is recorded that he travelled to the northern land of Kashakamala, where the cult of the kīla prevailed. Later, whilst meditating on the deity Yangdak Heruka (Skt. Vishuddha Heruka) in the 'Asura Cave' at Parping in the Kathmandu valley, he experienced many obstructions from the \"maras\", and in order to subjugate them he request the \"Kīla Vitotama Tantras\" to be brought from India. Having established the first Tibetan monastery at Samye, the first transmission that Padmasambhava gave to his 25 'heart disciples', in order to eliminate the hindrances to the propagation of the \"buddhadharma\" in Tibet, were the teachings of the \"Vajrakilaya Tantra\". From its early Nyingma origins the practice of Vajrakilaya as a \"yidam\" deity with the power to cut through any obstructions was absorbed into all schools of Tibetan Buddhism.\nThere are a number of terma teachings founded on Vajrakilaya. For instance, there are treasure teachings from Jigme Lingpa, Ratna Lingpa and Nyang-rel Nyima Ozer.\n\nVajrakilaya Puja has long unbroken lineage within the Sakyapa. Vajrakilaya Puja was received by Khön Nagendra Rakshita and his younger sibling Vajra Ratna from Padmasambhava. Since then it has been transmitted in the Khön lineage and has been enacted every year until the present. Even in the challenging times of 1959 the Sakya Trizin maintained the tradition.\n\nThe Rigpa Sangha of Sogyal Rinpoche practises several Vajrakilaya sadhanas. The empowerment of Khön Tradition of Vajrakilaya has been given to the Rigpa sangha by H.H. Sakya Trizin at Lerab Ling, 22–23 June 2007.\n\nContemporary Bon has \"at least nine traditions of Phur pa,\" according to one scholar.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "13674692", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13674692", "title": "Love of God", "text": "Love of God\n\nLove of God can mean either love for God or love by God. Love for God (\"philotheia\") is associated with the concepts of worship, and devotions towards God.\n\nThe Greek term \"theophilia\" means the love or favour of God, and \"theophilos\" means friend of God, originally in the sense of being loved by God or loved by the gods; but is today sometimes understood in the sense of showing love for God.\n\nThe Greek term \"agape\" is applied both to the love that human beings have for God and to the love that God has for man.\n\nThe teachings of the Bahá'í Faith hold that the love of God (\"philanthropia\") is the primary reason for human creation, and one of the primary purposes of life. The love of God purifies human hearts and through it humans become transformed and self-sacrificing, as they reflect more the attributes and qualities of God. `Abdu'l-Bahá, the son of the founder of the religion wrote:\n\"There is nothing greater or more blessed than the \"Love of God\"! It gives healing to the sick, balm to the wounded, joy and consolation to the whole world, and through it alone can man attain Life Everlasting. The essence of all religions is the Love of God, and it is the foundation of all the sacred teachings.\"\n\nThe Old Testament uses a rich vocabulary to express the love of God, as a concept that appears in many instances. The Lord expresses his love through the Old Testament prophet Jeremiah and says, \"I have loved you with an everlasting love; I have drawn you with loving kindness\" (Jeremiah 31:3). However, the exegesis of the love of God in the Old Testament has presented problems for modern scholars. The love of God appears in a number of texts (e.g. Hosea 1–3, and then in Ezek 16 and Isa 62) but resolving the references to produce a consistent interpretation has been challenging and subject to debate.\n\nBoth the terms love of God and love of Christ appear in the New Testament. In cases such as in Romans 8:35 and their use is related in the experience of the believer, without asserting their equality. In Jesus expresses his love for God the Father. This verse includes the only direct statement by Jesus in the New Testament about Jesus' love for God the Father.\n\nIn polytheism, that which is loved by the gods (τὸ θεοφιλές) was identified as the virtuous or pious. Socrates famously asked whether this identification is a tautology (see \"Euthyphro dilemma\").\n\nIn Greek, \"philotheos\" means \"loving God, pious\", as \"philosophos\" means a lover of wisdom (\"sophia\"). , using the word \"philotheos\" in the plural form, speaks of certain people as φιλήδονοι μᾶλλον ἢ φιλόθεοι (lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God). The word \"Theophilos\" was and is used as a proper name, but does not appear as an adjective or common noun in Greek, which uses instead the form \"theophilês,\" which means \"dear to God\" but also \"loving God\".\n\nHowever, Eric Voegelin used \"theophilos\" to mean \"lover of God\": \"In the \"Phaedrus\", Plato has Socrates describe the characteristics of the true thinker. When Phaedrus asks what one should call such a man, Socrates, following Heraclitus, replies that the term \"sophos\", one who knows, would be excessive: this attribute may be applied to God alone: but one might well call him \"philosophos\", a lover of wisdom. Thus in the classic sense and reference of 'philosophy', actual knowledge is reserved to God; finite man can only be the lover of knowledge, not himself the one who possesses knowledge. In the meaning of the passage, the lover of the knowledge that belongs only to the knowing God, the \"philosophos\", becomes the \"theophilos\", the lover of God.\"\n\nIn Hinduism, in contrast to kāma, which is selfish, or pleasurable love, prema – or prem – refers to elevated love. Karuna is compassion and mercy, which impels one to help reduce the suffering of others. Bhakti is a Sanskrit term, meaning \"loving devotion to the supreme God\". A person who practices bhakti is called a bhakta. Hindu writers, theologians, and philosophers have distinguished nine forms of bhakti, which can be found in the Bhagavata Purana and works by Tulsidas. The philosophical work Narada Bhakti Sutras, written by an unknown author (presumed to be Narada), distinguishes eleven forms of love.\n\nOn the mystic side of Hinduism, one of the forms of Yoga includes Ishvarapranidhana, or self-surrender to God, and his worship.\n\nDevotees of Krishna worship him in different emotional, transcendental raptures, known as \"rasas\". Two major systems of Krishna worship developed, each with its own philosophical system. These two systems are \"aishwaryamaya bhakti\" and \"madhuryamaya bhakti\". \"Aishwaryamaya bhakti\" is revealed in the abode of queens and kingdom of Krishna in Dwaraka. \"Madhuryamaya Bhakti\" is revealed in the abode of \"Braja\". Thus Krishna is variously worshipped according to the development of devotee's taste in worshipping the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Sri Krishna, as father, friend, master, beloved and many different varieties which are all extraordinary. Krishna is famous as \"Makhanchor\", or butter thief. He loved to eat butter and is the beloved of his little village in Gokul. These are all transcendental descriptions. Thus they are revealed to the sincere devotees in proportion to the development in their love of Godhead. Vaishnavism is a form of monotheism, sometimes described as 'polymorphic monotheism', with implication that there are many forms of one original deity, defined as belief in a single unitary deity who takes many forms. In Krishnaism this deity is Krishna, sometimes referred as intimate deity – as compared with the numerous four-armed forms of Narayana or Vishnu. It may refer to either of the interrelated concepts of the love of God towards creation, the love of creatures towards God or relationship between the two as in bhakti.\n\nThe love of God, and the fear of God, are two of the foundations of Islam. The highest spiritual attainment in Islam is related to the love of God. \"Yet there are men who take (for worship) others besides God, as equal (with God): They love them as they should love God. But those of Faith are overflowing in their love for God.\" (Quran 2:165)Another Islamic concept is that Gods love leads towards good deeds \"And feed with food the needy, the orphan and the prisoner, for love of Him (ie. God).\"\n\nIslam, as Christianity, has numerous mystics and traditions about the love of God, as in:\n\nThe concept of Divine Love, known as \"Ishq-e-Haqeeqi\" (Persian), is elaborated by many great Muslim saints to date. Some Sufi writers and poets may have taken human love as a metaphor to define Divine Love but the prominent mystics explain the concept in its entirety and reveal its hardcore reality. Rabia Basri, the famous 7th century mystic, is known as the first female to have set the doctrine of Divine Love. In Islamic Sufism, Ishq means to love God selflessly and unconditionally. For Rumi, 'Sufism' itself is Ishq and not the path of asceticism (zuhd). According to Sultan Bahoo, Ishq means to serve God by devoting one's entire life to Him and asking no reward in return.\n\nThe love of God has been called the \"essence of Judaism\". \"And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might.\" ()\n\nGoethe expresses the sentiment of love of God alongside the opposite sentiment of hatred of God in his two poems Ganymed and Prometheus, respectively.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "36309813", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36309813", "title": "Mangrove restoration", "text": "Mangrove restoration\n\nMangrove restoration is the regeneration of mangrove forest ecosystems in areas where they have previously existed. The practice of mangrove restoration is grounded in the discipline of restoration ecology, which aims to “[assist] the recovery of resilience and adaptive capacity of ecosystems that have been degraded, damaged, or destroyed”. Since environmental impacts are an ongoing threat, to successfully restore an ecosystem implies not merely to recreate its former condition, but to strengthen its capacity to adapt to change over time.\n\nMangrove forests, along with the animal species they shelter, represent globally significant sources of biodiversity and provide humanity with valuable ecosystem services. They are used by mammals, reptiles and migratory birds as feeding and breeding grounds, and provide crucial habitats for fish and crustacean species of commercial importance. The roots of the mangrove physically buffer shorelines from the erosive impacts of ocean waves and storms. Additionally, they protect riparian zones by absorbing floodwaters and slowing down the flow of sediment-loaded river water. This allows sediments to drop to the bottom where they are held in place, thus containing potentially toxic waste products and improving the quality of water and sanitation in coastal communities.\n\nTo the human communities who rely on them, mangrove forests represent local sources of sustainable income from the harvest of fish and timber, as well as non-timber forest products such as medicinal plants, palm leaves and honey. On a global scale, they have been shown to sequester carbon in quantities comparable to higher-canopy terrestrial rainforests, which means that they may play a role in climate change mitigation, in addition to physically protecting coastlines from the projected sea-level rise associated with climate change. However, there are limits to the capacity of mangroves to adapt to climate change. It is projected that a 1-meter rise in sea level could inundate and destroy mangrove forests in many regions around the globe, which would leave coastal communities vulnerable to the risks of flooding, shoreline erosion, saline intrusion and increased storm activity.\n\nThe issue of restoration is critical today since mangrove forests are being lost very quickly – at an even faster rate than tropical rainforests inland. A recent estimate puts the total mangrove area worldwide in 2005 at 152,000 km – down from 188,000 km in 1980. In other words, some 36,000 km, or nearly 20% of the world's mangroves, were lost over a period of twenty-five years. Other estimates of loss may differ due to having been drawn from a smaller pool of data. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment estimates the total loss worldwide at 35% between 1980 and 2000, but this result was drawn from data on only slightly more than half of the total mangrove area. Much of this lost mangrove area was destroyed to make room for industry, housing and tourism development; for aquaculture, primarily shrimp farms; and for agriculture, such as rice paddies, livestock pasture and salt production. Other drivers of mangrove forest destruction include activities that divert their sources of freshwater, such as groundwater withdrawals, the building of dams, and the building of roads and drainage canals across tidal flats.\n\nMangroves are sensitive ecosystems, changing dynamically in response to storms, sediment blockage, and fluctuations in sea level and present a “moving target” for restoration efforts. Different restoration approaches face this challenge in different ways. The most common method simply consists in planting single-species stands of mangroves in areas thought to be suitable, without consideration of whether or not they supported mangroves in the past. This approach usually fails over the long term because the underlying soil and hydrological requirements of the mangroves are not being met. More informed methods aim to bring a damaged mangrove area back into its preexisting condition, taking into account not only ecosystem factors but also social, cultural and political perspectives. These approaches begin with the understanding that a damaged mangrove area may be able to repair itself through the natural processes of secondary succession, without being physically planted, provided that its tidal and freshwater hydrology is functioning normally and there is an adequate supply of seedlings.\nTaking this into account, it becomes crucial to the success of a restoration project to evaluate what the hydrology of a disturbed mangrove site should look like under normal conditions, and the ways in which it has been modified.\nOne example of this approach is the Ecological Mangrove Restoration method which recommends the following steps, to be undertaken using healthy mangroves of the surrounding area as a reference: \nThe actual planting of seedlings is a last resort, since it fails in many cases; it should be considered only if natural recruitment of seedlings fails to reach the restoration objective.\n\nAn important but often overlooked aspect of mangrove restoration efforts is the role that the local communities play as stakeholders in the process and the outcome. Since they may directly feel the effects of restoration projects, they should be involved in the process as much as feasibly possible, from decision-making to maintenance over the long term. Their involvement and local knowledge, as well as collaboration with other stakeholders such as sponsors and governing agencies, is crucial to the success of restoration projects.\n\nIn some areas, restoration may be prohibitively difficult due to the degradation of the soil that regularly follows the clear-cutting of mangrove forests. Common effects include advanced erosion of the soil, loss of nutrients, high levels of salinity, and/or buildup of toxins. However, even without this extent of degradation, the soil may become unable to host plant life at all due to the loss of the live mangrove roots, which exuded oxygen and carbohydrate into the soil and maintained its quality. Using foresight early in the restoration process to carefully select sites that are likely to succeed as self-maintaining ecosystems, as well as ensuring that proper management is built into the conservation effort, can prevent the waste of time and energy that often accompanies restoration projects. The long-lasting aftereffects of mangrove degradation underscore the importance of eliminating its causes, since once sites are cleared, it is difficult for them to recover without a scientific intervention.\n\n"}

From 1972 until his death he was Richard Koret Professor of Philosophy at Brandels University.\n\nMorris Weitz was born on July 24, 1916 in Detroit, his parents having emigrated from Europe (and his father having worked as a painting contractor). He was husband to Margaret (née) Collins (\"an author and renowned scholar of French women, French culture and the French Resistance\") and the father of three children, Richard, David, and Catherine (the former being a director of the Center for Political-Military Analysis and a Senior Fellow at the Hudson Institute). Morris Weitz died on February the 1st of 1981, in hospital in Roxbury after a long illness aged 64 having lived latterly in Newton, Massachusetts.\n\nWeitz obtained his BA in 1938 from Wayne State University. While doing graduate work in French history at the University of Chicago he met Bertrand Russell, which directed Weitz's interests towards philosophy. He received his Masters and, in 1943, his Phd in philosophy from the University of Michigan with a dissertation titled \"The Method of Analysis in the Philosophy of Bertrand Russell\". During the course of his career he taught philosophy at the University of Washington (1944–5), Vassar College (1945–8), and Ohio State University (1954–69). In 1969 Weitz moved to Brandeis University where, in 1972, he was named Richard Koret Professor of Philosophy in 1972, a position he retained until his death. He was also a visiting professor at Columbia, Cornell, and Harvard. He was recognised with a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1959, and was also honored as a Fulbright Senior Scholar.\n\nWeitz spent a year in Oxford which led to lifelong friendships with Oxford philosophers such as Gilbert Ryle, H.L.A. Hart, and Isaiah Berlin and, in 1953, the publication in \"The Philosophical Review\" of \"Oxford Philosophy\" (1953). In the same, according to Aaron W. Meskin writing in \"The Dictionary of Modern American Philosophers,\"\"Weitz argued that postwar Oxford philosophy was not unified by any general meta-philosophical position but rather by a commitment to investigating the logic of concepts\". Meskin notes that this \"was a significant publication in the United States as it served for many as an introduction to postwar Oxford philosophy\". Meskin suggests the work also \"illuminates the course of Weitz’s career\" - the \"task of elucidating both ordinary and technical concepts\" becoming central to his philosophical pursuits and his philosophical method becoming \"one of conceptual analysis, so long as this pursuit is not understood to be predicated on the goal of providing necessary and sufficient conditions\".\n\nWeitz is perhaps best known for his \"influential and frequently anthologized\" 1956 paper \"The Role of Theory in Aesthetics\" which was to win him a 1955 Matchette Prize (an award now replaced by the American Philosophical Association book and article prizes). This essay explicitly modified the theory of art initially provided in his 1950 book \"Philosophy of the Arts\" which had been \"[s]ubject to devastating criticisms from Margaret McDonald among others\". In \"The Role of Theory in Aesthetics\" Weitz \"overturned his original claim.. that his empirical and organic theory could produce a closed or real definition of art\" according to Aili Bresnahan and it is \"this revised version that many philosophers have considered the \"sine qua non\" in support of the position that theories of art should be 'open'\". Supporters of Weitz's later view \"for similar but non-identical reasons\" include W.B. Gallie, W. E. Kennick and Benjamin R. Tilghman and detractors include M.H. Abrams, M.W. Beal, Lee Brown, George Dickie, and Maurice Mandelbaum.\n\nMandelbaum in his 1965 paper \"Family Resemblances and Generalizations Concerning the Arts\" refers to Weitz's paper and includes its author amongst those who, in support of the contention \"that it is a mistake to attempt to discuss what art, or beauty, or the aesthetic, or a poem, essentially is... have made \"explicit use of Wittgenstein's doctrine of family resemblances\". Mandelbaum claims that though he has \"placed this at the forefront of his discussion.. Professor Weitz [has] made no attempt to analyze, clarify, or defend the doctrine itself\".\n\nWeitz's 1956 paper has been, as Meskin notes, \"one of the most influential works in contemporary philosophy of art, and.. continues to generate debate and discussion\".\n\n\n"}

The essence of new hermeneutic emphasizes not only the existence of language but also the fact that language is eventualized in the history of individual life. This is called the event of language. Ernst Fuchs, Gerhard Ebeling, and James M. Robinson are the scholars who represent the new hermeneutics. And it is said that language event (German: \"Sprachereignis\", the word event) occurs continuously, not that the interpreter insists on the text, but the text continually asserts the interpreter. Fuchs' concern is not to ask for the meaning of the text, but to learn how to listen to unobtrusive language about human beings' existence according to the hermeneutical help given with the texts itself. Fuchs' achievement lay in bringing the insights of Karl Barth, Rudolf Bultmann, and Martin Heidegger into fruitful conjunction. He sought to bridge Barth's Calvinist emphasis on the revealed Word of God with Rudolf Bultmann's Lutheran emphasis on the nature of human existence before God by employing a phenomenology of language derived in part from Heidegger's later position, arguing that both human existence and the bring of God are ultimately linguistic-made available in language - and that theology is thus properly \"faith's doctrine of language\"(Sprachlehre des Glaubens). Theology's task is essentially hermeneutical, i.t., theology translates Scripture into contemporary terms and contemporary existence into scriptural terms. Fuchs' interests is language event with existential philosophy. Conversely, the reality of God's love is verbalized in Jesus' word and deeds recorded in the Gospels and is thus preserved as language gain (Sprachgewinn). In the freedom of proclamation God's presence in the gospel and the \"Yes of love: happens again - that is, comes to be as language, opening up the future to authentic existence (faith, hope, and love).\n\n\n"}

Her works has been translated into several languages.\n\nBorn 19 September 1960 in Lutsk, Ukraine, Zabuzhko studied philosophy at the Kiev University, where she also obtained her doctorate in aesthetics in 1987. In 1992 she taught at Penn State University as a visiting writer. Zabuzhko won a Fulbright scholarship in 1994 and taught Ukrainian literature at Harvard and University of Pittsburgh. Currently Zabuzhko works at the Hryhori Skovoroda Institute of Philosophy of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine.\n\nAccording to Uilleam Blacker, Oksana Zabuzhko’s work has two main preoccupations: national identity and gender. Zabuzhko’s first novel, \"Field Work in Ukrainian Sex\", published in 1996, was met with great controversy both by the critics and by the readers. With its publication, the Ukrainian readership and the intellectual community faced innovative, provocative and complex feminist writing.\n\nAs a trained philosopher and cultural critic, Zabuzhko publishes essays and non-fiction works. Zabuzhko also turns to the Ukrainian history. Her most recent novel, \"The Museum of Abandoned Secrets\" (2009), deals with three different epochs (World War II, 1970s, and early 2000s), and, in particular, the topic of Ukrainian Insurgent Army, active in Ukraine in the 1940s and 1950s, and either demonized or silenced by the Soviet historiography.\n\nOksana Zabuzhko belongs to the generation that Tamara Hundorova, a literary scholar, calls «post-Chornobyl». Chornobyl catastrophe (1986), according to Hundorova, is not only one of the biggest calamities of the modern times, but also a «symbolic event that projects post-apocalyptical text […] into the post-atomic era». Most importantly, Chornobyl also marks, de facto, the end of the Soviet Union, at least the end of any legitimacy of its ideology, and the beginning of the new Ukrainian society and new Ukrainian literature, free from socialist realism or consciously dismantling its legacy. One important feature of Oksana Zabuzhko’s writing is that it is «turned outward» to the world, to be accessible to the Western reader.\n\n\nOksana Zabuzhko’s first novel, \"Field Work in Ukrainian Sex\", is one of the key texts in post-Soviet Ukrainian literature. It caused great controversy upon its publication, due the fact that the narrator expresses dissatisfaction with the established order of relationships between sexes, where a woman is subject to oppression, social and sexual, both by the traditional patriarchy, as a gendered subject, as well as a subject of totalitarianism. The novel was analyzed from the point of view of postcolonial theory. It also inspired a number of comparative studies, where Zabuzhko’s novel was compared to the writings of Jamaica Kincaid, Assia Djebar, Angela Carter, Nicole Brossard, and others. The novel was also studied on account of its prominent style, with the «poetic» voice and the «intellectual» voice intermingling and creating an intricate structure. The novel engages some elements of \"écriture féminine\", notably, writing (from) the body.\n\nOksana Zabuzhko’s second novel, \"Museum of Abandoned Secrets\", deals with Ukraine’s resistance and opposition to the Soviet colonial regime in the 20th century. The novel presents the reality of the relations between the countries that within the structure of the USSR were seen by the West only in the context of the myth of the «friendships of nations», the myth that Putin’s Russia would still like to perpetuate.\n\nOksana Zabuzhko’s most famous non-fiction book is \"Notre Dame d’Ukraine\". It focuses on the Ukrainian writer of the fin-de-siècle era, Lesya Ukrayinka (1871-1913), but is also a study of the Ukrainian intelligentsia of that time and their cultural values. More specifically, in this groundbreaking volume Zabuzhko shows Ukraine’s European legacy in regard to the tradition of chivalry and the ways in which it shaped the Ukrainian literature and mentality.\n\nHer book \"Let My People Go\" won the Korrespondent magazine Best Ukrainian documentary book award in June 2006, \"The Museum of Abandoned Secrets\" — Best Ukrainian Book — 2010.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

A leading 20th-century teacher of Western Esotericism in Europe, he was a disciple of Peter Deunov (Beinsa Douno), the founder of the Universal White Brotherhood.\n\nHe was born Mikhail Dimitrov Ivanov in Srpci (then in the Manastir Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire), a village in Bitola Municipality in the present-day Republic of Macedonia, to a Bulgarian family. His father, Ivan Dimitrov established a coal business and died when Aivanhov was seven years old.\nHis mother, Dolya was a religious woman, who dedicated her son to God since his very early childhood. Like most Bulgarians who were the predominant ethnic element in the region of Macedonia during that time, the family of Mikhail Ivanov was persecuted by the Greek army after the end of the Balkan War. They were forced to leave their home in spring, 1907 due to destruction of the village. The family finally found shelter and settled in Varna, Bulgaria. At the age of 17, after a childhood passed in poverty, he met Master Peter Deunov (1864 - 1944), the founder of the Universal White Brotherhood in the city of Varna, Bulgaria. A few months later in 1918, he followed Master Deunov to the capital, Sofia.\nDuring the early years of his discipleship, Aivanhov was quite poor. He owned a bed, some books, a violin (given to him by Deunov) and a few shabby clothes. He spent most of his time on spiritual retreats in the mountains, where he studied and meditated, occasionally taking a job to earn his keep. Deunov also obliged him to broaden his conventional knowledge by pursuing studies at the University of Sofia, and he enrolled in courses on psychology, education philosophy, mathematics, chemistry, astronomy & medicine between 1923 and 1931. From around 1932 to around 1937, he worked as a school teacher and then a high school principal.\n\nIn 1937 with the approach of the Second World War, Peter Deunov foresaw that political unrest, war and the spread of communism would lead to a ban on all spiritual associations in Bulgaria and so he entrusted Mikhail Ivanov with bringing his teaching to France. Deunov chose Aivanhov out of 40,000 other students.\n\nOn July 22, 1937 he arrived in France penniless, with no knowledge of French and only one contact person in France, Stella Bellemin, a Bulgarian expatriate. However, Aivanhov turned out to be an excellent linguist. He took no money from his students or charged for his lectures apart from one exception when touring America. The money was banked and used later for a publishing project. On January 29, 1938, he gave his first public talk in the Luxembourg Hall, Place de la Sorbonne. This was the first of over 5000 conferences. In 1944 he published his first collection of talks. On January 21, 1948 he was arrested on a false charge and sentenced to 4 years in prison, but in March 1950 he was released.\n\nHe taught mainly in France, and he created the spiritual centers Bonfin in Fréjus, France and Izgrev, Sofia in his native Bulgaria, but also traveled a great deal. From 1938 until 1986 he gave some 4,500 talks in French, first of all in France (in Paris and its outskirts, and later at Fréjus in the Var region), and then in Switzerland (spiritual center Videlinata), Canada, the United States, India, Sweden and Norway. He also visited many other countries.\n\nHis works which include 44 pocketbooks and 32 complete works are based on his lectures, which were recorded first in shorthand and since 1960 on audio and video tape. Finally, in 1972 Prosveta Publications released several collections of these talks in the form of books and brochures (translated into 30 languages), CDs and DVDs with subtitles.\n\nIn 1959, he traveled to India, where he met saint, Neem Karoli Baba, whom Baba Ram Dass/Richard Alpert made famous in North America. Babaji referred to Aivanhov as 'the French Sadhu' The name Omraam was given to him by three sages who approached Aivanhov while he was in India, meditating and uttered the word 'Omraam' thereafter he was known as Omraam Mikhaël Aïvanhov. After this he allowed himself to be called \"Master\". He received French citizenship just before his death. He died on 25 December 1986 in Fréjus, France.\n\nAivanhov’s philosophy teaches that everybody, regardless of race, religion, social position, intellectual ability or material means, is able to take part in the realization of a new period of brotherhood and peace on earth. This happens through the individual's personal transformation: growth in perfection and in harmony with the divine world. Whatever the topic, he invariably focuses on how one can better conduct life on earth. Aivanhov taught that to achieve a better life, one must have a high ideal: \"... if you have a High Ideal, such as the bringing of the Kingdom of God on earth, you obtain everything you wished for, you taste plenitude.\"\n\nAïvanhov teaches the ancient principles of initiatic science. He describes the cosmic laws governing both the universe and the human being, the macrocosm and microcosm, and the exchanges that constantly take place between them.\n\nThis knowledge has taken different forms throughout the centuries. It is the perennial wisdom expressed through various religions, each adapted to the spirit of a particular time, people, and level of spiritual evolution. Aivanhov's teaching incorporates aspects of Esoteric Christianity that relate to finding the \"Kingdom of God on earth\" within the individual. One of the essential truths of initiatic science, according to Aivanhov, is that (in the higher world) all things are linked. Thus committing oneself to the Kingdom of God on earth makes it realizable: \"The real science is to form within ourselves, in the depths of our being, this Body that Initiates call the Body of Glory, the Body of Light, the Body of Christ.\"\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "199358", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=199358", "title": "Preposition and postposition", "text": "Preposition and postposition\n\nPrepositions and postpositions, together called adpositions (or broadly, in English, simply prepositions), are a class of words used to express spatial or temporal relations (\"in\", \"under\", \"towards\", \"before\") or mark various semantic roles (\"of\", \"for\").\n\nA preposition or postposition typically combines with a noun or pronoun, or more generally a noun phrase, this being called its complement, or sometimes object. A preposition comes before its complement; a postposition comes after its complement. English generally has prepositions rather than postpositions – words such as \"in\", \"under\" and \"of\" precede their objects, such as \"in England\", \"under the table\", \"of Jane\" – although there are a few exceptions including \"ago\" and \"notwithstanding\", as in \"three days ago\" and \"financial limitations notwithstanding\". Some languages that use a different word order, have postpositions instead, or have both types. The phrase formed by a preposition or postposition together with its complement is called a prepositional phrase (or postpositional phrase, adpositional phrase, etc.) – such phrases usually play an adverbial role in a sentence.\n\nA less common type of adposition is the circumposition, which consists of two parts that appear on each side of the complement. Other terms sometimes used for particular types of adposition include \"ambiposition\", \"inposition\" and \"interposition\". Some linguists use the word \"preposition\" in place of \"adposition\" regardless of the applicable word order.\n\nThe word \"preposition\" comes from (\"before\") and (\"to put\"). This refers to the situation in Latin and Greek (and in English), where such words are placed before their complement (except sometimes in Ancient Greek), and are hence \"pre-positioned\".\n\nIn some languages, including Sindhi, Urdu, Turkish, Hindi, Korean, and Japanese, the same kind of words typically come after their complement. To indicate this, they are called \"postpositions\" (using the prefix \"post-\", from Latin \"post\" meaning \"behind, after\"). There are also some cases where the function is performed by two parts coming before and after the complement; this is called a \"circumposition\" (from Latin \"circum\" \"around\").\n\nIn some languages, for example Finnish, some adpositions can be used as both prepositions and postpositions. \n\nPrepositions, postpositions and circumpositions are collectively known as \"adpositions\" (using the Latin prefix \"ad-\", meaning \"to\"). However, some linguists prefer to use the well-known and longer established term \"preposition\" in place of \"adposition\", irrespective of position relative to the complement.\n\nAn adposition typically combines with exactly one complement, most often a noun phrase (or, in a different analysis, a determiner phrase). In English, this is generally a noun (or something functioning as a noun, e.g., a gerund), together with its specifier and modifiers such as articles, adjectives, etc. The complement is sometimes called the object of the adposition. The resulting phrase, formed by the adposition together with its complement, is called an adpositional phrase or prepositional phrase (PP) (or for specificity, a postpositional or circumpositional phrase).\n\nAn adposition establishes a grammatical relationship that links its complement to another word or phrase in the context. It also generally establishes a semantic relationship, which may be spatial (\"in\", \"on\", \"under\", ...), temporal (\"after\", \"during\", ...), or of some other type (\"of\", \"for\", \"via\", ...). The World Atlas of Language Structures treats a word as an adposition if it takes a noun phrase as a complement and indicates the grammatical or semantic relationship of that phrase to the verb in the containing clause.\n\nSome examples of the use of English prepositions are given below. In each case, the prepositional phrase appears in \"italics\", the preposition within it appears in bold, and the preposition's complement is underlined. As demonstrated in some of the examples, more than one prepositional phrase may act as an adjunct to the same word.\n\nIn the last of these examples the complement has the form of an adverb, which has been nominalised to serve as a noun phrase; see Different forms of complement, below. Prepositional phrases themselves are sometimes nominalized:\n\nAn adposition may determine the grammatical case of its complement. In English, the complements of prepositions take the objective case where available (\"from him\", not *\"from he\"). In Koine Greek, for example, certain prepositions always take their objects in a certain case (e.g., ἐν always takes its object in the dative), while other prepositions may take their object in one of two or more cases, depending on the meaning of the preposition (e.g., διά takes its object in the genitive or in the accusative, depending on the meaning). Some languages have cases that are used exclusively after prepositions (prepositional case), or special forms of pronouns for use after prepositions (prepositional pronoun).\n\nThe functions of adpositions overlap with those of case markings (for example, the meaning of the English preposition \"of\" is expressed in many languages by a genitive case ending), but adpositions are classed as syntactic elements, while case markings are morphological.\n\nAdpositions themselves are usually non-inflecting (\"invariant\"): they do not have paradigms of form (such as tense, case, gender, etc.) the same way that verbs, adjectives, and nouns can. There are exceptions, though, such as prepositions that have fused with a pronominal object to form inflected prepositions.\n\nThe following properties are characteristic of most adpositional systems:\n\nAs noted above, adpositions are referred to by various terms, depending on their position relative to the complement.\n\nWhile the term \"preposition\" is sometimes used to denote any adposition, in its stricter meaning it refers only to one which precedes its complement. Examples of this, from English, have been given above; similar examples can be found in many European and other languages, for example:\n\nIn certain grammatical constructions, the complement of a preposition may be absent or may be moved from its position directly following the preposition. This may be referred to as preposition stranding (see also below), as in \"Whom did you go with?\" and \"There's only one thing worse than being talked about.\" There are also some (mainly colloquial) expressions in which a preposition's complement may be omitted, such as \"I'm going to the park. Do you want to come with [me]?\", and the French \"Il fait trop froid, je ne suis pas habillée pour\" (\"It's too cold, I'm not dressed for [the situation].\")\nThe bolded words in these examples are generally still considered prepositions, because when they form a phrase with a complement (in more ordinary constructions) they must appear first.\n\nA \"postposition\" follows its complement to form a postpositional phrase. Examples include:\n\nSome adpositions can appear either before or after their complement:\nAn adposition like the above, which can be either a preposition or a postposition, can be called an ambiposition. However, \"ambiposition\" may also be used to refer to a circumposition (see below), or to a word that appears to function as a preposition and postposition simultaneously, as in the Vedic Sanskrit construction (noun-1) \"ā\" (noun-2), meaning \"from (noun-1) to (noun-2)\".\n\nWhether a language has primarily prepositions or postpositions is seen as an aspect of its typological classification, and tends to correlate with other properties related to head directionality. Since an adposition is regarded as the head of its phrase, prepositional phrases are head-initial (or right-branching), while postpositional phrases are head-final (or left-branching). There is a tendency for languages that feature postpositions also to have other head-final features, such as verbs that follow their objects; and for languages that feature prepositions to have other head-initial features, such as verbs that precede their objects. This is only a tendency, however; an example of a language that behaves differently is Latin, which employs mostly prepositions, even though it typically places verbs after their objects.\n\nA \"circumposition\" consists of two or more parts, positioned on both sides of the complement. Circumpositions are very common in Pashto and Kurdish. The following are examples from Northern Kurdish (Kurmanji):\n\nVarious constructions in other languages might also be analyzed as circumpositional, for example:\nMost such phrases, however, can be analyzed as having a different hierarchical structure (such as a prepositional phrase modifying a following adverb). The Chinese example could be analyzed as a prepositional phrase headed by \"cóng\" (\"from\"), taking the locative noun phrase \"bīngxīang lǐ\" (\"refrigerator inside\") as its complement.\n\nAn inposition is a rare type of adposition that appears between parts of a complex complement. For example, in the native Californian Timbisha language, the phrase \"from a mean cold\" can be translated using the word order \"cold from mean\"—the inposition follows the noun but precedes any following modifiers that form part of the same noun phrase. The Latin word \"cum\" is also commonly used as an inposition, as in the phrase \"summa cum laude\", meaning \"with highest praise\", lit. \"highest with praise\".\n\nThe term interposition has been used for adpositions in structures such as \"word for word\", (French) \"coup sur coup\" (\"one after another, repeatedly\"), (Russian) друг с другом (\"one with the other\"). This is not a case of an adposition appearing inside its complement, as the two nouns do not form a single phrase (there is no phrase *\"word word\", for example); such uses have more of a coordinating character.\n\nPreposition stranding is a syntactic construct in which a preposition occurs somewhere other than immediately before its complement. For example, in the English sentence \"What did you sit on?\" the preposition \"on\" has \"what\" as its complement, but \"what\" is moved to the start of the sentence, because it is an interrogative word. This sentence is much more common and natural than the equivalent sentence without stranding: \"On what did you sit?\" Preposition stranding is commonly found in English, as well as North Germanic languages such as Swedish. Its existence in German and Dutch is debated. Preposition stranding is also found in some Niger–Congo languages such as Vata and Gbadi, and in some North American varieties of French.\n\nSome prescriptive English grammars teach that prepositions cannot end a sentence, although there is no rule prohibiting that use. Similar rules arose during the rise of classicism, when they were applied to English in imitation of classical languages such as Latin. Otto Jespersen, in his \"Essentials of English Grammar\" (first published 1933), commented on this definition-derived rule: \"...nor need a preposition (Latin: \"praepositio\") stand before the word it governs (go the fools \"among\" (Sh[akespeare]); What are you laughing \"at\"?). You might just as well believe that all blackguards are black or that turkeys come from Turkey; many names have either been chosen unfortunately at first or have changed their meanings in course of time.\"\n\nSimple adpositions consist of a single word (\"on\", \"in\", \"for\", \"towards\", etc.). Complex adpositions consist of a group of words that act as one unit. Examples of complex prepositions in English include \"in spite of\", \"with respect to\", \"except for\", \"by dint of\", and \"next to\".\n\nThe distinction between simple and complex adpositions is not clear-cut. Many simple adpositions are derived from complex forms (e.g., \"with + in\" → \"within\", \"by + side\" → \"beside\") through grammaticalisation. This change takes time, and during the transitional stages the adposition acts in some ways like a single word, and in other ways like a multi-word unit. For example, current German orthographic conventions recognize the indeterminate status of certain prepositions, allowing two spellings: \"anstelle\"/\"an Stelle\" (\"instead of\"), \"aufgrund\"/\"auf Grund\" (\"because of\"), \"mithilfe\"/\"mit Hilfe\" (\"by means of\"), \"zugunsten\"/\"zu Gunsten\" (\"in favor of\"), \"zuungunsten\"/\"zu Ungunsten\" (\"to the disadvantage of\"), \"zulasten/zu Lasten\" (\"at the expense of\").\n\nThe distinction between complex adpositions and free combinations of words is not a black and white issue: complex adpositions (in English, \"prepositional idioms\") can be more fossilized or less fossilized. In English, this applies to a number of structures of the form \"preposition + (article) + noun + preposition\", such as \"in front of\", \"for the sake of\". The following characteristics are good indications that a given combination is \"frozen\" enough to be considered a complex preposition in English:\n\nIn descriptions of some languages, prepositions are divided into proper (or \"essential\") and improper (or \"accidental\"). A preposition is called improper if it is some other part of speech being used in the same way as a preposition. Examples of simple and complex prepositions that have been so classified include \"prima di\" (\"before\") and \"davanti (a)\" (\"in front of\") in Italian, and \"ergo\" (\"on account of\") and \"causa\" (\"for the sake of\") in Latin. In reference to Ancient Greek, however, an improper preposition is one that cannot also serve as a prefix to a verb.\n\nAs noted above, adpositions typically have noun phrases as complements. This can include nominal clauses and certain types of non-finite verb phrase:\n\nThe word \"to\" when it precedes the infinitive in English is not a preposition, but rather is a grammatical particle outside of any main word class.\n\nIn other cases the complement may have the form of an adjective or adjective phrase, or an adverbial. This may be regarded as a complement representing a different syntactic category, or simply as an atypical form of noun phrase (see nominalization).\nIn the last example, the complement of the preposition \"from\" is in fact another prepositional phrase. The resulting sequence of two prepositions (\"from under\") may be regarded as a complex preposition; in some languages such a sequence may be represented by a single word, as Russian из-под \"iz-pod\" (\"from under\").\n\nSome adpositions appear to combine with two complements:\nIt is more commonly assumed, however, that \"Sammy\" and the following predicate forms a \"small clause\", which then becomes the single complement of the preposition. (In the first example, a word such as may be considered elided, which, if present, would clarify the grammatical relationship.)\n\nAdpositions can be used to express a wide range of semantic relations between their complement and the rest of the context. The relations expressed may be spatial (denoting location or direction), temporal (denoting position in time), or relations expressing comparison, content, agent, instrument, means, manner, cause, purpose, reference, etc.\n\nMost common adpositions are highly polysemous (they have various different meanings). In many cases a primary, spatial meaning becomes extended to non-spatial uses by metaphorical or other processes. Because of the variety of meanings, a single adposition often has many possible equivalents in another language, depending on the exact context in which it is used; this can cause significant difficulties in foreign language learning. Usage can also vary between dialects of the same language (for example, American English has \"on the weekend\", where British English uses \"at the weekend\").\n\nIn some contexts (as in the case of some phrasal verbs) the choice of adposition may be determined by another element in the construction or be fixed by the construction as a whole. Here the adposition may have little independent semantic content of its own, and there may be no clear reason why the particular adposition is used rather than another. Examples of such expressions are:\n\nPrepositions sometimes mark roles that may be considered largely grammatical:\n\nSpatial meanings of adpositions may be either \"directional\" or \"static\". A directional meaning usually involves motion in a particular direction (\"Kay went to the store\"), the direction in which something leads or points (\"A path into the woods\"), or the extent of something (\"The fog stretched from London to Paris\"). A static meaning indicates only a location (\"at the store\", \"behind the chair\", \"on the moon\"). Some prepositions can have both uses: \"he sat in the water\" (static); \"he jumped in the water\" (probably directional). In some languages, the case of the complement varies depending on the meaning, as with several prepositions in German, such as \"in\":\n\nIn English and many other languages, prepositional phrases with static meaning are commonly used as predicative expressions after a copula (\"Bob is at the store\"); this may happen with some directional prepositions as well (\"Bob is from Australia\"), but this is less common. Directional prepositional phrases combine mostly with verbs that indicate movement (\"Jay is going into her bedroom\", but not *\"Jay is lying down into her bedroom\").\n\nDirectional meanings can be further divided into \"telic\" and \"atelic\". Telic prepositional phrases imply movement all the way to the endpoint (\"she ran to the fence\"), while atelic ones do not (\"she ran towards the fence\").\n\nStatic meanings can be divided into \"projective\" and \"non-projective\", where projective meanings are those whose understanding requires knowledge of the perspective or point of view. For example, the meaning of \"behind the rock\" is likely to depend on the position of the speaker (projective), whereas the meaning of \"on the desk\" is not (non-projective). Sometimes the interpretation is ambiguous, as in \"behind the house\", which may mean either at the natural back of the house, or on the opposite side of the house from the speaker.\n\nThere are often similarities in form between adpositions and adverbs. Some adverbs are derived from the fusion of a preposition and its complement (such as \"downstairs\", from \"down (the) stairs\", and \"underground\", from \"under (the) ground\"). Some words can function both as adverbs and as prepositions, such as \"inside\", \"aboard\", \"underneath\" (for instance, one can say \"go inside\", with adverbial use, or \"go inside the house\", with prepositional use). Such cases are analogous to verbs that can be used either transitively or intransitively, and the adverbial forms might therefore be analyzed as \"intransitive prepositions\". This analysis could also be extended to other adverbs, such as \"here\", \"there\", \"afterwards\", etc., even though these never take complements.\n\nMany English phrasal verbs contain particles that are used adverbially, even though they mostly have the form of a preposition (such words may be called prepositional adverbs). Examples are \"on\" in \"carry on\", \"get on\", etc., \"over\" in \"take over\", \"fall over\", and so on. The equivalents in Dutch and German are separable prefixes, which also often have the same form as prepositions: for example, Dutch \"aanbieden\" and German \"anbieten\" (both meaning \"to offer\") contain the separable prefix \"aan/an\", which is also a preposition meaning \"on\" or \"to\".\n\nSome words can be used both as adpositions and as subordinating conjunctions:\nIt would be possible to analyze such conjunctions (or even other subordinating conjunctions) as prepositions that take an entire clause as a complement.\n\nIn some languages, including a number of Chinese varieties, many of the words that serve as prepositions can also be used as verbs. For instance, in Standard Chinese, 到 \"dào\" can be used in either a prepositional or a verbal sense:\nBecause of this overlap, and the fact that a sequence of prepositional phrase and verb phrase often resembles a serial verb construction, Chinese prepositions (and those of other languages with similar grammatical structures) are often referred to as coverbs.\n\nAs noted in previous sections, Chinese can also be said to have postpositions, although these can be analyzed as nominal (noun) elements. For more information, see the article on Chinese grammar, particularly the sections on coverbs and locative phrases.\n\nSome grammatical case markings have a similar function to adpositions; a case affix in one language may be equivalent in meaning to a preposition or postposition in another. For example, in English the agent of a passive construction is marked by the preposition \"by\", while in Russian it is marked by use of the instrumental case. Sometimes such equivalences exist within a single language; for example, the genitive case in German is often interchangeable with a phrase using the preposition \"von\" (just as in English, the preposition \"of\" is often interchangeable with the possessive suffix \" 's\").\n\nAdpositions combine syntactically with their complement, whereas case markings combine with a noun morphologically. In some instances it may not be clear which applies; the following are some possible means of making such a distinction:\n\nEven so, a clear distinction cannot always be made. For example, the post-nominal elements in Japanese and Korean are sometimes called case particles and sometimes postpositions. Sometimes they are analysed as two different groups because they have different characteristics (e.g., the ability to combine with focus particles), but in such analysis, it is unclear which words should fall into which group.\n\nTurkish and Finnish have both extensive case-marking and postpositions, but here there is evidence to help distinguish the two:\nIn these examples, the case markings form a word with their hosts (as shown by vowel harmony, other word-internal effects and agreement of adjectives in Finnish), while the postpositions are independent words. As is seen in the last example, adpositions are often used in conjunction with case affixes – in languages that have case, a given adposition usually takes a complement in a particular case, and sometimes (as has been seen above) the choice of case helps specify the meaning of the adposition.\n\n\n\n"}

Quantification in this sense is fundamental to the scientific method.\n\nSome measure of the undisputed general importance of quantification in the natural sciences can be gleaned from the following comments:\n\n\nThis meaning of quantification comes under the heading of pragmatics.\n\nIn some instances in the natural sciences a seemingly intangible concept may be quantified by creating a scale—for example, a pain scale in medical research, or a discomfort scale at the intersection of meteorology and human physiology such as the heat index measuring the combined perceived effect of heat and humidity, or the wind chill factor measuring the combined perceived effects of cold and wind.\n\nIn the social sciences, quantification is an integral part of economics and psychology. Both disciplines gather data – economics by empirical observation and psychology by experimentation – and both use statistical techniques such as regression analysis to draw conclusions from it.\n\nIn some instances a seemingly intangible property may be quantified by asking subjects to rate something on a scale—for example, a happiness scale or a quality of life scale—or by the construction of a scale by the researcher, as with the index of economic freedom. In other cases, an unobservable variable may be quantified by replacing it with a proxy variable with which it is highly correlated—for example, per capita gross domestic product is often used as a proxy for standard of living or quality of life.\n\nFrequently in the use of regression, the presence or absence of a trait is quantified by employing a dummy variable, which takes on the value 1 in the presence of the trait or the value 0 in the absence of the trait.\n\nQuantitative linguistics is an area of linguistics that relies on quantification. For example, indices of grammaticalization of morphemes, such as phonological shortness, dependence on surroundings, and fusion with the verb, have been developed and found to be significantly correlated across languages with stage of evolution of function of the morpheme.\n\nThe ease of quantification is one of the features used to distinguish hard and soft sciences from each other. Scientists often consider hard sciences to be more scientific or rigorous, but this is disputed by social scientists who maintain that appropriate rigor includes the qualitative evaluation of the broader contexts of qualitative data. In some social sciences such as sociology, quantitative data are difficult to obtain, either because laboratory conditions are not present or because the issues involved are conceptual but not directly quantifiable. Thus in these cases qualitative methods are preferred. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "9447566", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9447566", "title": "Rational consequence relation", "text": "Rational consequence relation\n\nIn logic, a rational consequence relation is a non-monotonic consequence relation satisfying certain properties listed below.\n\nA rational consequence relation formula_1 satisfies:\n\nand the so-called Gabbay-Makinson rules:\n\nThe rational consequence relation is non-monotonic, and the relation formula_9 is intended to carry the meaning \"theta usually implies phi\" or \"phi usually follows from theta\". In this sense it is more useful for modeling some everyday situations than a monotone consequence relation because the latter relation models facts in a more strict boolean fashion - something either follows under all circumstances or it does not.\n\nThe statement \"If a cake contains sugar then it tastes good\" implies under a monotone consequence relation the statement \"If a cake contains sugar and soap then it tastes good.\" Clearly this doesn't match our own understanding of cakes. By asserting \"If a cake contains sugar then it usually tastes good\" a rational consequence relation allows for a more realistic model of the real world, and certainly it does not automatically follow that \"If a cake contains sugar and soap then it usually tastes good.\"\n\nNote that if we also have the information \"If a cake contains sugar then it usually contains butter\" then we may legally conclude (under CMO) that \"If a cake contains sugar and butter then it usually tastes good.\". Equally in the absence of a statement such as \"If a cake contains sugar then usually it contains no soap\" then we may legally conclude from RMO that \"If the cake contains sugar and soap then it usually tastes good.\"\n\nIf this latter conclusion seems ridiculous to you then it is likely that you are subconsciously asserting your own preconceived knowledge about cakes when evaluating the validity of the statement. That is, from your experience you know that cakes which contain soap are likely to taste bad so you add to the system your own knowledge such as \"Cakes which contain sugar do not usually contain soap.\", even though this knowledge is absent from it. If the conclusion seems silly to you then you might consider replacing the word \"soap\" with the word \"eggs\" to see if it changes your feelings.\n\nConsider the sentences:\n\nWe may consider it reasonable to conclude:\n\n\nThis would not be a valid conclusion under a monotonic deduction system (omitting of course the word 'usually'), since the third sentence would contradict the first two. In contrast the conclusion follows immediately using the Gabbay-Makinson rules: applying the rule CMO to the last two sentences yields the result.\n\nThe following consequences follow from the above rules:\n\nLet formula_14 be a finite language. An atom is a formula of the form formula_15 (where formula_16 and formula_17). Notice that there is a unique valuation which makes any given atom true (and conversely each valuation satisfies precisely one atom). Thus an atom can be used to represent a preference about what we believe ought to be true.\n\nLet formula_18 be the set of all atoms in L. For formula_19 SL, define formula_20.\n\nLet formula_21 be a sequence of subsets of formula_18. For formula_23, formula_24 in SL, let the relation formula_25 be such that formula_26 if one of the following holds:\n\nThen the relation formula_25 is a rational consequence relation. This may easily be verified by checking directly that it satisfies the GM-conditions.\n\nThe idea behind the sequence of atom sets is that the earlier sets account for the most likely situations such as \"young people are usually law abiding\" whereas the later sets account for the less likely situations such as \"young joyriders are usually not law abiding\".\n\n\nIt can be proven that any rational consequence relation on a finite language is representable via a sequence of atom preferences above. That is, for any such rational consequence relation formula_1 there is a sequence formula_21 of subsets of formula_18 such that the associated rcr formula_25 is the same relation: formula_48\n\n\n"}

{"id": "948915", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=948915", "title": "Samuel Alexander", "text": "Samuel Alexander\n\nSamuel Alexander, (6 January 185913 September 1938) was an Australian-born British philosopher. He was the first Jewish fellow of an Oxbridge college.\n\nAlexander was born at 436 George Street, in what is now the commercial heart of Sydney, Australia. He was the third son of Samuel Alexander, a prosperous saddler, and Eliza née Sloman. Both parents were Jewish. His father died just before he was born, and Eliza moved to the adjacent colony of Victoria in 1863 or 1864. They went to live at St Kilda, and Alexander was placed at a private school kept by a Mr Atkinson.\n\nIn 1871, he was sent to Wesley College, Melbourne, then under the headmastership of Professor Irving, and was always grateful for the efficiency and comprehensiveness of his schooling. He matriculated at the University of Melbourne on 22 March 1875 to do arts. He was placed in the first class in both his first and second years, was awarded the classical and mathematical exhibitions (top of year) in his first year. In his second year, he won the exhibitions in Greek; Latin and English; mathematics and natural philosophy; and natural science.\n\nIn May 1877, Alexander left for England in an attempt to win a scholarship, arriving at the end of August. Undecided whether to go to Oxford or Cambridge he chose Oxford and sat for a scholarship at Balliol College. Among the competition were George Curzon and J. W. Mackail. Though his tutor thought little of his chances Alexander achieved second place after Mackail and gained a scholarship.\n\nAt Oxford, he obtained a first class in classical and mathematical moderations, a rare achievement, and a first class in Greats, his final examination for the degree of BA, in 1881. Two of his tutors were the philosopher T. H. Green and the Latinist Henry Nettleship, who exercised a great influence on his early work.\n\nAfter taking his degree, Alexander was made a fellow of Lincoln College, where he remained as philosophy tutor from 1882 to 1893. It was during this period that he developed his interest in psychology, then a neglected subject. In 1887, he won the Green moral philosophy prize with an essay on the subject \"In what direction does Moral Philosophy seem to you to admit or require advance?\" This was the basis of his volume \"Moral Order and Progress\", which was published in 1889 and went into its third edition in 1899.\n\nBy 1912, however, Alexander had altered his views to some extent and considered that the book had served its purpose and had become dated. During the period of his fellowship at Lincoln, he contributed articles on philosophical subjects to \"Mind\", the \"Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society\", and the \"International Journal of Ethics\". He did some travelling on the continent, and in the winter of 1890–91 was in Germany working at the psychological laboratory of Hugo Münsterberg at Freiburg. Among his colleagues at Lincoln was Walter Baldwin Spencer.\n\nFor some time, Alexander had wanted to obtain a professorship. He made three unsuccessful attempts before he was appointed at the Owens College, Manchester in 1893, remaining there for the rest of his life. There, he quickly became a leading figure in the university. Among his colleagues there was the educational theorist Catherine Isabella Dodd. Unconventional in his attire and his manner of conducting his classes, there was something in him that drew students and colleagues alike to him. He wrote little, and his growing deafness made it difficult for him to get much out of philosophical discussions, though he could manage conversation.\n\nAn important change in his home life occurred in 1902 when the whole of his family – his mother, an aunt, two elder brothers and his sister – came from Australia to live with him. It worked well in Alexander's case. His sister became a most efficient hostess and on Wednesday evenings fellow members of the staff, former pupils, a few advanced students and others would drop in. His home at that time was at 6 Mauldeth Road West in Withington (from 1904 in the City of Manchester).\n\nAlexander was the \"unofficial godfather\" of writer Naomi Mitchison, born in 1897 – and as she noted, he took this far more seriously than many who have such a position officially. From an early age he took an interest in her studies and her intellectual and literary development, and often wrote her long and detailed letters offering useful advice. Mitchison devoted a chapter in her autobiographical work \"You may well ask\" to Alexander, recounting with great warmth and affection various anecdotes of her contact with him over several decades until his death and quoting extensively from letters that he wrote her. The chapter in Mitchison's book devoted to Alexander is called \"Beauty and the Bicycle\", a reference to the bicycle which was Alexander's preferred means of locomotion - a familiar sight in the streets of Manchester at the time.\n\nHe was given the Hon. LLD of St Andrews in 1905, and in later years he received Hon. Litt. D. degrees from Durham, Liverpool, Oxford and Cambridge. In 1908, he published \"Locke\", a short but excellent study, which was included in the \"Philosophies Ancient and Modern Series\". He was president of the Aristotelian Society from 1908–1911 and from 1936–37. In 1913, was made a fellow of the British Academy. He was appointed Gifford lecturer at Glasgow in 1915, and delivered his lectures in the winters of 1917 and 1918. These he developed into his great work \"Space, Time, and Deity\", published in two volumes in 1920, which his biographer has called the \"boldest adventure in detailed speculative metaphysics attempted in so grand a manner by any English writer between 1655 and 1920\". That its conclusions should be universally accepted was scarcely to be expected, but it was widely and well reviewed, and made a great impression on philosophic thinkers at the time and for many years after. His Arthur Davis Memorial Lecture on \"Spinoza and Time\" was published in 1921, and in 1924 Alexander retired from his chair.\n\nThough Alexander kept his Manchester professorship until retirement, \"He tried, on several occasions, to return to Oxford as a professor, but (I am as good as certain) never thought of leaving 'dear sooty Manchester' for any place other than Oxford.\" The Public Orator of Oxford, Arthur Blackburne, took rather a condescending view of Manchester and commended Alexander for his civilizing activities in the city: \"Et quid est gratius quam ea studia quae praecipue nostra sunt eo quoque pervenire ubi plerique se negotiis potius quam Musis deditos esse profitentur?\". This translates as: \"'And what is more pleasant than that those studies, which are especially ours, should also reach that area [region, point] where the majority confess themselves to be devoted to business rather than the Arts?\"\n\nBefore he retired, Alexander had longed for leisure, but it was impossible for him to be idle. He continued to give short courses and single lectures in connection with the extramural department, he graded examinations for higher degrees and also did some reviewing. He retained until 1930 the office of presenter for honorary degrees. His short orations when presenting were models of grace and skill. He remained on many committees, always ready to give them the benefit of his help and wisdom. Alexander kept up his interest in the British Academy and the British Institute of Philosophy, as well as in Jewish communities in England and Palestine.\n\nIn 1925, he was honoured by the presentation of his bust by Epstein to the University of Manchester, where it was placed in the centre of the hall of the arts building, which is named after him. He was Herbert Spencer lecturer at Oxford in 1927, and in 1930, amid congratulations from all over the country, the Order of Merit was conferred on him, the first to an Australian-born.\n\nIn 1933, he published \"Beauty and other Forms of Value\", mainly an essay in aesthetics, which incorporated passages from papers that had appeared in the previous 10 years. Some of the earlier parts of the book were deliberately meant to be provocative, and Alexander had hoped that artists of distinction in various mediums might be tempted to say how they worked. He had, however, not reckoned with the difficulty most artists find in explaining their methods of work and the response was comparatively meagre.\n\nHe was greatly troubled by the sufferings of the Jews in Europe and gave much of his time and money in helping to alleviate them.\n\nEarly in 1938, he realised that his end was approaching and he died on 13 September 1938. He was unmarried and his ashes lie in Manchester Southern cemetery (British Jewish Reform Congregation section).\n\nHis will was proved at about £16,000, of which £1,000 went to the University of Jerusalem and the bulk of the remainder to the University of Manchester. In 1939, his \"Philosophical and Literary Pieces\" was published with a memoir by his literary executor, John Laird. This volume included papers on literary subjects, as well as philosophical lectures, several of which had been published separately.\n\nWhen lecturing, Alexander could be quite informal, at times dropping into a kind of conversation with his class, and would follow a side track if it looked promising. He did not always give the impression that he was much interested in teaching, yet he was a great teacher whose influence was widespread. He was one of the greatest speculative thinkers of his time.\n\nA theatre at Monash University, Melbourne, is named for him and a cast of his bust by Epstein stands in its foyer.\n\nThe building formerly known as Humanities Lime Grove at the University of Manchester was renamed the Samuel Alexander Building in 2007. It was given Grade II listed building status by English Heritage on 12 February 2010. As in Melbourne, a cast of his bust by Epstein stands in its foyer.\n\nTwo key concepts for Alexander are those of an \"emergent quality\" and the idea of emergent evolution:\n\nHis task, as in any metaphysical theory, was to account for every aspect of existing reality in the simplest and most economical basis. Alexander's idea was to start with space and time, each of which he regarded as inconceivable without the other, in fact mutually equivalent. Out of this, pure spacetime emerges, through a process Alexander describes simply as \"motion\", the stuff and matter that make up our material world:\n\nAlexander absolutizes spacetime, and even speaks of it as a \"stuff\" of which things are made. At the same time he also says that spacetime can be called \"Motions\" – not motion in the singular, but complexes of motions with kaleidoscopic changes within a continuum. So one might say that for Alexander motion is primitive, and space and time are defined through relations between motions.\n\nIn \"Space, Time, and Deity\" Alexander held that an object may be before a consciousness, but is not in it; consciousness of an object is not the same as consciousness of one's consciousness of the object. For example, an object such as a chair may be apprehended by a consciousness, but the chair is not located within that consciousness; and, the contemplation of the chair is distinct from thinking about the act of contemplating the chair. Further, since the contemplation of an object is itself an action, in Alexander's view it cannot be \"contemplated,\" but only subjectively experienced, or \"enjoyed.\"\n\nAlexander asked the question:\n\nThe question went largely unanswered and his work is mostly ignored (or, at best, little known) these days. Alexander's views have also been described as panentheistic.\n\nAlexander was a contemporary of Alfred North Whitehead, whom he influenced, and mentored others who went on to become major figures in 20th century British philosophy.\n\nTo Collingwood he was a \"philosophical genius of very high order\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "36681001", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36681001", "title": "Self-licensing", "text": "Self-licensing\n\nSelf-licensing (aka noble cause corruption, moral self-licensing, moral licensing, licensing effect, moral credential effect) is a term used in social psychology and marketing to describe the subconscious phenomenon whereby increased confidence and security in one’s self-image or self-concept tends to make that individual worry less about the consequences of subsequent immoral behavior and, therefore, more likely to make immoral choices and act immorally. In simple terms, self-licensing occurs when people allow themselves to indulge after doing something positive first; for example, drinking a diet soda with a greasy hamburger and fries can lead one to subconsciously discount the negative attributes of the meal’s high caloric and cholesterol content.\n\nA large subset of this effect, the moral credential effect, is a bias that occurs when a person's track record as a good egalitarian establishes in them an unconscious ethical certification, endorsement, or license that increases the likelihood of less egalitarian decisions later. This effect occurs even when the audience or moral peer group is unaware of the affected person's previously established moral credential. For example, individuals who had the opportunity to recruit a woman or African American person in one setting were more likely to say later, in a different setting, that a job would be better suited for a man or a Caucasian person. Similar effects also appear to occur when a person observes another person from a group they identify with making an egalitarian decision.\n\nSelf-licensing can have negative societal consequences since it has a permissive effect on behaviors such as racial prejudice and discrimination, selfishness, poor dietary and health habits, and excessive energy consumption.\nResearchers Uzma Khan and Ravi Dhar describe the phenomena as follows:\n\nSimilarly, Anna Merritt and colleagues have explained that\n\nIt has been found that moral credentials can be obtained vicariously. That is, a person will behave as if they themselves have moral credentials when that person observes another person from a group they identify with making an egalitarian decision. In research that draws on social identity theory it was also found that group membership moderates the effectiveness of moral credentials in mitigating perceptions of prejudice. Specifically, it was observed that displays of moral credentials have more effect between people who share in-group status.\n\nResearch suggests that self-licensing affects moral self-regulation and individual behavior in a variety of contexts; for example, it can influence consumer purchases, political opinions, charitable giving, energy policy and home energy use, job hiring, racial attitudes, health-related decision-making, risky sexual behavior, alcohol consumption, and dietary supplement use. Washington Post staff writer Michael Rosenwald described the following everyday examples of self-licensing behavior:\n\nA 2011 study published by researchers in Taiwan indicated that people who take multivitamin pills, especially those who believe that they are receiving significant health benefits from supplement use, are more prone to subsequently engage in unhealthy activities. Participants in the study were divided into two groups, both of which were given placebo pills; one group was correctly informed that the pills contained no active ingredients and the other group was told that the pills were multivitamin supplements. Survey results showed that participants who thought that they had received a multivitamin were predisposed to smoking more cigarettes and more likely to believe that they were invulnerable to harm, injury, and disease as compared with subjects who knew that they were given a placebo. Participants who believed they were given a multivitamin were also less likely to exercise and to choose healthier food, and had a higher desire to engage in \"hedonic activities that involve instant gratification but pose long-term health hazards\", such as casual sex, sunbathing, wild parties, and excessive drinking. In the 'multivitamin' group, the more supplements a participant used, the less likely they were to exercise, and smoking was highest among participants who expressed a conscious belief that multivitamins increased health. \nThe study's authors argued that because dietary supplements are perceived as conferring health advantages, use of such supplements may create an illusory sense of invulnerability that disinhibits unhealthy behaviors. Overall, the study shows that people who take supplements may feel that merely taking a pill is a sufficient contribution to healthful living to enjoy other activities without regard to health, and it exposes a potential hypocrisy among supplement users. The authors advised:\n\nCommenting on the implications of the study, Ben Goldacre said:\n\nResearchers Khan and Dhar investigated the influence of self-licensing on consumer decisions regarding the purchase of luxury goods. They reasoned that \"relative preferences for a luxury option will be higher if people's prior decisions provide a boost to their relevant self-concept\". Due to the self-licensing effect, \"a prior intent to be virtuous boosts respondents' self-concepts, thus reducing negative self-attributions associated with the purchase of relative luxuries\". Furthermore, they predicted that consumers may be unaware of how their prior decision influences their subsequent choices; i.e. the process underlying the licensing effect may be largely nonconscious. In the study, some participants were first asked to select from a list a charity organizations for which they would willingly volunteer three hours a week. Later, these people—and participants who hadn't been asked to volunteer—were asked whether they would buy designer jeans or an identically priced vacuum cleaner, assuming that they had enough money to buy only one. Participants who were asked to imagine having committed the charitable act before shopping were more than twice as likely to choose the jeans. The authors noted that \"People don't even have to do good for this effect to happen…Even if they plan to do something good, it will give them a boost in their self-image. Any type of situation where you have guilt involved, you will see this, and so this happens in luxury goods.\"\n\nA study by University of Toronto behavioral marketing professor Nina Mazar and Chen-Bo Zhong found that people who bought green products were more likely to cheat and steal than those who bought conventional products. The researchers conducted an experiment in which they asked college students to shop for products online from either an eco-friendly or a conventional store. Each subject was then asked to divide a small sum of money between themselves and a stranger in a paradigm known as the dictator game, in which participants can cheat to make more money. The shoppers from the green store were more dishonest than those at the conventional store, which brought them higher earnings in the game. The authors suggested that the results could be accounted for by the licensing effect, noting that \"When we engage in a good deed, that gives us a kind of satisfaction. With that self-satisfied feeling can come tacit permission to behave more selfishly next time we have the opportunity\". The authors added that \"purchasing green products may license indulgence in self-interested and unethical behaviors\", and concluded:\n\nResearchers have invoked the self-licensing effect to explain why consumers who opt for energy-efficient products increase their energy usage so as to offset any potential gains. Energy economist Lucas Davis published a study showing that after getting high-efficiency washers, consumers increased clothes washing by nearly 6 percent. Other studies have shown that people leave energy-efficient lights on longer than conventional lights, and that many people who make their homes more energy efficient turn their heating up and ultimately see no reduction in energy costs.\n\nThe self-licensing effect was examined by Monin and Miller in a 2001 study which demonstrated that when participants established credentials as non-prejudiced persons, they were more willing to express politically incorrect opinions despite the fact that the audience was unaware of their credentials. Subsequent research by Monin and Daniel Effron showed that an opportunity to endorse Barack Obama during the 2008 presidential election made his supporters more likely to express views that favored Whites at the expense of African-Americans. Essentially, the endorsement made people feel like they had shown that they were not biased, giving them a license to subsequently express racially prejudicial views.\n\n"}
{"id": "56424960", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56424960", "title": "Shigajiku", "text": "Shigajiku\n\nShigajiku (, \"poem-and-painting scrolls\"), are a form of Japanese ink wash painting. These hanging scrolls depict poetic inscriptions at the top of the scroll and a painted image, usually a landscape scene, below. Buddhist monks of the \"gozan\" 五山 or Five Mountain monasteries of the early Muromachi Period (1336-1573) first introduced the poem-and-painting scrolls.\n\n\"Shigajiku\" is a modern category given to the visual and literary culture of the Muromachi Period rooted in the Zen tradition. The most common visual aesthetic for \"shigajiku\" is a monochrome water and ink style of painting, \"suibokuga\" 水墨画, with only occasional traces of color throughout the scroll.\n\nThe first poem-and-painting scrolls came to Japan with the return of the first Zen monks who had been studying in China. The most important cultural precedent to \"shigajiku\" was the Chinese version of the poem/scroll, the \"shijiku\" 詩軸. This continental version served as a model for the future poem-and-painting scrolls produced by the Japanese Five Mountains monks. Yet, \"shigajiku\" are distinct from their Chinese predecessors because of the distinctive hanging scroll format and the number of inscriptions on the scrolls themselves.\n\nThe creation of \"shigajiku\" is closely tied to the secular and religious lives of the Five Mountains monks. The formation of \"tatuchū\", or subtemples, provides the basis for the social relationships through which the \"shigajiku\" would be created and circulated. The \"tatuchū\" created a new social unit among Japanese Zen monks and gave rise to the \"shikai\" or poetry meetings. These communities and meetings provide an important social base for the monks of the Five Mountain monasteries. Clerics intermingled with each other and exchanged scrolls with other monks during such gatherings. These monks would then compose and write poems on each other’s scroll, thus accounting for some scrolls having between four and thirty inscriptions.\n\nThe first surviving shigajiku, \"Newly Risen Moon over a Brushwood Gate\", was produced in the Five Mountains Zen monasteries during 1400. Of the eighteen inscriptions, six are connected to Nanzen-ji, the temple and literary epicenter for Zen monks during the early 15th century. This connection highlights the importance of the social relationships of the clerics and the spiritual value of the painting.\n\nThe subjects of poem-and-painting scrolls vary to include subject such as: portrait scrolls, \"chinsō;\" scrolls on Daoist and Buddhist subjects, \"dōshaku senki\"; and landscape scrolls, \"sansui\". Most \"shigajiku\" are the last category landscape of which there are many different representations. The different themes of the landscape genre will be focused on here as they appear most frequently in \"shigajiku\".\n\n\nThe most common theme of landscape is the image of a secluded scholar’s study in a mountain setting or \"shosaizu\". Monks of the \"tatuchū\" communities popularized the idea of creating idealizing, memorializing, and pining images of the scholar’s study to escape the confines of a private subtemple. These poem-and painting scrolls depict idealized retreats into nature with open skies, vast waters, and hazy mountain views – a perfect setting for the intellectual pleasures of retired monks living out their secluded lives. These scholar’s studies were seen as blissful escapes from busy city life where peace was difficult to find. Key features include rocks, cliffs, flowing water, a bridge, a mountain path, an elderly scholar climbing, vast expanses of water and sky with mountains soaring in the distance.\n\nTo say these scholar’s study poem-and-painting scrolls were only escapist would be incorrect. A scholar’s study \"shigajiku\" aids in evoking an idealized landscape to help the monk bring about a sense of peaceful serenity through which they would write, meditate, reflect, etc. Painters manipulated their surroundings and were forced to use their imagination or memory to create these landscapes that were so far removed from their own setting of a bustling Japanese city. Often looking to the deep mountains valleys one would find in China – these tiny idealists landscapes became a monks’ flight from reality via Chinese inspiration. For these Japanese monks, “incorporating Chinese poetic themes with idealized visions of Chinese landscapes expressed faithful spirituality in a way that simply painting a realistic landscape from their own mundane life could never have done… painted poetry became the image of utopia in the minds of Japanese and Korean elites, whether or not those images looked like the ‘real’ China.”\n\nThe painting of landscape \"shigajiku\" encompasses different themes, but almost always includes an idealized landscape representing some imaginary corner of nature. This affords a perfect setting for the intellectual pleasures of the monks’ retired and secluded lives. Ancient crooked pine trees clinging tenaciously to a sheer cliff, hills in the distance, vast expanse of water and sky, this secluded corner of nature would have been beloved by Zen monks and their followers and are some of the most common tropes of \"shigajiku\".\n\nHistorically there were two ways to create the painting of the \"shigajiku\": the “old style” and the “new style.” The “old style” is believed to have derived from the painting traditions of the Northern Sung painters, specifically Guo Xi (1020-1090), where the aesthetic concentrated around balanced and centered compositions. The “new style” is believed to be largely derived from the Southern Sung, specifically Xia Gui (1195–1224), with the central focus of the composition moved into a corner of the scroll to create a dynamic and asymmetrical image. It is important to note that both of these painting styles originated in China and became the way in which Japanese Zen monks desired to paint their \"shigajiku\".\n\n\"Reading in a Bamboo Grove\" encompasses the most common tropes of the \"shigajiku\", the imposing mountains, with sheer cliffs, trees precariously perched near edges, and hints of a vast open horizon. This scholar’s study \"shigajiku\" is done in the “new style,” and when compared with a composition by Xia Gui, the characteristics of the “new style” become clearer. The positioning of the mountain scene in the corner and the poetic inscriptions above and opposite the image dramatically accentuates the asymmetrical nature of the scroll.\n\nFive Mountains monks used the \"shikai\" or poetry gatherings to discuss, create, and inscribe their poetry onto the scrolls of their fellow monks. The poetic inscription extends no further than 2/3 of the scroll leaving the bottom 1/3 for the painted image. This structuring has led some scholars to argue that the poetry is valued more than painting. The Zen priests inscribing \"shigajiku\" were not as concerned with who painted the picture as they were with how successful the painting was in transporting the viewer into an idealistic natural setting. The poetic inscriptions vary in subject matter, referring to the natural poetry of the early century, celebrated works of Chinese poetry, or messages to other monks of greeting, farewell, congratulation, etc. The number of inscriptions varies, but the order in which they were inscribed denotes the prestige of a monk.\n\nActive in 16th century, Shūtoku created a \"shigajiku\" entitled \"Early Spring Landscape\". The format of a tall and narrow poem filling one corner and the “new” style of paining filling the opposite corner creates an asymmetry that is characteristic of \"shigajiku\". The asymmetry of the composition and the poetic inscription at the top recalls Shūbun, and the painting also reflects the influence of Sesshū.\n\nThe text on the lower right of \"Early Spring Landscape\", authored by Yōkoku Kentō (d. 1533), translates to: \"Though the west lake swells with water as spring arrives, / the emerald bamboo outdoors blocks the sight of boats. / Had the east wind facilitated his quest, / he would have returned by boat in moonlight to the frosted land of Wu faraway.\" The text on the upper left, authored by Teihō Shōchū (fl. ca. 1538), translates to: \"Floating in a boathouse on the brimming spring river, / what could one desire in a sound sleep after mooring? / In nothing but insouciant boating would I spend the rest of my life, / with mountains along the white gull-dotted stream as my beauties.\"The poetry of these two different monks, both evoke ideas reflected in the painting below it. The natural images of flowing water, trees, and wind are incredibly calming. The musings of sleep and dreams demonstrates the monks longing to be in such a serene place. The solitude yet tranquil atmosphere of the landscape provides the perfect escape for the monks who were writing and discussing the poems in busy city of Koyto. The \"shigajiku\" medium enables the mind to reach that level of contemplation where the world disappears and all one hears is nature – a state greatly desired by these city dwelling monks.\n\nPoem-and-painting scrolls must be understood as a whole piece of art – the meaning of the image is informed by the inscription and vice versa. The unity of the \"shigajiku\" scroll is “painting of a poetic idea.” Understanding the two part of the \"shigajiku\" together is vital. Scholar Shimao Arata articulates that together, the painting and inscriptions of \"shigajiku\", form the “four perfections” – poetry, painting, calligraphy, and prose. These “four perfections” express “the mind’s level of spiritual accomplishment, and this spiritual link between the four perfections is itself the subject of the earliest known poem-and-painting scrolls.”\nWhile the idea of poetry and painting influencing and changing the overall meaning of a composition preexisted the creation of \"shigajiku\" – it has become a concept fundamental to ascertain the meaning of a shigajiku. The first \"shigajiku\", \"Newly Risen Moon over a Brushwood Gate,\" follows “the classic formulation of the relation between poetry and painting developed by Su Shih and his circle, which we have seen also was a crucial factor in the rise of the earliest Japanese poem-and-painting scrolls around.” Poem-and-painting scrolls were intended, from the beginning of their production, to be understood as a whole piece of art with different mediums (“four perfections”) used to convey a single artwork.\n\n\"Towering above Wilderness Hall\"This scroll is an early example of a \"shigajiku\" depicting the genre of a landscape and the theme of a scholar’s study. The inscription is a quotation from essays on Sima Guang (1019-1086) by the Chinese Song-dynasty literatus Su Shi (1037-1101) The Zen monk who inscribed this scroll interpreted the scholar studio to be “surrounded with bamboo as a metaphor for the garden of Sima, the Song dynasty scholar-official who, in imitation of the Tang poet Bai Juyi, enjoyed the garden in isolation during his exile in Luoyang.” The connection between the image and the painting is clear – the painting informs the poems and the poems inform the painting.\"Hue of Water, Light on the Peaks\" The scholarly retreat depicted on the scroll shows and idyllic and peaceful setting surrounded by nature. The poem is named by the first characters of the first poem, \"suishoku rankō\", a phrase that can be literally translated as “hue of the water, light on the peaks.” Again this connection highlights the importance of “reading” the composition as one piece of art, instead of multiple pieces of art painting, poetry, and calligraphy. The dynamism of the ink painting can be seen through the “arrangement of various elements in this work lacks concision and a sense of three-dimensional space in its execution.” The scholar’s study in the center of the painting is offset by the commanding motif of the three pine trees and looming mountain in the background. This structural ambiguity can be seen as an attempt to render a scholars retreat that is truly separate from reality, “this painting is an excellent example of the art produced within the cultural sphere of Zen Buddhism, which shunned the worldly realm.”\"Splashed Ink Landscape\"With the dedicatory inscription at the top of the scroll written by Sesshū himself, Sesshū’s scroll slowly reveals itself to the reader. The “unconsummated, intuited nature of the \"Splashed Ink Landscape\" has led many commentators to interpret Sesshu's painting as embodying or pictorializing the principles of Zen Buddhism.” The unrestrained nature of this work speaks to the enlightened ideal of the Zen tradition, while maintaining the tropes of the suggested mountains, surrounding water, and trees.\n\n"}

He was considered a radical by the conservative members of the Roman Catholic Church, but it is suggested that he played as important a role as his contemporary Thomas Aquinas in the shaping of Western attitudes towards faith and reason.\n\nLittle is known about many of the details of his life. In 1266, he was attached to the Faculty of Arts in the University of Paris at the time when a riot erupted between the French and Picard \"nations\" of students—a series of loosely organized fraternities. The papal legate threatened Siger with execution as the ringleader of the Picard attack on the French, but no further action was taken.\n\nIn the ten years following the riot, he wrote the six works which are ascribed to him and were published under his name by Pierre Mandonnet in 1899. The titles of these treatises are:\n\n\nIn 1271, he was once more involved in a party struggle. The minority among the \"nations\" chose him as rector in opposition to the elected candidate, Aubri de Rheims. For three years the strife continued, and was probably based on the opposition between the Averroists, Siger and Pierre Dubois, and the more orthodox schoolmen. The matter was settled by the Papal Legate, Simon de Brion, afterwards Pope Martin IV. Siger retired from Paris to Liège.\n\nSiger was accused of teaching \"double truth\"—that is, saying one thing could be true through reason, and that the opposite could be true through faith. Because Siger was a scholastic, he probably did not teach double truths but tried to find reconciliations between faith and reason.\n\nIn 1277, a general condemnation of Aristotelianism included a special clause directed against Boetius of Dacia and Siger of Brabant. Again Siger and Bernier de Nivelles were summoned to appear on a charge of heresy, especially in connection with the \"Impossibilia\", where the existence of God is discussed. It appears, however, that Siger and Boetius fled to Italy and, according to John Peckham, archbishop of Canterbury, then perished miserably.\n\nThe manner of Siger's death, which occurred at Orvieto, is not known. A Brabantine chronicle says that he was stabbed by a seemingly-insane secretary (\"a clerico suo quasi dementi\"). The secretary is said to have used a pen as the murder weapon and his critics claimed since he had done so much damage with his pen, he deserved what was coming. Dante, in the \"Paradiso\" (x.134-6), says that he found \"death slow in coming,\" and some have concluded that this indicates death by suicide. A 13th-century sonnet by one Durante (xcii.9-14) says that he was executed at Orvieto: \"a ghiado it fe' morire a gran dolore, Nella corte di Roma ad Orbivieto.\" The date of this may have been 1283-1284 when Pope Martin IV was in residence at Orvieto. His fellow radicals were lying low in the face of the Condemnations of 1277 and there was no investigation into his murder.\n\nIn politics he held that good laws were better than good rulers, and criticised papal infallibility in temporal affairs. The importance of Siger in philosophy lies in his acceptance of Averroism in its entirety, which drew upon him the opposition of Albertus Magnus and Aquinas.\n\nIn December 1270, Averroism was condemned by ecclesiastical authority, and during his whole life Siger was exposed to persecution both from the Church and from purely philosophic opponents.\n\nIn Dante Alighieri's \"The Divine Comedy\", Siger of Brabant is found in the of Paradise for being a positive example of Prudence, Justice, temperance, and Fortitude.\n\n\n\n"}

The work is often attributed to Dongshan Liangjie (Japanese: Tōzan Ryōkai), the co-founder of the Caodong/Sōtō branch of Zen Buddhism, although modern research suggests this is unlikely.\n\nThe poem is first mentioned in Juefan Huihong's biographical compilation of 1119, the \"Chanlin sengbao zhuan\" (\"Chronicle of the Sangha Treasure in the Groves of Chan\"), written over 200 years after Dongshan Liangjie's death. Huihong, however, does not attribute the poem to Dongshan. He writes instead that the poem was given to Dongshan by his teacher, Yunyan Tansheng. Huihong further speculates that Yunyan's teacher, Yaoshan Weiyan, probably entrusted it to him in turn. Huihong relates that he came upon the poem in 1108, when it was given to a scholar Zhu Yan by a monk, whom he does not identify. The scholar Morten Schlütter notes that the poem's provenance is doubtful given the way it came to Huihong, and furthermore the style differs substantially from works of the era that Huihong attributes it to. Most later historical sources, such as the \"Zengaku daijiten\", the \"Bussho kaisetsu daijiten\", and \"Shinsan zenseki mokuroku\", attribute the poem to Dongshan Liangjie rather than Yunyan, although again, neither is likely to be the true author.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7548870", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7548870", "title": "Symbolic culture", "text": "Symbolic culture\n\nSymbolic culture is the ability to learn and transmit behavioural traditions from one generation to the next by the invention of things that exist entirely in the symbolic realm. Symbolic culture is usually conceived as the cultural realm constructed and inhabited uniquely by Homo sapiens and is differentiated from ordinary culture, which many other animals possess. Symbolic culture is studied by archaeologists, social anthropologists and sociologists. Recently, however, some evidence of a Neanderthal origin of symbolic culture has emerged .\n\nExamples are concepts such as good and evil, mythical inventions such as gods and underworlds, and social constructs such as promises and football games. Symbolic culture is a domain of objective facts whose existence depends, paradoxically, on collective belief. A currency system, for example, exists only for as long as people continue to have faith in it. When confidence in monetary facts collapses, the facts themselves suddenly disappear. Much the same applies to citizenship, government, marriage and many other things that people in our own culture consider to be 'real'. The concept of symbolic culture draws from semiotics, and emphasises the way in which distinctively human culture is mediated through signs and concepts. The symbolic aspect of distinctively human culture has been emphasised in sociology by Emile Durkheim, Claude Lévi-Strauss, Clifford Geertz and many others.\n\nFrom a Darwinian standpoint, symbolic culture has proved hard to explain. One difficulty is that the concept itself often seems unsettling and philosophically unacceptable to natural scientists. Modern science became established in opposition to the idea that culturally accepted fictions can be equated with facts. Yet the concept of symbolic culture requires us to grasp just that paradoxical possibility. Long before the late twentieth century invention of the Internet, evolution allowed humans to flit between two realms, reality on the one hand, virtual reality on the other. Symbolic culture is an environment of virtual entities lacking counterparts in the real world.\n\nIt was once thought that art and symbolic culture first emerged in Europe some 40,000 years ago, during the Middle-to-Upper Palaeolithic transition – often termed the 'symbolic explosion' or 'Upper Palaeolithic revolution'. Some archaeologists still adhere to this view. Others now accept that symbolic culture probably emerged in sub-Saharan Africa at a much earlier date, during the period known as the Middle Stone Age. The evidence consists of traditions of ground ochre with strong selection for the colour red, examples of so-called ochre 'crayons' which appear to have been used for purposes of design, probably on the body, and geometric engravings on blocks of ochre. All this apparently formed part of a cosmetics industry dated to between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago. One theory is that this constitutes evidence for a ritual tradition. In addition, from about 100,000 years ago, there are pierced shells which appear to show signs of wear, suggesting that they were strung together to make necklaces. If the ochre tradition has been correctly interpreted, it constitutes evidence for the world's first 'art'—an aspect of 'symbolic culture'—in the form of personal ornamentation and body-painting. It was initially countered that pigment-only decorative systems are merely individualistic display, not necessarily indicative of ritual, whereas the bead traditions testify to language, institutionalised relationships and full-scale ritual and symbolic culture. More recently, however, those making this criticism have conceded that the evidence for ochre pigment use, stretching back towards 300,000 years ago, must indeed be recognised as the earliest durable media testifying to a collective ritual tradition.\n\n"}

He completed his education in various educational institutions in the cities of Herat, Ghijduvan, Feryumed, Gulistan, Khwarizm, Samarkand and Sarakhs. He mainly resided in Sarakhs. He was active during the reign of Timur, who noticed him as a promising scientist and supported his scholarship, and was part of his court. Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani famously remarked about him that \"science ended with him in the East\" and \"no one could ever replace him\". He died in Samarkand in 1390 and was buried in Sarakhs. He sincerely practiced Islam, and practiced and preached in the Hanafi and Maturidi schools. He was of the Hanafi school in matters of Fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) and a Maturidi with regard to issues of Aqidah (Islamic creed).\n\nDuring his lifetime, he wrote treaties on grammar, rhetoric, theology, logic, law and Quran exegesis. His works were used as textbooks for centuries in Ottoman madrasahs. and are used in Shia madrasahs to this day.

Some of them are on kalam (speculative theology) and the foundations of \"fiqh\" and rhetoric, which show that he had a profound knowledge of these sciences.

His extraordinary devotion attracts the attention of the Sheikh of an Istanbul Sufi order who offers him an administrative post as a manager for the seminary properties that support a school for orphans and poor children. Muharrem's new job throws him into the modern outside world he has not experienced before. He soon witnesses conflicting attitudes and dilemmas towards alcohol, charity and honesty. He notices that he himself has become proud, domineering and even dishonest. To make matters worse, Muharrem's inner peace is unnerved by the tormenting image of a seductive woman who tempts him in his dreams, both night and day. With the balance of his devotion now upset, his fear of God begins to eat away at his senses. He remains steadfast seeking forgiveness from Allah and guidance from his Sheikh in whom he has complete faith.\n\nThe Sheikh is portrayed as evidence of how power can corrupt. Throughout the story the Sheikh guides Muharrem on the mystical path, however, Muharrem is confused by the Sheikh's uncharitable insistence that rent is collected from everyone, even those who cannot pay. When Muharrem faces his greatest spiritual crises, the Sheikh, being on retreat, is unavailable to counsel him.\n\nHowever, it is possible as seeing the actions of the Sheikh as pushing his fuqarat (student) beyond his comfortable monastic boundaries. The teacher may have given Muharrem this test to help him to grow and as a test of his character. There is a saying along the lines of 'Money will reveal a person's true character, if they are generous, they will be more so, if they are greedy, it will be apparent'. Muharrem, at first, is fair with money. He has compassion for the family that cannot pay their rent. When he is pushed by the Sheikh to collect from everyone, even those who cannot pay, a shift happens as he is faced with the crisis of following his inner voice and the directions of his beloved Sheikh.\n\nThe film ends with him experiencing an excellently portrayed crisis of spirit, driven by his inner piousness clashing against the jarring change he sees in himself, brought upon by his new job that thrust him unprepared into the modern world. He ends up catatonic in bed, being cared for by the Sheikh's daughter, yet completely oblivious to her presence.\n\n\n\n"}

Humphreys' book is based on his 1968 Ph.D. dissertation, which was entitled \"Tearoom Trade: A Study of Homosexual Encounters in Public Places.\" The study is an analysis of male-male sexual behavior in public toilets. Humphreys asserted that the men participating in such activity came from diverse social backgrounds, had differing personal motives for seeking same-sex sexual partners in such venues, and variously self-perceived as \"straight,\" \"bisexual,\" or \"gay.\" His study called into question some of the stereotypes associated with the anonymous male-male sexual activity in public places, demonstrating that many of the participants lived otherwise conventional lives as family men and respected members of their communities, and that their activities posed no threat to non-participants. Because the researcher misrepresented his identity and intent and because the privacy of the subjects was infringed during the study, \"Tearoom Trade\" has caused a major debate on privacy for research participants and is now often used as an example of highly controversial social research.\n\nThe book is an ethnographic study of anonymous male homosexual sexual encounters in public toilets (a practice that was known as \"tea-rooming\" in U.S. gay slang and \"cottaging\" in British English).\n\nHumphreys was able to observe and describe various social cues (body language, hand language, etc.) developed and used by participants in those places. The encounters usually involved three people: the two engaged in the sexual activity, and a look-out, called \"watchqueen\" in slang. By offering his services as the \"watchqueen,\" Humphreys was able to observe the activities of other participants.\n\n38% of Humphreys' subjects were neither bisexual nor homosexual; 24% were clearly bisexual; 24% were single and were covert homosexuals, and only 14% corresponded to the popular stereotype of homosexuality - clear members of the gay community interested in primarily homosexual relationships. Because Humphreys was able to confirm that 54% of his subjects were outwardly heterosexual men with unsuspecting wives at home, an important thesis of \"Tearoom Trade\" is the incongruity between the private self and the social self for many of the men engaging in this form of homosexual activity. Specifically, they put on a \"breastplate of righteousness\" (social and political conservatism) in an effort to conceal their deviation from social norms.\n\nHumphreys also concluded that such encounters were harmless, and posed no danger of harassment to straight men. His research has convinced many police departments that such encounters resulted in victimless crime; hence they were able to focus on other problems.\n\nHumphreys revealed his role to some of those he observed, but he noted that those who tended to talk with him openly were better educated; as he continued his research, he decided to conceal his identity in order to avoid response bias. Humphreys' rationale was that because of public stigma associated with the homosexual activities in question, and his subjects' desires to keep their activities secret, many were unlikely to allow him an opportunity for observation and follow-up interview were he to reveal himself as a researcher.\n\nHumphreys' study has been criticized on ethical grounds in that he observed acts of homosexuality by masquerading as a voyeur, did not get his subjects’ consent, used their license plate numbers to track them down, and interviewed them in disguise without revealing the true intent of his studies (he claimed to be a health service interviewer, and asked them questions about their race, marital status, occupation, and so on). \"Tearoom Trade\" has been criticized for privacy violations, and deceit - both in the initial setting, and in the follow-up interviews. After the study was published, the controversy in Humphreys' own department at Washington University resulted in about half the faculty leaving the department. There was also a lively debate in the popular press; notably journalist Nicholas von Hoffman, writing for \"The Washington Post\" at that time, condemned all social scientists, accusing them of indifference.\n\nNonetheless, others have defended \"Tearoom Trade\", pointing out that participants were conducting their activities in a public place and that the deceit was harmless, since Humphreys designed the study with respect for their individual privacy, not identifying them in his published work.\n\nAs Earl R. Babbie notes, the \"tearoom trade controversy [on whether this research was ethical or not] has never been resolved\"; and it is likely to remain a subject of debates in the conceivable future.\n\n\n\n"}

Its purpose is to produce large-scale full-text electronic resources (especially in the humanities) on behalf of both member institutions (particularly academic libraries) and scholarly publishers, under an arrangement calculated to serve the needs of both, and in so doing to demonstrate the value of a business model that sees corporate and non-profit information-providers as potentially amicable collaborators rather than as antagonistic vendors and customers respectively.\n\nTCP has sponsored four text-creation projects to date. The first and the largest is \"EEBO-TCP (Phase I)\" (2001–2009), an effort to produce structurally marked-up full-text transcriptions of 25,000+ of the roughly 125,000 books to be found either in the Pollard and Redgrave and Wing short-title catalogues of early English printed books, or among the Thomason Tracts, that is, from among nearly all books, pamphlets, and broadsides published in English or in England before 1700. The books were selected and transcribed from the digital scans produced by ProQuest Information and Learning, and distributed by them as a web-based product under the name \"Early English Books Online\" (EEBO). The scans from which the texts were transcribed were themselves made from the microfilm copies made over the years by ProQuest and its antecedent companies, including the original University Microfilms, Inc. EEBO-TCP Phase I concluded at the end of 2009, having transcribed about 25,300 titles, and immediately moved into EEBO-TCP Phase II (2009–), a sequel project dedicated to converting all the remaining unique English-language monographs (roughly 45,000 additional titles).\n\nThe third TCP project was Evans-TCP (2003–2007, with some ongoing work through 2010), an effort to transcribe 6,000 of the 36,000 pre-1800 titles listed in Charles Evans' \"American Bibliography,\" and distributed, again as page images scanned from microfilm copies, by Readex, a division of NewsBank, Inc. under the name \"Archive of Americana\" (\"Early American Imprints, series I: Evans, 1639–1800\"). Evans-TCP has produced e-texts of nearly 5,000 books.\n\nThe final TCP project was ECCO-TCP (2005–2010, with some work ongoing), an effort to transcribe 10,000 eighteenth-century books from among the 136,000 titles available in Thomson-Gale's web-based resource, \"Eighteenth-Century Collections Online\" (ECCO). ECCO-TCP ran out of funding in 2010 after transcribing about 3,000 (and editing about 2,400) titles.\n\nThe TCP is overseen by a Board of Directors, drawn chiefly from senior library administrators at partner institutions, representatives of the corporate partners, and the Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR). The Board is assisted in matters of selection and scholarship by an academic advisory group that includes faculty in the fields of early modern English and American studies.\n\nThe TCP has informal ties to a number of University-based scholarly text projects, especially in helping to provide them with source texts with which to work. Institutions represented include Northwestern University (IL), Oxford University (UK), Washington University (St. Louis), the University of Sydney (Australia), the University of Toronto (ON), and the University of Victoria (BC). TCP has also worked with students by sponsoring an Undergraduate Essay Contest every year, convening task forces on the uses of TCP texts in pedagogy, and appealing to scholars and students for ideas on selection and use.\n\nText production is managed through the University of Michigan's Digital Library Production Service (DLPS), with its extensive experience in the production of SGML/XML-encoded electronic texts. DLPS is assisted by Oxford University's Bodleian Digital Libraries Systems & Services (BDLSS), including the late Sebastian Rahtz. Small part-time production operations have also been started within two other libraries: the Centre for Reformation and Renaissance Studies in Pratt Library (Victoria University in the University of Toronto), specializing in Latin books; and the National Library of Wales (Llyfrgell Genedlaethol Cymru) in Aberystwyth, specializing in Welsh books.\n\nAll four TCP text projects are very similar. In each case:\n\n\nAll four TCP text projects are produced in the same way and to the same standards, which are documented, at least in part, on the TCP web site.\n\n\nAs of April 2011, the TCP had created about 40,000 searchable, navigable, full-text transcriptions of early books, a database of unmatched scope, scale, and utility to students in many fields. Whether it will be able to go on to produce the remaining 38,000 texts included in its ambitious recent plans (for EEBO-TCP Phase II) will depend on the validity of its original vision, arising from the theory that libraries could and should cooperate to become producers and standard-setters rather than consumers; and that universities and commercial firms, despite their very different life-cycles, constraints, and motives, could join in durable partnerships of benefit to all parties.\n\nAs of Jan 1, 2015, the full text of the EEBO phase I has been released under a Creative Commons License, and can be freely downloaded and distributed.\n\nIn 2014 there were 28,466 titles available via Phase II. As of July 2015, ProQuest had the exclusive right for five years to distribute the EEBO-TCP Phase II collection. After those five years the texts will be made freely available to the public.\n\n\n"}

He repeats in this work his warnings against the \"self-destructive tendencies of mega science\" and the neglect of ignorance: \"Curing the ignorance of ignorance is not merely a concern of enlightened educators. It is vitally important for science and survival.\" Like most of Ravetz's production this works takes on a new relevance in the context of the present science's crisis.\n\nJonathan Latham wrote that the book \"focuses on what we can learn from the ongoing revision of this history. It argues that science was never objective or disinterested but that in the past this mattered relatively little since science was relatively powerless and less wedded to establishment interests. […] Ravetz offers the democratisation of science as a necessary and realistic antidote to the hubris and arrogance of science.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "9161888", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9161888", "title": "Uwaisi", "text": "Uwaisi\n\nThe Uwaisī is a form of spiritual transmission in the vocabulary of Islamic mysticism that was named after Awais Malik \"(Owais al-Qarni)\". It refers to the transmission of spiritual knowledge between two individuals without the need for physical interaction between them. The term Uwaisīyaan refers to those Sufis who have gained the Sufi spiritual chain from another Sufi without physically meeting them in this world. It can refer to a school of Sufism, and its singular form, Uwaisi, refers to a single individual.\n\nIn the science of spirituality of Islam (Tasawwuf) the Uwaisi Transmission occurs when the spirits of righteous believers (\"saliheen\", \"awliya\") meet in the world called \"`alam al-arwaah\" (the world of spirits) which is beyond \"`alam al-ajsam\" (the material plane). Whoever takes knowledge through spirituality from a master in \"`alam al-arwaah\" is called \"Uwaisi\". This means of transmission is considered as powerful and effective as the physical relation of master and disciple. \n\nThe term \"Uwaisi\" is derived from the name of Uwais al-Qarni, who never met the Islamic prophet Muhammad physically, yet was fully aware of his spiritual presence at all times of his life.\n\nIt is stated in \"Classical Islam and the Naqshbandi Sufi Tradition\", by Shaykh Hisham Kabbani that:\nAccording to Dr. Alan Godlas of the University of Georgia Department of Religion, the \"Uwaysi Order, a Shi'i branch of the Kubrawiya, was brought to the West by its shaykh, Shah Maghsoud Sadegh Angha.\" There are two recent and distinct contemporary branches of the Uwaisi Order in the West following lengthy legal disputes between Shah Maghsoud's offspring.\n\nOne is Maktab Tarighat Oveyssi Shahmaghsoudi, headed by Nader Angha, the son of Shah Maghsoud. The other is the Uwaiysi Tarighat, led by Shah Maghsoud's daughter, Dr. Nahid Angha and her husband Dr. Ali Kianfar. They also co-founded the International Association of Sufism.\n\n'Uwaisi' is also a name for people who claim to have been initiated through the Uwaisi method, or for those who claim to be descendants of Uwais al-Qarni. Among the most famous is the Owaisi family of Hyderabad, India, one of the most prominent political And Sufi Muslim families of the city, including: \n\n\n"}
