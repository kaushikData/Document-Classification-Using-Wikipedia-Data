{"id": "193662", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=193662", "title": "Borborites", "text": "Borborites\n\nAccording to the \"Panarion\" of Epiphanius of Salamis (ch. 26), and Theodoret's \"Haereticarum Fabularum Compendium\", the Borborites or Borborians (; also Koddians; in Egypt, Phibionites; in other countries, Barbalites, Secundians, Socratites, etc.) were a libertine Christian Gnostic sect, said to be descended from the Nicolaitans. The word \"Borborite\" comes from the Greek word \"βόρβορος\", meaning \"mud\"; the name \"Borborites\" can therefore be translated as \"filthy ones\".\n\nThe Borborites possessed a number of sacred books, including \"Noria\" (the name they gave to Noah's wife), a \"Gospel of Eve\", \"The Apocalypse of Adam\", and \"The Gospel of Perfection\". They also used a version of \"The Gospel of Philip\", but a quotation from the Borborite \"Gospel of Philip\" found in Epiphanius's \"Panarion\" is not found anywhere in the surviving version from Nag Hammadi. Several of the Borborites' sacred scriptures revolved around the figure of Mary Magdalene, including \"The Questions of Mary\", \"The Greater Questions of Mary\", \"The Lesser Questions of Mary\", and \"The Birth of Mary\". The Borborites also used a number of sacred texts attributed to Seth, the son of Adam and Eve, including \"The Second Treatise of the Great Seth\" and \"The Three Steles of Seth\". Although the Borborites did also use both the Old Testament and the New Testament, they renounced the God of the Old Testament as an imposter deity.\n\nEpiphanius of Salamis records that \"The Greater Questions of Mary\" contained an episode in which Jesus took Mary Magdalene up to the top of a mountain, where he pulled a woman out of his side and engaged in sexual intercourse with her. Then, upon ejaculating, Jesus drank his own semen and told Mary, \"Thus we must do, that we may live.\" Upon hearing this, Mary instantly fainted, to which Jesus responded by helping her up and telling her, \"O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?\"\n\nThey taught that there were eight heavens, each under a separate archon. In the seventh reigned Sabaoth, creator of heaven and earth, the God of the Jews, represented by some Borborites under the form of an ass or a hog; hence the Jewish prohibition of swine's flesh. In the eighth heaven reigned Barbelo, the mother of the living; the Father of All, the supreme God; and Jesus Christ. They denied that Christ was born of Mary, or had a real body; and also the resurrection of the body. \n\nThe human soul after death wanders through the seven heavens, until it obtains rest with Barbelo. Man possesses a soul in common with plants and beasts. According to Saint Augustine, they taught that the soul was derived from the substance of God, and hence could not be polluted by contact with matter.\n\nEpiphanius claims that the Borborites were inspired by Sethianism and that elements of sexual sacramentalism formed an important role in their rituals. He asserts that the Borborites engaged in a version of the eucharist in which they would smear their hands with menstrual blood and semen and consume them as the blood and body of Christ respectively. He also alleges that, whenever one of the women in their church was experiencing her monthly period, they would take her menstrual blood and everyone in the church would eat it as part of a sacred ritual. The Borborites were also said to extract fetuses from pregnant women and consume them, particularly if the women accidentally became pregnant during related sexual rituals.\n\nEpiphanius claimed to have some first-hand knowledge of the sect, and to have run away from certain Gnostic women who reproached him thus:\n\nEpiphanius later reported the group to the bishops, resulting in the expulsion of around 80 people from the city of Alexandria.\n\nBecause everything that is known about the Borborites comes exclusively from polemics written by their opponents, it is still disputed whether or not these reports accurately reflect Borborite teachings or if they are merely propaganda intended to discredit the Borborites. Stephen Gero finds the accounts written by Epiphanius and later writers plausible and connects them with earlier Gnostic myths.\n\nIt is highly improbable that the Borborites ever actually used this name to refer to themselves. Nonetheless, this name, along with their alternative names and the descriptions of their beliefs, reveals a connection to Barbelo. Some of the Gnostic scriptures have been called \"Barbeloite\" because of her appearance in them, such as the \"Apocryphon of John\" and \"Trimorphic Protennoia\". The last of these seems to have undergone Sethian revision, although similar, fully Sethian texts have their own distinct perspective—maybe suggesting some Sethians were inspired by Barbeloite writings. These writings do not mention any sexual rituals, but neither any moral codes. \"Trimorphic Protennoia\" does describe the divine as a sexual being, but being a highly esoteric work leaves much to the imagination. If the Barbelognostics were libertines and these are their writings, then the unfriendly account of Epiphanius has to be contrasted with the elegant spiritual writings they produced.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "847388", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=847388", "title": "Brunetto Latini", "text": "Brunetto Latini\n\nBrunetto Latini (c. 1220–1294) (who signed his name \"Burnectus Latinus\" in Latin and \"Burnecto Latino\" in Italian) was an Italian philosopher, scholar, notary, and statesman.\n\nBrunetto Latini was born in Florence in 1220 to a Tuscan noble family, the son of Buonaccorso Latini. He belonged to the Guelph party. He was a notary and a man of learning, much respected by his fellow citizens and famed for his skill as an orator. He expounded the writings of Cicero as guidance in public affairs.\n\nHe was of sufficient stature to be sent to Seville on an embassy to Alfonso el Sabio of Castile to seek help for Florence against the Sienese; the mission was unsuccessful. On his return from Spain, travelling along the Pass of Roncesvalles, he describes meeting a student from Bologna astride a bay mule, who told him of the defeat of the Guelphs at the Battle of Montaperti. As a result, Latini was exiled from his native city. He took refuge in France from 1261 to 1268 while working as a notary in Montpellier, Arras, Bar-sur-Aube, and Paris.\n\nIn 1269, when the political situation allowed, he returned to Tuscany and for some twenty years held successive high offices. In 1273 he was appointed as Secretary to the Council of the Republic of Florence. In 1280, he contributed to the temporary reconciliation between the Guelph and Ghibelline parties, and in 1284 presided over the conference in which an attack on Pisa was agreed. Finally, in 1287, he was elevated to the dignity of \"prior\" as one of 12 magistrates established through the constitution of 1282.\n\nGiovanni Villani says that \"he was a great philosopher and a consummate master of rhetoric, not only in knowing how to speak well, but how to write well\". He was the author of various works in prose and verse. He died in 1294, leaving behind a daughter, Bianca Latini, who had married Guido Di Filippo De' Castiglionchi in 1284. His tomb can be found in the church of Santa Maria Maggiore, Florence, to the left of the high altar.\n\nWhile in France, he wrote his Italian \"Tesoretto\" and in French his prose \"Li Livres dou Trésor\", both summaries of the encyclopaedic knowledge of the day. The latter is regarded as the first encyclopedia in a modern European language. The Italian 13th-century translation known as \"Tesoro\" was misattributed to Bono Giamboni. He also translated into Italian the \"Rettorica\" and three \"Orations\" by Cicero. The Italian translation of Aristotle's \"Nicomachean Ethics\" is often misattributed to Brunetto Latini: it is a work of Taddeo Alderotti instead.\n\nLatini was Dante’s guardian after the death of his father. Early Dante commentators spoke of Brunetto as his teacher, as does Dante himself. Vittorio Imbriani took issue with that concept, saying Brunetto was far too busy a man to have been a mere teacher. Dante immortalized him in the Divine Comedy (see Inferno, XV.82-87). It is also believed that there was an intellectual and affectionate bond between the elderly man and the young poet. It was perhaps Latini who induced Dante to read Cicero and Boethius, after the death of Beatrice.\n\nMany of the characters in Dante's Inferno are also mentioned in the legal and diplomatic documents Brunetto Latini wrote in Latin. There is a portrait of Latini in the \"Bargello\" in Florence, once reputed to be by Giotto, beside the one of Dante. In a wood engraving, Gustave Doré envisages the same scene from Inferno XV, 1861.\n\nDante places Latini within the third ring of the Seventh Circle, the Circle of the Violent against God, nature and art, with the sodomites, blasphemers, and profligates. Dante writes of the \"clerks and great and famous scholars, defiled in the world by one and the same sin\".\n\nDante's treatment of Latini, however, is commendatory beyond almost any other figure in the 'Inferno'. He calls the poet \"a radiance among men and speaks with gratitude of that sweet image, gentle and paternal, / you were to me in the world when hour by hour / you taught me how man makes himself eternal\". Dante addresses Latini with the respectful pronoun \"voi\"; Latini uses the informal \"tu\", as perhaps was their custom when they spoke together in Florence. The portrait is drawn with love, pathos and a dignity that is more compelling given the squalor of the punishment.\n\nLatini asks first, humbly, if he may keep Dante company, letting his group run on. Dante offers to sit down with him but that would only increase Latini’s penalty; he and the other souls are doomed to keep moving aimlessly around the arena.\n\nLatini proceeds in obscure imagery to foretell Dante's future. The malicious ingrates who of old descended from \"Fiesole\", will be his enemies. They are reputed blind, avaricious, envious and proud. Let him beware, he warns, not to be stained by them. Mark Musa suggests that in this speech between the two there is sexual imagery indicative of the act of sodomy .\n\nAccording to John D. Sinclair, Dante respected Latini immensely but nonetheless felt it necessary to place him with the sodomites since, according to Sinclair, such behaviour by Latini was well known in Florence at the time. The squalor of Latini’s sin and penalty is nevertheless painful for Dante to visualize. \n\nOther critics point to the fact that, outside of the Divine Comedy, there are no firm historical records suggesting Latini was accused of sodomy or homosexual relations - and indeed he seemingly condemns it himself in the \"Tesoretto\". Some therefore have suggested perhaps that Latini is placed in Canto XV for being violent against art and against his vernacular (Latini wrote in French instead of Florentine, which Dante championed as a literary language in De Vulgari Eloquentia); or perhaps also to demonstrate and underline that even the greatest of men may be guilty of private sins. Neither objection rules out the possibility that he was guilty of the perceived sin himself; and given the setting and context, it is difficult to see that there can be any doubt, particularly following the discovery in recent years of a love poem, \"S'eo son distretto inamoratamente\" which Latini seems to have sent to another man, Bondie Dietaiuti.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "23897688", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23897688", "title": "Causes of karma in Jainism", "text": "Causes of karma in Jainism\n\nThe karmic process in Jainism is based on seven truths or fundamental principles (\"tattva\") of Jainism which explain the human predicament. Out of those, four—influx (āsrava), bondage (\"bandha\"), stoppage (\"saṃvara\") and release (\"nirjarā\")—pertain to the karmic process. Karma gets bound to the soul on account of two processes:\n\nThe \"āsrava\", that is, the influx of karma occurs when the karmic particles are attracted to the soul on account of vibrations created by activities of mind, speech and body. \"Tattvārthasūtra\", 6:1–2 states: \"The activities of body, speech and mind is called \"yoga\". This three-fold action results in \"āsrava\" or influx of karma.\" The karmic inflow on account of \"yoga\" driven by passions and emotions cause a long term inflow of karma prolonging the cycle of reincarnations. On the other hand, the karmic inflows on account of actions that are not driven by passions and emotions have only a transient, short-lived karmic effect.\n\nThe karmas are attracted to the consciousness by combination of the following factors pertaining to action—instrumentality, process, modality and motivation Thus, the karmas are attracted and bound on account of combination any element of the following four factors:\n\nWith a combination of any of the elements of the above four factors, there are 108 ways with which the karmas can be attracted to the soul. Even a silent assent or endorsements of acts of violence done by someone else far away, have karmic consequences for the soul. Hence, the scriptures advice carefulness in actions, awareness of the world, and purity in thoughts as a means to avoid the karmas.\n\nThe karmas have effect only when they are bound to the consciousness. This binding of the karma to the consciousness is called \"bandha\". However, the \"yoga\" or the activities alone do not produce bondage. Out of the many causes of bondage, passion is considered as the main cause of bondage. The karmas are literally bound on account of the stickiness of the soul due to existence of various passions or mental dispositions. The passions like anger, pride, deceit and greed are called sticky (\"kasayas\") because they act like glue in making karmic particles stick to the soul resulting in \"bandha\". Hence the ancient Jain texts talk of subduing these negative emotions:\n\nWhen he wishes that which is good for him, he should get rid of the four fault—anger, pride, deceit and greed—which increase the evil. Anger and pride when not suppressed, and deceit and greed when arising: all these four black passions water the roots of re-birth.\n\n—\"Daśavaikālika sūtra, 8:36–39\n\nAccording to \"Tattvārthasūtra\", the causes of karmic bondage—in the order they are required to be eliminated by a soul for spiritual progress—are:\n\nEach cause presupposes the existence of the next cause, but the next cause does not necessarily pre-suppose the existence of the previous cause. A soul is able to advances on the spiritual ladder called \"\", only when it is able to eliminate the above causes of bondage one by one. Duration and intensity of the karmic bond are determined by \"\" and type and quantity of the karmas bound depends on \"yoga\".\n\nChapter VI of \"Tattvārthasūtra\" provides a detailed description of various causes for various types of karmas. According to Jain texts, there are eight main types of karma—\"jñānavāraṇa\" (Knowledge obscuring karma), \"darśanāvaraṇa\" (perception obscuring karma) \"mohanīya\" (deluding karma), \"antarāya\" (obstacles creating karma), \"vedanīya\" (feeling producing karma), \"nāma\" (body determining karma), \"āyu\" (life span determining karma) and \"gotra\" (status determining karma).\n\n\"Jñānavāraṇa\" and \"darśanāvaraṇa\" karma are knowledge obscuring and perception obscuring. They are caused by:\n\n\"Vedanīya\", feeling producing karmas can be of two types: \"sātāvedanīya\" i.e. pleasant and \"asātāvedanīya\" i.e. unpleasant feeling producing karmas.\n\n\"Asātāvedanīya\" karma is bound on account of causing to other or oneself the following:\n\n\"Sātāvedanīya\" karma is bound on account of causing to other or oneself the following:\n\n\"Mohanīya\" karmas produce a delusion in a soul i.e. the soul is not able to distinguish between right and wrong. They are of two subtypes—\"Darśana-mohanīya\" (Perception delusion) and \"cāritra-mohanīya\" (conduct deluding) karmas.\n\n\n\nThe \"āyu\" karmas are the life span determining karmas and they determine the next destiny or reincarnation of a soul. Accordingly, as per the next reincarnations lifespan determined, a soul takes birth in either hell, heaven, animal kingdom or as a human (this list is not exhaustive).\n\nFollowing reasons result in birth in naraka or hells:\n\nFollowing actions conducted with deceit lead to births animals, plants or microbes:\n\n\nPracticing vows and austerities normally leads to destruction of karmas and of attainment of \"moksa\" or liberation, but in above cases leads to merit and birth in heavens as demi-gods for a long but finite period of time.\n\nThe \"nāma\" karmas or body determining karmas are of two types—\"asubha\" and \"subha nama\" karmas i.e. auspicious and inauspicious karmas. Their causes are:\n\nThe \"gotra\" karma or status determining karma is of two types:\n\nThe causes of inflow of obstructing or \"antarāya\" karma are—causing obstruction to others or intending to place or placing obstacles before others in their attempts towards beneficence, gain, satisfaction, comfort and power.\n\n"}

It is based at the Holy Cross Church in Frankfurt-Bornheim and is dedicated to services, contemplation, meditation, retreats, counseling, and other events such as concerts.\n\nWhen Franz Kamphaus, then bishop of Limburg, visited the parishes of Frankfurt in 2004, he met people who were open to spiritual experiences but not within the traditional churches. He founded the centre in 2007. On 15 January he signed the charter of foundation for the theme church Holy Cross – Centre for Christian Meditation and Spirituality in Frankfurt-Bornheim. The charter of foundation came into effect on 1 July 2007.\n\nThe Holy Cross Church accommodates one of five profile churches of the Diocese of Limburg. The others are the Centre for Mourning Counselling in St. Michael in Frankfurt-Nordend and the three youth churches: Crossover in St. Hildegard in Limburg an der Lahn, Jona in St. Bonifatius in Frankfurt-Sachsenhausen, and Kana in Maria-Hilf in Wiesbaden-Nordost. Like the church St. Michael, the Holy Cross Church is a branch church of the parish St. Josef Frankfurt. The centre is a pastoral institution of the diocese and is subordinated to the head of department of the Episcopalian chair (Dr. Hildegard Wustmans). The centre was directed from 2007 until October 2018 by the Franciscan Helmut Schlegel OFM, where he still works as a retreat and meditation leader and priestly co-worker. Since November 2018 the centre is directed by Samuel Stricker a spiritual guide and retreat guide who works with a team of contributors, for example from the order of Medical Missionary Sisters (MMS).\n\nAlthough the offerings of the centre reflect the tenets of Christianity, the target audience includes people of all religious denominations, worldviews, and cultures. The center offers different kinds of church services, such as expressionist dance, meditation courses, contemplative prayer, Zen-meditation courses, days of reflection, spiritual exercises, retreats, lectures by guest speakers such as Anselm Grün, meditations with the Sōtō-Zen-priest and veteran of the Vietnam War Claude AnShin Thomas, and many other kinds of events. The team publishes a new program annually.\n\nEvent series include days of exercises of Christian mysticism, meditative singing, spiritual guided city tours in which topics by Frankfurt tourist guides are joined with spiritual topics or pilgrim hikes with a picnic and devotions. One-time events are also part of the program, for example, the \"Tram of Silence\" tram rides on an historic railcar of the Frankfurt tramway system, including elements such as silence with short, thought-provoking impulses to the senses of seeing, hearing, feeling, and smelling.\n\nThe dialogue between the cultures and major religious groups concerning meditation and spirituality is another important aspect of the work of the centre. These include panel discussions with representatives of Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, and Christianity about meditation, with personal field reports from the different religions. Other examples are courses in Yoga and Yoga nidra, or dance performances of an Indian Jesuit padre who figures elements of traditional meditative dances such as Bharatanatyam from Hinduism as a kind of prayer to God.\n\nFor the last few years, a Cretan-style labyrinth consisting of 2,500 tealights has been formed on the third Saturday of Advent before the Gaudete Sunday. This labyrinth is part of the service and can be walked through by visitors.\n\nDuring the Frankfurt festival of light in 2014 the team members of the centre offered a meditation consisting of light, words, music, and sound in cooperation with the Jona youth church in the Frankfurt Cathedral.\nConcert performances at the center have included \"A German Requiem\" by Johannes Brahms and meditative music from the Middle Ages by Hildegard of Bingen, Peter Abelard, and Rabanus Maurus.\n\nThe interior of the church was modified for the new purpose, completed in 2010. nterior. The fixed pews were removed and replaced by folding chairs which enabled a more flexible use. While the former main altar is normally not used, a smaller wooden altar has been added, typically surrounded by circles of folding chairs. Stairlifts and ramps for wheelchairs were installed. The former crypt and the rooms of the former clergy house were transformed to be used for meditation. In the crypt, the floor was changed to wood, and the meditation area was enclosed by textile panels made from linen.\n\nThe Centre of Christian Meditation and Spirituality is located in the parish area of the Catholic parish St. Josef Frankfurt am Main, which was founded as a \"parish of a new type\" on 1 January 2015. In the new greater parish area there are four churches located as \"church places\" and two churches as \"theme churches\". One of the two theme churches is the Holy Cross Church, which headquarters the meditation centre and is used for church services and centre events. The buildings are administrated by the Catholic Church of the city of Frankfurt am Main. There is an active collaboration with the parish of St. Josef Frankfurt am Main. During the restoration period of the church St. Leonhard in the Frankfurt Altstadt, beginning on 7 May 2011, the church services of the International English-speaking Catholic parishes of the Frankfurt area have taken place in the Holy Cross Church.\n\nThe Holy Cross Church is one-minute walking distance from the \"Ernst-May-Platz\" tram stop of the tramline 14 of the Frankfurt tramway, and the Stadtbahn station \"Eissporthalle/Festplatz\" of the line U7 of the Frankfurt light rail system. Also not far away is the motorway exit \"Frankfurt-Ost\" of the Federal Motorway 661.\n\nBeneath the Bornheim slope to the east of the meditation centre runs a branch of the German Camino de Santiago (Way of St. James). The route is based on the ancient trade route from Leipzig to Frankfurt am Main (\"Des Reiches Straße\"). The way starts in the bishop city Fulda and continues through Schlüchtern, Steinau an der Straße, Bad Soden-Salmünster, Gelnhausen, Langenselbold, Erlensee, and Bruchköbel. It belongs to the network of main pilgrimage routes to the grave of St. James in the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela. This branch, which is 116 km long, passes the Holy Cross Church and leads through the Ostpark, and then passes the Seat of the European Central Bank at the former Großmarkthalle (Wholesale Market Hall) on its route to the Main River and the inner city of Frankfurt am Main. It also passes the Eiserner Steg (an iron footbridge) and continues to Mainz and Trier.\n\n"}

Implementations of the specification offer a runtime component model, that allows for plugins to be installed, started, stopped, updated and uninstalled without requiring the application container to be stopped. The specification relies heavily on the Inversion of control principle, in order to make it easier for application components to discover and interact with each other.\n\nColony aims to eliminate the complexity typically associated with the creation of modular applications, through a simplified unified model for component development. Practical applications can range from modular enterprise software to application mashing.\n\nColony gathers inspiration from other modularity solutions such as OSGi for the Java programming language and Managed Extensibility Framework (MEF) for the .NET Framework.\n\nColony aims to be a platform and language independent specification, and serve a wide range of use cases. This includes use cases typically associated with OSGi, such as modularized application with a narrow core and large extensibility possibilities. This also includes use cases to which MEF caters, such as adding modularity to an existing application, without the developer having to create its own plugin infrastructure from scratch.\n\nThe need for reducing the number of configuration steps for assembling a computing grid, as well as supporting adding nodes and distributing computation to them as quickly as possible, also drives the Colony Distributed initiative.\n\nThe Colony conceptual model builds on top of 6 key concepts.\n\n\nThe plugin lifecycle includes loading and unloading its resources, injecting it into others as a capability or dependency, as well as having capabilities and/or dependencies injected into it.\n\nThe framework proposes the concept of Viral Distribution where computation can be transparently distributed to any number of nodes, by having each node run a Colony instance. The concept takes advantage of the modularity approach, by using the plugin as the unit to be transferred between nodes. The concept also requires the availability of tools for rapid discovery of new nodes (e.g. using Zeroconf techniques such as Bonjour through Colony Bonjour Plugin).\n\nViral distribution, as per the Colony interpretation, would mean that a configured Colony instance could make its computing power available to a Colony managed computing grid, by announcing its specifications, after which it would receive work units in the form of plugins, i.e., mobile code for execution on the instance.\n\nTo set up a new Colony instance, and enabling viral distribution support, would require an operating system, basic Colony dependencies (e.g. a virtual machine for the Colony implementation language of choice) and the framework manager itself (e.g. using the installer). Adding the basic bundles required for accessing and downloading from a remote plugin repository to the instance would complete the bootstrap. The node would then announce its availability to the Distribution Server Plugin, and could begin receiving and processing work.\n\nColony framework includes a set of application components for various functions, from domain-specific sub-frameworks to providers for common protocols and services.\n\nNotable components include a complete web application framework, based on the MVC architecture pattern, similar to Ruby on Rails and Django.\nThe web stack is supported by a modular HTTP server implementation developed from the ground up under the Colony design philosophy. In practice this implies that even core HTTP server components, such as filesystem access and socket interfaces, are provided as modules and can be hotswapped.\nThe web MVC plugin also uses the modular ORM entity manager plugin.\nFor managing distribution, the distribution manager component acts as a hub for the various distribution plugins that implement's Colony's viral distribution concept.\n\nAmong other available components are a build automation component (functionally comparable to Maven); an extensible revision control facade with extensions available for Subversion, Bazaar and Mercurial; a self-contained Wiki application, leveraging the Revision control plugins. For integration with other technologies, Colony provides servers and clients for common protocols such as SMTP, BitTorrent, DNS, IRC, POP, Telnet, XMPP, LDAP as well as support for Bonjour (Apple Inc.'s implementation of Zeroconf).\nSome niche components are also included, such as clients for the Twitter API and Apple Push Notification Service.\n\nAs of 2011, Colony is considered to be in alpha although production deployments exist.\n\n\n"}

It does not answer questions about how/when/why the characteristics occurred. Rather it addresses the \"what\" question (what are the characteristics of the population or situation being studied?) The characteristics used to describe the situation or population are usually some kind of categorical scheme also known as descriptive categories. For example, the periodic table categorizes the elements. Scientists use knowledge about the nature of electrons, protons and neutrons to devise this categorical scheme. We now take for granted the periodic table, yet it took descriptive research to devise it. Descriptive research generally precedes explanatory research. For example, over time the periodic table’s description of the elements allowed scientists to explain chemical reaction and make sound prediction when elements were combined.\nHence, descriptive research cannot describe what caused a situation. Thus, descriptive research cannot be used as the basis of a \"causal relationship\", where one variable affects another. In other words, descriptive research can be said to have a low requirement for internal validity.\n\nThe description is used for frequencies, averages and other statistical calculations. Often the best approach, prior to writing descriptive research, is to conduct a survey investigation. Qualitative research often has the aim of \"description\" and researchers may follow-up with examinations of why the observations exist and what the implications of the findings are.\n\nIn addition, the conceptualizing of descriptive research (categorization or taxonomy) precedes the hypotheses of explanatory research. For a discussion of how the underlying conceptualization of Exploratory research, Descriptive research and explanatory research fit together see Conceptual framework.\nDescriptive research is also known as Statistical Research. The main goal of this type of research is to describe the data and characteristics about what is being studied. The idea behind this type of research is to study frequencies, averages, and other statistical calculations. Although this research is highly accurate, it does not gather the causes behind a situation. Descriptive research is mainly done when a researcher wants to gain a better understanding of a topic. That is, analysis of the past as opposed to the future. Descriptive research is the exploration of the existing certain phenomena. The details of the facts won't be known. The existing phenomena’s facts are not known to the person.\n\nDescriptive science is a category of science that involves descriptive research; that is, observing, recording, describing, and classifying phenomena. Descriptive research is sometimes contrasted with hypothesis-driven research, which is focused on testing a particular hypothesis by means of experimentation.\n\nDavid A. Grimaldi and Michael S. Engel suggest that descriptive science in biology is currently undervalued and misunderstood:\n\"Descriptive\" in science is a pejorative, almost always preceded by \"merely,\" and typically applied to the array of classical -ologies and -omies: anatomy, archaeology, astronomy, embryology, morphology, paleontology, taxonomy, botany, cartography, stratigraphy, and the various disciplines of zoology, to name a few. [...] First, an organism, object, or substance is not described in a vacuum, but rather in comparison with other organisms, objects, and substances. [...] Second, descriptive science is not necessarily low-tech science, and high tech is not necessarily better. [...] Finally, a theory is only as good as what it explains and the evidence (i.e., descriptions) that supports it.\n\nA negative attitude by scientists toward descriptive science is not limited to biological disciplines: Lord Rutherford's notorious quote, \"All science is either physics or stamp collecting,\" displays a clear negative attitude about descriptive science, and it is known that he was dismissive of astronomy, which at the beginning of the 20th century was still gathering largely descriptive data about stars, nebulae, and galaxies, and was only beginning to develop a satisfactory integration of these observations within the framework of physical law, a cornerstone of the philosophy of physics.\n\nIlkka Niiniluoto has used the terms \"descriptive sciences\" and \"design sciences\" as an updated version of the distinction between basic and applied science. According to Niiniluoto, descriptive sciences are those that seek to describe reality, while design sciences seek useful knowledge for human activities.\n\n\n"}

Higgs and Barbara Isabel Stowe. His pre-school years were in North Delta, British Columbia (near Vancouver). He attended public school in Thornhill, Ontario (near Toronto), and secondary school (Brantford Collegiate and Pauline Johnston Secondary School) in Brantford. In 1976 he turned away from what had been a strong early passion for physics and engineering, and attend the Integrated Studies Program at the University of Waterloo. The Integrated Studies Program was student-driven and required self-motivation to complete an open curriculum in a subjects of the student's choosing. He completed an undergraduate thesis, \"A theory for the interaction of ecology and the social order,\" that blended history of ecology with social philosophy and environmental ethics. Immediately upon graduation with a Bachelor of Independent Studies (B.I.S.) in 1979, he took up an internship at the Hastings Centre (Institute for the Study of Ethics, Society and the Life Sciences) in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York, where he undertook a project on environmental and ecological ethics. He completed a master's degree in philosophy of science at the University of Western Ontario (1980–81), and at the same time undertook ecological consulting work in Southern Ontario. He returned to the University of Waterloo to a new interdisciplinary doctoral program, in which he combined studies in the Department of Philosophy and the School of Urban and Regional Planning. Working with co-supervisors, Lawrence Haworth, a social and moral philosopher, and Robert Dorney, an ecologist and environmental planner, Higgs completed his dissertation, \"Planning, Technology and Community Autonomy,\" in 1988.\n\nHe is a Professor at the University of Victoria in the School of Environmental Studies.\n\nHis first appointment was in the Department of Environment and Resource Studies at the University Waterloo (1987–88).

Higgs' taught at Oberlin College as a Visiting Assistant Professor in the Environmental Studies Program in 1989-90, before taking a tenure-stream position in the new Science, Technology and Society Program at the University of Alberta. The demise of this program led to a formal appointment initially in the Department of Philosophy (1990–92), and later a joint appointment in the Departments of Anthropology and Sociology. He was awarded tenure and promoted to Associate Professor in 1995. In 2002, he became Director (2002-2010) and Associate Professor in the School of Environmental Studies at the University of Victoria, and promoted to Full Professor in 2005.\n\nHiggs has held shorter appointments in Science, Technology and Society (1995), the Maurice Young Centre for Applied Ethics at the University of British Columbia (1996), the School of Environmental Studies at the University of Victoria (2000).

The date of its composition is unclear, and the text evolved significantly over the author's lifetime.\n\nIt is traditionally thought to have been composed in 1227, shortly after Dōgen's return to Japan from his years of study in China. This is based on a statement to that effect in his essay Bendōwa from 1231. However, a manuscript of \"Fukan zazengi\" discovered in modern times that was produced by Dōgen's own hand ends with a Colophon (publishing) stating it was written in 1233. This version, known as the Tenpuku manuscript, also has a number of major differences from the more widely known version, the \"vulgate version\". The vulgate version, which is included in the Eihei Kōroku, likely has an even later date. Carl Bielefeldt, a scholar of Dōgen's work, believes it could not have been composed before 1242 based on similarities with the Shōbōgenzō book \"Zazen shin\", which was composed in that year. There is also a Shōbōgenzō book entitled Zazen gi, composed sometime between 1243 and 1246, that appears to draw material from the vulgate \"Fukan zazengi\" and thus suggesting it would not have been written afterwards. Regardless of the exact date of its first composition, it is clear the material went through many rounds of editing over the author's lifetime.\n\nMuch of the section describing the actual practice of zazen is copied from the \"Zuochan yi\", a meditation manual written by Changlu Zongze in the early 12th century.\n"}

The present is an objective property, to be compared with a moving spotlight. By the passage of time more of the world comes into being; therefore, the block universe is said to be growing. The growth of the block is supposed to happen in the present, a very thin slice of spacetime, where more of spacetime is continually coming into being.\n\nThe growing block view is an alternative to both eternalism (according to which past, present, and future all exist) and presentism (according to which only the present exists). It is held to be closer to common-sense intuitions than the alternatives. C. D. Broad was a proponent of the theory (1923). Some modern defenders are Michael Tooley (in 1997) and Peter Forrest (in 2004).\n\nRecently several philosophers, David Braddon-Mitchell (2004), Craig Bourne and Trenton Merricks have noted that if the growing block view is correct then we have to conclude that we do not know whether now is now. (The first occurrence of \"now\" is an indexical and the second occurrence of \"now\" is the objective tensed property. Their observation implies the following sentence: \"This part of spacetime has the property of being present\".)\n\nTake Socrates discussing, in the past, with Gorgias, and at the same time thinking that the discussion is occurring now. According to the growing block view, tense is a real property of the world so his thought is about now, the objective present. He thinks, tenselessly, that his thought is occurring on the edge of being. But we know he is wrong because he is in the past; he does not know that now is now. But how can we be sure we are not in the same position? There is nothing special with Socrates. Therefore, we do not know whether now is now.\n\nHowever, some have argued that there is an ontological distinction between the past and the present. For instance, Forrest (2004) argues that although there exists a past, it is lifeless and inactive. Consciousness, as well as the flow of time, is not active within the past and can only occur at the boundary of the block universe in which the present exists.\n\n\n"}

The book appears ninth in the 75 fascicle version of the Shōbōgenzō, and it is ordered 44th in the later chronological 95 fascicle \"\"Honzan\" edition\". It was presented to his students in the fourth month of 1243 at Rokuharamitsu-ji, a temple in a neighborhood of eastern Kyoto populated primarily by military officials of the new Kamakura shogunate. This was the same location where he presented another book of the same collection called Zenki. Both were short works compared to others in the collection, and in both cases he was likely invited to present them at the behest of his main patron, Hatano Yoshishige, who lived nearby. Later in the same year, Dōgen suddenly abandoned his temple Kōshōhōrin-ji in Kyoto and began to establish Eihei-ji.\n\nThe first half of the text stakes out a novel interpretation of the meaning of the term \"Kobutsu\" (古佛), literally meaning \"Old Buddha\". While typically the term had been used to refer to the Seven Buddhas of Antiquity, Dōgen uses it to refer to all of those before him who have passed on the Zen tradition. More specifically, Dōgen denies the duality of the buddhas of the ancient past and the practitioners of the more recent past and present. He then supports this usage by citing examples from Zen records of the past teachers Tiantong Rujing, Yuanwu Keqin, Sushan Guangren,\nand Xuefeng Yicun. \n\nThe second half of the text focuses on the full term used as the title of the book, \"Kobutushin\" (古佛心), literally \"Old Buddha Mind\". He does so through the presentation of a famous saying from Nanyang Huizhong, the so-called \"National Teacher\", who said the old buddha mind is nothing other than \"fences, walls, tiles, and pebbles\", which is to say everyday reality and the phenomena that comprise it. Dōgen then engages in his characteristic wordplay by rearranging the characters of the term, speaking of \"old Buddha\", \"old mind\", and even the strange expression \"Buddha old\". To conclude, he cites Jianyuan Zhongxing, who said that \"old buddha mind\" is the same as \"the world collapses in ruins\", before finally putting this phrase in his own terms, writing that the old buddha mind must be \"sloughed off\" to really know the old buddha mind. He also reiterates that the old buddha mind extends to times both before and after the Seven Buddhas of Antiquity.\n"}

Wing-tsit Chan explains that \"li\" originally meant \"a religious sacrifice,\" but has come to mean ceremony, ritual, decorum, rules of propriety, good form, good custom, etc., and has even been equated with Natural law.\"\n\nIn Chinese cosmology, human agency participates in the ordering of the universe by Li ('rites'). There are several Chinese definitions of a rite, one of the most common definitions is that it transforms the invisible to visible; through the performance of rites at appropriate occasions, humans make visible the underlying order. Performing the correct ritual focuses, links, orders, and moves the social, which is the human realm, in correspondence with the terrestrial and celestial realms to keep all three in harmony. This procedure has been described as centering, which used to be the duty of the Son of Tian, the emperor. But it was also done by all those who conducted state, ancestral, and life-cycle rites and, in another way, by Daoists who conducted the rites of local gods as a centering of the forces of exemplary history, of liturgical service, of the correct conduct of human relations, and of the arts of divination such as the earliest of all Chinese classics—the \"Book of Changes\" (\"Yi Jing\")—joining textual learning to bodily practices for health and the harmonized enhancement of circuits of energy (qi). \n\nThe rites of \"li\" are not rites in the Western conception of religious custom. Rather, \"li\" embodies the entire spectrum of interaction with humans, nature, and even material objects. Confucius includes in his discussions of \"li\" such diverse topics as learning, tea drinking, titles, mourning, and governance. Xunzi cites \"songs and laughter, weeping and lamentation...rice and millet, fish and meat...the wearing of ceremonial caps, embroidered robes, and patterned silks, or of fasting clothes and mourning clothes...unspacious rooms and very nonsecluded halls, hard mats, seats and flooring\" as vital parts of the fabric of \"li\".\n\nAmong the earliest historical discussions on \"li\" stands the 25th year of Zhao Gong () in the Zuo Zhuan.\n\n\"Li\" consists of the norms of proper social behavior as taught to others by fathers, village elders and government officials. The teachings of li promoted ideals such as filial piety, brotherliness, righteousness, good faith and loyalty. The influence of \"li\" guided public expectations, such as the loyalty to superiors and respect for elders in the community.\n\nContinuous with the emphasis on community, following \"li\" included the internalization of action, which both yields the comforting feeling of tradition and allows one to become \"more open to the panoply of sensations of the experience\" (Rosemont 2005). But it should also maintain a healthy practice of selflessness, both in the actions themselves and in the proper example which is set for one's brothers. Approaches in the community, as well as personal approaches together demonstrate how \"li\" pervades in all things, the broad and the detailed, the good and the bad, the form and the formlessness. This is the complete realization of \"li\".\n\nThe rituals and practices of \"li\" are dynamic in nature. \"Li\" practices have been revised and evaluated throughout time to reflect the emerging views and beliefs found in society. Although these practices may change, which happens very slowly over time, the fundamental ideals remain at the core of \"li\", which largely relate to social order.\n\nConfucius envisioned proper government being guided by the principles of \"li\". Some Confucians proposed the perfectibility of human beings with learning Li as an important part of that process. Overall, Confucians believed governments should place more emphasis on \"li\" and rely much less on penal punishment when they govern.\n\nConfucius stressed the importance of the rites as fundamental to proper governmental leadership. In his sayings, Confucius regarded feudal lords in China that adopted the Chinese rites as being just rulers of the Central States. Contrarily, feudal lords that did not adopt these rites were considered uncivilized, not worthy of being considered Chinese or part of the Central States (Spring and Autumn Annals).\n\n\"Li\" should be practiced by all members of the society. \"Li\" also involves the superior treating the inferior with propriety and respect. As Confucius said \"a prince should employ his minister according to the rules of propriety (Li); ministers should serve their prince with loyalty\" (Analects, 3:19).\n\n\"Li\" is \"one term by which the [traditional Chinese] historiographers could name all the principles of conservatism they advanced in the speeches of their characters.\" \n\n"}

Other countries may have medical doctrines or legal rules covering broadly similar grounds. The term clinical medical necessity is also used. In contrast, unnecessary health care lacks such justification.\n\nMedicare pays for medical items and services that are \"reasonable and necessary\" for a variety of purposes. By statute, Medicare may only pay for items and services that are \"reasonable and necessary\"for the diagnosis or treatment of illness or injury or to improve the functioning of a malformed body member\", unless there is another statutory authorization for payment.\n\nMedicare has a number of policies, including National coverage determinations (NCDs) and Local Coverage Determinations (LCDs), formerly known as Local Medical Review Policies (LMRP), that describe coverage criteria.\n\nIn a small number of cases, Medicare may determine if a method of treating a patient should be covered on a case-by-case basis. Even if a service is medically determined to be \"reasonable and necessary,\" coverage may be limited if the service is provided more frequently than allowed under Medicare coverage policies.\n\nThe use of cannabis (also known as marijuana) for medical purposes is a notable 'medical necessity' case. Cannabis is a plant whose active ingredients are widely reported by sufferers to be effective in pain control for various conditions, usually neuropathic in nature, where common painkillers have not had great benefit; however as a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substance Act, it is illegal and is targeted by government, police, and anti-drug campaigners: in some states, possession is decriminalized for even non-medical purposes, wherein other states possession is a felony offense. In this case the doctrine of medical necessity would be used by a patient who believed marijuana was beneficial to them if charged with use or growing/production of illegal controlled substance relating to marijuana.\n\nIn several medical marijuana cases, the patients' physician has been willing to state to the court that the patient's condition requires this medicine and thus that the Court should not interfere. However, the Supreme Court of United States has outrightly rejected this defense in the landmark case \"United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative\", in which the Court ruled that there was no medical necessity exception to drug laws, and federal government is free to raid, arrest, prosecute, and imprison patients who are using medical marijuana no matter if the medicine is crucially necessary to them. On the other hand, in \"Gonzales v. Raich\", the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals told a sufferer in extreme pain that they could not rely on state law allowing medical use, but if arrested they could seek to use medical necessity as a defence.\n\nIn the state of Maryland, a bill signed by former governor Robert Ehrlich, became law in 2003 permitting patients to use medical necessity defense to marijuana possession in the state. The maximum penalty for these users cannot exceed $100. However, this law does not prevent federal prosecution of patients, as the federal law does not recognize medical necessity. \n\n\n"}

The text of the decree underwent several changes before being completely reformed by a decree of October 28, 1982, which renamed the decoration Médaille de la Famille française (\"Medal of the French Family\"). This decree came into force on January 1, 1983, and was completed by an \"arrêté\" (administrative order) of March 15, 1983. The reform opened the award of the decoration to fathers or anyone else who had raised several children in an appropriate way: for example, the Catholic priest Père Mayotte, curate of the parish of Randan, Puy-de-Dôme was granted the award in recognition of his raising the six children of his housekeeper, a widow who died suddenly.\n\nThree classes of medal exist: bronze for those raising four or five children, silver for parents of six or seven children, and gold for those with eight or more children. A bronze medal is also granted to widowed mothers of three children whose husbands have been killed in action. The recipient's eldest child must be at least sixteen years old. The medal is decorated with the words \"Famille Française\" (\"French Family\") and a modernistic image of a couple and their children. The words \"République Française\" (\"French Republic\") are inscribed on the reverse side. The ribbon is divided vertically into three equal parts, the outer two being red and the inner green. Recipients of silver and gold medals are also granted a rosette in the same colours.\n\nRecommendations or applications for the award must be deposited at the local town hall. An enquiry into the family is then conducted. If the enquiry reports positively, the final decision on whether to grant the award belongs to the prefect of the department. While the award has always been open to mothers raising families alone, and to other single parents and legal guardians since the 1982 reforms, this applies only in cases of widowhood or abandonment: the medal is only granted to divorced parents in the most exceptional circumstances. The medal may be awarded posthumously, provided that the application is made within two years of the recipient's death.\n\n\n"}

Kitcher has held faculty positions at the University of Vermont, the University of Minnesota, and University of California, San Diego, and a visiting position at University of Michigan. In 1998 she went to Columbia University where she became the Mark van Doren Professor of the Humanities and chair of the philosophy department. She lives in New York City with her husband, Philip Kitcher, also a philosopher, with whom she has two sons, Andrew and Charles.\n\nKitcher's interest in cognition manifested early and has continued to shape and inform her work throughout her career. Her doctoral dissertation defended a psychological continuity criterion for personal identity but extended the scope of the psychological criterion beyond that traditionally posited to include broader and more abstract cognitive characteristics, such as cognitive approach or cognitive style. Since then her work has ranged widely from traditional philosophy of psychology, to Sigmund Freud, and ultimately to her greatest philosophical passion: Kant scholarship.\n\nIn her early work Kitcher wrote a number of papers in philosophy of psychology, philosophy of mind, and philosophy of science. She argued for the viability of intentional psychology and the autonomy of functionalist psychology from neurophysiology. Later work predominantly concentrated on analysis of problems stemming from the interpretation of Kant's first Critique. Kitcher has written numerous articles on the forms of intuition, Kant's epistemology, self-consciousness, and on how transcendental arguments work.\nKitcher has written two books that also pursue psychological themes. \"Kant's Transcendental Psychology\" was a radical departure from most Kant exegesis. The book makes two main claims about the \"Critique of Pure Reason\". First, contra Peter Frederick Strawson, Kitcher argues that to understand synthetic a priori knowledge, it is essential to consider transcendental psychology. Second, she explicates a Kantian argument for the necessity of an integrated thinking subject, which serves as a reply to David Hume's denial of the unity of the self.\n\n\"Kant's Thinker\" (2011), was called \"an ambitious and challenging work\" by Paul Guyer in the \"European Journal of Philosophy\". In this book, she continues work on \"a central theme of her earlier work: how to understand Kant's view of the unity of self-consciousness in the \"Critique of Pure Reason\".\"\n\nIn \"Freud's Dream\" Kitcher argued that Freud was the first cognitive scientist: Psychoanalysis should be thought of as an exercise in interdisciplinary theory construction, and as such, it illuminates the pitfalls to which such interdisciplinary approaches are subject. (Kitcher jokes that her arguments managed to alienate all readers: Freudians, because she exposes the mistaken foundation of psychoanalysis, and anti-Freudians, because she portrays his program as scientifically legitimate.)\n\nAround the turn of the new century, Kitcher's interests turned toward Kantian ethics. Her works from this period provide an account of Kantian maxims and an interpretation of Kant's argument for the Formulation of the Universal Law for the Categorical Imperative, a task that has led many other Kant experts to throw up their hands in perplexity.\n\nKitcher's published contributions to philosophy are matched by her contributions to the philosophical community. She has served as department chair in three different universities, on numerous academic committees (including being a founding chair of the UC committee on the status of women), as president of the Society for Philosophy and Psychology, as president of the North American Kant Society, and on the editorial board of Journal of Philosophy. Her philosophical integrity, her fiery lectures, and her incisive comments on student papers make her an inspiring teacher and mentor.\n\n\n\n \n"}

{"id": "32554644", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32554644", "title": "Philosophy in Malta", "text": "Philosophy in Malta\n\nPhilosophy in Malta refers to the philosophy of Maltese nationals or those of Maltese descent, whether living in Malta or abroad, whether writing in their native Maltese language or in a foreign language. Though Malta is not more than a tiny European island in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea, for the last six centuries its very small population happened to come in close contact with some of Europe’s main political, academic and intellectual movements. Philosophy was among the interests fostered by its academics and intellectuals. \n\nFor the greater part of its history, in Malta philosophy was simply studied as part of a basic institutional programme which mainly prepared candidates to become priests, lawyers or physicians. It was only during the latter part of the 20th century that philosophy began to acquire an ever-growing importance of its own. Nevertheless, throughout the years a few Maltese academics and intellectuals have stood out for their philosophical prowess and acumen. Despite their limitations, they gave their modest share for the understanding of philosophy and some of the areas it covers.\n\nThough, from the mid-16th century onwards, in Malta philosophy was taught at various institutions of higher education, from the latter part of the 18th century onwards the main academic body which promoted philosophical activity and research was the University of Malta. Today, mainly due to easier access to data sources and to enhanced communication networks, such philosophical inquiries and pursuits are more extensive in prevalence as in content.\n\nBefore the advent of the Knights Hospitallers to Malta in the first half of the 16th century, the Maltese Islands were a forlorn place with little, if any, political importance. The few intellectuals who lived here grew within or around the Catholic religious orders that were present. Their cultural ties were mostly with nearby Sicily. Philosophy was mainly studied as a stepping stone to theology. Back then, Sicily was a celebrated and thriving academic, intellectual and cultural centre, and all local professionals studied there. At the time, the Renaissance was in full bloom. Though the Counter-Reformation played an important part in every academic and intellectual institution, literature issued by the major Reformation educationalists, including Martin Luther, were available and read extensively.\n\nThe Knights Hospitallers made Malta their island-home in 1530 and remained sovereign rulers of the islands until they were expelled by Napoleon in 1798. As a rule, they cared about education and cultivation as much as their military campaigns and their economic welfare. Though they encouraged higher learning by giving protection to the various colleges and universities that were established (especially by Catholic religious orders), they also kept a very strict surveillance on all aspects of scholarship. They certainly did not like being picked on by the Inquisition, which could make them look bad with the Pope in Rome.\nThough philosophy continued to be mainly viewed as the \"hand-maid\" of theology, some intellectuals had an interest in cautiously branching out along some pathways of their own. Though the philosophical contributioins of these masters are fascinating in themselves, prevalent control and restrictions on intellectual activity hardly ever left them room for originality and innovation.\n\nDuring this period intellectual circles were practically all part of the great movement of Scholasticism, almost giving godlike status to Aristotle. Nonetheless, they were divided into two intellectually opposing camps: the larger group which read the great Stagirite through the eyes of Thomas Aquinas, and the others who read him through the eyes of John Duns Scotus. All of these academics and intellectuals produced large numbers of commentaries, either on Aristotle or on their respective mentor. Their creativity was largely expressed strictly within the confines of their particular school of thought, and this severely restricted their novelty.\n\nDuring the 18th-century part of the period of the Knights Hospitallers, science and the scientific method began to make head-way over the trenches of the Scholastics. This line of thought was generally not pursued by ecclesiastics, on whom control was more stern, but by lay professionals, especially doctors. These, however, usually had no sway over studends registered with academic institutions, which were still rigorously controlled by members of religious orders.\n\nTowards the end of the period of the Knights Hospitallers in Malta, ideas which had been explosive through the French Revolution of 1789 began to make way into some intellectual circles susceptible to them. They came to full fruition around 1798, when Napoleon Bonaparte expelled the Knights Hospitallers. However, they were already making the rounds during the decade preceding Napoleon. Of course, these ideas were much influenced by Illuminist philosophies, especially in France.\n\nDuring this period, the higher schools resumed their business very much as was done during the rule of the Knights Hospitallers. Again Scholasticism came to the fore and flourished. However, this time around, it was the Thomist version which prevailed almost exclusively, even if circumstances, along two centuries and a half of British rule, changed drastically over the years. As in former years, the larger part of the philosophsers of this period were ecclesiastics, predominantly members of religious orders. Again, due to censor and control, they hardly ever ventured to propose anything philosophically bold or imaginative. An outstanding exception to all of these was Manuel Dimech, who lived and worked during the first decade of the 20th century. He not only did not adhere to any form of Scholasticism but, furthermore, was a surprisingly innovative and original philosopher and social reformer.\n\nBy the time of Malta's independence Scholasticism had waned and slowly faded away. Very few continued to uncritically adhere to its tenets, and these were restricted to small religious (particularly Catholic) circles.\nMost of the other philosophers became somewhat more adventurous, exploring spheres which were to some extent inaccessible during the British (and much less the Knights Hospitallers’) period. In terms of the development of doing philosophy in Malta, Peter Serracino Inglott stands out as all-important, especially from the late 1960s onwards.\n\nSome other Maltese philosophers worked abroad. Though they retained their limited contact with Malta, they of course had a different frame of mind. Their influence on young Maltese philosophers was negligible.\n\nThe following is the list of professors who held the Chair of Philosophy at the University of Malta, Malta’s highest academic philosophy institution. The dates refer to their period of tenure. The chair of philosophy was established in 1771 by the Grand Master of the Knights Hospitallers, Manuel Pinto da Fonseca, when he transformed the \"Collegium Melitense\" (Maltese College) of the Jesuits into the University of Malta.\n\nDuring the last twenty years or so there has been an effort to aptly recognise and duly honour the modest share of philosophy in Malta. The necessity arose for two main reasons. One, because the Maltese \"themselves\", mostly due to a dearth of required research, did not acknowledge, much less appreciate, any local philosophical tradition; and, secondly, because any activity that was being carried out in the philosophical field—whether it was teaching, writing or simply discussing—was done as if the Maltese themselves had, at most, a present without a past.\n\nArchival work revealed names and manuscripts and personalities, text-books were published (1995; 2001) and courses were read at the University of Malta (1996/97; 2012/13; 2013/14) and at other institutions of higher education. A first public conference on ‘Maltese’ philosophy was also organised (1996). A further step was taken by the establishment of Philosophy Sharing Foundation (2012).\n\nSince the 16th century, philosophy has contributed to the academic and, sometimes, the intellectual and cultural life of Maltese intelligentsia. In most cases it functioned as a tool of the establishment—including the Catholic Church―to conserve and perpetuate orthodox and official doctrines. In other cases it offered alternative and imaginative routes of thinking. Despite its relatively long philosophical tradition, however, Malta has no particular philosophy associated to its name. Though sometimes innovative and creative, in their large majority Maltese philosophers have always worked with imported ideas and, but for very rare cases (like in the case of Manuel Dimech), seldom did break new ground in the philosophical field. Although the philosophy of many of them did not affect social or political life, some interacted lively with current affairs and sometimes even stimulated societal change. Throughout the ages, Maltese philosophers did not adhere to just one philosophical tradition. The larger part pertains to the Aristotelico-Thomistic school. Every now and then, however, other trends appear along the way, especially during the last quarter of the 20th century, such as humanism, empiricism, pragmatism, existentialism, linguistic analysis and some others. But for unique, rather than rare, exceptions, theism has been a constant trait throughout the whole Maltese philosophical tradition.\n\nDuring the last thirty years or so philosophy in Malta took an unprecedented twist. Peter Serracino Inglott gave it an extraordinary new breath of life by widening its horizon, diversifying its interests and firmly propelling it into social and political action. This style then was taken up by others who continued this trend.\n\nThe following list includes some of Malta’s best and most representative philosophers through the ages. Most of the philosophical contributions made by these scholars have lasting significance since they go beyond reflections which are merely descriptive, comparative or contextual. Some of them also appeal for their creativity and style. \n15th century\n\n17th century\n\n18th century\n\n19th century\n\n20th century\n\n\n"}
{"id": "30822761", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30822761", "title": "Pinocchio paradox", "text": "Pinocchio paradox\n\nThe Pinocchio paradox arises when Pinocchio says \"My nose grows now\" and is a version of the liar paradox. The liar paradox is defined in philosophy and logic as the statement \"This sentence is false.\" Any attempts to assign a classical binary truth value to this statement lead to a contradiction, or paradox. This occurs because if the statement \"This sentence is false\" is true, then it is false; this would mean that it is technically true, but also that it is false, and so on without end. Although the Pinocchio paradox belongs to the liar paradox tradition, it is a special case because it has no semantic predicates, as for example \"My sentence is false\" does.\n\nThe Pinocchio paradox has nothing to do with Pinocchio being a known liar. If Pinocchio were to say \"I am getting sick,\" this could be either true or false, but Pinocchio's sentence \"My nose grows now\" can be neither true nor false; hence this and only this sentence creates the Pinocchio (liar) paradox.\n\nPinocchio is a hero of the children's novel \"The Adventures of Pinocchio\" by Italian author Carlo Collodi. Pinocchio, an animated puppet, is punished for each lie that he tells by undergoing further growth of his nose. There are no restrictions on the length of Pinocchio's nose. It grows as he tells lies and at one point grows so long that he can not even get his nose \"through the door of the room\".\n\nThe Pinocchio paradox was proposed in February 2001 by 11-year-old Veronique Eldridge-Smith. Veronique is the daughter of Peter Eldridge-Smith, who specializes in logic and the philosophy of logic. Peter Eldridge-Smith explained the liar paradox to Veronique and Veronique's older brother, and asked the children to come up with their own versions of the famous paradox. In a few minutes Veronique suggested: \"Pinocchio says, 'My nose will be growing'.\" Eldridge-Smith liked the formulation of the paradox suggested by his daughter and wrote an article on the subject. The article was published in the journal \"Analysis\", and the Pinocchio paradox became popularized on the Internet.\n\nThe paradox suggested by Veronique, \"My nose grows now\", or in future tense: \"will be growing\", leaves room for different interpretations. In the novel Pinocchio's nose continues to grow as he lies: \"As he spoke, his nose, long though it was, became at least two inches longer.\" So logicians question if the sentence \"My nose will be growing\" was the only sentence that Pinocchio spoke, did he tell a lie before he said \"My nose will be growing\", or was he going to tell a lie—and how long would it take for his nose to start growing?\n\nThe present tense of the same sentence \"My nose is growing now\" or \"My nose grows\", appears to provide a better opportunity to generate the liar paradox.\n\nThe sentence \"My nose grows\" could be either true or false.\n\nAssume the sentence: \"My nose grows now\" is true:\n\n\nAssume the sentence: \"My nose grows now\" is false:\n\n\nAnd just to make it easier, as Eldridge-Smith states, \"Pinocchio's nose is growing if and only if it is not growing,\" which makes Pinocchio's sentence to be \"a version of the Liar\".\n\nEldridge-Smith argues that because the phrases \"is not true\" and \"is growing\" are not synonyms, the Pinocchio paradox is not a semantic paradox:\n\nEldridge-Smith believes Alfred Tarski's theory, in which he states that liar paradoxes should be diagnosed as arising only in languages that are \"semantically closed\". By this he means a language in which it is possible for one sentence to predicate the truth (or falsehood) of a sentence in the same language should not be applied to the Pinocchio paradox:\n\nIn his next article, \"Pinocchio against the dialetheists\", Eldridge-Smith states: \"If it is a true contradiction that Pinocchio's nose grows and does not grow, then such a world is metaphysically impossible, not merely semantically impossible.\" He then reminds the readers that, when (in Buridan's bridge) Socrates asked if he may cross a bridge, Plato responded that he may cross the bridge only \"if in the first proposition that you would utter you speak the truth. But surely, if you speak falsely I shall throw you into water.\" Socrates replied, \"You are going to throw me into the water.\" Socrates's response is a sophism that puts Plato in a difficult situation. He could not throw Socrates into water, because by doing this Plato would have violated his promise to let Socrates cross the bridge if he speaks the truth. On the other hand, if Plato would have allowed Socrates to cross the bridge, it would have meant that Socrates said an untruth when he replied \"You are going to throw me into the water,\" and he therefore should have been thrown into the water. In other words, Socrates could be allowed to cross the bridge if and only if he could not be.\n\nWilliam F. Vallicella, while admitting that he has not read the articles published in \"Analysis\", says that he does not see a paradox in the future tense of the sentence \"My nose will grow now\", or in the present tense of the sentence \"My nose grows now\".\n\nVallicella argues that the future tense sentence cannot generate the liar paradox because this sentence cannot be ever treated as a falsity. He explains his point with this example: \"Suppose I predict that tomorrow morning, at 6 AM, my blood pressure will be 125/75, but my prediction turns out false: my blood pressure the next morning is 135/85. No one who heard my prediction could claim that I lied when I made it even if I had the intention of deceiving my hearers. For although I made (what turned out to be) a false statement with the intention to deceive, I had no way of knowing exactly what my blood pressure would be the next day.\" The same explanation could be used to explain Pinocchio's sentence. Even if his prediction that his nose will grow turns out to be false, it is impossible to claim that he has lied. Then Vallicella explains why he does not see the liar paradox in Pinocchio's sentence if the present tense is used:\n\nHowever, Vallicella's argument can be criticized in the following way: Unlike Pinocchio, Vallicella's blood pressure does not respond to the veracity of his own statements. However, Pinocchio, operating within the framework of having observed that his nose grows when \"and only when\" he lies, would be making an inductively reasoned statement which he believes to be true based on his past experiences.\n\nBut this critique to Vallicella's argument can also be challenged. Based on Pinocchio's own presumed understanding of the nature of when and why his nose grows, \"my nose grows now\" can only have been 'inductively reasoned' if Pinocchio was referring to a lie that he stated right beforehand. For Pinocchio, \"my nose grows now\" is a statement that merely serves to imply that whatever he said \"right before\" was a lie and that therefore his nose will probably be growing now because of that lie. In this context, the statement \"my nose grows now\" is a prediction or an 'educated' guess, which in its nature cannot be construed as a lie. Thus, whether or not his nose grows now would solely depend on what he said before \"my nose grows now\".\n"}

The Grand Prince, first-born son of King Taejong of the Joseon dynasty and his consort Queen Wongyeong, elder brother of Sejong the Great, and ancestor of Syngman Rhee, Korean independence activist and first President of South Korea.\n\nHe was born as Yi Je (李褆 in Hanja, 이제 in Hangul) in 1394. Originally his father appointed him as the Crown Prince but he eventually executed the Queen Wongyeong's brothers and in the 18th year of his reign replaced prince Yangnyeong with his third son prince Chungnyeong as his successor . Known for his literature and calligraphy skills, the former Crown Prince viewed himself as lacking in the requisite skills for kingship and believed that Sejong was destined to become king. Considering it his duty to make Sejong king, he purposely acted extremely rude in the court, lost his position as a prince, married a peasant and was eventually officially banished from Seoul in June 1418. Grand Prince Hyoryeong, Yangnyeong's second brother, had similar feelings about Sejong being king, and so became a monk in a Buddhist temple. Possibly King Tajong's willingness to execute troublesome family members helped encourage his first two sons to step aside and allow King Taejong's third and favorite son to become King Sejong.\nThis plot ultimately brought Sejong to the throne. Later, Yangnyeong became a wandering traveler and lived in the mountains.\n\nAfter Sejong had taken the throne, the relationship between the brothers was strong, and Sejong often invited Yangnyeong to the palace.\n\nYangnyeong lived as a wanderer and died in 1462, almost living for 68 years.\n\n\n\nToday, his descendants form one of the biggest clans of the House of Yi.

{"id": "27701207", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27701207", "title": "Process ontology", "text": "Process ontology\n\nIn philosophy, a process ontology refers to a universal model of the structure of the world as an ordered wholeness. Such ontologies are fundamental ontologies, in contrast to the so-called applied ontologies. Fundamental ontologies do not claim to be accessible to any empirical proof in itself, but to be a structural design pattern, out of which empirical phenomena can be explained and put together consistently. Throughout Western history, the dominating fundamental ontology is the so-called substance theory. However, fundamental process ontologies are becoming more important in recent times, because the progress in the discovery of the foundations of physics spurred the development of a basic concept able to integrate such boundary notions as \"energy,\" \"object\", and those of the physical dimensions of space and time.\n\nIn computer science, a process ontology is a description of the components and their relationships that make up a process. A formal process ontology is an ontology in the knowledge domain of processes. Often such ontologies take advantage of the benefits of an upper ontology. Planning software can be used to perform plan generation based on the formal description of the process and its constraints. Numerous efforts have been made to define a process/planning ontology.\n\nA process may be defined as a set of transformations of input elements into output elements with specific properties, with the transformations characterized by parameters and constraints, such as in manufacturing or biology. A process may also be defined as the workflows and sequence of events inherent in processes such as manufacturing, engineering and business processes.\n\nThe Process Specification Language (PSL) is a process ontology developed for the formal description and modeling of basic manufacturing, engineering and business processes. This ontology provides a vocabulary of classes and relations for concepts at the ground level of event-instances, object-instances, and timepoints. PSL’s top level is built around the following:\n\nIn a process/planning ontology developed for the ontology Cyc, classes and relations above the ground level of PSL allow processes to be described purely at the type-level. The ground level of PSL uses the primitives of event-instance, object-instance, and timepoint description. The types above the ground level of PSL have also been expressed in PSL, showing that the type-level and the ground level are relatively independent. The type-levels for the Cyc process ontology above this ground level use the following concepts:\n\nThe project SUPER (Semantics Utilised for Process management within and between EnteRprises) has a goal of the definition of ontologies for Semantic Business Process Management (SBPM), but these ontologies can be reused in diverse environments. Part of this project is to define an Upper Process Ontology (UPO) that ties together all other SUPER ontologies. The results of the project SUPER include the UPO and a set of ontologies for processes and organizations. Most of the ontologies are written in WSML, and some are also written in OCML.\n\nA candidate model for the UPO was DDPO (DOLCE+DnS Plan Ontology), a planning ontology which specifies plans and distinguishes between abstract and executable plans. DOLCE (Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering) aims at capturing the ontological categories underlying natural language and human commonsense. DnS (Descriptions and Situations), is a constructivist ontology that allows for context-sensitive redescriptions of the types and relations postulated by other given ontologies (or ground vocabularies). Together in DDPO, DOLCE and DnS are used to build a Plan Ontology that includes physical and non-physical objects (social entities, mental objects and states, conceptualizations, information objects, constraints), events, states, regions, qualities, and constructivist situations. The main target of DDPO is tasks, namely the types of actions, their sequencing, and the controls performed on them.\n\nThe ontology oXPDL is a process interchange ontology based on the standardised XML Process Definition Language (XPDL). The purpose of oXPDL is to model the semantics of XPDL process models in standardized Web ontology languages such as OWL and WSML, while incorporating features of existing standard ontologies such as PSL, RosettaNet, and SUMO.\n\nThe General Formal Ontology (GFO) is an ontology integrating processes and objects. GFO includes elaborations of categories like objects, processes, time and space, properties, relations, roles, functions, facts, and situations. GFO allows for different axiomatizations of its categories, such as the existence of atomic time-intervals vs. dense time. Two of the specialties of GFO are its account of persistence and its time model. Regarding persistence, the distinction between endurants (objects) and perdurants (processes) is made explicit within GFO by the introduction of a special category, a persistant. A persistant is a special category with the intention that its instances \"remain identical\" over time. With respect to time, time intervals are taken as primitive in GFO, and time-points (called \"time boundaries\") are derived. Moreover, time-points may coincide, which is convenient for modelling instantaneous changes.\n\nThe multi metamodel process ontology (m3po) combines workflows and choreography descriptions so that it can be used as a process interchange ontology. For internal business processes, Workflow Management Systems are used for process modelling and allow describing and executing business processes. For external business processes, choreography descriptions are used to describe how business partners can cooperate. A choreography can be considered to be a view of an internal business process with the internal logic not visible, similar to public views on private workflows. The m3po ontology unifies both internal and external business processes, combining reference models and languages from the workflow and choreography domains. The m3po ontology is written in WSML. The related ontology m3pl, written in PSL using the extension FLOWS (First Order Logic for Web Services), enables the extraction of choreography interfaces from workflow models.\n\nThe m3po ontology combines features of the following reference models and languages:\n\nThe m3po ontology is organized using five key aspects of workflow specifications and workflow management. Because different workflow models put a different emphasis on the five aspects, the most elaborate reference model for each aspect was used and combined into m3po.\n\n\n"}

Braithwaite\n\nRichard Bevan Braithwaite (15 January 1900 – 21 April 1990), usually cited as R. B. Braithwaite, was an English philosopher who specialized in the philosophy of science, ethics, and the philosophy of religion. He was a lecturer in moral science at the University of Cambridge from 1934 to 1953, then Knightbridge Professor of Moral Philosophy there from 1953 to 1967. He was president of the Aristotelian Society from 1946 to 1947, and was elected a Fellow of the British Academy in 1957.\n\nBraithwaite was born in Banbury, Oxfordshire, son of the historian of early Quaker history, William Charles Braithwaite. He was educated at Sidcot School, Somerset (1911–14), and Bootham School, York, 1914–18. As a conscientious objector in the First World War, he served in the Friends' Ambulance Unit.\n\nHe entered King's College, Cambridge, in 1919 to study physics and mathematics, gaining a BA in 1923 and MA in 1926. He was a Fellow of King's College, Cambridge from 1924 to 1990. He was appointed Cambridge University Lecturer in Moral Sciences in 1928.\n\nHe was married (secondly) to the computational linguist and philosopher Margaret Masterman, with whom he founded the Epiphany Philosophers a group of (largely) Anglicans and Quakers seeking a new view of the relationship between philosophy and science (see the Pardshaw Dialogues, below).\n\nAlthough he was positivistically inclined, Braithwaite was a Christian, having been brought up a Quaker and becoming an Anglican later. According to theologian Alister E. McGrath, Braithwaite's 1955 Eddington Memorial Lecture \"An Empiricist's View of the Nature of Religious Belief\" is to date the most widely cited publication (e.g. by Anglican priest Don Cupitt) from a genre of 1970s–1980s theological works arguing that \"God\" and \"religion\" are human constructs—having no independent reality of their own—and that human dignity and freedom may best be advanced by systematic deconstruction of these two ideas, although Braithwaite himself had little sympathy for vague claims like these.\n\nHis major work was his book \"Scientific Explanation\" (1953) but, like his Eddington Lecture (above) it was his inaugural lecture (\"Theory of Games as a Tool for the Moral Philosopher\") that was his more original contribution: although a logician and philosopher of science, he had been elected to a chair of moral philosophy (ethics) about which he considered he knew little. His inaugural lecture attempted to bring what he did know about (the theory of games) into some relation with ethical reasoning and, in doing that, he effectively started a whole new field of study, namely, how game-theoretic considerations are related to ethical ones.\n\nIt was Braithwaite's poker that Ludwig Wittgenstein reportedly brandished at Karl Popper during their confrontation at a Moral Sciences Club meeting in Braithwaite's rooms in King's. The implement subsequently disappeared.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "324305", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=324305", "title": "Right to privacy", "text": "Right to privacy\n\nThe right to privacy is an element of various legal traditions to restrain governmental and private actions that threaten the privacy of individuals. Over 150 national constitutions mention the right to privacy.\n\nSince the global surveillance disclosures of 2013, initiated by ex-NSA employee Edward Snowden, the inalienable human right to privacy has been a subject of international debate. In combating worldwide terrorism, government agencies, such as the NSA, CIA, R&AW and GCHQ, have engaged in mass, global surveillance.\n\nThere is now a question as whether the right to privacy act can co-exist with the current capabilities of intelligence agencies to access and analyse virtually in every detail of an individual's life. A major question is that whether or not the right to privacy needs to be forfeited as part of the social contract to bolster defense against supposed terrorist threats.\n\nPrivate sector actors could also threaten the right to privacy. Increasingly, questions have arisen about the use of personal data for targeted advertising, sharing data with external parties and reusing personal data within big data by large technology giants, such as Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, and Yahoo. These concerns have been strengthened by scandals, revealing that the psychographic company Cambridge Analytica was using personal data, illegitimately obtained through Facebook, to manipulate and influence large groups of people, including during the 2016 US Presidential elections.\n\nState of consideration of constitutional laws and acts formed by sectors and sections\n\nPrivacy uses the theory of natural rights, and generally responds to new information and communication technologies. In the United States, an article in the December 15, 1890 issue of the \"Harvard Law Review\", written by attorney Samuel D. Warren and future U.S. Supreme Court Justice, Louis Brandeis, entitled \"The Right to Privacy\", is often cited as the first explicit declaration of a U.S. right to privacy. Warren and Brandeis wrote that privacy is the \"right to be let alone\", and focused on protecting individuals. This approach was a response to recent technological developments of the time, such as photography, and sensationalist journalism, also known as \"yellow journalism\".\n\nPrivacy rights are inherently intertwined with information technology. In his widely cited dissenting opinion in \"Olmstead v. United States\" (1928), Brandeis relied on thoughts he developed in his 1890 article \"The Right to Privacy\". But in his dissent, he now changed the focus whereby he urged making personal privacy matters more relevant to constitutional law, going so far as saying \"the government [was] identified...as a potential privacy invader.\" He writes, \"Discovery and invention have made it possible for the Government, by means far more effective than stretching upon the rack, to obtain disclosure in court of what is whispered in the closet.\" At that time, telephones were often community assets, with shared party lines and the potentially nosey human operators. By the time of Katz, in 1967, telephones had become personal devices with lines not shared across homes and switching was electro-mechanical. In the 1970s, new computing and recording technologies began to raise concerns about privacy, resulting in the Fair Information Practice Principles.\n\nIn recent years there has been only few attempts to clearly and precisely define the \"right to privacy\". In 2005, students of the Haifa Center for Law & Technology asserted that in fact the right to privacy \"should not be defined as a separate legal right\" at all. By their reasoning, existing laws relating to privacy in general should be sufficient. Other experts, such as William Prosser, have attempted, but failed, to find a \"common ground\" between the leading kinds of privacy cases in the court system, at least to formulate a definition. One law school treatise from Israel, however, on the subject of \"privacy in the digital environment,\" suggests that the \"right to privacy should be seen as an independent right that deserves legal protection in itself.\" It has therefore proposed a working definition for a \"right to privacy\":\n\nThe right to privacy is our right to keep a domain around us, which includes all those things that are part of us, such as our body, home, property, thoughts, feelings, secrets and identity. The right to privacy gives us the ability to choose which parts in this domain can be accessed by others, and to control the extent, manner and timing of the use of those parts we choose to disclose.\n\nAlan Westin believes that new technologies alter the balance between privacy and disclosure, and that privacy rights may limit government surveillance to protect democratic processes. Westin defines privacy as \"the claim of individuals, groups, or institutions to determine for themselves when, how, and to what extent information about them is communicated to others\". Westin describes four states of privacy: solitude, intimacy, anonymity, reserve. These states must balance participation against norms:\n\nEach individual is continually engaged in a personal adjustment process in which he balances the desire for privacy with the desire for disclosure and communication of himself to others, in light of the environmental conditions and social norms set by the society in which he lives.\n\nUnder liberal democratic systems, privacy creates a space separate from political life, and allows personal autonomy, while ensuring democratic freedoms of association and expression.\n\nDavid Flaherty believes networked computer databases pose threats to privacy. He develops 'data protection' as an aspect of privacy, which involves \"the collection, use, and dissemination of personal information\". This concept forms the foundation for fair information practices used by governments globally. Flaherty forwards an idea of privacy as information control, \"[i]ndividuals want to be left alone and to exercise some control over how information about them is used\".\n\nMarc Rotenberg has described the modern right to privacy as Fair Information Practices: \"the rights and responsibilities associated with the collection and use of personal information.\" Rotenberg emphasizes that the allocation of rights are to the data subject and the responsibilities are assigned to the data collectors because of the transfer of the data and the asymmetry of information concerning data practices.\n\nRichard Posner and Lawrence Lessig focus on the economic aspects of personal information control. Posner criticizes privacy for concealing information, which reduces market efficiency. For Posner, employment is selling oneself in the labour market, which he believes is like selling a product. Any 'defect' in the 'product' that is not reported is fraud. For Lessig, privacy breaches online can be regulated through code and law. Lessig claims \"the protection of privacy would be stronger if people conceived of the right as a property right\", and that \"individuals should be able to control information about themselves\". Economic approaches to privacy make communal conceptions of privacy difficult to maintain.\n\nThere have been attempts to reframe privacy as a fundamental human right, whose social value is an essential component in the functioning of democratic societies. Amitai Etzioni suggests a communitarian approach to privacy. This requires a shared moral culture for establishing social order. Etzioni believes that \"[p]rivacy is merely one good among many others\", and that technological effects depend on community accountability and oversight. He claims that privacy laws only increase government surveillance.\n\nPriscilla Regan believes that individual concepts of privacy have failed philosophically and in policy. She supports a social value of privacy with three dimensions: shared perceptions, public values, and collective components. Shared ideas about privacy allows freedom of conscience and diversity in thought. Public values guarantee democratic participation, including freedoms of speech and association, and limits government power. Collective elements describe privacy as collective good that cannot be divided. Regan's goal is to strengthen privacy claims in policy making: \"if we did recognize the collective or public-good value of privacy, as well as the common and public value of privacy, those advocating privacy protections would have a stronger basis upon which to argue for its protection\".\n\nLeslie Regan Shade argues that the human right to privacy is necessary for meaningful democratic participation, and ensures human dignity and autonomy. Privacy depends on norms for how information is distributed, and if this is appropriate. Violations of privacy depend on context. The human right to privacy has precedent in the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights. Shade believes that privacy must be approached from a people-centered perspective, and not through the marketplace.\n\nA right to privacy is explicitly stated under Article 12 of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights:\n\nNo one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honor and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.\n\nAlthough the Constitution does not explicitly include the right to privacy, the Supreme Court has found that the Constitution implicitly grants a right to privacy against governmental intrusion from the First Amendment, Third Amendment, Fourth Amendment, and the Fifth Amendment. This right to privacy has been the justification for decisions involving a wide range of civil liberties cases, including \"Pierce v. Society of Sisters\", which invalidated a successful 1922 Oregon initiative requiring compulsory public education, \"Griswold v. Connecticut\", where a right to privacy was first established explicitly, \"Roe v. Wade\", which struck down a Texas abortion law and thus restricted state powers to enforce laws against abortion, and \"Lawrence v. Texas\", which struck down a Texas sodomy law and thus eliminated state powers to enforce laws against sodomy.\n\nThe 1890 Warren and Brandeis article \"The Right To Privacy\" is often cited as the first implicit declaration of a U.S. right to privacy. This right is frequently debated. Strict constructionists argue that such right exists (or at least that the Supreme Court has more jurisdiction to protect such a right), while some civil libertarians argue that the right invalidates many types of currently allowed acts not to be surveillance (wiretaps, public cameras film industry, etc.).\n\nMost states of the United States also grant a right to privacy and recognize four torts based on that right:\n\nThe four privacy torts above were introduced by William Prosser in his \"California Law Review\" article titled \"Privacy\" in 1960. Some argue that these torts, along with the \"Right to Privacy\" article by Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis form the basis for modern U.S. privacy legislation.\n\nAlso, in some American jurisdictions the use of a person's name as a keyword under Google's AdWords for advertising or trade purposes without the person's consent has raised certain personal privacy concerns.\n\nRight to privacy and social media content laws have been considered and enacted in several states, such as California’s “online erasure” law protecting minors from leaving a digital trail. However, the United States is still far behind that of European Union countries in protecting privacy online. For example, the “right to be forgotten” ruling by the EU Court of Justice protects both adults and minors.\n\nA nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court headed by Chief Justice JS Khehar, ruled on August 24, 2017 that the Right to Privacy is a fundamental right for Indian citizens under the Constitution of India (mostly under Article 21 and additionally under Part III rights). Thus no legislation passed by the government can unduly violate it. Specifically, the court adopted the three-pronged test required for encroachment of any Article 21 right – legality-i.e. through an existing law; necessity, in terms of a legitimate state objective and proportionality, that ensures a rational nexus between the object of the invasion and the means adopted to achieve that object. This clarification was crucial to prevent the dilution of the right in the future on the whims and fancies of the government in power. This ruling by the Supreme Court paved the way for decriminalisation of homosexuality in India on 6 September 2018, thus legalising same-sex sexual intercourse between two consenting adults in private. India is the world’s biggest democracy and with this ruling, it has joined United States, Canada, South Africa, the European Union and the UK in recognizing this fundamental right.\n\nThe new data sharing policy of Whatsapp with Facebook after Facebook acquired Whatsapp in 2014 has been challenged in the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court must decide if the right to privacy can be enforced against private entities.\n\nIt is often claimed, particularly by those in the eye of the media, that their right to privacy is violated when information about their private lives is reported in the press. The point of view of the press, however, is that the general public have a right to know personal information about those with status as a public figure. This distinction is encoded in most legal traditions as an element of freedom of speech.\n\nGovernmental organizations such as the NSA, CIA, and GCHQ amongst others conduct mass surveillance throughout the world. Programs such as PRISM, MYSTIC, and other operations conducted by NATO-member states are capable of collecting a vast quantity of metadata, internet history, and even actual recordings of phone calls from various countries. The existence of programs is justified by their conductors in terms of supposed benefits for defense and law enforcement, however this is also in conflict with the right to privacy established under various treaties, constitutions, and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The argument in favor of privacy has therefore come under a larger opposition to intelligence operations carried out for political purposes, and has become a contentious issue since it undermines the perceived need of nations to spy on the general population in order to maintain their power structures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Various religions and cultures take differing views of self-denial, some considering it a positive trait and others considering it a negative one. According to some Protestants, self-denial is considered a superhuman virtue only obtainable through Jesus. Some critics of self-denial suggest that self-denial can lead to self-hatred.\n\nThere is evidence brief periods of fasting, a denial of food, can be beneficial to health in certain situations. Self-denial is sometimes related to inhibitory control and emotional self-regulation, the positives of which are dealt with in those articles. As people grow accustomed to material goods they often experience hedonic adaptation, whereby they get used to the finer things and are less inclined to savor daily pleasures. Scarcity can lead people to focus on enjoying an experience more deeply, which increases happiness.\n\nOthers argue self-denial involves avoidance and holding back of happiness and pleasurable experiences from oneself that is only damaging to other people. Some argue it is a form of micro-suicide because it is threatening to an individual's physical health, emotional well-being, or personal goals.\n\nSelf-denial can constitute an important element of religious practice in various belief systems. An exemplification is the self-denial advocated by several Christian confessions where it is believed to be a means of reaching happiness and a deeper religious understanding, sometimes described as 'becoming a true follower of Christ'. The foundation of self-denial in the Christian context is based the recognition of a higher God-given will, which the Christian practicer choose to adhere to, and prioritize over his or her own will or desires. This can in daily life be expressed by renunciation of certain physically pleasureable, yet from a religious stand-point inappropriate activities, sometimes referred to as 'desires of the flesh', which e.g. could entail certain sexual practices and over-indulgant eating or drinking. In the Christian faith Jesus is often mentioned as a positive example of self-denial, both in relation to the deeds performed during his life, as well as the sacrifice attributed to his death.\n\nSelf-denial in women is linked to cultural definitions of femininity which women have internalized to such an extent that self-abnegation had become basic to women's experience. Judith Plaskow observed this and argued that it was more linked to women than men because they were to follow this Christian virtue because of their detriment. Women are seen in a domestic perspective and self-denial puts all things women were once exposed to the side so they can be committed to their marriage and family. The way women are portrayed has not changed much throughout the years because the patriarchal perspective continues to be present. Through self-denial women have to sacrifice their interests and goals to satisfy not only family, but many times social norms. They are not allowed to be independent but more so are trapped to be the individual they are expected to be. However, in men, this is different.\n\nMasculinity is linked to self-denial when put in a male perspective. Men's self-denial is both a source of men's existential alienation and part of the infrastructure of men's power. When men go through self-denial it is interpreted as self-improvement as put by the book \"Manliness\" in which they emphasize self-denial as a comparison to the image of the goal of Superman in \"What does not kill me makes me stronger\".\n\nHowever, the psychological differences between men and women are often disputed among researchers.\n\n"}

While the meaning of the surname \"Schining\" is uncertain, the suffix \"ain Ringeck\" may indicate that he came from the Rhineland region of south-western Germany. He is named in the text of his treatise as \"Schirmaister\" to one Duke Albrecht, Count Palatine of Rhine and Duke of Bavaria. Other than this, the only thing that can be determined about his life is that his renown as a master was sufficient for Paulus Kal to include him on his memorial to the deceased masters of the Society of Liechtenauer in 1470. Ringeck seems to have authored one of the few complete glosses of the epitome of the grand master Johannes Liechtenauer, making him one of the most important German fencing masters of the 15th century.\n\nThe identity of Ringeck's patron remains unclear, as four men named Albrecht held the title during the fifteenth century. If it is Albrecht I, who reigned from 1353 to 1404, this would signify that Ringeck was likely a direct associate or student of Liechtenauer. However, it may just as easily have been Albrecht III, who carried the title from 1438 to 1460, making Ringeck a second- or third-generation master carrying on the tradition. Albrecht IV claimed the title in 1460 and thus also could have been Ringeck's patron; this seems less likely in light of Ringeck's apparent death within that same decade, meaning the master would have had to have penned his treatise in the final few years of his life. In its favor, however, is the fact that Albrecht IV reigned until 1508 and both the Dresden and Glasgow versions of the text were likely created during his time.\n\nRingeck is often erroneously credited as the author of the MS Dresden C487. While Ringeck seems to be the author of three of the core texts, glosses of Liechtenauer's verses on unarmored longsword fencing, armored fencing, and mounted fencing, the manuscript is an anthology of several treatises by different masters and is currently thought to have been composed between 1504 and 1519 (well after the master's lifetime). Likewise, the MS E.1939.65.341, though often described as merely an illustrated version of the Dresden manuscript, is a separate anthology with its own collection of works by various authors and is internally dated to 1508.\n\nWhile it was not copied nearly as often as the more famous Anonymous gloss (often misattributed to Peter von Danzig), Ringeck's gloss nevertheless seems to have had a lasting influence. Not only was it reproduced by Joachim Meyer in 1570 as part of his final manuscript, but in 1539 Hans Medel von Salzburg took it upon himself to create a revised version of Ringeck's Bloßfechten gloss, integrating his own commentary in many places.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "408328", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=408328", "title": "Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri", "text": "Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri\n\nSri Yukteswar Giri (also written Sriyuktesvara, Sri Yukteshwar) (Devanagari: , ) (10 May 1855 – 9 March 1936) is the monastic name of Priya Nath Karar (), the guru of Satyananda Giri and Paramahansa Yogananda. Sri Yukteswar was a Kriya yogi, a Jyotisha (Vedic astrologer), a scholar of the Bhagavad Gita and the Upanishads, an educator and an astronomer. He was a disciple of Lahiri Mahasaya of Varanasi and a member of the \"Giri\" branch of the swami order. Yogananda considered Sri Yukteswar as \"Jnanavatar\", or \"Incarnation of Wisdom\".\n\nSri Yukteswar was born as Priya Nath Karar in Serampore, India to Kshetranath Karar and Kadambini. Priya Nath lost his father at a young age, and took on much of the responsibility for managing his family's land holdings. A bright student, he passed the entrance exams and enrolled in Srirampur Christian Missionary College, where he developed an interest in the Bible. This interest would later express itself in his book, \"The Holy Science\", which discusses the unity behind the scientific principles underlying Yoga and the Bible. He also attended Calcutta Medical College (then affiliated with the University of Calcutta) for almost two years.\n\nAfter leaving college, Priya Nath married and had a daughter. His wife died a few years after their marriage, and he eventually was formally initiated into the monastic Swami order as \"Sri Yuktesvar Giri\" (note: thus 'Sri' is not a separate honorific, but part of his given name). \"...many follow the usual procedure (for writing or saying someone's name informally) and drop the \"Sri\" and say only \"Yukteswar\", but this is not correct. If one wants to put a \"Sri\" at the beginning as in the prevalent fashion, then his name would look as: \"Sri Sriyukteswar Giri\".\n\nIn 1884, Priya Nath met Lahiri Mahasaya, who became his Guru and initiated him into the path of Kriya Yoga. Sri Yukteswar spent a great deal of time in the next several years in the company of his guru, often visiting Lahiri Mahasaya in Benares. In 1894, while attending the Kumbha Mela in Allahabad, he met the Guru of Lahiri Mahasaya, Mahavatar Babaji, who asked Sri Yukteswar to write a book comparing Hindu scriptures and the Christian bible. Mahavatar Babaji also bestowed on Sri Yukteswar the title of 'Swami' at that meeting. Sri Yukteswar completed the requested book in 1894, naming it \"Kaivalya Darsanam\", or \"The Holy Science\".\n\nSri Yukteswar converted his large two-story family home in Serampore into an ashram, named \"Priyadham\", where he resided with students and disciples. In 1903, he also established an ashram in the seaside town of Puri, naming it \"Karar Ashram\". From these two ashrams, Sri Yukteswar taught students, and began an organisation named \"Sadhu Sabha\".\n\nAn interest in education resulted in Sri Yukteswar developing a syllabus for schools, on the subjects of physics, physiology, geography, astronomy, and astrology He also wrote a book for Bengalis on learning basic English and Hindi called \"First Book\", and wrote a basic book on astrology. Later, he became interested in the education of women, which was uncommon in Bengal at that time.\n\nYukteswar was especially skilled in Jyotiṣa (Indian astrology), and prescribed various astrological gemstones and bangles to his students. He also studied astronomy and science, as evidenced in the formulation of his \"Yuga theory\" in \"The Holy Science\".\n\nHe had only a few long-term disciples, but in 1910, the young Mukunda Lal Ghosh would become Sri Yukteswar's most well known disciple, eventually spreading the teachings of Kriya Yoga throughout the world as Paramahansa Yogananda with his church of all religions – Self-Realization Fellowship/Yogoda Satsanga Society of India. Yogananda attributed Sri Yukteswar's small number of disciples to his strict training methods, which Yogananda said \"cannot be described as other than drastic\".\n\nRegarding the role of the Guru, Sri Yukteswar said:\nLook, there is no point in blindly believing that after I touch you, you will be saved, or that a chariot from heaven will be waiting for you. Because of the guru's attainment, the sanctifying touch becomes a helper in the blossoming of Knowledge, and being respectful towards having acquired this blessing, you must yourself become a sage, and proceed on the path to elevate your Soul by applying the techniques of sadhana given by the guru.\n\nAuthor W.Y. Evans-Wentz described his impression of Sri Yukteswar in the preface to Yogananda's \"\":\nSri Yukteswar was of gentle mien and voice, of pleasing presence, and worthy of the veneration, which his followers spontaneously accorded to him. Every person who knew him, whether of his own community or not, held him in the highest esteem. I vividly recall his tall, straight, ascetic figure, garbed in the saffron-colored garb of one who has renounced worldly quests, as he stood at the entrance of the hermitage to give me welcome. His hair was long and somewhat curly, and his face bearded. His body was muscularly firm, but slender and well-formed, and his step energetic.\n\nYukteswar attained mahasamadhi at Karar Ashram, Puri, India on 9 March 1936.\n\nSri Yukteswar wrote \"The Holy Science\" in 1894. In the introduction, he wrote:\nThe purpose of this book is to show as clearly as possible that there is an essential unity in all religions; that there is no difference in the truths inculcated by the various faiths; that there is but one method by which the world, both external and internal, has evolved; and that there is but one Goal admitted by all scriptures.\n\nThe work introduced many ideas that were revolutionary for the time – for instance Sri Yukteswar broke from Hindu tradition in stating that the earth is not in the age of Kali Yuga, but has advanced to Dwapara Yuga. His proof was based on a new perspective of the precession of the equinoxes. He also introduced the idea that the sun takes a 'star for its dual', and revolves around it in a period of 24,000 years, which accounts for the precession of the equinox. Research into this theory is being conducted by the Binary Research Institute, which produced a documentary on the topic titled \"The Great Year\", narrated by James Earl Jones. There is an Apple iPhone Application for calculating Sri Yukteswar's calculations, just as there are calculators for currencies, lengths, areas and volumes.\n\nThe theory of the Sun's binary companion expounded by Sri Yukteswar in \"The Holy Science\" has attracted the attention of David Frawley, who has written about it in several of his books. According to Frawley, the theory offers a better estimate of the age of Rama and Krishna and other important historical Indian figures than other dating methods, which estimate some of these figures to have lived millions of years ago – belying accepted human history.\n\n\nSri Yukteswar's face can be seen on the cover of the Beatles' album \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" (1967). He appears on the upper left of the crowd behind the Beatles.\n"}

{"id": "1585790", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1585790", "title": "Youth empowerment", "text": "Youth empowerment\n\nYouth empowerment is a process where children and young people are encouraged to take charge of their lives. They do this by addressing their situation and then take action in order to improve their access to resources and transform their consciousness through their beliefs, values, and attitudes. Youth empowerment aims to improve quality of life. Youth empowerment is achieved through participation in youth empowerment programs. However scholars argue that children’s rights implementation should go beyond learning about formal rights and procedures to give birth to a concrete experience of rights. There are numerous models that youth empowerment programs use that help youth achieve empowerment. A variety of youth empowerment initiatives are underway around the world. These programs can be through non-profit organizations, government organizations, schools or private organizations.\n\nYouth empowerment is different than youth development because development is centered on developing individuals, while empowerment is focused on creating greater community change relies on the development of individual capacity.\n\nEmpowerment movements, including youth empowerment, originate, gain momentum, become viable, and become institutionalized. Youth empowerment is often addressed as a gateway to intergenerational equity, civic engagement and democracy building. Activities may focus on youth-led media, youth rights, youth councils, youth activism, youth involvement in community decision-making, and other methods.\n\nEmpowerment theory focuses on processes that enable participation; enhance control through shared decision making; and create opportunities to learn, practice, and increase skills. Empowerment theory suggests that engaging youth in pro-social, meaningful, and community-enhancing activities that the youth themselves define and control, helps youth gain vital skills, responsibilities, and confidence necessary to become productive and healthy adults.\n\nYouth empowerment examines six interdependent dimensions: psychological, community, organizational, economic, social and cultural. Psychological empowerment enhances individual's consciousness, belief in self-efficacy, awareness and knowledge of problems and solutions and of how individuals can address problems that harm their quality of life. This dimension aims to create self-confidence and give youth the skills to acquire knowledge. Community empowerment focuses on enhancing the community through leadership development, improving communication, and creating a network of support to mobilize the community to address concerns. Organizational empowerment aims to create a base of resources for a community, including voluntary organizations, unions and associations that aim to protect, promote and advocate for the powerless. Economic empowerment teaches entrepreneurial skills, how to take ownership of their assets and how to have income security. Social empowerment teaches youth about social inclusion and literacy as well as helping kids find the resources to be proactive in their communities. Cultural empowerment aims to recreate cultural practices and redefine cultural rules and norms for youth. Through these dimensions of empowerment, programs can work on empowering youth in one or more aspects of their lives.\n\nYouth empowerment programs are aimed at creating healthier and higher qualities of life for underprivileged or at-risk youth. The five competencies of a healthy youth are: (1) positive sense of self, (2) self- control, (3) decision-making skills, (4) a moral system of belief, and (5) pro-social connectedness. Developmental interventions and programs have to be anchored on these competencies that define positive outcomes of healthy youth.\n\nOver the last two decades, quality of life (QOL) has emerged as an important unit of measurement to evaluate the success of empowerment programs. It is used as a goal of programs and as well as an indicator of effectiveness. However, there is no standard definition of QOL. A person's QOL is dependent upon subjective evaluation of the individual aspects of that individual's life.\n\nYouth empowerment programs thrive in positive developmental settings. Positive developmental settings promote youth competence, confidence and connections. Two features of the positive developmental youth settings are supportive relationships and support for efficacy and mattering. Supportive relationships are those that are between youth and non-familial adults that foster trust and respect. Support for efficacy and mattering specifically focuses on youth being active, instrumental agents of change in their communities, collective decision-making and adults listen to and respect their voice.\n\nThere are various types of empowerment programs across the globe that empower youth through many different tactics and programs. Programs can operate in a variety of settings. The majority of programs operate in more than one setting, which may be a key factor in their success. The beneficial outcomes to youth empowerment programs are improved social skills, improved behavior, increased academic achievement, increased self-esteem and increased self-efficacy.\n\nThere are programs are aimed at just empowering women and young girls. Regardless of specific goals or methods, empowering effects include improving women’s wellbeing, self-esteem, and self-efficacy, and enhancing social status by teaching technical and organizational skills.\n\nOther youth empowerment programs are focused on poverty alleviation. Living standards are for those living in poverty are declining causing forms of deprivation as it relates to food, resources and education. Programs aimed at empowering poor youth, work toward livelihood protection or livelihood promotion.\n\nThere are also empowerment movements that use the social action model, aiming for disadvantaged people to become empowered, organized, and educated so that they may create change. These programs advocate for constructive confrontations to enhance the social power of people who are considered disadvantaged. Another model is the 5C's model that focuses on emphasizing competence, confidence, connection, character and caring. A sixth C of contribution to society was later added. This model focuses primarily on engagement as a key marker of positive youth development, emphasizing the need to foster initiative. Youth-adult partnerships are another type of empowerment method used around the world. This method has been defined as a developmental process and a community practice. The partnership involves people of different ages working together on community issues over a period of time. The method emphasizes reciprocity among adults and youth with a focus on shared decision making and reflective learning. The concept of shared control is key for empowering youth.\n\nYouth empowerment has also been used as a framework to prevent and reduce youth violence. Research shows that these youth empowerment programs can improve conflict avoidance and resolution skills, increase group leadership skills, and civic efficacy and improve ethnic identity and reduce racial conflict.\n\nAround the globe there are various empowerment programs focused on a wide variety of things and this is not a comprehensive list. Unsuccessful youth empowerment programs have not been carefully documented or published in case studies.\n\nIn India, Youth Empowerment Foundation, a not for profit organization is focused at uplifting the underprivileged young generation of the society right from providing them with basic education to create a strong foundation for their careers, to developing personality skills, because the youth is the future of the country.\nIn Namibia, one popular empowerment program is Pots of Hope. Pots of Hope's main goal is to reduce the vulnerability youth to HIV and Aids through education, information and awareness, as well as income security projects. Pots of Hope works by educating, and providing counseling to those in rural settings who do not have access to those resources. This program focuses on organizational empowerment within the community.\n\nWithin the United States there are countless empowerment programs for youth. Urban 4-H is a culturally responsive, community-based practice that authentically engages families, youth and the community in the development of youth. Urban 4-H is an example of community empowerment that focuses on the economic and social dimensions of empowerment. The program helps youth build skills to enable them to overcome economic and social barriers while recognizing the importance of self-directed learning for youth. Urban 4-H focuses on empowering youth to think critically, communicate across cultural boundaries and lead others.\n\nIn India, youth empowerment has been taken up by other organizations run by young people. Young India Foundation has been working on youth empowerment by directly engaging young people and electoral politics, a first for an organization to do in India.\n\nThe United Nations has numerous development programs, one of them being youth empowerment programs. The United Nations provides support to national policy development surrounding empowerment within the five regions. They do this by providing evidence-based policy guidance and programmatic support by promoting the active participation of youth in society. The UNDP promotes inclusive youth participation in effective and democratic governance, economic empowerment of youth, strengthened youth engagement in building resilience in their communities, inclusion of youth in the future development agenda, including through consultations and discussions. The United Nations youth empowerment programs examine all four dimensions of youth empowerment and seeks to improve all of them.\n\nUSAID has youth empowerment programs set up around the world that are aimed at civic engagement, access to resources and opportunities for education and employment.\n\nFor a more comprehensive list: List of youth empowerment organizations\n\nYouth empowerment is often addressed as a gateway to intergenerational equity, civic engagement and democracy building. Local, state, provincial, regional, national, and international government agencies and nonprofit community-based organizations provide programs centered on youth empowerment. Activities involved therein may focus on youth-led media, youth rights, youth councils, youth activism, youth involvement in community decision-making, and other methods.\n\nEach major political party in the United States, including the Republicans, the Democrats, and the Green Party, as well as several major European, African, South American (Peru), and Australian political parties have statements supporting youth empowerment. Youth empowerment is also a central tenet of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which every country in the world (minus the United States and South Sudan) has signed into law.\n\nYouth empowerment occurs in homes, at schools, through youth organizations, government policy-making and community organizing campaigns. Major structural activities where youth empowerment happens throughout society include community decision-making, organizational planning, and education reform.\n\nEducational activities that cite youth empowerment as an aim include student-centered learning, popular education, and service learning. Free schools and youth-led media organizations often state their intention to empower youth, as well as youth voice, community youth development, and youth leadership programs. Youth empowerment is studied by a variety of scholars including Shawn Ginwright, Henry Giroux, Barry Checkoway, Mike Males and Marc A. Zimmerman. Their research is highlighted by advocacy from notable activists such as William Upski Wimsatt, Alex Koroknay-Palicz, Salome Chasnoff and Adam Fletcher.\n\nIn 2002 Comhairle na nÓg was established in each local authority area as part of the National Children's strategy. Comhairle na nÓg is Irish for Youth Council. These councils are encouraged to include the participation of young people from all walks of life and to tackle local issues affecting young people. It is run by the local county or city councils under the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. It is a recognized political organisation by the Irish Government. An extension of Comhairle na nÓg is the Comhairle na nÓg National Executive. The National Executive has one \"youth councillor\" from every Comhairle na nÓg and deal with issues important to young people. These issues are nominated by young people themselves at an AGM every two years. The Comhairle na nÓg National Executive has the opportunity to express there views in a form of a researched report, ad-campaign, conferences, seminars and to put those views to policy makers.\n\nThe 53 member countries of the Commonwealth of Nations have all signed up to the Commonwealth Plan of Action for Youth Empowerment (2007–2015). The Plan of Action underpins the work of the Commonwealth Youth Programme (CYP). On the Commonwealth definition, \"Young people are empowered when they acknowledge that they have or can create choices in life, are aware of the implications of those choices, make an informed decision freely, take action based on that decision and accept responsibility for the consequences of those actions. Empowering young people means creating and supporting the enabling conditions under which young people can act on their own behalf, and on their own terms, rather than at the direction of others.\"\n\nThe Plan of Action for Youth Empowerment was developed by the Commonwealth Secretariat, working closely with Ministers of Youth and young people themselves. It encourages youth mainstreaming and contains thirteen action points for governments. The first of these is: “Develop and implement measures to promote the economic enfranchisement of young people” through a range of measures ranging from micro-credit and entrepreneurship education through to reviewing macro-economic planning and trade regimes and how they affect young people. Other action points address gender equality, HIV/AIDS, education, the environment, youth participation in decision-making, and democracy and human rights.\n\nWhen youth participate in established empowerment programs they see a variety of benefits. The practices of youth involvement and empowerment become embedded within the organizational culture and the community culture. Adults and organizations also benefit from empowerment programs. The both become more communicable and responsive to youth in the community, which leads to program improvements as well as increased participation from youth.\n\nOne major critique of youth empowerment is that most programs take a risk-focused approach. There has been a major emphasis on what is going wrong for youth in their lives rather than what goes right. This portrays young people as a problem that need to be fixed, and displays the process of development as a process of overcoming risk. This may deter youth from joining youth development programs. The risked-based model can obscure the fact that adolescence is a time when young people master skills and concepts.\n\n"}
