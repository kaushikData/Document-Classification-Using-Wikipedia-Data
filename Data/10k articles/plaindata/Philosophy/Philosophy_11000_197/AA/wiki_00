The idea of giving something to one person by paying another was applied by Benjamin Franklin as a \"trick [...] for doing a deal of good with a little money\", which came to be known as \"pay it forward.\" This form of giving is often used as an alternative to consumerism and to mitigate the impact of gift-giving on the environment.\n\nCharities that promote this type of donating will normally provide a card or certificate describing the donation, often with an example of how the donation will be used (such as one day’s worth of food for a hungry person) or a symbolic denomination, called \"ownership\" or \"adoption\" (of an animal or a tree for example). Some charities promote alternative giving at weddings in place of wedding favors, normally providing several cards to be left on tables at the reception letting guests know a donation has been made rather than individual cards for each guest. Kate Middleton and Prince William made the decision to \"Pay it Forward\" with their wedding gifts, asking that the money to be used for gifts be given to charities and good causes.\n\nThe concept was spoofed in the \"Seinfeld\" episode \"The Strike\". George Costanza, angry at having received a donation to charity instead of an actual gift, made up his own non-existent charity and handed out fake donations to save money on gifts and cheques.\n\nComedian Ricky Gervais poked fun at the concept during a stand-up routine in which he recounts the time when his friends gave a goat to an African family in Gervais' name. Gervais considers this to be a lose-lose situation for all involved: he gets nothing, his friends spent a considerable amount of money on the alternative gift, the African family would not likely appreciate having \"another mouth to feed,\" and the goat being taken away from its natural environment to an unfamiliar place unsuited for it.\n"}

He was known as a pioneer of the enlightenment group. Bak Gyusu was a grandson of Park Ji-won, the great Silhak scholar of the Joseon. His nickname was Hwanjae (환재, 瓛齋), Hwanjae (환재, 桓齋) en Heonjae (헌재, 獻齋), Hwanjaegeosa (환재거사 瓛齋居士).\n\nIn 1827, Bak Gyusu met Crown Prince Hyomyeong, who quickly became a trusted friend. The Crown Prince would often ask Bak for his thoughts on the delicate political and social issues of the day. When the Crown Prince died three years later at the age of 20, Bak fell into a deep state of mourning. Due to this, Bak isolated himself from the outside world for twenty years.\n\nIn 1848, he successfully passed the Gwageo civil service exam, a test required for government work. Doing well on this test allowed Bak Gyusu to acquire a well-paid job early on. Later in his life, Bak became a mentor for a Korean politician Pak Yung-hio during the mid-1870s. Bak decided to instruct Pak Yung-hio in his ways of enlightened thinking after he took the initiative and sought him out. Bak's ideas influenced many people throughout Korea, the most notable being the Korean reformist Kim Okgyun, who went on to incorporate foreign sciences and technologies into Korea in order to help strengthen it against further encroachment and military advances by an increasingly imperialistic Japan.\n\nDuring the period of King Gojong's reign, the Queen actively supported him. Queen Sinjeong had been the wife of Crown Prince Hyomyeong, who was posthumously named King Munjo. Bak Gyusu was the governor of Pyongan province when the \"General Sherman\" incident occurred, an event commonly cited as an important catalyst to the ending of Korean isolationism in the 19th century. On the 9th of July, 1866, the \"General Sherman\" entered the Keupsa Gate without permission. Bak gave the \"General Sherman\"'s crew a warning to depart from Joseon. The ship's crew ignored his warning and captured the messenger adjutant-general Yi Hyon-Ik, a subordinate of Bak Gyusu. Bak was present during the rescue of Yi and the destruction of the \"General Sherman\" on the 24th of July, 1866. In 1872, Bak Gyusu was made the Joseon Chief Envoy to the court of the Tongzhi Emperor.\n\n\n"}

She is a critic of intelligent design and the Discovery Institute.\n\nForrest is a graduate of Hammond High School. She received her B.A. in English in 1974 from Southeastern Louisiana University, her M.A. in Philosophy in 1978 from Louisiana State University, and her Ph.D. in philosophy from Tulane University in 1988. She has taught philosophy at Southeastern Louisiana University since 1988 and presently is a professor of philosophy in the Department of History and Political Science.\n\nShe co-authored \"\" (Oxford University Press, 2004), with biologist Paul R. Gross. The book examines the goals and strategies of the intelligent design movement and its attempts to undermine the teaching of evolutionary biology. The authors analyze the absence of a scientific intelligent design hypothesis, identifies religious foundations, and the political ambitions of intelligent design proponents. They examine the movement's Wedge strategy which has advanced and is succeeding through public relations rather than through scientific research. They also highlight intelligent design creationism's relationship to public education and to the separation of church and state.\n\nForrest serves on the board of directors of the National Center for Science Education (NCSE), the Board of Trustees of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, and the New Orleans Secular Humanist Association (NOSHA).\n\nForrest was a key expert witness for the plaintiffs in the 2005 Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District trial. The defendants were represented by the Thomas More Law Center (TMLC), a conservative Christian, not-for-profit law center whose motto is \"The Sword and the Shield for People of Faith\". After Forrest had been deposed, the TMLC tried but failed to have her stopped from testifying. In a motion to have her removed as a witness, they described her as \"little more than a conspiracy theorist and a web-surfing, 'cyber-stalker' of the Discovery Institute...\" Judge Jones denied the motion and Forrest's testimony began on October 5.\n\nAccording to Forrest, after the TMLC's attempt to exclude her as a witness had failed, and only a few days before she would be testifying, the Discovery Institute attempted to publicly ridicule her on their website. She wrote:\nDuring her testimony the defense lawyers again asked the court to exclude Forrest from testifying as expert witness. Judge Jones allowed them to present their case for dismissing her and then denied their request. Forrest would go on to testify on the religious origins and nature of the intelligent design movement, the wedge document, and also demonstrated that the drafts of the textbook at the center of the court case, \"Of Pandas and People\", substituted terms such as \"intelligent design\" and \"intelligent designer\" in place of \"creationism\" and \"creator\" in an attempt to circumvent the ruling in the Edwards v. Aguillard which determined that teaching creationism in public schools violated the Establishment Clause of the United States constitution. Her testimony had a significant impact on Judge Jones's decision.\n\nA year after the ruling, Forrest commented in a telephone interview \"It was very clear to everyone who followed the case that intelligent design is not science. The Discovery Institute has been trying for years to foment a court case. And they finally got one dropped in their laps and what was ironic is they didn't want it. They knew what this case would do to them.\"\n\nAn essay by Forrest, \"The non-epistemology of intelligent design: its implications for public policy\", was published online in March 2009 as part of a special issue of the journal \"Synthese\". The issue was titled \"Evolution and Its Rivals\" and was guest edited by Glenn Branch and James H. Fetzer, the latter a former editor of \"Synthese\". Forrest's essay strongly criticized philosopher Francis J. Beckwith, noting that he had \"no formal credentials as a constitutional scholar\" to justify his stances on issues regarding the separation of church and state and connected Beckwith and other advocates of intelligent design to Christian Reconstructionism. Following complaints from Beckwith and others mentioned in the issue, the regular editors of \"Synthese\", Johan van Benthem, Vincent F. Hendricks, and John F. Symons, included an editorial statement in the print version of the special issue, published in January 2011, which criticized the tone of some of the papers in that issue. The note was perceived as directed at Forrest's essay and drew angry denunciations from the guest editors, who were not consulted about the statement, and other critics. At least one philosopher has withdrawn a paper from \"Synthese\" as a result.\n\nForrest worked with Zack Kopplin and helped begin the campaign to repeal the Louisiana Science Education Act law. The repeal effort, SB70 of 2011, failed in the Senate Education Committee by a 5-1 vote. The repeal effort, SB374 of 2012, also failed in the Senate Education Committee by a 2-1 effort.\n\nForrest has appeared in the media, including PBS. She was the featured speaker for Southeastern Louisiana University's Linus A. Sims Memorial Library commemoration of the 150th anniversary of the publication of Darwin's \"Origin of Species\" on 23 April 2009.\n\n\n"}

Hamilton. The work defines Black Power, presents insights into the roots of racism in the United States and means of reforming the traditional political process for the future. Published originally as \"Black Power: The Politics of Liberation in America\", the book has become a staple work produced during the Civil Rights Movement and Black Power movement.\n\nOne of the main focuses of the book is describing the struggles that black communities faced with trying to get involved in politics. Black people faced severe and violent discrimination in the 1950s, as well as segregation. Consequently, the community faced problems with political participation as the community faced material consequences of systemic racism when attempting to vote or engaging with the political world. Carmichael and Hamilton cite white supremacy, colonialism, and the systemic continuation of said dynamics as drivers of disenfranchisement and racism.\n\nThese issues led to the creation of certain groups and organizations. For instance, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) attempted to build organizational capacity within the Southern black community, offering a progressive alternative to the Democratic Party in Mississippi that would adopt the national party's platform (see Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party). By creating regional campaigns and running black candidates, SNCC saw success within their own community. However, with the limited power that this and other organizations held, their efforts to engage in the political arena for the black community were often not fully realized. This led the authors to reconceptualize Black Power as a tool for confronting the totality of oppression, not exclusively that of political representation.\n\nCarmichael and Hamilton continue to write about the ways that black communities' attempts to be active in politics have been thwarted by self-serving groups who offer shallow allyship. Criticizing labor movements, liberals, and the middle class for being complacent in systemic racism, Black Power challenges coalitions to genuinely serve the anti-racism and the needs of the black community. Carmichael and Hamilton state, \"We do not believe it is possible to form meaningful coalitions unless both or all parties are not only willing but believe it absolutely necessary to challenge [white supremacy] and other prevailing norms and institutions\".\n\nCarmichael and Hamilton write that Black Power meant more than simply changing the physical, material conditions of inequality faced by black Americans; it also meant changing perspectives of race relations in a historical context, both inside and outside the community. The authors believe Black Power not only rests in dismantling white supremacy, but also in establishing camaraderie within the black community. In this way, Black Power disavows the legitimacy of liberal, conformist politics, and instead seeks a degree of sovereignty for black community.\n"}

(i.e. 96 Minutes = 2 Muhūrta or 4 Ghaṭīkā.) Literally meaning \"The Creator's Hour\", it is traditionally the penultimate phase or muhurta of the night and is considered an auspicious time for all practices of yoga and most appropriate for\nmeditation, worship or any other religious practice.\nEach muhurta lasts 48 minutes, and therefore the Brahma muhurta begins 1 hour and 36 minutes before sunrise, and ends 48 minutes before sunrise. The time of sunrise varies each day, according to geographic location and time of year, thus the time of the Brahma muhurta also varies. For example, if sunrise is at 6am, the brahma muhurta begins at 4:24am. If sunrise is at 7am, brahma muhurta begins at 5:24am, and so on. \n\nSri Thirumalai Krishnamacharya (S. T. K.)stated \"Think of God. If not God, the sun, if not the sun, your parents.\" S. T. K. identified himself with Vaishnavism(worship of Vishnu), as did Annanta, under the guidance of Shiva, who is the first yogi. A modern Yogi would then show reverence to the sun.\n\nIn the Kali Yuga, divinity can still be reached through yoga, but because of the agitated mind associated with the Yuga, Yoga must be practiced through Kriya, based on asana. It is therefore common for modern yogis whose lineage can be traced to S. T. K. to practice the Suryanamaskara (Sun Salutation) in the morning. The Sun Salutation can be used in ritual cleansing practice that uses the mind states associated with Vata in Ayurveda. These mind states are mentioned in Patanjali's Yoga sutras These qualities are nearer to the divine, as they pertain to stillness of the mind, which allows for the spirit to shine. It's because of the inherently stiller state of mind in Brahmamuhurtha, that meditative states can be more easily achieved.\n\nAyurveda states that there are three doshas found in the human physical body, called Vata (Air and Ether), Pitta (Fire and Water) and Kapha (Earth and Water). The increase or decrease of these three doshas is related to the cycles of time. From sunrise until 10:00am is the time of Kapha; from 10:00am until 2:00pm is Pitta time; and from 2:00pm until sunset (6:00pm) is the time of Vata.\n\nThe evening follows a similar pattern, from 6:00pm until 10:00pm is the time of Kapha, from 10:00pm until 2:00am is the time of Pitta, and from 2:00am until 6:00am (sunrise) is Vata time.\nBrahmamuhurtha occurs during the Vata phase of the morning, between 2:00am and 6:00am, and Yoga masters state that the best time to meditate is one and a half hours before dawn, because the mind is inherently still at that time, enabling one to achieve a deeper meditative state.\n"}

The data show that low socioeconomic status groups and racial and ethnic minorities will experience more negative health and economic impacts from the results of climate change than other populations in the United States. This term, climate gap, was first used in the May 2009 report, “The Climate Gap: Inequalities in How Climate Change Hurts Americans & How to Close the Gap”, as well as in a concurrent paper published in the journal, \"Environmental Justice\", by Seth B. Shonkoff, Rachel Morello-Frosch and colleagues entitled, \"Minding the Climate Gap: Implications of Environmental Health Inequities for Mitigation Policies in California\".\n\nDisparate health impacts of climate change\nExtreme weather events, such as heat waves, droughts and floods, are expected to increase in their frequency and intensity in the next hundred years due to climate change. Low socioeconomic status groups and racial and ethnic minorities are affected by heat-related illness at greater rates due to factors such as lack of access to air conditioning, lack of transportation, occupations that require outdoor work and the heat-island effect in urban neighborhoods.\n\nHigher temperatures resulting from climate change will also increase chemical interactions between nitrogen oxide, volatile organic gases and sunlight, leading to increased concentrations of ambient ozone in urban areas. Along with particulate matter, ozone is a primary cause of air pollution-related health effects. Low socioeconomic status groups and racial and ethnic minorities in the United States are more likely to live in areas with dangerous levels of air pollution. This pollution will be exacerbated by climate change, and low socioeconomic status groups and racial and ethnic minorities are more likely to lack health insurance, making them increasingly vulnerable to these elevated levels of air pollutants. \n\nDisparate economic impacts of climate change\nThe proportion of income that low socioeconomic status groups spend on basic necessities such as food, water and energy is already greater than the proportion spent by other populations and is expected to increase as the cost of these necessities increases due to climate change.\n\nAdditionally, job sectors that employ predominantly low socioeconomic status groups and racial and ethnic minorities such as the agriculture and tourism industries are projected to experience the most dramatic shifts due to climate change, reducing employment opportunities for these populations.\n\nAlso, due to the lack of access to insurance and emergency credit, less savings, fewer personal resources and disproportionate hardships from previous economic stress, low socioeconomic status groups and racial and ethnic minorities are likely to suffer the most pronounced and long-lasting economic impacts from climate change-related extreme weather events such as hurricanes.\n\n"}

It falls within the most common category of Christian prayer known as supplication. \n\nEach day of the year at 1 p.m. Central Standard Time/Central Daylight Time a Daily Prayer for Peace is held as part of a brief worship for that purpose held in the sanctuary of the Independence Temple. The sanctuary is open to the public as members lead a brief worship service that includes the Daily Prayer for Peace. The form of the prayer is a public spoken prayer, usually written by one of the members from somewhere in the world and read aloud either by that member or another person. Each day of the year, the Daily Prayer for Peace is focused on the needs of a different nation of the world. The supplicant prays aloud for peace under the 150-foot dome of the temple spire.\n\nThose living in or visiting Independence, Mo. are encouraged to stop in to participate in this worship experience, and those elsewhere around the globe are encouraged to pause for a moment of silent prayer.\n\nAt the 1984 World Conference of the Community of Christ, its President, Wallace B. Smith, called for the construction of the Independence Temple and its dedication \"to the pursuit of peace.\"\n\nA committee formed to consider the worship ministries to be held in the new temple, devised the idea of a Daily Prayer for Peace to act as a witness of Christ's peace and a \"symbol of the Church's unrelenting pursuit of peace.\" \n\nThe Daily Prayer for Peace has been held daily in the Independence Temple since December 1993. It is one of many practices, including the Community of Christ International Peace Award that distinguish the denomination and its members.\n\nPrior to 9 April 2007 the Daily Prayer for Peace was held at 12:30 p.m. Central Standard Time/Central Daylight Time. With the change in time those working at Community of Christ International Headquarters are encouraged to pause and attend this service.\n\nSince 26 October 2007 each Friday at Noon Eastern Time the Daily Prayer for Peace service is celebrated at the Kirtland Temple Complex as the Friday Prayer for Peace. Starting in May 2008 it started being celebrated daily in both Independence and Kirtland.\n\nThe committee developed a standard order of service which is normally followed: Gathering in Silence, Call to Prayer, Lighting of Candle, Invitation, Scripture Reading, Prayer for Peace, Prayers of the People, Hymn, Benediction and Postlude. \n\nIn order to ensure a truly global reach for the prayers, a different country is named each day as a focus of prayer.

It can also refer to local manufacture via the historic cottage industry model, or manufacturing that takes place in the homes of consumers.\n\nWithin the maker movement and DIY culture, small scale production by consumers often using peer to peer resources is being referred to as distributed manufacturing. Consumers download digital designs from an open design repository website like Youmagine or Thingiverse and produce a product for low costs through a distributed network of 3D printing services such as 3D Hubs or at home with an open-source 3-D printer such as the RepRap. \n\nThe primary attribute of distributed manufacturing is the ability to create value at geographically dispersed locations via manufacturing. For example, shipping costs could be minimized when products are built geographically close to their intended markets. Also, products manufactured in a number of small facilities distributed over a wide area can be customized with details adapted to individual or regional tastes. Manufacturing components in different physical locations and then managing the supply chain to bring them together for final assembly of a product is also considered a form of distributed manufacturing. Digital networks combined with additive manufacturing allow companies a decentralized and geographically independent distributed production (Cloud manufacturing).\n\nSome call attention to the conjunction of Commons-based peer production with distributed manufacturing techniques. The self-reinforced fantasy of a system of eternal growth can be overcome with the development of economies of scope, and here, the civil society can play an important role contributing to the raising of the whole productive structure to a higher plateau of more sustainable and customised productivity. Further, it is true that many issues, problems and threats rise due to the large democratization of the means of production, and especially regarding the physical ones. For instance, the recyclability of advanced nanomaterials is still questioned; weapons manufacturing could become easier; not to mention the implications on counterfeiting and on \"intellectual property\". It might be maintained that in contrast to the industrial paradigm whose competitive dynamics were about economies of scale, Commons-based peer production and distributed manufacturing could develop economies of scope. While the advantages of scale rest on cheap global transportation, the economies of scope share infrastructure costs (intangible and tangible productive resources), taking advantage of the capabilities of the fabrication tools. And following Neil Gershenfeld in that “some of the least developed parts of the world need some of the most advanced technologies”, commons-based peer production and distributed manufacturing may offer the necessary tools for thinking globally but act locally in response to certain problems and needs. This can take the most radical form --individual personal manufacturing.\n"}
{"id": "38403063", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38403063", "title": "Doctrinal background of Zen", "text": "Doctrinal background of Zen\n\nZen has a rich doctrinal background, despite the traditional Zen narrative which states that it is a \"special transmission outside scriptures\" which \"did not stand upon words.\"\n\nClassical Chinese Chán is characterised by a set of polarities: absolute-relative, Buddha-nature - sunyata, sudden and gradual enlightenment, esoteric and exoteric transmission.\n\nThe Prajnaparamita-sutras and Madhyamaka emphasized the non-duality of form and emptiness: \"form is emptiness, emptiness is form\", as the heart sutra says. \nThis was understood to mean that ultimate reality is not a transcendental realm, but equal to the daily world of relative reality. This idea fitted into the Chinese culture, which emphasized the mundane world and society. But this does not tell how the absolute is present in the relative world:\n\nThis question is answered in such schemata as the Five Ranks of Tozan, the Oxherding Pictures, and Hakuin's Four ways of knowing.\n\nThe Madhyamaka-scheme of the Two Truths doctrine, and the Yogacara-schemes of the Three Natures and the Trikaya-doctrine, also give depictions of the interplay between the absolute and the relative.\n\nWhen Buddhism was introduced in China it was understood in terms of its own culture. Various sects struggled to attain an understanding of the Indian texts. The Tathāgatagarbha Sutras and the idea of the Buddha-nature were endorsed, because of the perceived similarities with the Tao, which was understood as a transcendental reality underlying the world of appearances. Sunyata at first was understood as pointing to the Taoist \"wu\", \"nothingness\".\n\nThe doctrine of the Buddha-nature asserts that all sentient beings have Buddha-nature (Skt. \"Buddhadhātu\", \"Buddha Element\", \"Buddha-Principle\"), the element from which awakening springs. The Tathāgatagarbha Sutras (literally: the womb of the thus-gone) state that every living being has the potential to realize awakening. Hence Buddhism offers salvation to every-one, not only to monks or those who have freed themselves almost completely from karma in previous lives. The Yogacara theory of the Eight Consciousnesses explains how sensory input and the mind create the world we experience, and obscure the alaya-vijnana, which is equated to the Buddha-nature.\n\nWhen this potential is realized, and the defilements have been eliminated, the tathagatagarbha manifests as the Dharmakaya, the absolute reality which pervades everything in the world. In this way, it is also the primordial reality from which phenomenal reality springs. When this understanding is idealized, it becomes a transcendental reality beneath the world of appearances.\n\nSunyata points to the \"emptiness\" or no-\"thing\"-ness of all \"things\". Though we perceive a world of concrete and discrete objects, designated by names, on close analysis the \"thingness\" dissolves, leaving them \"empty\" of inherent existence. The Heart sutra, a text from the prajnaparamita-sutras, articulates this in the following saying in which the five skandhas are said to be \"empty\":\n\nThe teachings on the five skandhas belong to the central teachings in the Tripitaka. They form a subdivision of the Samyutta Nikaya. The five skandhas are also mentioned in the Lankavatara-sutra:\nThe Yogacara explains this \"emptiness\" in an analysis of the way we perceive \"things\". Everything we conceive of is the result of the working of the five skandhas—results of perception, feeling, volition, and discrimination. The five skandhas together compose consciousness. The \"things\" we are conscious of are \"mere concepts\", not \"Ding an sich\".\n\nIt took Chinese Buddhism several centuries to recognize that sunyata does not refer to \"wu\", \"nothingness\", nor does Buddhism postulate an undying soul. The influence of those various doctrinal and textual backgrounds is still discernible in Zen. Zen teachers still refer to Buddha-nature, but the Zen tradition also emphasizes that Buddha-nature \"is\" sunyata, the absence of an independent and substantial self.\n\nIn Zen Buddhism two main views on the way to enlightenment are discernible, namely sudden and gradual enlightenment.\n\nEarly Chán recognized the \"transcendence of the body and mind\", followed by \"non-defilement [of] knowledge and perception\", meaning sudden insight into the true nature followed by gradual purification of intentions.\n\nIn the 8th-century the Ch'an-history was effectively re-fashioned by Shenhui, who created a dichotomy between the so-called \"Northern School\", led by Yuquan Shenxiu, and his own line of teaching, which he called the \"Southern school\". Shenhui placed Hui-neng into prominence as the sixth Chán-patriarch, and emphasized \"sudden enlightenment\", as opposed to the concurrent Northern School's alleged \"gradual enlightenment\". According to the \"sudden enlightenment\" propagated by Shenhui insight into true nature is sudden; thereafter there can be no misunderstanding anymore about this true nature.\n\nIn the Platform Sutra the dichotomy between sudden and gradual is reconciled. Guifeng Zongmi, fifth-generation successor to Shenhui, also softened the edge between sudden and gradual. In his analysis, sudden awakening points to seeing into one's true nature, but is to be followed by a gradual cultivation to attain Buddhahood.\n\nChinul, a 12th-century Korean Seon master, followed Zongmi, and also emphasized that insight into our true nature is sudden, but is to be followed by practice to ripen the insight and attain full Buddhahood. This is also the standpoint of the contemporary Sanbo Kyodan, according to whom kensho is at the start of the path to full enlightenment.\n\nThis gradual cultivation is also recognized by Tozan, who described the Five ranks of enlightenment. Other example of depiction of stages on the path are the Ten Ox-Herding Pictures which detail the steps on the Path, The Three mysterious Gates of Linji, and the Four Ways of Knowing of Hakuin. This gradual cultivation is described by Chan Master Sheng Yen as follows:\nThe emphasis which Shenhui placed on sudden enlightenment, also reflected a growing appreciation of the Diamond Sutra in 8th-century Chinese Buddhism. The Lankavatara-sutra, which endorses the Buddha-nature, emphasized purity of mind, which can be attained in gradations. The Diamond-sutra emphasizes sunyata, which \"must be realized totally or not at all\".\n\nOnce the dichotomy between sudden and gradual was in place, it defined its own logic and rhetorics, which are also recognizable in the distinction between Caodong (Soto) and Lin-ji (Rinzai) chán. But it also leads to a \"sometimes bitter and always prolix sectarian controversy between later Chán and Hua-yen exegetes\". In the Huayan classification of teachings, the sudden approach was regarded inferior to the Perfect Teaching of Hua-yen. Guifeng Zongmi, fifth patriarch of Hua-yen ànd Chán-master, devised his own classification to counter this subordination. To establish the superiority of the Chán-teachings, Chinul explained the sudden approach as not pointing to mere emptiness, but to \"suchness\" or the dharmadhatu.\n\nAccording to Borup the emphasis on 'mind to mind transmission' is a form of esoteric transmission, in which \"the tradition and the enlightened mind is transmitted face to face\". Metaphorically this can be described as the transmission from a flame from one candle to another candle, or the transmission from one vein to another. In exoteric transmission requires \"direct access to the teaching through a personal discovery of one's self. This type of transmission and identification is symbolized by the discovery of a shining lantern, or a mirror.\"\n\nThis polarity is recognizable in the emphasis that the Zen-tradition puts on maintaining the correct Dharma transmission, while simultaneously stressing seeing into one's nature:\nNevertheless, while the Zen tradition has always stressed the importance of formal Dharma transmission, there are well known examples of Mushi dokugo, such as Nōnin, Jinul and Suzuki Shōsan who attained awakening on their own, though all of them were familiair with the Zen-teachings.\n\nAn important, though easily overlooked aspect of Zen is the bodhisattva ideal. It supplements kensho and insight into the absolute with Karuṇā, compassion with all sentient beings. This ideal is reflected in the Bodhisattva vow and the Bodhisattva Precepts or jukai.\n\nPart of this Bodhisattva-ideal are the pāramitās, which are also being mentioned in the Diamond Sutra: \n\nThe Bodhisattva-ideal is a central theme in the prajnaparamita-sutras.\n\nDogen mentions the Bodhisattva-ideal throughout his works.\n\nHakuin saw \"deep compassion and commitment to help all sentient beings everywhere\" as an indispensable part of the Buddhist path to awakening. Hakuin emphasized the need of \"post-satori training\", purifying the mind of karmic tendencies and \nThe insight in the need of arousing bodhicitta formed Hakuin's final awakening:\nBuddhas and bodhisattvas such as Amitābha, Avalokiteśvara, Mañjuśrī, Samantabhadra, and Kṣitigarbha are venerated alongside Gautama Buddha.\n\nBy repeatedly chanting the (chapter 25 of the Lotus Sutra), for example, one instills the Bodhisattva's ideals into one's mind. The ultimate goal is given in the end of the sutra, which states, \"In the morning, be one with Avalokiteshvara; in the evening, be one with Avalokiteshvara\". Through the realization of emptiness and the Mahayana notion that all things have Buddha-nature, one understands that there is no difference between the cosmic bodhisattva and oneself. The wisdom and compassion of the Bodhisattva one is chanting to is seen to equal the inner wisdom and compassion of the practitioner. Thus, the duality between subject and object, practitioner and Bodhisattva, chanter and sutra is ended.\n\n\n\nModern classics\n\nClassic history\n\nCritical Zen-studies\n\nOversight\n\nTexts\n\nHistory\n\nCritical Chán Research\n"}

{"id": "2374688", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2374688", "title": "Evolutionary capacitance", "text": "Evolutionary capacitance\n\nEvolutionary capacitance is the storage and release of variation, just as electric capacitors store and release charge. Living systems are robust to mutations. This means that living systems accumulate genetic variation without the variation having a phenotypic effect. But when the system is disturbed (perhaps by stress), robustness breaks down, and the variation has phenotypic effects and is subject to the full force of natural selection. An evolutionary capacitor is a molecular switch mechanism that can \"toggle\" genetic variation between hidden and revealed states. If some subset of newly revealed variation is adaptive, it becomes fixed by genetic assimilation. After that, the rest of variation, most of which is presumably deleterious, can be switched off, leaving the population with a newly evolved advantageous trait, but no long-term handicap. For evolutionary capacitance to increase evolvability in this way, the switching rate should not be faster than the timescale of genetic assimilation.\n\nThis mechanism would allow for rapid adaptation to new environmental conditions. Switching rates may be a function of stress, making genetic variation more likely to affect the phenotype at times when it is most likely to be useful for adaptation. In addition, strongly deleterious variation may be purged while in a partially cryptic state, so cryptic variation that remains is more likely to be adaptive than random mutations are. Capacitance can help cross \"valleys\" in the fitness landscape, where a combination of two mutations would be beneficial, even though each is deleterious on its own.\n\nThere is currently no consensus about the extent to which capacitance might contribute to evolution in natural populations. The possibility of evolutionary capacitance is considered to be part of the extended evolutionary synthesis.\n\nSwitches that turn robustness to phenotypic rather than genetic variation on and off do not fit the capacitance analogy, as their presence does not cause variation to accumulate over time. They have instead been called phenotypic stabilizers.\n\nIn addition to their native reaction, many enzymes perform side reactions. Similarly, binding proteins may spend some proportion of their time bound to off-target proteins. These reactions or interactions may be of no consequence to current fitness but under altered conditions, may provide the starting point for adaptive evolution. For example, several mutations in the antibiotic resistance gene B-lactamase introduce cefotaxime resistance but do not affect ampicillin resistance. In populations exposed only to ampicillin, such mutations may be present in a minority of members since there is not fitness cost (i.e. are within the neutral network). This represents cryptic genetic variation since if the population is newly exposed to cefotaxime, the minority members will exhibit some resistance.\n\nChaperones assist in protein folding. The need to fold proteins correctly is a big restriction on the evolution of protein sequences. It has been proposed that the presence of chaperones may, by providing additional robustness to errors in folding, allow the exploration of a larger set of genotypes. When chaperones are overworked at times of environmental stress, this may \"switch on\" previously cryptic genetic variation.\n\nThe hypothesis that chaperones can act as evolutionary capacitors is closely associated with the heat shock protein Hsp90. When Hsp90 is downregulated in the fruit fly \"Drosophila melanogaster\", a broad range of different phenotypes are seen, where the identity of the phenotype depends on the genetic background. This was thought to prove that the new phenotypes depended on pre-existing cryptic genetic variation that had merely been revealed. More recent evidence suggests that these data might be explained by new mutations caused by the reactivation of formally dormant transposable elements. However, this finding regarding transposable elements may be dependent on the strong nature of the Hsp90 knockdown used in that experiment.\n\nThe overproduction of GroEL in \"Escherichia coli\" increases mutational robustness. This can increase evolvability.\n\nSup35p is a yeast protein involved in recognising stop codons and causing translation to stop correctly at the ends of proteins. Sup35p comes in a normal form ([psi-]) and a prion form ([PSI+]). When [PSI+] is present, this depletes the amount of normal Sup35p available. As a result, the rate of errors in which translation continues beyond a stop codon increases from about 0.3% to about 1%.\n\nThis can lead to different growth rates, and sometimes different morphologies, in matched [PSI+] and [psi-] strains in a variety of stressful environments. Sometimes the [PSI+] strain grows faster, sometimes [psi-]: this depends on the genetic background of the strain, suggesting that [PSI+] taps into pre-existing cryptic genetic variation. Mathematical models suggest that [PSI+] may have evolved, as an evolutionary capacitor, to promote evolvability.\n\n[PSI+] appears more frequently in response to environmental stress. In yeast, more stop codon disappearances are in-frame, mimicking the effects of [PSI+], than would be expected from mutation bias or than are observed in other taxa that do not form the [PSI+] prion. These observations are compatible with [PSI+] acting as an evolutionary capacitor in the wild.\n\nEvolutionary capacitance may also be a general feature of complex gene networks, and can be seen in simulations of gene knockouts. A screen of all gene knockouts in yeast found that many act as phenotypic stabilizers. Knocking out a regulatory protein such as a chromatin regulator may lead to more effective capacitance than knocking out a metabolic enzyme.\n\nRecessive mutations can be thought of as cryptic when they are present overwhelmingly in heterozygotes rather than homozygotes. Facultative sex that takes the form of selfing can act as an evolutionary capacitor in a primarily asexual population by creating homozygotes. Facultative sex that takes the form of outcrossing can act as an evolutionary capacitor by breaking up allele combinations with phenotypic effects that normally cancel out.\n\n"}

{"id": "216629", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=216629", "title": "Friedrich Maximilian Klinger", "text": "Friedrich Maximilian Klinger\n\nFriedrich Maximilian von Klinger (17 February 1752 – 25 February 1831) was a German dramatist and novelist. His play \"Sturm und Drang\" (1776) gave name to the Sturm und Drang artistic epoch. He was a childhood friend of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and is often closely associated with Jakob Michael Reinhold Lenz. Klinger worked as a playwright for the \"Seylersche Schauspiel-Gesellschaft\" for two years, but eventually left the Kingdom of Prussia to become a General in the Imperial Russian Army.\n\nOne of the few eighteenth-century authors from the lower social class, Klinger was born of humble parentage in Frankfurt am Main. His father, Johannes Klinger, was a town constable who died when Klinger was just eight years old, forcing his mother Cornelia Fuchs Klinger, a sergeant's daughter, to support her son and two daughters by taking in laundry from the Frankfurt eliteincluding, perhaps, Klinger's future friends and patrons, the Goethes of Hirschgrabenallee. In spite of this misfortune, however, Klinger excelled in his studies and was awarded a tuition waiver to study at the gymnasium where he also raised funds for his family by working as a tutor.\n\nThough there is little documentation of Klinger's earliest interactions with Goethe during their Frankfurt years, they appear to have made acquaintance by 1773, as Klinger had begun work on his first dramas, \"Otto\" and \"Das leidende Weib\" (\"The Suffering Wife\") which, according to his Leipzig publisher, owe a great debt to Goethe's then-unpublished \"Götz von Berlichingen mit der eisernen Hand\". Weygand released the collection at its Easter book fair of 1775, calling them \"plays in the Goethean/Lenzian Manner.\" Additionally, it was only with Goethe's financial assistance that Klinger was able to enroll at the University of Gießen in 1774 where he briefly studied to be a legal clerk.\n\nIn 1776, Klinger submitted his tragedy \"Die Zwillinge\" (\"The Twins\") to a contest hosted by the Hamburg theatre under the auspices of the actress Sophie Charlotte Ackermann and her son, the famous actor and playwright Friedrich Ludwig Schröder. The play took first prize, earning Klinger enough critical acclaim to be appointed Theaterdichter to the \"Seylersche Schauspiel-Gesellschaft\" headed by Abel Seyler and held this post for two years.\n\nIn 1778, he joined the Austrian military and took part in the War of the Bavarian Succession. In 1780, he went to Saint Petersburg, became an officer in the Imperial Russian Army, was ennobled and attached to the Grand Duke Paul, whom he accompanied on a journey to Italy and France. In 1785, he was appointed director of the corps of cadets, and having married Elizaveta Alekseyeva (rumored to be a natural daughter of Catherine the Great and Prince Grigory Orlov), was made praeses of the Academy of Knights in 1799. In 1803, Klinger was nominated by Emperor Alexander curator of the Universität Dorpat, an office he held until 1817. In 1811, he became lieutenant-general. He then gradually gave up his official posts, and after living for many years in honorable retirement, died in the imperial city of Dorpat in present-day Estonia.\n\nKlinger was a man of vigorous moral character and full of fine feeling, though the bitter experiences and deprivations of his youth are largely reflected in his dramas. It was one of his earliest works, \"Sturm und Drang\" (1776), which gave its name to this artistic epoch. In addition to this tragedy and \"Die Zwillinge\" (1776), the chief plays of his early period of passionate fervour and restless \"storm and stress\" are \"Die neue Arria\" (1776), \"Simsone Grisaldo\" (1776) and \"Stilpo und seine Kinder\" (1780). To a later period belongs the fine double tragedy of \"Medea in Korinth\" and \"Medea auf dem Kaukasos\" (1791). In Russia, he devoted himself mainly to the writing of philosophical romances, of which the best known are \"Fausts Leben, Taten und Höllenfahrt\" (1791), \"Geschichte Giafars des Barmeciden\" (1792) and \"Geschichte Raphaeis de Aquillas\" (1793). This series was closed in 1803 with \"Betrachtungen und Gedanken über verschiedene Gegenstände der Welt und der Literatur\". In these works, Klinger gives calm and dignified expression to the leading ideas which the period of Sturm und Drang had bequeathed to German classical literature.\n\n\nKlingers works were published in twelve volumes (1809–1815), also 1832–1833 and 1842. The most recent edition is in eight volumes (1878–1880); but none of these is complete. A selection will be found in A. Sauer, \"Stürmer und Dränger\", vol. 1. (1883). See E. Schmidt, \"Lenz und Klinger\" (1878); M. Rieger, \"Klinger in der Sturm-und Drangperiode\" (1880); and \"Klinger in seiner Reife\" (1896).\n\n"}

{"id": "176051", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=176051", "title": "German philosophy", "text": "German philosophy\n\nGerman philosophy, here taken to mean either (1) philosophy in the German language or (2) philosophy by Germans, has been extremely diverse, and central to both the analytic and continental traditions in philosophy for centuries, from Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz through Immanuel Kant, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Arthur Schopenhauer, Karl Marx, Friedrich Nietzsche, Martin Heidegger and Ludwig Wittgenstein to contemporary philosophers. Søren Kierkegaard (a Danish philosopher) is frequently included in surveys of German (or Germanic) philosophy due to his extensive engagement with German thinkers.\n\nGottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646–1716) was both a philosopher and a mathematician who wrote primarily in Latin and French. Leibniz, along with René Descartes and Baruch Spinoza, was one of the three great 17th century advocates of rationalism. The work of Leibniz also anticipated modern logic and analytic philosophy, but his philosophy also looks back to the scholastic tradition, in which conclusions are produced by applying reason to first principles or a priori definitions rather than to empirical evidence.\n\nLeibniz is noted for his optimism - his \"Théodicée\" tries to justify the apparent imperfections of the world by claiming that it is optimal among all possible worlds. It must be the best possible and most balanced world, because it was created by an all powerful and all knowing God, who would not choose to create an imperfect world if a better world could be known to him or possible to exist. In effect, apparent flaws that can be identified in this world must exist in every possible world, because otherwise God would have chosen to create the world that excluded those flaws.\n\nLeibniz is also known for his theory of monads, as exposited in \"Monadologie\". Monads are to the metaphysical realm what atoms are to the physical/phenomenal. They can also be compared to the corpuscles of the Mechanical Philosophy of René Descartes and others. Monads are the ultimate elements of the universe. The monads are \"substantial forms of being\" with the following properties: they are eternal, indecomposable, individual, subject to their own laws, un-interacting, and each reflecting the entire universe in a pre-established harmony (a historically important example of panpsychism). Monads are centers of force; substance is force, while space, matter, and motion are merely phenomenal.\n\nChristian Wolff (1679–1754) was the most eminent German philosopher after Leibniz. His main achievement was a complete \"oeuvre\" on almost every scholarly subject of his time, displayed and unfolded according to his demonstrative-deductive, mathematical method, which perhaps represents the peak of Enlightenment rationality in Germany.\n\nWolff was one of the first to use German as a language of scholarly instruction and research, although he also wrote in Latin, so that an international audience could, and did, read him. A founding father of, among other fields, economics and public administration as academic disciplines, he concentrated especially in these fields, giving advice on practical matters to people in government, and stressing the professional nature of university education.\n\nIn 1781, Immanuel Kant (1724–1804) published his \"Critique of Pure Reason\", in which he attempted to determine what we can and cannot know through the use of reason independent of all experience. Briefly, he came to the conclusion that we could come to know an external world through experience, but that what we could know about it was limited by the limited terms in which the mind can think: if we can only comprehend things in terms of cause and effect, then we can only know causes and effects. It follows from this that we can know the form of all possible experience independent of all experience, but nothing else, but we can never know the world from the “standpoint of nowhere” and therefore we can never know the world in its entirety, neither via reason nor experience.\n\nSince the publication of his \"Critique\", Immanuel Kant has been considered one of the greatest influences in all of western philosophy. In the late 18th and early 19th century, one direct line of influence from Kant is German Idealism.\n\nNeo-Kantianism refers broadly to the revival of the type of philosophy explained by Immanuel Kant and of the interpretations of Kant provided by post-Kantian philosophers such as Schopenhauer, Jakob Friedrich Fries and Johann Friedrich Herbart. Major figures in the neo-Kantian movement, which began around the 1860s, include Friedrich Albert Lange and Hermann Cohen.\n\nThe three most prominent German idealists were Johann Gottlieb Fichte (1762–1814), Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling (1775–1854) and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770–1831), who was the predominant figure in nineteenth century German philosophy.\n\nAn idiosyncratic opponent of German idealism, particularly Hegel's thought, was Arthur Schopenhauer (1788 – 1860). He was influenced by Eastern philosophy, particularly Buddhism, and was known for his pessimism. Schopenhauer's most influential work, \"The World as Will and Representation\", claimed that the world is fundamentally what we recognize in ourselves as our will. His analysis of will led him to the conclusion that emotional, physical, and sexual desires can never be fulfilled. Consequently, he eloquently described a lifestyle of negating desires, similar to the ascetic teachings of Vedanta and the Desert Fathers of early Christianity.\n\nAmong those influenced by Hegel was a group of young radicals called the Young Hegelians, who were unpopular because of their radical views on religion and society. They included Ludwig Feuerbach (1804–72), Bruno Bauer (1809–82) and Max Stirner (1806–56) among their ranks.\n\nKarl Marx (1818–83) often attended their meetings. He developed an interest in Hegelianism, French socialism and British economic theory. He transformed the three into an essential work of economics called \"Das Kapital\", which consisted of a critical economic examination of capitalism. Marxism became one of the major forces on twentieth century world history.\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900) was initially a proponent of Schopenhauer. However, he soon came to disavow Schopenhauer's pessimistic outlook on life and sought to provide a positive philosophy. He believed this task to be urgent, as he believed a form of nihilism caused by modernity was spreading across Europe, which he summed up in the phrase \"God is dead\". His problem, then, was how to live a positive life considering that if you believe in God, you give in to dishonesty and cruel beliefs (e.g. divine predestination of some individuals to Hell), and if you don't believe in God, you give in to nihilism. He believed he found his solution in the concepts of the Übermensch and Eternal Recurrence. His work continues to have a major influence on both philosophers and artists.\n\nIn the late 19th century, the predicate logic of Gottlob Frege (1848–1925) overthrew Aristotelian logic (the dominant logic since its inception in Ancient Greece). This was the beginning of analytic philosophy. In the early part of the 20th century, a group of German and Austrian philosophers and scientists formed the Vienna Circle to promote scientific thought over Hegelian system-building, which they saw as a bad influence on intellectual thought. The group considered themselves logical positivists because they believed all knowledge is either derived through experience or arrived at through analytic statements, and they adopted the predicate logic of Frege, as well as the early work of Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889–1951) as foundations to their work. Wittgenstein did not agree with their interpretation of his philosophy.\n\nWhile some of the seminal philosophers of twentieth-century analytical philosophy were German-speakers, most German-language philosophy of the twentieth century tends to be defined not as analytical but 'continental' philosophy – as befits Germany's position as part of the European 'continent' as opposed to the British Isles or other culturally European nations outside of Europe.\n\nPhenomenology began at the start of the 20th century with the descriptive psychology of Franz Brentano (1838–1917), and then the transcendental phenomenology of Edmund Husserl (1859–1938). It was then transformed by Martin Heidegger (1889–1976), whose famous book \"Being and Time\" applied phenomenology to ontology, and who, along with Ludwig Wittgenstein, is considered one of the most influential philosophers of the 20th century. Phenomenology has had a large influence on Continental Philosophy, particularly existentialism and poststructuralism. Heidegger himself is often identified as an existentialist, though he would have rejected this.\n\nHermeneutics is the philosophical theory and practice of interpretation and understanding.\n\nOriginally hermeneutics referred to the interpretation of texts, especially religious texts. In the 19th century, Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834), Wilhelm Dilthey (1833–1911) and others expanded the discipline of hermeneutics beyond mere exegesis and turned it into a general humanistic discipline. Schleiermacher wondered whether there could be a hermeneutics that was not a collection of pieces of ad hoc advice for the solution of specific problems with text interpretation but rather a \"general hermeneutics,\" which dealt with the \"art of understanding\" as such, which pertained to the structure and function of understanding wherever it occurs. Later in the 19th century, Dilthey began to see possibilities for continuing Schleiermacher's general hermeneutics project as a \"general methodology of the humanities and social sciences\".\n\nIn the 20th century, hermeneutics took an 'ontological turn'. Martin Heidegger's \"Being and Time\" fundamentally transformed the discipline. No longer was it conceived of as being about understanding linguistic communication, or providing a methodological basis for the human sciences - as far as Heidegger was concerned, hermeneutics is ontology, dealing with the most fundamental conditions of man's being in the world. The Heideggerian conception of hermeneutics was further developed by Heidegger's pupil Hans-Georg Gadamer (1900–2002), in his book \"Truth and Method\".\n\nIn 1923, Carl Grünberg founded the Institute for Social Research, drawing from Marxism, Freud's psychoanalysis and Weberian philosophy, which came to be known as the \"Frankfurt School\". Expelled by the Nazis, the school reformed again in Frankfurt after World War II. Although they drew from Marxism, they were outspoken opponents of Stalinism. Books from the group, like Adorno’s and Horkheimer’s \"Dialectic of Enlightenment\" and Adorno’s \"Negative Dialectics\", critiqued what they saw as the failure of the Enlightenment project and the problems of modernity. Postmodernists consider the Frankfurt school to be one of their precursors.\n\nSince the 1960s the Frankfurt School has been guided by Jürgen Habermas' (born 1929) work on communicative reason, linguistic intersubjectivity and what Habermas calls \"the philosophical discourse of modernity\".\n\n\n"}

Immanuel Kant made a study of whether inclination is of the highest moral worth, and objected to Aristotle's analysis, reasoning that \"it is the person who acts from the motive of duty in the teeth of contrary inclination who shows an especially high degree of moral worth.\" \nKant posits the example of a shopkeeper who continually charges fair prices to customers in order to build good will and repeat business. If the shopkeeper continued that practice due to a mere inclination (to obtain repeat business) rather than sense of duty (higher principles of fairness and justice), though the shopkeeper's keeping the prices fair may conform with duty it has \"no true moral worth.\" If instead the shopkeeper kept the prices fair solely out a duty to justice then he is acting simply from that duty. And in that case, in so doing Kant argues that the act now has \"genuine moral worth.\"\n\nBut changing the facts of the example might lead to an altogether different conclusion. If instead the shopkeeper is nearly bankrupt and desperately needs money to feed his family, and still the shopkeeper keeps the prices fair less out of a sense of duty but rather a sense of pride (an inclination), then some may argue that it is more impressive to stay fair under those circumstances.\n\nKant argues that acting out of pure duty has the highest value, in that the visitor is doing the right thing for the right reason, because it is the right thing to do. It is not always clear whether inclination is morally more worthy than duty, or vice versa. For example, if following one's moral duty to always tell the truth has the highest value, then telling the truth (the location of a person) where it results in the murder of that person may show that following pure duty may not have the highest moral value.\n\nBut many criticisms of Kant do not take into account that he did not preclude other acts from having moral worth, instead Kant is said to have only valued acting from pure duty as having \"true\" or \"authentic\" moral worth. Philosophers tend to disagree on whether operating solely out of duty is always the most morally worthy thing to do, rather than operating via inclination.\n\nOne famous example illustrates the difference between inclination and duty while illustrating a criticism of it, as given by Michael Stocker in his paper \"The Schizophrenia of Modern Ethical Theories\" (1976).\n\nThe visitor could be seen as lacking in moral merit. In other words, which scenario has more moral worth: one in which the friend goes to the hospital out of a cold sense of duty (what one should do) instead of wanting to do it (inclination)? Kant might argue that the former has the \"true\" or \"authentic\" moral worthiness where Stocker argues acting purely out of duty in his example is morally inauthentic.\n"}

For example, if one believes that \"the sky is blue\" and one also believes that \"grass is green\", then one can introduce the connective \"and\" as follows: \"The sky is blue AND grass is green.\" Gentzen's idea was that having rules like this is what gives meaning to one's words, or at least to certain words. The idea has also been associated with Wittgenstein's dictum that in many cases we can say, \"meaning is use\". Most contemporary logicians prefer to think that the introduction rules and the elimination rules for an expression are equally important. In this case, \"and\" is characterized by the following rules:\nAn apparent problem with this was pointed out by Arthur Prior: Why can't we have an expression (call it \"tonk\") whose introduction rule is that of OR (from \"p\" to \"p tonk q\") but whose elimination rule is that of AND (from \"p tonk q\" to \"q\")? This lets us deduce anything at all from any starting point. Prior suggested that this meant that inferential rules could \"not\" determine meaning. He was answered by Nuel Belnap, that even though introduction and elimination rules can constitute meaning, not just any pair of such rules will determine a meaningful expression—they must meet certain constraints, such as not allowing us to deduce any new truths in the old vocabulary. These constraints are what Dummett was referring to.\n\nHarmony, then, refers to certain constraints that a proof theory must let hold between introduction and elimination rules for it to be meaningful, or in other words, for its inference rules to be meaning-constituting.\n\nThe application of harmony to logic may be considered a special case; it makes sense to talk of harmony with respect to not only inferential systems, but also conceptual systems in human cognition, and to type systems in programming languages.\n\nSemantics of this form has not provided a very great challenge to that sketched in Tarski's semantic theory of truth, but many philosophers interested in reconstituting the semantics of logic in a way that respects Ludwig Wittgenstein's \"meaning is use\" have felt that harmony holds the key.\n\n\n"}

To get closer to this question it is necessary to have a look at the basic aspects of syntax in language, as language unquestionably presents a complex syntactical system. If music has a matchable syntax, noteworthy equivalents to basic aspects of linguistic syntax have to be found in musical structure. By implication the processing of music in comparison to language could also give information about the structure of music.\n\nSyntax in general can be referred to as a study of the principles and rules needed for the construction of a language or as a term in particular describing these principles and rules for a special language.\n\nLinguistic syntax is especially marked by its structural richness, which becomes apparent in its multi layered organization as well as in the strong relationship between syntax and meaning. That is that there are special linguistic syntactic principles that define how the language is formed out of different subunits, such as words out of morphemes, phrases out of words and sentences out of phrases. Furthermore, linguistic syntax is featured by the fact that a word can take on abstract grammatical functions that are less defined through properties of the word itself and more through the context and structural relations. This is for example that every noun can be used as a subject, object or indirect object, but without a sentence as the normal context of a word, no statement about its grammatical function can be made. At last, linguistic syntax is marked by abstractness. This means that only conventional structural relations and not psychoacoustic relationships are the basis for the linguistic syntax.\n\nConcerning musical syntax these three aspects of richness in linguistic syntax as well as the abstractness should be found in music too, if one wants to claim that music has a comparable syntax. An annotation that has to be made concerns the fact that most of the studies dealing with musical syntax are confined to the consideration of Western European tonal music. Thus this article can also only focus on Western tonal music.\n\nConsidering the multilayered organization of music, three levels of pitch organization can be found in music.\n\nThe lowest level are musical scales, which consist of seven tones or \"scale degrees\" per octave and have an asymmetric pattern of intervals between them (for example the C-major scale). They are built up out of the 12 possible pitch classes per octave (A, A,B, C, C, D, D, E, F, F, G, G) and the different scale tones are not equal in their structural stability. Empirical evidence indicates that there is a hierarchy concerning the stability of the single tones. The most stable one is called the \"tonic\" and embodies the tonal centre of the scale. The most unstable tones were the ones closest to the tonic (scale degrees 2 and 7), which are called the \"supertonic\" and the \"leading tone\". In studies scale degrees 1, 3 and 5 have been judged as closely related. It was also shown that an implicit knowledge of scale structure has to be learned and developed in childhood and is not inborn.\n\nThe next superordinate level of pitch organization is the chord structure, which means that three scale tones with a distance of two scale steps each are played simultaneously and are therefore combined into chords. When building up chords on the basis of a musical scale there are three different kinds of chords resulting, namely \"major\"(e.g. C-E-G), \"minor\" (e.g. D-F-A) and \"diminished\" (e.g. B-D-F) triads. This is due to the asymmetric intervals between the scale tones. These asymmetric intervals effect, that a distance of two scale steps can comprise either three or four semitones and therefore be an interval of a minor (with three semitones) or a major (with four semitones) third. A major triad consists of a major third followed by a minor third and is built on scale degrees 1, 3 and 5 (or 4, 6 and 1, for the subdominant, and 5, 7 and 2, for the dominant, the other two major triads that can be formed from the major scale). A minor triad consists of a minor third followed by a major third and is built on scale degrees 2, 4 and 6 (or 3, 5 and 7, for the mediant, and 6, 1 and 4, for the submediant). Only on scale degree 7 the triad consists of two minor thirds and is therefore defined as a diminished triad.\nChordal syntax touches mainly four basic aspects. The first is, that the lowest note in each triad functions as a fundament of the chord and therefore as the structural most important pitch. The chord is named after this note as well as the chord's harmonic label is grounded on it. The second aspect is, that chord syntax provides norms for altering chords by additional tones. One example is the addition of a fourth tone to a triad, which is the seventh tone of the scale (e.g. in a C-major scale the addition of F to the triad G-B-D would lead to a so-called \"dominant seventh chord\"). Concerning norms for the progression of chords in time the third aspect focuses on the relationship between chords. The patterning of chords in a cadence for example indicates a movement from a V chord to a I chord. The fact that the I chord is perceived as a resting point in a musical phrase implicates, that the single chords built up on notes of a scale are not equal in there stability but show the same differences in stability as the notes of the scale do. This describes the fourth basic aspect of chordal syntax. The tonic chord (the one built on the tonic, C-E-G in C-major, for example) is the most stable and central chord, followed by the dominant chord (built on the 5th scale degree) and the subdominant chord (built on the 4th scale degree).\n\nThe highest level of pitch organization can be seen in key structure. In Western European tonal music the key is based on a scale with its associated chords and chord relations. Scales can be built up as minor or major scales (differing in the succession of intervals between the scale tones) on each of the 12 pitch classes and therefore there are 24 possible keys in tonal music. Analysing key structure in context of musical syntax means to examine the relationship between keys in a piece of music. Usually, not only one key is used to build up a composition, but also so-called key \"modulations\" (in other words the alteration of keys) are utilized. In these modulations a certain recurring pattern can be perceived. Switches from one key to another are often found between related keys. Three general principles for relationship between keys can be postulated on the basis of perceptual experiments and also neural evidence for implicit knowledge of key structure. Looking at the C-major key as an example, there are three close related keys: G-major, A-minor and C-minor. C-major and G-major are keys whose 1st scale degrees are separated by a musical fifth (the pattern of relations is represented in the circle of fifths\" for major keys). A-minor and C-major share the same notes of the scale but with a different tonic (so-called relative minor key, i.e. C-major and A-minor). And C-major and C-minor have the same tonic in their scales.\nAll in all it can be said that music like the human language has a considerable multi layered organization.\n\nConsidering the last two basic aspects of linguistic syntax, namely the considerable significance of the order of subunits for the meaning of a sentence as well as the fact that words undertake abstract grammatical functions defined through context and structural relations, it seems to be useful to analyse the hierarchical structure of music to find correlations in music.\n\nOne aspect of hierarchical structure of music is the ornamentation. The meaning of the word \"ornamentation\" points to the fact that there are events in a musical context that are less important to form an idea of the general gist of a sequence than others. The decision on the importance of events not only comprises harmonic considerations, but also rhythmic and motivic information. But a classification of events simply into ornamental and structural events would be too superficial. In fact the most common hypothesis implies, that music is organized into structural levels, which can be pictured as branches of a tree. A pitch that is structural at a higher level may be ornamental at a deeper level. This can be compared with the hierarchical syntactic structure of a sentence in which there are structural elements that are necessary to build up a sentence like the noun phrase and the verb phrase but looking at a deeper level the structural elements also contain additional or ornamental constituents.\n\nSearching for other aspects of hierarchical structure of music there is a controversial discussion, if the organization of tension and resolution in music can be described as hierarchical structure or only as a purely sequential structure. According to Patel research in this area has produced apparently contradictory evidence, and more research is needed to answer this question.\nThe question concerning the kind of structure that features tension and resolution in music is linked very close to the relationship between order and meaning in music. Considering tension and resolution as one possible kind of meaning in music a hierarchical structure would imply that a change of order of musical elements would have an influence on the meaning of the music.\n\nThe last aspect to examine is the abstractness of linguistic syntax and its correlate in music. There are two contradicting points of views. The first one claims that the foundation for musical scales and for the existence of a tonal centre in music can be seen in the physical basis of overtone series or in the psychoacoustic properties of chord in tonal music respectively. But in recent time there is strong evidence for the second point of view that syntax reflects abstract cognitive relationships.\n\nAll in all the consideration of syntax in music and language shows, that music has a syntax comparable to the linguistic syntax especially concerning a great complexity and a hierarchical organization. Nevertheless, it has to be emphasized, that musical syntax is not a simple variant of linguistic syntax, but a similar complex system with its own substance. That means that it would be the wrong way just to search for musical analogies of linguistic syntactic entities such as nouns or verbs.\n\nInvestigating the neuronal processing of musical syntax can serve two proposed aspects. The first is to learn more about the processing of music in general. That is, which areas of the brain are involved and if there are specific markers of brain activity due to the processing of music and musical syntax. The second aspect is to compare the processing of musical and linguistic syntax to find out, if they have an effect upon each other or if there even is a significant overlap. The verification of an overlap would support the thesis, that syntactic operations (musical as well as linguistic) are modular. \"Modular\" means, that the complex system of processing is decomposed into subsystems with modular functions. Concerning the processing of syntax this would mean, that the domain of music and language each have specific syntactic representations, but that they share neural resources for activating and integrating these representations during syntactic processing.\n\nProcessing of music and musical syntax comprises several aspects concerning melodic, rhythmic, metric, timbral and harmonic structure. For the processing of chord functions four steps in processing can be described.\n(1)Primarily, a tonal centre has to be detected out of the first chords of a sequence. Often the first chord is interpreted as the tonal centre of a sequence and a reevaluation is necessary, if the first chord has another harmonic function.\n(2)Successive chords are related to this tonal centre concerning their harmonic distance from the tonal centre.\n(3)As described above (Does music have a syntax?), music has a hierarchical structure in terms of pitch organization and organization of tensioning and releasing in music. Pitch organization concerning chords means, that in a musical phrase the tonic is the most stable chord and experienced as the resting point. The dominant and subdominant anon are more stable than the submediant and the supertonic. The progression of chords in time forms a tonal structure based on pitch organization, in which moving away from the tonic is perceived as tensioning and moving towards the tonic is experienced as releasing. Therefore, hierarchical relations may convey organized patterns of meaning.\n(4)Concerning harmonic aspects of major-minor tonal music, Musical syntax can be characterized by statistical regularities in the succession of chord functions in time, that is probabilities of chord transitions. As these regularities are stored in a long-term memory, predictions about following chords are made automatically, when listening to a musical phrase.\n\nThe violation of these automatically made predictions lead to the observation of so-called ERPs (event related potential, a stereotyped electrophysiological response to an internal or external stimulus). Two forms of ERPs can be detected in the context of processing music. One is the MMN (mismatch negativity), which has first been investigated only with physical deviants like frequency, sound intensity, timbre deviants (referred to as phMMN) and could now also be shown for changes of abstract auditory features like tone pitches (referred to as afMMN). The other one is the so-called ERAN (early right anterior negativity), which can be elicited by syntactic irregularities in music. Both the ERAN and the MMN are ERPs indicating a mismatch between predictions based on regularities and actually experienced acoustic information. As for a long time it seemed to be, that the ERAN is a special variant of the MMN, the question arises, why they are told apart today. There are several differences between the MMN and the ERAN found in the last years:\n\nEven though music syntactic regularities are often simultaneously acoustical similar and music syntactic irregularities are often simultaneously acoustical different, an ERAN but not an MMN can be elicit, when a chord does not represent a physical but a syntactic deviance. To demonstrate this, so-called \"Neapolitan sixth chords\" are used. These are consonant chords when played solitary, but which are added into a musical phrase of in which they are only distantly related to the harmonic context. Added into a chord sequence of five chords, the addition of a Neapolitan sixth chord at the third or at the fifth position evokes different amplitudes of ERANs in the EEG with a higher amplitude at the fifth position. Nevertheless, when creating a chord sequence in which the Neapolitan chord at the fifth position is music-syntactically less irregular than a Neapolitan chord at the third position, the amplitude is higher at the third position (see figure 4...). In opposition to the MMN, a clear ERAN is also elicited by using syntactically irregular chords, which are acoustically more similar to a proceeding harmonic context than syntactically regular chords. Therefore, the MMN seems to be based on an on-line establishment of regularities. That means, that the regularities are extracted on-line from the acoustic environment. In opposition, the ERAN rests upon representations of music-syntactic regularities which exist in a long-term memory format and which are learned during early childhood.\n\nThis is represented in the development of the ERAN and MMN. The ERAN cannot be verified in newborn babies, whereas the MMN can actually be demonstrated in fetus. In two-year-old children, the ERAN is very small, in five-year-old children a clear ERAN is found, but with a longer latency than in adults. With the age of 11 years children show an ERAN similar to ERANs in adults. Out of these observation the thesis can be built that the MMN is essential for the establishment and maintenance of representations of the acoustic environment and for processes of the auditory scene analysis. But only the ERAN is completely based on learning to build up a structural model, which is established with reference to representations of syntactic regularities already existing in a long-term memory format. Considering effects of training both the ERAN and the MMN can be modulated by training.\n\nDifferences between the ERAN and the MMN also exist in the neural sources for the main contributions to the ERPs. The sources for the ERAN are located in the pars opercularis of the inferior fronto-lateral cortex (inferior Brodmann's area with contributions from the ventrolateral premotor cortex and the anterior superior temporal gyrus, whereas the MMN receives its main contributions from and within the vicinity of the primary auditory cortex with additional sources in the frontal cortical areas. Therefore, the sources for the ERAN basically lie in the frontal cortex whereas the sources for the MMN are located in the temporal lobe. Other hints for this thesis emerge from the fact that under a propofol sedation which mainly affects the frontal cortex, the ERAN is abolished while the MMN is only reduced. At last, the amplitude of the ERAN is reduced under ignore conditions whereas the MMN is largely unaffected by attentional modulations.\n\n(1)First, a separation of sound sources, an extraction of sound features and the establishment of representations of auditory objects of the incoming acoustic input have to be made. The same processes are required for the MMN and ERAN.\n\n(2)For the MMN regularities are filtered on-line out of the input to create a model of the acoustic environment. At this point, there is a difference to the ERAN as for the ERAN representations of regularities already exist in a long-term memory format and the incoming sound is integrated into a pre existent model of musical structure.\n\n(3)According to the model of musical structure, predictions concerning forthcoming auditory events are formed. This process is similar for the ERAN and for the MMN.\n\n(4)At least a comparison between the actually incoming sound and the predictions based on the model is made. This process is partly the same for the MMN and the ERAN as well.\n\nAs the ERAN is similar to an ERP called ELAN which can be elicited by violation of linguistic syntax it seems to be obvious that the ERAN really represents syntactic processing. Deduced from this thought an interaction between music-syntactic and language-syntactic processing would be very likely.There are different possibilities in neuroscience to approach to an answer to the question of an overlap between the neuronal processing of linguistic and musical syntax.\n\nThis method deals with the question, how structure and function of the brain relate to outcomes in behaviour and other psychological processes. From this area of research there has been evidence for the dissociation between musical and linguistic syntactic abilities. In case reports it was possible to show that amusia ( a deficiency in fine-grainded perception of pitch which leads to musical tone-deafness and can be congenital or acquired later in life as from brain damage) is not necessarily linked to aphasia (severe language impairments following brain damage) and vice versa. This means that individuals with normal speech and language abilities showed musical tone-deafness as well as individuals with language impairments had sufficient means of musical syntactic abilities. The problem of neuropsychologic research is that there has not been a former case report which showed that aphasia does not necessarily entail amusia in non-musicians, to the contrary newer findings suggest that amusia is almost always linked to aphasia.\n\nFurthermore, results from neuroimaging led to the \"shared syntactic integration resource hypothesis\" (SSIRH), which supports the presumption, that there is an overlap between the processing of musical and linguistic syntax and that syntactic operations are modular. Furthermore, research using the method of electroencephalography has shown that a difficulty or irritation in musical as well as in linguistic syntax elicit ERPs which are similar to each other.\n\nHow can the discrepancy between neuropsychology and neuroimaging be explained?\n\nIn fact, the concept of modularity itself can help to understand the different and apparently contradicting findings in neuropsychologic research and neuroimaging. Introducing the concept of a dual system, in which there is a distinction between syntactic representation and syntactic processing, this could mean, that there is a distinction between long-term structural knowledge in a domain (representation) and operations conducted on that knowledge (syntactic processing). A damage in an area representing long-term musical knowledge would lead to amusia without aphasia, but a damage in an area representing syntactic processing would cause an impairment of both musical and linguistic syntactic processing.\n\nThe comparison of the syntactic processing of language and music is based on three theories which should be mentioned but which are not explained in detail. The first two, the \"dependency locality theory\" and the \"expectancy theory\" refer to syntactic processing in language, whereas the third one, the \"tonal pitch space theory\", relates to the syntactic processing in music.\n\nThe language theories contribute to the concept that in order to conceive the structure of a sentence, resources are consumed. If the conception of a this structure is difficult due to the fact that distant words belong to each other or an expected structure of the sentence is violated, more resources, namely the ones for activating low-activation items, are consumed.\n\nViolating an anticipated structure in music could mean a harmonically unexpected note or chord in a musical sequence. As in language this is associated with a \"processing cost due to the tonal distance\" (Patel, 2008) and therefore means that more resources are needed for activating low-activation items.\n\nOverall these theories lead to the \"shared syntactic integration resources hypothesis\" as the areas from which low-activation items are activated could be the correlate to the overlap between linguistic and musical syntax.\nStrong evidence for the existence of this overlap comes from studies, in which music-syntactic and a linguistic-syntactic irregularities were presented simultaneously. They showed an interaction between the ERAN and the LAN (left anterior negativity;ERP which is elicited by linguistic-syntactic irregularities). The LAN elicited was reduced when an irregular word was presented simultaneously with an irregular chord compared to the condition when an irregular word was presented with a regular chord. Contrary to this finding the phMMN elicited by frequency deviants did not interact with the LAN.\n\nFrom this facts it can be reasoned that the ERAN relies on neural resources related to syntactic processing (Koelsch 2008). Furthermore, they give strong evidence for the thesis, that there is an overlap between the processing of musical and linguistic syntax and therefore that syntactic operations (musical as well as linguistic) are modular.\n"}

Before meeting Gampopa, Dorje Gyalpo studied with Sachen Kunga Nyingpo \"(sa chen kun dga' snying po)\" (1092–1158) from whom he received lamdre transmission.\n\nIn 1158 Dorje Gyalpo built a reed-hut hermitage at Phakmo Drupa (\"Sow's Ferry Crossing\") in a juniper forest in Nedong () high above the Brahmaputra River. Later, as his fame spread and disciples gathered, this site developed into the major monastic seat of Dentsa Thel (). Following his death the monastery declined and his disciple Jigten Sumgön sent Chenga Drakpa Jungne () (1175–1255), a member of the Lang () family, to become abbot and look after the monastery.\n\nTai Situ Changchub Gyaltsen (1302–1364) was born into this Lang family. In 1322, he was appointed by the Sakyapas as the Pagmodru Myriarch of Nedong and given the title \"Tai Situ\" in the name of the Yuan emperor. Soon he fought with a neighboring myriarchy trying to recover land lost in earlier times. This quarrel displeased the Sakya ruler (\"dpon-chen\") Gyelwa Zangpo () who dismissed him as myriach. Following a split between Gyelwa Zangpo and his minister Nangchen Wangtsön (), the former restored Changchup Gyeltsen to his position in 1352. Taking advantage of the situation, Changchup Gyeltsen immediately went on the offensive and soon controlled the whole of the central Tibetan province of Ü. Gyelwa Zangpo and Changchup Gyeltsen were reconciled at a meeting with the Sakya lama Künpangpa (). This angered Nangchen Wangtsön, who usurped Gyelwa Zangpo as Sakya ruler and imprisoned him.\n\nIn 1351 Changchup Gyeltsen established an important Kagyu monastery at the ancient Tibetan capital of Tsetang. This was later dismantled during the time of the 7th Dalai Lama (18th century) and replaced by a Gelugpa monastery, Gaden Chokhorling.\n\nIn 1358, Wangtson assassinated Lama Kunpangpa. Learning of this, Changchup Gyeltsen then took his forces to Sakya, imprisoned Wangtsön, and replaced four hundred court officials and the newly appointed ruling lama. The Pagmodrupa rule of Central Tibet (U, Tsang and Ngari) dates from this coup in 1358.\n\nAs ruler, Changchup Gyeltsen was keen to revive the glories of the Tibetan Empire of Songtsän Gampo and assert Tibetan independence from the Yuan dynasty of the Mongols and from Ming China. He took the Tibetan title \"Desi\" (sde-srid), re-organized the thirteen myriarchies of the Yuan Shakya rulers into numerous districts (), abolished Mongol law in favour of the old Tibetan legal code, and Mongol court dress in favour of traditional Tibetan dress.\n\nTai Situ Changchub Gyaltsen died in 1364 and was succeeded as by his nephew Jamyang Shakya Gyaltsen () (1340–1373), who was also a monk. The subsequent rule of the Phagmodrupa Dynasty lasted until 1435 followed by the Rinpungpa kings who ruled for four generations from 1435–1565 and the three Tsangpa kings 1566-1641.\n\nIn 1406 the ruling Phagmodrupa prince, Drakpa Gyaltsen, turned down the imperial invitation to him to visit China.\n\nFrom 1435 to 1481 the power of the Phagmodrupa declined and they were eclipsed by the Rinpungpa () of Tsang, who patronized the Karma Kagyu.\n\nThe Phagmo Drupa monastery of Dentsa Thel \"was completely destroyed during the Cultural Revolution in 1966-1978\"\n"}
{"id": "29766321", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29766321", "title": "Phenomenological description", "text": "Phenomenological description\n\nPhenomenological description is a method of phenomenology. A phenomenological description attempts to depict the structure of first person lived experience, rather than theoretically explain it. This method was first conceived of by Edmund Husserl. It was developed through the latter work of Martin Heidegger, Jean-Paul Sartre, Immanuel Levinas and Maurice Merleau-Ponty — and others. It has also been developed through recent strands of modern psychology and cognitive science.\n\nHusserl originally conceived of and developed the method of phenomenological description. A Husserlian description uncovers or discloses the structures and forms of conscious experience. A Husserlian description typically begins by describing an actual experience in the first person. For example, in \"The Phenomenology of the Consciousness of Internal Time\" Husserl describes the phenomenon of being conscious of an individual, actual tone. This description is \"a typical example of Husserl's descriptive... method\". Another good example of Husserl describing the structure of a conscious experience is his description of the act of naming his inkpot, provided in the \"Logical Investigations\".\n\nHowever, although Husserl's descriptions may begin at this basic level, they are often considerably more lengthy, involved and complex. For example, they often range from descriptions of the singular and empirical to descriptions of the essential and universal. Husserlian descriptions often depict the essential or invariant structures of conscious experience. For example, immediately after he describes the singular example of naming his inkpot in \"Logical Investigations\" he proceeds to describe the phenomenon of naming at the more general, invariant and essential level.\n\nHeidegger's explication of phenomenological description is sketched out in the Introduction to \"Being and Time.\" There he argues that the way to best approach the question of the meaning of Being is to examine the concrete ways in which phenomena show themselves in themselves — as they seem in consciousness. By examining the way phenomena immediately present themselves, we can get insight into how revealing as such occurs. For Heidegger, truth is always revealing — \"aletheia\". Important to note is that Heidegger's method of phenomenology is that it represents a new tradition of \"hermeneutic phenomenology\" as opposed to merely descriptive, as in the Husserlian tradition.\n\nSartre's \"Nausea\" gives immediate first-person accounts of the main character Antoine Roquentin's lived experience. He describes the way objects lose their meaning and nausea disturbingly creeps up on him unexpectedly. His worst encounter is in a park with a tree root, where he realizes the gift (and burden) of human freedom as compared to other non-conscious beings. Sartre vividly characterizes what appears in the foreground of Antoine's awareness, including all of the ambiguity and confusion that is usually abstracted away in traditional or realist novels.\n\nPhenomenological description has found widespread application within psychology and the cognitive sciences. For example, Maurice Merleau-Ponty is the first well known phenomenologist to openly mingle the results of empirical research with phenomenologically descriptive research. Contemporarily, diverse theorists such as Shaun Gallagher, Dieter Lohmar, Natalie Depraz and Francisco Varela fall under the broad umbrella of what's being termed \"hybrid\" theorists, drawing on both phenomenological description and research from modern cognitive science.\n\nAccording to L. Finlay (2009),\n\nPhenomenological research characteristically starts with concrete descriptions of lived situations, often first-person accounts, set down in everyday language and avoiding abstract intellectual generalizations. The researcher proceeds by reflectively analyzing these descriptions, perhaps idiographically first, then by offering a synthesized account, for example, identifying general themes about the essence of the phenomenon. Importantly, the phenomenological researcher aims to go beyond surface expressions or explicit meanings to read between the lines so as to access implicit dimensions and intuitions.\nSchmicking (2010) itemizes the aspects involved in approaching any particular phenomenon:\n\n\n"}

As proposed by Van Parijs, such freedom should be feasible through taxing the scarce, valued social good of jobs, as a form of income redistribution.\n\nAnother part of Van Parijs' work is about linguistic justice. In order to address the injustice arising from the privilege enjoyed by English as a global \"lingua franca\", he discusses a wide range of measures such as a language tax which would be paid by English-speaking countries, a ban on the dubbing of films, and the enforcement of a linguistic territoriality principle that would protect weaker languages.\n\nVan Parijs's work is sometimes associated with the September Group of analytic Marxism, though he is not himself a Marxist.\n\n\nVan Parijs' books include \"Evolutionary Explanation in the Social Sciences\" (1981), \"Le Modèle économique et ses rivaux\" (1990), \"Qu'est-ce qu'une société juste?\" (1991), \"Marxism Recycled\" (1993), \"Real Freedom for All\" (1995), \"Sauver la solidarité\" (1995), \"Refonder la solidarité\" (1996), \"Solidariteit voor de XXIste eeuw\" (1997), \"Ethique économique et sociale\" (2000, with C.

{"id": "491936", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=491936", "title": "Pilates", "text": "Pilates\n\nPilates (; ) is a physical fitness system developed in the early 20th century by Joseph Pilates, after whom it was named. Pilates called his method \"Contrology\". It is practiced worldwide, especially in Western countries such as Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom. As of 2005, there were 11 million people practicing the discipline regularly and 14,000 instructors in the United States.\n\nThere is only limited evidence to support the use of Pilates to alleviate low back pain, or improve balance in elderly people. Evidence from studies show that while Pilates improves balance, limited data exists on whether this impacts on falls by the elderly. Pilates has not been shown to be an effective treatment for any medical condition. There is some evidence regular Pilates sessions can help muscle conditioning in healthy adults, when compared to doing no exercise.\n\nIn his book \"Return to Life through Contrology\", Joseph Pilates presents his method as the art of controlled movements, which should look and feel like a workout (not a therapy) when properly manifested. If practiced with consistency, Pilates improves flexibility, builds strength and develops control and endurance in the entire body. It puts emphasis on alignment, breathing, developing a strong core, and improving coordination and balance. The core, consisting of the muscles of the abdomen, low back, and hips, is often called the \"powerhouse\" and is thought to be the key to a person's stability. Pilates' system allows for different exercises to be modified in range of difficulty from beginner to advanced or to any other level, and also in terms of the instructor and practitioner's specific goals and/or limitations. Intensity can be increased over time as the body adapts itself to the exercises.\n\nPilates was developed by Joseph Pilates, from Mönchengladbach, Germany. His father was a gymnast and his mother a naturopath. \n\nDuring the first half of the twentieth century, he developed a system of exercises which were intended to strengthen the human mind and body. Pilates believed that mental and physical health were interrelated.\n\nIn his youth he had practised many of the physical training regimes available in Germany, and it was from these he developed his own method. It has clear connections with the physical culture of the late nineteenth century, such as the use of special apparatuses and claims that the exercises could cure ill health. It is also related to the tradition of \"corrective exercise\" or \"medical gymnastics\" as typified by Pehr Henrik Ling.\n\nPilates said that the inspiration for his method came to him during World War One, while he was being held at the Knockaloe internment camp on the Isle of Man. He developed his method there for four years, working on his fellow internees . \n\nJoseph Pilates accompanied his method with a variety of equipment, for which he used the term \"apparatus\". Each apparatus was designed to help accelerate the process of stretching, strengthening, body alignment and increased core strength started by the mat work. The best-known and most popular apparatus today, the Reformer, was originally called the Universal Reformer, aptly named for \"universally reforming the body\". Eventually Pilates designed other apparatus, including the Cadillac, Wunda Chair, High \"Electric\" Chair, Spine Corrector, Ladder Barrel and Pedi-Pole.\n\nPilates published two books related to his training method: \"Your Health: A Corrective System of Exercising That Revolutionizes the Entire Field of Physical Education\" in 1934, and \"Return to Life Through Contrology\" in 1945.\n\nHis first students went on to teach his methods, including: Romana Kryzanowska, Kathy Grant, Jay Grimes, Ron Fletcher, Mary Bowen, Carola Treir, Bob Seed, Eve Gentry, Bruce King, Lolita San Miguel, and Mary Pilates, Joseph's niece. Contemporary Pilates includes both the \"Modern\" Pilates and the \"Classical/Traditional\" Pilates. Modern Pilates is partly derived from the teaching of some first generation students, while Classical Pilates aims to preserve the original work as Joseph Pilates taught it.\n\nA number of versions of Pilates are taught today and the majority are based on up to nine principles. Frank Philip Friedman and Gail Eisen, two students of Romana Kryzanowska, published the first modern book on Pilates, \"The Pilates Method of Physical and Mental Conditioning\", in 1980 and in it they outlined six \"principles of Pilates\". These have been widely adopted—and adapted—by the wider community. The original six principles were concentration, control, center, flow, precision, and breathing.\n\nBreathing is important in the Pilates method. In \"Return to Life\", Pilates devotes a section of his introduction specifically to breathing \"bodily house-cleaning with blood circulation\". He saw considerable value in increasing the intake of oxygen and the circulation of this oxygenated blood to every part of the body. This he saw as cleansing and invigorating. Proper full inhalation and complete exhalation were key to this. He advised people to squeeze out the lungs as they would wring a wet towel dry. In Pilates exercises, the practitioner breathes out with the effort and in on the return. In order to keep the lower abdominals close to the spine; the breathing needs to be directed laterally, into the lower rib cage. Pilates breathing is described as a posterior lateral breathing, meaning that the practitioner is instructed to breathe deep into the back and sides of his or her rib cage. When practitioners exhale, they are instructed to note the engagement of their deep abdominal and pelvic floor muscles and maintain this engagement as they inhale. Pilates attempts to properly coordinate this breathing practice with movement.\n\nPilates demands intense focus, the way that exercises are done is more important than the exercises themselves.\n\n\"Contrology\" was Joseph Pilates' preferred name for his method, and it was based on the idea of muscle control. All exercises are done with control, the muscles working to lift against gravity and the resistance of the springs and thereby control the movement of the body and the apparatus.\n\nFor practitioners to control their bodies, they must have a starting place: the center. The center is the focal point of the Pilates method. Many Pilates teachers refer to the group of muscles in the center of the body—encompassing the abdomen, lower and upper back, hips, buttocks, and inner thighs—as the \"powerhouse\". All movement in Pilates should begin from the center and move outward to the limbs.\n\nPilates aims for elegant economy of movement, creating flow through the use of appropriate transitions. Once precision has been achieved, the exercises are intended to flow within and into each other in order to build strength and stamina. In other words, the Pilates technique asserts that physical energy exerted from the center should coordinate movements of the extremities.\n\nUsing correct posture while doing Pilates exercises improves safety by correcting muscle imbalances and optimizing coordination.\n\nPrecision is essential to correct Pilates. The focus is on doing one precise and perfect movement, rather than many halfhearted ones. Here Pilates reflects common physical culture wisdom, gaining more from a few energetic efforts than from many listless ones. The goal is for this precision to eventually become second nature and carry over into everyday life as grace and economy of movement.\n\nCorrect muscle firing patterns and improved mental concentration are enhanced with relaxation.\n\nWith increased precision, motion becomes more efficient so there is less stress to perform the exercises.\n\nIn 2015 the Australian Government's Department of Health published a meta study which reviewed the existing literature on 17 alternative therapies including Pilates, in order to determine if any were suitable for being covered by health insurance. The review found that due to the small number and methodologically limited nature of the existing studies, the effectiveness of Pilates is uncertain. Accordingly In 2017 the Australian government named Pilates as a practice that would not qualify for insurance subsidy, saying this step would \"ensure taxpayer funds are expended appropriately and not directed to therapies lacking evidence\".\n\nFor the treatment of lower back pain, low quality evidence suggests that while Pilates is better than doing nothing, it is no more effective than other forms of physical exercise. There is some evidence regular sessions can help with the conditioning of the abdominal muscles of healthy people, when compared to doing no exercise. There is no good evidence it helps improve balance in elderly people.\n\nPilates is an unregulated method of exercise.\n\nIn October 2000 \"Pilates\" was ruled a generic term by a U.S. federal court, making it free for unrestricted use.\n\nAs a result of the court ruling, the Pilates Method Alliance was formed as a professional association for the Pilates community. Its purpose was to provide an international organization to connect teachers, teacher trainers, studios, and facilities dedicated to preserving and enhancing the legacy of Joseph H. Pilates and his exercise method by establishing standards, encouraging unity, and promoting professionalism.\n\n"}

{"id": "3305409", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3305409", "title": "Sant Mat", "text": "Sant Mat\n\nSant Mat was a spiritual movement that gained some importance in the Indian subcontinent in the 13th century CE. The name literally means \"teachings of sants\", i.e. mystic saints. By association and seeking truth by following \"sants\" and their teachings, a movement was formed. Theologically, the teachings are distinguished by inward, loving devotion by the individual soul (\"atma\") to the Divine Principal God (\"Parmatma\"). Socially, an egalitarian understanding stands separate from qualitative distinctions of the Hindu caste system, and to those between Hindus and Muslims.\n\nThe lineage of \"sants\" can be divided into two main groups: a northern group from the provinces of Punjab, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, who expressed themselves mainly in vernacular Hindi; and a southern group, whose language is archaic Marathi, represented by Namdev and other sants of Maharashtra.\n\nThe expression \"Sant Mat\" literally means \"Teachings of the Saints\" – the \"Path of Sants (Saints)\", \"Path of Truth\", \"Right or Positive Path\". As \"point of view of the Sants\", the term \"Sant\" is pivotal. Derived from the Sanskrit \"sat\" () and has overlapping usages (true, real, honest, right). Its root meaning is \"one who knows(is) the truth\" or \"one who has experienced (merged into) Ultimate Reality.\" The term \"sant\" has taken on the general meaning of \"a good person\" but is properly assigned to the poet-sants of medieval India.\n\nThe Sant Mat movement was not homogeneous, and consisted mostly of the \"sants\" own socio-religious attitudes, which were based on \"bhakti\" (devotion) as described in the Bhagavad Gita. Sharing as few conventions with each other as with the followers of the traditions they challenged, the \"sants\" appear more as a diverse collection of spiritual personalities than a specific religious tradition, although they acknowledged a common spiritual root.\n\nThe boundaries of the movement were likely not sectarian and were devoid of Brahmin concepts of caste and liturgy. The poet-sants expressed their teaching in vernacular verse, addressing themselves to the common folk in oral style in Hindi and other dialects such as Marathi. They referred to the \"Divine Name\" as having saving power, and dismissed the religious rituals as having no value. They presented the idea that true religion was a matter of surrendering to God \"who dwells in the heart\".\n\nThe first generation of north Indian \"sants\", (which included Kabir and Ravidas), appeared in the region of Benares in the mid–15th century. Preceding them were two notable 13th and 14th century figures, Namdev and Ramananda. The latter, according to Sant Mat tradition, was a Vaishnava ascetic who initiated Kabir, Ravidas, and other sants. Ramanand's story is told differently by his lineage of \"Ramanandi\" monks, by other \"sants\" preceding him, and later by the Sikhs. What is known is that Ramananda accepted students of all castes, a practice that was contested by the orthodox Hindus of that time. Sant Mat practitioners accept that Ramananda's students formed the first generation of \"sants\".\n\n\"Sants\" developed a culture of being close to marginalized humans in society including women, and the untouchables (\"Atishudras\"). Some of the more notable \"sants\" include Namdev (d. 1350), Kabir (d. 1518), Nanak (d. 1539), Mira Bai (d. 1545), Surdas (d. 1573), Tulsidas (d. 1623), and Tukaram (d. 1650).\n\nThe tradition of the \"sants\" (\"sant parampara\") remained non-sectarian, although a number of \"sant\" poets have been considered as the founders of sects. Some of these may bear the \"sant's\" name, but were developed after them by later followers such as Kabir Panth, Dadu Panth, Dariya Panth, Advait Mat, Science of Spirituality and Radhasoami.\n\nOnly a small minority of religious Hindus have formally followed Sant Mat, but the tradition has considerably influenced Hindus across sects and castes. Bhajans (devotional songs) attributed to past \"sants\" such as Mira Bai are widely listened to in India and in Hindu communities around the world. The \"sant\" tradition is the only one in medieval and modern India that has successfully crossed some barriers between Hindu and Muslim blocks. Julius J. Lipner asserts that the lives of many Hindus have been leavened by the religious teachings of the \"sants\", which he describes as liberating.\n\nThe Sant Mat tradition refers to the necessity of a living human master, which is referred to with honorific titles such as \"satguru\", or perfect master.\n\nClassical Gnostics, medieval Sufi poets such as Shams Tabrizi, Jalal al-Din Muhammad Rumi or Hafez, as well as Sindhi poets, are considered to have many similarities with the poet-sants of Sant Mat.\n\nThe Radha Soami movement in North India is regarded as a repository of the tradition of the Sants and their teachings, as well as their approach to religious endeavours, and presents itself as a living incarnation of the Sant tradition. The most notable being Radhasoami Satsang Beas, situated on the banks of the river Beas, whose current living master is Gurinder Singh. According to Mark Juergensmeyer, that claim is also made by the Kabir-panthis, the Satpanthis, the Sikhs and other movements that continue to find the insights from the Sant tradition valid today.\n\nPrem Rawat and the Divine Light Mission (Elan Vital) are considered to be part of the Sant Mat tradition by J. Gordon Melton, Lucy DuPertuis, and Vishal Mangalwadi, but that characterization is disputed by Ron Geaves. The 20th century religious movement Eckankar is also considered by David C. Lane to be an offshoot of the Sant Mat tradition. James R. Lewis refers to these movements as \"expressions of an older faith in a new context\".\n\n\n"}

The family provided Orthodox priests for six generations, beginning in the sixteenth century with his ancestor Bulgak, a Tatar. Metropolitan Macarius Bulgakov (1816-1882), one of the major Eastern Orthodox theologians of his days, and one of the most important Russian church historians, was a distant relative.\n\nHe studied at Orel seminary, then at Yelets gimnasium. In 1894 he graduated from the Law School of Moscow University, where he had also undertaken a serious study of political economy.\n\nDuring his study at the seminary Bulgakov became interested in Marxism and took part in the Legal Marxism movement. Under the influence of works of Russian religious thinkers (Leo Tolstoy, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Vladimir Solovyov, etc.), in the course of his meetings and arguments with Leo Tolstoy he found his religious beliefs again. He wrote a book about his evolution (Sergey Bulgakov, \"From Marxism to Idealism\", 1903). Such an evolution was common for the Russian intelligentsia of the time, and he soon became one of their recognised ideologists. A primary contributor to the books \"Problems of Idealism\" (1902), \"Vekhi\", \"Problems of Religion\", \"About Vladimir Solovyev\", \"About the Religion of Leo Tolstoy\", \"The Religion of Solovyov's Philosophical Society\", he participated in the journals \"New Way\" (Новый Путь) and \"Questions of Life\" (Вопросы Жизни). He was a leader of the publisher \"Way\" (Путь, 1911–1917), where he printed many important works of contemporary Orthodox theology.\n\nIn 1907 he was elected as an independent \"Christian Socialist\" to the Second Duma. He published the important original monographs \"Philosophy of Economy\" («Философия хозяйства» 1912) and \"Unfading Light\" («Свет Невечерний» 1917), in which he first offered his own teaching based on the combination of \"sophiology\" of Vladimir Solovyov and Pavel Florensky, the later works of Schelling, and his own intuition-based ideas about the Orthodox Christian faith.\n\nIn 1918, having returned to the Orthodox Church, he was ordained to the priesthood, and rose to prominence in church circles. He took part in the All-Russia Sobor of the Russian Orthodox Church that elected patriarch Tikhon of Moscow. Bulgakov rejected the October revolution and responded with \"On the Feast of the Gods\" (\"На пиру богов\", 1918), a book similar to the \"Three Talks\" of Vladimir Solovyov.\n\nDuring the Russian Civil War he was in Crimea, where he worked in the field of philosophy. He wrote books \"Philosophy of the Name\" ( \"Философия имени\", 1920) and \"Tragedy of Philosophy\" (\"Трагедия философии\", 1920) in which he revised his views about the relation of Philosophy to Dogmatism. He concluded that the Christian views can be expressed only by dogmatic theology. Thereafter his works were devoted to dogmatic theology.\n\nOn 30 December 1922 the Bolshevik government expelled some 160 prominent intellectuals on the so-called Philosophers' ship, Bulgakov, Nikolai Berdyaev, and Ivan Ilyin among them.\n\nIn May 1923 he became professor of Church Law and Theology at the school of law of the \"Russian Research Institute\" in Prague.\n\nIn 1925 he helped found St. Sergius Orthodox Theological Institute (\"l'Institut de Théologie Orthodoxe Saint-Serge\"), in Paris, France. He was the head of this institute and Professor of Dogmatic Theology until his death from throat cancer on 12 July 1944. His last work was devoted to the Apocalypse.\n\nBulgakov’s teaching on sophiology is highly controversial. The attempt to understand it properly is hindered by the highly political controversy surrounding it in the 1930s.\n\nBy 1931, there were three separate Russian Orthodox jurisdictions in Europe: the Russian Church Abroad/Sremski Karlovtsy Synod (ROCA or ROCOR), under Met. Anthony (Khrapovitsky); \"Patriarchal\" Church, answering ultimately to Met. Sergius I of Moscow and had the young Vladimir Lossky as a member and the Russian Church in Western Europe, Bulgakov’s own jurisdiction as well as the church of Georges Florovsky, under Met. Evlogy (Georgievsky), under the jurisdiction of the Patriarch of Constantinople, in 1934, Met. Evlogy was privately reconciled to Met. Anthony, and in 1935, he went to Karlovtsy for a special reunion conference at which time the schism between him and ROCOR was healed. In 1936, Met. Evlogy again cut his ties with ROCOR, quite possibly because of the controversy over Sophianism.\n\nIn the Decree on Sophianism, an ukaz of 24 August 1935 of Met. Sergius, Bulgakov’s teaching on ‘Sophia’ was described as ‘alien’ to the Orthodox faith. This ukaz was largely based on the epistolary reports of Alexis Stavrovsky. He was also the president of the Brotherhood of St Photius (Alexis Stavrovskii was president; Vladimir Lossky, the vice-president, and Evgraf Kovalevskii, later Jean-Nectaire Kovalevsky of Saint-Denis, were also among the 12-15 young laymen who made up its numbers) whose members had left the jurisdiction of Metropolitan Evlogy for that of Met. Elevthery of Lithuania. This exodus was in reaction to Met. Sergius having removed, on 10 June 1930, Met. Evlogy as the head of the Russian Orthodox Church in Western Europe (since Metropolitan Evlogy had continually refused to agree to the 30 June 1927 Declaration of Loyalty to the Soviet government) and named Elevthery as his replacement. In late 1935, Metropolitan Evlogy appointed a commission to look into the charges of heresy levelled against Bulgakov.\n\nThe commission quickly broke into factions. In June 1936 the majority report (prepared by Vasilii Zenkovskii, Anton Kartashov and others) rejected the charge of heresy but had serious objections about Sophiology. The minority report of 6 July 1936 was prepared by Fr Sergei Chetverikov and signed by Fr Georges Florovsky, who despite his personal respect for Fr. Sergius, remained an ardent critic of Sophianism for the remainder of his life. Meanwhile, the Church Abroad formally accused Bulgakov of heresy in 1935.\n\nThe 1935 decision of the Church Abroad was based on Archbishop Seraphim (Sobolev) of Boguchar’s \"Novoe uchenie o Sofii\" (Sofia, 1935), as well as on the arguments of St. John (Maximovitch). St. John, in his book \"The Orthodox Veneration of the Mother of God\", discusses at length why the sophianism of Sergius Bulgakov is heresy, specifically one as destructive as Nestorianism. Speaking of those who attempt to deify the Theotokos, he wrote: \nBulgakov responded to the heresy accusation in his \"Dokladnaia zapiska Mitropolitu Evlogiiu prof. prot. Sergiia Bulgakova\" (Paris, 1936). Archbishop Seraphim then rebutted Bulgakov in his \"Zashchita sofianskoi eresi\" (Sofia, 1937). No final report was prepared on the sophiology controversy by the commission set up by Bulgakov's own jurisdiction. However, Metropolitan Evlogy convoked a bishops' conference on 26–29 November 1937 to bring closure to the matter. The bishops in their statement were working from reports by Archimandrite Cassian (Bezobrazov) and Chetverikov and they concluded that the accusations of heresy against Bulgakov were unfounded but that his theological opinions showed serious flaws and needed correction.\n\nBulgakov in some respects sympathized with the doctrine of universal reconciliation, with the reservation that the continuing punishment of the immortal souls of the wicked in hell may be unending since human free choice can never be destroyed.\n\nThere is conflict in the studies regarding how conservative Bulgakov was. A classmate of Bulgakov's said he had been called a \"jingoistic monarchist\" and that he did not attend discussion groups. Together with Petr Struve, Bulgakov founded the illegal liberal Union of Liberation (which later emerged as the Constitutional Democratic (Kadet) Party, the largest party in Russia between 1906–1907), and was one of the key persons in the journal \"Liberation\" (1902–1905). Because of the circle's secularism, which conflicted with Bulgakov's religious views, he left the society to join the liberal nationalist and socio-Christian Union of Christian Politics. When that circle was dissolved Bulgakov was more active in the Orthodoxy, so his leanings became liberal conservative.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Taoism is similar to Shinto in that it also started as an indigenous religion in China, although it is more hermetic than shamanistic. Taoism's influence can be seen throughout the culture but to a lesser extent than Confucianism.\n\nTaoism in the form it takes in Japan can be easily seen as superstitious or astrological and the concept of demons and spirits seem to have their roots in a Taoist influence such as Onmyōdō and Shugendō. The widely practiced ritual of \"setsubun\" (節分) where chanters repeat \"Demons out! Luck in!\" has its base in Taoism and also touches on a relation to \"uchi-soto\". There is a culture of consultation where \"ogamiyasan\" are called upon to provide their Taoism based insight to bear upon events such as house-buildings. Taoism has a calendar whereby one can determine the best day, element and time should be chosen to color an event in the right light (Tengenjutsu (fortune telling)).\n\nThe Japanese \"kanji\" for Taoism is 道教 (Dô-kyô). The root of this \"kanji\" is 道 (\"michi\", way, path) + 教 (\"kyō\", doctrine, teaching, education). \"Dô\" shares the same Chinese character as \"tao\", 道 which literally means \"way\".\n\nAccording to a tale from the \"Nihon Shoki\", a man named Tajima Mori set out to explore for the elixir of immortality and reached the Eternal Land, where he brought back the “fragrant fruit” to offer to his ruler; the latter turned out to be already dead so Tajima Mori followed suit. “Scholars have identified it as the immortals’ isles of \"Penglai\", and the ‘fragrant fruit’ as the mandarin orange\".\n\nThe legal system of China was brought to Japan in the late 7th and early 8th centuries, specifically a Bureau of \"yin\" and \"yang\", the \"Ommyokan\", to handle affairs of time keeping, astronomy, dream interpretation and calendar calculation and \"yin-yang\" and the Five Phases cosmology. By the 10th century, it developed with rituals to cast away unlucky tendencies and this became known as the religious practice in Japan called \"inyodo\" or \"yin-yang\" divination.\n\nTaoism also influenced \"Shugendo\", Japan’s shamanistic and mountain worship. It began in the 7th century and combined Buddhism, \"yin-yang\" divination, Shinto and Taoist elements. One spell of Taoistic influence is the “Come down, soldiers and fighters, and line up before me!” which is used to enter a holy mountain on certain days. Another ritual formula evident of Taoism is the “Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances!” which can be seen in banners, talismans and roof tiles even today in Japan.\n\nTaoist influences made their way even to Shinto, specifically Ise and Yoshida Shintō, both of which developed in Kamakura in 1281. Shinto became one of Japan’s political doctrines in the early 20th century, known as the State Shinto. In 1950, the Society for the Research of Daoism was founded. In 1951, the Society published its first journal.\n\nOne of the Taoist practices in Japan is the \"Kōshin\" religion. \"Koshin\" refers to the 57th day of the 60-day calendar cycle, where three worms bringing death from the human body go to report of people’s sins in heaven. The worms then go back to the human body and shorten the people’s lifespan by causing illnesses and unhappiness. To avoid this, the Taoists stays awake the whole day and night and perform rituals. “The Koshin cult is the most obvious and best known instance of Taoism in Japan” \n\n"}

{"id": "3859907", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3859907", "title": "Veritatis splendor", "text": "Veritatis splendor\n\nVeritatis splendor (Latin: \"The Splendor of the Truth\") is an encyclical by Pope John Paul II. It expresses the position of the Catholic Church regarding fundamentals of the Church's role in moral teaching. The encyclical is one of the most comprehensive and philosophical teachings of moral theology in the Catholic tradition. It was promulgated on 6 August 1993. Cardinal Georges Cottier, Theologian emeritus of the Pontifical Household and Cardinal-Deacon of \"Santi Domenico e Sisto\" the University Church of the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas was influential in drafting the encyclical, as was Servais-Théodore Pinckaers a professor of moral theology at the University of Fribourg.\n\n\"Veritatis splendor\" responds to questions of moral theology that had been raised during the postconciliar period of the Church (events after the Vatican II ecumenical council of 1962-65). These questions revolve around man's ability to discern good, the existence of evil, the role of human freedom and human conscience, mortal sin, and the authority of the magisterium of the Catholic Church in guiding man. In response to these, Pope John Paul II emphatically says that moral truth is knowable, that the choice of good or evil has a profound effect on one's relationship with God, and that there is no true contradiction between freedom and following the good. \"Veritatis splendor\" consists of three chapters: (I) Teacher, What Good Must I Do; (II) Do Not Be Conformed to this World; and (III) Lest the Cross of Christ be Emptied of its Power.\n\n\"Veritatis splendor\" begins by asserting that there are indeed absolute truths accessible to all persons. Contrary to the philosophy of moral relativism, the encyclical says that moral law is universal across people in varying cultures, and is in fact rooted in the human condition. Pope John Paul teaches that no matter how separated someone is from God, \"in the depths of his heart there always remains a yearning for absolute truth and a thirst to attain full knowledge of it.\" He goes on to say that the splendor of truth \"shines forth deep within the human spirit.\"\n\nUltimately, John Paul teaches, \"to ask about the good, in fact, ultimately means to turn towards God, the fullness of goodness.\" Against the idea that the Church's teaching body has a mainly exhortatory role, the pope reiterates the Catholic doctrine that the magisterium of the Catholic Church has authority to definitively pronounce on moral questions. Even more, John Paul teaches that the Church is Christ's particular response to help answer everyone's question of what is right and wrong.\n\nJohn Paul teaches that there is no true conflict between human freedom and God's law. The true end of human freedom is growth as a mature person into how each is created by God. Furthermore, God's divine law governing human behavior is not opposed to human freedom, but rather \"it protects and promotes that freedom.\"\n\nThe encyclical affirms that today's respect for human freedom \"represents one of the positive achievements of modern culture.\" However, he cautions, though it is a good, human freedom is not in itself an absolute. Merely deciding for oneself that one may do something is not at all a true substitute for determining whether something is in fact good or bad. Because God is the true author of good, it remains of critical importance to understand how the divine Law, as expressed by the authoritative magisterium of the Church, considers an issue before determining absolutely for oneself.\n\nThe pope welcomes and supports the role of human reason in discovering and applying the natural law (those aspects of the moral law that may be discovered without divine revelation). Nevertheless, because God remains the true author of moral law, he states that human reason will not properly supersede the elements of the moral law that are of divine origin—the encyclical states that this \"would be the death of true freedom.\" In particular, John Paul denies those ideas of morality that treat the human body as a \"raw datum,\" separating man and how he uses his body from his greater meaning derived from the entirety of his person.\n\nJohn Paul reiterates the longstanding Catholic teaching that people are obliged to follow their conscience, and that if they do not, they are condemned by their own conscience.\n\nJohn Paul depicts conscience as a form of inner dialogue. However, he says, it is not merely a dialogue of a man with himself, but it is very much a dialogue between man and God. Following Bonaventure, John Paul likens conscience to a herald from God who proclaims the divine law. In opposition to how it is often represented elsewhere, John Paul says that conscience is emphatically not a replacement for the divine law. Rather, it is the process by which a person may apply the divinely revealed law to the concrete situation at hand.\n\n\"Veritatis splendor\" states that because conscience may err in its judgment, a person is obliged to do his best to inform his conscience. Hence, it remains crucial for a person to make an effort to understand what the divine law on a matter is, as expressed by the Church, and the reasons behind it. Even if a person is not condemned by his conscience for a morally wrong act, committing that act nevertheless causes damage in other ways, and if done habitually it can progressively make it harder for a person to perceive the truth. Furthermore, habitual sin enslaves us, so following a wrong judgment of conscience is in the end a step away from freedom.\n\nThe encyclical also responds to the idea of the \"fundamental option.\" In this way of thinking, a man's particular actions do not necessarily affect his ultimate salvation—what is important is his fundamental orientation towards or against God. The pope writes:\n\n\"There is no doubt that Christian moral teaching, even in its Biblical roots, acknowledges the specific importance of a fundamental choice which qualifies the moral life and engages freedom on a radical level before God. It is a question of the decision of faith, of the obedience of faith (cf. Rom 16:26) \"by which man makes a total and free self-commitment to God, offering 'the full submission of intellect and will to God as he reveals' \".\"\n\nJohn Paul firmly opposes the theological assertion that such a fundamental choice can be separated from particular actions, stating that it is contrary to Scripture as well as to long-held Catholic teaching on sin and salvation. He also opposes it on philosophical grounds, writing, \"To separate the fundamental option from concrete kinds of behaviour means to contradict the substantial integrity or personal unity of the moral agent in his body and in his soul.\"\n\nJohn Paul emphasizes that the \"fundamental option\" view undermines the traditional Catholic understanding on mortal sin and venial sin, their distinction, and effects: \"For mortal sin exists also when a person knowingly and willingly, for whatever reason, chooses something gravely disordered... The person turns away from God and loses charity.\"\n\nThe encyclical also says that certain acts are intrinsically evil. In the language of Catholic moral theology, this means that certain acts are always wrong, and that there are never circumstances in which they may be permitted if done knowingly and intentionally. Stated another way, this is a strong support for the long-held doctrine of Catholic moral theology that \"the ends do not justify the means.\" John Paul bases this on the argument that certain acts are so destructive to the human person that there are no extenuating circumstances that would allow them. As an example, John Paul specifically mentions the teaching of Pope Paul VI on contraception, which stipulates that although it is permissible to tolerate a lesser evil to prevent a greater one, or to promote a greater good, it is never permissible, even in the gravest of circumstances to intentionally do an evil so that good may come of it. Or in other words it is never permissible to intend directly something which contradicts a moral order. This reiterates Paul VI's teaching on contraception, and that if an act is intrinsically evil, a good intention or particular circumstances can diminish their evil, but they cannot remove it.\n\nJohn Paul teaches that man can and must respect the norm of morality even in the most difficult situations: \"Temptations can be overcome, sins can be avoided, because together with the commandments the Lord gives us the possibility of keeping them.\" He rejected the proposition that the Church's teaching is essentially only an \"ideal\" which must then be adapted to each case.\n\n\n\n"}

In 1996 and 2000, she ran for Vice President as the nominee of the Green Party of the United States, on a ticket headed by Ralph Nader.\n\nShe is the executive director of Honor the Earth, a Native environmental advocacy organization that plays an active role in the Dakota Access Pipeline protests.\n\nWinona (meaning \"first daughter\" in Dakota language) LaDuke was born in 1959 in Los Angeles, California, to Betty Bernstein and Vincent LaDuke (later known as Sun Bear). Her father was from the Ojibwe White Earth Reservation in Minnesota, and her mother of Jewish European ancestry from the Bronx, New York. Though LaDuke spent some of her childhood in Los Angeles, she was primarily raised in Ashland, Oregon. Due to her father's heritage, she was enrolled with the Ojibwe Nation at an early age, but she did not live at White Earth, or on any other reservation, until 1982. She started work at White Earth after she graduated college, when she got a job there as principal of the high school.\n\nAfter her parents married, Vincent LaDuke worked as an actor in Hollywood, with supporting roles in Western movies, while Betty LaDuke completed her academic studies. The couple separated when Winona was five, and her mother took a position as an art instructor at Southern Oregon College, now Southern Oregon University at Ashland, which was then a small logging and college town near the California border. In the 1980s, LaDuke's father Vincent reinvented himself as a New Age spiritual leader and went by the name Sun Bear.\n\nWhile growing up in Ashland, LaDuke attended public school and was on the debate team in high school. She attended Harvard University, where she became part of a larger group of Indian activists, and graduated in 1982 with a Bachelor of Arts in Economics (rural economic development). When LaDuke moved to White Earth she did not know the Ojibwe language, or many people, and was not quickly accepted. While working as the principal of the local Minnesota reservation high school she completed research for her master's thesis on the reservation's subsistence economy and became involved in local issues. She completed an M.A. in Community Economic Development through the distance-learning program of Antioch University.\n\nWhile working as a principal at the high school, LaDuke became an activist. In 1985 she helped found the Indigenous Women's Network. She worked with Women of All Red Nations to publicize American forced sterilization of Native American women.\n\nNext she became involved in the struggle to recover lands for the Anishinaabe. An 1867 treaty with the United States had originally provided a territory of more than 860,000 acres for the White Earth Indian Reservation. Under the Nelson Act of 1889, an attempt to have the Anishinaabe assimilate by adopting a European-American model of subsistence farming, communal tribal land had been allotted to individual households. The US classified any land in excess as surplus, allowing it to be sold to non-natives. In addition, many Anishinaabe sold their land individually over the years; these elements resulted in the tribe's losing control of most of its land. By the mid-20th century, the tribe held only one-tenth of the land within its reservation.\n\nIn 1989, LaDuke founded the White Earth Land Recovery Project (WELRP) in Minnesota with the proceeds of a human rights award from Reebok. The goal is to buy back land within the reservation that had been bought by non-Natives and to create enterprises that provide work to Anishinaabe. By 2000, the foundation had bought 1200 acres, which it held in a conservation trust for eventual cession to the tribe.\n\nThe non-profit is also working to reforest the lands and a revive cultivation of wild rice, long a traditional food. It markets that and other traditional products, including hominy, jam, buffalo sausage and other products. It has started an Ojibwe language program, a herd of buffalo, and a wind-energy project.\n\nLaDuke is also Executive Director of Honor the Earth, an organization she co-founded with the non-Native folk-rock duo, the Indigo Girls in 1993. The organization's mission is:\n\"to create awareness and support for Native environmental issues and to develop needed financial and political resources for the survival of sustainable Native communities. Honor the Earth develops these resources by using music, the arts, the media, and Indigenous wisdom to ask people to recognize our joint dependency on the Earth and be a voice for those not heard\".\n\nLaDuke was selected by The Evergreen State College Class of 2014 to be a keynote speaker and delivered her address at the school's graduation on June 13, 2014.\n\nIn 2016, LaDuke was involved in the Dakota Access Pipeline protests, participating at the resistance camps in North Dakota as well as speaking to the media on the issue.\n\nIn 1996 and 2000, LaDuke ran as the vice-presidential candidate with Ralph Nader on the Green Party ticket. She was not endorsed by any tribal council or other tribal government. LaDuke endorsed the Democratic Party ticket for the president and vice-president in 2004, 2008, and 2012.\n\nIn 2016, Robert Satiacum, Jr., a faithless elector from Washington cast his presidential vote for Native American activist, Faith Spotted Eagle; he then cast his vote for Vice President for Winona LaDuke, making her the first Native American woman to receive an Electoral College vote for Vice President.\n\nWELRP has worked to revive cultivation and harvesting of wild rice, a traditional food of the Ojibwe people. It produces and sells traditional foods and crafts through its label, Native Harvest.\n\nHonor the Earth is a national advocacy group encouraging public support and funding for Native environmental groups. With Honor the Earth, Winona works nationally and internationally on issues of climate change, renewable energy, sustainable development, food systems and environmental justice. Members of Honor the Earth are active in the Dakota Access Pipeline protests.\n\nLaDuke has begun a 40 acre industrial hemp farm in Minnesota on the White Earth Indian Reservation, dedicated to growing hemp from different regions of the world, in addition to vegetables and tobacco. LaDuke has advocated for the growth of both marijuana and industrial hemp on tribal lands as moneymaking opportunities for tribal communities; this position is controversial, however, as when the Oglala Sioux Tribe attempted this they were raided by the DEA.\n\nLaDuke has authored many books:\n\nShe has also co-written several other books including:\n\nLaDuke's editorials and essays have been published in national and international media.\n\nTelevision and film appearances:\n\n\nLaDuke married Randy Kapashesit, a Cree leader, when working in opposition to a major hydroelectric project near Moose Factory, Ontario. They had two children together: a daughter Waseyabin (born 1988) and a son Ajuawak (born 1991). They divorced after several years.\n\nLaDuke's current partner is Kevin Gasco. They had a child in 1999. She has also cared for a niece and nephew for an extended period. She and Gasco share her grandchildren.\n\nOn November 9, 2008, LaDuke's house in Ponsford, Minnesota, burned down while she was in Boston. No one was injured, but all of LaDuke's personal property burned, including her extensive library and indigenous art and artifact collection.\n\n\n\n"}

In other words, objectivity is a myth because there is no such thing as pure, objective fact. Consequently, an analysis is necessary to understand how to interpret these 'facts.' Pepper does so by developing the \"[root metaphor method, ...] and outlines what he considers to be four basically adequate world hypotheses (world views or conceptual systems): formism, mechanism, contextualism, and organicism.\" He identifies the strengths and weaknesses of each of the world hypotheses as well as the paradoxical and sometimes mystifying effects of the effort to synthesize them.\n\nPepper begins by demonstrating the very weak positions of utter skepticism and dogmatism while explaining that each are essentially two sides of the same coin. He has no problem with relative skepticism, where one suspends belief until justification is provided. But utter skepticism is essentially a dogmatist who doubts all things, always. Pepper defines a dogmatist \"as one whose belief exceeds his cognitive grounds for belief.\" If neither position of utter skepticism and dogmatism are cognitively justifiable, then knowledge about the world will be somewhere in between. Specifically, between Common Sense and Refined Knowledge.\n\nThere is a tension between Common Sense and Refined Knowledge. Common sense is ubiquitous and ever present, and therefore gives a strong sense of certainty. But once you reflect upon common sense, it is no longer common sense and has moved into the realm of refined knowledge. To a large extent, the philosophy of science, and science in general, is interested in this shift.\n\nOnce you embark into refined knowledge, there are certain criteria as to what constitutes 'evidence.' In other words, there are rules governing how we know what we know (This should be recognized as an epistemological concept). And depending on the choice of your Root Metaphor (described below), different criteria exist as to what constitutes good evidence.\n\nPepper presents two types of World Hypotheses.\n\nInadequate Hypotheses\n\n(Relatively) adequate Hypotheses\n\n\n"}
