{"id": "1814", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1814", "title": "Adam Smith", "text": "Adam Smith\n\nAdam Smith ( 1723 – 17 July 1790) was a Scottish economist, philosopher and author as well as a moral philosopher, a pioneer of political economy and a key figure during the Scottish Enlightenment. Smith is best known for two classic works, \"The Theory of Moral Sentiments\" (1759) and \"An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations\" (1776). The latter, often abbreviated as \"The Wealth of Nations\", is considered his \"magnum opus\" and the first modern work of economics.\n\nSmith studied social philosophy at the University of Glasgow and at Balliol College, Oxford, where he was one of the first students to benefit from scholarships set up by fellow Scot John Snell. After graduating, he delivered a successful series of public lectures at Edinburgh, leading him to collaborate with David Hume during the Scottish Enlightenment. Smith obtained a professorship at Glasgow, teaching moral philosophy and during this time, wrote and published \"The Theory of Moral Sentiments\". In his later life, he took a tutoring position that allowed him to travel throughout Europe, where he met other intellectual leaders of his day.\n\nSmith laid the foundations of classical free market economic theory. \"The Wealth of Nations\" was a precursor to the modern academic discipline of economics. In this and other works, he developed the concept of division of labour and expounded upon how rational self-interest and competition can lead to economic prosperity. Smith was controversial in his own day and his general approach and writing style were often satirised by Tory writers in the moralising tradition of William Hogarth and Jonathan Swift. In 2005, \"The Wealth of Nations\" was named among the 100 best Scottish books of all time.\n\nSmith was born in Kirkcaldy, in the County of Fife, Scotland. His father, also Adam Smith, was a Scottish Writer to the Signet (senior solicitor), advocate and prosecutor (judge advocate) and also served as comptroller of the customs in Kirkcaldy. In 1720, he married Margaret Douglas, daughter of the landed Robert Douglas of Strathendry, also in Fife. His father died two months after he was born, leaving his mother a widow. The date of Smith's baptism into the Church of Scotland at Kirkcaldy was 5 June 1723 and this has often been treated as if it were also his date of birth, which is unknown. Although few events in Smith's early childhood are known, the Scottish journalist John Rae, Smith's biographer, recorded that Smith was abducted by gypsies at the age of three and released when others went to rescue him. Smith was close to his mother, who probably encouraged him to pursue his scholarly ambitions. He attended the Burgh School of Kirkcaldy—characterised by Rae as \"one of the best secondary schools of Scotland at that period\"—from 1729 to 1737, he learned Latin, mathematics, history, and writing.\n\nSmith entered the University of Glasgow when he was 14 and studied moral philosophy under Francis Hutcheson. Here, Smith developed his passion for liberty, reason, and free speech. In 1740, Smith was the graduate scholar presented to undertake postgraduate studies at Balliol College, Oxford, under the Snell Exhibition.\n\nSmith considered the teaching at Glasgow to be far superior to that at Oxford, which he found intellectually stifling. In Book V, Chapter II of \"The Wealth of Nations\", Smith wrote: \"In the University of Oxford, the greater part of the public professors have, for these many years, given up altogether even the pretence of teaching.\"\nSmith is also reported to have complained to friends that Oxford officials once discovered him reading a copy of David Hume's \"A Treatise of Human Nature\", and they subsequently confiscated his book and punished him severely for reading it. According to William Robert Scott, \"The Oxford of [Smith's] time gave little if any help towards what was to be his lifework.\" Nevertheless, Smith took the opportunity while at Oxford to teach himself several subjects by reading many books from the shelves of the large Bodleian Library. When Smith was not studying on his own, his time at Oxford was not a happy one, according to his letters. Near the end of his time there, Smith began suffering from shaking fits, probably the symptoms of a nervous breakdown. He left Oxford University in 1746, before his scholarship ended.\n\nIn Book V of \"The Wealth of Nations\", Smith comments on the low quality of instruction and the meager intellectual activity at English universities, when compared to their Scottish counterparts. He attributes this both to the rich endowments of the colleges at Oxford and Cambridge, which made the income of professors independent of their ability to attract students, and to the fact that distinguished men of letters could make an even more comfortable living as ministers of the Church of England.\n\nSmith's discontent at Oxford might be in part due to the absence of his beloved teacher in Glasgow, Francis Hutcheson, who was well regarded as one of the most prominent lecturers at the University of Glasgow in his day and earned the approbation of students, colleagues, and even ordinary residents with the fervor and earnestness of his orations (which he sometimes opened to the public). His lectures endeavoured not merely to teach philosophy, but also to make his students embody that philosophy in their lives, appropriately acquiring the epithet, the preacher of philosophy. Unlike Smith, Hutcheson was not a system builder; rather, his magnetic personality and method of lecturing so influenced his students and caused the greatest of those to reverentially refer to him as \"the never to be forgotten Hutcheson\"—a title that Smith in all his correspondence used to describe only two people, his good friend David Hume and influential mentor Francis Hutcheson.\nSmith began delivering public lectures in 1748 in Edinburgh, sponsored by the Philosophical Society of Edinburgh under the patronage of Lord Kames. His lecture topics included rhetoric and \"belles-lettres\", and later the subject of \"the progress of opulence\". On this latter topic, he first expounded his economic philosophy of \"the obvious and simple system of natural liberty\". While Smith was not adept at public speaking, his lectures met with success.\n\nIn 1750, Smith met the philosopher David Hume, who was his senior by more than a decade. In their writings covering history, politics, philosophy, economics, and religion, Smith and Hume shared closer intellectual and personal bonds than with other important figures of the Scottish Enlightenment.\n\nIn 1751, Smith earned a professorship at Glasgow University teaching logic courses, and in 1752, he was elected a member of the Philosophical Society of Edinburgh, having been introduced to the society by Lord Kames. When the head of Moral Philosophy in Glasgow died the next year, Smith took over the position. He worked as an academic for the next 13 years, which he characterised as \"by far the most useful and therefore by far the happiest and most honorable period [of his life]\".\n\nSmith published \"The Theory of Moral Sentiments\" in 1759, embodying some of his Glasgow lectures. This work was concerned with how human morality depends on sympathy between agent and spectator, or the individual and other members of society. Smith defined \"mutual sympathy\" as the basis of moral sentiments. He based his explanation, not on a special \"moral sense\" as the Third Lord Shaftesbury and Hutcheson had done, nor on utility as Hume did, but on mutual sympathy, a term best captured in modern parlance by the 20th-century concept of empathy, the capacity to recognise feelings that are being experienced by another being.\nFollowing the publication of \"The Theory of Moral Sentiments\", Smith became so popular that many wealthy students left their schools in other countries to enroll at Glasgow to learn under Smith. After the publication of \"The Theory of Moral Sentiments\", Smith began to give more attention to jurisprudence and economics in his lectures and less to his theories of morals. For example, Smith lectured that the cause of increase in national wealth is labour, rather than the nation's quantity of gold or silver, which is the basis for mercantilism, the economic theory that dominated Western European economic policies at the time.\n\nIn 1762, the University of Glasgow conferred on Smith the title of Doctor of Laws (LL.D.). At the end of 1763, he obtained an offer from Charles Townshend—who had been introduced to Smith by David Hume—to tutor his stepson, Henry Scott, the young Duke of Buccleuch. Smith resigned from his professorship in 1764 to take the tutoring position. He subsequently attempted to return the fees he had collected from his students because he had resigned partway through the term, but his students refused.\n\nSmith's tutoring job entailed touring Europe with Scott, during which time he educated Scott on a variety of subjects, such as etiquette and manners. He was paid £300 per year (plus expenses) along with a £300 per year pension; roughly twice his former income as a teacher. Smith first travelled as a tutor to Toulouse, France, where he stayed for a year and a half. According to his own account, he found Toulouse to be somewhat boring, having written to Hume that he \"had begun to write a book to pass away the time\". After touring the south of France, the group moved to Geneva, where Smith met with the philosopher Voltaire.\nFrom Geneva, the party moved to Paris. Here, Smith met Benjamin Franklin, and discovered the Physiocracy school founded by François Quesnay. Physiocrats were opposed to mercantilism, the dominating economic theory of the time, illustrated in their motto \"Laissez faire et laissez passer, le monde va de lui même!\" (Let do and let pass, the world goes on by itself!).\n\nThe wealth of France had been virtually depleted by Louis XIV and Louis XV in ruinous wars, and was further exhausted in aiding the American insurgents against the British. The excessive consumption of goods and services deemed to have no economic contribution was considered a source of unproductive labour, with France's agriculture the only economic sector maintaining the wealth of the nation. Given that the English economy of the day yielded an income distribution that stood in contrast to that which existed in France, Smith concluded that \"with all its imperfections, [the Physiocratic school] is perhaps the nearest approximation to the truth that has yet been published upon the subject of political economy.\" The distinction between productive versus unproductive labour—the physiocratic \"classe steril\"—was a predominant issue in the development and understanding of what would become classical economic theory.\n\nIn 1766, Henry Scott's younger brother died in Paris, and Smith's tour as a tutor ended shortly thereafter. Smith returned home that year to Kirkcaldy, and he devoted much of the next decade to writing his \"magnum opus\". There, he befriended Henry Moyes, a young blind man who showed precocious aptitude. Smith secured the patronage of David Hume and Thomas Reid in the young man's education. In May 1773, Smith was elected fellow of the Royal Society of London, and was elected a member of the Literary Club in 1775. \"The Wealth of Nations\" was published in 1776 and was an instant success, selling out its first edition in only six months.\n\nIn 1778, Smith was appointed to a post as commissioner of customs in Scotland and went to live with his mother (who died in 1784) in Panmure House in Edinburgh's Canongate. Five years later, as a member of the Philosophical Society of Edinburgh when it received its royal charter, he automatically became one of the founding members of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. From 1787 to 1789, he occupied the honorary position of Lord Rector of the University of Glasgow.\n\nSmith died in the northern wing of Panmure House in Edinburgh on 17 July 1790 after a painful illness. His body was buried in the Canongate Kirkyard. On his deathbed, Smith expressed disappointment that he had not achieved more.\n\nSmith's literary executors were two friends from the Scottish academic world: the physicist and chemist Joseph Black and the pioneering geologist James Hutton. Smith left behind many notes and some unpublished material, but gave instructions to destroy anything that was not fit for publication. He mentioned an early unpublished \"History of Astronomy\" as probably suitable, and it duly appeared in 1795, along with other material such as \"Essays on Philosophical Subjects\".\n\nSmith's library went by his will to David Douglas, Lord Reston (son of his cousin Colonel Robert Douglas of Strathendry, Fife), who lived with Smith. It was eventually divided between his two surviving children, Cecilia Margaret (Mrs. Cunningham) and David Anne (Mrs. Bannerman). On the death of her husband, the Reverend W. B. Cunningham of Prestonpans in 1878, Mrs. Cunningham sold some of the books. The remainder passed to her son, Professor Robert Oliver Cunningham of Queen's College, Belfast, who presented a part to the library of Queen's College. After his death, the remaining books were sold. On the death of Mrs. Bannerman in 1879, her portion of the library went intact to the New College (of the Free Church) in Edinburgh and the collection was transferred to the University of Edinburgh Main Library in 1972.\n\nNot much is known about Smith's personal views beyond what can be deduced from his published articles. His personal papers were destroyed after his death at his request. He never married, and seems to have maintained a close relationship with his mother, with whom he lived after his return from France and who died six years before him.\n\nSmith was described by several of his contemporaries and biographers as comically absent-minded, with peculiar habits of speech and gait, and a smile of \"inexpressible benignity\". He was known to talk to himself, a habit that began during his childhood when he would smile in rapt conversation with invisible companions. He also had occasional spells of imaginary illness, and he is reported to have had books and papers placed in tall stacks in his study. According to one story, Smith took Charles Townshend on a tour of a tanning factory, and while discussing free trade, Smith walked into a huge tanning pit from which he needed help to escape. He is also said to have put bread and butter into a teapot, drunk the concoction, and declared it to be the worst cup of tea he ever had. According to another account, Smith distractedly went out walking in his nightgown and ended up outside of town, before nearby church bells brought him back to reality.\n\nJames Boswell, who was a student of Smith's at Glasgow University, and later knew him at the Literary Club, says that Smith thought that speaking about his ideas in conversation might reduce the sale of his books, so his conversation was unimpressive. According to Boswell, he once told Sir Joshua Reynolds, that 'he made it a rule when in company never to talk of what he understood'.\n\nSmith has been alternately described as someone who \"had a large nose, bulging eyes, a protruding lower lip, a nervous twitch, and a speech impediment\" and one whose \"countenance was manly and agreeable.\" Smith is said to have acknowledged his looks at one point, saying, \"I am a beau in nothing but my books.\" Smith rarely sat for portraits, so almost all depictions of him created during his lifetime were drawn from memory. The best-known portraits of Smith are the profile by James Tassie and two etchings by John Kay. The line engravings produced for the covers of 19th-century reprints of \"The Wealth of Nations\" were based largely on Tassie's medallion.\n\nConsiderable scholarly debate has occurred about the nature of Smith's religious views. Smith's father had shown a strong interest in Christianity and belonged to the moderate wing of the Church of Scotland. The fact that Adam Smith received the Snell Exhibition suggests that he may have gone to Oxford with the intention of pursuing a career in the Church of England.\n\nAnglo-American economist Ronald Coase has challenged the view that Smith was a deist, based on the fact that Smith's writings never explicitly invoke God as an explanation of the harmonies of the natural or the human worlds. According to Coase, though Smith does sometimes refer to the \"Great Architect of the Universe\", later scholars such as Jacob Viner have \"very much exaggerated the extent to which Adam Smith was committed to a belief in a personal God\", a belief for which Coase finds little evidence in passages such as the one in the \"Wealth of Nations\" in which Smith writes that the curiosity of mankind about the \"great phenomena of nature\", such as \"the generation, the life, growth, and dissolution of plants and animals\", has led men to \"enquire into their causes\", and that \"superstition first attempted to satisfy this curiosity, by referring all those wonderful appearances to the immediate agency of the gods. Philosophy afterwards endeavoured to account for them, from more familiar causes, or from such as mankind were better acquainted with than the agency of the gods\".\n\nSome other authors argue that Smith's social and economic philosophy is inherently theological and that his entire model of social order is logically dependent on the notion of God's action in nature.\n\nSmith was also a close friend and later the executor of David Hume, who was commonly characterised in his own time as an atheist. The publication in 1777 of Smith's letter to William Strahan, in which he described Hume's courage in the face of death in spite of his irreligiosity, attracted considerable controversy.\n\nIn 1759, Smith published his first work, \"The Theory of Moral Sentiments,\" sold by co-publishers Andrew Millar of London and Alexander Kincaid of Edinburgh. Smith continued making extensive revisions to the book until his death. Although \"The Wealth of Nations\" is widely regarded as Smith's most influential work, Smith himself is believed to have considered \"The Theory of Moral Sentiments\" to be a superior work.\n\nIn the work, Smith critically examines the moral thinking of his time, and suggests that conscience arises from dynamic and interactive social relationships through which people seek \"mutual sympathy of sentiments.\" His goal in writing the work was to explain the source of mankind's ability to form moral judgement, given that people begin life with no moral sentiments at all. Smith proposes a theory of sympathy, in which the act of observing others and seeing the judgements they form of both others and oneself makes people aware of themselves and how others perceive their behaviour. The feedback we receive from perceiving (or imagining) others' judgements creates an incentive to achieve \"mutual sympathy of sentiments\" with them and leads people to develop habits, and then principles, of behaviour, which come to constitute one's conscience.\n\nSome scholars have perceived a conflict between \"The Theory of Moral Sentiments\" and \"The Wealth of Nations\"; the former emphasises sympathy for others, while the latter focuses on the role of self-interest. In recent years, however, some scholars of Smith's work have argued that no contradiction exists. They claim that in \"The Theory of Moral Sentiments\", Smith develops a theory of psychology in which individuals seek the approval of the \"impartial spectator\" as a result of a natural desire to have outside observers sympathise with their sentiments. Rather than viewing \"The Theory of Moral Sentiments\" and \"The Wealth of Nations\" as presenting incompatible views of human nature, some Smith scholars regard the works as emphasising different aspects of human nature that vary depending on the situation. Otteson argues that both books are Newtonian in their methodology and deploy a similar \"market model\" for explaining the creation and development of large-scale human social orders, including morality, economics, as well as language. Ekelund and Hebert offer a differing view, observing that self-interest is present in both works and that \"in the former, sympathy is the moral faculty that holds self-interest in check, whereas in the latter, competition is the economic faculty that restrains self-interest.\"\n\nDisagreement exists between classical and neoclassical economists about the central message of Smith's most influential work: \"An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations\" (1776). Neoclassical economists emphasise Smith's invisible hand, a concept mentioned in the middle of his work – Book IV, Chapter II – and classical economists believe that Smith stated his programme for promoting the \"wealth of nations\" in the first sentences, which attributes the growth of wealth and prosperity to the division of labour.\n\nSmith used the term \"the invisible hand\" in \"History of Astronomy\" referring to \"the invisible hand of Jupiter\", and once in each of his \"The Theory of Moral Sentiments\" (1759) and The Wealth of Nations (1776). This last statement about \"an invisible hand\" has been interpreted in numerous ways.\nAs every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce may be of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it. By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it. I have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the public good. It is an affectation, indeed, not very common among merchants, and very few words need be employed in dissuading them from it.\n\nThose who regard that statement as Smith's central message also quote frequently Smith's dictum:\n\nIt is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We address ourselves, not to their humanity but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities but of their advantages.\nSmith's statement about the benefits of \"an invisible hand\" may be meant to answer Mandeville's contention that \"Private Vices ... may be turned into Public Benefits\". It shows Smith's belief that when an individual pursues his self-interest under conditions of justice, he unintentionally promotes the good of society. Self-interested competition in the free market, he argued, would tend to benefit society as a whole by keeping prices low, while still building in an incentive for a wide variety of goods and services. Nevertheless, he was wary of businessmen and warned of their \"conspiracy against the public or in some other contrivance to raise prices\". Again and again, Smith warned of the collusive nature of business interests, which may form cabals or monopolies, fixing the highest price \"which can be squeezed out of the buyers\". Smith also warned that a business-dominated political system would allow a conspiracy of businesses and industry against consumers, with the former scheming to influence politics and legislation. Smith states that the interest of manufacturers and merchants \"in any particular branch of trade or manufactures, is always in some respects different from, and even opposite to, that of the public ... The proposal of any new law or regulation of commerce which comes from this order, ought always to be listened to with great precaution, and ought never be adopted till after having been long and carefully examined, not only with the most scrupulous, but with the most suspicious attention.\" Thus Smith's chief worry seems to be when business is given special protections or privileges from government; by contrast, in the absence of such special political favours, he believed that business activities were generally beneficial to the whole society:\n\nIt is the great multiplication of the production of all the different arts, in consequence of the division of labour, which occasions, in a well-governed society, that universal opulence which extends itself to the lowest ranks of the people. Every workman has a great quantity of his own work to dispose of beyond what he himself has occasion for; and every other workman being exactly in the same situation, he is enabled to exchange a great quantity of his own goods for a great quantity, or, what comes to the same thing, for the price of a great quantity of theirs. He supplies them abundantly with what they have occasion for, and they accommodate him as amply with what he has occasion for, and a general plenty diffuses itself through all the different ranks of society. (\"The Wealth of Nations,\" I.i.10)\n\nThe neoclassical interest in Smith's statement about \"an invisible hand\" originates in the possibility of seeing it as a precursor of neoclassical economics and its concept of general equilibrium – Samuelson's \"Economics\" refers six times to Smith's \"invisible hand\". To emphasise this connection, Samuelson quotes Smith's \"invisible hand\" statement substituting \"general interest\" for \"public interest\". Samuelson concludes: \"Smith was unable to prove the essence of his invisible-hand doctrine. Indeed, until the 1940s, no one knew how to prove, even to state properly, the kernel of truth in this proposition about perfectly competitive market.\"\nVery differently, classical economists see in Smith's first sentences his programme to promote \"The Wealth of Nations\". Using the physiocratical concept of the economy as a circular process, to secure growth the inputs of Period 2 must exceed the inputs of Period 1. Therefore, those outputs of Period 1 which are not used or usable as inputs of Period 2 are regarded as unproductive labour, as they do not contribute to growth. This is what Smith had heard in France from, among others, François Quesnay, whose ideas Smith was so impressed by that he might have dedicated \"The Wealth of Nations\" to him had he not died beforehand. To this French insight that unproductive labour should be reduced to use labour more productively, Smith added his own proposal, that productive labour should be made even more productive by deepening the division of labour. Smith argued that deepening the division of labour under competition leads to greater productivity, which leads to lower prices and thus an increasing standard of living—\"general plenty\" and \"universal opulence\"—for all. Extended markets and increased production lead to the continuous reorganisation of production and the invention of new ways of producing, which in turn lead to further increased production, lower prices, and improved standards of living. Smith's central message is, therefore, that under dynamic competition, a growth machine secures \"The Wealth of Nations\". Smith's argument predicted Britain's evolution as the workshop of the world, underselling and outproducing all its competitors. The opening sentences of the \"Wealth of Nations\" summarise this policy:\n\nThe annual labour of every nation is the fund which originally supplies it with all the necessaries and conveniences of life which it annually consumes ... . [T]his produce ... bears a greater or smaller proportion to the number of those who are to consume it ... .[B]ut this proportion must in every nation be regulated by two different circumstances;\n\nHowever, Smith added that the \"abundance or scantiness of this supply too seems to depend more upon the former of those two circumstances than upon the latter.\"\n\nAlfred Marshall criticised Smith's definition of the economy on several points. He argued that man should be equally important as money, services are as important as goods, and that there must be an emphasis on human welfare, instead of just wealth. The \"invisible hand\" only works well when both production and consumption operates in free markets, with small (\"atomistic\") producers and consumers allowing supply and demand to fluctuate and equilibrate. In conditions of monopoly and oligopoly, the \"invisible hand\" fails. Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph E. Stiglitz says, on the topic of one of Smith's better-known ideas: \"the reason that the invisible hand often seems invisible is that it is often not there.\"\n\nShortly before his death, Smith had nearly all his manuscripts destroyed. In his last years, he seemed to have been planning two major treatises, one on the theory and history of law and one on the sciences and arts. The posthumously published \"Essays on Philosophical Subjects\", a history of astronomy down to Smith's own era, plus some thoughts on ancient physics and metaphysics, probably contain parts of what would have been the latter treatise. \"Lectures on Jurisprudence\" were notes taken from Smith's early lectures, plus an early draft of \"The Wealth of Nations\", published as part of the 1976 Glasgow Edition of the works and correspondence of Smith. Other works, including some published posthumously, include \"Lectures on Justice, Police, Revenue, and Arms\" (1763) (first published in 1896); and \"Essays on Philosophical Subjects\" (1795).\n\n\"The Wealth of Nations\" was a precursor to the modern academic discipline of economics. In this and other works, Smith expounded how rational self-interest and competition can lead to economic prosperity. Smith was controversial in his own day and his general approach and writing style were often satirised by Tory writers in the moralising tradition of Hogarth and Swift, as a discussion at the University of Winchester suggests. In 2005, \"The Wealth of Nations\" was named among the 100 Best Scottish Books of all time. \n\nIn light of the arguments put forward by Smith and other economic theorists in Britain, academic belief in mercantilism began to decline in Britain in the late 18th century. During the Industrial Revolution, Britain embraced free trade and Smith's \"laissez-faire\" economics, and via the British Empire, used its power to spread a broadly liberal economic model around the world, characterised by open markets, and relatively barrier-free domestic and international trade.\n\nGeorge Stigler attributes to Smith \"the most important substantive proposition in all of economics\". It is that, under competition, owners of resources (for example labour, land, and capital) will use them most profitably, resulting in an equal rate of return in equilibrium for all uses, adjusted for apparent differences arising from such factors as training, trust, hardship, and unemployment.\n\nPaul Samuelson finds in Smith's pluralist use of supply and demand as applied to wages, rents, and profit a valid and valuable anticipation of the general equilibrium modelling of Walras a century later. Smith's allowance for wage increases in the short and intermediate term from capital accumulation and invention contrasted with Malthus, Ricardo, and Karl Marx in their propounding a rigid subsistence–wage theory of labour supply.\n\nJoseph Schumpeter criticised Smith for a lack of technical rigour, yet he argued that this enabled Smith's writings to appeal to wider audiences: \"His very limitation made for success. Had he been more brilliant, he would not have been taken so seriously. Had he dug more deeply, had he unearthed more recondite truth, had he used more difficult and ingenious methods, he would not have been understood. But he had no such ambitions; in fact he disliked whatever went beyond plain common sense. He never moved above the heads of even the dullest readers. He led them on gently, encouraging them by trivialities and homely observations, making them feel comfortable all along.\"\n\nClassical economists presented competing theories of those of Smith, termed the \"labour theory of value\". Later Marxian economics descending from classical economics also use Smith's labour theories, in part. The first volume of Karl Marx's major work, \"Das Kapital\", was published in German in 1867. In it, Marx focused on the labour theory of value and what he considered to be the exploitation of labour by capital. The labour theory of value held that the value of a thing was determined by the labour that went into its production. This contrasts with the modern contention of neoclassical economics, that the value of a thing is determined by what one is willing to give up to obtain the thing.\n\nThe body of theory later termed \"neoclassical economics\" or \"marginalism\" formed from about 1870 to 1910. The term \"economics\" was popularised by such neoclassical economists as Alfred Marshall as a concise synonym for \"economic science\" and a substitute for the earlier, broader term \"political economy\" used by Smith. This corresponded to the influence on the subject of mathematical methods used in the natural sciences. Neoclassical economics systematised supply and demand as joint determinants of price and quantity in market equilibrium, affecting both the allocation of output and the distribution of income. It dispensed with the labour theory of value of which Smith was most famously identified with in classical economics, in favour of a marginal utility theory of value on the demand side and a more general theory of costs on the supply side.\n\nThe bicentennial anniversary of the publication of \"The Wealth of Nations\" was celebrated in 1976, resulting in increased interest for \"The Theory of Moral Sentiments\" and his other works throughout academia. After 1976, Smith was more likely to be represented as the author of both \"The Wealth of Nations\" and \"The Theory of Moral Sentiments\", and thereby as the founder of a moral philosophy and the science of economics. His \"homo economicus\" or \"economic man\" was also more often represented as a moral person. Additionally, economists David Levy and Sandra Peart in \"The Secret History of the Dismal Science\" point to his opposition to hierarchy and beliefs in inequality, including racial inequality, and provide additional support for those who point to Smith's opposition to slavery, colonialism, and empire. They show the caricatures of Smith drawn by the opponents of views on hierarchy and inequality in this online article. Emphasised also are Smith's statements of the need for high wages for the poor, and the efforts to keep wages low. In The \"Vanity of the Philosopher: From Equality to Hierarchy in Postclassical Economics\", Peart and Levy also cite Smith's view that a common street porter was not intellectually inferior to a philosopher, and point to the need for greater appreciation of the public views in discussions of science and other subjects now considered to be technical. They also cite Smith's opposition to the often expressed view that science is superior to common sense.\n\nSmith also explained the relationship between growth of private property and civil government:\n\nMen may live together in society with some tolerable degree of security, though there is no civil magistrate to protect them from the injustice of those passions. But avarice and ambition in the rich, in the poor the hatred of labour and the love of present ease and enjoyment, are the passions which prompt to invade property, passions much more steady in their operation, and much more universal in their influence. Wherever there is great property there is great inequality. For one very rich man there must be at least five hundred poor, and the affluence of the few supposes the indigence of the many. The affluence of the rich excites the indignation of the poor, who are often both driven by want, and prompted by envy, to invade his possessions. It is only under the shelter of the civil magistrate that the owner of that valuable property, which is acquired by the labour of many years, or perhaps of many successive generations, can sleep a single night in security. He is at all times surrounded by unknown enemies, whom, though he never provoked, he can never appease, and from whose injustice he can be protected only by the powerful arm of the civil magistrate continually held up to chastise it. The acquisition of valuable and extensive property, therefore, necessarily requires the establishment of civil government. Where there is no property, or at least none that exceeds the value of two or three days' labour, civil government is not so necessary. Civil government supposes a certain subordination. But as the necessity of civil government gradually grows up with the acquisition of valuable property, so the principal causes which naturally introduce subordination gradually grow up with the growth of that valuable property. (...) Men of inferior wealth combine to defend those of superior wealth in the possession of their property, in order that men of superior wealth may combine to defend them in the possession of theirs. All the inferior shepherds and herdsmen feel that the security of their own herds and flocks depends upon the security of those of the great shepherd or herdsman; that the maintenance of their lesser authority depends upon that of his greater authority, and that upon their subordination to him depends his power of keeping their inferiors in subordination to them. They constitute a sort of little nobility, who feel themselves interested to defend the property and to support the authority of their own little sovereign in order that he may be able to defend their property and to support their authority. Civil government, so far as it is instituted for the security of property, is in reality instituted for the defence of the rich against the poor, or of those who have some property against those who have none at all. (Source: \"The Wealth of Nations\", Book 5, Chapter 1, Part 2)\n\nSmith's chapter on colonies, in turn, would help shape British imperial debates from the mid-19th century onward. \"The Wealth of Nations\" would become an ambiguous text regarding the imperial question. In his chapter on colonies, Smith pondered how to solve the crisis developing across the Atlantic among the empire's 13 American colonies. He offered two different proposals for easing tensions. The first proposal called for giving the colonies their independence, and by thus parting on a friendly basis, Britain would be able to develop and maintain a free-trade relationship with them, and possibly even an informal military alliance. Smith's second proposal called for a theoretical imperial federation that would bring the colonies and the metropole closer together through an imperial parliamentary system and imperial free trade.\n\nSmith's most prominent disciple in 19th-century Britain, peace advocate Richard Cobden, preferred the first proposal. Cobden would lead the Anti-Corn Law League in overturning the Corn Laws in 1846, shifting Britain to a policy of free trade and empire \"on the cheap\" for decades to come. This hands-off approach toward the British Empire would become known as Cobdenism or the Manchester School. By the turn of the century, however, advocates of Smith's second proposal such as Joseph Shield Nicholson would become ever more vocal in opposing Cobdenism, calling instead for imperial federation. As Marc-William Palen notes: \"On the one hand, Adam Smith’s late nineteenth and early twentieth-century Cobdenite adherents used his theories to argue for gradual imperial devolution and empire ‘on the cheap’. On the other, various proponents of imperial federation throughout the British World sought to use Smith’s theories to overturn the predominant Cobdenite hands-off imperial approach and instead, with a firm grip, bring the empire closer than ever before.\" Smith's ideas thus played an important part in subsequent debates over the British Empire.\n\nSmith has been commemorated in the UK on banknotes printed by two different banks; his portrait has appeared since 1981 on the £50 notes issued by the Clydesdale Bank in Scotland, and in March 2007 Smith's image also appeared on the new series of £20 notes issued by the Bank of England, making him the first Scotsman to feature on an English banknote.\n\nA large-scale memorial of Smith by Alexander Stoddart was unveiled on 4 July 2008 in Edinburgh. It is a -tall bronze sculpture and it stands above the Royal Mile outside St Giles' Cathedral in Parliament Square, near the Mercat cross. 20th-century sculptor Jim Sanborn (best known for the \"Kryptos\" sculpture at the United States Central Intelligence Agency) has created multiple pieces which feature Smith's work. At Central Connecticut State University is \"Circulating Capital\", a tall cylinder which features an extract from \"The Wealth of Nations\" on the lower half, and on the upper half, some of the same text, but represented in binary code. At the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, outside the Belk College of Business Administration, is \"Adam Smith's Spinning Top\". Another Smith sculpture is at Cleveland State University. He also appears as the narrator in the 2013 play \"The Low Road\", centred on a proponent on \"laissez-faire\" economics in the late 18th century, but dealing obliquely with the financial crisis of 2007–2008 and the recession which followed; in the premiere production, he was portrayed by Bill Paterson.\n\nA bust of Smith is in the Hall of Heroes of the National Wallace Monument in Stirling.\n\nAdam Smith resided at Panmure House from 1778 to 1790. This residence has now been purchased by the Edinburgh Business School at Heriot Watt University and fundraising has begun to restore it. Part of the Northern end of the original building appears to have been demolished in the 19th century to make way for an iron foundry.\n\nSmith has been celebrated by advocates of free-market policies as the founder of free-market economics, a view reflected in the naming of bodies such as the Adam Smith Institute in London, the Adam Smith Society and the Australian Adam Smith Club, and in terms such as the Adam Smith necktie.\n\nAlan Greenspan argues that, while Smith did not coin the term \"laissez-faire\", \"it was left to Adam Smith to identify the more-general set of principles that brought conceptual clarity to the seeming chaos of market transactions\". Greenspan continues that \"The Wealth of Nations\" was \"one of the great achievements in human intellectual history\". P. J. O'Rourke describes Smith as the \"founder of free market economics\".\n\nOther writers have argued that Smith's support for \"laissez-faire\" (which in French means leave alone) has been overstated. Herbert Stein wrote that the people who \"wear an Adam Smith necktie\" do it to \"make a statement of their devotion to the idea of free markets and limited government\", and that this misrepresents Smith's ideas. Stein writes that Smith \"was not pure or doctrinaire about this idea. He viewed government intervention in the market with great skepticism...yet he was prepared to accept or propose qualifications to that policy in the specific cases where he judged that their net effect would be beneficial and would not undermine the basically free character of the system. He did not wear the Adam Smith necktie.\" In Stein's reading, \"The Wealth of Nations\" could justify the Food and Drug Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, mandatory employer health benefits, environmentalism, and \"discriminatory taxation to deter improper or luxurious behavior\".\n\nSimilarly, Vivienne Brown stated in \"The Economic Journal\" that in the 20th-century United States, Reaganomics supporters, the \"Wall Street Journal\", and other similar sources have spread among the general public a partial and misleading vision of Smith, portraying him as an \"extreme dogmatic defender of \"laissez-faire\" capitalism and supply-side economics\". In fact, \"The Wealth of Nations\" includes the following statement on the payment of taxes:\n\nThe subjects of every state ought to contribute towards the support of the government, as nearly as possible, in proportion to their respective abilities; that is, in proportion to the revenue which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the state.\n\nSome commentators have argued that Smith's works show support for a progressive, not flat, income tax and that he specifically named taxes that he thought should be required by the state, among them luxury-goods taxes and tax on rent. Yet Smith argued for the \"impossibility of taxing the people, in proportion to their economic revenue, by any capitation\" (\"The Wealth of Nations,\" V.ii.k.1). Smith argued that taxes should principally go toward protecting \"justice\" and \"certain publick institutions\" that were necessary for the benefit of all of society, but that could not be provided by private enterprise (\"The Wealth of Nations,\" IV.ix.51).\n\nAdditionally, Smith outlined the proper expenses of the government in \"The Wealth of Nations, Book V, Ch. I\". Included in his requirements of a government is to enforce contracts and provide justice system, grant patents and copy rights, provide public goods such as infrastructure, provide national defence, and regulate banking. The role of the government was to provide goods \"of such a nature that the profit could never repay the expense to any individual\" such as roads, bridges, canals, and harbours. He also encouraged invention and new ideas through his patent enforcement and support of infant industry monopolies. He supported partial public subsidies for elementary education, and he believed that competition among religious institutions would provide general benefit to the society. In such cases, however, Smith argued for local rather than centralised control: \"Even those publick works which are of such a nature that they cannot afford any revenue for maintaining themselves . . . are always better maintained by a local or provincial revenue, under the management of a local and provincial administration, than by the general revenue of the state\" (\"Wealth of Nations,\" V.i.d.18). Finally, he outlined how the government should support the dignity of the monarch or chief magistrate, such that they are equal or above the public in fashion. He even states that monarchs should be provided for in a greater fashion than magistrates of a republic because \"we naturally expect more splendor in the court of a king than in the mansion-house of a doge\". In addition, he allowed that in some specific circumstances, retaliatory tariffs may be beneficial:\n\nThe recovery of a great foreign market will generally more than compensate the transitory inconvenience of paying dearer during a short time for some sorts of goods.\n\nHowever, he added that in general, a retaliatory tariff \"seems a bad method of compensating the injury done to certain classes of our people, to do another injury ourselves, not only to those classes, but to almost all the other classes of them\" (\"The Wealth of Nations,\" IV.ii.39).\n\nEconomic historians such as Jacob Viner regard Smith as a strong advocate of free markets and limited government (what Smith called \"natural liberty\"), but not as a dogmatic supporter of \"laissez-faire\".\n\nEconomist Daniel Klein believes using the term \"free-market economics\" or \"free-market economist\" to identify the ideas of Smith is too general and slightly misleading. Klein offers six characteristics central to the identity of Smith's economic thought and argues that a new name is needed to give a more accurate depiction of the \"Smithian\" identity. Economist David Ricardo set straight some of the misunderstandings about Smith's thoughts on free market. Most people still fall victim to the thinking that Smith was a free-market economist without exception, though he was not. Ricardo pointed out that Smith was in support of helping infant industries. Smith believed that the government should subsidise newly formed industry, but he did fear that when the infant industry grew into adulthood, it would be unwilling to surrender the government help. Smith also supported tariffs on imported goods to counteract an internal tax on the same good. Smith also fell to pressure in supporting some tariffs in support for national defence.\n\nSome have also claimed, Emma Rothschild among them, that Smith would have supported a minimum wage, although no direct textual evidence supports the claim. Indeed, Smith wrote:\n\nThe price of labour, it must be observed, cannot be ascertained very accurately anywhere, different prices being often paid at the same place and for the same sort of labour, not only according to the different abilities of the workmen, but according to the easiness or hardness of the masters. Where wages are not regulated by law, all that we can pretend to determine is what are the most usual; and experience seems to show that law can never regulate them properly, though it has often pretended to do so. (\"The Wealth of Nations\", Book 1, Chapter 8)\n\nHowever, Smith also noted, to the contrary, the existence of an imbalanced, inequality of bargaining power:\nA landlord, a farmer, a master manufacturer, a merchant, though they did not employ a single workman, could generally live a year or two upon the stocks which they have already acquired. Many workmen could not subsist a week, few could subsist a month, and scarce any a year without employment. In the long run, the workman may be as necessary to his master as his master is to him, but the necessity is not so immediate.\n\n\nInformational notes\nCitations\nBibliography\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3095397", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3095397", "title": "Asian pride", "text": "Asian pride\n\nAsian pride is a term utilized internationally but has various origins and meanings.\n\nAsian pride is a broad term that can cover several topics. Within the international relations context, Asian pride can be seen within Asian politics as advancement of Pan-Asianism through heavy criticism of the West.\n\nIn 2014, China referred to India's successful Mars Orbiter Mission of \"Mangalyaan\" as the \"pride of Asia\".\n\nThe pan-ethnicity Asian American concept is not embraced by many Asian Americans in the United States.\n\nIn the United States the term has older roots within the counter culture movement among Asian Americans in the 1960s. During the period there was the Black Power movement, and Asian Americans seeing the impact it had on African-American culture and overall society, rejecting being called \"Oriental\" and the stereotype of the \"yellow peril\" used the term Asian Pride, along with \"yellow power\", to advance empowerment of Asian Americans.\n\nA more modern usage of the term \"Asian Pride\" (also spelled AZN pride) the United States is a positive stance to being Asian American. The term arose from influences of hip hop culture within Asian American communities in the Western United States due to the creation of an Asian American pan-ethnicity (the concept was influenced in the late 20th century due to the influence of publications such as \"Yolk\" and \"Giant Robot\" magazines) that did not specify a specific ethnicity (such as Vietnamese, or Hmong). One manifestation of this was the Got Rice? term, which spun off from the advertising campaign Got Milk?. Younger Asian Americans are finding strength from their Asian identity. Another usage of the term was Greg Pak's \"Asian Pride Porn!\", which used political correct pornography parody to present Asian Americans in a positive light compared to their portrayal in late 20th century mainstream media. Sometimes this arises due to being made to feel different from the prevalent culture surrounding the Asian American youth. \n\nThe term can be used as a negative, being used to describe individuals who prefer only to have Asian American relationships with the exclusion of potential diverse relationships. It has also been criticized as being primarily a marketing gimmick that \"is wide open to model minority accusations.\" \n\nThe term has been adopted by a few Filipino American gang members in Los Angeles, who used the term to assist them in their construction of their ethnic identity. It has also been used as the name of a gang in Florida and Colorado.\n\nThe phrase \"Got Rice?\" is a term that was coined by Asian American youth in the 1990s shortly after the original \"Got Milk?\" advertising campaign for the California Milk Board in 1993. The phrase has since come to be used as a symbol for the cohesiveness of Asian American cultural identity and cultural pride, especially on the Internet. It's usually mentioned close to the Asian Pride slogan.\n\nThe humor is derived from the fact that rice is a staple food in many Asian cultures. The slogan can thus be viewed as an Asian American cultural response to American media and advertising.\n\nThere is also a parody song called \"Got Rice?\", often referred as AZN Pride, which samples 2Pac's \"Changes\". The song dates back to at least 2000, and has been described as being in the raptivist genre; it is also noted as an example of Asian Americans, specifically Chinese Americans, adoption and adaption of Hip Hop culture. It has also been referred to as \"satirically pro-Asian\", for its use of the AZN terminology which is not fully embraced by all Asian Americans. The Fung Brothers released a modification of the song in 2010.\n\nWhile the phrase itself presumably began as Asian American slang, the first notable usage is the T-shirt campaign first started by the Asian American magazine \"Yolk\".\n\nSoon, other Asian American organizations began promoting the phrase and selling similar T-shirt designs. The organizations and their proponents intended for the T-shirts to be a fun way of promoting Asian American cultural heritage:\n\"Political identi-tees don’t all have to be so in-your-face. The Japanese American National Museum (http://www.janm.org/) in L.A.’s Little Tokyo offers an array of kinder, gentler tees commemorating aspects of Japanese-American heritage both fun and serious. Among the most popular designs, a line of adult and baby tees feature the rallying cry of the lactose liberation movement, \"Got Rice?\"\n\nMany in the Asian American community viewed the design as evidence of significant progress for the viability of Asian American culture and identity; whereas before identity may have been enforced on Asians via stereotypes from the dominant society, the \"Got Rice?\" shirts were an attempt by Asian Americans to define their identity and to take back those symbols used to stereotype them.\n\n\n"}

His Hegelian philosophy influenced the young Karl Marx and action theorists.\n\nCieszkowski was born in Nowa Sucha, in the Duchy of Warsaw. He studied at the Jagiellonian University and in then, from 1832, at the Humboldt University of Berlin where he became interested in Hegelianism through the lectures of Karl Ludwig Michelet, who became a lifelong friend. He gained his doctorate in philosophy from Heidelberg University in 1838. After his studies he travelled around Europe, visiting France, England and Italy before returning to Poland in 1840 and settling permanently in Wierzenica, near Poznań, in 1843.\n\nCieszkowski co-founded the Polish League (Liga Polska) in 1848. He was a member of the Prussian National Assembly (1848–1855) and a political activist. He (unsuccessfully) endeavoured to start a university in Poznań and co-founded the Poznań Society of Friends of Arts and Sciences (PTPN) in 1857, being elected to its presidency three times (1857–1858, 1861–1868, 1885). It was the most important cultural and scientific society in Poland until the creation of Kraków's Academy of Learning (Akademia Umiejętności) in 1871-73. In 1870 he founded the Halina School of Agriculture in Żabikowo, named after his wife Halina, who had died in 1861. In 1873 it became affiliated to the Kraków Academy of Learning, established in 1872.\n\nCieszkowski coined the term historiosophy in his 1838 work \"Prolegomena zur Historiosophie\" (\"Prolegomena to a Historiosophy\"), a revision of the Hegelian philosophy of history. He adopted a threefold division of human history from medieval millenarians such as Joachim of Fiore and mixed it with Hegelian categories and concepts. He is arguably the creator of the \"philosophy of action.\"\n\nThe \"first\" period of history was that of antiquity. \n\nThe \"second\" period was the Christian era, which represented the birth of reflectiveness, a turning inwards and upwards from natural sensual immediacy toward the universal and abstract. The spirit existed 'for itself' (\"für sich\"). This period was marked by an intolerable duality between the opposed worlds of the God and temporal existence, spirit and matter, action and thought. The Hegelian philosophy of spirit, thought and universality at the expense of will, matter and particularly the (Hegelian) spirit had not yet experienced the division of mind and body and living in a primal pre-reflective unity with nature, mainly expressing itself through art. The spirit was 'in itself' (\"an sich\") in Hegelian jargon. The existence represented the apotheosis and supreme manifestation of this period of history.\n\nThe \"third\" period of history was the 'post-Hegelian' era in which the dualisms of the last were overcome and superseded. The one-sided emphasis on thought in the Christian era would be overcome and the spirit would assimilate nature to itself as well. Thus philosophy would come to an end as the synthesising and self-actualising activity of the spirit now took the form of creative practical activity. This final stage of the development of spirit represents the ultimate synthesis of opposites: God and world, necessity and freedom, desire and duty, Heaven and Earth are all as one.\n\nCieszkowski's later works, \"Gott und Paligenesie\" (\"God and Palingenesis\") (1842) and \"Ojcze Nasz\" (\"Our Father\", 1848–1906, four volumes), reformulate his triad in much more explicitly religious terms. The three eras are expressed as those of God the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. He stresses the role of the Catholic Church and accords a significant world-transforming role to the Slavs (a common theme in the Messianistic philosophy current in Poland at the time) in the process through which the Holy Spirit would emerge.\n\nCieszkowski's belief in a personal God, it has been argued, disqualifies him from being a Left Hegelian, who were distinguished from Hegel's more orthodox followers by their generally critical attitude to religion and Christianity. He was certainly not counted by the Left as one of their own, even though the idea of the unity of philosophy of action was soon taken up by some of its members. On the other hand, he did incorporate an elaborate system of social reforms into his philosophy and was strongly influenced by the French socialist tradition, which was often overtly religious, and thus did not share the characteristic political conservatism of the 'Right Hegelians'.\n\nCieszkowski exerted a significant (and reciprocated) influence on Polish Romantic poet, playwright and Gothic novelist Zygmunt Krasinski, whom he met in Milan in 1839 and became close friends with ( published (in Polish) two volumes of their correspondence in 1912). He also influenced the poet Cyprian Norwid, philosopher and philosopher, art historian and proto-psychologist . He is arguably the creator of the \"philosophy of action.\" His most important philosophical legacy is probably his influence on the young Karl Marx, via German communist and Young Hegelian Moses Hess. The latter adopted Cieszkowski's idea of that the dualism between consciousness and action would collapse in the latter part of the history of humanity, though he believed the synthesis had occurred on various occasions throughout history and located the transition to the 'third age' at the Reformation instead of the philosophy of Hegel. Marx, who was a friend of and collaborator with Hess from a few years from 1841 onwards, owes various aspects of his thought on alienation and the nature of and transition to communist society to Cieszkowski, including that the dualism between consciousness and action would collapse in revolutionary \"praxis\". (Cieszkowski was one of the earliest philosophers to use the term \"praxis\" as meaning \"action oriented towards changing society\" in his \"Prolegomena zur Historiosophie\").\n\nThe University of Life Sciences in Poznań was named the August Cieszkowski Agricultural University of Poznań from 1996 until 11 April 2008, when it gained official university status, in recognition of Cieszkowski's contributions to agricultural science and education in the region.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2331554", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2331554", "title": "Carlo Cattaneo", "text": "Carlo Cattaneo\n\nCarlo Cattaneo (; Milan, June 15, 1801 – Castagnola, February 6, 1869) was an Italian philosopher and writer, famous for his role in the Five Days of Milan on March 1849, when he led the city council during the rebellion.\n\nCattaneo was born in Milan. A republican in his convictions, during his youth he had taken part in the Carbonari movement in Lombardy. He devoted himself to the study of philosophy, with the hope of regenerating Italian people by withdrawing them from romanticism and rhetoric, and turning their attention to the positive sciences. In this period, Cattaneo met philosopher Giandomenico Romagnosi and he \"was especially attracted by Romagnosi's emphasis on practical solutions and interdisciplinary work\". Developing some intuitions coming from his mentor, Cattaneo expounded his ideas in a review founded by him in Milan in 1839, called \"II Politecnico\". He resided at the Palazzo Gavazzi from 1840 until 1848.\n\nWhen the revolution of 1848 broke out, he threw himself heart and soul into the fray, and became one of the leading spirits of the insurrection against the Austrians, known as the Five Days of Milan (March 18 – 22, 1848). Together with the young democrats Enrico Cernuschi, Giulio Terzaghi and Giorgio Clerici he formed a council of war which, having its headquarters at Palazzo Taverna in via Bigli, directed the operations of the insurgents. He was second to none in self-sacrifice and heroic resolution. When on March 18 Field Marshal Radetzky, feeling that the position of the Austrian garrison was untenable, sounded the rebels as to their terms, some of the leaders were inclined to agree to an armistice which would give time for the Piedmontese troops to arrive (Piedmont had just declared war), but Cattaneo insisted on the complete evacuation of Lombardy. Again, on March 21, Radetzky tried to obtain an armistice, and Durini and Borromeo were ready to grant it, for it would have enabled them to reorganize the defences and replenish the supplies of food and ammunition, which could only last another day. But, Cattaneo replied:\n\nThe enemy having furnished us with munitions thus far, will continue to do so. Twenty-four hours of victuals and twenty-four hours of hunger will be many more hours than we shall need. This evening, if the plans we have just arranged should succeed, the line of the bastions will be broken. At any rate, even though we should lack bread, it is better to die of hunger than on the gallows.\nOn the expulsion of the Austrians the question arose as to the future government of Milan and Italy. Cattaneo was an uncompromising republican and a federalist; so violent was his dislike of the Piedmontese monarchy that when he heard that King Charles Albert had been defeated by the Austrians, and that Radetzky was marching back to reoccupy Milan, he exclaimed:\n\nGood news, the Piedmontese have been beaten. Now we shall be our own masters; we shall fight a people's war, we shall chase the Austrians out of Italy, and set up a Federal Republic.\n\nWhen the Austrians returned, Cattaneo had to flee and took refuge in Lugano, where he gave lessons, wrote his Storia della Rivoluzione del 1848 (History of the 1848 Revolution), the Archivio triennale delle cose d'Italia (3 vols., 1850–1855), then, early in 1860, he started publishing the Politecnico once more. He strongly opposed Cavour for his unitarian views, and for the cession of Nice and Savoy. In 1860 Garibaldi summoned him to Naples to take part in the government of the Neapolitan provinces, but he would not agree to the union with Piedmont without local autonomy. After the union of Italy he was frequently asked to stand for parliament, but always refused because he could not conscientiously take the oath of allegiance to the monarchy. In 1868 the pressure of friends overcame his resistance, and he agreed to stand, but at the last moment he drew back, still unable to take the oath, and returned to Lugano, where he died in 1869.\n\nAs a writer, Cattaneo was learned and brilliant, but some view him as being too bitter a partisan to be judicious, owing to his narrowly republican views; his ideas on local autonomy were wise, but, at a moment when unity was regarded as an absolute requisite, they were deemed inopportune.\n\nHe died in Castagnola, close to Lugano in the Swiss canton of Ticino, where he had spent the last twenty years of his life in exile.\n\n\n\nNorberto Bobbio, \"Una filosofia militante: studi su Carlo Cattaneo\", Einaudi, Torino 1971.\n"}

A member of the Romanian Academy after 1923, he was its vice president in 1935–1938, 1941–1944, and its president between 1938 and 1941.\n\nBorn in Butoieşti, Mehedinţi County, he was the son of Radu Poppescu, whose natural father was Eufrosin Poteca, and Judita Butoi. His mother died during childbirth, and Radu Poppescu married Ecaterina Cernăianu, who gave birth to Constantin's nine half-siblings.\n\nDuring his childhood, Constantin fell ill with malaria. He also fractured a leg, resulting in a permanent physical impediment.\n\nRadu Poppescu, who worked as a secretary for Poteca for part of his life, inherited a certain sum after the death of his employer and father; this was to take the form of a scholarship for Constantin Rădulescu. He ultimately refused to make use of it, indicating that he would use instead revenue from his estate in Butoieşti; the scholarship was eventually awarded to Gheorghe Ţiţeica, the renowned mathematician.\n\nIn 1885, he graduated from Carol I High School in Craiova, and subsequently entered the University of Bucharest, applying to both its Faculty of Law and Faculty of Letters. He was taught by Titu Maiorescu, who was to become his mentor, and attended lectures by Constantin Dumitrescu-Iaşi, V. A. Urechia, Grigore Tocilescu, and Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu. He was part of the last generation of intellectuals to participate in the activities of the \"Junimea\" literary society (where Maiorescu had endured as the major influence).\n\nRădulescu-Motru was awarded a law degree \"magna cum laude\" in 1888, and passed his philosophy exam the following year.\n\nIn the summer of 1889, he accompanied Maiorescu on a trip to Austria-Hungary, Germany, and Switzerland, notably visiting the University of Vienna and the University of Munich, establishing contacts with German academics. This brought his inclusion into the last stage of a program initiated by Maiorescu as the Kingdom of Romania's Minister of Education: alongside other important cultural and scientific figures (such as Alexandru A. Philippide, Ştefan Zeletin, Ion Rădulescu-Pogoneanu, Iorgu Iordan, Simion Mehedinţi, Nicolae Bănescu, P. P. Negulescu, Teohari Antonescu, and Constantin Litzica), he was given official assistance in order complete his education abroad (in order to provide Romania with a new generation of academics). Initially, he directed his interest towards studies in France, attending Henry Beaunis' lectures in psychology at the University of Paris during the fall of 1899.\n\nBetween 1890 and 1893, Rădulescu settled in Germany – he lived in Munich and studied at the university for one semester (as a student of Carl Stumpf), and then moved to Leipzig, where he began working in the laboratory of Wilhelm Wundt at the local university. While completing his training with Wundt, he attended classes in physics, physiology, chemistry, psychiatry, and mathematics, as well as Gustav Weigand's lectures in Romanian philology. He married a German woman, who later refused to accompany him back to Romania; they eventually divorced. He took his doctorate in 1893, with a thesis on Immanuel Kant's philosophy (\"Zur Entwickelung von Kant's Theorie der Naturkausalität\"), one notably quoted by Henri Bergson in his \"Introduction à la Métaphysique\".\n\nAfter 1897, Spiru Haret, he served on the editorial board of Spiru Haret's \"Albina\" popular science magazine. On January 1, 1900, he also founded and edited \"Noua Revistă Română\" (which published articles by, among others, Nicolae Iorga, Ion Luca Caragiale, George Coşbuc, Lazăr Şăineanu, Ioan Nădejde, Ovid Densusianu, H. Sanielevici, and Garabet Ibrăileanu). Appointed to the chair of Philosophy at the University of Bucharest in 1906 (after three years of employment at the cultural foundation created by King Carol I), he was also the founder of the review \"Studii filosofice\" (later renamed \"Revista de filosofie\"), and, in 1918, became head of the National Theatre Bucharest.\n\nIn 1923, Rădulescu-Motru joined Virgil Madgearu, Constantin Costa-Foru, Victor Eftimiu, Grigore Iunian, Radu D. Rosetti, Dem I. Dobrescu, and the socialists Constantin Titel Petrescu, Nicolae L. Lupu, and Constantin Mille, in creating \"Liga Drepturilor Omului\" (the League for Human Rights), protesting against measures taken by the National Liberal cabinet of Ion I. C. Brătianu in dealing with left-wing opposition forces. In 1925, Rădulescu-Motru, Nicolae Basilescu, and Traian Bratu were part of a government-appointed committee investigating the roles of A. C. Cuza and Corneliu Şumuleanu in the anti-Semitic violence having occurred at the University of Iaşi in 1923-1925.\n\nInitially a conservative, he became active inside the newly created National Peasants' Party towards the end of the 1920s, and adapted the group's advocacy of a peasant state that would favour small-scale agricultural property (an echo of Poporanism), while taking a more centrist stand than his friend Madgearu. A member of the party's Study Circle, he took part in drafting a new party program (a 1935 initiative taken by Ion Mihalache and Mihai Ralea, it also involved the left-wingers Ernest Ene, Mihail Ghelmegeanu, and Petre Andrei).\n\nIt was at this time that his ideas on ethnicity (\"Romanianism\") came to be debated by various figures on the Right, and were the subject of virulent criticism from intellectuals sympathetic to the fascist Iron Guard, who notably rejected his commitment to secularism and Maiorescu's \"Junimea\" tradition (Mircea Vulcănescu spoke against \"his hostile attitude, shared by his \"Junimist\" colleagues, against the penetration of a new, religious spirit, inside the University [of Bucharest]\"), as well as from the nationalist modernist Lucian Blaga. According to a later assessment of his work by Vulcănescu, who had since become influenced by the centrist National Peasants' Party member Dimitrie Gusti, the latter's outlook on sociology was also in disagreement with Rădulescu-Motru's adherence to \"Junimist\" guidelines.\n\nToward the end of the 1930s, Rădulescu-Motru was involved in a dispute with the far right philosopher Nae Ionescu, who, although appointed his assistant at the Philosophy department, had begun to criticize his views in the pro-Iron Guard journal \"Cuvântul\"; writing to Mircea Eliade in 1938, he accused Ionescu of various unacademic practices, including using lectures on Logic to promote \"a sort of dilettante mysticism\".\n\nThe President of the Academy at the moment when Carol II assumed dictatorial powers, he chose to support the new National Renaissance Front (FRN) regime, and moved away from party politics. He remained in office after Carol's fall from power of and the establishment of the Iron Guard's National Legionary State government; in the autumn of 1940, as Madgearu and Nicolae Iorga, who had been assassinated by the Guard's armed groups, were being buried, he led the delegation of Academy members who defied the policies of Horia Sima by attending the funeral. During World War II, he was supportive of the dictatorship of Ion Antonescu and Romania's alliance with Nazi Germany against the Soviet Union. As late as 1944 he abhorred the attempts of the Romanian opposition to negotiate the country's switch to the camp of the United Nations. Even after the war, in his personal journals he continued to adopt a position sympathetic to the Romanian and Nazi war criminals, dismissing the Nuremberg Trials and the People's Tribunals.\n\nCritical of Romania's exit from the Axis Powers during World War II (\"see Romania during World War II\"), he was alarmed by the Soviet advances and the eventual occupation; in his private notes, he deplored the fact that Romania failed to adopt the Marshall Plan. In June 1948, six months after the establishment of a communist regime, Rădulescu-Motru was among the members of the Academy purged by the new authorities (he was reinstated post-mortem in 1990). Despite his protests, his entire work was dismissed by official Stalinist rhetoric as \"idealism\".\n\nHe was denied employment in his field of expertise, until two years before his death, when he was admitted to the minor post of researcher at the Psychology Institute; according to his biographer N. Bagdasar, his final years were marked by extreme poverty. Granted assistance following the interventions of Miron Constantinescu and Constantin Ion Parhon, Rădulescu-Motru was hospitalized in a Bucharest clinic for much of his final years. He died while in there, and was buried in Bellu cemetery.\n\nInfluenced by Wilhelm Wundt's theories on introspection, Rădulescu-Motru moved away from Kantian philosophy and its tenet regarding the impossibility of transcending reality as perceived through the senses. He considered metaphysics to be open to objective scrutiny, and placed their knowledge at the summit of philosophical approaches.\n\nStating that there was, in effect, a unity between person and material nature, Rădulescu-Motru developed his own version of Personalism, which thought of the human being and its personality as the goal of evolution in nature – a theory he called \"Energetic Personalism\". He recognized the influence of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel's views on the relation between being and the whole, arguing that his idealist concept of externalization (\"the belief that the world is being led by our ideal\", which he deemed \"transitory Personalism\") had been the driving force behind all modern ideologies, from Socialism and Anarchism to Liberalism (\"see Right Hegelians and Left Hegelians\").\n\nOwing to Wundt's \"Völkerpsychologie\", Rădulescu-Motru dedicated much of his work to assessing and defining nationalism in Romanian social context. Concentrating his analysis on the impact of modernization and Westernization, he argued for a need to adapt forms to the Romanian ethnicity (which he defined through heredity), and represented as the true social fundament (the \"community of spirit\"). He supported the existence of human races and differences among them, as well as eugenics, even after the defeat of Nazi Germany led to the abandonment of such theories in the mainstream scientific world.\n\nIn his \"Cultura română şi politicianismul\" (\"Romanian culture and petty politics\"), he devised a hierarchy of cultures, placing Western civilization at the top of the scale, and the Far East at its bottom; he later confessed to Mircea Eliade his reticence in dealing with Hindu philosophy (conversations between the two centered instead on Indian nationalism in general and \"Satyagraha\" in particular). The system placed Romania in the margin of European progress, still subject to adopting cultural forms from Western societies:\n\"Nowhere have bourgeois institutions stemmed out of natural spiritual needs of the peoples, but rather out of the needs of capitalism; the complete harmonizing of these institutions with the popular psyche was a gradual, difficult enterprise, the more so in our country, where the dazzling development of capitalism has left the spiritual evolution, always more laborious, far behind.\"\n\nElsewhere, he argued that, despite a traditional pattern of individualism, Romanians lacked \"initiative in economic and social life, the two characteristics traits of individualism as experienced by the cultured Western peoples and constituting bourgeois spirit\"; according to him, the common folk relied on collective work, which had ensured the survival of village communities during \"cursed centuries\" (maintaining the mobility of villages \"from plain to mountains\", but preventing their actual breakup during the medieval period).\n\nIn his chapters on the universal suffrage, the parliamentary system, and the Romanian Constitution of 1923, Rădulescu-Motru expanded on this fundamentally conservative thesis, arguing that such reforms had come too soon to be properly integrated. The main danger he saw in the process was the appearance of \"petty politics\" (\"politicianism\"), which, he argued, had a potential of destroying natural developments inside the nation.\n\nTaking in view the characteristics of this evolution towards petty politics, he vehemently rejected Mihai Eminescu's theory on the almost exclusively foreign origin of the bourgeoisie inside the post-Phanariote Old Kingdom. Instead, Rădulescu-Motru expanded on Titu Maiorescu's criticism of \"forms without fundament\" (in reference to the discrepancy between the Westernized facade and the underdeveloped economic and social setting), viewing the class of low-ranking boyars, increasingly attracted to Liberal currents during the 19th century, as the main agents of incoherent change – this attracted him the criticism of the Poporanist Garabet Ibrăileanu, who argued that \"Junimea\" was an exclusivist school of criticism that \"has never said [of foreign models] what, how much, and when should be imported\". In this context, Ibrăileanu emphasized the gestures of boyars before and during the \"Organic Regulation\" government, as indicative of a skeptical nationalist mood (rather than of a cosmopolitan ideology).\n\nWith \"Învăţământul filosofic în România\" (\"Philosophical education in Romania\"), his 1931 essay first published in \"Convorbiri Literare\", Rădulescu-Motru introduced a polemic that was to mark numerous other writings of his during the following period: reacting to the growth in appeal of far right magazines that claimed to follow a Romanian Orthodox philosophy – \"Cuvântul\" and \"Gândirea\" –, he made a difference between a \"belletristic\" trend in higher learning and a \"scientific\" one, arguing in favour of the latter, and presenting the former as the objective source of anti-intellectualist attitudes he observed inside the new political phenomenon (which emphasized the \"human need for mystery\"). In essence, the secularist Rădulescu-Motru followed the \"Junimea\" tradition of rejecting mysticism, viewing it as the unwanted characteristic of a working class mentality.\n\nHe questioned the subjective approaches of Lucian Blaga, Nichifor Crainic, and Nae Ionescu: developing his \"Romanianism\", Rădulescu-Motru stated his support for cultural and national dialogue (\"and not the isolation of each people in its own ethnicity\"), and for the ultimate integration of Romanian culture in the highest section of European culture. He even argued that principles supported by the Right in defining Romanian specificity were in fact being shared with other cultures (answering Blaga's emphasis on Romanian folklore, he pointed out that its themes were commonplace in neighbouring Balkan cultures; replying to Ionescu's views on allegedly particular tendencies toward theology and metaphysics inside national culture, he stated his belief that \"the prestige of the metaphor, the attraction towards mystery and the ontology of the ethnos [...] only show themselves from the second quarter of the 20th century onwards, [and are under the influence of] foreign university circles [...]\"; he also rejected Crainic's views on Orthodoxy as the source for specificity, arguing for Christian universalism in detriment of \"nationalist spirituality\" – an idea nevertheless interpreted by Crainic as evidence of \"militant philosophical atheism\").\n\nAfter joining the National Peasants' Party, Rădulescu-Motru maintained a particular approach towards the group's doctrines and policies after 1935: adapting his criticism of individualism (a trait he associated with the National Liberals) to the Poporanist doctrine of the \"peasant state\", he defined the latter as necessarily \"totalitarian\":\n\"[It] differs from other totalitarian states in that it sets among its norms, first and foremost, the preeminence of the permanent interests of the peasant population. Unlike the Fascist, the National-Socialist, and the Soviet states, it believes that it can serve the totality of the population it is supposed to govern, not on the basis of a glorious imperialist tradition, or through the cultivation of a race relation, or through industrial structuring on the basis of a dictatorial plan, but through the creation of a healthy, moral, and labouring peasantry, ready to defend the country's borders as the geographical and historical conditions demand it.\"\n\nA pro-authoritarian critic soon reproached that such an ideal, despite its aim to compete with purely nationalist trends, was in fact social class-based, and its \"numerical, that is to say democratic\" definition (around the argument that peasants formed the majority in Romania) was leading to \"peasant anarchy\".\n\nRădulescu-Motru came to support Carol II's National Renaissance Front (FRN) and the one-party system in 1938, speaking out in favour of the kings' initiative to introduce uniforms for members of the Academy (clashing over the matter with his fellow academic Nicolae Iorga, in February 1939).\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "40359", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40359", "title": "Due process", "text": "Due process\n\nDue process is the legal requirement that the state must respect all legal rights that are owed to a person. Due process balances the power of law of the land and protects the individual person from it. When a government harms a person without following the exact course of the law, this constitutes a due process violation, which offends the rule of law.\n\nDue process has also been frequently interpreted as limiting laws and legal proceedings (see substantive due process) so that judges, instead of legislators, may define and guarantee fundamental fairness, justice, and liberty. That interpretation has proven controversial. Analogous to the concepts of natural justice, and procedural justice used in various other jurisdictions, the interpretation of due process is sometimes expressed as a command that the government must not be unfair to the people or abuse them physically.\nThe term is not used in contemporary English law, but two similar concepts are natural justice, which generally applies only to decisions of administrative agencies and some types of private bodies like trade unions, and the British constitutional concept of the rule of law as articulated by A. V. Dicey and others. However, neither concept lines up perfectly with the American theory of due process, which, as explained below, presently contains many implied rights not found in either ancient or modern concepts of due process in England.\n\nDue process developed from clause 39 of Magna Carta in England. Reference to due process first appeared in a statutory rendition of clause 39 in 1354 thus: \"No man of what state or condition he be, shall be put out of his lands or tenements nor taken, nor disinherited, nor put to death, without he be brought to answer by due process of law.\" When English and American law gradually diverged, due process was not upheld in England but became incorporated in the US Constitution.\n\nIn clause 39 of Magna Carta, issued in 1215, John of England promised: \"No free man shall be seized or imprisoned, or stripped of his rights or possessions, or outlawed or exiled, or deprived of his standing in any other way, nor will we proceed with force against him, or send others to do so, except by the lawful judgment of his equals or by the law of the land.\" Magna Carta itself immediately became part of the \"law of the land\", and Clause 61 of that charter authorized an elected body of 25 barons to determine by majority vote what redress the King must provide when the King offends \"in any respect against any man.\" Thus, Magna Carta established the rule of law in England by not only requiring the monarchy to obey the law of the land but also limiting how the monarchy could change the law of the land. However, in the 13th century, the provisions may have been referring only to the rights of landowners, and not to ordinary peasantry or villagers.\n\nShorter versions of Magna Carta were subsequently issued by British monarchs, and Clause 39 of Magna Carta was renumbered \"29.\" The phrase \"due process of law\" first appeared in a statutory rendition of Magna Carta in 1354 during the reign of Edward III of England, as follows: \"No man of what state or condition he be, shall be put out of his lands or tenements nor taken, nor disinherited, nor put to death, without he be brought to answer by due process of law.\"\n\nIn 1608, the English jurist Edward Coke wrote a treatise in which he discussed the meaning of Magna Carta. Coke explained that no man shall be deprived but by \"legem terrae\", the law of the land, \"that is, by the common law, statute law, or custom of England... (that is, to speak it once and for all) by the due course, and process of law..\"\n\nBoth the clause in Magna Carta and the later statute of 1354 were again explained in 1704 (during the reign of Queen Anne) by the Queen's Bench, in the case of \"Regina v. Paty\". In that case, the British House of Commons had deprived John Paty and certain other citizens of the right to vote in an election and committed them to Newgate Prison merely for the offense of pursuing a legal action in the courts. The Queen's Bench, in an opinion by Justice Powys, explained the meaning of \"due process of law\" as follows:\nChief Justice Holt dissented in this case because he believed that the commitment had not in fact been by a legal authority. The House of Commons had purported to legislate unilaterally, without approval of the British House of Lords, ostensibly to regulate the election of its members. Although the Queen's Bench held that the House of Commons had not infringed or overturned due process, John Paty was ultimately freed by Queen Anne when she prorogued Parliament.\n\nThroughout centuries of British history, many laws and treatises asserted various requirements as being part of \"due process\" or included in the \"law of the land\". That view usually held in regards to what was required by existing law, rather than what was intrinsically required by due process itself. As the United States Supreme Court has explained, a due process requirement in Britain was not \"essential to the idea of due process of law in the prosecution and punishment of crimes, but was only mentioned as an example and illustration of due process of law as it actually existed in cases in which it was customarily used.\"\n\nUltimately, the scattered references to \"due process of law\" in English law did not limit the power of the government; in the words of American law professor John V. Orth, \"the great phrases failed to retain their vitality.\" Orth points out that this is generally attributed to the rise of the doctrine of parliamentary supremacy in the United Kingdom, which was accompanied by hostility towards judicial review as an undemocratic foreign invention.\n\nScholars have occasionally interpreted Lord Coke's ruling in \"Dr. Bonham's Case\" as implying the possibility of judicial review, but by the 1870s, Lord Campbell was dismissing judicial review as \"a foolish doctrine alleged to have been laid down extra-judicially in Dr. Bonham's Case..., a conundrum [that] ought to have been laughed at.\"\nLacking the power of judicial review, English courts possessed no means by which to declare government statutes or actions invalid as a violation of due process. In contrast, American legislators and executive branch officers possessed virtually no means by which to overrule judicial invalidation of statutes or actions as due process violations, with the sole exception of proposing a constitutional amendment, which are rarely successful. As a consequence, English law and American law diverged. Unlike their English counterparts, American judges became increasingly assertive about enforcing due process of law. In turn, the legislative and executive branches learned how to avoid such confrontations in the first place, by tailoring statutes and executive actions to the constitutional requirements of due process as elaborated upon by the judiciary.\n\nIn 1977, an English political science professor explained the present situation in England for the benefit of American lawyers:\nAn American constitutional lawyer might well be surprised by the elusiveness of references to the term 'due process of law' in the general body of English legal writing... Today one finds no space devoted to due process in Halsbury's \"Laws of England\", in Stephen's \"Commentaries\", or Anson's \"Law and Custom of the Constitution.\" The phrase rates no entry in such works as Stroud's \"Judicial Dictionary\" or Wharton's \"Law Lexicon.\"\n\nTwo similar concepts in contemporary English law are natural justice, which generally applies only to decisions of administrative agencies and some types of private bodies like trade unions, and the British constitutional concept of the rule of law as articulated by A. V. Dicey and others. However, neither concept lines up perfectly with the American conception of due process, which presently contains many implied rights not found in the ancient or modern concepts of due process in England.\n\nThe Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution each contain a Due Process Clause. Due process deals with the administration of justice and thus the Due Process Clause acts as a safeguard from arbitrary denial of life, liberty, or property by the government outside the sanction of law. The Supreme Court of the United States interprets the clauses as providing four protections: procedural due process (in civil and criminal proceedings), substantive due process, a prohibition against vague laws, and as the vehicle for the incorporation of the Bill of Rights.\n\nVarious countries recognize some form of due process under customary international law. Although the specifics are often unclear, most nations agree that they should guarantee foreign visitors a basic minimum level of justice and fairness. Some nations have argued that they are bound to grant no more rights to aliens than they do to their own citizens, the doctrine of national treatment, which also means that both would be vulnerable to the same deprivations by the government. With the growth of international human rights law and the frequent use of treaties to govern treatment of foreign nationals abroad, the distinction, in practice, between these two perspectives may be disappearing.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "210105", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=210105", "title": "Edmund Gettier", "text": "Edmund Gettier\n\nEdmund L. Gettier III (; born October 31, 1927) is an American philosopher and Professor Emeritus at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. He is best known for his short 1963 article \"Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?\", which has generated an extensive philosophical literature trying to respond to what became known as the Gettier problem.\n\nGettier was educated at Cornell University, where his mentors included Max Black and Norman Malcolm. Gettier, himself, was originally attracted to the opinions of the later Ludwig Wittgenstein. His first teaching job was at Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan, where his colleagues included Keith Lehrer, R. C. Sleigh, and Alvin Plantinga. Because he had few publications, his colleagues urged him to publish any ideas he had just to satisfy the administration. The result was a three-page article that remains one of the most famous in recent philosophical history. According to anecdotal comments that Plantinga has given in lectures, Gettier was originally so unenthusiastic about the article that he had someone translate it into Spanish and published it first in a South American journal. The article was later published in Analysis. Gettier has since not published anything, but he has invented and taught to his graduate students new methods for finding and illustrating countermodels in modal logic, as well as simplified semantics for various modal logics.\n\nIn his article, Gettier challenges the \"justified true belief\" definition of knowledge that dates back to Plato's \"Theaetetus\", but is discounted at the end of that very dialogue. This account was accepted by most philosophers at the time, most prominently the epistemologist Clarence Irving Lewis and his student Roderick Chisholm. Gettier's article offered counter-examples to this account in the form of cases such that subjects had true beliefs that were also justified, but for which the beliefs were true for reasons unrelated to the justification. Some philosophers, however, thought the account of knowledge as justified true belief had already been questioned in a general way by the work of Wittgenstein. (Later, a similar argument was found in the papers of Bertrand Russell.)\n\nGettier provides several examples of beliefs that are both true and justified, but that we should not intuitively term knowledge. Cases of this sort are now termed \"Gettier (counter-)examples\". Because Gettier's criticism of the justified true belief model is systemic, other authors have imagined increasingly fantastical counterexamples. For example: I am watching the men's Wimbledon Final, and John McEnroe is playing Jimmy Connors, it is match point, and McEnroe wins. I say to myself: \"John McEnroe is this year's men's champion at Wimbledon\". Unbeknownst to me, however, the BBC were experiencing a broadcasting fault and so had broadcast a tape of last year's final, when McEnroe also beat Connors. I had been watching last year's Wimbledon final, so I believed that McEnroe had bested Connors. But at that same time, in real life, McEnroe was repeating last year's victory and besting Connors! So my belief that McEnroe bested Connors to become this year's Wimbledon champion is true, and I had good reason to believe so (my belief was justified) — and yet, there is a sense in which I could not really have claimed to \"know\" that McEnroe had bested Connors because I was only accidentally right that McEnroe beat Connors — my belief was not based on the right kind of justification.\n\nGettier inspired a great deal of work by philosophers attempting to recover a working definition of knowledge. Major responses include:\n\nA 2001 study by Weinberg, Nichols, and Stich suggests that the effect of the Gettier problem varies by culture. In particular, people from Western countries seem more likely to agree with the judgments described in the story than do those from East Asia. Subsequent studies were unable to replicate these results.\n\n\n\n"}

All worldly knowledge takes the form of mental representations that our mind examines in different ways. Direct contact with reality cannot be made outside of our own minds; therefore, we cannot be sure reality even exists. This means that we are each limited to our own perceptual world and views. Solipsism is an extension of this which assumes that only one's own mind is sure to exist.\n\nSince 1710, when George Berkeley broached in his fashion the problem of the egocentric predicament, denying the existence of material substance except as ideas in the minds of perceivers, and thus asserting a problematical relation with reality, hence has this thesis proved a stumbling block.\n\nSamuel Johnson is well known for his \"refutation\" of Bishop Berkeley's immaterialism, his claim that matter did not actually exist but only seemed to exist: during a conversation with Boswell, Johnson powerfully stomped a nearby stone and proclaimed of Berkeley's theory, \"I refute it \"thus\"!\"\n\nBoth Perry's concept and the term he used influenced American philosopher, Everett W.

Vilas Research Professor in the Department of Philosophy at University of Wisconsin–Madison. Sober is noted for his work in philosophy of biology and general philosophy of science.\n\nSober earned his Ph.D in philosophy from Harvard University under the supervision of Hilary Putnam, after doing graduate work at Cambridge University under the supervision of Mary Hesse. His work has also been strongly influenced by the biologist Richard Lewontin, and he has collaborated with David Sloan Wilson, Steven Orzack and Mike Steel, also biologists.\n\nSober has served as the president of both the Central Division of the American Philosophical Association and the Philosophy of Science Association. He was president of the International Union of History and Philosophy of Science \n(Division of Logic, Methodology, and Philosophy of Science) from 2012 until 2015. He taught for one year at Stanford University and has been a regular visiting professor at the London School of Economics.\n\nSince 2013, Sober has been listed on the Advisory Council of the National Center for Science Education.\n\nOne of Sober's main fields of research has been the subject of simplicity or parsimony in connection with theory evaluation in science. Sober also has been interested in altruism, both as the concept is used in evolutionary biology and also as it is used in connection with human psychology. His book with David Sloan Wilson, \"Unto Others: the Evolution and Psychology of Unselfish Behavior\" (1998), addresses both topics.\n\nSober has been a prominent critic of intelligent design. He also has written about evidence and probability, scientific realism and instrumentalism, laws of nature, the mind-body problem and naturalism.\n\nSober's \"The Nature of Selection: Evolutionary Theory in Philosophical Focus\" (1984) has been instrumental in establishing the philosophy of biology as a prominent research area in philosophy. According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, \"\"The Nature of Selection\"...marks the point at which most philosophers became aware of the philosophy of biology.\" In his review of the book, biologist Ernst Mayr wrote \"Sober has ... given us what is perhaps the most careful and penetrating analysis of the concept of natural selection as it affects the process of evolution\".\n\nSober's first publication on parsimony was his 1975 book, \"Simplicity\". In it, he argued that the simplicity of a hypothesis should be understood in terms of a concept of question-relative informativeness. Sober abandoned this theory in the 1980s when he started to think about the concept of cladistic parsimony used in evolutionary biology. This led him to think of parsimony in terms of the concept of likelihood, an idea he developed in his 1988 book \"Reconstructing the Past: Parsimony, Evolution, and Inference\". In the 1990s he started to think about the role of parsimony in model selection theory—for example, in the Akaike Information Criterion. He published a series of articles in this area with Malcolm Forster, the first of which was their 1994 paper \"How to Tell When Simpler, More Unified, or Less Ad Hoc Theories Will Provide More Accurate Predictions.\" His most recent publication on parsimony, his 2015 book \"Ockham's Razors: A User's Manual\", describes both the likelihood framework and the model selection frameworks as two viable \"parsimony paradigms.\"\n\n\n"}

Examples of the exact sciences are mathematics, optics, astronomy, and physics, which many philosophers from Descartes, Leibniz, and Kant to the logical positivists took as paradigms of rational and objective knowledge. These sciences have been practiced in many cultures from Antiquity to modern times. Given their ties to mathematics, the exact sciences are characterized by accurate quantitative expression, precise predictions and/or rigorous methods of testing hypotheses involving quantifiable predictions and measurements.\n\nThe distinction between the quantitative exact sciences and those sciences which deal with the causes of things is due to Aristotle, who distinguished mathematics from natural philosophy and considered the exact sciences to be the \"more natural of the branches of mathematics.\" Thomas Aquinas employed this distinction when he pointed out that astronomy explains the spherical shape of the Earth by mathematical reasoning while physics explains it by material causes. This distinction was widely, but not universally, accepted until the scientific revolution of the Seventeenth Century. Edward Grant has proposed that a fundamental change leading to the new sciences was the unification of the exact sciences and physics by Kepler, Newton, and others, which resulted in a quantitative investigation of the physical causes of natural phenomena.\n\n"}

Daniel Chandler defines the term as \"a signifier with a vague, highly variable, unspecifiable or non-existent signified\". As such a \"floating signifier\" may \"mean different things to different people: they may stand for many or even any signifieds; they may mean whatever their interpreters want them to mean\". Such a floating signifier—which is said to possess \"symbolic value zero\"—necessarily results to \"allow symbolic thought to operate despite the contradiction inherent in it\". In Emancipation(s), Ernesto Laclau frames empty signifier a context of social interactions. For Laclau, empty signifier is the hegemonic representative of a collection of various demands, constituting a chain of equivalence whose members are distinguished through a differential logic (as in elements exist only in their differences to one another) but combine through an equivalential one. This chain of unsatisfied demands create an unfulfilled totality, inside of which one signifier subordinates the rest and assumes representation of the rest via a hegemonic process.\n\nThe notion of floating signifiers can be applied to concepts such as race and gender, as a way of asserting that the word is more concrete than the concept it describes, where the concept may not be stable, but the word is. It is often applied to non-linguistic signs, such as the example of the Rorschach inkblot test. Roland Barthes, while not using the term \"floating signifier\" explicitly, referred specifically to non-linguistic signs as being so open to interpretation that they constituted a \"floating chain of signifieds.\" For example, the American flag is at once a signifier of the geographical nation it represents, of patriotism to that nation, of the nation's set of governmental policies, and/or of the ideologies associated with it, such as liberty. Depending on the context, the flag can carry either positive \"or\" negative significance.\n\nThe concept is used in some more textual forms of postmodernism, which rejects the strict anchoring of particular signifiers to particular signifieds and argues against the concept that there are any ultimate determinable meanings to words or signs. For example, Jacques Derrida speaks of the \"freeplay\" of signifiers: arguing that they are not fixed to their signifieds but point beyond themselves to other signifiers in an \"indefinite referral of signifier to signified.\"\n\n\n\n"}

The fast phase, in which most of the extension occurs, takes about 25 minutes. The remaining extension continues during the slow phase and is completed in the following 70 minutes. During this process the ventral germ-band extends around the posterior end of the embryo, effectively folding over onto the dorsal side of the egg. Multiple individual cells intercalating mediolateral to the anterior-posterior axis drive the resulting global elongation of the embryo. In addition, cell shape changes, and oriented cell divisions in the posterior germ-band are in part required for full elongation. However, elongation of the body axis seems to be primarily linked to changes in cell neighbor relations.\n\nThis article describes axis elongation in \"Drosophila\". However, the basis of germ-band elongation is applicable to many organisms including other invertebrates and vertebrates alike.\n\nIn order for cells to intercalate between one another the adherens junctions that maintain the integrity of the epithelial tissue must be dynamically remodeled. Time-lapse microscopy has captured this process of cell neighbor exchange, which is schematically represented to the right. In the type 1 configuration, two cells contact each other along the anterior-posterior axis, whereas two dorsal-ventral cells do not directly contact. Next, the cell boundary between the two anterior-posterior neighbors selectively shrinks, resulting in an obligatory intermediate type 2 junction, where the four cells share a vertex. Upon resolution of the type 2 junction, a new type 3 junctions forms perpendicular to the original type 1 configuration. During this process the two dorsal-ventral cells have become neighbors. When multiple clusters of cells intercalate in the dorsal-ventral axis, through junctional neighbor exchange, the outcome is an extension of germ-band in the anterior-posterior axis.\n\nIn addition to the simple neighbor exchange, higher-ordered rosette formations have been observed in which five or more cells meet at a vertex. Multicellular rosettes form and resolve in a directional fashion that promotes germ-band elongation. Neighbor exchange and multicellular rosette formation involve oriented junctional remodeling, which indicates that the intercalating cells are intrinsically polarized within the plane of the epithelium.\n\nThe dorsal-ventral intercalation of cells during germ-band extension ultimately arises from the asymmetric localization of proteins within individual cells. Immunofluorescence reveals that non-muscle Myosin II localizes to the anterior-posterior boundaries of cells, destabilizing adherens junctions, whereas the Bazooka/Par-3 complex localizes to dorsal-ventral boundaries, stabilizing adherens junctions. Moreover, \"bazooka\" mutants are defective in germ-band extension, which supports the idea that polarized protein localization is critical for cell rearrangements. One mechanism by which Myosin II might promote polarized cell remodeling is through contractile activity that creates tension orienting junctional disassembly. However, the precise mechanism in which asymmetrically localized protein complexes encourage directed intercalation remains disputed.\n\nThe source that establishes planar polarity during germ-band extension remains elusive. Polarized intercalation is largely unaffected in mutant embryos that lack dorsal-ventral cell types. Yet, mutations that disrupt segmental patterning along the anterior-posterior axis, such as \"eve\" and \"runt\", decrease cell intercalation and subsequent germ-band elongation. Furthermore, ectopic expression of eve or runt is sufficient to locally reorient the polarity of nearby cells. This evidence argues that planar polarity is established by cell-cell interactions, and not by a long-range polarizing cue. Thus, polarizing information can spread from one cell to the next, downstream of an Eve-dependent signal that remains to be identified.\n\nResearchers suggest that mesoderm invagination provides an anterior-posterior pulling force that contributes to germ-band extension through passive cell shape changes. Although anterior-posterior patterning mutants fail to fully extend their germ-bands, during the fast phase the elongation length is normal despite defects in polarized cell intercalation. Time-lapse analysis revealed that an increase in cell shape stretching in the anterior-posterior axis was compensating for aberrant cell intercalation, independent of anterior-posterior patterning. Furthermore, during wild type development, it has been suggested that intercalary cell behavior relaxes the stress imposed on the germ-band, allowing stretched cells to restore to isometric shapes.\n\nIn addition, there is evidence that mechanical tension is necessary and sufficient for the cortical localization of Myosin II. Thus, not only can Myosin II generate tension but it may also be up-regulated by tensile forces, creating a positive feedback loop that allows cells to dynamically respond to fluctuations in their mechanical environment.\n\n"}

Giants were a popular theme in theosophical literature, Atlantis, lost continents and later the earth mysteries movement of Britain in the 1970s. \n\nThe concept of giants was discussed by the theosophist and occult author Blavatsky who wrote about the existence of giants in her book \"The Secret Doctrine\" connecting them to her theory of root races and claiming they correspond with Hindu cycle of the universe. According to theosophists, ape-like giants were the third root race who lived on the continent of Lemuria. Theosophists also linked giants to the Atlantean race.\n\nThe German occultist Guido von List was influenced by Blavatsky's writings on giants and mixed together paganism, mythology, and theosophy, creating a basis for the belief in giants living in different realms based on the first four rounds of the root race theory. \n\nR. A. Schwaller de Lubicz, an Egyptologist and traditionalist, believed that giants had roamed the earth, and that after the fall of Adam, humanity fell into a state of degeneration.\n\nLewis Spence, a writer on mythology, was critical of theosophy but accepted the existence of giants. He researched English folklore and mythology depicting such giants such as Magog and the British giant Albion. Another writer who was opposed to occultism was the British journalist and author William Comyns Beaumont. Like Spence, he accepted the existence of giants based on folklore, mythology, and archeology. Beaumont believed that Britain was the location of Atlantis and that it was occupied by a giant race of Aryans. \n\nIn the 1970s many of the authors of the earth mysteries movement in Britain wrote about Giants. John Michell wrote about the existence of giants in his book \"The View over Atlantis\". Anthony Roberts wrote the book \"Sowers of Thunder: Giants in Myth and History\" in 1978, in which he claimed that giants were the original inhabitants of the British Isles and linked Alfred Watkins' ley lines to the British giants.\n"}
{"id": "12372971", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12372971", "title": "Health belief model", "text": "Health belief model\n\nThe health belief model (HBM) is a psychological health behavior change model developed to explain and predict health-related behaviors, particularly in regard to the uptake of health services. The health belief model was developed in the 1950s by social psychologists at the U.S. Public Health Service and remains one of the best known and most widely used theories in health behavior research. The health belief model suggests that people's beliefs about health problems, perceived benefits of action and barriers to action, and self-efficacy explain engagement (or lack of engagement) in health-promoting behavior. A stimulus, or cue to action, must also be present in order to trigger the health-promoting behavior. \n\nOne of the first theories of health behavior, the health belief model was developed in the 1950s by social psychologists Irwin M. Rosenstock, Godfrey M. Hochbaum, S. Stephen Kegeles, and Howard Leventhal at the U.S. Public Health Service to better understand the widespread failure of screening programs for tuberculosis. The health belief model has been applied to predict a wide variety of health-related behaviors such as being screened for the early detection of asymptomatic diseases and receiving immunizations. More recently, the model has been applied to understand patients' responses to symptoms of disease, compliance with medical regimens, lifestyle behaviors (e.g., sexual risk behaviors), and behaviors related to chronic illnesses, which may require long-term behavior maintenance in addition to initial behavior change. Amendments to the model were made as late as 1988 to incorporate emerging evidence within the field of psychology about the role of self-efficacy in decision-making and behavior.\n\nThe following constructs of the health belief model are proposed to vary between individuals and predict engagement in health-related behaviors (e.g., getting vaccinated, getting screened for asymptomatic diseases, exercising).\n\nPerceived severity refers to the subjective assessment of the severity of a health problem and its potential consequences. The health belief model proposes that individuals who perceive a given health problem as serious are more likely to engage in behaviors to prevent the health problem from occurring (or reduce its severity). Perceived seriousness encompasses beliefs about the disease itself (e.g., whether it is life-threatening or may cause disability or pain) as well as broader impacts of the disease on functioning in work and social roles. For instance, an individual may perceive that influenza is not medically serious, but if he or she perceives that there would be serious financial consequences as a result of being absent from work for several days, then he or she may perceive influenza to be a particularly serious condition.\n\nPerceived susceptibility refers to subjective assessment of risk of developing a health problem. The health belief model predicts that individuals who perceive that they are susceptible to a particular health problem will engage in behaviors to reduce their risk of developing the health problem. Individuals with low perceived susceptibility may deny that they are at risk for contracting a particular illness. Others may acknowledge the possibility that they could develop the illness, but believe it is unlikely. Individuals who believe they are at low risk of developing an illness are more likely to engage in unhealthy, or risky, behaviors. Individuals who perceive a high risk that they will be personally affected by a particular health problem are more likely to engage in behaviors to decrease their risk of developing the condition.\n\nThe combination of perceived severity and perceived susceptibility is referred to as perceived threat. Perceived severity and perceived susceptibility to a given health condition depend on knowledge about the condition. The health belief model predicts that higher perceived threat leads to higher likelihood of engagement in health-promoting behaviors.\n\nHealth-related behaviors are also influenced by the perceived benefits of taking action. Perceived benefits refer to an individual's assessment of the value or efficacy of engaging in a health-promoting behavior to decrease risk of disease. If an individual believes that a particular action will reduce susceptibility to a health problem or decrease its seriousness, then he or she is likely to engage in that behavior regardless of objective facts regarding the effectiveness of the action. For example, individuals who believe that wearing sunscreen prevents skin cancer are more likely to wear sunscreen than individuals who believe that wearing sunscreen will not prevent the occurrence of skin cancer.\n\nHealth-related behaviors are also a function of perceived barriers to taking action. Perceived barriers refer to an individual's assessment of the obstacles to behavior change. Even if an individual perceives a health condition as threatening and believes that a particular action will effectively reduce the threat, barriers may prevent engagement in the health-promoting behavior. In other words, the perceived benefits must outweigh the perceived barriers in order for behavior change to occur. Perceived barriers to taking action include the perceived inconvenience, expense, danger (e.g., side effects of a medical procedure) and discomfort (e.g., pain, emotional upset) involved in engaging in the behavior. For instance, lack of access to affordable health care and the perception that a flu vaccine shot will cause significant pain may act as barriers to receiving the flu vaccine.\n\nIndividual characteristics, including demographic, psychosocial, and structural variables, can affect perceptions (i.e., perceived seriousness, susceptibility, benefits, and barriers) of health-related behaviors. Demographic variables include age, sex, race, ethnicity, and education, among others. Psychosocial variables include personality, social class, and peer and reference group pressure, among others. Structural variables include knowledge about a given disease and prior contact with the disease, among other factors. The health belief model suggests that modifying variables affect health-related behaviors indirectly by affecting perceived seriousness, susceptibility, benefits, and barriers.\n\nThe health belief model posits that a cue, or trigger, is necessary for prompting engagement in health-promoting behaviors. Cues to action can be internal or external. Physiological cues (e.g., pain, symptoms) are an example of internal cues to action. External cues include events or information from close others, the media, or health care providers promoting engagement in health-related behaviors. Examples of cues to action include a reminder postcard from a dentist, the illness of a friend or family member, and product health warning labels. The intensity of cues needed to prompt action varies between individuals by perceived susceptibility, seriousness, benefits, and barriers. For example, individuals who believe they are at high risk for a serious illness and who have an established relationship with a primary care doctor may be easily persuaded to get screened for the illness after seeing a public service announcement, whereas individuals who believe they are at low risk for the same illness and also do not have reliable access to health care may require more intense external cues in order to get screened.\n\nSelf-efficacy was added to the four components of the health belief model (i.e., perceived susceptibility, severity, benefits, and barriers) in 1988. Self-efficacy refers to an individual's perception of his or her competence to successfully perform a behavior. Self-efficacy was added to the health belief model in an attempt to better explain individual differences in health behaviors. The model was originally developed in order to explain engagement in one-time health-related behaviors such as being screened for cancer or receiving an immunization. Eventually, the health belief model was applied to more substantial, long-term behavior change such as diet modification, exercise, and smoking. Developers of the model recognized that confidence in one's ability to effect change in outcomes (i.e., self-efficacy) was a key component of health behavior change.\n\nThe health belief model has gained substantial empirical support since its development in the 1950s. It remains one of the most widely used and well-tested models for explaining and predicting health-related behavior. A 1984 review of 18 prospective and 28 retrospective studies suggests that the evidence for each component of the health belief model is strong. The review reports that empirical support for the health belief model is particularly notable given the diverse populations, health conditions, and health-related behaviors examined and the various study designs and assessment strategies used to evaluate the model. A more recent meta-analysis found strong support for perceived benefits and perceived barriers predicting health-related behaviors, but weak evidence for the predictive power of perceived seriousness and perceived susceptibility. The authors of the meta-analysis suggest that examination of potential moderated and mediated relationships between components of the model is warranted.\n\nThe health belief model has been used to develop effective interventions to change health-related behaviors by targeting various aspects of the model's key constructs. Interventions based on the health belief model may aim to increase perceived susceptibility to and perceived seriousness of a health condition by providing education about prevalence and incidence of disease, individualized estimates of risk, and information about the consequences of disease (e.g., medical, financial, and social consequences). Interventions may also aim to alter the cost-benefit analysis of engaging in a health-promoting behavior (i.e., increasing perceived benefits and decreasing perceived barriers) by providing information about the efficacy of various behaviors to reduce risk of disease, identifying common perceived barriers, providing incentives to engage in health-promoting behaviors, and engaging social support or other resources to encourage health-promoting behaviors. Furthermore, interventions based on the health belief model may provide cues to action to remind and encourage individuals to engage in health-promoting behaviors. Interventions may also aim to boost self-efficacy by providing training in specific health-promoting behaviors, particularly for complex lifestyle changes (e.g., changing diet or physical activity, adhering to a complicated medication regimen). Interventions can be aimed at the individual level (i.e., working one-on-one with individuals to increase engagement in health-related behaviors) or the societal level (e.g., through legislation, changes to the physical environment).\n\nThe health belief model attempts to predict health-related behaviors by accounting for individual differences in beliefs and attitudes. However, it does not account for other factors that influence health behaviors. For instance, habitual health-related behaviors (e.g., smoking, seatbelt buckling) may become relatively independent of conscious health-related decision making processes. Additionally, individuals engage in some health-related behaviors for reasons unrelated to health (e.g., exercising for aesthetic reasons). Environmental factors outside an individual's control may prevent engagement in desired behaviors. For example, an individual living in a dangerous neighborhood may be unable to go for a jog outdoors due to safety concerns. Furthermore, the health belief model does not consider the impact of emotions on health-related behavior. Evidence suggests that fear may be a key factor in predicting health-related behavior.\n\nAlternative factors may predict health behavior, such as outcome expectancy (i.e., whether the person feels they will be healthier as a result of their behavior) and self-efficacy (i.e., the person’s belief in their ability to carry out preventative behavior).\n\nThe theoretical constructs that constitute the health belief model are broadly defined. Furthermore, the health belief model does not specify how constructs of the model interact with one another. Therefore, different operationalizations of the theoretical constructs may not be strictly comparable across studies.\n\nResearch assessing the contribution of cues to action in predicting health-related behaviors is limited. Cues to action are often difficult to assess, limiting research in this area. For instance, individuals may not accurately report cues that prompted behavior change. Cues such as a public service announcement on television or on a billboard may be fleeting and individuals may not be aware of their significance in prompting them to engage in a health-related behavior. Interpersonal influences are also particularly difficult to measure as cues.\n"}

He was the son of Jonathan Backhouse Hodgkin (1843-1926), banker and mayor of Darlington, and of Mary Anna Pease, both from Quaker families. The Hodgkins lived in the majestic Victorian manor of Elm Ridge in Darlington. After Leighton Park School he studied first in King's College, Cambridge, then in St Thomas' Hospital, London, to become a medical doctor (M.B. B.Ch (Cantab) ). Extremely tall, with exceptional charisma and personality, he became President of the English Student Missionary Union from 1902 to 1905. This organization's aim was to recruit missionaries among British students.\n\nAfter completing his studies in 1905, Henry Hodgkin left immediately for Chengdu, in the Sichuan province, China, as a missionary The Friends' Foreign Missionary Association, a Quaker organisation which later became The Friends Service Council ; he stayed in China until 1909. During his stay in Chnegdu, he helped set up the West China Union University, a Protestant university sponsored by several Protestant churches until its closure in 1926; after 1926 the Chinese professors took over from the foreign professors, and perpetuated their work so well that this university has now been incorporated into Chengdu's various universities.\n\nFrom 1910 to 1920, Henry Hodgkin returned to England, to be the Secretary of The Friends' Foreign Missionary Association. He departed again for China in 1921, initially to deliver a series of lectures. He received however as a result a pressing invitation to become one of the secretaries of the National Christian Council of China; he held this position from 1922 to 1929.\n\nDuring his decade in Britain from 1910 to 1920, Hodgkin became active on the pacifist scene. In the summer of 1914, he had joined a group of about 150 European Christians who were convinced that a major conflagration was coming soon in Europe and who had gathered in Constance, in southern Germany, to envisage possible actions to avert an actual war. This conference was far from successful since it was interrupted by the actual declaration of war! While conference participants were hurriedly returning home by train, Henry Hodgkin and the German Lutheran pastor Friedrich Siegmund-Schultze made a mutual commitment before parting in Cologne that while their countries might be at war with each other, \"We are one in Christ and can never be at war.\" This commitment implied of course to abstain from any direct personal participation in the conflict, in line with the traditional pacifist Quaker position, but also to work relentlessly to reestablish peace between their two nations no matter the policies of their governments. \nHodgkin kept his word immediately and initiated a first meeting at Queens' College, Cambridge, where he lectured in philosophy: an ecumenical group of about 20 people came together to reflect on the implications of war on their personal and community life. They wrote a common declaration stating they could conceive God as a nationalist and couldn’t accept the idea of a moratorium on the Sermon on the Mount on hold for the duration of the war. The first chapter of the Fellowship of Reconciliation (FOR) was born. Another meeting gathered 128 people at Trinity College, Cambridge, where Henry Hodgkin was elected president of the FOR. \nIn 1915 Hodgkin travelled to New York City with a group of 66 people and convened a meeting at Union Theological Seminary that included some very influential theologians and ministers the day, including Reinhold Niebuhr (who would become critical of Christian pacifism in the ’30s and consequently break with the FOR). Among those present that day were Edward Evans, Norman Thomas, socialist educator Jessie Wallace Hughan (who would later found the more secular War Resisters League), Episcopalian bishop Paul Jones (who would be forced to resign his Utah see in April 1918 because of his outspoken opposition to World War I), Grace Hutchins et John Haynes Holmes. The American chapter of the now International Fellowship of Reconciliation was then founded.\n\nIn 1929 Henry Hodgkin was called to launch the Quaker religious and social meeting centre of Pendle Hill near Philadelphia ( Pendle Hill being the name of the Lancashire hill where George Fox, the inspirator of Quakerism, had his founding vision). Historian Douglas Gwyn has shown Henry Hodgkin’s determining role, contributing his spiritual depth and his social concern to the drafting of the meeting centre’s vision: Pendle Hill’s early vision was to be \"a vital center of spiritual culture and as a place for training leaders.\" In 1929, Henry Hodgkin gathered a dozen leaders to discern the direction for this new center and four key focus areas were chosen as a result:\nHe had to leave this position in 1932 for health reasons.\n\nHenry Hodgkin wrote several books, among which: \n\nHenry Hodgkin’s philosophy was rooted in his Quaker faith, which brought along a deep adhesion to pacifism and in a high social sensitivity. His views evolved from a strict English Quaker missionary’s view to a more multicultural approach. One of his biographers wrote that he was \"a man large of body and mind\". He summarised his own evolution as follows: \"By processes too numerous and diverse even to summarize, I have reached a position which may be stated in a general way somewhat like this: \"I believe that God's best for another may be so different from my experience and way of living as to be actually impossible for me. I recognize a change to have taken place in myself, from a certain assumption that mine was really the better way, to a very complete recognition that there is no one better way and that God needs all kinds of people and ways of living through which to manifest Himself in the World. This has seemed to carry with it two conclusions which greatly affect conduct. One is that I really find myself wanting to learn from people whom I previously would have regarded as fit objects for my 'missionary zeal'. To discover another way in which God is operating - along lines it may be distasteful or dangerous to me - is a large part of the fun of living. The second direction in which conduct is influenced is the deliberate attempt to share the life and interests of others who are not in my circle ... [for] in such sharing I can most deeply understand the other's life and through that reach, maybe, fresh truths about God.\"\n\nHenry Hodgkin married Elizabeth Joy Montgomery. They had three children. He died on 26 March 1933 in Dublin a few weeks after undergoing surgery. \nHis family counted a variety of personalities who deeply influenced the region of Darlington:\n\n"}

{"id": "1601765", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1601765", "title": "Intensional logic", "text": "Intensional logic\n\nIntensional logic is an approach to predicate logic that extends first-order logic, which has quantifiers that range over the individuals of a universe (\"extensions\"), by additional quantifiers that range over terms that may have such individuals as their value (\"intensions\"). The distinction between intensional and extensional entities is parallel to the distinction between sense and reference.\n\nLogic is the study of proof and deduction as manifested in language (abstracting from any underlying psychological or biological processes). Logic is not a closed, completed science, and presumably, it will never stop developing: the logical analysis can penetrate into varying depths of the language (sentences regarded as atomic, or splitting them to predicates applied to individual terms, or even revealing such fine logical structures like modal, temporal, dynamic, epistemic ones).\n\nIn order to achieve its special goal, logic was forced to develop its own formal tools, most notably its own grammar, detached from simply making direct use of the underlying natural language. Functors belong to the most important categories in logical grammar (along with basic categories like \"sentence\" and \"individual name\"): a functor can be regarded as an \"incomplete\" expression with argument places to fill in. If we fill them in with appropriate subexpressions, then the resulting entirely completed expression can be regarded as a result, an output. Thus, a functor acts like a function sign, taking on input expressions, resulting in a new, output expression.\n\nSemantics links expressions of language to the outside world. Also logical semantics has developed its own structure. Semantic values can be attributed to expressions in basic categories: the reference of an individual name (the \"designated\" object named by that) is called its extension; and as for sentences, their truth value is called also extension.\n\nAs for functors, some of them are simpler than others: extension can be attributed to them in a simple way. In case of a so-called \"extensional\" functor we can in a sense abstract from the \"material\" part of its inputs and output, and regard the functor as a function turning directly the \"extension of\" its input(s) into the extension of its output. Of course, it is assumed that we can do so at all: the extension of input expression(s) determines the extension of the resulting expression. Functors for which this assumption does not hold are called \"intensional\".\n\nNatural languages abound with intensional functors, this can be illustrated by intensional statements. Extensional logic cannot reach inside such fine logical structures of the language, it stops at a coarser level. The attempts for such deep logical analysis have a long past: authors as early as Aristotle had already studied modal syllogisms. Gottlob Frege developed a kind of two dimensional semantics: for resolving questions like those of intensional statements, he has introduced a distinction between two semantic values: sentences (and individual terms) have both an extension and an intension. These semantic values can be interpreted, transferred also for functors (except for intensional functors, they have only intension).\n\nAs mentioned, motivations for settling problems that belong today to intensional logic have a long past. As for attempts of formalizations. the development of calculi often preceded the finding of their corresponding formal semantics. Intensional logic is not alone in that: also Gottlob Frege accompanied his (extensional) calculus with detailed explanations of the semantical motivations, but the formal foundation of its semantics appeared only in the 20th century. Thus sometimes similar patterns repeated themselves for the history of development of intensional logic like earlier for that of extensional logic.\n\nThere are some intensional logic systems that claim to fully analyze the common language:\n\nModal logic is historically the earliest area in the study of intensional logic, originally motivated by formalizing \"necessity\" and \"possibility\" (recently, this original motivation belongs to alethic logic, just one of the many branches of modal logic).\n\nModal logic can be regarded also as the most simple appearance of such studies: it extends extensional logic just with a few sentential functors: these are intensional, and they are interpreted (in the metarules of semantics) as quantifying over possible worlds. For example, the Necessity operator (the 'square') when applied to a sentence A says ' The sentence \"('square')A\" is true in world i if it is true in all worlds accessible from world i'. The corresponding Possibility operator (the 'diamond') when applied to A asserts that \"('diamond')A\" is true in world i iff A is true in some worlds (at least one) accessible to world i. The exact semantic content of these assertions therefore depends crucially on the nature of the Accessibility relation. For example, is world i accessible from itself? The answer to this question characterizes the precise nature of the system, and many exist, answering moral and temporal questions (in a temporal system, the accessibility relation covers states or 'instants' and only the future is accessible from a given moment. The Necessity operator corresponds to 'for all future moments' in this logic. The operators are related to one another by similar dualities to quantifiers do (for example by the analogous correspondents of De Morgan's laws). I.e., Something is necessary iff its negation is not possible, i.e. inconsistent. Syntactically, the operators are not quantifiers, they do not bind variables, but govern whole sentences. This gives rise to the problem of Referential Opacity, i.e. the problem of quantifying over or 'into' modal contexts. The operators appear in the grammar as sentential functors, they are called modal operators.\n\nAs mentioned, precursors of modal logic includes Aristotle. Medieval scholastic discussions accompanied its development, for example about \"de re\" versus \"de dicto\" modalities: said in recent terms, in the \"de re\" modality the modal functor is applied to an open sentence, the variable is bound by a quantifier whose scope includes the whole intensional subterm.\n\nModern modal logic began with the Clarence Irving Lewis, his work was motivated by establishing the notion of strict implication. Possible worlds approach enabled more exact study of semantical questions. Exact formalization resulted in Kripke semantics (developed by Saul Kripke, Jaakko Hintikka, Stig Kanger).\n\nAlready in 1951, Alonzo Church had developed an intensional calculus. The semantical motivations were explained expressively, of course without those tools that we know in establishing semantics for modal logic in a formal way, because they had not been invented then: Church has not provided formal semantic definitions.\n\nLater, possible world approach to semantics provided tools for a comprehensive study in intensional semantics. Richard Montague could preserve the most important advantages of Church's intensional calculus in his system. Unlike its forerunner, Montague grammar was built in a purely semantical way: a simpler treatment became possible, thank to the new formal tools invented since Church's work.\n\n\n"}

He was a visiting assistant professor at the University of Michigan in 1975, a Professor of Philosophy at Lehigh University from 1975 to 1989, and Professor of Philosophy at Calvin College from 1989 to 2003. Hare served on the staff of the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs from 1982–83, and was selected to give the Gifford Lectures at the University of Glasgow in 2005. He has been the Noah Porter Professor of Philosophical Theology at Yale University since 2003.\n\nHare has been on the editorial boards of several academic journals, including \"The Journal of Religious Ethics\", \"American Philosophical Quarterly\", \"History of Philosophy Quarterly\", and \"Ancient Philosophy\", and currently serves on the boards of the Yale Center for Bioethics, Yale Center for Faith and Culture and Berkeley Divinity School.\n\nThe author of over sixty articles in scholarly journals, Hare has worked on a wide range of topics, including ancient philosophy, medieval Franciscan philosophy, Immanuel Kant, Søren Kierkegaard, contemporary ethical theory, the theory of the atonement, medical ethics, international relations and aesthetics.\n\nThe son of the British utilitarian R. M. Hare, Hare has created an ethical theory which integrates Kantian deontological ethics with utilitarian consequentialism. Unlike his father's, Hare's philosophy is specifically Christian and includes elements of Divine command theory.\n\nIn \"The Moral Gap\" (1996), Hare outlined and analyzed various philosophers' responses to the gap — which he finds to be identified in Kant's writings — between human ethical ability and human ethical duty; between what is possible and what is required. He sees this \"moral gap\" as ultimately unbridgable apart from religion. In \"God's Call\" (2001), Hare addresses the \"moral gap\" with a discussion of the divine command theory of morality, and argues against J. B. Schneewind's secularized reading of Kant's philosophy.\n\nIn \"Why Bother Being Good?\" (2002), Hare delivers a non-technical apologetic for Christian beliefs and argues that morality cannot be adequately grounded in reason alone but needs a firm basis in faith, or something that will do the work theology has done for the Western tradition in the past. In \"God and Morality: A Philosophical History\" (2007), Hare evaluates the ethical theories of Aristotle, Duns Scotus, Immanuel Kant, and the author's father, R. M. Hare, with close attention to the similarities among the philosophers and the relationship of their work to theism.\n\nIn addition to being the Plantinga Lecturer (2008) and Gifford Lecturer (2005), Hare has been the Calvin Lecturer (1999–2000) and the Stob Lecturer (1999). He held the senior fellowship at the Center for Philosophy of Religion at the University of Notre Dame from 1998–99, and again from 2008-09. In 1997, Hare was the recipient of the Institute for Advanced Christian Studies Book Prize and held the Pew Evangelical Fellowship from 1991–92. He was also a Congressional Fellow of the American Philosophical Association from 1981–82, and a visiting fellow in the humanities at the Medical College of Pennsylvania from 1978-81. Hare is the recipient of the Junior Lindback Award for Distinguished Teaching (1981) and was elected an honorary member of Phi Beta Kappa (1979).\n\nHare worked as a teacher at Tyndale Biscoe School in Kashmir (India) from 1966-67. He is a published composer of liturgical compositions for choir and organ. A student in Hare's course on theological aesthetics at Yale disclosed on the student review platform Rate My Professors:\n\nJohn Hare is a gem, the kind of professor in C. S. Lewis's books.

(also known as Jean de La Rochelle, John of Rupella, and Johannes de Rupella) ( 1200 - 8 February 1245), was a French Franciscan and theologian.\n\nHe was born in La Rochelle (in Latin, \"Rupella\"), towards the end of the 12th century, and seems to have entered the Franciscan Order at an early age. He was a pupil of Alexander of Hales and was the first Franciscan to receive a bachelor's degree of theology from the University of Paris. He produced multiple treatises, sermons, commentaries on scripture, and also played a large role in the \"Summa fratris Alexandri\", a theological \"Summa\" written by Alexander. “Hales left the beginnings of the theological Summa, and it was completed by John of la Rochelle and others”.\nBy 1238, he was a master of theology, with his own pupils, for his name is found in the list of masters convoked in that year by William of Auvergne, Bishop of Paris, to discuss the question of ecclesiastical benefices.\n\n“For Jean de la Rochelle, theology is essentially wisdom…Jean deems that three things are required for a theologian: knowledge, a holy life, and teaching. Someone who teaches Scripture should have a solid doctoral formation, but should also embody in himself sacred knowledge by his good will and moral actions, before practicing his profession upon others through teaching and preaching”.\n\nIn dissensions which rent the Franciscan order, John was one of the opponents of Brother Elias, and with Alexander of Hales was involved in discussions that led to the plot which brought about Elias' downfall in 1239. When the 1241 Chapter of Definitors called for comments on disputed questions on the Franciscan Rule, the Province of Paris asked John of La Rochelle, together with Alexander of Hales, Robert of Bascia and Odo of Rigaud, to furnish an explanation of the Rule of St. Francis. The work received the approbation of the General Chapter of the Order held at Bologna in 1242, and subsequently became known as the \"Exposition of the Four Masters.\"\n\nHe died in 1245, the same year as his teacher Alexander of Hales.\n\nHis works, the \"Tractatus de divisione potentiarum animae\" (\"A Treatise on the Multiple Divisions of the Soul’s Power\"), written c. 1233, and \"Summa de anima\" (\"Summa on the Soul\"), written c. 1235, were arguably some of his best. Father Fidelis of Fanna says (on the \"Summa\") that no subject is to be found so frequently in manuscripts of the 13th and 14th centuries in the many European libraries he searched.\n\nThere also exist \"summae\" on the virtue, vices, the articles of the faith, and the ten commandments; many biblical commentaries; sermons, and disputed questions on grace and other theological topics.\n\nJohn was among those who declared against the general lawfulness of plurality. He appears to have enjoyed a favorable reputation, and is described by Bernard of Besse as a professor of great fame for holiness and learning, whose writings were both solid and extremely useful.\n\nThe main aim of the \"Summa de anima\" is to set out Jean’s position on being and essence in the context of the debate between those who defend the theory that all of created being is composed of matter and form, and those who, like Thomas Aquinas later would, rejected the doctrine which attributed a composite nature to the soul. Jean investigates the soul according to the four Aristotelian causes: material, efficient, formal, and final. \nHe states what he believes to be intellectual cognition, “while nonetheless retaining certain Avicennian doctrines”. Going deeper into the investigation of the soul, Jean introduces a doctrine that distinguishes the soul into two levels of reason: higher and lower. The levels of the soul are distinguished according to their objects: the objects of higher reasoning can be classified as a spiritual being, and the objects of lower reasoning are classified as corporeal.\n“Following Augustine, Jean classifies the objects of knowledge further by dividing them into four categories: beings above, beside, in, or beneath the soul”. He also proposes a different agent intellect for each class of objects: the immanent agent intellect suitable for corporeal beings, and two further agent intellects: one for beings outside the soul, such as angels, and one for the being above the soul, God himself. The distinction between the agent intellect outside the soul and the one above the soul, also shows Augustine’s heavy influence on Jean, since similar doctrines are found in Augustine’s work \"On Spirit and the Soul\". Jean's idea here is similar to Avicenna’s views on separate intelligence, in relation to a separate \"angelic\" agent intellect that acts upon the soul’s immanent agent intellect.\n\nJohn’s \"Treatise on the Multiple Divisions of the Soul’s Power\" (\"Tractatus\") gives another detailed view of his conception of the soul. \"Fortunately it shows more clearly than his Summa how he appropriates and begins to transform his philosophical sources”. The Tractatus is divided into three parts that correspond to the three ways of looking at the soul: definition, division, and completion or perfection. “Jean’s typical procedure in each of the three parts of the Tractatus is to assemble authoritative texts on the point at hand and then to analyze their competing vocabularies”. His analysis of competing vocabularies of the soul includes a wide range of sources, including Plato, Aristotle, Seneca, the book of Genesis, Nemesius of Emesa, and Avicenna. Jean’s Tractatus was a great example of how challenging it was for theologians to organize and clarify much of the newly translated material of the 13th century.\n\nJean made significant progress as a philosopher in a time when Parisian theologians abstained from philosophical studies. Jean had many influences and referenced many works from theologians and philosophers alike; however, much of his work, especially that in philosophy of the soul, indicates much originality.\n\n"}

{"id": "19007131", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19007131", "title": "Legal certainty", "text": "Legal certainty\n\nLegal certainty is a principle in national and international law which holds that the law must provide those subject to it with the ability to regulate their conduct. Legal certainty is internationally recognised as a central requirement for the rule of law.\n\nThe legal system needs to permit those subject to the law to regulate their conduct with certainty and to protect those subject to the law from arbitrary use of state power. Legal certainty represents a requirement that decisions be made according to legal rules, i.e. be lawful. The concept of legal certainty may be strongly linked to that of individual autonomy in national jurisprudence. The degree to which the concept of legal certainty is incorporated into law varies depending on national jurisprudence. However, legal certainty frequently serves as the central principle for the development of legal methods by which law is made, interpreted and applied.\n\nLegal certainty is an established legal concept both in the civil law legal systems and common law legal systems. In the civil law tradition, legal certainty is defined in terms of maximum predictability of officials' behaviour. In the common law tradition, legal certainty is often explained in terms of citizens' ability to organise their affairs in such a way that does not break the law. In both legal traditions, legal certainty is regarded as grounding value for the legality of legislative and administrative measures taken by public authorities.\n\nThe legal philosopher Gustav Radbruch regarded legal certainty, justice and purposiveness as the three fundamental pillars of law. Today legal certainty is internationally recognised as a central requirement for the rule of law. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) the concept of the rule of law \"first and foremost seeks to emphasize the necessity of establishing a rule-based society in the interest of legal certainty and predictability.\" At the G8 Foreign Ministers' Meeting in Potsdam in 2007, the G8 committed to the rule of law as a core principle entailing adherence to the principle of legal certainty.\n\nMost European nations regard legal certainty as a fundamental quality of the legal system and a guiding requirement for the rule of law, although they have differing meanings of the term. \n\nThe concept can be traced through English common law in that system's recognition that legal certainty requires that laws be made such that people can comply with them.\n\nIt also recognised in all European civil legal systems. The concept is recognised in Germany as \"\", in France as \"\", in Spain as \"\", in Italy as \"\", in the Benelux countries as \"rechtszekerheid\", in Sweden as \"\", in Poland as \"\", and in Finland as \"\". Legal certainty is now recognised as one of the general principles of European community law and \"requires that all law be sufficiently precise to allow the person – if need be, with appropriate advice – to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail\". The principle of legal certainty, and as such the rule of law, requires that:\n\nThe concept of legal certainty has been recognised as one of the general principles of European Union law by the European Court of Justice since the 1960s. It is an important general principle of international law and public law, which predates European Union law. As a general principle in European Union law, it means that the law must be certain, in that it is clear and precise, and its legal implications foreseeable, especially when applied to financial obligations. The adoption of laws which will have legal effect in the European Union must have a proper legal basis. Legislation in member states which implements European Union law must be worded so that it is clearly understandable by those who are subject to the law.\n\nIn European Union law the general principle of legal certainty prohibits \"Ex post facto\" laws, i.e. laws should not take effect before they are published. The general principle also requires that sufficient information must be made public to enable parties to know what the law is and comply with it. For example in \"Opel Austria v Council\" the European Court of Justice held that European Council Regulation did not come into effect until it had been published. Opel had brought the action on the basis that the Regulation in question violated the principle of legal certainty, because it legally came into effect before it had been notified and the regulation published. The doctrine of legitimate expectation, which has its roots in the principles of legal certainty and good faith, is also a central element of the general principle of legal certainty in European Union law.\n\nThe legitimate expectation doctrine holds that \"those who act in good faith on the basis of law as it is, or seems to be, should not be frustrated in their expectations\". This means that a European Union institution, once it has induced a party to take a particular course of action, must not renege on its earlier position if doing so would cause that party to suffer loss. The European Court of Justice has considered the legitimate expectation doctrine in cases where violation of the general principle of legal certainty was alleged in numerous cases involving agricultural policy and European Council regulations, with the leading case being \"Mulder v Minister van Landbouw en Visserij\".\n\nThe misuse of power test is another significant element of the general principle of legal certainty in European Union law. It holds that a lawful power must not be exercised for any other purpose than that for which it was conferred. According to the misuse of power test a decision by a European Union institution is only a misuse of power if \"it appears, on the basis of objective, relevant and consistent evidence, to have been adopted with the exclusive or main purpose of achieving any end other than those stated.\" A rare instance where the European Court of Justice has held that a European Union institution has misused its powers, and therefore violated the general principle of legal uncertainty, is \"Giuffrida v Commission\". The general principle of legal certainty is particularly stringently applied when European Union law imposes financial burdens on private parties.\n\nThe concept of legal certainty is recognised by the European Court of Human Rights.\n\nIn United States law the principle of legal certainty is phrased as fair warning and the void for vagueness principle.\n\nHowever, in the \"Calder v. Bull\" case it was established that in the U.S. the prohibition of ex post facto laws applies only to criminal cases, not to civil law.\n\n"}

{"id": "55118688", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55118688", "title": "Neiye", "text": "Neiye\n\nThe c. 350 BCE Neiye 內業 or Inward Training is the oldest Chinese received text describing Daoist breath meditation techniques and \"qi\" circulation. After the \"Guanzi\" political and philosophical compendium included the \"Neiye\" around the 2nd century BCE, it was seldom mentioned by Chinese scholars until the 20th century, when it was reevaluated as a \"proto-Daoist\" text that clearly influenced the \"Daode jing\", \"Zhuangzi\", and other classics. \"Neiye\" traditions also influenced Chinese thought and culture. For instance, it had the first references to cultivating the life forces \"jing\" \"essence\", \"qi\" \"vital energy\", and \"shen\" \"spirit\", which later became a fundamental concept in Daoist \"Neidan\" \"internal alchemy\", as well as the Three Treasures in traditional Chinese medicine.\n\nThe sinologist A. C. Graham regards the \"Neiye\" as \"possibly the oldest 'mystical' text in China\" (1989: 100). The professor of religious studies Harold D. Roth describes it as \"a manual on the theory and practice of meditation that contains the earliest references to breath control and the earliest discussion of the physiological basis of self-cultivation in the Chinese tradition\" (1991: 611-2), and perhaps the oldest extant text of Daoism (1994: 37).\n\nThe title is a compound of two common Chinese words: \"nèi\" 内 meaning \"inside; inner; internal\" and \"yè\" 業 \"work; deed; achievement; production\".\n\nIn ancient Old Chinese that was used when the \"Neiye\" was compiled, the two titular component words had complex meanings. Bernhard Karlgren's classic \"Grammata Serica Recensa\" dictionary translates \"nèi\" 內 as \"enter; to bring in, to present; take to heart\"; and says the early characters for \"yè\" 業 depicted a \"horizontal board of a bell stand or frame\", which was used as a phonetic loan character for \"initiate; work; action; deed; profession; fortune, inheritance; strong; terrible\" (1957: 695e, 640a)\n\nWhile many English-language authors transliterate the 內業 title as \"Neiye\" or \"Nei-yeh\", some translate it as:\nA. C. Graham's and Harold D. Roth's \"Inward Training\" is apparently the most common English title, owing to Roth's \"Neiye\" articles and translation (1991, 1994, 1996, 1997, and 1999).\n\nIn modern Standard Chinese construction and engineering usage, \"nèiyè\" 內業 or 内业 can historically refer to the ancient Daoist text, but more commonly designates \"interior work; office work\", as opposed to \"wàiyè\" 外業 or 外业 \"field operation; field work\" (\"Wenlin\" 2016).\n\nThe \"Neiye\" 內業 is a collection of poetic verses describing a method of guided breathing meditation and the underlying cosmology of the \"Dao\" on which it is based. Roth calls the mystical method \"inner cultivation\", the goal of which is to directly apprehend this \"all-pervading cosmic force\" (1999: 11).\n\nThe text contains a total of 1,622 characters, and the verses are written almost exclusively in rhymed prose. Most of the lines of verse are tetrasyllabic, that is, they contain four syllables each of which is represented by one character, but other patterns of five or more syllables sometimes occur. The rhymes occur most often at the end of every second line (Roth 1999: 12). Both the \"Neiye\"'s rhymed literary form and philosophical content are similar to the more renowned \"Daode jing\", which is about three times longer (Kirkland 2008: 771).\n\nTake for example, Verse 2 (with rhyme words shown in Old Chinese reconstruction) discussing \"jing\" \"vital energy\":\n<poem>\nTherefore this vital energy is:\nBright!—as if ascending the heavens [天 *\"ten\"];\nDark!—as if entering an abyss [淵 *\"wen\"];\nVast!—as if dwelling in an ocean [海 *\"xməɣ\"];\nLofty!—as if dwelling on a mountain peak [屺 *\"kiəɣ\"].\nTherefore this vital energy\nCannot be halted by force, [力 *\"liək\"] \nYet can be secured by inner power [德 *\"tək\"].\nCannot be summoned by speech,\nYet can be welcomed by the awareness [意 *\"ˑiəɣ\"].\nReverently hold onto it and do not lose it:\nThis is called \"developing inner power\" [德 *\"tək\"].\nWhen inner power develops and wisdom emerges,\nThe myriad things will, to the last one, be grasped [得 *\"tək\"]. \n(tr. Roth 1999: 48-49) </poem>\nScholars infer two kinds of contextual evidence that the redactor of an initial written \"Neiye\" edition brought together a series of originally distinct verses: the variety of meter and rhyme in the lines, and the two usages of the conjunction \"shìgù\" 是故 “therefore\" (Roth 1999: 14). Riegel proposes that these poetic features of the \"Neiye\" would have facilitated memorization and recitation, suggesting that they might have been transmitted orally for a period of time before the compiler assembled and wrote them down. (1978: 148)\n\nAlthough extant editions of the \"Neiye\" text have only two or three general divisions, it is possible to identify distinct units based on semantic, syntactic, and phonological criteria. Some different proposed textual separations are: fifteen separate verses with some subdivisions (Ma Feibai 馬非百, W. Allyn Rickett 1985-98); eighteen verses plus four subdivisions (Gustav Haloun and Jeffrey Riegel 1978); and twenty-six separate verses (Roth 1999: 14).\n\nThe date when the \"Neiye\" was compiled is uncertain. Rickett dated the text to the late 4th or early 3rd century BCE, Graham to the 4th, and Roth to the mid-4th (Kirkland 1997: 3); it is thus generally dated to around 350-300 BCE (Kirkland 2008: 771). Campany rejects Roth's arguments for dating the \"Neiye\" to the 4th century BCE because they are based on his \"speculative and wishful assumption\" that political considerations were added only later to an \"original Dao\" (2005: 26).\n\nThe problem of the dating of the \"Neiye\" is connected to some other texts within the \"Guanzi\". Four chapters (\"piān\" 篇) have descriptions of meditation practices: \"Xinshu\" 心術 \"Techniques of the Mind I and II\" (chapters 36 and 37), \"Baixin\" 白心 \"The Purified Mind\" (38), and \"Neiye\" 內業 \"Inward Training\" (49). The \"Guanzi\" is an heterogenous collection of writings by diverse Legalist, Confucianist, and Daoist authors; compilation probably began around 300 BCE and material may have been added until 26 BCE when Liu Xiang edited the received text (Roth 1999: 18). \nSince these four texts are the only \"Guanzi\" chapters to mention the significance of breath mediation, researchers tend to consider them together (Roth 1999: 18). Furthermore, all four exhibit the irregular rhyme patterns thought to be characteristic of the Chu region variety of Chinese (Roth 1994: 11). Many scholars have debated over the relationship between \"Neiye\", \"Xinshu I and II\", and \"Baixin\". Most concur that these texts were written by Huang-Lao Daoist philosophers at the Jixia Academy in the Qi capital of Linzi, but many disagree over the dating of the texts and identity of the redactors. After analyzing the structure and rhetorical characteristics of the \"Daode jing\", \"Neiye\", \"Xinshu I\", and \"Baixin\", The Chinese linguist William H. Baxter proposed that they constitute a specific literary genre, which emerged from \"a distinctive tradition of philosophical verse with strong oral elements and little concept of individual authorship\" (1998: 240-243, 249).\n\nIn order to estimate the dates of compilation for these \"Guanzi\" writings about breath circulation techniques, Roth analyzed the linguistic features of the \"Neiye\", \"Xinshu I and II\", and \"Baixin\"; and concluded that the \"Neiye\" is a genuine 4th-century BCE text while the others are derived from it (1999: 23-25). The first three works have close conceptual and textual parallels, but the \"Baixin\"—which is a mostly prose essay on how a sage ruler can apply the meditation techniques to governing—is considered the latest work in the group. Three types of evidence support the antiquity of the \"Neiye\". First, its distinctive literary structure as a composition of originally independent, rhythmic and rhymed verse is a sign of oral transmission before literacy became widespread in the latter half of the 4th century BCE. Second, the \"Neiye\" does not contain the kind of sustained argumentation typically found in 3rd-century BCE philosophical essays, and it shows only a loose principle of organization between its verses. Third, the absence of the correlative cosmology of yin and yang and the Five Phases, characteristic of 3rd-century BCE texts. Using redaction criticism – analyzing the production a text from how the redactors (editors, compilers) combined and arranged the source materials – Roth found that the \"Xinshu II\" is an original prose essay in which the redactor deliberately extracted and rearranged \"Neiye\" verses for the purpose of advocating the political benefits of inner cultivation methods (1994: 34). It thus complements \"Xinshu I\" and accounts for the \"Guanzi\" labeling them as parts of one essay (1999: 26).\n\nMore specifically, Roth proposes that the \"Neiye\"'s exclusively verse format and absence of political thought would support a date of mid-4th century at the latest. The first part of \"Xinshu I\" contains verses that are almost as old, but since they begin to advocate applying inner cultivation techniques to the task of governing and show evidence of interaction with rival intellectual positions, he dates them to about 300 BCE. The commentary contained in the second part of \"Xinshu I\" shows the influence of the \"Daodejing\" and so must be dated to a later time after this work became influential in intellectual circles about 250 BCE (1999: 26-27).\n\nA 45-character inscription on a Warring States era jade artifact may possibly be an earlier record of breath meditation than the \"Neiye\" (Harper 1999: 881). This rhymed passage entitled \"Xíngqì\" 行氣 \"circulating the vital breath\" was inscribed on a dodecagonal block of jade, with nine trisyllabic phrases describing the stages of breath cultivation. While the dating is uncertain, estimates range from earlier than 400 BCE (Joseph Needham), 380 BCE (Guo Moruo), to late 4th century BCE (Harper). In any case, scholars agree that this is the earliest Chinese epigraphical evidence on the practice of breath meditation (Roth 1999: 162).\n\nThe ancient \"Neiye\" presents a \"seamless web … connecting the psychological, physiological, and spiritual aspects of the human being\" (Roth 1999: 106). It is the earliest known text that explains self-cultivation through daily, practiced regulation of a group of life forces. Namely, \"qi\" \"vital energy\" (the universal force that gives life to all things), \"jing\" \"vital essence\" (one's innate reservoir of \"qi\"), \"xin\" \"heart-mind\", \"shen\" \"spirit; spiritual consciousness\", \"dao\" \"the Way\", and \"de\" \"inner power\". These terms later became keywords in Chinese philosophy, but the \"Neiye\" sometimes used them idiosyncratically, for instance, \"dao\" was effectively interchangeable with \"shen\" and \"qi\" (Kirkland 2008: 771).\n\nQi, which Roth translates as \"vital energy\" or \"vital breath\", integrates the physical with the psychological. Kirkland describes \"qi\" \"life-energy\" in the \"Neiye\" as \"a powerful salubrious reality\" that is present everywhere and within all things (1997: 5). According to the \"Neiye\", human beings are made up of systems containing various manifestations of \"qi\"; the \"wǔzàng\" 五臟 Five Orbs/Viscera system includes not only the physical organs (lungs, kidneys, liver, gallbladder, and spleen), but also the psychological range of mental and emotional states—presciently similar to the contemporary idea of neural correlates for consciousness (Roth 1999: 41-42). \n\nJing \"vital essence\" is a central concept in the \"Neiye\", with meanings that span from the universal life-giving essence contained in all creatures to the particular physiological substrate that allows sages to achieve profound tranquility. Within each person, \"qi\" energy is centered in the \"jing\" essence, which Roth describes as \"the source of the vital energy in human beings [and] the basis of our health, vitality, and psychological well-being\" (1999: 42). Verse 8 provides the following clear equation: \"The vital essence [\"jing\" 精]: it is the essence [精] of the vital energy [\"qi\" 氣].\" Thus, it is concentrated and subtle form of vital energy (Roth 1999: 101). \n\nThe original meaning of \"jing\" (written 精 with the \"rice radical\" 米) \"finest and purest rice\" was a religious concept (Harper 1998: 119). Pure and refined things were considered as the \"stuff of spirits; quintessence; essence\", referring either to sacrificial offerings suitable for the gods/spirits or the potency of the spirits themselves. In later usage \"jing\" came to mean \"germinal essence; energy that nourishes the human body; vitality\". Harper translates this term both as \"essence\" and \"specter, spectral\" in the \"Neiye\" (1998: 155).\n\nThe two most important philosophical concepts in the \"Neiye\" are the closely related notions of the vital essence and the Way. The power of the Way to generate all things is manifested as the vital essence, which is the procreative principle within all phenomena (Roth 1999: 101). The first lines of the text compare heavenly and earthly \"jing\".\n<poem>The vital essence of all things: \nIt is this that brings them to life. \nIt generates the five grains below \nAnd becomes the constellated stars above. \nWhen flowing amid the heavens and earth,\nWe call it ghostly and numinous. \nWhen stored within the chests of human beings, \nWe call them sages. (Verse 1, tr. Roth 1999: 46) </poem>\nBy storing \"jing\" within the heart/mind, one can become sagely. The sage's cultivation does not occur only at the spiritual level but rather sets into motion physiological changes, causing the human body to become thoroughly transformed and renewed (Yang 2003: 102).\n\nXin \"heart; mind\" is regularly translated by Roth as \"mind\" with a concrete connotation of not just the physical \"heart\" but also the entire sphere of vital energy that flows through it (1999: 42). The \"xin\" is described as the ruling agency in an individual's \"biospiritual nexus, i.e., in the entire personal complex of body/mind/heart/spirit\" (Kirkland 1997: 6). The \"xin\" can become agitated by excessive thought or emotion, which leads to dissipation of one's \"jing\" 精 \"vital essence\", and can result in sickness and death. To preserve health and vitality, the \"Neiye\" says that \"jing\" 靜 \"stabilizing; calming\" the \"xin\" will draw in the external realities of \"shen\" and \"dao\" (Kirkland 2008: 771). \n\nShen is usually translated as English \"spirit; spiritual\", but in order to avoid the connotative ambiguities of \"spirit\", Roth uses \"numen; numinous\" in reference to a layer of mystical awareness that lies within the human body (1999: 43). \"Shen\" comprises perception, cognition, and higher forms of awareness. The original meaning of \"shen\" \"god; spirit; deity\" was also a religious concept. External spirits were believed to occasionally descend to human beings (particularly shamans), or humans could draw them down with the power of \"de\" \"inner power; virtue\" (Harper 1998: 119).\n\nVerse 13 describes the aspects of \"shen\" \"numen; numinous\":\n<poem>There is a numinous [mind] naturally residing within [有神自在身];\nOne moment it goes, the next it comes,\nAnd no one is able to conceive of it.\nIf you lose it you are inevitably disordered;\nIf you attain it you are inevitably well ordered.\nDiligently clean out its lodging place [敬除其舍]\nAnd its vital essence will naturally arrive [精將自來].\nStill your attempts to imagine and conceive of it.\nRelax your efforts to reflect on and control it.\nBe reverent and diligent\nAnd its vital essence will naturally stabilize.\nGrasp it and don't let go\nThen the eyes and ears won't overflow\nAnd the mind will have nothing else to seek.\nWhen a properly aligned mind resides within you [正心在中],\nThe myriad things will be seen in their proper perspective. (tr. Roth 1999: 70) </poem>\nVerse 14 describes this \"shen\" \"numinous [mind]\" as a nondual awareness of the Way: \"Within the mind there is yet another mind. / That mind within the mind: it is an awareness that precedes words.\" (tr. Roth 1999: 72). This statement means the mind can be divided into two levels: empirical and transcendent. The former awaits transformation by the latter (Yang 2003: 104). The \"Neiye\"'s privately practiced meditation, in which the \"shen\" settles into the practitioner's body, directly descends from the trance of the professional \"wu\" \"shaman; spirit medium\" (Graham 1989: 101).\n\nDao \"the Way\" is a well-known Chinese loanword in English meaning \"an absolute entity which is the source of the universe\" (\"OED\"), but the ancient \"Neiye\" sometimes used it as an equivalent of the \"qi\", \"jing\", and \"shen\" that a practitioner works to cultivate (Kirkland 1997: 7-9). The \"Neiye\" describes the Way as a force that can enter or leave a person, and by engaging in specific self-cultivation practices one can make it come into direct experience or can keep it from going away (Roth 1999: 43).\n<poem>Clear! as though right by your side.\nVague! as though it will not be attained.\nIndiscernible! as though beyond the limitless.\nThe test of this is not far off:\nDaily we make use of its inner power [\"de\" 德].\nThe Way is what infuses the body,\nYet people are unable to fix it in place.\nIt goes forth but does not return,\nIt comes back but does not stay.\nSilent! none can hear its sound.\nSuddenly stopping! it abides within the mind.\nObscure! we do not see its form.\nSurging forth! it arises with us.\nWe do not see its form,\nWe do not hear its sound,\nYet we can perceive an order to its accomplishments.\nWe call it \"the Way.\" (4, tr. Roth 1999: 52) </poem>\nThus, the term \"dao\" refers to a transient reality that a person needs to attract and to retain (Kirkland 1997: 13). The \"Neiye\" warns that forceful efforts cannot make the \"dao\" arrive or stay, only one's \"de\" \"inner power\" (see below) can attract it and other life forces (Kirkland 2008: 772).\n\n\"Neiye\" verse 4 above depicts the Way as the ineffable cosmic power familiar from other early Daoist texts like the \"Daodejing\", yet it has a much more tangible presence in the \"Neiye\" (Roth 1999: 102). Verse 5 says the Way is a constantly moving power that seems to come and go within the human mind.\n<poem>The Way has no fixed position;\nIt abides within the excellent mind [善心].\nWhen the mind is tranquil and the vital breath is regular [心靜氣理],\nThe Way can thereby be halted.\nThat Way is not distant from us;\nWhen people attain it they are sustained\nThat Way is not separated from us;\nWhen people accord with it they are harmonious.\nTherefore: Concentrated! as though you could be roped together with it.\nIndiscernible! as though beyond all locations.\nThe true state of that Way:\nHow could it be conceived of and pronounced upon?\nCultivate your mind, make your thoughts tranquil [修心靜意],\nAnd the Way can thereby be attained. (tr. Roth 1999: 54) </poem>\nAlthough constantly moving in and out of one's mind, the Way can stay within it when one cultivates tranquility through the regular and systematic practice of breathing meditation. While the Way is always present, one is aware of this presence within the mind only when it is properly cultivated (Roth 1999: 103).\n\nDe \"inner power\" is a basic concept in traditional Daoism meaning \"inherent character; inner moral power; virtue; integrity\", but the \"Neiye\" used \"de\" to mean the \"acquisitional agency\" through which one can receive \"qi\", \"jing\", \"shen\", and \"dao\" (Kirkland 1997: 6). Thus, \"de\" \"inner power\" (which is cognate with \"de\" 得 \"get; acquire\"), is something that we \"acquire\" when all elements of the body/heart/mind are peaceful and aligned. Unlike other Daoist classics such as the \"Daodejing\" and \"Zhuangzi\" that describe \"de\" as intrinsic to everyone, the \"Neiye\" says one should practice daily self-control of thoughts and actions in order to build up one's \"de\" (Kirkland 1997: 7). Inner power is a distinct quality of mental concentration that arises naturally, along with tranquility, through the practice of proper posture and breathing meditation (Roth 1999: 105).\n<poem>When your body is not aligned [形不正], \nThe inner power will not come.\nWhen you are not tranquil within [中不靜],\nYour mind will not be well ordered.\nAlign your body, assist the inner power [正形攝德],\nThen it will gradually come on its own. (Verse 11, tr. Roth 1999: 66) </poem>\nThis inner power can be thought of as a psychological condition of \"focused and balanced awareness from which the adept is able to respond spontaneously and harmoniously to whatever arises\" (Roth 1999: 126).\n\n\"Neiye\" physiological concepts developed in the intellectual background of the 4th century BCE, a period when Chinese philosophers, notably the ethical egoist Yang Zhu, first considered the question of maintaining one's own physical wellbeing (Harper 1998: 120). The chief innovation made in the \"Neiye\" is equating \"jing\" vital essence and \"qi\" vital breath/energy, which unites vital energy and essence with \"shen\" spirit/numen—thus naturalizing the old religious connotations of \"jing\" and \"shen\" into new physical meanings. This inventive physiological theory merged a person's physical and spiritual components, and made vital breath/energy the source of each. The \"Neiye\" opens with the statement that\" jing\" \"vital essence\" is the source of life. Then the text identifies the mind as the \"lodging place for the vital essence\", defines vital essence as the \"essence of vital breath/energy\", and links \"jing\" with the indwelling \"shen\" \"spirit\". \"De\" \"inner power; virtue\" serves as the mechanism by which the triad of vital energy, vital essence, and spirit are drawn to the body where they must be stored and concentrated in order to create a wellspring of vitality (Harper 1998: 119). The \"Neiye\" introduced the physiological theory that one could transform oneself into a sage through heartmind training that cultivates \"qi\" vital breath/energy, \"jing\" vital essence, and \"shen\" spirit/numen in the body (Harper 1998: 78, 112).\n\nFrom a modern perspective, these 2500-year-old \"Neiye\" concepts seem enigmatic; \"qi\" \"vital breath\" constitutes both matter and energy, while \"xin\" \"body/heart/mind\" or bodymind circumvents Cartesian dualism. Owing to a semantic gap in the English lexicon, there is no standard word denoting the ancient Chinese \"Neiye\" worldview that spiritual life involves activities that also have physical components. Suggested protologisms include \"biospiritual\" (Kirkland 1997), \"physio-spiritual\" (Harper 1998),\"psychophysiological\" (Roth 1991), and \"psychospiritual\" (Roth 1999).\n\nAccording to the \"Neiye\", there is a set of elusive life forces that enter and leave the human body, but will only remain within a person who has transformed him/herself into an efficient receptacle. For instance, \"Cultivate your mind, make your thoughts tranquil, / And the Way can thereby be attained.\" (Verse 5), and \"Diligently clean out [spirit's] lodging place / And its vital essence will naturally arrive.\" (13). Kirkland says a good analogy for these forces might be radio waves that continually flow through us but can only be utilized by a device that is properly tuned. Figuratively, we are all radios that were originally fully operational, but now are experiencing electromagnetic interference caused by excessive heart/mind activity, and we need to retune ourselves to eliminate the disturbance and begin functioning properly again (1997: 14).\n\nThe \"Neiye\" acclaims a variety of practices and techniques for acquiring, or metaphorically \"tuning in\" to, the subtle forces of the Way. Basic daily practices include proper alignment of one's body/heart/mind, breath meditation, and moderation in thinking and eating. \n\nPracticing \"zhèng\" 正 '\"alignment\" of bodymind in order to attain \"jìng\" 靜 \"tranquility\" (cf. later \"jingzuo\" \"tranquil sitting\" meditation) is one of the most important aims in the \"Neiye\", where the word \"zheng\" \"to rectify; to square up; to center; to align\" appears in 9 of the 26 verses and \"jing\" \"still; quiet; calm; tranquil\" in 11. \"Fourfold Aligning\" is the basic method of \"Neiye\" practice: \"zhengxing\" 正形 \"aligning the body\", \"zhengsiti[zhi]\" 正四體[肢] \"aligning the four limbs\", \"zhengqi\" 正氣 \"aligning the vital energy\", and \"zhengxin\" 正心 \"aligning the mind\" (Roth 1999: 109). Since the human body is believed to be imbued with \"qi\" vital energy, the term \"zhengxing\" refers to aligning or harmonizing the flow of vital energy within the physical form (\"xing\" 形 literally means \"form; shape\"), while \"zhengxin\" refers to aligning the flow of vital energy within the mind (Roth 1991: 612).\n\n\"Aligning the body\" and \"aligning the four limbs\" are closely related. The former appears in Verse 11 (above): \"When your body is not aligned [形不正], / The inner power will not come. / When you are not tranquil within [中不靜], / Your mind will not be well ordered. / \"Align your body, assist the inner power [正形攝德], / Then it will gradually come on its own.\" The latter alignment of arms and legs creates a figurative \"she\" 舍 \"guest-house; lodging\" for \"jing\" \"vital essence\" in Verse 8. \n<poem>If you can be aligned and be tranquil [能正能靜],\nOnly then can you be stable.\nWith a stable mind at your core [定心在中],\nWith the eyes and ears acute and clear,\nAnd with the four limbs firm and fixed [四枝堅固],\nYou can thereby make a lodging place for the vital essence [可以為精舍].\nThe vital essence: it is the essence of the vital energy.\nWhen the vital energy is guided, it [the vital essence] is generated,\nBut when it is generated, there is thought,\nWhen there is thought, there is knowledge,\nBut when there is knowledge, then you must stop.\nWhenever the forms of the mind have excessive knowledge,\nYou lose your vitality. (tr. Roth 1999: 60)</poem>\nIn both these verses, being aligned precedes being tranquil, and thus developing a stabilized mind. \"Neiye\" \"alignment\" apparently refers to sitting in a steady posture with the limbs aligned or squared up with one another, comparable to the vajrasana posture in Buddhist meditation (Roth 1999: 110).\n\nThis \"Neiye\" metaphor of \"make a lodging place for the vital essence\" refers to the primary mystical praxis, which Verse 13 (above) symbolically describes, \"Diligently clean out its [the bodily \"shen\"'s] lodging place [敬除其舍] / And its vital essence will naturally arrive [精將自來]\". The method of \"cleaning out [\"chú\" 除 \"eliminate; remove; clean out\"] the lodging place of the numinous\" is essentially an apophatic process in which one \"gradually and systematically removes the normal feelings, desires, thoughts, and perceptions that commonly occupy consciousness\" (Roth 1999: 134). \n\n\"Xinshu I\" repeats this \"Neiye\" metaphor: \"The Tao is not far off, but it is hard to reach its limit. It rests together with man, but it is hard to grasp. Empty out your desires, and the numen will enter its abode. If the abode is not thoroughly swept clean, the numen will not remain there.\" (tr. Roth 1991: 623). It also adds recommendations to \"open its doors\" (the senses), \"relinquish selfishness\", and \"stop talking\" in order to give the practitioner \"shenming\" 神明 \"numinous clarity\" (Roth 1991: 625).\n\nSystematic breath meditation practices in the \"Neiye\" usually involve sitting in a stable position, circulating and refining the \"qi\" \"vital breath\", in order to produce concentrated \"jing\" \"vital essence\", which is thought of as the material counterpart of psychological tranquility. Since vital essence is expended in everyday activities such perceiving, thinking, and feeling, one should minimize them. Aligning the body and emptying the mind will maximize physical vitality and psychological well-being (Roth 1999: 126).\n\n\"Neiye\" Verse 24 describes breath meditation practice in which the adept \"shouyi\" 守一 \"maintains the One\" and \"yunqi\" 運氣 \"revolves the \"qi\"\", which brings about a profound tranquility. \n<poem>When you enlarge your mind and let go of it,\nWhen you relax your vital breath and expand it,\nWhen your body is calm and unmoving:\nAnd you can maintain the One and discard the myriad disturbances.\nYou will see profit and not be enticed by it,\nYou will see harm and not be frightened by it.\nRelaxed and unwound, yet acutely sensitive,\nIn solitude you delight in your own person.\nThis is called \"revolving the vital breath\":\nYour thoughts and deeds seem heavenly. (24, tr. Roth 1999: 92) </poem>\nRoth says this ancient reference to \"shouyi\", which later became a central tenet of Daoist and Chinese Buddhist meditation (Kohn 1989), describes a contemplative technique in which one sits calmly and exclusively concentrates on the Way, which enables one to set aside all the \"disturbances of perceptions, thoughts, emotions, and desires that normally fill your conscious mind\" (1999: 116).\n\nVerse 17 provides specific details about regularized breath meditation. Breathing is said to \"coil and uncoil\" (\"zhōu\" 周 \"encircle; surround\" and \"kuān\" 寬 \"let go; release; stretch out; extend\") or \"contract and expand\" (\"mì\" 密 \"snug; condense; squeezed together\" and \"shū\" 舒 \"stretch; spread out; expand; unfold\"), with coiling/contracting referring to exhalation and uncoiling/expanding to inhalation (Roth 1991: 619).\n<poem>For all [to practice] this Way:\nYou must coil, you must contract, \nYou must uncoil, you must expand,\nYou must be firm, you must be regular [in this practice].\nHold fast to this excellent [practice]; do not let go of it.\nChase away the excessive; abandon the trivial.\nAnd when you reach its ultimate limit\nYou will return to the Way and its inner power. (18, tr. Roth 1999: 78) </poem>\n\nIn addition to discussing mystical transformation through vital breath circulation, the \"Neiye\" recommends moderation in thought and diet so that the vital energy can flow freely and harmony can be achieved (Roth 1991: 619). For instance, \n<poem>Deep thinking generates knowledge.\nIdleness and carelessness generate worry.\nCruelty and arrogance generate resentment.\nWorry and grief generate illness.\nWhen illness reaches a distressing degree, you die.\nWhen you think about something and don't let go of it,\nInternally you will be distressed, externally you will be weak.\nDo not plan things out in advance\nOr else your vitality will cede its dwelling.\nIn eating, it is best not to fill up;\nIn thinking, it is best not to overdo.\nLimit these to the appropriate degree\nAnd you will naturally reach it [vitality]. (20, tr. Roth 1999: 84) </poem>\n\nThe \"Neiye\" also discusses common health concerns such as the \"way of eating\".\n<poem>For all the Way of eating [食之道] is that:\nOverfilling yourself with food will impair your vital energy\nAnd cause your body to deteriorate.\nOverrestricting your consumption causes the bones to wither\nAnd the blood to congeal.\nThe mean between overfilling and overrestricting:\nThis is called \"harmonious completion.\"\nIt is where the vital essence lodges\nAnd knowledge is generated. … (23, tr. Roth 1999: 90)</poem>\nThese holistic descriptions of harmonizing body, mind, and spirit are early references to the practice later called \"yǎngshēng\" 養生 \"nourishing one's vital principle\" (Roth 1999: 122).\n\nThe c. 4th-century \"Neiye\" had long-reaching effects on Daoism and Chinese culture. It influenced classic texts such as the \"Daodejing\" and \"Zhuangzi\", as well as what later became Daoist meditation, \"Neidan\" \"internal alchemy\", \"Daoyin\", and Daoist diet practices. It also influenced theories about the Three Treasures (\"jīng-qì-shén\" 精氣神 \"essence, vital energy, and spirit\") in traditional Chinese medicine, and may have impacted the Confucian teachings of Mencius (c. 372-c. 289 BCE) about cultivating the \"xin\" \"heartmind\" (Kirkland 2008: 771).\n\nThe \"Neiye\" had a unique position in the history of Chinese philosophy. Compared with other Hundred Schools of Thought texts from the Warring States period (475-221 BCE), the \"Neiye\" does not mention many basic philosophical theories such as yin and yang (Rickett 1985-98: 155). The text is unconcerned with political philosophy; unlike the \"Daodejing\", which contains many passages discussing the problems involved with ruling a state (Kirkland 1997: 10). Nor does the \"Neiye\" criticize Confucianism, as the \"Daodejing\" and \"Zhuangzi\" frequently do. The Neiye contains no evidence that its authors or compilers were aware of the teachings from other current philosophical traditions, neither Confucianism, Mohism, Legalism, nor the School of Yin Yang (Kirkland 2008: 772).\n\nAnother distinctive feature of the \"Neiye\" is that it lacks the early Chinese idea of \"Tian\" \"Heaven\" as a beneficent agency overseeing and guiding life. Both the Confucians and the Mohists shared ideas about \"Tian\" Heaven as the divine ruler and the \"Tianzi\" Son of Heaven as the earthly ruler (Kirkland 1997: 17). The character \"tian\" 天 appears in a number of \"Neiye\" passages, in which Roth translates it in the naturalistic sense as \"the heavens\" (for instance, \"Bright!—as if ascending the heavens\", Verse 2 above) rather than the usual deified \"heaven; Heaven\" (1999: 43). \n\nTo illustrate the c. 4th-century BCE \"Neiye\"'s effects on early Daoism, examples are given below from the c. 3rd-century BCE \"Daodejing\" and the c. 3rd/2nd-century BCE \"Zhuangzi\".\n\nThe \"Neiye\" and \"Daodejing\" have parallels as well as differences. Both texts contain teachings that originated in an oral tradition. The \"Neiye\", like much of the \"Daodejing\", is primarily composed in rhymed verse, and some scholars believe that certain sections may have been borrowed from an early Daoist hymn (Rickett 1985-98: 154). Harper suggests both texts were \"canons of physical cultivation theory\" meant for recitation by initiates who could have received fuller knowledge of its meaning either orally or in supplementary texts (1987: 561).\n\nBoth texts also share a conception of \"Dao\" \"the Way\" as the ultimate power through which everything generates and develops (Roth 1999: 145). Compare how they describe the Way and the \"wanwu\" 萬物 \"myriad things\": \"The myriad things are generated by it\" and \"The myriad things are completed by it\" (\"Neiye\" verse 6) and \"The Way gives birth to them, nourishes them, matures them, completes them, rests them, rears them, supports them, and protects them\" (\"Daodejing\" chapter 51). Both texts also similarly describe the concept of \"de\" \"inner power\". In the \"Neiye\" (verses 4 and 2), \"de\" is the aspect of the Way that we \"daily make use of\" and which we develop through refining the \"qi\" vital breath into the \"jing\" vital essence through breath meditation. The \"Daodejing\" (chapter 55) also links \"de\" and \"jing\" comparing one \"who is filled with an abundance of inner power\" with the newborn babe in whom the vital essence is maximized. The \"Neijing\"'s emphasis on the importance of attaining \"jing\" tranquility through breath meditation is also found in the \"Daodejing\", where the term occurs in 7 of the 81 chapters, for instance, to \"maintain tranquility is the central (practice)\" (16, tr. Roth 1999: 147).\n\nThe most explicit \"Daodejing\" reference to practicing breath meditation contains three phrases with close parallels to the \"Neiye\".\n<poem>Amid the daily activity of the psyche, can you embrace the One and not depart from it?\nWhen concentrating your vital breath until it is at its softest, can you be like a child?\nCan you sweep clean your Profound Mirror so you are able to have no flaws in it?\nIn loving the people and governing the state, can you do it without using knowledge?\nWhen the Gates of Heaven open and close, can you become feminine?\nIn clarifying all within the Four Directions, can you do it without using knowledge? (chapter 10, tr. Roth 1999: 150; cf. Mair 1994: 69) </poem>\nFirst, this \"Daodejing\" term \"baoyi\" 抱一 \"embracing the One\" parallels the \"Neiye\" \"zhiyi\" 執一 \"hold fast to the One\" (verse 9, tr. Roth 1999: 62), and both terms refer to retaining a sense of union with the Way in everyday life. Second, \"zhuanqi\" 專氣 \"concentrating the vital breath (until it is at its softest)\" closely resembles \"tuanqi\" 摶氣 \"concentrating your vital breath (as if numinous)\" denoting to the practice of breath meditation (19, tr. Roth 1999: 82). Third, \"dichu xuanjian\" 滌除玄覽 \" sweep clean your Profound Mirror\" and the distinctive \"Neiye\" metaphor \"jingchu qi she\" 敬除其舍 \"diligently clean out its lodging place\" (13, tr. Roth 1999: 70) share the same syntax and verb \"chu\" \"eliminate; remove\". These three textual counterparts demonstrate that the redactors of both the \"Neiye\" and \"Daodejing\" shared knowledge of traditional proto-Daoist meditation techniques through which one could directly experience the Way and its inner power (Roth 1999: 152). \n\nNotwithstanding these similarities and parallels, there are significant differences between the two texts. As already mentioned, the \"Neiye\" contains virtually no political philosophy, which is a major focus in the \"Daodejing\". There is no trace in the \"Neiye\" of many now-famous themes of the \"Daodejing\", such as \"wu\" \"non-being\", \"ziran\" \"naturally; spontaneously\", \"wuwei\" \"non-interference\", \"pu\" \"uncarved; unhewn\", \"xian\" \"transcendent; immortal\", and \"xu\" 虛 \"emptiness\" (Kirkland 2008: 772-773). Unlike the \"Daodejing\" gender-based concepts of the Dao as mother, the Mysterious Female, and \"feminine\" behaviors such as humility or yielding, the \"Neiye\" has nothing to say about gender, which hints that women as well as men may have engaged in mediation practices (Kirkland 1997: 16).\n\nIn addition, the authors/compilers of the \"Zhuangzi\" were clearly familiar with \"Neiye\" inner cultivation practices. The \"Zhuangzi\" text contains both weak and strong evidence of meditation techniques shared with the \"Neiye\". Some passages contain similar terminology and others use sentences that are almost identical with those in the \"Neiye\" (Roth 1999: 153). Here are two examples.\n\nIn the first passage, the character Wearcoat (被衣) instructs Gnaw Gap (齧缺) about the Way. \n<poem>You must align your body [正汝形],\nUnify your vision,\nAnd the heavenly harmony will arrive.\nGather in your knowledge,\nUnify your attention, \nAnd the numinous will enter its lodging place [神將來舍],\nThe inner power will beautify you,\nAnd the Way will reside in you.\nYou will see things with the eyes of a newborn calf\nAnd will not seek out their precedents. (22, tr. Roth 1999: 158; cf. Mair 1994: 213-214) </poem>\n\"Zhengxing\" 正形 \"aligning the body\" is a basic \"Neiye\" practice, and \"jing chu qi she\" 敬除其舍 \"cleaning out the lodging place of the numinous\" resembles this \"shen jianglai she\" 神將來舍 \"the numinous will enter its lodging place\".\n\nIn the second \"Zhuangzi\" passage, Laozi instructs Nanrong Zhu (南榮趎) about meditation practices by paraphrasing, if not quoting, the \"Neiye\".\n<poem>The practice for guarding vitality [衛生之經]:\nCan you embrace the One [能抱一乎]?\nCan you not lose it [能勿失乎]?\nCan you not resort to divining by tortoise or milfoil [能無卜筮]?\nYet know good and bad fortune [而知吉凶乎]?\nCan you be still? Can you cease [能止乎能已乎]?\nCan you quit (seeking for) it in others [能舍諸人]\nAnd seek for within yourself [而求諸己乎]?\nCan you be casual?\nCan you be naive?\nCan you be like a child?\nThe child howls all day but its throat does not become hoarse. (tr. Roth 1999: 159)</poem>\nThese \"Zhuangzi\" instructions are an almost verbatim repetition of \"Neiye\" Verse 19.\n<poem>By concentrating your vital breath as if numinous, \nThe myriad things will all be contained within you.\nCan you concentrate? Can you unite with them [能一乎]?\nCan you not resort to divining by tortoise or milfoil [能無卜筮]?\nYet know bad and good fortune [而知吉凶乎]?\nCan you stop? Can you cease [能止乎能已乎]?\nCan you not seek it in others [能勿求諸人]?,\nYet attain it within yourself [而得之己乎]? … (tr. Roth 1999: 82)</poem>\nBased upon the remarkable correspondences between these contexts, the authors of this \"Zhuangzi\" chapter were unquestionably familiar with the \"Neiye\" or a similar text (Roth 1999: 160).\n\nThe contents of the \"Neiye\" are distinct from either the \"Daodejing\" or the \"Zhuangzi\", despite the striking similarities among the texts. Since the \"Neiye\" was written earlier than the \"Daodejing\", Kirkland proposes that it could be interpreted as an example of the earliest known Daoist teachings. Since the compilers of the \"Daodejing\" were clearly interested in the same social and political issues that concerned members of other philosophical schools, one could reasonably characterize the teachings of the \"Neiye\" as \"original Daoism,\" and the teachings of the \"Daodejing\" as \"applied Daoism.\" Although both texts apparently developed from the same general tradition, the \"Neiye\" compilers were primarily interested in self-cultivation practices, the \"Daodejing\" compilers were also interested in the broader issues of living in human society (Roth 1997: 18-19).\n\nThere is evidence that the \"Neiye\" also influenced the teachings of Mencius (c. 370-c. 290 BCE) on cultivating the \"xin\" heartmind and building up \"qi\", which later developed into Neo-Confucian ideals of self-cultivation (Kirkland 2008: 771). In the \"Mencius\", Mencius tells his disciple Gongsun Chou 公孫丑, \"At forty, I attained to an unperturbed mind [\"budong xin\" 不動心]\" adding that attaining it is not difficult and another disciple Gaozi achieved it at a younger age. Mencius also says, \"I am good at nourishing my flood-like \"ch'i\" [\"haoran zhi qi\" 浩然之氣]\". When asked what that means, he explains,\nMencius's description of a sage's \"qi\" vital energy as \"haoran\" 浩然 \"flood-like\" was likely taken from this \"Neiye\" passage: \n<poem>For those who preserve and naturally generate vital essence \nOn the outside a calmness will flourish. \nStored inside, we take it to be the well spring. \nFloodlike, it harmonizes and equalizes [浩然和平]\nAnd we take it to be the fount of the vital energy. (15, tr. Roth 1999: 74) </poem>\nGraham dates the \"Neiye\" from the 4th century BCE, and says its practices may predate the hypothetical split between Confucianism and Daoism (1989: 100).\n\nAnother \"Neiye\"-\"Mencius\" textual parallel exists between \"By concentrating your vital breath as if numinous, / The myriad things will all be contained within you [摶氣如神萬物備存].\" (19, tr. Roth 1999: 82, see \"Zhuangzi\" above) and \"Mencius said, 'The myriad things are all here at my disposal in myself [萬物皆備於我矣]. There is no greater joy than to look back into oneself and find integrity'.\" (7A/4, tr. Graham 1989: 127, cf. Legge 1875: 345) \n\nBoth the \"Neiye\" and \"Mencius\" assume that one is born with an inherently perfect heartmind, and when one becomes confused that perfection is lost, but one can return to the original state of heart/mind by allowing an inherent harmony to replace the confusion. Kirkland reasons that since these ideas seem more integral to the teachings of the \"Neiye\", it is logical to conclude that the ideas, if not the text itself, may have been known to Mencius or at least to his text's compilers (1997: 3, 11).\n\nThe c. 4th century BCE \"Neiye\" is connected with a corpus of 2nd century BCE medical and physical cultivation texts that archaeologists discovered in Western Han dynasty tombs. The c. 168 BCE Mawangdui Silk Texts, excavated in 1973 near Changsha, Hunan, include several previously-unknown medical texts, such as the \"Wushi'er Bingfang\" \"Recipes for Fifty-Two Ailments\" and \"Shiwen\" 十問 \"Ten Questions\". The c. 186 BCE Zhangjiashan Han bamboo texts, excavated in 1983 near Linyi, Hubei, include additional writings on medicine and health. One of the most widely known Mawangdui silk texts is the \"Daoyin tu\" 導引圖 \"Drawings of Guiding and Pulling\" that illustrates 44 sitting and standing \"daoyin\" exercises.\n\nThe psychophysiological cultivation practices in the \"Neiye\" and the Mawangdui and Zhangjiashan texts have numerous parallels. They share technical vocabulary for breath cultivation, particularly the three basic elements of human physiology: \"qi\" vital energy, \"jing\" vital essence, and \"shen\" spirit. The texts also similarly describe circulating the vital energy in a stable, sitting posture with the spine erect (Roth 1999: 110, 168). Furthermore, the \"Neiye\" and the Mawangdui Four Texts manuscript share a rhyme scheme associated with the state of Chu, and contain identical passages, thus indicating \"an affinity that is too close to be a matter of chance\" (Rickett 1993: 248-249).\n\nHowever, the \"Neiye\" and the excavated texts give different purposes for practicing inner cultivation. The Mawangdui and Zhangjiashan manuscripts are primarily concerned with goals of better health and longer life; although the \"Neiye\" occasionally mentions the physical benefits of breath cultivation, its goals are more psychological and spiritual (Roth 1999: 169). For example, the Mawangdui text that most closely resembles the \"Neiye\" is the \"Shiwen\" Ten Questions. While both mention \"tuanqi\" 摶氣 \"concentrating your vital breath\", it is done in order to attain the Way in the \"Neiye\" but to achieve longevity in the \"Shiwen\" (19, tr. Roth 1999: 82). Both texts describe \"jing\" as being like a \"quanyuan\" 泉原 \"wellspring\", but in the \"Neiye\" vital essence is generated in order to attain tranquility (15, Roth 1999: 74), while in the \"Shiwen\" it is generated by \"sucking in vital energy\" and circulating it into the extremities (Roth 1999: 169).\n\nUnlike the \"Neiye\" that discourses on philosophical and mystical concepts of human physiology, the Mawangdui and Zhangjiashan texts focus on teaching practical techniques for bodily care and long life. Based on the \"Neiye\" text, Harper thinks that Warring States cultivation theory and practice was an esoteric tradition with few actual practitioners. The Mawangdui and Zhangjiashan texts suggest that physical cultivation was popular in the 3rd and 2nd centuries BCE (1998: 126). While the excavated texts do not mention how many people practiced the techniques and recipes, the literature was clearly available and represented a kind of \"baseline macrobiotic hygiene for the elite\" (Harper 1998: 114).\n\n\n"}

Meaning \"denoting or relating to a numen\", it describes the power or presence or realisation of a divinity. It is etymologically unrelated to Immanuel Kant's \"noumenon\", a Greek term referring to an unknowable reality underlying all things.\n\nThe word was popularized by the German theologian Rudolf Otto in his influential 1917 book \"Das Heilige\", which appeared in English as \"The Idea of the Holy\" in 1923. Otto writes that while the concept of \"the holy\" is often used to convey moral perfection – and does entail this – it contains another distinct element, beyond the ethical sphere, for which he uses the term numinous. He explains the numinous as a \"non-rational, non-sensory experience or feeling whose primary and immediate object is outside the self\". This mental state \"presents itself as \"ganz Andere\", wholly other, a condition absolutely \"sui generis\" and incomparable whereby the human being finds himself utterly abashed.\" Otto argues that because the numinous is irreducible and \"sui generis\" it cannot be defined in terms of other concepts or experiences, and that the reader must therefore be \"guided and led on by consideration and discussion of the matter through the ways of his own mind, until he reach the point at which 'the numinous' in him perforce begins to stir... In other words, our \"X\" cannot, strictly speaking, be taught, it can only be evoked, awakened in the mind.\" Chapters 4 to 6 are devoted to attempting to evoke the numinous and its various aspects. Using Latin, he describes it as a mystery () that is at once terrifying (\"tremendum\") and fascinating (\"fascinans\"). He writes:\n\nC.S. Lewis described the numinous experience as follows in \"The Problem of Pain\":\nOtto's use of the term as referring to a characteristic of religious experience was influential among certain intellectuals of the subsequent generation. For example, \"numinous\" as understood by Otto was a frequently quoted concept in the writings of Carl Jung, and C. S. Lewis. The notion of the numinous and the \"wholly Other\" were also central to the religious studies of the ethnologist Mircea Eliade. \"Mysterium tremendum\", another phrase coined by Otto to describe the numinous, is presented by Aldous Huxley in \"The Doors of Perception\" in this way:\nIn a book length scholarly treatment of the subject in fantasy literature, Chris Brawley devotes chapters to the concept in \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\" by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, in \"Phantastes\" by George Macdonald, in the \"Chronicles of Narnia\" by C.S. Lewis and \"The Lord of the Rings\" by J.R.R. Tolkien, and in work by Algernon Blackwood and Ursula Le Guin (e.g., \"The Centaur\" and \"Buffalo Gals, Won't You Come Out Tonight,\" respectively).\n\nIn his 2007 book \"God Is Not Great\" and in subsequent interviews and debates, New Atheist author Christopher Hitchens used the term \"numinous\" favorably. After interviewing him, Marilyn Sewell wrote that he \"us[ed] words like numinous and transcendent and soul\"—quoting him as saying, \"Everybody has had the experience at some point when they feel that there's more to life than just matter\"—but said that he emphasized separating this from clerical or otherworldly authority.\n\n\n"}

The central questions of this study concern the epistemology and ontology of motion, whether motion exists as we perceive it, what is it, and, if it exists, how does it occur. The philosophy of motion is important in the study of theories of change in natural systems and is closely connected to studies of space and time in philosophy.\n\nThe philosophy of motion was of central concern to Ancient Greek and Roman philosophers, particularly the pre-Socratic philosophers such as Parmenides, Zeno of Elea, Heraclitus and Democritus. As such, it was influential in the development of the philosophy of science in general.\n\nThe concept of motion is closely related to the idea of change, and it is arguments about what made change possible that led the early Greek philosophers to pioneer naturalistic explanations for phenomena.\n\nHeraclitus had famously declared that \"all is motion\".\n\nParmenides professed that from our human point of view there are two aspects to the study of the universe of which we must be aware, on the one hand how we see it, and on the other how it must really be. Motion is a fact from our point of view, but Parmenides argues that as far as things must really be, it is logically impossible that motion could exist as we perceive it.\n\nZeno of Elea, a pupil of Parmenides, formulated the Arguments against motion, more commonly referred to as the paradoxes, in order to support his masters theories of the One and of the consequent impossibility of motion at the fundamental level. The rigorous denial of even the possibility of motion forced a more thorough response from philosophers engaged on the same theoretical project.\n\nIn response, Democritus expounded the atomic theory, in which indivisible bits of matter are in constant motion through the void. In the absence of something to perturb them they fall evenly through space.\n\nMotion conceived in this way led naturally to questions of free will and determinism. In response to this, Epicurus appears to have included the concept of the clinamen, or atomic swerve. This tiny random motion serves to bring atoms into contact and begin the cascade that leads to the organisation of matter as we see it now., it also introduced an element of uncertainty which appears to have been an important concept in Epicurus' insistence on the existence of individual choice.\n\nAristotle, in his physics, defines motion as the actuality of a potentiality.\n\nThe philosophy of motion is treated by the Buddhist philosopher Nagarjuna in his treatise the Mūlamadhyamakakārikā or Fundamental verses of the Middle Way, in the 2nd and 3rd century CE.\n\nFurther east, in China, the Sanlun school of Mahayana Buddhism developed a sophisticated philosophy of motion under the philosopher Sengzhao. His treatise called The Immutability of Things, deals with motion explicitly.\n\nAztec metaphysics gave priority to motion over substance in its cosmological ontology. In other words, process was seen to be fundamental and objects or substances as ephemeral. Change therefore was naturally conceived of as motion, and this motion was divided into three forms, out of which all change occurs. These were named olin (bouncing, oscillating) malinalli (spinning, twisting, spiralling) and, the most important, nepantla (weaving, intersecting, joining, balancing).\n\n\nAchieving a coherent understanding of motion has been, and continues to be, of importance in understanding the nature of space and time in modern science. The main philosophical debate has been between absolute and relational conceptions of motion.\n\nMotion in complex systems such as protein folding.\n\nMorphogenesis of animal bodies and change on large and small scales. Niche construction.\n\nThe work of Nottale.\n\nQuestions of the nature of motion continue to arise in modern physics, with many of the issues of concern to early thinkers arising in different form.

{"id": "3340088", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3340088", "title": "QAnon", "text": "QAnon\n\nQAnon () is a far-right conspiracy theory which began with an October 2017 post on the anonymous imageboard 4chan by someone using the tripcode Q, a presumably American individual that may have later grown to include multiple individuals claiming to have access to classified information involving the Trump administration and its opponents in the United States. The theory details a supposed secret conspiracy by an alleged \"deep state\" against U.S. President Donald Trump and his supporters. The account has falsely accused numerous liberal Hollywood actors, politicians, and high-ranking officials of engaging in an international child sex trafficking ring, and that Trump feigned collusion with Russians to enlist Robert Mueller to join him in exposing the ring and preventing a coup d'état by Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and George Soros. \"Q\" is a reference to the top-secret Q clearance.\n\nThe conspiracy theory, mainly popularized by supporters of President Trump under the names The Storm and The Great Awakening, has been widely characterized as \"baseless\", \"unhinged\" and \"evidence-free\". Its proponents have been called \"a deranged conspiracy cult\" and \"some of the Internet's most \"outré\" Trump fans\".\n\nQAnon adherents began appearing at Trump rallies during the summer of 2018 and a major promoter of the conspiracy theory was granted a photo op with President Trump in the Oval Office on August 24, 2018.\n\nMany media outlets have described QAnon as an \"offshoot\" of the widely discredited and debunked Pizzagate conspiracy theory. \n\nA person identifying as \"Q Clearance Patriot\" first appeared on the /pol/ board of 4chan on October 28, 2017, posting messages in a thread entitled \"Calm Before the Storm\", which was a reference to Trump's cryptic description during a gathering of himself and United States military leaders as \"the calm before the storm\". Q later moved to 8chan, citing concerns that the 4chan board had been compromised by \"bad actors\".\n\nThe poster's handle implied that the anonymous poster holds Q clearance, a United States Department of Energy security clearance required for access to Top Secret information about nuclear weapons and materials. This claim cannot be substantiated due to a lack of reliable evidence.\n\nQAnon's posting campaign has a history of false, baseless and unsubstantiated claims. Starting with the first posts incorrectly predicting Hillary Clinton's imminent arrest and followed by more false allegations, such as claiming that North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un is a puppet ruler installed by the Central Intelligence Agency, QAnon's posts have become more cryptic and vague allowing followers to map their own beliefs into them. By generating a keyboard heatmap of QAnon's supposedly coded messages, information security researcher Mark Burnett concluded that they \"are not actual codes, just random typing by someone who might play an instrument and uses a QWERTY keyboard\", adding that \"almost all the characters\" in the codes alternate between the left and right hands, or the characters are close to each other on the keyboard.\n\nSome of QAnon's more concrete allegations include his February 16, 2018 false claim that U.S. Representative and former Democratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz hired El Salvadorian gang MS-13 to murder DNC staffer Seth Rich, and his March 1, 2018 apparent suggestion that German Chancellor Angela Merkel is the granddaughter of Adolf Hitler. A July 7, 2018 article published in \"The Daily Beast\" also noted that QAnon falsely claimed that \"each mass shooting is a false-flag attack organized by the cabal\". Other beliefs held by QAnon adherents include that Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, George Soros, and others are planning a coup while simultaneously involved as members of an international child sex trafficking ring. According to this idea, the Mueller investigation is actually a countercoup led by Donald Trump, who pretended to collude with Russia in order to hire Robert Mueller to secretly investigate the Democrats. Another recurring theme is that certain Hollywood stars are pedophiles, and that the Rothschild family are the leaders of a satanic cult. By interpreting the information fed to them by Q, QAnon adherents come to these conclusions.\n\nOn multiple occasions, QAnon has dismissed his false claims and incorrect predictions as wilful misinformation, claiming that \"disinformation is necessary\". This has led Australian psychologist Stephan Lewandowsky to emphasize the \"self-sealing\" quality of the conspiracy theory, highlighting its anonymous purveyor's use of plausible deniability and noting that evidence against the theory \"can become evidence of [its] validity in the minds of believers\".\n\nThere has been much speculation regarding the motive and the identity of the poster, with theories ranging from the poster being a military intelligence officer, to Donald Trump himself, to the posting campaign being an alternate reality game by Cicada 3301. Because 4chan is anonymous and does not allow registration by users, any number of individuals may post using the same handle. The poster uses a frequently changing tripcode to authenticate himself on 8chan.\n\nThe Italian leftist Wu Ming foundation has speculated that QAnon has been inspired by the Luther Blissett persona, which was used by leftists and anarchists to organize pranks, media stunts, and hoaxes in the 1990s. \"Blissett\" also published the novel \"Q\" in 1999.\n\nIn September 2018, Jack Posobiec, a conspiracy theorist and correspondent for One America News Network, claimed to know the identity of the creators of QAnon. According to him, the phenomenon was started by two pro-Trump Twitter trolls who intended to generate enthusiasm among Trump supporters following the Unite the Right rally, which was viewed as a disaster for the far-right. Posobiec claims that the letter Q was indeed chosen due to the Italian novel, and that the conspiracy theory was carefully assembled from pieces of Wikileaks information drops, Pizzagate, and Infowars rhetoric. After the original authors ended their involvement, a new group – supposedly called ″the Patriot Soapbox group″ – continued it and moved to an 8chan board moderated by them, apparently in an effort to make money. (On 8chan, users are allowed to set up and moderate their own boards, whereas boards and moderation on 4chan are completely controlled by the site staff.) The profit-oriented approach to QAnon has since then been joined by others, including a person who sells ″exclusive Q decodes″ via Patreon.\n\nOn March 14, 2018, Reddit banned one of its communities discussing QAnon, /r/CBTS_Stream, for \"encouraging or inciting violence and posting personal and confidential information\". Following this, some followers moved to Discord. Several other communities were formed for discussion of QAnon, leading to further bans on September 12, 2018 in response to these communities \"inciting violence, harassment, and the dissemination of personal information\", which led to thousands of adherents regrouping on Voat, a Switzerland-based Reddit clone that has been described as a hub for the alt-right.\n\nOn June 15, 2018, Matthew Phillip Wright of Henderson, Nevada, was arrested on terrorism and other charges for driving an armored vehicle, containing an AR-15 and handgun, to the Hoover Dam and blocking traffic for 90 minutes. He said he was on a mission involving QAnon: to demand that the Justice Department \"release the OIG report\" on the conduct of FBI agents during the investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server. Since a copy of the OIG report had been released the day prior, the man had been motivated by a Q \"drop\" which claimed the released version of the OIG report had been heavily modified.\n\nAn app called \"QDrops\" which promoted the conspiracy theory was published on the Apple App Store and Google Play. It became the most popular paid app in the \"entertainment\" section of Apple's online store in April 2018, and the tenth most popular paid app overall. On July 15, 2018, Apple pulled the app after an inquiry from NBC News.\n\nOn July 29, 2018, Q posted a link to Stormy Daniels' attorney Michael Avenatti's website and photos of his Newport Beach, California, office building, along with the message, \"Buckle up!\". The anonymous poster then shared the picture of an as-of-yet unidentified man, appearing to be holding a cellphone in one hand, and a long, thin object in the other, standing in the street near Avenatti's office, adding that a message \"had been sent\". This sparked an investigation by the Newport Beach Police Department. On July 30, Avenatti asked his Twitter followers to contact the Newport Beach Police Department if they \"have any details or observed\" the man in the picture.\n\nOn August 1, 2018, responding to a question by David Martosko of \"The Daily Mail\" asking if the White House encouraged the support of \"QAnon fringe groups\"—in light of their hostile behavior toward CNN chief White House correspondent Jim Acosta at a Trump rally in Tampa, Florida—White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders denounced \"any group that would incite violence against another individual\", without specifically responding to the QAnon mention. She added that President Trump \"certainly doesn't support groups that would support that type of behavior\".\n\nThe conspiracy theory's targeting of George Soros and the Rothschild family has led Jewish-American magazine \"The Forward\" as well as \"The Washington Post\" to accuse it of containing \"striking anti-Semitic elements\" and \"garden-variety nonsense with racist and anti-Semitic undertones\". However, this was contested by the Anti-Defamation League, which reported that \"the vast majority of QAnon-inspired conspiracy theories have nothing to do with anti-Semitism\".\n\nA Jewish Telegraphic Agency article published in \"Haaretz\" on August 3, 2018 stated that \"although not specifically, some of QAnon's archetypical elements—including secret elites and kidnapped children, among others—are reflective of historical and ongoing anti-Semitic conspiracy theories\".\n\nOn November 26, 2017, President Donald Trump retweeted a tweet from Twitter account @MAGAPILL, a self-styled \"official President Donald Trump accomplishment list\" and a major proponent of the conspiracy theory, less than a month after QAnon first started posting.\n\nOn December 28, 2017, the Russian government-funded television network RT aired a segment discussing \"QAnon revelations\", referring to the anonymous poster as a \"secret intelligence operative inside the Trump administration known by QAnon\".\n\nOn January 9, 2018, Fox News commentator Sean Hannity shared QAnon-related material on his Twitter account.\n\nOn March 13, 2018, Operation Rescue vice president and pro-life activist Cheryl Sullenger referred to QAnon as a \"small group of insiders close to President Donald J. Trump\" and called his internet postings the \"highest level of intelligence to ever be dropped publicly in our known history\".\n\nOn March 15, 2018, Kiev-based \"\", the official newspaper of the Communist Party of Ukraine, published an article calling QAnon a \"military intelligence group\".\n\nOn March 31, 2018, U.S. actress Roseanne Barr appeared to promote the conspiracy theory, which was subsequently covered by CNN, \"The Washington Post\", and \"The New York Times\".\n\nWhile the conspiracy theory was initially promoted by Alex Jones and Jerome Corsi, it was reported by Right Wing Watch that they had both ceased to support QAnon by May 2018, declaring the source to now be \"completely compromised\". However, in August 2018, Corsi reversed course and stated that he \"will comment on and follow QAnon when QAnon is bringing forth news\", adding that \"in the last few days, QAnon has been particularly good\".\n\nOn June 26, 2018, WikiLeaks publicly accused QAnon of \"leading anti-establishment Trump voters to embrace regime change and neo-conservatism\". QAnon had previously pushed for regime change in Iran. Two days later, the whistleblower organization shared an analysis by Internet Party president Suzie Dawson, claiming that QAnon's posting campaign is an \"intelligence agency-backed psyop\" aiming to \"round up people that are otherwise dangerous to the Deep State (because they are genuinely opposed to it) usurp time & attention, & trick them into serving its aims\".\n\nOn June 28, 2018, a \"Time\" magazine article listed the anonymous \"Q\" among the 25 Most Influential People on the Internet in 2018. Counting more than 130,000 related discussion videos on YouTube, \"Time\" cited the wide range of this conspiracy theory and its more prominent followers and spreading news coverage.\n\nOn July 4, 2018, the Hillsborough County Republican Party shared on its official Facebook and Twitter accounts a YouTube video on QAnon, calling QAnon a \"mysterious anonymous inside leaker of deep state activities and counter activities by President Trump\". The posts were then deleted.\n\nOn August 1, 2018, following the \"en masse\" presence of QAnon supporters at the July 31 Trump rally in Tampa, Florida, MSNBC news anchors Hallie Jackson, Brian Williams, and Chris Hayes dedicated a portion of their respective television programs to the conspiracy theory. PBS NewsHour also ran a segment dedicated to the conspiracy theory the following day.\n\nOn August 2, 2018, Washington Post editorial writer Molly Roberts stated, \"The storm QAnon truthers predict will never strike because the conspiracy that obsesses them doesn’t exist. But while they wait for it, they’ll try to whip up the winds, and the rest of us will struggle to find shelter.\"\n\nOn August 4, 2018, former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer was asked to comment on the conspiracy theory in his \"ask me anything\" session on the /r/The_Donald subreddit. In response to the question \"is Q legit?\", Spicer answered \"no\".\n\nOn August 24, 2018, President Donald Trump hosted William \"Lionel\" Lebron, a leading promoter of the QAnon conspiracy, in the Oval Office for a photo op.\n\nAccording to an August 2018 Qualtrics poll for \"The Washington Post\", 58% of Floridians are familiar enough with QAnon to have an opinion about it, among whom only 24% hold a favorable view of the conspiracy theory. Positive feelings toward QAnon were found to be strongly correlated with one's proneness to conspiracy thinking.\n\nQ had predicted Republican success in the US midterm elections in November 2018, and claimed that Sessions was involved in secret work for Trump, with apparent tensions between them a cover. When Democrats made significant gains and Trump fired Sessions, there was disillusionment among many in the Q community.\n\n\nInformational notes\nCitations\nTweets\nFurther reading\n"}

{"id": "361239", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=361239", "title": "Technological utopianism", "text": "Technological utopianism\n\nTechnological utopianism (often called techno-utopianism or technoutopianism) is any ideology based on the premise that advances in science and technology could and should bring about a utopia, or at least help to fulfill one or another utopian ideal.\n\nA techno-utopia is therefore an ideal society, in which laws, government, and social conditions are solely operating for the benefit and well-being of all its citizens, set in the near- or far-future, as advanced science and technology will allow these ideal living standards to exist; for example, post-scarcity, transformations in human nature, the avoidance or prevention of suffering and even the end of death.\n\nTechnological utopianism is often connected with other discourses presenting technologies as agents of social and cultural change, such as technological determinism or media imaginaries.\n\nDouglas Rushkoff, a leading theorist on technology and cyberculture claims that technology gives everyone a chance to voice their own opinions, fosters individualistic thinking, and dilutes hierarchy and power structures by giving the power to the people. He says that the whole world is in the middle of a new Renaissance, one that is centered on technology and self-expression. However, Rushkoff makes it clear that “people don’t live their lives behind a desk with their hands on a keyboard” \n\nA tech-utopia does not disregard any problems that technology may cause, but strongly believes that technology allows mankind to make social, economic, political, and cultural advancements. Overall, Technological Utopianism views technology’s impacts as extremely positive.\n\nIn the late 20th and early 21st centuries, several ideologies and movements, such as the cyberdelic counterculture, the Californian Ideology, transhumanism, and singularitarianism, have emerged promoting a form of techno-utopia as a reachable goal. Cultural critic Imre Szeman argues technological utopianism is an irrational social narrative because there is no evidence to support it. He concludes that it shows the extent to which modern societies place faith in narratives of progress and technology overcoming things, despite all evidence to the contrary.\n\nKarl Marx believed that science and democracy were the right and left hands of what he called the move from the realm of necessity to the realm of freedom. He argued that advances in science helped delegitimize the rule of kings and the power of the Christian Church.\n\n19th-century liberals, socialists, and republicans often embraced techno-utopianism. Radicals like Joseph Priestley pursued scientific investigation while advocating democracy. Robert Owen, Charles Fourier and Henri de Saint-Simon in the early 19th century inspired communalists with their visions of a future scientific and technological evolution of humanity using reason. Radicals seized on Darwinian evolution to validate the idea of social progress. Edward Bellamy’s socialist utopia in \"Looking Backward\", which inspired hundreds of socialist clubs in the late 19th century United States and a national political party, was as highly technological as Bellamy’s imagination. For Bellamy and the Fabian Socialists, socialism was to be brought about as a painless corollary of industrial development.\n\nMarx and Engels saw more pain and conflict involved, but agreed about the inevitable end. Marxists argued that the advance of technology laid the groundwork not only for the creation of a new society, with different property relations, but also for the emergence of new human beings reconnected to nature and themselves. At the top of the agenda for empowered proletarians was \"to increase the total productive forces as rapidly as possible\". The 19th and early 20th century Left, from social democrats to communists, were focused on industrialization, economic development and the promotion of reason, science, and the idea of progress.\n\nSome technological utopians promoted eugenics. Holding that in studies of families, such as the Jukes and Kallikaks, science had proven that many traits such as criminality and alcoholism were hereditary, many advocated the sterilization of those displaying negative traits. Forcible sterilization programs were implemented in several states in the United States.\n\nH.G. Wells in works such as \"The Shape of Things to Come\" promoted technological utopianism.\n\nThe horrors of the 20th century – namely fascist dictatorships and the world wars – caused many to abandon optimism. The Holocaust, as Theodor Adorno underlined, seemed to shatter the ideal of Condorcet and other thinkers of the Enlightenment, which commonly equated scientific progress with social progress.\n\nA movement of techno-utopianism began to flourish again in the dot-com culture of the 1990s, particularly in the West Coast of the United States, especially based around Silicon Valley. The Californian Ideology was a set of beliefs combining bohemian and anti-authoritarian attitudes from the counterculture of the 1960s with techno-utopianism and support for libertarian economic policies. It was reflected in, reported on, and even actively promoted in the pages of \"Wired\" magazine, which was founded in San Francisco in 1993 and served for a number years as the \"bible\" of its adherents.\n\nThis form of techno-utopianism reflected a belief that technological change revolutionizes human affairs, and that digital technology in particular – of which the Internet was but a modest harbinger – would increase personal freedom by freeing the individual from the rigid embrace of bureaucratic big government. \"Self-empowered knowledge workers\" would render traditional hierarchies redundant; digital communications would allow them to escape the modern city, an \"obsolete remnant of the industrial age\".\n\nSimilar forms of \"digital utopianism\" has often entered in the political messages of party and social movements that point to the Web or more broadly to new media as harbingers of political and social change. Its adherents claim it transcended conventional \"right/left\" distinctions in politics by rendering politics obsolete. However, techno-utopianism disproportionately attracted adherents from the libertarian right end of the political spectrum. Therefore, techno-utopians often have a hostility toward government regulation and a belief in the superiority of the free market system. Prominent \"oracles\" of techno-utopianism included George Gilder and Kevin Kelly, an editor of \"Wired\" who also published several books.\n\nDuring the late 1990s dot-com boom, when the speculative bubble gave rise to claims that an era of \"permanent prosperity\" had arrived, techno-utopianism flourished, typically among the small percentage of the population who were employees of Internet startups and/or owned large quantities of high-tech stocks. With the subsequent crash, many of these dot-com techno-utopians had to rein in some of their beliefs in the face of the clear return of traditional economic reality.\n\nIn the late 1990s and especially during the first decade of the 21st century, technorealism and techno-progressivism are stances that have risen among advocates of technological change as critical alternatives to techno-utopianism. However, technological utopianism persists in the 21st century as a result of new technological developments and their impact on society. For example, several technical journalists and social commentators, such as Mark Pesce, have interpreted the WikiLeaks phenomenon and the United States diplomatic cables leak in early December 2010 as a precursor to, or an incentive for, the creation of a techno-utopian transparent society. Cyber-utopianism, first coined by Evgeny Morozov, is another manifestation of this, in particular in relation to the Internet and social networking.\n\nBernard Gendron, a professor of philosophy at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee, defines the four principles of modern technological utopians in the late 20th and early 21st centuries as follows:\n\n\nRushkoff presents us with multiple claims that surround the basic principles of Technological Utopianism:\n\n\nCritics claim that techno-utopianism's identification of social progress with scientific progress is a form of positivism and scientism. Critics of modern libertarian techno-utopianism point out that it tends to focus on \"government interference\" while dismissing the positive effects of the regulation of business. They also point out that it has little to say about the environmental impact of technology and that its ideas have little relevance for much of the rest of the world that are still relatively quite poor (see global digital divide).\n\nIn his 2010 study \"System Failure: Oil, Futurity, and the Anticipation of Disaster\", Canada Research Chairholder in cultural studies Imre Szeman argues that technological utopianism is one of the social narratives that prevent people from acting on the knowledge they have concerning the effects of oil on the environment.\n\nIn a controversial article \"Techno-Utopians are Mugged by Reality\", Wall Street Journal explores the concept of the violation of free speech by shutting down social media to stop violence. As a result of British cities being looted consecutively, Prime British Minister David Cameron argued that the government should have the ability to shut down social media during crime sprees so that the situation could be contained. A poll was conducted to see if Twitter users would prefer to let the service be closed temporarily or keep it open so they can chat about the famous television show X-Factor. The end report showed that every Tweet opted for X-Factor. The negative social effects of technological utopia is that society is so addicted to technology that we simply can't be parted even for the greater good. While many Techno-Utopians would like to believe that digital technology is for the greater good, it can also be used negatively to bring harm to the public.\n\nOther critics of a techno-utopia include the worry of the human element. Critics suggest that a techno-utopia may lessen human contact, leading to a distant society. Another concern is the amount of reliance society may place on their technologies in these techno-utopia settings. These criticisms are sometimes referred to as a technological anti-utopian view or a techno-dystopia.\n\nEven today, the negative social effects of a technological utopia can be seen. Mediated communication such as phone calls, instant messaging and text messaging are steps towards a utopian world in which one can easily contact another regardless of time or location. However, mediated communication removes many aspects that are helpful in transferring messages. As it stands today, most text, email, and instant messages offer fewer nonverbal cues about the speaker’s feelings than do face-to-face encounters. This makes it so that mediated communication can easily be misconstrued and the intended message is not properly conveyed. With the absence of tone, body language, and environmental context, the chance of a misunderstanding is much higher, rendering the communication ineffective. In fact, mediated technology can be seen from a dystopian view because it can be detrimental to effective interpersonal communication. These criticisms would only apply to messages that are prone to misinterpretation as not every text based communication requires contextual cues. The limitations of lacking tone and body language in text based communication are likely to be mitigated by video and augmented reality versions of digital communication technologies.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "54209301", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54209301", "title": "The KGB and Soviet Disinformation", "text": "The KGB and Soviet Disinformation\n\nThe KGB and Soviet Disinformation: An Insider's View is a non-fiction book about the KGB's use of disinformation and information warfare during the Soviet Union period. It was written by former intelligence officer specializing in disinformation for the Czech Intelligence Service and retired professor of disinformation at Boston University, Ladislav Bittman (now known as Lawrence Martin-Bittman).\n\nUnder the direction of the Soviet secret police, Bittman was deputy chief of the disinformation division for Czech intelligence called the Department for Active Measures and Disinformation. In the book, he warns how disinformation can lead to blowback, causing unintended consequences from intelligence agency actions, which were harmful to the Soviet Union. The book includes case studies of joint disinformation campaigns by the Soviet Union and Czech intelligence and their repercussions, including a successful operation to stop the building of an aerospace center in West Germany and a failed plot to accuse CBS News anchor Dan Rather of murder in Afghanistan.\n\nThe book received a positive reception from \"SAIS Review\", where it was called \"fascinating reading\". \"Foreign Affairs\" gave a mixed review saying the author exaggerated the role of the KGB. One review in the \"International Journal of Intelligence and CounterIntelligence\" called the book \"an excellent study\" and its author \"the top authority on disinformation in the U.S.\", while another in the same journal said it lacked depth. It was also reviewed in the Italian language \"Rivista di Studi Politici Internazionali\".\n\nLadislav Bittman graduated from Charles University in Prague in 1954 and was recruited by Czech intelligence. He served within the Czechoslovak intelligence agency as its deputy chief of the disinformation division, the Department for Active Measures and Disinformation, from 1964–1966. This division was under the control of the Soviet secret police. One of his significant achievements in disinformation was Operation Neptune, where a falsified list of Nazi spies was obtained by the media and believed as accurate. In 1967, he was assigned to Vienna, Austria in an undercover operation as a press attaché, to recruit European reporters as secret agents that Soviet intelligence could use to spread disinformation. He chose to defect to the United States in 1968 at the conclusion of the period known as the Prague Spring, after the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia. The Czechoslovak government sentenced Bittman to death for treason; his sentence was removed 20 years later.\n\nBittman became a professor in the department of communication at Boston University (BU) and began to use the name Lawrence Martin. While there, Bittman taught journalism with a focus on disinformation at BU and founded the Program for the Study of Disinformation, the first academic center in the U.S. to focus on the study of disinformation. Prior to the publication of \"The KGB and Soviet Disinformation\", Bittman had written a book on the history of disinformation in Soviet covert operations, \"The Deception Game: Czechoslovak Intelligence in Soviet Political Warfare\" (1972).\n\nBittman recounts his time as a Czech State Security (StB) expert at misleading individuals. He describes information warfare tactics used by the Soviet Union, which they internally referred to as disinformation, intended to fool and defraud others. The author defines disinformation as \"a carefully constructed false message leaked to an opponent's communication system in order to deceive the decision-making elite or the public\". Ideally, such methods would confuse foreign beliefs about key issues affecting the Soviet Union. The author recounts covert operations that significantly affected international relations. Bittman writes that for disinformation covert operation campaigns to succeed, \"every disinformation message must at least partially correspond to reality or generally accepted views\". In some instances such covert operations led to blowback and unintended consequences from intelligence agency actions, which were harmful to the Soviet Union. Bittman argues such disinformation tactics had the cumulative effect of negative political consequences to the Soviet Union, because its subterfuge campaigns injected false information into society.\n\nThe author recalls a StB operation which began in 1964 with the assistance of the KGB, whose goal was to inflame public opinion within Indonesia and increase negative perceptions towards the U.S. The operation targeted an Ambassador from Indonesia through a honeypot espionage ploy, tempting him with attractive women. The KGB and StB agents were able to turn the Indonesian Ambassador to their interests and through him they passed along to President of Indonesia Sukarno fabricated analyses and false documents, alleging the Central Intelligence Agency was planning to harm him. In particular, a specific false report stated a fictitious strategy supposedly planned by the United Kingdom jointly with the U.S., to invade Indonesia through Malaysia. Another such forgery claimed that the CIA plotted a covert assassination attempt on the Indonesian president.\n\nThe KGB and StB ruse succeeded in causing paranoia and the Indonesia president began to make public statements highly critical of the U.S. Reporters within the employ of the two Soviet intelligence agencies promptly capitalized on Sukarno's remarks and incensed the Indonesians with broadcasts of the false reporting on Radio Moscow and groups of angry citizens attacked U.S. buildings in the city of Jakarta. Negative commentary about the U.S. grew markedly within the country at a rapid pace. Perceptions of American interests within the country were decreased to a negligible level, directly due to the Soviet intelligence disinformation campaign.\n\nBittman recounts other case studies, including efforts by the Soviet intelligence services to influence the views of the Third World against Americans so that such countries would support Russian interests in the United Nations. The author details fruitful efforts of the KGB to stop the building of an aerospace facility in West Germany, after Soviet intelligence fomented false notions that the building was part of a Central Intelligence Agency plot to turn Germany into a nuclear-capable country. He describes a failed attempt by the Soviet intelligence services to make Dan Rather, then a newsman with CBS News, appear guilty with killing citizens in Afghanistan.\n\nThe book was first published in 1983 by Pergamon-Brassey's and another edition was released in 1985 by the same publisher, with a foreword by Roy Godson. A Spanish language edition was released in 1987 by Editorial Juventud.\n\nSeth Arenstein analyzed the book for \"SAIS Review\" and wrote that \"Bittman's treatment of disinformation, particularly his meticulous research, makes \"The KGB and Soviet Disinformation\" fascinating reading\". John C. Campbell reviewed the book for the journal \"Foreign Affairs\" and gave a mixed review, \"Going well beyond the author's personal experience–he left Czechoslovakia in 1968–the book ranges over the entire field ... with many illustrative cases and items of interest, but also with a tendency to write the KGB's role as larger than life\".\n\n\"The KGB and Soviet Disinformation\" received both a negative and a positive review in the \"International Journal of Intelligence and CounterIntelligence\", with Phillips writing \"Chez Espionage regulars consider\" the book \"an excellent study\", referring to its author as \"the top authority on disinformation in the U.S.\". The other reviewer, Peter C. Unsinger, wrote \"At times his examination is superficial, and for depth into some specific events, the reader will have to look at Bittman's earlier work\". The book was reviewed by Cesare Marongiu Buonaiuti in the Italian language journal \"Rivista di Studi Politici Internazionali\".\n\n\n\n"}

Kant divided transcendental theology into \"ontotheology\" and \"cosmotheology\", both of which he also invented, \"in order to distinguish between two competing types of 'transcendental theology'\".\n\nKant defined the relationship between ontotheology and cosmostheology as follows: \n\n\"Transcendental theology aims either at inferring the existence of a Supreme Being from a general experience, without any closer reference to the world to which this experience belongs, and in this case it is called cosmotheology; or it endeavours to cognize the existence of such a being, through mere conceptions, without the aid of experience, and is then termed ontotheology.\"\nThe problem of transcendental theology as developed by Kant is that human reason is not capable of proving God's existence. Kant solves this problem by appealing to moral symbolism. Thus, Kant describes God as a moral trinity: holy lawgiver, good governor, and just judge.\n"}

Konečni (born October 27, 1944) is an American and Serbian psychologist, aesthetician, poet, dramatist, fiction writer, and art photographer, currently an Emeritus Professor of Psychology at the University of California, San Diego. \n\nIn psychology, he has carried out influential work in several distinct areas, related to each other by strong methodological concerns. Konečni has conducted laboratory and field studies of human emotion and (physical and verbal) aggression, as well as of altruistic behavior, which have been cited in numerous social psychology textbooks.\n\nDecision-making has been another major research area in which Konečni has been heavily involved (in close collaboration with Dr. Ebbe B. Ebbesen, a long-time colleague at the University of California, San Diego). Most of their work has been devoted to judicial decisions in the criminal justice system, but they have also conducted a number of frequently cited studies of drivers’ decisions in real-world settings. \n\nFinally, Konečni has for some forty years worked in the multi-faceted interdisciplinary domains of empirical aesthetics, psychology of art, and music psychology. Notable groups of his studies in these areas have addressed the highly specialized and technical problems of the “golden ratio” (or “golden section”) in visual art, the significance of macrostructure in music, peak aesthetic responses, and the relationship between music and emotion.\n\nVladimir Konečni grew up in Belgrade (then the capital of Yugoslavia, now of Serbia). His parents were Dora D. Konečni (née Vasić), an economist and banker, and Josip J. Konečni, M.D., a Professor of Medicine at the University of Belgrade.\n\nKonečni is of Serbian, Czech, and Austrian descent.\n\nKonečni is married and has two sons. He lives in San Diego (California, USA), Amsterdam (Netherlands), Tallinn (Estonia), and Belgrade (Serbia).\n\nKonečni received his Bachelor of Arts degree in experimental and clinical psychology, and philosophy, from the University of Belgrade in 1969; as an undergraduate, he published three refereed articles. \n\nIn 1970, he began graduate studies in experimental and social psychology at the University of Toronto, Canada, receiving an M.A. degree in 1971 and a Ph.D. in 1973. The title of his dissertation was “Experimental Studies of Human Aggression: The Cathartic Effect.” Also in 1973, Konečni was appointed Assistant Professor and thus began his 35-year-long uninterrupted association with the Department of Psychology at the University of California, San Diego (Associate Professor in 1978; Professor in 1982; Emeritus Professor in 2008).\n\nIn the period after 1973, he was at various times a Visiting Professor at a number of renowned universities outside the United States, including the London School of Economics, Sydney University, Hebrew University Jerusalem, University of Cape Town, Universiteit van Amsterdam, and Freie Universität Berlin. In the course of his career so far, Konečni has given colloquia on his research at some 150 universities on all continents.\n\nIn the period 1972-1984, Konečni carried out, in parallel, field experiments on altruistic behavior, and laboratory and field studies on human physical and verbal aggression. \n\nWith regard to aggression, on the basis of experimental findings, Konečni distinguished among physical, verbal, play, fantasy and other types of aggression, and proposed the existence of bidirectional causation (behavioral and psychophysiological) between the degree of anger (high arousal antagonistically labeled) and the amount of expressed physical aggression. \n\nThis theoretical model, which emphasized previously unacknowledged feedback loops, seems to resolve the classical issue of “catharsis.” By means of definitional clarity and experimental precision, the model shifts the debate to the many implications of the theoretically sound and empirically observable “cathartic effect,” replacing unfocused appeals to sources as diverse as Aristotle’s \"Poetics\", Kleinian play therapy, and Albert Bandura’s social learning theory. This Anger-Aggression Bidirectional-Causation (AABC) theoretical model parsimoniously accounts for hundreds of experimental findings in the literature. These ideas have also been applied to the role of aversive events in the development of intergroup conflict. Subsequently, Konečni's writing on aggression was extended to the concept of revenge and the expression of anger and violence on the stage.\n\nFrom 1973 to 2011 (the year of Emeritus Professor Ebbe B. Ebbesen’s passing), Ebbesen and Konečni worked on judicial decision-making in the criminal justice system. Using quantitative methods, they studied how various participants in the system – judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys, police officers, perpetrators, and others – combine the information available to them into decisions that then become information items for other decision-makers in the system. \n\nThis work has been very influential and has been described as “arduous” and “pioneering.” \n\nOne of its major features has been the comparison of data from experimental simulations to those obtained from archival records and court hearings, often involving the same participants or the same classes of participants (even Superior Court judges participated in the simulations). After their much-cited first article, in 1975, comparing judges’ bail-setting decisions in a simulation to those they made in the courtroom, Ebbesen and Konečni published a number of critical methodological articles on the key issue of \"external validity\" at many points in the existing research on the legal process, with special reference to jury simulations. This led both to resistance and critiques of the resistance. \n\nIn 1982, Konečni and Ebbesen edited a book (dedicated to Egon Brunswik and Kurt Lewin), \"The Criminal Justice System: A Social-Psychological Analysis\", to which they contributed five chapters that outlined their theoretical and methodological viewpoint and addressed several major empirical issues. \n\nOne of the chapters presented the results of a large project (over one thousand cases) on judicial sentencing for felonies in California; among other findings, it included a causal analysis that eliminated several popular views of sentencing and highlighted the decisive role of probation officers. \n\nKonečni and Ebbesen, with several students, also conducted empirical investigations of “mentally disordered sex offenders,” child-custody decisions, and other issues of societal importance. \n\nThey also published extensive critiques of what they believed were mistaken, yet entrenched, views on another major issue in legal psychology, namely, the probative value of prior eyewitness memory research in general, and, specifically, the probative value of psychologists’ testimony on eyewitness issues in the cases of exonerations by DNA evidence. \n\nFinally, while working in Konečni’s laboratory, G. Kette, an Austrian psychologist, coauthored two articles with Konečni on communication channels and the decoding and integration of cues in judicial decision-making.\n\nThroughout his career, Vladimir Konečni has conducted numerous experiments in diverse areas of empirical aesthetics – a field dominated by scientifically oriented psychologists and thus often referred to as psychological or (psycho-) aesthetics (distinct from “aesthetics,” which usually refers to philosophical aesthetics). In his first article (1976) in psycho-aesthetics, Konečni, influenced by Daniel Berlyne (one of his graduate-school mentors), successfully combined work on physiological arousal with his own prior work on the “cathartic effect” to study music preference (as a dependent variable). A broad and innovative empirical approach to the study of emotional, mood, and personality antecedents of aesthetic preference and choice in both visual art and music resulted in a number of publications with several American and European graduate students and in various languages. Konečni also wrote two widely cited theoretical articles that addressed (a) the social, emotional, and cognitive determinants of aesthetic preference and (b) the measurable psychological consequences of exposure to aesthetic stimuli, resulting in his formulation of the “Model of Aesthetic Episode” (MAE), which he continued to refine over many years.\n\nVarious problems in the area of visual art have been frequently and to this day investigated by Konečni. There have been articles, inspired by MAE, on the interactive effects of visual art and music on emotion and mood, culminating recently (2010, 2015) in two theoretical articles. In addition, he is one of very few psychoaestheticians who has been able to study the creative process \"in vivo\" – in his experimental study of portraiture. Konečni has also written about the politics and social ecology of architecture – specifically in Stalin’s Soviet Union and Hitler’s Germany – and he has recently addressed the aesthetic and social issues regarding new museums in China.\n\nFor about ten years (1995-2005), Konečni did a great deal of experimental and theoretical work on the “golden ratio” (or “golden section”). He has repeatedly emphasized the need for distinguishing among the numerous facets of this classical problem in aesthetics and art: Objects in nature vs. objects in art and architecture; the known presence vs. absence of artist’s intention in utilizing the ratio; the degree of perceivers’ awareness of the ratio in an object and the influence of that awareness, if any, on the object’s aesthetic appeal. In his work on paintings, Konečni used many different measures, including the dimensions of the rectangle (frame); the vertical and horizontal bisections of a painting; and the dimensions of significant depicted objects within the painting. He considered the analysis of this variety of measures indispensable and developed several methodological innovations, as well as refinements of the classical Fechnerian ones. Konečni has described the golden ratio as “elusive but detectable,” and more likely to influence the results of carefully conducted experiments as part of higher-order interactions than as a main effect; its “contextuality and configurality” make it, he has suggested, comparable to concepts in Zen aesthetics.\n\nThis new, 21st century, area of research has been considered a branch of empirical aesthetics. Konečni has described its main characteristics, and has critically analyzed some of the claims made by several prominent practitioners, arguing that these claims are exaggerated.\n\nKonečni has been heavily involved in many aspects of music psychology. In addition to the experimental and theoretical articles on the effects of a variety of factors (including high arousal and other forms of stress) on music preference and choice (for example, among melodies differing in complexity), he developed a new methodology to investigate the theoretically interesting question of “hedonic effects of development vs. chance in resolved and unresolved aural episodes.” Furthermore, he contributed to topics of interest to musicians, such as a two-part article that presented a psychological analysis of J. S. Bach’s \"St. Matthew Passion\", and another on mode and tempo in Western classical music of the common-practice era. In addition, Konečni wrote about the (Latin) \"Requiem\" by the Russian composer Vyacheslav Artyomov and about the playing style of the Canadian pianist Glenn Gould. There are also his three contributions to \"Music in the Social and Behavioral Sciences: An Encyclopedia\" by SAGE and a highly technical review of Steven Jan’s book \"The Memetics of Music: A Neo-Darwinian View of Musical Structure and Culture\".\n\nIn 1984, Konečni published an article with five experiments on the “elusive effects of artists’ ‘messages,’” in which “messages” were defined broadly to include, in the two experiments devoted to music, the macrostructure of the pieces, such as the original ordering of the movements in Beethoven’s piano sonatas and string quartets. Surprisingly, and contrary to strongly held musicological conventions, even drastic reordering of the movements produced negligible decrements in listeners’ enjoyment. Follow-up experiments produced analogous results; a variety of highly esteemed and diverse music pieces were used as research stimuli in this work, including J. S. Bach’s \"Goldberg Variations\" (diverse ordering of the variations) and Mozart’s \"Symphony in G-Minor\", K. 550 (reordering of the key structural parts of the first movement). These and related experiments were further discussed by Konečni and Karno in 1994, at which time they also summarized the previous debate with musicologists Robert Batt and Nicholas Cook about this research.\n\nKonečni has been very active in this area since about 2002. There have been reports of laboratory experiments, extensive theoretical articles in psychology and philosophy journals, and detailed reviews of important books in music-psychology and philosophical-aesthetics journals. Konečni has taken a strong and elaborate – albeit minority – stance against what he regards is an avalanche of insufficiently substantiated claims regarding the relationship between music and emotion, and specifically against the thesis that music \"causes\" emotion. In a recent book review, he wrote: “The authors never clearly state something very simple and almost certainly true: \"some\" music \"may\", \"sometimes\", in \"some\" people, under \"some\" circumstances, elicit \"some\" psychobiological emotions, but never nearly as powerful as the correspondent emotions in social life.” Konečni has based this view on a careful examination of the literature in both music psychology and philosophical aesthetics; on the Prototypical Emotion-Episode Model (PEEM, which he had developed over many years); on his own experimental findings and theoretical work regarding music and emotion; and on what he perceives as widespread neglect of definitional precision and sound methodology in this multidisciplinary field, including in numerous highly cited research articles.\n\nKonečni has written that there is ample evidence to view the majority position about the relationship between music and emotion as an aspect of the socio-culturally prevalent “emotivism,” which he distinguished from emotivism in ethics, and defined as “the propensity for excessive insertion of emotion and ‘feeling’ into both lay and scientific theories of mental life, motives, needs, and daily behavior, in matters artistic and non-artistic.” He has suggested that the proclivity for emotional and quasi-emotional excess is related to the prevalent anti-narrative social climate, which often ignores evidence and reason.\n\nKonečni recently published a theoretical article on emotion in the domain of painting and art installations and discussed emotivism in this context also.\n\nThis issue is one in which philosophical aesthetics and psycho-aesthetics are intertwined – in general and in Konečni’s extensive work in the past decade. In 2005, he published a theoretical article outlining his “aesthetic trinity theory” (ATT), in which “trinity” refers to a tripartite hierarchical organization of peak aesthetic responses consisting of: (a) physiological thrills (or chills), the most frequent and transient response, and the least pronounced, yet the object of most experimental work; (b) the state of “being moved,” considered to be intermediate in depth and duration (the linguistic representation and conceptual structure of this state have recently been empirically investigated by Kuehnast et al., 2014); and (c) aesthetic awe, conceptualized as the peak aesthetic response, exceedingly rare and memorable, and similar to the fundamental emotions in terms of physiological fluctuation, but, unlike them, characterized by existential safety, controllability of danger, and the ease with which it can be “switched off.” In ATT, aesthetic awe is viewed as the prototypical response to the “sublime stimulus-in-context” that is external to the perceiver (unlike some positions in philosophy), defined independently of aesthetic awe, and characterized by physical grandeur, great rarity, extraordinary beauty, and novelty, among other criteria). Many aspects of ATT are testable and the results would speak to both philosophical and psychological aestheticians.\n\nVladimir Konečni has for a long time been a prolific poet, dramatist, short-story writer, and art photographer. He has published literary works in English, French, and Serbian. His plays have been performed in a number of countries in North America and Europe, under his direction on two occasions. In addition, he participated in many group art-photography shows in California, and had solo exhibitions in U.S.A. and Serbia. Konečni’s work in all of these areas can be accessed gratis at his website.\n\n"}

The WPM promotes naturalistic pantheism\n\nThe WPM grew out of a mailing list started by Paul Harrison in 1997, arising around his Scientific Pantheism website. An initial group of 15 volunteers worked on a joint statement of agreed beliefs (the Pantheist Credo). The WPM officially opened for membership in December 1999.\n\nThe official views of the World Pantheist Movement are listed in the nine points of the Belief Statement (see external links).\nThese are summarized as follows:\n\nThe specific Statement is as follows:\n\n\nThe WPM encourages wonder and awe at the beauty and mystery of the Universe and fosters the full range of positive emotional responses to life. It promotes ethical principles such as respect for the rights of humans and other living creatures, non-discrimination, justice and peace.\n\nIt respects the scientific method as humanity's most accurate approach for deepening its understanding of nature, while accepting that science is a never-ending quest and that some technologies have created massive social and environmental problems. It accepts that there are some questions that science may never answer - such as why anything exists, rather than nothing at all. It does not give any credence to ideas such as a separate soul distinct from the body, or of the consciousness' survival after death, but believes that people achieve a form of immortality through the ongoing effects of their actions, the things they create, others' memories, the legacy of their genes, and the recycling of their elements in nature.\n\nIt does not prescribe any particular set of religious practices, instead leaving the matter up to individuals. Pantheistic activity is viewed not as a ritual that must be upheld in order to placate gods and spirits, or to follow rules prescribed in scripture, but rather as an individual expression of one's deep feelings towards Nature and the wider Universe. Among members and friends of the WPM, the most common practices are meditation and close, daily observation of nature. Both of these are sometimes accompanied by the use of natural objects such as pebbles, shells, bark etc. About a quarter of WPM members report using some form of pagan celebration, but this is done for self-expression and fun, rather than out of literal belief in pagan theologies.\n\nMembers and friends may meet in small groups, the format of which varies. Groups may discuss general ideas; watch and discuss relevant (often nature-related) books, or films; share personal experiences; go on nature outings; or participate in nature conservation projects or other forms of community service.\n\nViewing the recycling of human elements in soil, water, and the atmosphere as a major element of human \"immortality,\" the WPM supports the \"natural death\" approach. In this context, it seeks to return the elements to the natural cycle in the fastest and most responsible way possible, such as burial in a biodegradable container in nature-reserve type grounds.\n\nThe WPM is governed by a board of 13 directors. Its main forms of activity consist of:\n\nThe World Pantheist Movement symbol is the spiral as seen in the curves of the nautilus shell, or in the spiral arms of a galaxy, showing the link between the cosmic physical (thousands of light years) and the biological. Sometimes the Nautilus spiral alone is used; it embodies the Fibonacci series and the golden ratio.\n\nThe WPM has a policy of accepting a diversity of language and methods of celebration among its members, although - following large surveys of its website visitors' preferences - it generally avoids overtly theistic or religious language in its official literature. Some members view themselves as atheists, while others hold agnostic stances. Some members use theistic vocabulary, however they do not believe in a thinking creator god, and simply use the word \"God\" to describe their feelings of reverence towards Nature and the wider Universe. Some members, while accepting the basic naturalistic beliefs of the WPM, like to combine these with symbols and ceremonies from other traditions, most commonly paganism, philosophical Taoism, and Buddhism.\n\nThe WPM does not interfere with or promote any specific personal choices regarding sexuality or the use of recreational or psychotropic drugs. Similarly, members have a diversity of views on vegetarianism, hunting, non-violence, and many other political, social, and technological issues. All these issues are left to members' understanding of Naturalistic Pantheistic morality and the Belief Statement.\n\nPaul Harrison, the World Pantheist Movement founder, was vice president of the Universal Pantheist Society (UPS) in the mid-1990s, but resigned after becoming skeptical of the possibility of promoting \"generic\" pantheism given the very wide variety of beliefs held by different types of pantheist (specifically, by those with naturalistic beliefs and those with dualist or idealist beliefs). The WPM has since gained a membership considerably larger than the UPS, along with a wider circle of non-members who participate in its online forum and Facebook pages.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11007023", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11007023", "title": "Yamato-damashii", "text": "Yamato-damashii\n\nFor this national type of moral character was invented the name \"Yamato-damashi\" (or \"Yamato-gokoro\"), — the Soul of Yamato (or Heart of Yamato), — the appellation of the old province of Yamato, seat of the early emperors, being figuratively used for the entire country. We might correctly, though less literally, interpret the expression \"Yamato-damashi\" as \"The Soul of Old Japan\". (1904:177)\n\nOriginally \"Yamato-damashi\" did not bear the bellicose weight or ideological timbre that it later assumed in pre-war modern Japan. It first occurs in the section of \"The Tale of Genji\" (Chapter 21), as a native virtue that flourishes best, not as a contrast to foreign civilization but, rather precisely, when it is grounded on a solid basis in Chinese learning. Thus we read:\n\nNo, the safe thing is to give him a good, solid fund of knowledge. It is when there is a fund of Chinese learning (\"zae\" 才) that the Japanese spirit (\"yamato-damashii\" 大和魂) is respected in the world. (Murasaki Shikibu, \"The Tale of Genji\" tr. Edward Seidensticker, 1976, 1:362) \n\n\"Yamato-damashii\" \"Japan, Japanese\" compounds \"Yamato\" (, \"great harmony\") with \"damashii\", which is the voiced \"rendaku\" pronunciation of \"tamashii\" ( \"spirit; soul\"). Both these \"kanji\" (Chinese characters used in Japan) readings \"Yamato\" (大和) and \"damashii\" (魂) are native Japanese \"kun'yomi\", while the \"Wakon\" (和魂 \"Japanese spirit\") reading is Sinitic \"on'yomi\" borrowed from Chinese \"Héhún\" (和魂).\n\n\"Yamato\" is historically the second of three common Japanese endonyms (or autonyms) for 'Japan; Japanese'.\nIn current Japanese usage, \"Wa\" 倭 is an archaic variant Chinese character for \"Wa\" 和, \"Yamato\" is a literary and historical term, and \"Nihon\" is the usual name for \"Japan; Japanese\".\n\n\"Tamashii\" or \"tama\" (魂 \"soul; spirit; ghost\" or 霊 \"spirit; soul\") is Japanese \"kun'yomi\", while \"kon\" or \"gon\" is Chinese \"on'yomi\" (from \"hún\" 魂). The Shinto-influenced semantics of Japanese \"tama\"/\"tamashii\" exceed customary English concepts of \"spirit\", \"soul\", or \"ghost\", besides the human soul, it also includes diverse spiritual forces found in nature. Roy Andrew Miller suggests that German \"Geist\" or French \"\" are better translations than English \"spirit\" or \"soul\":\nBut finally we must conclude that nothing in any commonly used European language, including English, really does justice to Japanese \"tama\". The spirit, soul, \"Geist\", or \"élan\" to which the Japanese term has reference, whether it is the \"tama\" of \"Yamato-damashii\" or the \"tama\" of \"kotodama\", is a vital and active entity that plays no part in any usual Western-language imagery or expression. We have no such word, and we make use of no imagery capitalizing upon the concepts that it employs; but the Japanese have, and they do. (1982:131) \n\n\"Kotodama\" (, \"word spirit\", approximately \"magic word\") illustrate this traditional Japanese belief about \"tama(shii)\" energies. \"Kenkyūsha's New Japanese-English Dictionary\" (5th ed., 2003) gives \"kotodama\" translation equivalents and a revealing usage example: \", the soul [spirit] of language; the miraculous power of language [a phrase, a spell]. ̍ ⇨ Japan, \"the land where the mysterious workings of language bring bliss\".\"\n\n\"Yamato nadeshiko\" (, \"Japanese fringed pink\") is a floral metaphor for \"the idealized traditional Japanese woman\". During World War II, ultra-nationalists popularized \"Yamato-nadeshiko\" as the female manifestation of \"Yamato-damashii\".\n\nThe record of \"Yamato-damashii\" dates back one millennium to the Heian period (794–1185) of Japanese history, when Chinese culture and Chinese language were highly influential.\n\n\"Yamato-gokoro\" (大和心 \"Japanese heart; Japanese mind\" is the closest synonym of \"Yamato-damashii\". The Heian poet Akazome Emon first used \"Yamato-gokoro\" in her \"Goshūi Wakashū\" (後拾遺和歌集 \"Later Collection of Waka Gleanings,\" 1086).\n\nSince \"Wa\" 和 commonly abbreviates \"Yamato\" 大和 \"Japan; Japanese\", 和魂 (also read \"Wakon\") is a contraction of \"Yamato-damashii\". The \"Konjaku Monogatarishū\" (circa 1120) first uses it describing a burglar who murdered a nattering scholar of Chinese classical law. \"Although Kiyohara no Yoshizumi (清原善澄) had admirable learning, he is said to have died in this childish way because he did not have the slightest knowledge of the Japanese spirit\" (tr. Carr 1994:283).\n\nFor centuries after its use by Heian authors \"Yamato-damashii\" was rarely recorded until the late Edo period (1600–1868). One Kamakura-period exception is the \"Gukanshō\" history (ca. 1220), which uses \"Yamato-damashii\" (和魂) in praising the character of child Emperor Toba (r. 1107–1123).\n\nThree new \"Japanese spirit\" phrases originated around the 1867 Meiji Restoration. First, the modernization was fashioned by Kyokutei Bakin, a famous samurai author of \"Gesaku\". His \"Chinsetsu Yumiharizuki\" (\"The Crescent Moon\", 1811) quotes Minamoto no Tametomo discussing \"seppuku\" rituals: \"I admit that a person who does not care about dying when on the verge of death may superficially have the Japanese spirit, but I think this is a misunderstanding from not having learned about it.\" (tr. Carr 1994:284). Second, \"Wakon-kansai\" (和魂漢才 \"Japanese spirit and Chinese scholarship\") occurs in the \"Kanke ikai\" (菅家遺戒 \"Sugawara's dying instructions\"). Third, \"Wakon-yōsai\" (和魂洋才 \"Japanese spirit and Western techniques\") was created by Yoshikawa Tadayasu (吉川忠安) in his \"Kaika sakuron\" (開化策論 , \"Questions and Themes on Progress\", 1867).\n\nFollowing the Japanese victories in the First Sino-Japanese War and Russo-Japanese War, nationalists made \"Wakon-yōsai\" into a catchphrase for modernization and militarization, and developed \"Yamato-damashii\" into what Miller (1982:13) calls \"the official rallying cry for the Japanese armed forces in World War II.\"\n\nIn the present day, \"Yamato-damashii\" is historically associated with Japanese nationalism, but is commonly used in \"Nihonjinron\" discussions and sports media. It is the motto for the international Purebred mixed martial arts school headed by Japanese-American Enson Inoue. Professor David Pollack predicts that \"Yamato-damashii\" will become extinct.\nSynthesis comes to an end only when antithesis ceases to appear. For many centuries Japan found its most significant antithesis in China. During the last century and a half the West has been the antithetical term in the dialectic, and as always it has been in that \"other\" that Japan has sought its own image, peering anxiously for signs of its own identity into the mirror of the rest of the world. After the challenge of Western technology has been successfully met, one wonders what will be left that is \"alien,\" besides the very fact that the historically necessary \"other\" is lacking. In that case, \"Japanese spirit\" (Yamato-damashii) will find itself face to face with the most frightening \"other\" of all – its lack – at which point opposition must cease or else feed upon itself. (1986:52-3) \n\nRacially and ethnically offensive words are problematic for dictionaries. Lexicographers and publishers have editorial policies for treating ethnic slurs and insults. For example, The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language (4th ed., 2000) defines \"Jap\" as \"\"Offensive Slang\". Used as a disparaging term for a person of Japanese birth or descent.\"\n\nMichael Carr argues that \"Yamato-damashii\" (1994:280-1) \"significantly differs from everyday racist slurs because it is not an overt insult, it is the opposite: an ethnic adulation. It belongs to a special category of benedictions such as \"Manifest Destiny\" or \"Chosen People\" that imply national, racial, or ethnic self-conceit.\" The nationalist and racist connotations of Japanese \"Yamato-damashii\" are comparable with German \"Herrenvolk\" (\"Master race\").\n\nCarr lexicographically analyzed \"Yamato-damashii\" definitions among modern general-purpose Japanese dictionaries from four publishers, namely, \"Daijisen\" (Shōgakukan, 1986), \"Daijirin\" (Sanseidō, 1988), \"Nihongo Daijiten\" (Kōdansha, 1989), and \"Kōjien\" (Iwanami, 1991).\n\nFor instance, this definition from the popular \"Daijirin\" dictionary gives the \"kanji\" 大和魂, modern and Old Japanese pronunciations, two meanings, synonyms, and usage examples from Japanese literature.\nやまとだましい［―だましひ］4 【《大和》魂】①大和心。和魂。（漢学を学んで得た知識に対して）日本人固有の実務・世事などを処理する能力・知恵をいう。「才(ざえ)を本としてこそ、―の世に用ゐらるる方も強う侍らめ〔出典： 源氏（乙女）〕」 「露、―無かりける者にて〔出典： 今昔 二十〕」②( 近世以降の国粋思想の中で用いられた語)日本民族固有の精神。日本人としての意識。<br>\nyamato ... -damashii, \"-damashiFi\" \"type 4\" [accent on \"da\"] 【《大和》魂】1. \"yamato-gokoro\". \"wakon\". (in contrast to knowledge obtained from studying Chinese classics) Japanese people's characteristic ability or wisdom/intelligence for managing/treating actual things and worldly affairs. \"The Tale of Genji\" (The Maiden [chapter]) \"Without a solid foundation of book-learning this 'Japanese spirit' of which one hears so much is not of any great use in the world.\" [Tales of] Times Now Past (20) \"He did not have the slightest knowledge of the Japanese spirit.\" 2. (term used in ultra-nationalistic ideology of recent times) characteristic mentality of the Japanese race/people. Consciousness/awareness of being a Japanese person. (tr. Carr 1994:288)\n\nCollectively, these four definitions provide insights into what \"Yamato-damashii\" means in current Japanese usage. They all distinguish two basic meanings: ① \"A Japanese practical ability; opposed to Chinese scholarship\" and ② \"A traditional (bushido/nationalistic) concept of death-defying valor\". When two or more definitions use identical terminology, it suggests consensus on semantics. For instance, while the dictionaries split on whether meaning ① refers to \"Nihon-minzoku\" (日本民族 \"Japanese race/people/nation\") or \"Nihon-jin\" (日本人 \"Japanese person/people\"), all four say the nationalistic meaning ② refers to \"Nihon-minzoku\".\n\nFor meaning ①, the most salient word (used 7 times) is \"koyū\" (固有 \"inherent; innate; characteristic; special quality\"). This sense is defined as a \"noryoku\" (能力 \"ability, capability; competency\") or \"chie\" (知恵 \"wisdom; insight; intelligence\"), which pertains to \"jisseikatsujōno\" (実生活上 \"real life; everyday/practical reality') or \"jitsumutekina\" (実務的な \"actual things, practical experience\").\n\nFor meaning ②, all the definitions describe a \"seishin\" (精神 \"mind; mentality; spirit; soul; genius\"). Specifically a \"Japanese spirit\" with \"kakan\" (果敢 \"boldness; courage; daring; determination\"), \"yūmō\" (勇猛 \"bravery; valor; intrepidness; daring\"), and \"shinmei o mo oshimanai\" (身命をも惜しまない \"without regard for one's life\"), especially when \"koto ni atatte\" (事に当たって \"facing a vital matter; in case of crisis\"). Purity is mentioned with \"seijo\" (清浄 \"purity; cleanliness\") and \"isagiyoi\" (潔い \"pure; clean; honorable; gallant; brave\").\n\nWithin this dictionary sample, only the \"Nihongo daijiten\" qualifies \"Yamato-damashii\" as a characteristic that is \"to sareta\" (とされた \"assumed, supposed; alleged'\"), whereas the other three define it as a matter of fact. Carr concludes (1994:290), \"Believing that all individuals of any race or nationality share certain \"spiritual\" characteristics is at best overgeneralization, or at worst racism.\"\n\nSome monolingual English dictionaries enter \"Yamato\" or \"Yamato-e\", but only the Oxford English Dictionary enters \"Yamato-damashii\".\nYamato (ja'mato) [Jap., = 'Japan']<br>\n1. The style or school of art in Japan which culminated in the 12th and 13th centuries and dealt with Japanese subjects in a distinctively Japanese (rather than Chinese) way. Usu. as Yamato-e (†-we) [\"e\" picture]; also –ryū [-\"ryū\" style, orig. stream, school]. … <br>\n2. Yamato-damashii: the Japanese spirit. … (v. 3, 2002) \nThe \"OED\" gives three usage examples, starting with \"Yamato-damashi\" (1942, \"Royal Air Force Journal\", \"He will be filled with what is called \"yamato damashi\" [sic] or the pure spirit of Japan.\") and \"Yamato-damashii\" (1957, \"Encyclopædia Britannica\"). Note that the 1904 Hearn quotation above antedates this 1942 citation.\n\nMost Japanese-English dictionaries literally translate \"Yamato-damashii\" as \"the Japanese spirit\". For instance, Kenkyūsha's New Japanese-English Dictionary (5th ed., 2003) enters \"Yamato\" \"やまと【大和】 Yamato; (old) Japan\" along with 14 subentries, including \"Yamato-damashii\" \"大和魂 the Japanese spirit\" and \"Yamato-gokoro\" \"大和心 the Japanese spirit; the Japanese sensibility.\"\n\nThe online \"Encyclopedia of Shinto\" (linked below, note the pronunciation file) comprehensively defines Yamato-damashii.\nLiterally, \"Japanese spirit\"; \"Yamato damashii\" is also written 大和魂. This term is often contrasted with \"Chinese Learning\" (\"karasae\"), that is, knowledge and scholarship imported into Japan from China. \"Yamato damashii\" refers to an inherent faculty of common-sense wisdom, resourcefulness, and prudent judgment that is characteristic of, and unique to, the Japanese people. It also refers to a practical, \"real life\" ability and intelligence that is in contrast with scholarship and knowledge acquired through formal education. It is a term used to express such ideas as the essential purity and resolute spirit of the Japanese people, the wish for the peace and security of the nation, and the possession of a strong spirit and emotion that will meet any challenge, even at the expense of one's own life. \"Yamato damashii\" is synonymous with \"Yamato gokoro\" (lit. \"Japanese heart\"). \n\n\n"}
