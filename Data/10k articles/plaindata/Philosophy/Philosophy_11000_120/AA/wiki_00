The oil is usually pre-mixed with herbs for specific conditions.\n\nThe Abhyanga is a part of the Dinacharya (daily practices) specified by the Brhat Trayi and Laghutrayi series of Ayurvedic textbooks to maintain good health and well-being. Proponents claim Abhyanga aids joint health, nourishes the dhatus (tissues of the body) and brings aggravated doshas back to balance. They further claim it improves the condition of dry, coarse hair and flaky skin.\n\nAbhyanga can be done as part of the steps of panchakarma therapy, especially in the first stage: Purva Karma (pre-treatment), or as its own therapy. \n\nIt is often followed by svedana therapy or a warm bath. Abhyanga may be performed by one or more therapists working in sync, but it can also be done by oneself. Oils used can vary depending on the season and the individuals out of balance constitution Vkrtti.\n\nThe Abhyanga as prescribed in the Brhtatrayi and Laghutrayi texts is vigorous, and intended to open up the minor Sortas, remove ama (toxins) through the skin, melt kleshma (fat secretions blocking the srotas), and cleanse and moisturize the skin. But Abhyanga can also be used to soothe a Vata imbalance which will bring deep relaxation to the body and a peaceful mind.\n\n\n3. How a pada abhyanga can help control vata dosha \n4.

Amo was a teacher at the universities of Halle and Jena in Germany after studying there. Brought to Germany by the Dutch West India Company in 1707 as a child, and given as a gift to the Dukes of August Wilhelm and Ludwig Rudolf von Wolfenbüttel, he was treated as a member of the family of Anthony Ulrich, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, he was the first African known to have attended a European university.\n\nAmo was a Nzema (an Akan people). He was born in Awukena in the Axim region of present-day Ghana, but at the age of about four he was taken to Amsterdam by the Dutch West India Company. Some accounts say that he was taken as a slave, others that he was sent to Amsterdam by a preacher working in Ghana. The truth of the matter is that he was given as a \"present\" to Anthony Ulrich, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, to whose palace in Wolfenbüttel he was taken.\nAmo was baptised (and later confirmed) in the palace's chapel. He was treated as a member of the Duke's family, and was educated at the Wolfenbüttel Ritter-Akademie (1717–21) and at the University of Helmstedt (1721–27).\n\nHe went on to the University of Halle, whose Law School he entered in 1727. He finished his preliminary studies within two years, titling his thesis: \"Dissertatio Inauguralis De Jure Maurorum in Europa\" (1729). This manuscript on \"The Rights of Moors in Europe\" is lost, but a summary was published in his university's \"Annals\" (1730). For his further studies Amo moved to the University of Wittenberg, studying logic, metaphysics, physiology, astronomy, history, law, theology, politics, and medicine, and mastered six languages (English, French, Dutch, Latin, Greek, and German). His medical education in particular was to play a central role in much of his later philosophical thought.\n\nHe gained his doctorate in philosophy at Wittenberg in 1734; his thesis (published as \"On the Absence of Sensation in the Human Mind and its Presence in our Organic and Living Body\") argued against Cartesian dualism in favour of a broadly materialist account of the person. He accepted that it is correct to talk of a mind or soul, but argued that it is the body rather than the mind which perceives and feels.\n\nWhatever feels, lives; whatever lives, depends on nourishment; whatever lives and depends on nourishment grows; whatever is of this nature is in the end resolved into its basic principles; whatever comes to be resolved into its basic principles is a complex; every complex has its constituent parts; whatever this is true of is a divisible body. If therefore the human mind feels, it follows that it is a divisible body.\n\nAmo returned to the University of Halle to lecture in philosophy under his preferred name of Antonius Guilelmus Amo Afer. In 1736 he was made a professor. From his lectures, he produced his second major work in 1738, \"Treatise on the Art of Philosophising Soberly and Accurately\", in which he developed an empiricist epistemology very close to but distinct from that of philosophers such as John Locke and David Hume. In it he also examined and criticised faults such as intellectual dishonesty, dogmatism, and prejudice.\n\nIn 1740 Amo took up a post in philosophy at the University of Jena, but while there he experienced a number of changes for the worse. The Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel had died in 1735, leaving him without his long-standing patron and protector. That coincided with social changes in Germany, which was becoming intellectually and morally narrower and less liberal. Those who argued against the secularisation of education (and against the rights of Africans in Europe) were regaining their ascendancy over those (such as Christian Wolff) who campaigned for greater academic and social freedom.\n\nAmo was subjected to an unpleasant campaign by some of his enemies, including a public lampoon staged at a theatre in Halle. He finally decided to return to the land of his birth. He set sail on a Dutch West India Company ship to Ghana via Guinea, arriving in about 1747; his father and a sister were still living there. His life from then on becomes more obscure. According to at least one report, he was taken to a Dutch fortress, Fort San Sebastian in Shama, in the 1750s, possibly to prevent him sowing dissent among his people. The exact date, place, and manner of his death are unknown, though he probably died in about 1759 at the fort in Chama in Ghana.\n\nLater, during the time of German idealism and romanticism, Amo's philosophical work was ignored by other Jena-based German intellectuals such as Schiller, Fichte, Schelling, Hegel, Brentano, or the Schlegel brothers.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was known by Irish speakers at Louvain by the honorary name \"Aodh Mac Aingil\" (\"Mac Aingil\" is Irish for \"Son of an Angel\"), and it was under this title that he published the Irish work \"Scáthán Shacramuinte na hAthridhe\".\n\nMac Cathmhaoil was born at Saul, County Down, and received his earliest education in his native place, trained at one of the bardic schools still operating in Ulster. He next studied at a famous school in the Isle of Man. On his return to Ireland, he was hired by Hugh O'Neill, The O'Neill, 2nd Earl of Tyrone, as a tutor to his sons Henry and Hugh.\n\nMac Cathmhaoil was sent by the Earl as special messenger to the Court of Spain to solicit aid for the Ulster forces. During his stay at Salamanca, where the Court then resided, he frequented the schools of the university and took doctor's degrees in divinity. Soon afterwards he entered the Order of Friars Minor. He enjoyed a great reputation as a theologian, and his commentaries on the theologian Duns Scotus (1266–1308) were held in high repute. It was principally due to his great influence at the Spanish Court that the Irish Franciscan College of St. Anthony was founded at Leuven (Louvain).\n\nAfter his admission into the Order, Mac Cathmhaoil taught for some time in the University of Salamanca. He was appointed as superior and lecturer at St. Anthony's, Leuven, and moved to Belgium. Among his pupils were John Colgan, Patrick Fleming, Hugh Ward, and Antony Hickey. He was summoned to Rome to lecture in the convent of Aracoeli; but his energies were not limited to his work as professor. He was employed by the pope on several commissions.\n\nHe carried out a papal mission to Ulster in 1613. Over the next three decades, Louvain produced a remarkable outpouring of Gaelic scholarship and devotional texts in Irish. In scouring the north and midlands of Ireland for all available manuscripts, to write an ecclesiastical history of Ireland, his associates (Mícheál Ó Cléirigh, a trained historian) and Aodh Mac an Bhaird (Hugh Ward) are credited with saving many of the Irish manuscripts that still survive. \n\nMac Cathmhaoil was elected Definitor General of the Friars Minor of the Strict Observance, which gave him authority over all the friars in Europe who followed that branch of the Reform within Order. In that capacity, he gave substantial help to Friar Luke Wadding in founding and developing the College of San Isidore and Ludovisi's Pontifical Irish College in Rome, for Irish students. On 17 March 1626, Pope Urban VIII, passing over all the other candidates, nominated Mac Aingil as Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland. The consecration took place on 7 June, in the church of St. Isidore. Thomas Walsh, Archbishop of Cashel, was consecrated at the same time. The consecrating prelate was Cardinal Gabriel de Trejo, a great friend of the Irish.\n\nMac Cathmhaoil's health had been much weakened by his duties and the austerities he practised. In making the visitations of the provinces of the Order, he had always travelled on foot. He also spent much time in prayer and fasting. While preparing for his departure, he caught a fever and died. \n\nMac Cathmhaoil was buried in the Church of St. Isidore. His friend John O'Neill, 3rd Earl of Tyrone, arranged for a monument to be placed on his grave. The Latin playwright, Nicolaus Vernulæus (1583–1649), delivered a panegyric before the university commemorating the virtues and learning of the archbishop, saying that he was conspicuous for his virtues, and that his holiness of life and profound learning made him the miracle of his time. This address was later published in Cologne in 1657.\n\nMac Cathmhaoil composed four Christmas carols in Irish. His major works were in Latin about theology. In his \"Apologia pro Johanne Duns-Scoto\", he engaged in Franciscan defence of Duns Scotus against the Dominican-inspired attacks of Bzovius and Cornelius Jansen, claiming Scotus as an Irishman. He also wrote a work in Irish, which was printed at the Irish press in the college of St. Anthony's, Leuven, in 1618, entitled \"Scáthán Shacramuinte na hAthridhe\", or \"Tractatus de poenitentia et indulgentiis\", that is, \"The Mirror of the Sacrament of Penance\". (The Latin title did not appear in the text and was used only for cataloguing purposes in Latin libraries.)\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3804454", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3804454", "title": "Archontics", "text": "Archontics\n\nThe Archontics, or Archontici, were a Gnostic sect that existed in Palestine and Armenia, who arose towards the close of the 2nd century CE. They were thus called from the Greek word , \"principalities\", or \"rulers\", by reason that they held the world to have been created and ruled by malevolent \"Archons\".\n\nEpiphanius of Salamis seems to be the earliest Christian writer who speaks of this sect. He relates that a young priest in Palestine named Peter had been charged with heresy, deposed from the office of the priesthood and expelled by Bishop Aëtius. He fled into a part of Arabia, where there was a center of Ebionitism. In his old age, he returned to Palestine, where he lived the life of an anchorite in a cave near Jerusalem and attracted followers by the austerity of his life and the practice of extreme poverty. Shortly before the death of Constantius II (337-361), Eutactus, coming from Egypt, visited the anchorite Peter and was imbued by him with the doctrines of the sect and carried them into Greater and Lesser Armenia.\n\nThe Archontics held that there were Seven Heavens, ruled by the Demiurge surrounded by Archons begotten by him, who are the jailers of the souls. In the eighth heaven dwells the supreme Mother of light. The king or tyrant of the seventh heaven is Sabaoth, the god of the Jews, who is the father of the Devil. The Devil, dwelling upon earth, rebelled against his father, and opposed him in all things, and by Eve begot Cain and Abel. Cain slew Abel in a quarrel about their sister, whom both loved. \n\n\"They say,\" records Epiphanius, \"that the soul is the food of the Archons and Powers without which they cannot live, because she is of the dew from above and gives them strength. When she has become imbued with knowledge ... she ascends to heaven and gives a defence before each Power and thus mounts beyond them to the upper Mother and Father of the All whence she came down into this world.\"\n\n\"Some of them\", continues Epiphanius, \"pretend to fast after the manner of the monks, deceiving the simple, and boast of having renounced all property.\" Theodoret reports that it was the practice of some to pour oil and water on the heads of the dead, thereby rendering them invisible to the Archons and withdrawing them from their power. However, Epiphanius states that \"they condemn baptism and reject the participation of the Holy Mysteries as something introduced by the tyrant Sabaoth, and teach other fables full of impiety.\"\n\nTheir apocryphal books included: \n\n"}

{"id": "569092", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=569092", "title": "Behavioral modernity", "text": "Behavioral modernity\n\nBehavioral modernity is a suite of behavioral and cognitive traits that distinguishes current \"Homo sapiens\" from other anatomically modern humans, hominins, and primates. Although often debated, most scholars agree that modern human behavior can be characterized by abstract thinking, planning depth, symbolic behavior (e.g., art, ornamentation, music), exploitation of large game, and blade technology, among others. Underlying these behaviors and technological innovations are cognitive and cultural foundations that have been documented experimentally and ethnographically. Some of these human universal patterns are cumulative cultural adaptation, social norms, language, and extensive help and cooperation beyond close kin. It has been argued that the development of these modern behavioral traits, in combination with the climatic conditions of the Last Glacial Maximum, was largely responsible for the human replacement of Neanderthals and the peopling of the rest of the world.\n\nArising from differences in the archaeological record, a debate continues as to whether anatomically modern humans were behaviorally modern as well. There are many theories on the evolution of behavioral modernity. These generally fall into two camps: gradualist and cognitive approaches. The Later Upper Paleolithic Model refers to the idea that modern human behavior arose through cognitive, genetic changes abruptly around 40,000–50,000 years ago. Other models focus on how modern human behavior may have arisen through gradual steps; the archaeological signatures of such behavior only appearing through demographic or subsistence-based changes.\n\nTo classify what traits should be included in modern human behavior, it is necessary to define behaviors that are universal among living human groups. Some examples of these human universals are abstract thought, planning, trade, cooperative labor, body decoration, control and use of fire. Along with these traits, humans possess much reliance on social learning. This cumulative cultural change or cultural \"ratchet\" separates human culture from social learning in animals. As well, a reliance on social learning may be responsible in part for humans' rapid adaptation to many environments outside of Africa.\nSince cultural universals are found in all cultures including some of the most isolated indigenous groups, these traits must have evolved or have been invented in Africa prior to the exodus.\n\nArchaeologically, a number of empirical traits have been used as indicators of modern human behavior. While these are often debated a few are generally agreed upon. Archaeological evidence of behavioral modernity includes:\n\n\nSeveral critiques have been placed against the traditional concept of behavioral modernity, both methodologically and philosophically. Shea (2011) outlines a variety of problems with this concept, arguing instead for \"behavioral variability\", which, according to the author, better describes the archaeological record. The use of trait lists, according to Shea (2011), runs the risk of taphonomic bias, where some sites may yield more artifacts than others despite similar populations; as well, trait lists can be ambiguous in how behaviors may be empirically recognized in the archaeological record. Shea (2011) in particular cautions that population pressure, cultural change, or optimality models, like those in human behavioral ecology, might better predict changes in tool types or subsistence strategies than a change from \"archaic\" to \"modern\" behavior. Some researchers argue that a greater emphasis should be placed on identifying only those artifacts which are unquestionably, or purely, symbolic as a metric for modern human behavior.\n\nThe Late Upper Paleolithic Model, or Upper Paleolithic Revolution, refers to the idea that, though anatomically modern humans first appear around 150,000 years ago, they were not cognitively or behaviorally \"modern\" until around 50,000 years ago, leading to their expansion into Europe and Asia. These authors note that traits used as a metric for behavioral modernity do not appear as a package until around 40–50,000 years ago. Klein (1995) specifically describes evidence of fishing, bone shaped as a tool, hearths, significant artifact diversity, and elaborate graves are all absent before this point. Although assemblages before 50,000 years ago show some diversity the only distinctly modern tool assemblages appear in Europe at 48,000. According to these authors, art only becomes common beyond this switching point, signifying a change from archaic to modern humans. Most researchers argue that a neurological or genetic change, perhaps one enabling complex language, such as FOXP2, caused this revolutionary change in our species.\n\nContrasted with this view of a spontaneous leap in cognition among ancient humans, some authors like Alison S. Brooks, primarily working in African archaeology, point to the gradual accumulation of \"modern\" behaviors, starting well before the 50,000 year benchmark of the Upper Paleolithic Revolution models. Howiesons Poort, Blombos, and other South African archaeological sites, for example, show evidence of marine resource acquisition, trade, and abstract ornamentation at least by 80,000 years ago. Given evidence from Africa and the Middle East, a variety of hypotheses have been put forth to describe an earlier, gradual transition from simple to more complex human behavior. Some authors have pushed back the appearance of fully modern behavior to around 80,000 years ago in order to incorporate the South African data.\n\nOthers focus on the slow accumulation of different technologies and behaviors across time. These researchers describe how anatomically modern humans could have been cognitively the same and what we define as behavioral modernity is just the result of thousands of years of cultural adaptation and learning. D'Errico and others have looked at Neanderthal culture rather than early human behavior for clues into behavioral modernity. Noting that Neanderthal assemblages often portray traits similar to those listed for modern human behavior, researchers stress that the foundations for behavioral modernity may in fact lie deeper in our hominin ancestors. If both modern humans and Neanderthals express abstract art and complex tools then \"modern human behavior\" cannot be a derived trait for our species. They argue that the original \"human revolution\" theory reflects a profound Eurocentric bias. Recent archaeological evidence, they argue, proves that humans evolving in Africa some 300,000 or even 400,000 years ago were already becoming cognitively and behaviourally \"modern\". These features include blade and microlithic technology, bone tools, increased geographic range, specialized hunting, the use of aquatic resources, long distance trade, systematic processing and use of pigment, and art and decoration. These items do not occur suddenly together as predicted by the \"human revolution\" model, but at sites that are widely separated in space and time. This suggests a gradual assembling of the package of modern human behaviours in Africa, and its later export to other regions of the Old World.\n\nBetween these extremes is the view – currently supported by archaeologists Chris Henshilwood, Curtis Marean, Ian Watts and others – that there was indeed some kind of 'human revolution' but that it occurred in Africa and spanned tens of thousands of years. The term \"revolution\" in this context would mean not a sudden mutation but a historical development along the lines of \"the industrial revolution\" or \"the Neolithic revolution\". In other words, it was a relatively accelerated process, too rapid for ordinary Darwinian \"descent with modification\" yet too gradual to be attributed to a single genetic or other sudden event. These archaeologists point in particular to the relatively explosive emergence of ochre crayons and shell necklaces apparently used for cosmetic purposes. These archaeologists see symbolic organisation of human social life as the key transition in modern human evolution. Recently discovered at sites such as Blombos Cave and Pinnacle Point, South Africa, pierced shells, pigments and other striking signs of personal ornamentation have been dated within a time-window of 70,000–160,000 years ago in the African Middle Stone Age, suggesting that the emergence of \"Homo sapiens\" coincided, after all, with the transition to modern cognition and behaviour. While viewing the emergence of language as a 'revolutionary' development, this school of thought generally attributes it to cumulative social, cognitive and cultural evolutionary processes as opposed to a single genetic mutation.\n\nA further view, taken by archaeologists such as Francesco D'Errico and João Zilhão, is a multi-species perspective arguing that evidence for symbolic culture in the form of utilised pigments and pierced shells are also found in Neanderthal sites, independently of any \"modern\" human influence.\n\nCultural evolutionary models may also shed light on why although evidence of behavioral modernity exists before 50,000 years ago it is not expressed consistently until that point. With small population sizes, human groups would have been affected by demographic and cultural evolutionary forces that may not have allowed for complex cultural traits. According to some authors until population density became significantly high, complex traits could not have been maintained effectively. It is worth noting that some genetic evidence supports a dramatic increase in population size before human migration out of Africa. High local extinction rates within a population also can significantly decrease the amount of diversity in neutral cultural traits, regardless of cognitive ability.\n\nHighly speculatively, bicameral mind theory argues for an additional, and cultural rather than genetic, shift from selfless to self-perceiving forms of human cognition and behavior very late in human history, in the Bronze Age. This is based on a literary analysis of Bronze Age texts which claims to show the first appearances of the concept of self around this time, replacing the voices of gods as the primary form of recorded human cognition. This non-mainstream theory is not widely accepted but does receive serious academic interest from time to time.\n\nBefore the Out of Africa theory was generally accepted, there was no consensus on where the human species evolved and, consequently, where modern human behavior arose. Now, however, African archaeology has become extremely important in discovering the origins of humanity. Since human expansion into Europe around 48,000 years ago is generally accepted as already \"modern\", the question becomes whether behavioral modernity appeared in Africa well before 50,000 years ago, as a late Upper Paleolithic \"revolution\" which prompted migration out of Africa, or arose outside Africa and diffused back.\n\nA variety of evidence of abstract imagery, widened subsistence strategies, and other \"modern\" behaviors have been discovered in Africa, especially South and North Africa. The Blombos Cave site in South Africa, for example, is famous for rectangular slabs of ochre engraved with geometric designs. Using multiple dating techniques, the site was confirmed to be around 77,000 years old. Beads and other personal ornamentation have been found from Morocco which might be as much as 130,000 years old; as well, the Cave of Hearths in South Africa has yielded a number of beads significantly before 50,000 years ago.\n\nExpanding subsistence strategies beyond big-game hunting and the consequential diversity in tool types has been noted as signs of behavioral modernity. A number of South African sites have shown an early reliance on aquatic resources from fish to shellfish. Pinnacle Point, in particular, shows exploitation of marine resources as early as 120,000 years ago, perhaps in response to more arid conditions inland. Establishing a reliance on predictable shellfish deposits, for example, could reduce mobility and facilitate complex social systems and symbolic behavior. Blombos Cave and Site 440 in Sudan both show evidence of fishing as well. Taphonomic change in fish skeletons from Blombos Cave have been interpreted as capture of live fish, clearly an intentional human behavior.\n\nHumans in North Africa (Nazlet Sabaha, Egypt) are known to have dabbled in chert mining, as early as ~100,000 years ago, for the construction of stone tools.\n\nWhile traditionally described as evidence for the later Upper Paleolithic Model, European archaeology has shown that the issue is more complex. A variety of stone tool technologies are present at the time of human expansion into Europe and show evidence of modern behavior. Despite the problems of conflating specific tools with cultural groups, the Aurignacian tool complex, for example, is generally taken as a purely modern human signature. The discovery of \"transitional\" complexes, like \"proto-Aurignacian\", have been taken as evidence of human groups progressing through \"steps of innovation\". If, as this might suggest, human groups were already migrating into eastern Europe around 40,000 years and only afterward show evidence of behavioral modernity, then either the cognitive change must have diffused back into Africa or was already present before migration.\n\nIn light of a growing body of evidence of Neanderthal culture and tool complexes some researchers have put forth a \"multiple species model\" for behavioral modernity. Neanderthals were often cited as being an evolutionary dead-end, apish cousins who were less advanced than their human contemporaries. Personal ornaments were relegated as trinkets or poor imitations compared to the cave art produced by \"H. sapiens\". Despite this, European evidence has shown a variety of personal ornaments and artistic artifacts produced by Neanderthals; for example, the Neanderthal site of Grotte du Renne has produced grooved bear, wolf, and fox incisors, ochre and other symbolic artifacts. Although burials are few and controversial, there has been circumstantial evidence of Neanderthal ritual burials. There are two options to describe this symbolic behavior among Neanderthals: they copied cultural traits from arriving modern humans or they had their own cultural traditions comparative with behavioral modernity. If they just copied cultural traditions, which is debated by several authors, they still possessed the capacity for complex culture described by behavioral modernity. As discussed above, if Neanderthals also were \"behaviorally modern\" then it cannot be a species-specific derived trait.\n\nMost debates surrounding behavioral modernity have been focused on Africa or Europe but an increasing amount of focus has been placed on East Asia. This region offers a unique opportunity to test hypotheses of multi-regionalism, replacement, and demographic effects. Unlike Europe, where initial migration occurred around 50,000 years ago, human remains have been dated in China to around 100,000 years ago. This early evidence of human expansion calls into question behavioral modernity as an impetus for migration.\n\nStone tool technology is particularly of interest in East Asia. Following Homo erectus migrations out of Africa, Acheulean technology never seems to appear beyond present-day India and into China. Analogously, Mode 3, or Levallois technology, is not apparent in China following later hominin dispersals. This lack of more advanced technology has been explained by serial founder effects and low population densities out of Africa. Although tool complexes comparative to Europe are missing or fragmentary, other archaeological evidence shows behavioral modernity. For example, the peopling of the Japanese archipelago offers an opportunity to investigate the early use of watercraft. Although one site, Kanedori in Honshu, does suggest the use of watercraft as early as 84,000 years ago, there is no other evidence of hominins in Japan until 50,000 years ago.\n\nThe Zhoukoudian cave system near Beijing has been excavated since the 1930s and has yielded precious data on early human behavior in East Asia. Although disputed, there is evidence of possible human burials and interred remains in the cave dated to around 34-20,000 years ago. These remains have associated personal ornaments in the form of beads and worked shell, suggesting symbolic behavior. Along with possible burials, numerous other symbolic objects like punctured animal teeth and beads, some dyed in red ochre, have all been found at Zhoukoudian. Although fragmentary, the archaeological record of eastern Asia shows evidence of behavioral modernity before 50,000 years ago but, like the African record, it is not fully apparent until that time.\n\n"}

It is a self-referential paradox that involves a proposition pronounced about an event that might or might not happen in the future.\n\nThe sophism is:\nSocrates' response puts Plato in a difficult situation. He could not throw Socrates into the water, because if he did he would violate his promise to let Socrates cross the bridge if he speaks the truth. On the other hand, if Plato allows Socrates to cross the bridge it would mean that Socrates spoke untruth when he replied: \"You are going to throw me into the water.\" In that case Socrates should have been thrown into the water. In other words, Socrates could be allowed to cross the bridge if and only if he could not be.\n\nIn order to solve the paradox Buridan proposes three questions:\n\nIn response to the first question Buridan states that it is impossible to determine if Socrates' proposition is true or false. This is because the proposition \"You are going to throw me into the water\" is a future contingent that could be true or false depending on what Plato is going to do. Dr. Joseph W. Ulatowski says that Buridan apparently used Aristotle's thesis about what \"truth\" is to come up with this response. Aristotle believed that a proposition is true if and only if it is verified by the state of things as they currently are. Contradicting the principle of bivalence, Buridan implies a system of three-valued logic in which there are three truth values--\"true\", \"false\", and some indeterminate third value.\n\nIn determining the truth value of Plato's conditional promise, Buridan suggests that Plato's promise was false, and that because Plato gave his promise carelessly he is not obligated to fulfill the promise.\n\nIn discussing the third question, \"What ought Plato to do to fulfill his promise\", Buridan states that Plato should not have given a conditional promise in the first place. He also suggests that Plato could have made sure that the condition was formulated in such a way that it would not cause a contradiction; because Plato cannot fulfill his conditional promise without violating it, he is not obligated to fulfill the promise. Ulatowski points out that this interpretation is the contrapositive of a principle of Immanuel Kant: \"ought implies can\".\n\nIn his solution to the sophism, Walter Burley (d. 1344/1345) applied the principle \"nothing is true unless at this instant\" (\"nihil est verum nisi in hoc instanti\") and concluded that \"if a proposition is true it must be true now\".\n\nDr. Dale Jacquette of the University of Bern says that \"Plato can either permit Socrates to pass or have him seized and thrown into the river without violating his conditional vow\". Jacquette argues that Plato's conditional promise was given only in regard to Socrates's proposition being clearly and unconditionally either true or false. To prove his point Jacquette asks, what would Plato have to do if Socrates had said nothing and was \"as silent as a Sphinx\", or if he uttered something that could not be either proven or \"undisproven\", something like Goldbach's conjecture. Jacquette concludes that Plato's conditional promise was true, and Socrates's proposition is \"neither true \"simpliciter\" nor false \"simpliciter\"\", and therefore Plato would be right regardless of the choice that he made.\n\nIn his book \"Paradoxes from A to Z\" Professor Michael Clark comes to the conclusion that if Plato is an honorable man, Socrates should not get wet under any circumstances. Clark argues that Socrates could say, \"Either I am speaking falsely, and you will throw me in, or I am speaking truly, and you won't throw me in\". Clark says that if this sentence is true, then it means that the first alternative \"is ruled out\", leaving us only with the second one. If this sentence is false, it means that both alternatives are false, and because Socrates spoke falsely \"it will be false\" to throw him into the river. \n\nDr. Joseph W. Ulatowski believes that since the truth value in Plato's conditional promise and even more so in Socrates's proposition is indeterminate, it means that Plato \"ought to err on the side of caution with respect to the future contingency and allow Socrates to cross the bridge\". In the same work Ulatowski offers a couple of humorous solutions to the paradox. Plato, Ulatowski says, could let Socrates to cross the bridge, and then throw him into water on the other side. Or both Plato and Socrates could combine their efforts and forcibly eject Buridan himself from Buridan's bridge.\n\nBuridan's bridge sophism was used by Miguel de Cervantes in \"Don Quixote\", when Sancho was presented with the Buridan's bridge dilemma: A man who was going to cross the bridge was asked to respond truthfully where he was going or otherwise to face a death by hanging. The man \"swore and said that by the oath he took he was going to die upon that gallows that stood there, and nothing else.\"\n\nSancho summarizes the situation by saying: \"the man swears that he is going to die upon the gallows; but if he dies upon it, he has sworn the truth, and by the law enacted deserves to go free and pass over the bridge; but if they don't hang him, then he has sworn falsely, and by the same law deserves to be hanged\". He then comes up with the solution, \"that of this man they should let pass the part that has sworn truly, and hang the part that has lied; and in this way the conditions of the passage will be fully complied with\". After Sancho makes this statement, the person who was asking for advice reasons with him: Sancho comes up with the moral solution:\n"}

{"id": "31753664", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31753664", "title": "Chunseong", "text": "Chunseong\n\nChunseong (), born Lee Chang-nim (이창림, 李昌林; March 30, 1891 – August 22, 1977), was a Korean Buddhist monk, scholar, poet, writer, and philosopher. His courtesy name was Muaedoin (무애도인, 無碍道人) or Chunseong (춘성, 春性).\n\nChunseong was born on March 30, 1891, in Inje county, Gangwon Province. His father was Lee In-oh (이인오, 李仁五) and his mother was Lady Park of Milyang (밀양박씨). He was their fifth son. Chunseong's family line was of the Pyeongchang Lee clan (평창이씨, 平昌李氏). His father was a tenant farmer. Although Chunseong's birth name was Lee Chang-nim (이창림, 李昌林), his Dharma name was Chunseong (춘성, 春城). He was often called Chunseong Chunseong (春城 春性).\n\nIn his early years, Chunseong went to the Baekdamsa (백담사), a famous Buddhist temple in Inje. He begged to be a pupil, but abbess Manhae Han Yong-un (만해 한용운, 萬海 韓龍雲) rejected him because he was too young. Eventually, at age fifteen, he became a Buddhist monk, apprenticing under Manhae Han Yong-un.\n\nChunseong was required to read through Hwaeomgyeong (화엄경, 華嚴經) and Geumganggyeong (금강경, 金剛經). He studied them so well that he could recite the Hwaeomgyeong backwards. Because of this, he earned the nickname \"Hwaeom monk\" (화엄법사, 華嚴法師).\n\nIn November 1918, Chunseong's teacher published \"Yusim\" (translated as \"whole mind\"), a series of magazines that written to make Buddhism appeal to the youth. The following year, Yong-un was imprisoned for his involvement with the March 1 movement. Chunseong remained dutiful to his teacher while he was in prison and was the only head monk who regularly visited and sent over food and supplies. Even though his temple had plenty of firewood, Chunseong refused to use any heat during winter and slept in a freezing cold room: \"My teacher is shivering in a cold cell in Seodaemun Prison because he was captured by the Japanese while fighting for independence. So how can I, his disciple, sleep in the comfort of a warm room?\"\n\nRight after the Korean War, it was illegal to cut down trees. Even though it was freezing cold weather, no one could gather firewood to heat themselves. So Chunseong decided to cut down some wood for firewood as well as to make repairs to the dilapidated temple. He got caught and was arrested the Japanese police for violating forestry laws. During his interrogation at the Uijeongbu Police Station, a detective asked Chunseong, \"what is your address?\" to which he replied, \"my mother's vagina.\" The detective thought Chunseong was strange so he rephrased his question. \"Where is your hometown?\" Again, Chunseong replied saying, \"my mother's vagina.\" Despite numerous attempts of asking these questions, Chunseong only responded with, \"my mother's vagina.\"\n\nThis infuriated the detective so he told Chunseong to stop messing around and give a proper answer. So he asked, \"Where is your legal domicile?\" This time Chunseong responded with, \"my father's penis.\" At this point, the police realized that they weren't able to get through to him so they sent him away, assuming he wasn't mentally sound.\n\nOne day, after visiting a temple, he was on his way back to Uijeongbu on a bus. On the ride, there was a Christian fanatic who was shouting into a loudspeaker, \"Believe in Jesus Christ who died and resurrected! If you believe in Him, you will go to heaven!\" This Christian saw that Chunseong was dressed in a monk's robe, and decided to stand in front of him and yell these words.\n\nChunseong decided to yell back, \"What did you say? He died and rose again? The only thing that dies and rises again is my penis every morning!\"\n\nThe Christian felt awkward and got off on the next station to get away from the situation.\n\nChunseong enjoyed his fair share of alcoholic drinks and often drank beer and makgeolli (which he referred to as gokcha, or grain drinks).\n\nOne night, he had too much to drink and got caught violating curfew hours by a police officer. The police asked \"Who are you?\" Chunseong said, \"I am a Jungdaejang (translated to \"company commander\")! The police officer went closer to him and upon seeing that he wasn't in the military, but was instead dressed in a monk's robe, he said, \"Why would you lie saying that you were a company commander?\" Chunseong replied, \"I am the commander (daejang) of monks (jung), so am I not a Jungdaejang?\"\n\nThe joke was a play on words because \"Jung\" means monk and \"Daejang\" means commander. Upon hearing this joke, the police officer let Chunseong get on his way because he thought he was a strange man.\n\nAn elderly woman who regularly sought Chunseong to hear his lectures had a spinster for a granddaughter because her standards were too high. The elderly women sent her granddaughter to Chunseong so that he could teach her a lesson. The granddaughter showed up to meet him wearing a miniskirt. Upon seeing her, Chunseong said, \"How can my big thing fit into your tiny thing?\"\n\nThe granddaughter's face grew bright red as she ran out of the room crying out that he was a \"sham of a monk.\"\n\nShe returned to her home and was upset at her grandmother for sending her to see this monk. What he really meant was \"How can his large teaching fit into your tiny mind\" Upon hearing this, the spinster felt ashamed that she had jumped to a sexual conclusion.\n\nThroughout his life, Chunseong slept without a quilt or blanket. In the Korean language, the spelling of quilt is \"Yibul\" (이불). Because the word \"Yibul\" had another meaning, \"to separate from Buddha,\" Chunseong refused to sleep with a blanket (이불, 離佛, to separate Buddha).\n\nChunseong did not believe in owning things. Even when his followers gave him clothes, he would give them to beggars and vagrants he encountered. Because of this, he had to hide his naked body until he could return to the temple at night. He also generously gave away all the money he received from his followers.\n\nIn the 1940s, he was told to cooperate with the law of Sōshi-kaimei (창씨개명, 創氏改名) and change his name to comply with the Japanese colonial authorities, but he refused.\n\nIn 1944, he went to the Doksungsan Sudeok Temple, where he studied under Mangong Song Wolmyon (만공 송월면, 萬空 宋月面). Mangong was top of the Korean Ganhwaseon (看話禪, 간화선). He trained for Mangong. In 1946 he returned to Mangwol Temple (망월사, 望月寺) as its head. Chunseong was attacked for hypocrisy, rigorism, pretended philanthropy and formalism. In July 1949, he participated in funerals for Baikbum Kim Gu (백범김구 국민장, 白凡金九 國民葬)\n\nIn 1950, during the Korean War, he escaped and returned to Mangwol Temple. At the end of the Korean War, he returned to his monks with bashfulness.\n\nDuring the war, he preserved the Ganhwaseon tradition and the Mangwol Temple. In the 1950s, he became abbot of the Mangwol Temple, Shinheung Temple and the Bomun Temple.\n\nIn the 1960s, the South Korean regent was Park Chung-hee. In 1964, Chunseong was invited by him to Chungwadae (청와대, 靑瓦臺) since the First Lady, Yuk Young-su was a devout Buddhist. During his visit, Chunseong said, \"the Lady Yuk was born from her mother's vagina,\" which caused many to panic.\n\nIn 1970, he again went to Mangwol temple. From 1970 to 1973 he practiced asceticism for Jangjabulwa (장좌불와, 長坐不臥), In 1973 he participated in public campaigns for safe driving and sobriety.\n\nIn 1977, he died in Mangwolsa, in Uijongbu. He was 86 years old.\nAt his funeral, he did not have a coffin. Instead, his corpse was covered with a straw mat. His funeral was short, with a short funeral march, during which the monks sang the song, \"Grief of a drifter\" (나그네 설움). His ashes are enshrined at the Bongkuk Temple, which is located in Seongnam.\n\nLong after his death, Chunseong's name was a social taboo for South Korea because of his controversial words and actions along with the social influence of Confucianism. That taboo eased in the 1990s, but in 2002, Doal Kim Yong-ok used one of his anecdotes for a program on EBS. In 2004, South Korean broadcasting programs began to report more of his words and actions.\n\n\n\n"}

A patient regarded by his psychoanalyst as \"in denial\" about his sexual orientation may be viewed as confirming he is homosexual simply by denying that he is; and if he has had sex with women, he may be accused of trying to buttress his denials. In other words, there is no way the patient could convincingly demonstrate his heterosexuality to his analyst. This is an example of what Popper called a \"closed circle\": The proposition that the patient is homosexual is not falsifiable.\n\nClosed-circle theory is sometimes used to denote a relativist, anti-realist philosophy of science, such that different groups may have different self-consistent truth claims about the natural world.\n"}

{"id": "1976413", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1976413", "title": "Divergent evolution", "text": "Divergent evolution\n\nDivergent evolution or divergent selection is the accumulation of differences between closely related species populations, leading to speciation. Divergent evolution is typically exhibited when two populations become separated by a geographic barrier (such as in allopatric or peripatric speciation) and experience different selective pressures that drive adaptions to their new environment. After many generations and continual evolution, the populations become unable to interbreed with one another. The American naturalist J. T. Gulick (1832-1923) was the first to use the term \"divergent evolution\", with its use becoming widespread in modern evolutionary literature. Classic examples of divergence in nature are the adaptive radiation of the finches of the Galapagos or the coloration differences in populations of a species that live in different habitats such as with pocket mice and fence lizards.\n\nThe term can also be applied in molecular evolution, such as to proteins that derive from homologous genes. Both orthologous genes (resulting from a speciation event) and paralogous genes (resulting from gene duplication) can illustrate divergent evolution. Through gene duplication, it is possible for divergent evolution to occur between two genes within a species. Similarities between species that have diverged are due to their common origin, so such similarities are homologies. In contrast, convergent evolution arises when an adaptation has arisen independently, creating analogous structures such as the wings of birds and of insects.\n\n"}
{"id": "10445418", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10445418", "title": "Eastern philosophy in clinical psychology", "text": "Eastern philosophy in clinical psychology\n\nEastern philosophy in clinical psychology refers to the influence of Eastern philosophies on the practice of clinical psychology based on the idea that East and West are false dichotomies. Travel and trade along the Silk Road brought ancient texts and mind practices deep into the West. Vedic psychology dates back 5000 years and forms the core of mental health counselling in the Ayurvedic medical tradition. The knowledge that enlightened Siddhartha Gautama was the self-management of mental suffering through mindfulness awareness practices. Humane interpersonal care of the mentally disturbed was practiced in the Middle East in the Middle Ages, and later in the West. Many of the founders of clinical psychology were influenced by these ancient texts as translations began to reach Europe during the 19th century.\n\nThe historical practice of clinical psychology may be distinguished from the modern profession of clinical psychology. The Greek word \"psyche\" means 'breath' or 'soul', while \"-logy\" (from \"logos\", meaning 'speech') means 'study of'. Psyche was the Greek goddess of the soul. An early use of the word clinic was to describe 'one who receives baptism on a sick bed' (Webster 1913). In contemporary use it usually describes another kind of cleansing and rebirth – a non-hospital, healthcare facility for rehabilitation in the community.\n\nPatanjali was one of the founders of the yoga tradition, sometime between 200 and 400 BC (pre-dating Buddhist psychology) and a student of the Vedas. He developed the science of breath and mind and wrote his knowledge in the form of between 194 and 196 aphorisms called the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali. These remain one of the only scientific books written in poetic form. He is reputed to have used yoga therapeutically for anxiety, depression and mental disorders as common then as now.\nPadmasambhava was the 8th-century medicine Buddha of Tibet, called from the then Buddhist India to tame the Tibetans, and was instrumental in developing Tibetan psychiatric medicine. Tibetans were diplomats, counselors, traders, warriors and military tacticians in the Royal courts of East and West. Through these means they introduced arts of war and medicine to the west.\n\nRhazes was a Persian physician and scholar of the Middle Ages who had a profound effect on Western thought and medicine as well as the invention of alcohol and of sulfur drugs. He applied the psychology of self-esteem in clinical treatment of his patients (predating Nathaniel Branden by over a thousand years). He opened the first hospital ward for humane treatment of the mentally ill.\n\nAvicenna's \"Canon of Medicine\" was a standard medical text in many European universities for 500 years. He performed psychotherapy without conversing, by observing the movement of a patient's pulse as the patient recounted broken hearted anguish, reported in 'The Life and Work of Jalaluddin Rumi' by Afzal Iqbal, A. J. Arberry, page 94. His treatises have touched most of the Muslim circle of the sciences.\n\nJalaluddin Rumi's view on psychotherapy was to embrace the dread, depression and anger as a blessing. Negative emotions were a bridge to a better life. This style of coping is illustrated in his guesthouse poem: \n\nSigmund Freud read the German translation of the works of Hayyim ben Joseph Vital (1542–1620). Vital was a 16th-century rabbi who had been Isaac Luria's student, the great master of the theosophical Kabbalah. Freud read the French translation of the Zohar. He declared the material 'gold!' without acknowledging that source in his theories. His corpus was deeply influenced by his Jewish heritage and by the Jewish mysticism.\nCarl Jung read the German translations by Richard Wilhelm of \"The Secret of the Golden Flower\", the I Ching. He also read the Kabbalah and drew on its sources for development of his theory of the archetypes.\n\nMartin Buber\n\nKaren Horney studied Zen-Buddhism.\n\nFritz Perls studied Zen Buddhism. Typifying such a perspective, Perls once stated: We must lose our minds and come to our senses.\n\nErich Fromm collaborated with D. T. Suzuki in a 1957 workshop on \"Zen Buddhism and Psychoanalysis\"; wrote the foreword to a 1986 anthology of Nyanaponika Thera's essays.\n\nErik H. Erikson wrote a biography of Gandhi.\nViktor Frankl was the founder of Logotherapy. He wrote \"From Death Camp to Existentialism\" (1959) drawing on concentration camp experience and Jewish mysticism.\n\nAbraham Maslow, an American-born Jew who struggled to make his way as a psychologist in an academic atmosphere which was not then ready to receive Jews. He believed his theories of motivation and self-actualization were, despite his avowed atheism, driven by a Jewish consciousness. The Transpersonal psychology that Maslow founded is a blend of Eastern and Western mystic traditions.\n\nStanislav Grof studied pre-industrial cosmologies including Egyptian and explored the significance of the posthumous journey of the soul in works such as \"Books of the Dead\" and \"The Human Encounter with Death\".\n\nBaruch Spinoza's legacy to psychology includes his holistic approach and determinism. He was alienated from his Jewish roots by excommunication and yet embedded in Jewish philosophy and mysticism, for example, 'The human mind cannot be absolutely destroyed with the body, but something of it remains, which is eternal. We feel and know by experience that we are eternal'. (Book V, Proposition 23). He distinguished between active emotions (those that are rationally understood) and passive emotions (those that are not). This predated Freud's popularization of the unconscious mind. His view, that emotions must be detached from external cause in order to master them, presages rational emotive therapy. His understanding of the workings of mind makes a bridge between religious mysticism and clinical psychology.\n\nArthur Schopenhauer was deeply influenced by the first translations of Hindu and Buddhist texts to reach the west in the 19th Century. His philosophy and methods of inquiry have many similarities to those traditions. His ideas foreshadowed and laid the groundwork for Darwin's theory of evolution and Freud's concepts of libido and unconscious mind. He added empiricism to self-examination, which presaged Freud's interpersonal application in psychoanalysis.\nCaroline Rhys Davids was a Pali scholar who translated original Pali texts in Buddhist Psychology. In 1914, she wrote \"Buddhist Psychology: An Inquiry into the Analysis and Theory of Mind in Pali Literature\". Her teacher in Psychology was George Croom Robertson, Scottish philosopher, editor of Mind from foundation in 1876 until 1891.\n\nRichard Wilhelm was a translator of Chinese into German of the I Ching, Tao Te Ching and The Secret of the Golden Flower, with a forward written by Jung, a close personal friend.\nIdries Shah was an author in the Naqshbandi sufist tradition who wrote works on psychology and spirituality. Defined Sufism in a way that predated Islam and did not depend on the Qur'an.\n\nColeman Barks has translated ecstatic poems of Rumi and other mystic poets of Persia.\n\nJack Kornfield trained as a Buddhist monk in India and Southeast Asia, holds a PhD in clinical psychology and co-founded the Insight Meditation Society and the Spirit Rock Meditation Center.

According to this paradigm, God's \"self-contraction\" to vacate space for the world serves as a model for human behavior and interaction. The tzimtzum model promotes a unique community-centric approach which contrasts starkly with the language of Western psychology.\n\n\n\n\n\nNeuroscience and Buddhism\nSarunya Prasopchingchana & Dana Sugu, 'Distinctiveness of the Unseen Buddhist Identity' ([1]International Journal of Humanistic Ideology, Cluj-Napoca, Romania, vol. 4, 2010)\n"}

His works primarily dealt with the development of ethics through education, sexology, politics and international law.\n\nFoerster was one of the sons of German astronomer Wilhelm Julius Foerster, a director of the Berlin Observatory and a professor at the University of Berlin. His two younger brothers became renowned is various areas in their own right; Karl Foerster as a landscape gardener and horticulturalist, and Dr. Ernst Foerster as a shipbuilder and the director of the shipbuilding division of the Hamburg-America-Line.\n\nFriedrich Wilhelm Foerster studied philosophy, economics, ethics and sociology in Freiburg im Breisgau and Berlin. His doctoral thesis was completed in 1893 under the title \"Der Entwicklungsgang der Kantischen Ethik bis zur Kritik der reinen Vernunft\" (The development from Kantian ethics to critique of pure reason). From 1898 until 1912 he lectured at the University of Zurich and other Swiss institutions, later lecturing at the University of Vienna and from 1914 at the University of Munich.\n\nFoerster was strongly opposed to the German foreign policy in the era of the First World War, particularly the militaristic attitudes of the ruling elite in Germany. These views made him an exception to the prevailing nationalist tendencies in the German Empire, and due to this and his ethical views he was regularly attacked from nationalist circles.\n\nHis criticism of the political legacy of Otto von Bismarck during the war caused a great scandal at his university, and he was dismissed from his post for two semesters. During this time, he returned to Switzerland, where he focused his efforts on the question of to what extent Germany was responsible for the First World War. Foerster became convinced that Germany had blocked the success of the Hague Conventions in 1907, and had thereby isolated itself internationally and drawn a course for war.\n\nWhen Foerster returned from Switzerland in 1917, he remained convinced that responsibility for the World War lay with the ruling elite in Germany, and particularly with the leaders of the military. His views made him highly unpopular with the conservative factions of German society and he became seen as a key enemy by the newly created national socialist movement.\n\nIn 1920 he published his book, \"Mein Kampf gegen das militaristische und nationalistische Deutschland\" (My struggle against the militaristic and nationalistic Germany). Following this, he received numerous death threats from right-wing radicals. After Matthias Erzberger and later Walther Rathenau were murdered, Foerster was warned to seek refuge. In 1922 he resigned from his teaching position and fled to Switzerland, later settling in France in 1926. As Foerster continued from a distance to warn against growing German nationalism and the rise of national socialism, he became seen by the Nazis as a major intellectual enemy. After the Nazis seized power in 1933, Foersters works were among those publicly burnt in ritualised book burnings held across Germany. At the book burning in Berlin on May 10, 1933, the prescribed \"fire speech\" consigned Foerster's writings to the flames with the words \"Gegen Gesinnungslumperei und politischen Verrat\" (Against immoral opportunism and political betrayal). Foerster was on the first list of those whose German citizenship was to be revoked, signed on 23. August 1933 by the Reichminister for the interior.\n\nFoerster was well-respected in France and received French citizenship. However, after the occupation of France by the Wehrmacht in 1940, Foerster was immediately wanted by the Gestapo. Foerster, who had been living close to the Swiss border in case of this occurrence, fled to Switzerland. The Swiss authorities however refused him asylum, even doubting the legitimacy of his French citizenship and explaining that they considered him to remain a German national. He managed to then flee to Portugal and onwards to the United States.\n\nShortly after the end of the Second World War, Foerster wrote an article in the \"Neue Zürcher Zeitung\" in which he warned of a \"Prussianisation\" of the entire world, if the Germans didn't come to \"recognition of their horrible guilt\" for the crimes committed during the Nazi era and make amends by contributing to the rebuilding of \"the noble values of humanity\". His memoirs appeared in 1953 under the title \"Erlebte Weltgeschichte, 1869-1953\" (Experienced World History, 1869-1953).\n\nHe lived until 1963 in New York City, before returning to Switzerland to spend the last few years of his life in Kilchberg near Zurich.\n\n"}

He was born in Kielce, Poland (Russian Empire), and died at the Borovoye Resort in northern Kazakhstan.\n\nStcherbatsky studied in the famous Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum (graduating in 1884), and later in the Historico-Philological Faculty of Saint Petersburg University (graduating in 1889), where Ivan Minayeff and Serge Oldenburg were his teachers. Subsequently, sent abroad, he studied Indian poetry with Georg Bühler in Vienna, and Buddhist philosophy with Hermann Jacobi in Bonn. In 1897, he and Oldenburg inaugurated \"Bibliotheca Buddhica\", a library of rare Buddhist texts.\n\nReturning from a trip to India and Mongolia, in 1903 Stcherbatsky published (in Russian) the first volume of \"Theory of Knowledge and Logic of the Doctrine of Later Buddhists\" ( 2 vols., St. Petersburg, 1903-1909 ). In 1928 he established the Institute of Buddhist Culture in Leningrad. His \"The Conception of Buddhist Nirvana\" (Leningrad, 1927), written in English, caused a sensation in the West. He followed suit with his main work in English, \"Buddhist Logic\" (2 vols., 1930–32), which has exerted an immense influence on Buddhology.\n\nAlthough Stcherbatsky remained less well known in his own country, his extraordinary fluency in Sanskrit and Tibetan languages won him the admiration of Jawaharlal Nehru and Rabindranath Tagore. According to Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya, \"Stcherbatsky did help us – the Indians – to discover our own past and to restore the right perspective of our own philosophical heritage.\" The Encyclopædia Britannica (2004 edition) acclaimed Stcherbatsky as \"the foremost Western authority on Buddhist philosophy\".\n\n\n"}

Throughout his career, he has won numerous awards, such as the Killam Prize for the Humanities and the Balzan Prize, and been a member of many prestigious groups, including the Order of Canada, the Royal Society of Canada and the British Academy.\n\nBorn in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, he earned undergraduate degrees from the University of British Columbia (1956) and the University of Cambridge (1958), where he was a student at Trinity College, Cambridge. Hacking also earned his PhD at Cambridge (1962), under the direction of Casimir Lewy, a former student of Ludwig Wittgenstein.\n\nHe started his teaching career as an instructor at Princeton University in 1960 but, after just one year, moved to the University of Virginia as an assistant professor. After working as a research fellow at Cambridge from 1962 to 1964, he taught at his alma mater, UBC, first as an assistant professor and later as an associate professor from 1964 to 1969. He became a lecturer at Cambridge in 1969 before shifting to Stanford University in 1974. After teaching for several years at Stanford, he spent a year at the Center for Interdisciplinary Research in Bielefeld, Germany, from 1982 to 1983. Hacking was promoted to Professor of Philosophy at the University of Toronto in 1983 and University Professor, the highest honour the University of Toronto bestows on faculty, in 1991. From 2000 to 2006, he held the Chair of Philosophy and History of Scientific Concepts at the Collège de France. Hacking is the first Anglophone to be elected to a permanent chair in the Collège's history. After retiring from the Collège de France, Hacking was a Professor of Philosophy at UC Santa Cruz, from 2008 to 2010. He concluded his teaching career in 2011 as a visiting professor at the University of Cape Town and currently spends his days tending to his inner-city garden in Toronto with his wife, Judith Baker.\n\nInfluenced by debates involving Thomas Kuhn, Imre Lakatos, Paul Feyerabend and others, Hacking is known for bringing a historical approach to the philosophy of science. The fourth edition (2010) of Feyerabend's 1975 book \"Against Method,\" and the 50th anniversary edition (2012) of Kuhn's \"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\" include an Introduction by Hacking. He is sometimes described as a member of the \"Stanford School\" in philosophy of science, a group that also included John Dupré, Nancy Cartwright and Peter Galison. Hacking himself still identifies as a Cambridge analytic philosopher. Hacking has been a main proponent of a realism about science called \"entity realism.\" This form of realism encourages a realistic stance towards answers to the scientific unknowns hypothesized by mature sciences, but skepticism towards scientific theories. Hacking has also been influential in directing attention to the experimental and even engineering practices of science, and their relative autonomy from theory. Because of this, Hacking moved philosophical thinking a step further than the initial historical, but heavily theory-focused, turn of Kuhn and others.\n\nAfter 1990, Hacking shifted his focus somewhat from the natural sciences to the human sciences, partly under the influence of the work of Michel Foucault. Foucault was an influence as early as 1975 when Hacking wrote \"Why Does Language Matter to Philosophy?\" and \"The Emergence of Probability\". In the latter book, Hacking proposed that the modern schism between subjective or personalistic probability, and the long-run frequency interpretation, emerged in the early modern era as an epistemological \"break\" involving two incompatible models of uncertainty and chance. As history, the idea of a sharp break has been criticized, but competing 'frequentist' and 'subjective' interpretations of probability still remain today. Foucault's approach to knowledge systems and power is also reflected in Hacking's work on the historical mutability of psychiatric disorders and institutional roles for statistical reasoning in the 19th century. He labels his approach to the human sciences transcendental nominalism (also dynamic nominalism or dialectical realism), a historicised form of nominalism that traces the mutual interactions over time between the phenomena of the human world and our conceptions and classifications of them.\n\nIn \"\", by developing a historical ontology of multiple personality disorder, Hacking provides a discussion of how people are constituted by the descriptions of acts available to them (see Acting under a description).\n\nIn \"\" (1998) Hacking provided a historical account of the effects of a medical condition known as fugue in the late 1890s. Fugue, also known as \"mad travel,\" is a diagnosable type of insanity in which European men would walk in a trance for hundreds of miles without knowledge of their identities.\n\nIn 2002, Hacking was awarded the first Killam Prize for the Humanities, Canada's most distinguished award for outstanding career achievements. He was made a Companion of the Order of Canada in 2004. Hacking was appointed visiting professor at University of California, Santa Cruz for the Winters of 2008 and 2009. On August 25, 2009, Hacking was named winner of the Holberg International Memorial Prize, a Norwegian award for scholarly work in the arts and humanities, social sciences, law and theology. Hacking was chosen for his work on how statistics and the theory of probability have shaped society.\n\nIn 2003, he gave The Sigmund H. Danziger, Jr. Memorial Lecture in the Humanities, and in 2010 he gave the René Descartes Lectures at the Tilburg Center for Logic and Philosophy of Science (TiLPS).007. Hacking also gave the Howison lectures at the University of California, Berkeley, on the topic of mathematics and its sources in human behavior ('Proof, Truth, Hands and Mind') in 2010. In 2012, Hacking was awarded the Austrian Decoration for Science and Art, and in 2014 he was awarded the Balzan Prize.\n\nHacking's works have been translated into several languages.

Without knowing them one cannot progress towards liberation. They are:\n\n\nEach one of these fundamental principles are discussed and explained by Jain Scholars in depth. There are two examples that can be used to explain the above principle intuitively.\n\n(1) A man rides a wooden boat to reach the other side of the river. Now the man is Jiva, the boat is ajiva. Now the boat has a leak and water flows in. That incoming of water is Asrava and accumulating there is Bandh, Now the man tries to save the boat by blocking the hole. That blockage is \"Samvara\" and throwing the water outside is Nirjara. Now the man crosses the river and reaches his destination, Moksha.\n\nNine substances are explained as:\nConsider a family living in a house. One day, they were enjoying a fresh cool breeze coming through their open doors and windows of the house. However, the weather suddenly changed to a terrible dust storm. The family, realizing the storm, closed the doors and windows. But, by the time they could close all the doors and windows some of the dust had been blown into the house. After closing the doors and the windows, they started clearing the dust that had come in to make the house clean again.\n\nThis simple scenario can be interpreted as follows:\n\n1) Jivas are represented by the living people.\n2) Ajiva is represented by the house.\n3) Punya is represented by enjoyment resulting from the nice cool\nbreeze.\n4) Pap is represented by discomfort resulting from the storm.\n5) Asrava is represented by the influx of dust.\n6) Bandh is represented by the accumulation of dust in the house.\n7) Samvara is represented by the closing of the doors and windows to stop the accumulation of dust.\n8) Nirjara is represented by the cleaning up of already collected dust from the house.\n9) Moksha is represented by the cleaned house, which is similar to the shedding off all karmic particles from the soul.\n\nThere are five classes of beings:\n\nOne-sensed beings (Ekendriya Jiva) have:\n\nTwo-sensed beings (Beindriya Jiva) have:\n\nThree-sensed beings (Trindriya Jiva) have:\n\nFour-sensed beings (Caturendriya Jiva) have:\n\nFive-sensed beings (Pañcendriya Jiva) have:\n\nThere are two sub-categories among the five-sensed beings:\nSanjñi - With mind;\nAsanjñi - Without mind\n\nA \"prana\" (vitalities) is the inherent ability of a jiva to perform a certain act.

He is one of the most prominent advocates of legal positivism and is well known for his conception of perfectionist liberalism. Raz spent most of his career as a professor of philosophy of law at the University of Oxford associated with Balliol College, and is now a part-time professor of law at Columbia University Law School and a part-time professor at King's College London. He received the prestigious Tang Prize for rule of law in 2018.\n\nBorn in Mandate Palestine in 1939, Joseph Raz graduated in 1963 from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem with a Magister Juris (\"summa cum laude\"). Later, with funds provided by the Hebrew University, Raz pursued a Doctor of Philosophy at the University of Oxford under the supervision of H. L. A. Hart. Raz had met Hart earlier at a conference in Israel, impressing him by pointing out a flaw in his reasoning that had previously eluded him; Hart encouraged him to go to Oxford for further study. Raz studied at Balliol College and completed his DPhil in 1967.\n\nHe then returned to Israel to teach at the Hebrew University as a lecturer in the Faculty of Law and Department of Philosophy. In 1971, he was tenured and promoted to Senior Lecturer. In 1972, he returned to Balliol as a Fellow and Tutor in Law, becoming a Professor of Philosophy of Law, Oxford University, from 1985 to 2006, and then a Research Professor from 2006 to 2009. Since 2002 he has also been a Professor in the Law School at Columbia University. Raz, now retired from Oxford, is currently also a visiting professor of law at King's College London.\n\nA pupil of H. L. A. Hart, Raz has been important in continuing the development of legal positivism both before and since Hart's death. Raz was also co-editor of a second edition of Hart's \"The Concept of Law\" with a postscript including Hart's responses to other philosophers' criticisms of his work.\n\nRaz's first book, \"The Concept of a Legal System\", was based on his doctoral thesis. A later book, \"The Morality of Freedom\" won two prizes: the 1987 W.J.M. Mackenzie Book Prize from the Political Studies Association of the United Kingdom, awarded to the best book in political science each calendar year; and the 1988 Elaine and David Spitz Book Prize from the Conference for the Study of Political Thought, New York, awarded annually for the best book in liberal and/or democratic theory that had been published two years earlier. The book develops a conception of perfectionist liberalism.\n\nRaz has argued for a distinctive understanding of legal commands as exclusionary reasons for action and for the \"service conception\" of authority, according to which those subject to an authority \"can benefit by its decisions only if they can establish their existence and content in ways which do not depend on raising the very same issues which the authority is there to settle.\" This, in turn, supports Raz's argument for legal positivism, in particular \"the sources thesis,\" \"the idea that an adequate test for the existence and content of law must be based only on social facts, and not on moral arguments.\".\n\nRaz is acknowledged by his contemporaries as being one of the most important living legal philosophers. He has authored and edited eleven books to date, namely \"The Concept of a Legal System\" (1970), \"Practical Reason and Norms\" (1975), \"The Authority of Law\" (1979), \"The Morality of Freedom\" (1986), \"Authority\" (1990), \"Ethics in the Public Domain\" (1994), \"Engaging Reason\" (1999), \"Value, Respect and Attachment\" (2001), \"The Practice of Value\" (2003), \"Between Authority and Interpretation\" (2009), and \"From Normativity to Responsibility\" (2011). His most recent work deals less with legal theory and more with political philosophy and practical reasoning. In moral theory, Raz defends value pluralism and the idea that various values are incommensurable.\n\nRaz's work has been cited by the Supreme Court of Canada in such cases as \"Imperial Tobacco v. British Columbia\" and \"Sauvé v. Canada (Chief Electoral Officer)\".\n\nSeveral of Raz's students have become important legal and moral philosophers, including the three current Professors in Jurisprudence at Oxford, John Gardner, Leslie Green, and Timothy Endicott.\n\nRaz was elected a Fellow of the British Academy in 1987 and of the American Academy of Arts & Sciences in 1992. He has been awarded Honorary Doctorates by the Catholic University of Brussels, 1993, and by King's College London, 2009. In 2005 he received the International Prize for Legal Research 'Hector Fix-Zamudio' from the National Autonomous University of Mexico, and in 2009 a Vice-Presidency Award from the Law Society of University College Dublin. In 2018 he received the Tang Prize.\n\nIn 2000–2001, he gave the Tanner Lectures on Human Values on \"The Practice of Value\" at the University of California Berkeley.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "230141", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=230141", "title": "Karl Daub", "text": "Karl Daub\n\nKarl Daub (20 March 176522 November 1836) was a German Protestant theologian.\n\nHe was born at Kassel. He studied philosophy, philology and theology at Marburg in 1786, and eventually (1795) became professor ordinarius of theology at the University of Heidelberg, where he remained until his death. He became rector of the university in 1816 and 1824. He was married in 1801 to Sophie Wilhelmine Charlotte Blum.\n\nDaub was one of the leaders of a school which sought to reconcile theology and philosophy, and to bring about a speculative reconstruction of orthodox dogma. In the course of his intellectual development, he came successively under the influence of Immanuel Kant, Friedrich von Schelling and G. W. F. Hegel, and on account of the different phases through which he passed he was called the Talleyrand of German thought. There was one great defect in his speculative theology: he ignored historical criticism. His purpose was, as Otto Pfleiderer says,\n\n\"to connect the metaphysical ideas, which had been arrived at by means of philosophical dialectic, directly with the persons and events of the Gospel narratives, thus raising these above the region of ordinary experience into that of the supernatural, and regarding the most absurd assertions as philosophically justified. Daub had become so hopelessly addicted to this perverse principle that he deduced not only Jesus as the embodiment of the philosophical idea of the union of God and man, but also Judas Iscariot as the embodiment of the idea of a rival god, or Satan.\"\nThe three stages in Daub's development are clearly marked in his writings. His \"Lehrbuch der Katechetik\" (1801) was written under the spell of Kant. His \"Theologumena\" (1806), his \"Einleitung in das Studium der christlichen Dogmatik\" (1810), and his \"Judas Ischarioth\" (2 vols., 1816, 2nd ed., 1818), were all written in the spirit of Schelling, the last of them reflecting a change in Schelling himself from theosophy to positive philosophy. Daub's \"Die dogmatische Theologie jetziger Zeit oder die Selbstsucht in der Wissenschaft des Glaubens\" (1833), and \"Vorlesungen über die Prolegomena zur Dogmatik\" (1839), are Hegelian in principle and obscure in language.\n\nHe died in Heidelberg.\n\nSøren Kierkegaard is notable among those who were prominently influenced by Daub's thought. In \"From the Papers of One Still Living\", Kierkegaard wrote:\n\nThere must come a moment, I say, when as Daub observes, life is understood backward through the idea…\nSome years later, Kierkegaard expanded on this idea in his journal, in a passage that is often quoted or paraphrased:\n\nPhilosophy is perfectly right in saying that life must be understood backwards. But then one forgets the other claim – that it must be lived forwards.\n\n"}
{"id": "52906318", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52906318", "title": "Knowledge regime", "text": "Knowledge regime\n\nA knowledge regime is a type of system involving a specific set of actors, organizations, and institutions that create policy ideas used to alter the organization and overall operation of the policy-making and production process. Knowledge regimes are beneficial for the implementation of public policy because they introduce new sets of data, research, theories, recommendations, and many other influential ideas directed towards an end goal of economic competition.\n\nThese regimes became increasingly important following WWII when many capitalist societies were facing long periods of high inflation and economic stagnation associated with high levels of unemployment. Following this era, knowledge regimes were used in the study of comparative political economies, which examined both policymaking regimes as well as production regimes. The information and policies that arises from knowledge regimes differs depending on the political economy that a state operates in.\n\nIn a liberal market economy (LME) with a decentralized, open market, the knowledge regimes tend to be more market-oriented, meaning there are less external constraints from the government. In open markets there is more competition between companies and actors, resulting in a more adversarial environment. In an LME with a more centralized and closed market, there is nonpartisan state-involvement, all the while in a hostile environment. In coordinated market economies (CME) with decentralized, open states, there are strong associational institutional arrangements, which results in more consensus-oriented knowledge regimes whereas in a CME with a centralized closed market, policy changes come from within the state.\n\nDepending on the political economy of a state, there are four corresponding knowledge-producing organizations. The first organization is composed of scholars who have specific knowledge on a topic; these members tend to be university students and/or professors. Another organization is made up of advocacy research units with individuals who have dedicated their time to one given topic. A third organization includes the individuals closely associated with a political party who conduct research that will provide expert advice and analysis for party members. The last knowledge-producing organization includes state research units who are situated within the government and are readily available for members within the government at any given time.\n\nCapitalist countries began acknowledging the importance of knowledge regimes following the end of the Golden Age; this period was characterized by economic stagflation, eventually leading to inflation throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Economic bubbles and crises occur as a result of the processes that countries previously adapted, typically over the past 30 years, which are ingrained into the economy and hard to alter. The high rates of stagflation that occurred in the mid 1960s after the end of the Golden Age created the questions of what the adequate policies would be in order to pursue macroeconomic goals of long-term economic growth. This era contradicted the traditional Keynesian policy ideas, which led many advanced countries to turn to the use of theories, data, and ideologies as tools in the fight over different economic policies. This placed heavy emphasis on the creation and use of knowledge regimes.\n\nThe end of the Golden Age introduced the era of neoliberalism, characterized by a decrease in public spending, lower taxes, and less state intervention. Through neoliberalism and neoliberal ways of operation, many capitalist countries began globalizing at increased rates, which brought about new forms of economic organizations, such as global outsourcing and international commodity chains. Given this level of globalization, knowledge regimes were developed to create new policies and advise firms on appropriate production measures.\n\nVarieties of capitalism is used to describe is used to describe the way a firm operates in two differentiating political capitalist economies, placing the emphasis on the state-firm relationship rather than the state-citizen relationship. The two political economies that nations will operate in are either liberal market economies (LMEs) or coordinated market economies (CMEs). There are five sectors that firms address when developing relationships with the state, including industrial relations, vocational training and education, corporate governance, inter-firm relations, and employees. Firms use the five sectors to design different policies that are best suited for their political economy.\n\nLiberal market economies operate in capitalist nations that use a system of hierarchy and competitive markets to determine relationships between firms and the state. LMEs operate in highly commodified economies whereby there individuals are particularly dependent on the sale of their own labour as a reliable source of income. The commodification of labour is strongly affected by the price signals that are indicated by the markets, and these fluctuating price levels lead to either an increase or decrease in a firm’s willingness to supply and a customer’s willingness to consume. In liberal market economies, firms will use market mechanisms to solve any issues incurred, specifically through the exchange of money by buyers and sellers, who have a well-rounded understanding of the value of trade-offs so as to ensure the most efficient distribution of goods and services within an economy.\n\nIn a liberal market economy, firms require vocational education and training that is either individually funded or provided through on-the-job training to provide firm-specific education. These firms tend to focus their decisions on publicly accessible data of performance, allowing for greater venture capital and easily switchable assets that result in higher returns for investors. Due to the hierarchical nature of management, there are very few unions created in the work environment as labour is highly commodified and it is easy for a firm to hire and fire employees. The relationships between firms and employees operate on a contract basis. As a result of the individually funded vocational training, there is greater incentive to pursue individual success through innovation, which is generally funded by the larger venture capital opportunities.\n\nLMEs can also operate alternatively, contingent on the type of market a state follows. If an economy has a more decentralized and open market, knowledge regimes will tend to be me more market-oriented with less external constraints from the government, as is the case with United States; if an economy is more centralized with a closed market, there is more state-led involvement and guidance, much like Great Britain.\n\nThe United States of America is a country with a liberal market economy, accentuated by decentralized government with a relatively open market. Through the open market, firms and investors are able to import and export different goods and services with very little interference from the government, allowing for the price levels of those goods and services to be set solely by the supply and demand in the economy.\n\nThe political economy in the United States is run primarily by two political parties, the Republican Party and the Democratic Party. Since the United States is a highly decentralized state, the two main parties operate using privately funded resources, resulting in a distinct separation of power at the legislative and executive branches of government. The United States demonstrates how a decentralized open market economy tends to have more market-oriented knowledge regimes. Through privately funded channels, individuals have a higher incentive to create knowledge regimes in attempt to influence the public policy making process.\n\nGreat Britain represents a group of countries (Wales, Scotland, England) that operate in an LME with a centralized, closed market. These countries follow a unitary system of government, whereby there is a single power dictating the operations of the country as a whole. The market system in Great Britain operates with greater state involvement and control, and the price levels of goods and services are more commonly dictated by government-imposed market tools, such as tariffs, taxes, and subsidies.\n\nThe central authority holds power in both the legislative branch and executive branch of government, allowing the central authority to impose new policies and decisions without opposition from other political parties. As a result, knowledge regimes are publicly-funded and not as common as they are in LMEs with an open market. State research units are more prevalent throughout Great Britain and are embedded throughout the civil society, creating more politically tempered knowledge regimes.\n\nCoordinated market economies (CME) are characterized by very little state involvement with firms focused on building close relationships between individuals in managerial positions and employees. Through the strong relationships created within the firm, there is a highly decommodified environment with a strong sense of social entitlement and separation from market dependency and state participation. When firms incur a problem of any sort, they use strategic interactions to create a feasible solution. These strategic interactions incorporate employees at every level of the firm so as to ensure opinions and viewpoints from all sectors are being taken into account; this typically allows for a stronger built solution. In addition, firms use strategic interaction to determine at which point the equilibrium should be set between the firm and their consumers, which establishes the appropriate combination between how much of a product is supplied and subsequently purchased.\n\nIn a coordinated market economy, there is publicly-subsidized training to support high-skilled education for greater industry-specific labour needs; this is a result of the multilateral decisions that are made through strategic interactions. Additionally, there is greater confidence instilled in potential investors through the promotion of dense networks. Through the structure of the market, there are several unions and long-term worker contracts, which ensures job security and decreases the likelihood of hostile takeovers. Due to the interaction and cooperation throughout multiple firms, there is greater society-wide success through innovative tendencies, such as the green energy industry in Germany.\n\nCMEs operate differently depending on if a state has a closed market or an open market. In a CME with a decentralized and open market, such as Germany, there tends to be strong associational institutional arrangements, producing more consensus-oriented knowledge regimes; a CME with a centralized and closed market, such as France, many policy changes are encouraged and led by state involvement.\n\nGermany is a country with a coordinated market economy, characterized by a decentralized government with an open market system. Firms in this economy operate through well-established networks, while developing and maintaining relationships to promote and coordinate economic activity. There is very little state-involvement throughout the market, with the emphasis and responsibility being placed on the firms and corporations to set and adjust prices accordingly. Germany follows a proportional representation electoral system, creating a stronger consensus-based environment whereby policies are formulated at the regional level of government rather than the federal level.\n\nThrough regional-based policy formulation tactics, there is a higher rate of scholarly research units affiliated with several different universities, churches, and other knowledge-producing institutions. There is also a stronger incentive for political parties to create their own party research units to be used for future elections and policy-making tactics. The knowledge regimes created throughout Germany represent the institutional tendencies that firms rely on, such as the negotiation among different political parties, problem-solving mediation, and general consensus building.\n\nFrance is a country with a coordinated market economy, distinguished by a central government and a closed market. In France, the central government is the main actor when making economic decisions and solving financial problems; the government holds sole ownership of several of the main infrastructure sectors throughout the country, weakening state-firm relationships. With a central government, the same political party holds control of both the legislative and executive branches, resulting in much of policy making taking place at the national level.\n\nAs a result of the highly centralized state, many of the knowledge regimes throughout France emerge from state-led research units, as individuals are given very few incentives or means to create or pursue their own research units. Other knowledge regimes emerge from scholarly research units that are funded through the central government.\n\nKnowledge regimes are organized in different ways depending on the type of political economy they are operating in. There are 4 common knowledge producing organizations, which correspond to either liberal market economies or coordinated market economies. These knowledge producing organizations also differentiate if a country has either a centralized or decentralized government, or if there is an open or closed market.\n\nAcademic research units are made up of academia from many institutions. The most commonly found participants in these units are students and professors, however many firms with a coordinated market economy send their employees to these research units. These units are often publicly funded through the government, although they may be privately funded as well, and tend to be both politically and ideologically impartial. Academic research units are most common in liberal market economies with a decentralized government and open market. Prior to WWII, many of these research units were privately funded through philanthropic organizations, but following WWII, many governments began providing funding for academic research units by contracting out for policy research.\n\nAdvocacy research units are created by individuals who are independently motivated through their own values and morals. These research units are privately funded through organizations that directly correlate to the topic or issue being addressed through the unit. These research units are both politically and ideologically partisan in nature, and are more focused on discrediting research that has already been done by using the media to persuade politicians to alter certain policies. Advocacy research units are most common in political economies with decentralized states and open markets, as politicians are less likely to conform to political party standards and will seek advice through external resources.\n\nParty research units are independently funded research units on behalf of a specific political party. These units are both politically and ideologically biased towards the values of a political party, composed of individuals who conduct research on behalf of the leaders. Political leaders will use the research from these units to pursue designated policy goals that will generate as much public approval and support as possible. These research units are most common in economies that operate through highly decentralized governments with several different political parties running for office during an election.\n\nState-led research units are the only form of research unit that does not directly involve the participation of the civil society when conducting research. These units are closely affiliated with specific government departments and ministries that conduct research on a very specific matter that is then reported back to the central authority. These research units operate in economies with centralized and closed markets and are publicly funded through the central government.\n"}

{"id": "337115", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=337115", "title": "Korean Confucianism", "text": "Korean Confucianism\n\nKorean Confucianism is the form of Confucianism that emerged and developed in Korea. One of the most substantial influences in Korean intellectual history was the introduction of Confucian thought as part of the cultural influence from China. Today the legacy of Confucianism remains a fundamental part of Korean society, shaping the moral system, the way of life, social relations between old and young, high culture, and is the basis for much of the legal system. Confucianism in Korea is sometimes considered a pragmatic way of holding a nation together without the civil wars and internal dissent that were inherited from the Goryeo dynasty.\n\nConfucius (孔夫子 \"Kǒng Fūzǐ\", lit. \"Master Kong\") is generally thought to have been born in 551 BCE and raised by his mother following the death of his father when Confucius was three years old. The Latinized name \"Confucius\" by which most Westerners recognize him is derived from \"Kong Fuzi\", probably first coined by 16th-century Jesuit missionaries to China. The Analects, or \"Lunyu\" (論語; lit.\"Selected Sayings\"), a collection of sayings and ideas attributed to the Chinese philosopher and his contemporaries, is believed to have been written by Confucius' followers during the Warring States period (475 BC – 221 BC), achieving its final form during the Han dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD). Confucius was born into the class of \"shi\" (士), between the aristocracy and the common people. His public life included marriage at the age of 19 that produced a son and a variety of occupations as a farm worker, clerk and book-keeper. In his private life he studied and reflected on righteousness, proper conduct and the nature of government such that by the age of 50 he had established a reputation. This regard, however was insufficient for his success in advocating for a strong central government and the use of diplomacy over warfare as the ideal for international relationships. He is said to have spent his last years teaching an ardent group of followers of the values to be appreciated in a collection of ancient writings loosely identified as the Five Classics. Confucius is thought to have died in 479 BCE.\n\nUnder the succeeding Han Dynasty and Tang Dynasty, Confucian ideas gained even more widespread prominence. During the Song Dynasty, the scholar Zhu Xi (AD 1130–1200) added ideas from Taoism and Buddhism into Confucianism. In his life, Zhu Xi was largely ignored, but not long after his death his ideas became the new orthodox view of what Confucian texts actually meant. Modern historians view Zhu Xi as having created something rather different, and call his way of thinking Neo-Confucianism. Neo-Confucianism held sway in China, Japan, Korea and Vietnam until the 19th century.\n\nThe nature of early Korean political and cultural organization centered on the clan and the tribe rather than cities and states. A Chinese record of the Gojoseon Kingdom (1000 BC – 300 BC) labeled the inhabitants of the peninsula as DONG-I or \"eastern barbarians\" or \"eastern bowmen\". Though the Shang Dynasty (1766 BC – 1040 BC) is recognized chiefly for its metallurgical accomplishments, its organizational accomplishments included the invocation of authority through one's ancestors. When the Shang Dynasty was overtaken by the Western Zhou (1122 BC – 771 BC), the Zhou modified the Shang belief in ancestors belief to invoke the \"Mandate of Heaven\" as a way of identifying the divine right to rule. The Mandate of Heaven was based on rules of good governance and the emperor was granted the right to rule by heaven as long as those rules of good governance were obeyed. The scattered rule of many semi-autonomous holdings were increasingly brought under the rule of a central government as a Zongfa or \"kinship network\" though as time went on the territory ruled was far too large for all vassals to be actual blood relatives. Vassals to the king enjoyed hereditary titles and were expected to provide labor and fighting forces as circumstances merited. In these many ways, the Gojoseon kingdom would have been “validated” by their “big brother” to the south, and while the Gojoseon king would still rule, the “Mandate of Heaven” lay obligations on him to rule justly and fairly and for the benefit of his people and not just his favorites or relatives. As the Western Zhou declined, China entered into a period known as the Spring and Autumn period (771 BC – 471BC) and the \"kinship network\" also declined. Control of many feudal holdings fell to feudal lords and knights, or \"fighting gentlemen\", (C. SHI). Unbound by family relationships, these men were free to attack their neighbors and accrue holdings. It was into this period, then, that Confucius was born and spent his entire life seeming to strive for the construction of a governmental ideal in the nature of the Zhou centralized government. However, in 109 BC the Han Emperor, Wu-Ti overwhelmed Gojoseon by both land and sea and established four bases, or \"commanderies\", Four Commanderies of Han in the region as a way to stabilize the area for trade. The subsequent introduction of four separate administrations to oversee the region only served to prolong the divided nature of the Korean peninsula and hamper an adoption of the Confucian model.\n\nAs the Three Kingdoms Period emerged from the Four Commanderies, each Kingdom sought ideologies under which their populations could be consolidated and authority could be validated. From its introduction to the kingdom of Baekje in 338 AD, Korean Buddhism spread rapidly to all of the states of the Three Kingdoms Period. Though Korean Shamanism had been an integral part of Korean culture extending back to earliest time, Buddhism was able to strike a balance between the people and their administration by arbitrating the responsibilities of one to the other.\n\nBy the time of the Goryeo Dynasty (918–1392) the position, influence, and status of Buddhism far exceeded its role as a mere religious faith. Buddhist temples, originally established as acts of faith had grown into influential landholdings replete with extensive infra-structure, cadre, tenants, slaves and commercial ventures. The state observed a number of Buddhist holidays during the year where the prosperity and security of the nation were inextricably tied to practices and rites that often mixed Buddhist and indigenous Korean beliefs. As in China, Buddhism divided into the more urban faith rooted religious texts and the more contemplative faith of the rural areas. This emphasis on texts and learning produced a \"monk examination\" wherein the Buddhist clergy could vie with Confucian scholars for positions in the local and national government. During this time, Confucian thought remained in the shadow of its Buddhist rival, vying for the hearts and minds of Korean culture, but with growing antagonism.\n\nWith the fall of Goryeo, the position of the landed aristocracy crumbled to be replaced by the growing power of the Korean illiterati who advocated strenuously for land reform. Interest in Chinese literature during the Goryeo Dynasty had encouraged the spread of Neo-Confucianism, in which the older teachings of Confucius had been melded to Taoism and Buddhism. Neo-Confucian adherents could now offer the new Joseon Dynasty (1392–1910) an alternative to the influence of Buddhism. In Goryeo, King Gwangjong (949–975) had created the national civil service examinations, and King Seongjong (1083–1094) was a key advocate for Confucianism by establishing the Gukjagam, the highest educational institution of the Goryeo dynasty. This was enhanced, in 1398, by the Sunggyungwan – an academy with a Neo-Confucian curriculum – and the building of an altar at the palace, where the king would worship his ancestors. Neo-Confucian thought, with its emphasis on Ethics and the government's moral authority provided considerable rationale for land reform and redistribution of wealth. Rather than attack Buddhism outright, Neo-Confucian critics simply continued to criticize the system of Temples and the excesses of the clergy.\n\nBy the time of King Sejong (ruled 1418–1450), all branches of learning were rooted in Confucian thought. Korean Confucian schools were firmly established, most with foreign educated scholars, large libraries, patronage of artisans and artists, and a curriculum of 13 to 15 major Confucian works. Branches of Buddhism in Korea were still tolerated outside of the major political centers. In Ming China (1368–1644), Neo-Confucianism had been adopted as the state ideology. The new Joseon Dynasty (1392–1910) followed suit and also adopted Neo-Confucianism as the primary belief system among scholars and administrators. Jo Gwang-jo's efforts to promulgate Neo-Confucianism among the populace had been followed by appearance of Korea's two most prominent Confucian scholars, Yi Hwang (1501–1570) and Yi I (1536–1584), who are often referred to by their pen names \"Toe gye\" and \"Yul gok\". Having supplanted all other models for the Korean nation-state, by the start of the 17th century, Neo-Confucian thought experienced first a split between Westerners and Easterners and again, between Southerners and Northerners. Central to these divisions was the question of succession in the Korean monarchy and the manner in which opposing factions should be dealt. A growing number of Neo-Confucian scholars had also begun to question particular metaphysical beliefs and practices. A movement known as Silhak (lit. \"practical learning\") posited that Neo-Confucian thought ought be founded more in reform than in maintaining the status quo. Differences among various Confucian and Neo-Confucian schools of thought grew to conflicts as Western countries sought to force open Korean, Chinese and Japanese societies to Western trade, Western technologies and Western institutions. Of particular concern were the growing number of Catholic and Protestant missionary schools which not only taught a Western pedagogy but also Christian religious beliefs. In 1894, Korean Conservatives, nationalists and Neo-Confucians rebelled at what they viewed as the loss of Korean Society and Culture to alien influences by the abandonment of the Chinese classics and Confucian rites. The Dong Hak Rebellion—also called the 1894 Peasant War (Nongmin Jeonjaeng)—expanded on the actions of the small groups of the Donghak (lit. Eastern Learning) movement begun in 1892. Uniting into a single peasant guerrilla army (Donghak Peasant Army) the rebels armed themselves, raided government offices and killed rich landlords, traders and foreigners. The defeat of the Dong Hak rebels drove ardent Neo-Confucians out of the cities and into the rural and isolated areas of the country. However, the rebellion had pulled China into the conflict and in direct contention with Japan (First Sino-Japanese War). With the subsequent defeat of Qing China, Korea was wrested from Chinese influence concerning its administration and development. In 1904, the Japanese defeated Russia (Russo-Japanese War) ending Russian influence in Korea as well. As a result, Japan annexed Korea as a protectorate in 1910, ending the Joseon kingdom and producing a thirty-year occupation (Korea under Japanese rule) which sought to substitute Japanese culture for that of Korea. During this period, a Japanese administration imposed Japanese language, Japanese education, Japanese practices and even Japanese surnames on the Korean population predominantly in the large cities and surrounding suburban areas. However, in the isolated areas of Korea, and well into Manchuria, Korean nationals continued to wage a guerrilla war against the Japanese and found sympathy for Neo-Confucian goals of reform and economic parity among the growing Communist movement. With the end of the Japanese occupation, Confucian and Neo-Confucian thought continued to experience neglect if not willful repression during the Korean War as well as the repressive dictatorships which followed.\n\nWith the fall of the Joseon Dynasty in 1910, Neo-Confucianism lost a lot of its influence. In contemporary South Korea, very few people identify themselves as being Confucian when asked for their religious affiliation. The statistical studies done on this subject can be misleading, however. Confucianism there is not an organized religion, making it hard to easily define a person as Confucian or not. Though its prominence as the dominant ideology has faded, there are a lot of Confucian ideas and practices that still saturate South Korean culture and daily life.\n\nThe traditional Confucian respect for education remains a vital part of South Korean culture. The civil service examinations were the gateway to prestige and power for a follower of Confucianism in the Joseon Dynasty. Today, exams continue to be an important aspect of South Korean life. The content of what is studied has changed over the years. Confucian teachings were replaced by other topics, such as foreign languages, modern history, economics, science, and mathematics. Like Confucianism from the past, a lot of emphasis is placed on the ability to study and memorize. Since exams are so important for gaining admission to better schools and jobs, a typical student’s entire life is oriented toward preparing to pass the necessary exams.\n\nPerhaps some of the strongest evidences of continuing Confucian influence can be found in South Korean family life. It is seen not just in South Korea’s emphasis on family and group-oriented ways of living, but also in the Confucian rituals that are still commonly performed today, the ancestor memorial services. It is a way of showing respect for deceased parents, grandparents, and ancestors, and is a way of showing Confucian filial piety. In some cases, the memorial services have been changed to fit with religious views. This is an example of how Confucianism has melded with religion in South Korea, rather than competing against it.\n\nIn 1980, the “Guideline for Family Rituals” was made law. It declared that ancestral ceremonies can only be held for one’s parents and grandparents, simplified the funeral ceremonies, and reduced the allowed mourning period. The law is not strictly enforced, and no one has been charged for violating it.\n\nIn more recent years, there has been a move away from the traditional Confucian idea of complete respect for and submission to parental authority. It can be seen in how marriage has become less of a family decision, and more of an individual’s choice.\n\nThe Confucian emphasis on the importance of the family and the group over the individual has been extended to South Korean business, as well. Employees are expected to regard the workplace as a family, with the head of the company as the patriarch who enjoys exclusive privileges while the workers are expected to work harder. The businesses tend to operate on Confucian ethics, such as the importance of harmonious relations among the employees and loyalty to the company. Importance is placed on attributes such as differences in age, kinship status, sex, and sociopolitical status.\n\nConfucian ethical rhetoric is still used in contemporary South Korea. Other religions will incorporate it into discussions on proper human behavior. It can be found in the government and in the business world being used to encourage people to put the needs of the group above their own individual needs.\n\nNeo-Confucian philosophy going back to the 15th Century had relegated Korean women to little more than extensions of male dominance and producers of requisite progeny. This traditional view of the social role of women is fading away. There is an increasing amount of women students holding good positions in universities and the work force, as well as in politics. The former president of South Korea, Park Geun-hye, is female.\n\nThe arts still maintain major traditions: Korean Pottery, the Korean Tea Ceremony, Korean Gardens, and Korean flower arrangement follow Confucian principles and a Confucian aesthetic. Scholarly calligraphy and poetry also continue, in much fewer numbers, this heritage. In films, school stories of manners and comic situations within educational frames fit well into the satires on Confucianism from earlier writings. Loyalty to school and devotion to teachers is still an important genre in popular comedies.\n\nWith Neo-Confucianism taken out of the school curricula and removed from its prominence in the daily life of Koreans, the sense that something essential to Korean history is missing led to a rebirth of Confucianism in South Korea in the late 1990s.\n\nIt is difficult to find accurate information regarding Confucianism in North Korean religion or practices. However, the Juche ideology does encourage the Confucian virtues of loyalty, reverence, and obedience.\n\nKorean Confucian art and philosophy had great and deep effects on the Korean culture.\n\n\n\n"}

The Baden government in 1853 laid an embargo on his teaching owing to his liberal ideas, but the effect of this was to rouse considerable sympathy for his views, and in 1856 he obtained a professorship at Jena, where he soon acquired great influence by the dignity of his personal character. In 1872, on Eduard Zeller's move to Berlin, Fischer succeeded him as professor of philosophy and the history of modern German literature at Heidelberg.\n\nHe was a brilliant lecturer and possessed a remarkable gift for clear exposition. His fame rests primarily on his work as a historian and commentator of philosophy. As far as his philosophical views were concerned, he was, generally speaking, a follower of the Hegelian school. His writings in this direction, especially his interpretation of Kant, involved him in a quarrel with F. A. Trendelenburg, professor of philosophy at the University of Berlin, and his followers. In 1860, Fischer's \"Kants Leben und die Grundlagen seiner Lehre\" (Kant's life and the foundations of his doctrine) lent the first real impulse to the so-called “return to Kant.”\n\nIn honor of his 80th birthday, celebrated in 1904, Otto Liebmann, Wilhelm Wundt, Theodor Lipps and others published \"Die Philosophie im Beginn des 20. Jahrhunderts. Festschrift für Kuno Fischer\" (Heidelberg, 1907).\n\nOne of Fischer's most significant and lasting contributions to philosophy was the use of the empiricism/rationalism distinction in categorising philosophers, particularly those of the 17th and 18th centuries. These include John Locke, George Berkeley and David Hume in the empiricist category and René Descartes, Baruch Spinoza and G.W. Leibniz in the rationalist category. Empiricism, it is said, claims that human knowledge is derived from sensation, i.e. experience, while rationalism claims that certain knowledge can be acquired before experience through pure principles. Although influential, in more recent times this distinction has been questioned as anachronistic in its failure to represent precisely the exact claims and methodologies of the philosophers it categorises.\n\nKuno Fischer's \"History of Modern Philosophy\" had a strong impact on Friedrich Nietzsche and his view on modern philosophy, particularly on Spinoza. Frege and W. Somerset Maugham were amongst his students.\n\nHermann Weyl, writing about pre-WWII academic life in Germany, told the following anecdote about Fischer:\n\n\nOther translations of his works are:\n\n\n\n"}

A theory that could correlate brain phenomena with psychological phenomena would \"bridge the gap.\" The term is named after Gottfried Leibniz who first presented the problem in his work \"The Monadology\" in 1714. Leibniz's passage describing the gap goes as follows:\n\nLeibniz himself sought to bridge the gap by introducing monads to explain the existence of immaterial, eternal souls. Leibniz's gap, however, applies to materialism and dualism alike. This brought late 19th century scientists to conclude that psychology must build on introspection; thus introspectionism was born. Computationalism seeks to answer the problem proposed by Leibniz's gap through functional analysis of the brain and its processes. Today the term Leibniz's gap is still in wide use in scientific debate as the mind body problem remains unsolved.\n\n"}

{"id": "5611943", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5611943", "title": "Panagiotis Kondylis", "text": "Panagiotis Kondylis\n\nPanagiotis Kondylis (; ; 17 August 1943 – 11 July 1998) was a Greek philosopher, intellectual historian, translator and publications manager who principally wrote in German, in addition to translating most of his work into Greek. He can be placed in a tradition of thought best exemplified by Thucydides, Niccolò Machiavelli and Max Weber.\n\nKondylis produced a body of work that referred directly to primary sources in no less than six languages (Greek, Latin, German, French, Italian and English), and had little regard for what he considered intellectual fashions and bombastic language used to camouflage logical inconsistencies and lack of first-hand knowledge of primary sources.\n\nBorn in 1943 in the small community of Drouva (Δρούβα) near Olympia, Greece, where the Kondylis' family house is still standing today, he moved with his father, who was a military officer, at the age of six to Kifisia, Athens, where he attended school. Kondylis studied classical philology and philosophy at the University of Athens (at which time he was drawn to Marxism), as well as philosophy, medieval and modern history and political science at the Universities of Frankfurt and Heidelberg. During his postgraduate studies at Heidelberg he earned his PhD (under the supervision of Dieter Henrich) with the 700-page study of the origins of post-Kantian German idealism, including the early years of Hegel, Schelling and Hölderlin: \"Die Entstehung der Dialektik\" (\"The Genesis of Dialectics\"), which supported views considered innovative and provocative at the time, including illuminating the pre-history of Marxism and the world-theoretical presuppοsitions of the Marxist philosophy of history. Outstanding German historians Werner Conze and Reinhart Koselleck were important guiding influences during his formative years in Heidelberg.\n\nHe died in Athens in 1998. His library of some 5000 titles based in his house in Politeia, Athens was donated by his sister, Melpo Kondylis (Μέλπω Κονδύλη), to the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in which a special \"Kondylis\" section exists in the campus library. In November 2008 a conference was held in Heidelberg honouring the memory of the late Panagiotis Kondylis. A similar event was held in Greece on 22 May 2008.\n\nThe great bulk of his corpus was written in German, and most of his writings were translated by Kondylis himself into Greek. He was interested in a number of areas of study including: the Enlightenment and the preceding Renaissance-era critiques of metaphysics; the philosophy of war and Clausewitz, as well as the work of Hegel and Marx; Western bourgeois culture and its decline; Conservatism; post-Modernity, and International Affairs. He also translated into modern Greek classic works by authors such as: Xenophon, Burnham, Machiavelli, Marx, Lichtenberg, Pavese, Montesquieu, Chamfort, Rivarol, Schiller, Cassirer and Carl Schmitt. Moreover, he was publications manager of the Greek-language \"Philosophical and Political Library\" (editions Γνώση (1983–1998; 60 volumes)) and \"Modern European Civilisation\" (editions Νεφέλη (1997–2000; 12 volumes)), producing modern Greek translations of renowned texts by authors as diverse as: Hobbes, Lyotard, Foucault, ancient Greek Sophists and Cynics, Moscovici, Sorel, Heidegger, Burckhardt, Michels, Aron, Leo Strauss, Derrida, Locke, Hauser et al., and histories of modern Greek philosophy. Kondylis's best known books are: \"Die Aufklärung\" (\"The Enlightenment\") and \"Macht und Entscheidung\" (\"Power and Decision\") (see below).\n\nKondylis claimed to be \"scientific\" in the sense of writing \"descriptively\" (and explanatorily), in separating \"Is\" (facts) from \"Ought\" (values), rather than writing \"prescriptively\" or \"normatively\". The thread running through all of Kondylis's writings (whether primarily focussed on the history of ideas, social ontology, historical sociology, geopolitics, etc.) is his position that the historical plethora and variety of individual, social and theoretical behaviour or endeavour unfolds against a backdrop of the anthropological law (or constants) of \"power\" and \"decision\". Such \"power\" and \"decision\" continually traverse a friend–foe spectrum within historically formed (and currently dynamic) societies characterised by varying degrees of multi-faceted social relations of individual and collective subjects (in and through which e.g. biological impulses are rationally justified and embellished so that their voice is heard as the command of ethics; the impulse of self-preservation manifests itself as \"meaning of life\"; and sexual urges are dressed up as \"love\"). Orientation, identity formation, hierarchisation, interpretation, the production of normative systems, ideologies, rationality as self-control and the abandonment or postponement of immediate gratification, etc., are all means through which power relations manifest themselves socially and distinguish human civilisations from the basic instinctual behaviour and unrationalised raw violence of the animal kingdom (in short: humans accept \"meaning\" in seeking power, whereas animals do not). As human societies become more complex (and materially wealthier), power and its self-intensification ceases to often coincide with mere physical superiority (as in the case of primitive conditions), and power is often objectivised through greater use of historically determined and relative ((re-)interpreted and often contested) symbols and values. However, raw physical power is always at least potentially available for use by individual and collective subjects who wish to maintain and expand their power. Even scientific knowledge is not beyond historical determination and polemical manipulation – but only scientific knowledge, if it consistently separates \"Is\" from \"Ought\", can explain in terms of corroboration with empirical reality the abundant variety of human existence and \"knowing\".\n\nHis final major work \"Das Politische und der Mensch\" (\"The Political and Man\") remained unfinished at the time of his death, but nevertheless managed to present a unified social-scientific theory or \"value-free\" description of social phenomena, encompassing socio-ontological, sociological and historical aspects of the study of human affairs. Kondylis's conception of social ontology does not offer any fixed causalities or laws nor does it say what people ought to do or not do in any given situation or how their social action should unfold. The task of social ontology is accordingly not to reduce fluid and varied phenomena to basic samples and basic genetic factors; what is sought is to show the spectrum of the forces and factors, which can only be constituted and become discernible from the – irreducible and inexhaustible – diversity of form. Such forces and factors, of course, include certain constants such as striving for self-preservation through the expanding of one's own power, and the friend–foe relation, which exist in all societies and are actualised in concrete historical situations and therefore have concrete dimension and content e.g. when the dominant paradigm might be theocentrism or anthropocentrism or mass democratic post-Modernity. Much of the nearly completed first volume (three volumes had been planned by Kondylis) is an analysis of mass-democratic ideology in the social sciences while also dealing with methodological and theoretical questions such as the distinction between \"socio-ontic observation\" and \"socio-historical observation\" and the three key aspects of the social: the social relation, the political and man. Moreover, Kondylis examines the social relation as regards its \"internal\" mechanism of subjectivity and \"external\" mechanism of action, the friend–foe polarity and the social relation's continuity, in addition to exploring the concepts of understanding and rationality by way of an extensive examination and/or critique of numerous renowned authors such as Martin Buber, Émile Durkheim, Wilhelm Dilthey, Jürgen Habermas, Martin Heidegger, Edmund Husserl, Niklas Luhmann, George Herbert Mead, Alfred Schütz, Talcott Parsons, Karl Popper, Georg Simmel, Ferdinand Tönnies, Max Weber and Leopold von Wiese.\n\nApart from being a comprehensive survey of the major polemical trends in the European History of Ideas from the end of the Middle Ages and the subsequent turn against Cartesian Rationalism by many mainstream and other Enlightenment figures promoting a \"new\" or revived sensualism, until the post-Kantian period of Schelling and Hegel, \"Die Aufklärung\" (\"The Enlightenment\"), together with \"Die neuzeitliche Metaphysikkritik\" (\"Modern-era Criticism of Metaphysics\"), can be seen as analyses of the European Modern Era's struggle against value-relativity and nihilism, which were the logical conclusion of the overall rationalist positioning in the European Modern Era. Against the Aristotelian metaphysics of essence, the notion of function was recruited, and then the danger of breaking-down all essences into variable functions had to be confronted with the invention of new beings: \"Nature\", \"Man\" and \"History\" thus succeeded God and the (transcendental) Spirit. However, the notion of function totally prevailed in the course of the 20th century in the context of overthrowing essence on a global scale (notwithstanding the ongoing and socially inevitable influence of various ideologies and religions); see \"The Decline of Bourgeois Thought- and Life-Forms\" below. Throughout these books, self-preservation and power appear as key concepts in interpreting human affairs, and in setting aside all dualisms and Platonisms, all the traditional distinctions between Hither and Thither, the ideal and reality, understanding and volition. From the point of view of the history of ideas, while the philosophers who did systematically set aside such dualisms were few and far between (e.g. Machiavelli, Hobbes, Spinoza, La Mettrie, de Sade, and to a lesser extent, Diderot, Helvetius, Holbach, Hume), quantitatively, philosophers expounding versions of the traditional distinctions mentioned above, or at least maintained a normative stance necessary to seek social influence, prevailed for much of the European Modern Era, and Kondylis also analysed the basic stance(s) of such and other thinkers including: Alembert, Condillac, Condorcet, Grotius, Hegel, Hamann, Herder, Kant, Leibniz, Lessing, Maupertuis, Newton, Rousseau, Shaftesbury, Voltaire, and Wolff, in considerable detail, as well as referring to other (pre-)Enlightenment thinkers (in addition to those mentioned above) such as: Augustine, Aquinas, Aristotle, Bacon, Bayle, Berkeley, Bruno, Descartes, Erasmus, Galilei, Locke, Pascal, Plato, Pufendorf, Telesio, etc.. In both \"The Enlightenment\" and \"Modern-era Criticism of Metaphysics\", Kondylis runs a compelling interpretative thread through the constant reformulation of concepts and positioning and apparently overwhelming volume of argumentation, from the late Middle Ages until the 19th century (and 20th century in the case of \"Modern-era Criticism of Metaphysics\", which includes analyses of: Bergson, Dilthey, Feuerbach, Heidegger, Malebranche, Mill, Nietzsche, Occam, Russell, Salutati, Spencer, Whitehead, Wittgenstein, and Zabarella), producing scholarly works that not only have a handbook or reference text quality but also an ability to provide insight into the motive forces of development of, and changes in, the history of ideas in the European Modern Era (see also \"Conservatism\" below) before the onset of the new Planetary Era.\n\nIn \"Macht und Entscheidung\" (\"Power and De-cisio)\" Kondylis set forth the theoretical basis for his attitude to existence and his own endeavours as an author and social scientist. \"Decision\" is here conceptualised differently from its hitherto known varieties in decisionism; now it appears as a theory about the emergence of individual and collective worldviews. Such an emergence as a function of power i.e. self-preservation through self-enhancement (or self-intensification), always refers to enemy positioning, and as such always contains normative elements within itself. Kondylis examines the claimed bindingness and also ambiguity inherent in all ideologies and social institutions. Drawing from anthropology, philosophy, sociology and history, concepts such as value, value-freedom and nihilism are explored. It is claimed that the infinite variety of human perceptions, beliefs, ideologies, i.e. world-views, are nothing more than an effort to give personal interests a normative form and an objective character, deriving from a \"decision\" on what means should be used, who should be a friend and who a foe, in the big \"Hobbesian\" struggle for what is the most primitive and common goal of all humans – self-preservation. Therefore, personal and/or group world-views and ideologies in general are used as a weapon in everyday struggle for the purpose of power claims and self-preservation. Social and historical being and becoming consist of transitory existences – regardless of whether they invoke Reason and ethics or not – seeking power (in any one or more of its countless forms). That is how Nature's (and society's) creatures are, and they cannot do otherwise.\n\nKondylis's next book, \"Konservativismus. Geschichtlicher Gehalt und Untergang.\" (\"Conservatism. Historical Content and Decline.\"), like \"The Enlightenment\", which broke new ground in its novel interpretation of such a pivotal period in European philosophy (see above), went against the grain of conventional wisdom on the history of conservatism understood simply as a reaction to the French Revolution as articulated by e.g. Karl Mannheim. Rather, in Kondylis's book, conservatism had already existed as a social and political force since the Middle Ages in which the nobility and its estate system, having derived its legitimacy from a particular conception of law as a privilege, combated emerging egalitarian interpretations of law in the European Modern Era, which encompassed the rise of the modern sovereign state, albeit initially in absolutist guises (among which were the attempt to impose religious tolerance and peace in the aftermath of the Reformation and the religious wars). Nevertheless, the book also examines conservatism as a political force adapting to the reality of the modern sovereign state's eventual triumph and in light of the French Revolution and beyond. Included is an analysis of how the central themes used in the socialist criticism of capitalism were initially formed in the ideological realm of the counter-Revolution, whose social conveyor of this first anti-capitalist criticism was the patriarchal great-landholder, the older or younger aristocrat, who saw his social existence being eroded and falling apart by the irrepressible march of mercantile-monetary relations, the Industrial Revolution and by individualistic-liberal ideas. What followed was an idealised image of pre-capitalist reality, whereby people lived united by the bonds of blood, tradition and mutual faith and protection, from the earth and in nature, preserving their existential essence from the fragmentation which is imposed by the advanced division of labour and the continuous hunt for material gain in a society cut up into competitive individuals. Key intellectuals during conservatism's history include: Bonald, Burke, Carlyle, Chateaubriand, Cortés, Fénelon, Haller, Jarcke, de Maistre, Moser, Müller, Radowitz, Schlegel, and Stahl.\n\nIn \"Theorie des Krieges\" (\"Theory of War\"), Kondylis opposed Raymond Aron's liberal interpretation of Clausewitz's theory. According to Aron in \"Penser La Guerre\" Clausewitz was one of the first writers condemning the militarism of military elites and their war-proneness (based on the famous sentence \"war is a continuation of politics by other means\"). Kondylis claimed that this was a reconstruction not coherent with Clausewitz's thought. Clausewitz was, according to Kondylis, morally indifferent to war from a theoretical point of view, and his propounding of the value of political rule over war had nothing to do with pacifistic claims. For Clausewitz war was just a means in the eternal quest for power in an often anarchical and unsafe world, and as such war could neither be a continuous phenomenon, nor cease altogether. In other words, war arose from the political (i.e. \"political communication\") in the wider sense of social existence encompassing society as a whole (inclusive of anthropological factors), and whether war occurred at a particular time or not depended on a correlation of social and political forces encompassing collective and individual input into any given state of affairs. Kondylis saw in Clausewitz a general theory of war with sufficiently inclusive and elastic conceptualisation which could cover all forms of strategy – even antithetical forms: from primitive guerrilla warfare to extremely technicised contemporary war, as well as the possibility of terrorism using advanced technology to cripple modern-day societies. Kondylis continued with an analysis of Lenin's, Engels's and Marx's theories of war, articles about military staff and politicians, technological and absolute war, and concluded (in the Greek edition) with an analysis of a possible Greek–Turkish war.\n\nIn \"Der Niedergang der bürgerlichen Denk- und Lebensformen. Die liberale Moderne und die massendemokratische Postmoderne\" (\"The Decline of Bourgeois Thought- and Life-Forms. The Liberal Modern and the mass-democratic Post-modern\"), Kondylis used Weberian ideal-typical analysis to outline the great \"paradigm shift\" of post-Modernity from around 1900 onwards, in bringing to an end the previously dominant bourgeois-liberal hierarchical and humanist world-view, and ushering in a new era of mass-democratic pluralism and leveling of hierarchies based on mass-democratic social formations characterised by, \"inter alia\", historically unprecedented mass production and mass consumption, atomisation and mobility, and, not least of all, the various forms of mass-democratic ideology. To this end, Kondylis made effective use of his distinction between the \"synthetic-harmonising thought-form\" and the \"analytic-combinatory thought-form\" in which the latter set aside the former during the same period as the setting-aside of classical bourgeois liberalism by mass democracy, which for the most part occurred as the re-interpretation and changing of liberalism in accordance with the needs of mass democracy, and not always as an open and programmatic clash between the two. The \"synthetic-harmonising thought-form\" and the \"analytic-combinatory thought-form\" distinction is applied by Kondylis to his extensive overview of developments in the arts (including literature, music, architecture, the visual arts, cinema), as well as of developments in philosophy, the sciences and commonplace mind-sets and ways of living, mainly from the second half of the 19th century until the cultural revolution of the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nIn \"Planetarische Politik nach dem kalten Krieg\" (\"Planetary Politics after the Cold War\"), Kondylis dealt with a number of matters e.g. conceptual confusion in the overtly polemical and unhistorical use of \"conservative\", \"liberal\" and \"(social) democracy\"; mass democracy as the world's first international social formation; the impact of communism on the 20th century; and \"human rights\" as predominantly American ideology but also amenable to interpretations contrary to American interests, i.e. the dissemination of universal human rights ideology will lead to a significant increase in international conflict and increase the worldwide trend towards anomy. The end of the Cold War in particular emerges as a pivotal point in history in which the European Modern Era finds itself in its historical twilight while coming full circle, absorbed by the Planetary Era which the European Modern Era itself inaugurated with the great geographic discoveries of the 15th and 16th centuries. Planetary history gulps down its creator, European history – another one of the blaring examples of the unintended consequences of collective action in history.\n\nKondylis's published works as a whole can be seen as a unified series of analyses based on an unwavering adherence to empirical fact and logical consistency no matter what aspect of study is being emphasised at any given time. He sought to eliminate artificial academic boundaries between e.g. \"philosophy\", \"anthropology\", \"economics\", \"history\", \"sociology\" and \"politics\" by emphasising the interconnectedness of such disciplines from the point of view of \"value-free\" i.e. \"power claim\"-free and non-normative scientific understanding. He thought of himself as \"an observer of human affairs\" or \"writer\" or \"historian of ideas, social historian and theorist\" (always writing by hand), rather than as a \"philosopher\", producing a body of work that bears little resemblance to any other author, apart from perhaps Max Weber.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Consequential theories, like utilitarianism, say that an action is right or wrong, depending on the consequences it produces, but deontological theories, such as Immanuel Kant's categorical imperative, say that actions are either intrinsically right or intrinsically wrong. Proportionalist theories like rule utilitarianism, however, say that it is never right to go against a principle unless a proportionate reason would justify it.\n\nIn the 1960s, proportionalism was a consequentialist attempt to develop natural law, a principally Roman Catholic teleological theory most strongly associated with the 13th-century scholastic theologian Thomas Aquinas, but also found in Church Fathers such as Maximus the Confessor and John of Damascus, as well as early pagan schools of philosophy such as Stoicism. The moral guidelines set down by Roman Catholic magisterial teachings of Natural Moral Law are mostly upheld in that intrinsically evil acts are still classified so. In certain situations where there is a balance of ontic goods and ontic evils (ontic evils are those that are not immoral but merely cause pain or suffering, ontic goods are those that alleviate pain or suffering). Proportionalism asserts that one can determine the right course of action by weighing up the good and the necessary evil caused by the action. As a result, proportionalism aims to choose the lesser of evils. Pope John Paul II rules out the 1960s proportionalism in his encyclicals \"Veritatis Splendor\", promulgated in 1993 (cf. section 75), and in \"Evangelium Vitae\", 1995 (cf. article 68). Instead he offers an account of moral action based on the object of the act (\"finis operis\"), the intention of the person performing the act (\"finis operantis\"), and the circumstances surrounding the action.\n"}

Indeed, it would be impossible to have an experience of the world if we did not have a sense of temporality. That our perception brings an impression to our minds depends upon retention and protention. \n\nRetention is the process whereby a phase of a perceptual act is retained in our consciousness. It is a presentation of that which is no longer before us and is distinct from immediate experience. A simple example might be that of watching a ball being thrown. We retain where the ball was in our minds to understand the momentum of the ball as we perceive it in the immediate present. Retention is not a representation or memory but a presentation of a temporally extended present. That is, a present that extends beyond the few short milliseconds that are registered in a moment of sense perception. \n\nProtention is our anticipation of the next moment. The moment that has yet to be perceived. Again, using the example of a ball, our focus shifts along the expected path the ball will take. \n\nAccording to Husserl, perception has three temporal aspects, retention, the immediate present and protention and a flow through which each moment of protention becomes the retention of the next.\n\nMaurice Merleau-Ponty describes the temporal phenomenology of perception in the Phenomenology of Perception as follows:\n\"Husserl uses the terms protentions and retentions for the intentionalities which anchor me to an environment. They do not run from a central I, but from my perceptual field itself, so to speak, which draws along in its wake its own horizon of retentions, and bites into the future with its protentions. I do not pass through a series of instances of now, the images of which I preserve and which, placed end to end, make a line. With the arrival of every moment, its predecessor undergoes a change: I still have it in hand and it is still there, but already it is sinking away below the level of presents; in order to retain it, I need to reach through a thin layer of time. It is still the preceding moment, and I have the power to rejoin it as it was just now; I am not cut off from it, but still it would not belong to the past unless something had altered, unless it were beginning to outline itself against, or project itself upon, my present, whereas a moment ago it was my present. When a third moment arrives, the second undergoes a new modification; from being a retention it becomes the retention of a retention, and the layer of time between it and me thickens.\"\nInteresting links with this theory come from current neuroscience which shows that present, past and future are always intertwined, also in memory. Accordingly, “memory is not only about the past, but is also about the future. Indeed, while memory serves as the ability to recall previous experiences, recall itself is not solely directed toward the past, but is guided by the present for the service of the future”.\n\n"}

His father, in his youth, went as rabbi to Crete, whence his surname, \"Ha-Yewani\" (=\"the Greek\"), or \"Ha-Iḳriṭti\" (= \"the Cretan\"). Shemariah had a critical mind, and knew Italian, Latin, and Greek. Up to 1305 he studied the Bible exclusively; then he took up Talmudic aggadah and philosophy. The earliest \"Tractatus\" version in Hebrew was translated by Shemariah and presented as his own work, titled \"Sefer ha-Hihhayon\".\n\nHis reputation was such that he was called to the court of King Robert of Naples (who acted as his patron), where he devoted himself chiefly to Biblical studies and wrote commentaries on Scripture. By 1328 he had completed philosophic commentaries on the Pentateuch (especially the story of the Creation), the Book of Job, and Canticles. He aimed at bringing about a union between Karaites and Rabbinites; the Karaites, in fact, recognized and honored him.

{"id": "39704", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39704", "title": "Social contract", "text": "Social contract\n\nIn both moral and political philosophy, the social contract is a theory or model that originated during the Age of Enlightenment and usually concerns the legitimacy of the authority of the state over the individual. Social contract arguments typically posit that individuals have consented, either explicitly or tacitly, to surrender some of their freedoms and submit to the authority of the ruler (or to the decision of a majority) in exchange for protection of their remaining rights.\n\nTherefore, the relation between natural and legal rights is often a topic of social contract theory. The term takes its name from \"The Social Contract\" (French: \"Du contrat social ou Principes du droit politique\"), a 1762 book by Jean-Jacques Rousseau that discussed this concept.\n\nAlthough the antecedents of social contract theory are found in antiquity, in Greek and Stoic philosophy and Roman and Canon Law, the heyday of the social contract was the mid-17th to early 19th centuries, when it emerged as the leading doctrine of political legitimacy. The starting point for most social contract theories is an examination of the human condition absent of any political order that Thomas Hobbes termed the \"state of nature\". In this condition, individuals' actions are bound only by their personal power and conscience. From this shared starting point, social contract theorists seek to demonstrate, in different ways, why a rational individual would voluntarily consent to give up their natural freedom to obtain the benefits of political order.\n\nProminent of 17th- and 18th-century theorists of social contract and natural rights include Hugo Grotius (1625), Thomas Hobbes (1651), Samuel von Pufendorf (1673), John Locke (1689), Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1762), and Immanuel Kant (1797). Each solved the problem of political authority differently. Grotius posited that individual humans had natural rights. Thomas Hobbes famously said that in a \"state of nature\", human life would be \"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short\". In the absence of political order and law, everyone would have unlimited natural freedoms, including the \"right to all things\" and thus the freedom to plunder, rape, and murder; there would be an endless \"war of all against all\" (\"bellum omnium contra omnes\"). To avoid this, free men contract with each other to establish political community (civil society) through a social contract in which they all gain security in return for subjecting themselves to an absolute sovereign, one man or an assembly of men. Though the sovereign's edicts may well be arbitrary and tyrannical, Hobbes saw absolute government as the only alternative to the terrifying anarchy of a state of nature. Hobbes asserted that humans consent to abdicate their rights in favor of the absolute authority of government (whether monarchical or parliamentary). Pufendorf disputed Hobbes's equation of a state of nature with war. Alternatively, John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau argued that we gain civil rights in return for accepting the obligation to respect and defend the rights of others, giving up some freedoms to do so.\n\nThe central assertion that social contract approaches is that law and political order are not natural, but human creations. The social contract and the political order it creates are simply the means towards an end—the benefit of the individuals involved—and legitimate only to the extent that they fulfill their part of the agreement. Hobbes argued that government is not a party to the original contract and citizens are not obligated to submit to the government when it is too weak to act effectively to suppress factionalism and civil unrest. According to other social contract theorists, when the government fails to secure their natural rights (Locke) or satisfy the best interests of society (called the \"general will\" in Rousseau), citizens can withdraw their obligation to obey, or change the leadership through elections or other means including, when necessary, violence.\n\nLocke believed that natural rights were inalienable, and therefore the rule of God superseded government authority, while Rousseau believed that democracy (self-rule) was the best way to ensure welfare while maintaining individual freedom under the rule of law. The Lockean concept of the social contract was invoked in the United States Declaration of Independence. Social contract theories were eclipsed in the 19thcentury in favor of utilitarianism, Hegelianism, and Marxism, and were revived in the 20thcentury, notably in the form of a thought experiment by John Rawls.\n\nThe concept of the social contract was originally posed by Glaucon, as described by Plato in \"The Republic\", BookII.\n\nThe social contract theory also appears in \"Crito\", another dialogue from Plato. Over time, the social contract theory became more widespread after Epicurus (341-270 BC), the first philosopher who saw justice as a social contract, and not as existing in Nature due to divine intervention (see below and also Epicurean ethics), decided to bring the theory to the forefront of his society. As time went on, philosophers of traditional political and social thought, such as Locke, Hobbes, and Rousseau put forward their opinions on social contract, which then caused the topic to become much more mainstream.\n\nSocial contract formulations are preserved in many of the world's oldest records. The Buddhist text of the second century BCE, Mahāvastu, recounts the legend of Mahasammata. The story goes as follows:\nIn his rock edicts, the Buddhist king Asoka was said to have argued for a broad and far-reaching social contract. The Buddhist \"vinaya\" also reflects social contracts expected of the monks; one such instance is when the people of a certain town complained about monks felling saka trees, the Buddha tells his monks that they must stop and give way to social norms.\n\nEpicurus in the fourth century BCE seemed to have had a strong sense of social contract, with justice and law being rooted in mutual agreement and advantage, as evidenced by these lines, among others, from his \"Principal Doctrines\" (see also Epicurean ethics):\n\nQuentin Skinner has argued that several critical modern innovations in contract theory are found in the writings from French Calvinists and Huguenots, whose work in turn was invoked by writers in the Low Countries who objected to their subjection to Spain and, later still, by Catholics in England. Francisco Suárez (1548–1617), from the School of Salamanca, might be considered an early theorist of the social contract, theorizing natural law in an attempt to limit the divine right of absolute monarchy. All of these groups were led to articulate notions of popular sovereignty by means of a social covenant or contract, and all of these arguments began with proto-\"state of nature\" arguments, to the effect that the basis of politics is that everyone is by nature free of subjection to any government.\n\nThese arguments, however, relied on a corporatist theory found in Roman law, according to which \"a populus\" can exist as a distinct legal entity. Thus, these arguments held that a group of people can join a government because it has the capacity to exercise a single will and make decisions with a single voice in the absence of sovereign authority—a notion rejected by Hobbes and later contract theorists.\n\nIn the early 17th century, Grotius (1583–1645) introduced the modern idea that individuals had \"natural rights\" that enabled self-preservation, employing this idea as a basis for moral consensus in the face of religious diversity and the rise of natural science. He seeks to find a parsimonious basis for a moral beginning for society, a kind of natural law that everyone could accept. He goes so far as to say in his \"On the Law of War and Peace\" that even if we were to concede what we cannot concede without the utmost wickedness, namely that there is no God, these laws would still hold.\n\nThe idea was considered incendiary since it suggested that power can ultimately go back to the individuals if the political society that they have set up forfeits the purpose for which it was originally established, which is to preserve themselves. In other words, individual persons are sovereign. Grotius says that the people are \"sui juris\" (under their own jurisdiction). People have rights as human beings, but there is a delineation of those rights because of what is possible for everyone to accept morally; everyone has to accept that each person as an individual is entitled to try to preserve himself. Each person should, therefore, avoid doing harm to, or interfering with, another, and any breach of these rights should be punished.\n\nThe first modern philosopher to articulate a detailed contract theory was Thomas Hobbes (1588–1679). According to Hobbes, the lives of individuals in the state of nature were \"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short\", a state in which self-interest and the absence of rights and contracts prevented the \"social\", or society. Life was \"anarchic\" (without leadership or the concept of sovereignty). Individuals in the state of nature were apolitical and asocial. This state of nature is followed by the social contract.\n\nThe social contract was an \"occurrence\" during which individuals came together and ceded some of their individual rights so that others would cede theirs. This resulted in the establishment of the state, a sovereign entity like the individuals now under its rule used to be, which would create laws to regulate social interactions. Human life was thus no longer \"a war of all against all\".\n\nThe state system, which grew out of the social contract, was, however, also anarchic (without leadership). Just as the individuals in the state of nature had been sovereigns and thus guided by self-interest and the absence of rights, so states now acted in their self-interest in competition with each other. Just like the state of nature, states were thus bound to be in conflict because there was no sovereign over and above the state (more powerful) capable of imposing some system such as social-contract laws on everyone by force. Indeed, Hobbes' work helped to serve as a basis for the realism theories of international relations, advanced by E. H. Carr and Hans Morgenthau. Hobbes wrote in \"Leviathan\" that humans (\"we\") need the \"terrour of some Power\" otherwise humans will not heed the law of reciprocity, \"(in summe) doing to others, as wee would be done to\".\n\nJohn Locke's conception of the social contract differed from Hobbes' in several fundamental ways, retaining only the central notion that persons in a state of nature would willingly come together to form a state. Locke believed that individuals in a state of nature would be bound morally, by the Law of Nature, not to harm each other in their lives or possessions. Without government to defend them against those seeking to injure or enslave them, Locke further believed people would have no security in their rights and would live in fear. Individuals, to Locke, would only agree to form a state that would provide, in part, a \"neutral judge\", acting to protect the lives, liberty, and property of those who lived within it.\n\nWhile Hobbes argued for near-absolute authority, Locke argued for inviolate freedom under law in his \"Second Treatise of Government\". Locke argued that a government's legitimacy comes from the citizens' delegation to the government of their absolute right of violence (reserving the inalienable right of self-defense or \"self-preservation\"), along with elements of other rights (e.g. property will be liable to taxation) as necessary to achieve the goal of security through granting the state a monopoly of violence, whereby the government, as an impartial judge, may use the collective force of the populace to administer and enforce the law, rather than each man acting as his own judge, jury, and executioner—the condition in the state of nature.\n\nJean-Jacques Rousseau (1712–1778), in his influential 1762 treatise \"The Social Contract\", outlined a different version of social contract theory, as the foundations of political rights based on unlimited popular sovereignty. Although Rousseau wrote that the British were perhaps at the time the freest people on earth, he did not approve of their representative government. Rousseau believed that liberty was possible only where there was direct rule by the people as a whole in lawmaking, where popular sovereignty was indivisible and inalienable. But he also maintained that the people often did not know their \"real will\", and that a proper society would not occur until a great leader (\"the Legislator\") arose to change the values and customs of the people, likely through the strategic use of religion.\n\nRousseau's political theory differs in important ways from that of Locke and Hobbes. Rousseau's collectivism is most evident in his development of the \"luminous conception\" (which he credited to Denis Diderot) of the general will. Rousseau argues a citizen cannot pursue his true interest by being an egoist but must instead subordinate himself to the law created by the citizenry acting as a collective.\n\nRousseau's striking phrase that man must \"be forced to be free\" should be understood this way: since the indivisible and inalienable popular sovereignty decides what is good for the whole, then if an individual lapses back into his ordinary egoism and disobeys the law, he will be forced to listen to what was decided when the people acted as a collectivity (as citizens). Thus, the law, inasmuch as it is created by the people acting as a body, is not a limitation of individual freedom, but rather its expression.\n\nThus, enforcement of laws, including criminal law, is not a restriction on individual liberty: the individual, as a citizen, explicitly agreed to be constrained if, as a private individual, he did not respect his own will as formulated in the general will. Because laws represent the restraints of civil freedom, they represent the leap made from humans in the state of nature into civil society. In this sense, the law is a civilizing force, and therefore Rousseau believed that the laws that govern a people helped to mold their character.\n\nWhile Rousseau's social contract is based on popular sovereignty and not on individual sovereignty, there are other theories espoused by individualists, libertarians, and anarchists that do not involve agreeing to anything more than negative rights and creates only a limited state, if any.\n\nPierre-Joseph Proudhon (1809–1865) advocated a conception of social contract that did not involve an individual surrendering sovereignty to others. According to him, the social contract was not between individuals and the state, but rather among individuals who refrain from coercing or governing each other, each one maintaining complete sovereignty upon him- or herself:\n\nBuilding on the work of Immanuel Kant with its presumption of limits on the state, John Rawls (1921–2002), in \"A Theory of Justice\" (1971), proposed a contractarian approach whereby rational people in a hypothetical \"original position\" would set aside their individual preferences and capacities under a \"veil of ignorance\" and agree to certain general principles of justice and legal organization. This idea is also used as a game-theoretical formalization of the notion of fairness.\n\nDavid Gauthier \"neo-Hobbesian\" theory argues that cooperation between two independent and self-interested parties is indeed possible, especially when it comes to understanding morality and politics. Gauthier notably points out the advantages of cooperation between two parties when it comes to the challenge of the prisoner's dilemma. He proposes that, if two parties were to stick to the original agreed-upon arrangement and morals outlined by the contract, they would both experience an optimal result. In his model for the social contract, factors including trust, rationality, and self-interest keep each party honest and dissuade them from breaking the rules.\n\nPhilip Pettit (b. 1945) has argued, in \"Republicanism: A Theory of Freedom and Government\" (1997), that the theory of social contract, classically based on the consent of the governed, should be modified. Instead of arguing for explicit consent, which can always be manufactured, Pettit argues that the absence of an effective rebellion against it is a contract's only legitimacy.\n\nAn early critic of social contract theory was Rousseau's friend, the philosopher David Hume, who in 1742 published an essay \"Of Civil Liberty\". The second part of this essay, entitled \"Of the Original Contract\", stresses that the concept of a \"social contract\" is a convenient fiction: \n\nHume argued that consent of the governed was the ideal foundation on which a government should rest, but that it had not actually occurred this way in general. \n\nLegal scholar Randy Barnett has argued that, while presence in the territory of a society may be necessary for consent, this does not constitute consent to \"all\" rules the society might make regardless of their content. A second condition of consent is that the rules be consistent with underlying principles of justice and the protection of natural and social rights, and have procedures for effective protection of those rights (or liberties). This has also been discussed by O.A. Brownson, who argued that, in a sense, three \"constitutions\" are involved: first, the \"constitution of nature\" that includes all of what the Founders called \"natural law\"; second, the \"constitution of society\", an unwritten and commonly understood set of rules for the society formed by a social contract before it establishes a government, by which it does establish the third, a \"constitution of government\". To consent, a necessary condition is that the rules be \"constitutional\" in that sense.\n\nThe theory of an implicit social contract holds that by remaining in the territory controlled by some society, which usually has a government, people give consent to join that society and be governed by its government, if any. This consent is what gives legitimacy to such a government.\n\nOther writers have argued that consent to join the society is not necessarily consent to its government. For that, the government must be set up according to a constitution of government that is consistent with the superior unwritten constitutions of nature and society.\n\nThe theory of an implicit social contract also goes under the principles of explicit consent. The main difference between Tacit consent and explicit consent is that explicit consent is meant to leave no room for misinterpretation. Moreover, you should directly state what it is that you want and the person has to respond in a concise manner that either confirms or denies the proposition.\n\nAccording to the will theory of contract, a contract is not presumed valid unless all parties voluntarily agree to it, either tacitly or explicitly, without coercion. Lysander Spooner, a 19th-century lawyer and staunch supporter of a right of contract between individuals, argued in his essay \"No Treason\" that a supposed social contract cannot be used to justify governmental actions such as taxation because government will initiate force against anyone who does not wish to enter into such a contract. As a result, he maintains that such an agreement is not voluntary and therefore cannot be considered a legitimate contract at all.\n\nModern Anglo-American law, like European civil law, is based on a will theory of contract, according to which all terms of a contract are binding on the parties because they chose those terms for themselves. This was less true when Hobbes wrote \"Leviathan\"; at that time more importance was attached to consideration, meaning a mutual exchange of benefits necessary to the formation of a valid contract, and most contracts had implicit terms that arose from the nature of the contractual relationship rather than from the choices made by the parties. Accordingly, it has been argued that social contract theory is more consistent with the contract law of the time of Hobbes and Locke than with the contract law of our time, and that certain features in the social contract which seem anomalous to us, such as the belief that we are bound by a contract formulated by our distant ancestors, would not have seemed as strange to Hobbes' contemporaries as they do to us.\n\n\n"}

Its stated objects are for the public benefit:\n\nIt is based at Colet House, Barons Court, London.\n\nThe Society was registered in 1951 by Dr Francis C. Roles, four years after the death of his teacher, the Russian philosopher P. D. Ouspensky, who had settled in England in 1921. The Society was set up to continue Ouspensky's work as a \"School of the Fourth Way\".\n\nThe Fourth Way is a concept used by G. I. Gurdjieff to describe an approach to self-development learned over years of travel in the East that combined what he saw as three established traditional \"ways,\" or \"schools\" into a fourth way. These three ways were of the body, mind and emotions. According to his principles and instructions, Gurdjieff's method for awakening one's consciousness is different from that of the fakir, monk or yogi, so his discipline is also called the ‘Fourth Way’. His pupil P.D. Ouspensky from 1924 to 1947 made the term and its use central to his own teaching of Gurdjieff's ideas, and after Ouspensky's death, his students published a book titled \"The Fourth Way\" based on his lectures.\n\nP. D. Ouspensky had developed his system of Self-discovery from the fundamental idea that ordinary human consciousness is incomplete and that it is possible for it to evolve further by personal effort and understanding. Historically, this approach has generally been confined to closed orders, religious or otherwise and directed to the development of one particular human faculty: intellectual, emotional or physical. Ouspensky promoted the practice of a ‘Fourth Way’, whereby ordinary people, remaining engaged in life, could work on all three aspects simultaneously. His teaching asserts the unity of the individual with the whole cosmos in both structure and potential.\n\nIn Russia, Ouspensky had learned a system of knowledge and certain practical methods from G. I. Gurdjieff and until his death in 1947 Ouspensky devoted his life to further developing this system in the light of his own ideas. He established large groups of pupils in London and New York. Ouspensky’s London headquarters before and following World War II were at Colet House. This work led him to the conviction that the system was essentially incomplete; in particular it lacked a simple method to allow the ideas to develop naturally into behaviour and experience.\n\nThe Movements were introduced into this country by Mme Ouspensky in the 1930s, when they were taught to Ouspensky’s pupils at Lyne Place, Virginia Water and at Colet House. The Movements were originally called Sacred Dances, Prayers and Exercises, and were known only in certain monasteries, temples, closed communities and esoteric orders scattered throughout the Middle East, the Hindu Kush and Tibet. During his travels in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, G. I. Gurdjieff learned these sacred dances and their original music at their diverse sources and brought them together into a single repertoire which he then taught to his students in Europe.\n\nDr Roles continued with Ouspensky’s teaching for 13 years but in 1960, as a result of Ouspensky’s instruction to search for ‘the source of the system’, he came to meet Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in London. He recognised the method of mantra meditation that the Maharishi was disseminating as the simple method that Ouspensky had told him to find. The Study Society was instrumental in setting up the Maharishi’s seminal lecture to 5000 people at the Royal Albert Hall in 1961 which greatly raised his profile in Europe. Meditation was the inspiration of a group of Indian sages the most prominent of whom was Swami Brahmananda Saraswati, Guru Deva. Nevertheless, it was not until Dr Roles was introduced to Swami Shantanand Saraswati, Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath—the head of the Advaita tradition in Northern India whose teaching of the non-dual philosophy of the Vedanta complemented and completed all he had learnt before—that he became convinced that his search was over.\n\nIn 1963 the Society formed a connection with Resuhi Baykara, a leader of the Mevlevi Tradition in Istanbul who trained members of the Society in the discipline of Sufi Whirling Dance. This Sufi discipline, originated by the 13th century mystic Jalāl ad-Dīn Muhammad Rūmī is said to provide a means of acquiring inner stillness. The ceremony of the sema, or Mukabele takes place regularly at Colet House.\n\nDr Francis C. Roles died in 1982 and Shantanand Saraswati in 1997.\n\nThe Study Society currently provides the following activities:\n\n\n\n"}

Trialism keeps the two substances of mind and body, but introduces a third attribute, sensation, belonging to the union of mind and body. This allows animals, which do not have thought, to be regarded as having sensation and not as being mere automata.\n\nChristian trialism is the doctrine that humans have three separate essences (body, soul, spirit), based on a literal interpretation of 1 Thessalonians 5:23 \"And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.\" This doctrine holds the soul to belong to the union of the body and the spirit, which makes it roughly compatible with philosophical trialism. However, the evangelist Kenneth Copeland came under fire by critics such as Hank Hanegraff for extending trialism to each Person in the Trinity, for a total of nine essences.\n\nCottingham, J. \"Cartesian Trialism\", Mind, 1985.\n"}
